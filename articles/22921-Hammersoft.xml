&lt;!--Overview of discipline:--&gt;
'''Psychology''' is the study of the [[mind]] and behavior.&lt;ref name=APA&gt;{{cite web|title=How does the APA define &quot;psychology&quot;?|url=http://www.apa.org/support/about/apa/psychology.aspx#answer|accessdate=15 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its immediate goal is to understand individuals and groups by both establishing general principles and researching specific cases.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fernald&quot;&gt;Fernald LD (2008).

[http://www.apa.org/about/index.aspx ''About APA''.] Retrieved 20 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In this field, a professional [[Medical practitioner|practitioner]] or researcher is called a [[psychologist]], and can be classified as a [[social scientist]], [[behavioral scientist]], or [[cognitive scientist]]. Psychologists attempt to understand the role of [[mental function]]s in individual and [[social behavior]], while also exploring the [[physiological]] and [[neuroscience|neurobiological]] processes that underlie certain functions and behaviors. 
&lt;!--Subjects and methods:--&gt;
Psychologists explore such concepts as [[perception]], [[cognition]], [[attention]], [[emotion]], [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[motivation]], [[Human brain#Functions|brain functioning]], [[personality psychology|personality]], [[behavior]], and [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal relationships]]. Some, especially [[depth psychologist]]s, also consider the [[unconscious mind]].{{Ref|reference_name_A|a}} Psychologists employ [[empirical method]]s to infer [[causal]] and [[correlation and dependence|correlational]] relationships between psychosocial [[dependent and independent variables|variables]]. In [[eclecticism|addition]], or in [[antipositivism|opposition]], to employing [[empirical]] and [[Deductive-nomological model|deductive]] methods, someâespecially [[Clinical psychology|clinical]] and [[counseling psychology|counseling]] psychologistsâat times rely upon [[Hermeneutics#Psychology|symbolic interpretation]] and other [[inductive reasoning|inductive]] techniques. Psychology incorporates research from the [[social sciences]], [[natural sciences]], and [[humanities]], such as [[philosophy]].

&lt;!--Application and scope:--&gt;
While psychological [[knowledge]] is often [[Applied science|applied]] to the [[psychological assessment|assessment]] and [[psychotherapy|treatment]] of [[mental health]] [[psychopathology|problems]], it is also applied to understanding and solving problems in many different spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]]. Although the majority of psychologists are involved in some kind of therapeutic role (clinical, [[counseling psychology|counseling]], and [[school psychology|school]] positions), many do scientific research on a wide range of topics related to mental processes and behavior (typically in university psychology departments) or teach such knowledge in academic settings; and some are employed in [[industrial and organizational psychology|industrial and organizational]] settings, and in other areas&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, Occupational Outlook Handbook, 2010â11 Edition, Psychologists, on the Internet at [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos056.htm bls.gov] (visited July 08, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[developmental psychology|human development and aging]], [[sport psychology|sports]], [[health psychology|health]], [[media psychology|the media]], [[legal psychology|law]], and [[forensic psychology|forensics]].

==Etymology==
The word ''psychology'' literally means, &quot;the study of the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]&quot; ([[wikt:ÏÏÏÎ®|ÏÏÏÎ®]], ''psukhÄ'', meaning &quot;breath&quot;, &quot;spirit&quot;, or &quot;soul&quot;; and -Î»Î¿Î³Î¯Î± [[wikt:-logia|''-logia'']], translated as &quot;study of&quot; or &quot;research&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[wikt:psychology|Psychology]]&lt;/ref&gt;).&lt;ref name=&quot;OED&quot;&gt;Online Etymology Dictionary. (2001). [http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=psychology &quot;Psychology&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin word ''psychologia'' was first used by the [[Croatia]]n [[humanism|humanist]] and [[Croatian latinistic literature|Latinist]] [[Marko MaruliÄ]] in his book, ''Psichiologia de ratione animae humanae'' in the late 15th century or early 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Krstic/marulic.htm Classics in the History of Psychology â Marko Marulic â The Author of the Term &quot;Psychology&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known reference to the word ''psychology'' in English was by [[Steven Blankaart]] in 1694 in ''The Physical Dictionary'' which refers to &quot;Anatomy, which treats of the Body, and Psychology, which treats of the Soul.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OED Psychology&quot;&gt;(Steven Blankaart, p. 13) as quoted in &quot;psychology n.&quot; A Dictionary of Psychology.

==History==
{{Main|History of psychology}}
[[File:Wundt-research-group.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Wilhelm Wundt]] (seated) with colleagues in his psychological laboratory, the first of its kind. Wundt is credited with setting up psychology as a field of scientific inquiry independent of the disciplines philosophy and biology.]]
The study of psychology in a [[philosophical]] context dates back to the ancient civilizations of [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[History of China|China]], [[History of India|India]], and [[Persian Empire|Persia]]. Historians point to the writings of ancient Greek philosophers, such as [[Thales]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]] (especially in his ''[[On the Soul|De Anima]]'' treatise),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/aristotle-psychology/ Aristotle's Psychology]&quot;. Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;/ref&gt; as the first significant body of work in the West to be rich in psychological thought.&lt;ref&gt;Green, C.D. &amp; Groff, P.R. (2003). ''Early psychological thought: Ancient accounts of mind and soul.'' Westport, Connecticut: Praeger.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!--Why is Cabanis being singled out for mention here? As of September 2010, his name does not appear at all in [[History of psychology]]âwhich might be a good place to put this paragraph. &quot;In 1802, French physiologist [[Pierre Cabanis]] sketched out the beginnings of [[physiological psychology]] with his essay, ''Rapports du physique et du moral de l'homme'' (''On the relations between the physical and moral aspects of man''). Cabanis interpreted the mind in light of his previous studies of [[biology]], arguing that [[sensibility]] and [[soul (spirit)|soul]] are properties of the [[nervous system]].&quot;--&gt;

===Structuralism===
{{Main|Structuralism (psychology)}}
German physician [[Wilhelm Wundt]] is credited with introducing psychological discovery into a [[laboratory]] setting. Known as the &quot;father of [[experimental psychology]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;WundtStanford&quot;/&gt; he founded the first psychological laboratory, at [[Leipzig University]], in 1879.&lt;ref name=&quot;WundtStanford&quot;&gt;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. (2006). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wilhelm-wundt/ &quot;Wilhelm Maximilian Wundt&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components. Although not himself a structuralist, his student [[Edward Titchener]], a major figure in early American psychology, was a structuralist thinker opposed to functionalist approaches.

===Functionalism===
{{Main|Functional psychology}}
Functionalism formed as a reaction to the theories of the structuralist school of thought and was heavily influenced by the work of the American philosopher, scientist and psychologist [[William James]]. James felt that psychology should have practical value, and that psychologists should find out how the mind can function to a person's benefit. In his book, ''[[Principles of Psychology]]'',&lt;ref&gt;The Principles of Psychology (1890), with introduction by George A. Miller, Harvard University Press, 1983 paperback, ISBN 0-674-70625-0 (combined edition, 1328 pages)&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1890, he laid the foundations for many of the questions that psychologists would explore for years to come. Other major functionalist thinkers included [[John Dewey]] and [[Harvey Carr]].

Other 19th-century contributors to the field include the German psychologist [[Hermann Ebbinghaus]], a pioneer in the experimental study of [[memory]], who developed quantitative models of learning and forgetting&lt;ref&gt;Wozniak, R.H. (1999). Introduction to memory: Hermann Ebbinghaus (1885/1913). [http://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Ebbinghaus/wozniak.htm Classics in the history of psychology]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[University of Berlin]]; and the Russian-Soviet [[physiologist]] [[Ivan Pavlov]], who discovered in dogs a learning process that was later termed &quot;[[classical conditioning]]&quot; and applied to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Windholz |first=G. |year=1997 |title=Ivan P. Pavlov: An overview of his life and psychological work |journal=American Psychologist |volume=52 |pages=941â946 |issue=9 |doi= 10.1037/0003-066X.52.9.941}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1950s, the experimental techniques set forth by Wundt, James, Ebbinghaus, and others would be reiterated as experimental psychology became increasingly [[cognitive]]âconcerned with [[information]] and its [[information processing|processing]]âand, eventually, constituted a part of the wider [[cognitive science]].&lt;ref name=Mandler/&gt; In its early years, this development had been seen as a &quot;[[cognitive revolution|revolution]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=Mandler&gt;Mandler, G. (2007). A history of modern experimental psychology: From James and Wundt to cognitive science. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as it both responded to and reacted against strains of thoughtâincluding [[psychodynamics]] and [[behaviorism]]âthat had developed in the meantime.

===Psychoanalysis===
{{Main|Psychoanalysis}}
From the 1890s until his death in 1939, the Austrian physician [[Sigmund Freud]] developed [[psychoanalysis]], a method of investigation of the mind and the way one thinks; a systematized set of theories about human behavior; and a form of [[psychotherapy]] to treat psychological or emotional distress, especially unconscious conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, B.E.; Fine, B.D. (1968), A Glossary of Psychoanalytic Terms and Concepts, Amer Psychoanalytic Assn, p. 78, ISBN 978-0-318-13125-2&lt;/ref&gt; Freud's psychoanalytic theory was largely based on interpretive methods, [[introspection]] and clinical observations. It became very well known, largely because it tackled subjects such as [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[psychological repression|repression]], and the [[unconscious mind]] as general aspects of psychological development. These were largely considered [[taboo]] subjects at the time, and Freud provided a catalyst for them to be openly discussed in polite society. Clinically, Freud helped to pioneer the method of [[Free association (psychology)|free association]] and a therapeutic interest in [[dream interpretation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |author=Freud, S |title=The Interpretation of Dreams |year=1900 |edition=2nd |volume=IV and V |publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |author=Freud, S |title=The Unconscious |year=1915 |edition=2nd |volume=XIV |publisher=Hogarth Press, 1955}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud had a significant influence on Swiss [[psychiatry|psychiatrist]] [[Carl Jung]], whose [[analytical psychology]] became an alternative form of [[depth psychology]]. Other well-known psychoanalytic scholars of the mid-20th century included psychoanalysts, psychologists, psychiatrists, and philosophers. Among these thinkers were [[Erik Erikson]], [[Melanie Klein]], [[Donald Winnicott|D.W. Winnicott]], [[Karen Horney]], [[Erich Fromm]], [[John Bowlby]], and Sigmund Freud's daughter, [[Anna Freud]]. Throughout the 20th century, psychoanalysis evolved into diverse schools of thought, most of which may be classed as [[Neo-Freudian]].{{Ref|reference_name_B|b}}

Psychoanalytic theory and therapy were criticized by psychologists such as [[Hans Eysenck]], and by philosophers including [[Karl Popper]]. Popper, a [[philosopher of science]], argued that psychoanalysis had been misrepresented as a scientific discipline,&lt;ref name=&quot;Popper&quot;&gt;Karl Popper, Conjectures and Refutations, London: Routledge and Keagan Paul, 1963, pp. 33â39; from Theodore Schick, ed., Readings in the Philosophy of Science, Mountain View, CA: Mayfield Publishing Company, 2000, pp. 9â13. [http://faculty.washington.edu/lynnhank/Popper.doc Faculty.washington.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Eysenck said that psychoanalytic tenets had been contradicted by [[experiment]]al data. By the 20th century, psychology departments in [[Higher education in the United States|American universities]] had become [[positivism|scientifically oriented]], marginalizing Freudian theory and dismissing it as a &quot;desiccated and dead&quot; historical artifact.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/11/25/weekinreview/25cohen.html?_r=3&amp;ref=education&amp;oref&amp;oref=slogin June 2008 study by the [[American Psychoanalytic Association]], as reported in the ''[[New York Times]]''], &quot;Freud Is Widely Taught at Universities, Except in the Psychology Department&quot; by Patricia Cohen, November 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, however, researchers in the emerging field of [[neuro-psychoanalysis]] defended some of Freud's ideas on scientific grounds,{{Ref|reference_name_C|c}} while scholars of the [[humanities]] maintained that Freud was not a &quot;scientist at all, but ... an [[hermeneutics|interpreter]].&quot;&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt;

===Behaviorism===
{{Main|Behaviorism}}
[[Image:Skinner teaching machine 01.jpg|thumb|right|Skinner's [[teaching machine]], a mechanical invention to automate the task of [[programmed instruction]].]]
In the United States, behaviorism became the dominant school of thought during the 1950s. Behaviorism is a discipline that was established in the early 20th century by [[John B. Watson]], and embraced and extended by [[Edward Thorndike]], [[Clark L. Hull]], [[Edward C. Tolman]], and later [[B.F. Skinner]]. Theories of learning emphasized the ways in which people might be predisposed, or conditioned, by their environments to behave in certain ways.

[[Classical conditioning]] was an early behaviorist model. It posited that behavioral tendencies are determined by immediate associations between various environmental [[stimulusâresponse model|stimuli]] and the degree of pleasure or pain that follows. Behavioral patterns, then, were understood to consist of organisms' conditioned responses to the stimuli in their environment. The stimuli were held to exert influence in proportion to their prior repetition or to the previous intensity of their associated [[pain]] or [[pleasure]]. Much research consisted of laboratory-based animal experimentation, which was increasing in popularity as [[physiology]] grew more sophisticated.

Skinner's behaviorism shared with its predecessors a philosophical inclination toward [[positivism]] and [[determinism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Overskeid&quot;&gt;Overskeid, G. (2007). [http://inside.bard.edu/~luka/documents/SkinnerandFreud.pdf &quot;Looking for Skinner and finding Freud&quot;]. ''[[The American Psychologist|American Psychologist]] 62''(6), 590â595.&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the contents of the mind were not open to scientific scrutiny and that scientific psychology should emphasize the study of observable behavior. He focused on behaviorâenvironment relations and analyzed overt and covert (i.e., private) behavior as a function of the organism interacting with its environment.&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. (1974). About Behaviorism. New York: Random House&lt;/ref&gt; Behaviorists usually rejected or deemphasized [[dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualistic]] explanations such as &quot;mind&quot; or &quot;consciousness&quot;; and, in lieu of probing an &quot;unconscious mind&quot; that underlies unawareness, they spoke of the &quot;contingency-shaped behaviors&quot; in which unawareness becomes outwardly manifest.&lt;ref name=&quot;Overskeid&quot;/&gt;

Among the behaviorists' most famous creations are John B. Watson's [[Little Albert experiment]], which applied classical conditioning to the developing human child, and Skinner's notion of [[operant conditioning]], which acknowledged that human [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] could affect patterns and cycles of environmental stimuli and behavioral responses. 

Linguist [[Noam Chomsky]]'s critique of the behaviorist model of [[language acquisition]] is widely regarded as a key factor in the decline of behaviorism's prominence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlinger&quot;&gt;{{Cite book |author= Schlinger, H.D. |year=2008 |title=The long good-bye: why B.F. Skinner's Verbal Behavior is alive and well on the 50th anniversary of its publication |journal=The Psychological Record}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Martin Seligman]] and colleagues discovered that the conditioning of dogs led to outcomes (&quot;[[learned helplessness]]&quot;) that opposed the predictions of behaviorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Seligman M.E.P.; Maier S.F. |year= 1967 |title=Failure to escape traumatic shock |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=1â9 |doi=10.1037/h0024514 |pmid=6032570}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Overmier J.B.; Seligman M.E.P. |year=1967 |title=Effects of inescapable shock upon subsequent escape and avoidance responding |journal=Journal of Comparative and Physiological Psychology |volume=63 |issue=1 |pages=28â33 |doi= 10.1037/h0024166 |pmid=6029715}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Skinner's behaviorism did not die, perhaps in part because it generated successful practical applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schlinger&quot;/&gt; The fall of behaviorism as an overarching model in psychology, however, gave way to a new dominant paradigm: cognitive approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/~geo/Miller.pdf [[George Abram Miller|George A. Miller]]. The cognitive revolution: a historical perspective, ''Trends in Cognitive Sciences'', Vol.7, No.3, March 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humanism===
{{Main|Humanistic psychology|}}
[[Image:Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.svg|thumb|right|250px|Psychologist Abraham Maslow in 1943 posited that humans have a hierarchy of needs, and it makes sense to fulfill the basic needs first (food, water etc.) before higher-order needs can be met.&lt;ref name=honolulu&gt;[http://honolulu.hawaii.edu/intranet/committees/FacDevCom/guidebk/teachtip/maslow.htm Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Humanistic psychology]] was developed in the 1950s in reaction to both [[behaviorism]] and psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gazzaniga|first=Michael|title=Psychological Science|year=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company|location=New York|isbn=9780393934212|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[intersubjectivity]] and first-person categories, the humanistic approach sought to glimpse the whole personânot just the fragmented parts of the personality or cognitive functioning.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, John. (2001). ''Ordinary Ecstasy: The Dialectics of Humanistic Psychology.'' London, UK: Brunner-Routledge. ISBN 0-415-23633-9&lt;/ref&gt; Humanism focused on fundamentally and uniquely human issues, such as individual free will, personal growth, [[self-actualization]], [[self-concept|self-identity]], [[death]], [[Loneliness#As human condition|aloneness]], [[free will|freedom]], and [[meaning (existential)|meaning]]. The humanistic approach was distinguished by its emphasis on subjective meaning, rejection of determinism, and concern for positive growth rather than pathology.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Some of the founders of the humanistic school of thought were American psychologists [[Abraham Maslow]], who formulated a [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|hierarchy of human needs]], and [[Carl Rogers]], who created and developed [[client-centered therapy]]. Later, [[positive psychology]] opened up humanistic themes to scientific modes of exploration.

===Gestalt===
{{main|Gestalt psychology}}
[[Wolfgang Kohler]], [[Max Wertheimer]] and [[Kurt Koffka]] co-founded the school of [[Gestalt psychology]]. This approach is based upon the idea that individuals experience things as unified wholes. This approach to psychology began in Germany and Austria during the late 19th century in response to the molecular approach of structuralism. Rather than breaking down thoughts and behavior to their smallest element, the Gestalt position maintains that the whole of experience is important, and the whole is different than the sum of its parts.

Gestalt psychology should not be confused with the [[Gestalt therapy]] of [[Fritz Perls]], which is only peripherally linked to Gestalt psychology.

===Existentialism===
{{main|Existential therapy}}
In the 1950s and 1960s, largely influenced by the work of [[Germans|German]] philosopher [[Martin Heidegger]] and [[Danish people|Danish]] philosopher [[SÃ¸ren Kierkegaard]], psychoanalytically trained [[United States|American]] psychologist [[Rollo May]] pioneered an [[existential]] branch of psychology, which included [[existential therapy|existential psychotherapy]], a method of therapy that operates on the belief that inner conflict within a person is due to that individual's confrontation with the givens of existence.

Existential psychologists differed from others often classified as humanistic in their comparatively neutral view of [[human nature]] and in their relatively positive assessment of [[anxiety]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hergenhahn4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA, USA |year=2005 |pages=546â47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existential psychologists emphasized the humanistic themes of death, free will, and meaning, suggesting that meaning can be shaped by [[myth]]s, or narrative patterns,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hergenhahn&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA, USA |year=2005 |pages=523â32}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it can be encouraged by an acceptance of the free will requisite to an [[authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]], albeit often anxious, regard for death and other future prospects.

Austrian existential psychiatrist and [[Holocaust]] survivor [[Viktor Frankl]] drew evidence of meaning's therapeutic power from reflections garnered from his own [[internment]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Frankl&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Frankl, V.E. |title=Man's search for meaning (rev. ed.) |publisher=Washington Square Press |location=New York, NY, USA |year=1984 |page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he created a variety of existential psychotherapy called [[logotherapy]], a type of [[existentialism|existentialist]] analysis that focuses on a ''[[Meaning (existential)|will to meaning]]'' (in one's life), as opposed to Adler's [[Nietzsche]]an doctrine of ''[[will to power]]'' or Freud's ''[[Pleasure principle (psychology)|will to pleasure]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Seidner, Stanley S. (June 10, 2009) [http://docs.google.com/gview?a=v&amp;q=cache:FrKYAo88ckkJ:www.materdei.ie/media/conferences/a-secular-age-parallel-sessions-timetable.pdf+%22Stan+Seidner%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us &quot;A Trojan Horse: Logotherapeutic Transcendence and its Secular Implications for Theology&quot;]. ''Mater Dei Institute''. p 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to May and Frankl, Swiss psychoanalyst [[Ludwig Binswanger]] and American psychologist [[George Kelly (psychologist)|George Kelly]] may be said to belong to the existential school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hergenhahn3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author=Hergenhahn, B.R. |title=An introduction to the history of psychology |publisher=Thomson Wadsworth |location=Belmont, CA, USA |year=2005 |pages=528â36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cognitivism===
{{Ref improve section|date=June 2010}}
{{Main|Cognitivism (psychology)|Cognitive psychology}}
[[Image:Working memory model.svg|thumb|right|250px|[[Baddeley's model of working memory]]]]
Cognitive psychology is the branch of psychology that studies mental processes including how people think, perceive, remember, and learn. As part of the larger field of cognitive science, this branch of psychology is related to other disciplines including neuroscience, philosophy, and linguistics.

[[Noam Chomsky]] helped to ignite a &quot;[[cognitive revolution]]&quot; in psychology when he criticized the behaviorists' notions of &quot;stimulus&quot;, &quot;response&quot;, and &quot;reinforcement&quot;, arguing that such ideasâwhich Skinner had borrowed from animal experiments in the laboratoryâcould be applied to complex human behavior, most notably language acquisition, in only a superficial and vague manner. The postulation that humans are born with the instinct or &quot;[[language acquisition device|innate facility]]&quot; for acquiring language posed a challenge to the behaviorist position that all behavior, including language, is contingent upon learning and reinforcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chomsky 1959&quot;&gt;Chomsky, N.A. (1959) [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/1967----.htm A Review of Skinner's ''Verbal Behavior'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social learning theorist]]s, such as [[Albert Bandura]], argued that the child's environment could make contributions of its own to the behaviors of an observant subject.&lt;ref&gt;Bandura, A. (1973). Aggression: A social learning analysis. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion.svg|thumb|left|200px|The [[MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion]]. Psychologists make inferences about mental processes from shared phenomena such as optical illusions.]]
Meanwhile, accumulating [[technology]] helped to renew interest and belief in the mental states and representationsâi.e., the [[cognition]]âthat had fallen out of favor with behaviorists. English neuroscientist [[Charles Sherrington]] and Canadian psychologist [[Donald O. Hebb]] used experimental methods to link psychological phenomena with the structure and function of the [[human brain|brain]]. With the rise of [[computer science]] and [[artificial intelligence]], analogies were drawn between the processing of information by humans and [[information processing]] by machines. Research in cognition had proven practical since [[World War II]], when it aided in the understanding of weapons operation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aidman 2002 et al.&quot;&gt;Aidman, Eugene, Galanis, George, Manton, Jeremy, Vozzo, Armando and Bonner, Michael (2002) 'Evaluating human systems in military training', ''Australian Journal of Psychology'', 54:3, 168â173&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 20th century, though, [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]] had become the dominant [[paradigm]] of mainstream psychology, and [[cognitive psychology]] emerged as a popular branch.

Assuming both, that the covert mind should be studied and that the scientific method should be used to study it, cognitive psychologists set such concepts as ''[[subliminal message|subliminal processing]]'' and ''[[implicit memory]]'' in place of the psychoanalytic ''unconscious mind'' or the behavioristic ''contingency-shaped behaviors''. Elements of behaviorism and cognitive psychology were synthesized to form the basis of [[cognitive behavioral therapy]], a form of psychotherapy modified from techniques developed by American psychologist [[Albert Ellis (psychologist)|Albert Ellis]] and American psychiatrist [[Aaron T. Beck]]. Cognitive psychology was subsumed along with other disciplines, such as [[philosophy of mind]], computer science, and [[neuroscience]], under the cover discipline of [[cognitive science]].
&lt;!--Needs to be put into better context: Another of the most influential theories from this school of thought was the stages of cognitive development theory proposed by [[Jean Piaget]].--&gt;

===Biopsychosocial model===
{{Main|Biopsychosocial model}}
The biopsychosocial model is an integrated perspective toward understanding consciousness, behavior, and social interaction. It assumes that any given behavior or mental process affects and is affected by dynamically interrelated biological, psychological, and social factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Richard Frankel, Timothy Quill, Susan McDaniel |title=The Biopsychosocial Approach: Past, Present, Future |publisher=Boydell &amp; Brewer |year=2003 |isbn=1580461026, 9781580461023}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''psychological'' aspect refers to the role that cognition and emotions play in any given psychological phenomenonâfor example, the effect of mood or beliefs and expectations on an individual's reactions to an event. The ''biological'' aspect refers to the role of biological factors in psychological phenomenaâfor example, the effect of the prenatal environment on brain development and cognitive abilities, or the influence of genes on individual dispositions. The ''socio-cultural'' aspect refers to the role that social and cultural environments play in a given psychological phenomenonâfor example, the role of parental or peer influence in the behaviors or characteristics of an individual.

Discursive psychology was developed in the 1990s by Jonathan Potter and Derek Edwards. It examines how psychological phenomena are created, made relevant and put to use in discourse, verbal interaction and everyday talk. It is opposed to cognitivist approaches.

===Critical psychology===
{{Main|Critical psychology}}
Critical psychology is aimed at evaluating mainstream psychology and attempts to apply psychology in more progressive ways, often looking towards social change as a means of preventing and treating psychopathology. One of critical psychology's main criticisms of conventional psychology is how it ignores the way power differences between social classes and groups can affect the mental and physical well-being of individuals or groups of people. Contributors to the field include [[Klaus Holzkamp]] and [[Ian Parker (psychologist)|Ian Parker]]. Key elements within critical psychology include the study of power relations, situated knowledge, and the dualisms of the self and the agency, and the individual and the social.

Biological psychology or [[behavioral neuroscience]] is the study of the biological substrates of behavior and mental processes. There are different specialties within behavioral neuroscience. For example, [[physiological psychologist]]s use animal models, typically rats, to study the neural, genetic, and cellular mechanisms that underlie specific behaviors such as learning and memory and fear responses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinel |first=John |title=Biopsychology |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=New York |year=2010 |isbn=0-205-83256-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cognitive neuroscientist]]s investigate the neural correlates of psychological processes in humans using neural imaging tools, and [[neuropsychologist]]s conduct psychological assessments to determine, for instance, specific aspects and extent of cognitive deficit caused by brain damage or disease.

===Clinical===
{{Main|Clinical psychology|Counseling psychology}}
[[Image:Grouptherapy.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Clinical psychologists work with individuals, children, families, couples, or small groups.]]
[[Clinical psychology]] includes the study and application of psychology for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or [[Mental illness|dysfunction]] and to promote subjective [[Mental health|well-being]] and personal development. Central to its practice are psychological assessment and [[psychotherapy]], although clinical psychologists may also engage in research, teaching, consultation, forensic testimony, and program development and administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;brain&quot;&gt;Brain, Christine. (2002). ''Advanced psychology: applications, issues and perspectives.'' Cheltenham: Nelson Thornes. ISBN 0-17-490058-9&lt;/ref&gt; Some clinical psychologists may focus on the clinical management of patients with [[Brain damage|brain injury]]âthis area is known as [[clinical neuropsychology]]. In many countries, clinical psychology is a regulated [[mental health profession]].

The work performed by clinical psychologists tends to be influenced by various therapeutic approaches, all of which involve a formal relationship between professional and client (usually an individual, couple, family, or small group). The various therapeutic approaches and practices are associated with different theoretical perspectives and employ different procedures intended to form a therapeutic alliance, explore the nature of psychological problems, and encourage new ways of thinking, feeling, or behaving. Four major theoretical perspectives are [[psychodynamic psychotherapy|psychodynamic]], [[cognitive behavioral therapy|cognitive behavioral]], [[humanistic psychology|existentialâhumanistic]], and [[family therapy|systems or family therapy]]. There has been a growing movement to integrate the various therapeutic approaches, especially with an increased understanding of issues regarding culture, gender, spirituality, and sexual-orientation. With the advent of more robust research findings regarding psychotherapy, there is evidence that most of the major therapies are about of equal effectiveness, with the key common element being a strong therapeutic alliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Leichsenring, Falk; Leibing, Eric |year=2003 |title=The effectiveness of psychodynamic therapy and cognitive behavior therapy in the treatment of personality disorders: A meta-analysis |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=160 |issue=7 |pages=1223â33 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.7.1223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Reisner, Andrew |year=2005 |title=The common factors, empirically validated treatments, and recovery models of therapeutic change |journal=The Psychological Record |volume=55 |issue=3 |pages=377â400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, more training programs and psychologists are now adopting an [[Integrative Psychotherapy|eclectic therapeutic orientation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Jensen, J.P.; Bergin, A.E.; Greaves, D.W. |year=1990 |title=The meaning of eclecticism: New survey and analysis of components |journal=Professional Psychology: Research and Practice |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=124â30 |doi=10.1037/0735-7028.21.2.124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, S.; Woolfe, R.

Cognitive psychology studies [[cognition]], the [[mental function|mental processes]] underlying mental activity. [[Perception]], [[attention]], [[reasoning]], [[thinking]], [[problem solving]], [[memory]], [[learning]], [[language]] and [[emotion]] are areas of research. Classical cognitive psychology is associated with a school of thought known as [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivism]], whose adherents argue for an [[information processing]] model of mental function, informed by [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]] and [[experimental psychology]].

On a broader level, [[cognitive science]] is an interdisciplinary enterprise of [[cognitive psychologist]]s, [[cognitive neuroscientist]]s, researchers in [[artificial intelligence]], [[linguist]]s, [[humanâcomputer interaction]], [[computational neuroscience]], [[mathematical logic|logicians]] and [[anthropology|social scientists]]. [[Computer simulation|Computational models]] are sometimes used to simulate phenomena of interest. Computational models provide a tool for studying the functional organization of the mind whereas neuroscience provides measures of brain activity.

===Comparative===
[[Image:Chimpanzee and stick.jpg|200px|thumb|left|The common [[chimpanzee]] can use [[tool]]s. This chimpanzee is using a stick in order to get food.]]
{{Main|Comparative psychology}}
Comparative psychology refers to the study of the behavior and mental life of [[animal]]s other than human beings. It is related to disciplines outside of psychology that study animal behavior such as [[ethology]]. Although the field of psychology is primarily concerned with humans, the behavior and mental processes of [[animal]]s is also an important part of psychological research. This being either as a subject in its own right (e.g., [[animal cognition]] and ethology) or with strong emphasis about evolutionary links, and somewhat more controversially, as a way of gaining an insight into human psychology. This is achieved by means of comparison or via animal models of emotional and behavior systems as seen in neuroscience of psychology (e.g., [[affective neuroscience]] and [[social neuroscience]]).
{{clear}}

===Developmental===
[[File:Baby with book.jpg|175px|thumb|right|A baby with a book.]]
{{Main|Developmental psychology}}
Mainly focusing on the development of the human mind through the life span, [[developmental psychology]] seeks to understand how people come to perceive, understand, and act within the world and how these processes change as they age. This may focus on cognitive, affective, [[moral development|moral]], social, or neural development. Researchers who study [[child]]ren use a number of unique research methods to make observations in natural settings or to engage them in experimental tasks. Such tasks often resemble specially designed games and activities that are both enjoyable for the child and scientifically useful, and researchers have even devised clever methods to study the mental processes of small infants. In addition to studying children, developmental psychologists also study [[aging]] and processes throughout the life span, especially at other times of rapid change (such as [[adolescence]] and [[old age]]). Developmental psychologists draw on the full range of psychological theories to inform their research.
{{clear}}

===Educational and school===
[[Image:FiguralRelation.png|right|thumb|250px|An example of an item from a cognitive abilities test used in educational psychology.]]
{{Main|Educational psychology|School psychology}}
Educational psychology is the study of how humans learn in [[education]]al settings, the effectiveness of educational interventions, the psychology of teaching, and the [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] of [[school]]s as organizations. The work of child psychologists such as [[Lev Vygotsky]], [[Jean Piaget]], [[Bernard Luskin]] and [[Jerome Bruner]] has been influential in creating [[teaching]] methods and educational practices. Educational psychology is often included in teacher education programs, in places such as North America, Australia, and New Zealand.

School psychology combines principles from [[educational psychology]] and [[clinical psychology]] to understand and treat students with learning disabilities; to foster the intellectual growth of [[intellectual giftedness|gifted]] students; to facilitate [[prosocial behavior]]s in adolescents; and otherwise to promote safe, supportive, and effective learning environments. School psychologists are trained in educational and behavioral assessment, intervention, prevention, and consultation, and many have extensive training in research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=National Association of School Psychologists |title=Who are school psychologists? |url=http://nasponline.org/about_sp/whatis.aspx |accessdate=June 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary===
{{Main|Evolutionary psychology}}
Evolutionary psychology examines psychological [[trait theory|traits]]âsuch as [[memory]], [[perception]], or [[language]]âfrom a [[evolution|modern evolutionary]] perspective. It seeks to identify which human psychological traits are evolved [[adaptation]]s, that is, the functional products of [[natural selection]] or [[sexual selection]]. Evolutionary psychologists suggest that [[psychological adaptation]]s evolved to solve recurrent problems in human ancestral environments. By focusing on the evolution of psychological traits and their adaptive functions, it offers complementary explanations for the mostly proximate or developmental explanations developed by other areas of psychology (that is, it focuses mostly on ultimate or &quot;why?&quot; questions, rather than proximate or &quot;how?&quot; questions).

===Industrialâorganizational===
{{Main|Industrial and organizational psychology}}
Industrial and organizational psychology (IâO) applies psychological concepts and methods to optimize human potential in the workplace. Personnel psychology, a subfield of IâO psychology, applies the methods and principles of psychology in selecting and evaluating workers. IâO psychology's other subfield, [[organizational psychology]], examines the effects of work environments and management styles on worker motivation, job satisfaction, and productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Myers (2004). Motivation and work. ''Psychology''. New York, NY: Worth Publishers&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personality===
{{Main|Personality psychology}}
[[Personality psychology]] is concerned to enduring patterns of [[behavior]], [[thought]], and [[emotion]] in individuals, commonly referred to as [[wikt:personality|personality]]. Theories of personality vary across different psychological schools and orientations. They carry different assumptions about such issues as the role of the [[Unconscious mind|unconscious]] and the importance of childhood experience. According to Freud, personality is based on the dynamic interactions of the [[id, ego, and super-ego]].&lt;ref&gt;Carver, C., &amp; Scheier, M. (2004). Perspectives on Personality (5th ed.). Boston: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trait theorist]]s, in contrast, attempt to analyze personality in terms of a discrete number of key traits by the statistical method of [[factor analysis]]. The number of proposed traits has varied widely. An early model proposed by [[Hans Eysenck]] suggested that there are three traits that comprise human personality: [[extraversion and introversion|extraversionâintroversion]], [[neuroticism]], and [[psychoticism]]. [[Raymond Cattell]] proposed a theory of [[16 personality factors]]. The &quot;[[Big Five personality traits|Big Five]]&quot;, or Five Factor Model, proposed by [[Lewis Goldberg]], currently has strong support among trait theorists.

===Social===
[[Image:Shibuya tokyo.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[social psychology (psychology)|Social psychology]] studies the nature and causes of social behavior.]]
{{Main|Social psychology (psychology)}}
{{See also|Social psychology|Social psychology (sociology)}}
Social psychology is the study of how humans think about each other and how they relate to each other. Social psychologists study such topics as the influence of others on an individual's behavior (e.g. [[conformity (psychology)|conformity]], [[persuasion]]), and the formation of beliefs, [[attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], and [[stereotype]]s about other people. [[Social cognition]] fuses elements of social and cognitive psychology in order to understand how people process, remember, or distort social information. The study of [[group dynamics]] reveals information about the nature and potential optimization of leadership, communication, and other phenomena that emerge at least at the [[microsociology|microsocial]] level. In recent years, many social psychologists have become increasingly interested in [[Implicit Association Test|implicit]] measures, [[mediation (statistics)|mediational]] models, and the interaction of both person and social variables in accounting for behavior. The study of human society, is therefore a potentially valuable source of information about the causes of psychiatric disorder. Some of the sociological concepts applied to psychiatric disorders are the social role, sick role, social class, life event, culture, migration, social and total institution.&lt;ref&gt; Gelder, Mayou &amp; Geddes (2005). Psychiatry. New York, NY: Oxford University Press Inc. &lt;/ref&gt;

===Positive===
{{Main|Positive psychology}}
Positive psychology derives from [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow's]] [[humanistic psychology]]. Positive psychology is a discipline that utilizes evidence-based scientific methods to study factors that contribute to human [[happiness]] and strength. Different from [[clinical psychology]], positive psychology is concerned with improving the mental well-being of healthy clients. Positive psychological interventions now have received tentative support for their beneficial effects on clients. In 2010 ''Clinical Psychological Review'' published a special issue devoted to positive psychological interventions, such as [[Gratitude journal|gratitude journaling]] and the physical expression of [[gratitude]]. There is, however, a need for further research on the effects of interventions. Positive psychological interventions have been limited in scope but their effects are thought to be superior to that of [[Placebo|placebos]], especially with regard to helping people with [[Body dysmorphic disorder|body image problems]].

==Research methods==
Psychology tends to be [[eclecticism|eclectic]], drawing on knowledge from other fields to help explain and understand psychological phenomena. Additionally, psychologists make extensive use of [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|the three modes of inference]] that were identified by [[C.S. Peirce]]: [[deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[abduction (logic)|abduction]] (hypothesis generation). While often employing [[deductiveânomological]] reasoning, they also rely on [[inductive reasoning]] to generate [[explanation]]s. For example, [[evolutionary psychologist]]s attempt to explain psychological traitsâsuch as memory, perception, or languageâas adaptations, that is, as the functional products of [[natural selection]] or [[sexual selection]].

Psychologists may conduct [[basic research]] aiming for further understanding in a particular area of interest in psychology, or conduct applied research to solve problems in the clinic, workplace or other areas. Masters level clinical programs aim to train students in both research methods and [[evidence-based practice]]. Professional associations have established guidelines for ethics, training, research methodology and professional practice. In addition, depending on the country, state or region, psychological services and the title &quot;psychologist&quot; may be governed by statute and psychologists who offer services to the public are usually required to be licensed.

===Qualitative and quantitative research===
Research in most areas of psychology is conducted in accord with the standards of the [[scientific method]]. Psychological researchers seek the emergence of theoretically interesting categories and hypotheses from data, using [[qualitative research|qualitative]] or [[quantitative research|quantitative]] methods (or both).

[[Qualitative psychological research]] methods include [[interview]]s, first-hand observation, and [[participant observation]]. Creswell (2003) identifies five main possibilities for qualitative research, including narrative, [[Phenomenology (psychology)|phenomenology]], [[ethnography]], [[case study]] and [[grounded theory]]. Qualitative researchers&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, B. &amp; Strauss, A. (1967). ''The discovery of grounded theory: Strategies for qualitative research''. Chicago: Aldine.&lt;/ref&gt; sometimes aim to enrich [[hermeneutics|interpretations]] or [[critical theory|critiques]] of [[symbol]]s, [[subject (philosophy)|subjective]] experiences, or [[social structure]]s. Similar hermeneutic and critical aims have also been served by &quot;quantitative methods&quot;, as in [[Erich Fromm]]'s study of [[Authoritarian personality|Nazi voting]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}&lt;!--(suggesting the authoritarian personality thesis)--&gt; or [[Stanley Milgram]]'s [[Milgram experiment|studies]] of [[obedience to authority]].

[[Quantitative psychological research]] lends itself to the [[statistical]] testing of hypotheses. Quantitatively oriented research designs include the [[experiment]], [[quasi-experiment]], [[cross-sectional study]], [[case-control study]], and [[longitudinal study]]. The measurement and [[operational definition|operationalization]] of important constructs is an essential part of these research designs. Statistical methods include the [[Pearson productâmoment correlation coefficient]], the [[analysis of variance]], [[multiple linear regression]], [[logistic regression]], [[structural equation modeling]], and [[hierarchical linear modeling]].

===Controlled experiments===
{{Main|Experiment}}
[[Image:Flowchart of Phases of Parallel Randomized Trial - Modified from CONSORT 2010.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Flowchart of four phases (enrollment, intervention allocation, follow-up, and data analysis) of a parallel randomized trial of two groups, modified from the [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials|CONSORT 2010 Statement]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulz-2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Schulz, K.F.; Altman, D.G.; Moher, D.; for the CONSORT Group |title=CONSORT 2010 Statement: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials |journal=BMJ |volume=340 |pages=c332 |year=2010 |doi=10.1136/bmj.c332 |pmid=20332509 |pmc=2844940 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/340/mar23_1/c332}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Experimental psychological research is conducted in a laboratory under controlled conditions. This method of research relies on the application of the [[scientific method]] to understand behavior. Experimenters use several types of measurements, including rate of response, [[reaction time]], and various [[psychometric]] measurements. Experiments are designed to [[Hypothesis testing|test]] specific [[hypotheses]] (deductive approach) or evaluate functional relationships (inductive approach). A [[true experiment]] with [[randomized controlled trial|random]] allocation of subjects to conditions allows researchers to infer causal relationships between different aspects of behavior and the environment. In an experiment, one or more variables of interest are controlled by the experimenter (independent variable) and another variable is measured in response to different conditions (dependent variable). Experiments are one of the primary research methods in many areas of psychology, particularly [[cognitive psychology|cognitive]]/[[psychonomics]], [[mathematical psychology]], [[psychophysiology]] and [[biological psychology]]/[[cognitive neuroscience]].

Experiments on humans have been put under some controls, namely informed and voluntary consent. After World War II, the [[Nuremberg Code]] was established, because of Nazi abuses of experimental subjects. Later, most countries (and scientific journals) adopted the [[Declaration of Helsinki]]. In the U.S., the [[National Institutes of Health]] established the [[Institutional Review Board]] in 1966, and in 1974 adopted the [[National Research Act]] (HR 7724). All of these measures encouraged researchers to obtain informed consent from human participants in experimental studies. A number of influential studies led to the establishment of this rule; such studies included the [[MIT]] and Fernald School radioisotope studies, the [[Thalidomide scandal|Thalidomide tragedy]], the Willowbrook [[hepatitis]] study, and [[Stanley Milgram]]'s studies of obedience to authority.

===Survey questionnaires===
{{Main|Statistical survey}}
Statistical surveys are used in psychology for measuring attitudes and traits, monitoring changes in mood, checking the validity of experimental manipulations, and for a wide variety of other psychological topics. Most commonly, psychologists use paper-and-pencil surveys. However, surveys are also conducted over the phone or through e-mail. Increasingly, web-based surveys are being used in research. Similar methodology is also used in applied setting, such as clinical assessment and personnel assessment.

===Longitudinal studies===
[[Longitudinal studies]] are often used in psychology to study developmental trends across the life span, and in sociology to study life events throughout lifetimes or generations. The reason for this is that unlike [[cross-sectional studies]], longitudinal studies track the same people, and therefore the differences observed in those people are less likely to be the result of cultural differences across generations. Because of this benefit, longitudinal studies make observing changes more accurate and they are applied in various other fields.

Because most longitudinal studies are observational, in the sense that they observe the state of the world without manipulating it, it has been argued that they may have less power to detect causal relationships than do experiments. They also suffer methodological limitations such as from selective attrition because people with similar characteristics may be more likely to drop out of the study making it difficult to analyze.

Some longitudinal studies are [[experiments]], called [[repeated-measures experiment]]s. Psychologists often use the [[crossover study|crossover design]] to reduce the influence of [[confounding]] [[covariate]]s and to [[efficiency (statistics)|reduce the number of subjects]].

===Observation in natural settings===
[[Image:Phineas gage - 1868 skull diagram.jpg|right|thumb|[[Phineas P. Gage]] survived an accident in which a large iron rod was driven completely through his head, destroying much of his brain's left frontal lobe, and is remembered for that injury's reported effects on his personality and behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[[Phineas Gage#References|Harlow (1868)]], Fig. 2, p. 347 Harlow, John Martyn (1868). &quot;Recovery from the Passage of an Iron Bar through the Head.&quot; Publications of the Massachusetts Medical Society 2:327â347 (Republished in Macmillan 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;]]
{{Main|Naturalistic observation}}
In the same way [[Jane Goodall]] studied the role of [[chimpanzee]] social and family life, psychologists conduct similar observational studies in human social, professional and family lives. Sometimes the participants are aware they are being observed and other times it is covert: the participants do not know they are being observed. Ethical guidelines need to be taken into consideration when covert observation is being carried out.

===Qualitative and descriptive research===
[[Image:MultiLayerNeuralNetwork english.png|thumb|150px|[[Artificial neural network]] with two layers, an interconnected group of nodes, akin to the vast network of neurons in the human brain.]]
{{Main|Qualitative research}}
Research designed to answer questions about the current state of affairs such as the thoughts, feelings and behaviors of individuals is known as descriptive research. Descriptive research can be qualitative or quantitative in orientation. Qualitative research is descriptive research that is focused on observing and describing events as they occur, with the goal of capturing all of the richness of everyday behavior and with the hope of discovering and understanding phenomena that might have been missed if only more cursory examinations have been made.

===Neuropsychological methods===
[[Image:MorrisWaterMaze.jpg|175px|right|thumb|A rat undergoing a [[Morris water navigation test]] used in [[behavioral neuroscience]] to study the role of the [[hippocampus]] in [[spatial learning]] and memory.]]
{{Main|Neuropsychology}}
Neuropsychology seeks to connect aspects of behavior and mental activity with the structure and function of the [[human brain|brain]]. [[Cognitive neuropsychology]] and [[cognitive neuropsychiatry]] study neurological or mental impairment in an attempt to infer theories of normal mind and brain function. This typically involves looking for differences in patterns of remaining ability (known as &quot;functional disassociations&quot;) which can give clues as to whether abilities are composed of smaller functions, or are controlled by a single cognitive mechanism.

In addition, experimental techniques are often used to study the neuropsychology of healthy individuals. These include behavioral experiments, brain-scanning or [[functional neuroimaging]], used to examine the activity of the brain during task performance, and techniques such as [[transcranial magnetic stimulation]], which can safely alter the function of small brain areas to reveal their importance in mental operations.

===Computational modeling===
[[Image:Milgram Experiment v2.png|right|thumb|200px|The experimenter (E) orders the teacher (T), the subject of the experiment, to give what the latter believes are painful electric shocks to a learner (L), who is actually an actor and [[wikt:confederate|confederate]]. The subject believes that for each wrong answer, the learner was receiving actual electric shocks, though in reality there were no such punishments. Being separated from the subject, the confederate set up a tape recorder integrated with the electro-shock generator, which played pre-recorded sounds for each shock level etc.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy&gt;{{cite journal |last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |pages=371â78 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 |issue=4}} [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf Full-text PDF.]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Computer simulation|Computational modeling]]&lt;ref&gt;Ron Sun, (2008). The Cambridge Handbook of Computational Psychology. Cambridge University Press, New York. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tool often used in [[mathematical psychology]] and [[cognitive psychology]] to simulate a particular behavior using a computer. This method has several advantages. Since modern computers process extremely quickly, many simulations can be run in a short time, allowing for a great deal of statistical power. Modeling also allows psychologists to visualize hypotheses about the functional organization of mental events that couldn't be directly observed in a human.

Several different types of modeling are used to study behavior. [[Connectionism]] uses [[neural network]]s to simulate the brain. Another method is symbolic modeling, which represents many different mental objects using variables and rules. Other types of modeling include [[dynamic systems]] and [[stochastic process|stochastic]] modeling.

===Animal studies===
Animal learning experiments aid in investigating the biological basis of teaching, memory and behavior. In the 1890s, Russian physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] famously used dogs to demonstrate [[classical conditioning]]. [[Animal testing on non-human primates|Non-human primates]], cats, dogs, pigeons, [[laboratory rat|rats]] and other [[Animal testing on rodents|rodents]] are often used in psychological experiments. Ideally, controlled experiments introduce only one [[independent variable]] at a time, in order to ascertain its unique effects upon dependent variables. These conditions are approximated best in laboratory settings. In contrast, human environments and genetic backgrounds vary so widely, and depend upon so many factors, that it is difficult to control important variables for human subjects. Of course, there are pitfalls in generalizing findings from animal studies to humans although animal models can be helpful in developing an understanding of human behavior (e.g., addiction research).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ncabr.org/biomed/FAQ_animal/faq_animal_8.html |title=Ncabr.Org: About Biomedical Research: Faq |accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
===Theory===
Criticisms of psychological research often come from perceptions that it is a &quot;soft&quot; science. Philosopher of science [[Thomas Kuhn]]'s 1962 critique&lt;ref&gt;T.S. Kuhn, ''The Structure of Scientific Revolutions'', 1st. ed., Chicago: Univ. of Chicago Pr., 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; implied psychology overall was in a pre-paradigm state, lacking the agreement on overarching theory found in mature sciences such as [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. 

Because some areas of psychology rely on research methods such as surveys and [[questionnaire]]s, critics have asserted that psychology is not an objective science. Other phenomena that psychologists are interested in, such as [[personality psychology|personality]], [[thinking]], and [[emotion]], cannot be directly measured&lt;ref name=&quot;Panksepp_AN&quot;&gt;[[Jaak Panksepp|Panksepp, J.]] (1998).

Misuses of [[statistical hypothesis testing|hypothesis-testing]] in psychology, and the use of hypothesis testing at all is [[statistical hypothesis testing#Criticism|controversial]].  Research{{Which?|date=June 2010}} has documented that many psychologists confuse [[statistical significance]] with [[effect size|practical importance]]. Statistically significant but practically unimportant results are common with large samples.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, J. (1994). [http://www.ics.uci.edu/~sternh/courses/210/cohen94_pval.pdf The Earth is round, p &lt; .05], ''American Psychologist'', 49, 997â1003.&lt;/ref&gt; Some psychologists have responded with an increased use of [[effect size]] statistics, rather than sole reliance on the [[Ronald A. Fisher|Fisherian]] [[P value|''p'' &lt; .05]] [[statistical significance|significance]] criterion (whereby an observed difference is deemed &quot;[[statistically significant]]&quot; if an effect of that size or larger would occur with 5% (or less) [[frequency probability|probability]] in [[independence (probability theory)|independent]] [[replication (statistics)|replications]], assuming the truth of the [[null-hypothesis]] of no difference between the treatments).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Sometimes the debate comes from within psychology, for example between laboratory-oriented researchers and practitioners such as clinicians. In recent years, and particularly in the U.S., there has been increasing [[scientific debate|debate]] about the nature of therapeutic effectiveness and about the relevance of empirically examining psychotherapeutic strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Elliot Robert |year=1998 |title=Editor's Introduction: A Guide to the Empirically Supported Treatments Controversy |journal=Psychotherapy Research |volume=8 |issue=2 |page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Practice===
Some observers perceive a gap between scientific theory and its applicationâin particular, the application of unsupported or unsound clinical practices.&lt;ref name=Cards&gt;{{cite book |last=Dawes |first=Robyn |title=House of Cards â Psychology and Psychotherapy Built on Myth |year=1994 |publisher=Free Press |isbn=978-0029072059 |url=http://www.amazon.com/House-Cards-Psychology-Psychotherapy-Built/dp/0029072050}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics say there has been an increase in the number of mental health training programs that do not instill scientific competence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beyerstein2001&quot;&gt;Beyerstein, B.L. (2001). Fringe psychotherapies: The public at risk. The Scientific Re-view of Alternative Medicine, 5, 70â79&lt;/ref&gt; One skeptic asserts that practices, such as &quot;[[facilitated communication]] for infantile autism&quot;; memory-recovery techniques including [[Bodywork (alternative medicine)|body work]]; and other therapies, such as [[Rebirthing-breathwork|rebirthing]] and [[reparenting]], may be dubious or even dangerous, despite their popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.srmhp.org/0101/raison-detre.html |title=SRMHP: Our Raison d'Ãtre |accessdate=2008-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984, Allen Neuringer had made a similar point{{Vague|date=October 2009}} regarding the experimental analysis of behavior.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1348111 Neuringer, A.: &quot;Melioration and Self-Experimentation&quot; ''Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Board''] in 1966, and in 1974 ad&lt;/ref&gt;

Current ethical standards of psychology would not permit the following studies to be conducted today. These human studies would violate the [[Human subject research#APA Ethics Code|Ethics Code of the American Psychological Association]], the Canadian Code of Conduct for Research Involving Humans, and the [[Belmont Report]]. Current ethical guidelines state that using non-human animals for scientific purposes is only acceptable when the harm (physical or psychological) done to animals is outweighed by the benefits of the research.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwin, C.M.; Christionsen, S.B.; Duncan, I.J.; Erhard, H.W.; Lay Jr., D.C.; Mench, J.A.; O'Connor, C.E.; &amp; Petherick, J.C. (2003). Guidelines for the Ethical use of animals in the applied ethology studies. Applied Animal Behaviour Science, 81, 291â305.&lt;/ref&gt; Keeping this in mind, psychologists can use on animals research techniques that would not necessarily be performed on humans.

* An [[Milgram Experiment|experiment]] by [[Stanley Milgram]] raised questions about the [[ethics]] of scientific experimentation because of the extreme emotional sf Counselling Psychology'' (R. Wts. It measured the willingness of study participants to obey an authority figure who instructed them to perform acts that conflicted with their personal conscience.&lt;ref&gt;Milgram, Stanley. (1974), Obedience to Authority; An Experimental View. Harpercollins (ISBN 0-06-131983-X).&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Harry Harlow]] drew condemnation for his &quot;pit of despair&quot; experiments on [[rhesus macaque]] monkeys at the [[University of WisconsinâMadison]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Blum 1994, p. 95, Blum 2002, pp. 218â19. Blum 1994, p. 95: &quot;... the most controversial experiment to come out of the Wisconsin laboratory, a device that Harlow insisted on calling the 'pit of despair.{{'&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the research was to produce an animal model of [[major depressive disorder|clinical depression]]. Harlow also devised what he called a &quot;rape rack&quot;, to which the female isolates were tied in normal monkey mating posture.&lt;ref&gt;Blum, Deborah. Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection. Perseus Publishing, 2002. ISBN 0-7382-0278-9&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, American literary critic [[Wayne C. Booth]] wrote that, &quot;Harry Harlow and his colleagues go on torturing their nonhuman primates decade after decade, invariably proving what we all knew in advanceâthat social creatures can be destroyed by destroying their social ties.&quot; He writes that Harlow made no mention of the criticism of the morality of his work.&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Wayne C. ''Modern Dogma and the Rhetoric of Assent'', Volume 5, of University of Notre Dame, Ward-Phillips lectures in English language and literature, University of Chicago Press, 1974, p. 114. Booth is explicitly discussing this experiment. His next sentence is, &quot;His most recent outrage consists of placing monkeys in 'solitary' for twenty daysâwhat he calls a 'vertical chamber apparatus ... designed on an intuitive basis' to produce 'a state of helplessness and hopelessness, sunken in a well of despair.{{'&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

University psychology departments have ethics committees dedicated to the rights and well-being of research subjects. Researchers in psychology must gain approval of their research projects before conducting any experiment to protect the interests of human participants and laboratory animals.&lt;ref&gt;The American Psychological Society: [http://www.apa.org/research/responsible/index.aspx Responsible Conduct of Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systemic bias===
In 1959 statistician Theodore Sterling examined the results of psychological studies and discovered that 97% of them supported their initial hypotheses, implying a possible [[publication bias]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Theodore&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Arjo Klamer, Robert M.

Fanelli argues that this is because of researchers in &quot;softer&quot; sciences have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases.

In 2010, a group of researchers reported a systemic bias in psychology studies towards WEIRD (&quot;western, educated, industrialized, rich and democratic&quot;) subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2010-14802-001 The WEIRDest people in the world?] Henrich, J., Heine, S., &amp; Norenzayan, A. (2011). [[Behavioral and Brain Sciences]], 33, 61-135.&lt;/ref&gt; Although only 1/8 people worldwide fall into the WEIRD classification, the researchers claimed that 60â90% of psychology studies are performed on WEIRD subjects. The article gave examples of results that differ significantly between WEIRD subjects and tribal cultures, including the [[MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion]].

==Notes==
* {{note|reference_name_A|a}}Although [[psychoanalysis]] and other forms of depth psychology are most typically associated with the unconscious mind, [[behaviorist]]s consider such phenomena as [[classical conditioning]] and [[operant conditioning]], while [[cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] explore [[implicit memory]], [[automaticity]], and [[subliminal message]]s, all of which are understood either to bypass or to occur outside of conscious effort or attention. Indeed, [[cognitive-behavioral therapist]]s counsel their clients to become aware of maladaptive thought patterns, the nature of which the clients previously had not been conscious.
* {{note|reference_name_B|b}}Among these schools are [[ego psychology]], [[object relations]], and [[interpersonal psychoanalysis|interpersonal]], [[Jacques Lacan|Lacanian]], and [[relational psychoanalysis]]. Modification of Jung's theories led to the [[archetypal psychology|archetypal]] and [[Process Oriented Psychology|process-oriented]] schools.
