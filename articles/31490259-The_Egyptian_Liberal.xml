The '''2011 Kurdish protests in Turkey''' are ongoing protests by members of [[Republic of Turkey|Turkey]]'s [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] minority to demonstrate against restrictions of their rights by the Turkish authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110420-one-killed-kurdish-protests-turkey-politician |title=One killed in Kurdish protests in Turkey: politician |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date= |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although they are the latest in a [[Kurdish rebellions|long series]] of [[Serhildan|protest actions]] by [[Kurds in Turkey]], they are strongly influenced by the concurrent [[2010-2011 Middle East and North Africa protests|popular protests]] throughout the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/22/world/europe/22kurds.html?_r=1|agency=The New York Times|title=Kurds Renew Their Movement for Rights and Respect in Turkey|first=Landon|last=Thomas|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Alexander|last=Christie-Miller|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/63347|title=Turkey Drops Ban on Kurdish-Backed Candidates|agency=EurasiaNet}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/columnistDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=240580&amp;columnistId=110|agency=Zaman|date=9 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=DiyarbakÄ±r and LefkoÅa|first=Ergun|last=Babahan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.anarkismo.net/article/19377|title=Sinan ÃiftyÃ¼rek on the Arab Spring: &quot;the relation politics/streets has been re-forged&quot;|agency=Anarkismo|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=1 May 2011|first=JosÃ© Antonio|last=GutiÃ©rrez D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Turkish publication ''[[HÃ¼rriyet Daily News]]'' has suggested that the popularly dubbed &quot;Arab Spring&quot; that has seen revolutions in [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]] and [[Tunisian Revolution|Tunisia]] may lead to a &quot;Kurdish Summer&quot; in the northern reaches of the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=the-arab-spring-the-kurdish-summer-2011-04-11|agency=HÃ¼rriyet Daily News|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=The Arab Spring, the Kurdish Summer|first=Kadri|last=GÃ¼rsel}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters have taken to the streets both in [[Ä°stanbul]] and in [[southeast Turkey]], with some demonstrations also reported as far west in [[Anatolia]] as [[Ä°zmir]].

From March 24 and May 10, a total of 2 protesters were killed, 308 injured and 2,506 detained by Turkish authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;casualties&quot;/&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Kurdish-inhabited area by CIA (1992).jpg|thumb|350px|right|Map of Kurdish populated territory. Kurdish protests also took place in [[2011 Iraqi protests|Iraq]], [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syria]], and [[2011 Iranian protests|Iran]] in early 2011.]]

There are currently 14 to 20 million [[Kurds in Turkey]], living predominantly in the southeast of the country.  The Kurdish people are a unique ethnic group with their own language and customs. In Turkey, the Kurdish uprising dates back to at least 1925, but the most recent [[Turkey â Kurdistan Workers' Party conflict|major rebellion]] started in 1978 and has crossed the border into adjacent [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] on a number of occasions. Over 3,000 Kurdish villages have been &quot;evacuated&quot; by the Turkish armed forces since the conflict began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyouth.com/archives/middleeast/us_nato_hypocrisy_exposed_as_tur.html |title=US/NATO Hypocrisy Exposed as Turkey Attacks Kurds |publisher=Newyouth.com |date=1999-04-21 |accessdate=2011-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK), a Kurdish separatist group listed as a [[terrorist organization]] by the governments of Turkey and the [[United States]], demands autonomy for [[Turkish Kurdistan]]. It has also called upon Turkish authorities to release Kurdish prisoners and detainees, overturn a ban on [[Kurdish language|Kurdish-language]] education, and cease military action against Kurdish groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekurd1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2011/3/turkey3163.htm|agency=Kurd Net|date=24 March 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Turkey's Kurds launch protest movement for rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan]] launched a &quot;Kurdish initative&quot; aiming to broaden cultural rights for Kurds, but many Kurdish protesters have said this does not go far enough.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011228162351651625.html Kurdish rebels end Turkey 'truce' - Middle East - Al Jazeera English&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 February 2011, the PKK announced an end to a unilateral ceasefire it had declared in August 2010, prompting ErdoÄan to comment on the pro-Kurdish [[Peace and Democracy Party]] (BDP) over its alleged collusion with the militant group. &quot;A political party that is in Parliament hurling out threats ... during every election period puts pressure on people who want to exercise their democratic will and serves no other purpose,&quot; the prime minister said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.am/eng/news/50001.html|agency=NEWS.am|date=3 March 2011|accessdate=28 April 2011|title=PKK ceasefire end seen as step to help âPeace and Democracyâ Party in elections}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Censorship===
[[Internet]] [[Internet censorship|censorship]] is practiced by the government of Turkey. A number of websites, including those of pro-Kurdish and alternative news outlets such as [[Voice of America]], [[Bianet]], and ''[[Azadiya Welat]]'', are subject to a filter imposed by the [[Turkish Council of State]]. Bianet reported that according to new regulations adopted by the government in late February, this filter will be expanded from blocking access to certain websites from [[Internet cafÃ©]]s to affect all Internet access points and [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s in Turkey sometime in the near future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/english/freedom-of-expression/129279-internet-should-not-become-the-voice-of-ankara|agency=Bianet|date=15 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Internet Should not Become the &quot;Voice of Ankara&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 March 2011, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported a turnout of &quot;thousands&quot; for a march in [[Ä°stanbul]] protesting [[censorship]] of the press and the arrest of over a dozen journalists by Turkish authorities since the start of the month. The Turkish media advocacy group [[Freedom to Journalists Platform]] said Turkey held 68 journalists as of mid-March, including many on charges of &quot;inciting public hatred&quot; and similar offenses, though the government maintains only 27 journalists are incarcerated on unrelated charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/14/world/asia/14turkey.html|agency=The New York Times|date=13 March 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011|title=In Turkey, Thousands Protest a Crackdown on Press Freedom|first=Sebnem|last=Arsu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===March===
====24 March====
In a statement published online on 24 March, the [[Peace and Democracy Party]] (BDP) announced the immediate beginning of a [[civil disobedience]] campaign, beginning with a strike and [[sit-in]] in [[DiyarbakÄ±r]], the largest city in the Kurdish region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kurdish-info.eu/News-sid-URGENT-STATEMENT-from-Peace-and-Democracy-Party-BDP-16544.html|agency=Kurdish Info|date=24 March 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=URGENT STATEMENT from Peace and Democracy Party - BDP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government responded by deploying soldiers and [[Turkish Army|Army]] vehicles to break up the unsanctioned demonstration, which drew about 3,000 participants. Just a fraction of these participantsâa few dozen [[member of parliament|MP]]s and Kurdish city officials, including the mayor of DiyarbakÄ±râwere permitted to proceed to the sit-in venue, while thousands more demonstrators thronged outside and shouted angry slogans. Police clashed with demonstrators, some of whom attempted to attack officers with [[firework]]s, and detained five. A similar scene erupted in [[Batman, Turkey|Batman]], where a larger number of protesters were reportedly detained and protest tents were forcibly taken down.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekurd1&quot;/&gt;

====27 March====
Demonstrations spread to [[Ä°stanbul]], [[Ä°zmir]], [[Silopi]], and [[Antalya]] by 27 March. Protest camps also sprang up in [[Dersim]], [[MuÅ]], [[Van, Turkey|Van]], and [[AÄrÄ±]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aknews.com/en/aknews/3/227805/|agency=Kurdistan News Agency|title=Kurdish civil rebellion continues in Turkey|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=27 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several dozen protesters were arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dawn.com/2011/03/27/turkey%E2%80%99s-kurds-begin-civil-disobedience-campaign.html|agency=Dawn|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|first=Suzan|last=Fraser|title=Turkeyâs Kurds begin âcivil disobedienceâ campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protest leader and MP [[Selahattin DemirtaÅ]] said that the [[Peace and Democracy Party]] was determined to carry out civil disobedience actions across the Kurdish region and condemned the governor of [[DiyarbakÄ±r Province]] for declaring the protests unlawful. Fellow Kurdish leader [[Ahmet TÃ¼rk]] said they will continue the sit-in action despite the pressure from the Turkish authorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ekurd1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RudawinEng&quot;/&gt; &quot;The prime minister who sends greetings to [[Tahrir Square]] while sending tanks and gas bombs at us should know that the [Kurdish] people have been seeking their freedom in their [own] Tahrir Squares,&quot; said DemirtaÅ, referring to Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan]] and his [[International reactions to the 2011 Egyptian revolution|favorable stance]] toward [[Egypt]]ian [[2011 Egyptian revolution|revolutionaries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawn&quot;/&gt;

====28 March====
About 40,000 people marched to the alleged site of [[mass grave]]s of Kurds in [[Siirt Province]] on 28 March. The [[protest march]] spun off into [[riot]]ing in the province. In Batman and DiyarbakÄ±r, two of the original sites of protests as part of the civil disobedience campaign, media reported Turkish security forces detained several more protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/features/setimes/features/2011/03/31/feature-03|agency=Southeast European Times|date=31 March 2011|accessdate=28 April 2011|title=Kurdish civil disobedience continues in Turkey|first=Alina|last=Lehtinen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===April===
====6 April====
DemirtaÅ ratcheted up the civil disobedience campaign by Kurdish protesters on 6 April by accusing imams sent by the government to lead prayers in Turkey's [[southeast Turkey|southeast]] of supporting and spying for the ruling [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]] and urging Kurds not to pray behind them. DemirtaÅ also said that sermons in Kurdish parts of the country should only be given in [[Kurdish language|Kurdish]], a policy ErdoÄan opposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=240380|agency=Zaman|date=7 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=BDP calls on Kurds not to pray behind state imams in mosques}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====8 April====
At Friday prayers in DiyarbakÄ±r on 8 April, a number of Kurds boycotted in solidarity with the BDP, with many holding signs and banners supporting DemirtaÅ and the protests as others prayed. At least one newspaper ran photographs of the boycott.&lt;ref name=&quot;militantimams&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sundayszaman.com/sunday/newsDetail_getNewsById.action?newsId=240785|date=12 April 2011|title=PKK planning to disturb social peace in East, Southeast with âmilitant imamsâ|agency=Zaman|accessdate=27 April 2011|first=Hasim|last=Soylemez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====11 April====
On 11 April, the conservative Turkish weekly ''[[Aksiyon]]'' published allegations that &quot;militant imams&quot; loyal to the [[Kurdistan Workers' Party|PKK]] intend to promote [[terrorism]] among Kurds by portraying PKK fighters killed in clashes with government forces as [[martyr]]s. According to the report, imprisoned PKK leader [[Abdullah Ãcalan]] devised the plan from behind bars. It also alleged that the banned PKK is using the BDP as a political front.&lt;ref name=&quot;militantimams&quot;/&gt;

====19 April====
On 19 April, Turkeyâs elections board ruled that 12 Kurdish politicians who had registered as independent candidates were barred from running in the June [[Turkish general election, 2011|parliamentary elections]]. The politicians included [[Leyla Zana]], who has spent ten years in prison for alleged PKK membership despite a ruling by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] that her imprisonment violated [[freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2011/4/turkey3189.htm Leyla Zana and 11 other Kurdish politicians barred from running for Turkish parliament&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurds angry over the ban rallied in [[HakkÃ¢ri]], [[ÅÄ±rnak]], Ä°stanbul, Van, and DiyarbakÄ±r. More than 2,000 protesters gathered in [[Taksim Square]] on the [[Europe]]an side of Ä°stanbul, Turkey's largest city.&lt;ref name=&quot;IstanbulXinhua&quot;/&gt; Police used [[tear gas]] to disperse the protest, which reportedly injured several, including at least one police officer. Shopkeepers and workers went on strike in HakkÃ¢ri and Van. Van also saw clashes between protesters and Turkish [[gendarmarie|gendarme]]s, with its Kurdish mayor being among the demonstrators injured in the fighting, and scuffles were also reported in DiyarbakÄ±r, where a 15-year-old boy was reportedly hospitalized after being shot and injured by police. The semi-official [[Anatolian Agency]] claimed significant property damage in the city of DiyarbakÄ±r and said police confiscated several [[Molotov cocktail]]s brought to the demonstration by Kurdish protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-04/20/c_13836524.htm|agency=Xinhua|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Turkey sees protests against candidate ban}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====20 April====
On 20 April, police fired live rounds at protesters in [[Bismil]]. One protester was killed, four were injured, and at  least 16 were arrested. The incident drew outrage from the Kurdish community, with Selahattin DemirtaÅ canceling a planned meeting with President [[Abdullah GÃ¼l]] in [[Ankara]] over the shooting.&lt;ref name=&quot;KurdDead&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/04/2011420204329820606.html |title=Kurdish Protester Killed in Turkey Clash}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====21 April====
The elections board reversed its decision to bar several Kurdish political candidates on 21 April after facing massive outcry. Some journalists expected this to be the end of intensified protests and rioting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.boston.com/2011-04-21/news/29460234_1_kurdish-rebels-pro-kurdish-leyla-zana | title=Turkey: Kurdish candidates can run for parliament - Boston.com}} {{Dead link|date=June 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, the Anatolian Agency reported that one police officer and two civilians were injured in rioting in Batman on the same day. The semi-official news agency alleged that Kurdish protesters attacked police with rocks, firebombs, and gunfire. It also said three people were hospitalized in [[Van Province]] after Kurdish demonstrators set fire to a bank with a Molotov cocktail. Police reportedly employed [[tear gas]] and [[water cannon]]s to disperse the riot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90777/90854/7358720.html|agency=People's Daily Online|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=One policeman, two civilians injured in Kurdish protests in Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====23 April====
According to a report in the pro-government daily ''[[Zaman]]'', alleged PKK supporters threw Molotov cocktails at a house in suburban [[ÅanlÄ±urfa]] while a family was sleeping there on the night of 23 April, seriously damaging the property but causing only minor injuries. Police detained two in connection with the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Children narrowly escape death in Molotov cocktail attack|first=Fethi|last=Altun|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-241926-children-narrowly-escape-death-in-molotov-cocktail-attack.html|agency=Zaman|date=25 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====24 April====
''Zaman'' claimed pro-[[Peace and Democracy Party|BDP]] protesters in [[Ergani]] attacked buildings and gendarmes with Molotov cocktails and [[firecracker]]s. It also reported that 32 rioters in Batman were detained after a crowd of demonstrators pelted police with stones and tried to set fire to shops.&lt;ref name=&quot;YSKrev&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-242054-demonstrators-continue-protesting-despite-ysk-reversal.html|agency=Zaman|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Demonstrators continue protesting despite YSK reversal}}&lt;/ref&gt; These demonstrations came just days after international media reported an easing of tensions in southeast Turkey following the reversal of a ban on several Kurdish parliamentary candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110422-kurdish-protests-calm-down-southeast-turkey|agency=France24|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Kurdish protests calm down in southeast Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anatolian Agency reported that two off-duty soldiers, wearing civilian clothes, were shot from behind in [[YÃ¼ksekova]], leaving both injured. It also claimed rioting, including stone- and firebomb-throwing, in Bismil, which police reportedly used tear gas and water cannon to disperse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Kurd Net|title=Off-duty soldiers attacked in southeast Turkey|date=25 April 2011|accessdate=28 April 2011|url=http://www.ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2011/4/turkey3197.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====25 April====
In the early morning of 25 April, police raided and dismantled numerous &quot;democratic solution&quot; tents and arrested protesters in 17 provinces across Turkey, [[Bianet]] reported. One MP was reportedly injured in a scuffle with police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/english/freedom-of-expression/129566-mass-crackdowns-on-democratic-solution-tents|agency=Bianet|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=30 April 2011|title=Mass Crackdowns on 'Democratic Solution Tents'|first=AyÃ§a|last=Soylemez}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BDP supporters protested violently in the [[Aksaray, Istanbul|Aksaray]] neighborhood of Ä°stanbul, attacking police, vehicles, and shops, ''Zaman'' alleged.&lt;ref name=&quot;YSKrev&quot;/&gt; Turkish authorities also arrested 35 in HakkÃ¢ri on alleged PKK ties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianet&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bianet.org/english/human-rights/129539-35-people-in-custody-tens-of-thousands-of-people-protest|agency=Bianet|title=35 People in Custody, Tens of Thousands of People Protest|date=26 April 2011|first=Nilay|last=Vardar|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianet&quot;/&gt; In response, more than 20,000 Kurds living near the international border with [[Iraq]] marched to a border crossing and threatened to enter [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in a show of defiance unless the 35 were released, forcing Peace and Democracy Party officials to intervene. The protesters eventually returned to their homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.firatnews.com/english/index.php?rupel=article&amp;nuceID=2047|agency=Firat News Agency|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=HakkÃ¢ri to protest today against detentions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=election-cannot-take-place-under-current-circumstances-says-bdp-2011-04-26|agency=Hurriyet Daily News|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Election impossible in current situation, says Turkey's pro-Kurdish party|first=Goksel|last=Bozkurt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====26 April====
On 26 April, about 20,000 in southeast Turkey reportedly turned out to protest the detention of alleged PKK supporters in HakkÃ¢ri, according to media. About 10,000 protesters set off on a march from HakkÃ¢ri to Van, according to Kurdish officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bianet&quot;/&gt;

Police detained 17 in [[Manisa]]'s Kurdish quarter and tore down BDP-backed &quot;democratic solution&quot; tents and protest camps in [[Tunceli]], Manisa, Ä°zmir, Mardin, and ÅÄ±rnak. Authorities said they were searching for Molotov cocktails and took down tents where they purportedly found the makeshift firebombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=kurdish-politicians8217-trial-at-southeastern-turkey-tied-up-in-gordian-knot-2011-04-27|agency=Hurriyet Daily News|date=27 April 2011|accessdate=29 April 2011|title=Defense lawyers boycott KCK trial in Turkey|first=Ãzgur|last=Ãgret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===June===
====26 June====
Pro-Kurdish protesters turned out in [[Istanbul]], marching to a major mosque to protest a ruling by the Turkish board of elections disqualifying [[Hatip Dicle]] of BDP from his seat in Parliament. Several candidates elected on the BDP slate were stripped of office over the weekend, some of them because the board determined that they could not hold office while imprisoned. Protesters claim the removed MPs are [[political prisoner]]s and that Turkish authorities are denying Kurds their elected representation. The ruling AK Party picked up several additional seats in Parliament due to the disqualifications, compounding Kurdish anger. Riot police assembled in Istanbul to block the protest march, firing tear gas. [[Al Jazeera]] reported that only after the tear gas was deployed did protesters become violent, assaulting officers with stones and metal poles, but police succeeded in dispersing the demonstration. No serious injuries were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/06/2011626214739144330.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|date=27 June 2011|accessdate=27 June 2011|title=Turkey police disperse pro-Kurdish protesters}}&lt;/ref&gt;
