The '''Honam High Speed Railway''' (Honam HSR) is an in-construction [[High-speed rail|high-speed railway]] between Osong (on the existing [[Gyeongbu High Speed Railway]]) and [[Mokpo]] in [[South Korea]]. The line will become part of [[Korail]]'s [[Korea Train Express]] (KTX) system, accelerating Seoul-Mokpo and Seoul-[[Gwangju]] KTX high-speed services which presently use the existing conventional [[Honam Line]].

==History==

===Origins of the project===

The most progressed plans for a second high-speed line were for the Honam High Speed Railway, a connection from Seoul to [[Mokpo]] in southwest Korea, accelerating the service on the existing route that was eventually established in KTX's first phase.

The first feasibility study in 2003 came to the conclusion that the construction of a full line is not justified by demand, and proposed a two-stage construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamplans&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |first=Il-Ho |last=Chung |title=Plan for Honam High-Speed Railway |journal=Space and Environment |volume=25 |month=July |year=2006 |pages=6â8 |publisher=Korean Research Institute for Human Settlements |url=http://168.126.177.50/pub/docu/en/AD/BE/ADBE2006BAC/ADBE-2006-BAC-003.PDF |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first stage, to be realised by 2015, would involve a connection from a second Seoul terminus in the southeast part of the city to the Gyeongbu HSR, and a branch from the Gyeongbu HSR to [[Iksan]], paralleling the existing Honam Line.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamplans&quot;/&gt;  The second phase, to be realised by 2020, would include the separate tracks on the section paralleling the Gyeongbu Line, and the extension from Iksan to [[Gwangju]] and Mokpo, paralleling the existing Honam Line.  The cost of the entire project was estimated at 10,378.6 billion won.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamplans&quot;/&gt;

On January 14, 2005, Prime Minister [[Lee Hae Chan]] met local representatives in Gwangju, who requested an early implementation of the project. Lee pointed to the failure of the first phase of the KTX in meeting ridership forecasts during its first months, expressed skepticism regarding the profitability of the Honam HSR, and described it as a long-term project.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamno&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.moodeungilbo.co.kr/read.php3?no=155335&amp;read_temp=20050115&amp;section=1 |title=í¸ë¨ê³ ìì ì²  ì¡°ê¸°ì°©ê³µ ì´ë ¤ìì§ë |language=[[Korean language|Korean]] |date=2005-01-15 |publisher=Moodeung Ilbo |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:HF9axZrX4ggJ:www.moodeungilbo.co.kr/read.php3%3Fno%3D155335%26read_temp%3D20050115%26section%3D1&amp;strip=1 |archivedate=2010-08-09 |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in December the same year, in the light of low approval in the affected provinces, the government reversed its stance and agreed to complete the project to Gwangju by 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamyes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.investkorea.org/InvestKoreaWar/work/ik/eng/bo/region_pr_view.jsp?&amp;no=608300004&amp;bno=512087013&amp;sort_num=236&amp;l_unit=90202&amp;m_unit=90306&amp;page=215&amp;code=1020107 |title=Seoul-Honam Bullet Train Set for Completion by 2015 |date=2005-12-08 |publisher=Invest KOREA |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In plans made official in August 2006&lt;ref name=&quot;tci-honam-money&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2006/08/23/2006082361031.html |title=High-Speed Train to Extend Southwest Route |date=2006-08-23 |publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of a [[benefit-cost ratio]] below 1,&lt;ref name=&quot;EffectofHSR2008&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cho |first1=Nam-Geon |last2=Chung |first2=Jin-Kyu |title=High Speed Rail Construction of Korea and Its Impact |journal=KRIHS Special Report Series |volume=12 |year=2008 |publisher=Korea Research Insitute for Human Settlements |url=http://168.126.177.50/pub/docu/en/AD/ZA/ADZA2008AAN/ADZA-2008-AAN.PDF |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the budget for the 182.75&amp;nbsp;km first stage (from the new [[Osong Station]] on the Gyeongbu HSR to Gwangju) was set at 8,569.5 billion won.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamplans&quot;/&gt;  The second stage, the 48.74&amp;nbsp;km remaining to Mokpo, was to be finished by 2017 with a budget of 2,002.2 billion won.  The altogether 230.99&amp;nbsp;km, 10,571.7 billion won project would enable Seoul-Mokpo travel times of 1 hour 46 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EffectofHSR2008&quot;/&gt;  Ahead of the [[South Korean presidential election, 2007|2007 Presidential elections]], eventual winner [[Lee Myung-bak]] promised to accelerate the project by 3 years (with the first section finished by 2012).  While this date was deemed unrealistic by the responsible ministry, a one-year acceleration (first phase in 2014) was announced in January 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;honamquicker&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2899701 |title=High-speed railway pushed forward |date=2009-01-12 |publisher=[[JoongAng Daily]] |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Osong-Iksan section of the first phase is also intended for use as high-speed test track for rolling stock development, to be fitted with special catenary and instrumented track.&lt;ref name=&quot;rgi-korailresearch&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/news/single-view/view/10/research-underpins-korails-drive-to-be-a-global-player.html |title=Research underpins Korail's drive to be a global player |date=2007-05-01 |publisher=[[Railway Gazette International]] |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The project is financed to 50% by direct government funds and 50% loans.&lt;ref name=&quot;KRNA_2010&quot;/&gt;

===Construction===

By December 2009, construction began on three sub-sections of the 182&amp;nbsp;km line from Osong to Gwangju, which shall enable Seoul-Gwangju travel times of 1 hour 30 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;jejutunnelsceptic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2009/12/113_56779.html |title=Skepticism Lingers Over Honam KTX Line |date=2009-12-06 |publisher=[[The Korea Times]] |accessdate=2010-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ground-breaking ceremony was held at [[GwangjuÂ·Songjeong Station]] in the attendance of [[President of South Korea|President]] Lee Myung-bak on December 4, 2009, when total project costs were estimated at 11.3 billion won (US$9.8 billion).&lt;ref name=&quot;honam&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2913524 |title=Railway to the future |date=2009-12-05 |publisher=[[JoongAng Daily]] |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2010, progress was 9.6% of the  project budget then estimated at 10,490.1 billion won for the first phase, while the estimate for the entire line stood at 12,101.7 billion won.&lt;ref name=&quot;KRNA_2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.krnetwork.or.kr/service/condition/RouteMapView.do?PA_MAP_ID=12483 |title=í¸ë¨ê³ ìì² ë |publisher=Korea Rail Network Authority |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire line from Osong to Mokpo will include a total of 111.7 km of viaducts (48.35%) and 49.12 km of tunnels (21.26%).&lt;ref name=&quot;KRNA_2010&quot;/&gt;

==Stations==

Trains will stop at six stations along the line&lt;ref name=&quot;EffectofHSR2008&quot;/&gt;:
