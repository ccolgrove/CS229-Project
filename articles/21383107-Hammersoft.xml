'''Joanne Jackson''' was played by the actress [[Zaraah Abrahams]]. Joanne arrived at Underworld with her &quot;twin sister&quot; [[Jessie Jackson|Jessie]] and proceeded to cause much amusement by claiming to be identical despite the obvious difference in appearance. Joanne was the shyer of the two and lacks confidence where men are concerned. Her crush, and subsequent date, with [[Nathan Harding]] came to nothing after she was left feeling stupid and embarrassed about having a make over for someone who wasn't really interested in her.

Following his nasty break up with [[Leanne Battersby]], [[Jamie Baldwin]] was keen to ask Joanne out on a date. After a disastrous date the two realised that they did enjoy each others company and shared a kiss. This was followed by the promise to see each other again (unfortunately this was ruined by Jamie's problems with his alcoholic mother, [[Carol Baldwin|Carol]] and they decided against starting a new romance so soon after his break up with Leanne). She was also gutted when Jessie was sacked from Underworld and left to become an air hostess. When [[Kelly Crabtree]] took Joanne under her wing, Kelly's obsessed &quot;friend&quot; [[Becky Grainger]] threatened her, scaring Joanne half to death. When Kelly was set up for stealing at the factory by unhinged Becky, Joanne was the only person who believed Kelly was innocent and was instrumental in convincing the other factory workers that it was Becky, not Kelly who was to blame. For most of 2006, Joanne dated [[Adam Barlow]]. However, she kissed her new factory boss, [[Liam Connor]] (who, incidentally, Adam sold his half of the factory to) and had a fling with him, despite Kelly being sure that Liam fancied her, she soon dumped Adam with a [[short message service|text message]]. In April 2007 she revealed to [[Hayley Cropper]] that she was an illegal immigrant, brought over from [[Liberia]] at the age of 8, and that her &quot;twin sister&quot; is in fact her cousin, and was soon arrested as immigration officers raided the Factory. In June 2007, Joanne was released from [[Immigration]] Detention and resumed her job at underworld for around two weeks, until [[Carla Connor]], the majority owner of underworld, fired her claiming that the factory is over-staffed and that Joanne was the most recent employee, regardless of the fact she had worked at the factory for over three years previously. Joanne later [[blackmail]]ed [[Carla Connor|Carla]] and [[Liam Connor|Liam]] by threatening to take them to a tribunal for unfair dismissal and sexual harassment.

'''Keith Appleyard''' is played by [[Ian Redford (actor)|Ian Redford]]. Keith is [[Angela Harris (Coronation Street)|Angela Harris]]'s father. When she and her family live in Sheffield, she witnesses a murder. Keith persuades Angela to tell the truth and testify at the trial, which results in their move to Weatherfield under the [[witness protection]] scheme. They are also given a new name - Nelson - but don't use it for long. 

Keith first appears in 2005 to help Angela after her husband [[Tommy Harris (Coronation Street)|Tommy]] dies. He stays to look after his grandchildren [[Katy Harris|Katy]] and [[Craig Harris (Coronation Street character)|Craig]] after Angela is arrested for Tommy's murder. Katy (the real killer) commits suicide, unable to handle the guilt, and Angela is imprisoned for helping Katy cover up the crime. Keith stays with Craig in Coronation Street, rather than insist Craig join him in Sheffield, feeling Craig has suffered enough - plus, Weatherfield is closer than Sheffield to where Angela is in prison.

After moving in, Keith dates hairdresser [[Audrey Roberts]], who is his opposite in many ways. Keith is always watching the pennies and takes on a paper round to earn some extra money. His hobbies include [[taxidermy]].

Keith is widowed, his wife having died between 2003 and 2005. Angela telephones her mother on [[Christmas Day]] 2002, and visits her in September 2003, but she has died by the time Keith arrives in 2005.

After he and Audrey end things as they are so different, Keith became enemies with builder [[Charlie Stubbs]]. Charlie bills Keith for repairing the leak on the roof but Keith refuses to pay the bill, feeling Charlie has overcharged. In revenge, Charlie removes the roof tiles, insisting he will replace them when Keith pays his bill. Keith rings the police but the police say they can't help as it isn't a police matter. Keith is delighted to see Charlie replacing the tiles, thinking that he has won, until Charlie reveals that he is his new landlord. Keith is horrified and says that the landlord would have told him but Charlie says that he asked the former landlord to let him do that. Charlie's girlfriend, [[Tracy Barlow]], is delighted. She thinks, when Charlie tells Keith and Craig that he wants them out, that he intends to live there. 

Keith decides that he and Craig will move to [[Sheffield]] but Craig doesn't want to leave Coronation Street as his girlfriend, [[Rosie Webster|Rosie]], lives there too. Initially Keith agrees to stay but after an angina attack, he is told by the doctor that it is a warning and things have to change. Keith tells Craig that they are moving to [[Bournemouth]] with Keith's sister, Marjorie.
Craig is determined that he won't leave the street but Keith and Rosie's mother [[Sally Webster|Sally]] persuade him and they leave.

Jamie doesn't see Carol for many years; he is raised by Danny and Frankie. In 2005, he tracks down Carol to [[Birmingham]] and decides to pay her a visit. It soon becomes clear that past events have affected Carol's life very badly; she has never re-married, is living in a run down flat, and is an [[alcoholic]] with no job or money.

When Frankie and Danny split up, Carol moves in with them to be closer to Jamie and he makes her promise to give up alcohol.

In 2007, it becomes apparent that Carol has ditched the drink, and is now engaged. On September 25, 2007, Jamie and his ex-girlfriend, [[Violet Wilson]], attend Carol's wedding.

'''Freda Burgess''' is the deaf niece of the late Ernest Bishop. In August 2005, Freda came to visit her aunt Emily, but got a frosty reception from Emily's lodger Norris Cole, who thought she had only come for money from Emily but was impressed with her ability to lip-read. Freda helped Emily when she fell down the stairs and sprained her ankle, but left Coronation Street when she had had enough of Norris and the way he was treating her.

In March 2006, Freda visited to support Emily, who had just found out that her friend Ed Jackson was the man who shot Ernie dead in 1978. Emily was suffering a crisis of faith as she couldn't bring herself to forgive Ed or go to church, where she would have to face Ed as well as God.

In July 2009, Freda arrived back on the Street. She revealed to Emily that she was engaged, but her fiancÃ©e was in prison. She took a dislike to Emily's new friend Ramsay Clegg (Norris' half-brother) because she found him annoying - he was always too eager to please. Norris was thrilled, as he disliked his brother as well and felt they both had something in common. After staying a few days, Freda left again.

Freda turned up again in November after losing her job. She revealed to Emily that the woman she was working for was horrible to her, so she got her revenge by stealing her prosthetic leg. Emily didn't like this and said it was theft. However, Graeme Proctor found this amusing. She then got Graeme to dispose of the leg, as it was reported in the paper and she didn't want to get caught for theft.

She started entering competitions with Norris, and they both won Â£1,000 pounds. They split it equally and Freda left to put the Â£500 pounds on a house for herself.
