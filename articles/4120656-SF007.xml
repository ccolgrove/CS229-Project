'''Windows Mobility Center''' is a component of [[Microsoft Windows]], introduced in [[Windows Vista]], that centralizes the most relevant information to mobile computing.

==Overview==
The Windows Mobility Center [[user interface]] presents a series of square tiles that each contain one piece of information about a component of the system, as well as action items related to that component.  The tiles that appear depend on the system.  Windows Vista includes the following tiles:

* Brightness adjustment
* Sound adjustment / mute
* Battery level / power scheme selection
* Wireless network status
* Screen orientation (portrait or landscape)
* External displays
* Synchronization to other machines
* Presentation settings

Additional panes can be added by individual mobile computer manufacturers wanting to reveal functionality unique to their products.

Windows Mobility Center is located in the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]], and can also be launched by pressing the [[Windows key]] + X.  It is inaccessible on non-mobile computers, however it is possible to enable Mobility Center on desktop systems using a registry hack.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dubuque.k12.ia.us/it/mobilitycenter/&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Mobility Center is included with the Home Basic (although a Windows Vista help topic misinformed that Mobility Center is not available there), Home Premium, Business, Enterprise, and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista.

== Customization ==

Windows Mobility Center can be customized by adding extensions, called &quot;tile&quot;s. This customization is [[OEM]]-specific, according to [[Microsoft]] whitepaper; but there are several extensions available on the net from non-OEM origin.
