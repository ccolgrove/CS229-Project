'''Eddie Brock''' is a [[fictional character]] created by [[David Michelinie]] and [[Todd McFarlane]].  A comic book [[supervillain]], Brock's earliest appearance is a cameo in ''[[Web of Spider-Man]]'' #18 (September 1986)&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Saga'' #4, February 1992&lt;/ref&gt; before making his first full appearance in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #299 (April 1988) as [[Venom (comics)|Venom]]. The character has since appeared in many [[Marvel Comics]] publications including his own series ''Venom''.  Introduced as the first incarnation of the [[Spider-Man]] villain Venom, the character becomes an [[anti-hero]] working with and against superheroes.  

In the original version of the story, Brock is a journalist who exposes the identity of a serial killer only for the real killer to be caught by Spider-Man, Brock having accused the wrong man.  Disgraced and suicidal, Brock comes into contact with an alien [[Symbiote (comics)|Symbiote]], rejected by Peter Parker. The Symbiote bonds with Brock becoming Venom and together they seek out revenge against their mutual enemy.  Though Brock repeatedly comes into conflict with Spider-Man, he also attempts to operate as a hero, albeit a violent one, seeking to save those he deems &quot;innocent&quot;.  In 2008, after being separated from the Venom Symbiote, Brock gains a new Symbiote and becomes the anti-hero Anti-Venom.  Though Brock is a human with no powers, the Symbiote suit bestows upon him a range of abilities including many of the powers belonging to Spider-Man, the Symbiote's original host.

Debuting in the [[Modern Age of Comic Books]], the character of Eddie Brock has featured in other Marvel-endorsed products such as [[:category:Marvel Comics animation|animated television series]]; [[video games]]; a [[feature film]] and merchandise such as [[action figure]]s and [[trading card]]s. Eddie Brock's incarnation of Venom was rated 33rd on Empire's 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/50greatestcomiccharacters/default.asp?c=33 33 Venom], &quot;The 50 Greatest Comic Book Characters&quot;, ''[[Empire (film magazine)|Empire]]'', accessed July 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and was the 22nd greatest villain on [[IGN]]'s 100 Greatest Comic Villains of all time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://comics.ign.com/top-100-villains/22.html &quot;22. Venom&quot;], &quot;Top 100 Comic Book Villains of All Time&quot;, [[IGN]], accessed July 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Comics journalist and historian [[Mike Conroy (writer)|Mike Conroy]] writes of the character: &quot;What started out as a replacement costume for Spider-Man turned into one of the Marvel web-slinger's greatest nightmares.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mike Conroy (writer)|Conroy, Mike]]. 500 Comicbook Villains, p.358, Collins &amp; Brown, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication history==
===Creation and conception===
Writer [[David Michelinie]] and artist [[Todd McFarlane]] are generally credited with the character's creation, based on a number of plot ideas and concepts from various other creators, though the degree to which McFarlane should be credited with co-creating the character has been a source of dispute in the comic book industry. The question of who created the character of Venom became an issue of contention in 1993 when Michelinie wrote to the comic book industry magazine ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'', which had referred to Michelinie in issue #17 as &quot;co-creator&quot; of Venom. In his letter, printed in issue #21 (May 1993), Michelinie wrote that he was the character's sole creator, while saying also he believed that without McFarlane the character would not have attained the popularity it did.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' #21 (May 1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[Peter David]] corroborated Michelinie's view in his &quot;But I Digress&quot; column in the June 4, 1993 ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'', in which he stated that Michelinie discussed the ideas behind the character with him at the time of its creation. At that time, David was the writer on ''The Spectacular Spider-Man'' and wrote the &quot;Sin Eater&quot; storyline from which Eddie Brock's backstory would be derived, well before McFarlane was assigned to the art duties on ''Amazing''. Because artists who design the costumes or appearances of major characters and/or illustrate their first appearances are generally credited as co-creators, Venom represents a complex situation, because the costume from which Venom's appearance is derived was not designed by McFarlane.&lt;ref name=PeterDavid&gt;[[David, Peter]]. &quot;The Wacko Theory&quot;, ''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' June 4, 1993, Reprinted in the collection ''But I Digress'' (1994); pp. 104-106&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Erik Larsen]] responded to Michelinie's letter with one of his own that was printed in ''Wizard'' #23 (July 1993), in which he dismissed Michelinie's contributions to the character, arguing that Michelinie merely &quot;swiped&quot; the preexisting symbiote and its powers to place it on a character whose motivations were poorly conceived, one-dimensional, unbelievable, and clichÃ©d. Larsen also argued that it was McFarlane's rendition of the character that made it commercial.&lt;ref&gt;''Wizard'' magazine #23, July 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:AmazingSpider-Man346.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Erik Larsen, who followed Todd McFarlane as artist on ''Amazing Spider-Man'', added Venom's tongue as well as the drool to the character's appearance.]]
The preexisting elements that dealt with the symbiote costume itself - to which Michelinie did not contribute - have also been noted. For example, editor [[Jim Shooter]] came up with the idea of switching Spider-Man to a black-and-white costume, possibly influenced by the intended costume design for the new [[Julia Carpenter|Spider-Woman]], with artists [[Mike Zeck]] and [[Rick Leonardi]], as well as others, designing the black-and-white costume&lt;ref name=PeterDavid/&gt; (though a 2007 [[Comic Book Resources]] story contends that a fan suggested a black costume for the Spider-Man prior to this, for which he was paid by Shooter.&lt;ref&gt;Cronin, Brian. [http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/ &quot;Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schuellerâs Brush With Comic History&quot;] on [[Comic Book Resources]] May 16, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) Writer/artist [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] asserts on his website that the idea for a costume made of self-healing biological material was one he originated when he was the artist on '' [[Iron Fist (comics)|Iron Fist]] '' to explain how that character's costume was constantly being torn and then apparently repaired by the next issue, explaining that he ended up not using the idea on that title, but that [[Roger Stern]] later asked him if he could use the idea for Spider-Man's alien costume. Stern in turn plotted the issue in which the costume first appeared but then left the title. It was writer [[Tom DeFalco]] and artist [[Ron Frenz]] who had established that the costume was a sentient alien being and also that it was vulnerable to high sonic energy during their run on ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' that preceded Michelinie's.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Byrne (comics)|Byrne, John]]. [http://www.byrnerobotics.com/FAQ/listing.asp?ID=7&amp;T1=Miscellaneous+Questions#96 &quot;How is it that JB &quot;created&quot; Venom?&quot;], &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot;, Byrne Robotics, accessed July 2, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, Peter David's position is that Michelinie is the sole creator, since the idea of creating a ''separate'' character using the alien symbiote was Michelinie's, as was Eddie Brock's backstory, and that without the idea to create such a character, the character would not have existed.&lt;ref name=PeterDavid/&gt;

In an interview with Tom DeFalco,&lt;ref&gt;''Comics Creators on Spider-Man'', pg 148, Tom DeFalco. (Titan Books, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; McFarlane claims that Michelinie did indeed come up with the idea of Venom and the character's basic design (&quot;a big guy in the black costume&quot;). However, he contends that it was he (McFarlane) who gave Venom his monster-like features. He claims; &quot;I just wanted to make him kooky and creepy, and not just some guy in a black suit.&quot;

This dispute arose at a time when artists such as McFarlane and Larsen were enjoying a great deal of popularity and clout with readers, and capitalizing on their popularity by publishing creator-owned books with their new company, [[Image Comics]], and it is possible that this issue was a subtext of the greater debate over the importance of writers versus artists that was being waged in the industry at the time. Prior to McFarlane's departure from Marvel, the company stated that Venom was a creation of McFarlane's, and Michelinie shared credit as co-creator.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Regardless of the issues surrounding his creation, Venom was created under a [[work for hire]] contract, and Marvel owns all rights to the character.

Venom's existence was first indicated in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #18 (Sept. 1986), when he shoved [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] in front of a subway train without Parker's [[spider-sense]] warning him, though only Brock's hand was seen on-panel. The next indication of Venom's existence was in ''Web of Spider-Man'' #24 (March 1987), when Parker had climbed out of a high story window to change into Spider-Man, but found a black arm coming through the window and grabbing him, again without being warned by his spider-sense.

The character would remain unseen and inactive until ''Amazing Spider-Man'' editor [[Jim Salicrup]] required a villain for that book's 300th issue, and Michelinie suggested a villain consisting of the alien [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] grafted onto the body of a human female. Salicrup accepted the suggestion, but changed the character to a male. Michelinie then devised the Eddie Brock identity. Michelinie contends that the plots for issues #298-299, as well as the visual descriptions of the character, were written and bought by Salicrup before McFarlane was ever assigned to the book.

==Fictional character biography==
{{plot|date=November 2010}}
===Back-story===
The 1993 limited series ''[[Venom: Lethal Protector]]'' describes Brock's history before bonding with the symbiote. As a child, Edward Allan &quot;Eddie&quot; Brock&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote1&quot;/&gt; is raised in a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] household in [[San Francisco]].  Eddie's mother dies from complications during his birth and as a result his father is cold and unaffectionate towards him.  Eddie excels in academics and sports to earn his approval but does not succeed.  In college, Brock switches his major to journalism after reading an article on the [[Watergate scandal]]. After graduating he moves to New York City and obtains a job as a journalist for the ''[[Daily Globe (comics)|Daily Globe]]''. Though he proves himself to be a highly talented journalist, his father still only treats him with indifference.&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector3&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:EddieBrock-Bonding-and-First-Appearance.jpg|thumb|Left: Brock bonding with the symbiote. Right: Brock's first appearance as Venom in ASM #299.]]
As a reporter, Brock investigates the serial killer [[Sin-Eater (comics)|Sin-Eater]] and is contacted by Emil Gregg who claims to be the killer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt; Pressured by the authorities to reveal the killer's identity, Brock writes an exposÃ© announcing Gregg as the Sin-Eater. However, the real Sin-Eater is caught by Spider-Man and Brock is revealed to have been interviewing a compulsive confessor.  Brock is fired from his job in disgrace.  Unable to find reputable work, he is forced to work for tabloid magazines&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt; and his father ceases communication with him entirely.&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector3&quot;/&gt; Brock becomes obsessed with gaining revenge against Spider-Man, blaming him for catching the real Sin-Eater.  Brock resumes his passion for athletics through weight training to reduce stress but his anger and depression remain.  Meanwhile, Spider-Man uses the sound of bells at a church to remove his [[Venom (comics)|symbiote]] costume after realizing it is attempting to permanently bond with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebofSpiderMan1&quot;/&gt;  His professional and personal life shattered, Brock contemplates suicide and goes to the same church, where he prays to God for forgiveness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiote, having waited in the rafters of the church since leaving Spider-Man, senses Brock&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector1&quot;/&gt; and bonds with him, granting him powers equal and greater to those of Spider-Man,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt; and imparting knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;

===Venom===
Venom begins a campaign of torment against Peter, who is still unaware of his existence. He first pushes Peter in front of a moving subway without activating his spider-sense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[David Michelinie]]|penciler=[[Marc Silvestri]]|inker=[[Kyle Baker]]|story=The Longest Road|title=Web of Spider-Man|volume=1|issue=18|date=September 1986|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venom later confronts Spider-Man's wife [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing299&quot;/&gt; terrifying her and putting Spider-Man on alert.  Brock baits Spider-Man to his apartment for their first confrontation. Venom reveals his identity to Spider-Man claiming &quot;You may call me Venom, for that's what I'm paid to spew out these days!&quot; Spider-Man discovers that the Symbiote has completely bonded with Brock and he cannot kill it without also killing Brock. Eventually Venom is tricked into weakening himself by expending too much webbing until the suit lacks enough material to produce more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt; Venom is incarcerated in the [[Vault (comics)|Vault]], but in time escapes by mimicking a fallen guard.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing315&quot;/&gt;  Again engaging Spider-Man in battle, Venom is defeated and brought back to the vault.

Venom escapes from the Vault again during the &quot;[[Acts of Vengeance]]&quot; breakout, but is returned by [[Quasar (Wendell Vaughn)|Quasar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Mark Gruenwald]]|penciler=[[Paul Ryan (comics)|Paul Ryan]]|inker=Danny Bulanadi|story=Flies in a Cathedral|title=[[Quasar (comics)|Quasar]]|volume=1|issue=6|date=|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venom later attempts to engineer a prison break, but it fails.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=[[Danny Fingeroth]]|penciler=[[Ron Lim]]|inker=Fred Fredericks and James Sanders III|story=|title=Avengers: Deathtrap, The Vault|volume=|issue=|date=1991|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually fakes suicide and escaped after being taken to the morgue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=David Michelinie|penciller=Erik Larsen|inker=Mike Machlan|story=|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|volume=1|issue=330-331|date=|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later saves a baby while battling Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer=David Michelinie|penciler=Erik Larsen|inker=Various|story=Sunday In The Park With Venom!|title=The Amazing Spider-Man|volume=1|issue=332|date=|publisher=Marvel Comics|page=|panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a battle with Spider-Man, the Symbiote is seemingly killed by the plague-inducing villain [[Styx and Stone|Styx]], giving its life to protect Brock.  Brock is incarcerated and Spider-Man disposes of the Symbiote's remains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing333&quot;/&gt; The Symbiote survives by entering a comatose state to fight off the illness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing346&quot;/&gt; It returns to Brock, enabling him to escape from jail.  The symbiote asexually reproduces at the same time and leaves behind its spawn.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing345&quot;/&gt;  The offspring quickly bonds to Brock's cell mate, Cletus Kasady, creating [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing345&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing361&quot;/&gt;  Venom abducts Spider-Man and transports him to a remote island to do battle.  Spider-Man fakes his own death to convince Venom that his vendetta is over. Venom, content with the outcome, resigns himself to life on the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing347&quot;/&gt; Spider-Man eventually faces Carnage but is unable to defeat him. Spider-Man is forced to ask Venom for help, promising him freedom in exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing362&quot;/&gt; However, after they defeat Carnage Spider-Man betrays Venom and sends him back to prison.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing363&quot;/&gt;

===Anti-hero===
In ''Venom: Lethal Protector'', Brock again escapes prison after seeing a newspaper photo of Spider-Man's recently returned parents,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing373&quot;/&gt; seeking out and kidnapping them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing374&quot;/&gt;  During the resulting fight, Brock's ex-wife [[Venom (comics)#Ann Weying|Ann Weying]] is nearly crushed under a falling ferris wheel, but Spider-Man saves her.  Seeing this act, Venom makes peace with Spider-Man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing375&quot;/&gt; Venom moves to San Francisco and acts as the protector of an underground society of homeless people.&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector1&quot;/&gt; He is later taken prisoner by the Life Foundation who harvest the last five spawn within Venom to create super-powered policemen and Eddie is forcibly separated from the Symbiote.&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector4&quot;/&gt; With the help of Spider-Man, Brock is reunited with the Symbiote and they seemingly destroy his spawn Symbiotes, Phage, Lasher, Riot, [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] and Agony, before escaping.&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector5&quot;/&gt;  After saving the homeless people from being killed, Venom is accepted into their society and finds a new home.&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector6&quot;/&gt;

After Carnage reemerges and begins a massacre in New York City, Brock returns to help, feeling responsible.  In their first fight however, Brock is nearly killed and he goes to Spider-Man for help.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing378&quot;/&gt;  Spider-Man finds himself unwilling to work with Venom's methods and goes off on his own.  Venom joins with Black Cat, Cloak and Morbius to go after Carnage.  Spider-Man eventually rejoins Venom out of desperation.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebofSpiderMan102&quot;/&gt;  Venom's attempts to kill Carnage are repeatedly stopped by Spider-Man, causing them to fight.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiderMan36&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spectacular202&quot;/&gt; Venom is weakened by [[Shriek (comics)|Shriek]]'s sonic blasts&lt;ref name=&quot;Spectacular202&quot;/&gt; and captured by Carnage, who subjects him to torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;WebofSpiderMan103&quot;/&gt;  Venom eventually frees himself and escapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiderMan37&quot;/&gt; Venom and Carnage battle again and Venom tackles him into high-voltage generators, rendering him unconscious and allowing him to be imprisoned by The Avengers.  Brock goes into hiding.&lt;ref name=&quot;Unlimited2&quot;/&gt;

Brock is next seen in the 1994 limited series ''[[Venom: Separation Anxiety|Separation Anxiety]]''.  He is captured and separated from the Symbiote for a government research project.  Venom's spawn, Phage, Lasher, Scream, Riot and Agony are revealed to have survived and arrive to free Brock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Separation1&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiotes reveal they have defected from the Life Foundation and are seeking Brock's help to gain control over their &quot;other&quot;.  Brock refuses to help.  Meanwhile, the Venom Symbiote escapes from its holding facility and seeks out Brock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Separation2&quot;/&gt;  Scream is revealed to have been mentally unstable before joining with her Symbiote and murders her ally Symbiotes.  Brock is reunited with his Symbiote, becoming Venom, and fights Scream.  The fight is interrupted by soldiers from the research project.  Scream is captured and Venom escapes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Separation4&quot;/&gt;

In the 1995 ''&quot;[[Planet of the Symbiotes]]&quot;'' event, Brock forces the Symbiote to leave him, concerned about how much influence it may be having on him.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote1&quot;/&gt; The Symbiote unleashes a telepathically-projected scream of sorrow and pain that attracts other members of its species to Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote1&quot;/&gt; They create a portal to their last conquered world,&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote2&quot;/&gt; and Brock joins with Venom again and works with Spider-Man and [[Scarlet Spider]] to fight the other Symbiotes and stop their plan to conquer Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote3&quot;/&gt;  Carnage is freed by one of the invading Symbiotes and begins consuming the invaders, adding their mass to his own, massively increasing his size before stalking Venom.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote4&quot;/&gt;  Spider-Man and Scarlet Spider defeat Carnage while Venom sends out another psychic scream by bonding completely and irrevocably with the Symbiote.  The scream contains enough pain and despair to cause the invading Symbiotes to commit suicide.&lt;ref name=&quot;PlanetSymbiote5&quot;/&gt;

===''Venom'' series===
When Ann is shot by a new Sin Eater, Brock forces the Symbiote to bond with her to heal her injuries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinner2&quot;/&gt;  In the process she temporarily becomes She-Venom but Brock demands the Symbiote return after Ann loses control and kills a pair of muggers, leaving Ann traumatized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinner3&quot;/&gt;  Brock helps kill the new Sin-Eater.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinner5&quot;/&gt;  Ann is taken into custody by the police as they try to hunt Venom and Brock sends her his Symbiote so she can escape.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlongCame1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlongCame2&quot;/&gt;  As She-Venom she again struggles to control herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlongCame3&quot;/&gt;  When Brock takes back the Symbiote, she tells him to keep himself and the Symbiote away from her.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlongCame4&quot;/&gt;

Brock is captured in his sewer hideout and put on trial, with [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics)|Matt Murdock]] acting in his defense, his symbiote held in check by a chemical inhibitor.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTrial1&quot;/&gt;  Cletus Kassady is called as a witness, but when the case becomes heated both Kassady and Brock overcome their inhibitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTrial2&quot;/&gt; Venom, Spider-Man, and Daredevil team up and subdue Carnage. However, before the trial can continue Venom is unexpectedly taken into custody by a secret government organization offering him amnesty in exchange for him becoming their agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;OnTrial3&quot;/&gt; Though Venom at first enjoyed his new found immunities, he left after being abandoned during a dangerous mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| writer=Larry Hama| penciller=Josh Hood| copencillers=Derec Aucion| inker=Eric Connan| coinkers=Scott Koblish| story=| title=Venom: License to Kill| volume=| issue=3| date=August 1997| publisher=Marvel Comics| page=| panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving a head wound, Eddie suffers [[amnesia]].  He is later separated from the symbiote, which is presumed killed by the government Overreach Committee.&lt;ref&gt;''Venom: Finale'' mini-series&lt;/ref&gt;

The symbiote survives and tracks down the amnesiac Brock, turning him into Venom again. Venom infiltrates [[Ravencroft]] prison seeking Carnage and permanently absorbs the Carnage Symbiote.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiderMan10V2&quot;/&gt; Brock temporarily joins the [[Sinister Six]] to get Spider-Man but after being betrayed by them,&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiderMan12V2&quot;/&gt; he begins hunting down the members for revenge.  He ultimately cripples [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] by biting him, leading to the characters apparent death.&lt;ref name=&quot;SpiderMan16V2&quot;/&gt;

Venom's rivalry with Spider-Man is renewed when Ann, who lives in fear since bonding with the Symbiote, commits suicide after seeing Brock become Venom.  Venom however, believes Spider-Man swinging by Ann's window in his black costume to be the cause.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing460&quot;/&gt; Before he can take revenge however, the Symbiote is forcefully removed from him by the human/alien hybrid [[Senator Ward]] in order to learn more about symbiosis.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing463&quot;/&gt;  An alien race, secretly operating within the United States government, clones the Venom symbiote. Venom absorbs the clone, gains its knowledge, and decides to carry out the aliens' orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Daniel Way]]| cowriters=| penciller=Francisco Herrera| copencillers=Paco Medina,, Sean Galloway ''et al.''| inker=Carlos Cuevas| coinker=[[Juan Vlasco]], Wayne Faucher ''et al.''| title=&quot;[[Venom (comics)|Venom]] 1-14&quot; |date = April 2003|| publisher=Marvel Comics| id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer and post-Venom===
[[Image:Eddiebrockcancer.PNG|135px|left|thumb|A dying Eddie Brock, separated from the symbiote, from ''Sensational Spider-Man'' vol. 2 #39 (August 2007).]]
In the 2003 story &quot;The Hunger&quot;, Brock is revealed to have had cancer before joining with the Symbiote.  The Symbiote is shown to have chosen Brock not only for his hatred towards Spider-Man, but also because the cancer caused the release of adrenaline, which sustained the Symbiote.  By feeding on the cancer, the Symbiote keeps Brock alive.  Brock's motivation is also changed, showing him to have pursued Spider-Man not out of anger but fear that Spider-Man would one day take the Symbiote back, leaving Brock to die.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spectacular5&quot;/&gt;  Brock dies after the Symbiote leaves him for Spider-Man, not wanting a diseased host.  Spider-Man tricks the Symbiote into again bonding with Brock, reviving him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spectacular5&quot;/&gt;

Later, Carnage gives birth to a new Symbiote. Carnage attempts to kill the newborn while Venom attempts to save it,&lt;ref name=&quot;VenomCarnage1&quot;/&gt; hoping to turn it into an ally.&lt;ref name=&quot;VenomCarnage2&quot;/&gt;  Venom names the spawn [[Toxin (comics)|Toxin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;VenomCarnage2&quot;/&gt;  However, after Venom witnesses Toxin nearly kill Carnage but show compassion, he worries that he may be like Spider-Man and joins forces with Carnage to kill him.&lt;ref name=&quot;VenomCarnage3&quot;/&gt;  Carnage and Venom attack Toxin but are driven away by Spider-Man, Toxin and Black Cat.&lt;ref name=&quot;VenomCarnage4&quot;/&gt;

Brock has a crisis of faith and decides to sell the Symbiote, knowing he will rapidly die from his cancer without it sustaining him.  He intends to donate the $100 million received from the sale to charity before dying.&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV26&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiote is purchased by crime boss [[Don Fortunato]] for his son [[Venom (Angelo Fortunato)|Angelo Fortunato]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV27&quot;/&gt; Angelo briefly becomes the second Venom but proves an unworthy host.  The Symbiote abandons him mid-jump and he falls to his death. Upon learning of Angelo's death, Brock feels responsible and attempts suicide by slitting his wrists.&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV28&quot;/&gt;

Brock is next seen in hospital, rapidly succumbing to his cancer and experiencing hallucinations of &quot;Venom&quot;. He spots a comatose Aunt May in the same hospital, dying from a gunshot. The Venom hallucination persuades him to kill Aunt May.  Brock orders a novelty replica of Spider-Man's black costume and wears it at the demand of &quot;Venom&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV238&quot;/&gt;  Brock murders a nurse to test if he can still kill but ultimately refuses &quot;Venom&quot; and decides against killing May, finding he cannot kill an innocent. When Peter comes to visit May, he finds Eddie, who has repeatedly cut his own wrists to get rid of &quot;Venom&quot;. Eddie asks for Peter's forgiveness before jumping out of a window, but Peter manages to catch him. Awakening chained to his bed, Brock finds he can still see &quot;Venom&quot; but tells him that he accepts its presence as long as it knows that he is in control.&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV239&quot;/&gt;

===Anti-Venom===
[[Image:Antivenom.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Eddie Brock's first appearance as Anti-Venom]]
The 2008 story ''&quot;[[New Ways to Die]]&quot;'' features the return of Brock.  Matt Murdock convinces a court of law that Brock was not responsible for his actions while bonded to the symbiote and has criminal charges against him dropped.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing568&quot;/&gt; Brock gets a job at the F.E.A.S.T. center soup kitchen under Martin Li.  Brock is unknowingly cured of his cancer by Li, who possesses special abilities, but believes it to be a miracle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing568&quot;/&gt; Brock is later forced to fight the current Venom, Mac Gargan. The Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to bond with Brock again.  However, Brock's skin becomes [[corrosive substance|caustic]] to the symbiote.  Brock is enveloped in a new symbiote forged from the remnants of the Venom symbiote in his body bonding with his white blood cells charged with Li's healing energy,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing568&quot;/&gt; becoming Anti-Venom. He engages Gargan in a fight, and after receiving some help from Spider-Man, weakens and nearly destroys the symbiote. When he detects remnants of the symbiote inside Spider-Man, he attempts to &quot;cure&quot; him, draining radiation from his body and nearly de-powering him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing569&quot;/&gt;  Brock later saves Spider-Man from an attack by Osborn and works with him to retaliate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing572&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing573&quot;/&gt;  During the attack, Brock faces Gargan again, who is now equipped with a Scorpion battle-suit to protect his recovering symbiote. Gargan hits Anti-Venom with his stinger, injecting a poisonous formula that seemingly destroys Brock's suit. When Gargan attempts to kill Brock, the Venom symbiote prevents him from doing so.  Brock's suit later reforms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing573&quot;/&gt;

Eddie eventually faces the villain [[Mister Negative]] and discovers that he and Martin Li are the same person. Discovering the man he idolized is also a supervillain causes a breakdown for Eddie, making him question his faith and become unstable, referring to himself as a monster.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmazingExtra2&quot;/&gt;  Brock next appears in ''&quot;The Return of Anti-Venom&quot;'' (2011).  Unable to expose Negative's true identity, believing no-one will trust him, Anti-Venom starts a crusade against Negative, attacking his criminal operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing663&quot;/&gt;  When Anti-Venom realizes that May also knows Li is Negative, he decides to attack Negative directly before he can silence her.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing663&quot;/&gt;  Brock teams up with Spider-Man and the new [[Wraith (Marvel Comics)#Yuri Watanabe|Wraith]] to fight Negative.  Wraith uses her technology to publicly reveal Mister Negative is Martin Li, sending him into hiding.  Spider-Man and Anti-Venom call a truce to their rivalry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing664&quot;/&gt;

During the 2011 ''[[Spider-Island]]'' event in which 99% of New York City's population are transformed into mind-controlled spiders, Brock is forced to sacrifice his suitâand being Anti-Venomâso that it can be converted into a powerful curative capable of healing the infected millions.&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #668&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing670&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing671&quot;/&gt; In a 2011 ''New Avengers'' storyline, Brock joins [[Wonder Man]]'s [[Revengers#Earth-616 Revengers|Revengers]] to destroy the New Avengers.&lt;ref name=&quot;RevengersCBR&quot;/&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
{{Main|Symbiote (comics)}}
Brock is a human and has no superhuman powers without the symbiote. Prior to joining with the Symbiote, he possessed olympic-level strength from engaging in repeated, significant weight-training exercise.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector4&quot;/&gt;  After separating from the Symbiote and suffering from cancer, Brock loses much of his physical muscle and possesses the strength of an average human.&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV238&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AvengersAnnual1&quot;/&gt;

===As Venom===
As Venom, Brock gains several abilities similar to those of Spider-Man, the Symbiote's former host, including superhuman strength, speed, agility and reflexes as well as the ability to adhere to most surfaces with his hands and feet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiote is also able to project a web-like substance from its body, similar to Spider-Man's.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;  However, this webbing is produced organically by the Symbiote from its own mass meaning overuse can weaken the alien until it is able to regenerate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiote can also send out tendrils which can be used to grab or manipulate items from a distance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing333&quot;/&gt; When bonded with the host, the Symbiote allows the host to bypass Spider-Man's spider-sense, preventing him sensing attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiote is susceptible to harm from high-pitched sonic frequencies which can cause it to be severely weakened or killed.  The bond between the Symbiote and Brock was strong enough that using sonics against the Symbiote could also stun and kill Brock.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;  

Venom's body is highly resistant to injury, capable of outright stopping bladed weapons,&lt;ref name=&quot;AmazingAnnual25&quot;/&gt; bullets,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing333&quot;/&gt; and it can help its host survive in hostile environments by filtering air, allowing survival underwater&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing347&quot;/&gt; and in toxic environments. Venom can also morph his appearance, to create disguises at will,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing300&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing333&quot;/&gt; and camouflage itself,&lt;ref name=&quot;LethalProtector3&quot;/&gt; even emulating water.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing347&quot;/&gt;  It is also capable of psychically detecting its offspring; however, this ability can be blocked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing362&quot;/&gt;  This sense can be used by Brock even when separated from the suit, allowing him to detect and be detected by the Symbiote and its children.&lt;ref name=&quot;Separation2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Separation3&quot;/&gt;  The Symbiote is capable of healing injury and illness at an increased rate, allowing the host to survive otherwise mortal damage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sinner2&quot;/&gt; The Symbiote and host are capable of sharing knowledge, the Symbiote able to pass on information from previous hosts to future ones.&lt;ref name=&quot;SensationalV27&quot;/&gt; The Venom Symbiote contains a small 'dimensional aperture', allowing Brock to carry items without adding mass to the costume.    Due to Eddie Brock's muscular physique and natural physical strength from weight training, his strength as Venom is significantly superior to Spider-Man's. {{issue|date=December 2010}}

===As Anti-Venom===
Anti-Venom is created when the healing energies of Martin Li cause Brock's white-blood cells and traces of the Venom Symbiote still within his body to combine into a new suit composed of human/alien hybrid antibodies possessing powerful restorative abilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing568&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing572&quot;/&gt;  Brock is capable of rapidly healing significant injury as Anti-Venom, recovering almost instantly after being shot in the head and suffering damage to his brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing664&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AntiVenomNewWaystoLive&quot;/&gt;  However, this healing ability can be negated by the energy of Mr. Negative, counteracting the energy of Martin Li.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing664&quot;/&gt;  Anti-Venom is able to detect when others are ill&lt;ref name=&quot;NewWaysToLive1&quot;/&gt; and &quot;cure&quot; or &quot;cleanse&quot; them.  He is able to cure ailments from hepatitis to removing narcotics and even radiation from a person's body.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewWaysToLive1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing571&quot;/&gt;  After his attempt to &quot;cure&quot; Spider-Man by removing the radiation in his body, any time he and Anti-Venom are in close proximity to each other, Spider-Man's begins to grow weak until they are apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing663&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing571&quot;/&gt;

As Anti-Venom, Brock's suit is corrosive to the Venom symbiote, inflicting pain and damage on the suit to the point of causing it to dissolve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing569&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing570&quot;/&gt; He displays similar abilities as Venom, possessing super strength, speed,&lt;ref name=&quot;AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3&quot;/&gt; negating Spider-Man's spider-sense,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing570&quot;/&gt; and being able to block damage entirely from some guns and knives.&lt;ref name=&quot;AntiVenomNewWaystoLive&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3&quot;/&gt;  He is also capable of extending and morphing the suit to create disguises,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing571&quot;/&gt; form items such as shields,&lt;ref name=&quot;NewWaysToLive1&quot;/&gt; extend his reach,&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing663&quot;/&gt; attack from a distance,&lt;ref name=&quot;AntiVenomNewWaystoLive3&quot;/&gt; and create tendrils.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewWaysToLive1&quot;/&gt;  Anti-Venom is also immune to the weaknesses of the Venom Symbiote, showing no damage or effect from direct blasts of fire, heat and sound.&lt;ref name=&quot;AntiVenomNewWaystoLive&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing571&quot;/&gt;  The only shown weaknesses of the Symbiote are a highly toxic &quot;super venom&quot; created as a direct countermeasure using remnants of Anti-Venom's suit and Mr. Negative's energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing572&quot;/&gt;  The &quot;super venom&quot; causes the suit to immediately dissolve.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing573&quot;/&gt; Mr. Negative is shown capable of using his energy to weaken or nullify the healing abilities of the suit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazing664&quot;/&gt;
