They were originally associated with the [[punk rock]] scene, appearing on the ''[[Live at the Roxy WC2]]'' albumâa key early document of the sceneâand were later central to the development of [[post-punk]].

Inspired by the burgeoning UK punk scene, Wire are often cited as one of the more important rock groups of the 1970s and 1980s. Critic Stewart Mason writes, &quot;Over their brilliant first three albums, Wire expanded the sonic boundaries of not just punk, but rock music in general.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, Stewart [http://www.allmusic.com/artist/bruce-gilbert-p13047/biography &quot;Bruce Gilbert Biography&quot;], [[Allmusic]], retrieved 2011-01-02&lt;/ref&gt;

Wire are arguably a definitive [[art punk]] or post-punk ensemble, mostly due to their richly detailed and atmospheric sound, often obscure lyrical themes and, to a lesser extent, their [[Situationist International|Situationist]] political stance. The group exhibited a steady development from an early raucous punk style (1977's ''[[Pink Flag]]'') to a more complex, structured sound involving increased use of guitar effects and [[synthesizers]] (1978's ''[[Chairs Missing]]'' and 1979's ''[[154 (album)|154]]''). The band gained a reputation for experimenting with song arrangements throughout its career.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_bio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Wilson Neate | date = | url = http://www.allmusic.com/artist/wire-p5856/biography | title= Wire biography | publisher = www.allmusic.com | accessdate    = 2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Wire's debut album, ''Pink Flag'' (1977), 'perhaps the most original debut album to come out of the first wave of British punk', according to [[Allmusic]], contains songs which are diverse in mood and style, but most use a minimalist punk approach, unorthodox structures,&lt;ref name=&quot;trouser&quot; /&gt; &quot;Field Day For The Sundays&quot;, for example, is only 28 seconds long.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_pink&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Steve Huey| date = | url =http://www.allmusic.com/album/pink-flag-r22101/review| title = Pink Flag album review

''Chairs Missing'' followed in 1978, and found Wire stepping back from the stark minimalism of ''Pink Flag'', with longer, more atmospheric songs and synthesizer parts added by producer Mike Thorne.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_bio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| author = Steve Huey| date = | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/chairs-missing-r22102| title = Chairs Missing| publisher = AllMusic| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experimentation was even more prominent on ''154'' (1979).&lt;ref name=&quot;The Great Rock Discography&quot;/&gt; Many of the songs had bassist Graham Lewis on lead vocals.

In 1979, creative differences pulled the band in different directions, leading to the ''[[Document and Eyewitness]]'' LP (1981), a recording of a live performance that featured, almost exclusively, new material, which was described as 'disjointed',&lt;ref name=&quot;trouser&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = Jim DeRogatis, Wilson Neate | date = | url = http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=wire | title= Wire | publisher =www.trouserpress.com | accessdate = 2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'unrecognizable as rock music' and 'almost unlistenable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Wilson Neate| date = | url = http://www.allmusic.com/album/document-and-eyewitness-r22090/review| title = Document and Eyewitness | publisher = AllMusic| accessdate = 2010-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LP came packaged with an [[Extended play|EP]] of a different performance of more new material. Some of these songs, along with others performed but not included on the album, were included on Colin Newman's post-Wire solo albums (&quot;5/10&quot;, &quot;We Meet Under Tables&quot;), while others were released by Gilbert and Lewis' primary post-Wire outlet [[Dome (band)|Dome]] (&quot;And Then...&quot;, &quot;Ritual View&quot;).

Between 1981-85 Wire ceased recording and performing in favour of solo and non-Wire collaborative projects such as Dome, Cupol, Duet Emmo, and several [[Colin Newman]] solo efforts. In 1985, the group reformed as a &quot;[[beat combo]]&quot; (a joking reference to early 1960s beat music or even possibly [[beatnik]]s), with greater use of [[electronic musical instrument]]s. Wire announced that they would perform none of their older material, hiring The Ex-Lion Tamers, (a Wire [[cover band]] named after a song title from ''Pink Flag''), as their opening act. The Ex-Lion Tamers played Wire's older material; Wire played their new material.&lt;ref name=&quot;riley&quot;/&gt; It released ''[[It's Beginning To And Back Again]]'' (''IBTABA'') in 1989, a &quot;live&quot; album of mostly re-worked versions of songs from ''[[The Ideal Copy]]'' and ''[[A Bell Is a Cup...Until It Is Struck]]'', heavily re-arranged, edited, and remixed. A new song from the album, &quot;Eardrum Buzz&quot;, became the band's biggest charting single.

Gotobed left the band in 1990, after the release of the album ''[[Manscape]]''. After his departure, the band dropped one letter from its name, becoming &quot;Wir&quot; (still pronounced &quot;wire&quot;), and released ''[[The First Letter]]'' in 1991. There followed a further period of solo recordings, during which Newman founded the [[Swim ~]] label, and later [[Githead]] with his wife (ex-[[Minimal Compact]] bassist [[Malka Spigel]]), while Wire remained an occasional collaboration. It was not until 1999 that Wire again became a full-time entity.

With Gotobed back in the line-up (now using his birth name, Robert Grey), the group initially reworked much of their back catalogue for a performance at [[Royal Festival Hall]] on 26 February 2000. Wire's reception during a short tour in early May of the [[United States|US]], and a number of [[United Kingdom|UK]] gigs, convinced the band to continue. Two [[Extended play|EPs]] and an album ''[[Send (album)|Send]]'' (2003) followed, as well as collaborations with stage designer Es Devlin and artists [[Jake and Dinos Chapman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectdark.demon.co.uk/DJK/wire.htm &quot;Wire + Jake &amp; Dinos Chapman + ES Devlin with Kirsten Reynolds (Project Dark)&quot;], projectdark.demon.co.uk. Retrieved 23 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Wire's 1970s albums were re-released with original vinyl tracklistings. Rumours abounded of a renewal of activity{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} to mark the 30th anniversary of the band's debut as a 4 piece and the re-release of ''[[Pink Flag]]'' in 2007. A third ''Read &amp; Burn'' EP was released in November, 2007.

A full-length album of new material entitled ''[[Object 47]]'' was released in July 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Tangari, Joe. [http://www.pitchforkmedia.com/node/141837 &quot;Wire: Object 47&quot;]. ''Pitchfork Media'', 2008. Retrieved on 23 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Gilbert was not involved in this recording, although according to Colin Newman, he did feature in a minimal capacity on the third ''Read and Burn'' EP.

On January 10, 2011 the band's twelfth studio album, ''[[Red Barked Tree]]'' was released which (according to press release and BBC) &quot;...rekindles a lyricism sometimes absent from Wire's previous work and reconnects with the live energy of performance, harnessed and channelled from extensive touring over the past few years&quot;. The album was written and recorded by Colin Newman, Graham Lewis and Robert Grey (no guests involved), but speaking to [[Marc Riley]] on the day of the release, Newman introduced as 'a new boy' guitarist Matt Simms (from [[It Hugs Back]]) who's been with the band since April 2010 as a touring member.&lt;ref name=&quot;riley&quot;&gt;BBC Radio 6 [http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00xbbmz#segments Monday 10, 2011 Marc Riley]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Wire are a band whose influence has outshone their comparatively modest record sales. In the 1980s and 1990s, [[The Urinals]], [[Manic Street Preachers]], [[The Minutemen (band)|The Minutemen]], [[R.E.M.]], and [[The Cure]] expressed a fondness for the group. [[R.E.M.]] covered &quot;Strange&quot; on their ''[[Document (album)|Document]]'' album, and &quot;[[What's The Frequency, Kenneth?]]&quot; emulates Wire's song &quot;Feeling Called Love&quot;. Since their 2008 reunion, [[The Feelies]] have regularly covered &quot;Outdoor Miner&quot; during its live sets.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}

[[Guided By Voices]]' Robert Pollard claimed that Wire was his favourite band, and that the fact that GBV's albums had so many songs was directly influenced by Wire's albums.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} One of [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]]'s last releases was a cover of &quot;Map Ref 41Â°N 93Â°W&quot; for a Wire tribute entitled ''Whore''. The song was selected as a favourite cover by ''[[Flak Magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flakmag.com/features/best/music/mapref.html |title=Flak Magazine: Cover Tunes â &quot;Map Ref 41N 93W,&quot; 1-29-01 |publisher=Flakmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, [[Fischerspooner]] (who covered &quot;[[The 15th]]&quot; on their #1 album), [[britpop]] bands like [[Elastica]] and [[Menswear (band)|Menswe@r]] and [[Post-punk revival|post-punk revival bands]] like [[Bloc Party]], [[Futureheads]], [[Blacklist (band)|Blacklist]], and [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]] owe a debt to Wire. [[Blur (band)|Blur]]'s work, along with many more minor Britpop bands, have been particularly reminiscent of 1970s Wire at various points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trouserpress.com/entry.php?a=wire |title=Wire |publisher=TrouserPress.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wire were influential on [[hardcore punk]]. Fans included [[Ian MacKaye]] of the hardcore punk band [[Minor Threat]] and [[Henry Rollins]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.henryrollins.com/website/dispatch_beta/2008/11/30/11-29-08/ HenryRollins.com blog entry 11-29-08]{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly of [[Black Flag (band)|Black Flag]]. [[Minor Threat]] covered &quot;1 2 X U&quot; for the Dischord Records compilation ''Flex Your Head'', as well as [[Boss Hog]] on the &quot;I Dig You&quot; EP and CD. [[Henry Rollins]], as Henrietta Collins &amp; The Wife-Beating Childhaters, covered &quot;Ex-Lion Tamer&quot; on the EP &quot;[[Drive by Shooting]]&quot;. Michael Azerrad reported, in ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', that at Minor Threat's second gig, each of the seven bands on the roster performed its version of a Wire song. [[Big Black]] covered Wire's &quot;Heartbeat&quot; twice, once as a studio version which was released as a single (also included on ''[[The Rich Man's Eight Track Tape]]'' compilation), and also as a live version, featuring [[Bruce Gilbert]] and [[Graham Lewis]], that was included on the [[VHS]] version of its live album ''[[Pigpile]]''. The slowcore Mormon band Low included an early, previously unreleased cover of ''Heartbeat'' on their career-spanning boxset in 2007. The live-only, all-girl ukulele band Colossus performed endurance-test versions of ''I Am the Fly'' during their 2007 tour of eastern Europe. [[Ampere (band)|Ampere]] recorded a cover of &quot;Mr. Suit&quot; for its 2006 split with [[Das Oath]]. [[New Bomb Turks]] also recorded a cover of &quot;Mr. Suit&quot; on its 1993 album ''[[Destroy Oh Boy]]''. 

A [[plagiarism]] case between Wire's music publisher and [[Elastica]], over the similarity between Wire's 1977 song &quot;Three Girl Rhumba&quot; and Elastica's 1995 hit &quot;[[Connection (Elastica song)|Connection]]&quot;, resulted in an out-of-court settlement.

[[Olivier Assayas]]'s 2010 film ''[[Carlos (TV miniseries)|Carlos]]'' uses 4 of the band's fast-paced songs on the soundtrack to increase tension:  &quot;Drill&quot;, &quot;Dot Dash&quot;, &quot;The 15th&quot; and &quot;Ahead&quot;.
