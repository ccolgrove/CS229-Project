The Guardian Council, the body in charge of supervising and certifying the elections in Iran, declared the incumbent President Ahmadinejad winner after dismissing the vote challenges, according to a front page report on CNN.com. The report said that PressTV, a semi-state run television network in the nation announced the decision via a spokesperson for the group. They said that while they agreed that in up to 50 cities votes were higher than those eligible to vote, but that it was not enough to result in anything beyond further investigations.

Speaking at a news conference on Monday, foreign ministry spokesman [[Hassan Qashqavi]] accused Western governments of explicitly backing violent protests aimed at undermining the stability of Iran's Islamic Republic. He said the West was acting in an &quot;anti-democratic&quot; manner, instead praising Iran's commitment to democracy and stressing once again that the results of the presidential election were unimpeachable. Iran has strongly criticised the US and UK governments in recent days, and Mr Qashqavi reserved special scorn for the [[BBC]] and for the [[Voice of America]] network, which he called &quot;government channels&quot;. He spoke as Tehran remained tense but quiet amid heavy security aimed at preventing new protests against the result of Iran's presidential election. Mr [[Mousavi]] has told his supporters, who have taken to the streets in their tens of thousands for more than a week, to continue their protests but not to put their lives in danger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8112176.stm|title=West 'seeks Iran disintegration'|date=2009-06-22|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] later condemned the &quot;repression&quot; and &quot;brutality&quot; used against the protesters. At approximately the same time the British Embassy in Tehran announced they were evacuating the families of embassy staff members and issued a [[travel advisory]] against visiting Iran. The Foreign Office noted that, &quot;further violence is possible,&quot; but said it did not believe it was necessary for British nationals already in Iran to leave the country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/jun/22/iran-embassy-staff-families-evacuated Britain evacuates families of embassy staff in Iran] [[The Guardian]] Published 22 June 2009 17.07 BST.

In addition, it was believed that these [[Basij]] guards did not speak [[Persian language|Persian]] because they did not understand nor did they respond to the cries from the protesters. She reported that these [[Basij]] militia-men came out of a local [[mosque]] by the hundreds to violently attack protesters.

On this day numerous violent confrontations with the [[Basij]] were reported. It seems as if the violence has started again in [[Tehran]], but again, as of this date, these reports are confirmed with few photos and videos.

There were also reports of protesters at the Iranian Parliament building coming under sniper fire from Basiji. While Wednesday's protests were relatively small in terms of the numbers of people involved, they are said to have been some of the bloodiest during the unrest. Iranian dissidents claim the day's violence raised the death toll to 249 the last ten days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2009/jun/25/opposition-alters-tactics-to-avoid-protest-deaths/|title=Iran protesters alter tactics to avoid death|date=2009-06-25|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=2009-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to the earlier violence, June 25 was the calmest day that Tehran had seen in nearly two weeks. A source for [[The Guardian (UK)|The Guardian]] reported that this was likely due, at least in part, to the national university entrance exams being conducted on that day, in which 1.5 million young Iranians participated.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-iran-crisis&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/blog/2009/jun/25/iran-crisis|title=Iran crisis: live|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-06-29 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Nasaw | date=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another opposition candidate, [[Mahdi Karroubi]], postponed a vigil of mourning for the victims scheduled for June 25, pushing the date back at least a week.

Despite the relative quiet, there were still a few incidents. A group of mourners attempted to visit the grave of Neda Agha Soltan, but were turned away by riot police. Those who refused the order to disperse or were seen carrying green signs were arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian-iran-crisis&quot; /&gt; Clashes were also reported in and around Enghelab square, a site of previous violence. Protesters were said to have come from two sides and tried to drive the police from the square.

Responding to [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]]'s appeal, Iranian government legally approved a Sunday June 28, 2009, (or Tir 7th 1388 [[Anno Persico]]) peaceful prayer gathering at 6pm mourning those killed during the 2009 post-election clashes at the [[Qoba Mosque]] on Ghoba Alley&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/1767515/fa/ghoba-street |title=ghoba street ØªÙØ±Ø§Ù |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (North of Hosseinie Ershad Mosque on Doktor Ali-ye Shariati) in Tehran. Diplomats from Muslim and Arab countries may attend. The government promised not to hurt the peaceful mourners present.

Snipers and intelligence officers are seen on the roofs near Ghoba, a unit of Anti-Riot Police warned people to leave, military helicopters hovering in the sky.

Thousands of people are gathered around the Ghoba-Shariati neighborhood.

An estimated 5,000 protesters marched slowly and silently through Tehran Sunday. Government was reportedly allowing demonstration.

The large crowd shouted &quot;Ya [[Hussein]]&quot; in a YouTube footage. A YouTube footage shows that [[Mehdi Karroubi]] entered the crowd at the Ghoba Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rgUvDmcwmWU |title=â«Ø­Ø¶ÙØ± Ú©Ø±ÙØ¨Û Ø¯Ø± Ø§Ø¹ØªØ±Ø§Ø¶Ø§Øª ÙØ±Ø¯ÙÛ Ø±ÙØ¨Ù Ø±ÙÛ ÙØ³Ø¬Ø¯ ÙØ¨Ø§â¬ |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One witness reported at 8:30pm that [[Mohammad Khatami]] and [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]] are reportedly seen earlier at the Mosque. However, another witness said that [[Alireza Beheshti]], son of [[Mohammad Beheshti]] told the crowd that Mousavi was prevented from coming. [[Faezeh Hashemi]] was seen with people that ringed around the banner outside of the Mosque door. The slogans were: &quot;Salam bar Beheshti, Dorood bar Mousavi.&quot; [[Mostafa Malekian]] stood in the Ghoba alley with the crowd and sported victory signs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://parsine.com/pages/?cid=8684 ]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Reza Attaran]] also joined the crowd, wearing a green T-shirt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNvUGCIRZ_4 |title=Reza Attaran Popular TV &amp; Cinema Actor &amp; Director in ghoba Ø±Ø¶Ø§ Ø¹Ø·Ø§Ø±Ø§Ù ÙØ³Ø¬Ø¯ ÙØ¨Ø§ |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also attending the gathering was [[Hojjat al-Islam]] [[Hadi Ghaffari]].

Because the Shariati Street entrance of Ghoba Alley and the other end were both blocked by barriers, about 2000 mourners packed in the alley, under surveillance of sharpshooters and heavy police presence, especially those fully deployed along Shariati Street. A witness reported that police used tear gas to disperse the people at the northern end of the Ghoba Alley.

There are Facebook posters who claimed to have attended the Ghoba gathering who disputed that there was serious clashes, claiming that the exit towards the United Nations office (which is at the northern end of Ghoba Alley) was peaceful and free of tear gassing or clashes. This claim, along with those of serious clashes, cannot be verified.

All YouTube postings that shows Ghoba setting are peaceful so far, including one with the crowd surrounding [[Alireza Beheshti]], who spoke via a loudspeaker, and was watched by a police officer behind. Beheshti conveyed to the crowd a message delivered by Mousavi over the phone. On the same day, there are new YouTube postings of some street (allegedly on Shariati Street leading to Ghoba Alley) marches with &quot;[[Marg bar diktator]]&quot; (death to dictator) shouted in unison, and some with smoldering objects and gunshots dispersing rioters. But these were clearly not shot at the narrow alley of Ghoba, and not necessarily on Sunday the 28th. The safety in the surrounding of a historical mosque, coinciding with an important memorial date in the Islamic Republic seem to have given police forces and the protesters such an uneasy moment of truce and standstill. This matches the pattern throughout centuries of Islamic history in which religiously-sanctioned gatherings became moments of freedom of political expression, and in which political dissents became symbiotic with a community held together by common interpretation of faith, which secular authorities had difficulties in outlawing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcvfXKe1y30 |title=June 28 Iranians rally at Ghoba Mosque (also spelled Qoba) on Shariati Street, Tehran |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-06-28 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to some witnesses to urge the Muslims among the Greens to pray silently in large numbers at mosques during prayer hours, especially on Fridays, as a silent protest against the government's prohibition on any gathering.

Despite this, the government's arrest of 8 British embassy employees (with 4 later released) is another indicator of its readiness to intimidate the international community. Khamenei has issued a statement warning &quot;both sides&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/06/28/iran.demonstration/index.html |title=Thousands demonstrate silently in Tehran |publisher=CNN.com |date= June 28, 2009|accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; not to provoke each other, hinting that further wanton police brutality is perceived by the Supreme Leader, if not by Ahmadinejad's faction, to be costly for the regime's shaky rule.

Injuries were reported, among them an elderly woman who was allegedly beaten by police.

A Sunday June 28 YouTube posting shows a riot raging in a northern Tehran neighborhood (with the [[Alborz]] Mountain in the backdrop, which was on an unconfirmed date around sunset. The entire neighborhood was shrouded in smoke. Flame was visible on a street nearby. And the video camera, viewing from a tall building, could record a uniformed armed policeman randomly shooting into the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=28 juni 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0EgJwm-IlNQ |title=28 June - Tehran - last News |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by midnight Tehran time, CNN described the Ghoba protest as &quot;silent&quot;, with peaceful end. The Iranian government-funded [[Press TV]] also described the event as &quot;silent&quot;, consisting of &quot;hundreds&quot; of people that are admittedly &quot;Mousavi supporters&quot; commemorating the 1981 martyrdom of [[Mohammad Beheshti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=99288&amp;sectionid=351020101 |title=Mousavi supporters join Beheshti commemorators |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, Egyptian security forces shut down a scheduled solidarity march through the streets of Cairo, planned in honor of Neda Agha Soltan. Egyptian dissidents accused their government of hypocrisy, for having denounced the Iranian regime's repressive actions only days before banning the march.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=June 29, 2009&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp; 8:55 am |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2009/06/egypt-marsh-showing-solidarity-with-iranian-martyr-banned.html |title=EGYPT: Police shut down Iran solidarity march &amp;#124; Babylon &amp; Beyond &amp;#124; Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2009-06-29 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guardian Council reaffirmed Ahmadinejad's victory after recounting 10% of the votes. Upon the announcement of this news, protesters once again took to the streets of Tehran, and clashes were reported in the city. Although the police cleared the streets relatively quickly, citizens throughout the capital resumed the shouting of revolutionary slogans from the rooftops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/world/middleeast/30iran.html | work=The New York Times | title=Iran Council Certifies Ahmadinejad Victory | first=Michael | last=Slackman | date=June 30, 2009 | accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No protest activity or violence was reported at this gathering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/06/30/june-30-latest-updates-on-irans-post-election-turmoil/ | work=The New York Times | first=Rogene | last=Fisher | date=June 30, 2009 | accessdate=March 28, 2010 | title=June 30: Latest Updates on Iran's Post-Election Turmoil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many expatriates from [[Muslim countries]] expressed that they wish to visit the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] Cemetery in peace, or at least as close to the site of [[Neda Agha-Soltan]]'s first burial site as possible on Saturday-Sunday, July 4â5, the 2-week anniversary of her death, since the martyred woman wasn't given a proper Muslim funeral.

On the date of Ghoba, although some expatriates expressed that they would like to attend the Mosque gathering to show faith to Allah, the Ahmadinejad regime arrested 9 British diplomats as soon as they caught wind that certain Iranian-born British diplomats might be attending. Now most of the British diplomats were released under international pressure. But this{{Which?|date=July 2009}} Iranian-born British diplomat is still under interrogation.

Thursday, July 2, thousands of relatives of dead protesters marched towards the [[Behesht-e Zahra]] cemetery, where mass graves were set aside for the dead, and where [[Neda Agha-Soltan]] is buried. These mourners were reportedly frustrated by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=2 juli 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gik9pHVyzhs |title=Tehran July 2 |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-07-01 |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video was filmed on roof top. Even though Khosravi Street was not directly filled with violence, it was certainly not far from the view of bike-riding Basijis. The shot that killed her was not the only shot heard in the video, though the last.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIyLCOSDIlo |title=Broadcast Yourself |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2010-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was apparent that the black-veiled woman (apparently Neda) accompanied by the blue-shirted old man (apparently Panahi), was shot by the bike-riding Basijis shooting at the &quot;Marg bar diktator!&quot; shouters, who were not close, but fully within view of the walking woman. This observation is in sharp contrast to the Iranian government's explanation that Neda's shooting was carefully set up by [[Arash Hejazi]]. If Neda's death was so carefully set up, the dozens of other violent deaths in Tehran in these few weeks can also be likewise explained, while the police and Basijis were the only people evidently armed with fire weapons, and were caught on films smashing private properties without provocation. It is also contrary to the account that the site of her shooting is entirely out of the range of rioting streets. What this video can not show, is whether there was any armed bike-riders going out of their way from the rioting street behind, to attack the woman at close range.

The Assembly of Teachers and Scientists at the [[Qom]] School for Shiite Clerics declared the 2009 election in which Ahmadinejad won &quot;illegitimate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/world/middleeast/05iran.html | work=The New York Times | title=Clerical Leaders Defy Ayatollah on Iran Election | first1=Michael | last1=Slackman | first2=Nazila | last2=Fathi | date=July 5, 2009 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This date, being an anniversary of [[Iran student protests, July 1999|18 Tir Massacre]], had been predicted to be a day of massive protests in Tehran. Indeed, protests broke out, with about 700 people chanting &quot;Death to dictator!&quot; in front of Tehran University. Other protest, by about 200 people took place at Vali-e Asr Street.

Security operations against protests are difficult, as vast areas of Iranian territory were covered with [[dust storm]], including Tehran, where many offices and schools had to be closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8139007.stm|title=Iran hit by sandstorm pollution|publisher=BBC News|date=2009-07-07}}

This day represented the end of 40th-day mourning cycle.

After the service at the mosque, the leaders paid visits to and show solidarity with some families who have lost their members in the violence. This message also ties into Mousavi's earlier message that &quot;religious celebrations are opportunities for the display of the 'Green' movementâs creativity.&quot;

After arriving to Behesht-e Zahra cemetery, Mousavi was forced by police to go back to his car and leave the site. Basij units were dispatched to halt demonstrations and disperse the crowd.

'''January 1 '''

During Friday Prayer services in the capital, Ayatollah [[Ahmad Jannati]], a fundamentalist cleric who leads the powerful Guardian Council, called protesters âflagrant examples of the corrupt on Earthâ and effectively urged that they be executed as âin the early days of the revolution.â&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes.com&quot;/&gt;

In a public statement released through internet and to media outlets, Mir Hossein Mousavi declares he is ready to be [[martyr]]ed for his cause as hardliner clerics in the regime even call for his and other opposition leaders (including Mehdi Karoubi) execution. Mousavi said on his website: âI am not afraid to die for people's demands. Iran is in serious crisis. Harsh remarks will create internal uprising.â As a way out of the crisis, Mousavi has put forward a five point plan to the Government for political and social reforms. But he says Iran's leaders must accept responsibility for the crisis and stop its crackdown on dissent. He's called for the release of all political prisoners, more transparent election laws, and a recognition of the right to protest and a free press.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/am/content/2009/s2784149.htm Mousavi prepared to die for his cause]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huge protest took place in Mashhad University. More than 200 students of the Mashhad Open University in north-eastern Iran had been arrested, opposition websites reported. According to the reports, 210 students supporting the Green Movement had been arrested in the last 48 hours. The reports added that some of the students were also attacked by radical pro-government supporters and that two female students with stab wounds were in a critical condition. Several students gathered in front of a police station in Mashhad, demanding the immediate release of their fellow students and were further planning a sit-in-strike on Saturday at their university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/301734,report-over-200-students-arrested-in-north-eastern-iran.html Report: Over 200 students arrested in north-eastern Iran]&lt;/ref&gt;
