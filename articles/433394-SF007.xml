'''Edward Henry Harriman''' (February 20, 1848 â September 9, 1909) was an American railroad executive.

==Biography==
===Early years===
Harriman was born in [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead, New York]], the son of Orlando Harriman, an [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal]] clergyman, and Cornelia Neilson. His great-grandfather, William Harriman, emigrated from [[England]] in 1795 and engaged successfully in trading and commercial pursuits. 

As a young boy, Harriman spent a summer working at the Greenwood Iron Furnace in the area owned by the [[Robert Parker Parrott]] family that would become [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]]. He quit school at age 14 to take a job as an errand boy on [[Wall Street]] in [[New York City]]. His uncle Oliver Harriman had earlier established a career there. His rise from that humble station was meteoric. By age 22, he was a member of the [[New York Stock Exchange]]. And, by age 33, he focused his energies on acquiring rail lines.

===Career===
In 1885 Harriman learned that the {{convert|7863|acre|km2}} Parrott family estate was for sale. He bought it for $52,500 and named it ''Arden'' (now a hamlet in [[Tuxedo, New York]]). Over the next several years he purchased an additional {{convert|20000|acre|km2}} almost forty different parcels of land, and built forty miles of bridle paths to connect them all. His master {{convert|100000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} home ([[Arden House]]) which sat high above the [[Palisades Parkway]], was completed only seven months before he died. In the early 1900s, his sons [[W. Averell Harriman]] and [[E. Roland Harriman]] hired landscape architect [[Arthur P. Kroll]] to work closely with the head gardener and landscape those many acres. It was from this estate that his widow would donate ten thousand acres (40&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) to [[New York state]] to start [[Harriman State Park (New York)|Harriman State Park]] in 1910.

Harriman was nearly fifty years old when in 1897 he became a director of the [[Union Pacific Railroad]]. By May 1898 he was chairman of the executive committee, and from that time until his death his word was law on the Union Pacific system. In 1903 he assumed the office of president of the company. From 1901 to 1909, Harriman was also the President of the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad. The vision of a unified UP/SP railroad was planted with Harriman. (The UP and SP were reunited on Sept. 11, 1996 when the ICC approved their merger.)

At the time of his death Harriman controlled the [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific]], the [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]], the [[St. Joseph and Grand Island Railroad|Saint Joseph and Grand Island]], the [[Illinois Central Railroad|Illinois Central]], the [[Central of Georgia Railroad|Central of Georgia]], the [[Pacific Mail Steamship Company]], and the [[Wells Fargo|Wells Fargo Express Company]]. Estimates of his estate ranged from $70&amp;nbsp;million to $100&amp;nbsp;million. It was left entirely to his wife.

===The Harriman Alaska Expedition===
{{main|Harriman Alaska Expedition}}
In 1899, Harriman financed and accompanied a scientific expedition to catalog the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of the [[Alaska]] coastline from its lush southern panhandle to [[Prince William Sound]]. Among the scholars who joined him were [[John Burroughs]], [[John Muir]], [[George Bird Grinnell]], [[Louis Agassiz Fuertes]], [[Edward Curtis]], [[Trevor Kincaid]], [[G. K. Gilbert]], [[Albert Fisher]], [[Robert Ridgway]], [[Charles Keeler]], [[Frederick Coville]], [[Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh|Frederick Dellenbaugh]], [[William Emerson Ritter]] and [[Clinton Hart Merriam]]. They made the trip on a luxuriously refitted {{convert|250|ft|m|adj=on}} steamer, ''George W. Elder''.

===Interest in Jiu-Jitsu===
Harriman became interested in [[Jujutsu|jiu-jitsu]] after his two-month visit to Japan in 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan_Visit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=HARRIMAN TO VISIT JAPAN.; He Will Take His Family and Be Away Several Months.|url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9805E4DA173DE733A2575BC2A9609C946497D6CF|accessdate=September 5, 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 28, 1905|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Times reported that he brought to America a troupe of six Japanese jiu-jitsu wrestlers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=JIU-JITSU AS IN JAPAN.; E.H.

[[Tsunejiro_Tomita#Harriman|Among many performances]], the troupe gave an exhibition that drew six hundred spectators in the [[Columbia University]] gymnasium on February 7, 1905.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY_Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=JUDO FOR SELF-DEFENCE|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn83030214/1906-02-08/ed-1/seq-5/|accessdate=September 5, 2010|newspaper=[[New York Tribune|New-York Daily Tribune]]|date=February 8, 1906|agency=[[Library of Congress]]|location=Washington, DC.|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life===
In 1879 he married [[Mary Williamson Averell]], the daughter of William J. Averell, a banker of [[Ogdensburg, New York]], who was president of the [[Ogdensburg and Lake Champlain Railroad]] Company. This relationship aroused his interest in up-state transportation and two years later his career as a rebuilder of bankrupt railroads began with a small broken-down railroad called the Lake Ontario Southern which he renamed the Sodus Bay &amp; Southern, reorganized, and sold with considerable profit to the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]].

Upon Harriman's death in 1909, naturalist [[John Muir]], who had joined him on his 1899 Alaska expedition, wrote in his eulogy of Harriman, &quot;In almost every way, he was a man to admire.&quot;

=== Notable quotations ===
&quot;Much good work is lost for the lack of a little more.&quot;

==Legacy==
The [[Union Pacific Harriman Dispatch Center]] in [[Omaha, Nebraska]] is named for Edward H. Harriman. In 1913, his widow created the [[E. H. Harriman Award]] to recognize outstanding achievements in railway safety. The award has been presented on an annual basis since then.

His estate, [[Arden (estate)|Arden]], was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1966.

Harriman is mentioned in the movie ''[[Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid]]'', as the commercial baron whose agents become the title characters' [[Archenemy|nemeses]]. In the film's second train robbery, a railroad employee &lt;!-- Woodcock --&gt; ascribes his refusal to cooperate with the robbery to his obligations to Harriman personally, and one of Butch and Sundance's intimates &lt;!-- the character modeled after [[Etta Place]]--&gt; describes &lt;!--(after the outlaws' initial escape from the specially-equipped train following the second robbed train)--&gt; Harriman's hiring of famed outlaw-hunters to track down the gang's leaders.

In the movie [[The Wild Bunch]], a railroad official named as &quot;Harrigan&quot; takes the same strategy. 

Harriman was also featured in the computer game [[Railroad Tycoon II]], as a computer [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] character.

Two post offices in Oregon were named for Harriman, including the one at [[Rocky Point, Oregon|Rocky Point]], where he maintained a summer camp for several years.&lt;ref name=OGN&gt;{{Cite OGN|7th|pages= 448, 567, 820}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Financial and business publisher Harriman House is named after Harriman.

Harriman was a notable philanthropist, and founder of the Tompkinsâ Square Boysâ Club, now known as [[The Boysâ Club of New York]]. The original club, founded in 1876 and located in the rented basement of the Wilson School in [[Manhattan]]âs [[Lower East Side]], began with three boys. Harrimanâs idea for the club was to provide a place âfor the boys, so as to get them off the streets and teach them better manners.â The club was the âfirst organization of its kind in the United States, if not in the world.â In 1887, eleven years after its founding, the club was incorporated as âThe Boysâ Club of Tompkins Square.â By 1901, the club had outgrown its space in the basement of the Wilson School, and Harriman purchased several lots on 10th and [[Avenue A]], and a five-story clubhouse was completed in 1901. By 1907, average nightly admissions to the club averaged over one thousand.
