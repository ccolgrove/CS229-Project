The [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] term '''Pannonian Plain''' is more widely{{dubious|date=September 2011}} used for roughly the same region though with a somewhat different sense{{dubious|date=September 2011}} - meaning only the lowlands, the [[plain]] that remained when the [[Pliocene]] ''[[Pannonian Sea]]'' dried out. 
It is a geomorphological subsystem of the [[Alpide belt|Alps-Himalaya system]].  The river [[Danube]] divides the plain roughly in half. 
Most of the plain consists of the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] (in the south and east, including the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]]) and the [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (in the northwest), divided by the [[Transdanubian Mountains]].

The Pannonian Basin is situated in the southeastern part of [[Central Europe]], or at the boundary between Central Europe, [[Eastern Europe]] and [[Southeastern Europe]] ([[Balkans]]).
It forms a topographically discrete unit set in the European landscape, surrounded by imposing geographic boundaries - the [[Carpathian Mountains]], the [[Alps]], the [[Dinarides]] and the [[Balkan mountains]]. The rivers [[Danube]] and [[Tisza]] divide the basin roughly in half.
It extends roughly between  [[Vienna]] in the northwest, [[Zagreb]] in the southwest, [[Belgrade]] in the southeast and [[Satu Mare]] in the northeast. 

In terms of modern state boundaries, the basin is centered on the territory of the [[Republic of Hungary]], but it also extends to [[Vojvodina]],  [[Republic of Serbia]], [[Central Croatia|Central Croatia]] and [[Slavonia]] in the  [[Republic of Croatia]], western [[Slovakia]], the [[Eastern Slovak Lowland]]  (including the southwestern tip of [[Ukraine]]),  besides the border regions of northern [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], western [[Transylvania]] in  [[Romania]], and the eastern tips of [[Slovenia]] and  [[Austria]].

==Terminology==
In English, the terms &quot;Pannonian Basin&quot; and &quot;Carpathian Basin&quot; are used synonymously.
The name  &quot;Pannonian&quot; is taken from that of  [[Pannonia province|Pannonia]], a province of the [[Roman Empire]]. The historical province overlapped but was not coterminous with the geographical plain or basin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Pannonia Inferior]] covered much of the western half of the basin, as far as the [[Danube]]. [[Pannonia Superior]] included the western fringe of the basn as well as part of the [[Eastern Alps]], as far as [[Virunum]]. The southern fringe of the basin was in [[Dalmatia (Roman province)|Dalmatia]] and [[Moesia]]. The eastern half of the basin was not conquered by the Romans, and was considered part of [[Sarmatia]], inhabited by the [[Iazyges]]. Likewise, the parts north of the Danube (now in western Slovakia) were not in the empire; they were considered part of [[Germania]], inhabited by the [[Quadi]].&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the English language ''Pannonian Basin'' or ''Carpathian Basin'' are generally not used as geographical terms.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}} Instead, the term ''Pannonian Plain'' is used in most sources, which refers to the lowland parts of the Pannonian Basin as well as those of some adjoining regions like [[Lower Austria]], [[Moravia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]]. The lands adjoining the plain proper are sometimes also called ''peri-Pannonian''.

The term ''Carpathian Basin'' is used in [[Hungary|Hungarian]] literature, while the [[South Slavic languages]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]] and [[German language|German]]  use ''Pannonian'':
In [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], the basin is known as ''KÃ¡rpÃ¡t-medence'', in [[Serbian language|Serbian]] ÐÐ°Ð½Ð¾Ð½ÑÐºÐ¸ Ð±Ð°ÑÐµÐ½/ Panonski basen, in [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] as ''Panonska nizija'', in [[Croatian language|Croatian]] as ''Panonska nizina'', in [[Slovak language|Slovak]] as ''PanÃ³nska kotlina'', in [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]] as ''Panonska kotlina'' and in [[German language|German]] as ''Pannonisches Becken'', in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] as ''CÃ¢mpia PanonicÄ'' or ''Bazinul Panonic''.

In Hungarian geographical literature various subdivisions of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] ([[Divisions of the Carpathians|Inner Western Carpathians]], [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Inner Eastern Carpathians]], [[Divisions of the Carpathians|Southern Carpathians]], [[Western Carpathians]] and [[Transylvanian Plateau]]) are also considered parts of the Carpathian Basin on the basis of traditional geopolitical divisions.

==Geography==
===Climate and natural resources===
Although rain is not plentiful, it usually falls when necessary and the plain is a major [[agriculture|agricultural]] area; it is sometimes said that these fields of rich [[loam]]y [[loess]] [[soil]] could feed the whole of [[Europe]]. For its early settlers, the plain offered few sources of metals or stone. Thus when archaeologists come upon objects of [[obsidian]] or [[chert]], copper or gold, they have almost unparalleled opportunities to interpret ancient pathways of trade.

===Geomorphology===
[[File:LandscapeTemerin.JPG|Wheat field near [[Temerin]]|thumb|250px]]
The Pannonian plain is divided into two parts along the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] (Hungarian: ''DunÃ¡ntÃºli-kÃ¶zÃ©phegysÃ©g''). The northwestern part is called ''Western Pannonian plain'' (or ''province'') and the southeastern part ''Eastern Pannonian plain'' (or ''province''). They comprise the following sections:

*Western Pannonian Plain (province):
**[[Vienna Basin]]
**[[Little Hungarian Plain]]
*Eastern Pannonian Plain (province):
**[[Great Hungarian Plain]]
**[[Pannonian Island Mountains]] ({{lang-sr|Panonske ostrvske planine}})
**[[Transdanubian Hills]] (Hungarian: ''DunÃ¡ntÃºli-dombsÃ¡g'')
**[[Drava]]&amp;ndash;[[Mur River|Mura]] lowlands

Note: The [[Transylvanian Plateau]] and the [[LuÄenec-KoÅ¡ice Depression]] (both parts of the [[Carpathians]]) and some other lowlands are sometimes also considered part of the Pannonian Plain in non-geomorphological or older divisions.

==History==
===Prehistory===
[[File:Pannonian sea01.png|thumb|250px|Approximate extent of Pannonian Sea during the [[Miocene Epoch]]]]
{{main|Prehistoric Pannonia}}
The Pannonian Basin has its geological origins in the  [[Pannonian Sea]], a shallow sea that reached its greatest extent during the [[Pliocene Epoch]], when three to four kilometres of sediments were deposited.

===Antiquity===
{{main|Roman-era Pannonia}}
The plain was named after the [[Pannonians]], a northern [[Illyrians|Illyrian]] tribe. Various different peoples inhabited the plain during its history. In the first century BC, the eastern parts of the plain belonged to the [[Dacia]]n state, and in the first century AD its western parts were subsumed into the [[Roman Empire]]. The Roman province named [[Pannonia]] was established in the area, and the city of [[Sirmium]], today [[Sremska Mitrovica]], [[Serbia]], became one of the four capital cities of the Roman Empire in the 3rd century.

===Middle Ages===
In the [[Age of Migrations]] and the early [[Middle Ages]], the region belonged to several realms such as the [[Huns|Hun Empire]], the [[Gepids|Kingdom of the Gepids]], the [[Ostrogoths|Kingdom of the Ostrogoths]], the [[Lombards|Kingdom of the Lombards]], the [[Eurasian Avars|Avar Kingdom]], the Slavic state of [[Samo]], the [[Bulgarian Empire]], the [[Franks|Frankish Empire]], the [[Great Moravia]], the [[Balaton Principality]], the Pannonian Principality and the [[Kingdom of Syrmia]].

The [[Principality of Hungary]] established in 895 by the [[Magyars]] was centered around the plain and included almost all of it (as did the former Avar Kingdom as well). It was established as the Christian [[medieval kingdom of Hungary|kingdom of Hungary]] in AD 1000, with the coronation of [[Stephen I of Hungary]].

The kingdom of Hungary by the 11th century comprised the entire Pannonian basin, but the changing fates
of this part of Europe during the [[Ottoman wars in Europe|Ottoman wars]] of the 14th to 17th centuries left the Pannonian basin divided between numerous political entities.
After the [[Battle of MohÃ¡cs]] in 1526, the central and eastern regions of the kingdom and the plain on which they lay were incorporated into the [[Ottoman Empire]], while the remainder to the north-west was subsumed into the holdings of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] and retitled [[Royal Hungary]]. Under Ottoman administration, the plain was reorganized into the [[Eyalet of Budim]], the [[Eyalet of Egri]], the [[Eyalet of Sigetvar]], and the [[TemeÅvar Province, Ottoman Empire|Eyalet of TemeÅvar]].

===Modern history===
The Pannonian Plain was frequently a scene of conflict between the two empires. At the end of the 17th century the Habsburgs won decisive battles against the Ottomans, and most of the plain gradually came under Habsburg rule. Under Habsburg rule the region was eventually reorganized into the [[Kingdom of Hungary]], the [[Banat of Temeswar]], the [[Military Frontier]], the [[Kingdom of Croatia (Habsburg)|Kingdom of Croatia]], the [[Kingdom of Slavonia]] and [[Serbian Voivodship and TamiÅ¡ Banat]].

The Habsburg Monarchy was subsequently transformed into the [[Austrian Empire]] (in 1804) and later became [[Austria-Hungary]] (in 1867). Most of the plain was located within the Hungarian part of Austria-Hungary, since all other Habsburg possessions in the plain were integrated into the Kingdom of Hungary until 1882. The autonomous Kingdom of [[Croatia-Slavonia]], which was one of the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]], comprised the south-western portion of the plain.

With the dissolution of [[Austria-Hungary]] after  World War I, the region was divided between [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920â1946)|Hungary]], [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[German Austria|Austria]], and the [[Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] (renamed to [[Yugoslavia]] in 1929).
The borders drawn in in 1918 and 1919 are mostly preserved as those of the contemporary states of  [[Hungary]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Romania]] and [[Austria]].
