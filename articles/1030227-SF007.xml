'''Jeffrey &quot;Jeff&quot; Zucker''' (born April 9, 1965) is an [[United States|American]] [[television]] executive and former President and [[CEO]] of [[NBCUniversal]].

==Personal life==
Zucker was born to Jewish-American parents in [[Homestead, Florida]], near Miami.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} His father was a cardiologist, and his mother, Arlene, was a school teacher.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-wedding&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9402E0DF1F39F931A35755C0A960958260&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fZ%2fZucker%2c%20Jeff | title = WEDDINGS;Jeffrey Zucker and Caryn Nathanson | date = June 2, 1996 | section = 1 | page = 47 | edition = New York | work = [[The New York Times]] | accessdate = June 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has a younger sister, Pam.

He was captain of the [[North Miami Senior High School]] tennis team,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} editor of the school paper,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} and a teenage freelance reporter (&quot;[[Stringer (journalism)|stringer]]&quot;) for ''[[The Miami Herald]]''. The {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|sing=on}} Zucker also served as president of his senior class, running on the slogan: &quot;The little man with the big ideas.&quot;&lt;ref name=Grove&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/04_39/b3901095.htm|title=Jeff Zucker: Life Without Friends|last=Grove|first=Ronald|date=September 27, 2004|work=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before college, he took part in [[Northwestern University]]'s National High School Institute program for [[journalism]].

Zucker went on to [[Harvard University]], serving as President of the school newspaper, ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', during his senior year. As President of the ''Crimson'', Zucker encouraged the decades-old prank rivalry with the ''[[Harvard Lampoon]]'', headed by future NBC colleague [[Conan O'Brien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finke |first=Nikki |url=http://www.deadline.com/hollywood/no-joke-jeff-zucker-had-conan-arrested/#coco |title=NO JOKE: Jeff Zucker Had Conan Arrested â |publisher=Deadline.com |date= |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker recounts how O'Brien lived in the same dormitory and ran the ''Lampoon'', which, he said, made them &quot;natural rivals.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jeff-zucker-conan-obrien-natural-57847 |title=Jeff Zucker on Conan O'Brien: We Were 'Natural Rivals' |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |date=December 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker studied abroad in Madrid in 1983 through [[IES Abroad]]. He graduated Harvard in 1986 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[American history]].

In 1996, Zucker married Caryn Stephanie Nathanson, then a supervisor for ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-wedding&quot;/&gt; with whom he has four children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Carter |first=Bill |url=http://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/09/24/zucker-announces-departure-from-nbc/?emc=na |title=NYT article, Zucker quote as saying he has 4 children. Retrieved Sep 25, 2010 |publisher=Mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com |date=September 24, 2010 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at NBC==
===Researcher===
When he was not admitted to [[Harvard Law School]], he was hired by [[NBC]] in 1986 to research information for its coverage of the [[1988 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcuni.com/About_NBC_Universal/Executive_Bios/zucker_jeff.shtml Bio of Jeff Zucker] from NBC Universal&lt;/ref&gt;

===Producer of ''Today Show===
In 1989, he was a field [[television producer|producer]] for ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]],'' and at 26 he became its [[executive producer]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F20610FE3A5B0C708CDDAB0994D9494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fZ%2fZucker%2c%20Jeff | work=The New York Times | title=NBC Names Executive Producer of 'Today' | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=December 3, 1991 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He introduced the program's trademark outdoor [[rock concert]] series and was in charge as ''Today'' moved to the &quot;window on the world&quot; Studio 1A in [[Rockefeller Plaza]] in 1994. Under his leadership, ''Today'' was the nationâs most-watched morning news program, with viewership during the 2000-01 season reaching the highest point in the showâs history.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

===President of NBC Entertainment===
{{POV-section|date=January 2010}}
In 2000, he was named NBC Entertainment's president.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F4091FF63E5C0C768EDDAB0994D8404482&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fZ%2fZucker%2c%20Jeff | work=The New York Times | title=Network Heat Gets Even Hotter; At NBC, an Executive Moves From News to Entertainment | first=Bill | last=Carter | date=December 25, 2000 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2004 Businessweek Profile stated that &quot;During that time he oversaw NBC's entire entertainment schedule. He kept the network ahead of the pack by airing the [[gross out]] show ''[[Fear Factor]]'', negotiating for the cast of the hit series ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]'' to take the series up to a tenth season, and signing [[Donald Trump]] for the [[reality show]] ''[[The Apprentice (U.S. TV series)|The Apprentice]]''. The Zucker era produced a spike in operating earnings for NBC, from $532 million the year he took over to $870 million in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grove&quot;/&gt;

Under Zucker's leadership, NBC was the top-rated network among the key adults 18-49 demographic for four consecutive seasons, during three of which NBC led key demographics in every major daypart, a feat no other network has ever achieved.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} Zucker also put his mark on the network with ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent]]'', and ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''. He originated the idea of airing &quot;Supersized&quot; (longer than the standard 30 minute slot) episodes of NBC's comedies and aggressively programming in the summer months as cable networks began to draw away viewers with original programming from the network's rerun-filled summer slate. Also on Zucker's watch, [[Bravo (US TV channel)|Bravo]] changed its programming direction towards reality television, seeing much growth with that strategy, while the newly acquired Spanish network [[Telemundo]] was positioned to be more competitive with leading network [[Univision]].&quot;

===President of NBC Entertainment's News &amp; Cable Group===
In December 2003, he was promoted to president of NBC's Entertainment, News &amp; Cable Group as well.

===President of NBC Television Group===
Following the merger with French media empire [[Vivendi Universal]], he was promoted to president of its Television Group in May 2004. Zucker's responsibilities, which already included NBC's cable channels, were expanded to include TV production as well as the USA Network, Sci-Fi, and Trio [[cable channel]]s. During Zucker's tenure, NBC slid from first place to fourth place in the ratings. Shows that Zucker championed such as ''[[Father of the Pride]]'' and the ''[[Friends]]'' spinoff [[Joey (TV series)|''Joey'']] were considered failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/07_08/b4022042.htm |title=Now Jeff Zucker Must Prove Himself Yet Again |publisher=Businessweek.com |date=February 19, 2007 |accessdate=May 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chief Executive Officer of NBC===
On December 15, 2005, Zucker was again promoted by NBC, to Chief Executive Officer of NBC Universal Television Group behind [[Robert Charles Wright]], vice chairman of [[General Electric]] and chairman &amp; CEO of NBC Universal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/facesinthenews/2005/12/15/nbc-zucker-cbs-cx_gl_1215autofacescan14.html?partner=rss | work=Forbes | title=Zucker Named NBC CEO; CBS Tops Fox NFL Pre-Game | date=December 15, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zucker was responsible for all programming across the companyâs television properties, including network, news, cable, and Sports and Olympics. His responsibilities also included the companyâs studio operations and global distribution efforts. Zucker reported to Bob Wright until 2007.

===President &amp; CEO of NBC Universal===
{{Wikinews|US TV host Conan O'Brien rejects NBC's offer to switch his show's time slot}}
Zucker was promoted on February 6, 2007, to the position of president &amp; CEO of NBC Universal, replacing Bob Wright, who held the position at NBC Universal, and before that, at NBC, for 21 years.

{{Main|2010 Tonight Show conflict}}
In 2010, in response to a public controversy over the network's reported rescheduling of late-night hosts [[Jay Leno]] and [[Conan O'Brien]],
''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reporters Meg James and Matea Gold declared that Zucker's tenure had led to &quot;a spectacular fall by the country's premier television network&quot; and dubbed the intra-network feud and subsequent public relations fallout &quot;one of the biggest debacles in television history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-ct-zucker9-2010jan09,0,2371918.story |title=How Zucker's Leno quick fix got NBC into a quagmire |publisher=Latimes.com |date=January 9, 2010 |accessdate=May 14, 2011 |first1=Meg |last1=James |first2=Matea |last2=Gold}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Zucker NBC fell from being the number one rated network to the lowest rated of the four broadcast networks and was occasionally being beaten in the ratings by programming on some of the more popular cable channels.

Days later, ''[[New York Times]]'' columnist Maureen Dowd wrote that in Hollywood âthere has been a single topic of discussion: How does Jeff Zucker keep rising and rising while the fortunes of NBC keep falling and falling? ...many in the Hollywood community have always regarded him as ...a network Napoleon who never bothered to learn about developing shows and managing talent.&quot; She explained that Zucker &quot;is a master at managing up with bosses and calculating cost-per-hour benefits, but even though he made money on cable shows, he could not program the network to save his life.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dowd&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/13/opinion/13dowd.html|title=The Biggest Loser|last=Dowd|first=Maureen|date=January 12, 2010|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=January 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dowd also reported that an unnamed &quot;honcho at another network&quot; stated that &quot;Zucker is a case study in the most destructive media executive ever to exist... Youâd have to tell me who else has taken a once-great network and literally destroyed it.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dowd/&gt;

On June 2, 2010, the ''[[New York Post]]'' reported that Zucker would be paid between $30 million and $40 million to leave NBC Universal shortly after [[Comcast]] completes its 51 percent acquisition in the company.&lt;ref name=NYPost&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/business/see_ya_zuckers_5oBszoRLEkIzFgg7px5IFN|last=Atkinson|first=Claire|date=June 2, 2010|work=[[New York Post]]|accessdate=June 2, 2010 | title=NBC boss eyes $30M+ exit deal from Comcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future plans===

He plans to work for the [[International Olympic Committee]] in [[Lausanne, Switzerland]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Friedman&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|first=Roger|last=Friedman|url=http://www.showbiz411.com/2010/09/24/conan-obrien-gets-the-last-laugh-as-jeff-zucker-is-fired|title=Conan O'Brien Gets the Last Laugh as Jeff Zucker Is Fired|accessdate=September 25, 2010|date=September 24, 2010|work=[[Showbiz 411]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zuckerout&quot;&gt;{{Cite news
