Sharaz is a [[DJ]] and [[electronica]] producer in the [[Bradenton, FL]] area who is known for many national [[remixes]], especially in the form of [[Florida breaks]] and [[breakbeat]]. He is originally from East Chicago, but in 1986 moved to Florida to attend College. His current company is NineFourOne Media and he holds a [[private pilot]] license.

His influences are largely soul/funk but also include: [[Eddie Kendricks]], [[Isaac Hayes]], [[Candi Staton]], [[Otis Redding]], [[Elvis Presley]], [[Zapp]], [[The Stylistics]], [[O'Jays]], [[Bill Withers]], [[Lyrics Born]], [[Sparlha Swa]], [[Slave]], [[Midnight Star]], [[Stevie Wonder]] (pre-1980), [[Al Green]], etc.

Fedde Le Grand went on to win this category with his single &quot;[[Put Your Hands Up 4 Detroit]]&quot;.

Although primarily a breakbeat producer, Sharaz will often incorporate different genres into his production such as [[house music]] and, more recently, [[rocktronica]] and [[dubstep]].

Remixes have been provided by Sharaz for Tommy Boy Records, POD Music, Kaleidoscope, DBI records, and StreetBeat Records.

In August 2009, Sharaz began releasing a bi-weekly online mixcast in MP3 downloadable format entitled &quot;Return to Planet Boom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://soundcloud.com/dj-sharaz|title= Mixcast Reference | accessdate=2009-09-29|publisher=[[SoundCloud]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In early 2010, after a several year hiatus (from approx 2006 - 2010), Sharaz began producing and releasing new tracks again via [[Soundcloud]], [[Beatport]] and [[iTunes]].
