'''Ahmad Faraz''' ({{Lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|'''Ø§Ø­ÙØ¯ ÙØ±Ø§Ø²'''}}}}) born '''Syed Ahmad Shah''' ({{Nastaliq|ur|'''Ø³ÛØ¯ Ø§Ø­ÙØ¯ Ø´Ø§Û'''}}) on January 14, 1931, in [[Kohat]], was a [[Pakistani people|Pakistani]] [[Urdu poetry|Urdu poet]]. He was considered one of the greatest modern Urdu poets of the last century. Faraz is his pseudonym 'takhalus'. Faraz died in [[Islamabad]] on August 25, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2008%5C08%5C26%5Cstory_26-8-2008_pg1_9 Daily Times&lt;/ref&gt;

Faraz has been compared with [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], holds a unique position as one of the best poets of current times, with a fine but simple style of writing.&lt;ref name=&quot;chowk.com&quot;&gt;http://www.chowk.com/articles/12127 Ras Siddiqui at Chowk.com&lt;/ref&gt; Even common people can easily understand. Ethnically a [[Pushtoo language|Hindkowan]], Ahmed Faraz studied [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu language|Urdu]] at the [[Peshawar University]]. He later became lecturer at the [[Peshawar University]].

==Biography==
Faraz was born in Kohat, Pakistan to Syed Muhammad Shah Barq. His brother is [[Syed Masood Kausar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;chowk.com&quot;/&gt;
In an interview with [[Rediff]] he recalls how his father, once bought clothes for him on [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]]. He didn't like the clothes meant for him, but preferred the ones meant for his elder brother. This lead him to write his first couplet:

:''Laye hain sab ke liye kapre sale se'' (He brought clothes for everybody from the sale)

:''Laye hain hamare liye kambal jail se'' (For me he brought a blanket from jail)
He was told by his parents once to learn mathematics from a class fellow during the summer vacation. &quot;I was weak in mathematics and geography. I still don't remember maps and roads&quot;.
 
Coming from a respectable family of Syeds, descendents of ''''Haji Bahadar''&quot; a famous saint of [[Kohat]], he moved to Peshawar with entire family. Studied in famous [[Edwards College]], Peshawar and then did his [[Master's degree|Masters]] in [[Urdu language|Urdu]] and [[Persian language|Persian]] from [[University of Peshawar|Peshawar University]]. 
 
During his time in college, [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]] and [[Ali Sardar Jafri]] were the best progressive poets, who impressed him and became his role models.

===Literary and Political life===
Outspoken about politics, he went into self-imposed exile during the [[Zia-ul-Haq]] era after he was arrested
for reciting certain poems at a ''Mushaira'' criticizing the [[military rule]]. He stayed for 6 years in Britain, 
Canada and Europe before returning to [[Pakistan]], where he was initially appointed Chairman Academy of Letters and
later chairperson of the [[Islamabad]]-based [[National Book Foundation]] for several years. He has been awarded
with numerous national and international awards.

He was awarded the ''[[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]]'' in 2004, in recognition of his literary achievements. He returned the award 
in 2006 after becoming disenchanted with the government and its policies.

&quot;My conscious will not forgive me if I remained a silent spectator of the sad happenings around us. The least I can
do is to let the dictatorship know where it stands in the eyes of the concerned citizens whose fundamental 
rights have been usurped. I am doing this by returning the ''[[Hilal-e-Imtiaz]]'' (civil) forthwith and refuse to
associate myself in any way with the regime...&quot; a statement issued by the poet.

About his current writings he says: &quot;I now only write when I am forced to from the inside.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Maintaining a tradition established by his mentor, the revolutionary  [[Faiz Ahmad Faiz]], he wrote some of his best poetry during those days in exile. Famous amongst poetry of  resistance has been &quot;Mahasara&quot;.  Faraz was also  mentioned by actor [[Shahzada Ghaffar]] in the [[Pothohari language|Pothwari]]/[[Mirpuri]] telefilm &quot;Khai Aye O&quot;.

Despite his deteriorating health, he was quite active in the [[Lawyers' Movement|Judicial Crisis]], in [[2007]]. He himself joined the lawyers to protest against the government, and also encouraged his colleagues to do the same.

===Death===
Faraz died from [[kidney failure]] in a local Islamabad hospital on 25 August 2008. His funeral was held on the evening of 26th, by many admirers and government officials at H-8 Graveyard, Islamabad, Pakistan.

== Samples of poetry ==

A sample of his poetry is:

'''Nazm: ''Khwaab martay naheen'''                

''Khwaab maratay naheen''
                                                
''Khwaab dil hain, nah aankhen, nah saansen keh jo''
                     
''Rezaa, rezaa huwe to bikhar jaayen ge'' 
                               
''Jism kii maut se ye bhii mar jaayen ge''
                               

English translation.

Dreams do not die

Dream are not heart, nor eyes nor breath

Which shattered, will scatter

Die with the death of the body.
