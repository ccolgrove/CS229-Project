'''Clean, Old-Fashioned Hate''' is the nickname given to an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played annually by the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football]] team of the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] and the [[Georgia Bulldogs football]] team of the [[University of Georgia]].  The two [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] universities are separated by {{convert|70|mi|km}} and have been heated rivals since 1893.  While the sports rivalry between the two institutions has traditionally focused on [[American football|football]], they also compete in a variety of other intercollegiate sports, as well as competing for government and private funding, potential students, and academic recognition within the state and nationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Clark|last=Nelson|url=http://nique.net/issues/2004-11-19/sports/2|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929135617/http://nique.net/issues/2004-11-19/sports/2|archivedate=2007-09-29|title=For Tech fans, victory against UGA means far more than ordinary win|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2004-11-19|accessdate=2007-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia Institute of Technology (commonly referred to as Georgia Tech, Tech, The Institute or GT), is an [[engineering]] [[research university]] located in the state's capital and largest city, [[Atlanta]].  The University of Georgia (commonly referred to as Georgia or UGA) is located in [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], and is a [[liberal arts]] [[research university]].  The academic and geographic divergence of the two institutions polarizes the state of Georgia into two large fan bases.

==Series history==

===Establishment===
Georgia Tech and Georgia were founded over 100 years apart. Georgia was founded on January 27, 1785, and Georgia Tech was founded on October 13, 1885. [[Patrick Hues Mell]], the president of the University of Georgia at that time, was a firm believer that the new school should be located in Athens with UGA's main campus, like the [[Agricultural]] and [[Mechanical Engineering|Mechanical]] School.&lt;ref name=&quot;PatrickMell&quot;&gt;{{cite web| last=Mell| first=Patrick Hues| authorlink=Patrick Hues Mell|title=CHAPTER XIX. Efforts Towards Completing the Technological School as a Department of the University of Georgia| work=Life of Patrick Hues Mell| publisher=Baptist Book Concern| year=1895| url=http://www.founders.org/library/mell_life/chap19.html| accessdate=2006-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Mell's arguments, the new school was located near what was then the northern [[city limits]] of [[Atlanta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PatrickMell&quot;/&gt;

The first known hostilities between the two schools trace back to 1891. The University of Georgia's literary magazine declared the school's colors to be &quot;old gold, black, and [[crimson]].&quot; [[Charles Herty|Dr. Charles H. Herty]], the first UGA football coach, felt that old gold was too similar to [[yellow]] and that yellow &quot;symbolized cowardice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ugacolors&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = College football tradition - Official school colors | url = http://www.1122productions.com/tradition/colors/ | accessdate = 2007-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1891, a student vote chose old gold and white as Georgia Tech's school colors.&lt;ref name=&quot;season&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Pat|last=Edwards|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-09-17/campus%20life/7|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070704014842/http://www.nique.net/issues/1999-09-17/campus+life/7|archivedate=2007-07-04|title=Ramblins: Football season brings rat caps and fight songs|work=[[The Technique]]|date=1999-09-17|accessdate=2007-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the 1893 football game against Tech, Herty removed old gold as an official school color.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugacolors&quot;/&gt; Tech would first use old gold for their uniforms, as a proverbial slap in the face to UGA, in their first unofficial football game against [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]] in 1891.&lt;ref name=&quot;rw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/trads/geot-trads.html|title=Georgia Tech traditions|work=RamblinWreck.com|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|accessdate=2007-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia Tech's school colors would henceforth be old gold and white.

===Wartime disruption===

Fuel was added to the fire in 1919, when UGA mocked Tech's continuation of football during the [[United States]]' involvement in [[World War I]]. At the time, Tech was a military training ground and had a complete assembly of male students.  Many schools, such as UGA, had lost the vast majority of their able-bodied male students to the war effort, forcing them to temporarily suspend football during the war.  As a result, UGA did not play a football game from 1917 to 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwiugafball&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/georgia/yearly_results.php?year=1915|title=Georgia Football records 1915â1919|work=College Football Data Warehouse|publisher=|accessdate=2007-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; When UGA renewed its program in 1919, the student body staged a parade, which mocked Tech's continuation of football during times of war.  The parade featured a [[tank]] shaped [[float (parade)|float]] emblazoned with the words &quot;UGA IN [[Forest of Argonne|ARGONNE]]&quot; followed by a yellow-clad [[donkey]] and a sign that read &quot;TECH IN ATLANTA.&quot;  This act would lead directly to Tech cutting athletic ties with UGA and canceling several of UGA's home football games at [[Bobby Dodd Stadium|Grant Field]] (UGA commonly used Grant Field as its home field).&lt;ref name=parade&gt;{{cite book | last = Van Brimmer | first = Adam | title = Stadium Stories: Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets | origyear = 2006 | publisher = Globe Pequot | location = [[Atlanta, Georgia|Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] | id = | pages = 170â175 | isbn = 978-0762740208 | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tech and UGA would not compete in athletics until the 1921 [[Southern Conference]] basketball tournament.  Regular season competition would not renew until a 1925 agreement between the two institutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;parade&quot;/&gt;

===Fight songs===
The [[Fight songs#G|fight songs]], sung at every sporting event, have even been tailored to the rivalry. The &quot;[[Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech]]&quot; was first published in the Georgia Tech yearbook, ''The [[Blueprint (yearbook)|Blueprint]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;rw&quot;/&gt; and was written following the first UGA football game in which UGA fans harassed the Georgia Tech players and fans.&lt;ref name=&quot;rw&quot;/&gt; Hence the infamous chorus &quot;To Hell with Georgia&quot; was written.&lt;ref name=&quot;rw&quot;/&gt; &quot;Up With the White and Gold,&quot; published in 1929, featured the lyrics &quot;Down with the red and black&quot; and even &quot;Drop the battle axe on Georgia's head.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;rw&quot;/&gt; Georgia's fight song, &quot;Glory, Glory&quot; was arranged in 1909 and remains unchanged to this day. Officially, the end of the fight song is &quot;G-E-O-R-G-I-A&quot; but Georgia fans change the lyrics to &quot;To hell with Georgia Tech!&quot; during the Georgia-Georgia Tech game. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antiorange.dawgtoons.com/Sections-req-viewarticle-artid-121-allpages-1-theme-Printer.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927021649/http://antiorange.dawgtoons.com/Sections-req-viewarticle-artid-121-allpages-1-theme-Printer.html|archivedate=2007-09-27|title=Bulldog Spirit Songs|publisher=The Anti-Orange Page|accessdate=2007-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song has even been used by GT against UGA.&lt;ref&gt;http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/tbook/older/traditions/cheers.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game results==

''Georgia victories are colored &lt;font color=#ff0000&gt;ââ&lt;/font&gt; red.  Georgia Tech victories are colored &lt;font color=&quot;#cfb53b&quot;&gt;ââ&lt;/font&gt; old gold.  Ties are white.''

==Traditions==

{{See also|Georgia Tech traditions}}
It is common for Georgia fans to refer to the Georgia Institute of Technology as Georgia Tech University, GTU, or North Avenue Trade School. The &quot;GTU&quot; nickname is derived from the common mistitle given to Georgia Tech in media outlets. Also, since Georgia Tech is an engineering school, Georgia fans often refer to Tech fans as [[nerd]]s, [[dork]]s, [[Techie]]s, or [[Gnats]].  The school's campus and Grant Field front North Avenue in downtown Atlanta, giving rise to the &quot;Trade School&quot; nickname.

A common rallying cry for students of Georgia Tech is the question &quot;What's the good word?&quot; often repeated three times (the answer being &quot;To Hell with Georgia!&quot;) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberbuzz.gatech.edu/tbook/older/traditions/uga.html|title=Traditions: &quot;The Good Word&quot;|work=T-Book|accessdate=2007-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, on the fourth time, will then ask &quot;How 'bout them Dawgs?&quot; (&quot;Piss on 'em!&quot;) Tech students have also created an unofficial fight song entitled '&quot;[[To Hell With Georgia]]&quot;, which is set to tune of [[The Battle Hymn of the Republic]] and refers to UGA as &quot;the cesspool of the South.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-almanac.com/college/university_of_georgia_baseball_players.shtml|title=University of Georgia Baseball Players Who Made it to a Major League Baseball Team|publisher=Baseball Almanac|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school [[newspapers]] of the two institutions often mock their rival institution. ''[[The Red and Black]]'', Georgia's newspaper, usually has several jokes and articles mocking Georgia Tech the week before the [[American football|football]] game.''[[The Technique]]'', Georgia Tech's newspaper, prints a special edition mocking ''The Red and Black'',&lt;ref name=&quot;thwga&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-12-01/campus%20life/4|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070929140447/http://www.nique.net/issues/2000-12-01/campus+life/4|archivedate=2007-09-29|title=Nique staff does Athens in lavish style|work=[[The Technique]]|date=2000-12-01|accessdate=2007-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly refers to its rival as &quot;The University ([[sic]]) of Georgia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thwga&quot;/&gt; The special edition features several articles of parody and humor based on fictitious happenings at the University of Georgia, and is known as &quot;To Hell With Georgia,&quot; after the school's popular cheer. On years where the schools play their match at UGA's [[Sanford Stadium]], ''Technique'' staff distribute the issue across UGA's campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;thwga&quot;/&gt;

UGA students traditionally ring the school's Chapel Bell until midnight following any home football win. However, when UGA beats Tech, the bell rings all night long. Tech has a similar tradition with its whistle. UGA's [[Chapel Bell]] and Georgia Tech's [[Ramblin' Wreck]] have been rumored to have been stolen numerous times by their respective rival before, after, or even during major sporting events between the two schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;wreck&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gtalumni.org/Publications/magazine/win92/wreck.html|title=The Ramblin' Wreck from Georgia Tech|accessdate=2007-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulldog statue in front of UGA's [[Memorial Hall (University of Georgia)|Memorial Hall]] was stolen by Tech students at one point.  The culprits put the UGA and Tech police on a scavenger hunt to find the missing bulldog.&lt;ref name=&quot;dull&quot;&gt;{{Cite document

The game has been played 105 times according to Georgia Tech and only 103 times according to Georgia record books. Georgia discredits two games in 1943 and 1944 (both years in which Georgia Tech won) because many of their players went to fight in [[World War II]], though official college football records include the games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Adam Van|last=Brimmer|url=http://antiorange.dawgtoons.com/Sections-req-viewarticle-artid-121-allpages-1-theme-Printer.html|title=Why is there a discrepancy in UGA and Tech's overall records?|publisher=antiorange.dawgtoons.com|date=2005-11-27|accessdate=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game has been played in either Athens or Atlanta alternating every year since 1928. Georgia Tech holds 4 national titles and Georgia holds 2 national titles for a total of 6 [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|national titles]]. The two schools also have a total of 30 [[List of college athletic conferences|conference titles]] (16 for Tech, 14 for Georgia) between them, making the rivalry a battle between two historically prestigious programs.

The record between the two teams is 61 Georgia wins, 39 Georgia Tech wins, and 5 ties. Georgia Tech's longest winning streak, and the longest in the series, was eight games from 1949â1956. Georgia's longest winning streak in the series was seven straight games from 1991-1997 and again from 2001-2007. Georgia won the most recent game in the series on November 27, 2010, with a score of 42-34.  They now lead the series 61-39-5. The victor wins the Governor's Cup.

[[Image:First GT Football Team 1893.jpg|thumb|The first Georgia Tech football team]]
The first time the two teams met on the football field was on November 4, 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;twq&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/tech_questions.html|title=20 Common Questions about Georgia Tech|publisher=Georgia Tech Archives and Records Management|accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/years/1893.htm|title=1893|work=Georgia Tech Timeline|publisher=Georgia Tech Archives &amp; Records Management|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The then Georgia School of Technology (Georgia Tech's original name) Blacksmiths led by coaches Stanley E. &quot;Stan&quot; Borleske and Casey C. Finnegan traveled {{convert|70|mi|km}} by train to play the Georgia team coached by [[Georgia Bulldogs football under Ernest Brown|Ernest Brown]] in Athens at [[Herty Field]].&lt;ref name=StegemanGhosts&gt;{{cite book | last = Stegeman | first = John F. | title = The Ghosts of Herty Field: Early Days on a Southern Gridiron | publisher = [[University of Georgia Press]] | location = [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] | pages = 14â20 | year = 1966 | lccn = 6627606}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blacksmiths defeated Georgia handily 28-6&lt;ref name=&quot;cofh&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Cromartie | first = Bill | title = Clean Old-fashioned Hate: Georgia Vs.

{{cquote|At one time early in the last half of the game, a stone was hurled at one of the Tech players, striking him a cruel blow in the head... At another time, one of the Athenians drew a knife and threatened one of the Techs' better players... The Techs were also poked and gouged with canes on plays toward the boundary lines... Some of the crowd had the privilege of the gridiron equally with the players.&lt;ref name=&quot;cofh&quot;/&gt;}}
The next day in the ''[[Atlanta Journal]]'', an Athens journalist accused Tech of using &quot;a heterogeneous collection of Atlanta residents - a United States Army surgeon, a medical student, a lawyer, and an insurance agent among them, with here and there a student of Georgia's School of Technology thrown in to give the mixture a Technological flavor.&quot;&lt;ref name=StegemanGhosts/&gt; Hence, the sports rivalry was born.

In 1908, UGA attacked Tech's recruitment tactics in football.&lt;ref name=&quot;1908siaa&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.library.gatech.edu/archives/finding-aids/display/xsl/UA300|title=Inventory of the Athletic Association Records, 1892â1978|work=Georgia Tech Archives|publisher=Georgia Tech Library|accessdate=2007-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UGA alumni incited a [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] investigation into Tech's recruitment of a player UGA had recruited as well.  The Georgia Alumni claimed that Tech had created a fraudulent scholarship fund, which they used to persuade the player to attend Tech rather than UGA.&lt;ref name=&quot;1908siaa&quot;/&gt;  The SIAA ruled in favor of Tech but the 1908 game was cancelled that season due to bad blood between the rivals.&lt;ref name=&quot;1908siaa&quot;/&gt;

The only true break in the series dates back to 1917 and the [[United States]] entry into [[World War I]]. The two institutions felt that the rivalry had grown too intense, fueled by Georgia's inflammatory accusations that Georgia Tech was cowardly because the school continued its football program during wartime while Georgia suspended its program for the football seasons of 1917 and 1918.&lt;ref name=&quot;twq&quot;/&gt; The game renewed play again in 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;twq&quot;/&gt;

In 1932, Georgia Tech and Georgia were two of the original 13 charter members of the [[Southeastern Conference]].&lt;ref name=&quot;secforms&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://img122.imageshack.us/img122/7015/secformed9sd.png|title=North and South Break in Dixie Conference as 13 Institutions Secede|work= |agency=Associated Press|date=1932-12-10|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia Tech would continue its membership until 1964 after Tech Coach [[Bobby Dodd]] began a historic feud with [[University of Alabama|Alabama]] Coach [[Bear Bryant]]. Georgia Tech left the SEC concerning the allocation of scholarships and student athlete treatment. Georgia Tech would later attempt re-entry but the re-entry was eventually voted down. The biggest opponent of Georgia Tech's re-entry was Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;doddbryant&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Dodd|first=Bobby|authorlink=Bobby Dodd|coauthors=Jack Wilkinson|title=Dodd's Luck|origyear=1988|accessdate=2007-03-16|publisher=Golden Coast Publishing Company|isbn=09-3295-809-5|year=1987|month=July}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacking a league to compete within, Georgia Tech helped charter the [[Metro Conference]] in 1975 for all sports besides football (where it remained independent for 15 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;metroconf&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collegehoopsnet.com/columns/kevinmcneill/050911.htm|title=What Could Have Been: Metro Conference|publisher=Collegehoopsnet.com|first=Kevin|last=McNeill|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tech eventually joined the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] in 1979.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutacc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theacc.com/this-is/acc-this-is.html|title=This is the ACC|work=About the ACC|publisher=The Atlantic Coast Conference|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
The Georgia Tech and Georgia [[basketball]] rivalry can be just as heated as its football counterpart.  The two teams have played 186 times with Georgia Tech holding 101 wins over Georgia's 86 wins. The first game between the two basketball teams was on March 10, 1906. Georgia Tech won the game 27-13 in Athens.  The longest winning streak by UGA was 7 games, which occurred twice from 1909â1921 and from 1980â1984.  Georgia Tech accumulated a 10 game winning streak, its longest over UGA, from 1958â1961.  The series is dominated by the home team.  The home record since 1906 is 111-53 (67.7%) while 23 games in the series have been played on neutral courts.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugatechbasket&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Tech All-time Series Results|publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association|year=2006|url=http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/geot/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/alltimeseries| accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Georgia Tech vs. Georgia game was played in the [[Omni Coliseum]] for 14 years beginning in 1981 and ending in 1994.  The series in the Omni favored the Yellow Jackets with an 8-6 record.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugatechbasket&quot;/&gt; The neutrality of the Omni, because of its proximity to Georgia Tech, came into question by the UGA athletic department in 1993 so the series was renewed as an alternating home court event. The home team has won every game but two since the home court advantage was reinstated, Georgia won both road games (2000, 2010).  Since 1994, the Tech-UGA basketball game has had the highest average attendance for both teams at their respective stadiums.

9 other games were played on neutral courts.  These games occurred in the [[Southern Conference|SIC Tournament]] (1921 &amp; 1923),  SEC tournament (1934, 1945, 1946, &amp; 1948), and the [[Gator Bowl]] Tournament (1952, 1953, &amp; 1960).  Tech holds a 5-4 record in these tournaments over Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugatechbasket&quot;/&gt;

Georgia Tech has not won a Men's basketball game at Georgia since 1976.

===Baseball===
April 16, 1898, the first baseball game between Georgia and [[Georgia Institute of Technology|Georgia Tech]], then known as the Georgia School of Technology was played with Georgia winning 18 to 4.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;THE TECHS ARE BADLY BEATEN.&quot; The Atlanta Constitution. Apr 17, 1898. p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The game was played at the newly created ballfields in [[Piedmont Park]] located in the center of the horse race track, almost exactly where they still are today.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20071024133746/http://www.piedmontpark.org/history/history.html Park History]&quot; Piedmont Park Conservancy. 2005.

Retrieved 2008-06-05.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two baseball teams have met 345 times since 1898. Georgia Tech has 148 wins, Georgia has 195 wins, and there are 2 ties in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugagtbase&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Georgia Tech Baseball All-time Records|work=|url = http://www.cstv.com/auto_pdf/p_hotos/s_chools/geot/sports/m-basebl/auto_pdf/07|date=|accessdate=2007-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three baseball games are played between the two institutions every year. Two of the three games are played at the respective colleges' baseball stadiums while the finale is played at [[Turner Field]], home of the [[Atlanta Braves]]. The 2004 Georgia Tech vs. Georgia Game at Turner Field had the second most spectators in college baseball history with 28,836 fans in attendance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugagtbballatt&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Turner Field Attendance by the numbers|work=[[The Technique]]|url = http://www.nique.net/issues/2004-05-28/sports/5/|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929140617/http://www.nique.net/issues/2004-05-28/sports/5/|archivedate = 2007-09-29|date=2004-05-28|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the reformatting of the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA Baseball Tournament]] in 1999, Tech and UGA have hosted eight super regionals - the fourthmost super regionals hosted by a state behind [[California]], [[Texas]], and [[Florida]].  The two teams have met six times in the NCAA tournament with Georgia holding a 4-2 edge over Tech.  Georgia has eliminated Tech three times in tournament play in 1987, 2001, and 2008.  Tech avenged the 2001 elimination by eliminating UGA in 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;ugagtbase&quot;/&gt; Tech and UGA's latest meeting in the 2008 NCAA tournament saw UGA sweep Tech in a two game series, which eliminated Tech from the tournament.

Georgia Tech has currently won 5 out of the last 6 against their cross-state rivals, outscoring UGA 68-34 in those 6 meetings.  This dates back to 2009, where the two teams split games and a third was cancelled due to weather.  In 2010, Georgia Tech swept the season series against UGA, winning games in Atlanta, at Turner Field, and a 25-6 win in Athens.  Georgia Tech continued their recent dominance entering the 2011 year by winning the first game of the series, 15-6, in Athens.  The Jackets and Dawgs will play in Atlanta and at Turner Field to conclude the 2011 series.
