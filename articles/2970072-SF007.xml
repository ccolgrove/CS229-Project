[[image:ace.png|thumb|left|Commandline ACE for [[DOS]]]]
There is a text-based version for DOS called ''Commandline ACE''. In addition to the ACE format, it has built-in support for other common archive format types such as ARJ, RAR, ZIP, and partially LZH. Program distribution contains both Commandline ACE and UnACE decompressor. Both programs are in versions for DOS, OS/2 and Windows, and have support for Long File Names. Despite its name, Commandline ACE contains full-fledged [[Norton Commander]]-like interface and can be run both in commandline and fullscreen mode. UnACE can be run only in commandline mode. Commandline ACE can be used for file manipulation, similar to that existing in Norton Commander.
