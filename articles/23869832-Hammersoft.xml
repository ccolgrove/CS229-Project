The '''Sverdrup Mountains''' ({{lang-no|'''Sverdrupfjella'''}}) are a group of [[mountain]]s about {{convert|50|mi|km}} long, standing just west of the [[Gjelsvik Mountains]] in [[Queen Maud Land]], [[East Antarctica]]. With its [[Summit (topography)|summit]] at {{convert|2655|m|ft|0}}, the massive [[Mount KrÃ¼ger]] forms the highest point in the Sverdrup Mountains.

==Discovery and naming==
First photographed from the air and roughly plotted by the [[New Swabia|Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (3rd GAE), 1938â1939. Mapped in detail by [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] [[cartography|cartographers]] from [[Surveying|surveys]] and [[Aerial photography|aerial photographs]] taken by the [[NorwegianâBritishâSwedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE), and again by a later Norwegian expedition. Named for [[Harald Sverdrup]], Chairman of the Norwegian Committee for the NBSAE.&lt;ref name=gnis14883&gt;{{cite gnis|type=antarid|id=14883|name=Sverdrup Mountains|accessdate=05 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
