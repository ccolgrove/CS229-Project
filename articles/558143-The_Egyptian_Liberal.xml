'''Saad Zaghloul''' ({{lang-ar|Ø³Ø¹Ø¯ Ø²ØºÙÙÙ}}; also: '' Saad ZaghlÃ»l, Sa'd Zaghloul [[Pasha]] ibn Ibrahim'') (1859 &amp;ndash; August 23, 1927) was an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] revolutionary, and statesman. He served as Prime Minister of [[Egypt]] from January 26, 1924 to November 24, 1924.

==Education, activism and exile==
Zaghloul was born in Ibyana village in the [[Kafr el-Sheikh Governorate]] of Egypt's [[Nile Delta]]. For his post-secondary education, he attended [[Al-Azhar University]] in [[Cairo]]. In the 1880s, he became politically active, for which he was arrested. 

==Rise in the Bureaucracy==
Upon his release from prison, he practiced law and distinguished himself; amassed some independent means, which enabled him to participate in Egyptian politics, then dominated by the struggle-moderate and extremeâagainst British occupation; and effected useful and permanent links with different factions of Egyptian nationalists. He became close to [[Princess Nazli Fazl]], and his contacts with the Egyptian upper class led to his marriage to the daughter of the Egyptian prime minister Mustafa Pasha Fahmi, whose friendship with Lord Cromer, then the effective British ruler of Egypt, accounts in part for the eventual acceptability of Zaghlul to the British occupation. In succession Zaghlul was appointed judge, minister of education (1906â1908), minister of justice (1910â1912); in 1913 he became vice president of the Legislative Assembly.

In all his ministerial positions Zaghlul undertook certain measures of reform that were acceptable to both Egyptian nationalists and the British occupation. Throughout this period, he kept himself outside extreme Egyptian nationalist factions, and though he was acceptable to the British occupation, he was not thereby compromised in the eyes of his Egyptian compatriots. The relationship between Britain and Egypt continued to deteriorate during and after World War I.

==Exile==
Zaghlul became increasingly active in nationalist movements, and in 1918 he led an official Egyptian delegation (or ''[[Wafd Party|wafd]]'', the name of the political party he would later form) to the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference]] demanding that the [[United Kingdom]] formally recognise the independence and unity of Egypt and Sudan (which had been united as one country under [[Muhammad Ali of Egypt|Muhammad Ali Pasha]]). Britain had occupied the country in 1882, and declared it a [[protectorate]] at the outbreak of the [[First World War]]. Though Egypt and Sudan had its own [[Sultan of Egypt|sultan]], parliament, and armed forces, it had effectively been under British rule for the duration of the occupation.

The British in turn demanded that Zaghloul end his political agitation. When he refused, they [[exile]]d him to [[Malta]], and later to the [[Seychelles]]. They had employed a similar tactic against Egyptian nationalist leader [[Ahmed Orabi]] in 1882, whom they exiled to [[Sri Lanka|Ceylon]]. At the time of Zaghloul's arrival in the Seychelles, a number of other prominent anti-imperialist leaders were also exiled there, including [[Mohamoud Ali Shire]], the 20th [[Sultan]] of the [[Somali people|Somali]] [[Warsangali Sultanate]], with whom Zaghloul would soon develop a rapport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ward&quot;&gt;[http://wardheernews.com/articles/may/20_Garaad Mohamoud Ali Shire.htm A Touching Glimpse of History and the Reunion of a Somali Royalty]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political history==
[[File:Saad Zaghloul statue.JPG|thumb|135px|left|The Saad Zaghloul Pasha statue in [[Alexandria]].]]
Zaghloul's absence caused disturbances in Egypt, ultimately leading to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene Rogan, ''The Arabs'' (Basic Books: New York, 2009), p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Upon his return from exile, Zaghloul led the Egyptian nationalist forces. The elections of January 12, 1924 gave the [[Wafd Party]] an overwhelming majority, and two weeks later, Zaghloul formed the first Wafdist government. As P. J. Vatikiotis writes in ''The History of Modern Egypt'' (4th ed., pp.&amp;nbsp;279 ff.):

{{Quotation|The masses considered Zaghloul their national leader, the ''za'im al-umma'', the uncompromising national hero. His opponents were equally discredited as compromisers in the eyes of the masses. Yet he also had finally come to power partly because he had compromised with the palace group and implicitly accepted the conditions governing the safeguarding of British interests in Egypt.}}

Following the assassination on November 19, 1924 of Sir [[Lee Stack]], the [[Sirdar (Egypt)|Sirdar]] and [[Governor-General]] of the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], and subsequent British demands which Zaghloul felt to be unacceptable, Zaghloul resigned. He returned to government in 1926 until his death in 1927.

==Family==
Zaghloul's wife, Safiyya, was the daughter of [[Mustafa Fahmi Pasha]], the Egyptian cabinet minister and two-time Prime Minister of Egypt. A feminist and revolutionary, she was also active in politics.
