'''WVVA-DT2''' is the [[CW Television Network|CW]]-affiliated [[television station]] for [[Southern West Virginia]] and [[Southwest Virginia|Southwestern Virginia]]. The station is part of [[The CW Plus]] which is a special national CW feed broadcasting on cable and/or over-the-air on a digital signal. It is a second [[digital subchannel]] of [[NBC]] affiliate [[WVVA]] owned by [[Quincy Newspapers]]. Over-the-air, WVVA-DT2 broadcasts a [[standard definition]] digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 46.2 ([[PSIP]] [[virtual channel]] 6.2) from a transmitter on [[East River (New River)|East River]] Mountain along the [[Virginia]] and [[West Virginia]] state line. Known on-air as '''''Two Virginias' CW''''', it can also be seen on [[Comcast]] channel 10 and [[Suddenlink Communications|Suddenlink]] channel 18. 

===History===
[[Image:Wbb18 b.JPG|thumb|left|Former WB logo.]]

The station launched in late-1998 as a cable-only station with the fictional call sign &quot;WBB&quot;. It was a [[The WB|WB]] affiliate through [[The WB 100+ Station Group|The WB 100+]] which was a similar operation to the current CW Plus service. &quot;WBB&quot; was identified on-air as &quot;West Virginia's WB 18&quot; (based on its channel location on cable). WVVA provided promotional and advertising services for this station. On January 24, 2006, The WB and [[UPN]] announced the two networks would end broadcasting and merge. The new combined service would be called The CW. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents [[CBS|&quot;C&quot;BS]] (the parent company of UPN) and the [[Warner Bros.|&quot;W&quot;arner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]]. 

When The CW launched on September 18, &quot;WBB&quot; was added to a new second digital subchannel of WVVA to offer non-cable subscribers access to the network. At this point, tt began using the '''WVVA-DT2''' calls in an official manner. For a few weeks during the summer of 2007, WVVA produced a weeknight prime time newscast at 10 on WVVA-DT2. Airing for thirty minutes, the show featured news anchor by Erica Greenway (no longer with station), Chief Meteorologist Corey Henderson, and [[Sports Director]] P.J. Zeiggler. It is unknown why the program was dropped after such a short run. WVVA-DT2 continues offering the nationally syndicated morning show ''[[The Daily Buzz]]'' on weekdays from 6 until 9 like all CW Plus affiliates in the [[Eastern Time Zone]].
