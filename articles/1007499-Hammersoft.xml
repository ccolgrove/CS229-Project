'''Clinton Drew &quot;Clint&quot; Dempsey''' (born March 9, 1983) is an [[United States|American]] soccer player who plays for [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States national team]]. Dempsey usually plays as either an [[Midfielder#Attacking midfielder|attacking midfielder]], or a striker. 

Growing up in [[Nacogdoches, Texas]], Dempsey played for one of the top state youth soccer clubs, the [[Dallas Texans]] before playing for Furman University's men's soccer team. In 2004, Dempsey was drafted by the [[Major League Soccer]] club, [[New England Revolution]], where he quickly integrated himself into the starting lineup. Hindered initially by a jaw injury, he would score seven goals in 24 appearances with the Revolution. Since 2007, Dempsey has played for [[Premier league]] team [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] and has become the club's Premier League record goalscorer.  

Dempsey first represented the United States at the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in the United Arab Emirates. He made his first appearance with the senior team on November 17, 2004 against Jamaica, and was named in the squad for the 2006 World Cup, scoring the teams only goal of the tournament. Dempsey recorded the fastest goal in U.S. World Cup qualifying history by scoring after 53 seconds into a 8-0 defeat of Barbados. In the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Dempsey scored against England, becoming the third American, after [[Brian McBride]] and [[Landon Donovan]], to score goals in multiple World Cup tournaments.

==Youth==
Dempsey was born in [[Nacogdoches]], [[Texas]] and, for much of his childhood, his family lived in a [[trailer park]], where he and his siblings grew up playing soccer with the local children or anyone he could find. His older brother [[Ryan Dempsey|Ryan]] was offered a tryout for the [[Dallas Texans Soccer Club|Dallas Texans]], an elite youth soccer club, but young Clint, who had come along, was noticed and recruited while passing time juggling a ball on the sidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=Quite a trip for U.S. midfielder|author=Hairopoulos, Kate|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/soccer/worldcup/stories/060806dnspocuplede.1cd47fa2.html|date=June 8, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2006|work=[[The Dallas Morning News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dempsey became a standout on the team at an early age, but had to quit due to his family's time and money constraints as his eldest sister Jennifer was becoming a ranked youth [[tennis]] player.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Drehs, Wayne | url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=370300 | title=No ordinary background | publisher=[[Soccernet|ESPN Soccernet]] | date=June 8, 2006 | accessdate=June 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; But several parents of his teammates with the Texans offered to assist the Dempseys with expenses and travel, allowing him to rejoin the club. 

He went on to be the captain and high scorer of the Texans and was honored with MVP in the Tampa Bay Sun Bowl tournament. He was offered a place in the youth Arsenal team but because cousin Arya Ashtari was severely ill, he had to move on from the Arsenal academy. Dempsey studied the play of [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], especially [[Diego Maradona]]. Clint was heartbroken when the news came to Nacogdoches that Maradona would not be playing in the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] game played in the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]].&lt;ref name=&quot;espn2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Connolly, Marc|title=Rookie of the year is still a rookie|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=324350|date=February 7, 2005|accessdate=July 14, 2006|work=[[Soccernet|ESPNSoccernet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[Furman University]] as a health and exercise major and a key player for the Paladins. In his three seasons at Furman, Dempsey started 61 out of 62 games in central midfield and scored 17 goals.

==Club career==
===New England Revolution===
[[New England Revolution]] selected Clint Dempsey 8th overall in the 2004 MLS SuperDraft. His rookie season he started 23 of 24 matches scoring 7 goals. Dempsey helped the Revolution to the Eastern Conference Finals and earned 2004 MLS Rookie of the Year Honors. In 2005 Dempsey scored 10 goals and added 9 assists in 26 games. He scored the game winning goal in the Eastern Conference Final on the way to the MLS Cup Final. The following year Dempsey added 8 more goals in 2006 but missed significant time in the playoffs due to injury. He came on as a substitute in the MLS Cup Final but the Revolution lost their second straight final this time on penalties.

On 18 September 2010, he scored an equalising goal on 56 minutes with a header against [[Blackburn Rovers]] at [[Ewood Park]] in the 1-1 draw and continue Fulham's undefeated streak in the Barclays Premier League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9000608.stm|title=Blackburn 1â1 Fulham|publisher=BBC Sport|date=September 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, he scored against [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] past [[Robert Green]], the same keeper that he had scored against in the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/football/competitions/premier-league/7943457/West-Ham-United-1-Fulham-1-match-report.html|title=West Ham United 1 Fulham 1: match report|publisher=Telegraph|accessdate=October 2, 2010|date=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then continued his form by scoring two goals against Wigan Athletic on October 30 as Fulham ran out 2 â 0 winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccer.fanhouse.com/2010/10/30/video-clint-dempsey-scores-twice-for-fulham-on-big-day-for-amer/|title=Clint Dempsey Scores Twice for Fulham on Big Day for Americans Abroad|publisher=FanHouse.com|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/oct/30/fulham-wigan-athletic-premier-league|title=Fulham ease past woeful Wigan Athletic thanks to Clint Dempsey double|publisher=The Guardian|date=October 30, 2010|accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, Dempsey scored another double versus [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]], putting Fulham temporarily out of relegation contention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/eng_prem/9362434.stm|title=Fulham   2 - 0   Stoke|publisher=BBC Sport|date=22 January 2011|accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''

On March 19, Dempsey became the first American to score 10 goals in a Premier League season, beating [[Brian McBride]]'s previous record of nine, also set while at Fulham in the 2005-06 season and 2006-07 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goal.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/03/19/yanks-abroa-dempsey-sets-a-record/|title=Yanks Abroad: Dempsey Sets a Record; Holden Hurt|publisher= The New York Times|date=March 19, 2011|accessdate=March 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clint Dempsey broke Fulham's Premier League goalscoring record by netting twice in a 3-0 victory over Bolton on April 27, 2011. He has scored a total of 33 goals for the team in the Premier League, topping both Brian McBride and [[Steed Malbranque]], each with 32.  With these goals, he has now scored 12 goals for Fulham in the 2010-11 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-27/fulham-beats-bolton-3-0-to-pull-clear-of-premier-league-s-relegation-zone.html |title=Fulham Beats Bolton 3-0 to Pull Clear of Premier League's Relegation Zone|publisher=Bloomberg|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=April 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the season, Dempsey was voted Fulham player of the season by Fulham fans.

==== 2011-12 season ====
Dempsey marked his return to the first team by scoring a brace in the first leg of their [[2011-12 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round|Europa League play-off]] clash against [[Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk]] at Craven Cottage.  Dempsey ended with two goals as Fulham ran out 3-0 winners, setting up a comfortable second leg in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;http://soccernet.espn.go.com/report?id=328073&amp;cc=5901&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
[[File:Clint Dempsey USA training.jpg|thumb|upright|Dempsey training with the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] in April 2006]]
Dempsey first played for the [[United States men's national soccer team|American national team]] at the [[2003 FIFA World Youth Championship]] in the [[United Arab Emirates]]. He made his first appearance with the senior team on November 17, 2004 against [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]]. He has frequently lined up as a [[striker]] due to his scoring threat and aerial ability, but his preferred and more normal role is on the wing. He won the highest individual honor in American soccer when he was named [[Honda Player of the Year]] for 2006, beating Fulham teammates [[Kasey Keller]] and [[Brian McBride]] in a poll of sportswriters. Dempsey received 237 points in voting by 207 sports journalists to claim the award.

On May 2, 2006, Dempsey was named to the U.S. roster for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 tournament]] in [[Germany]]. He was the only American player to score a goal in the tournament&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |agency=[[Associated Press]] |author=Blum, Ronald |title=Dempsey a rare American soccer attacker |work=[[Yahoo! Sports]] |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/sow/news?slug=ap-us-dempsey&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |date=Junecc2, 2009|accessdate=June 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his equalizing goal in the Americans' eventual 2â1 loss to [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]].

In the United States' opening [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] qualifier, Dempsey recorded the fastest goal in U.S. qualifying history with a chest trap and sliding shot 53 seconds into a 8â0 defeat of [[Barbados national football team|Barbados]].  But thereafter, Dempsey experienced a dip in form leading some to doubt his first-choice status with the national team.  However, Dempsey turned his fortunes around in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]].  In the final group stage match against [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], Dempsey scored a trademark diving header off a [[Jonathan Spector]] cross, making the final result 3â0.  This, combined with Brazil's 3â0 victory against [[Italy national football team|Italy]] in the other group match that was being played simultaneously, put the U.S. through to the semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8109905.stm|title= Egypt 0â3 USA |date=June 21, 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate= June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the semi-final match against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], Dempsey scored to put the USA up 2â0 to send them to the finals.  He was named the [[Man of the Match]] for his performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8114585.stm|title= Spain 0â2 United States |date=June 25, 2009|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=June 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dempsey scored in his third straight game in the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup Final|Confederations Cup Final]] against [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], redirecting a similar cross from Spector in the 10th minute to open the scoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8120561.stm |title=USA 2â3 Brazil |date=June 28, 2009|work=BBC Sport |accessdate=June 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the loss, he was awarded the Bronze Ball as the tournament's 3rd best performer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Amelia |last=Templeton |title=U.S. Men's Soccer Team Takes Second in Confederations Cup: Goalie Howard, Defender Onyewu's Head lead the US effort to stop Brazil |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/amelia-templeton/us-mens-soccer-team-takes_b_222055.html |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |date=June 28, 2009|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Ridge |last=Mahoney |title=Emotions tell the tale of dramatic final |url=http://www.socceramerica.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=Articles.showArticleHomePage&amp;art_aid=32945 |work=[[Soccer America]] |date=June 29, 2009|accessdate=June 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He ended the World Cup qualifying campaign tied with [[Landon Donovan]] as the team's 2nd top scorer, behind [[Jozy Altidore]], with five goals in thirteen matches.

On June 12, 2010, Dempsey became the second American (after Brian McBride) to score in more than one World Cup when he scored the equalizer goal against England in the Americans' first game of the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] after the West Ham and English goalkeeper [[Robert Green]] made a major error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/37660344/ns/sports-world_cup/ | title=U.S. strikes back, earns draw with England | publisher=[[Associated Press]] | first=Ronald | last=Blum | date=June 12, 2010 | accessdate=July 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing style==
Known for his toughness, Dempsey played two games with a broken [[jaw]] in 2004 before the team trainer diagnosed it, and upon his return, he played through the pain of a sprained [[ankle]]. Despite usually playing in wide positions, he frequently scores close-range goals and has scored repeatedly with diving headers in crowded situations. His tenacity in midfield combined with his audacious [[dribbling]] skills frequently results in opponents fouling him, and Dempsey has gained a reputation for fierce play. He was suspended by the [[New England Revolution]] for two weeks in March 2006 for a fist fight with teammate [[Joe Franchino]] during a practice game&lt;ref name=&quot;espn1&quot; /&gt; and was twice suspended by MLS during the 2006 season for violent conduct against opponents, including an elbow that broke the jaw of national teammate [[Jimmy Conrad]]. In a similar incident with Fulham in 2007, Dempsey broke the cheekbone of [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] defender [[John Terry]] in an aerial challenge but was not penalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dempsey not a dirty player, says Sanchez|work=Mail Online|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-484991/Dempsey-dirty-player-says-Sanchez-Terry-foul.html|date=October 1, 2007|accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dempsey is a versatile attacking midfielder normally played on the left or right for Fulham  and the United States. However, he has proven to be more of a threat the closer to goal he gets. His goals against Egypt and Spain in the Confederations Cup came almost immediately after being moved to forward by a substitution from [[Bob Bradley]].

One of Dempsey's passions outside of football is [[hip hop music]]. Using the alias &quot;Deuce,&quot; he, along with fellow Texas rappers [[XO]] and the late Houston rapper [[Big Hawk]] from the Screwed Up Click, are featured rapping the song &quot;Don't Tread&quot; in a [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] football advertising campaign for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]] with the intention to showcase both the sport's working-class roots and the United States team ahead of the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't Tread on Clint|author=Carlisle, Jeff|date=February 7, 2006|accessdate=July 14, 2006|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=357903|work=[[Soccernet|ESPN Soccernet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song's video is dedicated to his sister Jennifer, who, at age sixteen, was suddenly struck  with a fatal [[brain aneurysm]]. At Dempsey's request, the video ends with a shot of him placing a flower at her grave.&lt;ref name=&quot;espn1&quot; /&gt;
