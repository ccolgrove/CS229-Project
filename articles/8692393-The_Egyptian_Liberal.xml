==Allegations and Controversies==
===Allegations of Non-compliance with the Judiciary===
Sorour was widely criticized for article 93 of the Egyptian Constituation &quot;The parliament is the master of its decisions&quot;, meaning that the parliament could make its decision about membership regardless to any judicial decisions. This article caused significant concerns amidst allegations that the Egyptian parliamentary elections were repeatedly systematically rigged.  Sorour continued to assert that the parliament is the competent authority to decide as to the validity of its memberships despite the widely acknowledged allegations of rigging &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ikhwanweb.com/article.php?id=27615&lt;/ref&gt;. Following the Egyptian revolution of 2011 Sorour's parliament was dissolved and article 93 was referred for revision.

===Involvement in the Rigging of Parliamentary Elections===
In the aftermath of the [[2011 Egyptian revolution| revolution]] in Egypt (January 25, 2011- February 11, 2011) the  Supreme Military Council, led by [[Field Marshal]] [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]], was appointed to the position of Acting President. The Supreme Military Council dissolved the Egyptian Parliament which was headed by Sorour.  This came following widespread allegations that the elections leading to this parliament, headed by Sorour, were rigged &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cihrs.org/English/NewsSystem/Articles/2715.asp&lt;/ref&gt;. On February 14 2011 the Egyptian daily news Alwafd reported that the ruling military authorities opted to prosecute a senior member of Sorour's team for allegedly burning confidential documents in Srour's office. The same newspaper reported that a restraining order was issued preventing Sorour from entering the parliament building  following allegations of smuggling undisclosed documents from the building. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alwafd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16713:Ø¶Ø¨Ø·-ÙÙØ¸Ù-Ø¨ÙÙØªØ¨-Ø³Ø±ÙØ±-ÙØ­Ø±Ù-ÙØ³ØªÙØ¯Ø§Øª-ÙØ§ÙØ©&amp;catid=98:ÙØ­ÙÙØ©&amp;Itemid=92&lt;/ref&gt;. Sorour is seen among the figures that caused the fall of Mubarak's rule. Some see that Mubarak's mistake was that he has increasingly given too much latitude to his son's cabal, including Ahmad Fathi Sorour, among others &lt;ref&gt;http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/02/2011228022611887.html&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===View Against Pro-democracy Demonstrations===
Fathi Sorour openly supported measures taken to crack down on the pro-democracy demonstrations in Egypt. In a televised interview with Elmehwar TV Sorour was asked for an opinion on the US disapproval of the Egyptian authorities' action: disconnecting internet services in an attempt to halt the demonstrations. Sorour replied that the US &quot;did more than that when it was subjected to terrorism&quot;, portraying some similarity between pro-democracy demonstrators in Egypt and the terrorists who attacked the United States. Sorour subsequently stated that he didn't view the pro-democracy demonstrators as terrorists&lt;ref&gt;Televised interview with A Fathi Sorour, AlMehwar TV, Egypt, January 29/2011&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Allegations of Corruption===
A report published by the Egyptian daily news Alwafd listed a number of incidents in which Sorour allegedly influenced the process of appointing unqualified individual to senior official posts on grounds of favoritism &lt;ref&gt;http://www.alwafd.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18729:ÙØªØ­Ù%E2%80%AE-%E2%80%ACØ³Ø±ÙØ±%E2%80%AE-%E2%80%ACØ­ÙÙ-ÙØ¬ÙØ³-Ø§ÙØ´Ø¹Ø¨-Ø¥ÙÙ%E2%80%AE-%E2%80%ACØªÙÙØ©&amp;catid=144:ÙÙÙØ§Øª%20ÙØ­ÙÙØ©&amp;Itemid=337&lt;/ref&gt;.

In light of the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]], Sorour was jailed for 15 days pending investigations regarding embezzlement of public funds and illicit wealth, corruption and fraud in the most recent parliamentary elections in April 2011.
