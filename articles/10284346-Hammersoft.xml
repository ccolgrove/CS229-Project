An '''Airdancer''' (sometimes called a &quot;'''windyman'''&quot;, &quot;'''skydancer'''&quot;, or &quot;'''flyguy'''&quot;) is a large [[inflatable]] device consisting of a long tubelike sleeve attached to a powered fan blower, which causes the sleeve to move in a dancing or flailing motion.  Simple Airdancers resemble a vertical tube, but variants resembling humans with tube &quot;arms&quot; are also common.  Airdancers are generally about 20 feet in total height and are often used in [[advertising]] as attention-getters for businesses such as car dealerships.

==In popular culture==

*Appeared at the Microsoft 2010 E3 Press Conference as a Kinect demonstration.
