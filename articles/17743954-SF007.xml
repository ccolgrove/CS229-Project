'''Fedora''' ({{pron-en|fÉ¨ËdÉËrÉ}}) is a [[RPM Package Manager|RPM]]-based, general purpose collection of software, including an [[operating system]] based on the [[Linux kernel]], developed by the community-supported [[Fedora Project]] and sponsored by [[Red Hat]]. The Fedora Project's mission is to lead the advancement of free and open source software and content as a collaborative community.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPOverview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview | title=Fedora Project Overview | accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Fedora's main objectives is not only to contain software distributed under a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] license, but also to be on the leading edge of such technologies.&lt;ref name=&quot;SlashdotMS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://interviews.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/17/177220 | title=Fedora Project Leader Max Spevack Responds | accessdate=2006-12-17|author=Max Spevack}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FPObjectives&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Objectives | title=Fedora Project Objectives | accessdate=2007-02-12 | date=2006-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fedora developers prefer to make [[upstream changes]] instead of applying fixes specifically for Fedoraâthis ensures that their updates are available to all [[Linux distribution]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-announce-list/2008-May/msg00006.html | title=Fedora 9 | author=Paul W. Frields | publisher=[[Fedora Project]] | date=2008-05-12 | accessdate=2008-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compared to more mainstream non-Linux operating systems, Fedora has a short life cycle. Version X is maintained until one month after version ''X''+2 is released. With 6 months between releases, the maintenance period is a very short 13 months for each version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/LifeCycle Fedora Project life cycle and maintenance], accessed 2009â04â07.&lt;/ref&gt;  This can lead to trouble should one wish to use a particular version of Fedora for product development (i.e., embedded systems) where long term support is more important than maintaining leading edge revisions of software.

In 2008, [[Linus Torvalds]], author of the [[Linux kernel]], stated that he used Fedora because it had fairly good support for the [[PowerPC]] processor architecture, which he favored at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;LinusFedora&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.simple-talk.com/opinion/geek-of-the-week/linus-torvalds,-geek-of-the-week/ | title=Linus Torvalds, Geek of the Week | date=2008-07-17 | accessdate=2009-08-03 |author=Richard Morris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[DistroWatch]], Fedora is the third most popular Linux-based [[operating system]] as of November 2011, behind [[Linux Mint|Mint]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], and it is the most popular RPM-based Linux distribution.&lt;ref name=Second&gt;http://distrowatch.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The Fedora Project was created in late 2003, when [[Red Hat Linux]] was discontinued.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPAnnounce&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/rhl-list/2003-September/msg00064.html | title=Fedora Project: Announcing New Direction | date=2003-09-22 | accessdate=2007-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] was to be Red Hat's only officially supported Linux distribution, while Fedora was to be a community distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPAnnounce&quot; /&gt; Red Hat Enterprise Linux branches its releases from versions of Fedora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/022aug06/features/fedora_rhel_4/ | title=The Fedora Project and Red Hat Enterprise Linux, part 4 | date=2006-08-22 | accessdate=2007-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of Fedora derives from Fedora Linux, a [[volunteering|volunteer]] project that provided extra software for the Red Hat Linux distribution, and from the characteristic [[fedora]] used in Red Hat's &quot;[[Shadowman]]&quot; logo. [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Wtogami Warren Togami] began Fedora Linux in 2002 as an undergraduate project, intended to provide a single repository for well-tested third-party software packages so that non-Red Hat software would be easier to find, develop, and use. The key difference between the approaches of Fedora Linux and Red Hat Linux was that Fedora's repository development would be collaborative with the global volunteer community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/31767 | title=Warren Togami on the new Fedora Project | accessdate=2010-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fedora Linux was eventually absorbed into the Fedora Project, carrying with it this collaborative approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://togami.com/~warren/archive/2006/lax_seminar_fedora_feb_2006.odp | title=Why Fedora? (.odp presentation)| accessdate=2011-04-30}} &lt;/ref&gt; Fedora is a trademark of Red Hat, and although this had previously been disputed by the creators of the unrelated [[Fedora (software)|Fedora repository management software]], the issue has now been resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fedora.info/redHat.shtml  | title=Red Hat Inc.'s Use of The Fedora Name | accessdate=2009-06-25 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061013141813/http://www.fedora.info/redHat.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fedora Project is governed by a [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Board board] whose majority is elected by the Fedora community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lwn.net/Articles/279059/ | title=Fedora goes to a community-dominated board | accessdate=2009-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features of Fedora==

=== Distribution ===
[[File:PackageKit on Fedora.png|thumb|right|[[PackageKit]], the default package manager front-end on Fedora]]

The Fedora Project distributes Fedora in several different ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/install-guide/f10/en_US/ch-new-users.html#sn-howto-download | title=New Users â How Do I Download Installation Files? | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2009-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Fedora DVD/CD set â a DVD or CD set of all major Fedora packages at time of shipping;
* [[Live image]]s â CD or DVD sized images that can be used to create a [[Live CD]] or boot from a [[USB flash drive]] and optionally install to a hard disk;
* Minimal CD â used for installing over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]], [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] or [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/install-guide/f10/en_US/ch-other-install-methods.html | title=Alternative Install Methods | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2009-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fedora Project also distributes custom variations of Fedora which are called Fedora spins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/CustomSpins CustomSpins - Fedora Project Wiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; These are built from a specific set of software packages and have a combination of software to meet the requirements of a specific kind of end user. Fedora spins are developed by several Fedora special interest groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fedora Spins&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://spins.fedoraproject.org | title= Custom Spins | author=[[Fedora Project]] | date=2007-11-19 | accessdate=2007-11-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible to create [[Live USB]] versions of Fedora using [[Fedora Live USB creator]], [[UNetbootin]] or [[Dd (Unix)|dd]].

Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL) is a volunteer-based community effort from the Fedora project to create a repository of high-quality add-on packages that complement the Fedora-based [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and its compatible spinoffs such as [[CentOS]] or [[Scientific Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (EPEL)], accessed 2009â05â15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Software package management is primarily handled by the [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]] utility.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPYumDoc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/en/sn-software-management-tools.html | title=Software Management Tools in Fedora Core | author=Stuart Ellis | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Graphical interfaces, such as ''pirut'' and ''pup'' are provided, as well as ''puplet'', which provides visual notifications in the panel when updates are available.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPYumDoc&quot; /&gt; [[apt-rpm]] is an alternative to yum, and may be more familiar to people used to [[Debian]] or Debian-based distributions, where [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] is used to manage packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Tools/Apt | title=APT and Fedora | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, extra repositories can be added to the system, so that packages not available in Fedora can be installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/yum/en/sn-using-repositories.html | title=Using Repositories | author=Stuart Ellis | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Software repositories ===

Fedora comes installed with a wide range of software that includes [[LibreOffice]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], [[Empathy (software)|Empathy]], [[Evolution (software)|Evolution]] and [[GIMP]].  Additional software that is not installed by default can be downloaded using the package manager.

Before Fedora 7, there were two main repositories â Core and Extras. Fedora Core contained all the base packages that were required by the operating system, as well as other packages that were distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs, and was maintained only by Red Hat developers. Fedora Extras, the secondary repository that was included from Fedora Core 3, was community-maintained and not distributed along with the installation CD/DVDs. Since Fedora 7, the Core and Extras repositories have been merged, hence the distribution dropping ''Core'' from its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-devel-list/2007-January/msg00091.html |title= Fedora 7 |accessdate=2007-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; That also allowed for community submissions of packages that were formerly allowed only by Red Hat developers.

Also prior to Fedora 7 being released, there was a third repository called Fedora Legacy. This repository was community-maintained and was mainly concerned with extending the life cycle of older Fedora Core distributions and selected Red Hat Linux releases that were no longer officially maintained.&lt;ref name=&quot;FPLegacy&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Legacy | title=Fedora Legacy | author=[[Fedora Project]] | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fedora Legacy was shut down in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.redhat.com/archives/fedora-legacy-list/2006-December/msg00049.html | title=Fedora Legacy shutting down | author=David Eisenstein | date=2006-12-29 | accessdate=2007-11-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Third party repositories exist that distribute more packages that are not included in Fedora either because it does not meet Fedora's definition of free software or because distribution of that software may violate US law. The primary third party repositories, and the only fully compatible ones, are [http://rpmfusion.org RPM Fusion] and [http://rpm.livna.org Livna]. RPM Fusion is a joint effort by many third party repository maintainers. Livna is still maintained separately as an extension of RPM Fusion for legal reasons and only hosts the [[libdvdcss]] package for encrypted DVD playback.

=== Security features ===

Security is one of the most important features in Fedora. One of the security features in Fedora is [[Security-Enhanced Linux]], a Linux feature that implements a variety of security policies, including mandatory access controls, through the use of [[Linux Security Modules]] (LSM) in the [[Linux (kernel)|Linux]] kernel. Fedora is one of the distributions leading the way with SELinux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://w3.linux-magazine.com/issue/69/Access_Control_with_SELinux.pdf | title=Mandatory Access Control with SELinux | accessdate=2007-10-07 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; SELinux was introduced in Fedora Core 2. It was disabled by default, as it radically altered how the operating system worked, but was enabled by default in Fedora Core 3 and introduced a less strict, ''targeted'' policy.&lt;ref name=&quot;FC2 RN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/fc2/x86/ |title=Fedora Core 2 Release Notes | accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FC3 RN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.fedoraproject.org/release-notes/fc3/x86/ |title=Fedora Core 3 Release Notes | accessdate=2007-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Releases ==
{{main|List of Fedora versions}}

The current release of the operating system is Fedora 16, codenamed &quot;Verne&quot;. It was released on November 8, 2011. Fedora 16 is dedicated to the memory of [[Dennis Ritchie]], who died about a month before the release.&lt;ref name=&quot;F16Phoronix&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=MTAxMjg | title=Red Hat Releases Fedora 16 &quot;Verne&quot; | author=[[Phoronix]] | accessdate=2011-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the features of Fedora 16 include:
*Inclusion of [[GNOME 3|Gnome 3.2.1]] desktop
*Updated to latest [[KDE Software Compilation]] 4.7.2
*[[GRUB2]] is now the boot-loader by default 
*[[Ext4]] driver is now used for [[Ext3]] and [[Ext2]] file systems
*HAL daemon now removed in favour of udisks, upower, and libudev
*Unification of the user interfaces for all problem reporting programs and mechanisms
*Virtualization improvements including OpenStack and Aeolus Conductor
*Fedora will now use UID/GIDs of up to 1000 for system accounts
*Enhanced cloud support including Condor Cloud, HekaFS, and pacemaker-cloud
