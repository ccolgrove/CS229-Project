The '''New Wafd Party''' (&quot;New Delegation Party&quot;; [[Arabic]]: ''Hizb al-Wafd al-Jadid'' Ø­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙÙÙØ¯ Ø§ÙØ¬Ø¯ÙØ¯) is a [[National liberalism|nationalist liberal]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Jazeera:Brotherhood&quot;/&gt; [[political parties|party]] in [[Egypt]].

It is the extension of one of the oldest and historically most active political parties in Egypt, [[Wafd Party]], which was dismantled after the [[1952 Revolution]].  The New Wafd was re-established in 1983. It follows almost the exact party line of the former aristocratic party during [[Egypt's Liberal Experiment]] in the 1920s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

In Egypt's last [[legislative]] and [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|presidential]] [[elections in Egypt|elections]] in November and December 2005, the party won 6 out of 454 seats in the [[People's Assembly of Egypt|People's Assembly]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europeanforum.net/country/egypt#2 Egypt Update - European Forum]&lt;/ref&gt; and its [[Egyptian presidential election, 2005|presidential]] candidate, [[Numan Gumaa]], received 2.9 per cent of the total votes cast for president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Mubarak declared winner in Egypt poll|publisher=Al jazeera|date=2005-09-09|url= http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/7B5682E2-3F44-4EDC-B94B-75B28D2D9FDA.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[El-Sayyid el-Badawi]] is the party chairman after winning Al-Wafd's internal election in 28 May 2010 against Mahmoud Abaza, who was the party chairman after succeeding [[Numan Gumaa]] in 2006.

Following the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution|2011 Revolution]] the party joined the [[National Democratic Alliance for Egypt]] electoral bloc, which is dominated by the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]'s [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)]].&lt;ref name=almasry&gt;[http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/493401 Egypt's oldest liberal party faces controversy over alliance with Brotherhood], almasryalyoum.com, 07/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the date neared for fielding candidate lists, the Wafd left the [[National Democratic Alliance for Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/5745.htm#_edn2 memri.org]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Goals ==

The party presses for introducing political, economic and social reforms, promoting democracy, ensuring basic freedoms and human rights and maintaining national unity.

The party also calls for abolishing the [[Emergency law in Egypt|emergency law]], solving the unemployment and housing problems, upgrading the health services and developing the education system.

The New Wafd has tried to place itself at the ideological 'centre' between the main historic traditions in Egypt of Arab socialism and private capitalism. It has been critical of the government's encouragement of foreign private investment and advocated a more balanced approach to the relationship between private and public sectors. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bookrags.com/tandf/new-wafd-party-tf/&lt;/ref&gt;

==1984==
In 1984, Wafd formed an alliance with the [[Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt|Muslim Brotherhood]] ahead of parliamentary elections, but the results were disappointing&lt;ref name=almasry/&gt; as it won only 15% of the vote.&lt;ref name=IPU&gt;[http://www.ipu.org/parline-e/reports/arc/EGYPT_1984_E.PDF Egypt] Inter-Parliamentary Union&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2006 turmoil ==

Early in December 2005, the party appeared in crisis following the parliamentary elections, when party chairman [[Numan Gumaa]] dismissed prominent party leader and vice chairman [[Monir Fakhri Abdel Nour]] following the poor performance the party showed during the elections.

Abdel Nour was also the leader of the opposition bloc in the outgoing parliament before losing his seat in the first stage of elections. Abdel Nour told the media before his dismissal, that the only way the party could improve would be by &quot;changing its leadership&quot;. He also continued that there was much support within the party for such a change.

After a poor showing in the 2005 Egyptian Presidential elections, the Wafd Party split into to camps, with one group demanding that [[Numan Gumaa]] leave his post as chairman. That demand became even more pronounced after the party also did poorly in the parliamentary elections.

Later in December 2005, the party's higher political board reverted Gumaa's decisions on firing Abdel Nour as well as other members. The higher board also elections for its membership and amended its internal by-laws and rules, especially those that give the party's chairman vast authorities in an aim to trim the chairman's political powers, all of which Gumaa has agreed to support.

On January 18, 2006 the supreme committee for the party ousted its chairman Numan Gomaa from the party and from the presidency of the board of al-Wafd newspaper. The committee attributed its decision to Gomaa's tyrannical behaviour and abuse of authority.

It also appointed his deputy Mahmoud Abaza as an interim Chairman for a period of 60 days after which the General Assembly of the party would be invited for an emergency meeting to choose a new chairman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arabicnews.com/ansub/Daily/Day/060119/2006011901.html Egyptian al-Wafd party removes chairman Nuuman Jumaa.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Gomaa contended that this decision contradicted to the party's statute and that he was the legitimate chairman who can be dismissed only by a decision of the party's General Assembly. He responded by filing a complaint to Egypt's Prosecutor General who ruled that Gomaa should be allowed access to party's headquarters. Abaza filed an urgent lawsuit asking that the Prosecutor Generalâs ruling be overturned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egypttoday.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=6348 Kicked out.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party's newspaper, ''[[Al-Wafd (newspaper)|Al-Wafd]]'', was suspended for thirteen days (from January 27 until February 8, 2006) after Gomaa asked [[Al Ahram]] publishing house to stop printing the paper and fired its editor and some journalists, complaining of their allegiance to Abaza's group.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.khaleejtimes.com/DisplayArticle.asp?xfile=data/middleeast/2006/January/middleeast_January870.xml&amp;section=middleeast&amp;col= Egypt opposition newspaper stops publishing amid leadership row.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, 2006, the party's General Assembly agreed to dismiss Gomaa from Wafd presidency and appointed Mustafa al-Taweel (a member of al-Wafd supreme committee) as an interim president till the next elections on July 2006. Gomaa argued the decision was due to an earlier ruling by [[Giza]]'s [[The Egyptian Judicial System#Courts|court of first instance]] to stop the General Assembly meeting.

On April 1, Gumaa and his supporters occupied the party's headquarters to reclaim control and opened fire on supporters of the rival faction who responded by throwing stones. Twenty three people were injured and fire broke out in the building but was brought under control. Egyptian authorities arrested Gumaa and some of his supporters.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=1&amp;id=4365 Political Clashes in Egypt Injure 23&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2010 Party Elections ==

In May 2010, the party's deputy chairman, Fouad Badrawi, the grandson of Wafd's late leader [[Fouad Serageddin]] announced that he was withdrawing his name from the nominations for party presidency to allow [[El-Sayyed El-Badawi]], a member of the party's supreme authority and the party's former secretary-general, to run instead in the party elections scheduled by the end of the month.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.egypt.com/en/2010050510634/news/-egypt-news/el-badawi-to-run-for-egypt-wafd-presidency.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In a rare occurrence in Egyptian partisan life, the elections were conducted in a transparent, peaceful manner and characterized by integrity. At its end, it was announced that [[El-Sayyed El-Badawi]] would be the new party chairman, with the outgoing president standing beside him.
&lt;ref&gt;http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/opinion/clean-election-process-lesson-wafd-party&lt;/ref&gt;

Since his election, El-Badawi has met with many prominent figures in Egyptian life, ranging from politicians, current members of parliament, Muslim and Coptic religious figures and even actors, actresses and football players.

To many observers, the Wafd merged as a much stronger party after this election, which would be counted that would once again attract liberals who were losing grip in the current political map to Islamists and other extremists.

== Role after 2011 Revolution ==

After the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]] forced President Hosni Mubarak to announce that he would step down in the coming elections, the government invited opposition parties to participate in dialogue. The party's secretary-general accepted on condition that protesters would not be attacked.&lt;ref&gt;http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/03/egypt.protests/index.html?hpt=T1 CNN, 3 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Representatives of the Al-Wafd Party joined anti-Mubarak protesters in [[Tahrir Square]] and vowed not to have a dialogue with government officials until President Mubarak relinquished his office.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

On 13 June 2011, the Wafd Party announced its alliance (the [[National Democratic Alliance for Egypt]]) with the [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]], the political wing of the [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[Muslim Brotherhood]], to present a joint list of candidates for the [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/egypts-muslim-brotherhood-forms-coalition-with-liberal-party/2011/06/13/AGQI7OTH_story.html |title=Egyptâs Muslim Brotherhood forms coalition with liberal party |first=Leila |last=Fadel |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=13 June 2011 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executive members of Wafd have criticized the cooperation of the secular party with the Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/470950 |title=Senior Wafd Party members object to coalition with Muslim Brothers  |newspaper= [[Almasry Alyoum]] |first=Adel |last=el-Daragli |date=23 June 2011 |accessdate=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/mideast/RL33003.pdf Egypt in Transition.] Jeremy M. Sharp. Specialist in Middle Eastern Affairs. August 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; As the date neared for fielding candidate lists, the Wafd left the [[National Democratic Alliance for Egypt]].

=== Controversy ===

In in an interview with ''[[The Washington Times]]'' in July 2011, Wafd Party vice chairman Ahmed Ezz el-Arab dismissed the [[Holocaust]] as a &quot;lie&quot;, and the Diary of [[Anne Frank]] as a &quot;forgery&quot;. Moreover, he claimed that the [[September 11 attacks]] were in reality perpetrated by [[Mossad]], the [[CIA]] and America's &quot;military-industrial complex&quot;, and that [[Osama bin Laden]] was an &quot;American agent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=228194|work=[[Jerusalem Post]]|title=Anne Frank a âfake,â says âliberalâ Egyptian leader |first=Oren|last=Kessler|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/jul/5/egypt-party-leader-holocaust-is-a-lie/ Egypt party leader: Holocaust is âa lieâ] by Ben Birnbaum, ''The Washington Times'', July 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
