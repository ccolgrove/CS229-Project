'''Samir Kuntar''' ({{lang-ar|Ø³ÙÙØ± Ø§ÙÙÙØ·Ø§Ø±}}, also transcribed ''Sameer'', ''Kantar'', ''Quntar'', ''Qantar'') (born July 20, 1962 in [[Abey]], [[Lebanon]]) is a Lebanese [[Druze]] convicted murderer and former member of the [[Palestine Liberation Front]]. On April 22, 1979, at the age of 16, he participated in the attempted kidnapping of an [[Israel]]i family in [[Nahariya]] that resulted in the deaths of four Israelis and two of his fellow kidnappers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Samir Kuntar | date=2006-07-13| publisher=[[Israel Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]| url= http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terror+Groups/Samir+Kuntar.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Kuntar was convicted in an Israeli court for murder of an Israeli policeman, Eliyahu Shahar, 31 year-old Danny Haran, and Haran's 4-year-old daughter, [[Einat Haran]], whom he killed with blunt force against a rock. He was also convicted of indirectly causing the death of two-year-old Yael Haran by suffocation, as her mother, Smadar, tried to quiet her crying while hiding from Kuntar.&lt;ref name=conviction_haartez&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/hasen/spages/1001648.html |title=Days before swap deal, Kuntar starts bidding cellmates good-bye| publisher=[[Haaretz]]| date=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Kuntar was born to a [[Druze]] family in [[Lebanon]]. His parents divorced soon after his birth and his mother died when he was a boy. The father remarried and moved to Saudi Arabia, leaving Samir in the care of his second wife, Siham, in [[Abey]], a village southeast of Beirut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://iht.nytimes.com/articles/2008/07/15/mideast/profile.php | work=The New York Times | first=Craig S. | last=Smith | date=December 31, 1969 | accessdate=May 23, 2010 | title=For Lebanese, killer is a hero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuntar dropped out of school at 14 and underwent training in the camps of various militant groups. His goal was to take part in an attack on Israel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith&quot;/&gt;

==Hijack attempt==
On January 31, 1978 Samir Kuntar and two additional militants from his organization attempted to hijack an Israeli bus running the line between [[Beit She'an]] and [[Tiberias]] in order to demand the release of militants imprisoned in Israel. They traveled to [[Jordan]] and attempted to cross the Jordan river into [[Israel]] by swimming. However, before crossing, they were arrested by the Jordanian intelligence. Kuntar spent 11 months in the Jordanian prison and was released on December 1978. He was banned from entering Jordan for three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |

==Raid from Southern Lebanon==
{{Main|1979 Nahariya attack}}
On April 22, 1979, at the age of 16, Samir Kuntar led a group of four [[Palestine Liberation Front|PLF]] militants who entered Israel from Lebanon by boat.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa&quot;/&gt; The group members included [[Abdel Majeed Asslan]] (born in 1955), [[Mhanna Salim Al-Muayed]] (born in 1960) and [[Ahmed AlAbras]] (born in 1949). They all belonged to the PLF under the leadership of [[Abu Abbas]]. The group departed from the seashore of Tyre in [[Southern Lebanon]] using a 55 horse-powered motorized rubber boat with an 88&amp;nbsp;km/h speed. The goal of the operation was to attack [[Nahariya]], 10 kilometers away from the Lebanese border. They named it &quot;Operation Nasser&quot;.

Around midnight they arrived at the coastal town of [[Nahariya]].  The four killed a policeman, Eliyahu Shahar, who came across them.  The group then entered a  building on Jabotinsky Street where they formed two groups.  One group broke into the apartment of the Haran family before police reinforcements had arrived.  They took 31 year-old Danny Haran hostage along with his four year-old daughter, Einat. According to Samir Kuntar, Danny Haran would not let go of his daughter and come with them alone.&lt;ref name=kotesbar/&gt; The mother, Smadar Haran, was able to hide in a crawl space above the bedroom with her two year-old daughter Yael, and a neighbor.

===Shootout and killings===
Israeli witnesses said that Kuntar's group took Danny and Einat down to the beach, where a shootout with Israeli policemen and soldiers erupted. According to the witnesses, when Kuntar's group found that the rubber boat they'd arrived in was disabled by gunfire, Kuntar shot Danny at close range in the back, in front of his daughter, and drowned him in the sea to ensure he was dead. Next, eyewitnesses said he smashed the head of 4 year-old Einat on beach rocks and crushed her skull with the butt of his rifle. Smadar Haran accidentally suffocated Yael to death while attempting to quiet her whimpering, which would have revealed their hiding place,&lt;ref name=&quot;Beyer&quot;&gt;Beyer, Lisa, [http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1218760,00.html &quot;A Mother's Anguish Renewed&quot;], ''[[Time Magazine]]'', July 25, 2006.

During the shootout a policeman and two of Kuntar's comrades were killed; Kuntar and the fourth member of the group, Ahmed Assad Abras, were captured. Abras was freed by Israel in the [[Jibril Agreement]] of May 1985.

====Trial====
Kuntar was tried and convicted of murdering five people by an Israeli court in 1980, and sentenced to five life sentences (one for each murder), and an additional 47 years for injuries inflicted. On July 13, 2008, after being classified for nearly thirty years, File No. 578/79, containing the evidence and testimony from Kuntar's 1980 trial, was first published.&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa&quot;/&gt;

Evidence presented by the pathologist at the trial showed that Einat Haran was killed by the force of a blunt instrument&amp;nbsp;â most likely a rifle butt. The pathologist's report also showed that Einat's brain tissue was found on Kuntar's rifle.&lt;ref name=kotesbar&gt;{{Cite news

According to the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kuntar had initially admitted to bludgeoning Einat to death after being captured,&lt;ref name=&quot;mfa&quot;/&gt; but at his trial, and consistently thereafter, he denied killing the 4-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;Heller, Aron, [http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5gGxpzWERVNq09cHSTuA2GNHHsB3QD91UMDB00 &quot;For Israel, prisoner swap evokes raw memories&quot;], ''[[Associated Press]]'', July 16, 2008.

After his release, Kuntar accused the Israeli government of fabricating the story of how he killed the child.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/middleeast/news/article_1417738.php/Kuntar_accuses_Israel_of_fabricating_story_of_child_killing__Extra &quot;Kuntar accuses Israel of fabricating story of Child Killing&quot;], ''[[Monsters and Critics]]'', July 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment in prison==
During his imprisonment, Kuntar married Kifah Kayyal (born in 1963), an [[Arab citizens of Israel|Israeli Arab]] woman who is an activist on behalf of militant prisoners. They later divorced.  While they were married, she received a monthly stipend from the Israeli government, an entitlement due to her status as a wife of a prisoner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smadar&quot;/&gt;  Kayyal is an Israeli citizen of Palestinian origin from [[Acre, Israel|Acre]], now residing in [[Ramallah]], who was then serving a life sentence for her activities in the [[Palestine Liberation Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Terrorism-+Obstacle+to+Peace/Terror+Groups/Samir+Kuntar.htm | accessdate=2008-07-13 |title=Samir Kuntar | publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; They had no children.
In addition, while in prison Kuntar graduated from the [[Open University of Israel]] with a degree in Social and Political Science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull&amp;cid=1215330995555 &quot;A searing contrast&quot;], ''[[Jerusalem Post]]'', July 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations for release==
Several years later, the [[Palestinian Liberation Front]] seized the ''[[MS Achille Lauro|Achille Lauro]]'', an Italian cruise ship, demanding that Israel release Kuntar, along with 50 Palestinian prisoners, though Kuntar was the only prisoner specifically named. The hijackers killed a wheelchair-using Jewish American passenger, [[Leon Klinghoffer]], during this raid and had his body and wheelchair thrown overboard.

In 2003, Israel agreed to release around 400 prisoners in exchange for businessman [[Elchanan Tenenbaum]] and the bodies of three soldiers held by [[Hezbollah]] since 2000. Hezbollah leader [[Hassan Nasrallah]] refused to accept the deal unless it included Samir Kuntar. &quot;Hezbollah's conditions have become clear and defined, and we are sticking to them in all circumstances&quot;, Nasrallah declared in his statement.&lt;ref name&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3256537.stm &quot;Israel prisoner deal 'not enough'&quot;], ''[[BBC News]]'', November 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian_obstacle&quot;&gt;McGreal, Chris, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2003/nov/10/israel1 &quot;Israel backs deal with Hizbullah to swap prisoners&quot;], ''[[The Guardian]]'', November 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

Israel then agreed to release Samir Kuntar on condition that Hezbollah provided ''&quot;solid evidence&quot;'' as to the fate of [[Ron Arad (pilot)|Ron Arad]], an air force navigator missing in Lebanon since 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kuntar_deal&quot;&gt;O'Sullivan, Arieh, {{cite news |publisher=''[[The Jerusalem Post]]''|title=Arad could alter release criteria|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/jpost/access/532602121.html?dids=532602121:532602121&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Jan+27%2C+2004&amp;author=ARIEH+O%27SULLIVAN&amp;pub=Jerusalem+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=02&amp;desc=Arad+could+alter+release+criteria|date=January 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the prisoner swap, [[Hamas]] vowed, a few days later, that they would also abduct Israeli soldiers to secure the release of Palestinian prisoners.  Hassan Nasrallah simultaneously told his supporters that Hezbollah would continue to kidnap Israelis until &quot;not a single prisoner&quot; remained inside Israeli jails.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamas_vow&quot;&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Deutsche Presse-Agentur|title=ROUNDUP: Hamas, Hezbollah vow to abduct more Israeli soldiers|date=January 30, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Lebanese Prime Minister [[Fouad Siniora]] and [[UN]] envoy [[Terje RÃ¸d-Larsen]] proposed a deal in which Kuntar and all other Lebanese prisoners would be released on condition that Syria declared Shebaa farms as Lebanese territory, the Lebanese deployed troops on the country's southern border with Israel, Israel withdrew from Shebaa farms and the Israeli air force stopped flying over Lebanon, Israeli occupation ended, Though Hezbollah was not disarmed and Hezbollah was not removed from the border areas.&lt;ref name=Lebanon_plan&gt;{{cite news |publisher=Mideast Mirror|title=Diplomatic maneuvers|date=June 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in Lebanon==

Upon the arrival of Samir Kuntar, along with four other freed Lebanese prisoners, to [[Beirut airport]], Kuntar was officially received by the Lebanese President [[Michel Sleiman]], Prime Minister [[Fuad Saniora]], Speaker of the Parliament of Lebanon [[Nabih Berri]], some members of the Parliament of Lebanon, and Muslim and Christian clerics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1215330979803&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull &quot;Kuntar receives a hero's welcome&quot;], [[Jerusalem Post]], Jul 17, 2008.

A public celebration was organized by [[Hezbollah]] in [[Dahieh]] (the [[Hezbollah]] stronghold in [[Beirut]]) where [[Hassan Nasrallah]] gave a welcoming speech to Kuntar.

On July 17, 2008, Kuntar paid tribute at the tomb of [[Imad Mughniyeh]]. Later that day, a homecoming function was organized in Kuntar's native village of [[Aabey]], southeast of Beirut. The ceremony was addressed by [[Progressive Socialist Party]] leader [[Walid Jumblatt]] and the Labour Minister and [[Hezbollah]] official [[Mohammad Fneish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=1&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=94245 The Daily Star - Politics - Nation unites for heroes' homecomings&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 19, 2008, [[Al Jazeera]] TV broadcast a program from Lebanon that covered the &quot;welcome-home&quot; festivities for Samir Kuntar. In the program, the head of Al Jazeera's Beirut office, Ghassan bin Jiddo, lavished praise on Kuntar by calling him a &quot;pan-Arab hero&quot; and organized a birthday party for him. In response, Israel's Government Press Office (GPO) threatened to boycott the satellite channel unless it apologized. A few days later an official letter was issued by Al Jazeera's director general, Khanfar Wadah, in which he admitted that the program violated the station's Code of Ethics and that he had ordered the channel's programming director to take steps to ensure that such an incident does not recur.&lt;ref name=&quot;bd_aljazeera_party&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Al-Jazeera admits to 'unethical' behavior over Kuntar party |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1009383.html |publisher=[[Haaretz]] |date=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bd_party&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Jazeera TV Throws a Birthday Party for Released Lebanese Terrorist Samir Al-Quntar |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1818.htm |publisher=[[MEMRI]] |date=2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bd_party_transcript&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Al-Jazeera TV Throws a Birthday Party for Released Lebanese Terrorist Samir Al-Quntar (Transcript) |url=http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1818.htm |publisher=[[MEMRI]] |date=2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception in Syria==

On November 24, 2008, Kuntar visited [[Syria]], where he met with president [[Bashar Assad]]. Assad awarded him Syria's highest medal, the [[Syrian Order of Merit]]. Kuntar also visited [[Druze]] communities in the Syrian controlled Golan Heights. At the [[Purple Line (border)|ceasefire line]] with Israel, he used the opportunity to express solidarity with the Druze community in the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-occupied]] [[Golan Heights]]: âPresident Bashar Assad has promised me that he will help you,â Kuntar said. âI say to you, soon president Assad will fly the Syrian flag over the Golan.â&lt;ref&gt;Kuntar Visits Golan, Gets Syria's Highest Medal Israel National News http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/128535&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1926.htm Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad Decorates Released Terrorist Samir Al-Kuntar], MEMRITV.org, Clip No. 1926 - Transcript, November 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statements following his release==
Since his release, Kuntar has made a number of statements on certain elements of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

'''Prisoner exchange deal'''

In an interview to [[Al-Manar]], Hezbollah's satellite television network, Kuntar said: &quot;I'm jealous of the Zionists, who don't spare any effort in bringing back captured soldiers or soldiers' bodies. Seriously, we are jealous of our enemy and its care for a [body] and how it goes to the end of the world in order to return it, and of its concerns for captives and how it will go to the very edge to bring them back.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2008/07/18/109519/kuntarcomments Freed terrorist says heâs jealous of Israel], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), July 18, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''New attacks against Israel'''

In an interview with Al-Jadid TV, which aired July 18, 2008 (as translated by the [[MEMRI]]), Kuntar stated that: &quot;There is a disease in this region called &quot;the state of Israel,&quot; which we refer to as &quot;the plundering entity.&quot; If we do not put an end to this disease, it will follow us, even if we flee to the end of the world. So it's better to get rid of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=MEMRI1&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1819.htm Released Lebanese Terrorist Samir Al-Quntar Vows to Fight under Hizbullah: God Willing, I Will Kill More Israelis ] MEMRI, Clip No.1819, July 16â22, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In a subsequent interview, Kuntar stated that &quot;and God willing, I will get the chance to kill more Israelis.&quot;&lt;ref name=MEMRI1/&gt;

In an interview with the French Press Agency in October 2008, Kuntar stated that &quot;The resistance will end only when the Zionist entity disappears.&quot; He also claimed that Israel is preparing to attack Lebanon again and that &quot;Israel is going to suffer great losses. The idea that Israel is an invincible, secure state has become a myth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/news/article/2008/10/23/1000539/kuntar-israel-must-disappear Kuntar: Israel must disappear], Jewish Telegraph Agency (JTA), October 23, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attacks on Israeli civilians'''

In an interview with [[Al-Jazeera]] TV and Al-Jadid/New TV, which aired July 26, 2008 (as translated by the [[MEMRI]]), Kuntar stated that: &quot;To be honest, our operation had both civilian and military targets. Today, tomorrow, and the next day&amp;nbsp;â our targets are always... There are no civilian targets&amp;nbsp;â itâs âcivilianâ in quotation marks. The Zionists themselves define the Israeli as a soldier who is on leave for 11 months every year.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1822.htm Released Lebanese Terrorist Samir Al-Quntar: The Assassination of Sadat Was Wonderful; I Hope for More Assassinations in Similar Cases] MEMRI, Clip No.1822, July 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Assassination of Anwar Sadat'''

In an interview with [[Al-Jazeera]] TV and Al-Jadid/New TV, which aired July 26, 2008 (as translated by the [[MEMRI]]), Kuntar was asked how he viewed the [[Anwar_Sadat#Assassination_and_aftermath|assassination of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat]] in 1981. Kuntar stated that: &quot;[The assassination of Sadat was] a most wonderful operation&amp;nbsp;â to the point that all the prisoners cheered together when Sadat was assassinated. This man symbolized treason and apostasy. Ever since Camp David... Look at the history&amp;nbsp;â Camp David, the 1982 invasion, and then the strike against Iraq... All the catastrophes that befell the Arab world began with Camp David. It was a wonderful historical moment, which I hope will recur in similar cases.&quot;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
