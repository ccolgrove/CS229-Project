==Input device==

The Noahpad's unique input device can function as both a keyboard and a pointing device. When used as a pointing device to control a mouse cursor, it provides a large touchpad surface 70 x 70mm in size. When used as a keyboard, users push down on an area of the touch sensitive surface which is marked with a keyboard layout. Tactile feedback is provided by having the whole pad depress several millimeters when pressed.
