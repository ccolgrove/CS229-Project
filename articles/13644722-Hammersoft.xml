== Early martial arts training ==
Wong reportedly trained in several martial art styles in his youth, primarily in [[t'ai chi ch'uan]] and either [[boxing]] or [[kickboxing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Castrounis1997&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NgFamily&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1990&quot;&gt;Peterson, D. (1990): [http://home.vtmuseum.org/articles/peterson/wongpers.php Wong Shun Leung: Wing Chun personified] (originally published in ''Inside Kung-Fu'', vol. 18, no. 2). Retrieved on 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He abandoned boxing because of two incidents: one with his boxing coach and one with Yip Man.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1990&quot;/&gt; The first incident apparently occurred because Wong accidentally struck his boxing coach during sparring. The angry coach attacked in earnest, only to be eventually knocked out by Wong; the incident caused Wong to leave boxing.&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1990&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayer&quot;&gt;Bayer, P.: [http://www.vingtsunupdate.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=48 Ving Tsun Update: Wong Shun Leung] Retrieved on 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In another account, however, Wong said he had defeated his boxing coach with wing chun techniques: &quot;I was sparring with my instructor and I hit him very hard, he got real mad and came at me very hard. I fought back with wing chun and he ended up bleeding. Boxing was over for me!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VTU&quot;/&gt;

The second incident came about from Wong's fascination with the stories of legendary wing chun figures, such as  [[Chan Wah-shun]] (é³è¯é ) and [[Leung Jan]] (æ¢è´). This interest led Wong to look for a wing chun teacher. Friends of his older brother took him to meet Yip Man. According to one version of events, after defeating at least two of Yip's students, Wong had a match with Yip himself and was defeated easily.&lt;ref name=&quot;NgFamily&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1990&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayer&quot;/&gt; Another version is that after Wong faced Lo Man Kam, Yip Po Ching defeated Wong.&lt;ref name=&quot;VTAA1990a&quot;/&gt; In any case, Wong joined the wing chun group and eventually came to assist Yip with teaching,&lt;ref name=&quot;NgFamily&quot;/&gt; with students including Bruce Lee. Lee once wrote in a letter to Wong, &quot;Even though I am (technically) a student of Yip Man, in reality I learned my Kung-fu from you.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonPeterboro&quot;/&gt; Wong was believed to have carried the letter in his wallet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castrounis1997&quot;/&gt; Perhaps the best-known letter from Lee to Wong is that of 11 January 1970,&lt;ref name=&quot;Lee1970&quot;&gt;Lee, B.

== Fighting career ==
=== ''Beimo'' competition ===
[[File:Hong Kong view from The Peak 01.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Wong taught wing chun in Hong Kong throughout his life]]

Wong became active in ''beimo'' (æ¯æ­¦): semi-organised bare-knuckle challenge fights in Hong Kong (sometimes known as 'kung fu elimination contests').&lt;ref name=&quot;wcheung&quot;&gt;[http://www.cheungswingchun.com/g/906/grandmaster-william-cheung.html Grandmaster William Cheung] Retrieved on 5 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; There were no rules, protective equipment, or time limits.&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonPeterboro&quot;/&gt; As Wong recalled in an interview, &quot;When I competed, it was in secret.

Wong was said to have faced opponents from many disciplinesâ&quot;virtually every style of martial art in the colony.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Peterson1990&quot;/&gt; He defeated many opponents in ''beimo'' matches in Hong Kong between the ages of 17 and 32, and his reputation grew as he continued winning these matches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Castrounis1997&quot;/&gt; Some have attributed wing chun's fame in Hong Kong to Wong's ''beimo'' reputation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smith2006&quot;/&gt;

Students from different schools sometimes visited each other's schools and issued challenge to their top students and instructors. If a student was able to beat the main teacher or master of a particular school, the school would close down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Montaigue&quot;/&gt; According to some of Yip's first-generation students, Wong &quot;reputedly 'closed down' quite a number of schools in that way.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Montaigue&quot;/&gt; Reportedly, Wong won most of these contests within a few punches.&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonPeterboro&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cebridge2003&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin2004&quot;&gt;Martin, M.

Wong claimed that his hands were faster acting than Lee's, however Bruce retaliated by saying his kicks were much faster, thus provoking the friendly scuffle. Wan commented that Lee's kicks were fast and powerful whilst Wong's wing chun hand techniques were modified and practical.

== Filmography ==
=== Enter the Dragon ===
Some sources claim that Wong choreographed some fight scenes in ''[[Enter the Dragon]]'' (é¾ç­èé¬¥), saying that &quot;... when shooting ''Enter the Dragon'' in Hong Kong, he [Bruce Lee] invited Wong to come on location to discuss the fight scenes&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonPeterboro&quot;/&gt; and that &quot;Wong in fact had been invited to choreograph some of the fight scenes in ''Enter the Dragon''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSLVTAUK&quot;/&gt; The documentary ''Dragon since 1973'' consists of  interviews with various Hong Kong personalities, mostly those who worked with Lee in his [[Golden Harvest]] days. None of the interviewees, including Bee Chan (é³ææ¯; one of Lee's most trusted assistants),  [[Shek Kin]] (ç³å ), and Chaplin Chang (å¼µæ¬½éµ¬), mentioned that Wong had been invited to work as a fight scene choreographer for ''Enter the Dragon''.&lt;ref name=&quot;DragonSince1973&quot;&gt;[http://www.artoftoy.com/drsi19.html é¾ä¸ä¹ä¸ä¸ä»¥å¾] (''Dragon since 1973''). Retrieved on 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
A photograph of Wong, Lee, and [[Raymond Chow]] (éææ) on one of the sets of ''Enter the Dragon'' (the weapon room) implies that Wong was present during filming.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSLVTAUK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bayer&quot;/&gt; Wong appears in the same clothing in that photograph as he wears in the footage of himself sparring with an extra on that particular set,&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDbBruceLeeLegend&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075788/ IMDb: Bruce Lee, the Legend] Retrieved on 7 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus could have been from the time when Wong attended a screen test for ''Game of Death'', as described below.

=== Game of Death ===
Wong received an invitation to appear in ''[[Game of Death]]'' (æ­»äº¡éæ²), but declined. He was scheduled to attend a screen test on the set of ''Enter the Dragon'' after Bruce Lee had finished shooting the film and was working on dubbing. Lee returned to Hong Kong from his last trip to the United States of America in late May 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li1998&quot;/&gt; Thus, Wong would have attended the screen test sometime in June 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDbBruceLeeLegend&quot;/&gt; Wong recalled, &quot;About two months before he (Bruce Lee) died he gave me a phone call ... After this he left Hong Kong to settle his film business. When he came back, he called me up and wanted me to participate in the making of ''Game of Death''. He had also invited me to the studio to attend a screen test. I did not promise to act in the film, yet I still went to attend the screen test to please him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wong2&quot;&gt;Wong, S. L.: [http://web.ukonline.co.uk/ray.d8/article13.html Wong Shun Leung on Bruce Lee] Retrieved on 7 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1986 interview, Wong said, &quot;I told him (Bruce Lee) that I didn't want to go and die in my first movie! ... I wasn't in dire financial straits at the time, so I didn't have to do the film (just) to make money.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonPeterboro&quot;/&gt; The role of Lee's final opponent was thus played by basketball star Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.&lt;ref name=&quot;PetersonPeterboro&quot;/&gt; In another interview, Wong said, &quot;It was for ''Game of Death'', but I declined because I thought that the moves of Wing Chun style wouldnât look good on film. I think the Wing Chun method is ugly for movies but very good and very logical for real fighting.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VTU&quot;/&gt;

=== Later film work ===
In 1973, shortly after Bruce Lee's death, Wong acted in ''Life and Legend of Bruce Lee''. In this Chinese film, Wong played the role of himself, an instructor at Yip Man's wing chun school who first met a teenager named Lee in the 1950s.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDbLifeLegend&quot;/&gt; In the 1993 documentary film ''Death by Misadventure'', Wong talked about his experiences with Lee.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDbDeathByMisadventure&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0121193/ IMDb: Death by Misadventure] Retrieved on 8 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He also starred in a training video, entitled ''Wing Chun: the Science of In-fighting'', which was produced in the early 1980s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cebridge2003&quot;/&gt;

== Legacy ==

Wong's participation in, and views on, tournaments reflected his philosophy on martial arts. When asked, &quot;Did you compete in any organised tournaments with rules?&quot; Wong replied, &quot;Not in boxing. When I competed, it was in secret. We went into a room, and the door was shut and there were no rules. The government did not allow them. They were illegal, but we didn't care. We fought until the other guy was knocked out.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poon&quot;/&gt; When asked, &quot;Did you ever consider competing in combat sports?&quot; Wong replied, &quot;I have always liked boxing, I like anything about fighting, but my kind of fighting is not the sport version, it is real fighting where there are no rules.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;VTU&quot;/&gt;
