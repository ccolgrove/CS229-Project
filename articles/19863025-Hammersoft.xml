===Before independence===

The history of sports in India dates back to the Vedic era. Physical culture in ancient India was fed by a powerful fuel: religious rights.
There were some well-defined values like the mantra in the Atharva-Veda, saying,&quot; Duty is in my right hand and the fruits of victory in my left&quot;. In terms of an ideal, these words hold the same sentiments as the traditional Olympic oath: &quot;For the Honour of my Country and the Glory of Sport.&quot;

Badminton probably originated in India as a grownup's version of a very old children's game known in England as battledore and shuttlecock, the battledore being a paddle and the shuttlecock a small feathered cork, now usually called a &quot;bird.&quot;

Games like chess, [[snakes and ladders]], playing cards, and polo had originated as sports in India and it was from here that these games were transmitted to foreign countries, where they were further modernized.

===After independence===

After the IX Asian Games in [[New Delhi]] in 1982, the capital city now has modern sports facilities. Such facilities are also being developed in other parts of the country. Besides sports and games included in the international sporting agenda, there are many which have developed indigenously. Among these are Wrestling and several traditional systems of [[Martial arts]]. The Ministry of Youth Affairs  &amp; Sports was initially set up as the Department of Sports in 1982 at the time of organisation of the IX Asian Games in New Delhi.  Its name was changed to the Department of Youth affairs  &amp; sports during celebration of the International Youth Year, 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yas.nic.in/index.asp?layid=2 |title=Department of Sports |publisher=YAS |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India has hosted or co-hosted several international sporting events, such as the [[1951 Asian Games|1951]] and the [[1982 Asian Games]], the [[1987 Cricket World Cup|1987]] and [[1996 Cricket World Cup]], the [[2003 Afro-Asian Games]], the [[2010 Men's Hockey World Cup|2010 Hockey World Cup]] and the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]. Major international sporting events annually held in India include the [[Chennai Open]], [[Mumbai Marathon]] and the [[Indian Masters]]. The country hosted the [[2011 Cricket World Cup]] and the first [[Indian Grand Prix]] in 2011.

== Administration and funding ==

Political responsibility for sport in India is with the [[Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports (India)|Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports]] which is headed by a cabinet minister and managed by National Sport Federations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yas.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/8940703031.htm |title=S |publisher=Yas.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sports Authority of India]] the field arm of the Ministry , supports and nurtures talent in youth, and provides them with requisite infrastructure, equipment, coaching facilities and competition exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in/ |title=Sports Authority of India, Ministry of Youth Affairs and Sports - Government of India |publisher=Sportsauthorityofindia.nic.in |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorabji Tata]] with the support of Dr.A.G.Noehren then Director of [[YMCA]] established the [[Indian Olympic Association]] in 1927. IOA  is responsible for the Indian contingentâs participation in the [[Olympic Games]], [[Commonwealth Games]], [[Asian Games]](Outdoor-Indoor-Beach) and [[South Asian Games]]. Each Olympic and Non-Olympic Sport has a Federation at the National level .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olympic.ind.in/ioa_history.html |title=Indian Olympic Association |publisher=Olympic.ind.in |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The selection of the National teams is done by the respective National Federations and then recommend to IOA for official sponsorship for participation in the Games being conducted under the auspicious of the [[International Olympic Committee]], [[Olympic Council of Asia]], [[Commonwealth Games Federation]] and SAG. A special feature of the Indian Olympic Association is that, the National Federations and the State Olympic Associations are affiliated/recognised to it.  The main task of the State Olympic Associations is to Promote the Olympic Sport and to ensure coordination among the State Sports Associations. In 2010-11, total Budget for sports and physical education schemes is 3117.69 crore rupees.&lt;ref&gt;http://yas.nic.in/writereaddata/linkimages/6831719428.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Hockey, in which India has an impressive record with eight Olympic gold medals, is officially the national sport. The [[Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna]] and the [[Arjuna Award]] are India's highest awards for achievements in sports, while the [[Dronacharya Award]] is awarded for excellence in coaching.

[[India]] first participated at the [[Olympic Games]] in 1900, with a lone athlete ([[Norman Pritchard]]) winning two medals in [[athletics (sport)|athletics]].  The nation first sent a team to the [[Summer Olympic Games]] in 1920, and has participated in every Summer Games since then.  India has also competed at several [[Winter Olympic Games]] since 1964.India had won total 20 medals at [[Olympic Games]]. India won its first gold medal in Men's [[Field hockey]] in  [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam]] [[Olympic Games]]. [[Abhinav Bindra]] became the first Indian to win an individual gold medal at the [[Olympic Games]] and India's first gold medal since [[1980 Moscow Olympics|1980]], when the [[India national field hockey team|Men's Field Hockey Team]] won the gold.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff_abhinav_wins&quot;&gt;

India is remarkable among nations for having won very few Olympic medals despite a population exceeding a billion, around half of them under the age of 25. Numerous explanations have been offered for the dearth, including poverty, malnutrition, neglected infrastructure, the lack of sponsorship, the theft of money and equipment, political corruption, institutional disorganisation, social immobility, the predominance of cricket and other cultural
factors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/12/sports/olympics/12indiagold.html?ref=olympics New York Times: With Indiaâs First Gold, Suddenly a Billion People Notice the Olympics]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportstaronnet.com/tss2738/stories/20040918005300800.htmThe mystery of the missing medals]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/jul/25/india.olympicgames2008 Track and failed: the making of a sleeping Olympic giant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/sports/2008/aug/04rajeev.htm Olympic machismo: The tale the medals tell]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several informal statistics, India is the country in the world with the lowest number of total Olympic medals per capita (of those countries those have actually won at least one medal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Olympic Medals/Population |url=http://www.photius.com/rankings/medals2.html |publisher=Photius Coutsoukis |accessdate=2008-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Per Capita Olympic Medal Table  |url=http://users.skynet.be/hermandw/olymp/reloly.html |accessdate=2008-08-20 |publisher=Herman de Wael }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polo===
[[File:Polo jaipur.jpg|thumb|upright=0.56|alt=Fullright|]]

India is considered the cradle of modern polo.  Babar, the founder of the Mughal dynasty in the 15th century, firmly established its popularity. The period between the decline of the Mughal dynasty and the upsurgence of the British Imperial rule, Polo almost vanished from the mainland India. Fortunately  the game survived in a few remote mountainous enclaves of the subcontinent, notably Gilgit, Chitral, Ladakh and Manipur.

In India, the popularity of polo has waned and risen many time. However, it has never lost its regal status. In the last few decades, the emergence of privately owned teams has ensured a renaissance in Indian polo. Today, polo is not just restricted to the royalty and the Indian Army

The Table Tennis Federation of India is the official sports body. India, which is currently ranked 30 in the world, has produced a single player ranked in the top 50, Sharat Kamal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ittf.com/ittf_ranking/ittf_team_ranking.html|title=Team Ranking |publisher=ittf.com|date= |accessdate=2010-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

India has been represented at the Olympics twice, by Wing Commander I.J.Lamba, and Imtiaz Anees.

===Kayaking===
====Flat water and sea kayaking====

Indian flat water kayakers are emerging powerhouse in the Asian circuit. Aside from professional flat water[[kayaking]], there is very limited recreational kayaking. Potential to generate interest in flat water kayaking is held by leisure resorts located near the sea or other water bodies. But more often than not, Indian tourists consider kayaking a one-time activity and not a sport to be pursued.

====Whitewater kayaking====

Whitewater kayaking has its rabid enthusiasts concentrated in the north towards Himalayas and some in the south in Bangalore in Karnataka. Most of these enthusiasts are or were Whitewater Raft guides who took to the sport of whitewater kayaking. Some of the prominent whitewater kayakers include Abhinav Kala, Shalabh Gahlaut and John Pollard. Many of them have notched first descents (similar to Climbing Ascents) on rivers in India and Nepal.

'Bangalore Kayakers' are India's first amateur group of white water kayakers.  Based out Bangalore, they currently explore rivers around Western Ghats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/#!/group.php?gid=149952787372&amp;ref=ts |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date= |accessdate=2010-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gear availability is another problem that plagues the sportsmen and sportswomen. While the global designs for whitewater boats and paddles change annually, Indian kayakers have to pay high fees if they want to import any kind of gear or they have to buy used gear in Nepal. More often than not, one will see Indian kayaking guides riding down the river in a Perception Amp or Piroutte or Dancer kind of design while the kayakers from abroad in their new design, planing hull, centered volume kayaks from Riot, Pyranha or Wave Sport.Due to increasing media coverage, more people do kayaking every season.

===Mountain biking===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:2010cg logo.png|thumb|200px|[[Delhi]] will host the [[2010 Commonwealth Games]]; the second-largest multi-sport event in the world.]] --&gt;
[[Mountain biking]] is becoming a popular sport. For the last six years, [[Mtb himachal|MTB Himachal]] has been organized regularly by HASTPA, an NGO. It is attended by a number of national and international participants, such as Indian Army, Indian Air Force, ITBP and a number of young and energetic MTB individual riders from cities like Pune, Bangalore, Delhi and Chandigarh. Last year, the government of Sikkim (Department of Tourism) introduced its own MTB race with South East Asia's biggest prize money.  The second edition saw 48 professional participants from across the globe.

===Rock climbing===

Rock or technical climbing has been around in India since a long time.  Presumably, the mountaineers headed for Himalayan ascents had to train somewhere, and would have imparted some of the initial technical climbing culture.  Documented evidence of rock climbing is associated with bouldering and climbing around Bangalore's famous Ramanagaram crags and Turahalli boulders, around Western Ghats closer to Mumbai and Pune.

Dinesh KS (Dinni) of [[Wildcraft]] Equipment was climbing in Bangalore around 1980s as part of a continuing tradition of climbing around the area.

Deccan and south of Vindhyas in India are considered the prime locations for rock climbing in India today.  More for reason that there is an established climbing tradition associated with Mumbai, Pune and Bangalore.  For example, Hampi is considered the bouldering capital of India.  Climbers congregate here during New Years eve and climb through the weeks preceding and after.  Badami is considered highly for its free and sport routes (numbering over 200).

While the nature of the sport is more of a non-competitive adventurous kind, the competitive version, i.e. sport climbing has many adherents, and has a very intense scene.  Indians have notched quite a few international positions in sport climbing and are considered an Asian powerhouse.

Some of the more popular locations for sport climbing include, [[Mumbai]], [[Delhi]], [[Bangalore]], Kangla Wall of MMTA (Manipur) [[Shillong]], [[Kolkata]] and [[Indore]].  For locations to climb in India, see [[Climbing locations in India]].

In the present time, archery in India has emerged as a sport with considerable recognition and has managed to score success.

===Athletics and triathlon===

In India, athletics has come a long way since the initial years, but it still is a minor sport in India. Even though Indian athletics has witnessed improvements in terms of facilities and infrastructure, the general standard of competition still leaves scope for a lot of improvement. However, some athletes like Anju Bobby George, Jyotirmoyee Sikdar, Milkha Singh, Norman Pritchard, P. T. Usha and T. C.
