{{Property law}}

'''Ownership''' is the state or fact of exclusive [[rights]] and control over [[property]], which may be an [[personal property|object]], [[land ownership|land/real estate]] or [[intellectual property]]. Ownership involves multiple rights, collectively referred to as [[title (property)|title]], which may be separated and held by different parties.  The concept of ownership has existed for thousands of years and in all cultures. Over the millennia, however, and across cultures what is considered eligible to be property and how that property is regarded culturally is very different. Ownership is the basis for many other concepts that form the foundations of ancient and modern societies such as [[money]], [[trade]], [[debt]], [[bankruptcy]], the [[criminality]] of [[theft]] and private vs. public property. Ownership is the key building block in the development of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] socio-economic system.

The process and mechanics of ownership are fairly complex since one can gain, transfer and lose ownership of property in a number of ways. To acquire property one can purchase it with money, trade it for other property, receive it as a [[gift]], steal it, [[Discovery (observation)|find]] it, [[Manufacturing|make]] it or [[Homestead principle|homestead]] it. One can transfer or lose ownership of property by [[sell]]ing it for money, [[exchange|exchanging]] it for other property, giving it as a gift, being robbed of it, [[loss|misplacing]] it, or having it stripped from one's ownership through legal means such as [[eviction]], [[foreclosure]], [[Search and seizure|seizure]] or [[taking]]. Ownership is self-propagating in that the owner of any property will also own the economic benefits of that property.

==Types of owners==
===In person===
Individuals may own property directly. In some societies only adult men may own property{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}; in other societies (such as the [[Haudenosaunee]]), property is [[matrilinear]] and passed on from mother to the offspring{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. In most societies both men and women can own property with no restrictions and limitations at all.

===Structured ownership entities===
Throughout history, nations (or governments) and religious organizations have owned property. These entities exist primarily for other purposes than to own or operate property, hence they may have no clear rules regarding the disposition of their property.

To own and operate property, structures (often known today as [[legal person|legal entities]]) have been created in many societies throughout history. The differences in how they deal with members' rights is a key factor in determining their type. Each type has advantages and disadvantages derived from their means of recognizing or disregarding (rewarding or not), contributions of financial capital or personal effort.

Cooperatives, corporations, trusts, partnerships, condominium associations are only some of the many varied types of structured ownership; each type has many subtypes. Legal advantages or restrictions on various types of structured ownership have existed in many societies past and present. To govern how assets are to be used, shared or treated, rules and regulations may be legally imposed or internally adopted or decreed.

====Liability for the group or for others in the group====
Ownership implies responsibility, for actions regarding the property. A &quot;legal shield&quot; is said to exist if the entity's legal liabilities do not get redistributed among the entity's owners or members. An application of this, to limit ownership risks, is to form a new entity to purchase, own and operate each property. Since the entity is separate and distinct from others, if a problem occurs which leads to a massive liability, the individual is protected from losing more than the value of that one property. Many other properties are protected, when owned by other distinct entities.

In the loosest sense of group ownership, a lack of legal framework, rules and regulations may mean that group ownership of property places every member in a position of responsibility (liability) for the actions of each other member. A structured group duly constituted as an entity under law may still not protect members from being personally liable for each others' actions. Court decisions against the entity itself may give rise to unlimited personal liability for each and every member. An example of this situation is a professional partnership (e.g. law practice) in some jurisdictions. Thus, being a partner or owner in a group may give little advantage in terms of share ownership while producing a lot of risk to the partner, owner or participant.

====Sharing gains====
At the end of each financial year, accounting rules determine a surplus or profit, which may be retained inside the entity or distributed among owners according to the initial setup intent when the entity was created.

Entities ''with a member focus'' will give financial surplus back to members according to the volume of financial activity that the participating member generated for the entity. Examples of this are producer cooperatives, buyer cooperatives and participating whole life policyholders in both mutual and share-capital insurance companies.

Entities'' with share voting rights that depend on financial capital'' distribute surplus among shareholders without regard to any other contribution to the entity. Depending on internal rules and regulations, certain classes of shares have the right to receive increases in financial &quot;dividends&quot; while other classes do not. After many years the increase over time is substantial if the business is profitable. Examples of this are common shares and preferred shares in private or publicly listed share capital corporations.

Entities ''with a focus on providing service in perpetuam'' do not distribute financial surplus; they must retain it. It will then serve as a cushion against losses or as a means to finance growth activities. Examples of this are not-for-profit entities: they are allowed to make profits, but are not permitted to give any of it back to members except by way of discounts in the future on new transactions.

Depending on the charter at the foundation of the entity, and depending on the legal framework under which the entity was created, the form of ownership is determined once and for all time. To change it requires significant work in terms of communicating with stakeholders (member-owners, governments, etc.) and acquiring their approval. Whatever structural constraints or disadvantages exist at the creation thus remain an integral part of the entity. Common in for instance New York City, Hamburg and Berlin in Germany is a form of real estate ownership known as a [[cooperative]] (also co-operative or co-op, in German Wohnungsgenossenschaft - apartment co-operative) which relies heavily on internal rules of operation instead of the legal framework governing condominium associations. These &quot;co-ops&quot;, owning the building for the mutual benefit of its members, can ultimately perform most of the functions of a legally constituted condominium, i.e. restricting use appropriately and containing financial liabilities to within tolerable levels. To change their structure now that they are up and operating would require significant effort to achieve acceptance among members and various levels of government.

====Sharing use====
The owning entity makes rules governing use of property; each property may comprise areas that are made available to any and every member of the group to use. When the group is the entire nation, the same principle is in effect whether the property is small (e.g. picnic rest stops along highways) or large such as [[national parks]], highways, ports, and publicly owned buildings. Smaller examples of shared use include common areas such as lobbies, entrance hallways and passages to adjacent buildings.

One disadvantage of communal ownership, known as the [[Tragedy of the Commons]], occurs where unlimited unrestricted and unregulated access to a resource (e.g. pasture land) destroys the resource because of [[over-exploitation]]. The benefits of exploitation accrue to individuals immediately, while the costs of policing or enforcing appropriate use, and the losses dues to over exploitation, are distributed among many, and are only visible to these gradually.

In an ideal [[communist]] nation the means of production of goods would be owned communally by all people of that nation; the original thinkers did not specify rules and regulations.

===Ownership models===
* [[State ownership]] - Assets that a state or certain state agency has [[jurisdiction]] over in terms of use.
** ''Government ownership'' - Assets belonging to a body of government.
** [[Public property]] - Assets owned by a government or state that are available for public use to all their constituents.

*[[Personal Property|Personal ownership]] - [[Asset]]s and property belonging to an individual, also known as '''individual ownership'''.
*[[Common ownership]] - Assets and property that are held in common by all members of society (or '''non-ownership''').
**[[Communalism|Communal ownership]] - Property held in common by a commune.

*[[Collective ownership]] - Assets and property that belong to a collective body of people who control their use and collect the proceeds of their operation.
**[[Private property|Private ownership]] - A subset of collective property whereby a collective group of owners (such as [[shareholders]]) own productive property that is used by employees, usually for the purpose of generating a profit.
**[[Worker Cooperative|Cooperative ownership]] - Property that is owned by those who operate and use it. Also referred to as '''social ownership'''.

==Types of property==
===Personal property===
{{Main|Personal property}}
'''Personal property''' is a type of [[property]]. In the [[common law]] systems personal property may also be called '''chattels'''. It is distinguished from [[real property]], or [[real estate]]. In the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] systems personal property is often called [[movable property]] or movables - any property that can be moved from one location or another. This term is used to distinguish property that different from [[immovable property]] or immovables, such as land and buildings.

Personal property may be classified in a variety of ways, such as [[good (accounting)|good]]s, [[money]], [[negotiable instrument]]s, [[security (finance)|securities]], and [[intangible assets]] including [[Chose (English law)|choses in action]].

===Land ownership===
{{Main|Real estate}}
Real estate or [[immovable property]] is a [[law|legal]] term (in some jurisdictions) that encompasses land along with anything permanently affixed to the land, such as [[building]]s. Real estate (immovable property) is often considered synonymous with '''[[real property]]''', in contrast from [[personal property]] (also sometimes called ''chattel'' or ''personalty''). However, for technical purposes, some people prefer to distinguish real estate, referring to the land and fixtures themselves, from real property, referring to ownership rights over real estate. The terms ''real estate'' and ''real property'' are used primarily in [[common law]], while [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] [[jurisdiction]]s refer instead to [[immovable property]].

In law, the word ''real'' means relating to a thing (from [[Latin]] ''reÄlis,'' ultimately from ''rÄs'', 'matter' or 'thing'), as distinguished from a person. Thus the law broadly distinguishes between ''real property'' (land and anything affixed to it) and ''personal property'' (everything else, e.g., clothing, furniture, money). The conceptual difference is between immovable property, which would transfer title along with the land, and movable property, which a person would retain title to. (Incidentally, the word ''real'' in ''real estate'' is not derived from the notion of land having historically been &quot;royal&quot; property. The word ''royal''âand its Spanish cognate, ''real''âcome from the unrelated Latin word ''rÄgÄlis'' 'kingly,' which is a derivative of ''rÄx'', meaning 'king.'){{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

With the development of private [[property]] ownership, real estate has become a major area of [[business]].

===Corporations and legal entities===
{{Main|Private property}}
An individual or group of individuals can own corporations and other legal entities. A '''legal entity''' is a [[legal]] construct through which the law allows a group of [[natural person]]s to act as if it were an [[individual]] for certain purposes. Some companies and entities are owned privately by the individuals who registered them with the government while other companies are owned publicly.

Some duly incorporated entities may not be owned by individuals nor by other entities; they exist without being owned once they are created. Not being owned, they cannot be bought and sold. Mutual life insurance companies, credit unions, and cooperatives are examples of this. No person can purchase the company, as their ownership is not legally available for sale, neither as shares nor as a single whole.

A publicly listed [[company (law)|company]], known as a '''public company''', is owned by any member of the [[public]] who wishes to purchase stock in that company rather than by a relatively few individuals. A company that is owned by [[stockholders]] who are members of the general public and trade [[shares]] publicly, often through a listing on a [[stock exchange]]. Ownership is open to anyone who has the [[money]] and inclination to buy shares in the company. Owners, however, are generally classified in three groups. Those with [[5% Ownership]]s of the stock usually hold significant sway over the company. [[Mutual Fund]]s and regular institutions can also own the stock; if they own enough, can are considered as part of the 5% ownership category. Public companies usually are differentiated from [[privately held companies]] where the shares are held by a small group of individuals often members of one or a small group of families or otherwise related individuals (or other companies). For a discussion of the [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] variant of this type of company, see [[public limited company]].

===Intellectual property===
{{Main|Intellectual property}}
Intellectual (IP) property refers to a legal entitlement which sometimes attaches to the [[idea-expression divide|expressed form]] of an [[idea]], or to some other [[intangible asset|intangible]] subject matter. This legal entitlement generally enables its holder to exercise [[exclusive right]]s of use in relation to the subject matter of the IP. The term ''intellectual property'' reflects the idea that this subject matter is the product of the [[mind]] or the intellect, and that IP rights may be protected at law in the same way as any other form of [[property (ownership right)|property]].

Intellectual property laws confer a [[bundle of rights|bundle]] of [[exclusive right]]s in relation to the particular form or manner in which ideas or information are expressed or manifested, and not in relation to the ideas or concepts themselves (see [[idea-expression divide]]). It is therefore important to note that the term &quot;intellectual property&quot; denotes the specific legal rights which authors, inventors and other IP holders may hold and exercise, and not the intellectual work itself.

Intellectual property laws are designed to protect different forms of intangible subject matter, although in some cases there is a degree of overlap.

*[[copyright]] may subsist in creative and artistic works (e.g. books, movies, music, paintings, photographs and software), giving a copyright holder the exclusive right to control reproduction or adaptation of such works for a certain period of time.
*A [[patent]] may be granted in relation to an [[invention]] that is new, useful and not simply an obvious advancement over what existed when the application was filed. A patent gives the holder an exclusive right to commercially exploit the invention for a certain period of time (typically 20 years from the filing date of a patent application).
*A [[trademark]] is a distinctive [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] which is used to distinguish the products or services of one [[business]] from those of another business.
*An [[industrial design right]] protects the form of appearance, style or design of an industrial object (e.g. spare parts, furniture or textiles).
*A [[trade secret]] (also known as &quot;confidential information&quot;) is an item of [[confidentiality|confidential]] information concerning the commercial practices or [[Property|proprietary]] knowledge of a business.

Patents, trademarks and designs fall into a particular subset of intellectual property known as [[industrial property]].

Like other forms of property, intellectual property (or rather the exclusive rights which subsist in the IP) can be transferred ([[consideration|with]] or [[gift|without]] consideration) or [[license]]d to third parties. In some jurisdictions it may also be possible to use intellectual property as [[security (finance)|security]] for a loan.

The basic [[Public policy (law)|public policy]] rationale for the protection of intellectual property is that IP laws facilitate and encourage disclosure of [[innovation]] into the [[public domain]] for the [[common good]], by granting authors and inventors exclusive rights to exploit their works and invention for a limited period.

However, various schools of thought are critical of the very concept of intellectual property, and some characterise IP as ''intellectual [[protectionism]]''. There is ongoing debate as to whether IP laws truly operate to confer the stated public benefits, and whether the protection they are said to provide is appropriate in the context of innovation derived from such things as [[traditional knowledge]] and folklore, and patents for [[software patent|software]] and [[business method patent|business methods]]. Manifestations of this [[controversy]] can be seen in the way different [[jurisdiction]]s decide whether to grant intellectual property protection in relation to subject matter of this kind, and the [[North-South divide]] on issues of the role and scope of intellectual property laws.

===Chattel slavery===
{{Main|Chattel slavery}}
The living [[human body]] is, in most modern societies, considered something which cannot be the property of anyone but the [[person]] whose [[body]] it is. This is in contradistinction to [[slavery|chattel slavery]]. Chattel slavery is a type of slavery defined as the absolute legal ownership of a person or persons, including the legal right to buy and sell them. The slaves do not have the freedom to live life as they choose, but as they are instructed by their owners, and their rights may be either severely limited or nonexistent. In most countries, chattel slaves were considered as movable property{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}.

Slavery is currently illegal in every country around the world, however, up until the 19th century slavery and ownership of people had existed in one form or another in nearly every society on earth{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}. Notwithstanding the illegality according to codes of law, slavery still exists in various forms today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/specials/1357_slavery_today/index.shtml Slavery Today]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Critical views of ownership==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2011}}

===Modern Western views===
In modern Western popular culture some people (principally among the [[political left]]) believe that exclusive ownership of property underlies much social injustice, and facilitates tyranny and oppression on an individual and societal scale. Others (principally among the [[political right]]) consider the striving to achieve greater ownership of wealth as the driving factor behind human technological advancement and increasing standards of living. [[Right-libertarians]] not only believe that ownership is the driving factor behind human technological advancement and increasing standards of living, but is also necessary for liberty itself.

===Ownership society===
[[Ownership society]] was a political slogan used by United States President [[George W. Bush]] to promote a series of policies aimed to increase the control of individual citizens over health care and social security payments and policies. Critics have claimed that slogan hid an agenda that sought to implement tax cuts and curtail the government's role in health care and retirement saving.

===Vedantic view===
The [[Vedic Brahmanism|Brahmanist]] theology called [[Vedanta]] believes that ownership arises due to the sense of being separated from the rest of the universe{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}. When one suffers under the illusion that one is separate from the rest of the universe, ownership is one of the ways one may attempt to reconnect with objects. Vedanta believes that ownership is an illusion which persists as long as the belief in separation from the Universe persists. When one understands the fundamental reality that there is only one entity called the Universe, one is freed of the illusion of ownership.
