'''Ahmed Hassan Zewail''' ({{lang-ar|Ø£Ø­ÙØ¯ Ø­Ø³Ù Ø²ÙÙÙ}}, {{IPA-arz|ËÃ¦Ä§mÃ¦d ËÄ§Ã¦sÃ¦n zeËweËl|IPA}}) (born February 26, 1946) is an [[Egyptian American|Egyptian-American]] scientist who won the 1999 [[Nobel Prize in Chemistry]] for his work on [[femtochemistry]]. He is the Linus Pauling Chair Professor Chemistry and Professor of Physics at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

== Birth and education ==
Ahmed Zewail was born on February 26, 1946 in [[Damanhour]], [[Egypt]] and raised in [[Disuq]]. He received bachelor's degree and MS degree from the [[University of Alexandria]] before moving from Egypt to the United States to complete his PhD at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] with advisor Dr. [[Robin Hochstrasser]]. He completed a post-doctoral fellowship at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] with advisor Dr. [[Charles Bonner Harris|Charles B. Harris]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Zewail|first=Ahmed|title=Autobiography|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1999/zewail-autobio.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic career ==
After some post doctorate work at [[UC-Berkeley]], he was awarded a faculty appointment at [[Caltech]] in 1976, where he has remained since, and in 1990, he was made the first [[Linus Pauling]] Chair in Chemical Physics.&lt;ref name=&quot;autobio&quot;/&gt;  He became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States in 1982.

Dr. Zewail has been nominated and will participate in President Barack Obama's [[United States President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology|Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology]] (PCAST), an advisory group of the nation's leading scientists and engineers to advise the President and Vice President and formulate policy in the areas of science, technology, and innovation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=President Obama Announces Members of Science and Technology Advisory Council|url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/the_press_office/President-Obama-Announces-Members-of-Science-and-Technology-Advisory-Council/|publisher=The White House|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research ===
Zewail's key work has been as a pioneer of [[femtochemistry]]&amp;mdash;i.e. the study of [[chemical reaction]]s across [[femtosecond]]s. Using a rapid [[ultrafast]] [[laser]] technique (consisting of [[ultrashort pulse|ultrashort]] laser flashes), the technique allows the description of reactions on very short time scales - short enough to analyse transition states in selected chemical reactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press Release: The 1999 Nobel Prize in Chemistry|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1999/press.html|publisher=Nobelprize.org|accessdate=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, Zewail became the tenth ethnic [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] to receive the [[Nobel Prize]], following Egyptian president [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] (1978 in Peace), [[Naguib Mahfouz]] (1988 in Literature). [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] followed him (2005 in peace). Other international awards include the [[Wolf Prize]] in Chemistry (1993) awarded to him by the [[Wolf Foundation]], the Tolman Medal (1997), the [[Robert A. Welch Award]] (1997), and the [[Priestley Medal]] from the [[American Chemical Society]] in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Zewail Wins 2011 Priestley Medal&quot;, Chemical &amp; Engineering News, p 5, June 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, he received Egypt's highest state honor, the [[Order of the Nile|Grand Collar of the Nile]].

Zewail was awarded a PHD Honoris Causa by [[Lund University]] in Sweden in May 2003 and is a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] awarded him an [[Honorary degree|Honorary]] [[Doctor of Science|Doctorate in Science]] in 2006. In May 2008, Zewail received a PhD Honoris Causa from [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. In February, 2009, Zewail was awarded an honorary PhD in arts and sciences by the [[University of Jordan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;JT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jordantimes.com/?news=14610&amp;searchFor=zewail|title=Egyptian Nobel laureate calls for âscientific renaissanceâ in Arab world|last=Kheetan|first=Thameen|date=26 February 2009|work=Jordan Times|accessdate=2009-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2010, he received a PhD Honoris Causa in Humane Letters from [[Southwestern University]].

Zewail is married, and has four children.

== Political work ==
In his June 4, 2009 speech at [[Cairo University]], US President [[Barack Obama]] announced a new Science Envoy program as part of a &quot;new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world.&quot; In January 2010, Ahmed Zewail, [[Elias Zerhouni]], and [[Bruce Alberts]] became the first US science envoys to Islam, visiting Muslim-majority countries from North Africa to Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.america.gov/st/scitech-english/2010/February/20100115082753lcnirellep0.1611902.html America.gov]&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about rumors that he might contest the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|2011 Egyptian presidential election]], Ahmed Zewail said: &quot;I am a frank man... I have no political ambition, as I have stressed repeatedly that I only want to serve Egypt in the field of science and die as a scientist.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zewail: I have no political ambitions .. I would like service of Egypt a scientist only&quot;&gt;[http://www.shorouknews.com/ContentData.aspx?id=133290 Zewail: I have no political ambitions .. I would like service of Egypt a scientist only]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2011 Egyptian protests]] he announced his return to the country. Zewail said that he would join a committee for constitutional reform alongside [[Ayman Nour]], Mubarak's rival at the 2005 presidential elections and a leading lawyer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=EGYPT: ZEWAIL RETURNS, CREDIBLE POST-MUBARAK FIGURE |author=[[ANSAmed]] |url=http://www.ansamed.info/en/egitto/news/ME.XEF12253.html |newspaper=[[ANSAmed]] |date=1 February 2011 |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Zewail was later mentioned as a respected figure working as a intermediary between the military regime ruling after Mubarak's resignation, and revolutionary youth groups such as the [[April 6 Youth Movement]] and young supporters of [[Mohamed ElBaradei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahim|first=Kareem|title=Military Offers Assurances to Egypt and Neighbors|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/13/world/middleeast/13egypt.html|accessdate=12 February 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 12, 2011|author2=Kirkpatrick, David D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
