'''Fedora''' (or '''Flexible Extensible Digital Object Repository Architecture''') is a [[modular architecture]] built on the principle that [[interoperability]] and [[extensibility]] is best achieved by the integration of data, [[Interface (computer science)|interface]]s, and mechanisms (i.e., [[executable program]]s) as clearly defined [[Modularity (programming)|module]]s.  Fedora is a [[digital asset management]] (DAM) architecture, upon which many types of [[digital library]], institutional repositories, digital archives, and digital libraries systems might be built.  Fedora is the underlying architecture for a [[digital repository]], and is not a complete management, indexing, discovery, and delivery application.

The Fedora software is available under the terms of the [[Apache License]].

==History==
Fedora was developed jointly by [[Cornell University]] [[Information Science]] and the [[University of Virginia]] Library. Fedora began as a [[DARPA]] and [[National Science Foundation|NSF]]-funded [[research project]] of [[Carl Lagoze]] and [[Sandy Payette]] at Cornell University's [[Digital Library Research Group]] in 1997, where the first reference implementation and a [[CORBA]]-based technical implementation were built. Since then, several modifications have been made to the architecture, and in late 2005, version 2.1 was released. The current version is 3.4.

The Fedora Project is currently supported by grants from the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] and the [[Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation]], and is directed by Sandy Payette from Cornell and Thornton Staples from the University of Virginia.

===Trademark dispute===
When the [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]] distribution was created by [[Red Hat]], and the name adopted, Red Hat attempted to assert its trademark against the Cornell software.  Cornell University and the University of Virginia considered legal action against Red Hat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.com.com/2100-7344_3-5110750.html Red Hat, researchers in name tiff] by David Becker, CNET News.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060615024709/http://fedora.info/redHat.shtml FEDORA project's statement on Red Hat's use of name] (from Wayback Machine)&lt;/ref&gt;

Further discussion of this dispute seems to be either unspoken or under wraps; both projects continue to use the name and there seems to be no further press since November 2003.

==Features==
Fedora provides a general-purpose management layer for [[digital object]]s.  [[Object management]] is based on content models that represent data objects (units of content) or [[Collection class|collections]] of [[data object]]s.  The objects contain linkages between datastreams (internally managed or external content files), [[metadata]] (inline or external), system metadata (including a PID â [[persistent identifier]] â that is unique to the [[software repository|repository]]), and behaviors that are themselves [[code object]]s that provide bindings or links to disseminators (software processes that can be used with the datastreams).  [[Content model]]s can be thought of as containers that give a useful shape to information poured into them; if the information fits the container, it can immediately be used in predefined ways.  

Fedora supports two types of [[access service]]s:  a management client for ingest, [[Software maintenance|maintenance]], and export of objects; or via [[API]] hooks for customized web-based access services built on either [[HTTP]] or [[SOAP]].  A Fedora Repository provides a general-purpose management layer for digital objects, and containers that aggregate mime-typed datastreams (e.g., [[digital image]]s, [[XML]] files, metadata). Out-of-the-box Fedora includes the necessary [[software tools]] to ingest, manage, and provide basic delivery of objects with few or no custom disseminators, or can be used as a backend to a more monolithic user interface.

Fedora supports ingest and export of digital objects in a variety of XML formats. This enables interchange between Fedora and other XML-based applications and facilitates archiving tasks.

==Digital Object Model==
The FEDORA digital object model allows tight management of metadata and digital content, regardless of format. The system is scalable and flexible allowing for FEDORA to associate objects with external or distributed repositories. Objects and behaviour are separated making it possible to change the required behaviours by altering the mechanisms without changing the objects themselves.

== Architecture ==
FEDORA server architecture is based upon four main Application Programming Interfaces (APIs): manage, access, search and the Open Archival Initiative service (for metadata harvesting).
