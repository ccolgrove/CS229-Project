Software categories are arranged hierarchically and are modeled after Windows filesystem paths, such as &quot;C: \ Mobile Phone Tools \ Sony Ericsson&quot;.  Users can sort by criteria such as the date of the last update, the number of downloads, or the rating.  There are three viewing modes, normal, [[freeware]], or [[shareware]], allowing users to screen out certain types of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Kraynak |first=Joe |title=Que's Official Internet Yellow Pages, 2006 Edition |date=2005-08-29 |publisher=Que Publishing |location= |isbn=0-7897-3408-7 |pages=202}}&lt;/ref&gt;
