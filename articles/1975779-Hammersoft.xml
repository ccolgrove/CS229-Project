|quote= Since 2003, a crew as altruistically minded, culturally diverse, and indefatigable as the Enterprise's complement has periodically toiled in a former car dealership warehouse in upstate New York.... &quot;Star Trek: New Voyages&quot; is the brainchild of fans James Cawley and Jack Marshall.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series, released exclusively via the [[Internet]], is designed as a continuation of the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' (aka ''ST:TOS'' or just ''TOS''), beginning in the fourth year of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|starship ''Enterprise's'']] &quot;five-year mission.&quot; The first episode of the series was released in January 2004, with new episodes being released at a rate of about one per year, though producers have expressed their desire to accelerate production.

[[CBS]] (and previously [[Paramount Pictures]]), which owns the legal rights to the ''Star Trek'' franchise, allows the distribution of fan-created material as long as no attempt is made to profit from it without official authorization,&lt;ref name=&quot;freelibrary&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/FUTURE+%60TREK'+FROM+VALLEY+PORTAL,+SPACE+ODYSSEY+TRAVELS+ONTO+THE+WEB-a0154473678|title=FUTURE `TREK' FROM VALLEY PORTAL, SPACE ODYSSEY TRAVELS ONTO THE WEB.|author=Shuster, Fred|publisher=The Free Library|year=2006|accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Phase II'' enjoys the same tolerance.

''Star Trek New Voyages: Phase II'' stars James Cawley as [[Captain Kirk]], Brandon Stacy as [[Mr. Spock]],  and John Kelley as [[Dr. McCoy]].  [[Eugene Roddenberry Jr.]], the son of Star Trek creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], serves as consulting producer. Some of the original actors have returned to reprise their roles, including [[George Takei]] as [[Hikaru Sulu|Sulu]] and [[Walter Koenig]] as [[Pavel Chekov|Chekov]].  The episodes are filmed on new sets located in Port Henry, NY, at a long-shuttered car dealership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/startrek.html |title=Wired 13.12: To Boldly Go Where No Fan Has Gone Before |publisher=Wired.com |date=2009-01-04 |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Phase II'' episode &quot;World Enough and Time&quot; was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]] in 2008, alongside episodes of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[Torchwood]]'' and ''[[Battlestar Galactica (2004 TV series)|Battlestar Galactica]]'', but it lost out to the ''Doctor Who'' episode &quot;[[Blink (Doctor Who)|Blink]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

=== Other support ===
The first episode, &quot;In Harm's Way,&quot; features [[Rod Roddenberry|Eugene &quot;Rod&quot; Roddenberry, Jr.]], the son of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry, as a consulting producer. [[Sam Witwer]] (&quot;Crashdown&quot; from ''Battlestar Galactica'', [[Doomsday (comics)|Doomsday]] in ''[[Smallville]]'' and Galen Marek from ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'') is the voice of the [[Guardian of Forever]] (credited as &quot;Simon Judas Raye&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb-Witwer&quot;&gt;{{cite web

For the second episode, &quot;To Serve All My Days,&quot; written by original series writer [[D.C. Fontana]], original cast member Walter Koenig reprises his role as Pavel Chekov. Mary-Linda Rapelye (Irina Galliulin in the original series episode &quot;The Way to Eden&quot;) appears as an ambassador.

The third episode, &quot;World Enough and Time,&quot; was co-authored by [[Marc Scott Zicree]] and [[Michael Reaves]]. Zicree, who also directed the episode, contributed the stories for the &quot;[[First Contact (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|First Contact]]&quot; episode of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' and &quot;[[Far Beyond the Stars]]&quot; for ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. Reaves, who co-wrote (with [[Diane Duane]]) the &quot;[[Where No One Has Gone Before]]&quot; episode of ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', originally pitched a story to the unproduced ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' series in which Sulu ages by thirty years, and that story served as the basis for this ''New Voyages'' episode. [[Majel Barrett|Majel Barrett Roddenberry]] provided the computer voice in this episode.

[[David Gerrold]] (author of ''TOS'' episode &quot;[[The Trouble With Tribbles]]&quot;) has signed on to pen two episodes. One, originally entitled &quot;Blood and Fire,&quot; was originally pitched for ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'', but was rejected. Gerrold later claimed the story was rejected because it dealt with homosexuality and AIDS{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}. It was later re-worked as the third book in his ''[[Star Wolf (David Gerrold)|Star Wolf]]'' series of novels.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}} [[Denise Crosby]] guest starred as Natasha Yar's grandmother, Dr. Jenna Yar, in David Gerrold's &quot;Blood and Fire.&quot; In addition, [[Bill Blair]] guest starred as Commander Blodgett, and ''[[The Amazing Race]]'' host [[Phil Keoghan]] made a cameo appearance as Admiral Keoghan.

Looking to the future of ''Star Trek: Phase II'', there are five episodes in various stages of production. &quot;Blood and Fire, Part 2&quot; was released November 20, 2009 with temporary audio tracks for Act 3 onwards. It has since been re-released with permanent audio &amp; effects. &quot;Enemy: Starfleet,&quot;  written by Patty Wright and Dave Galanter, was released online in mid-2011, featuring effects done by the [[DAVE School]]. &quot;The Child,&quot; written by Jon Povill and Jaron Summers, and directed by [[Jon Povill]], has wrapped principal photography. Post-production on that episode is in process.  &quot;Kitumba&quot; finished principal photography on June 15, 2009 and is now in post-production. The script was adapted from an early story draft for two episodes of the planned Paramount ''Phase II'' series in the 1977. &quot;The Protracted Man&quot;--now retitled &quot;Origins&quot;--written by David Gerrold and Lee Cronin Jr., went before the cameras in June 2010.

== Production notes ==

* The pilot episode, &quot;Come What May,&quot; begins with the late-1960s [[NBC]] &quot;In Living Color&quot; sequence. It ends, as did the 1960s episodes, with the animated [[Desilu Productions]] logo, with no mention of Paramount.
* The sets for ''New Voyages'' are said to be near-exact copies of the ones from the 1960s series. This was made possible by the series having access to the original [[blueprints]], rather than just photos.
*''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' made use of the fan series by borrowing some of their props (most notably the helmsman's pop-up console viewer) during the two-part episode &quot;[[In a Mirror, Darkly (Enterprise episode)|In a Mirror, Darkly]]&quot; which was set in part on a similar ship, the [[USS Defiant (NCC-1764)|USS ''Defiant'']], as seen in the 1960s episode &quot;[[The Tholian Web]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}
* The series was featured in the December 2005 issue of ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', spotlighting the production of &quot;To Serve All My Days.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Suellentrop&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Suellentrop | first = Chris | year = 2005 | month = December | title = To Boldly Go Where No Fan Has Gone Before | journal = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | issue = 13.12  | issn = 1059-1028| url = http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/startrek.html?pg=1&amp;topic=startrek&amp;topic_set= | accessdate = 2007-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The series adopts some of the continuity from the &quot;[[Shatnerverse]]&quot; novels. For example, during a &quot;possible future&quot; sequence in &quot;Come What May,&quot; Spock states, &quot;Captain Kirk is alive,&quot; just after a sequence from ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. The Special Edition of &quot;In Harm's Way&quot; gives the date from which the ''Enterprise-A'' travels back as 2373 (and so is after Kirk's &quot;death&quot;).
* A CGI rendering from the vignette &quot;Center Seat&quot; is the September 2008 picture in the &quot;Ships of the Line&quot; calendar.
