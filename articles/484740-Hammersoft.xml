'''The Reindeer Section''' are a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[indie rock]] [[supergroup (bands)|supergroup]] formed in 2001 by [[Gary Lightbody]] of [[Snow Patrol]], which released albums and gigged in 2001 and 2002. The Reindeer Section grouping was somewhat ad hoc, and so it is uncertain if more will be heard from them. However, in a 2006 interview with Times Online [[Gary Lightbody]] did not rule out making a future album.

Lightbody describes the band's sound as &quot;pretty much all very slow, quiet, folky-type stuff. Stuff that I really love listening to, like [[Low (band)|Low]], for example, and [[Neil Young]] and [[Joni Mitchell]] and all that end of things. It's sort of inspired by those records rather than by the American rock music that inspired me to start a band in the first place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://music.yahoo.com/read/interview/14128556&lt;/ref&gt;

Some songs (You Are My Joy, Cartwheels) were featured on the 2009 Snow Patrol Best of Album, Up To Now

==History==
===Formation and ''Y'All Get Scared Now, Ya Hear!'': 2001===
The Reindeer Section arose &amp;ndash; according to Lightbody &amp;ndash; out of a chance get-together of musicians at a [[Lou Barlow]] gig in [[Glasgow]] in 2001, at which Lightbody drunkenly laid down the challenge to others to &quot;make an album together&quot;, to which everyone said &quot;yeah yeah&quot;. Lightbody &quot;went home and next day wrote the album&quot; and later convinced Johnny Davis of Bright Star to fund a recording session and release the proposed album. The group met over three days of rehearsal and ten days of recording to produce the first album. ''[[Y'All Get Scared Now, Ya Hear!]]'' was released on 20 October 2001 with a mini tour, the first venue of which was [[Belfast]]'s The Limelight. In television, the track &quot;Will You Please Be There For Me&quot; was used in the closing of episode 39 of NBC's ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]''.

===''Son of Evil Reindeer'' and hiatus: 2002===
''[[Son of Evil Reindeer]]'' was released ten months after the critical acclaim of the first, with a slightly different line-up. The single, &quot;You Are My Joy&quot; appeared on US show, ''[[Grey's Anatomy]]'', and on fourth season of US TV series ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]''. The song &quot;Cartwheels&quot; appeared on &quot;[[The Second Chance (The O.C. episode)|The Second Chance]]&quot;, an episode of ''[[The O.C.]]''. The band's most recent gig was on 14 December 2002 at the [[Queen Margaret Union]] in [[Glasgow]].
