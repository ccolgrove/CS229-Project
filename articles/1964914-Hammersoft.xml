==History==
{{Expand section|date=September 2009}}
The current LFHS was built in 1935. The most recent addition took place in 2008, and was responsible for the adding of a commons area, a new lunchroom and a music wing as well as other minor adjustments.&lt;ref name=&quot;lfhs-about&quot;/&gt;

==Campus==
{{Update|type=section|date=September 2009}}
The high school has both a studio theater and auditorium, as well as a television studio with 5,500 videotapes.  It also has computer labs, computerized library with CD-ROM retrieval, student publication facilities, photography lab, and [[special education]] facilities.  Sports facilities include a field house, climbing wall, [[Olympic-size swimming pool]] with a diving well and student gym.&lt;ref name=&quot;lfhs-about&quot;/&gt;

The grounds include a large front lawn (used for [[field hockey]], [[lacrosse]], and [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]]) and a full-sized track and [[American football|football]] field with 2 sets of bleachers. Because the school is situated very close to residential areas, the City of Lake Forest does not permit the school's football team to use floodlights, effectively prohibiting night games; however, in 2006, the city did allow the school to rent lights for a one-time night game.  A 2007 referendum relocated the schoolâs football facilities to the schoolâs west campus, where the use of floodlights is not prohibited.  The referendum passed by an overwhelming 2/3 majority, and renovations took place in two phases.  The first phase, completed during the 2007/2008 school year, included the addition of a music wing, and renovation of the west campus including construction of a Varsity field. The second phase, completed in August 2008, included academic renovations at the east campus with a brand new dining room, a large atrium or &quot;The Commons&quot; and library, and construction of administrative offices at the west campus, additionally at West campus a new football field complete with floodlights and astro turf was built, now allowing night games. Prior to this, a first referendum was passed on November 7, 2006 unanimously by the Lake Forest High School Board of Education. This referendum was later passed on to the rest of the community and appropriated $54 million to be paid back over the next 20 years.

==Academics==
As of the Class of 2010, Lake Forest had a [[mean (statistics)|mean]] [[ACT (examination)|ACT]] compostite score of 26.5; the national average was 21.1.  One of the highest in the state.
