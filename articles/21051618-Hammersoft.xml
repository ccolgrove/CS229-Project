[[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] was a member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. Bradman's men went through their 34 matches without defeat; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.

An experienced right-handed [[batting order (cricket)|opening]] batsman, Brown was on his third visit to England, having first toured in 1934 before [[World War II]]. However, Brown's best years were lost to the war and by 1948 [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] had superseded him in the pecking order to become Australia's first-choice opening pair. Brown was selected as a reserve opener; this decision generated controversy among critics who believed he was past his best.

Bradman rotated the three openers in the tour matches, but Morris and Barnes were preferred in the Tests. Bradman accommodated Brown in his first-choice team by playing him out of position in the [[batting order (cricket)|middle order]] in the Tests. However, Brown appeared uncomfortable in the unfamiliar role, and was dropped after making 73 runs at a [[batting average]] of 24.33 in the first two Tests.

Despite his struggles in the Test arena, Brown had success in the tour matches as an opener. He scored 1,448 runs at 57.92 in all [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], ranking fourth in both the aggregates and averages. He scored eight [[century (cricket)|centuries]], second only to Bradman, including 200 against [[Cambridge University Cricket Club|Cambridge University]]. However, Brown gained criticism for his slow batting. Following his omission from the Test team, Brown batted in a highly circumspect manner to increase the reliability and volume of his scoring. A very occasional [[off spin]] bowler, Brown took his career first-class best of 4/16 in his only stint with the ball, against the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]].

==Background==
Brown had been a regular member of the Australian Test team since his debut in 1934, and immediately after [[World War II]], he captained Australia in the inaugural Test against [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=az/&gt; However, he was sidelined by injury in 1946&amp;ndash;47 and [[Sid Barnes]] and [[Arthur Morris]] opened in the Tests, averaging 73.83 and 71.85 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html|title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown resumed his Test career in the following season, replacing Barnes, but he was dropped after scoring 29 runs in two Tests. Barnes then came in and made 139 runs in the next two Tests, including a 112 in the Fourth Test. Morris was then rested for the Fifth Test to allow Brown another chance to show his ability and make a case for continued national selection, and he made 99.&lt;ref name=az/&gt; In the Tests against [[India national cricket team|India]] during the season, Barnes, Morris and Brown had shared the opening duties; their batting averages were 43.00, 52.25 and 42.66 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Batting.html |title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia India in Australia 1947/48 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, Brown had done enough to [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|tour England with ''The Invincibles'' in 1948]], his third trip there, although Barnes and Morris were the first-choice opening combination.&lt;ref name=&quot;az&quot;/&gt;

==Early tour==
Australia traditionally fielded its first-choice team in the tour opener, which was customarily against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref name=haigh&gt;{{Cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=2007-05-26| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown gained selection, although Bradman batted him out of position in the middle order while Barnes and Morris opened. Brown came in 6/335 and scored 25 at a typically placid pace,&lt;ref name=az/&gt;&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt; accumulating his runs at a lower [[strike rate]] than the other recognised batsmen. He was out with the score at 6/402 as Australia went on to [[declaration and forfeiture|declare]] at 8/462 and win by an innings.&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{Cite web

In the next match against [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]], Bradman rested Morris, so Brown opened with Barnes. Brown scored 26 in an [[partnership (cricket)|opening stand]] of 46, as Australia amassed 448 and won by an innings.&lt;ref name=o&gt;{{Cite web

[[File:SidBarnesHeadshot.jpg|thumb|Sid Barnes (pictured), one of Brown's opening partners during the tour.]]
The Australians proceeded to play [[Yorkshire County Cricket Club|Yorkshire]] at [[Bradford]], on a [[sticky wicket|damp pitch]] suitable for [[spin bowling|slower bowling]].&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=y&gt;Fingleton, pp. 53&amp;ndash;55.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first innings, Brown took three catches from the bowling of [[Keith Miller]]&amp;mdash;who had resorted to bowling [[off spin]]&amp;mdash;as Yorkshire were bowled out for 71 in difficult batting conditions.&lt;ref name=y/&gt; Opening with Morris while Barnes was rested, Brown made 13 as the match remained finely balanced after Australia was bowled out for 101. Brown took another catch from Miller in the second innings as the hosts were bowled out for 89. Chasing 60 for victory, Brown fell to [[Frank Smailes]] for two as the Australian top order collapsed to 6/31&amp;mdash;effectively seven wickets down with the injured [[Sam Loxton]] unable to bat&amp;mdash;before scraping home by four wickets.&lt;ref name=york&gt;{{Cite web

After putting on 64 for the opening wicket with Morris, Brown added 176 for the second wicket with [[Ron Hamence]]. He added a further 140 for the fourth wicket with [[Lindsay Hassett]], who was captaining the team while Bradman rested himself.

Up to this point, Brown&amp;mdash;who was on his third tour of England&amp;mdash;had scored 800 runs on tour at an average of 72.72, with a double century, three other centuries and 81 [[not out]],&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=az/&gt; In contrast, middle-order batsman [[Neil Harvey]] struggled in the initial stages of his first tour of England.

England batted first and made 165, with Brown prominent in the field. Early on the first day of play, Brown caught England opener [[Cyril Washbrook]]  on the run at the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|fine leg boundary]] after the batsman had attempted to [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hook]] a [[Ray Lindwall]] [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;sco1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f84&gt;Fingleton, p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; leaving England at 2/15 after 41 minutes of play.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt; He later made a series of one-handed stops in the field, helping to keep the pressure on the batsmen.&lt;ref name=f85&gt;Fingleton, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a31&gt;Arlott, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown took his second catch of the innings to remove [[Alec Bedser]], who had featured in a rearguard fightback to help take England to 165 after they had fallen to 8/74.&lt;ref name=sco1/&gt;

Australia won the toss and batted first at the home of cricket.

Brown had hit two consecutive half-volleys off his pads through the leg side for four, and attempted a third boundary in a row to a similar delivery.&lt;Ref name=sco2/&gt; However, this third delivery came off the pitch more quickly and beat Brown for pace.&lt;ref name=f110&gt;Fingleton, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia managed to avoid further collapse a counterattack from the tail saw them to 350 before they bowled England out for 215.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; The tourists batted much more productively in the second innings in ideal weather on the third day.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; Brown joined Miller after Bradman fell at 4/329; Australia had lost 3/33 but steadied to reach stumps at 343 without further loss, with Brown on seven.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p241&quot;/&gt; After the rest day, Australia resumed with a lead of 478 runs and six wickets in hand. The morning was punctuated by three rain stoppages. Just ten minutes after the start, heavy rain intervened. The weather cleared and Miller and Brown moved to lunch on 63 and 32 respectively, with Australia at 4/409.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 120&amp;ndash;121.&lt;/ref&gt; In 88 minutes of play, Australia had added 117 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; Brown was caught behind from [[Alec Coxon]] after lunch without adding to his score for 32, after an 87-run partnership with Miller, with the score at 5/416. Bradman eventually declared at 7/460, 595 runs ahead. It would take a world record chase from England to win the match.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p241&quot;&gt;Perry (2005), p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; The home team lost wickets regularly and fell for 186 to lose by 409 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;sco2&quot;/&gt; Although part of a successful team, Brown was unable to replicate the centuries he made in each of his two previous Tests at Lordâs on the preceding tours, and it was to be the last Test of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt;

The next match was against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]] and started the day after the Test. Brown injured a finger while fielding in the first innings, so he was unable to bat in Australia's first innings. In the second innings, Australia's makeshift openers Harvey and [[Sam Loxton]] chased down the 122 runs for victory to complete a 10-wicket win in less than an hour.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Barnes was still unavailable for the Fourth Test, but Brown was not recalled to open with Morris; instead, Hassett was promoted to open with Morris, while the teenaged Harvey came into the middle-order.

Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Australia batted first against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and Brown top-scored with 106. After putting on 64 with Morris for the first wicket, he put on 104 each for the next two partnerships with Bradman and Harvey respectively, before falling at 3/272.&lt;ref name=kent/&gt; Brown again batted slowly; he took 255 minutes to reach triple figures and was greeted by ironic clapping as he slowly accumulated runs while his partners attacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fingleton, p. 207&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 207.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown's dismissal triggered a collapse; Australia lost their last seven wickets for 89 to end at 361.&lt;ref name=kent&gt;{{Cite web

The match was washed out, but not before Brown took 4/16 from 4.1 overs in his only first-class bowling effort of the tour, cleaning up the tail.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last Australian tour in 1938, the team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six England players from the season's Tests be allowed to compete.&lt;ref name=plg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 207&amp;ndash;209.&lt;/ref&gt; After his opponents had finalised their team, Bradman fielded a full-strength team,&lt;ref name=plg&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; and Brown missed out.
