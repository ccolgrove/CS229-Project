The '''Italian election of 1987''' was held on [[June 14]]. Italian citizens chose the '''tenth Parliament''' of the [[Italian Republic]].

This election marked the final inversion of the trend of the entire republican history of Italy: for the first time, the distance between the Christian Democrats and the Communists grew significantly instead of decreasing, and this fact was seen as the result of the deindustrialization of the country. The growth of the [[service sector]] of the economy, and the leadership of former PM [[Bettino Craxi]], gave instead a new strength to the Socialists. A remarkable novelty was the rise of the new [[Federation of the Greens|Green List]], while a new party obtained its first two parliamentary seats: the [[Lega  Nord|League]].

==Electoral system==
[[File:1987 Italian Senate election map.png|thumb|left|220px|Regional pluralities in Senate]]
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were united in 32 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were established, even if the assembly had risen to 315 members. The candidates needed a landslide victory of two thirds of votes to be elected, a goal which could be reached only by the German minorities in South Tirol. All remained votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where a [[D'Hondt method]] was used: inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.
