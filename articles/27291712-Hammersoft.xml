The twelfth series of the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[medical drama]] [[television series]] ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'' commenced airing in the United Kingdom on [[BBC One]] on 11 September 1997 and finished on 28 February 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0096555/episodes#season-12 IMDB Casualty Series 12]&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was originally due to be shown on the evening of Saturday 6 September, but this was delayed until the following Thursday due to coverage of the funeral of [[Diana, Princess of Wales]] earlier on that day, as the BBC felt it would be inappropriate to air the episode so soon after such an event. 

This series was notable as two of the episodes (episodes 1 and 17) had an extended 'feature-length' running time of 75 minutes, compared to the standard episode length of 50 minutes. The series also featured the first official two-part story, Everlasting Love, which played out over episodes 25 and 26.
