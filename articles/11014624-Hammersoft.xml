'''Holy Innocents' High School''' ([[Abbreviation]]: HIHS; [[Simplified Chinese]]:'''å£å©´ä¸­å­¦''', [[Traditional Chinese]]: '''èå¬°ä¸­å­¸''', [[pinyin]]: ''ShÃ¨ngyÄ«ng ZhÅngxuÃ©'') is one of the earliest [[catholic schools]] in [[Singapore]]. Founded in [[1892]] by the [[Church of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary]], the Chinese mission school is providing secondary school education leading up to a [[Singaporean GCE 'O' Level]] certification, in both express and normal streams. Every year during Thanksgiving Day, the students and teachers attend church for thanksgiving mass and award ceremonies.

The [[co-educational]] high school has received major facelifts in 1994 and 2004 in order to upgrade its old colonial style buildings and facilities. 

Today, Holy Innocents' High School stands on an elevated ground in Hougang Central, surrounded by the [[HDB]] flats and shopping centres.

==Motto==
è°¦ãè¯ãåãç±
The school motto stresses four areas of student development; intellect, morality, physical wellness and harmony. The four areas branch out and include values like humility, hardwork, honesty, kindness, righteousness, sincerity and charity.

The [[Chinese language]] is widely spoken in the school. Almost all the students are Chinese, with some Indians and Malays. 

The majority of the students come from [[Holy Innocents' Primary School]], situated about 500 m away. Most students continue their studies in polytechnics or junior colleges such as: 
*[[Anderson Junior College]]
*[[Catholic Junior College]] (affiliated)
*[[Nanyang Junior College]]
*[[National Junior College]]
*[[Serangoon Junior College]]
*[[Temasek Junior College]]

===Uniform===
In 1997 upper secondary boys were allowed the option of wearing long trousers. Lower secondary school boys continued to wear shorts. For both females and males alike, students wear a white top and light blue bottom. The school has introduced a new uniform but the colours of white and blue remain unchanged.

===Class names===
Previously all express streamed classes were named after the alphabet: A, B, C and D. Numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 were used for Normal Academic and Normal Technical streamed classes.

In 2003, the class naming changed, as below:
