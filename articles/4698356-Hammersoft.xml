'''Claro''' (''formerly Puerto Rico Telephone'') is the largest Puerto Rican telecommunications services company. It is headquartered in [[Guaynabo, Puerto Rico|Guaynabo]], [[Puerto Rico]], and has operated for almost a century offering voice, data, long distance, [[broadband]], directory publishing and wireless services for the island residents and businesses. It was founded by the brothers Behn, [[Sosthenes Behn|Sosthenes]] and [[Hernan Behn|Hernan]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://clarotodo.com/Default.aspx?SecId=104 Claro Una larga trayectoria - de casi un siglo - sirviendote con orgullo]&lt;/ref&gt;. Originally, Puerto Rico Telephone Company eventually spawned [[ITT Corporation]], which was founded by Sosthenes Behn. The company was a [[Public corporations of the Government of Puerto Rico|public corporation of the government of Puerto Rico]] for many years until the majority stakes were acquired by [[GTE]] in the mid-1990s. It was a subsidiary of [[Verizon Communications]] until it was fully acquired by [[AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil]] in 2007.

==History==
On April 3, 2006, [[Verizon Communications]] announced it had agreed to sell its stakes in Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico, Inc. (TELPRI) and their sole ownership of the main [[Dominican Republic|Dominican]] telephone company [[CODETEL|Verizon Dominicana]], now [[CODETEL|Claro RepÃºblica Dominicana]], to [[AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil]] of [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Verizon_Communications_Completes_the_Sale_of_Its_Interest_in_Puerto_Rico_Telephone&quot;&gt;[http://newscenter.verizon.com/press-releases/verizon/2007/verizon-communications-2.html Verizon Communications Completes the Sale of Its Interest in Puerto Rico Telephone]. Verizon International-Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Verizon_Communications_Completes_the_Sale_of_Its_Interest_in_Verizon_Dominicana&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://newscenter.verizon.com/press-releases/verizon/2006/verizon-communications.html Verizon Communications Completes the Sale of Its Interest in Verizon Dominicana].&quot; Verizon International-Puerto Rico, Dominican Republic and Venezuela.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 31, 2006, Verizon and AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil completed Verizon Dominicana ownership transfer into Mexican hands. After another three months and various litigations upon the [[Federal Communications Commission]], which had advise from the [[Junta Reglamentadora de Telecomunicaciones de Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico Telecommunications Board]], on March 30, 2007 TELPRI assets were completely acquired by AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil. The purchase was closed after an agreement to purchase  from [[Popular, Inc.]], the government of [[Puerto Rico]] and the telephone company employee stock ownership program, the remaining stocks of TELPRI at the same price as [[Verizon]].

To present day, [[AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil]] is the 100% owner of the company&lt;ref name=&quot;AmÃ©rica_MÃ³vil_acquires_PRT&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.cellular-news.com/story/22938.php AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil acquires PRTC, Inc.].&quot; Cellular-news.com April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and has rebranded the wireless arm of the company -formerly [[Verizon_Wireless#From_Verizon_Wireless_to_Claro_in_Puerto_Rico|Verizon Wireless]]- under their international [[Claro (mobile phone network)#Puerto Rico|Claro]] brand.&lt;ref name=&quot;AmÃ©rica_MÃ³vil_completes_takeover_of_PRT,_rebrands_mobile_arm_as_Claro&quot;&gt;[http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=17275&amp;email=html  AmÃ©rica MÃ³vil completes takeover of PRT, rebrands mobile arm as Claro].&quot; Teleography's CommsUpdate April 2, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of February 2011 America MÃ³vil has rebranded its wireline (fixed line), broadband DSL, television and dial-up services as Claro. The only services that, for now, remain branded as Claro - Puerto Rico Telephone are business, government or corporate.
