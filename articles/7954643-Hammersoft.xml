'''McGill University''' is a [[public university|public]] [[research university]] located in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]. The university bears the name of [[James McGill]], a prominent Montreal merchant from [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], whose bequest formed the beginning of the university. Founded in 1821, McGill was chartered during the [[Canada under British Imperial Control (1764-1867)|British colonial era]], 46 years before the [[Canadian Confederation]], making it one of the oldest universities in Canada. 

In the [[Maclean's]] 21st Annual University Ranking (2011), McGill was ranked 1st in Canada among all institutions offering medical and doctoral degrees, maintaining this ranking for the seventh year in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://oncampus.macleans.ca/education/2011/10/26/macleans-2011-university-rankings-2/ |title=Macleanâs 2011 University Rankings |publisher=Oncampus.macleans.ca |date=2010-11-10 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011, McGill ranked 1st in Canada and 17th in the world in the [[QS World University Rankings]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2011 |title=QS World University Rankings |publisher=Topuniversities |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

With almost 215,000 living alumni worldwide, students and professors at McGill have been recognized in fields ranging from the arts and sciences, to business, politics, and sports. Notable alumni include eleven [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|Nobel Laureates]], one hundred and thirty-two [[Rhodes Scholars]], three astronauts, two [[Canadian prime ministers]], eleven justices of the [[Supreme Court of Canada|Canadian Supreme Court]],&lt;ref&gt;These are [[Douglas Abbott]], [[Ian Binnie]], [[Louis-Philippe Brodeur]], [[Marie Deschamps]], [[Morris Fish]], [[DÃ©sirÃ© Girouard]],  [[Louis-Philippe de GrandprÃ©]], [[Gerald Le Dain]], [[Charles Gonthier]], [[Pierre-Basile Mignault]], and [[Thibaudeau Rinfret]]&lt;/ref&gt; three [[leader|foreign leaders]], nine [[Academy Award]] winners, three [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners, and twenty-eight [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] medalists.

The main campus is set upon {{convert|32|ha|acre|lk=in}} at the foot of [[Mount Royal]] in [[Downtown Montreal]]. A second campus, the [[Macdonald Campus]], is situated on {{convert|6.5|kmÂ²|sqmi}}) of fields and forested land in [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]], {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of the downtown campus. With 21 [[faculty (university)|faculties]] and [[professional schools]], McGill offers degrees and diplomas in over 300 fields of study, including medicine and law. Although the language of instruction is [[Canadian English|English]], students have the right to submit any graded work in English or in French, except when learning a particular language is an objective of the course. Approximately 34,000 students attend McGill, with international students comprising one-fifth of the student population.


==History==

===Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning===

The creation of the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning (RIAL) in 1801, and its formation of two new Royal Grammar Schools in 1816,  acted as turning points for Canada in two particular ways. First, the schools &quot;were created by legislation, the District Public Schools Act of 1807, and they showed the government's willingness to support the costs of education and even the salary of a schoolmaster. Second, the law involved the state in education, an important first step in the creation of nondenominational schools.&quot; The original two schools closed in 1846; by the mid-19th century the RIAL lost control of the other 82 [[grammar schools]] it had administered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/resources/guide/vol2_3/gen03.htm &quot;Education&quot;], &quot;McGill University Archives&quot;. Retrieved June 8, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Its sole remaining purpose was to administer the McGill bequests on behalf of the college. McGill College continued to grow, now having the sole aim of providing [[Higher education|post-secondary education]]. The RIAL continues to exist today; it is the [[corporate identity]] that runs the university and its various constituent bodies, including the former Macdonald College (now Macdonald Campus), the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] and the Royal Victoria College (the former women's college turned residence). Since the revised Royal Charter of 1852, The Trustees of the RIAL comprise the Board of Governors of McGill University.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Stanley Brice.  ''McGill University, Vol. I.

Upon McGill's death in December 1813 the Royal Institution for the Advancement of Learning, established in 1801 by an Act of the [[Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada]],&lt;ref name=charter&gt;''[http://www.mcgill.ca/secretariat/charter-statutes/royal/ The Royal Charter of McGill University]. Retrieved January 21, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; added the establishing of a University pursuant to the conditions of McGill's will to its original function of administering [[elementary education]] in [[Lower Canada]]. As a condition of the bequest, the land and funds had to be used for the establishment of a &quot;University or College, for the purposes of Education and the Advancement of Learning in the said Province.&quot;&lt;ref name=charter/&gt; The will specified that the college would be required to bear his name and must be established within 10 years of his death; otherwise the bequest would revert to the heirs of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgill.ca/about/history/ Foundation History], McGill University.&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 1821, after protracted [[legal battle]]s with the Desrivieres family (the heirs of his wife), McGill College received a [[royal charter]] from [[George IV of the United Kingdom|King George IV]]. The Charter provided that the College should be deemed and taken as a [[University]], with the power of conferring [[Academic degree|degrees]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.mcgill.ca/public/exhibits/installation/main/gallery-1821.htm The Gallery: 1821 Charter], McGill University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===

[[Image:McGillArtsBuilding.JPG|right|200px|thumb|The Arts Building, built in 1839 and designed by [[John Ostell]], is the oldest building on campus still standing.]]

Despite having a royal charter, McGill College was inactive until 1829 when the Montreal Medical Institution, which had been founded in 1823, became the college's first academic unit and Canada's first medical school.  The Faculty of Medicine granted its first degree, a Doctor of Medicine and Surgery, in 1833; this was also the first medical degree to be awarded in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, DS.

[http://www.mcgill.ca/files/osler-library/No1092008.pdf Osler Library Newsletter, No. 109, 2008].&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Medicine remained the school's only functioning faculty until 1843 when the Faculty of Arts commenced teaching in the newly constructed Arts Building and East Wing (Dawson Hall).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.mcgill.ca/obgyn/departmenthistory.htm &quot;Department History&quot;], &quot;McGill University Health Centre, Montreal&quot;, August 13, 2005. Accessed May 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The university also historically has strong linkage with the [[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]], a military regiment in which James McGill served as the Lieutenant-Colonel. This title is marked upon the stone that stands before the Arts building, from where the Guards step off annually to commemorate Remembrance Day.

===Later development===

[[File:JohnWilliamDawson.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Sir John William Dawson, Principal of McGill University 1855-1893.]]

[[John William Dawson|Sir John William Dawson]], McGill's principal from 1855 to 1893, is often credited with transforming the school into a modern university.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicine.mcgill.ca/history/ McGill University Faculty of Medicine: History], &quot;McGill University Faculty of Medicine&quot;, 2008. Retrieved June 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  He recruited the aid of Montreal's wealthiest citizens (eighty percent of Canada's wealth was then controlled by families who lived within the &quot;Golden Mile&quot; area that surrounded the university), many of whom donated property and funding needed to construct the campus buildings.  Their names adorn many of the campus's prominent buildings. William Spier (architect) designed the 
addition of West Wing of the Arts Building for William Molson, 1861 &lt;ref&gt; dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1403 William Spier (architect) &lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Francis Dunlop]] designed major alterations to the East Wing of McGill College (now called the Arts Building, MCGill University) for Prof. Bovey and the Science Dept., 1888. &lt;ref&gt; http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1651 [[Alexander Francis Dunlop]] &lt;/ref&gt; This expansion of the campus continued until 1920.  Buildings designed by [[Andrew Taylor (Architect)]], include the [[Redpath Museum]] (1880), Macdonald Physics Building (1893), the Redpath Library (1893), the Macdonald Chemistry Building (1896), the Macdonald Engineering Building (1907), and the Strathcona Medical Building (1907)âsince renamed the Strathcona Anatomy and Dentistry Building. 

In 1885, the university's Board of Governors formally adopted the use of the name McGill University. The Faculty of Law was founded in 1848, making it Canada's oldest. The school of architecture at McGill University was founded in 1896.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marco Polo |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0009565 |title=Architectural Education |publisher=Thecanadianencyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women's education at McGill began in 1884, when [[Donald Smith, 1st Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal|Donald Smith]], also known as [[Lord Strathcona]], began funding separate lectures for women, given by university staff members.  The first degrees granted to women at McGill were conferred in 1888.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccheritage.ca/biographies/williamdawson.php William Dawson], CCHeritage.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, the Royal Victoria College (RVC) opened as a residential college for women at McGill.  Until the 1970s, all female undergraduate students, known as &quot;Donaldas,&quot; were considered to be members of RVC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/hist_mcgill/rvc/rvc.htm Royal Victoria College], McGill University Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in the autumn of 2010, the newer Tower section of Royal Victoria College is a ''co-ed'' dormitory, whereas the older West Wing remains strictly for women. Both the Tower and the West Wing of Royal Victoria College form part of the university's residence system.
In 1900, the university established the MacLennan Travelling Library. ''McGill University waltz'' composed by Frances C. Robinson, was published in MontrÃ©al by W.H. Scroggie, c 1904.&lt;ref&gt;''McGill University waltz'' http://amicus.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/c.php?id=22624970&amp;l=eng&amp;s=amicus&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, the university acquired a second campus when [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William C. Macdonald]], one of the university's major benefactors, endowed a college in Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, 32 kilometres west of Montreal. Macdonald College, now known as the [[Macdonald Campus]], opened to students in 1907, originally offering programs in agriculture, household science, and teaching.

McGill established the first post-secondary institutions in [[British Columbia]] to provide degree programs to the growing cities of [[Vancouver]] and [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]. It created [[Victoria College, British Columbia|Victoria College]] in 1903, a two-year college offering first and second-year McGill courses in arts and science, which was the predecessor institution to the modern [[University of Victoria]]. The province's first university was incorporated in Vancouver in 1908 as the McGill University College of British Columbia. The private institution granted McGill degrees until it became the independent [[University of British Columbia]] in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.ubc.ca/archives/mucbc.html Higher Education in British Columbia Before the Establishment of UBC], UBC Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

The War Memorial Hall (more generally known as Memorial Hall) is a landmark building on the campus of McGill University. At the dedication ceremony the Governor General of Canada (Viscount of Tunis) laid the cornerstone. Dedicated on October 6, 1946, the Memorial Hall and adjoining Memorial Pool honour students who had enlisted and died in the [[First World War]], and in the [[Second World War]]. In Memorial Hall, there are two Stained Glass Regimental badge World War I and World War II Memorial Windows by [[Charles William Kelsey]] c. 1950/1.&lt;ref&gt;http://spectrum.library.concordia.ca/110/1/MM05144.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; A war memorial window (1950) by [[Charles William Kelsey]] in the McGill War Memorial Hall depicts the figure of St. Michael and the badges of the Navy, Army and the Air Force. Six other windows (1951) by [[Charles William Kelsey]] on the west wall of the memorial hall depict the coats of arms of the regiments in which the McGill alumni were members.
There is a memorial archway at [[Macdonald College]], two additional floors added to the existing Sir [[Arthur Currie]] gymnasium, a hockey rink and funding for an annual Memorial Assembly. A Book of Remembrance on a marble table contains the names of those lost in both World Wars.
The [[National Film Board of Canada]] documentary `Occupation` (1970), directed by Bill Reid, documents the occupation of the offices of the Political Science Department at McGill University in 1970 by striking political science students.`  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onf-nfb.gc.ca/eng/collection/film/?id=11453 |title=`Occupation` (1970) |publisher=Onf-nfb.gc.ca |date=2010-08-03 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10th, 2011, the Montreal riot police entered McGill University's campus, the first time since March of 1969, after a city-wide student protest against increases in tuition fees that ended in a student occupation of the McGill Principal's office and James Administration Building. As a result, hundreds of protesters, and at least one faculty member, were clubbed, pepper-sprayed, and tear-gassed&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newappsblog.com/2011/11/the-crisis-at-mcgill-who-called-riot-police-onto-campus.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify credibility|date=November 2011}}  Five days later, there was an open rally at McGill regarding the events of November 10th.  The event was attended by nearly 1,000 students and staff who were virtually unanimous in their denunciation of the McGill administration, headed by Munroe-Blum, and their handling of the November 10th protest and occupation&lt;ref&gt;http://www.montrealgazette.com/news/McGill+heavy+handed+students+staff/5710401/story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====Residence====

McGill's residence system is relatively small for a school of its size, housing approximately 2,700 undergraduate students and a handful of graduate students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgill.ca/residences/ |title=McGill Residences |publisher=Mcgill.ca |date=2010-07-28 |accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most McGill students do not live in [[Dormitory|residence]] (known [[colloquialism|colloquially]] as &quot;rez&quot;) after their first year of study, even if they are not from the Montreal area. With the exception of students returning as &quot;floor fellows&quot; or &quot;dons&quot;, the majority of McGill residences are for first-year undergraduate students only. Senior students are expected to find off-campus housing.

Many first-year students live in the Bishop Mountain Residences (&quot;Upper Rez&quot;),&lt;ref&gt;&quot; Upper Rez: Douglas, McConnell, Molson and Gardner Halls&quot;.

Douglas Hall, which opened in 1937, is distinguished by its impressive stone facade and wood interiors.  McConnell, Molson, and Gardner Halls, all built in the 1960s, share a [[cafeteria]], located at the centre of the three dormitories, known as Bishop Mountain Hall.

''Royal Victoria College'', the second-largest residence at McGill, was a women's only dormitory; however in September 2010 the dormitory became co-ed. McGill's second newest residence, aptly named ''New Residence Hall'' (&quot;New Rez&quot;) is a converted four-star hotel located a few blocks east of campus. New Rez is the largest of the university's dormitories. ''Solin Hall'' is an apartment-style residence four [[Montreal Metro|metro]] stops from campus. The McGill Off-Campus Residence Experience (MORE) residences consist of a series of converted apartment buildings and houses, the largest of which is The Greenbriar, an apartment-style residence located across from the Milton Gates.

In autumn 2008, due to increased demand for first-year housing, the University chose to lease four floors of a privately owned apartment building for use as a university residence. The building, called &quot;515 Ste. Catherine&quot;, is on the corner of Rue Ste. Catherine and Rue City Councillors, close to campus yet in the heart of downtown Montreal. It was completely renovated and featured a gym, movie theater, and fully furnished apartments.  However, the McGill Residence Office decided to forgo use of the building after summer 2009. In April 2009, McGill acquired the Four Points Sheraton Hotel at 475 Sherbrooke Street West. The hotel was converted into a new student residence, which opened in fall 2009.  Although it is the newest residence, students either call it Carrefour, or, informally, &quot;C4.&quot;  Officially, however, the building has been named Carrefour Sherbrooke Residence Hall.

Most second-year students transition to off-campus apartment housing, and apartment hunting is sometimes seen as a rite of passage for McGill students.  Many students end up living in the &quot;[[McGill Ghetto]]&quot;, the neighbourhood directly to the east of the downtown campus. In recent years, finding affordable housing has been challenging because of the city's tight housing market, particularly in neighbourhoods close to the McGill campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3201/ghetto.html &quot;In the Ghetto&quot;], &quot;McGill Reporter&quot;, September 9, 1999.

====Master plan====

McGill has begun an ambitious process to lay the groundwork for future development. A Task Force on Campus Planning has been created to study the issue. It has begun to consult widely within the McGill and greater community on a broad range of issues including community life, physical development plans, and other issues. Its recommendations include how McGill can develop in a way that supports the Universityâs mission and goals, and continues to benefit and bring value to the surrounding areas and the greater Montreal community.  Among the guiding principles of the Task Forceâs work are commitment to community, responsible stewardship, maintenance of green space and the integrity of the mountain, and the preservation of heritage architectural assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgill.ca/masterplan/], &quot;McGill Master Plan&quot;, September 9, 2009.

====Redevelopment plan====

In 2006, the Quebec government initiated a $1.6 billion [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] redevelopment project for the [[McGill University Health Centre]] (MUHC).  The project will expand facilities to two separate campuses&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muhc.ca/construction/ &quot;THE MUHC REDEVELOPMENT PROJECT&quot;], &quot;McGill University Health Centre&quot;, 2008.

A second campus, the [[Macdonald Campus]], in [[Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue, Quebec|Sainte-Anne-de-Bellevue]] houses the Faculty of Agricultural and Environmental Science, the School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition, the Institute of Parasitology, and the McGill School of Environment.  The [[Morgan Arboretum]] and the [[J. S. Marshall Radar Observatory]] are nearby.

The Morgan [[Arboretum]] was created in 1945.  It is a {{convert|2.5|km2|sqmi|3|adj=on}} forested reserve with the aim of 'teaching, research, and public education'. Its mandated research goals are to continue research related to maintaining the health of the Arboretum [[plantations]] and [[woodland]]s, to develop new programs related to selecting [[species]] [[Adaptation|adapted]] to developing environmental conditions and to develop silvicultural practices that preserve and enhance [[Biodiversity|biological diversity]] in both natural stands and plantations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.morganarboretum.org/english/introduction.htm An INTRODUCTION to the Arboretum], Morgan Arboretum.&lt;/ref&gt;

==University identity and culture==

[[Image:Mcgill CoA.jpg|left|150px|thumb|McGillâs coat of arms.]]
The McGill [[coat of arms]] is derived from an armorial device assumed during his lifetime by the founder of the University, James McGill. The University's patent of arms was granted by England's Garter-King-at-Arms in 1922 and registered in 1956 with Lord Lyon King of Arms in Edinburgh and in 1992 with the Public Register of Arms, Flags and Badges of Canada. In heraldic terms, the coat of arms is described as follows: &quot;Argent three Martlets Gules, on a chief dancette of the second, an open book proper garnished or bearing the legend ''In Domino Confido'' in letters Sable between two crowns of the first. Motto: ''Grandescunt Aucta Labore''.&quot; The coat of arms consists of two parts, the shield and the scroll. The University publishes a guide to the use of the University's arms and motto.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgill.ca/files/secretariat/WordmarkandInsigniaofMcGillUniversity-Policyontheuseof.pdf] Policy on use of the Wordmark and Insignia of McGill University&lt;/ref&gt;

The university's symbol is the [[martlet]], stemming from the presence of the mythical bird on the official [[coat of arms|arms]] of the university. The school's official colours are red and white. McGill's motto is ''Grandescunt Aucta Labore'', [[Latin language|Latin]] for &quot;By work, all things increase and grow.&quot;

The official [[school song]] is entitled &quot;Hail, [[Alma Mater]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/hist_mcgill/songs/songs.htm |title=McGill Songs &gt; McGill Facts and Institutional History &gt; McGill History &gt; Outreach |publisher=Archives.mcgill.ca |date=2004-03-24 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language policy===

Though McGill allowed students to write graduation theses in French as early as 1835, McGill never became a francophone or officially [[bilingual]] university. Today, McGill is one of only three [[English language|English-language]] universities in Quebec; fluency in French is not a requirement to attend.  The Faculty of Law does, however, require all students to be &quot;passively bilingual&quot;, meaning that all students must be able to understand written and spoken Frenchâor English if the student is francophoneâsince English or French may be used at any time in a course.  Since 1964, students in all faculties have been able to write exams and papers in either English or French, provided that the objective of the class is not to learn a particular language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDC-0-10-1249-6929-10/index_souvenirs/vie_societe/mcgill_francais |title=&quot; McGill franÃ§ais! &quot; â Souvenirs â Les Archives de Radio-Canada |publisher=Archives.cbc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1960s represented an era of large nationalist and labour mobilizations in Quebec.  At the time, English was seen as the privileged language of commerce. McGill, where [[francophone]]s comprised only three percent of the student population, was seen by some as a bastion of [[English-speaking Quebecker|anglophone]] privilege in a predominantly French-speaking city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3114/francais.html |title=Reporter: McGill franÃ§ais |publisher=Reporter-archive.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3111/scope.html |title=Reporter: Kaleidoscope |publisher=Reporter-archive.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''McGill franÃ§ais'' movement began in 1969, clamouring for a new McGill that would be francophone, pro-nationalist, and pro-worker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3114/francais.html &quot;McGill franÃ§ais and Quebec society&quot;], &quot;McGill Reporter&quot;, April 8, 1999. Accessed May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was led by Stanley Gray, a [[political science]] [[professor]].  It was argued that, since McGill received the lion's share of government funding, paid by a taxpayer base that was largely francophone, the university should equally be accessible to that segment of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r2902/daily.htm &quot;A reunion of radicals&quot;], &quot;Reporter Volume 29 Number 2&quot;, September 26, 1996.

Protesters shouted &quot;McGill franÃ§ais&quot;, &quot;McGill aux QuÃ©bÃ©cois&quot;, and &quot;McGill aux travailleurs&quot; (McGill for workers).  However, the majority of students and faculty opposed such a position, and many of the protesters were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;Chester, Bronwyn.

===Student organizations===

[[Image:Students' Society of McGill University logo.png|thumb|right|120px|SSMU was one of the first student societies in Canada to use an [[online voting]] system for campus elections.]]The campus has an active [[students' union]] represented by the undergraduate [[Students' Society of McGill University]] (SSMU) and the [[Post-Graduate Students' Society of McGill University]] (PGSS).  Due to the large postdoctoral population, the PGSS also contains a semi-autonomous Association of Postdoctoral Fellows (APF). In addition, each faculty has its own student governing body. There are hundreds of clubs and student organizations at the university. Many of them are centred around McGill's student union building, the University Centre. In 1992, students held a [[referendum]] which called for the University Centre to be named for actor and McGill alumnus [[William Shatner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ssmu.mcgill.ca/index.php/university-centre/where-we-are Where we are], SSMU ''The William Shatner University Centre is located at 3480 McTavish Street, on the west side of the McGill campus''&lt;/ref&gt; The university administration refused to accept the name and did not attend the opening. Traditionally, the administration names buildings in honour of deceased members of the university community or for major [[benefactor (law)|benefactors]]âShatner is neither.&lt;ref&gt;Stojsic, Leslie. [http://www.reporter-archive.mcgill.ca/Rep/r3112/shatner.html &quot;The trek back home&quot;]. ''McGill Reporter'', March 11, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

McGill has two English-language student-run newspapers: the ''[[McGill Daily]]'' and the ''[[McGill Tribune]]'', both of which are financially [[independent business|independent]] publications. The McGill Daily was first published in 1911. The Daily is currently is published twice weekly.&lt;ref name=mcgdaily&gt;[http://mcgilldaily.theorem.ca/view.php?aid=709&amp;f_iid=159 &quot;About The McGill Daily&quot;], &quot;The McGill Daily&quot;, 2008.

Since 1988, [[The Red Herring]] has been the main satire magazine of Mcgill University. [[CKUT]] (90.3 FM) is the campus radio station.  [[TVMcGill]] is the University TV station, broadcasting on closed-circuit television and over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvmcgill.com |title=TVMcGill |publisher=TVMcGill |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[McGill University Faculty of Law]] is also home to three student-run academic journals, including the world renowned ''[[McGill Law Journal]]'', founded in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawjournal.mcgill.ca/about.php |title=McGill Law Journal |publisher=Lawjournal.mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[fraternities]] and [[sororities]] are not a large part of student life at McGill, some, including fraternities [[Alpha Delta Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Delta Upsilon]], and [[Zeta Psi]], and sororities [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], and [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], have been established for many years at the university. [[Phi Kappa Pi]], Canada's only national fraternity, was founded at McGill and the University of Toronto in 1913 and continues to be active to this day. Events including [[Culture of Greece|Greek]] week, held annually during the first week of February, have been established to promote Greek life on campus.
With just over 2% of the student body population participating, involvement is well below that of most American universities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.dailyutahchronicle.com/media/storage/paper244/news/2007/11/07/News/Greek.Row.Fraternity.Participation.Up.Sororities.Down-3083679.shtml &quot;Greek Row: Fraternity participation up, sororities down&quot;] &quot;The Daily Utah Chronicle&quot;, November 7, 2007.

The three oldest a cappella groups on campus are Tonal Ecstasy, Effusion and Soulstice.  These groups perform multiple times during the year at on- and off-campus events.

Student organizations at McGill are internationally recognized in a variety of ways. Many larger organizations and [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]] have a local presence on campus. The International Relations Students Association of McGill (IRSAM) currently has consultative status with the UN's [[United Nations Economic and Social Council|Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) and the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO).&lt;ref&gt;[http://portal.unesco.org/ci/fr/ev.php-URL_ID=6418&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html &quot;Centre de recherches sur les pÃ¢tes et papiers de l'UniversitÃ© de McGill&quot;], &quot;MÃ©moire du monde&quot;, UNESCO.ORG.

====Fight song====

''The McGill University song book,'' compiled by a committee of graduates and undergraduates, was published in Montreal by W.F. Brown, circa 1896.&lt;ref&gt;McGill University song book http://collectionscanada.gc.ca/ourl/res.php?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;url_tim=2010-01-09T21%3A23%3A46Z&amp;url_ctx_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Actx&amp;rft_dat=5345946&amp;rfr_id=info%3Asid%2Fcollectionscanada.gc.ca%3Aamicus&lt;/ref&gt;
Notable among a number of songs commonly played and sung at various events such as [[Graduation|commencement]] and [[convocation]], and athletic games are:
* 'Alma Mater McGill,' with words by J. McDougall;
* 'L'Enfant du McGill,' with words by Louis-HonorÃ© FrÃ©chette, and music by Guillaume Couture;
* 'God Save McGill,' with words by W.M. Mackeracher, tune 'God Save the Queen';
* 'A Health to Old McGill,' with words by R.W. Huntingdon, and music by Mrs W.C. Baynes;
* 'McGill,' with words by C.W. Colby, sung to the tune 'The Gay Cavalier';
* 'McGill Revisited,' with words by John Cox,
* 'McGill Students' with words by W.N. Evans;
* 'The Student of McGill,' with words by R.D.

====Rivalries====
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2011}}
McGill maintains an academic and athletic rivalry with [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]], [[Ontario]]. Animosity between rowing athletes{{citationneeded|date=November 2011}} at the two schools has inspired an annual boat race between the two universities in the spring of each year since 1997, inspired by the famous [[The Boat Race|Oxford-Cambridge Boat Race]]. The football rivalry, which started in 1884, ended after Canadian university athletic divisions were re-organized in 2000; the Ontario-Quebec Intercollegiate Football Conference was divided into [[Ontario University Athletics]] and [[Quebec Student Sports Federation]]. The rivalry returned in 2002 when it transferred to the annual home-and-home hockey games between the two institutions. Queen's students refer to these matches as &quot;Kill McGill&quot; games, and usually show up in Montreal in atypically large numbers to cheer on the [[Queen's Golden Gaels]] hockey team. In 2007, McGill students arrived in bus-loads to cheer on the [[McGill Redmen]], occupying a third of Queen's Jock Harty Arena.

The school also competes in the annual &quot;[[Old Four|Old Four (IV)]]&quot; soccer tournament, with [[Queen's University]], the [[University of Toronto]] and the [[University of Western Ontario]].

McGill and [[Harvard]] also maintain their historical rivalry, represented by the biennial Harvard-McGill rugby games, alternately played in Montreal and Cambridge, MA. McGill is often regarded as being Canada's Harvard. This can also be seen when McGill is mentioned as &quot;The Harvard of Canada&quot; by Marge in [[The Simpsons]], to which Lisa rebuffs. In addition, a popular student t-shirt sold at McGill spoofs this by displaying &quot;Harvard - America's McGill&quot;.

===McGill in fiction===

In fiction, characters from movies and television shows have also been portrayed as McGill students, professors, or researchers. Fictional alumni from McGill include Lieutenant Alan McGregor, played by [[Gary Cooper]] in the movie ''[[The Lives of a Bengal Lancer|Lives Of the Bengal Lancers]]'' (1935), and Major Donald Craig, a Canadian commando serving with British special forces during World War II, portrayed by [[Rock Hudson]] in the 1967 war movie ''[[Tobruk (film)|Tobruk]]'' (though the film was loosely based on real events, it is not clear whether or not Hudson's character was based on a real person: most likely he was a [[pastiche]] character, given a Canadian background as cover for Hudson's inability to emulate a British accent). In the [[Fox Network]] television drama ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'', [[James Wilson (House)|James Wilson]], an [[oncologist]] at the Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital is also a McGill alumnus. [[Sasquatch (comics)|Walter Langkowski]], a researcher from the Marvel Comics Canadian superhero series [[Alpha Flight]], is portrayed as a McGill-based [[biophysics|biophysicist]] researching the [[gamma ray|gamma radiation]] accident which created [[Hulk (comics)|the Hulk]]. Langkowski's discoveries transformed him into the [[superhero]] known as [[Sasquatch (comics)|Sasquatch]].  McGill is also referenced in several of [[Kathy Reichs]]' Temperance Brennan novels.

===Historical links===

* The [[University of Glasgow]], one of four [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient Scottish universities]] and member of the British [[Russell Group]]. Founded in 1451, the original benefactor of McGill College, James McGill, studied here in the 1750s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gla.ac.uk/international/country/canada/&lt;/ref&gt; before his family worked as merchants in the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=36662&lt;/ref&gt; The two universities continue this link today as part of [[Universitas 21]], an international student exchange programme.
* The [[University of Edinburgh]], one of four [[Ancient universities of Scotland|ancient Scottish universities]] and member of the British [[Russell Group]]. The University was founded as a civic institution in 1583 and has maintained a strong reputation in the study of medicine, among other disciplines. McGill's first (and, for several years, its only) faculty, Medicine, was founded by four physicians/surgeons who had trained in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;Cruess, Richard L. (2007-11-26). http://www.mcgill.ca/medicine/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt; In common with Glasgow, Edinburgh shares an international exchange link with McGill through [[Universitas 21]].

==Finances==

As a public university, McGill is not as dependent on its endowment for operating revenue as some of its international peers.  The McGill endowment only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual operating revenues.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgill.ca&quot;&gt;Heather Munroe-Blum. [http://www.mcgill.ca/principal/speeches/econstatement_020909/], &quot;McGill University&quot;, February 3, 2008. Retrieved February 9, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nonetheless, McGill's endowment rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments.&lt;ref&gt;Tibbets, Janice. [http://www.canada.com/topics/news/national/story.html?id=9a8b62cf-015b-48ce-8867-8f0ce6d732be&amp;k=47247 &quot;U of T, UBC join billion-dollar club&quot;], &quot;Canwest News Service&quot;, February 3, 2008. Accessed May 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected it from the more substantial losses experienced at many other universities during the market crisis of 2008â2009, it still faced a 20% endowment decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgill.ca&quot;/&gt; Valued at $21,633 per student, the university maintains one of the [[List of Canadian universities by endowment|largest endowments among Canadian universities]] on a per-student basis.

In an open letter to faculty and students, Heather Munroe-Blum wrote:
&quot;The next few years do not promise to be easy. But in facing this challenge, McGill has a unique advantage in addition to that of the fundamental progress we have made. This university has lived with restricted resources and uncertainty for almost two hundred years â it is part of our culture. And yet, against this backdrop of hardship, we have always retained our commitment to excellence. We are one of the worldâs great universities. This will not change. In my installation speech in the spring of 2003, I said McGill âpunches above its weight.â We will continue to do so.  In order to stay the course, we must now move with confidence, pride, excitement and discipline to seize every opportunity to put McGill in an ideal position to leap forward with the inevitable recovery.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgill.ca&quot;/&gt;

===Campaign McGill===

''Campaign McGill: History in the Making'' is a five-year comprehensive campaign that began in October 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=207855b3-e023-4094-9f05-80ede5a36aff &quot;McGill launches $750-million fundraiser&quot;], &quot;The Montreal Gazette&quot; October 18, 2007.

Support to McGillâs annual fund has actually increased during the market crisis.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgill.ca&quot;/&gt;  According to Principal Heather Munroe-Blum, she is confident that Campaign McGill will reach its $750 million goal by 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcgill.ca&quot;/&gt;

===Tuition===

[[Tuition|Tuition fees]] vary significantly between in-[[province]], out-of-province, and international students, with full-time Quebec students paying around $2,167.80 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=admissions costs at mcgill.ca|url=http://www.mcgill.ca/law-admissions/undergraduates/costs/}}&lt;/ref&gt; per year, Canadian students from other provinces paying around $5,858.10 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=admissions costs at mcgill.ca|url=http://www.mcgill.ca/law-admissions/undergraduates/costs/}}&lt;/ref&gt;per year, and [[Canadian nationality law|international]] students paying $14,461.80â$24,840 per year.&lt;ref&gt;McGill Student Information&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgill.ca/student-accounts/fees/undergrad/intern/ &quot;McGill University&quot;. Accessed April 18, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; Students must also pay housing costs, though Montreal has some of the least expensive housing among large North American cities.

Since 1996, McGill, in accordance with the MinistÃ¨re de l'Ãducation, du Loisir et du Sport (MELS), has had eight categories that qualifies certain international students to be excused from paying international fees.  These categories include: students from France, a quota of students from select countries which have agreements with MELS, which include [[Algeria]], China, and [[Morocco]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mels.gouv.qc.ca/ens-sup/ens-univ/droits_scolarite-A_pays-organisations.pdf Countries and International Organizations Granted Exemptions from the Additional Financial Contribution by the Government of Quebec], MinistÃ¨re de l'Ãducation, du Loisir et du Sport.&lt;/ref&gt; students holding diplomatic status, including their [[dependent (law)|dependents]], and students enrolled in certain language programs leading to a degree in French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcgill.ca/student-records/fees/exemption/ |title=International Fee Exemption |publisher=Mcgill.ca |date=2010-12-07 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scholarships and financial aid===

[[Scholarships]] at McGill are relatively difficult to attain, compared to other Canadian universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.financialaid.uottawa.ca/admission.html &quot;Admission Scholarships Program&quot;], &quot;University of Ottawa&quot;.

Accessed May 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This is predominantly due to the number of high academic achievers at the school. For out-of-province first year undergraduate students, a high school average of 95% is required to receive a guaranteed one-year entrance scholarship.&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrance&quot;&gt;[http://www.mcgill.ca/applying/undergrad2008-09/scholarships/ &quot;Entrance awards&quot;], McGill University. Retrieved June 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; To be considered for the same scholarships, Quebec CEGEP students need a minimum r-score of 35.5, United States high school students need a minimum A average as well as at least 700 in each SAT or 33 in the ACT, and French Baccalaureate students need an average of 15.5 plus a minimum score of 14 in each course; similarly, students in the British education system need As in both GCSE Level and predicted Advanced Level results, and International Baccalaureate students need to attain a minimum overall average of 6.9 on predicted grades or a score of 42 on exam results. In general, entrance scholarship recipients rank in the top 1â2% of their class.

For renewal of previously earned scholarships, students generally need to be within the top 10% of their faculty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcgill.ca/studentaid/scholarships/recipients/ &quot;Renewals&quot;], McGill University. Accessed May 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; For in-course scholarships in particular, students must be within the top 5% of their faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;incoursescholarships&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = In-course awards â For students already at McGill | url = http://www.mcgill.ca/studentaid/scholarships/in-course/ | publisher = McGill University }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;deanshonourlist&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Dean's Honour List | url = http://www.mcgill.ca/studentaid/scholarships/deanslist/ | publisher = McGill University }}&lt;/ref&gt; McGill itself outlines scholarship considerations as follows: &quot;Competition for basic and major scholarships is intense at McGill. An extraordinary number of exceptional applications are received each year and therefore we cannot award scholarships to all good candidates.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Entrance&quot; /&gt;
