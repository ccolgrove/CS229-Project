Chattanooga athletics teams compete in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I (FCS for [[College football|football]]) in the [[Southern Conference]] and have been ranked as a national top 100 athletic program by The National Association of Collegiate Directorâs of Athletics (NACDA) in the Division I Learfield Sports Directorâs Cup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gomocs.com/ViewArticle.dbml?&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17700&amp;ATCLID=3754165&amp;SPID=10571&amp;SPSID=88662&lt;/ref&gt;

;Basketball
{{Main|Chattanooga Mocs basketball}}
Chattanooga's men's basketball program has been among the best in the Southern Conference since joining the league in 1977â78.  The Mocs have won 10 SoCon Tournament titles, tied for first all-time with former member West Virginia and Davidson, 10 regular-season league championships prior to the change to the division format in 1995 and seven division titles for 27 totals titles.  In [[1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1997]], led by coach [[Mack McCarthy]] and PG Wes Moore, the Mocs made a run to the Sweet 16 as a No. 14 seed, beating Georgia and Illinois before falling to Providence.  Before making the move to Division I, Chattanooga won the Division II National Championship in 1977. &lt;ref&gt;NCAA Division II Men's Basketball Championship History [http://www.ncaa.com/history/basketball-men/d2]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, the team was ranked number 48 on the [[ESPN]] list of the most prestigious basketball programs since the 1984â85 season.&lt;ref&gt;Harold Shelton, Nick Loucks and Chris Fallica, [http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=3481014 &quot;Counting down the most prestigious programs since 1984â85&quot;], [[ESPN]], July 21, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mocs won the SoCon tournament [[2009 Southern Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|once again in 2009]].  Defeating the [[College of Charleston Cougars men's basketball|College of Charleston Cougars]] 80-69 in the championship game on their home court at the [[McKenzie Arena]], the Mocs punched their ticket to the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]], their first since [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005]].

Jimmy Fallon from ''[[Late Night with Jimmy Fallon]]'' chose the Mocs as his team of choice going into the 2009 NCAA Tournament.  The Wednesday night (March 18) show included a live Skype chat with Head Coach John Shulman, as well as representatives of the pep band and cheerleading squads made in studio.  Fallon's band &quot;The Roots&quot; wrote and performed an ode to Shulman titled, &quot;The Don Juan of the SoCon&quot; and Shulman and his six seniors (Nicchaeus Doaks, Zach Ferrell, Kevin Goffney, Khalil Hartwell, Stephen McDowell and Keyron Sheard) made an in-studio appearance following their tournament game with UConn.

The Lady Mocs are the most successful women's basketball program in Southern Conference history with 15 regular season titles since 1983â1984, 10 consecutive conference championships at the end of 2008â2009 and 14 overall conference championships.&lt;ref name=&quot;gomocs.com&quot;&gt;http://www.gomocs.com//pdf4/656557.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

;Golf
The menâs golf squad won its third consecutive Southern Conference trophy and finished 18th in the NCAA Championships in 2009.

Womenâs golf posted a 3.46 team GOA in the spring while advancing to the NCAA Division I finals in just the second year of the program since disbanding in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nmnathletics.com/fls/17700/Sidebars/Women%27s%20Golf/Postseason%20Guide_Wglf0809.pdf?SPSID=88666&amp;SPID=10574&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17700&lt;/ref&gt;

;Softball
The Mocsâ softball team has won 11 regular season titles and 10 SoCon Tournament Championships.  They have also made 7 NCAA tournament appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;gomocs.com&quot;/&gt;

;Wrestling
Chattanooga is home to the only NCAA Division I wrestling program in the state of Tennessee.  The Mocs Wrestling team won their fifth consecutive Socon title in 2008â2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;gomocs.com&quot;/&gt;

;Football
The team plays in the Southern Conference in Division I FCS (formerly I-AA) (Socon). Terrell Owens played college football at UTC. The team posted consecutive winning seasons in 2009â2010 and 2010â2011. They play in Finley stadium, which has hosted the division-1 national championship for the last 13 years.

==Athletic venues==
* [[Chamberlain Field]] â (1908â1997)
* [[W. Max Finley Stadium|Finley Stadium]] â (1997âpresent)
* [[Maclellan Gymnasium]] and [[natatorium]] â (Gym opened 1961; natatorium opened 1968)
* [[McKenzie Arena]] â (1982âpresent) aka the Roundhouse, due to its circular shape and the city's association with the railroad industry.

==University nickname==
The school's athletic teams are called the Mocs.  The teams were nicknamed Moccasins until 1996.  (The origin of the name is uncertain; however, [[Moccasin Bend]] is a large horseshoe-shaped bend in the [[Tennessee River]] directly below [[Lookout Mountain]].)

The mascot has taken on four distinct forms, with a [[water moccasin]] being the mascot in the 1920s, and then a [[Moccasin (footwear)|moccasin]] shoe (known as &quot;The Shoe&quot;) was actually used as the school's mascot at times in the 1960s and 1970s.  From the 1970s until 1996, the mascot was [[Chief Moccanooga]], an exaggerated [[Cherokee]] tribesman.

In 1996, due to concerns over ethnic sensitivity,&lt;ref&gt;George Dohrmann, [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/11280858.html?dids=11280858:11280858&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Mar+19%2C+1997&amp;author=GEORGE+DOHRMANN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=1&amp;desc=COLLEGE+BASKETBALL+%2F+NCAA+TOURNAMENT%3B+Big+Mack+Has+%27Em+Loving+the+Mocs%3B+McCarthy%27s+Team%2C+in+the+Sweet+16%2C+May+Even+Rate+Over+Barbecue+in+Chattanooga &quot;Big Mack has 'em loving the Mocs; McCarthy's team, in the Sweet 16, may even rate over barbecue in Chattanooga&quot;], [[LA Times]], Mar 19, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; the Moccasins name and image were dropped in favor of the shortened &quot;Mocs&quot; and an [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphized]] [[northern mockingbird]], in accordance with the state bird, named &quot;Scrappy&quot; dressed as a railroad engineer.  The school's main athletic logo features Scrappy riding a train (a reference to Chattanooga's history as a major [[railroad]] hub and to the song &quot;[[Chattanooga Choo Choo]]&quot;).  The mascot takes its name from former [[American football|football]] coach [[Andy Moore (American football)|A. C. &quot;Scrappy&quot; Moore]].

==Fight song==
The fight song for Chattanooga is &quot;Fight Chattanooga&quot;.

==Band==
