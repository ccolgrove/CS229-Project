[[Image:Crompton millscape.png|thumb|right|250px|Following a building boom during the 1860sâ1870s, [[Shaw and Crompton|Crompton]] became a major [[mill town]], dominated by large rectangular brick-built [[cotton mill]]s.]]
This is a list of '''[[cotton mill|textile factories]] that have existed in [[Shaw and Crompton]]''', formerly of [[Lancashire]] and now in [[Greater Manchester]], England.

From the [[Industrial Revolution]] until the 20th century, Crompton (as it was then mainly known) was a major centre of [[textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution|textile manufacture]], particularly [[Spinning (textiles)|cotton spinning]]. During this period, it was dominated by large rectangular brick-built factories, some of which still remain today as warehouses or distribution centres. The town has seen forty-eight separate textile factories built within its boundaries.

{{TMtr|Ash|Jubilee Street|{{coord|53.5778|-2.0852|display=inline|region:GB|format=dms}}|&lt;ref name=GH21&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1985|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=758-dhi&amp;cid=2#2 National Archive Records on The Ash Group]&lt;/ref&gt;| Ash Spinning Co. Ltd's was incorporated on 25 January 1883 to build a cotton spinning mill holding about 80,000 mule spindles. 'Ash' mill was one of two mills in Shaw that was built twice. The original attempt blew down in a gale two months before it was completed. Regardless of this the mill was still finished by its deadline at cost of Â£20,000. 

The mill was extended twice in 1886 and 1920 respectively. It ceased production in 1984 and was demolished the following year. Ash's employees were transferred to Grape mill in neighbouring [[Royton]].
 
After lying empty for 12 years the site is now occupied by approximately one seventh of [[Littlewoods Shaw National Distribution Centre|Littlewoods' Shaw National Distribution Centre]].|File:Ash Mill - Shaw &amp; Crompton.jpg| Wild &amp; Collins| 1883||1985|color=dark}} 
{{TMtr|Beal|Beal Lane||&lt;ref name=GH19&gt;{{Harvnb|Gurr|Hunt|1985|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;| In its relatively short life this original Beal mill was operated by many different companies. William Taylor and Robinson &amp; Co with the former still present in 1852 and later William Nutter and Co were documented to run the mill in 1861. Upon its demise in 1875 a company called Marsden and Berry were running the mill.

Some facts: 

* 5 storeys, 30bays x 12
* Spindleage: 1915; 97,928
* Counts, 50â70 weft, 40â44 twists
* It was built at a cost of Â£32,704 with a further cost of Â£41,349 for machinery and furnishings.
* It burnt an average of 70 tons of coal each week at a price of 8s a ton.
* It employed approximately 150 men and 75 women.
* It consumed 130 'good American quality' bales of cotton each week.
* There were 10,000 shareholders in the company at the cost of [[Pound sterling|GBÂ£]]10 a share.

The 19,070 sq. yard site was occupied for some time by a company called Buckton which constructed roads and buildings until it too was, somewhat ironically, demolished and the land redeveloped for a small housing estate which was completed in the 1990s.|File:Mill-image-pending.jpg|Joseph Stott| 1889 || 1933|color=dark}}
 
{{TMtr|Briar|Beal Lane|{{coord|53.5762|-2.0890|display=inline|region:GB|format=dms}}|&lt;ref name=GH19/&gt;| Built and operated by Briar Mill Ltd. Which became bankrupt and refloated as Briar Mill (1920) Ltd. Sometime in the mid 1950s it was occupied by the [[Lancashire Cotton Corporation]] and later [[Courtaulds|Courtaulds Ltd.]] in 1964. It ceased all cotton production in 1988 when it was converted for warehousing and distribution of catalogue items by a company which was then known as J.D. Williams Ltd. The company also purchased neighbouring Lilac Mill and constructed a bridge to join Briar's second floor to Lilac's first floor. In the early 2000s, operation of the mill transferred to Fulfillment Logistics, a division of J.D. Williams, who continue to use the complex for the same purpose.

In the 1980s Bolton steeplejack [[Fred Dibnah]] was paid Â£7000 to demolish Briar mill's chimney one brick at a time. His efforts and dare-devil methods are documented in the his autobiographic BBC TV series '[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421097/ The Fred Dibnah Story].|File:Briar Mill, Shaw - geograph.org.uk - 86825.jpg|[[Sir Philip Stott, 1st Baronet|Philip Sydney Stott]]| 1906||Standing&lt;br /&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}|color=dark}}

In 1852, Taylor and Greeves were shown as the mill owners but evidently they weren't very prosperous as production ceased soon afterwards. The mill is shown on the 1849 [[tithe maps|Tithe map]] of the area. 

In 1908 the land had been given by James Milne to the [[Church of England]] who built a sister church to St. James East Crompton on the site and called it St. Saviours Crompton Fold. The Church and its very pleasant setting still remain almost 100 years later.||UNKNOWN| c.1790 || c.1852 |color=dark}}

This event was filmed and featured in his autobiographic TV series '[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0421097/ The Fred Dibnah Story]'. The site remained empty for several years after the mills' demolition until the land was used for a brand new housing estate. The mill is survived by its original reservoir which is today used for fishing and its namesake Cape Bowling Club complete with [[bowling green]].The only surviving legacy of Cape mill, its reservoir, which stands adjacent to Duke mill's reservoir and is also used for licensed fishing.|Image:CapeMillReservoir2007.JPG||P.S.

This ceased following a fire in 1983 and it was taken over in 1975 by Sammy-Woodland Ltd for scarf manufacture. Finally closed 1994 and demolished 1995. The steam engine was saved and is at Bolton.

Although its main gates were located on Eastway, the mill semi-occupied the self titled 'Dawn Street' formerly known as 'Newtown' when Shaw Mill was built there.|Image:Dawn mill1.jpg|P.S. Stott|  1901 || 2006 |color=dark}}

Osram have since moved away from the United Kingdom, however and the mill is now used for mail order processing.

Duke Mill is currently the oldest surviving cotton mill in Crompton and arguably the best maintained.|Image:DukeMillShaw2007a.jpg|Joseph Stott| 1883||Standing&lt;br /&gt;{{CURRENTYEAR}}|color=dark}}

The mill is currently part of [[Littlewoods Shaw National Distribution Centre|Littlewoods' Shaw National Distribution Centre]] who have adapted it for warehousing and bulk storage for their catalogue distribution operations. It's linked by a new building to Lily (No.2) mill and by a bridge to a newer building that occupies the site of Rutland mill. Signs of its cotton heritage can still be seen including its engine house with original crane system which is still largely intact.

Although named 'Shaw 3' by the company its official mill name 'Newby' is still affectionately used by workers at the site. 'Elm' is never used and most people, both workers and local residents, would be unaware of this original name.|Image:PMBNewby.jpg|Joseph Stott| 1890||Standing|color=dark}}

ISBN 0-902809-38-5.&lt;/ref&gt;|The building of Lilac actually began in 1914. The first attempt was thwarted by gale force winds on 14 September of that year which brought the predominantly iron structure to the ground with a thundering crash that could be heard for miles around. Fortunately no one was working there at the time and so there were no casualties. 

The second attempt was completed by 1918 by which time its original purpose for cotton had become a lower priority to World War I and it was initially used as a factory for assembling aircraft components. Finally it became used for spinning cotton in the following year. Lilac, along with Park Mill was the last mill in Shaw and Crompton to spin cotton in 1989. 

Currently part of JD Williams Co Ltd National Distribution Centre it has been adapted for offices and warehousing, linking in 2000 on two levels to the company's new highbay automated warehouse.
