The '''Penn State Nittany Lions''' ('''Lady Lions''' for women's basketball only) are the athletic teams of [[Pennsylvania State University#Athletics|Pennsylvania State University]]. The school colors are [[navy blue|blue]] and [[white]].  The school mascot is the [[Nittany Lion]]. The Intercollegiate Athletics Logo was commissioned in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://publications.psu.edu/graph_ident_system/graphathlogo.html Penn State Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State participates in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I FBS]] and in the [[Big Ten Conference]] for most sports. A few sports participate in different conferences because they are not sponsored by the Big Ten: men's [[lacrosse]] in the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], women's lacrosse in [[American Lacrosse Conference]], and men's [[volleyball]] in the [[Eastern Intercollegiate Volleyball Association]] (EIVA). The fencing teams operate as independents. 

Penn State has finished in the top 25 each of the 15 years that the [[NACDA Director's Cup]] has been in existence. This is a list compiled by the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]] that charts institutions' overall success in college sports. PSU finished in 9th place in the 2007-08 standings, and it was the eighth time that they finished in the top 10. It was the highest finish in five years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/genrel/062608aab.html Penn State No. 9 in final Director Cup standings]&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State has a large football following and attracts tens of thousands of visitors to its campus; the surrounding area is known as &quot;Happy Valley&quot; for tailgating and games on autumn Saturdays in [[Beaver Stadium]]. The largest crowd ever at Beaver Stadium was on September 14, 2002, as 110,753 people watched the Nittany Lions defeat the [[University of Nebraska]] by a score of 40-7. The school has earned a reputation as &quot;[[Linebacker]] U&quot; for the number of high-quality linebackers trained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.collegian.psu.edu/archive/2005/04/04-22-05tdc/04-22-05dsports-06.asp Bringing back linebacker U]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joe Paterno]] was the head coach for the Nittany Lion football team from 1966 until he was fired on November 9, 2011, in the aftermath of the [[Penn State sex abuse scandal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-400_162-57321984/paterno-fired-over-penn-st-child-abuse-scandal/|title=Paterno fired over Penn St. child abuse scandal|publisher=[[CBS News]]|date=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was regarded as one of the most successful national coaches, holding the record for wins and bowl appearance. Penn State plays in two football &quot;trophy games&quot; with other members of the Big Ten. They are for the [[Governor's Victory Bell]] with the [[University of Minnesota]] and the season-ending [[Land Grant Trophy]] game versus [[Michigan State University]]. 

Prior to joining the Big Ten, Penn State was one of the strongest of the independent schools in college football. They played a number of schools regularly, including [[University of Pittsburgh|Pitt]], [[Syracuse University|Syracuse]], [[West Virginia University|West Virginia]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]] and [[University of Alabama|Alabama]]. Penn State has won the prestigious [[Lambert-Meadowlands Trophy]], awarded for Eastern football supremacy, a record 28 times as of 2010. Penn State has also been named the ECAC FBS Team of the Year for a record 13th time.[[Image:BlueBandPano.jpg|right|240px|thumb|Panorama of 7th largest crowd in school history, 13 Oct 2007]]

Penn State won consensus [[NCAA Division I-A national football championship|National Championships]] in 1982 and 1986, both under Coach Paterno. The 1986 team won by defeating the [[Miami Hurricanes football|University of Miami]] in the 1987 [[Fiesta Bowl]], which remains the most watched college football game in history. The school has had a number of other undefeated teams including 1909, 1911, 1912, 1920, 1921, 1947, 1968, 1969, 1973 and 1994, some of which have been awarded [[Mythical National Championship|national championships]] from various sources. Penn State has the best winning percentage of any school in [[bowl games]] with a record of 26&amp;ndash;12&amp;ndash;2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/bowls/team_records_best_winpct.php Winning percentage in bowl games].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:PSU Senior Section.JPG|left|thumbnail|The Senior Section, dressed to spell out the letter &quot;S&quot;]]
Penn State is also among the leaders nationwide in terms of players advancing to the professional level. As of 2006, 29 former Penn State players and coaches were on the rosters of [[National Football League|NFL]] teams, the tenth-highest such placement rate in the country. Penn State has been represented in at least one of the teams participating in the [[Super Bowl]] 37 of the 41 times the championship game has been played.&lt;ref name=&quot;nfl&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gopsusports.com/pressreleases/pressrelease.cfm?anncid=11640|title=Nittany Lions Well-Represented on Super Bowl XLI Squads|publisher=Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics|date=2007-01-22|accessdate=2007-01-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070223165320/http://www.gopsusports.com/pressreleases/pressrelease.cfm?anncid=11640 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A recent report indicated that Penn State's football program ranks 12th nationwide in terms of economic contributions to each program's university, athletic department, conference, and community. The report, based on ticket sales, sponsorships, football program expenses, athletic department expenses (non-football), shared conference profits, and county revenue figures during home football games, revealed that the Nittany Lions are presently worth roughly [[United States dollar|US$]]63 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forbes.com/business/2006/12/22/college-football-ncaa-business_cz_jg_1222collegefootball.html|title=The Most Valuable College Football Teams|publisher=Forbes.com|coauthors=Jack Gage, Peter J. Schwartz|date=2006-12-22|accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basketball===
{{Main|Penn State Nittany Lions basketball}}

Penn State's men's basketball program reached the [[Final Four]] in 1954, though the best finish in recent years occurred in 2000-2001 with a trip to the Sweet Sixteen of the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] after a win over [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]] in the round of 32.  The most recent postseason championship for Penn State was the Men's National Invitational Tournament April 2, 2009.  Penn State beat Baylor 69-63 to capture its first national title in school history.

The women's basketball teams (the only Penn State Athletic team not known as &quot;Nittany Lions,&quot; but instead using the moniker &quot;Lady Lions&quot;) have had more success, often gaining berths into the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's NCAA tournament]], reaching the Final Four once.  In 1976, the Lady Lions earned a berth in the [[AIAW Women's Basketball Tournament|AIAW women's basketball tournament]], which Penn State hosted that year.

Notable alumni include: Frank Brickowski, John Amaechi, Calvin Booth, Mike Costello, Stanley Pringle, Geary Claxton, Jamelle Cornley, Suzy McConnell.

===Volleyball===
Penn State is home to one of the top men's and women's [[volleyball]] programs. Penn State is one of only 5 schools -- and the only school not in California -- to win a NCAA Championship for both men and women's volleyball, the others being Stanford, UCLA, [[USC Volleyball|USC]], and [[Long Beach State]].

====Women's volleyball====
{{main|Penn State Nittany Lions women's volleyball}}

[[Image:PennStVball.JPG|right|300px|thumb|Penn State practicing before the 2007 NCAA championship against [[Stanford]] in [[Sacramento, California]] at the [[ARCO Arena]]]]

The women's volleyball team is coached by [[Russ Rose]], who, since his first season in 1979, has led the Lions to a record of 1,033-164, an .863 winning percentage, which ranks first in [[NCAA]] history. Rose has won 1,033 of the program's 1,084 total wins. On December 17, 2009, Rose earned his 1,000th career victory with a win against [[Hawaii Rainbow Wahine volleyball|Hawai{{okina}}i]] in the [[2009 NCAA Division I Women's Volleyball Tournament|2009 NCAA National Semifinals]].  In all 32 seasons except for 2001 under Rose, there have been at least 1 [[All-American]] on his team. 

[[File:Penn State Volleyball 2008 National Champions.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Penn State volleyball team poses with the 2008 NCAA championship trophy after defeating Stanford University in the final.]]

The program is one of only two [[NCAA Division I|DI]] universities to appear in every NCAA tournament (1981â2010). They have won five NCAA [[NCAA Women's Volleyball Championship|National Championships]] in 1999, 2007, 2008, 2009 &amp; 2010. They were the national runners-up in 1993, 1997 and 1998 and also reached the Final Four in 1994. 

The Women's team holds a five NCAA records. They hold the NCAA record for consecutive matches won, when they broke [[USC Volleyball|USC's]] record of 52 straight on November 14, 2008 with a sweep of [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gopsusports.cstv.com/sports/w-volley/recaps/111408aaa.html No. 1 Women's Volleyball Sets NCAA Record, Sweeps No. 17 Illinois]&lt;/ref&gt; As of the end of the 2009 season, the streak stood at 102 wins. The Lions won their first 7 matches of the 2010 season, before the streak was finally snapped on September 11, 2010 against Stanford in Gainesville, Florida at a record 109 wins. They have won 24 consecutive postseason games covering their four consecutive National Championships from 2007-2010.

In 2008, they became the first women's volleyball program in Division I, II, or III, to go through the regular season without losing a single set. Penn State broke the NCAA record of consecutive sets won, winning 111 sets in a row up until the third set of the 2008 NCAA National Semifinals. The previous record was 105 set by [[Florida Gators women's volleyball|Florida]] in 2003. In 2009, they became the first Division I team to win three straight NCAA titles, and also became the first team to win two straight NCAA titles with undefeated seasons, as they went 38-0 in 2008 &amp; 2009.

The Lions had an unprecedented success when Penn State was in the [[Atlantic 10]] conference, as they won the title all 8 years without losing a single conference match before joining the [[Big Ten]]. In the Big Ten, they have won 14 titles since 1991, including a conference record 8 straight (2003â10). During Big Ten play, they have had a perfect 20-0 conference record 6 times (1998, 1999, 2005, 2007, 2008, 2009), more than any other Big Ten school who have accomplished the feat combined. They also received Big Ten Freshman of the Year 8 of the 9 past seasons (2002â07, 2009-10), the Big Ten Player of the Year 6 straight seasons (2005â10) and became the first school in Big Ten history to sweep all 4 major Big Ten honors (2005).

====Men's volleyball====
{{main|Penn State Nittany Lions men's volleyball}}
[[Image:PSU volleyball at the WH.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The men's volleyball team is honored in June 2008 at the [[White House]] for [[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] for winning the [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship|2008 NCAA Championship]]]]
The men's volleyball team is coached by [[Mark Pavlik]]. The program has won two NCAA [[NCAA Men's Volleyball Championship|National Championships]] in 1994 and 2008 and 16 [[EIVA]] titles out of 17 years, including 10 consecutive. They finished as NCAA National runners-up in 1982, 1995 and 2006, to UCLA each time (twice at Rec Hall). They reached the NCAA final four 24 times including 13 out of the last 14 years through the 2008 season and an NCAA record 10 consecutive (1998â2008). 

The men's first national title came in 1994, when they beat powerhouse [[UCLA]] in five sets after being down 11-4 in the fourth set and then winning the fourth 15-12 and the fifth with the same score. The win made Penn State the first school outside of [[California]] in the then-24 year history to win an NCAA Men's volleyball championship. They won the NCAA title again in 2008, defeating [[Pepperdine]] 3-1. With the win, Penn State men and women's programs swept the volleyball championships in the same academic year, joining Stanford from 1996-97 to be the only schools to accomplish the rare feat.

Pavlik was named the 2008 [[AVCA]] National Coach of the Year.

===Fencing===
Penn State is a [[fencing]] powerhouse, winning a record 12 [[NCAA Fencing team championship|national championships]] in the sport since the NCAA began awarding titles in combined men's and women's fencing in 1990. The team has finished either 1st or 2nd every season since 1990 except for 2005 (when they finished 3rd) and 2008 (when they finished 4th).

The women's field hockey team is coached by Char Morett, Lisa Bervinchak-Love and Annie Zinkavich, all of whom are former Penn State Field Hockey players.  In 2007, the women's [[Field Hockey]] team reached the National Championship game, but fell to undefeated [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|UNC]], 3-0. In their tournament run, they were able to defeat two time defending champion [[University of Maryland, College Park|Maryland]], 1-0, and defending national runner-up [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest]], 2-0. Jen Long was nominated for the [[Honda Award]] for her efforts. They also finished as NCAA runner ups in 2002, losing to Wake Forest in the title game 2-0 after defeating Old Dominion 3-2 in the semifinals.  2002 marked the first time Penn State reached the NCAA Finals and second time reaching the Final Four. The team won the AIAW national championships in 1980 and 1981. In 2011 the women's field hockey team won it's fifth ever Big Ten title after defeating Michigan 3-2, and first since 1998 when they again defeated Michigan 3-1.

===Soccer===
====Men's soccer====
{{main|Penn State Nittany Lions men's soccer}}
Before the NCAA began its tournament in 1959, the annual national champion was declared by the [[Intercollegiate Soccer Football Association]] from 1926 to 1958, the result of polls and the subjective opinion of the ISFA administrators.  In that time, Penn State shared eight national championships and was selected three times as champion outright (1929, 1938, 1954).  The rival College Soccer Bowl was held from 1950-1952 in an attempt to decide a national champion on the field. Penn State gained a last-minute tie in the 1950 championship final.  The team won in 1951; however, the ISFA failed to select Penn State that year.

====Women's soccer====
Women's soccer has also been particularly strong, as the program has won 14 straight Big Ten Championships through the 2011 season. The team capped its 2010 Big Ten season with four straight wins including a last-minute 1-0 double-overtime victory over Michigan on Nov. 7. The 14 consecutive Big Ten titles is an all-time Big Ten record for women's teams, surpassing the 12 by Michigan swimming &amp; diving of the 1990s. Currently, PSU is ahead of Northwestern's women's tennis squad, which obtained its 14th straight title in 2011.

===Cross Country===
The men's cross country team won NCAA titles in 1942, 1947 and 1950.  Before the NCAA began sponsoring the cross country championship in 1938, and unlike today, the annual [[ICAAAA]] meet was a premier national championship event for track and field and cross country.  The team won ICAAAA championships in 1926, 1927, 1928 and 1930.  Penn State runners won the individual ICAAAA titles in 1920 (John Romig), 1927 and 1928 (William Cox, consecutively).  PSU men also won ICAAAA team titles in 1950, 1951, 1960 and 2000, as well as individual crowns in 1938, 1946, 1987 and 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecac.org/affiliates/IC4A/xcountry/history/all-time| accessdate=2010-06-03|title= Inter-Collegiate Association of Amateur Athletes of America All-Time Champions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the women's championships prior to 1982 occurred under the auspices of the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW). The NCAA did not start sponsoring women's championships until the 1981-82 academic year. Some of the men's championships occurred [[Pre-NCAA intercollegiate championships|prior to the NCAA sponsoring a championship]] in that sport (for example, the NCAA did not start sponsoring a men's soccer championship until 1959) and some sports have never had recognized NCAA championships (such as Division I-A football).
