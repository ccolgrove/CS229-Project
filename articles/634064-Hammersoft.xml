'''John Samuel Waters, Jr.''' (born April 22, 1946) is an American filmmaker, actor, stand-up comedian, writer, journalist, visual artist, and art collector, who rose to fame in the early 1970s for his [[Cinema of Transgression|transgressive cult films]]. Waters' 1970s and early '80s trash films feature his regular troupe of actors known as the [[Dreamlanders]]âamong them [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], [[Mink Stole]], [[David Lochary]], [[Mary Vivian Pearce]], and [[Edith Massey]]. Starting with ''[[Desperate Living]]'' (1977), Waters began casting real-life convicted criminals ([[Liz Renay]], [[Patricia Hearst]]) and infamous people ([[Traci Lords]], a former [[porn]] star).

Waters skirted mainstream film making with ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'' (1988), which introduced [[Ricki Lake]] and earned a modest gross of $8 million domestically. In 2002, ''Hairspray'' was adapted to a long-running [[Hairspray (musical)|Broadway musical]], which itself was adapted to a hit [[Hairspray (2007 film)|musical film]] which earned more than $200 million worldwide. After the crossover success of the original film version of ''Hairspray'', Waters's films began featuring familiar actors and celebrities such as [[Johnny Depp]], [[Edward Furlong]], [[Melanie Griffith]], [[Chris Isaak]], [[Johnny Knoxville]], [[Martha Plimpton]], [[Christina Ricci]], [[Lili Taylor]], [[Kathleen Turner]], and [[Tracey Ullman]].

Although he has apartments in [[New York City]] and [[San Francisco]], as well as a summer home in [[Provincetown]], Waters still mainly resides in his hometown of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], where all his films are set. He is recognizable by his trademark pencil-thin moustache, a look he has retained since the early 1970s.

==Early life==
Waters was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], the son of Patricia Ann ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] Whitaker) and John Samuel Waters, who was a manufacturer of fire-protection equipment.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Waters Biography 1946-&quot;&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/John-Waters.html John Waters Biography (1946â)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Waters grew up in [[Lutherville-Timonium, Maryland|Lutherville, Maryland]], a suburb of Baltimore. His boyhood friend and muse Glenn Milstead, later known as [[Divine (actor)|Divine]], also lived in Lutherville.

The movie ''[[Lili]]'' inspired an interest in puppets in the seven-year-old Waters, who proceeded to stage violent versions of ''[[Punch and Judy]]'' for children's birthday parties. Biographer Robert L. Pela says that Waters's mother believes the puppets in ''Lili'' had the greatest influence on Waters's subsequent career (though Pela believes tacky films at a local drive-in, which the young Waters watched from a distance through binoculars, had a greater effect).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pela|first=Robert L |year=2002|title=Filthy: The Weird World of John Waters|publisher=Alyson Publishing|isbn=1-55583-625-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters attended [[Calvert Hall College High School]] in nearby [[Towson, Maryland|Towson]]. For his sixteenth birthday, Waters received an [[8mm film|8mm]] movie camera from his maternal grandmother, Stella Whitaker.

==Career==
===Early career===
[[File:John Waters Carlton Cannes.JPG|thumb|175px|John Waters at the [[2007 Cannes Film Festival]].]]
His first short film was ''[[Hag in a Black Leather Jacket]]''. According to Waters, the film was shown only once in a &quot;beatnik coffee house&quot; in Baltimore, although in later years he has included it in his traveling photography exhibit.

Waters enrolled at [[New York University]] (NYU). The school, however, was not what Waters had in mind:

&lt;blockquote&gt;NYU...I was there for about five minutes. I don't know what I was thinking about. I went to one class and they kept talking about ''[[The Battleship Potemkin|Potemkin]]'' and that isn't what I wanted to talk about. I had just gone to see ''[[George Weiss (producer)#The Olga series|Olga's House of Shame]]''. That was what I was more into.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Extremely influential to his creative mind, Waters tells [[Robert K. Elder]] in an interview for ''[[The Film That Changed My Life]]'', was [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|''The Wizard of Oz'']].

&lt;blockquote&gt;I was always drawn to forbidden subject matter in the very, very beginning. ''The Wizard of Oz'' opened me up because it was one of the first movies I ever saw. It opened me up to villainy, to screenwriting, to costumes. And great dialogue. I think the witch has great, great dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Waters, John. Interview by Robert K. Elder. ''The Film That Changed My Life'' by Robert K. Elder. Chicago: Chicago Review Press, 2011. N. p281. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Waters has further credited his influences as, among others, [[Rainer Werner Fassbinder]], [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], [[Federico Fellini]], and [[Ingmar Bergman]]. He has stated that he takes an equal amount of joy and influence from high-brow &quot;art&quot; films and sleazy exploitation films: &quot;I love Bergman and ''[[I Dismember Mama]]''&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

In January 1966, Waters and some friends were caught smoking marijuana on the grounds of NYU; he was soon kicked out of his NYU dormitory. Waters returned to Baltimore, where he completed his next two short films ''[[Roman Candles (film)|Roman Candles]]'' and ''[[Eat Your Makeup]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;John Waters Biography 1946-&quot;/&gt; These were followed by the feature-length films ''[[Mondo Trasho]]'' and ''[[Multiple Maniacs]]''.

Waters's films would become Divine's primary star vehicles. All of Waters's early films were shot in the Baltimore area with his company of local actors, the [[Dreamlanders]]. In addition to Divine, the group included [[Mink Stole]], [[Cookie Mueller]], [[Edith Massey]], [[David Lochary]], [[Mary Vivian Pearce]], [[Susan Walsh]], and others. These early films were among the first picked up for distribution by the fledgling [[New Line Cinema]]. Waters's films premiered at Baltimore's [[Senator Theatre]] and sometimes at the [[Charles Theatre]].

Waters's early campy movies present filthily lovable characters in outrageous situations with hyperbolic dialogue. ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'', ''[[Female Trouble]]'', and ''[[Desperate Living]]'', which he labeled the ''Trash Trilogy'', pushed hard at the boundaries of conventional propriety and movie censorship. A particularly notorious scene from ''Pink Flamingos'', added as a non sequitur to the film's end, featuredâin one continuous take without special effectsâa small dog defecating and Divine eating its feces.

===Move towards the mainstream===
[[Image:John Waters by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|right|Waters in New York City.]]
Waters's 1981 film ''[[Polyester (film)|Polyester]]'' starred Divine opposite former teen idol [[Tab Hunter]]. Since then, his films have become less controversial and more mainstream, although works such as ''[[Hairspray (1988 film)|Hairspray]]'', ''[[Cry-Baby]]'', ''[[Serial Mom]]'', ''[[Pecker (film)|Pecker]]'', and ''[[Cecil B. Demented]]'' still retain his trademark inventiveness. The film ''Hairspray'' was turned into a [[Hairspray (musical)|hit Broadway musical]] which swept the [[57th Tony Awards|2003 Tony Awards]], and a [[Hairspray (2007 film)|film adaptation of the Broadway musical]] was released in theaters on July 20, 2007 to positive reviews and commercial success. ''Cry-Baby'', itself a musical, was also converted into a [[Cry-Baby (musical)|Broadway musical]].

In 2004, the [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|NC-17]]-rated ''[[A Dirty Shame]]'' marked a return to his earlier, more controversial work of the 1970s. He had a cameo in ''[[Jackass: Number Two]]'', which starred ''Dirty Shame'' co-star [[Johnny Knoxville]], and another small role as [[Paparazzi|paparazzo]] Pete Peters in 2004's ''[[Seed of Chucky]]''.

In 2007, he became the host (&quot;The Groom Reaper&quot;) of ''[['Til Death Do Us Part (US TV series)|'Til Death Do Us Part]]'', a program on America's [[Court TV]] network featuring dramatizations of marriages that soured and ended in murder.

In 2008, Waters was planning to make a children's Christmas film called ''Fruitcake''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indyweek.com/gyrobase/Content?oid=oid%3A160709 Indyweek.com Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; starring [[Johnny Knoxville]] and [[Parker Posey]].&lt;ref name =gaychicago&gt;{{cite news

I sold the idea, got a development deal, got paid a great salary to write it â and now the company is no longer around, which is the case with many independent film companies these days.&quot;&lt;ref name=tribune&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-12-03/entertainment/ct-mov-1203-chicago-closeup-20101203_1_christmas-cards-tv-christmas-specials-john-waters|title=John Waters loves Christmas. Really.|last=Metz|first=Nina|date=3 December 2010|work=Chicago Tribune|accessdate=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waters has been known to create characters with alliterated names for his films including Corny Collins, Donald and Donna Dasher, Dawn Davenport, Fat Fuck Frank, Francine Fishpaw, Link Larkin, Motormouth Maybelle, Mole McHenry, Penny and Prudy Pingleton, Ramona Rickettes, Sylvia Stickles, Todd Tomorrow, Tracy Turnblad, Ursula Udders, Wade Walker, and Wanda Woodward.

===Fine art===
Since the early 1990s, Waters has been making photo-based artwork and installations that have been internationally exhibited in galleries and museums. In 2004, the [[New Museum]] in NYC presented a retrospective of his artwork curated by [[Marvin Heiferman]] and Lisa Phillips. His most recent exhibition was ''Rear Projection'' in April, 2009, at the [[Marianne Boesky Gallery]] in New York and the [[Gagosian Gallery]] in Los Angeles.

Watersâs pieces are often comical, such as ''Rush'' (2009), a super-sized, tipped-over bottle of [[poppers]] (nitrite inhalants) and ''Hardy Har'' (2006), a photograph of flowers that squirts water at anyone who traverses a taped line on the floor. Waters has characterized his art as conceptual, saying that âthe craft is not the issue here. The idea is. And the presentation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Levi, Lawrence. &quot;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/32381/inside-man/ Inside Man].&quot; ''[[Modern Painters (magazine)|Modern Painters]]'', September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other interests===
Puffing constantly on a cigarette, Waters appeared in a short film shown in film art houses announcing that &quot;no smoking&quot; is permitted in the theaters. This short spot was filmed by Waters for the [[Nuart Theatre]] (a [[Landmark Theatres|Landmark Theater]]) in [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles, California]], in appreciation to the theater for showing ''[[Pink Flamingos]]'' for many years. It is shown immediately before any of his films, and before the midnight movie showing of ''[[The Rocky Horror Picture Show]]''.

He played a minister in ''[[Blood Feast 2: All U Can Eat]]'', which was directed by one of his idols, [[Herschell Gordon Lewis]], and is a sequel to [[Blood Feast|one of his favorite exploitation films]].

==Personal life==
In 2009, he advocated the parole of former [[Manson family]] member [[Leslie Van Houten]]. He devotes a chapter to Van Houten in his book ''Role Models'' published by [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] in May 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-waters/leslie-van-houten-a-frien_b_246953.html Leslie Van Houten: A Friendship] 2009-08-03&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/bal-john-waters-houten-0807,0,7700228.story John Waters gets serious: Usually droll director sets aside the sarcasm as he writes about his friendship with Manson family member Leslie Van Houten] 2009-08-07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbur.org/news/npr/111675368 John Waters Argues For Murderer's Release] 2009-08-10&lt;/ref&gt;

An openly gay man, Waters is also an avid supporter of [[gay rights]] and [[gay pride]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreamlandnews.com/fans/grizelda.shtml Dreamland News: Fans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Waters was a great fan of the music of [[Little Richard]] when growing up, claiming that ever since shoplifting a copy of his song &quot;[[Lucille (song)|Lucille]]&quot; in 1957, &quot;I've wished I could somehow climb into Little Richard's body, hook up his heart and vocal cords to my own, and switch identities.&quot; In 1987, ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine employed Waters to interview his idol, but the interview did not go well, with Waters later remarking that &quot;it turned into kind of a disaster.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Waters | first = John | coauthors = | title = When John Waters met Little Richard | work = [[The Guardian]] | date = 28 November 2010 | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2010/nov/28/john-waters-met-little-richard | accessdate = 30 November 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recurring cast members==
Waters often casts certain actors/actresses more than once in his films.
