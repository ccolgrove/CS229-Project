'''ZOE Broadcasting Network, Inc.''' is a [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[television network]] of Jesus is Lord Movement leader [[Eddie Villanueva]]. ZOE is currently an affiliate of [[GMA Network]].  This stations studios and offices are located at 22/F Strata 2000 Bldg, F. Ortigas Jr. Ave., Ortigas Center, [[Pasig City]]. With transmitters at Brgy. San Roque, [[Antipolo City]]. Currently, its flagship television station, ([[DZOE-TV|DZOE-TV 11]] Manila) and several of its provincial stations are currently operated by [[GMA Network]] through [[GMA News TV]].

==History==
The frequency rights of [[DZOE-TV|Channel 11]] in [[Metro Manila]] was given to a joint venture of the influential religious groups ''[[El Shaddai]]'' headed by [[Mike Velarde]] and ''[[Jesus Is Lord Church]]'' headed by [[Eddie Villanueva]] in mid 1990s. Conflict of interests started the two groups to contest the full ownership of the company. The Philippine Congress, composed of the Senate and the House of Representatives intervened and awarded to [[Eddie Villanueva]] and ''Jesus Is Lord Movement'' the right to acquire the frequency held by Channel 11.  Villanueva paid Velarde for the stocks and assets held by [[Delta Broadcasting System, Inc.|Delta Broadcasting System]] (DBS). 

In the late 1990s, [[Entertainment Network]] (Enternet) headed by Benito Araneta and ZOE-TV entered an agreement for TV airtime lease. Enternet leased the morning and afternoon block  by airing [[CNBC Asia]]. After two years of airing, the two parties had disagreements on the signed contact, ZOE-TV stopped airing CNBC Asia and Enternet bolted out and filed a case on Villanueva. 

In 2001, ZOE-TV became the first TV station to air the [[EDSA II|second EDSA Revolution]]. In 2004, Villanueva resigned as Chairman on ZOE TV to run for Philippine President. After ending in the last position in the election, Villanueva regained the chairmanship and continued his TV talk shows on ZOE.

In the first quarter of 2005, [[DWDB-TV|Citynet Television]], a subsidiary of [[GMA Network]], and ZOE-TV entered to an agreement for Citynet leasing the entire TV airtime block of the station in exchange of an upgrading the facilities of ZOE and a ZOE-TV program on [[GMA Network]] every Monday midnight after its Sunday [[primetime]] block.

[[GMA Network]] installed and upgraded the transmitter and studio of ZOE Broadcasting Network channel 33 on November 11, 2005. DZOZ is now on its rehabilitaion of its transmitter.

The channel was launched on November 27, 2006 as [[UniversiTV]]. UniversiTV on Channel 33 lasted until first quarter of 2008. UniversiTV now airs via satellite and is received through cable operators nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;http://universitv.net/utv/cablechannel_assignments.html&lt;/ref&gt;
