'''Horsey Windpump''' is a [[windpump]] or [[drainage]] [[windmill]] in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] in the village of [[Horsey, Norfolk|Horsey]], near [[Great Yarmouth]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]]. The structure is a grade II* [[listed building]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/Details/Default.aspx?id=223656 Images of England - Horsey Drainage Mill]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

The windpump was working until it was struck by lightning in 1943. It was acquired by the National Trust in 1948 from the Buxton Family and has been restored. The Buxton family continue to manage the estate, emphasising nature conservation. Because of this the estate has become an internationally important wildlife site. On the estate there are [[waymarking|waymarked]] circular walks, the main one being the path via [[Brograve Mill]], the walk provides great views across [[Horsey Mere]] and access to the beach at [[Horsey Gap]]. There are many windmills in this particular area including West Somerton Mill, Heigham Holmes Mill, [[Brograve Mill]], and [[Lambrigg Mill]]

Horsey Windpump is open daily from March to October.
