==About Duke==
Duke is the father of B&amp;B co-owner [[Terry Woods (Emmerdale)|Terry Woods]].

Terry brought his father to the village after watching him confront unruly teenagers on the [[The Jeremy Kyle Show]]. He thinks that the peace and quiet of the dales will do his father some good, but soon discovers that there is more to Duke than meets the eye.

The day after being arrested, along with [[Pearl Ladderbanks]], for [[vandalizing]] Jacob's Fold, it was revealed in the ''Hotton Courier'' that his real first name is Percy.

Duke left the village on January 28, 2008 to help [[Ryan Hayworth]] train to be a professional footballer.
