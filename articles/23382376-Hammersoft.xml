===Coaching staff===
[[Image:George O'Leary-1.jpg||thumb|Head Coach George O'Leary]]
On January 5, 2009, UCF hired [[Charlie Taaffe]] to be the teams new [[Offensive Coordinator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;taaffe&quot;&gt;http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/orl-sportsfbcucf04010409jan04,0,4978498.story Amid shakeup, UCF taps Taaffe to lead offense&lt;/ref&gt; The change occurred amid a staff shake-up by Head Coach George O'Leary after a disappointing 2008 season. Tim Salem, whom Taaffe replaced, will transition to being the tight-ends coach and special-teams coordinator, 2008 quarterbacks coach George Godsey will move to be the running-backs coach, and Brent Key will move from being the tight-ends coach and special-teams coordinator to offensive-line coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;taaffe&quot;/&gt;
