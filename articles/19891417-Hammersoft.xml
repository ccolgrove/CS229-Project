The '''EWUâUM Governors Cup''' is the annual [[college football]] game between the [[University of Montana - Missoula|University of Montana]] Grizzlies and the [[Eastern Washington University]] Eagles. 

==History==
Traditionally, the Governors Cup is a very intense and heated rivalry between these two teams, mainly because the winner of the game usually is in the running to be the champion of the [[Big Sky Conference]]. 

In the past 7 seasons the winner of the game has gone on to the playoffs. The rivalry between the two teams is so popular that the game has also sold out the past 7 years. The game is usually played in the middle of the regular season, played on the Saturday alternating between [[Roos Field]] and [[Washington-Grizzly Stadium]] each year. From 1967-2004 (except for 1974),EWU hosted the game at [[Spokane, Washington|Spokane's]] [[Joe Albi Stadium]]. 

The Montana Grizzlies currently lead in the rivalry with 25 wins and 11 losses. There has been only one tie, which occurred in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/pac10/washington_state/opponents_records.php?teamid=3421 Washington State Game by Game against Opponents.] College Football Data Warehouse.

With more than 2,000 bleachers added, record crowds of 11,702 in 2010 and 11,583 in 2006 attended the showdowns with Montana, the most recent match up in 2010 was won by the Eagles. The previous record before 2004 was 6,879 for the Eastern - Idaho game on Oct. 17, 1992, when temporary bleachers were employed in addition to the 5,000 permanent seats. The top 25 attendances at Roos Field have come since the early 1990s, including the top eight in the last three seasons.

On February 26, 2010, ESPN reported that Eastern Washington planned to remove the natural turf at Woodward Field and replace it with red SprinTurf, making it the second Division 1 college football program to have a non-green playing surface (Boise State of the WAC has a blue surface).  On May 20, 2010 the Eastern Washington Board of Trustees approved a name change to Roos Field, scheduled for the 2010 season, upon the successful completion of the project.

==Washington-Grizzly Stadium==

The stadium is named after construction magnate Dennis Washington, a Montana business pioneer who donated $1 million to finance the stadium's construction in 1985. The stadium has been expanded three times since its opening in 1986, most recently in 2008 with an upper deck expansion of 2,000 seats on the east side.

The original seating capacity in 1986 was 12,500 permanent seats on the sidelines with open grass seating behind the end zones, an approximate capacity of 15,000. Permanent seating for the end zones was installed in 1995, which brought the seating capacity to over 19,000. The most recent expansion in 2008 brought the seating capacity to over 25,000.
