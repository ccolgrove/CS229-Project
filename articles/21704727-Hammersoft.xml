The '''Republic of Cape Verde''' {{IPAc-en|audio=Cape Verde.ogg|Ë|k|eÉª|p|_|Ë|v|Ér|d}} ({{lang-pt|Cabo Verde}}, {{IPA-pt|Ëkabu ËveÉ¾dÉ¨|pron}}) is an [[island country]], spanning an [[archipelago]] of 10 islands located in the central [[Atlantic Ocean]], 570 kilometres off the coast of [[West Africa|Western Africa]]. The islands, covering a combined area of slightly over {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi}}, are of volcanic origin and while three of them ([[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] and [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]]) are fairly flat, sandy and dry, the remaining ones are generally rockier and have more vegetation. However, because of the infrequent occurrence of rainfall the overall landscape is not particularly green, despite what the country's name suggests (''verde'' is [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for &quot;green&quot;). The name of the country stems instead from the nearby [[Cap Vert]], on the [[Senegal]]ese coast,&lt;ref&gt;Lobban, [http://books.google.com/books?id=K8KA40g7vnQC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=cape+verde+named&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U3l9Agjto8g8JaAKKvWx-7gEGf9-Q p. 4].&lt;/ref&gt; which in its turn was originally named &quot;Cabo Verde&quot; when it was sighted by Portuguese explorers in 1444, a few years before the islands were discovered.

The previously [[desert island|uninhabited island]]s were discovered and [[Colony|colonized]] by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] in the 15th Century, and became an important location in the [[Atlantic slave trade]] due to their geographically advantageous position. The islands' prosperity often attracted [[pirate]]s, including [[Sir Francis Drake]], a [[corsair]] under the British crown, who twice sacked the (then) capital [[Cidade Velha|Ribeira Grande]], in the 1580s. The islands were also visited by [[Charles Darwin]]'s expedition in 1832. The decline in the slave trade in the 19th century resulted in an economic crisis for the islands. With few natural resources, and without strong sustainable investment from the Portuguese, the citizens grew increasingly discontent with the colonial masters, who nevertheless refused to provide the local authorities with more autonomy. This discontent festered and culminated in 1975, when a movement led by [[AmÃ­lcar Cabral]] achieved independence for the archipelago.

The country has an estimated population (most of [[Creole peoples#Portuguese Africa|creole]] ethnicity) of about 500,000, with its capital city [[Praia]] accounting for a quarter of its citizens. Nearly 38% of the population lives in rural areas according to the 2010 Cape Verdean census; about 20% lives below the [[poverty threshold]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hdr.undp.org/en/media/HDI_2008_EN_Tables.pdf |title=UNDP.org |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the literacy rate is around 85%. Politically, the country is a very stable democracy, with notable economic growth and improvements of living conditions despite its lack of natural resources, and has garnered [[#International recognition|international recognition]] by other countries and international organizations, which often provide [[development aid]]. Since 2007, Cape Verde has been classified as a [[developing country|developing nation]].

Tough economic times during the last decades of its colonization and the first years of Cape Verde's independence led many to migrate to Europe, the Americas and other African countries. This migration was so significant that the number of Cape Verdeans and their descendants living abroad currently exceeds the population of Cape Verde itself. Historically, the influx of [[remittance]]s from these [[#Emigration|immigrant communities]] to their families has provided a substantial contribution to help strengthen the country's economy. Currently, the Cape Verdean economy is mostly service-oriented with a growing focus on tourism and foreign investment, which benefits from the islands' warm climate throughout the year, diverse landscape, welcoming people and cultural richness, especially in [[music]].

== History ==
{{Main|History of Cape Verde}}
[[Image:Mindelo-MontCara2000.jpg|thumb|left|235px|View of [[Monte Cara]] from [[Mindelo]]]]

[[Image:Deserto Viana, Boa Vista.jpg|thumb|left|235px|The sandy Viana desert on the island of [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]]]]

Before the arrival of Europeans, the Cape Verde Islands were [[Uninhabited island|uninhabited]]. The islands of the Cape Verde archipelago were discovered by Italian and Portuguese [[navigator]]s around 1456. According to Portuguese official records &lt;ref&gt;''Carta regia'' (royal letter) of 19 September 1462&lt;/ref&gt; the first discoveries were made by [[Genoa|Genoese]] born [[Antonio Noli|Antonio de Noli]], who was afterwards appointed governor of Cape Verde by Portuguese [[Afonso V of Portugal|King Afonso V]]. Other navigators mentioned as contributing with discoveries in the Cape Verde archipelago are [[Diogo Gomes]], [[Diogo Dias]], Diogo Afonso and the Italian [[Alvise Cadamosto]].

In 1462, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] settlers arrived at [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]] and founded a settlement they called Ribeira Grande (now called [[Cidade Velha]], to avoid being confused with the town of [[Ribeira Grande, Cape Verde|Ribeira Grande]] on the [[Santo AntÃ£o, Cape Verde|Santo AntÃ£o]] island). Ribeira Grande was the first permanent European settlement in the [[tropics]].&lt;ref name=bn&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2835.htm Cape Verde background note]. [[U.S. Department of State]] (July 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 16th century, the archipelago prospered from the [[transatlantic slave trade]].&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; [[Pirate]]s occasionally attacked the Portuguese settlements. [[Sir Francis Drake]], a British corsair, sacked Ribeira Grande in 1585.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; After a French attack in 1712, the town declined in importance relative to nearby [[Praia]], which became the capital in 1770.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

With the decline in the slave trade, Cape Verde's early prosperity slowly vanished. However, the islands' position astride mid-Atlantic shipping lanes made Cape Verde an ideal location for re-supplying ships. Because of its excellent harbour, [[Mindelo]] (on the island of [[SÃ£o Vicente, Cape Verde|SÃ£o Vicente]]) became an important commercial centre during the 19th century.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In 1951, Portugal changed Cape Verde's status from a colony to an overseas province in an attempt to blunt growing [[nationalism]]. In 1956, [[Amilcar Cabral]], and a group of fellow Cape Verdeans and Guineans organised (in [[Portuguese Guinea]]) the clandestine [[African Party for the Independence of Guinea and Cape Verde]] (PAIGC), which demanded improvement in economic, social and political conditions in Cape Verde and Portuguese Guinea and formed the basis of the two nations' independence movement. Moving its headquarters to [[Conakry]], Guinea in 1960, the PAIGC began an armed rebellion against Portugal in 1961. Acts of sabotage eventually grew into a [[Guinea-Bissau War of Independence|war in Portuguese Guinea]] that pitted 10,000 [[Soviet bloc]]-supported PAIGC soldiers against 35,000 Portuguese and African troops.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

By 1972, the PAIGC controlled much of Portuguese Guinea despite the presence of the Portuguese troops, but the organization did not attempt to disrupt Portuguese control in Cape Verde. Portuguese Guinea declared independence in 1973 and was granted [[De facto#De jure|de jure]] independence in 1974. Following the [[Carnation Revolution|April 1974 revolution in Portugal]], the PAIGC became an active political movement in Cape Verde. In December 1974, the PAIGC and Portugal signed an agreement providing for a transitional government composed of Portuguese and Cape Verdeans. On June 30, 1975, Cape Verdeans elected a National Assembly which received the instruments of independence from Portugal on July 5, 1975.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Immediately following the [[History of Guinea-Bissau#Independence from Portugal|November 1980 coup in Guinea-Bissau]], relations between Cape Verde and Guinea-Bissau became strained. Cape Verde abandoned its hope for unity with Guinea-Bissau and formed the [[African Party for the Independence of Cape Verde]] (PAICV). Problems have since been resolved and relations between the countries are good. The PAICV and its predecessor established a one-party system and ruled Cape Verde from independence until 1990.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Responding to growing pressure for pluralistic democracy, the PAICV called an emergency congress in February 1990 to discuss proposed constitutional changes to end one-party rule. Opposition groups came together to form the [[Movement for Democracy (Cape Verde)|Movement for Democracy]] (MPD) in Praia in April 1990. Together, they campaigned for the right to contest the presidential election scheduled for December 1990.

The one-party state was abolished September 28, 1990, and the first multi-party elections were held in January 1991. The MPD won a majority of the seats in the National Assembly, and MPD presidential candidate [[AntÃ³nio Mascarenhas Monteiro]] defeated the PAICV's candidate with 73.5% of the votes. Legislative elections in December 1995 increased the MPD majority in the National Assembly. The party won 50 of the National Assembly's 72 seats.

A February 1996 presidential election returned President Monteiro to office. Legislative elections in January 2001 returned power to the PAICV, with the PAICV holding 40 of the National Assembly seats, MPD 30, and [[Party for Democratic Convergence]] (PCD) and [[Party for Labor and Solidarity]] (PTS) 1 each. In February 2001, the PAICV-supported presidential candidate [[Pedro Pires]] defeated former MPD leader [[Carlos Veiga]] by only 13 votes.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

The Cape Verde archipelago is located in the [[Atlantic Ocean]], approximately {{convert|570|km|mi}} off the coast of West Africa, near [[Mauritania]] and [[Senegal]], and is part of the [[Macaronesia]] [[ecoregion]]. It lies between latitudes [[14th parallel north|14Â°]] and [[18th parallel north|18Â°N]], and longitudes [[22nd meridian west|22Â°]] and [[26th meridian west|26Â°W]].

The country is a horseshoe-shaped cluster of ten islands (nine inhabited) and eight islets,&lt;ref name=pc&gt;[http://www.peacecorps.gov/welcomebooks/cvwb655.pdf ''The Peace Corps Welcomes You to Cape Verde'']. [[Peace Corps]] (April 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]]&lt;/ref&gt; that constitute an area of 4033&amp;nbsp;kmÂ².&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; 

The islands are spatially divided into two groups: 
* The [[Barlavento Islands|Ilhas de Barlavento]] (''{{en|[[windward]] islands}}''): [[Santo AntÃ£o, Cape Verde|Santo AntÃ£o]], [[SÃ£o Vicente, Cape Verde|SÃ£o Vicente]], [[Santa Luzia, Cape Verde|Santa Luzia]], [[SÃ£o Nicolau, Cape Verde|SÃ£o Nicolau]], [[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]];&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; and
* The [[Sotavento Islands|Ilhas de Sotavento]] (''{{en|[[leeward]] islands}}''): [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]], [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], [[Fogo, Cape Verde|Fogo]], [[Brava, Cape Verde|Brava]].&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;
The largest island, both in size and population, is [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], which hosts the nation's capital, [[Praia]], the principal agglomeration in the archipelago.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

===Physical geography===
Magnetic anomalies identified in the vicinity of the archipelago indicate that the structures forming the islands date back 125-150 million years: the islands themselves date from 8 million (in the west) to 20 million years (in the east).&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim et al., 2008, p.422&quot;&gt;Pim et al., 2008, p.422&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest exposed rocks occurred on Maio and northern peninsula of Santiago and are 128-131 million year old pillow lavas. The first stage of volcanism in the islands began in the early [[Miocene]], and reached its peak at the end of this period, when the islands reached their maximum sizes. Historical volcanism (within human settlement) has been restricted to the island of Fogo.

The origin of the islands' volcanism has been attributed to a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]], associated with bathymetric swell that formed the Cape Verde Rise.&lt;ref&gt;R. Ramalho et.al., 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Rise is one of the largest protuberances in the world's oceans, rising 2.2 kilometers in a semi-circular region of 1200&amp;nbsp;kmÂ², associated with a rise of the [[geoid]] and elevated surface heat flow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pim et al., 2008, p.422&quot;/&gt;

Though Cape Verde's islands are all [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, they vary widely in terrain.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

Most recently erupting in 1995, [[Pico do Fogo]] is the largest active [[volcano]] in the region. It has a {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} diameter [[caldera]], whose rim is {{convert|1600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} altitude and an interior cone that rises to {{convert|2829|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level.  The caldera resulted from subsidence, following the partial evacuation (eruption) of the [[magma]] chamber, along a cylindrical column from within magma chamber (at a depth of {{convert|8|km|mi|0|abbr=on}}).

Geologically, the islands are principally composed of [[igneous rock]]s, with volcanic structures and [[pyroclastic]] debris comprising the majority of the archipelago's total volume. The [[volcanic]] and [[pluton|plutonic rocks]] are distinctly basic; the archipelago is a soda-alkaline [[petrographic]] province, with a [[Petrology|petrologic]] succession which is similar to that found in other [[Macaronesia]]n islands.

Extensive [[salt flats]] are found on Sal and Maio.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; On Santiago, Santo AntÃ£o, and SÃ£o Nicolau, arid slopes give way in places to sugarcane fields or banana plantations spread along the base of towering mountains.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

===Climate===
{{main|Climate of Cape Verde}}
Cape Verde's climate is milder than that of the African mainland because the surrounding sea moderates temperatures on the islands.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Average daily high temperatures range from {{convert|25|C}} in January to {{convert|29|C|1}} in September.&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt; Cape Verde is part of the [[Sahel|Sahelian arid belt]], with nothing like the rainfall levels of nearby West Africa.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; It does rain irregularly between August and October, with frequent brief-but-heavy downpours.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;  A ''[[desert]]'' is usually defined as terrain which receives less than {{convert|250|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual rainfall. Cape Verde's total ({{convert|261|mm|in|1|abbr=on|disp=/}}) is slightly above this criterion, which makes the area climate ''[[semi-desert]]''.

The islands, covering a combined area of slightly over {{convert|4000|km2|sqmi}}, are of volcanic origin and while three of them ([[Sal, Cape Verde|Sal]], [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] and [[Maio, Cape Verde|Maio]]) are fairly flat, sandy and dry, the remaining ones are generally rockier and have more vegetation. However, because of the infrequent occurrence of rainfall the overall landscape is not particularly green. However, the archipelago can be divided into four broad ecological zones: arid, semiarid, subhumid and humid, according to altitude and average annual rainfall ranging from 200 mm in the arid areas of the coast to more than 1000 mm in the humid mountain. Mostly rainfall precipitation is due to condensation of the ocean mist.

In some islands, as [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]], the wetter climate of the interior and the eastern coast contrasts with the dryer one in the south/southwest coast. [[Praia]], located in the southeast coast, is the largest city of the island, and also the largest city and capital of the country.

The Cape Verde islands are a very degradated area. Due to its proximity to the Sahara, most of the Cape Verde islands are dry, but on islands with high mountains and farther away from the coast, by orography, the humidity is much higher, giving a rainforest habitat, very degraded by the strong human presence.
Northeastern slopes of high mountains often receive a lot of rain and Southwest slopes not. This umbria areas are identified with cool and moisture.
Some islands, with steep mountains, are covered with vegetation where the dense ocean [[moisture]] condense and soak the plants, rocks, soil, logs, moss etc. 

[[Cloud Forest|cloud forests]] developed about [[mountain]]s, where the dense [[moisture]] from the sea or ocean, is precipitated by the action of the relief. Opposing the terrain to a front of warm, moist air mass, it forces to increase the height above sea level of that body wet and warm air mass, which cools and decreases the [[dew point]], causing it to condense part of the moisture that falls as rain or fog, creating an habitat especially cool, saturated with moisture in the air and soil.

Hurricanes that form near the Cape Verde Islands are sometimes referred to as [[Cape Verde-type hurricane]]s.  These hurricanes can become very intense as they cross warm Atlantic waters.

===Biome===
Cape Verde's isolation has resulted in the islands having a number of [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] [[species]], particularly bird and reptiles, many of which are [[endangered species|endangered]] by human development. Endemic birds include [[Alexander's Swift]] (''Apus alexandri''), [[Bourne's Heron]] (''Ardea purpurea bournei''), the [[Raso Lark]] (''Alauda razae''), the [[Cape Verde Warbler]] (''Acrocephalus brevipennis''), and the [[Iago Sparrow]] (''Passer iagoensis'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birdlife.org/datazone/ebas/index.html?action=EbaHTMDetails.asp&amp;sid=79&amp;m=0 |title=Endemic Bird Areas: Cape Verde Islands |publisher=Birdlife.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands are also an important breeding area for seabirds including the [[Cape Verde Shearwater]]. [[Reptile]]s include the [[Tarentola gigas|Cape Verde Giant Gecko]] (''Tarentola gigas'').

====Demographics====
{{Main|Demographics of Cape Verde}}
[[File:Pyramide Cap-Vert.PNG|thumb|235px|Population pyramid (demographics) showing age distribution of males to females (2005)]]

Most of the population is of [[Creole peoples#Portuguese Africa|creole]] ethnicity, mixed from [[black people|black African]] and [[white people|European]] descent. The European men who colonized Cape Verde did not usually bring wives or families with them. As female [[African slave trade|African slaves]] were brought to the islands inter-marriages occurred.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

A genetic study revealed that the ancestry of the population in Cape Verde is 57% African and 43% European.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asemana.sapo.cv/spip.php?article53126&amp;ak=1 |title=Actualidade |publisher=Asemana.sapo.cv |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around 95% of the population is Christian (more than 85 percent of the population is nominally [[Roman Catholic]],&lt;ref name=rf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90087.htm |title=State.gov |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; though for a minority of the population Catholicism is [[syncretism|syncretized]] with African influences).&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;/&gt; The largest [[Protestant]] denomination is the [[Church of the Nazarene]]; other groups include the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], the [[Assemblies of God]], the [[Universal Church of the Kingdom of God]], and various other [[Pentecostal]] and [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] groups.)&lt;ref name=rf/&gt; There are small [[Baha'i]] communities and a small [[Islam|Muslim]] community.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt; The number of [[atheists]] is estimated at less than 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref name=rf/&gt;

Cape Verde's official language is Portuguese. It is the language of instruction and government. However, the [[Cape Verdean Creole]] is used colloquially and is the mother tongue of virtually all Cape Verdeans. Cape Verdean Creole or Kriolu is a dialect continuum of a Portuguese-based [[creole language|creole]], which varies from island to island.  There is a substantial body of literature in Creole, especially in the [[Santiago Creole]] and the [[SÃ£o Vicente Creole]]. Creole has been gaining prestige since the nation's independence from Portugal. However, the differences between the varied forms of the language within the islands have been a major obstacle in the way of standardization of the language. Some people have advocated the development of two standards: a North (Barlavento) standard, centered on the SÃ£o Vicente Creole, and a South (Sotavento) standard, centered on the Santiago Creole. Manuel Veiga, PhD, a linguist by training, and Minister of Culture of Cape Verde, is the premier proponent of Kriolu's officialization and standardization. The demographic statistics site ESA says Cape Verde has a population of 567,000 in 2010.

====Emigration====
{{Main|Cape Verdean diaspora}}
[[File:Gossiping.jpg|thumb|235px|left|Local women on the island of [[Santiago, Cape Verde|Santiago]]]]
Today, more Cape Verdeans live abroad than in Cape Verde itself, with significant [[emigration|emigrant]]&lt;ref&gt;Jorgen Carling, 2004, p.113-132&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Verdean communities in the United States (500,000 Cape Verdeans descent, with a major concentration on the [[New England]] coast from [[Providence, Rhode Island]], to [[New Bedford, Massachusetts]]). There are also significant Cape Verde populations in  [[Portugal]] (150,000), [[Angola]] (45,000), [[SÃ£o TomÃ© and PrÃ­ncipe]] (25,000), [[Senegal]] (25,000), the Netherlands (20,000, of which 15,000 are concentrated in [[Rotterdam]]), France (25,000), Scandinavia (7,000), Italy (10,000) and Spain (12,500). There is also a Cape Verdean community in [[Argentina]] numbering 8,000. A large number of Cape Verdeans and people of Cape Verdean descent that immigrated before 1975 are not included in these statistics, because all the Cape Verdeans had Portuguese passports before 1975. 

There are approximately 2,000 Chinese immigrants in Cape Verde, as well as citizens of the African mainland (most of these immigrants hail from West Africa), there are also a significant number of citizens of Europe and South America ([[Brazil]]) residing in the country. There are an estimated 20,000 immigrants in Cape Verde of which 14,000 are legal residents.

In the USA, the children and grandchildren of the first immigrant waves became involved in the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955â1968)|Civil Rights movement]] of the 1960s. This led them to make links with other US black groups. Cape-Verdean Americans have also been involved in the US Army for centuries; in the Revolutionary War, Civil War, the First and Second World Wars, as well as the Korean and Vietnam Wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sites.google.com/site/capeverdeanveterans/Home/Cape-Verdean-Veterans |title=Cape Verdeans: Cape Verdean Veterans |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Verdeans moved to places all over the world, from [[Macau]] to [[Haiti]] to Argentina to northern Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/multi/Bu-Dr/Cape-Verdean-Americans.html |title=Everydculture.com |publisher=Everyculture.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Politics of Cape Verde}}

Cape Verde is a stable [[representative democracy|representative]] [[Parliamentary republic]].&lt;ref name=constitution&gt;{{cite web|url=http://confinder.richmond.edu/admin/docs/CapeVerde.pdf|title=Constitution of Cape Verde|year=1992|accessdate=2011-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitution of Cape Verde|constitution]] âadopted in 1980 and revised in 1992, 1995 and 1999â defines the basic principles of its government. The [[president of Cape Verde|president]] is the [[head of state]] and is elected by [[popular vote]] for a 5-year term. The [[prime minister of Cape Verde|prime minister]] is the [[head of government]] and proposes other ministers and secretaries of state. The prime minister is nominated by the [[National Assembly of Cape Verde|National Assembly]] and appointed by the president. Members of the National Assembly are elected by popular vote for 5-year terms. Three parties now hold seats in the National AssemblyâPAICV 40, MPD 30, and Cape Verdean Independent Democratic Union (UCID) 2.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

The judicial system consists of a Supreme Court of Justice â whose members are appointed by the president, the National Assembly, and the Board of the Judiciary â and regional courts. Separate courts hear civil, constitutional, and criminal cases. Appeal is to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Cape Verde follows a policy of [[Non-Aligned Movement|nonalignment]] and seeks cooperative relations with all friendly states.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; [[Angola]], Brazil, the People's Republic of China, [[Cuba]], France, Germany, Portugal, Spain, [[Senegal]], Russia and the United States maintain embassies in [[Praia]].&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; Cape Verde is actively interested in foreign affairs, especially in Africa.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; It has [[Bilateralism|bilateral relations]] with some [[Lusophone]] nations and holds membership in a number of international organisations.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; It also participates in most international conferences on economic and political issues.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; Since 2007, Cape Verde has a ''special partnership'' status&lt;ref&gt;Percival, Debra, [http://www.acp-eucourier.info/Newsview.79.0.html?&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=507&amp;tx_ttnews%5BbackPid%5D=6&amp;cHash=6032424471  &quot;Cape Verde-EU âSpecial Partnershipâ takes shape&quot;], [http://www.acp-eucourier.info/ &quot;The Courier&quot;]'', [[Commission of the European Communities]] publication, May 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[EU]], under the [[Cotonou Agreement]], and might apply for [[Future enlargement of the European Union#Cape Verde|special membership]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/Portugal/050507114923.9ivv9852/ |title=Cape Verde could seek EU membership this year |publisher=Eubusiness.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[military of Cape Verde]] consists of a [[coast guard]] and an [[army]]; 0.7% of the country's GDP was spent on the military in 2005.

=== International recognition ===
Cape Verde is often praised as an example among African nations, for its stability and developmental growth despite its lack of natural resources. Among others, it has been recognized with the following assessments:

Moreover, on 10 October 2011 Cape Verde became the 119th state which ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court ([http://www.icc-cpi.int/NR/exeres/D7A59C22-56B6-4E8F-A451-BB737DEEC225.htm Cape Verde becomes the 119th State to Join the Rome Statute System]).

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of Cape Verde}}
[[Image:Mercado Municipal (S Vicente, Cabo Verde).JPG|thumb|235px|right|Municipal market in S. Vicente]]
Cape Verde has few [[natural resource]]s, scant rainfall and limited supplies of [[fresh water]].{{cn|date=November 2011}} Only four of the ten main islands (Santiago, Santo AntÃ£o, Fogo, and Brava) normally support significant agricultural production,&lt;ref&gt;See Carlos Ferreira Couto, ''Incerteza, adaptabilidade e inovaÃ§Ã£o na sociedade rural da Ilha de Santiago de Cabo Verde'', Lisbon: FundaÃ§Ã£o Galouste Gulbenkian, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and over 90% of all food consumed in Cape Verde is imported. Mineral resources include salt, [[pozzolana]] (a volcanic rock used in cement production), and [[limestone]].&lt;ref name=bn/&gt; Its small number of wineries making Portuguese-style wines have traditionally focused on the domestic market, but have recently met with some international acclaim. A number of wine tours of Cape Verde's various microclimates began to be offered in spring 2010 and can be arranged through the tourism office.&lt;ref&gt;[[Tourism in Cape Verde]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[economy]] of Cape Verde is service-oriented, with commerce, transport, and public services accounting for more than 70% of [[GDP]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Although nearly 38% of the population lives in [[rural]] areas, agriculture and fishing contribute only about 9% of GDP. [[Light manufacturing]] accounts for most of the remainder. [[Fish]] and [[shellfish]] are plentiful, and small quantities are [[export]]ed. Cape Verde has cold storage and freezing facilities and [[fish processing]] plants in Mindelo, Praia, and on Sal. Expatriate Cape Verdeans contribute an amount estimated at about 20% of GDP to the domestic economy through remittances.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

Since 1991, the government has pursued market-oriented economic policies, including an open welcome to [[foreign investors]] and a far-reaching [[privatization]] programme. It established as top development priorities the promotion of a [[market economy]] and of the private sector; the development of [[Tourism in Cape Verde|tourism]], light manufacturing industries, and fisheries; and the development of [[Transport in Cape Verde|transport]], [[Communications in Cape Verde|communications]], and [[energy]] facilities. From 1994 to 2000 about $407 million in foreign investments were made or planned, of which 58% were in [[tourism]],&lt;ref&gt;See now BrÃ­gida Rocha Brito and others, ''Turismo em Meio Insular Africano: Potencialidades, constrangimentos e impactos'', Lisbon: Gerpress, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; 17% in industry, 4% in infrastructure, and 21% in [[fishery|fisheries]] and services.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

In 2011, on 4 islands a windfarm was built, that in total supplies about 25% of the electricity of the country. With this amount it is one of the top countries for renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infracoafrica.com/news.asp?id=11&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2000 and 2009, real GDP increased on average by over 7 percent a year, well above the average for Sub-Saharan countries and faster than most small island economies in the region. Strong economic performance was bolstered by one of the fastest growing tourism industries in the world, as well as by substantial capital inflows that allowed Cape Verde to build up national currency reserves to the current 3.5 months of imports. Unemployment has been falling rapidly, and the country is on track to achieve most of the UN Millenium Development Goals â including halving its 1990 poverty level. 

In 2007, Cape Verde joined the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) and in 2008 the country graduated from [[Least developed country|Least Developed Country]] (LDC) to Middle Income Country (MIC) status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfw4a.org/cape-verde/cape-verde-financial-sector-profile.html |title=MFW4A |publisher=MFW4A |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://data.worldbank.org/country/cape-verde &quot;Data on Cape Verde&quot;], ''[[The World Bank]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Cape Verde has significant cooperation with Portugal at every level of the economy, which has led it to link its currency first to the [[Portuguese escudo]] and, in 1999, to the [[euro]]. On June 23, 2008 Cape Verde became the 153rd member of the WTO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Development===
The European Commission's total allocation for the period of 2008â2013 foreseen for Cape Verde to address &quot;poverty reduction, in particular in rural and periurban areas where women are heading the households, as well as good governance&quot; amounts to â¬54.1 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/europeaid/where/acp/country-cooperation/cape-verde/cape-verde_en.htm European Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Mindelo portogrande.jpg|thumb|235px|right|The collection of sailing ships in Porto Grande, Mindelo on the island of [[SÃ£o Vicente, Cape Verde|SÃ£o Vicente]]: tourism is a growing source of income on the islands]]
Cape Verde's strategic location at the crossroads of mid-Atlantic air and sea lanes has been enhanced by significant improvements at [[Mindelo]]'s harbor ([[Porto Grande, Cape Verde|Porto Grande]]) and at [[AmÃ­lcar Cabral International Airport|Sal's]] and [[Francisco Mendes International Airport|Praia's international airports]]. A [[Rabil Airport|new international airport]] was opened in [[Boa Vista, Cape Verde|Boa Vista]] in December 2007, and on the island of Sao Vicente, the newest international airport ([[Sao Pedro Airport]]) in Cape Verde, was opened in late 2009. Ship repair facilities at Mindelo were opened in 1983. The major ports are Mindelo and Praia, but all other islands have smaller port facilities. In addition to the international airport on Sal, [[List of airports in Cape Verde|airports]] have been built on all of the inhabited islands. All but the airport on Brava enjoy scheduled air service. The archipelago has {{convert|3050|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} of roads, of which {{convert|1010|km|mi|0|abbr=on}} are paved, most using [[cobblestone]].&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

The country's future economic prospects depend heavily on the maintenance of aid flows, the encouragement of tourism, remittances, outsourcing labor to neighboring African countries, and the momentum of the government's development program.&lt;ref name=bn/&gt;

[[Tourism]] has increased in recent years. Large hotels have been built across the country in an effort to boost tourism. In particular, on the islands of Boa Vista (Club Hotel Riu Karamboa (750 rooms)), and Sal (Club Hotel Riu Funana/Garopa (1000 rooms)--the largest hotel in all of West Africa). The Cape Verde islands have a relatively low crime rate and beautiful beaches, as well as having engaging local people. Tourists and leisure seekers from across Europe and the world are coming to the country in larger numbers.

In 2010, about 382,000 tourists visited the archipelago.

{{Main|Culture of Cape Verde|Music of Cape Verde}}
[[File:Morna group.jpg|thumb|right|235px|A group playing [[morna (music)|morna]]]]

Cape Verdean social and cultural patterns are similar to those of rural Portugal and Africa.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; Football (Futebol) games and church activities are typical sources of social interaction and entertainment.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; The traditional walk around the praÃ§a ([[town square]]) to meet friends is practiced regularly in Cape Verde towns.&lt;ref name=pc/&gt; In towns with electricity, television is available on two channels (Cape Verdean and Portuguese).&lt;ref name=pc/&gt;

Cape Verde music incorporates Portuguese, Caribbean, African, and Brazilian influences.&lt;ref name=manuel&gt;Manuel, [http://books.google.com/books?id=Ou7UQpV1KtwC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;sig=ACfU3U2uqqgsQptuj2MkXqURiv2C2vuZdQ#PPA95,M1 p. 95-97].&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Verde's quintessential national music is the ''[[morna (music)|morna]]'', a melancholy and lyrical song form typically sung in [[Cape Verdean Creole]]. The most popular music genre after ''[[morna (music)|morna]]'' is the ''[[coladeira]]'' followed by ''[[funanÃ¡]]'' and ''[[batuque (music)|batuque]]'' music. Amongst the most worldwide known Cape Verdean singers, are the singers [[Ildo Lobo]] and [[Cesaria Evora]] whose songs became a hallmark of the country and its culture.
There are also well known artists born to Cape Verdean parents who excelled themselves. Amongst these artists are jazz pianist [[Horace Silver]], [[Duke Ellington]]'s saxophonist [[Paul Gonsalves]] and singer [[Lura (musician)|Lura]].

Dance forms include the soft dance ''morna'', the extreme sensuality of ''[[coladeira]]'' including the modernized version called ''passada'' ([[zouk]]), the ''[[FunanÃ¡]]'' (a sensual mixed Portuguese and African dance), and the ''[[Batuque (music)|Batuque]]'' dance.

Cape Verdean literature is one of the richest of [[Lusophone]] Africa. Famous poets include Paulino Vieira, Manuel de Novas, Sergio Frusoni, EugÃ©nio Tavares, and B. LÃ©za, and famous authors include [[Baltasar Lopes da Silva]], AntÃ³nio AurÃ©lio GonÃ§alves, [[Manuel Lopes]], [[Orlanda AmarÃ­lis]], [[Henrique Teixeira de Sousa]], and [[Germano Almeida]].

&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afro.who.int/wsh/countryprofiles/capeverde.pdf ]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cape Verde has been steadily developing&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/country_fact_sheets/hdi-trends/cpv_2.gif Cape Verde HDI Trend] from the [[2007 Human Development Report]] [http://hdrstats.undp.org/countries/country_fact_sheets/cty_fs_CPV.html country fact sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; since its independence, and besides having been promoted to the group of &quot;medium development&quot; countries in 2007, leaving the [[Least Developed Countries]] category (which is only the second time it has happened to a country&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=22918&amp;Cr=cape&amp;Cr1=verde &quot;UN advocate salutes Cape Verdeâs graduation from category of poorest States&quot;], UN News Centre, 14 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;), is currently the [[List of countries by Human Development Index#Africa|10th best ranked]] country in Africa in terms of [[Human Development Index]].

=== Education ===
{{main|Education  in Cape Verde}}
[[File:Finalistas do jardim infantil.jpg|thumb|left|Kindergarten graduation in Santiago island, Cape Verde]]
Primary school education in Cape Verde is mandatory between the ages of 6 and 14 years and free for children ages 6 to 12.&lt;ref name=ilab&gt;[http://www.dol.gov/ilab/media/reports/iclp/tda2001/cape-verde.htm &quot;Cape Verde&quot;]. ''Findings on the Worst Forms of Child Labor (2001)''. [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], [[U.S. Department of Labor]] (2002). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, the net enrollment ratio for primary school was 84%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators |title=World Development Indicators &amp;#124; Data |publisher=Data.worldbank.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; While enrollment rates indicate a level of commitment to education, they do not always reflect children's participation in school.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Textbooks have been made available to 90 percent of school children, and 83 percent of the teachers have attended in-service teacher training.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; Although most children have access to education, some problems remain.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt; For example, many students and some teachers speak Creole at home and have a poor command of Portuguese (the language of instruction); there is insufficient spending on school materials, lunches, and books; and there is a high repetition rate for certain grades.&lt;ref name=ilab/&gt;

== Football ==
Although the [[Cape Verde national football team]] represents Cape Verde abroad, many internationally known football players were born in Cape Verde, or were descendants of Cape Verdeans, and play for other nation's teams. Several currently play, or have played, in the Portuguese league or national team, such as [[Luis Nani|Nani]], [[Jorge Andrade]], [[Rolando (Portuguese footballer)|Rolando]] or [[NÃ©lson Marcos]]. [[Henrik Larsson]] (whose father is Cape Verdean) played for Sweden, [[Patrick Vieira]] (whose mother is Cape Verdean) played for France, while [[Gelson Fernandes]] (who was born in [[Praia, Cape Verde|Praia]]) plays for Switzerland.

== Windsports ==
Cape Verde is famous for wavesailing (a type of windsurfing) and kiteboarding.  Josh Angulo, a Hawaiian and 2009 PWA Wave World Champion, has done much to promote the archipelago as a windsurfing destination. Cape Verde is now his adopted country.

Mitu Monteiro, a local kitesurfer, was the 2008 Kite Surfing World Champion in the wave discipline.  The lives of Mitu and his 2 lifelong friends Titik and Djo and their very unique exposure to windsurfing and kitesurfing is chronicled in a short film by Thierry Albert and Marcus Werner Hed called &quot;[http://vimeo.com/15842251 The Boys from Ponta Preta]&quot;
