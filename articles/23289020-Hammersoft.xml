'''Vodafone Hutchison Australia''' '''(VHA)''' is a mobile telecommunications company that operates the [[Vodafone Australia|Vodafone]], [[Hutchison 3G|'3']] and [[Crazy John's]] brands in Australia. The result of a merger between [[Vodafone Australia]] and [[Hutchison 3G|Hutchison 3G Australia]], it created a mobile communications entity of nearly 7 million subscribers, [[A$]]4 billion in annual revenue and a 27 per cent market share making it Australia's third largest mobile telcommunications provider behind [[Telstra]] and [[Optus]].&lt;ref name=F&amp;F/&gt; 

The [[joint venture]] entity is owned by Hutchison Telecommunications Australia ({{ASX|HTA}})(a subsidiary of [[Hutchison Whampoa]]) and by the [[Vodafone Group PLC]] on a 50-50 basis.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison Telecommunications Australia release to Australian Securities Exchange, 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed on 10 June 2009, after shareholder and [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]] approval. At the time of the merger, VHA chief executive Nigel Dews said &quot;the first priority is around people and getting the organisation and the organisational structure sorted out&quot;, and that head office functions would see the greatest redundancies.

VHA is now phasing out the Three brand mid 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;vha1&quot;/&gt; No registration of new subscribers to Three as they will now be Vodafone customers. &lt;ref name=&quot;vha1&quot;&gt;http://www.gizmodo.com.au/2011/08/vodafone-ends-new-3-mobile-customer-registrations/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.three.com.au/cs/ContentServer?c=Page&amp;pagename=3CA%2FPage%2F3CAStatic&amp;cid=1236150762237&amp;pid=3:hme::makethemove:her:welcome-hpb-her-cta&lt;/ref&gt;

== Networks ==
;Vodafone's GSM: Vodafone's 2G [[GSM]] service on 900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz covers 94.52% of the population. In major cities the 2G GSM network offers [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]] data connections, elsewhere the faster [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] is available.
;Vodafone's 3G 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz: Vodafone's [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] network is available in metro areas of major cities and some larger regional centres covering 80% of the population. In major cities, Optus and Vodafone share towers and a single set of 3G antennas and feeders, as well as equipment shelters for their respective base stations - and for some locations share a 3G base station as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.optus.com.au/portal/site/aboutoptus/menuitem.813c6f701cee5a14f0419f108c8ac7a0/?vgnextoid=65308336054f4010VgnVCM1000009fa87c0aRCRD&amp;vgnextchannel=aafbfaf924954010VgnVCM10000029a67c0aRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default | title=Optus and Vodafone finalise agreement to rollout shared 3G net | date=19 November 2004 | accessdate=2011-05-18 | publisher=[[Optus]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of major cities, Vodafone and Optus work independently. 3G users outside of major cities use either Vodafone 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz 3G towers, Vodafones new 3G 900&amp;nbsp;MHz 3G coverage, or fall back to GSM services.
;Vodafone's 3G 900&amp;nbsp;MHz: Expansion of Vodafone's 3G UMTS network was completed in October 2009, and uses 900&amp;nbsp;MHz for 3G services outside of capital cities, to equal or surpass their older GSM coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.vodafone.com.au/personal/services/coverage/maps/index.htm | title=Network Coverage | publisher=Vodafone Hutchison Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Vodafone's 3G 850&amp;nbsp;MHz: Vodafone are currently rolling out new 850&amp;nbsp;MHz 3G towers and adding 850&amp;nbsp;MHz equipment to existing towers, to boost signal in-building, relieve capacity in metropolitan areas and provide a better experience for 850&amp;nbsp;MHz compatible smartphones. The 850&amp;nbsp;MHz spectrum belonged to Hutchison prior to the merger and was used by their brand [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]].
;Three's 3G 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz: Three operates a 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz 3G network in a 50/50 partnership with [[Telstra]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zdnet.com.au/news/business/soa/Telstra-Hutchison-share-3G-network/0,139023166,139155373,00.htm | title=Telstra, Hutchison share 3G network | date=4 August 2004 | publisher=[[ZDNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the radio networks are shared, the core networks are separate), covering approximately 56% of [[Australia]]'s population. The 3G network covers [[Sydney]], [[Melbourne]], [[Brisbane]], [[Adelaide]], [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Canberra]], [[Geelong, Victoria|Geelong]], [[Frankston, Victoria|Frankston]] and [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]]. In areas not covered by the joint 3G network, customers are able to roam on [[Telstra]]'s [[Next G]] 850&amp;nbsp;MHz 3G network (if the phone supports it), and Telstra's 900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz 2G networks. This agreement allows Three to offer coverage to up to 96% of the population.

The Vodafone 2G and 3G (2100/900&amp;nbsp;MHz) networks originally operated as a single network, separate to the Three network. During the merger, VHA had made no comment on their intention to combine the 3 and Vodafone networks, or offer roaming between them.  However, as of late 2009, roaming onto the Vodafone's 2G network was enabled for Three customers in areas that had limited 3G coverage (e.g. blackspots), handsets now show '3 2G' instead of 'Roaming'. There are no additional charges in '3's 2G zone', although data speeds are limited.

In late 2010 VHA announced plans to consolidate the Three and Vodafone networks, in an attempt to better compete with Telstra's Next&amp;nbsp;G network, which currently holds the most number of subscribers in Australia (9.3 million). The plan includes the expansion of UMTS 900/2100&amp;nbsp;MHz coverage in 900 metropolitan sites and 500 outer metropolitan sites across Australia, an end to the 3GIS network (3's UMTS 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz network, which it has a 50% stake with, the other 50% being held by Telstra), as well as the roll out of 1400 UMTS-850 base stations - 850&amp;nbsp;MHz being the same band in which the Next&amp;nbsp;G network operates. VHA has spent $550 million on the project so far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/australian-it/telecommunications/vha-in-major-3g-upgrade/story-fn4iyzsr-1225942260537 | title=VHA in major 3G upgrade | date=22 October 2010 | accessdate=2011-05-18 | first=Andrew | last=Colley | publisher=[[The Australian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ownership structure ==
Before the merger:
* Vodafone Group PLC owned Vodafone Australia Limited (which runs the Vodafone network)
* Hutchison Whampoa Limited owns 52% of Hutchison Telecommunications (Australia) Limited (&quot;HTAL&quot;), which owned Hutchison 3G Australia Pty Limited (&quot;H3GA&quot;) (which runs the &quot;3&quot; network)

In the merger, Hutchison 3G Australia was renamed VHA Pty Limited, and half was sold to Vodafone Group. 

The ownership structure of the merged entity became:
* Vodafone Group owns 50% of VHA Pty Limited
* Hutchison Telecommunications Australia owns 50%of VHA Pty Limited
* VHA Pty Limited owns 100% of Vodafone Australia Limited&lt;ref name=merger&gt;[http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2009/hutchison_and_vodafone.html Merger Announcement Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Retail Stores ==

During the merger, Vodafone Hutchison Australia announced it would buy out its Vodafone branded stores, previously run by the retail management groups Digicall, First Mobile, Inside Mobile and GSM. The new retail structure will lift VHA's current headcount by 1400 to 5100 staff,&lt;ref name=F&amp;F/&gt; and 
adds over 170 stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodafone.com.au/personal/aboutvodafone/companyinfo/factsfigures/index.htm Vodafone Australia: Facts &amp; Figures]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;3&quot;-branded stores are already owned by VHA.
