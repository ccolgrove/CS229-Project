'''Windows Genuine Advantage''' ('''WGA''') is an anti-[[Copyright infringement|piracy]] system created by [[Microsoft]] that enforces online validation of the licensing of several recent [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s when accessing several services, such as [[Windows Update]], and downloading Windows components from the Microsoft Download Center. In Windows 7, WGA is renamed '''Windows Activation Technology'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2009/05/for-windows-7-microsoft-renames-wga-to-wat.ars WGA dubbed Windows Activation Technology with Windows 7]&lt;/ref&gt;. WGA consists of two components: an installable component called ''WGA Notifications'' that hooks into [[Winlogon]] and validates the Windows license upon each logon and an [[ActiveX control]] that checks the validity of the Windows license when downloading certain updates from the Microsoft Download Center or [[Windows Update]]. WGA Notifications covers [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]] and current versions of [[Windows 7]]. It does not cover other versions of the [[Windows NT]] family, such as [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows Server 2003]] and Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, or the [[Windows 9x]] family. The ActiveX control however checks [[Windows 2000|Windows 2000 Professional]] licenses as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905226|title=The Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) validation check process does not complete when you try to validate your copy of Windows Vista, Windows XP, or Windows 2000 Professional|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

WGA also advertises the latest service pack for Windows XP, which requires manual intervention to disable. Previously voluntary, it became mandatory for use of these services in July 2005.

Despite its name it does not actually evaluate the integrity or security of any computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;wine&quot;&gt;[http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=07/06/18/0037223 Slashdot | Ubuntu Linux Validates As Genuine Windows], retrieved June 18, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[Image:WGA Notice.png|thumb|right|320px|Windows Genuine Advantage Notification in Windows XP]]
The WGA validation process validates the present installation of Windows and its license key against the detected [[hardware]] and determines if the software was licensed from Microsoft. It is accessible by either a stand-alone program, a Netscape-compatible web browser [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]], or as an [[ActiveX]] control within [[Internet Explorer]], the latter of which is relevant to any attempt to access Microsoft updates via its [[Web browser|browser]]. It includes the following steps:
* Upon their first visit to Windows Update or certain updates on the Microsoft Download Center, users receive a message requiring them to validate their copy of Windows by downloading an [[ActiveX]] control which checks the authenticity of their Windows software. If successful in validating Windows, it stores a license file on the PC for future verification.
* After successful validation, the regular update download can continue.
If the software decides the instance of Windows does not have a valid license, WGA displays a specific notice to the user and prevents non-critical updates from being downloaded from Microsoft.

The ActiveX control is downloaded on the first validation and when a new version is available, but the validation itself can be performed any time the user connects to a Microsoft Website to update.

* On [[Windows Vista]] RTM, WGA validation failure has a greater impact. In addition to persistent notification and the disabling of non-critical updates, WGA also disables [[Windows Aero]], [[Windows Defender]], and [[ReadyBoost]]. The user is given a grace period in which to then pass validation, after which most of the operating system is disabled and Windows reverts to ''reduced functionality mode''. This behavior however has been removed in [[Windows Vista#Service Pack 1|Service Pack 1 of Windows Vista]] in favor of prominent notices on systems believed unlicensed.

* Microsoft has recently made some changes with a WGA update for Windows XP Professional and Windows 7 Ultimate as well that result in not just a pop-up balloon, but instead the wallpaper changes to black, and there will be a translucent notice in the lower right-hand section of the screen that the user cannot get rid of. However, they can interact with things placed behind it still. There will also be a notification at the login screen. The user can change their desktop wallpaper to whatever they want, but the notifications will remain, and every 60 minutes it will revert back to the black screen. However, This will only happened to the first user in the computer where you log on to, if you choose different user, it will not turn black, and your wallpaper will remain.

== Software ==
=== WGA Validation Tool ===
[[File:Wpa-success-win2k8.png|thumb|200px|right|A successful activation on [[Windows Server 2008]] Enterprise (same dialog will show on [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]])]]
When a user installs Windows Genuine Advantage, an [[Internet Explorer]] add-on is installed labeled &quot;Windows Genuine Advantage&quot;. In early releases the tool could be readily disabled with the IE Add-on Management feature. A Windows [[Group Policy]] was added by later updates, causing this option to be unavailable by default, but still accessible if the policy were removed. As of July 2006, the latest update blocks management by other means.

The program uses either a stand-alone program to generate a key or an [[ActiveX]] control to discover whether the [[Key server (software licensing)|license key]] is valid; either way an Internet connection is required. If WGA determines that a user's copy of Windows is [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized]] but was installed from seemingly-legitimate media (i.e., the [[CD-ROM|CD]] and holographic emblem present on real copies of Windows seems genuine), then Microsoft will supply the user with a new CD. Microsoft also offers discounts to people who want to purchase a legitimate copy of Windows but do not have a valid CD. Microsoft has indicated that they will continue to deliver critical security updates through their Automatic Updates service as well as via the Microsoft Download Center, so that all systems, including those that fail to pass validation, will still continue to receive critical security updates.

The company has made installation of Windows Genuine Advantage a requirement for use of the [[Windows Update]] and [[Microsoft Update]] websites, in part to be sure that customers who use support resources of the company are aware when their software is unlicensed. According to Microsoft themselves, it is legal to run Microsoft Windows without Windows Genuine Advantage {{Citation needed|date=September 2007}}. However, since non-critical Windows updates are not presented by Automatic Updates, installation of WGA is required for installation of such non-critical updates, which are only available through Windows Update or the Microsoft Download Center.

=== WGA Notifications ===
{{Out of date|section|date=April 2009}}
On April 25, 2006, Microsoft began distributing Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905474/ Microsoft.com - Description of the Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications application], retrieved June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as &quot;critical update&quot; [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/905474 KB905474] to Windows users. For Windows 7, [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971033 KB971033] has the same function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971033 Description of the update for Windows Activation Technologies]&lt;/ref&gt; Back in 2006, users with pirated copies were exposed to alerts&lt;ref&gt;[http://labnol.blogspot.com/2006/04/wga-notifications-this-copy-of-windows.html Digital Inspiration - Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications], retrieved June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; at startup, login, and during use of the Windows OS, stating that they do not have a genuine copy of Windows. Users with legitimate copies are not supposed to see the alerts (although some do anyway&lt;ref&gt;Announcement on usenet entitled &quot;Windows Genuine Advantage - warning appears on activated machine&quot; by Rubert Sland&lt;/ref&gt;). On May 23, 2006, Microsoft updated the program, closing some forms of circumvention, but reportedly not all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/news/breaking/microsoft-back-to-drawing-board-on-piracy/2005/08/08/1123353252441.html?oneclick=true Sydney Morning Herald - Microsoft back to drawing board on piracy], retrieved June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; It was updated again on May 30, June 6 and June 27, 2006, though some forms of circumvention are still usable. The latest versions do not roll out worldwide at the same time: the dates given are the earliest dates on which the versions appeared, so the actual version being offered in some places will be an earlier version than the latest release. It is still possible to opt out of receiving this update using the &quot;do not show&quot; option at the Windows Update site.  In addition to these notifications, Windows Genuine Advantage will also notify users with the message &quot;This version of Windows XP is no longer secure&quot; if users on an XP Operating System are not using Service Pack 3, and it will provide a link to help users to upgrade their systems to the new service pack.

The version of Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications released November 29, 2006 had a changed install process to inform the user of what the program does, and can also be set to automatically update to newer versions of Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications. It also informs users that may have a non-genuine version of Windows why their Windows version isn't being reported as genuine. However, unlike previous releases, it started being only automatically delivered to Windows machines using four widely-distributed product keys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/wga/archive/2006/11/29/new-wga-notifications-released.aspx MSDN Blogs - New Windows Genuine Advantage Notifications Released], retrieved December 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest update (version 1.9.0040.0) was released on March 24, 2009.

=== WGA Validation Library ===
Microsoft includes the Windows Genuine Advantage Validation Library in several products, such as Windows validation tool or [[Windows Media Player 11]], to check the validation about all Windows software. As of version 7, [[Internet Explorer]] no longer requires the user to pass a Windows Genuine Advantage test in order to download or install the software.

The WGA Validation Library is also included in the [[Microsoft Security Essentials]] 2.0 and validate the Windows installation whether it is legitimate or not. The program will stop working after 30 days once it failed the validation process.

The information is then used in the WGA Library to check for overuse of license keys.

== Circumvention ==

In September 2005, Microsoft filed lawsuits against a number of companies that sold unauthorized copies of software based on information from users who were told they have [[copyright infringement|copyright infringing]] software by the Windows Genuine Advantage application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2005/sep05/09-19PiracyEnfSept05PR.mspx Microsoft.com - Microsoft Files Lawsuits to Protect Consumers and Software Resellers], retrieved June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 16, 2005, Microsoft released a standard Netscape WGA plug-in to complete the Windows validation process from [[Mozilla Firefox]] and other [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]]-based browsers (including [[Netscape]]) - although it does not use the Firefox extensions system, and thus is not supported by the latest version of the browser. It does not work in other [[NPAPI]] browsers such as [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]. Another workaround was released on December 25, 2005 to bypass WGA authentication by using a valid hash generated by a remote system.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} Microsoft responded with a [[cease and desist]] letter to the website host, and the workaround was taken down on January 6, 2006. Many people continue to validate on the Microsoft website from a public computer using a genuine copy of Windows, then write down the hash and continue to use it at home or work.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} As of July 2006, Microsoft had not prevented people from disabling WGA in this manner. On May 4, 2006 Microsoft announced lawsuits for allegedly distributing unauthorized copies of Windows against eDirectSoftware of Montana, and Chicago-area resellers Nathan Ballog and Easy Computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/story/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=187200796 InformationWeek - Microsoft: Users may have to prove legal Windows use], retrieved June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Various workarounds to get past WGA authentication have been released on the Internet. Before Microsoft issued official instructions&lt;ref name=&quot;disable_wga&quot;/&gt; on removing the WGA Notifier (a desktop application which resides in the notification area and periodically displays messages, reminding users to authenticate their operating system), users simply had to remove 2 files in order to get rid of the software from their system (four files: one executable and one dynamic link library in C:\Windows\system32\ and their exact copies in C:\Windows\system32\dllcache\; only an administrator can rename/delete these files).  

In September 2006, Microsoft dropped various required validations on programs such as [[ActiveSync]].

In June 2007 it was found to be possible to validate with WGA when running [[Linux]] (see [[Windows Genuine Advantage#False negatives|below]]).  The WGA Validation Tool has undergone a number of version changes since then, so this may well no longer be true.

== Notifications and firewalls ==
Some [[personal firewall]]s, though not one embedded in Windows, may alert on the method by which wgatray.exe is started; in the case of Outpost firewall, it is identified as a &quot;hidden process&quot;. The wgatray.exe process itself can be firewall blocked, without apparent problems.

A tool has been released by a firewall vendor to prevent WGA Notifications transmitting information from one's PC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/22/wga_remove/ The Register - How to stop Microsoft's WGA phoning home]&lt;/ref&gt;

== WGA in China ==
[[File:Vista chn black2.JPG|thumb|right|An example of a Chinese WGA notice.]]
On October 20, 2008, many users of Windows XP in China received a black desktop, as Microsoft introduced its WGA system for Chinese language systems,&lt;ref&gt;[http://wzdsb.66wz.com/system/2008/10/19/100853032.shtml å¾®è½¯ååºâé»è²æéâ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.163.com/08/1015/19/4OANN9V8000915BD.html å¾®è½¯å¼å§æå»çç æ¡é¢èæ¯åä¸ºé»è²]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.wired.com/business/2008/10/microsoft-peeve.html Microsoft Peeves Chinese With Anti-Piracy Tactics - Wired.com]&lt;/ref&gt; in an effort to combat piracy, which is extremely high in China. This version of WGA is of a more hostile approach as compared to previous forms, as it provides a hindrance to users and trespasses on usability. Since the majority of users in China run on a pirated copy of Windows, many users have experienced what is described as a &quot;black screen syndrome&quot;, where the operating system changes the desktop background to a black screen every 60 minutes, as well as displaying constant warning messages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hi.baidu.com/guoguo6688/blog/item/fcc44fc6f05d541f9d163d86.html å¯¹ç½ä¸çä¼ çãå¾®è½¯è¯¦è§£Vista SP1å°æççæ¿æ´»ãä¸ç¹è´¨ç]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbifamily.com/software/softsystem/2008-02-25/1203920558d1083.html  çççå©æ¢¦ï¼Vista SP1æ°çåççææ¯]&lt;/ref&gt; Some users have even reported the disabling of Office programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint and Outlook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://it.icxo.com/htmlnews/2008/10/16/1310099.htm å¾®è½¯å¼å§æå»çç æ¡é¢èæ¯åä¸ºé»è²]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various polls carried out by Chinese portals such as Sohu.com, QQ.com, 21cn.com, and many others, a large number (over 60% of those surveyed) of Chinese Internet users are hostile to Microsoft Windows Genuine Advantage (WGA) and Office Genuine Advantage (OGA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.china.org.cn/china/national/2008-10/17/content_16630207.htm Panicking users rail against Microsoft anti-piracy crackdown]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
=== Time bomb ===
Even if WGA does not really make the program unusable, no updates except critical ones can be downloaded from Microsoft. Rather than just disallowing updating, [[Windows Vista]] originally ran in reduced-functionality mode if found by WGA to be compromised&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.zdnet.com/2346-12554_22-56027-3.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=221]&lt;/ref&gt; if a product has not been considered genuine which has made some people compare WGA to [[Time bomb (software)|time bomb software]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,2031647,00.asp Onerous Vista ActivationâA Time Bomb? - Columns by PC Magazine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,222518,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Windows Genuine Advantage: A Ticking Time Bomb? | date=October 19, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Bott/?p=84 Â» Is Microsoft about to release a Windows âkill switchâ? | Ed Bottâs Microsoft Report | ZDNet.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Vista SP1 has removed this behavior and reverted to the nag-only methods of Windows XP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_sp1_wga.asp |title=

=== Spyware accusations ===
The notification tool has been accused of [[spyware]]-like behavior, &quot;[[phoning home]]&quot; on a daily basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lauren.vortex.com/archive/000178.html Lauren Weinstein's Blog - Windows XP update may be classified as 'spyware'], retrieved June 13, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6081286.html?tag=nl.e589 Microsoft's antipiracy tool &quot;phones home&quot; daily], retrieved June 13, 2006 {{Wayback | url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-6081286.html?tag=nl.e589 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20060616113506 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, Microsoft was sued under anti-spyware statutes over WGA's non-disclosed &quot;phone home&quot; behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/business/275780_msftsuit29.html Lawsuit calls Microsoft's anti-piracy tool spyware | Seattle Post-Intelligencer], retrieved June 29, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit has since been dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2010/02/microsoft-wins-windows-xp-wga-lawsuit.ars Microsoft wins windows xp wga lawsuit | ars technica], retrieved August 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False positive rate ===
The WGA program can produce [[Type I and type II errors|false positives]] (incorrectly identifying a genuine copy of Windows as &quot;not genuine&quot;). This can happen for any number of reasons such as failed updates, etc.  Microsoft has established a forum to help users encountering problems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/Genuine/ShowForum.aspx?ForumID=442&amp;SiteID=25 Microsoft WGA Help Forum]&lt;/ref&gt;  In February 2007, a &quot;Not Sure&quot; section was added to the program, in case of an incorrect reading.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2007/02/8922.ars Ars Technica: Windows Genuine Advantage's newest setting: &quot;You might be a pirate&quot;], retrieved June 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to an editorial on the [[arstechnica.com]] technology website, WGA reported around 22% of 500 million Windows computers as failing the test; of these less than 0.5% were due to pirate software, with the balance (over 20%, or 90% of all positives) related to non piracy issues. Microsoft &quot;refused to comment on the rate of pure false positives&quot; beyond saying it was &quot;under 1%&quot; (or as stated, at most around 5 million users affected).&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070124-8690.html Windows Genuine Advantage falsely accuses millions&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== False negatives ===
On June 18, 2007, news surfaced that it is possible to positively validate as a &quot;Genuine Microsoft Product&quot; user (andâ as a resultâ be able to download certain software from [[Microsoft]]'s official website) using [[Internet Explorer]] with [[IEs4Linux]] and [[Wine (software)|Wine]], running on [[Linux]],&lt;ref name=&quot;wine&quot;/&gt; without even having a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]-family system installed.

=== Major failures in WGA system ===
From the moment that WGA was released, it had a flaw that allows a typical user to remove the program without uninstalling its root key, causing Windows to think that the software is installed although no &quot;nagging&quot; process or [[RAM]] usage occurs.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} This flaw has not yet (July 2009) been fixed, although it still prevents critical system updates.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}

On October 5, 2006, a WGA failure occurred, incorrectly flagging some systems as being non-genuine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/wga/archive/2006/10/05/WGA-service-outage.aspx WGA failure on October 5th, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2007, the Microsoft WGA servers suffered an outage, resulting in many legitimate copies of Windows XP and Vista being marked as counterfeit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/Genuine/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=2053834&amp;SiteID=25 Microsoft WGA Help Forum citing response from MS Support]&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was solved about twelve hours later. According to Microsoft, &quot;fewer than 12,000 systems were affected worldwide.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/wga/archive/2007/08/27/update-on-validation-issues.aspx Update on Validation Issues]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 18, 2008, reports of Microsoft's WGA and OGA servers being offline surfaced again.  Microsoft later responded that only offline verification was temporarily down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080718-microsofts-wga-and-oga-servers-are-down-again.html Users reporting failed Windows and Office validations or..
