'''Berry Linux''' is a [[Live CD]] [[Linux distribution]] that has English and Japanese support. Berry Linux is based on  and is compatible with [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 15 packages. The distribution is primarily focused on use as a [[Live CD]], but it can also be installed to a [[live USB]] drive. Berry Linux can be used to try out and showcase [[Linux]], for educational purposes, or as a rescue system, without the need to make changes to a [[hard disk]]. The current version is 1.12 as of {{date|30 October 2011}}.

== Features ==
Berry includes read/write [[NTFS]] support, and [[AIGLX]] and [[Beryl (window manager)|Beryl]] are bundled for 3D  desktop effects. Berry also uses [[bootsplash]], giving it a graphical startup.

The full version (v1.12) includes  and runs on [[Linux Kernel]] 3.0.4. It has the [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]] sound system, [[Advanced Configuration and Power Interface|ACPI]] support, and [[SELinux]]. Berry Linux features automatic hardware detection, with support for many graphics cards, sound cards, SCSI, USB devices and many other peripherals. Network devices are automatically configured with [[DHCP]].

The full version of Berry Linux uses [[KDE]] (Version 4.6.5) while Berry Linux Mini uses the [[Fluxbox]] window manager. The full version is 512.7MB, while the mini version is 273.4MB. To test Berry Linux it is not necessary to install the distribution to a hard disk, as the operating system runs entirely from CD-ROM. It is, however, possible to install Berry Linux to a hard disk, which requires 1.7 gigabytes of free space.
Supporting Japanese, Berry includes Whiz, a sharp Kana-Kanji conversion system. It also comes with [[LibreOffice]] version 3.4.3, a [[Microsoft Office]] compatible office suite, as well as [[TextMaker]]/[[PlanMaker]] as Berry's office software.
