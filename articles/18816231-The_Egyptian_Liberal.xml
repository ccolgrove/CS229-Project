'''Tahrir Square''' ({{lang-ar|ÙÙØ¯Ø§Ù Ø§ÙØªØ­Ø±ÙØ±}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|MÄ«dÄn at-Taá¸¥rÄ«r}}'', {{IPA-arz|meËdÃ¦Ën ettÃ¦Ä§ËÉ¾iËÉ¾|IPA}}, {{lang-en|Liberation Square}}) is a major public [[town square]] in [[Downtown Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. 

==History==
The square was originally called ''Ismailia Square'' ({{lang-ar|ÙÙØ¯Ø§Ù Ø§ÙØ¥Ø³ÙØ§Ø¹ÙÙÙØ©}} ''{{transl|ar|MÄ«dÄn al-IsmÄâÄ«liyyah}}''), after the 19th-century ruler [[Khedive Ismail]], who commissioned the new downtown district's 'Paris on the [[Nile]]' design. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]] the square became widely known as Tahrir (Liberation) Square, but the square was not officially renamed until the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], which changed Egypt from a [[constitutional monarchy]] into a [[republic]]. The square was a focal point for the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vatikiotis, Panayiotis J. |title=The Middle East: From the End of Empire to the End of the Cold War |year=1997 |publisher=Routledge |pages=194 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the centre of Tahrir Square is a large and busy [[traffic circle]]. On the north-east side is a plaza with a statue of nationalist hero [[Alexandria expedition of 1807#Occupation of Rosetta|Omar Makram]], celebrated for his resistance against Napoleon I's invasion of Egypt, and beyond is the Omar Makram Mosque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.touregypt.net/featurestories/midanaltahrir.htm |title=Midan Al-Tahrir, Liberation Square |publisher=Tour Egypt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The square is the northern terminus of the historic [[Qasr al-Ayn Street|Qasr al-Ayni Street]], the western terminus of [[Talaat Harb Street]], and via [[Qasr el-Nil Street|Qasr al-Nil Street]] crossing its southern portion it has direct access to the [[Qasr al-Nil Bridge]] crossing the nearby [[Nile River]]. 

The area around Tahrir Square includes the [[Egyptian Museum]], the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party-NDP]] headquarters building, the [[The Mogamma|Mogamma]] government building, the [[Headquarters of the Arab League]] building, the Nile Hotel, Kasr El Dobara Evangelical Church and the original [[Khairy Pasha palace|downtown campus]] of the [[American University in Cairo]].

The [[Cairo Metro]] serves Tahrir Square with the [[Anwar al-Sadat|Sadat]] Station, which is the downtown junction of the system's two lines, linking to [[Giza]], [[Maadi]], [[Helwan]], and other districts and suburbs of [[Greater Cairo]]. Its underground access viaducts provide the safest routes for pedestrians crossing the broad roads of the heavily trafficked square.

==Public use and demonstrations==
Tahrir Square has been the traditional site for numerous major protests and demonstrations over the years, including the [[1977 Egyptian Bread Riots]], and the March 2003 protest against the [[War in Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/s_345537.html |title=Egyptian reformers taking it to streets |publisher=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review |author=Hiel, Betsy |date=19 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January, the seventh day of the protests, [[BBC]] and other correspondents reported that the number of demonstrators had grown to at least 100,000,&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12320959 &quot;Egypt protesters step up pressure on Hosni Mubarak&quot;] 31 January 2011.

The square became established as a focal point and a symbol for the ongoing Egyptian democracy demonstrations. On 2 February violence erupted between the pro-[[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] and pro-democracy demonstrators here, followed by the 3 February 'Friday of Departure' demonstration, one of the named &quot;day of&quot; events centered in the square. Within a week, due to international media coverage, the image and name of Tahrir Square became known worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;Al Jazeera News: [http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/20112391254105223.html &quot;Battle of Tahrir Square&quot;] 3 February 2011 .

An iPhone and Blackberry app called Tahrir Square was launched on 6 May 2011.  It offers a unique opportunity for Egyptians everywhere to provide their collective and unfiltered opinion on the hottest topics of the new Egypt. The results presented clearly in simple graphs and tables for everyone to see. The interactive mobile app will be distributed on a regular basis to over a dozen Egyptian news agencies, government offices, the military council, and hundreds of social media sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/12/idUS28528+12-May-2011+MW20110512 ] Reuters.

The 18-day revolt centered in the square provided the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]] an opportunity to remove Mubarak from power on Friday 11 February 2011, when the president officially stepped down from office.&lt;ref&gt;STRATFOR:

===Post-revolution===
Tahrir Square, with 'democracy anniversary' celebrations and visits from foreign dignitaries, continues to be a symbol of the 2011 Egyptian Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12507217 &quot;Thousands attend political rally in central Cairo&quot;]; 18 February 2011; Accessed 2011.02.21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12525310 &quot;David Cameron meets locals around Cairo's Tahrir Square&quot;]; 21 February 2011; Accessed 2011.02.21.&lt;/ref&gt; British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], [[Catherine Ashton]], the [[High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] of the [[European Union]], [[Hillary Clinton]], [[Secretary of State]] of the [[United States]],  [[John Kerry]], Chairman of the American [[Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], [[Kevin Rudd]] Foreign Minister of Australia, and American actor [[Sean Penn]] visited Tahrir Square after the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]].

One of the ships in the planned [[Freedom Flotilla II]], intended to break the Israeli blockade of Gaza, was named Tahrir after the square. Among its passengers was [[Haaretz]] reporter Amira Hass. Ultimately, the sailing did not take place.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/fear-and-no-clean-clothing-amira-hass-preparing-to-sail-for-gaza-1.369611&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 29 June 2011, Egyptian police attacked rioting Egyptian youth in the square with tear gas and other non-lethal materials. The youth had been demanding that trials of senior officials overthrown in the [[2011 Egyptian Revolution]] proceed more quickly. The Interior Ministry blamed the unrest on disruptive and subversive groups.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.haaretz.com/news/mideast-in-turmoil/egypt-police-fire-tear-gas-at-protesting-youths-in-tahrir-square-1.370172&lt;/ref&gt;
