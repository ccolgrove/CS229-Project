'''Vodafone Italia''' (former ''Omnitel Pronto- Italia'') is an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mobile telephony]] operator. The company has 31,000,000 customers and a market share of 33.4%, placing it just behind [[Telecom Italia Mobile|TIM]]. Vodafone Italia is an owned subsidiary of [[Vodafone|Vodafone Group plc]] (76.86%) &amp; [[Verizon]] (23.14%).

==Network and coverage==
Like other [[Europe]]an operators, Vodafone Italia uses [[GSM]], [[UMTS]], [[HSDPA]], [[HSUPA]] technologies for its network. Vodafone Italia began to deploy EDGE on its network during summer 2011.
As of December 30th, 2008, this was Vodafone Italia's coverage:
* GSM/GPRS: 99.7% of the population, 98% of the territory
* UMTS/HSDPA: &gt; 85% of the population

==History==
In December 1995, '''Omnitel Pronto-Italia''' launched its services in Italy. '''Omnitel''' was a mobile operator and '''Infostrada''' (today owned by [[WIND (Italy)|Wind]]) was a fixed-line operator. They belonged to [[Olivetti]] and  represented the first telephone alternative to monopolists [[Telecom Italia Mobile|TIM]] and [[Telecom Italia]].

Original majority owner [[Olivetti]] sold its interest in Omnitel and Infostrada to the German consortium [[Mannesmann]] (which had been a minority shareholder since 1997) after Olivetti took control of [[Telecom Italia]], and thus TIM, in 1999. Mannesmann took control of Omnitel with a 53.7% equity stake.

The following year, [[Vodafone]] purchased Mannesmann, thus taking control of Omnitel. The Vodafone [[brand]] was introduced as ''Omnitel-Vodafone'' in 2001, made the primary brand as ''Vodafone-Omnitel'' in 2002; finally the current name ''Vodafone Italia'' was introduced in 2003, dropping &quot;Omnitel&quot; altogether. Vodafone Italy introduced the new Speechmark Logo only on 10 June 2007.

The company slogan varies from that of the international Vodafone campaign (''Make the most of now'') and is ''Life is NOW''. The company website was known as '''190.it''' as 190 is the customer care number for Vodafone Italy. Starting from July 2008, the company URL has been changed from &quot;190.it&quot; to &quot;vodafone.it&quot;.  The company's spokesmodel from 1999 to 2006, for both Omnitel and Vodafone, was Australian model [[Megan Gale]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/1999/aprile/16/australiana_anni_ragazza_dello_spot_co_0_9904163179.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since taking over the company, Vodafone has introduced its suite of services in Italy, such as [[Vodafone live!]] and UTMS/HSPDA services, and has collaborated in partnership to launch of [[Mobile virtual network operator]]s for other corporations.

In 2007, like in [[Vodafone Spain|Spain]], Vodafone Italy has bought the Italian branch of [[Tele2]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vodafone.com/start/media_relations/news/group_press_releases/2007/vodafone_to_acquire.html]&lt;/ref&gt;, renaming later as [[TeleTu]] in 2010, adding fixed-line network offers.
