'''Anne Perry''' (born 28 October 1938) is an [[England|English]] author of [[historical novel|historical]] [[detective fiction]]. Perry was convicted of the [[ParkerâHulme murder|murder of her friend's mother]] in 1954. 

==Early life==
Born '''Juliet Marion Hulme''' in [[Blackheath, London]], the daughter of Dr. Henry Hulme, an English [[physics|physicist]], Perry was diagnosed with [[tuberculosis]] as a child and sent to the [[Caribbean]] and [[South Africa]] in hopes that a warmer climate would improve her health. She rejoined her family when her father took a position as [[Rector]] of the [[University of Canterbury]], [[New Zealand]] when she was 13. She attended [[Christchurch Girls' High School]], then located in what became the [[Cranmer Centre]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Pauline Parker|url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/people/pauline-parker|publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage|accessdate=20 May 2011|date=updated 22 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with her school friend [[Pauline Parker]], Hulme murdered Parker's mother, Honora Rieper,&lt;ref&gt;Although Honora used the surname Rieper, she was never legally married to Herbert Rieper.&lt;/ref&gt; in June 1954. Hulme's parents were in the process of separating, and she was supposed to go to South Africa to stay with a relative. The two teenage girls, who had created a rich [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasy]] life together populated with famous actors such as [[James Mason]] and [[Orson Welles]], did not want to be separated. They had hoped to go to England with Hulme's father after the divorce.

==Murder and trial==
{{main|ParkerâHulme murder}}
On 22 June 1954, the girls took Honora Rieper for a walk in Victoria Park in their hometown of Christchurch. On an isolated path Hulme dropped an ornamental stone so that Ms. Rieper would lean over to retrieve it. At that point, Parker had planned to hit her mother with half a brick wrapped in a stocking. The girls presumed that would kill the woman. Instead, it took 45 frenzied blows from both girls to finally kill Honora Rieper. The brutality of the crime has contributed to its notoriety.

Parker and Hulme stood trial in Christchurch in 1954, and were found guilty on August 29 of that year. As they were too young to be considered for the [[death penalty]] under New Zealand law at the time, they were convicted and sentenced to be &quot;detained [[at Her Majesty's pleasure]]&quot;. In practice, this sentence meant they were to be detained at the discretion of the Minister of Justice. They were released separately some five years later. A condition of their release was that they were never to meet or contact each other again.

Parker and Hulme are not believed to have had any contact since their trial, as required by the conditions of their release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald interview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;ObjectID=10371147|title=We were not lesbians, says former Juliet Hulme|date=5 March 2006|work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| accessdate = 21 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These events formed the basis for the 1994 film ''[[Heavenly Creatures]]'', in which [[Melanie Lynskey]] portrayed a teenage Pauline Parker and [[Kate Winslet]] portrayed teenaged Juliet Hulme.

==Later life==
After being released from prison, Hulme returned to England and became a [[flight attendant]]. For a period she lived in the [[United States]], where she joined [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] in 1968. She later settled in the Scottish village of [[Portmahomack]] where she lived with her mother. Her father went on to a distinguished scientific career, heading the British [[hydrogen bomb]] programme. 

Hulme took the name Anne Perry, the latter being her stepfather's surname. Her first novel, ''[[The Cater Street Hangman]]'', was published under this name in 1979. Her works generally fall into one of several categories of [[genre fiction]], including historical murder mysteries and [[detective fiction]]. Many of them feature a number of [[recurring character]]s, most importantly [[Thomas Pitt (fictional character)|Thomas Pitt]], who appeared in her first novel, and amnesiac private investigator [[William Monk]], who first appeared in her 1990 novel ''The Face of a Stranger''. As of 2003 she had published 47 novels, and several collections of short stories.  Her story &quot;Heroes&quot;, which first appeared in the 1999 anthology ''Murder and Obsession'', edited by [[Otto Penzler]], won the 2001 [[Edgar Award]] for Best Short Story.

She was included as an entry in [[Ben Peek]]'s ''Twenty-Six Lies/One Truth'', a novel exploring the nature of truth in literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ben Peek|title=Twenty-Six Lies/One Truth|publisher=Wheatland Press|location=USA|page=96|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2005, Perry appeared on the ''[[Trisha Goddard (TV Series)|Trisha]]'' show to discuss the crime on a special themed show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftvdb.bfi.org.uk/sift/title/817932 Film &amp; TV Database]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many presumed Hulme's and Parker's relationship to be sexual, Perry stated in 2006 that although the relationship was obsessive, the two were not lesbians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herald interview&quot; /&gt;

==Bibliography ==
Each series is listed in internal chronological order, according to the author's website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anneperry.net/booklist/6&lt;/ref&gt;

The two main series each feature a couple. Thomas Pitt is matched with Charlotte whom he marries in the first books; her female society relatives help in the mysteries out of boredom. William Monk is matched with Hester, a Crimean War nurse and it takes longer for them to marry. The Monk mysteries are set earlier in the Victorian era (1850s-1860s) than the Pitt books (1880s-1890s). The Christmas stories involve minor characters such as sisters, bosses, or grandmamas in a personal crisis at a later Christmas time with a strongly enforced redemption message at the end.
