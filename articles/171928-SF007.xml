The '''Almquist shell''' (also known as '''A Shell''', '''ash''' and '''sh''') was originally [[Kenneth Almquist]]'s clone of the [[SVR4]]-variant of the [[Bourne shell]]; it is a fast, small, [[POSIX]]-compatible [[Unix shell]] designed to replace the Bourne shell in later [[BSD]] distributions.  Originally it did not feature line editing{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} or [[command history]] mechanisms, because Almquist felt that such should be moved into the [[Computer terminal|terminal]] [[Device driver|driver]]; however, current variants support it.

Derivatives of ash are installed as the default shell (&lt;tt&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/tt&gt;) on [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[DragonFly BSD]] and [[Minix]]. ash is also fairly popular in [[embedded Linux]] systems; its code was incorporated into the [[BusyBox]] catch-all executable often employed in this area. [[Debian]]'s version of ash is known as [[Debian Almquist shell|Debian Almquist Shell (dash)]].

Some [[Linux distribution]]s also use [[Debian_Almquist_shell|a derivative of ash]] as the default shell, although [[Bash (Unix shell)|Bash]] (Bourne Again Shell) is more popular. Debian and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Symbolic link|symlink]] &lt;tt&gt;/bin/sh&lt;/tt&gt; to the dash shell for faster [[Shell script|script]] execution, but keeps Bash as the default login shell.
The following is extracted from the ash package information from [[Slackware]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;ash (Kenneth Almquist's ash shell)''

&lt;blockquote&gt;A lightweight (92K) Bourne compatible shell. Great for machines with low memory, but does not provide all the extras of shells like [[Bash_(Unix_shell)|bash]], [[tcsh]], and [[zsh]]. Runs most shell scripts compatible with the Bourne shell. Note that under Linux, most scripts seem to use at least some bash-specific syntax. The Slackware setup scripts are a notable exception, since ash is the shell used on the install disks. NetBSD and Ubuntu uses ash as its /bin/sh.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ash has since been replaced on both [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].  Dash became the replacement for ash in Debian and was expected to be the default /bin/sh for Debian Lenny.&lt;ref&gt;[http://release.debian.org/lenny/goals.txt Release goals for Debian Lenny]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.debian.org/debian-devel-announce/2008/04/msg00002.html Release Update: architecture status, release goal status, BSPs]&lt;/ref&gt; Dash became the default /bin/sh in [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] starting with the 6.10 release in October 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DashAsBinSh Dash as /bin/sh in Ubuntu 6.10]&lt;/ref&gt;
