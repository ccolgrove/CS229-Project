'''WRTP''' (88.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[Christian contemporary]] format. Licensed to [[Franklinton, North Carolina]], USA, it serves the Rocky Mount-Wilson area.  The station is currently owned by Radio Training Network.

==History==
After Carolina Christian Communications sold [[WLLQ|WRTP-AM]] and simulcast stations [[WRTG]] and [[WGSB (AM)|WGSB]] to Radio Training Network, that company bought WHGG-FM 90.1 FM in Roanoke Rapids, which was licensed to a school, and changed its name to WRTP-FM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/rdurw/am.html|title=Raleigh-Durham AM Dial|accessdate=2010-05-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20021015115610/http://www.geocities.com/rdurw/am.html|archivedate=2002-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first translator, W216BN at 91.1 in Raleigh, signed on in 1999, giving the stations a nighttime signal in that area.  W216BN moved from north Raleigh to the [[WSHA]] tower to prevent interference to [[WUNC-FM]]. Another translator was W257BH at 99.3 FM in [[Lizard Lick, North Carolina|Lizard Lick]], serving eastern [[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/rdurw/fm.html|title=Raleigh-Durham FM Dial|accessdate=2010-05-05|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20030201081556/http://www.geocities.com/rdurw/fm.html|archivedate=2003-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; WRTP-FM eventually moved to the 88.5 frequency, former home of [[WZRU]]. After WRTP-AM was sold to [[Que Pasa Radio]], WRTP-FM continued to broadcast, having increased to 24 hours a day, on multiple FM frequencies throughout central and eastern North Carolina and on line at http://www.goodnews.org.

WRTP plans a city of license change to [[Franklinton, North Carolina]].
