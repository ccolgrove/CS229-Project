'''Ultras''' are a type of [[sports fan]]s renowned for their fanatical support and elaborate displays. They are predominantly [[Europe]]an followers of [[Association football|football]] teams. The behavioral tendency of ultras groups includes the use of [[Flare (pyrotechnic)|flares]] (primarily in [[tifo]] choreography), vocal support in large groups and the displaying of banners at football stadiums, all of which are designed to create an atmosphere which encourages their own team and intimidates opposing players and supporters.

The actions of ultras groups can occasionally be overly extreme and are sometimes influenced by [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]] or views on [[racism]],&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC Sports&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/analysis/molinaro/molinaro_050415.html|title=The dark heart of Italian soccer|publisher=[[CBC Sports]]|date=2005-04-15|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some instances to the point where the central ideology of the ultras phenomenon, passionate and loyal support of your team, becomes a sideshow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/nov/12/europeanfootball.sport2|title=Fan tragedy sends the fight against Ultras back to square one|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2007-11-12|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent decades, the culture has become a focal point for the movement against the [[commercialization]] of sports and football in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2008/apr/07/europeanfootball.sport2|title=Are German fans really turning against the beautiful game?|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2008-04-07|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of the ultras movement is disputed,&lt;ref name=&quot;In Bed With Maradona&quot;/&gt; with many supporters groups from various countries making claims solely on the basis of their dates of foundation. The level of dispute and confusion is aided by a contemporary tendency (mainly in Europe) to categorize all groups of overtly fanatical supporters as ''ultras''. Supporters groups of a nature comparable to the ultras have been present in [[Brazil]] since 1939, when the first [[torcida organizada]] was formed. Inspired by the torcidas and the colorful scenes of the [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]], supporters of [[HNK Hajduk Split|Hajduk Split]] formed [[Torcida Split]] on 28 October 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.torcida.hr/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;layout=blog&amp;id=47&amp;Itemid=98|title=Povijest|publisher=Torcida.hr|accessdate=2011-02-05}} {{Hr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group is often cited as the oldest ultras/torcida style group in Europe.           

The country most associated with the ultras movement is [[Italy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;In Bed With Maradona&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inbedwithmaradona.com/we-dont-fight-we-paint-flags-instead/|title=We Don't Fight, We Paint Flags Instead|publisher=In Bed With Maradona|date=2010-11-02|accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSC&quot;/&gt; The first Italian ultras groups were formed in 1951, including the Fedelissimi Granata of [[Torino F.C.|Torino]]. The 1960s saw the continuing spread and development of the culture with the formation of the [[Fossa dei Leoni]] and [[F.C. Internazionale Milano#Supporters and rivalries|Boys San]] groups, the former often regarded in Italy as the first full-fledged ultras group. The term ''Ultras'' was used as a name for the first time in 1969 when supporters of [[U.C. Sampdoria|Sampdoria]] formed the [[U.C. Sampdoria#Supporters and Rivalries|Ultras Tito Cucchiaroni]] and fans of Torino formed the Ultras Granata. The style of support that would become synonymous with Italian football developed most during the 1970s as more groups formed and the active support of the ultras became more apparent, in contrast with the &quot;traditional&quot; culture. Choreographic displays, signature banners and symbols, giant flags, drums and fireworks became the norm as groups aimed to take their support to higher levels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Football Italia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.football-italia.net/blogs/si60.html|title=Ultras rule?|publisher=Football Italia|date=2009-10-28|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decade also saw the violence and unrest of Italian society at the time overlap with the ultras movement, adding a dimension that has plagued it ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alberto Testa|first=Gary Armstrong|title=Football, Fascism and Fandom|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=2010|isbn=9781408123713}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ultras movement spread across Europe during the 1980s, 1990s and [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], starting with the countries geographically closest to Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~db=all~content=a713677719|title=Passion, politics and violence: A socio-historical analysis of Spanish ultras|publisher=Informaworld|date=2005-03|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effects on the footballing cultures of the countries involved were more profound in some and less in others, as a certain level of organization amongst fans and/or a tradition of colorful support would have long been present in many countries. [[Germany]], [[Belgium]] and the [[Netherlands]], three countries whose footballing cultures were more influenced by British football in the past, experienced significant change. [[Football in England|English football]] is a rare example of a footballing culture in Europe which hasn't been heavily influenced by the ultras movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/content/view/196/29/|title=Ultra sensitive|publisher=When Saturday Comes|date=2007-04|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Football Italia&quot;/&gt;

== Characteristics ==
Ultras groups are usually based around a core group of founders or leaders (who tend to hold executive control),&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultras pull the strings&quot;/&gt; with smaller subgroups organized by location, friendship or political stance. Ultras tend to use various styles and sizes of banners and flags bearing the name and symbols of their group.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultras pull the strings&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2007/feb/04/newsstory.sport1|title=Ultras pull the strings as Italy descends into chaos|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=2007-02-04|accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asromaultras.org/gruppi.html|title=Gruppi|publisher=asromaultras.org|accessdate=2011-02-05}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ultras groups sell their own merchandise to raise funds for performing displays.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultras pull the strings&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asromaultras.org/as_roma_ultras.html|title=AS Roma Ultras|publisher=asromaultras.org|accessdate=2011-01-18}} {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; An ultras group can number from a handful of fans to hundreds or thousands, with larger groups often claiming entire sections of a stadium for themselves. Ultras groups often have a [[Representation (politics)|representative]] who liaises with the club owners on a regular basis, mostly regarding tickets, seat allocations and storage facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ultras pull the strings&quot;/&gt; Some clubs provide groups with cheaper tickets, storage rooms for flags and banners and early access to the stadium before matches in order to prepare displays. These types of favored relationships are often criticized when ultras groups abuse their power.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBC Sports&quot;/&gt;

=== Hooliganism ===
While ultras groups can become violent, the vast majority of matches attended by ultras conclude with no violent incidents. Unlike [[List of hooligan firms|hooligan firms]], whose main aim is to fight hooligans of other clubs, the main focus of ultras is to support their own team.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spiked&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiked-online.com/index.php/site/article/2836/|title=Ultra vires|publisher=Spiked|date=2007-02-09|accessdate=2011-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hooligans usually try to be inconspicuous when they travel; usually not wearing team colors, in order to avoid detection by the [[police]]. Ultras tend to be more conspicuous when they travel, proudly displaying their scarves and club colors while arriving ''en masse'', which allows the police to keep a close eye on their movements.

However, there appears to be a degree of crossover in some countries between ultras and hooligans. In Italy, when English club [[Middlesbrough F.C.|Middlesbrough]] played a match against [[AS Roma]] in March 2006, three Middlesbrough fans were stabbed in an attack that was blamed on Roma supporting ultras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tees/4808246.stm|title=English fans are stabbed in Rome|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=2006-03-15|accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
