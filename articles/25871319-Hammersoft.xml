The Colts began their season at [[Reliant Stadium]] in an AFC South duel against the [[Houston Texans]].  Indianapolis started the season going 3-and-out on their first offensive possession of the new year.  The Texans got good field position with a big punt return from [[Jacoby Jones]] to set up a 30-yard field goal to give them a 3â0 lead. The offense continued to struggle throughout the first half, getting two first downs on the next drive, however, eventually having to punt.  The Texans continued to show energy on both offense and defense by scoring two more time, a field goal and a touchdown, giving the Texans a 13â0 lead halfway through the second quarter.  The Colts eventually got the offense going late in the second quarter by scoring on a touchdown reception by [[Reggie Wayne]], which broke the lead down to one possession. [[Adam Vinatieri]] made a 20&amp;nbsp;yard field goal at the end of the first half and the Colts went into the half trailing 13â10. The momentum was seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, until Houston took almost eight minutes off the third quarter clock on a 15-play drive, 13 rushes, that resulted in one of [[Arian Foster|Arian Foster's]] rushing touchdowns on the day to give Houston a 20â10 lead. [[Peyton Manning]] and the offense struggled throughout the third quarter with missed opportunities and continued to shoot themselves in the foot with penalties.  With the start of the fourth quarter Houston scored another touchdown and broke the game open.  The Colts would eventually score two touchdowns late in the game, only when there was no chance of a comeback.

With the final score 34â24, the Colts were 0â1 to start a season for the first time since [[2008 Indianapolis Colts season|2008]], when they lost to the [[Chicago Bears]].

After losing the previous week to Jacksonville, the Indianapolis Colts came back home to [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] to battle with an undefeated [[2010 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] team.  The Chiefs head coach, [[Todd Haley]] opened up the ballgame with an onside kick intended to give Kansas City the ball first.  However, after it bounced less than 10&amp;nbsp;yards, the Colts received possession deep in Kansas City territory.  Indianapolis was unable to capitalize on the good field position and forced [[Adam Vinatieri]] to kick a 20&amp;nbsp;yard field goal.  Throughout the first quarter both teams' offense were unable to get into a rhythm and by the end of the first quarter the Colts held a slim lead by the score of 3â0.  With the start of the second quarter the offensive woes continued.  The Colts were again unable to score a touchdown on good field position and were forced to kick their second field goal of the day.  After a failed running play of fourth down by the Colts, the Chiefs were able to move down the field on good passes by [[Matt Cassel]] and a penalty on the Colts and were able to kick a field goal. Going into halftime, the score was 6â3 Colts.  The third quarter continued to prove to be a defensive struggle.  The Colts kicked another field goal midway through, however the Chiefs drove down the field to score another field goal.  A [[Peyton Manning]] interception set up another field goal by the Chiefs which tied the game at 9â9.  At the beginning of the fourth quarter the Colts continued their scoring ways of the day with a fourth field goal from Vinatieri.  Finally with four minutes left in the ballgame, [[Mike Hart (American football)|Mike Hart]] broke open an 11&amp;nbsp;yard run for the only touchdown of the day by both teams.  The Colts won the game 19â9 and improved to 3â2 on the season.  With the Chiefs loss they were not longer an undefeated team in the [[National Football League|NFL]].

On the road at [[Lincoln Financial Field]], the Indianapolis Colts played a NFC opponent in the Philadelphia Eagles for the first time since the 2006 season.  The game did not start well for the Colts who allowed the Eagles to score a quick touchdown on only 3 plays covering 72&amp;nbsp;yards.  A [[Peyton Manning]] interception caused more concern as the Colts now found themselves under the gun halfway through the first quarter.  Two key defensive stops allowed the Eagles to only score two field goals making it a 13â0 Eagles lead heading into the second quarter.  A touchdown pass from Manning to [[Jacob Tamme]] allowed the Colts to get back into the game trailing the Eagles only 13â7.  A Philadelphia field goal from [[David Akers]] added to the lead, however the Colts continued chipping away.  A hard hit on wide receiver [[Austin Collie]], who was returning from injury that week, caused a 10&amp;nbsp;minute delay in the game in which he was strapped to a stripper and taken to a nearby hospital, where he was diagnosed with a concussion.  The Colts, playing with passion, drove down the field and scored a touchdown and field goal within the final two minutes of the half, giving them a 17â16 lead at halftime.  The offensive production seen by the Colts in the second quarter was nowhere to be found in the third.  The Colts began the third quarter with two three-and-outs while the Eagles got the lead back with a 44&amp;nbsp;yard field goal halfway through the quarter.  Going into the fourth quarter, the Eagles were driving down into scoring position where a 1&amp;nbsp;yard run by [[Michael Vick]] gave the Eagles a 26â17 lead over the Colts.  A continued lack of offensive production gave the Eagles the ball back and time to milk the clock.  The Colts received the ball back with less than four minutes remaining in the game, trailing by two scores and drove down to score a touchdown.  [[Jim Caldwell (American football)|Jim Caldwell]] elected to kick the ball away to Philadelphia with 1:50 left, a first down and a defensive stop gave the Colts the ball back with less than 0:50&amp;nbsp;seconds in the game.  After driving to midfield, Manning threw his second interception of the game and sealed the Indianapolis Colts third loss of the season.
