'''IEs4Linux''' is a free and [[open source]] [[script (computing)|script]] that allows a user to run [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) on [[Wine (software)|Wine]] (typically in a [[Linux]] configuration). It is possible to install Internet Explorer versions [[Internet Explorer 5|5]], [[Internet Explorer 5.5|5.5]], and [[Internet Explorer 6|6]]; along with partial functionality of [[Internet Explorer 7|IE7]] (the [[layout engine]] is loaded into the IE6 interface, which works well enough to demonstrate how the target page looks in IE7).

This application is oriented towards web developers: it allows users of non-Windows [[operating system]]s to view their web pages in a similar manner to how they look on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. As well, since the primary goal is to make Internet Explorer work on systems besides Windows (using Wine), it could be less likely to have issues with [[virus]]es or [[malware]] targeting Windows.

There was a blog post on January 5, 2011 announcing that the developers are now working to support [[Internet Explorer 9|IE9]] and will soon release a new version after almost 3 years of inactivity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tatanka.com.br/ies4linux/news/55&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest release of IEs4Linux, 2.99.0.1, does not work correctly when used with recent versions of Wine.  A [[Git (software)|Git]] repository exists on [[GitHub]] with additional patches that provides support for the modern versions of Wine provided by Linux distributions such as [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] 15 and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 11.10.&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/drafnel/ies4linux&lt;/ref&gt;
