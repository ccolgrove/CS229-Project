==History==
In [[1974]], the stations (and their repeaters) joined to become Spencer Gulf Telecasters and broadcast under the name ''Central GTS/BKN''.  The company has since been bought by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] (SCB), though it retained the Central name until the end of [[2005]]. In [[2003]], Spencer Gulf Telecasters won the right to broadcast a second station in the same area, and in January 2004 started broadcasting [[Southern Cross Ten]]. In January [[2006]] Central GTS/BKN was renamed ''Southern Cross GTS/BKN'', changing its logo to the same one currently used by [[Southern Cross Tasmania]] and [[TND-34|Southern Cross Darwin]]. The Southern Cross Ten logo was also updated to the current logo used by SC 10 stations elsewhere.
