==Abydonians==

The '''Abydonians''' are the people whom Colonel O'Neill's team encounters on another planet in the [[Stargate (film)|''Stargate'' film]]. They are the slaves of the alien [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]] and are descendants from [[ancient Egypt]]ians brought through the Stargate to mine the fictional mineral [[naqahdah]]. The film gives the location of their homeworld (named Abydos in ''SG-1''&lt;nowiki&gt;'s&lt;/nowiki&gt; pilot episode &quot;[[Children of the Gods]]&quot;) as the Kaliem galaxy &quot;on the far side of the known universe&quot; in the film, and as the closest planets to Earth in the Stargate network in &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;. In the film, O'Neill and Daniel Jackson inspire the Abydonians and their leader, Kasuf, to rise up against Ra. The military personnel return to Earth, while Daniel falls in love with Kasuf's daughter Sha're and remains behind. In &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, set a year after the film, the Goa'uld [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] attacks Abydos, abducting Sha're and her brother Skaara to serve as hosts for his queen Amonet and son Klorel. In season 6's {{sgcite|Full Circle}}, the Goa'uld [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] destroys Abydos, but [[Oma Desala]] helps its entire population [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascend]].

* [[File:Avari, Erick 1.jpg|thumb|[[Erick Avari]] played Kasuf in the film and the television series.]] {{anchor|Kasuf}} '''Kasuf''' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] for 'silver-colored'), played by [[Erick Avari]] (film, seasons 2â4) â The leader of the Abydonians in the film, and the father of Sha're and Skaara. In season 2's &quot;[[Secrets (Stargate SG-1)|Secrets]]&quot;, one year after [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]'s kidnapping of Kasuf's children in &quot;Children of Gods&quot;, Daniel returns to Abydos and learns that Sha're has become pregnant by Apophis. Kasuf helps Daniel to hide the newborn child from [[Heru-ur (Stargate)|Heru-ur]]. Kasuf returns in season 3's &quot;[[Forever in a Day (Stargate SG-1)|Forever in a Day]]&quot; when his daughter Sha're dies. Kasuf last appears in season 4's &quot;[[Absolute Power (Stargate SG-1)|Absolute Power]]&quot;, introducing SG-1 to his rapidly aged grandchild, [[Shifu]].
* {{Anchor|Sha're|Shau'ri|Amaunet|Amonet}} '''Sha're''' ('''Sha'uri''' in the film), played by [[Mili Avital]] (film) and [[Vaitiare Bandera]] (seasons 1â3) â Kasuf's daughter who becomes Daniel Jackson's wife and the host of the Goa'uld '''Amonet''' (also spelled '''Amaunet'''). In the film, her father Kasuf offers Sha're to Daniel Jackson as a gift, and although he initially refuses to take her as his wife, they eventually fall in love with each other. After one year of marriage in &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] takes Sha're hostage and makes her a host for his symbiote queen Amonet against her will. Daniel meets a now vastly-pregnant Sha're on a visit to Abydos in season 2's &quot;[[Secrets (Stargate SG-1)|Secrets]]&quot;. She hides her child, a [[Harcesis]] fathered by Apophis, from [[Heru-ur (Stargate)|Heru-ur]] as Amonet is dormant during the pregnancy. When Sha're gives birth to a boy, [[Shifu (Stargate)|Shifu]], Amonet takes control of Sha're but keeps information about the child to herself. Amonet returns for the child one year later in season 3's &quot;[[Forever in a Day (Stargate SG-1)|Forever in a Day]]&quot;, sending him to the planet Kheb with one of her handmaidens. During a battle at Abydos in {{sgcite|Forever in a Day}}, Amonet attacks Daniel with her [[hand device]] in a tent, and Teal'c kills Sha're with his [[staff weapon]] to prevent Daniel's death.
* [[File:Alexiscruz.jpg|thumb|[[Alexis Cruz]] played Skaara in the film and television series.]] {{anchor|Skaara|Klorel}} '''Skaara''', played by [[Alexis Cruz]] (film, seasons 1â3, 6) â The son of Kasuf and brother to Sha're. In the film, Skaara and his friends aid O'Neil and his soldiers to beat [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]]. In &quot;Children of the Gods&quot;, Skaara is taken hostage by [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] and is made the host for his symbiote son '''Klorel''' against his will. SG-1 invades Klorel's ship in the season 1 finale, &quot;[[Within the Serpent's Grasp (Stargate SG-1)|Within the Serpent's Grasp]]&quot;, but Skaara is only able to emerge shortly. After O'Neill shoots Klorel to prevent him from killing Dr. Jackson, [[Bra'tac]] revives him in a [[Sarcophagus (Stargate)|Sarcophagus]]. Skaara and Apophis flee before their ships are destroyed in the season 2 opener, &quot;[[The Serpent's Lair (Stargate SG-1)|The Serpent's Lair]]&quot;. In season 3's &quot;[[Pretense (Stargate SG-1)|Pretense]]&quot;, Klorel's ship crashes on the [[Tollan (Stargate)|Tollan]] homeworld while fleeing from [[Heru-ur (Stargate)|Heru-ur]]'s forces. With help from the Tollan technology, Skaara regains control and participates in a Tollan trial to get the symbiote separated from his body. Skaara wins the trial and eventually returns to Abydos, where he meets SG-1 one last time in the season 6 finale, &quot;[[Full Circle (Stargate SG-1)|Full Circle]]&quot;. Skaara helps SG-1 in the search for the [[Eye of Ra]] before [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] can find it on Abydos. Skaara is mortally wounded during the firefight with Anubis' Jaffa, but ascends with the help of [[Oma Desala]].

==Ancients==
{{main|Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient characters in Stargate}}
The '''Ancients''' are the original builders of the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] network, who by the time of ''Stargate SG-1'' have [[Ascension (Stargate)|ascended]] beyond corporeal form into a higher plane of existence. The humans of Earth are the &quot;second evolution&quot; of the Ancients. The Ancients (originally known as the Alterans) colonized the Milky Way galaxy millions of years ago and built a great empire. They also colonized the Pegasus galaxy and seeded human life there before being driven out by the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. The civilization of the Ancients in the Milky Way was decimated thousands of years ago by a plague and those who did not learn to ascend died out. With few exceptions the ascended Ancients respect free will and refuse to interfere in the affairs of the material galaxy. However their legacy is felt profoundly throughout the ''Stargate'' universe, from their technologies such as Stargates and [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] to the [[Ancient Technology Activation gene]] that they introduced into the human genome through interbreeding.

*  '''Ganos Lal''' or '''Morgan le Fay''', played by [[Sarah Strange]] (season 10) â An ascended Ancient who would give rise to the [[Arthurian legend]] of [[Morgan le Fay]]. Her fictional backstory closely links her to her fellow ascended Ancient Myrddin (Merlin), who aimed to construct a weapon to fight the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] that also posed a danger to the Ancients. Morgan le Fay is first referenced in season 10's &quot;[[Morpheus (Stargate SG-1)|Morpheus]]&quot; and first appears in person in &quot;[[The Pegasus Project]]&quot; where she poses as a hologram in [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]]. She gives SG-1 information about the location of Merlin's weapon, the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]], but the Others banish her for this action. Morgan le Fay is mentioned again in &quot;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest]]&quot; and returns in ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' to help SG-1 in their fight against [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]] in the Ori galaxy. She is last seen engaging Adria in an eternal battle.
* '''Moros''', also known as '''Myrddin''' or '''Merlin''', played by [[Matthew Walker (Canadian actor)|Matthew Walker]] (season 9â10) â The High Councilor of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] during the days of the first siege of the city, and is one of the most influential Ancients in the series. Moros is named after [[Moros]] from Greek legend, the personification of impending doom and destruction, while his name [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] refers to the [[Arthurian legend]]. Merlin is introduced in the ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' season 1 episode &quot;[[Before I Sleep (Stargate Atlantis)|Before I Sleep]]&quot;, where an alternate [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]] travels through time and meets him as Moros during his days on Atlantis. A tablet Merlin created thousands of years ago is found in season 9's &quot;[[Avalon (Stargate SG-1)|Avalon]]&quot; and sets the Ori arc of ''SG-1'' in motion. Merlin appears as a hologram in &quot;Avalon&quot;, season 9's &quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot; and season 10's &quot;[[The Pegasus Project (Stargate SG-1)|The Pegasus Project]]&quot;, providing information about his background and his motivations. As revealed in season 10's &quot;[[The Pegasus Project (Stargate SG-1)|The Pegasus Project]]&quot;, SG-1 must find a weapon that Merlin sought to construct to defeat the Ori, the ''[[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]]''. On this quest, SG-1 finally find Merlin in stasis in season 10's &quot;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest]]&quot; and awaken him. His body dies shortly afterwards, but his transferred consciousness remains in Daniel Jackson until &quot;[[The Shroud (Stargate SG-1)|The Shroud]]&quot; to complete the building of the Sangraal.{{â¢}} Matthew Walker was nominated for a [[Leo Award]] in 2007 for &quot;Best Supporting Performance by a Male in a Dramatic Series&quot; for this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0908022/awards |title=Matthew Walker â Awards |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=2008-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Oma Desala''' (&quot;Mother Nature&quot;), played by [[Carla Boudreau]] (season 3) and [[Mel Harris]] (seasons 5, 8) â An Ascended being who goes against the ways of the Ancients. It is unclear if she is an Ancient herself, as the Ancients Orlin and Merlin give different accounts of knowing Oma.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascension&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Quest, Part II&quot;&gt;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest, Part II]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Oma is responsible for once helping the fallen System Lord [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]], the main ''SG-1'' antagonist between seasons 5 through 8, ascend.&lt;ref name=&quot;Threads&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Ancients banished her for her actions, Oma remains convinced of her responsibility to guide those beneath to the &quot;Great Path&quot; of enlightenment, even if this interferes in the lower planes of existence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ascension&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Ascension (Stargate SG-1)|Ascension]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; Oma therefore only guides individuals, leaving the final decision to travel the great path to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Meridian&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Meridian (Stargate SG-1)|Meridian]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; SG-1 first encounters Oma Desala on their search for [[Shifu]] in season 3's &quot;[[Maternal Instinct (Stargate SG-1)|Maternal Instinct]]&quot;. Oma eventually guides Shifu to ascension in season 4's &quot;[[Absolute Power (Stargate SG-1)|Absolute Power]]&quot;. Oma is involved in Daniel Jackson's ascension in &quot;[[Meridian (Stargate SG-1)|Meridian]]&quot; and forceful de-ascension in &quot;[[Fallen (Stargate SG-1)|Fallen]]&quot;, and also helps the entire [[Abydonians (Stargate)|Abydonian]] population ascend after [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]]'s attack in season 6's &quot;[[Full Circle (Stargate SG-1)|Full Circle]]&quot;. Oma Desala last appears in season 8's &quot;[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]&quot;, sacrificing herself to enter an eternal battle with Anubis to prevent him from wreaking further havoc on the galaxy.{{â¢}} Mel Harris's teenage son was a ''Stargate SG-1'' fan and introduced her to the series. The ''Stargate'' producers offered her the part when she was visiting the set visit while in Vancouver for another job. The best direction she got for playing this almost &quot;omniscient&quot; character was that she was not like others and was a &quot;being&quot; of her own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/oma_in_brief.shtml |title=Oma In Brief â GateWorld talks with Mel Harris |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=June |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Orlin''', played by [[Sean Patrick Flanery]] (season 5) and [[Cameron Bright]] (season 9, child) â An outcast Ancient whom SG-1 encounters on the dead planet Velona in season 5's &quot;[[Ascension (Stargate SG-1)|Ascension]]&quot;. He once broke the rules of the Ancients by giving advanced technology to the planet's people, who immediately abused it. After his staying on Earth and developing feelings for Carter, he tries to stop the Earth research of the same weapon and is redeemed and re-ascended by the Ancients. Orlin returns in the form of a human child to retain his Ancient knowledge longer in season 9's &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot; and informs Stargate Command of the feud between Ancients and Ori, and false promises of ascension and religion. He suffers significant brain damage and is eventually interned in a mental institution on Earth.

==Asgard==
{{main|Asgard (Stargate)}}
The '''Asgard''' are a benevolent race that, according to the mythology of ''Stargate'', gave rise to [[Norse mythology]] on Earth and inspired accounts of the [[Roswell, New Mexico|Roswell]] [[grey alien]]s. The Asgard can no longer reproduce and perpetuate themselves by transferring their minds into new clone bodies as necessary. Extremely advanced technologically, the threat of their intervention shields many planets in the Milky Way from [[Goa'uld]] attack, including Earth.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fair Game&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Fair Game|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also provide much assistance to Earth in the way of technology, equipment, and expertise. Their main adversary in ''Stargate SG-1'' are the mechanical [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicators]], against which they enlist the aid of SG-1 on several occasions. The entire Asgard civilization chooses to self-destruct in &quot;[[Unending]]&quot; due to the degenerative effects of repeated cloning. A small colony of Asgard still exist in the Pegasus galaxy that were able to stop cloning diminishing returns. ''Stargate SG-1'' had several Asgard puppets, and six puppeteers are necessary to make the different parts of the main Asgard puppet work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Andy Mikita|Mikita, Andy]] |date =2005 |title=Audio commentary for &quot;[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]&quot; |medium= DVD |publisher=[[MGM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On set, Teryl Rothery (Dr. Frasier) wearing CGI reference gear was the &quot;stand-in&quot; for Thor (&quot;Small Victories&quot; episode 4.1) and Heimdall (&quot;Revelations&quot; episode 5.22) when full motion is required and puppets could not be used.

* {{anchor|Freyr}} '''Freyr''', voiced by [[Brian Jensen (actor)|Brian Jensen]] (season 5) â A member of the Asgard High Council, named after [[Freyr]], the Norse fertility god and god of love. SG-1 first encounters Freyr as a [[Viking]] hologram on the Asgard-protected planet K'Tau in season 5's &quot;[[Red Sky (Stargate SG-1)|Red Sky]]&quot;, but Freyr refuses to help SG-1 to avoid a violation of the Protected Planets Treaty. SG-1 meets Freyr and the Asgard High Council again in &quot;[[Fail Safe (Stargate SG-1)|Fail Safe]]&quot; to save Earth from an approaching asteroid, and again receive no help. Freyr eventually requests SG-1 to rescue one of their scientists in &quot;[[Revelations (Stargate SG-1)|Revelations]]&quot; and protects SG-1, the Asgard scientist Heimdall and his studies with a fleet of three [[O'Neill class battleship]]s.
* {{anchor|Kvasir}} '''Kvasir''', voiced by [[Trevor Devall]] and [[Morris Chapdelaine]] (seasons 9â10) â An Asgard scientist and expert in time-dilation technology. He is named after [[Kvasir]], a Norse god and wisest of the [[Vanir]]. As Thor is busy in the Asgard home galaxy in season 9's &quot;[[Ripple Effect (Stargate SG-1)|Ripple Effect]]&quot;, Kvasir visits Earth in Thor's stead to help Earth fix a problem with alternate realities. Kvasir also assists SG-1 in battling the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] in season 9's &quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot; and helps to repair the transporters of the ''[[Odyssey (Stargate)|Odyssey]]'' in season 10's &quot;[[Flesh and Blood (Stargate SG-1)|Flesh and Blood]]&quot;.
* {{anchor|Thor}} '''[[Thor (Stargate)|Thor]]''', voiced by [[Michael Shanks]] (seasons 1â8, 10) â The Supreme Commander of the Asgard Fleet. SG-1 first encounters Thor as a humanoid [[Viking]] holographic recording on the planet Cimmeria in season 1's &quot;[[Thor's Hammer (Stargate SG-1)|Thor's Hammer]]&quot;, and as his true self in season 2's &quot;[[Thor's Chariot (Stargate SG-1)|Thor's Chariot]]&quot; as he saves Cimmeria from [[Heru-ur (Stargate)|Heru-ur]]'s invasion. Thor remains a recurring character and appears in all following seasons except season 9, risking his life multiple times to save SG-1 and Earth from both the Goa'uld and the Replicators, while SG-1 save him on many occasions from the Replicators and once from [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] (in season 5's &quot;[[Revelations (Stargate SG-1)|Revelations]]&quot;). Thor makes his last appearance in the series finale, &quot;[[Unending (Stargate SG-1)|Unending]]&quot;, leaving SG-1 the entire knowledge of the Asgard race after his race's attempts to solve their genetic difficulties have failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |people=[[Peter DeLuise|DeLuise, Peter]] |date =2005 |title=Audio commentary for &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning (Part 1)]]&quot; |medium= DVD |publisher=[[MGM]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goa'uld==
{{main|Goa'uld|Goa'uld characters in Stargate}}
The '''Goa'uld''' are the dominant race in the Milky Way and the primary adversaries from seasons 1 to 8 of ''Stargate SG-1''. They are a parasitic species that resemble finned snakes, which can burrow themselves into a humanoid's neck and wrap around the spinal column. The Goa'uld symbiote then takes control of its host's body and mind, while providing longevity and perfect health. Thousands of years ago, the Goa'uld ruled over Earth, masquerading as gods from ancient mythologies. They transplanted humans throughout the galaxy to serve as slaves and hosts, and they created the Jaffa to serve as incubators for their larvae. The most powerful Goa'uld in the galaxy are collectively known as the System Lords.

* '''Amonet''' (also spelled '''Amaunet'''), played by [[Vaitiare Bandera]] (seasons 1â3) â See '''[[Sha're]]'''.
* {{anchor|Anubis}} [[File:Anubis Symbol (Stargate).svg|thumb|100px|Anubis' symbol]] '''[[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]]''', played by [[David Palffy]] (seasons 5â7, hooded), [[Dean Aylesworth]] and [[Rik Kiviaho]] (season 8's &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot;), and [[George Dzundza]] (season 8 as &quot;Jim&quot;) â A half-[[Ascension (Stargate)|ascended]] Goa'uld System Lord who replaces [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] as the main enemy in season 5. Based on the god [[Anubis]] of [[Egyptian mythology]], the character is first mentioned in season 5's &quot;[[Between Two Fires (Stargate SG-1)|Between Two Fires]]&quot; and makes his first appearance in &quot;[[Revelations (Stargate SG-1)|Revelations]]&quot;. Earth is eventually able to annihilate Anubis's fleet above Antarctica in &quot;[[Lost City]]&quot;, but Anubis survives in energy form (&quot;[[Lockdown (Stargate SG-1)|Lockdown]]&quot;). Anubis regains his power throughout season 8 and develops a plan to destroy all life in the galaxy and then repopulate it to his own designs (&quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot;). Just as he prepares to use the weapon in &quot;[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]&quot;, [[Oma Desala]], who inadvertently aided in his ascension thousands of years ago, engages him in an eternal battle.{{â¢}} David Palffy was cast to play [[Sokar (Stargate)|Sokar]] before he got the part of Anubis.&lt;ref name=&quot;gw_anubis1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/the_hour_of_anubis_part_1_.shtml |title=The Hour of Anubis (Part 1 of 3) â GateWorld talks with David Palffy |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=July |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since Anubis is cloaked all the time, Palffy had to express the character's weight through the voice and movements. Mainly because of the severe time restraints of filming television, the producers gave Palffy no background on the character and encouraged Palffy to experiment and find the character's tone himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;gw_anubis2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/the_hour_of_anubis_part_2_.shtml |title=The Hour of Anubis (Part 2 of 3) â GateWorld talks with David Palffy |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=July |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; What was under Anubis' cloak became a main question among fandom.&lt;ref name=gw_anubis1 /&gt; Anubis was received as an over-the-top-character,&lt;ref name=gw_anubis2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=anubis3 /&gt; but Palffy pointed to what the character represents, saying &quot;Anubis is a god â he's not fully ascended, he's basically an outcast. And as I say, this resulting displacement of energy that's evil, that has been temporarily harnessed under a hood to give him physical form. He's the image of death, the figure of death incarnate, and he's surrounded by a black robe. That symbol in itself has been around since the dawn of time. That in itself is over the top. [...] His whole existence is basically predicated on living up to that theme, and that's a theme that's time immemorial. And of course, as an actor, you've got to work with that. To do otherwise, to underplay that, will work against the idea of what he represents.&quot;&lt;ref name=anubis3 /&gt; Palffy was open to continue playing Anubis beyond season 7, but other actors played the character in season 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;anubis3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/the_hour_of_anubis_part_3_.shtml |title=The Hour of Anubis (Part 3 of 3) â GateWorld talks with David Palffy |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=July |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{anchor|Apophis}} [[File:Apophis Symbol (Stargate).svg|thumb|100px|Apophis' symbol]] '''[[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]''', played by [[Peter Williams (actor)|Peter Williams]] (seasons 1â6, 8) â A System Lord and the main villain for most of the first four seasons of ''Stargate SG-1''. Based on the god [[Apep]] of [[Egyptian mythology]], the character gained power after [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]]'s death in the film and commands a raid on Earth and [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]] in &quot;[[Children of the Gods]]&quot;. His then-First Prime, Teal'c, defects from his army afterwards. Apophis's standing amongst the System Lords is severely diminishes after a failed full-scale assault on Earth in season 2's &quot;[[The Serpent's Lair (Stargate SG-1)|The Serpent's Lair]]&quot;. After defeating the Goa'uld [[Sokar (Stargate)|Sokar]]'s massive fleet and army in season 3's &quot;[[The Devil You Know (Stargate SG-1)|The Devil You Know]]&quot;, Apophis becomes the most powerful Goa'uld in the galaxy. Despite his death aboard his [[Replicator (Stargate)|Replicator]]-infested ship in season 5's &quot;[[Enemies (Stargate SG-1)|Enemies]]&quot;, Apophis appears in visions and alternate universes in season 6's &quot;[[The Changeling (Stargate SG-1)|The Changeling]]&quot;, season 8's &quot;[[Moebius (Stargate SG-1)|Moebius]]&quot; and ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]''. The astronomers [[David J. Tholen]] and [[Roy A. Tucker]] enjoyed the character so much that they named a [[near-Earth asteroid]] that they co-discovered in 2004, [[99942 Apophis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cooke |first=Bill |url=http://www.astronomy.com/asy/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=3434 |title=Asteroid Apophis set for a makeover |journal=Astronomy Magazine |date=August 18, 2005 |laydate=November 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Anchor|Ba'al|Baal}} [[File:Baal Symbol (Stargate).svg|thumb|100px|Ba'al's symbol]] '''[[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]]''', played by [[Cliff Simon]] (seasons 5â10) â A System Lord based on the [[Baal]] of [[Canaanite religion]]. Introduced in season 5's &quot;[[Summit (Stargate SG-1)|Summit]]&quot; and recurring until the end of the show, he is the longest-running villain in ''Stargate'' history. After Anubis' fleet is destroyed in season 7's &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, Ba'al gains substantial power and wages a war against all other System Lords, driving them to the brink of defeat in early and mid-season 8. Anubis' return in &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot;/&quot;[[Threads (Stargate SG-1)|Threads]]&quot; forces Ba'al back into his service. Ba'al secretly collaborates with SG-1 and [[Jacob Carter|Jacob/Selmak]] to thwart Anubis' plan of overtaking the galaxy with the [[Dakara Superweapon]], but flees when the Jaffa storm his mothership. With his traditional power base gone, Ba'al exiles to Earth and takes over the [[Trust (Stargate)|Trust]], posing as a wealthy businessman in season 9's &quot;[[Ex Deus Machina]]&quot;.

Camulus leaves Earth in &quot;[[Zero Hour (Stargate SG-1)|Zero Hour]]&quot; with a ZPM, in an alleged attempt to assassinate Ba'al. Camulus appears briefly in the alternate timeline of ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'' as one of Ba'al's lieutenants.
* [[File:Cronus Symbol (Stargate).svg|thumb|100px|Cronus' symbol]] '''Cronus''', played by [[Ron Halder]] (seasons 3â4) â A System Lord, named for [[Cronus]] in [[Greek mythology]]. He was the one who banished [[Sokar (Stargate)|Sokar]].

Named for [[Nirrti|{{Unicode|Nirá¹ti}}]] in [[Hindu]] mythology, she is first mentioned in season 1's &quot;[[Singularity (Stargate SG-1)|Singularity]]&quot;, where she wiped out a planet's entire population except for one girl she experimented on, [[Cassandra (Stargate)|Cassandra]]. Nirrti first appears in person in season 3's &quot;[[Fair Game (Stargate SG-1)|Fair Game]]&quot; alongside Cronus and Yu to negotiate Earth's entry into the [[Protected Planets Treaty]], and she is handed over to Cronus after attempting to murder him.

A local eventually rises up and kills her by telekinetically breaking her neck. Nirrti appears briefly in the alternate timeline of ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'' as one of Ba'al's lieutenants.{{â¢}} Jacqueline Samuda played the part as if &quot;Nirrti always has a secret, something up her sleeve that no one else knows, and that's always playing in the subtext. That way she always has the upper hand and is really enjoying it&quot;. She thought of &quot;Nirrti as a scientist and an explorer in a way&quot; who &quot;obviously has an end in mind that is nefarious&quot;. She found Nirrti's subtle sense of humor the most appealing. Samuda pitched the concept of the DNA machine for &quot;Metamorphosis&quot;, its purpose and potential dangers, to the producers, but she did not pitch Nirrti as the Goa'uld who possessed it (co-writer and visual effects producer [[James Tichenor]] did).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/nirrti_on_the_couch.shtml |title=Nirrty On The Couch â GateWorld talks with Jacqueline Samuda |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=January |year=2004 |accessdate=2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A nuclear weapon kills Ra aboard his mothership in [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]]' orbit in the ''Stargate'' film, creating a power vacuum in the galaxy and drawing the attention of the other Goa'uld to Earth as the premise of ''Stargate SG-1''.

During negotiations on Earth against the threat of Ba'al in season 8's {{sgcite|New Order}}, Oshu must speak for Yu to hide Yu's further deteriorated mind from the other present System Lords. Yu is killed by [[Replicator Carter]] in season 8's &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot; as the first act of her invasion of the Milky Way.

The '''Jaffa''' are an offshoot of humanity, genetically engineered by the [[Goa'uld]]. They have an abdominal pouch which serves to incubate larval Goa'uld. The infant Goa'uld provides strength, longevity, and good health, at the cost of supplanting the Jaffa's natural immune system, making them dependent on the Goa'uld for more symbiotes. The Jaffa have a warrior culture and form the armies of the Goa'uld. In season 8 of ''Stargate SG-1'', the [[Jaffa Resistance]] wins their race's freedom from Goa'uld oppression, resulting in the [[Free Jaffa Nation]].

Bra'tac, having been one of the first Jaffa to doubt the Goa'uld as gods, has been an outcast among the Jaffa since at least season 1. Bra'tac was also the one who initially influenced Teal'c to doubt the Goa'uld as well. Bra'tac helps Teal'c and SG-1 on many missions. He is initially suspicious of the humans, particularly O'Neill. This dynamic is played out somewhat comically, but Bra'tac slowly learns to trust and respect humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvzones46_10&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Eramo | first=Steven | author-link= | title=Tony, Tony | journal=[[TV Zone]] | issue=Special #46 | pages=10â11 | year=2002 | date=July 2002 | url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In seasons 1 and 2, Bra'tac helps to save Teal'c's son, [[Rya'c]] from several threats and becomes a guardian to him. During a mission to find the [[Harcesis]] child ([[Shifu (Stargate)|Shifu]]) on Kheb in season 3's &quot;[[Maternal Instinct (Stargate SG-1)|Maternal Instinct]]&quot;, Bra'tac is presented with the idea of [[Ascension (Stargate)|Ascension]] but in the end decides against this possibility for himself. At the end of season 6, Bra'tac and Teal'c are both badly wounded during a Jaffa meeting and lose their symbiotes, surviving only by taking the new drug [[Tretonin]]. Bra'tac is the primary instigator of the [[Jaffa Resistance]], a rebellion aimed at overthrowing the Goa'uld and establishing the freedom of all Jaffa. At the end of season 8, Bra'tac and Teal'c convince the other members of the Jaffa Rebellion to attack [[Dakara]] in an ultimately successful mission. The Jaffa obtain freedom, and Bra'tac receives a position of honor. Bra'tac becomes a member of the High Council, the governing body of the new [[Free Jaffa Nation]] but still stays loyal to Stargate Command. Some time after the destruction of Dakara by the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], leaders of the Free Jaffa Nation meet to consider the future, but Bra'tac and Teal'c are badly injured during an ambush by a former enemy of Teal'c.

Drey'auc remains a loyal follower of [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]] even after Teal'c had defected to Earth. She works diligently to restore Apophis's faith in her and her son so that Rya'c can reach [[puberty]]. Unable to support herself and her son by season 2's &quot;[[Family (Stargate SG-1)|Family]]&quot;, Drey'auc is forced to marry the Jaffa Fro'tak for financial and political security, but Fro'tak betrays them to Apophis when he deduces that she had never stopped loving Teal'c. After Fro'tak's death, she and Rya'c take refuge in the Land of Light and eventually move to a Jaffa rebel camp. Drey'auc's unwillingness to obtain a new symbiote to replace her matured one leads to her death in season 6's &quot;[[Redemption (Stargate SG-1)|Redemption]]&quot;, where Teal'c cremates her.

As the leader of the traditionalist faction, he is the political rival of Teal'c. When Gerak helps SG-1 in thwarting a plan of the Ori to construct a [[Supergate (Stargate)|Supergate]] in &quot;[[Beachhead (Stargate SG-1)|Beachhead]]&quot;, he inadvertently aids the Ori. Gerak's forces are able to capture [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] (later revealed as a clone) in &quot;[[Ex Deus Machina (Stargate SG-1)|Ex Deus Machina]]&quot; and execute him before the Council, scoring a big moral victory for the traditionalists. Although the episode &quot;Origin&quot; outlines Gerak as a firm believer in freedom for all Jaffa and a firm opponent of the [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]], a [[Prior (Stargate)|Prior]] convinces Gerak in mid-season 9's &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot; that Origin should be the goal of all Jaffa.

He collaborates with SG-1 in &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot; to capture a Prior and find a cure against the Prior's plague. Haikon makes his last appearance in &quot;[[Arthur's Mantle (Stargate SG-1)|Arthur's Mantle]]&quot;, where he is severely wounded by an undead Sodan, Vol'nek.

Herak is one the few Jaffa humans under Anubis' command at the end of season 7 who has not been replaced by [[Kull Warrior]]s.

Ishta first appears in &quot;[[Birthright (Stargate SG-1)|Birthright]]&quot; where the Hak'tyl ask Earth for an alliance, and the drug [[Tretonin]] seems like a solution to the Hak'tyl's symbiote problems.

Rya'c grows up under the tutelage of [[Bra'tac]] and is taught the ways of the Jaffa. After Drey'auc's death in season 6's &quot;[[Redemption (Stargate SG-1)|Redemption]]&quot;, Teal'c allows Rya'c to go on his first mission.

Oshu last appears in &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot; and is present when [[Replicator Carter]] stabs Yu to death as part of her invasion of the Milky Way galaxy.
* {{anchor|Yat'Yir}} '''Yat'Yir''', played by [[Gardiner Millar]] (season 9) â A Free Jaffa formerly in the service of Montu and now a member of the Jaffa High Council. Yat'Yir is introduced as a trusted aide of the Jaffa leader [[Gerak]] in &quot;[[Origin (Stargate SG-1)|Origin]]&quot; and personally conducts a raid on Earth to find [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] in &quot;[[Ex Deus Machina]]&quot;. In &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot;, Yat'Yir expresses his concerns about Gerak's Ori proposal and remains a member of the High Council after Gerak's death. Yat'Yir is present for the Jaffa democracy referendum in &quot;[[Stronghold (Stargate SG-1)|Stronghold]]&quot;.

==Lucian Alliance==
{{redirect|Lucian Alliance|characters in Stargate Universe|List of Stargate Universe characters#Recurring Lucian Alliance characters}}
The '''Lucian Alliance''' is an interstellar group of human smugglers and mercenaries that have joined together from many different human-settled worlds across the Milky Way Galaxy to fill the power vacuum created by the demise of the [[Goa'uld]], and have obtained and modified Goa'uld technology for their own use. When their trade partner [[Vala Mal Doran]] does not keep an agreement in their first appearance in season 8's &quot;[[Prometheus Unbound (Stargate SG-1)|Prometheus Unbound]]&quot;, she and Daniel are placed on a Lucian Alliance wanted list. The Lucian Alliance is first referred to by name in season 9's &quot;[[The Ties That Bind (Stargate SG-1)|The Ties That Bind]]&quot; and reappears as a recurring foe in seasons 9 and 10. The Lucian Alliance story arc is continued in ''[[Stargate Universe]]''. Producer [[Joseph Mallozzi]] explained in retrospect, &quot;Much of the Lucian Alliance we saw in ''SG-1'' was inept and, dare I say it, a bit goofy.  They fit in with ''SG-1''{{'}}s lighter, more high adventure-driven tone but would have stood out (and not in a good way) in the new series [''Stargate Universe''].  As a result, I was initially leery at the prospect of introducing them to ''SGU'' but, as so often happened over the course of my many years in the franchise, I trusted in Brad [Wright] and Robert [C. Cooper] and, in the end, that trust was rewarded with a terrific story element that not only succeeded as planned [...] but offered up plenty of interesting story material for future episodes [of ''Stargate Universe'']. The Alliance was always envisioned as a loose coalition of mercenary groups so it made sense that certain factions would have been more capable and threatening than others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph  |authorlink=Joseph Mallozzi  |url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/december-25-2010-christmas-marty-g-and-the-return-of-the-mailbag/ |title=December 25, 2010: Christmas!

* {{anchor|Jup|Tenat|Jup and Tenat}} '''Jup and Tenat''', played by Geoff Redknap and [[Morris Chapdelaine]] (seasons 8â10) â Oranian minor members of the Lucian Alliance who make their first appearance in season 8's &quot;[[Prometheus Unbound (Stargate SG-1)|Prometheus Unbound]]&quot;, aiming to trade a case of weapons-grade-refined [[naqahdah]] to Vala in exchange for the stolen ''[[Prometheus (Stargate)|Prometheus]]''. After Daniel foils the plot, the Alliance sends Jup and Tenat to capture Vala in season 9's &quot;[[The Ties That Bind (Stargate SG-1)|The Ties That Bind]]&quot;, but Mitchell and Teal'c double-cross them. Upon meeting and recognizing Mitchell as a scam artist aboard a Lucian Alliance ship in season 10's &quot;[[Company of Thieves (Stargate SG-1)|Company of Thieves]]&quot;, Tenat asks for a part of the spoils and is double-crossed again, dying in a self-induced firefight against Netan's mothership. Jup last appears in &quot;[[Bounty (Stargate SG-1)|Bounty]]&quot; as one of several bounty hunters attempting the capture of SG-1 on Earth, but another bounty hunter kills him.
* {{anchor|Netan}} '''Netan''', played by [[Eric Steinberg]] (seasons 9â10) â The leader of the Lucian Alliance. He first appears in &quot;[[Off the Grid (Stargate SG-1)|Off the Grid]]&quot;, trying to intercept [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] in stealing Stargates from several planets, including one controlled by the Lucian Alliance. Teal'c approaches the Lucian Alliance for help in attacking the invading [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] battlecruisers in &quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot;, and Netan commits three motherships to the battle. After the big losses during that battle, one of Netan's seconds (Anateo) moves against Netan in season 10's &quot;[[Company of Thieves (Stargate SG-1)|Company of Thieves]]&quot;, but Anateo's skills and a trick by Mitchell lead Netan to declare war on the people of Earth.  SG-1 actually does Netan a favor, killing Anateo for him while retaking the ''Odyssey''. After SG-1 makes raids on Lucian Alliance assets in &quot;[[Bounty (Stargate SG-1)|Bounty]]&quot;, Netan places a bounty on the heads of SG-1 and is implied to die at the hands of another bounty hunter himself when the hunters fail.

==Ori==
{{main|Ori (Stargate)}}
The '''Ori''' are Ascended beings who use their infinite knowledge of the universe to force lesser beings to worship them. In essence, they used to be Ancients, however they split into separate groups due to different views of life. The Ori are religious while the Ancients prefer science. The Ori sway lesser-developed planets into worshipping them by promising Ascension through an invented and empty religion called &quot;Origin&quot;. This religion states that they created humanity and as such are to be worshipped by their creations. It also promises its followers that, on death, they will Ascend. However, Origin was designed to channel energy from the human worshippers to the Ori. As such, the Ori never help anyone else Ascend because then they would have to share the power that they sap from their worshippers. Their ultimate goal is to completely destroy the Ascended Ancients, who they know as &quot;the Others&quot;. All of their efforts, including their technology, are for the purpose of garnering worshippers. As Ascended beings, the Ori do not interfere directly in the mortal plane. Instead, they use humans called [[Prior (Stargate)|Priors]], which they artificially evolve so that they are one step from Ascension, giving the Priors godly powers. Because the Ori have worshippers across the entire home galaxy of the Ancients, and using their knowledge to spread, they are nearly unstoppable.

* {{anchor|Adria}} [[File:Morena Baccarin 2005 flanvention 1.jpg|thumb|[[Morena Baccarin]] played Adria the Orici.]] '''[[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]]''', played by [[Robert C.

Adria is the '''Orici''', a genetically advanced human infused with Ori knowledge. The Ori had impregnated [[Vala Mal Doran]] with Adria against her will in season 9 to circumvent the Ancients' rules in the [[Milky Way galaxy]], and as such Vala named the child after her &quot;witch of a woman&quot; stepmother. Losing contact with young Adria in &quot;[[Flesh and Blood (Stargate SG-1)|Flesh and Blood]]&quot;, Vala meets her daughter again as an adult in &quot;[[Counterstrike (Stargate SG-1)|Counterstrike]]&quot;. In &quot;The Quest&quot;, Adria tricks SG-1 into obtaining the [[Sangraal (Stargate)|Sangraal]] for her and captures Daniel before he can complete the device. Adria attempts to convert Daniel to the path of [[Origin (Stargate)|Origin]] and makes him a Prior, but he betrays her in &quot;[[The Shroud (Stargate SG-1)|The Shroud]]&quot; and uses the weapon on the Ori galaxy. Adria is briefly implanted with the Go'auld [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]] in &quot;[[Dominion (Stargate SG-1)|Dominion]]&quot;, but the removal of the symbiote almost kills Adria and she ascends. She nevertheless continues the Ori's assault on the Milky Way in ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'', where the Ancient [[Morgan le Fay (Stargate)|Morgan le Fay]] engages her in an ascended battle, &quot;eternally distracting her from being able to continue her evil ways&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;mythmaker2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Sumner |first=Darren |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/myth_maker_part_2.shtml |title=Myth Maker, Part Two â GateWorld talks with Robert C.

As a reward for fulfilling his duties and putting Vala through a Trial by Fire, he is transformed into a Prior in &quot;[[Origin (Stargate SG-1)|Origin]]&quot;. He is later sent to the Milky Way and appears in &quot;[[The Powers That Be (Stargate SG-1)|The Powers That Be]]&quot; unleashing a plague in a defiant village, in &quot;[[The Fourth Horseman (Stargate SG-1)|The Fourth Horseman]]&quot; turning [[Gerak]] into a Prior, and in season 10's &quot;[[Line in the Sand (Stargate SG-1)|Line in the Sand]]&quot; ordering the destruction of a village by spaceship. He is killed by SG-1 in ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]''.
* {{anchor|Prior}} '''Prior''', played by [[Doug Abrahams]] (seasons 9â10) â A one-eyed Prior introduced in &quot;[[Crusade (Stargate SG-1)|Crusade]]&quot;, who cures Tomin of his limp and later informs him of being unable to father children. He is on-board one of the [[Ori battlecruiser]]s invading the Milky Way in &quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot; and is present during [[Adria (Stargate)|Adria]]'s birth in season 10's &quot;[[Flesh and Blood (Stargate SG-1)|Flesh and Blood]]&quot;, informing Vala and Tomin of her divine purpose. In &quot;[[The Quest (Stargate SG-1)|The Quest]]&quot;, he accompanies Adria in the search of the [[Sangraal (Stargate)]]. He is captured in ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' and exposed to the Ark, thus stopping to believe in the power of the Ori.
* {{anchor|Tomin}} '''Tomin''', played by [[Tim Guinee]] (seasons 9â10) â A devout [[Ori (Stargate)|Ori]] follower of the village of Ver Isca, who becomes an Ori commander in Season 10.

Tomin had been crippled since childhood, and was therefore looked down on by his fellow villagers. Tomin married Vala and accepted her pregnancy as his child, not knowing that it was an immaculate conception set by the Ori. A little later, a Prior visited the village and cured Tomin of his limp, allowing him to become a warrior for the Ori. The prior also told Tomin the truth about the child as &quot;the will of the Ori&quot;, who would later be the [[Orici]]. Tomin is later able to forgive Vala.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crusade&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Crusade (Stargate SG-1)|Crusade]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; As seen in &quot;[[Camelot (Stargate SG-1)|Camelot]]&quot;, Tomin and Vala depart aboard the first wave of Ori vessels entering the Milky Way, and they go separate ways in season 10's &quot;[[Flesh and Blood (Stargate SG-1)|Flesh and Blood]]&quot;. Tomin rises to the rank of commander within the Ori warrior armies, and he and Vala meet again in &quot;[[Line in the Sand (Stargate SG-1)|Line in the Sand]]&quot;. Because a Prior twists the words of the Book of Origin, Tomin begins to doubt the Priors and their interpretations of Origin's teachings, and helps Vala escape. Tomin helps with the final Ori defeat in the film ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'', in which, after seeing a Prior's death with his own eyes, he learns the truth about the Ori.

==Replicators==
{{main|Replicator (Stargate)}}
The '''Replicators''' are a potent mechanical life-form using a quiron-based technology composed of building blocks using [[nanotechnology]]. They strive to increase their numbers and spread across the universe by assimilating advanced technologies. They are hostile to all other life-forms in the universe, but are opposed primarily by the Asgard. In the episode &quot;[[Unnatural Selection (Stargate SG-1)|Unnatural Selection]]&quot;, the Replicators had developed human-form Replicators, based on the technology they extracted from their Android creator, that appear just like humans and are able to change their form. Standard Replicators are resistant to energy weapons, and can only be destroyed by projectile weapons. Human-form Replicators, on the other hand, are resistant to projectile weapons as well due to the change in their nature from large blocks to smaller units the size of organic cells (cell blocks). In the episode &quot;[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order (Part 2)]]&quot;, an [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancient]] weapon called the Replicator Disruptor was developed by O'Neill while he still had the knowledge of the Ancients in his mind. It works by blocking the cohesion between the blocks that make up the Replicators. The Replicators in the Milky Way galaxy were wiped out by the [[Dakara Superweapon]] in the two-part episode &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot; at the climax of Season 8. It has been indicated that the Asgard used the same technology to defeat the Replicators in their own home galaxy as well.

* {{anchor|Fifth}} '''Fifth''', played by [[Patrick Currie]] (seasons 6, 8) â A human-form Replicator introduced in season 6's &quot;[[Unnatural Selection (Stargate SG-1)|Unnatural Selection]]&quot;. He is the fifth human-form to be created on the Asgard planet Halla, and unlike the others he lacks the programming flaws of the android [[Reese (Stargate)|Reese]], on which the human-forms are based. This makes him more &quot;human&quot; than the other Replicators, who consider him &quot;weak&quot; as a result. After SG-1 is captured by the Replicators, Fifth becomes fascinated by them, especially Carter, and attempts to help them, but SG-1 break their promise and leave Fifth behind in a time dilatation field. Fifth has escaped the time dilation field in the season 8 episode &quot;[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]&quot;, and en route to the new Asgard homeworld of Orilla, he captures Samantha Carter and tortures her in revenge. He eventually relents when she appeals to his humanity again, and professes his love for her. He lets Carter go but creates a Replicator duplicate of her to serve as his consort. Fifth appears for the last time in &quot;[[Gemini (Stargate SG-1)|Gemini]]&quot;, conspiring with Replicator Carter to obtain data from the SGC that would immunize them from the Replicator Disruptor. Replicator Carter however never returned his feelings, believing him unfit to command the Replicators. She ultimately betrays him, taking the data for herself while manipulating him into being destroyed by the Disruptor.{{â¢}} Patrick Currie had auditioned for the show since the very beginning, resulting in approximately 15 auditions before being cast, according to Currie because the producers always short-listed him and waited for the perfect episode to use him in. When preparing for the role of Fifth, Currie was unsure where to take the innocence and vulnerability of the character, and later figured that the key to this character is to know &quot;what it's like before we learn to play games and pretend&quot;. He thinks Fifth is a misunderstood character and not a villain; Fifth believes to love Carter, but lacks comparisons.&lt;ref name=&quot;gw_fifthunleashed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Read |first=David |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/fifth_unleashed.shtml |title=Fifth Unleashed â GateWorld talks with Patrick Currie |publisher=[[GateWorld]] |month=January |year=2005 |accessdate=2008-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Anchor|Replicator Carter|RepliCarter|Replicator}} '''Replicator Carter''' (also known as '''RepliCarter'''), played by [[Amanda Tapping]] (season 8) â A human-form Replicator created by Fifth. She first appears at the end of &quot;[[New Order (Stargate SG-1)|New Order]]&quot;, and becomes a major adversary in the eighth season of the series. Fifth intended her to be a duplicate of the real Samantha Carter, but one who would return his affections. Replicator Carter seemingly defects from Fifth to the SGC in &quot;[[Gemini (Stargate SG-1)|Gemini]]&quot;, but in fact abandons him to be destroyed while she develops a means to immunize herself from the Replicator Disruptor. In &quot;[[Reckoning (Stargate SG-1)|Reckoning]]&quot;, Replicator Carter launches a full-scale invasion of the Milky Way and personally eliminates the last of the [[Goa'uld]] [[System Lord]]s. She abducts Daniel and probes his mind to find the location of the [[Dakara superweapon]], the only thing in the galaxy capable of stopping her. She also sends Replicators to fight the forces of [[Ba'al (Stargate)|Ba'al]], the [[Jaffa Rebellion]], and Stargate Command on Earth. Daniel Jackson is able to exploit his connection to the Replicator network at a critical moment, buying enough time to finish calibrating and activating the Dakara weapon. The resulting energy wave breaks Replicator Carter and all her brethren into their constituent parts.

==Tok'ra==
{{main|Tok'ra}}
The '''Tok'ra''' (literally &quot;against [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]]&quot;, the Supreme System Lord) are a faction of Goa'uld symbiotes who are opposed to the Goa'uld culturally and militarily. Spawned by the queen Egeria, they live in true symbiosis with their hosts, both beings sharing the body equally and benefitting from each other. The Tok'ra have fought the Goa'uld for thousands of years, favoring covert tactics and balancing the various System Lords against one another. Since season 2 of ''Stargate SG-1'', the Tok'ra have become valuable allies of Earth.

* {{anchor|Aldwin}} '''Aldwin''', played by [[William deVry]] (seasons 3â5) â A Tok'ra introduced in season 3's &quot;[[The Devil You Know (Stargate SG-1)|The Devil You Know]]&quot; to aid SG-1 on a mission to rescue [[Jacob Carter]] from [[Sokar (Stargate)|Sokar]]'s prison moon Ne'tu. In season 4's &quot;[[Absolute Power (Stargate SG-1)|Absolute Power]]&quot;, Aldwin is sent to the SGC to verify via a [[zatarc]]-detecting device that [[Shifu (Stargate)|Shifu]] is indeed the supposed Harcesis. Alwin is killed in season 5's &quot;[[Summit (Stargate SG-1)|Summit]]&quot;//&quot;[[Last Stand (Stargate SG-1)|Last Stand]]&quot; when [[Zipacna (Stargate)|Zipacna]] attacks the planet Revanna where Aldwin guided SG-17 through the Tok'ra base.
* {{Anchor|Anise|Freya}} '''Anise''', played by [[Vanessa Angel]] (season 4) â A gifted scientist and historian whose human host '''Freya''' is attracted to Jack O'Neill, although the symbiote prefers Daniel Jackson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Divide and Conquer&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Divide and Conquer (Stargate SG-1)|Divide and Conquer]]&quot; (''[[Stargate SG-1]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; She is introduced in season 4's &quot;[[Upgrades (Stargate SG-1)|Upgrades]]&quot;, researching the Atanik armbands on SG-1 in the hope to use the armbands' powers on a dangerous SG-1 mission to destroy [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]' new prototype mothership. Anise is present for [[Tanith (Stargate)|Tanith]]'s introduction in &quot;[[Crossroads (Stargate SG-1)|Crossroads]]&quot;, and assists Stargate Command in &quot;[[Divide and Conquer (Stargate SG-1)|Divide and Conquer]]&quot; to uncover possible [[Zatarc]]s within the SGC ranks. She improperly diagnoses O'Neill and Carter, who unwittingly lied during the test to conceal their feelings for each other.
* {{anchor|Jolinar|Jolinar of Malkshur}} '''Jolinar of Malkshur''', played by [[Amanda Tapping]] (season 2) and [[Tanya Reid]] (season 3 as Rosha) â Tok'ra symbiote of '''Rosha''' and temporarily '''[[Samantha Carter]]'''. The symbiote is severely injured by an ash'rak, a Goa'uld assassin, and died saving her host's life.
* {{Anchor|Martouf|Lantash}} '''Martouf''', played by [[JR Bourne]] (seasons 2â4, 9) â A leader in the ranks of the Tok'ra. Martouf had been the mate of Rosha, host to [[Jolinar]], for almost a century. SG-1 first meet Martouf during their first encounter with the Tok'ra in season 2's &quot;[[The Tok'ra (Stargate SG-1)|The Tok'ra]]&quot;, and since Jolinar was once blended with Samantha Carter, Martouf develops an interest in her. Some episodes later in &quot;[[Serpent's Song (Stargate SG-1)|Serpent's Song]]&quot;, Martouf recommends that [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]], who sought asylum at the SGC, should be handed over to [[Sokar (Stargate)|Sokar]]. In the season 3 two-parter &quot;[[Jolinar's Memories (Stargate SG-1)|Jolinar's Memories]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Devil You Know (Stargate SG-1)|The Devil You Know]]&quot;, Martouf joins SG-1 on a mission to rescue [[Jacob Carter]], the host of the Tok'ra Selmak, from [[Ne'tu]]. They are captured and tortured, but Martouf, Selmak and SG-1 can escape when a new Tok'ra weapon destroys Ne'tu. However, Martouf is unwittingly subjected to Goa'uld mind control, turning him into a [[zatarc]]. His attempt to assassinate the President of the United States in season 4's &quot;[[Divide and Conquer (Stargate SG-1)|Divide and Conquer]]&quot; ends in failure, and Carter is forced to kill him. Martouf's symbiote, '''Lantash''', survives and is placed in a Tok'ra stasis chamber, which is destroyed in a Goa'uld attack in season 5's &quot;[[Last Stand (Stargate SG-1)|Last Stand]]&quot;. The new SGC recruit '''Lieutenant Elliot''' blends with Lantash after a severe injury, but they give their lives to save the rest of SG-1 and the Tok'ra, eliminating the entire Goa'uld invasion force with a vial of symbiote poison. An alternate version of Martouf arrives at the SGC when many SG-1s from alternate realities start coming through the Stargate in season 9's &quot;[[Ripple Effect (Stargate SG-1)|Ripple Effect]]&quot;. That universe's Martouf had joined the SGC to be closer to Carter, but their relationship did not last.
* {{anchor|Ren'al}} '''Ren'al''', played by [[Jennifer Calvert]] â A member of the Tok'ra High Council. In {{sgcite|Enemies}}, she travels to Earth to inform General Hammond that, though their plan to destroy [[Apophis (Stargate)|Apophis]]' fleet was successful, no trace of SG-1 or Jacob/Selmak has been found. In {{sgcite|Summit}}, Ren'al briefs the SGC on an upcoming summit of the [[Goa'uld]] [[System Lord]]s and the Tok'ra plan to assassinate them using symbiote poison.

Other Tok'ra seen include Garshaw of Belote and Persus.

==Tollan==
The '''Tollan''' are an advanced human civilization who are introduced in season 1's &quot;[[Enigma (Stargate SG-1)|Enigma]]&quot; when the SGC helps a group of them relocate from the original Tollan homeworld that had undergone catastrophic volcanic activity. The [[Nox (Stargate)|Nox]] take the Tollan in while they continue to search for a new home, later revealed to be named Tollana. The Tollan have a strict policy against sharing technology with more &quot;primitive&quot; races, instituted after such a transfer caused the civilization of their neighboring planet Serita to destroy itself in a single day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Enigma&quot;&gt;{{sgcite|Enigma|show=ref}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teal'c notes in season 3's &quot;[[Pretense (Stargate SG-1)|Pretense]]&quot; that despite the Tollans' technological superiority, they &quot;do not think strategically&quot;. The Tollan are wiped out by the forces of the Goa'uld [[Tanith (Stargate)|Tanith]] in season 5's &quot;[[Between Two Fires (Stargate SG-1)|Between Two Fires]]&quot; after the Goa'uld [[Anubis (Stargate)|Anubis]] developed shields impervious to Tollan weaponry.

* {{anchor|Narim}} '''Narim''', played by [[Garwin Sanford]] (seasons 1, 3, 5) â An influential Tollan who befriends SG-1 after they save him and a group of fellow Tollans in &quot;[[Enigma (Stargate SG-1)|Enigma]]&quot;.

Director [[Peter DeLuise]] told Currie to follow Dion's lead but to add his own spin to the character.
