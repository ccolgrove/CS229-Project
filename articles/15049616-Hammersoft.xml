This is a list of [[albums]] for the [[anime]] [[OVA]] series ''[[Macross Plus]]''.  The series has been described as needing &quot;an extremely strong score to support the plot about the rise of a popular singing idol who turns out to be a computer generated [[Artificial Intelligence]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Patten|title=Watching Anime, Reading Manga: 25 Years of Essays and Reviews| year=2004| pages= 357}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is none other than [[Sharon Apple]], whose music itself is featured in the series.  There are four albums: two soundtracks and two albums featuring the songs of Sharon Apple.  All four albums were first released in [[Japan]] beginning in October 1994 up through November 1995.  ''Macross Plus Soundtrack'' and ''Macross Plus Soundtrack II'' have also been released in the [[United States]] by [[AnimeTrax]].

''Macross Plus'' features the work of renowned Japanese musician and composer [[Yoko Kanno]].  While ''[[Please Save My Earth]]'' was the first anime series that she composed for, her work on ''Macross Plus'' has tended to overshadow the former.  Kanno's ''Macross Plus'' compositions have been described as seeming &quot;to be written in a far future or a distant galaxy,&quot; yet still retain their listener appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Drazen|title=Anime Explosion!: The What? Why? &amp; Wow! of Japanese Animation| year=2003| pages= 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Kanno has stated that several of the songs such as &quot;SANTI-U&quot; and &quot;Pulse&quot; do not feature actual languages, but rather sound like them.  She has also described ''Macross Plus'' executive director [[Shoji Kawamori]] as not being very detailed when it came to musical instruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher = |title = VOICES - An Exclusive Interview with Kanno Yoko |work = EX: The Online World of Anime &amp; Manga |year = 2001 |url = http://www.ex.org/4.5/16-interview_kanno1.html |accessdate = 2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
