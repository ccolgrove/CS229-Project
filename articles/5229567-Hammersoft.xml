'''MY ''Ady Gil''''' (formerly '''''Earthrace''''') was a {{Convert|78|ft|adj=on}}, [[wave-piercing]] [[trimaran]], which was originally created as part of a project to break the world record for [[circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the globe in a powerboat. The vessel was powered by [[biodiesel]] fuel, but was also capable of running on regular diesel fuel.&lt;ref name=Future_things&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutureofthings.com/pod/1258/earthrace-setting-a-new-world-record.html|title=Earthrace: Setting a new world record|author=Noa Rotkop|publisher=The Future of Things|date=September 10, 2008|accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics 2007-06&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.popularmechanics.co.za/content/outside/singlepage.asp?fid=871&amp;pno=1|title=Earthrace!|date=June 2007|journal=[[Popular Mechanics]]|publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pop-sci-dec-2006-pg18&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Seiff|first1=Abby|title=Fast Fueled|journal=[[Popular Science]]|publisher=[[Bonnier Group]]|volume=269|issue=6|year=2006|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It used other eco-friendly materials, such as vegetable oil lubricants, hemp composites, and non-toxic [[anti-fouling]], and had features such as bilge water filters.&lt;ref name=Future_things/&gt;

The first attempt at the global circumnavigation record in 2007 was ill-fated. The boat several times encountered mechanical problems, and collided with a [[Guatemala]]n fishing boat, killing one of the other boat's crew. While the crew of the ''Earthrace'' was later absolved of any responsibility,{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} the delay forced the restart of the record attempt, while more mechanical issues later aborted it. In 2008, the second journey proved successful&amp;mdash;though again, numerous technical problems had to be overcome before the record was achieved, with the vessel finally making the return to Sagunto, Spain after just under 61 days on June 27, 2008.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

In late 2009, it was announced that the boat, now repainted black and named ''Ady Gil'', would be participating in anti-[[whaling]] operations under the lead of the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]]. During operations in the [[Southern Ocean]], the vessel and the Japanese whaling support vessel {{MV|ShÅnan Maru 2}} collided on January 6, 2010, resulting in loss of the ''Ady Gil'''s bow and one injured crew member.&lt;ref name=&quot;f1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,582115,00.html|title=Whale Wars: Boat Sinking After Antarctic Clash|date=January 6, 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|publisher=[[News Corporation]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first1=Rohan|last1=Sullivan|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/world/AP/story/1411346.html|title=Boat sinking after whaling clash in Antarctica|date=January 6, 2010|agency=[[Associated Press]]|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]|publisher=[[Miami Herald]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;f3&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first1=Kelly|last1=Burgess|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/outposts/2010/01/sea-shepherd-vessel-ady-gil-has-bow-sheared-off-after-being-struck-by-japanese-whaling-vessel.html|title=Sea Shepherd vessel Ady Gil has bow sheared off after being struck by Japanese whaling ship|date=January 6, 2010|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=January 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each side blamed the other for causing the collision, and government agencies are investigating the incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;RESTRAINT&quot;/&gt; The crew of the ''Ady Gil'' were taken off&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTSUNK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;STILLABANDONED&quot;/&gt; and the salvage operation was abandoned. The vessel was reported as sinking on January 7, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;SUNK&quot;&gt;ABC News, January 8, 2010, [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/01/08/2787921.htm Ady Gil sinks after whaling skirmish]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design ==
The vessel was designed by [[LOMOcean Design]] (formerly [[Craig Loomes Design Group Ltd.]]) and built by [[Calibre Boats]] in [[Auckland]], [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seabreeze.com.au/News/Power%20Boats/Earthrace-around-the-world-in-60-days_2162526.aspx 'Earthrace' - around the world in 60 days]&lt;/ref&gt; The wave-piercing trimaran design allowed for improved speed and stability. The boat was fully submersible, able to cut through {{Convert|15|m|ft|0|adj=on}} waves and go {{Convert|7|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} underwater.&lt;ref name=Future_things/&gt; The hull was composed of a composite carbon fibre and kevlar with a non-toxic [[Biofouling#Anti-fouling|anti-fouling]] paint.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics 2007-06&quot; /&gt;

The vessel was powered by two 540&amp;nbsp;[[horsepower]] [[Cummins]] [[Mercury Marine|Mercruiser]] engines that ran on an animal fat and vegetable oil mix [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pop-sci-dec-2006-pg18&quot; /&gt; It could be run on diesel, biodiesel or blends. To cool and provide fresh air to the engines, [[intake]]s were located on two dramatic [[fin]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.northernadvocate.co.nz/local/news/silver-butterfly-spreads-its-wings/3682101/|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Silver butterfly spreads its wings|last=Powley|first=Kathryn|date=April 27, 2006|newspaper=[[The Northern Advocate]]|publisher=[[APN News &amp; Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Ady Gil'''s twin propellers were mounted under the main hull, while the rudders were mounted in the pontoons. This design provided good turning at speed, but limited maneuverability at speeds below 12 knots.&lt;ref name=MNZREPORT/&gt; Despite its design as an &quot;eco-boat&quot;, [[David J. C. MacKay|David MacKay]] calculates that it has significantly greater energy consumption per passenger-kilometre than a jet-ski or the [[RMS Queen Elizabeth 2|''QE2'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Mackay|first=David|author-link=David J.

== Record attempts ==

''Earthrace'' was intended to showcase environmentally friendly technologies. It broke the world record for [[circumnavigation|circumnavigating]] the globe in a [[Motorboat|motorized boat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pop-sci-dec-2006-pg18&quot; /&gt; It set the record in 60 days 23 hours and 49 minutes. This beat the record set by the ''[[Cable and Wireless Adventurer]]'' (then the ''[[Ocean 7 Adventurer]]'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Avatar pilot turns sights in whalers|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/avatar-pilot-turns-sights-in-whalers-20101123-184xw.html|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=November 23, 2010|first=Andrew|last=Darby}}&lt;/ref&gt; by 13 days 21 hours and 9 minutes.

However, the time is still behind ''[[Groupama 3]]'s'' overall world record of 48 days, 7 hours 44 minutes and 52 seconds, which was achieved under sails instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics 2007-06&quot; /&gt;  Also, the [[U.S. Navy]] [[nuclear submarine|nuclear-powered submarine]] [[USS Triton (SSRN-586)|USS ''Triton'']] completed the first submerged circumnavigation of the world in 60 days 21 minutes, from February 24-April 25, 1960, covering {{convert|26723|nmi|km mi}} at the average speed of {{convert|18|kn|km/h mph}} non-stop.&lt;ref&gt;''Around the World Submerged: The Voyage of the Triton'' by [[Edward L. Beach, Jr.|Captain Edward L. Beach, USN]] (1962), data sheet appendix&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2007 ===
The attempt originally departed from [[Barbados]] on March 10, 2007 but encountered significant delays including problems with the propellers and other mechanical issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ Herald 2007-06-03&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10443330|title=Earthrace highlights green cause|last=Griffin|first=Peter|date=June 3, 2007|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=March 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A problem with an engine off [[Palau]] caused an 8-day delay because of the remoteness.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earthrace 9 May press release&quot;&gt;{{Cite press|url=http://earthrace.net/index.php?action=view_article&amp;id=34&amp;module=articlemodule&amp;src=%40random456b8bd73bbc2|title=Earthrace press release|date=May 9, 2007|publisher=Earthrace}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of March 19, 2007, while around {{Convert|22|km|mi|0}} offshore from [[Guatemala]], ''Earthrace'' collided with a local fishing boat.

They departed San Diego on April 7, 2007 and needed to return by June 21 to break the record.&lt;ref name=&quot;Earthrace 9 May press release&quot; /&gt; However, the attempt was abandoned on May 31, 2007 after a crack was discovered in the hull shortly after leaving [[Malaga]], [[Spain]].&lt;ref name=&quot;31 may press release&quot;&gt;{{Cite press|url=http://www.earthrace.net/index.php?action=view_article&amp;id=39&amp;module=articlemodule&amp;src=%40random456b8bd73bbc2|title=Earthrace Forced to Abandon Record Attempt|date=May 31, 2007|publisher=Earthrace}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The biofuel came from a wide range of suppliers and was derived from various cash crops. Bethune reluctantly had to fall back on conventional diesel once due to a lack of availability.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ Herald 2007-06-03&quot;/&gt;

=== 2008 ===

After a refit at the Vulkan Shipyard at the Port of [[Sagunto]], a second attempt on the record began at 14:35 (CET) on April 27, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press|url=http://www.earthrace.net/index.php?section=65|title=Captain's blog|publisher=Earthrace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/4497145a7693.html|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Biofuelled boat ready to resume challenge|agency=[[The Dominion Post (Wellington)|The Dominion Post]]|newspaper=[[stuff.co.nz]]|publisher=[[Fairfax New Zealand]]|date=April 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mby.com/auto/newsdesk/20080316104952mbynews.html|accessdate=January 6, 2010|title=Earthrace will be at British Motor Show| work=Motor Boat &amp; Yachting |publisher=[[IPC Media]]|date=April 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On board were Rob Drewett (cameraman), Adam Carlson (navigator), Mark Russel (engineer) and Bethune (skipper/owner).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthrace.net/index.php?section=33 Boat Crew: Pete Bethune - Skipper] (from the 'Earthrace.net' website. Retrieved 2010-01-11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The route for the second world record attempt and estimated time for each leg was as follows:

* Sagunto, Spain â Azores: 3 days
* Azores - Puerto Rico: 3 days
* Puerto Rico - Panama: 3 days
* Panama Manzanillo (Mexico): 3 days
* Manzanillo - San Diego: 3 days.
* San Diego - Hawaii: 5 days
* Hawaii - Majuro (Marshall Islands): 5 days
* Majuro - Koror (Palau): 5 days
* Palau - Singapore: 5 days
* Singapore - Cochin (India): 5 days
* Cochin - Salalah (Oman): 4 days
* Salalah - Suez Canal (Egypt): 4 days
* Suez Canal - Sagunto (Spain): 4 days

The boat experienced problems with the autopilot two days after departure, and then on April 30 the lift pump of the starboard engine became blocked. However, although some time was lost, the boat arrived at the Azores slightly ahead of schedule for the world record attempt and with all technical problems apparently solved.

The next two legs went without any major problems and the crew managed to bypass a big backlog of ships in the Panama Canal. On day 22 about half way to Hawaii, a severe vibration caused them to stop and after Bethune went under the boat in the dark with a torch to investigate, he discovered that some nylon netting was entangled in the one prop and had to be removed.

Shortly after leaving Palau on day 34, ''Earthrace'' struck submerged debris which sheared two blades off the port propeller and bent the drive shaft. This necessitated a return to Palau in order to assess the damage and remove the prop. The boat then continued to Singapore on one engine, while plans were set in motion to manufacture a new drive shaft and obtain another propeller. Once in Singapore, ''Earthrace'' was hoisted from the water in a sling and repairs were effected on the dockside in record time.

On day 48 the crew were suffering from heat and high humidity and were all affected by heat rash. At this time they had also encountered monsoon weather and their speed was much reduced due to mountainous waves. The heavy seas continued all the way to Oman and beyond before entering the Red Sea. During this stretch the boat's transponder was damaged and the marine tracker stopped working. On day 56, en route to Port Suez, the lift pump malfunctioned, limiting their speed to 16 knots. This required three hours worth of maintenance to change it.

On Friday June 27, 2008 ''Earthrace'' set a new world record for powered circumnavigation of the globe, when it crossed the finish line at 14:24 CET at Sagunto, Spain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popular Mechanics 2007-06&quot; /&gt;

===Participation in 'Waltzing Matilda' ===
{{Main|Sea Shepherd Conservation Society operations#Operation Waltzing Matilda (2009-2010)| l1=Sea Shepherd Conservation Society operations}}

It was announced that the ''Earthrace'' would accompany [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society|Sea Shepherd]] in its 2009-10 operations (named '[[Waltzing Matilda]]') against [[Whaling in Japan|Japanese whaling]] in the [[Southern Ocean Whale Sanctuary]]. Bethune said that an agreement was reached with Sea Shepherd for the boat to adopt a support role.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age 2009-06-29&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/06/29/2611001.htm|title=Futuristic boat to join whale protest|date=June 29, 2009|work=The Age|accessdate=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea Shepherd noted that the vessel had been the only one in the fleet fast enough to keep up with all vessels of the Japanese whaling fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;FUNDRAISER&quot;/&gt;

On October 17, 2009, the ''Earthrace'' was presented to the media with a new black paint job, and it was re-named ''Ady Gil'', after the name of a major sponsor (a Hollywood lighting-equipment magnate who had donated $1 million to the group).&lt;ref name=&quot;DOWNED&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article6982236.ece|title=Ady Gil downed by Japanese whalers|date=January 10, 2010|work=[[The Sunday Times]]|accessdate=2010-01-10 | location=London | first=Peter | last=Millar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new paint job and futuristic appearance of the boat itself often evoked comparisons to [[Batman]] vehicles and [[stealth ship|stealth craft]]s in the media.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIONEER&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title= Whaling Protesters Pioneer Non-lethal Warfare| work= Wired| date= 2010-01-15| url= http://www.wired.com/dangerroom/2010/01/whaling-protesters-pioneer-non-lethal-warfare/| accessdate= 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;STREET FIGHT&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title= Street Fight on the High Seas| publisher= [[The New Yorker]]| date= 2010-01-12| url= http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/newsdesk/2010/01/sea-shepherd.html | accessdate= 2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

4-8 layers of  [[Kevlar]] were added to protect the hull against ice with the thickness depending on the location, with all areas under the waterline getting the extra laminations of kevlar as well as some areas above the waterline.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transformation&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ecorazzi.com/2009/08/28/exclusive-the-earthrace-begins-a-sea-shepherd-transformation/|title=Exclusive: The Earthrace Begins A Sea Shepherd Transformation|last=d'Estries|first=Michael|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=15 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; To reduce its [[radar cross-section|radar profile]] for the Japanese fleet, the ship was painted with a paint intended to scatter radar signals and a [[FMCW#Availability to recreational boat users|broadband radar]] which has near-zero radar emissions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transformation&quot;/&gt; Despite being referred to as a stealth craft, the ''Ady Gil'' lacks the angles and curvature of form designed to deflect radar away from the emitter rather than back to them.&lt;ref name=&quot;How stealth works&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.howstuffworks.com/question69.htm|title=How does stealth technology work?|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other electronics upgrades included [[FLIR]] cameras, [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]] satellite communications as well as an array of speakers which were intended for communication purposes. Bethune said that he intended to play songs like ''[[Tangaroa]]'' from New Zealand musician [[Tiki Taane]] to the whalers, a &quot;growling big sort of a song about the God of the Sea who looks after us&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Transformation&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wail for whales&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/wail-for-whales-stealth-boat-to-blast-japanese-20091130-k18l.html|title=Wail for whales: stealth boat to blast Japanese|date=June 29, 2009|work=The Age|accessdate=November 30, 2009 | location=Melbourne | first=Andrew | last=Darby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sea Shepherd crew said before the journey that ''Ady Gil'' would not be used as a confrontational vessel like the ''Steve Irwin''.&lt;ref name=&quot;SECRET&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.3news.co.nz/Earthrace-the-new-weapon-against-whaling/tabid/423/articleID/125767/cat/64/Default.aspx|title=Earthrace: the new weapon against whaling|date=October 16, 2009|work=New Zealand TV3|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sea Shepherd leader [[Paul Watson]], President of the Sea Shepherd Conservation Society, later stated in October 2009 that with a top speed of 50 knots, the vessel would be used to intercept [[harpoon]] ships and physically block them from harpooning whales, allowing Sea Shepherd to &quot;mount the most ambitious and aggressive effort to date to obstruct the slaughter of the whales in the Southern Ocean.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-091020-1.html|title=Sea Shepherd Unveils the Ady Gil|date=October 20, 2009|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each side blames the other for the incident, arguing that the skipper of the other vessel miscalculated during a dangerous maneuver.&lt;ref name=&quot;RESTRAINT&quot;/&gt; Bethune has said that he believes the captain of the Japanese vessel had miscalculated while trying to scrape the bow of the ''Ady Gil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode|title=Sliced in Two|episodelink=List of Whale Wars episodes#ep24|series=Whale Wars|serieslink=Whale Wars|network=[[Animal Planet]]|airdate=July 16, 2010|season=3|number=6|minutes=36:53|quote=...but I think they wanted to just scrape the bow.

Some blame the ''Ady Gil'' for powering up to intentionally propel itself into the whaler's path, some accuse the ''ShÅnan Maru 2'' of intentionally ramming a stationary vessel - with both sides basing their views primarily on the released video footage.&lt;ref name=&quot;APPEARS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/new-footage-from-ady-gil-before-high-seas-smash-appears-to-back-sea-shepherd-claims/story-e6frf7jo-1225818006595|title=New footage from Ady Gil before high-seas smash appears to back Sea Shepherd claims|publisher=HeraldSun|date=January 11, 2010|accessdate=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others place the blame more evenly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Perfect Storm&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/environment/news/article.cfm?c_id=39&amp;objectid=10619393|title=Hardline warrior in war to save the whale|publisher=The New Zealand Herald|date=January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; An investigation into the collision by the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] (AMSA) was inconclusive and unable to assign blame for the collision. AMSA was unable to verify claims made by Sea Shepherd, while the Japanese government declined to participate with the investigation saying any information it had might be needed for an inquiry by its own authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-national/inquiry-into-ady-gil-crash-inconclusive-20100508-ukx4.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | first=Michelle | last=Draper | title=Inquiry into Ady Gil crash inconclusive | date=May 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New Zealand authorities found both parties were at fault for the collision. The inquiry by [[Maritime New Zealand]] found that the ''Shonan Maru No. 2'' should have kept clear of the ''Ady Gil'' under international collision regulations, and had ample opportunity to avoid hitting it. It also found that the ''Ady Gil'' failed to take avoiding action, and its helmsman did not see the Japanese ship bearing down until seconds before the impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Darby|first=Andrew|title=Ady Gil and whalers both at fault for collision: inquiry|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/whale-watch/ady-gil--and-whalers-both-at-fault-for-collision-inquiry-20101118-17y8u.html|accessdate=November 18, 2010|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute recovered a number of large-size arrows floating near the wreck, arguing that these proved Sea Shepherd was willing to endanger human life with their tactics.&lt;ref name=&quot;WILL&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Whaling Bombshell: Ady Gil Armed With Deadly Arrows; Sea Shepherd 'Willfully Polluting' Antarctic  | url=http://www.underwatertimes.com/news.php?article_id=30846971521 | work=Underwatertimes | date=8 January 2010 | accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrows were said by the crew of the Ady Gil to be used for shooting the dead whales, poisoning their flesh and causing the whale to be of no use to the whalers. This statement was made on an episode of [[Whale Wars]].

Having sustained severe damage, ''Ady Gil'' was towed towards the French [[Dumont d'Urville Station]] in Antarctica.&lt;ref name=&quot;NOTSUNK&quot;&gt;news.com.au, January 8, 2010, [http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/ady-gil-abandoned-and-leaking-oil-japan/story-e6frfku0-1225817467945 Ady Gil abandoned and leaking oil]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;STILLABANDONED&quot;&gt;Herald Sun, January 8, 2010, [http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/breaking-news/govt-cant-guarantee-legal-action-against-japanese-whaling/story-e6frf7jx-1225817484238 Govt can't guarantee legal action against Japanese whaling]&lt;/ref&gt; While weather conditions had been reported as favorable for the salvage attempt, the process of towing the vessel was reported to have caused it to take on more water.

== Replacement ==

The financial loss of the ''Ady Gil'' was estimated at about $1.5 million.
