[[Image:Nyu law vanderbilt.jpg|right|500px|New York University School of Law, Vanderbilt Hall]]

NYU Law publishes eight student-edited [[law review|law journals]], which are, in order of their founding:

{|

| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
*[[NYU Law Review|New York University Law Review]]
*[[NYU Annual Survey of American Law]]
*[[NYU Journal of International Law and Politics]]

*[http://www.law.nyu.edu/journals/lawbusiness/ Journal of Law &amp; Business]
|}

The law school's longstanding commitment to public service is exemplified by its many notable alumni and the [[Root-Tilden Scholarship|Root-Tilden-Kern Scholarship Program]], a full-tuition scholarship awarded each year to twenty students committed to public service.

NYU Law offers several fellowships to students admitted to the LLM Program. The most selective is the Hauser Global Scholarship: eight to ten top LLM students are admitted from all over the world. The scholarship includes full tuition waiver and reasonable accommodation costs. In addition, it offers the Hugo Grotius as well as Vanderbilt scholarships for International law studies and other branches of law respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyulawglobal.org/fellowsscholars/HauserGlobalScholars-LL.M.Candidates.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law school has a law and business program in which eight of the nation's preeminent student-leaders in law and business are awarded fellowships in the Mitchell Jacobson Leadership Program&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.nyu.edu/leadershipprogram].&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU Law also hosts the original chapter of the [[Unemployment Action Center]].

===LL.M. in Taxation Program===

NYU Law School's LL.M. in Taxation program is widely considered to be the strongest LL.M. in Taxation program in the United States, and has been consistently ranked #1 by the U.S. News &amp; World Report magazine since they started ranking specialty law school programs in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/tax-law-rankings&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2010/04/us-news-.html&lt;/ref&gt; Joshua D. Blank is currently the faculty director of the program.&lt;ref&gt;https://its.law.nyu.edu/facultyprofiles/profile.cfm?personID=23511&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax LL.M. students are permitted to enroll in a general course of study or specialize in specific areas such as business taxation or estate planning.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/llmjsd/tax/academicprograms/graduatetaxprogram/suggestedcurricula/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its location in the heart of corporate America, many of the program's professors are the leading practitioners in their respective fields.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/llmjsd/tax/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

LL.M is an abbreviation for Master of Laws, an advanced academic degree, pursued by those holding a professional law degree. In general, there are two types of LL.M. programs in the United States. The majority are programs designed to expose foreign legal graduates to the American Common Law. The other programs involve post doctoral study of a specialized area of the law such as Admiralty, Tax Law, Banking and Financial Law, Elder Law, Aeronautical Law or International Law.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_of_Laws&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partnerships===

In 2005, NYU Law entered into an agreement with the [[Osgoode Hall Law School]] of [[York University]], in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], that will allow select students to obtain a joint-[[Bachelor of Laws]] (LL.B.) and JD, studying at both schools, in four years. The competitive program began in the fall of 2006 and accommodates up to 3 students per year. Since then, they have also implemented a jointly granted NYU/Osgoode LLB/LLM program in which graduates are granted the LLB as well as an LLM from NYU in only 3 and a half years instead of the normally required four.
More recently, the NYU School of Law has entered into similar dual degree agreements with the [[National University of Singapore Faculty of Law]] and the [[Melbourne Law School|University of Melbourne Law School]].

[[Oxford University]] has a program of academic exchanges with New York University School of Law, mainly involving Faculty members and research students working in areas of shared interest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://denning.law.ox.ac.uk/members/partner.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU Law offers a dual-degree program with [[Harvard]]'s [[John F. Kennedy School of Government]]. Students may earn a JD/MPA or a JD/MPP.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/admissions/jdadmissions/dualdegreeprograms/harvarduniversity/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

NYU Law offers a dual-degree program with [[Princeton University|Princeton]]'s [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs]]. Students may earn a JD/MPA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/admissions/jdadmissions/dualdegreeprograms/princetonuniversity/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a limited amount of cross-registration permitted with [[Columbia Law School]]. Each year, a limited number of students are permitted to take classes at each other's schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/recordsandregistration/crossregistration/columbialawschoolnyuschooloflawexchange/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Columbia Law and NYU Law also play a basketball game every spring, the [[Deans' Cup]], to raise money for their public interest and community service organizations.

The highest floors, generally inaccessible to non-residents, are luxury apartments for faculty and their families. The ninth floor is accessible to students and hosts the Lester Pollack Colloquium room.

===Vanderbilt Hall===
The Law School's Main Building, named after [[Arthur T. Vanderbilt]], occupies the entire block between West Third and Washington Square South (West Fourth) and between Macdougal and Sullivan Streets.

The Center's litigation component uses the Center's research, experience, and expertise to litigate criminal cases or cases having implications for the administration of criminal law, particularly in cases in which the exercise of power and discretion by prosecutors raises substantive legal issues.  The Center's public policy and media component seeks to improve public dialogue on criminal justice matters in various ways, including testifying before public officials and the publishing of op-ed pieces.&lt;ref&gt;http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=1260&amp;wit_id=3684&lt;/ref&gt;

The Program incorporates non-U.S. and transnational legal perspectives into the Law Schoolâs curriculum, promotes scholarship on comparative and global law, and brings together faculty, scholars, and students from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.nyu.edu/global/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute for International Law and Justice integrates the law schoolâs scholarly excellence in international law into the policy activities of the [[United Nations]], [[non-governmental organizations]], [[law firms]], and [[industry]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iilj.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tikvah Center for Law &amp; Jewish Civilization is headed by [[Moshe Halbertal]] and [[Joseph H. H. Weiler]]. The foundational premise of the Center is 1) that the study of Jewish law can profit immensely from insights gained from general jurisprudence; and 2) that Jewish law and Jewish civilization can provide illuminating perspectives both on the general study of law as a per se academic discipline, and on the reflection of law as a central social institution refracting the most important issues in our society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyutikvah.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S.-Asia Law Institute serves as a resource and partner to various Asian countries as they reform and further develop their legal systems and institutions.
