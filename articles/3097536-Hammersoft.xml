'''Charmian Carr''' (born December 27, 1942) is an American [[actress]] and [[singer]]. She is mainly known for her role as Liesl, the eldest [[Von Trapp Children|Von Trapp]] daughter in ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' where she starred with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Christopher Plummer]], [[Nicholas Hammond]], [[Heather Menzies]], [[Duane Chase]], [[Angela Cartwright]], [[Debbie Turner]], and [[Kym Karath]].

Carr was born '''Charmian Farnon''' in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. She is the second child of [[vaudeville]] actress [[Rita Oehman]] and musician [[Brian Farnon]], who named her [[Charmian (servant to Cleopatra)|Charmian]]  after a character from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, Charmian. ''Forever Liesl: A Memoir of The Sound of Music''. 3 April 2001, pg. 205. ISBN 0-14-029840-1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Shakespeare]]'s [[tragedy]] ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'' features [[Charmian (servant to Cleopatra)|Charmian]], the servant to [[Cleopatra VII|Cleopatra]].&lt;/ref&gt; She has two sisters, one older and one younger. Her sisters, both actresses, are [[Shannon Farnon]] and [[Darleen Carr]]. 

While Charmian was attending college part-time and working for a doctor, her mother arranged for her to audition for a role in ''The Sound of Music''.  Charmian's mother had not asked her if she wanted to audition for the part, but Charmian grew up in a show business family and said that she knew that her mother would consider her getting a part in a film more important than earning a college diploma. Director [[Robert Wise]] thought Farnon too long a surname for her, and after he had given her a list of single syllable surnames, she chose Carr. She won the role of Liesl over [[Geraldine Chaplin]], [[Patty Duke]], [[Mia Farrow]] and [[Sharon Tate]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139642/bio&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was on the whole a very happy experience for her. During the filming of her dance scene with Rolf in the gazebo, however, the costume crew forgot to put no-slip pads on her shoes, she slid through a window of the gazebo and she &quot;had to complete the scene in agony.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/12/26/bfliesl126.xml December 2007 interview]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Carr also appeared in ''[[Evening Primrose (musical)|Evening Primrose]]'', a one-hour musical written by [[Stephen Sondheim]], which aired on television's ''[[ABC Stage 67]]'' in 1966.  The male lead was [[Anthony Perkins]].  She has written two books, ''[[Forever Liesl]]'' and ''[[Letters to Liesl]]''.

While publicising ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'' after its release, Carr met Jay Brent, whom she married in May 1967. She retired from acting to raise her two daughters, Jennifer and Emily, and to establish an interior decorating company. The marriage lasted until 1991.   

Carr now owns and operates Charmian Carr Designs in [[Encino, California]]. Her interior decorating clients included [[Ernest Lehman]], screenwriter for ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]''; [[Michael Jackson]], who hired her because he was a fan of the film; and other cast members from the film.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0139642/bio&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 12, 2007, Carr made a rare television appearance as a guest on ''[[Loose Women]]'' where she shared some of her memories of making ''The Sound of Music'' with the hosts.

Carr reunited with all of her co-stars from ''The Sound of Music'' on [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] in October 2010 to celebrate the 45th anniversary of ''The Sound of Music''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://popwatch.ew.com/2010/09/27/oprah-sound-of-music-cast-reunion/ Oprah to reunite 'The Sound of Music' cast for the first time in 45 years]&lt;/ref&gt;
