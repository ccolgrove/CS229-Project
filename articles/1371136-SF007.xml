'''''Syberia''''' is a 2002 computer [[adventure game]] conceived by [[BenoÃ®t Sokal]], developed by [[MicroÃ¯ds]] and published through [[The Adventure Company]].  It follows the protagonist Kate Walker as she attempts to wrap up a sale on the behalf of her law firm.  In addition to the main plot, the game contains a dramatic subplot, conducted via calls received on Kate's [[cell phone]], involving Kate's deteriorating relationship with her fiancÃ©.

The game uses elements of [[art nouveau]] and [[steampunk]] fiction in its story. Most devices and tools, and even a train, are powered by springs and wind-up gears.  ''Syberia'' was acclaimed by critics for its graphic design and intelligent script, and a [[sequel]], ''[[Syberia II]]'', was released in 2004, picking up where the first game leaves off.  In 2009 MicroÃ¯ds announced that ''[[Syberia III]]'' would be released on PC, and possibly [[PlayStation 3]], in 2010 or 2011.

Sokal's earlier game ''[[Amerzone]]'' is located in the same [[fictional universe]], and ''Syberia'' contains some references to it.  Another of Sokal's adventure games ''[[Paradise (video game)|Paradise]]'' has no connections to ''Syberia'' but does use similar art direction and interface.

== Gameplay ==
''Syberia'' is a [[Third-person shooter|third-person]], mouse-driven, semi-realistic/semi-surrealistic [[adventure game]] in which the player must solve various puzzles and follow certain procedures in order for the linear storyline to proceed.  As a pure graphical adventure game, ''Syberia'' follows the guidelines first introduced by [[LucasArts]]: it is impossible to die or to get stuck at any moment in the game, which allows the user to fully immerse him/herself in ''Syberia''{{'}}s universe without the fear of making a mistake or the constant need of saving the game.

== Plot ==
In the game, the player controls the actions of American lawyer Kate Walker, who is sent to a remote French village in order to finalize the take-over of a toy factory there.  Once at the village, Kate learns that the woman who owned the factory has just died, and that she has a brother who must be contacted in order for the takeover to proceed.  Her mission takes her across Central and Eastern Europe, gradually leading her to question her own lifestyle.  The titular Syberia is a mythical island on which [[mammoth]]s are said to live.

=== ValadilÃ¨ne ===
The game starts with Kate arriving in the fictional French village of ValadilÃ¨ne and witnessing the funeral of Anna Voralberg, the owner of a family-owned spring-[[automaton]] toy factory whose takeover by a big American business Kate was supposed to finalize.  When visiting the village [[notary]] to hopefully finalize the deal, the notary tells Kate that just before her death, the old lady revealed that her brother, officially declared dead and buried in the town cemetery, is in fact alive somewhere in the North-East.  Naturally, now that his sister is dead, Hans Voralberg becomes the new owner of the factory, which cannot be sold without his [[approbation]].  Kate has no choice: if she wants the takeover to succeed, she will have to find Hans.  Kate's research reveals that Hans was injured in his attempt to retrieve a prehistoric doll of a [[mammoth]] ridden by a man.  It stunted his development, both physically and emotionally, and Hans' one and only goal became to find mammoths to ride them as the doll depicts.

In order to find Hans, Kate must take his train, a [[clockwork]] locomotive built by his sister at his request.  It is manned by Oscar, a man-like automaton fond of protocol, which Kate must satisfy to depart.  Thus, she is forced to delve into Hans' past to retrieve two items of value to him: the mammoth doll, and a clockwork [[music box]].

=== Barrockstadt ===
The first stop is Barrockstadt, a failing university which Hans once visited whose train station also acts as a botanical garden.  The train stops short of the winding mechanism, so Kate must barter with a nearby couple with a [[barge]].  They insist to be paid $100 for their assistance, so Kate has to fix the university's broken [[bandstand]] to get the university's stubborn board of directors to help.  Along the way, she gets a lesson on the legend of Syberia and the customs of the mysterious prehistoric Youkol people who lived with mammoths and were able to domesticate them. Before she can leave Barrockstadt entirely she must pass the large wall keeping her train from exiting.

=== Komkolzgrad ===
The next stop is Komkolzgrad, a dusty [[Communist]]-era industrial mining complex with two giant metallic worker-automata overlooking the tracks.  The place is run by the eccentric and somewhat crazy Serguei Borodine, who steals Oscar's hands to make his automaton [[organist]] work.  He intends to construct the biggest stage possible for Helena Romanski, a washed up [[opera singer]] with whom he is obsessed.  Kate has little choice but to fetch her from a nearby [[spa]] in Aralbad on his behalf.  Serguei directs Kate to the adjacent [[cosmodrome]] for transportation.

At the cosmodrome, Kate meets former [[test pilot]] Boris, a drunk who dreams of flying into space on a &quot;[[flying wing]]&quot; invented by Hans.  After some sobering up, he teaches Kate how to operate an old [[airship]] in exchange for her help in making the flying wing functional.  He also warns Kate not to trust Serguei.  Once Boris is launched, she uses his advice to launch the airship and leaves for Aralbad.

=== Aralbad ===
At the Aralbad spa, Kate meets Helena after some trouble getting past the manager.  The elderly lady believes she is too old to sing, having lost her legendary voice which could break glass.  With a special [[cocktail]] mixed at the bar and a wine glass, Helena is convinced that she can still sing and agrees to go with Kate.

=== Epilogue ===
The performance in Komkolzgrad does not go quite as planned: beautiful though Helena's voice may be (she sings [[Dark Eyes (song)|&quot;Dark Eyes&quot;]]), it doesn't stop Serguei from imprisoning her, as he wants to keep Helena at his side as his personal opera singer.  Kate is able to free Helena and take back Oscar's hands, but Serguei isn't quite willing to give up without a fight, using the worker-automata to block the train.  Some spare dynamite dispatches that problem, and Kate brings Helena back to Aralbad.  Surprisingly, none other than Hans Voralberg is waiting there at the spa, delighted that Kate brought him his train and Oscar.  Hans shows little concern for his sister's death and signs the factory release papers without even reading them.  He offers to take Kate along, but she initially refuses.  However, as she is about to board a plane to fly back to New York, she changes her mind and hops on board the train at the last second, abandoning her job and her unfaithful fiancÃ© back home to help an old man realize his dream.

== Development ==
[[File:Syberia 1 screenshot 1.jpg|thumb|Kate and Oscar on the train.]]

''Syberia'' was followed by a sequel, ''Syberia II'', which continued Kate Walker's voyage to Syberia. In 2008 the ''Syberia'' series website was relaunched.

On [[April Fools' Day|1 April]] 2009 MicroÃ¯ds announced that ''[[Syberia III]]'' would be released on PC and [[PlayStation 3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/en/press/28/microids-launches-syberia-3-on-ps3-.html |title=MicroÃ¯ds launches ''Syberia 3'' on PS3 |publisher=MicroÃ¯ds |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further press release on 2 April noted that ''Syberia'' would be one of the series of games to be released in the &quot;Ultimate Adventures&quot; tri-packs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/fr/presse/29/microids-confie-a-cdv-mdarics-media-la-distribution-de-ses-jeux-en-france.html |title=MicroÃ¯ds confie Ã  CDV MDARICS MEDIA la distribution de ses jeux en France |publisher=MicroÃ¯ds |date=2009-04-02 |language=French |accessdate=2009-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 April another press release was issued, explaining that the PC version will be released, but the PS3 version may not, due to problems with Sony.

In 2009 MicroÃ¯ds decided to invest in the ''Syberia'' franchise. MicroÃ¯ds have also asked that fans of ''Syberia'' send them emails of support for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.microids.com/en/press/30/returns-on-the-syberia-3-announcement.html |title=Returns on the ''Syberia 3'' announcement |publisher=MicroÃ¯ds |date=2009-04-17 |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has stated that the game will miss its original June 2010 release date, and is likely that it will be released after 2010.
