The '''Xbox 360 Controller''' is the primary [[Game controller|controller]] for [[Microsoft]]'s [[Xbox 360]] console and was introduced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2005. The Xbox 360 controller comes in both wired and wireless versions. Original [[Xbox]] controllers are not compatible with the Xbox 360. The controller is also compatible with PCs; the wireless version requires a [[#Wireless Gaming Receiver|Wireless Gaming Receiver]] in order to connect to the PC.

The wireless controllers run on either AA batteries or a rechargeable battery pack. The wired controllers may be connected to any of the [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports on the console, or to an attached [[USB hub]].

==Design==
The Xbox 360 controller has the same basic familiar button layout as the [[Xbox#Controllers &amp; Accessories|Controller S]] except that a few of the auxiliary buttons have been moved. The &quot;back&quot; and &quot;start&quot; buttons have been moved to a more central position on the face of the controller, and the &quot;white&quot; and &quot;black&quot; buttons have been removed and replaced with two new bumpers that are positioned over the analog triggers on the back of the controller. The controller has a 2.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[TRS connector]] on the front, allowing users to connect a headset for voice communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox360/Accessories/Controllers/Xbox360WirelessController |title=Xbox 360 Wireless Controller - Xbox.com |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also features a proprietary USB connector (which is split into 2 parts on either side of the headset connector) for use with additional accessories, such as the chatpad.

On August 31, 2010, Microsoft's [[Larry Hryb]] (a.k.a. Major Nelson) revealed a new design of the Xbox 360 controller which is set to replace the Wireless controller bundled with the [[Xbox 360 accessories#Play and Charge Kit|Play &amp; Charge Kit]]. Among small changes such as the shape of the analogue stick tops and grey-colored face buttons, the new controller features an adjustable directional pad which can be changed between a disc type D-pad or a plus shaped D-pad. The control pad was released in North America exclusively with Play &amp; Charge Kits on November 9, 2010 and is expected to be released in Europe during February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5626526/microsoft-reveals-new-360-controller-with-transforming-d+pad|title=Microsoft Reveals New 360 Controller With Transforming D-Pad|date=2010-08-31|accessdate=2010-08-31|publisher=Kotaku|first=Mike|last=Fahey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Layout==
A standard Xbox 360 controller features eleven* digital buttons, two analog triggers, two [[analog stick]]s and a digital [[D-pad]]. The right face of the controller features four digital actions buttons; a green &quot;A&quot; button, red &quot;B&quot; button, blue &quot;X&quot; button and amber &quot;Y&quot; button. The lower right houses the right analog stick, in lower left is a digital D-pad and on the left face is the left analog stick. Both analog sticks can also be &quot;clicked in&quot; to activate a digital button beneath. In the center of the controller face are digital &quot;Start&quot;, &quot;Back&quot; and &quot;Guide&quot; buttons. The &quot;Guide&quot; button is labelled with the Xbox logo, and is used to turn on the console and/or controller and to access the guide menu. It is also surrounded by the &quot;ring of light&quot;, which indicates the controller number, as well as flashing when connecting and to provide notifications. The left and right &quot;shoulders&quot; each feature a digital shoulder button, or &quot;bumper&quot;, and an analog trigger.
[[image:XBOX_360_controller_II.jpg|thumb|left|Xbox 360 guide button.]]

&lt;small&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Wireless controllers also feature an additional &quot;connect&quot; button located between the &quot;bumpers&quot; to facilitate syncing with the console.&lt;/small&gt;
[[image:360 controller.svg|center|450px|Button layout of a wireless Xbox 360 controller]]

==Colors and special editions==
Wired controllers are only available in white and black (Xbox 360 S color scheme).&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/Xbox360/Accessories/Controllers/Xbox360Controller |title=Xbox 360 Controller - Xbox.com |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2011-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, wireless controllers are available in numerous different colors including: 

===Standard colors===
*'''White''' controllers were bundled with the Arcade and Pro consoles; also sold separately.
*'''Black''' controllers came with the Elite to match the case; also sold separately.
*'''Dark Blue''' controllers were released in October 2007 (USA only)
*'''Light Blue''' controllers were released in October 2007 (Europe and Japan only)
*'''Pink''' controllers were also released in October 2007.
*'''Black S''' controllers are bundled with Xbox 360 S consoles. These differ from previous controllers (and the original black version specifically) in that they are completely black, rather than two-tone black and grey. The guide button has a mirror like finish, and the analog sticks and D-pad are black. The bottom edge of this controller also features a gloss black finish to match the Xbox 360 S 250&amp;nbsp;GB case design. &quot;S&quot; controllers also replace the ''Microsoft'' branding above the charging port with an ''Xbox 360'' logo.

Two versions were available, each of which feature Halo 3 themed artwork (with either a &quot;Spartan&quot; or &quot;Brute&quot; design) from artist Todd McFarlane. Each version of the controller also included a Master Chief Figurine (a different figure was included with each version).
*'''Red''' &quot;Limited Edition&quot; controllers were released in September 2008.

*'''Green''' &quot;Limited Edition&quot; controllers were released in mid October 2008 in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. The green controller has a direction pad with 16-way functionality, instead of the 8-way direction pad used on all previous controllers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/news/6234389.html|title=Xbox 360 limited-edition green wireless controller hands on|accessdate=2009-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; This controller was released alongside [[Pro Evolution Soccer 2009]].

===Non-retail colors===
[[File:Launchcontroller.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Wireless controller bundled with the ''&quot;Launch Team Edition&quot;'' Xbox 360]]
*'''Launch Team Edition''' controllers were bundled with the ''&quot;[[Xbox 360#Xbox 360 Launch Team Edition|Xbox 360 - Launch Team Edition]]&quot;'', given exclusively to members of the Xbox launch team by [[Microsoft]] in November 2005. These white wireless controllers feature green accents at the front in place of the standard grey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://majornelson.com/archive/2005/11/30/xbox-360-launch-team-gift.aspx|title=Xbox 360 Launch Team Gift|accessdate=2010-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Guide button==
The Xbox 360 controller has a Guide button in the center of its face that provides a new functionality. This button is surrounded by a ring of lights divided into four quadrants that provide gamers with different types of information during game play. For instance, during a split screen multiplayer match, a particular quadrant will light up to indicate to a player which part of the screen he or she is playing on at that time. In this case, when the user pushes the button, he or she accesses the Xbox guide; a menu which provides access to features like messaging friends, downloading content, voice chat and customizing soundtracks, while staying in the game. The Guide button also allows users to turn off the controller or the console by holding the button for a few seconds (rather than simply pressing it).

==Accessories==
===Rechargeable Battery Pack===
[[Image:Xbox360 BatteryForWirelessController.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Battery Pack, Play and Charge Cable and Quick Charger]]
{{Main|Xbox 360 accessories#Rechargeable Battery Pack|l1=Xbox 360 accessories - Rechargeable Battery Pack}}
The Rechargeable Battery Pack is a [[nickel metal hydride|nickel metal hydride (NiMH)]] battery pack, which provides up to 25 hours of continuous gaming for the wireless controller. It is recommended in place of disposable [[AA battery|AA batteries]], which differ slightly in voltage and have higher disposal costs (financial and environmental). It ships as part of, and can be charged by, the [[Xbox 360 accessories#Play and Charge Kit|Play &amp; Charge Kit]] and the [[Xbox 360 accessories#Quick Charge Kit|Quick Charge Kit]]. To fully charge the battery pack takes approximately 2 hours with the Quick Charge Kit; the Play &amp; Charge Kit takes longer (and depends on whether the controller is being used). An upgraded, 35-hour version is included with &quot;transforming d-pad&quot; controllers.

===Wireless Gaming Receiver===
