'''Hiram College''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|h|aÉª|r|É|m}} {{respell|HY|rÉm}}) is a private [[liberal arts college]] located in [[Hiram, Ohio]]. Founded by Amos Sutton Hayden of the [[Disciples of Christ]] Church in 1850, the institution has, since its first days, been nonsectarian and coeducational, and throughout its existence Hiram College has sustained this egalitarian tradition of educating men and women from diverse backgrounds. U.S. President [[James A. Garfield]] was a student, instructor, and principal of the institution while it was still the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=James A. Garfield | work =[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]| url = http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=G000063 | accessdate = 2007-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the College is known for its unique [[academic calendar]] and for its [[study abroad]] programs. Hiram College is accredited by [[The Higher Learning Commission]] of the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]]. Hiram is listed in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.

==Founding and History==

[[Image:WREI-Hiram.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Western Reserve Eclectic Institute, Hiram, 1858]]

The Disciples of Christ founded the Western Reserve Eclectic Institute as a nonsectarian, coeducational preparatory school in 1849. Hiram was chosen as the site of the institution because this area of the [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]] seemed to be &quot;healthful and free of distractions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryOfHiram&quot;/&gt;

The Institute's original charter was authorized by the state legislature on March 1, 1850, and the school opened on November 27, 1850 despite the fact that the building was not yet completed. Many of the students came from the surrounding farms and villages of the Western Reserve, but Hiram soon gained a national reputation and students began arriving from other states. The school attained collegiate rank in 1867 and changed its name to Hiram College.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryOfHiram&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=History of Hiram College | work = Official Hiram College web site | publisher = Hiram College | url = http://www.hiram.edu/visitors/about/historyofhiram.html | accessdate = 2007-01-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Faculty 1858.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Image from 1858 including [[James A. Garfield]] (far left) and his wife, [[Lucretia Rudolph Garfield]] (far right) along with other WREI faculty.]]

The first principal of the Institute (equivalent to today's president of the College) was Amos Sutton Hayden (1813â1880), who served from 1850 until 1857. Almeda A. Booth (1823â1875) served as principal of the Ladies' department and as a faculty member of English, Classics, and Mathematics from 1851 until 1866. She was one of [[James A. Garfield|Garfield]]'s more influential teachers and remained close friends with him until her death. Garfield was also mentored by [[Platt Rogers Spencer]], a prominent writing scholar. Garfield, himself, after completing his degree at [[Williams College|Williams]], returned to Hiram to join the faculty in 1856, as a classical scholar teaching Greek and Latin, along with such subjects as mathematics and geology. In 1857, he became principal of the Institute. Although he left Hiram in 1861 to take up the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] command of Company A of the [[42nd Ohio Infantry|42nd Ohio Volunteer Infantry]], a regiment recruited from Hiram, Garfield's name appeared in the Institute's catalogs until 1863.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryOfHiram&quot;/&gt;

Three years after the Institute attained collegiate rank and became known as Hiram College, Burke A. Hinsdale, who had been a student of Garfield's, was appointed president. Because of the fairly brief terms of the two presidents who preceded him, Hinsdale is known as the first permanent president of Hiram College. During his administration (1870â1882), the College achieved higher academic standing and established an ideal model for intellectual honesty and sound scholarship that gained national recognition. Hinsdale gathered around him the nucleus of a strong faculty who continued to serve the College for the next half century.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryOfHiram&quot;/&gt;

In September 2004, [[Thomas V. Chema]] was appointed as the 21st president of Hiram College.

==Overview==

Hiram employs a unique academic calendar consisting of two, 15-week semesters further divided into two sessions- a 12-week, during which students take three academic courses, and a 3-week, when students focus on a single intensive course [http://www.hiram.edu/visitors/about/whyhiram/plan.html].

The College was awarded a chapter of [[Phi Beta Kappa]], the nation's premier undergraduate honor society, in 1971. Represented within the College's enrollment are twenty-three countries, twenty-six states and more than twenty-five different religions. More than 50% of students [[study abroad]] at least once en route to their degree. Hiram has implemented a Tuition Guarantee system, which ensures that the annual cost for tuition will not increase between the first year a student is enrolled at Hiram and the student's senior year.

===In the Press===

Education writer [[Loren Pope]] included Hiram in his influential book ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''. He praised the College writing &quot;Concern for the student's personal as well as academic welfare is one of the qualities that makes Hiram such an exceptional college.&quot; [http://www.ctcl.com/colleges/hiram/Default.htm#worth_noting]
[[The Princeton Review]] notes Hiram's strengths saying &quot;Uniformly strong science programs set this tiny liberal arts college apart from many otherwise fine schools of similar size. Want proof? Over the past ten years, Hiram's medical school acceptance rate has been among the highest in the nation.&quot; - The Princeton Review (2002). As a member of the [[Annapolis Group]], Hiram does not generally endorse the process of ranking colleges numerically. Hiram's ranking in the 2011 edition of U.S.News Best Colleges is 152 in the category of National Liberal Arts Colleges. Hiram's ranking in Americas Best Colleges 2010 produced by Forbes and the Center for College Affordability and Productivity is 166 out of all colleges and universities.

==Academics==

As a liberal arts college, Hiram specializes in the education of undergraduate students, though the college does have a small graduate program. Hiram confers the following degrees: BA, BSN (nursing), MA (interdisciplinary studies). Students also have the option of a dual degree plan in engineering between Hiram and the School of Engineering and Applied Science at [[Washington University in St. Louis]], Missouri, or the School of Engineering at [[Case Western Reserve University]] in Cleveland, Ohio.

Hiram's strengths as an institution relate to its small class sizes, which affords students significant involvement in lectures. Hiram's education plan also focuses on [http://abroad.hiram.edu/ international study] experiences, independent study opportunities, and faculty-guided research projects. Currently, almost all majors require some form of extensive independent project or apprenticeship experience, and in most cases, a public defense/presentation of the work, in order to complete the degree requirements.

===Centers of Distinction===

===Greek clubs===

In order to preserve the egalitarian character of the college, it was decided that Hiram would have no national fraternities or sororities. There are, however, Greek social clubs. No affiliations with any national fraternities are intended or implied. Greek social clubs at Hiram are restricted from using the same Greek letters as any national organization.

Established in 1929, Phi Gamma Epsilon (or &quot;Phi Gams&quot;) is currently the oldest existing Greek social fraternity at Hiram College. Probation threatened the existence of the club both in the mid 1980s and the 00s, but the group survived and now claims to boast a strong, visible presence. The Phi Gams have sponsored a number of events with their sister organization Phi Beta Gamma, including an annual Toga Party and Spaghetti Dinner. The group's mascot, Buck PhiGam, is a Viking whose likeness is represented in a painting the group believes was created in the 1920s. 

Phi Beta Gamma, their sister group, was established in 1941 and is the oldest existing Greek social sorority. The &quot;Betas&quot; hold annual events such as: Toga and Funky Formal which are open to the entire campus community.  They hold weekly meetings and social events while encouraging each other to be leaders on campus. 

Phi Kappa Chi was established Feb 11, 1946 had became inactive in the early 90's and became active again in 2007. This organization is a group of diverse group of women. It is a student-run club which meets once to twice a month to hang out, as well as plan programs. Some of the activities include game nights and study breaks. Most recently, these ladies are known for hosting a fundraiser for breast cancer awareness, sex education program and domestic violence awareness. Rush for Phi Kappa Chi is in January after Christmas break.

Their brother fraternity Kappa Sigma Pi was reestablished in January 2004, the mission of Kappa Sigma Pi is to provide brotherhood, friendship, and camaraderie to any individual willing to uphold the laws governing the Sigma organization, which include upholding the traditions of success in academics, citizenship, leadership, scholarship and philantropy, and to give their best effort when facing adversity.

Another one of the social clubs at Hiram College is Delta Chi Lambda. The Delta Chi Lambdas is made up of all female students. This club was once disbanded but now is back. It is currently one of the largest Greek social clubs at Hiram. The brother group is Lambda Lambda. After a shortage of members, they are currently rebuilding their program.

===[http://www.hiram.edu/kcpb/ Kennedy Center Programming Board]===

The Kennedy Center Programming Board (KCPB) is one of Hiram's largest student organizations. Although its establishment is unknown, yearbook pictures of events and members can be found as far back as the early 1970s. KCPB is responsible for programming student activities on campus. KCPB receives its funding from the student activity fund which each student pays into each year. Some of the annually notable programs are Homecoming, Spring Fest, Campus Day, Game Room Tournaments, and Coffee Houses. In 2006/2007, Student Senate created a new position, Vice President of Activities. This person serves as the chairman/chairwoman of KCPB. This merger allowed Student Senate to relinquish its programming sector and focus on student and college issues.

===Terrier Productions===

Terrier Productions is Hiram College's film and video production club. They tape events on campus, create promotional advertisements for other clubs, and work on other creative projectsâincluding talk shows, music videos, student body polls, and short movies. This group broadcasts over a local, closed-network cable channel and Youtube [http://youtube.com/terrierproductions].

===Terrier Sound Marching Band===

Hiram College created its first marching band in Spring of 2006 emerging from an already established pep band. After intense fund raising, the students raised just over $10,000 to purchase marching band music and instruments in just less than six months. The first marching band in Hiram College history sprang from student initiative. The Terrier Sound Marching Band (TSMB) made its first official appearance at the Hiramâs season-opening football game against Carnegie Mellon University on Saturday, September 2, 2006. In the summer of 2007, the marching band purchased its first official marching band uniforms after a generous donation. The band can be seen performing on the steps of the Kennedy Center (Student Union) before the home football games.
