'''NeXTSTEP''' (also written '''NeXTstep''', '''NeXTStep''', and '''NEXTSTEP'''&lt;ref name=&quot;kevra&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kevra.org/TheBestOfNext/DifferentNeXTSpellings/DifferentNeXTSpellings.html|title=What's with all the NeXT names?|last=Ford|first=Kevin|year=2008| work=www.kevra.org|accessdate=2009-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the [[Object-oriented operating system|object-oriented]], [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]] developed by [[NeXT|NeXT Computer]] to run on its range of proprietary [[workstation]] computers, such as the [[NeXTcube]]. It was later ported to several other [[computer architecture]]s.

A preview release of NeXTSTEP (version 0.8) was shown at the launch of the [[NeXT Computer]] on October 12, 1988. The first full release, NeXTSTEP 1.0, shipped on September 18, 1989.&lt;ref name=osxbook&gt;{{cite web|last=Singh|first=Amit|title=What is Mac OS X?|url=http://osxbook.com/book/bonus/ancient/whatismacosx/history.html|work=osxbook.com|accessdate=18 April 2011|month=December|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The last version, 3.3, was released in early 1995, by which time it ran not only on the [[Motorola]] [[68000 family]] processors used in NeXT computers, but also [[Intel]] [[x86]], [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]] [[SPARC]], and [[HP]] [[PA-RISC]]-based systems.

NeXTSTEP was later modified to separate the underlying operating system from the higher-level object libraries. The result was [[OpenStep]], which ran on multiple underlying operating systems, including NeXT's own OPENSTEP. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[Mac OS X]] is a direct descendant of NeXTSTEP, through the OPENSTEP lineage.

==Description==
NeXTSTEP was a combination of several parts:
*a [[Unix-like]] operating system based on the [[Mach kernel]], plus source code from [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]
*[[Display PostScript]] and a windowing engine
*the [[Objective-C]] language and runtime
*an [[object-oriented programming|object-oriented]] (OO) application layer, including several &quot;kits&quot;
*development tools for the OO layers

NeXTSTEP was notable for the last three items. The toolkits offered considerable power, and were used to build all of the software on the machine. Distinctive features of the Objective-C language made the writing of applications with NeXTSTEP far easier than on many competing systems, and the system was often pointed to as a paragon of computer development, even a decade later.

NeXTSTEP's user interface was refined and consistent, and introduced the idea of the [[Dock (computing)|Dock]], carried through [[OpenStep]] and into [[Mac OS X]], and the [[Shelf (computing)|Shelf]]. NeXTSTEP also created or was among the very first to include a large number of other [[GUI]] concepts now common in other operating systems: 3D &quot;chiseled&quot; widgets, large full-color [[icon]]s, system-wide drag and drop of a wide range of objects beyond file icons, system-wide piped [[Services menu|services]], real-time scrolling and window dragging, properties dialog boxes (&quot;inspectors&quot;), window modification notices (such as the saved status of a file), etc. The system was among the first general-purpose user interfaces to handle publishing color standards, transparency, sophisticated sound and music processing (through a [[Motorola 56000]] [[Digital signal processor|DSP]]), advanced graphics primitives, internationalization, and modern typography, in a consistent manner across all applications.

Additional kits were added to the product line to make the system more attractive. These included Portable Distributed Objects (PDO), which allowed easy [[remote invocation]], and [[Enterprise Objects Framework]], a powerful [[object-relational]] [[database]] system. The kits made the system particularly interesting to custom application programmers, and NeXTSTEP had a long history in the [[financial programming]] community.

==Influence==
The first [[web browser]], [[WorldWideWeb]], was developed on the Nextstep platform.

{{quotation| &quot;1990 CERN: A Joint proposal for a hypertext system is presented to the management. Mike Sendall buys a NeXT cube for evaluation, and gives it to [[Tim Berners-Lee|Tim [Berners-Lee] ]]. Tim's prototype implementation on NeXTStep is made in the space of a few months, thanks to the qualities of the NeXTStep software development system. This prototype offers WYSIWYG browsing/authoring! Current Web browsers used in &quot;surfing the Internet&quot; are mere passive windows, depriving the user of the possibility to contribute. During some sessions in the CERN cafeteria, Tim and I try to find a catching name for the system. I was determined that the name should not yet again be taken from Greek mythology. Tim proposes &quot;World-Wide Web&quot;. I like this very much, except that it is difficult to pronounce in French...&quot; by [[Robert Cailliau]],  2 November 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ben&quot;&gt;[http://www.netvalley.com/cgi-bin/intval/net_history.pl?chapter=4  Roads and Crossroads of Internet History]  Chapter 4: Birth of the Web&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Some features and [[keyboard shortcuts]] now commonly found in web browsers can be traced to Nextstep conventions. The basic layout options of [[HTML]] 1.0 and 2.0 are attributable to those features available in NeXT's Text class.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/WorldWideWeb Tim Berners-Lee: WorldWideWeb, the first Web client]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Doom WAD|level (WAD) editor]] for the game ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' was also developed on NeXT machines,&lt;ref&gt;[http://rome.ro/2006/12/apple-next-merger-birthday.html John Romero of id Software talks about development of Doom on NeXT]&lt;/ref&gt; as was Altsys Virtuoso, version 2 of which was ported to Mac OS and Windows to become [[Macromedia FreeHand]] version 4, the modern &quot;Notebook&quot; interface for [[Mathematica]], and the advanced spreadsheet [[Lotus Improv]]. The software that controlled [[MCI Communications|MCI]]'s [[Friends and Family]] program was developed using Nextstep.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roughlydrafted.com/RD/RDM.Tech.Q1.07/141B0B5A-C8DE-49D2-BFDF-DB75E44A3285.html &quot;MCI used NeXT software to power its revolutionary Friends and Family networking referral campaign, which other rivals couldn't match for years.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepwise.com/Articles/Business/NextOrderOfBusiness.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

About the time of the 3.2 release, NeXT teamed up with [[Sun Microsystems]] to develop [[OpenStep]], a cross-platform object-oriented API standard derived from Nextstep. Implementations of that standard were released for Sun's [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[Windows NT]], and NeXT's version of the [[Mach kernel]]. NeXT's implementation was called '''OPENSTEP for Mach''' and its first release (4.0) superseded Nextstep 3.3 on NeXT, Sun and Intel IA-32 systems.

Following an announcement on December 20, 1996,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Apple Computer, Inc. Agrees to Acquire NeXT Software Inc.|publisher=Apple Computer, Inc.|date=1996-12-20|url= http://web.archive.org/web/19970301172356/http://live.apple.com/next/961220.pr.rel.next.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 4, 1997, [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] acquired NeXT for $429 million, and used the [[OPENSTEP]] for Mach operating system as the basis for [[Mac OS X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Apple Confidential: The Real Story of Apple Computer, Inc|last=Linzmayer|first=Owen W.|year= 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[free software]] implementation of the OpenStep standard, [[GNUstep]], also exists.

The anime series [[Serial_Experiments_Lain#Apple_computers|Serial Experiments Lain]] was influenced by NextStep and Mac OS, references may be found throughout the show and its affiliated media. Most notably the slogan for the Lain PSX Game &quot;Close the world, Open the nExt&quot;.
