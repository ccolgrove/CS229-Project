The '''Embassy of Poland in Moscow''' is the [[diplomatic mission]] of the [[Republic of Poland]] to the [[Russian Federation]]. The chancery is located at Klimashkina Street 4, Moscow.

The [[List of diplomatic missions of Poland|Polish embassy]] occupies a purpose-built building of modernist design, incorporating Polish national motifs which is sited on a special diplomatic compound just outside Moscow's '[[Garden Ring]]'. The compound is, in accordance with diplomatic protocol, considered part of the territory of the Polish Republic; for this reason the ambassador's residence as well as apartments for a number of other diplomatic staff are located there, alongside the chancery and consular buildings.

In recent years the embassy has been the location of a number of protests against the policies of the Polish government. Notably, in recent times, the embassy served as the primary target for groups wishing to express their disagreement with the directives of the late president [[Lech KaczyÅski]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kommersant.com/p600198/r_1/Polish_Embassy%E2%80%99s_2nd_Casualty/|title=Polish diplomat attacked in Moscow, ambassador calls for staff to stay on compound.|date=11 August 2005|publisher=[[Kommersant]]|accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
