The '''Olympic [[mascot]](s)''' is(are) a character, usually an animal native to the area or occasionally human figures, who represents the cultural heritage of the place where the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Paralympic Games]] are taking place.

Since the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] in [[Grenoble]], [[France]] the Olympic Games have had a [[mascot]]. The first major mascot in the Olympic Games was [[Misha]] in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in [[Moscow]]. Misha was used extensively during the opening and closing ceremonies, had a TV animated cartoon and appeared on several merchandise products.

Starting with the [[Miga, Quatchi, Sumi and Mukmuk|2010 Vancouver mascots]], the Olympic and [[Paralympic mascots]] have been presented together.
