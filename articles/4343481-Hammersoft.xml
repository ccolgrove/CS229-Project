{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Saint Seiya'' characters}}
This article comprises a '''list of characters''' that play a role in '''''Saint Seiya''''' (also known as '''''Knights of the Zodiac''''') and its canonical continuation, '''''Saint Seiya: Next Dimension''''', two manga series created, written and illustrated by [[Masami Kurumada]].

The plot of ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' begins in 1990 (date retconned from 1986 by the author at the beginning of ''Next Dimension'') and follows a group of five mystical warriors called Saints as they battle in the name of the goddess Athena against agents of evil who seek to rule the Earth. Their main enemy in the first arc of the story is the traitorous Gold Saint of Gemini, who has murdered the representative of Athena and taken his place as leader of the Saints. In the second arc, the Saints are confronted with the god of the Sea Poseidon, who, after kidnapping the mortal reincarnation of Athena, threatens to flood the world with incessant rain to cleanse it of the evils of mankind. Their final enemy, who appears in the third arc of the series, is the god of the Underworld, Hades, whom Athena has fought since the age of myth.

''[[Saint Seiya: Next Dimension]]'' acts both as a prequel and a sequel to the first series. It details the aftermath of the war against Hades and starts with Athena seeking help from the gods of Olympus and from Chronos to save Pegasus Seiya by travelling back to the 18th century. The two main antagonists are the troops of the goddess Artemis, in the 20th century storyline, and the incarnation of Hades in the 18th century.

==Creation and conception==

When Kurumada designed Seiya's likeness, he was inspired by RyÅ«ji Takane, the main character of his hit manga ''[[Ring ni Kakero]]'', which he created 9 years before Seiya. Most protagonists of Kurumada's works bear a resemblance to RyÅ«ji, because Kurumada subscribes to the revered [[Osamu Tezuka]]'s Star System (a stable cast of characters) technique. The same process is done with almost all the other characters from the series, as in all Kurumada's works.&lt;ref name=&quot;References&quot;&gt;{{cite book|editor=|title=Kappa Magazine, number 80|year=1999|publisher=|language=Japanese|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:The Bronze Saint [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] in the 20th century and protagonist of the series. An orphaned child later revealed to be son of Mitsumasa Kido, he was separated from his sister Seika and forced to become a Saint. Attaining such goal against all odds, first motivated to rejoin his sister, Seiya later discovers his destiny as one of the soldiers of the goddess Athena, whom he has protected for millennia, his soul returning every time she does, to assist her in the battle against the evil that consumes Earth. As a warrior of immense might, Seiya achieves victory in impossible battles, managing to defeat the gods Poseidon and Hades, who finally curses him to stop his rebirth cycle, leaving him using a wheelchair and in a comatose state, which Athena now seeks to revert.

===Dragon ShiryÅ«===

===Cygnus HyÅga===
: {{nihongo||ç½é³¥æåº§ã®æ°·æ²³|Kigunasu no HyÅga}}
: Voice actors: [[KÅichi Hashimoto]], Hiroaki Miura, [[Jason Douglas]] (US version)
: '''Techniques''': Diamond Dust, Kholodnyi SmerÄh (manga only, from ÑÐ¾Ð»Ð¾Ð´Ð½ÑÐ¹ ÑÐ¼ÐµÑÑ, russian for ''Cold Tornado''), Aurora Thunder Attack (anime only), Aurora Execution, KoÄºtso, Freezing Coffin variant.

Cygnus HyÅga, also known as Swan HyÅga in several international adaptations, is one of the main characters in Kurumada's manga. He is the Bronze Saint of the [[Cygnus (constellation)|Cygnus constellation]] and was born in the fictional village of Kohoutek, in eastern [[Siberia]], which, at the time when Kurumada wrote and drew his manga, was in the [[Soviet Union]]. His mastery over his Cosmo grants him superhuman talents, including the ability to create ice and snow at temperatures as low as [[absolute zero]], by stopping subatomic particles. HyÅga is often portrayed wearing a cross and [[rosary]] of the Northern Cross, another name for the constellation Cygnus. Calm by nature, he displays a seemingly emotionless exterior, but a more tender side of his character emerges on occasion, such as his deep gratitude to [[Andromeda Shun]] for having saved his life and his undying devotion to his mentor Aquarius Camus. In Japan, HyÅga is a popular character, ranking second in the main character polls of the Bronze Saints.&lt;ref&gt;''Saint Seiya'' Volume 3, Argentinian Edition, Japanese characters poll&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pegasus Tenma===
: {{nihongo||å¤©é¦¬æåº§ã®å¤©é¦¬|Pegasasu no Tenma|meaning &quot;Heavenly Horse&quot;}}
: '''Techniques:''' Pegasus Meteor Punches

The previous incarnation of [[Pegasus Seiya]], during the 18th century, who is best friends with Alone since childhood, and was trained as the Saint of [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]] by Crateris SuikyÅ. He first met Alone during a snowstorm night in an abandoned shack, where they both sought shelter. Tenma deceived Alone at first so that he could steal his belongings, but was stopped by SuikyÅ. As SuikyÅ decided to kill Tenma for theft, Alone lied and said he had given his bag to Tenma. SuikyÅ was eventually convinced to a degree and told Tenma he was now in debt to Alone, and should therefore guard the boy for the rest of his life.

Years later, escaping with Alone from Libra Dohko and Aries Shion, Tenma discovers Alone's change and vows to protect him, but he does not tell his friend the reason. After realizing he has left behind his Pegasus Cloth during the escape from the Gold Saints, he heads back and equips it and attempts to fight the Gold Saints. He is defeated, and later heads back for Alone, but discovers that he has finally become Hades. He tries to make him remember, though Pandora and some Skeleton soldiers intervene and almost kill him, until Dohko and Shion arrive. The two Saints defeat the small group of Skeletons and interrogate Tenma about his identity and who trained him. He reveals that his master went by the name of Crateris SuikyÅ, which shocks the Gold Saints since they knew him.

Suddenly, a Specter appeared: Celestial Noble Star, Gryphon Vermeer. As Tenma charges towards him, Vermeer stops him with just one finger and easily overpowers him along with Shion and Dohko, due to Hades' barrier. It is then that the Garuda Specter appears and Tenma recognizes his voice as his master SuikyÅ's. The Saints lives are spared in the last minute due to Pandora's summoning of the Specters. The Saints then escape and revitalize themselves with water from the Crateris Cloth. Afterward, Tenma sees a mysterious reflection of his future: Seiya, using a wheelchair.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #6 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 9&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #36+37 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 10&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #38 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 12&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #8 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 1&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #36+37 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 2&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #38 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 3&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #43 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #49 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 5&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #50 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 6&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #51 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #4+5 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 11&quot;&gt;ShÅnen Champion #1 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Kurumada chose the [[furigana|forced reading]] ''Tenma'' for the [[kanji]] that compose his name, instead of the more commonly used ''Tenba'' to avoid redundancy in the complete name of the character. Also, Tenma's name is spelled in kanji in ''Next Dimension'', as opposed to ''[[Saint Seiya Lost Canvas]]'', where it appears spelled in katakana.

Cassios had great respect and affection toward Shaina; however, he realizes that Shaina had affection toward Seiya. Motivated by this, he takes Seiya's place and dies during the fight with [[Leo Aiolia]] in order to wake the Leo Gold Saint from the control of Saga's Dellusional Demon's Emperor Fist. In the anime adaptation, he was also the younger brother of Docrates, an anime-only character.

:Master of Phoenix Ikki during his stance on Death Queen Island. Harsh and heartless, and concealing his features behind a fearsome mask, Guilty employed brutal methods in Ikki's training, to force him to become a being of pure hate, to be able to wield the power of the Phoenix Cloth. Guilty was responsible for Esmeralda's death, and died at the hands of Ikki, as his final trial to become a Saint, not before revealing to Ikki the secret of his birth. Also known as the mysterious Saint, Masami Kurumada never revealed Guilty's destined constellation.

:Voice Actor: [[Chisato Nakajima]]

When Ikki first encountered her, he mistook her for Shun, because she and Shun shared the same facial features with the only differences being hair color and gender. She was killed by Guilty, Ikki's master, in order to provoke Ikki into drawing power from hatred. In the anime adaptation her background is the same, with the addition of being Guilty's daughter.

*'''Kiki'''

*'''Mitsumasa Kido'''
:{{nihongo||åæ¸åæ¿|Kido Mitsumasa}}
:Voice Actor: [[KÅhei Miyauchi]], [[Marty Fleck]] (English)

: Foster-grandfather of Saori who adopted her and took her to Japan after finding a dying Sagittarius Aiolos in Sanctuary. In the manga, it was revealed that he was actually the birth father of all the orphans he sent around the world to be trained as Saints.

Just before he died, he told Saori all the truth regarding the encounter with Aiolos in Sanctuary and her divine origins and purpose of her birth in this era.

*'''Seika'''
:{{nihongo||æè¯|Seika|''Seika'' meaning &quot;Star flower&quot;}}
:Voice Actor: [[Yuriko Yamamoto]], [[Satsuki Yukino]] ''OVA''

: Seiya's older sister, whom he lost contact with when he was sent to Greece to be trained as a Saint. After Seiya was taken away, she wandered the world looking for him. It was long implied that Marin, Seiya's mentor, could be Seika, and some characters, including Seiya, thought it was possibly true. Marin and Seika even shared the same physical characteristics: same age, same birthdate, same height, same birthplace. Also, Marin has a brother she lost and was looking for. Seika resurfaced as a separate character in the Hades chapter, completely amnesiac, after having followed Seiya all the way to Greece alone. It was Seika's voice that, more than any other, urged Seiya on in his fight against Thanatos. It is then revealed in the final arc of Kurumada's manga that Seika and Marin are not the same person.

*'''Shunrei'''
:{{nihongo||æ¥éº|Shunrei}}
:Voice Actor: [[Yumiko Shibata]], [[Eriko Sato]] ''OVA'', [[Ai BandÅ]] ''Elysion OVA'', [[Kimberly Prause]] (English)

:Voice Actor: [[Yuko Nagashima]]

:Lyra OrphÃ©e's lover, she enjoyed great happiness at the Saint's side on Earth, until the day of her untimely death because of a snake bite. Crushed by her demise, OrphÃ©e descended to the Underworld to bargain for her soul with Hades. Touched by the Saint's pleas and melody, she was allowed to return to Earth by the deity, only to be thwarted by Sphinx Pharaoh. She thus was condemned to remain bound to the Underworld half-turned into stone, and later helped Seiya and Shun to unearth OrphÃ©e's seemingly forgotten loyalty to Athena.

*'''Tokumaru Tatsumi'''
:{{nihongo||è¾°å·³ å¾³ä¸¸|Tatsumi Tokumaru}}
:Voice Actor: [[Yukitoshi Hori]], [[Ron Howald]] (English)

:Saori's butler, bodyguard and right-hand man. Trusted man of Mitsumasa Kido and a black belt, third [[Dan (rank)|dan]] in [[KendÅ]]. He was in charge of overseeing the orphans who were to be sent out all over the world to train and become Bronze Saints, and due to his extreme severity and at times downright abusive behavior, most of them were resentful towards him. He always tried to be strong and protect Saori, but even the Sanctuary soldiers can defeat him. (Not without struggle, however, as he offered considerable resistance for an outnumbered man). He starts as a rather daunting and abusive retainer for the future Saints, but he is in truth a man who is honor-bound to protect Saori, and ultimately is the series' [[comic relief]].

*'''Quasimodo'''
:{{nihongo||ã«ã·ã¢ã|Kashimodo}}

:The minor divine spirits in Elysion, who delight Thanatos with their beautiful voice and music.

*'''Alone'''

: Hades' chosen vessel in the 18th century, with the purest soul on earth. Prior to the Holy war, he was best friends with Pegasus Tenma since childhood. He first met Tenma during a snowstorm one night, in an abandoned shack where they both sought refuge. Tenma deceived Alone at first so that he could steal his belongings, but was stopped by SuikyÅ. As SuikyÅ was going to kill Tenma for theft, Alone lied and said he had given his bag to Tenma. SuikyÅ was eventually convinced and told Tenma he was now in debt to Alone and should therefore guard Alone for the rest of his life. At the start of the war, he could feel that darkness was headed his way, and that it came after him. He and Tenma escaped from Libra Dohko and Aries Shion, and ended up outside a small mausoleum. As Tenma went back to retrieve his Cloth, a voice called for Alone inside the mausoleum. As he entered, he found Hades' Sword stuck in the ground. It was then that Pandora showed herself and convinced Alone of grabbing the hilt of the sword. Alone started plunging into darkness and ignored Tenma as he strode towards Hades' Castle.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 8&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 6&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 7&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chapter 11&quot;/&gt;

:The elderly witch of the moon. Kurumada based her on the mythological persona [[Hecate]]. She tricks Athena into cutting off her hair by means of an illusion of multiple pathways to the temple of the moon. She makes a brew with Athena's hair which restores her youth, becoming a young girl again. She then guides Athena to Chronos who in turn punishes her, turning her body into dust.

:Garuda SuikyÅ's younger brother. The Specter is forced to reminisce about him after suffering the effects of Phoenix Ikki's Demonic Illusion Attack. SuishÅ was afflicted by a terminal disease, thus Hades offered SuikyÅ to save his brother's life in exchange of loyalty to him. SuishÅ died shortly after the deity's offering.

He grants Shion and Dohko the rank of Gold Saints and the right to don the Aries and Libra Gold Cloths. He also foresees Hades' return to Earth and prepares Sanctuary to face such event. A false Pope, who swore allegiance to Hades also plays a role in the storyline, whether he and the legitimate Pope are the same person, still remains to be revealed by Kurumada.

===Canonical characters outside the manga===
{{see also|Saint Seiya: The Movie}}

The following characters are considered canonical within the universe of ''Saint Seiya'', as they were all created by Masami Kurumada. They were not introduced in his manga, but instead in the first ''Saint Seiya'' film. Two elements related to them, specifically the Sagitta Cloth and the Lyra Cloth, however, hold indisputable canonical status as they were later integrated by Kurumada into his manga. 

In the [[Musical Theatre|musical]] for theatre ''Saint Seiya: Super Musical'' they returned as antagonists, as the musical is based on the film they appeared in and they are mentioned collectively in the summary of the play available at its official website and the cast portraying them has been revealed.&lt;ref&gt;www.musical-seiya.com The Ghost Saints will appear in the new Saint Seiya musical&lt;/ref&gt;
