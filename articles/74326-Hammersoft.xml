'''Nadia Elena ComÄneci''' ({{IPA-ro|Ënadi.a komÉËnetÍ¡ÊÊ²}}; born November 12, 1961) is a [[Romania]]n [[gymnastics|gymnast]], winner of three [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] gold medals at the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]], and the first female gymnast ever to be awarded a [[perfect 10 (gymnastics)|perfect score of 10]] in an Olympic gymnastic event. She is also the winner of two gold medals at the 1980 Summer Olympics. She is one of the best-known gymnasts in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;infoplease&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/society/A0822234.html|title=Gymnastics|accessdate=September 6, 2007|publisher=infoplease.com|year=2007|author=The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia, 6th ed.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;boa&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.olympics.org.uk/sporthistory.aspx?gt=S&amp;sp=GA Gymnastics history|title=British Olympic Association|accessdate=September 6, 2007|publisher=British Olympic Association|year=2007|author=British Olympic Association}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/olympics/gymnastics/story/2008/05/14/f-olympics-womengymnastics-history.html &quot;Munchkin leads European charge of gymnastics&quot;] CBC sports, June 3, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 ComÄneci was named as one of the athletes of the century by the [[Laureus World Sports Awards|Laureus World Sports Academy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/SPORT/04/29/nadiacomaneci/index.html | work=CNN | title=Nadia Comaneci | date=July 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
ComÄneci was born in Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej (now [[OneÈti]]), [[Romania]], as the daughter of Gheorghe and Ètefania-Alexandrina.&lt;ref name=youngathlete&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/Misc-ComÄneci_YA.html &quot;Olympic Champion Nadia ComÄneci''] ''Young Athlete,'' August 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Her pregnant mother was watching a Russian film in which the heroine's name was [[Nadya]], the [[diminutive]] version of the Russian name ''[[Nadezhda (given name)|Nadezhda]]'' (which means &quot;Hope&quot;). She decided that her daughter would be named Nadia, too. ComÄneci also has a younger brother named Adrian.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early gymnastics career==

Nadia began gymnastics in kindergarten with a local team called &quot;FlacÄra&quot;, with coaches Duncan and Munteanu.&lt;ref name=Fischer&gt;[http://www.gymn.ca/gymnasticgreats/wag/comaneci.htm Whatever Happened to Nadia ComÄneci?] Barbara Fisher and Jennifer Isbister, 2003, Gymnastics Greats.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg.&lt;/ref&gt; At age 6 she was chosen to attend [[BÃ©la KÃ¡rolyi]]'s experimental gymnastics school after Karolyi spotted her and a friend turning [[Cartwheel (gymnastics)|cartwheel]]s in a schoolyard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.com/Articles/Misc-Comaneci_YA.html &quot;Olympic Champion Nadia ComÄneci''] ''Young Athlete,'' August 1978&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 17â19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=si&gt;[http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1091387/2/index.htm &quot;Nadia Awed Ya''] Frank Deford, ''Sports Illustrated,'' August 2, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;  Nadia was training with the KÃ¡rolyis by the time she was 7 years old, in 1968. She was one of the first students at the gymnastics school established in OneÈti by BÃ©la and his wife, Marta.  Unlike many of the other students at the KÃ¡rolyi school, ComÄneci was able to commute from home for many years because she lived in the area.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadia placed 13th in her first Romanian National Championships in 1969. A year later, in 1970, she began competing as a member of her hometown team and became the youngest gymnast ever to win the Romanian Nationals.&lt;ref name=youngathlete/&gt; In 1971, she participated in her first international competition, a dual junior meet between Romania and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], winning her first [[List of gymnastics terms#A|all-around]] title and contributing to the team [[Gold medal|gold]]. For the next few years, she competed as a junior in numerous national contests in Romania and additional dual meets with nearby countries such as [[Hungary]], [[Italy]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;List of competitive results&quot;&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/bios/women/comaneci.html List of competitive results] Gymn-Forum&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 11, in 1973, she won the all-around gold, as well as the [[Vault (gymnastics)|vault]] and [[uneven bars]] titles, at the Junior Friendship Tournament (Druzhba), an important meet for junior gymnasts.&lt;ref name=&quot;List of competitive results&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 27â28&lt;/ref&gt;

Nadia first major international success came at the age of 13, when she nearly swept the 1975 European Championships in [[Skien]], [[Norway]], winning the all-around and gold medals on every event but the [[Floor (gymnastics)|floor exercise]], in which she placed second. She continued to enjoy success in other meets in 1975, winning the all-around at the &quot;Champions All&quot; competition and placing first in the all-around, vault, [[Balance beam|beam]], and bars at the Romanian National Championships. In the Pre-Olympic test event in [[Montreal]], ComÄneci won the all-around and the balance beam golds, as well as [[Silver medal|silver]]s in the vault, floor, and bars behind accomplished Soviet gymnast [[Nellie Kim]], who would prove to be one of her greatest [[Sports rivalry|rival]]s over the next five years.&lt;ref name=&quot;List of competitive results&quot;/&gt;

In March 1976, ComÄneci competed in the inaugural edition of the [[American Cup (Gymnastics)|American Cup]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in [[New York City|New York]]. She received unprecedented scores of 10.0, which signified a perfect routine without any deductions, on vault in both the preliminary and final rounds of competition and won the all-around.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/NYT-1976_AmCup2.html &quot;Gymnast Posts Perfect Mark&quot;] Robin Herman, ''[[New York Times]],'' March 28, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; ComÄneci also received 10s in other meets in 1976, including the prestigious [[Chunichi Cup]] competition in [[Japan]], where she posted perfect marks on the vault and uneven bars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/results/CCup/Women/1976.html Scores for 1976 Chunichi Cup] Gymn-Forum&lt;/ref&gt;

The international community took note of ComÄneci: she was named the [[United Press International]]'s &quot;Female Athlete of the Year&quot; for 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI Athletes of the Year&quot;&gt;[http://www.hickoksports.com/history/upiaoy.shtml UPI Athletes of the Year]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montreal Olympics==
At the age of 14, ComÄneci became one of the stars of the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in [[Montreal]]. During the team portion of the competition on July 18, her routine on the uneven bars was scored at a 10.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usghof.org/files/bio/n_comaneci/n_comaneci.html|title=Biography: COMANECI, Nadia|publisher=U.S. Gymnastics Hall of Fame|accessdate=17 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first time in modern Olympic gymnastics history that the score had ever been awarded. The scoreboards were not even equipped to display scores of 10.0âso Nadia's perfect marks were reported on the boards as 1.00 instead.&lt;ref name=&quot;Still A Perfect 10&quot;&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/upload/news/olympic_review/review_2005628172259_UK.pdf &quot;Still A Perfect 10&quot;] ''Olympic Review,'' Paul Ziert, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Over the course of the Olympics, ComÄneci would earn six additional 10s, en route to capturing the all-around, beam, and bars titles and a [[bronze medal]] on the floor exercise. The Romanian team also placed second in the team competition.&lt;ref name= &quot;InterGym&quot;&gt;[http://www.intlgymnast.com/legends/comaneci.html Legends: Nadia ComÄneci] ''International Gymnast'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

ComÄneci was the first Romanian gymnast to win the all-around title at the Olympics. She also holds the record as the youngest Olympic gymnastics all-around champion ever; with the revised age-eligibility requirements in the sport (gymnasts must now turn 16 in the calendar year to compete in the Olympics; in 1976 gymnasts had to be 14 by the first day of the competition&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aafla.org/OlympicInformationCenter/OlympicReview/1980/ore155/ORE155p.pdf &quot;Within the International Federations&quot;] (PDF). ''Olympic Review,'' 1980&lt;/ref&gt;), it is currently not possible to legally break this record.&lt;!--Based on the decisions of the FIG, which has moved the age limits up three times since 1980 and wants to change it to 18, it's very, very unlikely 14 year olds will ever be allowed at the Olympics again, but we'll leave out the &quot;never&quot; for now --&gt;

ComÄneci's achievements at the Olympics generated a significant amount of media attention. An instrumental piece from the musical score of the 1971 film ''[[Bless the Beasts and Children (film)|Bless the Beasts and Children]]'', &quot;Cotton's Dream&quot; (which was also used as the title theme music from the American [[soap opera]] ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'') became associated with her after cinematographer/feature reporter [[Robert Riger]] used it against slow-motion montages of Nadia on the television program [[Wide World of Sports (US TV series)|ABC's Wide World Of Sports]]. The song became a top ten single in the fall of 1976, and the composers, [[Barry De Vorzon]] and [[Perry Botkin, Jr.]], renamed it to &quot;[[Nadia's Theme]]&quot; after her.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olympic.org/uk/athletes/profiles/bio_uk.asp?PAR_I_ID=44503 &quot;Nadia ComÄneci: The Perfect 10&quot;] International Olympic Committee (IOC) website&lt;/ref&gt; However, ComÄneci never actually performed to &quot;Nadia's Theme.&quot; Her floor exercise music was a medley of the songs &quot;[[Yes Sir, That's My Baby]]&quot; and &quot;[[Jump in the Line]]&quot; arranged for piano.&lt;ref name=si /&gt; Nadia ComÄneci's achievements are also pictured in the entrance area of the Madison Square Garden in New York City presenting her perfect 10.00 beam-exercise.

She was the 1976 BBC Sports Personality of the Year in the overseas athletes category&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/keyfacts/stories/spoty_overseas.shtml List of winners, BBC Sports Personality of the Year (Overseas)] BBC press office&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Associated Press]]'s 1976 &quot;Female Athlete of the Year&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encarta.msn.com/media_701500051_761551983_-1_1/Associated_Press_Athletes_of_the_Year.html Associated Press Athletes of the Year] MSN Encarta. [http://www.webcitation.org/5kx7iDzto Archived] 2009-11-01.&lt;/ref&gt; She also retained her title as the UPI Female Athlete of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;UPI Athletes of the Year&quot;/&gt; Back home in Romania, ComÄneci's success led her to be named a &quot;[[Hero of Socialist Labor]]&quot;; she was the youngest Romanian to receive such recognition during the administration of [[Nicolae CeauÅescu]].&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

== 1977â1980 ==
ComÄneci successfully defended her European all-around title in 1977, but when questions about the scoring were raised, CeauÅescu ordered the Romanian gymnasts to return home. The team followed orders and controversially walked out of the competition during the event finals.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 61â62&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 1977 Europeans, the Romanian Gymnastics Federation removed ComÄneci from her longtime coaches, the KÃ¡rolyis, and sent her to [[Bucharest]] to train at the 23 August sports complex. The change was not positive for ComÄneci. Grappling with both the stress of her parents' divorce and the new training environment, she was extremely unhappy and her gymnastics and overall fitness suffered.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 64â68&lt;/ref&gt; Heavier and out-of-shape, ComÄneci competed in the [[1978 World Artistic Gymnastics Championships|1978 World Championships]]. A fall from the uneven bars resulted in a 4th place finish in the all-around behind [[Elena Mukhina]], Nellie Kim, and [[Natalia Shaposhnikova]], but ComÄneci won the beam title.

After the 1978 Worlds, ComÄneci was permitted to return to Deva and to the KÃ¡rolyis.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 68â72&lt;/ref&gt; In 1979, a newly slim and motivated ComÄneci won her third consecutive European all-around title, becoming the first gymnast, male or female, to achieve the feat. At the [[1979 World Championships in Artistic Gymnastics|World Championships]] that December, ComÄneci led the field after the compulsory competition but was hospitalized before the optional portion of the team competition for blood poisoning caused by a cut in her wrist from her metal grip buckle. Against doctors' orders, she left the hospital and competed on the beam, where she scored a 9.95. Her performance helped give the Romanians their first team gold medal. After her performance, ComÄneci spent several days recovering in All Saints Hospital and underwent a minor surgical procedure for the infected hand, which had developed an [[abscess]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/Misc-Comaneci-1979.html &quot;Nadia.&quot;] ''The Epistle,'' (All Saints Episcopal Hospital), January 1980&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 87â91&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Little Girls in Pretty Boxes.'' Ryan, Joan. 1995, Doubleday. ISBN 0-385-47790-2&lt;/ref&gt;

ComÄneci participated in the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, where she placed second, by a small margin, to [[Yelena Davydova]]. She defended her Olympic title in the balance beam and tied with [[Nellie Kim]] for the gold medal in the floor exercise. The Romanian team finished second overall.

ComÄneci retired from competition in 1981. Her official retirement ceremony took place in Bucharest in 1984 and was attended by the [[International Olympic Committee]] Chairman.&lt;ref name=&quot;Still A Perfect 10&quot;/&gt;

==Post retirement==

In 1981, ComÄneci participated in a gymnastics exhibition tour in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gymn-forum.net/Articles/NYT-1981_Comaneci_Tour.html &quot;Miss ComÄneci, 19, Makes Fresh Start&quot;]. Ira Berkow, ''New York Times,'' March 6, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour, her coaches, BÃ©la and Marta KÃ¡rolyi, along with the Romanian team choreographer GÃ©za PozsÃ¡r, defected.&lt;ref&gt;''Little Girls in Pretty Boxes.'' Ryan, Joan. 1995, Doubleday. ISBN 0-385-47790-2 pg. 201&lt;/ref&gt; Upon her return to Romania, ComÄneci's actions were strictly monitored. She was granted leave to attend the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles]] but was supervised for the entire trip. Aside from that journey, and a few select trips to Moscow and Cuba, ComÄneci was forbidden to leave the country for any reason.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Still A Perfect 10&quot;/&gt; &quot;Life...&quot; she wrote in her autobiography, &quot;took on a new bleakness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

In Romania, between 1984 and 1989, ComÄneci was a member of the Romanian Gymnastics Federation and helped coach the Romanian junior gymnasts. In November 1989, a few weeks before the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|revolution]], she defected with a group of other young Romanians. Her overland journey took her through Hungary, Austria, and finally, to the United States.&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;&lt;ref name= &quot;InterGym&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Letters to a Young Gymnast''. ComÄneci, Nadia. 2004, Basic Books. ISBN 0-465-01276-0 pg. 137â148&lt;/ref&gt; Her initial arrival in the United States generated some negative press, focusing on her penchant for heavy makeup and flashy clothes, and the fact that her constant companion Constantin Panait (a Romanian exile who arranged her escape from Romania and initially exercised considerable control over her as her self-appointed business manager) was a married father of four.&lt;ref name = &quot;Escaping&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Schneider | first = Karen S.  | authorlink =

With the help of her former coach BÃ©la KÃ¡rolyi and his friend Alexandru Stefu, a Romanian rugby coach, ComÄneci was able to make a break with Panait and settle in Montreal.&lt;ref name = &quot;Escaping&quot;/&gt; She successfully distanced herself from the image problems of her initial arrival from Romania. ComÄneci spent most of her time touring and promoting lines of gymnastics apparel and aerobic equipment. She also dabbled in modeling, appearing in advertisements for wedding dresses and Jockey underwear.&lt;ref name= &quot;InterGym&quot; /&gt;

While she was living in Montreal, [[Bart Conner]], whom she had met for the first time in 1976 at the American Cup, contacted her and invited her to live in Oklahoma. They became engaged in 1994. Together with Conner, she returned to Romania for the first time since her defection (and since the [[fall of Communism]] and [[Nicolae CeauÈescu|CeauÅescu]]'s death), and the couple were married in Bucharest on April 27, 1996. The ceremony was broadcast live in Romania, and the reception was held in the former presidential palace.&lt;ref name= &quot;InterGym&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-72893201.html &quot;Nadia Tumbles over Wedding&quot;] ''Cincinnati Post,'' April 6, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2001, ComÄneci became a [[naturalized citizen]] of the United States. She has also retained her Romanian passport, making her a [[dual citizen]].&lt;ref name=Fischer/&gt;

In December 2003, ComÄneci's book ''[[Art of Mentoring|Letters To A Young Gymnast]]'' was published, a combination of mentoring book and memoir. The book answered questions that she has received in letters from fans. She has also been the subject of several unofficial biographies, television documentaries and a made-for-television film, ''Nadia,'' that was broadcast in the United States shortly before the 1984 Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0087774/ Nadia at the IMDB]&lt;/ref&gt;

ComÄneci and Conner welcomed their first child, a son named Dylan Paul Conner, on June 3, 2006 in [[Oklahoma City]], [[Oklahoma]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,198443,00.html &quot;Nadia ComÄneci, Bart Conner Welcome Baby Boy&quot;] Associated Press, June 6, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.jurnalul.ro/articol.php?id=60535 &quot;Former Gymnasts Nadia ComÄneci and Bart Conner Baptized Their First Child, Dylan Paul&quot;] Catalina Iancu, ''Jurnalul National,'' August 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
