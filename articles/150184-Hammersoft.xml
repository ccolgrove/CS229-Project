'''Ashkenazi Jews''', also known as '''Ashkenazic Jews''' or '''Ashkenazim''' ({{lang-he-n|×Ö·×©Ö°××Ö²Ö¼× Ö¸×Ö´××}}, {{IPA-he|ËaÊkÉËnazim|pron}}, singular: {{IPA|[ËaÊkÉËnazi]}}; also {{lang|he|×Ö°××Ö¼×Öµ× ×Ö·×©Ö°××Ö²Ö¼× Ö¸×}}, ''Y'hudey Ashkenaz'', &quot;the Jews of Ashkenaz&quot;), are the [[Jews]] descended from the [[medieval]] [[Jewish ethnic divisions|Jewish communities]] along the [[Rhine]] in Germany from [[Alsace]] in the south to the [[Rhineland]] in the north. ''Ashkenaz'' is the [[medieval Hebrew]] name for this region and thus for Germany. Thus, ''Ashkenazim'' or ''Ashkenazi Jews'' are literally &quot;[[German Jews]].&quot; Later, Jews from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] came to be called &quot;Ashkenaz&quot; because the main centers of Jewish learning were located in Germany. [[Ashkenaz]] is also a [[Japhetic]] [[patriarch]] in the [[Table of Nations]] ([[s:Bible (King James)/Genesis#Chapter 10|Genesis 10]]).

Many Ashkenazi Jews later migrated, largely eastward, forming communities in non German-speaking areas, including [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Belarus]], [[Lithuania]], [[Russia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Eastern Europe]], and elsewhere between the 11th and 19th centuries. With them, they took and diversified [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], a [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] language with [[Hebrew]] influence, written in Hebrew letters. It had developed in medieval times as the ''[[lingua franca]]'' among Ashkenazi Jews. The Jewish communities of three cities along the Rhine: [[Jewish community of Speyer|Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] and [[Mainz]], created the SHUM league (SHUM after the first Hebrew letters of Shpira, Vermayza, and Magentza). The [[ShUM-cities]] are considered the cradle of the distinct Ashkenazi culture and [[liturgy]]. 

Although in the 11th century, they composed only three percent of the world's [[Jewish population]], at their peak in 1931, Ashkenazi Jews accounted for 92 percent of the world's Jews.  Today they make up approximately 80 percent of Jews worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;sephardic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/dje/articles3/sephardic.htm|title=Can Sephardic Judaism be Reconstructed?|publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs|first=Daniel J.|last=Elazar|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most Jewish communities with extended histories in Europe are Ashkenazim, with the exception of those associated with the [[Mediterranean]] region. The majority of the Jews who migrated from Europe to other continents in the past two centuries are Ashkenazim, [[Eastern Yiddish|Eastern Ashkenazim]] in particular.

==Definition==
The [[Who is a Jew?|exact definition of Jewishness]] is not universally agreed uponâneither by religious scholars (especially across different [[Jewish denominations|denominations]]); nor in the context of politics (as applied to those who wish to make [[Aliyah]]); nor even in the conventional, everyday sense where &quot;Jewishness&quot; may be loosely understood by the casual observer as encompassing both religious and [[secular Jew]]s, or religious Jews alone. This makes it especially difficult to define who is an Ashkenazi Jew.  The people have been defined differently from religious, cultural, or ethnic perspectives.  

Since the overwhelming majority of Ashkenazi Jews no longer live in Eastern Europe, the isolation that once favored a distinct religious tradition and culture has vanished. Furthermore, the word ''Ashkenazi'' is being used in non-traditional ways, especially in [[Israel]]. By conservative and orthodox philosophies, a person can be considered a Jew only if his or her mother was Jewish (meaning, more specifically, either matrilineal descent from a female believed to be present at Mt. Sinai when the ten commandments were given, or else descent from a female who was converted to Judaism before the birth of her children), or if  he or she has personally converted to Judaism. This means that a person can be Ashkenazi but not considered a Jew by some of those within the Jewish communities, making the term &quot;Ashkenazi&quot; more applicable as broad ethnicity which evolved from the practice of Judaism in Europe.

===By religion===

Religious Jews have [[Minhag]]im, customs, in addition to [[Halakha]], or religious law, and different interpretations of law. Different groups of religious Jews in different geographic areas historically adopted different customs and interpretations.  On certain issues, Orthodox Jews are required to follow the customs of their ancestors, and do not believe they have the option of picking and choosing. For this reason, observant Jews at times find it important for religious reasons to ascertain who their household's religious ancestors are in order to know what customs their household should follow. These times include, for example, when two Jews of different ethnic background marry, when a non-Jew converts to Judaism and determines what customs to follow for the first time, or when a lapsed or less observant Jew returns to traditional Judaism and must determine what was done in his or her family's past.  In this sense, &quot;Ashkenazic&quot; refers both to a family ancestry and to a body of customs binding on Jews of that ancestry.

In a religious sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is any Jew whose family tradition and ritual follows Ashkenazi practice. Until the Ashkenazi community first began to develop in the [[Early Middle Ages]], the centers of Jewish religious authority were in the Islamic world, at [[Baghdad]] and in Islamic Spain. Ashkenaz (Germany) was so distant geographically that it developed a ''[[minhag]]'' of its own.  Ashkenazi Hebrew came to be pronounced in ways distinct from other forms of Hebrew.

In this respect, the counterpart of Ashkenazi is [[Sephardic]], since most non-Ashkenazi Orthodox Jews follow Sephardic rabbinical authorities, whether or not they are ethnically Sephardic. By tradition, a Sephardic or [[Mizrahi]] woman who marries into an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] or [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Ashkenazi Jewish family raises her children to be Ashkenazi Jews; conversely an Ashkenazi woman who marries a [[Sephardi]] or Mizrahi man is expected to take on Sephardic practice and the children inherit a Sephardic identity, though in practice many families compromise. A [[Conversion to Judaism|convert]] generally follows the practice of the [[beth din]] that converted him or her.

With the integration of Jews from around the world in [[Israel]], North America, and other places, the religious definition of an Ashkenazi Jew is blurring, especially outside [[Orthodox Judaism]]. Many Sephardic and Mizrahi Jews have joined liberal movements that originally developed within Ashkenazi Judaism. In recent decades, the congregations which they have joined have often embraced them, and absorbed new traditions into their ''minhag''. [[Rabbi]]s and [[Hazzan|cantors]] in most non-Orthodox movements study [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in [[Israel]], where they learn Sephardic rather than Ashkenazi Hebrew pronunciation.  Ashkenazi congregations are adopting Sephardic or modern Israeli melodies for many prayers and traditional songs. Since the middle of the 20th century, there has been a gradual [[syncretism]] and fusion of traditions. This is affecting the ''[[minhag]]'' of all but the most traditional congregations. 

New developments in Judaism often transcend differences in religious practice between Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jews. In North American cities, social trends such as the [[chavurah|chavurah movement]], and the emergence of &quot;post-denominational Judaism&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rosenthal, Rachel |title=What's in a name? |journal=Kedma |year=2006 |issue=Winter 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Greenberg, Richard and Debra Nussbaum Cohen |url=http://jewschool.com/THE_NEW_JEW.pdf |title=Uncovering the Un-Movement |year=2005|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; often bring together younger Jews of diverse ethnic backgrounds. In recent years, there has been increased interest in ''[[Kabbalah]]'', which many Ashkenazi Jews study outside of the [[Yeshiva]] framework. Another trend is the new popularity of [[ecstatic]] worship in the [[Jewish Renewal]] movement and the [[Shlomo Carlebach|Carlebach]] style [[minyan]], both of which are nominally of Ashkenazi origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kehilathadar.org/Aboutus/forward08-10-01.html|date=August 10, 2001|title=Any Old Shul Won't Do for the Young and Cool|first=Rachel|last=Donadio|accessdate=2006-05-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061007113608/http://www.kehilathadar.org/Aboutus/forward08-10-01.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===By culture===
Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of ''[[Yiddishkeit]]'', which means âJewishnessâ in the [[Yiddish language]]. ''Yiddishkeit'' is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. 

Before the [[Haskalah]] and the [[Jewish Emancipation|emancipation of Jews]] in Europe, this meant the study of [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]] for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the [[Rhineland]] to [[Riga]] to [[Romania]], most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives.

But with modernization, ''Yiddishkeit'' now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and [[Hasidism]], but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, ''Yiddishkeit'' can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association. Broadly speaking, a Jew is one who associates culturally with Jews, supports Jewish institutions, reads Jewish books and periodicals, attends Jewish movies and theater, travels to Israel, visits ancient synagogues in [[Prague]], and so forth. It is a definition that applies to Jewish culture in general, and to Ashkenazi Yiddishkeit in particular.

Contemporary population migrations have contributed to a reconfigured Jewishness among Jews of Ashkenazi descent that transcends Yiddishkeit and other traditional articulations of Ashkenazi Jewishness. As Ashkenazi Jews moved away from Eastern Europe, settling mostly in Israel, North America, and other English-speaking areas, the geographic isolation that gave rise to Ashkenazim has given way to mixing with other cultures, and with non-Ashkenazi Jews who, similarly, are no longer isolated in distinct geographic locales. For Ashkenazi Jews living in Eastern Europe, chopped liver and [[gefilte fish]] were archetypal Jewish foods. To contemporary Ashkenazi Jews living both in [[Israel]] and in the [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora]], Middle Eastern foods such as [[hummus]] and [[falafel]], neither traditional to the historic Ashkenazi experience, have become central to their lives as Ashkenazi Jews in the current era. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] has replaced Yiddish as the primary [[Jewish language]] for many Ashkenazi Jews, although many [[Hasidic]] and [[Hareidi]] groups continue to use Yiddish in daily life. 

France's blended Jewish community is typical of the cultural recombination that is going on among Jews throughout the world. Although France expelled its original Jewish population in the [[Middle Ages]], by the time of the [[French Revolution]], there were two distinct Jewish populations.  One consisted of Sephardic Jews, originally refugees from the [[Inquisition]] and concentrated in the southwest, while the other community was Ashkenazi, concentrated in formerly German [[Alsace]], and speaking mainly Yiddish. The two communities were so separate and different that the [[National Assembly (French Revolution)|National Assembly]] emancipated them separately in 1791. 

But after emancipation, a sense of a unified French Jewry emerged, especially when France was wracked by the [[Dreyfus affair]] in the 1890s. In the 1920s and 1930s, Ashkenazi Jews from eastern Europe arrived in large numbers as refugees from [[antisemitism]], the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian revolution]], and the economic turmoil of the [[Great Depression]]. By the 1930s, [[Paris]] had a vibrant Yiddish culture, and many Jews were involved in radical political movements. After the [[Vichy France|Vichy]] years and the [[Holocaust]], the French Jewish population was augmented once again, first by refugees from Eastern Europe, and later by immigrants and refugees from North Africa, many of them [[francophone]].

Then, in the 1990s, yet another Ashkenazi Jewish wave began to arrive from countries of the former [[Soviet Union]] and Eastern Europe. The result is a pluralistic Jewish community that still has some distinct elements of both Ashkenazi and Sephardic culture. But in France, it is becoming much more difficult to sort out the two, and a distinctly French Jewishness has emerged.&lt;ref&gt;Wall, Irwin. (2002) &quot;Remaking Jewish Identity in France&quot;, in Howard Wettstein, ''Diaspora's and Exiles''. University of California Press, pages 164-190.&lt;/ref&gt;

===By ethnicity===
In an ethnic sense, an Ashkenazi Jew is one whose ancestry can be traced to the Jews of Central and Eastern Europe. For roughly a thousand years, the Ashkenazim were a reproductively isolated population in Europe, despite living in many countries, with little inflow or outflow from migration, conversion, or intermarriage with other groups, including other Jews. Human geneticists have identified genetic variations that have high frequencies among Ashkenazi Jews, but not in the general European population. This is true for patrilineal markers ([[Y-chromosome]] [[haplotype]]s) as well as for matrilineal markers ([[mitochondrion|mitotypes]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html &quot;New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe&quot;], ''New York Times'', 14 Jan 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the middle of the 20th century, many Ashkenazi Jews have intermarried, both with members of other Jewish communities and with people of other nations and faiths, while some Jews have also adopted children from other ethnic groups or parts of the world and raised them as Jews. Conversion to Judaism, rare for nearly 2,000 years, has become more common. 

A 2006 study found Ashkenazi Jews to be a clear, relatively homogeneous genetic subgroup.  Strikingly, regardless of the place of origin, Ashkenazi Jews can be grouped in the same genetic cohort â that is, regardless of whether an Ashkenazi Jew's ancestors came from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Lithuania, or any other place with a historical Jewish population, they belong to the same ethnic group. The research demonstrates the endogamy of the Jewish population in Europe and lends further credence to the idea of Ashkenazi Jews as an ethnic group. Moreover, though intermarriage among Jews of Ashkenazi descent has become increasingly more common, many Ultra-Orthodox Jews, particularly members of Hasidic or Hareidi sects, continue to marry exclusively fellow Ashkenazi Jews. This trend keeps Ashkenazi genes prevalent and also helps researchers further study the genes of Ashkenazi Jews with relative ease.  It is noteworthy that these Ultra-Orthodox Jews often have extremely large families.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.0020143#pgen-0020143-g003&lt;/ref&gt;

===Realignment in Israel===
In Israel, the term ''Ashkenazi'' is now used in ways that have nothing to do with its original meaning; it is often applied to all Jews of European background living in Israel, including sometimes for those whose ethnic background is actually Sephardic.  Jews of any non-Ashkenazi background, including Mizrahi, Yemenite, Kurdish and others who have no connection with the [[Iberian Peninsula]], have similarly come to be lumped together as Sephardic. Jews of mixed background are increasingly common, partly because of intermarriage between Ashkenazi and non-Ashkenazi, and partly because many do not see such historic markers as relevant to their life experiences as Jews. 

Religious Ashkenazi Jews living in Israel are obliged to follow the authority of the chief Ashkenazi rabbi in [[halakha|halakhic]] matters. In this respect, a religiously Ashkenazi Jew is an Israeli who is more likely to support certain religious interests in Israel, including certain political parties.  These political parties result from the fact that a portion of the Israeli electorate votes for Jewish religious parties; although the electoral map changes from one election to another, there are generally several small parties associated with the interests of religious Ashkenazi Jews.  The role of religious parties, including small religious parties which play important roles as coalition members, results in turn from Israel's composition as a complex society in which competing social, economic, and religious interests stand for election to the [[Knesset]], a unicameral legislature with 120 seats.

==History==
===History of Jews in Europe before the Ashkenazim===
Although the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|historical record]] is very limited, there is a scholarly consensus of cultural, linguistic, and genetic evidence that the Ashkenazi Jewish population originated in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=&quot;Atzmon2010&quot; /&gt; Jews have lived in Germany, or &quot;Ashkenaz&quot;, at least since the early 4th century. They brought with them both [[Rabbinic Judaism]] and the Babylonian Talmudic culture that underlies it. [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]], once spoken by the vast majority of Ashkenazi Jewry, is a [[Germanic languages|Germanic language]] that developed from the [[Middle High German]] vernacular, written with Hebrew characters, and heavily influenced by [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]].

After the Roman empire had overpowered the Jewish resistance in the [[First JewishâRoman War]] in [[Judea]] and destroyed the Jewish [[Second Temple|Temple]] in [[Jerusalem]] in 70 CE, the complete Roman takeover of Judea followed the [[Bar Kochba rebellion]] of 132-135 CE.  Though their numbers were greatly reduced, Jews continued to populate large parts of Iudaea province (renamed to Palaestina), remaining a majority in Galilee for several hundred years.  However, the Romans no longer recognized the authority of the [[Sanhedrin]] or any other Jewish body, and Jews were prohibited from living in Jerusalem. Outside the Roman Empire, a large Jewish community remained in [[Mesopotamia]]. Other Jewish populations could be found dispersed around the Mediterranean region, with the largest concentrations in the [[Levant]], [[Egypt]], [[Asia Minor]], [[Greece]], and [[Italy]], including [[Rome]]. Smaller communities are recorded in southern [[Gaul]] (France), Spain, and [[North Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Imperialism and Jewish Society, 200 BCE to 640 CE |author=Schwartz, Seth |year=2001 |publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0-691-11781-0 |pages=103â128 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jews were denied full Roman citizenship until 212 CE, when Emperor [[Caracalla]] granted all free peoples this privilege.  But, as a penalty for the [[First Jewish-Roman War|first Jewish Revolt]], Jews were required to pay a [[poll tax]] until the reign of Emperor [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in 363. In the late Roman Empire, Jews were free to form networks of cultural and religious ties and enter into various local occupations.  But, after Christianity became the official religion of [[Rome]] and [[Constantinople]] in 380, Jews were increasingly marginalized, and brutally persecuted. 

In Syria-Palaestina and Mesopotamia, where Jewish religious scholarship was centered, the majority of Jews were still engaged in farming, as demonstrated by the preoccupation of early Talmudic writings with agriculture. In [[diaspora]] communities, trade was a common occupation, facilitated by the easy mobility of traders through the dispersed Jewish communities. 

Throughout this period and into the early Middle Ages, some Jews assimilated into the dominant Greek and Latin cultures, mostly through conversion to [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Beginnings of Jewishness|author=Shaye J. D. Cohen |year=2001 |publisher=[[University of California Press]] |isbn=0-520-22693-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Syria-Palaestina and Mesopotamia, the spoken language of Jews continued to be [[Aramaic]], but elsewhere in the diaspora, most Jews spoke Greek. Conversion and assimilation were especially common within the Hellenized or Greek-speaking Jewish communities, amongst whom the [[Septuagint]] and [[Aquila of Sinope]] (Greek translations and adaptations of the [[Tanakh]] or Hebrew Bible) were the source of scripture. A remnant of this Greek-speaking Jewish population (the [[Romaniotes]]) survives to this day.

In the late Roman Empire, Jews are known to have lived in [[Cologne]] and [[Trier]], as well as in what is now France. However, it is unclear whether there is any continuity between these late Roman communities and the distinct Ashkenazi Jewish culture that began to emerge about 500 years later. King [[Dagobert I]] of the [[Franks]] expelled the Jews from his [[Merovingian]] kingdom in 629. Jews in former Roman territories now faced new challenges as harsher anti-Jewish Church rulings were enforced.

In Mesopotamia, and in Persian lands free of Roman imperial domination, Jewish life fared much better. Since the conquest of [[Judea]] by [[Nebuchadnezzar II]], this community had always been the leading [[diaspora]] community, a rival to the leadership of Judea.  After conditions for Jews began to deteriorate in Roman-controlled lands, many of the religious leaders of [[Judea]] and the [[Galilee]] fled to the east. At the academies of [[Pumbeditha]] and [[Sura (city)|Sura]] near Babylon, [[Rabbinic Judaism]] based on [[Talmud]]ic learning began to emerge and assert its authority over Jewish life throughout the diaspora. Rabbinic Judaism created a religious mandate for literacy, requiring all Jewish males to learn Hebrew and read from the Torah.  It has been suggested that this mandate led to a higher literacy rate for Jewish minorities in both Christian and Islamic lands compared to the majority of gentiles, a result which gave these Jews a comparative advantage in urban commercial and financial roles which, to some extent, may explain their relative prevalence in these fields at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Botticini|first=M.|coauthors=Eckstein, Z.|title=From Farmers to Merchants: A Human Capital Interpretation of Jewish Economic History|journal=CEPR Discussion Papers|year=2003|month=January|issue=3718|url=http://www.econ.barnard.columbia.edu/~econhist/papers/Botticini_Eckstein_HumCap.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the Islamic conquest of the Middle East and North Africa, new opportunities for trade and commerce opened between the Middle East and Western Europe. The vast majority of Jews now lived in Islamic lands. Urbanization, trade, and commerce within the Islamic world allowed Jews, as a highly literate people, to abandon farming and live in cities, engaging in occupations where they could use their skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ideas.repec.org/p/cpr/ceprdp/5571.html|title=From Farmers to Merchants, Voluntary Conversions and Diaspora: A Human Capital Interpretation of Jewish History|last=Botticini|first=Maristella|coauthors=Zvi Eckstein|month=March | year=2006|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The influential, sophisticated, and well organized Jewish community of Mesopotamia, now centered in Baghdad, became the center of the Jewish world. In the Caliphate of Baghdad, Jews took on many of the financial occupations that they would later hold in the cities of Ashkenaz. Jewish traders from Baghdad began to travel to the west, renewing Jewish life in the western Mediterranean region.  They brought with them Rabbinic Judaism and Babylonian [[Talmud]]ic scholarship. 

[[Charlemagne|Charlemagne's]] expansion of the Frankish empire around 800, including northern Italy and Rome, brought on a brief period of stability and unity in Western Europe. This created opportunities for Jewish merchants to settle once again north of the Alps. Charlemagne granted the Jews freedoms similar to those once enjoyed under the [[Roman Empire]]. In addition, Jews from southern Italy, fleeing religious persecution, began to move into central Europe. These Jews carried with them, the [[Haplogroup G2c (Y-DNA)]] which now accounts for the largest haplogroup within the Ashkenazi population. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isogg.org/tree/ISOGG_HapgrpG.html www.isogg.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Returning once again to Frankish lands, many Jewish merchants took on occupations in finance and commerce, including money lending, or [[usury]]. (Church legislation banned Christians from lending money in exchange for [[interest]].) From Charlemagne's time to the present, there is a well-documented record of Jewish life in northern Europe, and by the 11th century, when [[Rashi]] of [[Troyes]] wrote his commentaries, Ashkenazi Jews had emerged also as interpreters and commentators on the [[Torah]] and [[Talmud]].

===High and Late Middle Ages migrations===
Historical records show evidence of Jewish communities north of the [[Alps]] and [[Pyrenees]] as early as the 8th and 9th century. By the end of the first millennium, Jewish populations were well-established in [[Western Europe]], later followed the [[Norman Conquest]] into England in 1066, and settled in many cities of the Rhine area by the end of the 11th century. 

Although the Jewish people in general were present across a wide geographical area as described, genetic research done by Gil Atzmon of the Longevity Genes Project at [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] suggests &quot;that Ashkenazim branched off from other Jews around the time of the destruction of the First Temple, 2,500 years ago. . flourished during the Roman Empire but then went through a 'severe bottleneck' as they dispersed, reducing a population of several million to just 400 families who left Northern Italy around the year 1000 for Central and eventually Eastern Europe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;What Do a Bunch of Old Jews Know About Living Forever?by Jesse Green. ''New York Magazine''. Published Nov 6, 2011&lt;sup&gt;[http://nymag.com/print/?/news/features/ashkenazi-jews-2011-11/]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

With the onset of the [[Crusades]], and the expulsions from England (1290), France (1394), and parts of Germany (15th century), Jewish migration pushed eastward into [[Poland]], [[Grand Duchy of Lithuania|Lithuania]], and [[Russia]]. Over this period of several hundred years, some have suggested, Jewish economic activity was focused on trade, business management, and financial services, due to several presumed factors:  [[Christian]] European prohibitions restricting certain activities by Jews, preventing certain financial activities (such as &quot;[[usury|usurious]]&quot; loans)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Hayim |last=Ben-Sasson |title=A History of the Jewish People |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1976 |isbn=0674397304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; between Christians, high rates of literacy, near universal male education, and ability of merchants to rely upon and trust family members living in different regions and countries.  

[[Image:Rzeczpospolita.png|thumb|right|200px|The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth at its greatest extent.]]

By the 15th century, the Ashkenazi Jewish communities in [[Poland]] were the largest Jewish communities of the [[Diaspora]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashkenazim&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/Ashkenazim.html|title=Ashkenazim|first=Shira|last=Schoenberg|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area, which eventually fell under the domination of [[Russia]], [[Austria]], and [[Prussia]] (Germany), would remain the main center of Ashkenazi Jewry until the [[Holocaust]].

The answer to why there was so little assimilation of Jews in Eastern Europe for so long would seem to lie in part in the probability that the alien surroundings in Eastern Europe were not conducive, though contempt did not prevent some assimilation. Furthermore, Jews lived almost exclusively in [[shtetls]], maintained a strong system of education for males, heeded rabbinic leadership, and scorned the life-style of their neighbors; and all of these tendencies increased with every outbreak of [[antisemitism]].&lt;ref&gt;Feldman, Louis H.

===Usage of the name===&lt;!-- This section is linked from Ashkenazi Jews --&gt;
In reference to the Jewish peoples of Northern Europe and particularly the [[Rhineland]], the word ''Ashkenazi'' is often found in medieval [[rabbinic literature]]. References to Ashkenaz in [[Yosippon]] and [[Hasdai ibn Shaprut]]'s letter to the king of the [[Khazars]] would date the term as far back as the 10th century, as would also [[Saadia Gaon]]'s commentary on Daniel 7:8.

The word ''Ashkenaz'' first appears in the genealogy in the [[Tanakh]] (Genesis 10) as a son of [[Gomer]] and grandson of [[Japheth]]. It is thought that the name originally applied to the [[Scythia#Scythians in the Bible|Scythians]] (Ishkuz), who were called ''Ashkuza'' in Assyrian inscriptions, and lake [[Ascanius]] and the region [[Ascania Lake|Ascania]] in [[Anatolia]] derive their names from this group. 

''Ashkenaz'' in later [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] tradition became identified with the peoples of Germany, and in particular to the area along the Rhine.

Ashkenaz and the Ashkenazi contrast to the land of [[Knaanic language|Knaan]], a geo-ethnological term denoting the Jewish populations living east of the [[Elbe]] river as opposed to the Ashkenazi Jews living to the West of it, and the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardic Jews]] of Iberian Peninsula.&lt;ref name=&quot;Datner&quot;&gt;{{pl icon}} {{cite book | author =various authors | coauthors =[[Szymon Datner]] | title =Z dziejÃ³w Å»ydÃ³w w Polsce | year =1983 | editor =Witold Tyloch | page =6 | chapter = | chapterurl = | publisher =Interpress | location =Warsaw | isbn=83-223-2095-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[endonym|autonym]] was usually ''[[Yid]]n'', however.

===Medieval references===
[[Image:Wormsjews.jpg|thumb|200px|Jews from [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], Germany wear the mandatory [[yellow badge]].]]
In the first half of the 11th century, [[Hai Gaon]] refers to questions that had been addressed to him from Ashkenaz, by which he undoubtedly means Germany. ''[[Rashi]]'' in the latter half of the 11th century refers to both the language of Ashkenaz&lt;ref&gt;Commentary on Deuteronomy 3:9; idem on [[Talmud]] tractate Sukkah 17a&lt;/ref&gt; and the country of Ashkenaz.&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Hullin 93a&lt;/ref&gt; During the 12th century, the word appears quite frequently. In the ''[[Mahzor Vitry]]'', the kingdom of Ashkenaz is referred to chiefly in regard to the ritual of the synagogue there, but occasionally also with regard to certain other observances.&lt;ref&gt;ib. p. 129&lt;/ref&gt;

In the literature of the 13th century, references to the land and the language of Ashkenaz often occur. Examples include [[Solomon ben Aderet]]'s Responsa (vol. i., No. 395); the Responsa of [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (pp.&amp;nbsp;4, 6); his ''Halakot'' (Berakot i. 12, ed. Wilna, p.&amp;nbsp;10); the work of his son [[Jacob ben Asher]], ''Tur Orach Chayim'' (chapter 59); the Responsa of Isaac ben Sheshet (numbers 193, 268, 270). 

In the ''[[Midrash]]'' compilation ''Genesis Rabbah'', Rabbi Berechiah mentions Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah as [[Germany|German]] tribes or as German lands. It may correspond to a [[Greek language|Greek]] word that may have existed in the Greek dialect of the [[Palestinian Jews]], or the text is corrupted from &quot;Germanica.&quot; This view of Berechiah is based on the Talmud (Yoma 10a; Jerusalem Talmud Megillah 71b), where Gomer, the father of Ashkenaz, is translated by ''Germamia'', which evidently stands for Germany, and which was suggested by the similarity of the sound.

In later times the word Ashkenaz is used to designate southern and Western Germany, the ritual of which sections differs somewhat from that of Eastern Germany and [[Poland]]. Thus the prayer-book of [[Isaiah Horowitz]], and many others, give the [[piyyutim]] according to the [[Minhag]] of Ashkenaz and Poland.

According to 16th century mystic [[Elijah Ba'al Shem of Chelm|Rabbi Elijah of Chelm]], Ashkenazi Jews lived in [[Jerusalem]] during the 11th century. The story is told that a German-speaking [[Palestine|Palestinian]] Jew saved the life of a young German man [[surname]]d Dolberger. So when the [[knight]]s of the [[First Crusade]] came to siege Jerusalem, one of  Dolbergerâs family members who was among them rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] to repay the favor.&lt;ref&gt;Seder ha-Dorot&quot;, p. 252, 1878 ed.&lt;/ref&gt; Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of [[Halakha|halakhic]] questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.&lt;ref&gt;Epstein, in &quot;Monatsschrift,&quot; xlvii. 344; [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=242&amp;letter=J#928 Jerusalem: Under the Arabs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern history===
In an essay on Sephardi Jewry, [[Daniel Elazar]] at the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]]&lt;ref name=&quot;sephardic&quot;/&gt; summarized the demographic history of Ashkenazi Jews in the last thousand years, noting that at the end of the 11th century, 97% of world Jewry was Sephardic and 3% Ashkenazi; in the mid-17th century, &quot;Sephardim still outnumbered Ashkenazim three to two&quot;, but by the end of the 18th century, &quot;Ashkenazim outnumbered Sephardim three to two, the result of improved living conditions in Christian Europe versus the Ottoman Muslim world.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sephardic&quot;/&gt; By 1931, Ashkenazi Jews accounted for nearly 92% of world Jewry.&lt;ref name=&quot;sephardic&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-267-0111-36, Russland, russische Kriegsgefangene (Juden).jpg|thumb|160px|Soviet POW, August 1941. Without exception, any Red Army prisoners identified as Jews were killed.]]
Ashkenazi Jews developed the [[Hasidic]] movement as well as major Jewish academic centers across Poland, Russia, and Belarus in the generations after emigration from the west. After two centuries of comparative tolerance in the new nations, massive westward emigration occurred in the 19th and 20th centuries in response to [[pogrom]]s in the east and the economic opportunities offered in other parts of the world. Ashkenazi Jews have made up the majority of the [[American Jew]]ish community since 1750.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ashkenazim&quot;/&gt;

Ashkenazi cultural growth led to the ''[[Haskalah]]'' or Jewish Enlightenment, and the development of [[Zionism]] in modern Europe.

====The Holocaust====
Of the estimated 8.8 million Jews living in Europe at the beginning of [[World War II]], the majority of whom were Ashkenazi, about 6 million â more than two-thirds â were systematically murdered in [[the Holocaust]]. These included 3 million of 3.3 million [[Polish Jews]] (91%); 900,000 of 1.5 million in [[Ukraine]] (60%); and 50â90% of the Jews of other Slavic nations, Germany, Hungary, and the Baltic states, and over 25% of the Jews in France. Sephardi communities suffered similar depletions in a few countries, including Greece, the Netherlands and the former Yugoslavia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/killedtable.html|title=Estimated Number of Jews Killed in The Final Solution|publisher=Jewish Virtual Library|accessdate=2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the large majority of  the victims were Ashkenazi Jews, their percentage dropped from nearly 92% of world Jewry in 1931 to nearly 80% of world Jewry today.&lt;ref name=&quot;sephardic&quot;/&gt; The Holocaust also effectively put an end to the dynamic development of the Yiddish language in the [[Yiddish Renaissance|previous decades]], as the vast majority of the victims of the Holocaust, around five million, were Yiddish speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[[Solomon Birnbaum|Solomo Birnbaum]], ''Grammatik der jiddischen Sprache'' (4., erg. Aufl., Hamburg: Buske, 1984), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the surviving Ashkenazi Jews [[Human migration|emigrated]] to countries such as [[Israel]], [[Canada]], [[Argentina]], [[history of the Jews in Australia|Australia]], and the United States after the war.

====In Israel====
Today, Ashkenazi Jews constitute the largest group among Jews,&lt;ref name=&quot;sephardic&quot;/&gt; and among [[Israeli Jews]] as well. They have played a prominent role in the economy, media, and politics of Israel since its founding. During the first decades of Israel as a state, strong cultural conflict occurred between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews (mainly east European Ashkenazim). The roots of this conflict, which still exists to a much smaller extent in present day Israeli society, are chiefly attributed to the concept of the &quot;[[melting pot]]&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} That is to say, all Jewish immigrants who arrived in Israel were strongly encouraged to &quot;melt down&quot; their own particular exilic identities within the general social &quot;pot&quot; in order to become Israeli.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Customs, laws and traditions==
The ''[[Halakha|Halakhic]]'' practices of ([[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]]) Ashkenazi Jews may differ from those of [[Sephardi Jews]], particularly in matters of custom. Differences are noted in the ''[[Shulkhan Arukh]]'' itself, in the gloss of [[Moses Isserles]]. Well known differences in practice include:
*Observance of ''[[Passover|Pesach]]'' (Passover): Ashkenazi Jews traditionally refrain from eating [[legumes]], grain, [[millet]], and [[rice]] ([[quinoa]], however, has become accepted as foodgrain in the North American communities), whereas Sephardi Jews typically do not prohibit these foods.
*Ashkenazi Jews freely mix and eat fish and milk products; some Sephardic Jews refrain from doing so.
*Ashkenazim are more permissive toward the usage of [[Wig (hair)|wigs]] as a hair covering for married and widowed women.
*In the case of ''[[kashrut]]'' for meat, conversely, Sephardi Jews have stricter requirementsâthis level is commonly referred to as ''[[Shulkhan Arukh#Beth Yosef|Beth Yosef]]''. Meat products which are acceptable to Ashkenazi Jews as kosher may therefore be rejected by Sephardi Jews. Notwithstanding stricter requirements for the actual slaughter, Sephardi Jews permit the rear portions of an animal after proper [[Halakha|Halakhic]] removal of the [[sciatic nerve]], while many Ashkenazi Jews do not. This is not because of different interpretations of the law; rather, slaughterhouses could not find adequate skills for correct removal of the sciatic nerve and found it more economical to separate the hindquarters and sell them as non-kosher meat.
*Ashkenazi Jews frequently name newborn children after deceased family members, but not after living relatives. Sephardi Jews, in contrast, often name their children after the children's grandparents, even if those grandparents are still living. A notable exception to this generally reliable rule is among [[Dutch Jews]], where Ashkenazim for centuries used the naming conventions otherwise attributed exclusively to Sephardim such as [[Chuts]].
*Ashkenazi [[tefillin]] bear some differences from Sephardic [[tefillin]]. In the traditional Ashkenazic rite, the tefillin are wound towards the body, not away from it. Ashkenazim traditionally don [[tefillin]] while standing, whereas other Jews generally do so while sitting down.
*Ashkenazic traditional pronunciations of [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] differ from those of other groups. The most prominent consonantal difference from Sephardic and Mizrahic Hebrew dialects is the pronunciation of the Hebrew letter [[Taw (letter)|tav]] in certain Hebrew words (historically, in postvocalic undoubled context) as an /s/ and not a /t/ or /Î¸/ sound. {{Further|[[Ashkenazi Hebrew]]}}
* The prayer shawl, or [[tallit]] (or tallis in Ashkenazi Hebrew), is worn by the majority of Ashkenazi men after marriage, but western European Ashkenazi men wear it from Bar Mitzvah. In Sephardi or Mizrahi Judaism, the prayer shawl is commonly worn from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religionfacts.com/judaism/things/tallit.htm ''Tallit: Jewish Prayer Shawl'', Religion Facts]. Retrieved December 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship with other Jews==
{{Jews and Judaism sidebar|ethnicities}}
The term ''Ashkenazi'' also refers to the ''[[nusach Ashkenaz]]'' ([[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], &quot;liturgical tradition&quot;, or rite) used by Ashkenazi [[Jew]]s in their ''[[Siddur]]'' (prayer book). A ''nusach'' is defined by a liturgical tradition's choice of prayers, order of prayers, text of prayers and melodies used in the singing of prayers. Two other major forms of nusach among Ashkenazic Jews are [[Nusach Sefard]] (not to be confused with Sephardi), which is the same as the general Polish (Hasidic) Nusach; and Nusach Chabad, otherwise known as Lubavitch Chasidic, Nusach [[Isaac Luria|Arizal]] or [[Nusach Ari]].

This phrase is often used in contrast with Sephardi Jews, also called Sephardim, who are descendants of Jews from Spain and [[Portugal]]. There are some differences in how the two groups pronounce certain Hebrew letters and in points of ritual.

Several famous people have [[Ashkenazi (surname)|Ashkenazi as a surname]], such as [[Vladimir Ashkenazy]]. Ironically, most people with this surname hail from within Sephardic communities, particularly from the [[Syrian Jew]]ish community. The Sephardic carriers of the surname would have some Ashkenazi ancestors since the surname was adopted by families who were initially of Ashkenazic origins who move to Sephardi countries and joined those communities. Ashkenazi would be formally adopted as the family surname having started off as a nickname imposed by their adopted communities. Some have shortened the name to Ash.

The theory that the majority of Ashkenazi Jews are the descendants of the non-Semitic converted [[Khazar]]s was advocated by various racial theorists and [[antisemitism|antisemitic sources]] in the late-19th and 20th centuries, especially following the publication of [[Arthur Koestler]]'s ''[[The Thirteenth Tribe]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Barkun, ''Religion and the Racist Right: The Origins of the Christian Identity Movement'', UNC Press, ISBN 0-8078-4638-4, pp. 137-142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Goodrick-Clarke&gt;Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke, ''Black Sun: Aryan cults, esoteric nazism, and the politics of identity'', NYU Press, 2002, ISBN 0-8147-3155-4, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul F.

''Semites and Anti-Semites'', W.W. Norton and Company, ISBN 0-393-31839-7, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; this belief is still popular among antisemites.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Of course an anti-Zionist (as well as an anti-Semitic) point is being made here: The Palestinians have a greater political right to Palestine than the Jews do, as they, not the modern-day Jews, are the true descendants of the land's Jewish inhabitants/owners.&quot; [[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]].

The main idea is that the Jews, racially, are a mongrel community, most of them being not Semites, but of Khazar and European origin.&quot; Yehoshafat Harkabi, &quot;Contemporary Arab Anti-Semitism: its Causes and Roots&quot;, in Helen Fein, ''The Persisting Question: Sociological Perspectives and Social Contexts of Modern Antisemitism'', Walter de Gruyter, 1987, ISBN 3-11-010170-X, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetics==
===Genetic origins===
{{main|Genetic studies on Jews}}
Efforts to identify the origins of Ashkenazi Jews through DNA analysis began in the 1990s. Like most DNA studies of human migration patterns, the earliest studies focused on two segments of the human genome, the [[Y chromosome|Y-chromosome]] (passed on only by males), and the mitochondrial genome ([[mtDNA]], passed on only by females). Both segments are unaffected by [[recombination (biology)|recombination]]. [[Genome-wide association study|Genome-wide association studies]] have also been employed to yield findings relevant to genetic origins.

====Male lineages: Y-chromosomal DNA====
A study of [[haplotypes]] of the Y-chromosome, published in 2000, addressed the paternal origins of Ashkenazi Jews. Hammer ''et al.''&lt;ref name=&quot;hammer&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jewish and Middle Eastern non-Jewish populations share a common pool of Y-chromosome biallelic haplotypes|first=M. F.|last=Hammer|coauthors=A. J. Redd, E. T. Wood, M. R. Bonner, H. Jarjanazi, T. Karafet, S. Santachiara-Benerecetti, A. Oppenheim, M. A. Jobling, T. Jenkins, H. Ostrer, and B.

This suggested that the male ancestors of the Ashkenazi Jews could be traced mostly to the Middle East. The proportion of male [[genetic admixture]] in Ashkenazi Jews amounts to less than 0.5% per generation over an estimated 80 generations, with &quot;relatively minor contribution of European Y chromosomes to the Ashkenazim,&quot; and a total admixture estimate &quot;very similar to Motulsky's average estimate of 12.5%.&quot; This supported the finding that &quot;Diaspora Jews from Europe, Northwest Africa, and the Near East resemble each other more closely than they resemble their non-Jewish neighbors.&quot;

A 2001 study by Nebel ''et al.'' showed that both Ashkenazi and Sephardic Jewish populations share the same overall paternal Near Eastern ancestries. In comparison with data available from other relevant populations in the region, Jews were found to be more closely related to groups in the north of the [[Fertile Crescent]]. The authors also report on Eu 19 ([[R1a]]) chromosomes, which are very frequent in Eastern Europeans (54%-60%) at elevated frequency (12.7%) in Ashkenazi Jews. They hypothesized that the differences among Ashkenazim Jews could reflect low-level gene flow from surrounding European populations and/or genetic drift during isolation.&lt;ref&gt;Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Bernd Brinkmann, Partha P. Majumder, Marina Faerman, Ariella Oppenheim. [http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi?artid=1274378 &quot;The Y Chromosome Pool of Jews as Part of the Genetic Landscape of the Middle East&quot;], ''The American Journal of Human Genetics'' (2001), Volume 69, number 5. pp. 1095â112&lt;/ref&gt; A later 2005 study by Nebel ''et al.'', found a similar level of 11.5% of male Ashkenazim belonging to [[R1a|R1a1a (M17+)]], the dominant Y-chromosome haplogroup in Eastern Europeans, suggesting possible gene flow.&lt;ref&gt;Almut Nebel, Dvora Filon, Marina Faerman, Himla Soodyall and Ariella Oppenheim.

====Female lineages: Mitochondrial DNA====
Before 2006, geneticists largely attributed the genesis of most of the [[Jewish ethnic divisions|world's Jewish populations]], including Ashkenazi Jews, to founding effects by males who migrated from the Middle East and &quot;by the women from each local population whom they took as wives and converted to Judaism.&quot; In line with this model of origin, David Goldstein, now of Duke University, reported in 2002 that, unlike male lineages, the female lineages in Ashkenazi Jewish communities &quot;did not seem to be Middle Eastern&quot;, and that each community had its own genetic pattern and even that &quot;in some cases the mitochondrial DNA was closely related to that of the host community.&quot; In his view this suggested &quot;that Jewish men had arrived from the Middle East, taken wives from the host population and converted them to Judaism, after which there was no further intermarriage with non-Jews.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;WadeNYT&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/14/science/14gene.html |title=New Light on Origins of Ashkenazi in Europe |first=Nicholas |last=Wade |journal=The New York Times |month=January 14 |year=2006 |accessdate=2006-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Haplogroup K is common throughout western Eurasia, &quot;the observed global pattern of distribution renders very unlikely the possibility that the four aforementioned founder lineages entered the Ashkenazi mtDNA pool via gene flow from a European host population:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;..Both the extent and location of the maternal ancestral [[Deme (biology)|deme]] from which the Ashkenazi Jewry arose remain obscure. Here, using complete sequences of the maternally inherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), we show that close to one-half of Ashkenazi Jews, estimated at 8,000,000 people, can be traced back to only four women carrying distinct mtDNAs that are virtually absent in other populations, with the important exception of low frequencies among non-Ashkenazi Jews. We conclude that four founding mtDNAs, likely of Near Eastern ancestry, underwent major expansion(s) in Europe within the past millennium..&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;behar&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WadeNYT&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, Behar ''et al.'' have suggested that the rest of Ashkenazi mtDNA is originated from ~150 women, most of those likely of Middle Eastern origin.&lt;ref name=&quot;behar&quot;/&gt;  However, other studies by Behar indicate that this mtDNA is different from other Jewish populations found outside of Europe, leaving the possibility of a separate origin or even a European origin a distinct possibility. &lt;ref name = &quot;Behar2008b&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Behar DM, Metspalu E, Kivisild T, ''et al.'' |title=Counting the founders: the matrilineal genetic ancestry of the Jewish Diaspora |journal=PloS ONE |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=e2062 |year=2008 |pmid=18446216 |pmc=2323359 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0002062|editor1-last=MacAulay|editor1-first=Vincent|bibcode = 2008PLoSO...3.2062B }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Genome-wide association and linkage studies====
In [[genetic epidemiology]], a [[genome-wide association study]] (GWA study, or GWAS) is an examination of all or most of the genes (the genome) of different individuals of a particular species to see how much the genes vary from individual to individual. These techniques were originally designed for epidemiological uses, to identify genetic associations with observable traits.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pearson&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.299.11.1335| volume = 299| issue = 11| pages = 1335â44 |author= Pearson TA, Manolio TA | title = How to interpret a genome-wide association study| journal = JAMA|  year = 2008 |pmid=18349094 | url = http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/299/11/1335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 study by Seldin ''et al.''  used over five thousand autosomal SNPs to demonstrate European genetic substructure. The results showed âa consistent and reproducible distinction between ânorthernâ and âsouthernâ European population groupsâ.  Most northern, central, and eastern Europeans (Finns, Swedes, English, Irish, Germans, and Ukrainians) showed &gt;90% in the ânorthernâ population group, while most individual participants with southern European ancestry (Italians, Greeks, Portuguese, Spaniards) showed &gt;85% in the 'southern' group.  Both Ashkenazi Jews as well as Sephardic Jews showed &gt;85% membership in the âsouthernâ group. Referring to the Jews clustering with southern Europeans, the authors state the results were &quot;consistent with a later Mediterranean origin of these ethnic groups&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Seldin |first=M.

A 2007 study by Bauchet ''et al.'' found that Ashkenazi Jews were most closely clustered with Arabic North African populations when compared to Global population, and in the European structure analysis, they share similarities only with Greeks and Southern Italians, reflecting their east Mediterranean origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rosenberg |first=Noah A. |last2=''et al.'' |year=2002 |title=Genetic structure of human populations |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=298 |issue=5602 |pages=2381â2385 |doi=10.1126/science.1078311 |pmid=12493913 |bibcode=2002Sci...298.2381R}}

A 2010 study on Jewish ancestry by Atzmon-Ostrer ''et al.'' stated &quot;Two major groups were identified by principal component, phylogenetic, and identity by descent (IBD) analysis: Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews. The IBD segment sharing and the proximity of European Jews to each other and to southern European populations suggested similar origins for European Jewry and refuted large-scale genetic contributions of Central and Eastern European and Slavic populations to the formation of Ashkenazi Jewry.&quot;, as both groups - the Middle Eastern Jews and European/Syrian Jews shared common ancestors in the Middle East about 2500 years ago. The study examines genetic markers spread across the entire genome and shows that the Jewish groups (Ashkenazi and non Ashkenazi) share large swaths of DNA, indicating close relationships and that each of the Jewish groups in the study (Iranian, Iraqi, Syrian, Italian, Turkish, Greek and Ashkenazi) has its own genetic signature but is more closely related to the other Jewish groups than to their fellow non-Jewish countrymen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/59938/title/Tracing_Jewish_roots |title=Tracing Jewish roots |first=Tina Hesman |last=Saey |work=ScienceNews |date=June 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Atzmon's team found that the SNP markers in genetic segments of 3 million DNA letters or longer were 10 times more likely to be identical among Jews than non-Jews. Results of the analysis also tally with biblical accounts of the fate of the Jews. Using their DNA analysis, the authors traced the ancestors of all Jews to Persia and Babylon, areas that now form part of Iran and Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/dn19008-how-religion-made-jews-genetically-distinct.html |title=How religion made Jews genetically distinct |first=Andy |last=Coghlan |work=Newscientist |date=June 4, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that with respect to non-Jewish European groups, the population most closely related to Ashkenazi Jews are modern-day Italians. The study speculated that the genetic-similarity between Ashkenazi Jews and Italians may be due to inter-marriage and conversions in the time of the Roman Empire. It was also found that any two Ashkenazi Jewish participants in the study shared about as much DNA as fourth or fifth cousins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Genes set Jews apart, study finds |first=Thomas H. |last2=Maugh II |newspaper=Los Angeles Times |date=June 3, 2010 |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-jewish-genome-20100604,0,7364243.story }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Atzmon2010&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |first=G. |last=Atzmon |first2=L. |last2=Hao |first3=I. |last3=Pe'er |first4=C. |last4=Velez |first5=A. |last5=Pearlman |first6=P.

A 2010 study by Bray ''et al'', using [[SNP array|SNP]] [[DNA microarray|microarray]] techniques and [[linkage analysis]], estimated that 35 to 55 percent of the modern Ashkenazi genome may be of European origin, and that European &quot;admixture is considerably higher than previous estimates by studies that used the Y chromosome&quot;. The study assumed [[Druze]] and [[Palestinian Arabs]] populations to represent the reference to world Jewry ancestor genome. With this reference point, the linkage disequilibrium in the Ashkenazi Jewish population was interpreted as &quot;matches signs of interbreeding or 'admixture' between Middle Eastern and European populations&quot;. In their press release, Bray stated: &quot;We were surprised to find evidence that Ashkenazi Jews have higher [[heterozygosity]] than Europeans, contradicting the widely-held presumption that they have been a largely isolated group&quot;. Nevertheless, the authors indicated possible Achilles' heel for the study is that their calculations might &quot;overestimated the level of admixture&quot; in case that the true Jewish ancestor was genetically closer to Southern Europeans than Druze and Palestinian Arabs are and predicted that using the non Ashkenazi Jewish Diaspora populations as reference for the Jewish ancestor genome would &quot;underestimate the level of admixture&quot;, as they assume the non Ashkenazi Jewish Diaspora has also &quot;undergone the similar admixture&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Signatures of founder effects, admixture, and selection in the Ashkenazi Jewish population |first=Steven M. |last=Bray |first2=Jennifer G. |last2=Mulle |first3=Anne F. |last3=Dodd |first4=Ann E. |last4=Pulver |first5=Stephen |last5=Wooding |first6=Stephen T. |last6=Warren |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|PNAS]] |volume=107  |issue=37 |pages=16222â16227 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1004381107 |year=2010 |pmid=20798349|bibcode = 2010PNAS..10716222B |pmc=2941333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical genetics===
{{Ref improve section|date=August 2010}}
{{main|Medical genetics of Jewish people}}

There are many references to Ashkenazi Jews in the literature of medical and population genetics. Indeed, much awareness of &quot;Ashkenazi Jews&quot; as an ethnic group or category stems from the large number of genetic studies of disease, including many that are well reported in the media, that have been conducted among Jews. Jewish populations have been studied more thoroughly than most other human populations, for a variety of reasons: 

* Geneticists are intrinsically interested in Jewish populations as a disproportionate percentage of genetics researchers are Jewish. Israel in particular has become an international center of such research.
* Jewish populations, and particularly the large Ashkenazi Jewish population, are ideal for such research studies, because they exhibit a high degree of [[endogamy]], yet they are sizable.
* Jewish populations are overwhelmingly urban, and are concentrated near biomedical centers where such research has been carried out. Such research is especially easy to carry out in Israel, where cradle-to-grave medical insurance is available, together with universal screening for genetic disease.
* Jewish communities are comparatively well informed about genetics research, and have been supportive of community efforts to study and prevent genetic diseases.
* Participation of Jewish scientists and support from the Jewish community alleviates ethical concerns that sometimes hinder such genetic studies in other ethnic groups.

The result is a form of [[ascertainment bias]]. This has sometimes created an impression that Jews are more susceptible to genetic disease than other populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Carmeli, Daphna Birenbaum|journal=American Journal of Medical Genetics|year=2004|title=Prevalence of Jews as subjects in genetic research: Figures, explanation, and potential implications| vol=130A|issue=1|pages=76â83 |volume=130a|doi=10.1002/ajmg.a.20291|pmid=15368499}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healthcare professionals are often taught to consider those of Ashkenazi descent to be at increased risk for colon cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

A study by the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] examines a particular genetic trait that increases the lifespan of the Ashkenazi population. The study focuses on [[telomerase]], the enzyme responsible for maintaining [[telomere]]s at the ends of [[chromosome]]s during [[mitosis|cell division]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.einstein.yu.edu/longenity/page.aspx| title =Longenity - Longevity Genes Project| accessdate=2009-11-13| work=Albert Einstein College of Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/livescience/20091112/sc_livescience/onekeyfoundforlivingto100;_ylt=AivdX7AIbXJS0sOf5A9X1_BzfNdF| title=One Key Found for Living to 100| first=Robert Roy| last=Britt| date=2009-11-12| work=LiveScience.com| accessdate=2009-11-13}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Genetic counseling]] and [[genetic testing]] are recommended for couples where both partners are of Ashkenazi ancestry. Some organizations, most notably [[Dor Yeshorim]], organize screening programs to prevent [[homozygote|homozygosity]] for the [[gene]]s that cause these diseases. E. L. Abel's book ''Jewish Genetic Disorders: A Layman's Guide'' (McFarland, 2008: ISBN 0-7864-4087-2) is a comprehensive reference text on the topic; also see the Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgeneticscenter.org |title=Chicago Center for Jewish Genetic Disorders |accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more information.
