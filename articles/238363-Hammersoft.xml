Whately was educated at [[Barnard Castle School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barnardcastleschool.org.uk/?pageid=85 |title=Drama |accessdate=2009-03-08 |work= |publisher=Barnard Castle School website |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and studied drama at the [[Central School of Speech and Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cssd.ac.uk/content/distinguished-alumni |title=Some of Our Famous Alumni... |accessdate=2009-03-08 |work= |publisher=Central School of Speech and Drama website |date= }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; His brother, Frank, is a drama lecturer at a London university.&lt;ref name=wdytya/&gt; Before going professional, Whately was an amateur actor at the [[The People's Theatre, Newcastle upon Tyne|People's Theatre]], Newcastle upon Tyne during the 1970s.

===Career===
Before turning to professional acting Whately began his working life as a [[folk singer]], and still plays [[guitar]], performing for charity concerts:&lt;ref name=wdytya/&gt; Along with other ''Auf Wiedersehen, Pet'' stars, he makes an appearance at the biennial benefit concert ''Sunday for Sammy'' in Newcastle. Before becoming an actor, he started training as an [[accountant]].

His acting career includes several [[stage play]]s, among them an adaptation of ''[[Twelve Angry Men (play)|Twelve Angry Men]]'' and film appearances in ''[[The Return of the Soldier (film)|The Return of the Soldier]]'', ''[[The English Patient (film)|The English Patient]]'', ''[[Paranoid (2000 thriller film)|Paranoid]]'' and ''[[Purely Belter]]''.

Whately's television appearances include episodes of ''[[Shoestring (TV series)|Shoestring]]'', ''[[Angels (TV series)|Angels]]'', ''[[Juliet Bravo]]'', ''[[Strangers (TV series)|Strangers]]'', ''[[Coronation Street]]'', ''[[Shackleton (film)|Shackleton]]'', ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'', ''[[Marple (TV series)|Marple]]'', ''[[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]]'', ''[[Alas Smith and Jones]]'', ''[[Look and Read]]'', ''[[You Must Be The Husband]]'', ''[[B&amp;B (TV series)|B&amp;B]]'', ''[[Peak Practice]]'', ''[[Skallagrigg#Screen adaptation|Skallagrigg]]'', ''The Broker's Man'', ''[[Murder in Mind (TV series)|Murder in Mind]]'', [[Comic Relief#2003 event|2003 Comic Relief ''Auf Wiedersehen, Pet'']], ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', ''[[New Tricks (TV series)|New Tricks]]'', ''[[Who Gets the Dog?

Whately provided one of the voices for the English language version of the 1999 [[claymation]] [[Children's television series]] ''[[Hilltop Hospital]]''. He has also appeared in an advert for Water Aid doing a voice over.

Perhaps his most memorable television appearances were as Detective Sergeant Lewis, the down-to-earth complement to the snobbishly intellectual ''[[Inspector Morse]]''. He reprised the role in the spin-off series ''[[Lewis (TV series)|Lewis]]'', in which Lewis returns to Oxford as full Inspector. With his new partner, the Cambridge-educated Detective Sergeant James Hathaway ([[Laurence Fox]]), Inspector Lewis solves murder mysteries while trying to rebuild his life after his wife's sudden death in a road accident, and to gain recognition from his sceptical new boss.

Richard Marson's book celebrating fifty years of ''[[Blue Peter]]'' comments that Whately auditioned as a presenter for the show in 1980 but lost out to [[Peter Duncan (actor)|Peter Duncan]].

===Personal life===
Whately lives close to [[Milton Keynes]], with his wife actress [[Madelaine Newton]], who starred in 1970s BBC drama ''[[When the Boat Comes In]]''. The couple have two children: Catherine &quot;Kitty&quot; Whately, born in 1983, who appeared as Kevin's on-screen daughter in the series ''[[Auf Wiedersehen, Pet]]'' for the first two seasons; and Kieran, born in 1985.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Kitty also appeared as a contestant on the game show ''[[Deal or No Deal (UK game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'' in February 2011, playing her game on 24 February, in which she revealed she was now working as an [[opera singer]], as well as being a [[postgraduate student]], and that she has one daughter, Ivy, born on 11 December 2006 (inspiring her to use 18, 12, 6, as her first box numbers).

Whately enjoys music; he listens to [[Pink Floyd]] and [[Dire Straits]]. He supports [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley F.C]] on the [[Soccer|football]] field and as a [[cricket]]er admitted to ''Inspector Morse'' writer [[Colin Dexter]] that he would like to have played cricket professionally for England, Dexter devised the storyline for &quot;Inspector Morse: Deceived by Flight (#3.3)&quot; (1989) in which Sergeant Lewis had to go undercover in a cricket team to investigate drug smuggling.&lt;ref name=wdytya/&gt;
