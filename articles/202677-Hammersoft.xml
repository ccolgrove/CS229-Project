Secret police, torture, murders, rape, abductions, deportations, forced disappearances, [[assassination]]s, [[chemical weapons]], and the destruction of [[wetlands]] (more specifically, the destruction of the food sources of rival groups) were some of the methods Saddam Hussein used to maintain control.{{Or|date=September 2007}} The total number of [[deaths]] related to torture and murder during this period are unknown, as are the reports of [[human rights]] [[violations]]. [[Human Rights Watch]] and [[Amnesty International]] issued regular reports of widespread [[imprisonment]] and torture.

==Documented human rights violations 1979â2003==
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2011}}
Human rights organizations have documented government-approved [[execution (legal)|execution]]s, acts of torture and [[rape]] for decades since Saddam Hussein came to power in 1979 until his fall in 2003.

* In 2002, a resolution sponsored by the [[European Union]] was adopted by the Commission for Human Rights, which stated that there had been no improvement in the human rights crisis in Iraq. The statement condemned President Saddam Hussein's [[government]] for its &quot;systematic, widespread and extremely grave violations of human rights and [[international humanitarian law]]&quot;. The resolution demanded that Iraq immediately put an end to its &quot;summary and arbitrary executions... the use of rape as a political tool and all enforced and involuntary disappearances&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1940050.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN condemns Iraq on human rights | date=2002-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Full political participation at the national level was restricted only to members of the [[Ba'ath Party (Iraq)|Ba'ath Party]], which constituted only 8% of the population.

* Iraqi citizens were not allowed to assemble legally unless it was to express support for the government. The Iraqi government controlled the establishment of [[political parties]], regulated their internal affairs and monitored their activities.

* Police checkpoints on Iraq's roads and [[highway]]s prevented ordinary citizens from traveling abroad without government permission and expensive exit [[visa (document)|visa]]s. Before traveling, an Iraqi citizen had to post collateral. Iraqi females could not travel outside of the country without the escort of a man relative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/dateline/2010/01/iraq-citizenship-and-womens-rights.php JURIST - Dateline&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The activities of citizens living inside Iraq who received money from relatives abroad were closely monitored {{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

*[[Halabja poison gas attack]]:The Halabja poison gas attack occurred in the period 15â19 March 1988 during the [[IranâIraq War]] when [[chemical weapon]]s were used by the [[Iraq]]i government forces and thousands of civilians in the Iraqi [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] town of [[Halabja]] were killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraqi Kurds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1991/IRAQ913.htm |title=Whatever Happened To The Iraqi Kurds? |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Al-Anfal Campaign]]: In 1988, the Hussein regime began a campaign of extermination against the [[Kurdish people]] living in Northern Iraq. This is known as the [[Anfal campaign]]. The campaign was mostly directed at Shiite kurds (Faili Kurds) who sided with Iranians during the Iraq-Iran War. The attacks resulted in the death of at least 50,000 (some reports estimate as many as 100,000 people), many of them women and children. A team of [[Human Rights Watch]] investigators determined, after analyzing eighteen tons of captured Iraqi documents, testing soil samples and carrying out interviews with more than 350 [[witness]]es, that the attacks on the Kurdish people were characterized by gross violations of human rights, including mass executions and disappearances of many tens of thousands of noncombatants, widespread use of chemical weapons including [[Sarin]], [[mustard gas]] and [[nerve agents]] that killed thousands, the arbitrary imprisoning of tens of thousands of women, children, and elderly people for months in conditions of extreme [[deprivation]], forced [[forced migration|displacement]] of hundreds of thousands of villagers after the [[demolition]] of their homes, and the wholesale destruction of nearly two thousand villages along with their schools, [[mosque]]s, farms and [[power station]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Iraqi Kurds&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.amnesty.org/pages/irq-article_6-eng |title=Iraq: âDisappearancesâ â the agony continues |publisher=Web.amnesty.org |date=2005-07-30 |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In April 1991, after Saddam lost control of [[Kuwait]] in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], he cracked down ruthlessly against [[1991 uprisings in Iraq|several uprisings]] in the Kurdish north and the [[Shia]] south. His forces committed wholesale [[wiktionary:massacre|massacres]] and other gross human rights violations against both groups similar to the violations mentioned before. Estimates of deaths during that time range from 20,000 to 100,000 for Kurds, and 60,000 to 130,000 for Shi'ites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1992/Iraq926.htm |title=ENDLESS TORMENT, The 1991 Uprising in Iraq And Its Aftermath |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In June 1994, the Hussein [[regime]] in Iraq established severe [[Sentence (law)|penalties]], including [[amputation]], branding and the [[death penalty]] for criminal offenses such as [[theft]], corruption, [[currency speculation]] and [[military]] [[desertion]], while government members and Saddam's family members were immune from punishments ranging around these crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrw.org/reports/1995/IRAQ955.htm |title=Human Rights Watch, Iraq archive |publisher=Hrw.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* On March 23, 2003 during the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Iraqi [[television]] presented and interviewed [[prisoners of war]] on [[TV]], violating the [[Geneva Convention]].

* Also in April 2003, [[CNN]] revealed that it had withheld information about Iraq torturing [[journalist]]s and Iraqi citizens in the 1990s. According to CNN's chief news executive, the channel had been concerned for the safety not only of its own staff, but also of Iraqi sources and informants, who could expect punishment for speaking freely to [[reporter]]s. Also according to the executive, &quot;other news organizations were in the same bind.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/11/opinion/11JORD.html| title=The News We (CNN) Kept To Ourselves| publisher=The New York Times| date=April 11, 2003| first=Eason| last=Jordan}} (requires login)&lt;/ref&gt;

* After the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], several [[mass grave]]s were found in Iraq containing several thousand bodies total and more are being uncovered to this day.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.npr.org/2011/04/20/135570128/grave-discovery-in-iraq-unearths-sectarian-unease&lt;/ref&gt;  While most of the dead in the graves were believed to have died in the 1991 uprising against Saddam Hussein, some of them appeared to have died due to executions or died at times other than the 1991 [[rebellion]].

* Also after the invasion, numerous torture centers were found in security offices and [[police stations]] throughout Iraq.  The equipment found at these centers typically included hooks for hanging people by the hands for [[beating up|beating]]s, devices for [[electric shock]] and other equipment often found in nations with harsh security services and other authoritarian nations.

=='Saddam's Dirty Dozen'==
According to officials of the United States [[United States Department of State|State Department]], many human rights abuses in Saddam Hussein's Iraq were largely carried out in person or by the orders of Saddam Hussein and eleven other people.
The term &quot;Saddam's Dirty Dozen&quot; was coined in October 2002 (from a novel by [[E.M. Nathanson]], later adapted as a film directed by [[Robert Aldrich]]) and used by US officials to describe this group. Most members of the group held high positions in the Iraqi government and membership went all the way from Saddam's personal guard to Saddam's sons. The list was used by the Bush Administration to help argue that the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Iraq war]] was against Saddam Hussein and the Baath Party leadership, rather than against the Iraqi people. The members are:

*[[Saddam Hussein]] (1937â2006), Iraqi President, responsible for many torturings, killings and of ordering the 1988 cleansing of [[Kurds]] in Northern Iraq.
*[[Qusay Hussein]] (1966â2003),  son of the president, head of the elite [[Iraqi Republican Guard|Republican Guard]], believed to have been chosen by Saddam as his [[successor]].
*[[Uday Hussein]] (1964â2003), son of the president, had a private torture chamber and of the rapes and killings of many women. He was partially [[paralyzed]] after a 1996 attempt on his life, and was leader of the [[paramilitary]] group [[Fedayeen Saddam]] and of the Iraqi [[Mass media|media]].
*[[Taha Yassin Ramadan]], Vice-President. He oversaw the mass killings of a [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] revolt in 1991, and he was born in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]].
*[[Tariq Aziz]], Foreign Minister of Iraq,  backed up the executions by [[hanging]] of political opponents after the revolution of 1968.
*[[Barzan Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Hussein's half brother, leader of the Iraqi secret service, ''[[Mukhabarat]]''. He was Iraq's representative to the [[United Nations]] in [[Geneva, Switzerland|Geneva]].
*[[Sabawi Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Hussein's half brother, he was the leader of the ''Mukhabarat'' during the 1991 [[Gulf War]]. Director of Iraq's general security from 1991 to 1996. He was involved in the 1991 suppression of Kurds.
*[[Watban Ibrahim al-Tikriti]], Hussein's half brother, former senior Interior Minister who was also Saddam's presidential adviser. Shot in the leg by Uday Hussein in 1995. He has ordered tortures, rapes, murders and [[deportations]].
*[[Ali Hassan al-Majid]], ''Chemical Ali'',  mastermind behind Saddam's lethal [[gassing]] of [[Rebellion|rebel]] Kurds in 1988. A first cousin of Saddam Hussein;
*[[Izzat Ibrahim ad-Douri]], military commander, vice-president of the ''Revolutionary Command Council'' and deputy commander in chief of the armed forces during various military campaigns.
*[[Aziz Saleh Nuhmah]], appointed governor of [[Kuwait]] from November 1990 to February 1991,  ordered looting of stores and rapes of Kuwaiti women during his tenure. Also ordered the destruction of Shi'a holy sites during the 1970s and 1980s as governor of two Iraqi provinces.
*[[Mohammed Amza Zubeidi]], alias ''Saddam's shi'a thug'', Prime Minister of Iraq from 1991 to 1993 â  to have ordered many executions.

==Number of Victims==
According to The New York Times, &quot;he [Saddam] murdered as many as a million of his people, many with poison gas. He tortured, maimed and imprisoned countless more. His unprovoked invasion of Iran is estimated to have left another million people dead. His seizure of Kuwait threw the Middle East into crisis. More insidious, arguably, was the psychological damage he inflicted on his own land. Hussein created a nation of informants â friends on friends, circles within circles â making an entire population complicit in his rule&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=By Dexter Filkins |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/07/magazine/07MAKIYA-t.html?pagewanted=2&amp;ei=5088&amp;en=310195565a77e9ff&amp;ex=1349409600&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |title=Iraq â Kanan Makiya â Saddam Hussein â New York Times |location=Iraq |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=2007-10-07 |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have estimated 800,000 deaths caused by Saddam not counting the Iran-Iraq war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indict.org.uk/newsarticles.php?article=news180603 |title=News |publisher=Indict |date=2003-06-18 |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Estimates as to the number of Iraqis executed by Saddam's regime vary from 300-500,000&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/889tngrz.asp?pg=2 A Lifesaving War | The Weekly Standard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to over 600,000,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/03/17/1047749719178.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=Bland words, vivid images wait to nail Saddam's crimes | date=2003-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; estimates as to the number of Kurds he massacred vary from 70,000 to 300,000,&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat3.htm#Kurdistan2 Twentieth Century Atlas - Death Tolls and Casualty Statistics for Wars, Dictatorships and Genocides&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and estimates as to the number killed in the put-down of the 1991 rebellion vary from 60,000&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hrw.org/reports/1992/Iraq926.htm&lt;/ref&gt; to 200,000.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  Estimates for the number of dead in the Iran-Iraq war range upwards from 300,000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.erols.com/mwhite28/warstat2.htm#Iran-Iraq Twentieth Century Atlas - Death Tolls&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
===Iraq sanctions===
{{Main|UN sanctions against Iraq}}
Researcher [[Richard Garfield (nursing professor)|Richard Garfield]] estimated that &quot;a minimum of 100,000 and a more likely estimate of 227,000 excess deaths among young children from August 1991 through March 1998&quot; from all causes including sanctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.casi.org.uk/info/garfield/dr-garfield.html |title=Morbidity and Mortality Among Iraqi Children |publisher=Casi.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other estimates have ranged as low as 170,000 children.&lt;ref name=Welch2002&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reason.com/archives/2002/03/01/the-politics-of-dead-children |title=Reason Magazine â The Politics of Dead Children |publisher=Reason.com |date=2002-03-01 |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comw.org/pda/0310rm8.html#N_93_ |title=The Wages of War: Iraqi Combatant and Noncombatant Fatalities in the 2003 Conflict. PDA Research Monograph 8, 20 October 2003. Carl Conetta |publisher=Comw.org |date= |accessdate=2009-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UNICEF Executive Director Carol Bellamy said that&lt;blockquote&gt;if the substantial reduction in child mortality throughout Iraq during the 1980s had continued through the 1990s, there would have been half a million fewer deaths of children under-five in the country as a whole during the eight year period 1991 to 1998. As a partial explanation, she pointed to a March statement of the Security Council Panel on Humanitarian Issues which states: &quot;Even if not all suffering in Iraq can be imputed to external factors, especially sanctions, the Iraqi people would not be undergoing such deprivations in the absence of the prolonged measures imposed by the Security Council and the effects of war.&quot;
&lt;ref name=unicef99&gt;[http://www.unicef.org/newsline/99pr29.htm Iraq surveys show 'humanitarian emergency'] [[UNICEF]] Newsline August 12, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[US State Department]] has stated that Iraq was offered the [[Oil-for-Food Program]] designed to alleviate the humanitarian condition of Iraq in 1991 but that Iraq refused to accept it for years. It stated: &lt;blockquote&gt;In Northern Iraq, where the UN administers humanitarian assistance, child mortality rates have fallen below pre-Gulf War levels. Rates rose in the period before oil-for-food, but with the introduction of the program the trend reversed, and now those Iraqi children are better off than before the war. Child mortality figures have more than doubled in the south and center of the country, where the Iraqi governmentârather than the UNâcontrols the program. If a turn-around on child mortality can be made in the north, which is under the same sanctions as the rest of the country, there is no reason it cannot be done in the south and center.  The fact of the matter is, however, that the government of Iraq does not share the international community's concern about the welfare of its people. Baghdad's refusal to cooperate with the oil-for-food program and its deliberate misuse of resources are cynical efforts to sacrifice the Iraqi people's welfare in order to bring an end to UN sanctions without complying with its obligations.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/news/iraq/1999/09/iraq99.htm |title=Saddam Hussein's Iraq |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This view has been disputed by authors such as Anthony Arnove, who argued that the one-sided heaping of blame on the Baghdad government was overly simplistic and dishonest because Iraq's north received more supplies per capita;&lt;ref&gt;Arnove, Anthony. ''Iraq Under Siege: The Deadly Impact of Sanctions and War'', South End Press, April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; the State Department responded by saying that the rest of Iraq could order supplies &quot;without limit&quot; but was simply refusing to purchase them in adequate quantities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usembassy.it/pdf/other/iraqfocus1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Bill Clinton]] argued that Iraq actually had far more money to spend on humanitarian supplies under the sanctions regime than it would have had over the same period based on the trends that existed before the Gulf War, adding that &quot;we have worked like crazy&quot; to avoid the unnecessary suffering of civilians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2004/6/22/bill_clinton_loses_his_cool_in Bill Clinton Loses His Cool in Democracy Now! Interview on Everything But Monica: Leonard Peltier, Racial Profiling, the Iraqi Sanctions, Ralph Nader, the Death Penalty and th...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Critics of sanctions, however, argued that UN prohibitions on items that could (allegedly) be used for chemical or biological weapons exacerbated the situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.i-p-o.org/sanctpap.htm Hans Koechler (ed.), ECONOMIC SANCTIONS AND DEVELOPMENT - Studies in International Relations, XXIII - Vienna: International Progress Organization, 1997&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A study in the ''[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]]'' argued that the sanctions, in and of themselves, would actually have saved lives in that they ''required'' the government to spend at least 72% of its income on human services, whereas the government had previously never spent more than 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rubin |first=Michael |title=Sanctions on Iraq: A Valid Anti-American Grievance? |publisher=[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]] |volume=5 |issue=4 |url=http://meria.idc.ac.il/journal/2001/issue4/mrubin.pdf |pages=100â115 |date=December 2001 |authorlink=Michael Rubin }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Significance (journal)|Significance]],'' economist Michael Spagat argues that the ICMMS survey, the only one (of four) international sanctions surveys (graphed in his paper) to show a dramatic increase in child mortality, is suspect because of the abusive, manipulative nature of the Iraqi regime. He offers two possible explanations for the north/south discrepancy:
&lt;blockquote&gt;First, the Kurdish zone was
free of Saddamâs control. In the South/centre,
though, the reaction of Saddam Husseinâs
regime to the sanctions must be part of a full
explanation for child mortality patterns in
this zone. ... A second potential explanation for the
strange patterns displayed by the South/
Centre in the [data] is that they were not
real, but rather results of manipulations by
the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name=Spagat&gt;{{cite web|url=http://personal.rhul.ac.uk/uhte/014/Truth%20and%20Death.pdf |title=Truth and death in Iraq under sanctions |first=Michael |last=Spagat |date=2010 September |publisher=[[Significance (journal)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
