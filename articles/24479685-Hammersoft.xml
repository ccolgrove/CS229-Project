==Synopsis Beginning==

The Zheng family lives in a five room HDB flat in Bishan. It comprises the money-minded eldest son Zheng Shanguo (Huang Wenyong), his materialistic wife Zhang Yuxiang (Chen Liping), and his daughters, the hot-tempered Aizhen (Yvonne Lim), the hypochondriac Aishan (Belinda Lee) and the slow and simple Aimei (Cai Peixuan). The other two occupants of the flat are Shanguo's elderly mother Lu Qiaomei (Hong Damu), who is always armed with a plan for every situation, and Shanguo's wayward younger brother, Shuiguo (Yao Wenlong). The Zheng family runs a coffeeshop with two outlets, one in Bishan and the other in Jurong West.

Living directly opposite them is the Li family, which comprises the bedridden Jianzhou (Liang Tian), his wife Jinyin (Jin Yinji), and their grandchildren Liqin (Shuan Chen) and Lifen (Paige Chua). They had moved to Bishan a decade ago to begin a new life after the murder of Jianzhou's son by his wife Qiumei (Jue Xi). Liqin had been at odds with Aizhen for a long time and they never fail to bicker when they meet. Jinyin is a gambler, and she had raised Liqin and Lifen with her earnings from her mahjong games, earning her the nickname 'Granny Mahjong'. Liqin and Jinyin are both very protective of Lifen, and she knows nothing about the murder of her father. She had been told from young that her parents had died in a fire.

Soon, Aizhen meets Fang Kai (Pierre Png), a rich young man who preferred to keep his immense wealth secret. Fang Kai is Liqin's best friend in university, and Aizhen tries to get more information about Fang Kai through him. Aizhen meets Fang Kai again on the set of Lifen's short film. Fang Kai poses as part of the middle class, but in fact is the son of the magnate Jason Fang. Jason is married to Janet, but the love between them has long gone. They pretend to be a happy family for the cameras, but this changes when Janet slaps Zen (Lynn Poh), a widowed film producer, who threatens to sue her. The case is later withdrawed.

Qiumei is released from prison and tries to find her family. In the process, she manages to get a job at 899, which Shanguo runs. She eventually meets her family after information from a friendly police officer, Lin Hanwen (Huang Shinan), but she is kicked out by Jinyin and Liqin, much to the horror of Qiaomei and Aizhen. They decide to take her in, but it is not long after that she is fired by Yuxiang when she learns that Qiumei was a convicted murderer.

==Character Bonds==
===Yuxiang and Shanguo===
Yuxiang fancies a large bungalow at Lentor Plain, but Shanguo is miserly and refuses to even consider buying it. Yuxiang comes up with an elaborate scheme to persuade Shanguo to buy the house, and contacts Lin Duoli (Pan Lingling), her property agent friend, to help her. Eventually, they move into the bungalow, much to Qiaomei's disappointment. Shanguo decides to transfer ownership of the flat to Qiaomei and Shuiguo.

===Duoli and Hanwen===
Duoli is undergoing a divorce from Hanwen because Hanwen banged their 1st son(Xiao Dong)by accident.Ever since Duoli will not forget what Han Wen did in the past . They promise to keep this a secret from their children until Xiaoxi (Leron Heng), their eldest daughter, turns 18 and finishes her 'A' Level examinations. They continue to sleep in the same room to prevent their children from knowing anything. While packing, Xiaoxi finds out that her parents were divorced, but she keeps quiet, pretending not to know anything.

===Yuxiang and Youli===
Yuxiang moves into her new house and is happy with everything but her neighbours, the Wus- Youli (Cavin Soh) and Youqing (Joanne Peh). Youli is a rag-and-bone man who had gotten rich with his investments, while Youqing is a hot prospect in the legal world, a rising talent within PP Yeo's (Henry Heng) law firm. Yuxiang is always embroiled in quarrels with him, and they frequently threaten each other with lawsuits. Youli mocks Yuxiang for her branded clothing and accessories, calling her a 'Christmas Tree', and Yuxiang counters by giving Youli the nickname 'Weirdo'. Youli keeps a cloth around his neck at all times to hide his tumour. He refuses to have it removed as he is afraid of operations and hospitals.

===Youqing, Fang Kai and Yue Guang===
Youqing is cold on the exterior but is a warm person inside. She was kidnapped as a child and was trapped together with a young boy who had told her the story of the Tortoise Prince. This boy, as would be revealed later on in the series, was actually Fang Kai. In memory of the boy, she keeps several tortoises as pets. As a result of the trauma from the kidnapping experience, she develops claustrophobia and a general distrust towards men. She puts up a cold exterior in defense of her inner psychological scars. All this changes when she meets Yue Guang (Zhang Yaodong) a psychiatrist. She mistakes him for a pervert at first, but later falls in love with him. The feelings are mutual and they get together in a few weeks. Youli likes Yue Guang and places his stamp of approval on the relationship.

===Aizhen and Fang Kai===
Meanwhile, love blossoms between Aizhen and Fang Kai. Despite their frequent quarrels, they are deeply in love with each other. Fang Kai does not want to enter business like his father, instead deciding to run a LAN shop in a shopping centre. Yuxiang is greatly displeased with their relationship as she wants Aizhen to be with a rich man. Yuxiang thinks that Fang Kai is a gigolo and teams up with her friend Helen (Cassandra See) to sabotage their relationship. All of their attempts fail miserably.

It is not long before Yuxiang finds out about Fang Kai's real identity. She immediately endorses their relationship and Aizhen and Fang Kai can now continue their relationship openly. Lifen's friendship with Aizhen is marred when she briefly creates a love triangle between the couple, but Fang Kai has eyes only for Aizhen.

Aizhen is a job hopper who always has bad relationships with her superiors. But after meeting Yang Yan (Le Yao), a reporter, she decides to enter Clear Sky News Agency as a reporter as well. At the agency, she immediately has spats with Yang Yan and her cameraman, Ah Boon. They constantly collaborate to make trouble for Aizhen, but most of their plans are foiled. Aizhen gets the chance to appear of television, and Yuxiang is very proud of her, but is very disappointed when only her daughter's voice is heard.

==Viewership Ratings==
The drama did not fare very well in ratings. One reason is due to the fact that Korean Drama Cruel Temptation was running at the same time on Channel U which attracted many viewers.
The initial part of the drama attracted an average of 680,000 viewers, middle part 730,000 and above 800,000 towards the ending. At one time, the ratings plunged to a low of 400,000, making it the long-running drama produced by Mediacorp with the lowest ratings. Viewers of Your Hand In Mine suggested that Cruel Temptation should be aired in the weekend to fight head on with Taiwanese drama Love, instead of Glory of Family which was airing during weekends.

==Trivia==
*Se Ce was to be played by Sharon Wong; but she played Felicia Fang instead.
*Yue Caipiao was to play Yue Guang's daughter. However, due to a change in the script, her character was renamed Cui Ruanfei and separated from Yue Guang's storyline.
* [[Hayden Hee]] is the brother of [[Julian Hee]], a Mediacorp artiste.
*Jason Fang's hairstyle resembles that of [[Lucas Chia]], the Mediacorp CEO from 2005 to 2011.
* [[Joanne Peh]] playes two roles in the serial, as daughter and mother Wu Youqing and Liu Jinlian. [[Wang Yuqing]] also plays two roles, as the twins Zhao Dezhu and Zhao Dedao.
* The serial's first opening sequence ran from Episodes 1 to 90, while the second will run from Episode 91 to the finale (Episode 180).
* The theme song of the serial has three different renditions, by the band Milubing, Cavin Soh, and Teresa Tseng. They have the same lyrics but different tunes.
*[[Joanne Peh]] and [[Zhang Yao Dong]] act together for the second time after [[The Greatest Love of All]]. They made their third pair-up in [[A Tale of 2 Cities]], another TV drama.

*[[Zhang Yao Dong]] and [[Pierre Png]] pairs up in this drama as well as [[The Score]] and [[A Tale of 2 Cities]].

==[[Star Awards 2011]] Nominations==
* [[Shaun Chen]], the villain of this drama, was ironically nominated for the Best Actor, but lost to [[Qi Yu Wu]] in [[The Family Court]].
