'''K Desktop Environment 1''' was the inaugural series of releases of the '''K Desktop Environment''' (now called ''[[KDE Software Compilation]]''). There were two major releases in this series.

==Pre-Release==
[[Image:KDE Beta3.png|250px|thumb|left|K Desktop Environment Beta 3]]
The development of KDE started right after [[Matthias Ettrich|Matthias Ettrichâs]] announcement on 1996-10-14 to found the ''Kool Desktop Environment''. The word ''Kool'' was dropped shortly afterward and the name became simply ''K Desktop Environment''.

In the beginning, all components were released to the developer community separately without any coordinated timeframe throughout the overall project. First communication of KDE via mailing list, that was called ''kde@fiwi02.wiwi.uni-Tubingen.de''.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first coordinated release was ''Beta 1'' on 1997-10-20 â almost exactly one year after the original announcement. Three additional Betas followed 1997-11-23, 1998-02-01, and 1998-04-19.&lt;ref name=&quot;kdehistory&quot; /&gt;

==K Desktop Environment 1.0==
In the 1.0 release announcement the KDE team outlined the project and its reasons for creation:
{{Cquote2|quotetext=KDE is a network transparent, contemporary desktop environment for UNIX  workstations. KDE seeks to fill the need for an easy to use desktop for Unix workstations, similar to the desktop environments found under the MacOS or Window95/NT. We believe that the UNIX operating system is the best operating system available today. In fact UNIX has been the undisputed choice of the information technology professional for many years.  When it comes to stability, scalability and openness there is no competition to UNIX. However, the lack of an easy to use contemporary desktop environment for UNIX has prevented UNIX from finding its way onto the desktops of the typical computer user in offices and homes.

With KDE there is now an easy to use, contemporary desktop environment available for UNIX. Together with a free implementation of UNIX such as Linux, UNIX/KDE constitutes a completely free and open computing platform available to anyone free of charge including its source code for anyone to modify. While there will always be room for improvement we believe to have delivered a viable alternative to some of the more commonly found and commercial operating systems/desktops combinations available today. It is our hope that the combination UNIX/KDE will finally bring open, reliable, stable and monopoly free computing to the average computer.
