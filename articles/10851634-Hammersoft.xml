2. Salma Arastuâs 3â tall aluminum sculpture &quot;The Family&quot; has been selected to be in an international exhibition organized by Ekateringburg Art Foundation in Russia beginning September 2010.
The project was initiated in Russia in 2005 under the name &quot;In Family Unity â Unity of the Nation&quot; by Ekaterinburg Art Foundation. The exhibition has been held in 25 cities of Russia, including the Kremlin, The Council of Federation of the Federal Assembly of Russia and State Duma. In June 2009 the All-Russian exhibition took part during the summits of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization and BRIC. Positive results of the exhibition activities in a variety of regions made us believe that at the present moment we can already work on the international exhibition project as well. We suggest to unite the works of sculptors and photographers that are devoted to the topic announced. 
The aim of the project is propaganda of eternal human values by means of sculpture, art and photography.
The main goal of the exhibition is to unite the creative potential of sculptors and photographers from different countries in order to establish universal values and national peculiarities on the topic announced.
