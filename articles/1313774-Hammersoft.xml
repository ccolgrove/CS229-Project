'''Lionel-Groulx''' is a [[metro station|station]] of the [[Montreal Metro]] [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]] operated by the [[SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al]] (STM). It is located in the [[Saint-Henri]] area of the borough of [[Le Sud-Ouest]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stm.info/English/metro/a-m36.htm Lionel-Groulx Station]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a transfer station between the [[Line 1 Green (Montreal Metro)|Green Line]] and [[Line 2 Orange (Montreal Metro)|Orange Line]].

The station served 3.9 million passengers in 2006 without including transfers. If they were included, it would be ranked among the top four busiest in the network with about 15 million passengers.

The station opened on September 3, 1978 as part of the extension of the Green Line to [[Angrignon (Montreal Metro)|Angrignon]], with service on the Green Line only, though the Orange Line [[Railway platform|platforms]] were built at the same time. They did not enter service until the extension to [[Place-Saint-Henri (Montreal Metro)|Place-Saint-Henri]] was opened on April 28, 1980. It was therefore the first transfer station to open after [[Berri-UQAM (Montreal Metro)|Berri-UQAM]], in the original network.

In 2009 it became the first existing station to be retrofitted to be fully [[wheelchair]]-[[accessibility|accessible]] through the addition of [[elevator]]s. [[Berri-UQAM (Montreal Metro)|Berri-UQAM]] station had elevators added at the same time, but only between the mezzanine and orange line platforms. (The three stations in [[Laval, Quebec|Laval]], opened in 2007, already had elevators.) Three elevators connect the entrance to the mezzanine, the mezzanine to the upper platform, and the upper platform to the lower platform, respectively.

The station, built in open cut, features stacked [[Side platform|platforms]] with central platforms between the lines; the orange line is to the south and the green line to the north. The platforms are arranged in an anti-directional [[cross-platform interchange]], with the two inbound lines ([[Montmorency (Montreal Metro)|Montmorency]] and [[HonorÃ©-Beaugrand (Montreal Metro)|HonorÃ©-Beaugrand]]) on the upper level, and the two outbound lines ([[CÃ´te-Vertu (Montreal Metro)|CÃ´te-Vertu]] and [[Angrignon (Montreal Metro)|Angrignon]]) on the lower level. This allows the majority of passengers to transfer by simply walking across the platform, without having to go up or down [[Stairway|stairs]]. The station's [[Mezzanine (architecture)|mezzanine]], suspended on [[Beam (structure)|beams]], is located above the upper platform, and gives access to the single entrance.

The station was designed by Yves Roy. It contains two [[Work of art|artwork]]s: a pair of [[stainless steel]] [[mural]] [[sculpture]]s by the architect over the mezzanine, and in the mezzanine itself, a sculpture called ''The Tree of Life'' by Italian artist [[Joseph Rifesser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://spacingmontreal.ca/2008/12/30/photo-du-jour-metro-memories/|title=Metro Memories|last=Heffez|first=Alanah|date=2008-12-30|work=Spacing Montreal|accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Representing the races of humanity growing from a common root, it was carved from the entire trunk of a [[walnut]] tree, it was originally located at [[Expo 67|Man and His World]] and was given to the Montreal metro by the [[United Nations]].

The station is equipped with the MÃ©troVision information screens which displays news, commercials, and the time till the next train.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for rue Lionel-Groulx, which had its name changed to allow the station to commemorate [[Lionel Groulx]]. Groulx, one of the most influential of Quebec historians, founded the Franco-American History Institute in 1946 and edited the ''Revue d'histoire de l'AmÃ©rique franÃ§aise'' from 1947 to 1967. 

In November 1996, the League for Human Rights of [[B'nai Brith]] Canada officially requested that the Executive Committee of the Montreal Urban Community (M.U.C.) recommend a name change to the Lionel Groulx metro station in Montreal, due to anti-semitic statements made by Lionel Groulx.

Likewise, there has been a recent movement to rename the Lionel-Groulx Metro station in honour of [[Oscar Peterson]]. Although this movement started on the website [[Facebook]], the story has recently been picked up by the media. The issue has become quite controversial and political.
