The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Detroit Lions]] season''' was the 79th season for the franchise in the [[National Football League]]. Although the Lions had a flawless preseason with a 4-0 record, the Lions became the first team in NFL history to compile an 0-16 record in regular season play. They were mathematically eliminated from playoff contention after Week 11. Team president and CEO [[Matt Millen]] was fired on September 24, while head coach [[Rod Marinelli]] and most of his assistants were fired the day after the season ended. This season has been framed as the [[Detroit Lions]] worst season ever, and - statistically - the worst season ever in football.

To celebrate their 75th year playing as the Lions (they had been known as the Portsmouth Spartans their first four seasons), the Lions wore special throwback uniforms for two home games, a replica of the ones used in 1934, the first year as the Lions. The uniforms had blue jerseys with silver lettering, solid silver pants, blue socks, and solid silver helmets (as helmets were leather back then). This replaced their black alternate jersey used in the 2005-2007 seasons.

Because the Lions went undefeated in exhibition games, they were dubbed by the media as &quot;The Pre-season Champions&quot;. [http://savannahnow.com/node/592494 T-shirts] were made to reflect this.

The Lions began their 2008 season at the [[Georgia Dome]] against the [[2008 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]]. A pre-season poll on [http://www.thespread.com/sports-betting-top-stories-900/2008-09-nfl-super-bowl-odds-to-win.html thespread.com] said the Falcons (who finished 11-5 before losing in the Wild Card round of the playoffs), were less likely (dead last for that matter) to make the Super Bowl than the Lions. In the first quarter, Detroit trailed early as QB [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] completed a 62-yard TD pass to WR [[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]], while RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] scored twice; in which he ran a 66-yard TD run and then a 5-yard TD run.

The Colts struck first when [[Dominic Rhodes]] ran in a TD from 1 yard out midway through the first quarter. The Lions would respond a few minutes later with a 51 yard field goal by Jason Hanson.  With just under 6 minutes left in the half, [[Chad Simpson]] of the Colts ran in a TD from 2 yards out. Calvin Johnson of the Lions responded a few minutes later by catching a 33 yard TD pass.  The Colts struck back with just under a minute in the half, when [[Dallas Clark]] caught a 3 yard TD pass.

The only points for either team in the 3rd quarter was a Jason Hanson 30 yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Kevin Smith ran in a TD from 1 yard out. The Lions decided to go for the 2 point conversion to tie it up and were successful when Casey Fitzsimmons caught a pass and ran it in. The Colts responded with another Dominic Rhodes 1 yard TD run. They put it away with a 31 yard Adam Vinatieri field goal. 

With the loss to the Colts, the Lions became the third team (after the [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1976 Buccaneers]] and the [[1980 New Orleans Saints season|1980 Saints]]) to lose the first 14 games of the regular season.

With their 11th straight road loss, the Lions fell to 0-14 and 0-4 against AFC Opponents.

For their last home game of the season, the Lions took on the [[2008 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]].  Detroit trailed early in the first quarter as Saints wide receiver [[Robert Meachem]] got a 20-yard touchdown run, along with running back [[Deuce McAllister]] getting a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Lions would respond in the second quarter with rookie running back [[Kevin Smith (running back)|Kevin Smith]] getting a 1-yard touchdown run.  However, New Orleans answered with running back [[Mike Bell (running back)|Mike Bell]] getting a 1-yard touchdown run, along with running back [[Pierre Thomas (American football)|Pierre Thomas]] getting a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Saints would then close out the game's scoring in the third quarter quarterback [[Drew Brees]] completing a 6-yard and a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Marques Colston]].

With the loss, the Lions became the first team in NFL history to have a record of 0-15. They also became the first team to lose 15 straight in a single season since the [[2001 Carolina Panthers season|2001 Carolina Panthers]], who won their first game, then lost the remaining 15 to go 1-15.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsline.com/nfl/story/11191082 An 0-16 season -- that's even painful to write]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wikinews|NFL: Packers defeat Lions 31â21, Lions become first team to finish season with 0-16 record}}
For their last chance to avoid becoming the first 0-16 team in NFL history, the Lions traveled to [[Green Bay, Wisconsin]] to take on division rivals the [[2008 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] (who Detroit had not beaten on the road since [[1991 Detroit Lions season|1991]]). The Packers struck first midway through the first quarter when [[Deshawn Wynn]] ran in a career long 73 yard TD. They made it 14-0 when [[Jermichael Finley]] caught a 3 yard TD pass near the end of the first quarter. The Lions got on the board in the second quarter when Calvin Johnson caught a 9 yard TD pass. At the end of the half, Will Blackmon called a fair catch as time expired, allowing Mason Crosby to attempt a rare 69 yard field goal. Crosby kicked it accurately but it fell just a yard short with the wind blowing against him. Before the game, Crosby also attempted a 64 yard field goal. Calvin Johnson scored another TD to tie it up in the 3rd quarter when he caught a 14 yard pass. The Packers responded just after the start of the 4th quarter with a 36 yard [[Mason Crosby]] field goal, and later with a [[John Kuhn]] 5 yard TD catch. The Lions responded less than a minute later with a Kevin Smith 9 yard TD run. The Packers sealed the Lions' fate though with a 71 yard TD pass caught by [[Donald Driver]].

With the loss, the Lions became only the second NFL team of the post-[[NFL-AFL merger|merger]] era to go winless without a tie in the regular season, and the first to go 0-16. (The [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] also went winless, but that was when the regular season only had 14 games.) The Lions ended 2008 having lost 23 of their last 24 regular-season games, going back to the [[2007 Detroit Lions season|previous season]]. The Lions also finished 2008 with 17 consecutive regular season losses (the NFL record is 26 by the Buccaneers, who lost the next twelve games after their winless season).

After allowing 31 points to the Packers, it brought their season total points allowed to 517. This is the second highest point total allowed in a single season in NFL history, trailing only the 533 allowed by the [[1981 NFL season|1981]] [[Indianapolis Colts|Baltimore Colts]].

After the final game of the season, Lions' radio [[play-by-play]] announcer [[Dan Miller (sportscaster)|Dan Miller]] summed up the whole year in a few sentences:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/videos?videoId=09000d5d80f09bc8 NFL Network - State of the Lions]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Cquote|Clock ticks down here in Green Bay. The Lions find themselves in a very familiar position. For 16 weeks, starting in Atlanta back in September, they took the field thinking this was gonna be their day. Sixteen times they were wrong, and now there are no Sundays left. By record, they are the worst team in league history. Zero and 16, those are the numbers that will forever be associated with the Detroit Lions.|200|200|Dan Miller|December 28, 2008, on the [[Detroit Lions Radio Network]], after the Detroit Lions become the first team in the history of the NFL to go 0-16.}}

On the [[NFL Network]]'s &quot;Top 10 Worst Teams of All Time&quot;, the 2008 Lions were recently placed at #1, with the 0-14 [[1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|1976 Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] falling to #2.
