'''Xdrive''' was an [[online storage]] company based in the [[United States]]. Its key feature was a desktop client which integrated Windows Explorer with the user's Xdrive account. By default, the drive letter mapping was &quot;X:&quot;. Early versions of the desktop client were based on [[WebDrive]] from South River Technologies. Xdrive was acquired by [[AOL]] on August 3, 2005 and provided as a service which allowed users to back up their files over the Internet. It offered a free 5 [[Gigabyte|GB]] account (free [[online storage]]) to anyone with an AOL screenname.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pogue&quot;&gt;{{cite news

In July 2008, it was reported that AOL would sell or close Xdrive along with several other personal media properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schonfeld&quot;&gt;{{cite news
