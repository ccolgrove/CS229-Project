An '''ISO image''' ([[International Organization for Standardization]]) is an [[archive file]] (also known as a [[disc image]]) of an [[optical disc]], composed of the data contents of every written sector of an optical disc, including the optical disc file system&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcsupport.about.com/od/termsi/g/ISOfile.htm] Definition: An ISO file, often called an ISO image, is in fact an &quot;image&quot; of an entire CD or DVD. The entire contents of a disc can be perfectly represented in a single ISO file.&lt;/ref&gt;.  ISO images can be created from optical discs or from a collection of [[computer file|files]] by image creation software; images can be used to write optical discs.  Software distributed on bootable discs is often available for download in ISO image format, and used to write a CD or DVD. ISO image files often have a [[file extension]] of ''.iso''. The name ''ISO'' is taken from the [[ISO 9660]] [[file system]] used with CD-ROM media, but what is known as an ISO image might also contain a [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] (ISO/IEC 13346) file system or a [[DVD]] or [[Blu-ray Disc]] (BD) image.

== Details ==
=== Advantages ===
ISO images are stored in an uncompressed format. Any CD or DVD can be archived by .ISO format as a true digital copy of the original.  The ISO image file is not stored in a container file. Unlike a physical optical disc, an image can be transferred over any data link or removable storage medium.

What is known as a &quot;valid&quot; ISO image is an uncompressed collection of various files merged into one single resulting file, according to definite and standard formatting.

An ISO image can be rendered, or &quot;burned,&quot; to a CD, DVD, or BD by using media [[Optical disc authoring|authoring]] or disc burning software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/ht/burnisofile.htm] How To Burn an ISO Image File to a CD, DVD or BD - Source: About.com&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be opened using any [[file archiver]]. ISO burning is now typically a native feature of modern home and business computer operating systems.

[[Hybrid disc]] formats include the ability to be read by different devices, operating systems, or hardware. In the past, one example of this was a disc that supported both [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] from a single disc image. A later example is the release of hybrid ISO files which can be [[booting|booted]] or started from both BD or DVD and [[USB]] flash drive devices when the image is written to any of these [[Data storage device|storage device]]s.

An ISO can be &quot;mounted&quot; with suitable [[Device driver|driver]] software, i.e. treated by the operating system as if it were a physical optical disc. Most [[Unix]]-based operating systems, including GNU/Linux and Mac OS X, have built-in capability to mount an ISO; in other cases software drivers can be installed to achieve the same objective.

=== Limitations ===
ISO images of CD-Audio discs cannot be made; CD-Audio discs do not use a computer [[file system]], but are formatted in [[Track_(CD)|tracks]]; track numbers, index points and CD time code are encoded into the [[Lead-in (CD)|lead-in]] of the CD-Audio disc, and these reference points are found throughout the CD-Audio sub-channel. To store an accurate copy of a CD-Audio disc, a different image format must be used, such as [[Disc Description Protocol|DDP]] or BIN/CUE.

ISO images are also unable to store multi-track disc images.

{{As of|2011|2}} no &quot;portable&quot; programs for the Windows OS were known to exist that were capable of mounting ISOs on a USB flash (&quot;thumb&quot;) drive or of reading them from such a drive. It is believed that this was because mounting and/or reading ISOs in Windows NT and later, network-based, versions of Windows OS required a driver, which is inaccessible to users of these operating systems who lack administrative privileges. {{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}
