The '''Indian Air Force''' ('''IAF'''; [[DevanÄgarÄ«]]: à¤­à¤¾à¤°à¤¤à¥à¤¯  à¤µà¤¾à¤¯à¥ à¤¸à¥à¤¨à¤¾, ''Bhartiya VÄyu SenÄ'') is the [[air force|air arm]] of the [[Indian armed forces]]. Its primary responsibility is to secure Indian [[airspace]] and to conduct [[aerial warfare]] during a conflict. It was officially established on 8 October 1932 as an auxiliary air force of the [[British Raj|Indian Empire]] and the prefix ''Royal'' was added in 1945 in recognition of its services during [[World War II]]. After India achieved independence from the United Kingdom in 1947, the [[Royal Indian Air Force]] served the [[Dominion of India]], with the prefix being dropped when India became a republic in 1950.

Since independence, the IAF has been involved in [[Indo-Pakistani Wars|four wars]] with neighbouring [[Pakistan]] and one with the People's Republic of China. Other major operations undertaken by the IAF include [[Invasion of Goa|Operation ''Vijay'' - the invasion of Goa]], [[Operation Meghdoot|Operation ''Meghdoot'']], [[Operation Cactus|Operation ''Cactus'']] and [[Operation Poomalai]]. Apart from conflicts, the IAF has been an active participant in [[History of United Nations peacekeeping|United Nations peacekeeping missions]].

The [[President of India]] serves as the [[Commander-in-Chief, India|Commander-in-Chief]] of the IAF. The [[Chief of Air Staff (India)|Chief of Air Staff]], an Air Chief Marshal (ACM), is a [[four-star rank|four-star]] commander and commands the Air Force. There is never more than one serving ACM at any given time in the IAF. One officer [[Arjan Singh]], DFC has been conferred the rank of Marshal of the Air Force, a five-star rank and the officer serves as the ceremonial chief. 

With a strength of approximately 170,000 personnel and around [[List of aircraft of the Indian Air Force#Current aircraft|1,330 aircraft]].The Indian Air Force is the world's fourth largest air force.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indian Air Force&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Indian Air Force | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/airforce.htm | work=| publisher=Global Security | date= | accessdate=17 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, the IAF has undertaken an ambitious [[Indian Air Force#Future aircraft|expansion and modernisation]] program to replace its aging Soviet-era fighter jets.

[[File:IAF Roundels.gif|thumb|170px|Evolution of the IAF Roundel over the years:&lt;br&gt; '''1)'''1933-1942 '''2)'''1942-1945&lt;br&gt;'''3)'''1947-1950 '''4)'''1950-Present&lt;ref name=&quot;roundel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Indian Air Force Museum - Badges and Heraldry|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Museum/Palam/Heraldry.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The IAF's mission is defined by the Armed Forces Act of 1947, [[Constitution of India]] and the Air Force Act of 1950,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Air Force Act, 1950 |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= |publisher=Ministry of Law &amp; Justice |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=http://indiacode.nic.in/rspaging.asp?tfnm=195045 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the aerial [[battlespace]], as:
{{Cquote|Defence of India and every part thereof including preparation for defence and all such acts as may be conducive in times of war to its prosecution and after its termination to effective demobilisation.}}

Thus, the IAF has the primary objective of safeguarding Indian territory and national interests from all threats in conjunction with the other branches of the armed forces by defending Indian airspace. The IAF provides close air support to the [[Indian Army]] troops in the battlefield and also provides strategic and tactical airlift capabilities. The IAF also operates the [[Integrated Space Cell]] together with the other two branches of the [[Indian Armed Forces]], the civilian [[Department of Space]] and the [[Indian Space Research Organization]] (ISRO) to utilize more effectively the country's space-based assets for military purposes and to look into threats to these assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;India in aerospace defence plan&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=India in aerospace defence plan | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/6307875.stm | work=| publisher=BBC | date=28 January 2011 | accessdate=24 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpaceDaily&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=India Begins Work On Space Weapons Command | url=http://www.spacewar.com/reports/India_Begins_Work_On_Space_Weapons_Command.html | work=| publisher=SpaceDaily | date=12 April 2007 | accessdate=24 Apr. 2006}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian Air Force along with the other branches of the Indian Armed Forces provide assistance in disaster relief such as during natural calamities by undertaking evacuation or search-and-rescue (SAR) operations and air dropping relief supplies in affected areas.&lt;ref name=ATCP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/iaf.php |title= Aid to Civil Power |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAF provided extensive assistance to relief operations during natural calamities such as the Gujarat cyclone in 1998 and the Tsunami in 2004.&lt;ref name=ATCP/&gt; The IAF also provides assistance to other countries during relief activities such as Operation Rainbow in Sri Lanka.&lt;ref name=ATCP/&gt;

{{Main|History of the Indian Air Force}}

===Formation and World War II===
[[File:IAF Wapiti K1260.jpg|thumb|A [[Westland Wapiti]], one of the first aircraft of the Indian Air Force.]]
The Indian Air Force was established in [[British India]] as an auxiliary air force&lt;ref name=&quot;clause4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=HC Deb 3 April 2011 vol 276 cc1473-501 | url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1933/apr/03/clause-4-relations-between-royal-air|work=[[Hansard]] | publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom]]| date= | accessdate=8 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Royal Air Force]] with the enactment of the Indian Air Force Act 1932 on 8 October that year&lt;ref name=&quot;IAF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= History of the IAF | url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=98 | work=Official Website| publisher=Webmaster IAF â Air Headquarters  | date= | accessdate=7 Apr 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;airpower3&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bedi |first=Sanjeev |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008 |month=Summer |title=Strategic Role of Air Power |journal=Air Power Journal|volume=3| publisher=Center for Air Power Studies|issue=2 |pages=27â45 |id= |url=http://www.aerospaceindia.org/Journals/Summer%202008/Sanjeev%20Bedi.pdf |accessdate=8 Apr. 2010 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and adopted the Royal Air Force uniforms, badges, brevets and insignia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heraldry&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Museum/Palam/Heraldry.html|title=INDIAN AIR FORCE MUSEUM - Heraldry (Badges and Insignia)|publisher=Bharat Rakshak}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 April 1933, the IAF commissioned its first squadron, [[No. 1 Squadron, Indian Air Force|No.1 Squadron]], with four [[Westland Wapiti]] [[biplanes]] and five Indian pilots. The Indian pilots were led by Flight Lieutenant (later Air Vice Marshal) [[Sir Cecil Bouchier|Cecil Bouchier]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Goyal&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Goyal | first=S.N.| title=1939â45 Second World War: Air Force  Reminiscences | url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1940s/Goyal.html | work=Sainik Samachar  | publisher=Indian Air Force | date=October 1993 | accessdate=8 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1941, No. 1 Squadron remained the only squadron of the IAF, though two more [[Flight (military unit)|flights]] were added.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goyal&quot;/&gt; There were only two branches in the Air Force when it was formed, namely the Ground Duty (GD) branch and the Logistics branch. 

During [[World War II]], the red center was removed from the IAF roundel to eliminate confusion with the Japanese Hinomaru (&quot;Rising Sun&quot;) emblem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heraldry&quot;/&gt; The Air Force grew to seven squadrons in 1943 and to nine squadrons in 1945, equipping with Vultee Vengeance dive bombers and Hurricanes, along with a transport unit with the surviving A.W. 15 Atalantas until 1944.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goyal&quot;/&gt; The IAF helped in blocking the advance of the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese army]] in [[Myanmar|Burma]], where its first air strike was on the Japanese military base in [[Rakhine State|Arakan]]. It also carried out strike missions against the Japanese airbases at [[Mae Hong Son]], [[Chiang Mai]] and [[Chiang Rai]] in northern [[Thailand]]. In recognition of the crucial role played by the IAF, [[George VI of the United Kingdom|King George VI]] conferred it the prefix &quot;Royal&quot; in 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;airpower3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sainiksamachar&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mod.nic.in/samachar/oct1-01/html/ch4.htm|title=Indian Air Force : Down the Memory Lane|work=Sainik Samachar|date=October 2010|author=DâSouza, Bart|accessdate=7 Apr. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the war, many youth joined the [[Indian National Army]]. Forty five of them (known as the [[Tokyo Boys]]) were sent to train as fighter pilots at the [[Imperial Japanese Army Air Force Academy]] in 1944 by [[Subhas Chandra Bose]].&lt;ref name=&quot;benegal&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Books/Reviews/810-Burma-to-Japan.html|title=Bharat Rakshak Book Review|work=Burma to Japan with Azad Hind: A War Memoir (1941â1945) by Ramesh S Benegal|date= September 2011|accessdate=4 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, they were interned by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and were [[court-martial]]led. After Indian independence, some of them rejoined the IAF for service.&lt;ref name=&quot;benegal&quot;/&gt;

===First years of independence (1947â1950)===
After gaining independence from the British Empire in 1947, [[British Raj|British India]] was [[partition of India|partitioned]] into the new states of the [[Union of India]] and the [[Dominion of Pakistan]]. Along the lines of the geographical partition, the assets of the air force were divided between the new countries.  India's air force retained the name of the Royal Indian Air Force, but three of the ten operational squadrons and facilities, located within the borders of Pakistan, were transferred to the [[Royal Pakistan Air Force]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Engineer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Engineer|first=Aspy M.|title=Air Marshal Aspy Engineer's Recollections|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1940s/Aspy01.html|date=February 1993|publisher=Bharat Rakshak|accessdate=8 Apr. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RIAF Roundel was changed to an interim 'Chakra' roundel derived from the [[Ashoka Chakra]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Heraldry&quot;/&gt;

Around the same time, conflict broke out between them over the control of the [[Jammu and Kashmir (princely state)|princely state of Jammu &amp; Kashmir]]. With Pakistani forces moving into the state, its Maharaja decided to accede to India in order to receive military help.&lt;ref name=Lyon79&gt;{{Harvnb|Lyon|2008|p=79|Ref=Lyon}}&lt;/ref&gt; The day after [[Instrument of Accession (Jammu and Kashmir)|instrument of accession]] was signed, the RIAF was called upon to transport troops into the war-zone. And this was when a good management of logistics came into help.&lt;ref name=Lyon79/&gt; This led to the eruption of full scale war between India and Pakistan, though there was no formal declaration of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Massey|2005|p=97|Ref=Massey}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the war, the RIAF did not engage the Pakistan Air Force in air-to-air combat; however, it did provide effective transport and close air support to the Indian troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barua|2005|p=192|Ref=Barua}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When India became a [[republic]] in 1950, the prefix 'Royal' was dropped from the Indian Air Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;airpower3&quot;/&gt; At the same time, the current IAF roundel was adapted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heraldry&quot;/&gt;

===Congo crisis and liberation of Goa (1960â1961)===
The IAF saw significant conflict in 1960, when [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgium's 75-year rule]] over [[Republic of the Congo (LÃ©opoldville)|Congo]] ended abruptly, engulfing the nation in [[Congo Crisis|widespread violence and rebellion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Congolese Rescue Operation| url=http://www.history.army.mil/documents/AbnOps/TABE.htm | date= | work=| publisher=US Army History | accessdate=25 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAF sent [[No. 5 Squadron, Indian Air Force|No. 5 Squadron]], equipped with [[English Electric Canberra]], to support [[United Nations Operation in the Congo]]. The squadron started undertaking operational missions in November.&lt;ref name=&quot;airpower60&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Singh |first=Charanjit |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2005 |month=Monsoon |title=The Congo Diary |journal=Air Power Journal|volume=2| publisher=Center for Air Power Studies|issue=3 |pages=27â45 |id= |url=http://www.aerospaceindia.org/Journals/Monsoon%202005/The%20Congo%20Diary.pdf |accessdate=25 Apr 2009 |quote= }}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit remained there until 1966, when the UN mission ended.&lt;ref name=&quot;airpower60&quot;/&gt; Operating from [[Kinshasa|Leopoldville]] and [[Kamina]], the Canberras soon destroyed the rebel Air Force and provided the UN ground forces with its only long-range air support force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/air-force-history.htm|title=Air Force History|publisher=Global Security|accessdate=8 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1961, the Indian government decided to deploy the armed forces in an effort to evict the Portuguese out of [[Goa]] and other Enclaves after years of negotiation.&lt;ref name=brgoa1/&gt; The Indian Air Force was requested to provide support elements to the ground force in what was called [[Operation Vijay (1961)|Operation Vijay]]. Probing flights by some fighters and bombers were carried out from 8â18 December to draw out the [[Portuguese Air Force]], but to no avail.&lt;ref name=brgoa1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/1960s/Goa01.html|title=THE LIBERATION OF GOA: 1961|publisher=Bharat Rakshak|author=Jagan Pillarisetti}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 18, two waves of [[English Electric Canberra|Canberra]] bombers bombed the runway of Dabolim airfield taking care not to bomb the Terminals and the ATC tower. Two Portuguese transport aircraft (a [[Super Constellation]] and a [[DC-6]]) found on the airfield were left alone so that they can be captured intact. However the Portuguese pilots managed to take off the aircraft from the still damaged airfield and made their getaway to [[Portugal]].&lt;ref name=brgoa1/&gt; [[Hawker Hunter|Hunter]]s attacked the wireless station at Bambolim. [[De Havilland Vampire|Vampire]]s were used to provide air support to the ground forces.&lt;ref name=brgoa1/&gt; In [[Daman, Daman and Diu|Daman]], [[Dassault MystÃ¨re IV|MystÃ¨re]]s were used to strike Portuguese gun positions.&lt;ref name=brgoa1/&gt; [[Dassault Ouragan|Ouragans]] (called Toofanis in the IAF) bombed the runways at [[Diu, India|Diu]] and destroyed the control tower, wireless station and the meteorological station.&lt;ref name=brgoa1/&gt;

===Border disputes and changes in the IAF (1962â1971)===
{{See also|Aerial warfare in 1965 India Pakistan War}}
[[File:HAL-HF-24-Marut.jpg|thumb|[[HAL HF-24 Marut]], the first indigenous fighter jet to enter service with the Indian Air Force.]]
In 1962, border disagreements between China and India escalated to a war when China mobilised its troops across the Indian border.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pradhan|2010|p=185|Ref=Pradhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Sino-Indian War]], India's military planners failed to deploy and effectively use the IAF against the invading Chinese forces. This resulted in India losing a significant amount of advantage to the Chinese; especially in [[Jammu and Kashmir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Three years after the Sino-Indian conflict, in 1965, India went to war with Pakistan again over Kashmir in what came to be known as the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1965|Second Kashmir War]]. Learning from the experiences of the Sino-Indian war, India used its air force extensively during the war. This was the first time the IAF actively engaged an enemy air force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pradhan|Chavan|2007|p=xiv|Ref=ybChavan}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of providing close air support to the [[Indian Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Thomas|1996|p=11|Ref=Raju}}&lt;/ref&gt; the IAF carried out independent raids against [[Pakistan Air Force|PAF]] bases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sisodia|Bhaskar|2005|p=82|Ref=Emerging}}&lt;/ref&gt; These bases were situated deep inside Pakistani territory, making IAF fighters vulnerable to anti-aircraft fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Gupta|1997|p=43|Ref=Gupta}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the course of the conflict, the PAF enjoyed qualitative superiority over the IAF as most of the jets in IAF's fleet were of post World War II vintage. Despite this, the IAF was able to prevent the PAF from gaining air superiority over conflict zones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Dixit|2002|p=149|Ref=Dixit}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the conflict had ended, Pakistan claimed to have shot down 113 IAF aircraft while the Indians claimed 73 PAF aircraft were downed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barua|2005|p=193|Ref=Barua}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 60% of IAF's air combat losses took place during the battles over Kalaikunda and Pathankot; where most of the aircraft were destroyed while parked on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Khan|2004|p=185|Ref=Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1965 war, the IAF underwent a series of changes to improve its capabilities. In 1966, the [[Para Commandos (India)|Para Commandos]] regiment was created.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Praval|1975|p=6|Ref=Praval}}&lt;/ref&gt; To increase its logistics supply and rescue operations ability, the IAF inducted 72 [[HS 748]]s which were built by [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] (HAL) under license from [[Avro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|1985|p=78|Ref=Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; India started to put more stress on indigenous manufacture of [[fighter aircraft]]. As a result, [[HAL HF-24 Marut]], designed by the famed German [[aerospace engineer]] [[Kurt Tank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Boyne|Fopp|2002|p=619|Ref=Boyne}}&lt;/ref&gt; were inducted into the air force. HAL also started developing an improved version of the [[Folland Gnat]], known as [[HAL Ajeet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avgnat.html |title=The Folland Gnat / HAL Ajeet |date=1 December 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the IAF also started inducting [[Mach speed|Mach 2]] capable Soviet [[MiG-21]] and [[Sukhoi Su-7]] fighters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Whale of a Fighter: the Su-7 in IAF Service|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/History/Aircraft/Su-7.html|publisher=Bharat Rakshak |accessdate=5 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bangladesh Liberation War (1971)===
By late 1971, the intensification of the independence movement in erstwhile [[East Pakistan]] lead to the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] between India and Pakistan .&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sisson|Rose|1991|p=229|Ref=SissonRose}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 1971, 10 days before the start of a full-scale war, four PAF [[F-86 Sabre]] jets attacked Indian and [[Mukti Bahini]] positions at [[Battle of Garibpur|Garibpur]], near the international border. Three of the four PAF Sabres [[Battle of Boyra|were shot down]] by the IAF's [[Folland Gnat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ajithkumar|2006|p=141|Ref=Ajithkumar}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December, India formally [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|declared war]] against Pakistan following massive [[Operation Chengiz Khan|preemptive strikes]] by the PAF against Indian Air Force installations in Srinagar, Ambala, Sirsa, Halwara and Jodhpur. However, the IAF did not suffer significantly because the leadership had anticipated such a move and precautions were taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=20 December 1971|title= |journal=Newsweek |volume= |issue= |page=34 |id= |issn=0028-9604 |accessdate= |quote=Trying to catch the Indian Air Force napping, Yahya Khan, launched a Pakistani version of Israel's 1967 air blitz in hopes that one quick blow would cripple India's far superior air power.

Within the first two weeks, the IAF had carried out almost 2,000 sorties over East Pakistan and also provided [[East Pakistan Operations 1971|close air support]] to the advancing Indian Army.&lt;ref name=&quot;IAF71&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=The War Of December 1971 |url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=71|publisher=Indian Air Force |accessdate=3 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAF also assisted the [[Indian Navy]] in its operations against the [[Pakistani Navy]] and [[Paramilitary forces of Pakistan|Maritime Security Agency]] in the [[Bay of Bengal]] and [[Arabian Sea]].

===Incidents before Kargil (1984â1988)===
In 1984, India launched [[Operation Meghdoot]] to capture the [[Siachen Glacier]] in the contested [[Kashmir]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ives|2004|p=186|Ref=Ives}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAF's [[Mil Mi-8|Mi-8]], [[AÃ©rospatiale Alouette III|Chetak]] and [[Aerospatiale Lama|Cheetah]] helicopters airlifted hundreds of Indian troops to Siachen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Talbott|2006|p=164|Ref=Talbott}}&lt;/ref&gt; Launched on 13 April 1984, this military operation was unique because of Siachen's inhospitable terrain and climate. The military action was successful, given the fact that under a previous agreement, neither Pakistan nor India had stationed any personnel in the area. The Indian forces, facing no opposition, took control over most of the heights on the glacier.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Karthikeyan|Gupta|Sendilkumar|Jaganathan|2011|p=109|Ref=Karthikeyan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the IAF supported the [[Indian Peace Keeping Force]] (IPKF) in northern and eastern [[Sri Lanka]] in [[Operation Pawan]]. About 70,000 sorties were flown by the IAF's transport and helicopter force in support of nearly 100,000 troops and paramilitary forces without a single aircraft lost or mission aborted.&lt;ref name=oppawan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/|title=OP PAWAN|accessdate=24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAF An-32s maintained a continuous air link between air bases in South India and Northern Sri Lanka transporting men, equipment, rations and evacuating casualties.&lt;ref name=oppawan/&gt; Mi-8s supported the ground forces and also provided air transportation to the Sri Lankan civil administration during the elections.&lt;ref name=oppawan/&gt; Mi-25s of No. 125 Helicopter Unit were utilised to provide suppressive fire against militant strong points and to interdict coastal and clandestine riverine traffic.&lt;ref name=oppawan/&gt;

On the night of November 3, 1988, the Indian Air Force mounted special operations to airlift a parachute battalion group from [[Agra]], non-stop over 2000 kilometres to the remote Indian Ocean archipelago of the Maldives in response to Maldivian president [[Gayoom]]'s request for military help against a mercenary invasion in [[Operation Cactus]]. The [[IL-76]]s of No. 44 Squadron landed at [[Hulhule]] at 0030 hours and the Indian paratroopers secured the airfield and restored Government rule at Male within hours.&lt;ref name=iafo/&gt;

===Kargil War (1999)===

The helicopters were immediately withdrawn from offensive roles as a measure against the man-portable missiles in possession of the infiltrators. On 30 May, the Indian Air Force called into operation the [[Mirage 2000]] which was deemed the best aircraft capable of optimum performance under the conditions of high-altitude seen in the zone of conflict. Mirage 2000s not only had better defence equipment compared to the MiGs, but also gave IAF the ability to carry out aerial raids at night. The MiG-29s were used extensively to provide fighter escort to the Mirage 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Ganguly|Kapur|2008|p=105|Ref=Ganguly}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mirages successfully targeted enemy camps and logistic bases in Kargil and within days, their supply lines were severely disrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2003|p=97|Ref=OJones}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mirage 2000s were used for strikes on Muntho Dhalo&lt;ref name= Bharat-rakshak.com/&gt; and the heavily defended [[Tiger Hill, Kargil|Tiger Hill]] and paved the way for their early recapture.&lt;ref name= Bharat-rakshak.com/&gt; At the height of the conflict, the IAF was conducting over forty sorties daily over the Kargil region.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; By 26 July, the Indian forces had successfully liberated Kargil from Pakistani forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Kapur|2007|p=122|Ref=Kapur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the late 1990s, the Indian Air Force has been modernising its fleet to counter challenges in the new century. The fleet size of the IAF has decreased to 33 squadrons during this period because of the retirement of older aircraft. Still, India maintains the fourth largest air force in the world. The squadron strength is being raised to 42 squadrons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ibnlive.in.com/news/iaf-to-have-42-combat-aircraft-squadrons/173078-3.html IAF to have 42 combat aircraft squadrons]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Chief of the Air Staff (India)|Chief of the Air Staff]] with the rank of [[Air Chief Marshal]] is the Commander of the Indian Air Force. He is assisted by six officers: a [[Vice Chief of the Air Staff (India)|Vice Chief of the Air Staff]], a [[Deputy Chief of the Air Staff]], the [[Air Officer in Charge of Administration]], the Air Officer in Charge of Personnel, the Air Officer in Charge of Maintenance, and the [[Inspector General of Flight Safety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Branches at Air HQ &amp; PSOs | url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=20 | work=| publisher=Indian Air Force | date= | accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2002, the [[Government of India|government]] conferred the rank of [[Marshal of the Air Force]] on Arjan Singh making him the first and only ''[[five-star rank|Five-star]]'' officer with the Indian Air Force and ceremonial chief of the air force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Marshal of the Indian Air Force | url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=14 | work=| publisher=Indian Air Force | date= | accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commands and structure===
The Indian Air Force is divided into five operational and two functional [[Command (military formation)|commands]]. Each Command is headed by an Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief with the rank of Air Marshal. The purpose of an operational command is to conduct military operations using aircraft within its area of responsibility, whereas the responsibility of functional commands is to maintain [[combat readiness]]. Aside from the Training Command at Bangalore, the centre for primary flight training is located at the Air Force Academy in Hyderabad, Andhra Pradesh, followed by operational training at various other schools. Advanced officer training for command positions is also conducted at the Defence Services Staff College; specialised advanced flight training schools are located at Bidar, Karnataka, and Hakimpet, Andhra Pradesh (also the location for helicopter training). Technical schools are found at a number of other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Indian Air Force|url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/airforce.htm | work=| publisher=GlobalSecurity.org | date= | accessdate=29 Jun. 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It operates sixteen air bases from [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to [[Uttar Pradesh]]. Eastern Air Command operates fifteen Air bases in Eastern and North-eastern India. Central Air Command operates seven Air Bases in [[Madhya Pradesh]] and surrounding states of central India. Southern Air Command, a strategically important Air command, in line with India's latest doctrine of protecting the vital shipping routes. It operates nine Air bases in [[Southern India]] and two in the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]]. South Western Air Command is the front line of defence against Pakistan, this important Command operates twelve air bases in  [[Gujarat]], [[Maharashtra]] and [[Rajasthan]]. India also operates the [[Farkhor Air Base]] in [[Tajikistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/HH12Df01.html |title=Asia Times Online :: South Asia news - India's foray into Central Asia|accessdate=9 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wings===
A [[Wing (air force unit)|Wing]] is a formation intermediate between a Command and a Squadron. It generally consists of two or three IAF Squadrons and Helicopter Units, along with Forward Base Support Units (FBSU).  FBSUs do not have or host any Squadrons or Helicopter units but act as transit airbases for routine operations. In times of war, they can become fully fledged air bases playing host to various Squadrons. In all, about 47 Wings and 19 FBSUs make up the IAF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Air Force Wings, FBSUs and CMUs | url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Units/Bases/282-Wings.html | work=| publisher=Bharat Rakshak | date= | accessdate=10 Jul. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Air Force FBSUs and CMUs | url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/IAF/Units/Bases/284-FBSUs.html | work=| publisher=Bharat Rakshak | date= | accessdate=10 Jul. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Squadrons===
[[Squadron (aviation)|Squadrons]] are the field units and formations attached to static locations. Thus, a Flying Squadron is a sub-unit of an air force station which carries out the primary task of the IAF. All fighter squadrons are headed by a [[Commanding Officer]] with the rank of Wing Commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rawindia.com/?p=53 |title=Indian Air Force |date=10 August 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Transport squadrons and Helicopter Units are headed by a Commanding Officer with the rank of [[Group Captain]].

Within this formation structure, IAF has several service branches for day-to-day operations. They are:&lt;ref name=&quot;Career IAF&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Indian Air Force: Career Opportunities | url=http://www.careerairforce.nic.in/career_opp/caropp_officer_varientry.html | work=| publisher=Indian Air Force | date= | accessdate=21 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garud Commando Force===
{{Main|Garud Commando Force}}
In September 2004, the IAF established its own [[Special Forces of India|special operation]] unit called the [[Garud Commando Force]], consisting of approximately 1500 personnel. The unit derives its name from ''[[Garuda]]'', a divine bird-like creature of [[Hindu]] [[Mythology]], but more commonly the word for [[eagle]] in [[Sanskrit]]. Garud is tasked with the protection of critical installations; search and rescue during peace and hostilities and disaster relief during calamities.&lt;ref name=&quot;PIB 7 September&quot;&gt;{{cite press release | title = Constitution of Commando Force | publisher=Press Information Bureau, [[Government of India]] | date = 18 December 2003 | url = http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=262 | accessdate = 25 Jul. 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Integrated Space Cell===
{{Main|Integrated Space Cell}}
An Integrated Space Cell, which will be jointly operated by all the three services of the Indian armed forces, the civilian Department of Space and the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) has been set up to utilize more effectively the country's space-based assets for military purposes and to look into threats to these assets.&lt;ref name=&quot;India in aerospace defence plan&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SpaceDaily&quot;/&gt; This command will leverage space technology including satellites. Unlike an aerospace command, where the air force controls most of its activities, the Integrated Space Cell envisages cooperation and coordination between the three services as well as civilian agencies dealing with space.&lt;ref name=iss&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/JF18Df01.html |title=India goes to war in space |date=18 June 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

India currently has 11 remote sensing satellites in orbit. Though most are not meant to be dedicated military satellites, some have a spacial resolution of 1 metre or below which can be also used for military applications.

===Airmen===
[[File:Indian Air Force-GoH.jpeg|thumb|A Squadron Leader leading the IAF Airmen during a [[Honor guard|guard of honour]] ceremony to Lula da Silva at the [[Rashtrapati Bhavan]].]]
The duty of an airman in the Indian Air Force is to make sure that all the air and ground operations run smoothly. From operating Air Defence systems to fitting missiles, they are involved in all activities of an air base and give support to various technical and non-technical jobs.&lt;ref name=&quot;airmen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Central Airmen Selection Board|url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=135 | work=| publisher=Indian Air Force | date= | accessdate=22 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recruitment of personnel below officer rank is conducted through All India Selection Tests and Recruitment Rallies. All India Selection Tests are conducted among 14 Airmen Selection Centres (ASCs) located all over India. These centres are under the direct functional control of Central Airmen Selection Board (CASB), with administrative control and support by respective commands. The role of CASB is to carry out selection and enrolment of airmen from the Airmen Selection Centres for their respective commands.&lt;ref name=&quot;airmen&quot;/&gt; Candidates initially take a written test at the time of application. Those passing the written test undergo a physical fitness test, an interview conducted in English, and medical examination. Candidates for training are selected from individuals passing the battery of tests, on the basis of their performance. Upon completion of training, an individual becomes an Airman.&lt;ref name=&quot;airmen&quot;/&gt; Some MWOs and WOs are granted honorary commission in the last year of their service as an honorary Flying Officer or [[Flight Lieutenant]] before retiring from the service.&lt;ref name=&quot;airmen&quot;/&gt;

{{Indian Air Force enlisted Ranks}}

===Non Combatants Enrolled and civilians===
Non Combatants Enrolled (NCs(E)) were established in British India as personal assistants to the officer class, and are equivalent to the ''orderly'' or ''sahayak'' of the Indian Army.&lt;ref name=sam&gt;{{cite web | title=Air HQ Communication Squadron | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/sqn-air-hq-comm.htm | work=| publisher=Global Security | date= | accessdate=8 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all the commands have some percentage of civilian strength which are central government employees. These are regular ranks which are prevalent in ministries. They are usually not posted outside their stations and are employed in administrative and non-technical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Non Combatant(Enrolled) - Pension Chart| url=http://pcdapension.nic.in/govtOrders/Tables/table66.htm | work=| publisher=Principal Controller of Defence Accounts | date= | accessdate=6 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=AFRO Career Planning | url=http://indianairforce.nic.in/show_page.php?pg_id=147 | work=| publisher=Indian Air Force | date= | accessdate=6 Jul 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training and education===

The Indian Air Force has aircraft and equipment of Russian (erstwhile Soviet Union), British, French, Israeli, U.S. and Indian origins with Russian aircraft dominating its inventory. HAL produces some of the Russian and British aircraft in India under licence. The exact number of aircraft in  service with the Indian Air Force cannot be determined with precision from open sources. Various reliable sources provide notably divergent estimates for a variety of high-visibility aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Air Force Equipment | url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/air-force-equipment-intro.htm | work=| publisher=Global Security.org | date= | accessdate=22 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fighter and multi-role combat aircraft===
[[File:SU-30MKI-g4sp - edit 2(clipped).jpg|thumb|Sukhoi Su-30 MKI]]
The fighter aircraft in the IAF inventory are the primary means to achieve and maintain [[air supremacy]] over the battle field. These aircraft are designed for [[Aerial warfare|air-to-air combat]] in order to achieve their goals.

The [[Su-30MKI|Sukhoi Su-30MKI]] is the IAF's primary [[air superiority fighter]] with the capability to conduct strike missions. The IAF have placed an order for a total of 272 Su-30MKIs&lt;!--including replacements for attrition losses--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Rs-15000-crore-Sukhoi-deal-cleared/articleshow/6092315.cms|title={{Indian Rupee}} 15,000 crore Sukhoi deal cleared|publisher=The Times of India|date=26 June 2010|accessdate=3 August 2010|first1=Josy|last1=Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which 178 are in service as of June 2011.&lt;!--144 have been inducted  and two have been lost in crashes--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/transportation/airlines-/-aviation/IAF-to-upgrade-SU-30-fighter-aircraft/articleshow/6127166.cms|title=IAF to upgrade SU-30 fighter aircraft|date=4 July 2010|accessdate=9 July 2010|quote=Fifty Sukhois initially came from Russia between 2002 and 2005.

===Strike, attack and close support aircraft===
[[File:IAF Jaguar.jpg|thumb|[[SEPECAT Jaguar]]]]
These are military aircraft designed to attack targets on the ground. They are often deployed as close air support for, and in proximity to, their own ground forces, requiring precision strikes from these aircraft.

The [[SEPECAT Jaguar]] known as ''Shamsher'' and the [[Mikoyan MiG-27]] known as ''Bahadur'' (Hindi for Valiant) serve as the IAF's primary ground attack force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Naik | first=V.P. | title=IAF aiming for Diverse Capabilities, says Vice Chief of Air Staff | url=http://www.indiastrategic.in/topstories178.htm | date=26 September 2008 | work=Air Marshal P V Naik's Keynote Address on Fighter Technology and Advance Systems | publisher=India Strategic | accessdate=2009-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAF currently operates 139 Jaguars&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiadefenceonline.com/1453/hal-to-tie-up-with-bae-systems-for-jaguar-upgrade/|title=HAL To Tie-Up With BAE Systems For Jaguar Upgrade|date=30 November 2009|accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over 100 MiG-27s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/MiG-27-crashes-into-field-1-killed/articleshow/6211452.cms|title=MiG-27 crashes into field, 1 killed|date=25 July 2010|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Airborne early warning aircraft===
[[File:Beriev A-50EI Mainstay2009.jpg|thumb|left|IAF [[Beriev A-50]]EI Mainstay [[AEW&amp;C]]]]
These aircraft are designed to detect and distinguish hostile aircraft. The system can be used to direct fighters and strike aircraft to their targets and warn them of hostile enemy aircraft in the area. 

The IAF currently operates the EL/M-2075 Phalcon AEW&amp;C. A total of 3 such systems are currently in service, with possible orders for 2 more.&lt;ref name=&quot;PHALCON&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/mlitary_news/20101104/161205321.html|title=Russia sends 3rd AWACS plane to India|date=4 November 2010|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tanker aircraft===
[[File:IL-78 Lajes.jpg|thumb|IAF Il-78MKI]]
These aircraft are used for aerial refueling which allows IAF aircraft to remain airborne for longer periods, hence enhancing their effective range. Aerial refueling also allows aircraft to take-off with greater payload (by carrying less fuel during take-off). The IAF currently operates 6 [[Ilyushin]] [[Il-78]]MKIs for aerial refueling roles.&lt;ref name=&quot;TOI&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Mukherjee |first= Amit |title=IAF to get 5th IL-78 refueller soon| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/IAF_to_get_5th_IL-78_refueller_soon/articleshow/msid-867031,curpg-2.cms| date=29 September 2004|work=The Times of India | accessdate=22 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;apa&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Kopp |first= Carlo |title=The PLA-AF's Aerial Refuelling Programs| url=http://www.ausairpower.net/APA-PLA-Tanker-Programs.html| publisher=Air Power Australia | accessdate=22 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Future of the Indian Air Force}}
The number of aircraft in the IAF has been decreasing from the late 1990s due to retirement of older aircraft and several crashes. To deal with the depletion of force levels, the IAF has started to modernize its fleet. This includes both upgrade of existing aircraft, equipment and infrastructure as well as induction of new aircraft and equipment, both indigenous and imported. As new aircraft enter service and numbers recover, the IAF plans to have a fleet of 42 squadrons.&lt;ref name=&quot;42 Squad&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=IAF fighter squadrons to rise to 42 by 2022: Antony| url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/IAF_fighter_squadrons_to_rise_to_42_by_2022_Antony/articleshow/4151093.cms | work= |publisher= The Times of India | date=18 February 2009 | accessdate=24 Apr. 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; IAF will induct 126-200 MRCAs, 150-200 LCAs and 214 FGFA/PAK-FAs.
