The '''spiedie''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|s|p|iË|d|i}}) is a dish local to [[Greater Binghamton]] in the [[Southern Tier]] of [[New York]] State, and somewhat more broadly known and enjoyed throughout [[Central New York]] state.
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geography.ccsu.edu/harmonj/atlas/spiedie.htm Atlas of Popular Culture in the Northeastern US - Spiedie&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Spiedie consists of cubes of chicken, pork, lamb, veal, venison or beef. The meat cubes are marinated overnight or longer (sometimes for as long as two weeks under a controlled environment) in a special marinade, then grilled on spits (if steel skewers are used, they are called &quot;spiedie rods&quot;) over a charcoal pit.

The traditional method involves serving freshly prepared cubes of lamb, chicken, or beef on soft Italian bread (almost always made by Felix Roma, Endicott and Dirienzo Brothers, Binghamton) [[skewer]] and all, and sometimes drizzled with fresh marinade. However, it is frequently common to find them served on a [[submarine sandwich|submarine]] roll, and chicken is now the meat of choice due to cost. The bread is used as an oven glove to grip the meat while the skewer is removed. Spiedie meat cubes can also be eaten straight off the skewer or can be served in salads, stir fries, and a number of other dishes. The marinade recipe varies, usually involving olive oil, vinegar, and a variety of Italian spices and fresh mint.

Spiedie has been celebrated at the Spiedie Fest and Balloon Rally in [[Binghamton, New York]], every August, since 1983. The annual event includes a spiedie cook-off in search of the best spiedie recipes.  The spiedie and the Spiedie Fest were featured on an episode of [[Food Network|The Food Network's]] &quot;[[Unwrapped]]&quot;.

Commercial marinades are available regionally and can be ordered from various internet websites for shipment throughout the world.
==Etymology==
The term &quot;spiedie&quot; comes from the Italian ''spiedo'' meaning spit or ''spiedini'' referring to cubes or balls of meat cooked on a skewer. 
The regional dish in [[Abruzzo]], Italy most closely resembling spiedie uses goat meat, lamb, chicken or beef on a skewer, and is known as ''spidducc'''. Another regional dish from [[Sicily]], ''zÃºzzu'', consists of a gelatinous sausage made from the cartilage of pork and beef meat that is usually served cut into cubes.

==History==
The original idea for spiedie was brought by [[Italian-American|Italian]] immigrants to Upstate New York in the early 1920s.  The specific origin of the spiedie is disputed. Traditionally the early Broome County spiedie was made only from spring lamb, but currently most commercial restaurants prepare spiedie using chicken or pork.  The &quot;chicken category&quot; was added to the Spiedie Fest cook-off in 1987, and quickly became the most popular meat choice. 

'''Origins (1939 - 1950)'''&lt;/br&gt;
Two men &amp;ndash; Agostino &quot;Augie&quot; Iacovelli and Peter Sharak &amp;ndash; are credited with the creation of the spiedie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whatscookingamerica.net/History/Sandwiches/Spiedie.htm | title=Spiedie Sandwich History | accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iacovelli, from [[Endicott, New York]], began serving spiedie sandwiches in 1939 when he opened Augie's, his first restaurant.  He emigrated from [[Abruzzo]], [[Italy]] (Civitella Casanova) at the age of 25 in 1923.  His son Guido continued in the spiedie business into the 1990s, owning as many as 26 restaurants at the peak of his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geography.ccsu.edu/harmonj/atlas/spiedie.htm | title=The Spiedie - a &quot;Tasty Morsel&quot; | accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iacovelli's marinade, which he called ''Zuzu'', originally was made simply from wine vinegar, water, lemon juice, garlic and mint.  Italian spices, olive oil and minced onion were added later as regional tastes and the choice of meat began to vary.&lt;ref name=&quot;atlas&quot;/&gt;

Sharak is also supposed to have invented spiedies. Apparently, patrons of Sharkeyâs Bar and Grill were served lamb straight from the grill on its metal skewer with slices of bread.  At the original Sharkey's on Glenwood Avenue the spiedies are preceded, accompanied and followed by copious quantities of beer.  Sharkey's promotes itself as the birthplace of the sandwich in television commercials across the greater Binghamton area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://eatinghistory.blogspot.com/2006/02/spiedies-of-binghamton-in-new-york-usa.html | title=The Spiedies of Binghamton in New York, USA | accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the issue is disputed, Sharkeyâs began serving spiedies in 1947, which makes Iacovelli more likely to have invented the dish first.{{Citation needed|reason=August 8, 2008|date=August 2008}}

'''Growth of Popularity (1950-1990)'''&lt;/br&gt;
Through the 1960s, and 1970s, spiedies also became popular with the families of deer hunters since venison has a strong game quality and is similar to lamb. Many local families made their own marinade and enjoyed the wild game as a delicacy of back yard grills.

In 1975, Rob Salamida became the first person to bottle the sauce and sell it. He began by cooking spiedies outside a local tavern at 16. After writing letters for over a year the [[New York State Fair]] allowed him to have his own booth at the Syracuse Fairgrounds. 

For 12 years he built his reputation at the fair. After a tornado nearly struck his stand in 1975, he decided it would be more lucrative and safer to bottle a spiedie marinade. Today, Salamida's Original State Fair Spiedie Sauce is the highest selling spiedie marinade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiedie.com/aboutus.mv | title=Spiedie.com | accessdate=May 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the 1980s Danny &quot;Moonbeam&quot; (a local flat-track dirt motorcycle racing star) furthered the popularity of spiedies by selling them from porches of local bars at night in order to finance his motorcycle racing hobby.  Lori Vesely featured spiedies straight off the grill at The Endwell Pub.  Pork was especially good for long-grilling time making the bar-spiedie a favorite of both staff and customers.

In 1983 a few families got together and held a spiediefest&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.spiediefest.com/history.aspx | title = spiediefest.com/history}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was a tremendous hit. Coupled with a Balloon Rally it quickly grew to an annual 100,000 person festival (and also one of the top balloon rallies in the country).

==Availability in the United States==
One of the restaurants most famous for spiedies today, Lupo's Char-Pit, was established in 1967 by John, Sam, and Bart Lupo in Endwell, New York. Spiedies became a primary component of their menu in the 1980s as they often win the cook-off competition at the annual Spiedie Fest.

There are many restaurants in the Southern Tier that specialize in spiedies: Brooks' House of Bar-B-Que, Lupo's Char Pit, Sharkey's Restaurant, Spiedie and Rib Pit, Lupo's S &amp; S Grill, and Poncho's Pit are some of the more well known. Spiedies are also featured by several vendors at the annual New York State Fair in Syracuse NY.

In Atlanta, Georgia, Dantanna's near Lenox Square Mall and The Spiedie Grill are listed.

While Shish Kabobs are often referenced when describing spiedies to those who've never had them, spiedies are not the same and attempts to list such products with the spiedie name is quickly rejected by those who know and love spiedies.

The Angry Dog (Deep Ellum - Dallas) also serves spiedies, specifically referring to them as 'Binghamton, NY - style Spiedies'
