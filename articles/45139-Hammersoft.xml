==Names==
The name ''chennai'' is a shortened form of ''Chennapattanam'' (à®à¯à®©à¯à®©à®ªà¯à®ªà®à¯à®à®£à®®à¯), the name of the town that grew around [[Fort St. George (India)|Fort St. George]], which was built by the [[Kingdom of England|English]] in 1640.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wagret|first=Paul|title=India, Nepal|publisher=Nagel Publishers|location=Geneva|year=1977|series=Nagel's encyclopedia-guide|page=556|isbn=978-2-8263-0023-6|oclc=4202160}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two versions about the origin of the name ''Chennai'': according to one version, ''Chennapattanam'' was named after [[Damarla Chennappa Nayakudu]], Nayaka of [[Srikalahasti|Kalahasthi]] and [[Vandavasi]], father of Damarla Venkatadri Nayakudu, from whom the English acquired the town in 1639. The first official use of the name ''Chennai'' is said to be in a sale deed, dated 8 August 1639, to [[Francis Day of Madras|Francis Day]] of the [[East India Company|English East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chennai.tn.nic.in/chndistprof.htm#hist |title=District Pofile â CHENNAI |publisher=Chennai.tn.nic.in |accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the second account, ''Chennapattanam'' was named after the Chenna Kesava Perumal Temple; the word ''chenni'' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] means ''face'', and the temple was regarded as the face of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2002/02/28/stories/2002022800030400.htm|title=The Hindu: Face behind the name |publisher=Hinduonnet.com |date=28 February 2002 |accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's former name, ''Madras'', is derived from ''Madraspattinam'', a fishing village north of Fort St. George. There is some argument among researchers about the exact origin of the name ''Madraspattinam''. It has been suggested that the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who arrived in the area in the 16th century, may have named the village ''Madre de Deus'', meaning the ''Mother of God''. Another possibility is that the village's name came from the prominent ''Madeiros'' family (variously known as ''Madera'' or ''Madra'' in succeeding years) of Portuguese origin, which consecrated the ''Madre de Deus'' Church in the [[Santhome]] locality of Chennai in 1575. It is uncertain whether the name 'Madraspattinam' was in use before European influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/yw/2007/08/31/stories/2007083150020100.htm|title=Young World: And the city grew |publisher=The Hindu |date=31 August 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime after the English gained possession of the area in the 17th century, the two towns, ''Madraspattinam'' and ''Chennapattinam'', were merged, and the English referred to the united town as ''Madraspattinam''. The state government officially [[Geographical renaming|changed]] the name to ''Chennai'' in 1996, at a time when [[Renaming of cities in India|many Indian cities were being renamed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/09/23/stories/2005092316520600.htm|title=Walkout in State Assembly|date=23 September 2005|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=5 September 2008}}

{{Main|History of Chennai}}
The region around Chennai has served as an important administrative, military, and economic centre since the 1st century. Stone age implements were found in a pit near Pallavaram in Chennai. According to the [[Archaeological Survey of India]], Pallavaram was a [[megalith]]ic cultural establishment.&lt;ref name=chendistprofhistory&gt;{{cite web

On 22 August 1639, Francis Day of the British East India Company bought a small strip of land on the [[Coromandel Coast]]. The region was ruled by Chennapa Nayak, the [[Nayak (title)|Nayaka]] of [[Vandavasi]].&lt;ref name=chendistprofhistory/&gt; He granted the British permission to build a factory and warehouse for their trading enterprises. A year later, the British built [[Fort St George]], which became the nucleus of the growing colonial city.

===Water===
Historically, Chennai has relied on annual [[monsoon]] rains to replenish water reservoirs, as no major rivers flow through the area. With a steadily increasing population, the city has faced [[water supply]] [[Water crisis|shortages]], and its ground water levels have been depleted. An earlier [[Veeranam|Veeranam Lake project]] failed to solve the city's water problems, but the New Veeranam project, which became operational in September 2004, has greatly reduced dependency on distant sources.&lt;ref name=ManagementWater2003-2004&gt;{{cite web
