The '''''ITV News at 1:30''''' is the weekday afternoon news programme on the British television network, [[ITV]]. It is produced by [[ITN]].

The programme is presented by a single newscaster; however in the event of a major story, another newscaster will be on location. [[Alastair Stewart]] is currently the main newscaster. The programme features twenty-two minutes of national and international news as well as a weather forecast, followed by six minutes of regional news from the ITV regions at 1:54 pm.

On paper, the ''ITV News at 1:30'' airs in its usual time slot and has its usual running time on Bank Holidays.  However, in practice it doesn't, as on working days the national news is scheduled to run from 1.29 pm to 1.51 pm, followed by a weather forecast, adverts and then a regional news from 1.54 pm to 2.01 pm, then straight in to the next programme.  On Bank Holidays it is scheduled to run from 1.32 pm to 1.45 pm  followed a weather forecast, adverts and then a regional news from 1.49 pm to 1.56 pm, then more adverts before the next programme.

==History==
The first ITN lunchtime bulletin was launched on 16 October 1972 - ''First Report'' aired at 12:40pm and was anchored by [[Robert Kee]]. In 1974 ''First Report'' was moved to 1pm. In 1976, [[Leonard Parkin]] and [[Peter Sissons]] began alternating as the programme's main newscasters, and ''First Report'' was renamed ''News at One''.

In 1987, the programme moved to 12:30pm (and thus renamed ''News at 12:30''), and [[Julia Somerville]] made a move from the BBC to become the main newscaster. [[Jon Snow]] also presented the programme at this time. The following year, a revamp in ITV's daytime schedules saw the bulletin moved back to 1pm and became ''News at One'' again. A more comprehensive relaunch, with a new set and graphics, came in 1989, at which time [[John Suchet]] took over as the main newscaster; in early 1991 the bulletin returned to the 12:3pm slot and became ''News at 12:30'' again.

In 1992 the programme was renamed the ''Lunchtime News''; double-headed presentation was also adopted with [[Nicholas Owen (journalist)|Nicholas Owen]] and [[Carol Barnes]] becoming the bulletin's main newscasters. In 1995, all ITN news bulletins were revamped using a cohesive blue look, and a further change was made when [[Dermot Murnaghan]] and the returning Julia Somerville became the main newscasters.

On 8 March 1999, all of ITV's news output was relaunched again, and the bulletin was retitled the ''ITV Lunchtime News'', with John Suchet returning alongside Somerville. On 23 June 2003, the programme reverted to single presentation with Nicholas Owen as the main newscaster.&lt;ref&gt;http://tvnews.thetvroomplus.com/news-204.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, dual presentation returned on 2 February 2004, when ITV News received another relaunch, and Owen was joined by [[Katie Derham]]. In early 2007, Owen left for the BBC, and [[Alastair Stewart]] took his place.

On 27 July 2009, the bulletin returned to single presentation once again for continuity and presentation reasons, with Katie Derham and Alastair Stewart taking turns to present. Derham left ITV News in June 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
