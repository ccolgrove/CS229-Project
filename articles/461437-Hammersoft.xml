Eccleston completed a two-year Performance Foundation Course at [[University of Salford#History|Salford Tech]],&lt;ref name=&quot;BC041096&quot;&gt;Jackson, Nick, [http://archive.blackburncitizen.co.uk/1996/10/4/843577.html &quot;Little Hulton's reluctant film star&quot;] ''BlackburnCitizen.co.uk'', 4 October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; before going on to train at the [[Hampstead]]-based [[Central School of Speech and Drama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cssd.ac.uk/pages/famous_alumni.html &quot;Some of Our Famous Alumniâ¦&quot;] ''CSSD.ac.uk''&lt;/ref&gt; As an actor, his early influences had been [[Ken Loach]]'s ''&quot;[[Kes (film)|Kes]]&quot;'' and [[Albert Finney]]'s performance in ''[[Saturday Night and Sunday Morning (film)|Saturday Night and Sunday Morning]]'', but he soon found himself performing the classics, including the works of [[Shakespeare]], [[Anton Chekhov|Chekhov]] and [[MoliÃ¨re]]. At the age of 25, Eccleston made his professional stage debut in the [[Bristol Old Vic]]'s production of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]''. Underemployed as an actor for some years after graduating school, Eccleston took a variety of odd jobs at a supermarket, on building sites and as an artist's model.

==Career==
===1991â2005===
Eccleston first came to public attention as [[Derek Bentley]] in the 1991 film ''[[Let Him Have It]]'' and an episode of [[Inspector Morse (TV series)|Inspector Morse]], &quot;Second Time Around&quot;, also in 1991.  However, it was a regular role in the television series ''[[Cracker (British television)|Cracker]]'' (1993&amp;ndash;94) that made him a recognisable figure in the UK, and after informing TV bosses of his desire to leave the series, his character was killed off in October 1994 as one the victims of serial killer Albie Kinsella ([[Robert Carlyle]]), when the killer stabbed him to death after provoking him by molesting his wife in a supermarket.

At around the same time he appeared in Agatha Christie's ''[[Agatha Christie's Poirot|Poirot]]'', in the episode &quot;One, Two, Buckle My Shoe&quot;.

He appeared in the low-budget [[Danny Boyle]] 1994 film ''[[Shallow Grave]]'', in which he co-starred with up-and-coming actor [[Ewan McGregor]]. The same year, he won the part of Nicky Hutchinson in the epic [[BBC]] drama serial ''[[Our Friends in the North]]'', whose broadcast on [[BBC Two]] in 1996 helped make him a household name in the UK. Eccleston starred in an ensemble cast that included acclaimed actors [[Mark Strong]] and [[Gina McKee]] as well as [[Daniel Craig]].

His film career has since taken off with a variety of high-profile but not &amp;mdash; except in one or two cases &amp;mdash; major roles, including the title role in ''[[Jude (film)|Jude]]'' (1996), ''[[Elizabeth (film)|Elizabeth]]'' (1998), ''[[eXistenZ]]'' (1999), ''[[Gone in 60 Seconds (2000 film)|Gone in 60 Seconds]]'' (2000), ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'' (2001), ''[[24 Hour Party People]]'' (2002) and another Danny Boyle film, the horror movie ''28 Days Later'' (2002). He played a major role as the protagonist of [[Alex Cox]]'s 2002 ''[[Revengers Tragedy]]'', adapted from [[Thomas Middleton]]'s [[The Revenger's Tragedy|play]] of the same name.&lt;ref name=&quot;T030203&quot;&gt;Dalton, Stephen, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/article862399.ece &quot;A one-man awkward squad&quot;] ''Timesonline.co.uk'', 3 February 2003&lt;/ref&gt; He has starred alongside two major Hollywood actresses in smaller independent films, appearing opposite [[RenÃ©e Zellweger]] in ''[[A Price Above Rubies]]'' (1998) and [[Cameron Diaz]] in ''[[The Invisible Circus (film)|The Invisible Circus]]'' (2001). Despite starring in the car-heist movie ''Gone in 60 Seconds'', he did not actually take his driving test until January 2004, and revealed on BBC's ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' that his licence restricts him to vehicles with [[automatic transmission]].

He has appeared in a variety of television roles, racking up credits in British television dramas of recent years. These have included ''Hearts and Minds'' (1995) for Channel 4, ''[[Clocking Off]]'' (2000) and ''Flesh and Blood'' (2002) for the BBC and ''[[Hillsborough disaster#&quot;Hillsborough&quot; television drama|Hillsborough]]'' (1996), a modern version of ''[[Othello#Movie and Opera versions|Othello]]'' (2002), playing 'Ben Jago', (the [[Iago]] character) and the religious telefantasy epic ''[[The Second Coming (TV)|The Second Coming]]'' (2003) for [[ITV]], in which he played Steve Baxter, the son of God. He also finds time for the occasional light-hearted role, however, as his guest appearances in episodes of the comedy drama ''[[Linda Green]]'' (2001) and macabre sketch show ''[[The League of Gentlemen]]'' (2002) have shown. Eccleston's most high-profile stage role has been ''[[Hamlet]]'' in the 2002 production at his favourite theatre, [[Leeds]]' [[West Yorkshire Playhouse]]. MarchâApril 2004 saw him return to the venue in a new play, ''Electricity''.

Eccleston has been twice nominated in the Best Actor category at the [[British Academy Television Awards]], the UK's premier television awards ceremony. His first nomination came in 1997 for ''[[Our Friends in the North]]'', when he lost out to [[Nigel Hawthorne]] (for ''The Fragile Heart''), and he was nominated again in 2004 for ''[[The Second Coming (TV)|The Second Coming]]'', this time being beaten by [[Bill Nighy]] (for ''[[State of Play (TV serial)|State of Play]]''). He did, however, triumph in the Best Actor categories at the 1997 [[Broadcasting Press Guild]] Awards and the [[Royal Television Society]] Awards, winning for ''Our Friends in the North''. He won the RTS Best Actor award for a second time in 2003, this time for his performance in ''Flesh and Blood''.

In July 2004, a poll of industry experts, conducted by ''[[Radio Times]]'' magazine, voted Eccleston the 19th Most Powerful Person in Television Drama.

===''Doctor Who'' (2005)===
On 20 March 2004, it was announced that Eccleston was to play the ninth incarnation of [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] in the revival of the legendary BBC [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''Doctor Who'', which began transmission on 26 March 2005. Eccleston was the first actor to play the role who was born after the series began, albeit by less than three months.

On 30 March 2005, the BBC released a statement, ostensibly from Eccleston, saying that he had decided to leave the role after just one series, because he feared becoming [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]]. On 4 April, the BBC revealed that Eccleston's &quot;statement&quot; was falsely attributed and released without his consent. The BBC admitted that they had broken an agreement made in January not to disclose publicly that he only intended to do one series. The statement had been made after journalists made queries to the press office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC admits Dr Who actor blunder | work = BBC News | publisher = BBC | date = 4 April 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/4410943.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11 June 2005, during a [[BBC radio]] interview, when asked if he had enjoyed working on ''Doctor Who'', Eccleston responded by saying, &quot;Mixed, but that's a long story.&quot;  Eccleston's reasons for leaving the role continue to be debated in Britain's newspapers: on 4 October 2005 [[Alan Davies]] told ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that Eccleston had been &quot;overworked&quot; by the BBC, and had left the role because he was &quot;exhausted&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Leonard | first = Tom | title = Hamlet?

On 7 November 2008, at the [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] to promote his book [[Russell_T_Davies#The_Writer.27s_Tale|''The Writer's Tale'']], [[Russell T Davies]] said that Eccleston's contract was for a single year because it was uncertain whether the show would continue beyond a single revival series.  In retrospect, he says, it has been an enormous success, but at the time there were doubts within the BBC.  &lt;!-- not sure how I should cite it; he said roughly this in front of a nearly full house in the Lyttleton theatre on 7 Nov 2008 as part of the NT's series of 'platforms'. --&gt;

Eccleston was voted &quot;Most Popular Actor&quot; at the 2005 [[National Television Awards]] for his portrayal of the Doctor.

===Recent works (2005 onwards)===
On 30 October 2005, Eccleston appeared on stage at the Old Vic theatre and Doctor Who in London in the one-night play ''[[Night Sky (play)|Night Sky]]'' alongside [[Navin Chowdhry]], [[Bruno Langley]], [[David Warner (actor)|David Warner]], [[Saffron Burrows]] and [[David Baddiel]]. Eccleston sat on the 2nd Amazonas International Film Festival Film Jury in November 2005. The director [[Norman Jewison]] was chairman of the Jury.&lt;ref name=&quot;MO 021105&quot;&gt;Bourne, Dianne, [http://www.manchesteronline.co.uk/entertainment/filmandtv/tv/s/180/180223_eccleston_lends_a_hand.html Eccleston lends a hand] ''ManchesterOnline.co.uk'', 2 November 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, Eccleston traveled to [[Indonesia]]'s [[Aceh]] province for the [[Breakfast (television programme)|BBC Breakfast]] news programme, examining how survivors of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|2004 Boxing Day tsunami]] were rebuilding their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Christopher's Tsunami journey | work = BBC News | publisher = BBC | date = 14 December 2005 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/breakfast/4524226.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Eccleston appeared in the [[ITV]] documentary special, ''[[wikiasite:muppet:Best Ever Muppet Moments|Best Ever Muppet Moments]]'' as a commentator. In May 2006, he appeared as the narrator in a production of ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'' at The Lowry theatre in his home city of Salford. The theatre company with which he performed, Celebrity Pig (of which he is patron), is made up of [[learning disability|learning disabled]] actors.

In August 2006, Eccleston filmed ''New Orleans, Mon Amour'' with [[Elisabeth Moss]]. The film was directed by [[Michael Almereyda]] and shot in post-[[Hurricane Katrina]] [[New Orleans]]. It was released in 2008 to film festivals in the US and Italy. Late in 2006 he starred in ''Perfect Parents'', an [[ITV]] drama written and directed by [[Joe Ahearne]], who had directed him in ''Doctor Who''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Thomas | first = Liz | title = Eccleston swaps time for crime in first post-Doctor drama | work = The Stage | publisher = The Stage Newspaper Limited | date = 7 April 2006 | url = http://www.thestage.co.uk/news/newsstory.php/12208/eccleston-swaps-time-for-crime-in-first}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eccleston joined the cast of the [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' in the episode &quot;[[Godsend (Heroes)|Godsend]]&quot;, which was broadcast on 22 January 2007. Eccleston played a character named [[Claude (Heroes)|Claude]] who has the power of [[invisibility]], and helps [[Peter Petrelli]] with his powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Ausiello | first = Michael | title = Ask Ausiello | publisher = TV Guide Magazine | date = 15 November 2006 | url = http://www.tvguide.com/News-Views/Columnists/Ask-Ausiello/default.aspx?columndate=15 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eccleston appeared as [[The Seeker: The Dark Is Rising|The Rider]] in a [[The Seeker (film)|film adaptation]] of [[Susan Cooper]]'s novel ''[[The Dark Is Rising Sequence|The Dark Is Rising]]'', which opened in the U.S. on 5 October 2007.

Eccleston appeared on the BBC Four World Cinema Award show in February 2008, arguing the merits of five international hits such as ''[[The Lives of Others]]'' and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth]]'' with [[Jonathan Ross]] and [[Archie Panjabi]]. In 2009 Eccleston starred opposite [[Archie Panjabi]] in a short film [http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1385540/ The Happiness Salesman]. Eccleston agreed to do the film because of Ms Panjabi and the fact that it was a winner of the prestigious [[British Short Screenplay Competition (BSSC)]]. He also appeared as the villainous [[Destro]] in the live-action [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero|G.I. Joe]] film: ''[[G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =

Eccleston also appeared in an episode of ''[[The Sarah Silverman Program]]'' as the titular cult favourite science fiction hero in a show-within-the-show called &quot;Dr. Laser Rage&quot;, possibly in reference to his stint as The Doctor in ''Doctor Who''.

In November 2009, Eccleston was reported to have been cast as [[John Lennon]] in a [[BBC]] production called ''[[Lennon Naked]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
