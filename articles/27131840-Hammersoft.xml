Madlib Medicine Show  #1 contains original tracks as well as &quot;OJ Simpson remixes&quot; of tracks from [[Guilty Simpson]]'s debut album ''[[Ode to the Ghetto]]''. It is considered a prelude to Madlib and Guilty's collaboration album [[O.J. Simpson (album)|O.J. Simpson]] released in May 2010. There are two brief guest appearances; one by [[J Dilla]], in a short, previously unreleased interlude dating back to his &amp; Madlib's first collaboration and the other by [[Push Comes to Shove (M.E.D. album)|M.E.D.]], who is the sole voice on the short &quot;The Exclusive&quot;, a theme song that first appeared on [[Jaylib]]'s ''[[Champion Sound]]'' album where [[Percee P]] did &quot;The Exclusive&quot; interlude.

As of May 2011, this album's vinyl edition is back in print after the initial 1000 copies sold out at release.

Madlib Medicine Show #5 is a collection of previously unreleased Madlib production dating back to 1990 and stretches to 2000. Before he called himself The Beat Konducta, there was The Loop Digga, who made beats with his sampler in the basement known as ''Crate Digga's Palace''. Beats were pulled from old beat tapes and floppy discs. The majority of the album is instrumental, but a few selections feature him rapping together with his Oxnard crew ''C.D.P.'', which also included his brother [[Oh No]]. A limited triple vinyl set was released featuring a bonus disc of 10 additional tracks from the same period.

&quot;Madlib Medicine Show No. 10 reminds us of the mastery Madlib has performed throughout his heralded body of work, sourcing inspiration by the likes of Don Blackman, ZZ Hill or the Sylvers and blowing you away with the original work that stems from it. With Black Soul, he's digging deep to give you a mix of 60s and 70s soul, disco and funk unlike you've ever heard.&quot;
