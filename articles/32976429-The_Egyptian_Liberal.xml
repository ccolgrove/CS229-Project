'''Ali Jawad al-Sheikh''' ({{lang-ar|Ø¹ÙÙ Ø¬ÙØ§Ø¯ Ø§ÙØ´ÙØ®}}) was a 14-year-old Bahraini who died in hospital on 31 August 2011 after reportedly being hit in the head by a [[tear gas canister]] shot by Bahraini security forces during the [[2011 Bahraini uprising]]. The Bahraini government denied security force involvement in his death and offered a reward for information on the incident. Activists, however, began a series of large protests after his funeral.

==Background==
{{See|2011 Bahraini uprising}}
As part of a string of [[Arab Spring|protests]] that occurred across the Arab World following the self-immolation and eventual death of [[Mohammed Bouazizi]] in [[2010-2011 Tunisian protests|Tunisia]], the mostly [[Shia]] population of Bahrain took to the streets demanding greater freedoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;JazeeraBah14Feb&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=[[Staff writer]] | title = Bahrain Activists in 'Day of Rage'&amp;nbsp;â Anti-Government Protests in Shia Villages Around the Capital Leave Several People Injured and One Person Reported Dead | date=14 February 2011 | publisher=[[Al-Jazeera English]] | url = http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011214925802473.html | accessdate=20 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move was seen as potentially destabilising to the [[Sunni]]-led regime of Bahrain, following which a brutal government crackdown led to widespread suppressions of the Shia people across many sectors,&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Cockburn|Cockburn, Patrick]] (18 March 2011).

==Death==
[[File:Ali Jawad al-Sheikh dead.jpg|thumb|upright|Ali Jawad al-Sheikh's corpse.]]
A number of protesters, including Isa Hassan, Ali's uncle, took part in a demonstration in [[Sitra]], [[Bahrain]] on 31 August just after [[Fajr|morning prayers]]. They stated that they were &quot;confronted by the police, who fired tear gas at them from roughly 20 feet away&quot; and causing Ali Jawad al-Sheikh's death. In an interview with the ''[[Associated Press]]'', Isa explained that &quot;they are supposed to lob the canisters of gas, not shoot them at people. Police used it as a weapon.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;AJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahraini boy killed in protest |author= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/08/2011831132740548678.html?utm_content=automateplus&amp;utm_campaign=Trial5&amp;utm_source=SocialFlow&amp;utm_term=tweets&amp;utm_medium=MasterAccount |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=August 31, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=A 14-Year-Old Boy Is Killed in Bahrain as Security Forces Break Up a Protest |author=J.

After his death, Ali's body was removed from the hospital and moved to the morgue, where an [[autopsy]] was carried out.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt; In the afternoon, Osama al-Asfoor, the [[Director of Public Prosecutions|head of public prosecution]], stated that the autopsy had shown that &quot;Ali had died of injuries to the back of his neck&quot; and that &quot;the boy had injuries under his chin and bruises on his face, hand, knees and pelvic area.&quot; However, he also added that a &quot;blood examination showed no effects of tear gas exposure.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Ali Jawad al-Sheikh by Ahmad Nady.jpg|thumb|upright|Political cartoon of Ali Jawad al-Sheikh by [[Ahmad Nady]].]]
Photographs of Ali directly after being injured were released by the [[Human_rights_in_Bahrain#Human_Rights_Groups|Bahrain Youth Society for Human Rights]]. Mohammed al-Maskati, the leader of the Society, said that, &quot;The picture is affecting people.&quot; A videotape had also been made of Ali's family around his body in the hospital. [[Nabeel Rajab]], the president of the [[Bahrain Center for Human Rights]], explained that the video was a &quot;a gift to the people&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; The father of Ali, Jawad al-Sheikh, asked in an interview with [[CNN]] for &quot;human rights groups to take steps against Bahrain's leaders, saying, 'I lost my child. ... He does not deserve this destiny.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Police, protesters battle in Bahrain's streets after boy's death |author= |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/08/31/bahrain.death/ |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=August 31, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government acknowledged Ali's death, but stated in a report from the state-run news agency that &quot;no reported police action against lawbreakers in Sitra&quot; had occurred the morning of that day and that the security forces had last been involved in &quot;dispersing a small group of around 10 people at 1:15 a.m.&quot; that day. The [[Ministry of the Interior (Bahrain)|Ministry of the Interior]] then also set out a &quot;reward of more than $26,000 for information about those responsible for his death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt;

Activists who had taken part in the uprising stated that police had surrounded the hospital where Ali had died, effectively preventing any gatherings of people in the area. The activists also stated their intention to have a protest on 1 September 2011, after attending Ali's funeral earlier that day.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT&quot;/&gt; Clashes with police, however, began on 31 August and continued into the morning of September 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;/&gt;

===Funeral and protests===
The [[funeral procession]] was held early on 1 September, with photographs of Ali both before he died and of his dead body covering the coffin. It had already been delayed for some hours, as Ali's father was unwilling to sign the death certificate for release of his son's body, since the cause of death listed was stated to be &quot;unknown.&quot; It is uncertain if the certificate was ever signed or if the body was just released.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Large Protest in Bahrain After Boyâs Death |author=J. David Goodman |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/02/world/middleeast/02bahrain.html |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=September 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activists stated that thousands of people attended his funeral. Afterwards, the mourners began marching in the streets of Sitra carrying pictures of Ali and chanting 'Down, down, [[Hamad ibn Isa Al Khalifa|Hamad]]!'&quot;. No security personnel were present at the protest and the protesters had dispersed by the afternoon. However, extensive protests were held in the national capital of [[Manama]] that night as the protesters tried to take back control of the [[Pearl Roundabout]], which was the site of protests earlier in the year until a government crackdown and the destruction of the monument. Government forces used tear gas and blocked roads with buses to stop the protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT2&quot;/&gt;

==Local reactions==
[[Isa Qassim|Sheik Isa Qassim]], a senior Shiite cleric, has blamed security forces for the death of Ali Jawad, saying, &quot;the killing of a 14-year-old boy by security forces during an anti-government demonstration Wednesday shows that the island nationâs Sunni rulers are not listening to peopleâs demands for greater rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Bahrain cleric blames police for protester's death |author=Brian Murphy |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2011-09-01/world/30104623_1_bahrain-s-shiite-sitra-senior-shiite-cleric |newspaper=[[Associated Press]] |date=September 1, 2011 |accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
