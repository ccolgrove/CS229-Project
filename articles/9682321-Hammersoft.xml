{{Politics of Philippines}}
A '''senatorial election''' was held on November 12, 1963 in the [[Philippines]]. The 1963 elections were known as a midterm election as the date when the elected officials take office falls half-way through [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Diosdado Macapagal]]'s four-year term.

The [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] finally wins control of the House after having ten seats out of the 24-member [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]], with the 2-member Grand Alliance (the old [[Progressive Party (Philippines)|Progressive Party]]) caucusing with them. [[Ferdinand Marcos]] was later elected [[President of the Senate of the Philippines|Senate President]] a few months after the Senate convened.
