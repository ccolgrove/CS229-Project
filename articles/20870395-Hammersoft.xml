The '''2009 Minnesota Vikings season''' was the [[Minnesota Vikings|franchise]]'s 49th season in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. The Vikings improved upon their 10â6 record and defended their NFC North title from [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008]]; it was the first time that they had retained a divisional title since they won six [[NFC Central]] titles in a row between [[1973 Minnesota Vikings season|1973]] and [[1978 Minnesota Vikings season|1978]]. They beat the [[Dallas Cowboys]] in the NFC Divisional Playoff, but lost the NFC Championship Game in overtime to the [[New Orleans Saints]], missing out on what would have been their first Super Bowl since [[Super Bowl XI|1976]].

It was their fourth season under the direction of head coach [[Brad Childress]], and they played their home games at [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Mall of America Field at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]]. The Vikings had ten Pro Bowlers and four All-Pros on their roster, both league-highs for the season.

In 2008, they received an extra 2009 seventh-round selection from the [[Washington Redskins]] for defensive end [[Erasmus James]], but they used that extra pick to move from spot #158 to #150 in the fifth round.

The Vikings' top two selections, WR [[Percy Harvin]] and OT [[Phil Loadholt]], both soon became 1st string players, while [[Jasper Brinkley]] finished the season as the team's starting MLB after [[E.J. Henderson]] suffered a broken leg in a Week 13 game against the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Harvin was also voted the Offensive Rookie of the Year and was named as the NFC's starting kick returner for the [[2010 Pro Bowl]] on January 31, 2010.

[[File:2009VikingsPackers.JPG|thumb|Minnesota Vikings versus Green Bay Packers in Week 4 of the 2009 NFL season.]]

Coming off their last-second win over the 49ers, the Vikings stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and prepared for the highly anticipated Week 4 NFC North Monday Night Football duel with the [[Green Bay Packers]]. This was a key divisional match-up, as the division lead was on the line, while quarterback [[Brett Favre]] was pitted against his former team. Favre entered the stadium to a series of boos coming from Green Bay fans throughout the stadium, but were drowned out by the cheers from Vikings fans.

Minnesota started off the first quarter with Favre completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]]. The Packers responded with quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] completing a 62-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Jermichael Finley]]. In the second quarter, the Vikings struck again with a 14-yard touchdown pass from Favre to wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]], but Green Bay answered with linebacker [[Clay Matthews III|Clay Matthews]] stripping running back [[Adrian Peterson]] of the ball and returning it 42 yards for a touchdown. The Vikings closed out the half with a 1-yard touchdown run from Peterson.

Minnesota began to build a lead in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with wide receiver [[Bernard Berrian]] on a 31-yard touchdown pass. In the fourth quarter, the Vikings solidified their lead as defensive end [[Jared Allen]] sacked Rodgers in the Green Bay endzone for a safety. The Packers rallied with a 33-yard touchdown pass from Rodgers to wide receiver [[Jordy Nelson]] (with a failed 2-point conversion), followed by kicker [[Mason Crosby]] nailing a 31-yard field goal. However, the Packers' push came too late and Minnesota was able to run out the clock for the win.

With the victory, not only did the Vikings improve to 4â0, but Favre became the first quarterback in NFL history to defeat all 32 NFL teams.

Allen had a spectacular single-game performance with a career-best 4.5 sacks. Favre was awarded the NFC Offensive Player of the Week, marking the 14th time in his career he has earned this award.

Coming off their easy road win over the Rams, the Vikings went home for a Week 6 inter-conference duel with the [[Baltimore Ravens]]. Minnesota got off to a fast start in the first quarter with quarterback [[Brett Favre]] completing a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Bernard Berrian]]. Afterwards, the Ravens got the only points of the second quarter as kicker [[Steven Hauschka]] getting a 29-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Vikings picked up where they left off with a 40-yard field goal from kicker [[Ryan Longwell]]. Baltimore responded with a 22-yard touchdown run from running back [[Ray Rice]], yet Longwell helped out Minnesota by nailing a 22-yard field goal. Afterwards, an action-packed fourth quarter ensued. Minnesota increased its lead with Favre hooking up with Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown pass, but the Ravens continued to hang around as quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] found wide receiver [[Mark J. Clayton|Mark Clayton]] on a 32-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings replied with Longwell's 29-yard field goal, but Baltimore took lead for the first time in the game as Flacco hooked up with wide receiver [[Derrick Mason]] on a 12-yard touchdown pass and Rice running 33 yards for a touchdown. Minnesota then regained the lead as Longwell booted a 31-yard field goal after a 58-yard pass from quarterback Brett Favre to wide receiver Sidney Rice. The Ravens got a last-minute drive into scoring range, but Hauschka's 44-yard field goal attempt went wide left, preserving the Vikings' perfect season.

With the win, the Vikings acquired their first 6â0 start since [[2003 Minnesota Vikings season|2003]] (unfortunately that team did not make the playoffs). Also, dating back to Week 17 of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], Minnesota has won seven-straight regular season games for the first time since [[2000 Minnesota Vikings season|2000]].

Hoping to rebound from their first loss of the season to the Steelers, the Vikings flew to [[Lambeau Field]] for the highly anticipated Week 8 divisional rematch with the [[Green Bay Packers]], as quarterback [[Brett Favre]] made his return to his former team.

In the first quarter, the Packers scored the game's first points as kicker [[Mason Crosby]] made a 37-yard field goal following a miscue by Vikings center John Sullivan (Favre audibled for another play but Sullivan snapped the ball before Favre completed his audible). Minnesota responded with a 1-yard touchdown from running back [[Adrian Peterson]]. In the second quarter, the Vikings added onto their lead as Favre completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]], followed by kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] (another former Packer) nailing a 41-yard field goal.

Minnesota picked up where they left off in the third quarter as Favre hooked up with rookie wide receiver [[Percy Harvin]] on a 51-yard touchdown pass, yet Green Bay started to rally as Crosby booted a 26-yard field goal, followed by quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] finding tight end [[Spencer Havner]] on a 16-yard and a 5-yard touchdown pass. The Vikings answered in the fourth quarter with Favre connecting with tight end/fullback [[Jeff Dugan]] on a 2-yard touchdown pass. The Packers tried to come back as Rodgers completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Greg Jennings]] (with a failed 2-point conversion), but Minnesota pulled away with Favre finding wide receiver [[Bernard Berrian]] on a 16-yard touchdown pass.

With their first season-sweep of the Packers in four years, the Vikings went into their bye week at 7â1, and took a commanding two and a half game lead in the NFC North over the second-place Packers. Favre threw at least 4 touchdowns for the 21st time in his career, matching the NFL record held by Dan Marino. This also marks Vikings head coach Brad Childress' first win at Green Bay (he is 3â5 overall against the Packers).

====Week 9: Bye week====
During the Vikings' bye week, both Green Bay and Chicago lost their games (to [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers|Tampa Bay]] 38â28 and [[Arizona Cardinals|Arizona]] 41â21 respectively), allowing the Vikings to gain a three-game lead in the division standings and moving them a step closer to qualification for the playoffs and first round bye.

Coming off their bye week, the Vikings were at home and met in an NFC North duel with the Detroit Lions, who hadn't won in the Metrodome since 1997. In the first quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 22-yard field goal. They increased their lead in the second quarter as running back Adrian Peterson scored on a 22-yard TD run. However, Lions kicker Jason Hanson kicked a 38-yard field goal late in the quarter. At the beginning of the second half, a fumble by the Lions on their first play from scrimmage was recovered at their 29 yard line by the Vikings. Peterson ran twice on the ensuing drive, scoring on a 1-yard TD run to make it a 17â3 lead. The Lions responded with a 15-play, 84-yard drive, capped off by an 8-yard TD pass from Lions QB Matthew Stafford to TE Will Heller. Nevertheless, the Vikings pulled away in the fourth quarter as Favre completed an 8-yard pass to TE Jeff Dugan and kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 35-yard field goal.

With the win, the Vikings moved to 8â1, and compiled a 4â0 record against their NFC North rivals. The Vikings accrued nearly 500 yards of total offense, including 303 yards in the first half alone. The Vikings also had 13 penalties, a season-high. Wide receiver Sidney Rice had a big day, catching seven passes for 201 yards, including a 56-yard reception in the opening seconds of the fourth quarter. Rice was named NFC Offensive Player of the Week for Week 10, the first time he has received this award. Favre and Peterson were voted Fedex Air and Ground Players of the Week.

Closing out the first half was a 3-yard TD pass from Favre to wide receiver Bernard Berrian to make a 21â0 Vikings halftime lead, the first time of the season the Vikings kept their opponent scoreless in the first half. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued to dominate as Favre found wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 7-yard TD pass. Seattle scored their first points of the game when kicker Olindo Mare nailed a 40-yard field goal. Finally, the Vikings put the game away as second-string QB [[Tarvaris Jackson]] found Rice again on a 34-yard TD pass. The Seahawks tried to rally with a 1-yard TD run by running back Justin Forsett (with a failed 2-point conversion), but the Vikings prevented the Seahawks comeback from advancing any further.

With the win, the Vikings improved to 9â1. Brett Favre threw 4 TD passes for the 22nd time in his career (second of the season), breaking the mark set by Dan Marino.

Coming off their easy win over the Seahawks, the Vikings stayed at home, donned their throwback uniforms, and faced the Chicago Bears in a Week 12 duel. After a scoreless first quarter, the Vikings drew first blood as quarterback Brett Favre completed a 15-yard [[Touchdown|TD]] pass to rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin. The Bears responded with QB Jay Cutler firing a 24-yard TD pass to WR Johnny Knox. The Vikings responded with Favre hooking up with running back Chester Taylor on a 10-yard TD pass, along with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 52-yard field goal. Finally, the Vikings closed out the first half with Favre finding tight end Visanthe Shiancoe on a 6-yard TD pass. In the third quarter, the Bears tried to rally with kicker Robbie Gould nailing a 38-yard field goal. However, the Vikings finally shut out the Bears for the rest of the second half, and kicker Ryan Longwell made field goals of 37 and 20 yards. Running back Adrian Peterson also had a 5-yard TD run (with a missed extra point attempt).

With the win, the Vikings improved to 10â1, and compiled a 5â0 record against their NFC North rivals. Their &quot;magic number&quot; decreased to two, meaning that any combination of two Vikings wins or Packers losses would result in the Vikings clinching their second consecutive NFC North division title. On Wednesday December 2, the NFL honored Brett Favre with the NFC Offensive Player of the Month for November. It was the sixth time in his career that he won the award.

Coming off their easy home win over the Bears, the Vikings flew to the desert for a Week 13 Sunday Night duel with the defending NFC champion Arizona Cardinals. In the first quarter, Minnesota got on the board with quarterback Brett Favre completing a 3-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. It was originally ruled an incomplete pass as Shiancoe stepped out of bounds, but Minnesota challenged and won based on the fact that Shiancoe had both feet in bounds and the referee counted Shiancoe's third step, thereby making the original ruling on the field to be overturned. The Cardinals then responded with quarterback Kurt Warner finding wide receiver Anquan Boldin on a 2-yard TD pass.

In the second quarter, Arizona took the lead with Warner finding Boldin again on a 39-yard TD pass. The Vikings responded with kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 25-yard field goal. However, the Cardinals took the lead at halftime when Warner completed a 34-yard TD pass to wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald. In the third quarter, Arizona increased their lead when kicker Neil Rackers kicked field goals of 31 and 30 yards. In the fourth quarter, Arizona kicker Neil Rackers nailed a 29-yard field goal. However, the Vikings tried to rally with Favre hooking up with rookie wide receiver Percy Harvin on a 31-yard TD pass. The Vikings tried an onside kick, which they did not recover and Arizona ran out the clock to seal their win.

With only their second loss of the season, the Vikings not only fell to 10â2, but they lost starting linebacker E.J. Henderson to a season-ending broken leg.

Hoping to rebound from their devastating Sunday Night loss to the Cardinals, the Vikings went home and met the Cincinnati Bengals in a Week 14 duel. After a scoreless first quarter, Minnesota took first blood as kicker Ryan Longwell nailed a 41-yard field goal. They increased their lead later in the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 9-yard TD pass. Cincinnati responded with quarterback Carson Palmer finding wide receiver Chad Ochocinco on a 15-yard TD pass, however the Vikings quickly scored two field goals by kicker Ryan Longwell (from 23 and 44 yards out) to put the Vikings up 16â7 at halftime. In the third quarter, the Vikings scored the period's only points as running back Adrian Peterson got a 1-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Cincinnati tried to rally with kicker Shayne Graham nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Vikings put the game away with running back Adrian Peterson's 3-yard TD run.

With the win, the Vikings not only improved to 11â2 on the season, they also secured a playoff berth for the second consecutive season and improved upon the record from the previous season (10â6). Their &quot;magic number&quot; decreased to one, meaning that either a Green Bay loss at Pittsburgh or a Vikings win against Carolina on Sunday night would make Minnesota repeat division champions for the first time since 1978, when they won six consecutive NFC Central titles. Also, if the Eagles lost against San Francisco, the Vikings would also clinch a first-round bye in the NFC playoffs.

Coming off their home win over the Bengals, the Vikings flew to Bank of America Stadium to face the Carolina Panthers in a Week 15 Sunday Night duel. The Vikings clinched the NFC North about an hour before the game thanks in part to Pittsburgh's 37â36 last-second win over the Packers. With a win, the Vikings would be one game behind New Orleans to clinch homefield advantage. After a scoreless first quarter, Carolina got on the board with quarterback Matt Moore finding fullback Brad Hoover on a 1-yard TD pass. The extra point attempt was blocked, however. The Vikings then took the lead later in the quarter with running back Adrian Peterson's 4-yard TD run. After yet another scoreless quarter, it was all Carolina as Matt Moore completed a 42-yard TD pass to wide receiver Steve Smith, as well as running back Jonathan Stewart running in a 3-yard TD, as well as catching a 2-yard TD pass from Moore.

With the loss, the Vikings fell to 11â3. Reports surfaced after the game suggesting that there was tension between Vikings quarterback Brett Favre and head coach Brad Childress. The incident was later resolved.

Hoping to rebound from their fourth-quarter collapse to the Panthers, the Vikings flew to Soldier Field to face Jay Cutler and the Chicago Bears in a Week 16 rematch to conclude the 40th season of Monday Night Football. Due to the Saints losing to Tampa Bay 20â17 in overtime the previous day, the Vikings needed to win their last two games and have the Saints lose to Carolina the next week in order to clinch homefield advantage. In the first quarter, the Bears drew first blood as kicker Robbie Gould nailed a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Bears increased their lead with Gould nailing a 42-yard field goal. They increased their lead with Cutler firing a 7-yard TD pass to tight end Greg Olsen. The Bears then closed out the first half with Gould's 41-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Vikes started to rally with running back Adrian Peterson's 1-yard touchdown run (with the extra point attempt blocked). The Bears increased their lead over the Vikings with Cutler's 2-yard TD pass to tight end Desmond Clark. The Vikings then closed out the quarter with quarterback Brett Favre firing a 6-yard TD pass to tight end Visanthe Shiancoe. An exciting fourth quarter ensued. The Vikings started out the quarter's scoring with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal, along with Adrian Peterson's second 1-yard TD run. The Bears then responded with Cutler firing a 20-yard TD pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett. The Vikings then completed the remarkable comeback with Favre finding wide receiver Sidney Rice on a 6-yard TD pass on 4th-and-goal with 15 seconds left in regulation. The Bears then took a knee to force overtime. In overtime, the Bears won the toss and marched down the field, stopping at the 35-yard line. However, the potential game-winning 45-yard field goal attempt by Gould went wide right, giving the Vikings a chance to win. After a exchange of punts, the Vikings had the ball at the 26-yard line with 11 minutes left in the period. On the first play of scrimmage, Favre fired a screen pass to Peterson who caught it and went 16 yards, before being confronted by Hunter Hillenmeyer, who caused Peterson to fumble the ball, which was then recovered by Bears' linebacker Nick Roach. The Bears then won on Jay Cutler's game-winning 39-yard TD pass to wide receiver Devin Aromashodu.

With the loss, not only did the Vikings fall to 11â4, they also surrendered homefield advantage to the Saints.

Hoping to break a two-game primetime losing skid, the Vikings went home to Mall of America Field for the Week 17 season finale against the New York Giants. The Vikings needed a win '''and''' an Eagles loss to Dallas later in the day in order to clinch a first-round bye in the playoffs. They also came into the game hoping to go 8â0 at home for the first time since the 15â1 season of 1998. The Vikings drew first blood in the first quarter with quarterback Brett Favre finding tight end Visanthe Shiancoe (a former Giant) on a 10-yard TD pass for the only score of the period. In the second quarter, the Vikings increased their lead with kicker Ryan Longwell's 41-yard field goal. Later in the quarter, it was all touchdowns as Adrian Peterson scored from one yard out, as well as Favre firing two touchdown passes to wide receiver Sidney Rice from 4 and 12 yards out. The 31â0 halftime lead was the second time of the season that the Vikes shut out their opponent in the first half, as well as tying a franchise record for the largest halftime lead. In the third quarter, the Vikings continued to destroy the Giants with Favre's 1-yard TD pass to fullback Naufahu Tahi on 4th-and-goal, along with kicker Ryan Longwell's field goals of 24 and 27 yards. The Giants only mustered a 1-yard TD run in the fourth quarter by running back Danny Ware.

With the win, the Vikings improved to 12â4, the franchise's best record since the 15â1 1998 campaign. With Dallas beating Philadelphia 24â0 later in the day, the Vikings clinched a first-round bye. Brett Favre threw at least four TD passes for the third time this season, as well as being honored with his third NFC Offensive Player of the Week award. The three awards are the most he has received in one season in his 19-year NFL career.

This game began while many TV show hosts and sports analysts were convinced that a red-hot Dallas team was going to end the Vikings' explosive season with Brett Favre. Romo had been throwing more accurately than ever, and because the Vikings had a week off, even their own fans were feeling the pressure of facing a tough Dallas team.

Entering the playoffs as the NFC's #2 seed, the Vikings began their playoff run at home in the NFC Divisional Round against the #3 [[Dallas Cowboys]]. Minnesota delivered the opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback [[Brett Favre]] found wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]] on a 47-yard touchdown pass. The Cowboys got on the board in the second quarter with a 33-yard field goal from kicker [[Shaun Suisham]], yet the Vikings came right back with Favre hooking up with Rice again on a 16-yard touchdown pass, followed by a 23-yard field goal from kicker [[Ryan Longwell]]. After a scoreless third quarter, Minnesota delivered the final strike in the fourth quarter as Longwell nailed a 28-yard field goal, followed by Favre's 45-yard touchdown pass to Rice and his 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]].

With the win, the Vikings advanced to their ninth [[NFC Championship Game]] in team history, and their first appearance since the 2000 season (lost 41â0 to the New York Giants) with a 13â4 record. Brett Favre became the oldest player to start and win a playoff game, but also won his first postseason game in four against Dallas.

Coming off their dominant divisional home win over the Cowboys, the Vikings flew to the [[Louisiana Superdome]] for the [[NFC Championship Game]] against the top-seeded [[New Orleans Saints]]. Minnesota delivered the opening strike in the first quarter with running back [[Adrian Peterson]]'s 19-yard touchdown run. The Saints answered with quarterback [[Drew Brees]] completing a 38-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Pierre Thomas (American football)|Pierre Thomas]], yet the Vikings regained the lead as quarterback [[Brett Favre]] found wide receiver [[Sidney Rice]] on a 5-yard touchdown pass. In the second quarter, New Orleans tied the game again on Brees' 9-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Devery Henderson]].

The Saints took the lead in the third quarter with Thomas' 9-yard touchdown run, yet Minnesota tied the game as Peterson got a 1-yard touchdown run. In the fourth quarter, New Orleans got the lead again as Brees hooked up with running back [[Reggie Bush]] on a 5-yard touchdown pass, yet the Vikings tied the game again with Peterson's 2-yard touchdown run.  After stopping the Saints offense the Vikings got the ball back and were close to field goal range in the final 30 seconds when they were flagged for too many men on the field; on the next play Favre rolled to the right as a hole opened up, but instead of running forward he threw the ball deep across his body and it was picked off by the Saints, forcing overtime.

In overtime, New Orleans drove down field amid a number of controversial calls,{{cn|date=June 2011}} and Minnesota fell as Saints kicker [[Garrett Hartley]] nailed the game-ending 40-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Vikings' season ended with an overall record of 13â5. Doomed by turnovers â the Vikings had an uncanny six fumbles, three of which they lost, plus two interceptions by Brett Favre â the Vikes lost another NFC Championship Game in overtime, this one reminiscent of the 1998â99 loss to the [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the Metrodome.

==Pro Bowl==
Eight Minnesota Vikings players were originally selected for the [[2010 Pro Bowl]]: five on offense (Brett Favre, Adrian Peterson, Sidney Rice, Bryant McKinnie and Steve Hutchinson), two on defense (Jared Allen and Kevin Williams) and one special teamer (Heath Farwell). Of these, six were selected to start the game, with Favre and Rice going as reserves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2010 Pro Bowl rosters |url=http://www.nfl.com/probowl/story?id=09000d5d8155c2fa&amp;template=with-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true |work=NFL.com |publisher=National Football League |date=December 30, 2009 |accessdate=December 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as [[Philadelphia Eagles]] wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]] was voted as a starter at both wide receiver and kickoff returner, a replacement had to be selected at KR; Percy Harvin was added to the roster on January 4, 2010, making it nine Vikings in the NFC roster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Wobschall |title=Harvin Added To Pro Bowl Roster |url=http://blog.vikings.com/2010/01/04/harvin-added-to-pro-bowl-roster/ |work=vikings.com |publisher=Minnesota Vikings Football |date=January 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antoine Winfield]] was added to the NFC roster as an extra [[cornerback]] on January 19, 2010, bringing the Vikings' contribution to the roster to 10 players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Vikings CB Winfield receives second consecutive Pro Bowl honor |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d815d4f6a&amp;template=with-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true |work=nfl.com |publisher=National Football League |date=January 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 19, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had the Vikings reached [[Super Bowl XLIV]], none of their players would have appeared in the 2010 Pro Bowl, but they lost to the [[New Orleans Saints]] in the NFC Championship Game. Nevertheless, QB Brett Favre (ankle), CB Antoine Winfield (foot) and KR Percy Harvin (migraine headaches) all pulled out as a result of their various ailments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pro Bowl rosters receiver makeover with 17 new players |url=http://www.nfl.com/probowl/story?id=09000d5d815f832a&amp;template=with-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true |work=NFL.com |publisher=National Football League |date=January 25, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; OT Bryant McKinnie was cut from the NFC roster on January 30 after missing four of the five practice sessions and attending only one team meeting; he claimed, via [[SMS|text message]] to the [[Star Tribune]], that his absence was due to a lack of physical fitness.
