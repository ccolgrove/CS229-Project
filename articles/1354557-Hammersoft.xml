'''Mary Tamm''' (born 22 March 1950) is an [[England|English]] [[actress]]. She is best known for being the first actress to play the character of [[Romana]] in the [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/4652052.Mary_meets_an_old_friend/|title=Dr Who star returns to Bradford roots|date=28 September 2009|publisher=[[Bradford Telegraph and Argus]]|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; opposite [[Tom Baker]] as [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]], from the 1978â1979 season known collectively as ''[[The Key to Time]]''.

==Early life==
Mary Tamm was born in [[Dewsbury]], [[West Yorkshire]], and is of [[Estonians|Estonian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wiltshire/content/articles/2007/09/21/mary_tamm_interview_feature.shtml|title=Interview with Mary Tamm|publisher=[[BBC Wiltshire]]|date=21 September 2007|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is a graduate and an associate member of the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]].

==Acting career==
Tamm began her acting career on the stage with the [[Birmingham]] Repertory Company in 1971, moving to London in 1972 and appearing in the musical ''Mother Earth''. Before her association with ''Doctor Who'', Tamm acted in several motion pictures, most notably ''[[The Odessa File (film)|The Odessa File]]'' (1974) and ''[[The Likely Lads (film)|The Likely Lads]]'' (1976). In 1981  she took the part of Rhoda Dawes in [[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Cards on the Table]]'' at London's Vaudeville Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Programme for ''Cards on the Table'' (Vaudeville Theatre): Theatreprint No 80, May 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

Tamm was not initially interested in playing a companion to the Doctor as she believed that the role was merely that of the &quot;[[damsel in distress]]&quot;. However, she changed her mind when assured by the producers that Romana would be different. Romana was a [[Time Lord|Time Lady]], a member of the Doctor's own people and therefore as capable as the Doctor. She left the programme after only one season as she felt that the character had reverted to the traditional assistant role and could not be developed further.&lt;ref name=&quot;marytamm.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=marytamm.com | url=http://www.marytamm.com/page3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role of Romana was assumed by [[Lalla Ward]], later briefly Tom Baker's wife. In a 2007 interview, Tamm stated that she was willing to film a [[Regeneration (Doctor Who)|regeneration]] sequence to allow a smooth transition between her tenure and that of Ward, but was not invited to do so.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There's Something About Mary&quot;, a DVD featurette on ''The Key to Time - Special Edition'' (BBC Video/2 Entertain, 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; She has also stated that the rumour that she left because of the pregnancy of her daughter is false and was invented by producer [[John Nathan-Turner]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.marytamm.com/page6.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/s7/doctor-who/interviews/a182536/mary-tamm-doctor-who.html&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources state that her pregnancy was the reason that she was not invited to film a regeneration sequence.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.shannonsullivan.com/drwho/serials/5j.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Tamm has acted in both film and television, playing the characters of [[Penny Crosbie]] in the [[soap opera]] ''[[Brookside]]'' from 1993 to 1996,&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/the-5minute-interview-mary-tamm-actress-403300.html|title=The 5-minute Interview: Mary Tamm, Actress|date=24 September 2007|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2009-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yvonne Edwards in the [[BBC]] drama ''[[The Eustace Bros.|Paradise Heights]]'' (2002), as well as guest roles in many other television programmes. Tamm returned to the role of Romana in the second series of the ''[[Gallifrey]]'' audio plays produced by [[Big Finish Productions]]. Her first appearance in these was in ''[[Gallifrey: Lies]]'' (2005). She has also appeared (as herself) in the Special Features of the 2007 DVD boxed set release of ''[[The Key to Time]]'', discussing her season long stint on the programme.

In August 2009, Tamm made a brief, one-week appearance as [[Orlenda]], in ''[[EastEnders]]''.

==Personal life==
Tamm married Marcus Ringrose in 1978. They have one daughter and a grandson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Indy&quot;/&gt;

Her autobiography entitled ''First Generation'' was published in September 2009 by Fantom Films.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fantom Films&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Fantom Films | url=http://www.fantomfilms.co.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
