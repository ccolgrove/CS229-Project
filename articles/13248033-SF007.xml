'''MyDefrag''' (formerly '''[[JkDefrag]]''') is a [[freeware]] [[Defragmentation|disk defragmenting utility]] for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. JkDefrag was developed by Jeroen Kessels from 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Information obtained from product release notes: history.txt file&lt;/ref&gt; The major change between JkDefrag and MyDefrag is the inclusion of a [[Script (computing)|scripting]] language.  This permits control of all the algorithms and techniques used in MyDefrag.  A number of pre-written scripts allow simple actions such as consolidation of free space, fast or thorough defragmention, and the ability to lay files out on disk exactly where required, sorted by filename, access time, size etc. The most noticeable feature is the inclusion of a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), making the utility more user-friendly. Another feature load in the 'hints' present in Windows about which files need loading in which order when commonly-used programs run and during system boot.  MyDefrag claims to lay out files on disk correctly in order to speed up these common tasks.

MyDefrag is the continuation of Kessels's [[open source]] program [[JkDefrag]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kessels|first=Jeroen|title=MyDefrag version 4 sneak preview|url=http://www.kessels.com/forum/index.php?topic=1484.msg8945#msg8945|date = 2009-01-15|accessdate = 2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; with many changes, and is distributed free of charge under a [[closed source]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyDefrag v4 End User License Agreement|url=http://www.mydefrag.com/Manual-License.html|accessdate=2010-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like JkDefrag, MyDefrag only uses the standard Windows defragmentation [[API]].
