'''Darwin''' is an [[open source]] [[POSIX]]-compliant computer [[operating system]] released by [[Apple Inc.]] in 2000. It is composed of code developed by Apple, as well as code derived from [[NeXTSTEP]], [[BSD]], and other [[free software]] projects.

Darwin forms the core set of components upon which [[Mac OS X]], [[Apple TV]], and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] are based. It is compatible with the [[Single UNIX Specification]] version 3 (SUSv3) and [[POSIX]] UNIX applications and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Apple Inc.|title=Mac OS X Leopard - Technology - UNIX|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/leopard/technology/unix.html|work=Leopard Technology Overview|accessdate=2009-05-19|quote=Leopard is now an Open Brand UNIX 03 Registered Product, conforming to the SUSv3 and POSIX 1003.1 specifications for the C API, Shell Utilities, and Threads.}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Open Group|title=Mac OS X Version 10.5 Leopard on Intel-based Macintosh computers certification|url=http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/brand3555.htm|accessdate=2009-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Darwin's heritage began with [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTSTEP]] operating system (later known as [[OPENSTEP]]), first released in 1989. After Apple bought NeXT in 1997, it announced it would base its next operating system on OPENSTEP. This was developed into [[Rhapsody (operating system)|Rhapsody]] in 1997 and the Rhapsody-based [[Mac OS X Server 1.0]] in 1999. In 2000, Rhapsody was [[fork (software)|forked]] into Darwin and released as [[open-source software]] under the [[Apple Public Source License]] (APSL), and components from Darwin are present in Mac OS X today.

Up to Darwin 8.0, Apple released a binary installer (as an [[ISO image]]) after each major Mac OS X release that allowed one to install Darwin on [[PowerPC]] and [[Intel x86]] computers as a standalone operating system. Minor updates were released as packages that were installed separately. Darwin is now only available as source code,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jordan Hubbard|Hubbard, Jordan]] (October 31, 2007). [http://lists.apple.com/archives/Darwinos-users/2007/Oct/msg00006.html &quot;Re: Darwin 9.0 Source Code Available.&quot;] Apple Mailing Lists. Retrieved on 2007-11-27.&lt;/ref&gt; except for the [[ARM architecture|ARM]] variant, which has not been released in any form separately from iOS. However, the older versions of Darwin are still available in binary form.

==Design==
===Kernel===
Darwin is built around [[XNU]], a [[hybrid kernel]] that combines the [[Mach (kernel)|Mach]] 3 [[microkernel]], various elements of [[BSD]] (including the process model, [[network stack]], and [[virtual file system]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/OSX_Technology_Overview/SystemTechnology/chapter_3_section_2.html &quot;Darwin.&quot;] [[Apple Developer Connection]]. Retrieved on 2008-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt; and an object-oriented [[device driver]] [[Application programming interface|API]] called [[I/O Kit]].&lt;ref&gt;Singh, Amit (January 7, 2004).[http://www.kernelthread.com/mac/osx/arch_xnu.html &quot;XNU: The Kernel.&quot;] ''Kernel Thread''. Retrieved on 2008-05-04.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the benefits of this choice of kernel are the [[Mach-O]] binary format, which allows a single executable file (including the kernel itself) to support multiple [[Central processing unit|CPU]] architectures, and the mature support for [[symmetric multiprocessing]] in Mach. The hybrid kernel design compromises between the flexibility of a microkernel and the performance of a [[monolithic kernel]].

===Hardware and software support===
Darwin currently includes support for both [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] variants of the [[Intel x86]] [[microprocessor|processor]] used in the [[Macintosh|Mac]] and [[Apple TV]] as well as the 32-bit [[ARM architecture|ARM]] processor used in the [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]]. An open-source port of the [[XNU]] kernel exists which supports Darwin on Intel and [[AMD]] x86 platforms not officially supported by Apple.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/xnu-dev/ Voodoo XNU Kernel].&lt;/ref&gt;

It supports the [[POSIX]] API by way of its [[BSD]] lineage and a large number of programs written for various other [[UNIX-like]] systems can be [[compiler|compiled]] on Darwin with no changes to the [[source code]].

Darwin does not include many of the defining elements of Mac OS X, such as the [[Carbon (API)|Carbon]] and [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] APIs or the [[Quartz Compositor]] and [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua user interface]], and thus cannot run Mac applications. It does, however, support a number of lesser known features of Mac OS X, such as mDNSResponder, which is the [[multicast]] [[domain name system|DNS]] responder and a core component of the [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] networking technology, and [[launchd]], an advanced [[Operating system service management|service management]] [[software framework|framework]].

==License==
In July 2003, Apple released Darwin under version 2.0 of the [[Apple Public Source License]] (APSL), which the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) approved as a [[free software license]]. Previous releases had taken place under an earlier version of the APSL that did not meet the FSF's definition of free software, although it met the requirements of the [[Open Source Definition]].

==Mascot==
[[Image:Hexley.png|left|70px]]The Darwin developers decided to adopt a [[mascot]] in 2000, and chose Hexley the [[Platypus]], over other contenders, such as an [[Aqua (theme)|Aqua]] [[Parodies of the ichthys symbol|Darwin fish]], [[Clarus the Dogcow]], and an [[orca]]. Hexley is a [[cartoon]] platypus who usually wears a cap resembling a [[demon]]'s horns. He carries a trident, similar to the [[BSD Daemon]], to symbolize the daemon's [[fork (operating system)|forking]] of [[process (computing)|processes]]. Hexley was designed by Jon Hooper. Apple does not sanction Hexley as a logo for Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Jon. [http://www.hexley.com/ &quot;Homepage of Hexley the DarwinOS mascot.&quot;] ''The Home of Hexley the Platypus''. Retrieved on 2008-11-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hexley's name was a mistake: it was originally supposed to be named after [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], a 19th century English [[biologist]] who was a well-known champion of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] (nicknamed &quot;Darwin's bulldog&quot;). However, ignorance led not only to a mistake in Huxley's name, but who he was thought to be. The developers apparently thought he was simply Darwin's assistant, when in fact he was a prominent biologist in his own right. By the time the mistake had been discovered, it was deemed too late to change, and the incorrect name &quot;Hexley&quot; was kept.&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Jon.

The jump in version numbers from Darwin 1.4.1 to 5.1 with the release of Mac OS X v10.1.1 was designed to tie Darwin to the Mac OS X version and build numbering system. In the build numbering system of Mac OS X, every version has a unique beginning build number, which identifies what whole version of Mac OS X it is part of. Mac OS X v10.0 had build numbers starting with 4, 10.1 had build numbers starting with 5, and so forth (earlier build numbers represented developer releases). The point release number in the Darwin version is always the same as the second point number in the Mac OS X version. In the case of Mac OS X v10.1.1 (the version where the jump in version numbers was made), this was build 5M28 and the 10.1.1 release, from which a version number of 5.1 was derived.&lt;ref&gt;Prabhakar, Ernie (November 9, 2001). [http://lists.apple.com/archives/darwin-development/2001/Nov/msg00189.html &quot;Darwin Version - New Scheme in Software Update 1.&quot;] Apple Mailing Lists. Retrieved on 2008-06-02.&lt;/ref&gt;

The command &lt;tt&gt;[[uname]] -r&lt;/tt&gt; in [[Terminal (application)|Terminal]] will show the Darwin version number, and the command &lt;tt&gt;uname -v&lt;/tt&gt; will show the [[XNU]] build version string, which includes the Darwin version number.

==Derived projects==
Due to the free software nature of Darwin, there are many projects that aim to modify or enhance the operating system.

===OpenDarwin===
[[Image:Distro-1.1-gnome.png|thumb|300px|[[GNOME]] running on OpenDarwin.]]

OpenDarwin was a community-led operating system based on the Darwin system. It was founded in April 2002 by [[Apple Inc.]] and [[Internet Systems Consortium]]. Its goal was to increase collaboration between Apple developers and the [[free software community]]. Apple benefited from the project because improvements to OpenDarwin would be incorporated into Darwin releases; and the free/open source community supposedly benefited from being given complete control over its own operating system, which could then be used in free software distributions such as [[GNU-Darwin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opendarwin.info/opendarwin.org/en/ &quot;OpenDarwin.&quot;] OpenDarwin Project. Retrieved on 2006-05-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 25, 2006, the OpenDarwin team announced that the project was shutting down, as they felt OpenDarwin had &quot;become a mere hosting facility for Mac OS X related projects,&quot; and that the efforts to create a standalone Darwin operating system had failed. They also state: &quot;Availability of sources, interaction with Apple representatives, difficulty building and tracking sources, and a lack of interest from the community have all contributed to this.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;OpenDarwin Core Team and Administrators (July 25, 2006).

===PureDarwin===
In 2007, the [http://www.puredarwin.org PureDarwin] project was launched to continue where OpenDarwin left off, and is currently working to produce a release based on Darwin 9. There is a developer preview available, called &quot;PureDarwin XMas&quot;, based on Darwin 9. This release has [[X11]], [[DTrace]], and [[ZFS]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puredarwin.org/downloads PureDarwin Download Page].&lt;/ref&gt; PureDarwin nano is another release of PureDarwin that is supposed to be minimalistic.
