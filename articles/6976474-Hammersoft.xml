'''Julien Baudet''' (born January 13, 1979 in [[Grenoble]]) is a former [[France|French]] [[Association football|footballer]] and current [[Coach (sport)|manager]]. 

== Club career ==

=== Europe ===

Although excelling as a [[skier]] in his youth, Baudet chose to concentrate on football, beginning his career with [[Toulouse FC]] in France, where he spent two years, clocking up 21 league appearances. 

In 2001 Baudet moved to [[Oldham Athletic A.F.C.|Oldham Athletic]] in the [[Football League Second Division|third tier]] in England on a free transfer.  Spending two years at Oldham, he made 44 league appearances, scoring his first goal on 20 April 2002 against [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.|Queens Park Rangers]].

After a free transfer in summer 2003 to [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] in the [[Football League First Division|second tier]], Baudet played 11 times in the league before a free transfer to [[Notts County F.C.|Notts County]] in [[Football League Two]], where he spent two seasons as a regular starter and became club captain.

In July 2006, Baudet moved on yet another free transfer - to [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] - where he improved his game a great deal under the guidance of [[Steve Holland (footballer)|Steve Holland]] and [[Dario Gradi]], becoming the club captain after the retirement of [[Neil Cox (footballer)|Neil Cox]]. He scored his first goal away at [[Carlisle United F.C.|Carlisle United]], and became quickly became a fans favourite and a vital part of the whole team including defence and attack. He was known as &quot;the beast&quot; by Crewe fans for his strong bustling presence and his contributions to the attack with spectacular long range free-kicks. 

After being voted the Fans' Player of the Year for the [[2007-08 in English football|2007-08]] season, Baudet commented, with typical understatement, that he was &quot;relatively pleased&quot; with the way he played over the year and that &quot;like all footballers you do have good and bad days, but I think I have been fairly consistent in what has proved to be a disappointing season for the club&quot;, referring to Crewe's relegation battle to stay in League One.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Great Honour For Baudet |url=http://www.crewealex.premiumtv.co.uk/page/NewsDetail/0,,10414~1307577,00.html |publisher=[[Crewe Alexandra F.C.]] |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2008-05-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== North America ===

On April 17, 2009, Baudet reported that he would transfer at the end of the 2008-09 season to the [[Colorado Rapids]] of [[Major League Soccer]]. On July 25, 2009 Baudet made his competitive home debut for Colorado Rapids, breaking his arm in the first half after landing awkwardly on it. Baudet received a yellow card for the reckless challenge which resulted in the broken arm. Colorado eventually won the game 4-0 over [[New York Red Bulls]].  Upon his return from injury on August 30, 2009, Baudet came on as a substitute and opened his account with the Rapids, scoring the only goal in a 1-0 win over [[Houston Dynamo]].

After winning the [[MLS Cup]] with Colorado, Baudet was traded to [[Seattle Sounders FC]], along with teammate [[Danny Earls]], on November 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/soundersfcblog/2013497325_sounders_fc_trade_vagenas_to_c.html | work=The Seattle Times | first=Joshua | last=Mayers | title=Sounders FC trade Vagenas to Colorado for two defenders | date=November 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Celtic trial ===

On 7 February 2011, Baudet featured in a [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] XI who faced the [[League of Ireland]] team {{fc|Shamrock Rovers}} at the [[Tallaght Stadium]] in [[Dublin]]. He played the full 90 minutes as Celtic ran out 2-0 winners, with goals from [[Daryl Murphy]] and [[Graham Carey]].

== Coaching career ==

After failing to earn a contract with Celtic, Baudet returned to England and began the process of obtaining a [[UEFA Pro Licence]] in coaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.fff.fr/bleus/actu/539884_baudet-de-vrais-shows-a-l-americaine | work=[[French Football Federation]] | first=Antonio | last=Mesa | title=Baudet: &quot;De vrais shows Ã  l'amÃ©ricaine&quot; | date=4 November 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 June 2011, he was named manager of French amateur club AC Seyssinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://ac-seyssinetfoot.footeo.com/actualite/2011/06/19/un-nouvel-entraineur-pour-l-ac-seyssinet.html | work=AC Seyssinet  | title=Un nouvel entraineur pour l'AC Seyssinet  | date=19 June 2011 | language = French }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club currently plays in the Division d'Honneur RÃ©gionale, the seventh division of French football.
