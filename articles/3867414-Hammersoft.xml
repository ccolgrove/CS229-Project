The '''Italy national under-21&amp;nbsp;football team''' is the national under-21 [[Association football|football]] team of [[Italy]] and is controlled by the [[Italian Football Federation]]. 

The team competes in the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship]], held every two years. Italy is the most successful nation in the history of the competition, with five Championships won ([[1992 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1992]], [[1994 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1994]], [[1996 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|1996]], [[2000 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2000]] and [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2004]]).

Following the realignment of [[UEFA]]'s youth competitions in 1976, the Italian Under-21 team was formed. Until 1990, the team had a very good record - reaching the last eight of each of the first seven UEFA U-21 Championships. From 1990 to 2004 the team established near-total dominance of European Under-21&amp;nbsp;football, winning five of the seven tournaments.

The lowest point for the team came in 1997, when it failed to qualify for the 1998 finals. The team won the 2000 tournament finals in Slovakia and the [[2004 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2004]] tournament finals in [[Germany]]. In the [[2006 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2006]] tournament finals in [[Portugal]] the team failed to advance to second round. This was Italy's 14th U-21 finals tournament.

Italy's Under-21s played the first match at the new [[Wembley Stadium]], on 24 March 2007, against [[England national under-21 football team|England Under-21s]]. The game resulted in a 3-3 draw, with [[Giampaolo Pazzini]] scoring all 3 goals for the Azzurrini.

Prior to the 2008 Olympic games, Italy U-21s went on to win the [[2008 Toulon Tournament]] by beating Chile (1-0) in the final. It was the first time they had won this tournament, previously their best had been runner-up on two occasions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channel4.com/sport/football_italia/may30a.html channel4.com - Football Italia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the [[2009 UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|2009 U-21 Championship]] Italy was eliminated in the semi-finals.
