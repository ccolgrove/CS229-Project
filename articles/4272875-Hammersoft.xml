<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="4272875" ns="0" title="Brino quadruplets"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Lorenzo, Myrinda, Nikolas,''' and '''Zachary Brino''' (born September 21, 1998; [[Woodland Hills, California]]) are the quadruplets born to Tony and Shawna Brino. They have an older half-brother, their father's son from another marriage, named Antonio, who is in the [[U.S. Coast Guard Academy]].

When the quadruplets were five months old, they were cast as twins Sam and David Camden on the television show ''[[7th Heaven]]''. All four of them, plus a set of twins, shared the roles until 2001. Since then, only Lorenzo and Nikolas have played them.

Their parents wanted them to have a normal upbringing and are reluctant to cast them in other TV shows. Their mother has stated that as long as they have fun on television, she will continue to let them act.

Zachary Brino, the only one of these quadruplets to have hazel eyes and wear glasses, appeared on ABC's ''[[What About Brian]]'' as Bobby in the last two episodes of season 2, with his former ''7th Heaven'' co-star Barry Watson.
