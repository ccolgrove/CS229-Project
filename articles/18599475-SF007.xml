'''Ultamatix''' is a tool that automates the addition of [[application software|applications]], [[codecs]], [[fonts]] and [[libraries]] not provided directly by the software repositories of [[Debian]]-based distributions like [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].

==History==
Ultamatix is based on [[Automatix (software)|Automatix]], picking up where its development ended.  It has many of the same characteristics, but works on Ubuntu 8.04, and the developer claims&lt;ref&gt;http://forumubuntusoftware.info/viewtopic.php?f=2&amp;t=1365&amp;st=0&amp;sk=t&amp;sd=a&amp;start=50&amp;#p14250 Cady &quot;TheeManh&quot; Glenn:
Re: Ultimate Edition Script (Ultamatix). Ubuntu Ultimate Edition, discussion forum. Accessed September 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; to have fixed many of the problems with Automatix.

==Supported software==
Ultamatix currently allows the installation of 101 different programs/features, including programs such as the [[Adobe Flash Player]] plugin, [[Adobe Reader]], multimedia [[codec]]s (including MP3, [[Windows Media Audio]] and video-DVD support), fonts, programming software ([[compiler]]s) and games&lt;ref&gt;[http://ultamatix.com/ Ultamatix homepage]. Accessed September 13, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Reception==
Ultamatix has received positive reviews, with [[Softpedia]] calling it &quot;Ultamatix: The New Automatix&quot; &lt;ref name=softpedia&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/Ultamatix-The-New-Automatix-90801.shtml Softpedia: Ultamatix - The new Automatix]. Accessed Accessed September 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, and [[Linux.com]] saying it &quot;may be a worthy successor to Automatix for new Ubuntu and Debian users&quot; and that &quot;The real value of Ultamatix is in making the Linux experience easier for new users&quot; &lt;ref name=linuxcom&gt;[http://www.linux.com/feature/143414 Linux.com/Jeremy LaCroix: Ultamatix may be a worthy successor to Automatix for new Ubuntu and Debian users]

As with its detailed criticism of Automatix&lt;ref name=mjg-1&gt;[http://www.advogato.org/person/mjg59/diary/81.html Matthew Garrett critizises Automatix]. Posted on 4th of August, 2007. Accessed September 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;, many in the Ubuntu community believe&lt;ref name=elkbuntu&gt;[http://www.geekosophical.net/?p=186 Melissa Draper: &quot;Youâre doing what now?!&quot;] Accessed September 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mjg-2&gt;[http://www.advogato.org/person/mjg59/diary/164.html &quot;Matthew Garrent discusses serious design issues in ultamatix&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; that there are better solutions for installing the programs covered with this tool, many of which can be installed either from standard Ubuntu repositories or the third-party [[Medibuntu]] repository.

Developers and users of Ubuntu have also raised concerns&lt;ref&gt;[http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=870104&amp;page=4 Ubuntuforums: Automatix and Ultamatix discussion thread]. Accessed September 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; that Ultamatix and Automatix could create longer-term problems, by installing packages in an 'unclean' manner that can prevent the entire Ubuntu system from being upgraded for security and other reasons. The original developer of Automatix has given some positive and negative comments. Other issues are noted in the comments of [[Softpedia]]'s review &lt;ref name=softpedia /&gt; and the comments in [[Linux.com]]'s review &lt;ref name=linuxcom /&gt;.
