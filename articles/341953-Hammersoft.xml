==Early life==
Olin was born the youngest of three children, in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. She is the daughter of actress [[Britta Holmberg]] and the director [[Stig Olin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/46/Lena-Olin.html Lena Olin Biography (1955-)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; She studied acting at Sweden's [[Swedish National Academy of Mime and Acting|National Academy of Dramatic Art]].

She was crowned [[Miss Scandinavia|Miss Scandinavia 1975]] in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]] in October 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lena-olin.org/articles.php?read=archive/0001 LENA OnLINe :: Press Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
{{Unreferenced section|date= January 2011}}
Olin worked both as a substitute teacher and as a hospital nurse before becoming an actress. Olin performed for over a decade with Sweden's [[Royal Dramatic Theatre]]-ensemble (1980â1994) in classic plays by [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]], and appeared in smaller roles of several Swedish films directed by Bergman and in productions of Swedish Television's TV-Theatre Company.

[[Ingmar Bergman]] cast Olin in ''[[Face to Face (1976 film)|Face to Face]]''. Later she acted at the national stage in Stockholm in several productions directed by Bergman, and with Bergman's production of ''[[King Lear]]'' (in which Olin played Cordelia) she toured the world â [[Paris]], [[Berlin]], [[New York]], [[Copenhagen]], [[Moscow]] and [[Oslo]], among others. Critically acclaimed stage performances by Olin at Sweden's Royal Dramatic Theatre included the leading part as The Daughter in ''[[A Dream Play]]'' by Strindberg, Margarita in the stage adaption of ''[[The Master and Margarita]]'' by [[Mikhail Bulgakov]], [[Goldoni]]'s ''[[The Servant of Two Masters]]'', Ann in [[Edward Bond]]'s ''Summer'', Titania in ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]'' by [[Shakespeare]], [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'', the title role in Ingmar Bergman's rendition of Strindberg's ''[[Miss Julie]]'' and her neurotic Charlotte in the contemporary drama ''Nattvarden'' (''The Last Supper'') by [[Lars NorÃ©n]].

In 1980 she was one of the earliest winners of the Ingmar Bergman Prize, initiated in 1978 by the director himself, who was also one of the two judges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ingmarbergman.se/universe.asp?guid=5163DCFF-BF6F-4FBD-B70F-7C86170908DB Ingmar Bergman Prize]. Retrieved 2011-10-18&lt;/ref&gt;

Olin's international debut in a lead role on film was in Bergman's ''[[After the Rehearsal]]'' (1984). Two years earlier, she had appeared in a small role in the same director's ''[[Fanny and Alexander]]''. In 1988, Olin starred with [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] in her first major part in an English speaking and internationally produced film, ''[[The Unbearable Lightness of Being (film)|The Unbearable Lightness of Being]]'', followed by [[Sydney Pollack]]'s ''[[Havana]]'' (1990), [[Roman Polanski]]'s ''[[The Ninth Gate]]'' (1999) and many others. 

In 1989, she earned an [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nomination for [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for her work in ''[[Enemies, a Love Story (film)|Enemies: A Love Story]],'' in which she portrayed the survivor of a [[Nazism|Nazi]] camp. In 1994 Olin starred in ''[[Romeo Is Bleeding]]'' and played what is perhaps her most extreme character to date; the outrageous hit woman Mona Demarkov - still one of the actress's most popular portrayals on film. 

Olin and director [[Lasse HallstrÃ¶m]] collaborated on the 2000 film ''[[Chocolat (2000 film)|Chocolat]]'', which received five [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations, and on ''[[Casanova (2005 film)|Casanova]]'' (2005). From 2002 to 2006, Olin appeared opposite [[Jennifer Garner]] in her first American television role ever; on the second season of the successful television series ''[[Alias (TV series)|Alias]]''. For her work on the series as [[Irina Derevko]], Olin received an [[Emmy Award]] nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress in 2003. Olin received good reviews for her part in ''Alias'' &amp;mdash; particularly her chemistry with [[Victor Garber]], who played her former husband and sometime-enemy [[Jack Bristow]] &amp;mdash; and was rumored to have been offered a salary in excess of $100,000 per episode to remain part of the cast.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} She left the show after her first and only season; this was, however, to spend more time with her family in New York.

In May 2005, Olin returned to ''Alias'' for a two-episode appearance at the end of the show's fourth season, and subsequently appeared again in the fifth season, initially in a cameo in December 2005, and then following a four-month hiatus she appeared again in April 2006, and for the finale on 22 May 2006.  An upcoming project is supposedly  ''Daughter of the Queen of Sheba'' (which is to be directed by HallstrÃ¶m). Olin had a small but significant role in 2008's Oscar-nominated film ''[[The Reader (2008 film)|The Reader]]'', playing a Jewish survivor of the [[Auschwitz]] [[death march]] in a trial in the 1960s and the woman's daughter twenty years later.

In 2005 she returned to Sweden for a brief period of filming and starred in a supporting role in [[Denmark|Danish]] director [[Simon Staho]]'s film ''[[Bang Bang Orangutang]]'' (with a punk music soundtrack by, among others, [[The Clash]] and [[Iggy Pop]]).

==Personal life==
In 1986 she gave birth to her first child, son  [[Auguste Rahmberg]]. His father is Swedish actor [[Ãrjan Ramberg]], with whom she had acted opposite on stage in many productions. The relationship ended in the late 1980s. In 1994, she married film director [[Lasse HallstrÃ¶m]] (whom she met in Sweden in 1992 back). They married in [[Hedvig Eleonora Church]] in Stockholm. In 1995 they had a daughter, Tora.

Olin lives in [[New York]] with her husband and children.
