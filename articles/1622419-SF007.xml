'''Windows Internet Explorer 7''' (abbreviated as '''IE7''') is a [[web browser]] released by [[Microsoft]] in October 2006. Internet Explorer 7 is part of a long line of versions of [[Internet Explorer]] and was the first major update to the browser in more than 5 years. It ships as the default browser in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] and is offered as a replacement for [[Internet Explorer 6]] for [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]]. Starting from this version, the new Internet Explorer versions do not work with [[Windows NT 4.0]], [[Windows 98]], [[Windows 98 SE]], [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows Me]]. As of January 2011, estimates of IE7's global market share were 9-11%.&lt;ref name=&quot;W3Counter&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Some portions of the underlying architecture, including the rendering engine and security framework, have been improved. New features include [[tabbed browsing]], [[page zooming]], an integrated search box, a [[feed reader]], better internationalization, and improved support for [[web standards]], although it does not pass the [[Acid2]] or [[Acid3]] tests. Security enhancements include a [[phishing]] filter, stronger [[encryption]] on Windows Vista (256-bit from 128-bit in XP), and a &quot;Delete browsing history&quot; button to easily clear private data.

IE7 was superseded by [[Internet Explorer 8]] in March 2009.

==History==
In 2001, Microsoft released [[Internet Explorer 6]] as an update to [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me]], [[Windows NT 4.0]] and [[Windows 2000]] and included it by default in [[Windows XP]]. With the release of IE6 Service Pack 1 in 2003, Microsoft announced that future upgrades to Internet Explorer would come only through future upgrades to Windows, stating that &quot;further improvements to IE will require enhancements to the underlying OS.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On February 15, 2005 at the RSA Conference in San Francisco, Microsoft Chairman [[Bill Gates]] announced that Microsoft was planning a new version of Internet Explorer that would run on Windows XP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

The first beta of IE7 was released on July 27, 2005 for technical testing, and a first public preview version of Internet Explorer 7 (Beta 2 preview: Pre-Beta 2 version) was released on January 31, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2005/07/27/444004.aspx|date=27 July 2005|title=Windows Vista &amp; IE7 Beta 1 Available|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=10 February 2011|work=IEBlog at Microsoft Developer Network|first=Dean|last=Hachamovitch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final public version was released on October 18, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IE7 Is Coming This Month...Are you Ready?|work=IEBlog at Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ie/archive/2006/10/06/ie7-is-coming-this-month_2e002e002e00_are-you-ready_3f00_.aspx|accessdate=10 February 2011|first=Scott|last=Graff|date=6 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, [[Yahoo!]] provided a post-beta version of Internet Explorer 7 bundled with Yahoo! Toolbar and other Yahoo!-specific customizations.

In late 2007 Microsoft announced that Internet Explorer 7 would not be included as part of Windows XP SP3, with both Internet Explorer 6 and 7 receiving updates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/No-Internet-Explorer-7-Will-Not-Be-a-Part-of-Windows-XP-SP3-73896.shtml No, Internet Explorer 7 Will Not(!) Be a Part of Windows XP SP3]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8, 2007, Microsoft removed the [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] component of IE7, allowing it to be downloaded and installed by those without a genuine copy of Windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=21564 IE7 opens to pirated Windows]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a year after IE7's release (end of 2006 to end of 2007) support calls to Microsoft had decreased 10-20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

With this version, Internet Explorer was renamed from Microsoft Internet Explorer to Windows Internet Explorer as part of Microsoft's rebranding of components that are included with Windows.

Internet Explorer 7 introduces the [[Windows RSS Platform]] with which it is tightly integrated and can subscribe to [[RSS]] and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds, synchronize and update them on a schedule and display them with its built-in style sheet.

Version 7 is intended to defend users from [[phishing]] as well as deceptive or malicious software, and it also features full user control of ActiveX and better security framework, including not being integrated as much with Windows&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/article.aspx?newsid=1371 Article regarding Internet Explorer 7's integration into windows], March 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; as previous versions, thereby increasing security. Unlike previous versions, the Internet Explorer [[ActiveX control]] is not hosted in the Windows Explorer process, but rather it runs in its own process. It also includes bug fixes, enhancements to its support for web standards, [[Tabbed document interface|tabbed browsing]] with tab preview and management, a multiple-engine search box, a web feeds reader, [[Internationalized Domain Name]] support (IDN), and antiphishing filter. On October 5, 2007, Microsoft removed the 'genuine software' validation before install, which means that all versions of Windows, whether able to pass validation or not, are able to install the [[Web browser|browser]]. The integrated search box supports [[OpenSearch]].

On Windows Vista, Internet Explorer operates in a special &quot;[[Mandatory Integrity Control|Protected Mode]]&quot;, that runs the browser in a security sandbox that has no WRITE access to the rest of the operating system or file system. When running in Protected Mode, IE7 is a low integrity process; it cannot gain write access to files and registry keys outside of the low-integrity portions of a user's profile. This feature aims to mitigate problems whereby newly-discovered flaws in the browser (or in Add-Ons hosted inside it) allowed hackers to subversively install software on the user's computer (typically spyware).&lt;ref name=&quot;protectedmodeie&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Usability and accessibility===
[[Image:IE7 Quick Tabs.png|thumb|right|Quick Tabs]]

*Version 7  tabs. The user can rearrange tabs by dragging and dropping them as desired.

===Privacy and security===
[[Image:Favcenter.PNG|thumb|right|Favorites Center in ''Favorites view'', ''Feeds view'' and ''History view'']]
*Since it is tightly integrated with the operating system, Internet Explorer makes full use of the accessibility framework provided in Windows. Internet Explorer is also a user interface for [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]], with operations similar to that of [[Windows Explorer]]. However, with version 7, FTP sites are rendered in a hyper linked page, with the folder-like view available if the site is accessed from Windows Explorer. IE7 can itself launch Windows Explorer for FTP sites.
*Protected Mode (available in Windows Vista only), whereby the browser runs in a sandbox with even lower rights than a limited user account. As such, it can only write to the Temporary Internet Files folder and cannot install start-up programs or change any configuration of the operating system without communicating through a broker process. IE7 Protected Mode relies on the User Account Control technology.
*''ActiveX Opt-In'' blocks ActiveX Control unless it allowed to be installed. This feature improves security from unverifiable and vulnerable controls. ActiveX controls can be chosen to be installed on Information Bar. User can turn on and off ActiveX Control by using Add-on Manager.
[[Image:Phishing.PNG|thumb|right|Browsing to a site which IE deems to be a phishing site is blocked by default. The user has to make an explicit choice before continuing.]]
*The new ''Phishing Filter'' offers protection against phishing scams and other websites that may be considered dangerous for a user to enter their personal information into. When enabled, every website the user visits is checked against a master list of known phishing sites. If a site is listed, the user is informed. In light of the privacy implications of this feature, it is not enabled automatically; the user is asked when they start Internet Explorer 7 if they want it enabled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/09/09/463204.aspx Phishing Filter in IE7], IEBlog&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft is working in conjunction with companies that specialize in identifying phishing schemes to ensure the list of known sites is accurate and quickly updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/11/17/494040.aspx New enhancements to Phishing Filter protection for IE], IEBlog&lt;/ref&gt;
*The address bar and status bar appear in all windows including popups which helps to block malicious sites from disguising them as trusted sites. Also the address bar features a color code to visually indicate the trustworthiness of the page. The address bar turns red when a page, with invalid security certificate, is accessed. In case of sites not using any encryption, the address bar is white. And if the page uses high security certificate, the bar turns green.
*Modal windows such as dialog boxes are shown only when the tab that has generated them is selected (in such situations, the tab color becomes orange). On the other hand, the save window is modal and when saving the page shown in a tab, the user cannot browse other tabs.
*The address bar no longer allows JavaScript to be executed on blank pages (about:blank). This feature is still supported on other pages though, which enables [[bookmarklet]]s to work properly. A reason for the change has not been given.
*The status bar no longer allows custom text to be entered (e.g.: &quot;Formatting C:\ 10% Complete |||||||&quot;) and will always show the URL of any link hovered over, for security. It now also shows the target URL of form buttons to help identify forms which submit their data to suspicious sites.
*The ability to limit scripting functions, such as those that modify the status bar or adjust the size or position of the browser window was introduced with IE7.
*&quot;Delete Browsing History&quot; cleans the complete browsing history in a single step. Previously this was a multistage process requiring users to delete browser cache, history, cookies, saved form data and passwords in a series of different steps. This is useful for improving privacy and security in a multiuser environment, such as an Internet cafÃ©.
*''Fix My Settings'' checks at startup or when a setting is changed, if the current settings are unsafe it notifies the user. The user can also press a button in order to fix the settings to a safe state. There is currently no way to disable these warnings.
*Old protocols and technologies removed: [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]], [[TELNET]], Scriptlets, [[DirectX Media|DirectAnimation]], [[XBM]], [[Channel Definition Format|Channels]] (.CDF files) also known as '[[Active Desktop]] Items', etc. The [[Dynamic HTML|DHTML]] Editing Control is being removed from IE7 for Windows Vista to reduce surface area for security attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=MSDN Blogs
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''No Add-ons'' allows IE7 to launch without the installed extensions.
*IE7 cipher strength: 256-bit (Only for Vista, IE7 for XP and Server 2003 only supports 128-bit)
[[Image:EVCert.PNG|thumb|right|Sites presenting [[Extended Validation Certificate|EV Certificates]] are trusted]]
*The address bar turns red when the certificate presented by a secure site has some problems. In that case navigation to the site is blocked by default, and can only be accessed after the user explicitly confirms the navigation.
*IE7 includes support for [[Extended Validation Certificate]]s (EV). When sites present an EV certificate the address bar is shown in green.
*New Group Policy's Administrative Templates (.adm files) for IE7 are loaded automatically onto the Domain Controller when a Group Policy is opened from a workstation where IE7 has been installed. These new administrative templates allow for controlling the Anti-Phishing filter state, for example.
*''Reset Internet Explorer settings'' Deletes all temporary files, disables browser add-ons, and resets all the changed settings to factory settings. It can be used if the browser is in an unusable state.

Microsoft has addressed security issues in two distinct ways within Windows Vista: [[User Account Control]], which forces a user to confirm any action that could affect the stability or security of the system even when logged in as an administrator, and &quot;Protected-mode IE&quot;, which runs the web browser process with much lower permissions than the user.&lt;ref name=&quot;protectedie&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The first vulnerability exclusive to Internet Explorer 7 was posted after 6 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Internet Explorer 7 Window Injection Vulnerability&quot;&gt;[http://secunia.com/advisories/22628/ Internet Explorer 7 Window Injection Vulnerability]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Phishing filter====
Some users have criticised the [[phishing]] filter for being too easy to circumvent. One successful method of bypassing Internet Explorer's Phishing Filter has been reported by redirecting a blacklisted web page to another, non-blacklisted page, using a [[server-side redirect]].  Until the new page is blocked as well, the attack can remain active.  

This flaw means that phishers can keep links from previous emails functioning by simply moving to a new server when their original web page is blacklisted and adding a redirect.  

This has been criticised as doubly serious as the presence of a phishing filter may lull users into a false sense of security when the filter can be bypassed.&lt;ref name=&quot;phishflaw&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Phishing filter went on to be developed into and renamed ''Safety Filter'' and then ''SmartScreen'' by Microsoft, during the development of [[Internet Explorer 8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/150385/ie8b2.html?tk=rss_news|title=Internet Explorer 8 Beta 2: Can It Outfox Firefox?|author=Nick Mediati}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Standards support ===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:IE7 Acid3.png|thumb|right|Results of the [[Acid3]] test on IE7]] --&gt;
* Minor improvements to CSS, DOM, and HTML support have been made. Microsoft's stated goal with version 7 was to fix the most significant bugs and areas which caused the most trouble for developers, however full compatibility with standards was postponed.
* Support for per-pixel [[alpha compositing|alpha channel]] transparency in [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] images has been added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/04/26/412263.aspx IE7 Transparent PNG Implementation], IEBlog&lt;/ref&gt;

The Windows Vista and XP version of Windows Internet Explorer 7 additionally feature an update to the WinInet API. The new version has better support for [[IPv6]], and handles hexadecimal literals in the IPv6 address. It also includes better support for [[Gzip]] and [[deflate]] compression, so that communication with a web server can be compressed and thus will require less data to be transferred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/31/487509.aspx IE's Gzip and deflate support]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/06/06/425875.aspx IE already supports Gzip and deflate]&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer Protected Mode support in WinInet is exclusive to Windows Vista.

Although Internet Explorer 7 is more compliant than previous versions, according to all figures it remains the least standards-compliant compared to other major browsers of the period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webdevout.net/browser_support_summary.php?IE7=on&amp;FX2=on&amp;OP9=on&amp;uas=CUSTOM Web browser standards support summary]. ''Web Devout''.&lt;/ref&gt; It passes neither the [[Acid2]] nor the [[Acid3]] tests, two [[test case]]s designed by the [[Web Standards Project]] to verify CSS compliance.

It is also claimed that lack of support in Internet Explorer is responsible for holding back the widespread adoption by webmasters of several new open technology standards{{Who|date=February 2008}} ([[SVG]], supported elsewhere since 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
