'''Matthew Richard &quot;Matt&quot; Stone''' (born May 26, 1971) is an [[United States|American]] [[screenwriter]], [[Television producer|producer]], [[Voice acting|voice artist]], [[musician]] and [[actor]], best known for being the co-creator of ''[[South Park]]'' along with creative partner and best friend, [[Trey Parker]].

Stone and Parker launched their largely collaborative careers in 1992, making a holiday short titled ''Jesus vs. Frosty''. Their first success came from ''Alferd Packer: The Musical'', subsequently distributed as ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]''. From there he made another short title ''Jesus vs. Santa'', leading him and his college friend [[Trey Parker]] to create the [[animated]] television series ''[[South Park]]'', which has been on television for over a decade. He has four Emmy Awards for his role in ''South Park'', winning for both &quot;Outstanding Programming More Than One Hour&quot; and &quot;Outstanding Programming Less Than One Hour&quot;.

==Early life==
Stone was born in [[Houston]], [[Texas]] to Gerald Whitney Stone, Jr. (1941-2010), an [[economics]] professor and textbook author, and Sheila Lois Belasco (who share the first names of ''South Park'' character [[Kyle Broflovski]]'s parents). Stone's mother is [[Judaism|Jewish]] and his father was of [[Irish people|Irish]] descent.&lt;ref name=kyle&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.jewishaz.com/jewishnews/980522/kyle.shtml |title = Who is Kyle Broslofski? |accessdate = 2009-01-03 |author = Raphael, Rebecca |publisher = Jewish News of Greater Phoenix }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and his younger sister, Rachel were raised in [[Littleton, Colorado]], a suburb of [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], where both attended [[Heritage High School (Littleton, Colorado)|Heritage High School]]. He graduated from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], and was their first student to double major in film and mathematics.&lt;ref name=&quot;degree&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.colorado.edu/FilmStudies/alumni/index.shtml |title = University of Colorado, Boulder - Alumni |accessdate = 2009-05-25 |publisher = University of Colorado, Boulder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Park===
In 1992, Stone and Parker created ''[[The Spirit of Christmas (short film)|Jesus vs. Frosty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/Treats/SOC1script.htm |title = The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Frosty |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; It included four boys, two resembling [[Stan Marsh]] and [[Kyle Broflovski]], one called Kenny who looked like [[Eric Cartman|Cartman]], and a fourth unnamed boy who looked like [[Kenny McCormick|Kenny]]. Both ''Jesus'' and ''[[Cannibal! The Musical]]'' were made while they were students at the University of Colorado film school, studying under both [[Stan Brakhage]] and Jerry Aronson. After the duo released ''Cannibal! The Musical'', they were asked to make another animated short.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vh1.com/press/bios/brian_graden.jhtml VH1 Press | BRIAN GRADEN's Bio&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.notablebiographies.com/news/Ge-La/Graden-Brian.html Brian Graden Biography - life, family, childhood, children, death, history, wife, school, young&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; They came down to two ideas: one a sequel to ''Jesus vs. Frosty'', and one about a character that would later be recurring in ''South Park'', Mr. Hankey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/SPinfo/SPTimeline1990s.htm |title = The South Park Timeline |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; They chose to write about the four boys, and their decision ultimately opened the door for them to present a show (''South Park'') to Comedy Central.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spscriptorium.com/Treats/SOC2script.htm |title = The Spirit of Christmas: Jesus vs. Santa |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spscriptorium.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stone and Parker produced 13 episodes for season 1.&lt;ref&gt;[[South Park]]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1999, Stone and Parker made ''[[South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut]]'', which gave the series prominence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbfc.co.uk/website/Classified.nsf/0/6E0862C5BA46199D802567A700246877 |title = South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = bbfc.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film's music was nominated for an Academy Award, but lost to &quot;[[You'll Be In My Heart]]&quot; from [[Tarzan (1999 film)|Tarzan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158983/awards South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut (1999) - Awards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===
In 1997, they also released ''[[Orgazmo]]'', a movie rated NC-17. In 1998, they starred in (but did not write or direct) ''[[BASEketball]]'', another feature film, while being renewed for a second season of ''South Park''.  In 2001, the duo announced they would do 39 shorts between the lengths of 2 and 5 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spschat.com/Shocked/Princess.htm Princess&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although originally thought to be ''South Park''-related, they decided they would do something different. The result was the shorts '[[Princess (Flash series)|Princess]]'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.spschat.com/Shocked/Princess.htm |title = Princess |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = spschat.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The content was so extreme that it was cancelled after two shows aired.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spscriptorium.com/SPinfo/SPStudiosFAQ12.htm]{{Dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, they also created ''[[That's My Bush!]]'', another television series. Despite great reviews, the show was cancelled after one season for its cost, reportedly $700,000 per episode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/139357-That_s_My_Bush_canceled.php That's My Bush! canceled - 2001-08-02 09:08:00 | Broadcasting &amp; Cable&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2004, they made a film titled ''[[Team America: World Police]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.movieweb.com/news/NEc4pjfcrGTdfd |title = Trey Parker and Matt Stone talk Team America: World Police |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = movieweb.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2005/01/13/matt_stone_team_america_interview.shtml |title = Interview with Matt Stone |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = BBC Movies }}&lt;/ref&gt; which many critics reviewed positively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/team_america_world_police/ Team America: World Police Movie Reviews, Pictures - Rotten Tomatoes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2007, South Park was renewed for three more seasons, 13, 14 and 15, each of them containing 14 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tv.ign.com/articles/816/816143p1.html South Park Gets Three More Seasons]&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone is also a member of the band [[DVDA (band)|DVDA]] with Parker, for which he plays bass and drums. DVDA's songs have appeared in many of the duo's productions, including ''Orgazmo'', ''BASEketball'', ''South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut'', and ''Team America: World Police''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0158983/soundtrack |title = Soundtracks for South Park: Bigger Longer &amp; Uncut |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = Internet Movie Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124819/soundtrack|title = Soundtracks for Orgazmo |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = Internet Movie Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124819/soundtrack|title = Soundtracks for BASEketball |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = Internet Movie Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0372588/soundtrack |title = Soundtracks for Team America: World Police |accessdate = 2009-01-04 |publisher = Internet Movie Database }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 28, 2007, Parker and Stone acquired the US rights to the Canadian-made ''[[Kenny vs. Spenny]]'', which premiered November 14, 2007 on Comedy Central with ten old and new episodes.&lt;ref name=&quot;kenny&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cbc.ca/arts/tv/story/2007/09/28/kenny-spenny-comedy.html |title = Cdn. show hits Comedy Central thanks to South Park creators |accessdate = 2009-01-03 |author = Associated Press |publisher = cbcnews.ca | date=2007-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stone and Parker collaborated with ''[[Avenue Q]]'' composer [[Robert Lopez]] on a musical about [[Mormons]] titled ''[[The Book of Mormon (musical)|The Book of Mormon]]'', which stars Andrew Rannells, Josh Gad, Nikki M. James and [[Rory O'Malley]]. It opened at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre on March 24, 2011, and is being produced by Scott Rudin and Anne Garefino.  It is directed by Parker and Casey Nicholaw, and choreographed by Nicholaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news  | last = Adams  | first = Guy  | title = Mormons to get 'South Park' treatment  | newspaper = Independent  | date = 2008-11-19  | url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/mormons-to-get-south-park-treatment-1024598.html | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Stone and Parker received a &quot;warning&quot; for allegedly representing the [[Muslim]] prophet [[Muhammad]] in a bear costume: &quot;We have to warn Matt and Trey that what they are doing is stupid and they will probably wind up like [[Netherlands|Dutch]] director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] for airing this show.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chicago Tribune - WWPMD&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsblogs.chicagotribune.com/religion_theseeker/2010/04/hesham-hassaballa-author-of-the-blog-god-faith-and-a-pen----i-must-admit-i-was-offended-i-was-really-bothered-by-t.html|title=Hesham Hassaballa: What would Prophet Muhammad do? |last=Hassaballa|first=Hesham|date=2010-04-26|publisher=Chicago Tribue|accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was revealed in the next episode that the person in the bear costume was actually [[Santa Claus]] and not Muhammad; the &quot;real&quot; Muhammad was supposed to appear as well, but Comedy Central had him censored out against Stone and Parker's wishes.

Stone claimed that he and Parker were on [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|acid]] at the time of the [[72nd Academy Awards]] in 2000, where they wore dresses popularized by [[Jennifer Lopez]] and [[Gwyneth Paltrow]] at previous awards shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;inter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url = http://movies.ign.com/articles/612/612094p1.html |title = Interview: Trey Parker and Matt Stone |accessdate = 2009-01-03 |author = Otto, Jeff |publisher = IGN }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 2008, Stone married Angela Howard. He has one son.&lt;ref name=LatterSaints&gt;Swanson, Carl. [http://nymag.com/arts/theater/features/south-park-2011-3/index1.html &quot;Latter-Day Saints&quot;], ''[[New York Magazine]]'', March 6, 2011, Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NNDB&gt;[http://www.nndb.com/people/590/000024518/ Matt Stone], NNDB, accessed April 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding religion, Stone considers himself &quot;[[Who is a Jew?#Ethnic and cultural perspectives|ethnically Jewish]]&quot;, on account of his mother's descent, but grew up agnostic, and has no other adherence to the religion,&lt;ref name=kyle/&gt;&lt;ref name=NNDB/&gt; identifying himself as an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name=Nightline/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYMag/&gt;
