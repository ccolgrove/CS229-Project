After &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; became a hit in London various other productions were put on around the world.  One of the earliest was in Australia.  The cast came from around [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

To help promote this production, a special version of the British musical soundtrack was released to help protmote the production.  This edition is noteworthy for having new album artwork and the inclusion of a new recording of [[Another One Bites The Dust]] by [[Queen (band)|Queen]] featuring as vocalist [[Annie Crummer]] who played the part of Killer Queen.

This recording was to later receive a single release in New Zealand.
