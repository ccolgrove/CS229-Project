'''''Inglourious Basterds''''' is a 2009 war film written and directed by [[Quentin Tarantino]] and starring [[Brad Pitt]], [[Christoph Waltz]] and [[MÃ©lanie Laurent]]. The film tells the fictional story of two plots to assassinate the [[Nazi Germany]] political leadership, one planned by a young French [[Jewish]] cinema proprietor (Laurent), and the other by a team of Jewish Allied soldiers led by First Lieutenant Aldo Raine (Pitt).

Development on ''Inglourious Basterds'' began in 1998, when Tarantino wrote the script for the film. Tarantino struggled with the ending and chose to hold off filming and moved on to direct the two-part film ''[[Kill Bill]]''. After directing ''[[Death Proof]]'' in 2007 (as part of the double feature ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]''), Tarantino returned to work on ''Inglourious Basterds''. The film went into production in October 2008 and was filmed in Germany and France with a production budget of $70 million. ''Inglourious Basterds'' premiered on May 20, 2009 at the [[2009 Cannes Film Festival|62nd Cannes Film Festival]], where it competed for the [[Palme d'Or]]. It was widely released in theaters in the United States and Europe in August 2009 by [[The Weinstein Company]] and [[Universal Studios]].

The film was successful at the [[box office]], grossing $320,351,773 in theaters worldwide, making it Tarantino's highest-grossing film to date. It received multiple awards and nominations, including eight [[82nd Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations. For his role as [[Hans Landa]], [[Christoph Waltz]] won the [[Best Actor Award (Cannes Film Festival)|Best Actor Award]] at the Cannes Film Festival, as well as the [[BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor|BAFTA Award]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor - Motion Picture|Golden Globe]] and the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

== Plot == &lt;!-- PER [[WP:FILMPLOT]] THIS SHOULD BE A SUMMARY ONLY --&gt;
In 1941, [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] Colonel [[Hans Landa]] ([[Christoph Waltz]]) arrives at a dairy farm in France to interrogate Perrier Lapadite ([[Denis Menochet]]) about rumors that he is hiding the Jewish Dreyfus family. Landa pressures the farmer to confess to hiding the family underneath his floor. Landa then orders the SS soldiers into the house to shoot through the floorboards where they are hiding. The entire family is killed, except the teenage Shosanna ([[MÃ©lanie Laurent]]), whom Landa allows to escape.

In the spring of 1944, [[1st Special Service Force]] &lt;!--if you look closely, you can see the 1 SSF Devil's Brigade Red Arrowhead shoulder patch on Raine's uniform--&gt;First Lieutenant Aldo Raine ([[Brad Pitt]]) is tasked to recruit a team of eight Jewish-American soldiers for a mission to go behind enemy lines and bring fear to all German servicemen. He tells the soldiers that they each owe him one hundred Nazi [[scalping|scalps]]. They operate with a &quot;take no prisoners&quot; attitude and come to be known as the &quot;Basterds&quot;. One survivor of an attack by the Basterds, a soldier named Butz ([[SÃ¶nke MÃ¶hring]]), is interviewed by [[Adolf Hitler]] ([[Martin Wuttke]]). Butz's account of the attack is shown in [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]: his squad was ambushed and his sergeant (Richard Sammel) was beaten to death with a baseball bat by Staff Sergeant Donny Donowitz ([[Eli Roth]]), known by the Germans as &quot;The Bear Jew&quot;. Butz then reveals that Raine carved a [[swastika]] into his forehead with a knife.

In June 1944, Shosanna has assumed a new identity as &quot;Emmanuelle Mimieux&quot; and is operating a cinema in [[Paris]]. She meets Fredrick Zoller ([[Daniel BrÃ¼hl]]), a German sniper whose exploits are to be celebrated in a Nazi [[propaganda film]], ''Stolz der Nation'' (''Nation's Pride''). Zoller is attracted to Shosanna and convinces [[Joseph Goebbels]] ([[Sylvester Groth]]) to hold the premiere of his film at Shosanna's cinema. Shosanna realizes that the presence of several high-ranking Nazi officials provides an opportunity for revenge and resolves to burn down the cinema during the premiere by setting fire to a large quantity of extremely flammable [[nitrate film]]. 

A British General, General Ed Fenech ([[Mike Myers]]) learns of the premiere and &quot;Operation Kino&quot; is conceived, and Lieutenant Archie Hicox ([[Michael Fassbender]]) is recruited to infiltrate the event, aided by the Basterds and German film actress and British spy, Bridget von Hammersmark ([[Diane Kruger]]). Hicox and two of the German-born Basterds (namely, the deadly Hugo Stiglitz ([[Til Schweiger]]) meet with von Hammersmark at a tavern where Major Dieter Hellstrom ([[August Diehl]]), of the [[Gestapo]], notices Hicox's odd accent and that he gives the wrong (non-German) three-fingered order for drinks; three fingers up instead of two fingers and the thumb. This results in a firefight and a standoff with a German serviceman, Staff Sgt. Wilhelm ([[Alexander Fehling]]), leaving everyone dead except von Hammersmark. Raine interrogates von Hammersmark, and upon learning that Hitler will be attending the premiere, devises a plan whereby he, Donny, and Omar ([[Omar Doom]]) will pose as von Hammersmark's Italian escorts at the premiere. Landa later investigates the tavern, retrieving von Hammersmark's shoe and an autographed napkin.

At the premiere, Landa asks to see von Hammersmark privately, where he makes her try on the shoe. Convinced to his satisfaction that she is in league with the Basterds, he suddenly strangles her to death. He then orders Raine and Utivich ([[B. J. Novak]]) to be arrested. Communicating by radio, Landa makes a deal with Raine's commanding officer ([[Harvey Keitel]]) to be granted a full military pension and American citizenship, in exchange for allowing Donny and Omarâstill seated in the cinemaâto kill the Nazi high command. During the film, Zoller goes to the projection room to see Shosanna and confronts her angrily due to her multiple rejections of his advances from the beginning. When his back is turned, she shoots him multiple times, but he manages to shoot her dead before succumbing to his wounds. The film is then interrupted by an inserted close-up of Shosanna informing the audience that they are going to be killed by a Jew. At the same time, Shosanna's employee and lover, Marcel ([[Jacky Ido]]), who has locked and bolted all the exits of the cinema, ignites the nitrate film stacked behind the screen. Omar and Donowitz disguise themselves as waiters and kill the soldiers guarding Hitler with [[Sedgley OSS .38|hidden pistols]].  They then kill Goebbels and Hitler, and shoot into the crowd of panicking Nazis until the timers on their bombs go off and destroy the cinema, killing everyone inside.

Landa and his radio operator drive Raine and Utivich to the American lines, and according to the deal, Landa surrenders to Raine and hands over his weapons, allowing Utivich to handcuff him. To Landa's shock, Raine then shoots the radio operator and orders Utivich to scalp the dead man. Raine then carves a [[swastika]] into Landa's forehead, because he hates the idea of Landa just walking away without an indication of his crimes, proclaiming, &quot;You know something, Utivich? I think this just might be my masterpiece.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/film/filmblog/2009/aug/20/inglourious-basterds-tarantino-change-history|title=Inglourious Basterds Is Cinema's Revenge On Life|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited|accessdate=January 19, 2010 | location=London | first=David | last=Cox | date=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development and writing ===
Tarantino spent just over a decade writing the script for the film because, as he told [[Charlie Rose]] in an interview, he became &quot;too precious about the page,&quot; meaning the story kept growing and expanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/articles/7011717003|title=Quentin Tarantino Spends Decade Writing WWII Drama|work=[[All Headline News]]|publisher=AHN Media Corp|first=Jan|last=Westmark|date=July 24, 2008|accessdate=January 25, 2010&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nE4PF7W4|archivedate=February 1, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|url=http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/10567|people=Quentin Tarantino, Charlie Rose|title=An hour with Filmmaker Quentin Tarantino about his film 'Inglourious Basterds'|time=10.38|work=Charlie Rose|publisher=Charlie Rose LLC|format=FLV|date=August 21, 2009|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino viewed the script as his masterpiece in the making, so he felt it had to become the best thing he had ever written.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.movieweb.com/movie/FI3s3c65CkCR5c/RELc0RMQ2vHwPM|title=Inglourious Basterds: Review By WiseGuy|work=MovieWeb|publisher=Fandango|date=September 2009|accessdate=February 1, 2010&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nE4Ug611 |archivedate=February 1, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tarantino described an early premise of the film as his &quot;bunch-of-guys-on-a-mission film.

By 2002, Tarantino found ''Inglourious Basterds'' to be a bigger film than planned and saw that other directors were working on [[World War II]] films.&lt;ref name=beijing&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/05/movies/tarantino-behind-the-camera-in-beijing.html?pagewanted=all|title=Tarantino Behind the Camera in Beijing|work=[[The New York Times]]|publisher = [[The New York Times Company]]|first=Rick|last=Lyman|date=September 5, 2002|accessdate=January 26, 2010&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nE4gQg3G |archivedate=February 1, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, Tarantino had produced three nearly finished scripts, proclaiming that it was &quot;some of the best writing I've ever done.

In November 2004, Tarantino decided to hold off production of ''Inglourious Basterds'' and instead took an acting role in [[Takashi Miike]]'s [[spaghetti western]] film ''[[Sukiyaki Western Django]]'' and made a [[kung fu]] film entirely in [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/nov/02/china.film|title=Tarantino plans old-style kung fu film â in Mandarin|work=The Guardian|publisher=Guardian Media Group|first=Steve|last=Rose|date=November 12, 2004|accessdate=January 26, 2010&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nE4uVnT9 |archivedate=February 1, 2010 --&gt; | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This project foundered&lt;!-- Foundered is the correct term, please do not change it --&gt; as well, and he ultimately directed a part of the 2007 ''[[Grindhouse (film)|Grindhouse]]'' instead, before returning to work on ''Inglourious Basterds''.&lt;ref name=&quot;MTV&quot;/&gt; The title of the film was inspired by the English title of director [[Enzo G.

The film has met some criticism from [[Jewish]] press, as well. In ''Tablet'', Liel Liebowitz criticizes the film as lacking moral depth. He argues that the power of film lies in its ability to impart knowledge and subtle understanding, but ''Inglourious Basterds'' serves more as an &quot;alternative to reality, a magical and [[Manichean]] world where we needn't worry about the complexities of morality, where violence solves everything, and where the [[Third Reich]] is always just a film reel and a lit match away from cartoonish defeat&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tablet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tabletmag.com/arts-and-culture/14057/inglorious-indeed/|title=Inglorious Indeed|last=Leibovitz|first=Liel|date=August 21, 2009|work=[[Tablet Magazine]]|publisher=[[Nextbook]]|accessdate=September 9, 2009&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nFhtc4U4 |archivedate=February 2, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony Frosh, writer for the online magazine ''Galus Australis'', has criticized the film for failing to develop its characters sufficiently, labeling the film &quot;Enthralling, but lacking in Jewish content&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://galusaustralis.com/2009/09/inglourious-basterds-enthralling-but-lacking-in-jewish-content/|title=Inglourious Basterds Enthralling But Lacking In Jewish Content|author=Frosh, Anthony|work=Galus Australis|date=September 29, 2009 | accessdate=January 19, 2010&lt;!-- |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5nFi1OnHE |archivedate=February 2, 2010 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
