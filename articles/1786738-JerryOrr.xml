Anderson won the 1972 [[Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting]] for his investigation on secret American policy decision-making between the [[United States]] and [[Pakistan]] during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. In addition to his newspaper career, Anderson also had a syndicated radio show with the [[Mutual Broadcasting System|Mutual Broadcasting Network]], acted as Washington bureau chief of ''[[Parade (magazine)|Parade Magazine]]'', and was a commentator on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]-TV's ''[[Good Morning America]]'' for nine years.&lt;ref name=GWU&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/gelman/spec/ead/ms2001.html Jack Anderson Papers Finding Aid], Special Collections Research Center, Estelle and Melvin Gelman Library, The George Washington University&lt;/ref&gt;

Jack Anderson was a key and often controversial figure in reporting on [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s apparent ties to the [[American Mafia|Mafia]], the [[Watergate scandal]], and the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]].&lt;ref name=BangorDailyNews1973-10-23&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
He also broke open the investigation and harassment by the Nixon administration of [[John Lennon]] during the fight to deport Lennon, the search for fugitive ex-[[Nazism|Nazi]] officials in South America and the [[savings and loan crisis]]. He discovered a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] plot to [[assassination|assassinate]] [[Fidel Castro]],&lt;ref name=spartacus&gt;[http://www.spartacus.schoolnet.co.uk/USAandersonJ.htm SchoolNet.co.uk] - 'Jack Anderson' (biography)&lt;/ref&gt; and was credited for breaking the [[IranâContra affair]], though he has said the scoop was &quot;spiked&quot; because he had become too close to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Ronald Reagan]].

Anderson was diagnosed with [[Parkinson's disease]] in 1986. In July 2004, at the age of 81, Anderson retired from his syndicated column, &quot;Washington Merry-Go-Round.&quot; He died of complications from Parkinson's disease, survived by his wife, Olivia, and nine children.

A few months after his death, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] attempted to gain access to his files as part of the [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee|AIPAC]] case on the grounds that the information could hurt U.S. government interests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/26/1438241 Democracy Now!] FBI Seeks to Seize Control of Files of Deceased Investigative Journalist Jack Anderson (April 26, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Anderson was born in [[Long Beach, California]], to Orlando and Agnes Mortensen Anderson, devout [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormons]] of [[Swedish people|Swedish]]-[[Danish people|Danish]] descent. He grew up in [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], and served two years as a [[Missionary (LDS Church)|Mormon missionary]] in the church's Southern States [[Mission (LDS Church)|Mission]].&lt;ref name=spartacus/&gt; Anderson's aptitude for journalism appeared at the early age of 12 when he began writing the Boy Scouts Column for ''The Deseret News.'' His writing career began at his local newspaper, ''The [[The Green Sheet|Murray Eagle]]''. Anderson also edited his high school newspaper, ''The Granitian''. He joined ''[[The Salt Lake Tribune]]'' in 1940, where his [[Muckraker|muckraking]] exploits included infiltrating [[Mormon fundamentalism|polygamous Mormon fundamentalist sects]]. He served in the [[United States Armed Forces|U.S. Armed Forces]] during [[World War II]] in [[People's Republic of China|China]], where he reportedly fought the [[Imperial Japanese Army|Japanese]] alongside Chinese [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and worked on the [[Shanghai]] edition of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''.

After a stint as a [[war correspondent]] during 1945, he was hired by [[Drew Pearson (journalist)|Drew Pearson]] for the staff of his column, the &quot;Merry-Go-Round,&quot; which Anderson took over after Pearson's death in 1969. In its heyday, Anderson's column was the most influential and widely read in the U.S.; published in nearly a thousand newspapers, he reached an audience of 40 million.&lt;ref name=spartacus/&gt;

He co-founded [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] with [[J. Peter Grace]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1985/102885a.htm | title = Remarks on Receiving the Final Report of the President's Private Sector Survey on Cost Control in the Federal Government | publisher = President Ronald Reagan Speech October 28, 1985 | accessdate = April 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Muckraker==
Anderson feuded with [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] chief [[J. Edgar Hoover]] in the 1950s, when he exposed the scope of the Mafia, a threat that Hoover had long downplayed. Hoover's retaliation and continual harassment lasted into the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;http://shop.history.com/detail.php?p=67496&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover once described Anderson as &quot;lower than the regurgitated filth of vultures.&quot;&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson told his staff, &quot;Let's do to Hoover what he does to others.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicalquotes.org/Quotedisplay.aspx?DocID=11550 Eigen's Political &amp; Historical Quotations]&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson had his people go through Hoover's garbage, which is the kind of thing FBI people used to do. Anderson's investigations were a tipping point in the attitude of the public and the press towards Hoover. Prior to Anderson's exposÃ©s few people of stature had dared to publicly criticize Hoover. After Anderson, many followed suit, and the man who had been the public persona of exemplary law enforcement became exposed for his failures and dubious activities in the areas of organized crime and civil rights, many of which were of questionable legality.

Anderson grew close to [[Joseph McCarthy]], and the two exchanged information from sources,&lt;ref name=spartacus/&gt; but when Pearson went after McCarthy, Anderson reluctantly followed at first, then actively assisted with the eventual downfall of his one-time friend.

In the mid-1960s, Anderson exposed the corruption of Senator [[Thomas J. Dodd]] and unearthed a memo by an [[ITT Corporation|ITT]] executive admitting the company paid off [[Richard Nixon]]'s campaign to stymie [[Competition law|anti-trust]] prosecution. His reporting on Nixon-ITT corruption earned him a place on the [[Master list of Nixon's political opponents]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crimemagazine.com/jack_anderson.htm Jack Anderson - Crime Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

Anderson collaborated with Pearson on &quot;The Case Against Congress,&quot; published in 1969.&lt;ref name=spartacus/&gt;

According to the [[Family Jewels (Central Intelligence Agency)|family jewels]] documents, in 1971, during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|Indo-Pakistani War]], the director of the CIA, [[Richard Helms]], put Anderson under tap. Jack Anderson had written two articles on assassination attempts on Castro through [[John Roselli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wh1.pdf Memo of conversation], January 3, 1975, between President [[Gerald Ford]], [[William Colby]], etc., made available by the [[National Security Archive]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable topics that Anderson covered included organized crime, the Kennedy assassination, Chappaquiddick, Watergate, fugitive Nazis, the white supremacist group the Liberty Lobby and other far-right organizations, the death of Howard Hughes, the ABSCAM public corruption investigation, the investigation into fugitive financier Robert Vesco, the Iran-Contra scandal, and the activities of numerous Washington agencies, elected officials, and bureaucrats.&lt;ref name=GWU/&gt;

==Retractions==
In addition to his notable discoveries and breaking coverage, Anderson's reporting has included several mistakes and compelled retractions. Notably, during the 1972 presidential race, he accused Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee [[Thomas Eagleton]] of multiple drunk driving arrests. Anderson subsequently retracted the accusations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/18/AR2006041801943_pf.html &quot;Moving to the Right&quot;] by Howard Kurz 'The Washington Post' (April 19, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Targeted==
In 1972, Anderson was the target of an assassination plot in the White House. Two [[Richard Nixon|Nixon]] administration conspirators admitted under [[oath]] they plotted to [[poison]] Anderson on orders from a senior White House aide.&lt;ref&gt;Feldstein, Mark. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A19730-2004Jul27.html &quot;The Last Muckraker&quot;], ''The Washington Post'', July 28, 2004. Accessed April 2, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; White House &quot;plumbers&quot; [[G. Gordon Liddy]] and [[E. Howard Hunt]] met with a [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] operative to discuss the possibilities, including drugging Anderson with [[LSD]], poisoning his aspirin bottle, or staging a fatal [[robbery|mugging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was aborted when the plotters were arrested for the [[Watergate scandal|Watergate break-in]]. Nixon had long been angry with Anderson, blaming Anderson's election eve story about a secret loan from [[Howard Hughes]] to Nixon's brother&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/books/2000/0001.feldstein.html &quot;Getting the Scoop&quot; by Mark Feldstein&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; for Nixon's loss of the [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 presidential election]]. Anderson remained a target of FBI investigation after his death; in February 2006, the FBI contacted Anderson's family to obtain his files and search for classified documents.&lt;ref name=chronicle&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI agents claimed to be looking for documents pertaining to [[American Israel Public Affairs Committee]] (AIPAC) as part of an espionage investigation. In November 2006, the FBI quietly gave up its pursuit of the archive. The archive, as revealed in ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', contains Anderson's CIA file, along with information about prominent public figures such as Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, Thomas Dodd, and J. Edgar Hoover.&lt;ref name=chronicle2&gt;{{Cite journal

==Stunt to demonstrate lack of Capitol security==
To demonstrate the threat of terrorism within the U.S. Capitol, in 1989, Anderson brought a gun to an interview in the office of then [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|Senate minority leader]] [[Bob Dole]]. This led to a reprimand and a change of rules for reporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DEEDA163BF934A15755C0A96F948260 | work=The New York Times | title=Reporter Reprimanded In Capitol Gun Incident | date=June 27, 1989 | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legmen and Alumni==
Anderson had a staff of legmen on his payroll, who earned little but gained valuable experience. Among Anderson's legmenâreporters who actually went out into the field and gathered the information, forwarding it on to writers such as Andersonâwas [[Brit Hume]], later a reporter for [[ABC News]] and Washington managing editor for [[Fox News Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/18/AR2006041801943.html Moving to the Right] ''Washington Post'', April 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
