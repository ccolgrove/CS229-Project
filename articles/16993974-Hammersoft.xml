The '''Citrus Series''' is the name given to the [[Interleague Play|interleague]] series between the [[Miami Marlins]] and [[Tampa Bay Rays]] in [[Major League Baseball]]. The Marlins broke into the league in {{mlby|1993}} as the ''Florida Marlins'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://miami.marlins.mlb.com/mia/history/index.jsp Marlins History]&lt;/ref&gt; while the Rays had their first season in {{mlby|1998}} as the ''Tampa Bay Devil Rays''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tampabay.rays.mlb.com/tb/history/index.jsp Rays History]&lt;/ref&gt; The first meeting between the two teams took place on June 22, 1998 at [[Tropicana Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida|St. Petersburg]], [[Florida]] during the Rays' inaugural season. Beginning with the {{mlby|2012}} season, when the Marlins are the home team, games will be played at [[Miami Ballpark]]. From {{mlby|1998}} to {{mlby|2010}}, the games were played at [[Sun Life Stadium]] (as it is currently named), though it has been known by several names in its existence.

Currently, because the Marlins play in the [[National League]], and the Rays in the [[American League]], the only possible postseason matchup the teams can have is in the [[World Series]], though this has never happened as the two teams have yet to appear in the same postseason. Both teams have had appearances in the Fall Classic, however. The Marlins have won both of their World Series appearances in [[1997 World Series|1997]] and [[2003 World Series|2003]], while the Rays have lost their only appearance in [[2008 World Series|2008]].

Rays manager [[Joe Maddon]] said he does not consider the Citrus Series a true rivalry. &quot;I really don't honestly believe the fans see it as being a rivalry, I really don't. The best way to get that done is to include us in the same league or the same division. That might stir something up.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110618&amp;content_id=20684166&amp;notebook_id=20684170&amp;vkey=notebook_tb&amp;c_id=tb&amp;partnerId=rss_tb|title=Rays don't view Citrus Series as rivalry|last=Chiang|first=Anthony|date=June 19, 2011|work=MLB.com|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.tbo.com/news/opinion/2011/jun/19/4/spnewso1-some-rivalry-citrus-series-has-become-ar-238465|title=Some rivalry Citrus Series has become|last=Fennelly|first=Martin|date=June 19, 2011|work=[[Tampa Tribune]]|accessdate=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
