'''Darius Rucker''' (born May 13, 1966) is an [[United States|American]] musician. He first gained fame as the [[lead singer]] and [[rhythm guitar]]ist of the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Hootie &amp; the Blowfish]], which he founded in 1986 at the [[University of South Carolina]] along with [[Mark Bryan]], [[Jim Sonefeld|Jim &quot;Soni&quot; Sonefeld]] and Dean Felber. The band has released five studio albums with him as a member, and charted six top 40 hits on the [[Billboard Hot 100]]. Rucker co-wrote the majority of the band's songs with the other three members.

He released a solo [[R&amp;B]] album, ''[[Back to Then]]'', in 2002 on [[Hidden Beach Recordings]] but did not chart any singles from it. Six years later, Rucker signed to [[Capitol Records]] Nashville as a [[country music]] artist, releasing the album ''[[Learn to Live]]'' that year. Its first single, &quot;[[Don't Think I Don't Think About It]]&quot;, made him the first African American to chart a number one on the [[Hot Country Songs]] charts since [[Charley Pride]] in 1983. It was followed by two more number-one singles, &quot;[[It Won't Be Like This for Long]]&quot; and &quot;[[Alright (Darius Rucker song)|Alright]]&quot; and the number three &quot;[[History in the Making]]&quot;. In 2009, he became the first African American to win the New Artist Award from the [[Country Music Association]], and only the second African American to win any award from the association. A second Capitol album, ''[[Charleston, SC 1966]]'', was released on October 12, 2010. The album includes the number-one singles &quot;[[Come Back Song]]&quot; and &quot;[[This (Darius Rucker song)|This]]&quot;.

==Early life==
Darius Rucker was born and raised in Charleston, South Carolina, where his family history goes back generations.&lt;ref name=Puterbaugh&gt;Puterbaugh, Parke (June 15, 1995), &quot;Fish out of water&quot;. ''Rolling Stone''. (710):74&lt;/ref&gt; His single mother, Carolyn, who was a nurse, raised him with his five siblings: three sisters and two brothers.&lt;ref name=Gray&gt;Gray, Kevin; Dampier, Cindy (April 10, 1995), &quot;Fish out of water&quot;. ''People''. '''43''' (14):77&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rucker, his father was &quot;never around,&quot; and Rucker only saw him before church on Sundays.&lt;ref name=farley&gt;Farley, Christopher Joh; Thigpen, David E.. (April 29, 1996), &quot;Can 13 million Hootie fans really be wrong?&quot; Time, Vol. 147 Issue 18, p74&lt;/ref&gt; His father was in a gospel band called The Rolling Stones.&lt;ref name=farley/&gt; Rucker has said that he had a &quot;typical Southern, African-American upbringing.&quot;&lt;ref name=Puterbaugh/&gt; His family attended church every Sunday and was economically poor, and at one point, his mother, her two sisters, his grandmother and 14 children were all living in a three-bedroom home.&lt;ref name=Puterbaugh/&gt; Even so, he says that he looks back on his childhood &quot;with very fond memories.&quot;&lt;ref name=Puterbaugh/&gt; His sister, L'Corine, recalled that singing &quot;was always his dream&quot;.&lt;ref name=Puterbaugh/&gt;

==Hootie &amp; the Blowfish==
Rucker has been the lead singer of [[Hootie &amp; the Blowfish]] since its formation in 1986. He met fellow band members, [[Mark Bryan]], Jim &quot;Soni&quot; Sonefeld, and Dean Felber, while attending the [[University of South Carolina]]. Bryan heard Rucker singing in the shower, and the two became a duo, playing [[R.E.M.]] covers at a local venue.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; They later recruited Felber and finally Sonefeld joined in 1989.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; As a member of Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Rucker has recorded five studio albums: ''[[Cracked Rear View]]'', ''[[Fairweather Johnson]]'', ''[[Musical Chairs (Hootie &amp; the Blowfish album)|Musical Chairs]]'', ''[[Hootie &amp; the Blowfish (album)|Hootie &amp; the Blowfish]]'' and ''[[Looking for Lucky]]'', also charting within the top 40 of the [[Billboard Hot 100]] six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=hootie-the-blowfish-p44727/charts-awards/billboard-singles|pure_url=yes}}|title=Hootie &amp; the Blowfish chart history|work=Allmusic|accessdate=22 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All six albums feature songs that Rucker, Bryan and Felber wrote. As the frontman, Rucker began to be called simply &quot;Hootie&quot; in the media, though the band title combines the nicknames of his college friends.&lt;ref name=Gray/&gt;&lt;ref name=cohen&gt;Cohen, Rich (August 10, 1995), &quot;Southern comfort&quot;. ''Rolling Stone'' (714):42&lt;/ref&gt;

Rucker's signature contribution to the band is his baritone voice which ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' has called &quot;ingratiating,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;DeCurtis, Anthony; Wild, David (May 13, 1999), &quot;Rock + roll&quot;. ''Rolling Stone'' (812):60&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[TIME]]'' has called &quot;low, gruff, [and] charismatic,&quot;&lt;ref name=farley/&gt; and ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' has characterized as a &quot;barrelhouse growl.&quot;&lt;ref name=browne&gt;Browne, David (April 26, 96), &quot;`Fairweather' report&quot;. ''Entertainment Weekly'' (324):55&lt;/ref&gt; He has brought additional attention as the sole African-American member of a major rock band with otherwise white members. Rucker said they &quot;flipped&quot; the formula of the all black band with a white frontman, like [[Frank Sinatra]] performing with [[Count Basie]].&lt;ref name=cohen/&gt;  Musically, he has sometimes been criticized or spoofed for not being &quot;black enough&quot;.&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt;  ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' ran a sketch of Rucker leading beer-drinking, white [[Fraternities and sororities|fraternity]] members in a counter-march to [[Louis Farrakhan]]'s [[Million Man March]].&lt;ref name=farley/&gt;&lt;ref name=Balwin&gt;Baldwin, Kristen (November 3, 1995), &quot;The week&quot;. ''Entertainment Weekly''. (299):54&lt;/ref&gt; He also received death threats for singing the Hootie song &quot;Drowning,&quot; a protest song against the flying of the [[Confederate flag]] above the South Carolina statehouse.&lt;ref name=farley/&gt; The other band members were protective of Rucker in regards to the issue, and had a policy of generally ignoring racist comments.&lt;ref name=Kennedy&gt;Kennedy, Dana; Estrine, Darryl (July 28, 1995), &quot;Hootie's revenge&quot;. ''Entertainment Weekly'' (285):32&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after gaining a measure of fame, Felber and Rucker (who consider themselves best friends) moved into an apartment in [[Columbia, South Carolina]].&lt;ref name=Kennedy/&gt; With Rucker's recognition as the frontman of a successful band came increased opportunities. In October 1995, Rucker was asked to sing the national anthem at the [[World Series]].&lt;ref name=Balwin/&gt; Frank Sinatra invited Rucker to sing at his 80th birthday party; Rucker sang &quot;[[The Lady Is a Tramp]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Lisa; Ramsay, Carolyn (December 4, 1995), &quot;Frankly admiring&quot;.. ''People''. '''44''' (23):85&lt;/ref&gt;  That same week, he made a voice cameo in an episode of the sitcom ''[[Friends (TV series)|Friends]]''.&lt;ref name=Balwin/&gt;  He also joined [[Nanci Griffith]] on the song &quot;Gulf Coast Highway&quot; from her 1997 album ''[[Blue Roses from the Moons]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Stambler, Lyndon (June 2, 1997), &quot;Blue Roses from the Moons&quot;. ''People''., '''47''' (21):32&lt;/ref&gt; and sang backing vocals on [[Radney Foster]]'s 1999 album ''[[See What You Want to See]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=See What You Want to See |bandname=Radney Foster |year=1998 |format=CD insert |publisher=[[Arista Records]] |publisherid= 18833}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rucker encouraged [[Atlantic Records]] to agree to a deal with [[Edwin McCain]], and made a guest appearance on McCain's debut album, [[Honor Among Thieves (album)|''Honor Among Thieves'']].&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, Tiarra; Murphy, Maggie (April 19, 1996), &quot;Give a Hootie&quot;. ''Entertainment Weekly''. (323):10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solo career==
In 2001, he made his solo [[R&amp;B]] debut album, ''The Return of Mongo Slade'', for Atlantic Records. Because of contractual changes, it was never released by the label.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=darius-rucker-p227711/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=Darius Rucker biography |accessdate=2008-05-07 |last=Wilson |first=MacKenzie |work=[[Allmusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hidden Beach Recordings]], an independent label, acquired the masters from Atlantic and released the album as ''[[Back to Then]]'' in July 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic&quot;/&gt; The album included work from the production team of [[Jill Scott]] and she made an appearance on the track &quot;Hold On.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Chuck (August 12, 2002), &quot;Back to Then (Music recording)&quot;.

'''56''' (5):54&lt;/ref&gt; He also portrayed a [[singing cowboy]] in a television commercial for the fast food chain [[Burger King]], promoting their [[TenderCrisp]] Bacon Cheddar Ranch sandwich in 2005. In the commercial, he sang a jingle set to the tune of &quot;[[Big Rock Candy Mountain]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://advertising.about.com/b/2005/03/07/yes-thats-hootie-crooning-for-burger-king.htm |title=Yes, that's Hootie crooning for Burger King |accessdate=2008-06-10 |last=Duncan |first=Apryl |date=2005-03-07 |work=[[About.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rucker's entry into the country world was met with some intrigue, largely because of his history as a rock musician and because he is African-American.  ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' magazine said that &quot;there's a sense of purpose that makes Rucker feel like a member of the country family, rather than calculating interloper.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Price, Deborah Evans (June 28, 2008), &quot;Don't Think I Don't Think About It&quot;.

'''120''' (26):64&lt;/ref&gt; Rucker made visits to various country stations around the US, explaining that he was aware that he was the &quot;new kid on the block.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Ken (September 27, 2008), &quot;New Kid On The Block&quot;. ''Billboard''. '''120''' (39):48&lt;/ref&gt;  Mike Culotta, the program director of the [[Tampa, Florida]] radio station [[WQYK-FM]] expected that Rucker would be &quot;somebody who would have entitlement,&quot; but instead said that &quot;Darius engaged everybody.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;No byline (September 23, 2008), &quot;Hootie's Rucker tops country chart&quot;.
