'''BitDefender''' is an [[antivirus software]] suite developed by [[Romania]]-based software company [[Softwin]]. It was launched in November 2001,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=BitDefender Product History |url=http://www.bitdefender.co.uk/site/Main/view/product-history.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently in its 15 build version. The 2011 version was launched in August 2010, and it includes several protection and performance enhancements as Search Advisor and Performance Optimizer.
The 2012 version was launched in 27 July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/BitDefender-Total-Security-2011-Review-152224.shtml |title='&amp;#39;BitDefender Total Security 2011'&amp;#39; |publisher=Softpedia.com |date=2010-08-15 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The BitDefender products feature antivirus and antispyware, personal firewall, privacy control, user control and backup for corporate and home users. PC Tuneup and Performance Optimizer are available in the Total Security Suite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitdefender.com/site/view/antivirus-comparison.html |title='&amp;#39;Product Comparison Chart'&amp;#39; |publisher=Bitdefender.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:BitDefender logo.svg|thumb|left|200px|BitDefender logo used until 2011.]]
BitDefender replaced SOFTWIN's earlier AVX &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by Softwin SRL, avx@softwin.ro |url=http://www.securityfocus.com/comments/tools/1653/9518/threaded |title=Antivirus eXpert |publisher=Securityfocus.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (AntiVirus eXpert) product range. Between 1996 and 2001 AVX became a product available worldwide that offered  intelligent updating without user intervention and integrated an internal browser which scanned  and monitored all downloaded files. AVX hold the first behavior- based application blocking technology and it was the first antivirus product to include personal firewall features. With the sixth generation of AVX, the product became the first antivirus to include an application firewall as well as behavior- based blocking. The BitDefender group spun off from SOFTWIN in 2007.

==BitDefender products==

The BitDefender range includes antivirus products for home users and businesses. Home editions support [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Symbian OS]], [[Windows Mobile]] and [[Mac OS X]]; business editions support Microsoft Windows, [[Linux]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Solaris]] and [[Mac OS X]]. The current version of the Home/Home Office security suite includes [[antivirus software|antivirus]], [[anti-spyware]], [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], [[e-mail spam]] filtering, [[backup]], [[tune-up]] and [[parental control]] components.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PC Advisor Review - BitDefender 10.0 |url=http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; A free basic online scan is offered via the BitDefender website. The Free version however does require free registration and is valid for 1 year after registration.

BitDefender is designed to protect computers from viruses and spyware.
Unlike the commercial version, the free tools only offer an on-demand virus scanning and doesn't provide real time scanning, and may therefore be less suitable for machines with a continuous connection to the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitdefender.com/PRODUCT-14-en--BitDefender-Free-Edition.html|title=BitDefender Free Version|accessdate = 2007-11-24|publisher = BitDefender}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BitDefender Technologies==
===BitDefender Antispam NeuNet===

BitDefender Antispam NeuNet,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zdnet.com.au/whitepaper/0,2000063328,22430400p-16001275q,00.htm?omnRef=http://www.google.ro/search?hl=ro&amp;q=&amp;omnRef=1337 ''BitDefender Antispam NeuNet'']&lt;/ref&gt; short for [[Neural Network]] is an [[antispam]] filter  pre-trained by the BitDefender Antispam Lab on a series of [[spam (electronic)|spam]] messages, so that it learns to recognize new spam by perceiving its similarities with the messages it has already examined.

===B-HAVE===

In May 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitdefender.com/site/Main/view/product-history.html |title='&amp;#39;Product History |publisher=Bitdefender.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; BitDefender introduced a new technology, '''B-HAVE''' (patent pending), to reduce dependency on virus signatures through proactive detection of unknown threats. This technology is based on behavioral analysis in a virtualized environment.

To determine whether a program is malicious or not, this technology makes use of a virtual PC in which files are executed and analyzed. The virtual PC includes a set of virtual hardware devices, mimicking the configuration of a typical PC.
B-HAVE checks for characteristics known to be associated with [[malware]]. A program may be deemed to be malicious if it attempts to modify certain files, read from or write to a sensitive area of the memory or create a file that is a product of a known virus. When attempting to use an un-trusted program, B-HAVE delays the launching until the programâs behavior and characteristics are analyzed and catalogued in the virtual environment. If no malicious actions are detected, B-HAVE starts the program normally; if a suspect conduct is present, B-HAVE automatically quarantines or deletes the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.security-int.com/categories/anti-malware-technology/bhave-the-road-to-success.asp |title='&amp;#39;B-HAVE â The Road To Success'&amp;#39; |publisher=Security-int.com |date=2010-04-27 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active Virus Control===

Incorporated in the 2010 product suites, BitDefender introduced another technology, '''Active Virus Control''', in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Download-BitDefender-2010-for-Windows-7-119431.shtml |title='&amp;#39;BitDefender 2010 for Windows 7'&amp;#39; |publisher=News.softpedia.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Active Virus Control continuously monitors each program &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.7tutorials.com/security-everyone-reviewing-bitdefender-internet-security-2010 |title='&amp;#39;Security for Everyone - Reviewing BitDefender Internet Security 2010'&amp;#39; |publisher=7tutorials.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (specific processes) running on the PC, as it executes, and it notes any malware-like actions.  Each of these actions is scored and when a given threshold is reached, the process is reported as harmful.
Unlike heuristic technologies that check executable files when they are accessed or first started, Active Virus Control monitors everything applications do as long as they are active. Because of this approach, Active Virus Control is considered a third layer of defense.

==Independent tests==

In reviews for BitDefender, the home version of the suite was given the [[PC Answers]] editor's choice award in a comparative review in May 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Group Test: AV Software |url=http://download.bitdefender.com/resources/files/Main/file/PCA171.GroupTest.pdf |work=[[PC Answers]] magazine |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |pages=118â125 |date=May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2007, BitDefender had passed [[Virus Bulletin]]'s VB100 independent tests 14 times out of 18 since first tested in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Virus Bulletin: VB100 Results - BitDefender (SOFTWIN) |url=http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/results?vendor=VE11}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also achieved an advanced certification from AV Comparatives for on-demand scanning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Virus Comparative February 2007 |url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/seiten/ergebnisse_2007_02.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; and standard level certification for catching unknown viruses, though it was criticised for its slower scanning speed and higher instances of [[false positive]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130904-page,1/article.html|title = BitDefender 10 review|publisher = [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The performance of BitDefender's heuristic antivirus technology was measured  using the detection rate of new and unknown viruses in a test conducted by Anti Malware Test.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anti-malware-test.com/?q=node/39 |title='&amp;#39;Key results from the proactive antivirus protection test'&amp;#39; |publisher=Anti-malware-test.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another test conducted by AV Comparatives in August 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.av-comparatives.org/images/stories/test/ondret/avc_report23.pdf |title=Anti-Virus Comparative August 2009 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to determine the antivirus software with high detection rates and the lowest false positives rating, BitDefender received an Advanced+ Certification. In a test conducted by PCMag, BitDefender 2010 , &quot;detected 97 percent of all the threats and completely blocked installation for most of them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubenking |first=Neil J. |url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2351562,00.asp |title='&amp;#39;PCMag BitDefender Total Security 2010'&amp;#39; |publisher=Pcmag.com |date=2009-08-17 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also the least expensive of the top three antivirus solutions, as ranked by [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,130869/article.html|title=Chart of top antivirus performers|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|date = 23 April 2007|accessdate = 2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Auslogic==
Auslogic sell a re-branded version of BitDefender 2010 under licence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advfn.com/news_BitDefender-and-Auslogics-Partner-to-Bundle-Award-Winning-Security-Software-With_40492684.html |title='&amp;#39;BitDefender and Auslogics Partner'&amp;#39; |publisher=Advfn.com |date=2009-11-24 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==

Although being criticized in May 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/164778/on_your_side_bitdefender_support_issues.html |title='&amp;#39;BitDefender support issues'&amp;#39; |publisher=Pcworld.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as being unresponsive, support is available 24/7 on telephone, e-mail, Livechat and a knowledge base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bitdefender.com/help |title=Support Center |publisher=Bitdefender.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trojan.FakeAlert.5 problem==

On March 20, 2010, computers running Bitdefender under 64 bit versions of Windows were affected by a malfunctioning update which classified every executable program as well as dll files as infected. These files were all marked as 'Trojan.FakeAlert.5' and were moved into quarantine. This action led to software and systems malfunctions that affected users around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bad BitDefender Update Clobbers Windows PCs |url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/192000/bad_bitdefender_update_clobbers_windows_pcs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

BitDefender representatives announced the removal of the faulty update and a workaround for the users affected,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Trojan.FakeAlert.5 Update issue|url=http://news.bitdefender.com/NW1431-en--Trojan.FakeAlert.5-Update-issue.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; except for those using the 2008 version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/software/news/2010/03/bitdefender-update-breaks-64-bit-windows-pcs.ars|title=BitDefender update breaks 64-bit Windows PCs|author=Peter Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Autodesks AutoCAD incompatibility==

[[Autodesk]]s [[AutoCAD]] 2007, AutoCAD 2008, AutoCAD 2009, AutoCAD 2010, AutoCAD 2011, AutoCAD Civil 3D 2010 and AutoCAD Civil 3D 2011 (may include previous versions of AutoCAD or AutoCAD Civil 3D also) users may experience significant crosshair (cursor) jerking and lag while BitDefender is installed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Cursor is slow or jerky |url=http://usa.autodesk.com/adsk/servlet/ps/dl/item?siteID=123112&amp;id=15127843&amp;linkID=9240617&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSSUP01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Disabling all or any BitDefender components does not correct the issue and to resolve it BitDefender must be uninstalled. Autodesk advises users to uninstall and remove BitDefender if the problem occurs and as of 2011 no fix has been issued by BitDefender.
