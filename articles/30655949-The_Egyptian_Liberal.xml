{{As of|2011|11}}, governments have been overthrown in three countries. Tunisian President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] fled to Saudi Arabia on 14 January following the [[Tunisian revolution]] protests. In Egypt, [[President of Egypt|President]] [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11 February 2011 after 18 days of massive protests, ending his 30-year presidency. The [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] was overthrown on 23 August 2011, after the [[National Transitional Council]] (NTC) took control of [[Bab al-Azizia]]. He was killed on 20 October 2011, in his hometown of [[Sirte]] after the NTC took control of the city.

During this period of regional unrest, several leaders announced their intentions to step down at the end of their current terms. [[Sudan]]ese President [[Omar al-Bashir]] announced that he would not seek re-election in 2015,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=417637&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=37&amp;parent_id=17|title=Party: Bashir is not standing for re-election|agency=Gulf Times|date=22 February 2011|accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as did [[Iraq]]i Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]], whose term ends in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://english.ruvr.ru/2011/02/05/43000042.html |title=Iraq PM plans no re-election|agency=Voice of Russia|date=5 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although there have been increasingly violent demonstrations demanding his immediate resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alsumaria.tv/en/Iraq-News/1-60907-.html|title=Iraq angered protesters call for Maliki resignation|agency=Alsumaria|date=26 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests in Jordan have also caused the sacking of two successive governments&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-01/30/c_13712927.htm|title=Jordanians stage anti-gov't sit-in in Amman|publisher=Xinhua|date=30 January 2011|accessdate=13 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazeera2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/10/20111017113326931126.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|date=17 October 2011|accessdate=17 October 2011|title=Jordan's king 'appoints new prime minister'}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Abdullah II of Jordan|King Abdullah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/01/jordan-government-idUSLDE7101C620110201|title=Jordan king appoints new PM, government quits|agency=Reuters |date=1 February 2011|accessdate=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another leader, President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]] of Yemen, announced on 23 April that he would step down within 30 days in exchange for immunity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/24/world/middleeast/24yemen.html?src=tptw|title=President of Yemen Offers to Resign for Immunity|work=The New York Times|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|first=Robert F.|last=Worth}}&lt;/ref&gt; a deal the Yemeni opposition informally accepted on 26 April;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704677404576285473691028908.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|agency=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|title=Yemen Protesters Accept Deal|first=Hakim|last=Almasmari}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saleh then reneged on the deal, prolonging the Yemeni uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-01/yemen-accord-signing-has-been-postponed-gulf-official-says-2-.html|date=2 May 2011|accessdate=5 May 2011|title=Yemen Accord Signing Has Been Postponed, Gulf Official Says|first=Donna|last=Abu-Nasr|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
===Motivations===
&lt;!-- [[File:Al Thoura.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Photo calling on a revolution in the Arab world]] Deleted picture. --&gt;

Numerous factors have led to the protests, including issues such as dictatorship or [[absolute monarchy]], [[human rights|human rights violations]], [[government corruption]] (demonstrated by [[United States diplomatic cables leak|Wikileaks diplomatic cables]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/cockburn02182011.html|title=The Tweet and Revolution|author=Alexander Cockburn|date=18â20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; economic decline, unemployment, extreme poverty, and a number of demographic structural factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=[[Korotayev]] A, Zinkina J |url=http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=276&amp;Itemid=70 |title=Egyptian Revolution: A Demographic Structural Analysis |journal=Entelequia.

Amnesty International hails WikiLeaks and Guardian as Arab spring 'catalysts']'', in ''[[The Guardian]]'', Friday 13 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent decades rising [[living standard]]s and [[literacy rate]]s, as well as the increased availability of higher education, have resulted in an improved [[human development index]] in the affected countries. The tension between rising aspirations and a lack of government reform may have been a contributing factor in all of the protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reverchon 03/13&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reverchon|first1=Antoine|last2=de Tricornot|first=Adrien|date=13 April 2011|title=La rente pÃ©troliÃ¨re ne garantit plus la paix sociale|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/economie/article/2011/03/14/la-rente-petroliere-ne-garantit-plus-la-paix-sociale_1492609_3234.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Maleki 02/09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Uprisings in the Region and Ignored Indicators|last=Maleki|first=Ammar|date=9 February 2011 |url=http://www.payvand.com/news/11/feb/1080.html|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Either remove it; or change its value to &quot;.&quot; for the cite to end in a &quot;.&quot;, as necessary. --&gt;{{inconsistent citations}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Internet-savvy youth of these countries have, increasingly over the years, been viewing autocrats and absolute monarchies as [[anachronism]]s. A university professor of [[Oman]], Al-Najma Zidjaly referred to this upheaval as [[youthquake (movement)|youthquake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Reverchon 03/13&quot; /&gt;

[[Tunisia]] and [[Egypt]], the first to witness major uprisings, differ from other North African and Middle Eastern nations such as [[Algeria]] and [[Libya]] in that they lack significant oil revenue, and were thus unable to make concessions to calm the masses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reverchon 03/13&quot; /&gt;

===Recent history===
The current wave of protests is not an entirely new phenomenon, resulting in part from the activities of dissident activists as well as members of a variety of social and union organizations that have been active for years in [[Tunisia]], Algeria, [[Egypt]], and other countries in the area, as well as in the territory of [[Western Sahara]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;Tunisia: the protests continue, http://www.marxist.com/tunisia-protests-continue.htm, 11 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunisia experienced a series of conflicts over the past three years, the most notable occurring in the mining area of [[Gafsa]] in 2008, where protests continued for many months. These protests included rallies, sit-ins, and strikes, during which there were two fatalities, an unspecified number of wounded, and dozens of arrests.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=NewsLibrary&amp;p_multi=BBAB&amp;d_place=BBAB&amp;p_theme=newslibrary2&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=122601958BA022A0&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Tunisian government faces growing dissent in mining region |publisher=NewsLibrary.com |date=4 August 2008 |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Egyptian labor movement had been strong for years, with more than 3,000 labor actions since 2004.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite web|url=http://detnews.com/article/20110210/OPINION01/102100341/Labor-movement-drives-Egypt--Tunisia-protests#ixzz1GDjIpaeg |title=Labor movement drives Egypt, Tunisia protests |publisher=The Detroit News |date=10 February 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; One important demonstration was an attempted workers' strike on 6 April 2008 at the state-run textile factories of [[al-Mahalla al-Kabra]], just outside [[Cairo]]. The idea for this type of demonstration spread throughout the country, promoted by computer-literate working class youths and their supporters among middle-class college students.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; A Facebook page, set up to promote the strike, attracted tens of thousands of followers. The government mobilized to break the strike through infiltration and riot police, and while the regime was somewhat successful in forestalling a strike, dissidents formed the &quot;6 April Committee&quot; of youths and labor activists, which became one of the major forces calling for the anti-[[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] demonstration on 25 January in [[Tahrir Square]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

In Algeria, discontent had been building for years over a number of issues. In February 2008, United States Ambassador Robert Ford wrote in a leaked diplomatic cable that Algeria is 'unhappy' with long-standing political alienation; that social discontent persisted throughout the country, with food strikes occurring almost every week; that there were demonstrations every day somewhere in the country; and that the Algerian government was corrupt and fragile.&lt;ref name=&quot;07ALGIERS1806&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Ford| first =Robert| title = An ailing and fragile Algerian regime drifts into 2008 | id={{cablegate|07ALGIERS1806}} | publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]| date=19 December 2007| url =http://wikileaks.ch/cable/2007/12/07ALGIERS1806.html | accessdate=4 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vWKgd8OS |archivedate=5 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have claimed that during 2010 there were as many as '9,700 riots and unrests' throughout the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;army_should_quit&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Lamine | last=Chikhi | title=Algeria army should quit politics: opposition | date=21 January 2011 | publisher=[[Thomson Reuters]] | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70K02X20110121?sp=true |accessdate=22 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vuh49u62 |archivedate=21 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many protests focused on issues such as education and health care, while others cited rampant corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mahmoud |last=Belhimer |url=http://carnegieendowment.org/arb/?fa=show&amp;article=40363 |title=Political Crises but Few Alternatives in Algeria |work=Arab Reform Bulletin |publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Western Sahara, the [[Gdeim Izik protest camp]] was erected 12&amp;nbsp;km south-east of [[El AaiÃºn]] by a group of young [[Sahrawis]] on 9 October 2010. Their intention was to demonstrate against labor discrimination, unemployment, looting of resources, and human rights abuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref-1&quot;&gt;[http://www.afrol.com/articles/36808 &quot;Mass exodus&quot; from Western Sahara cities]. [[Afrol News]], 21 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The camp contained between 12,000 and 20,000 inhabitants, but on 8 November 2010 it was destroyed and its inhabitants evicted by Moroccan security forces. The security forces faced strong opposition from some young Sahrawi civilians, and rioting soon spread to El AaiÃºn and other towns within the territory, resulting in an unknown number of injuries and deaths. Violence against Sahrawis in the aftermath of the protests was cited as a reason for [[2011 Sahrawi protests|renewed protests]] months later, after the start of the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://onthenews.org/saharawi-protests-violence-and-blackmail-moroccan/|agency=On the News|date=20 May 2011|accessdate=6 June 2011|title=Saharawi protests, violence and blackmail Moroccan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The catalyst for the current escalation of protests was the self-immolation of individuals such as [[Mohamed Bouazizi]], which brought together various groups dissatisfied with the existing system, including many unemployed, political and human rights activists, labor, trade unionists, students, professors, lawyers, and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; These groups have become an unprecedented movement that has built sufficient momentum to engender the current scope of events.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Following the self-immolation of [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] in [[Sidi Bouzid]], a series of increasingly violent street demonstrations through December 2010 ultimately led to the ouster of longtime [[President of Tunisia|President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] on 14 January 2011. The demonstrations were precipitated by high unemployment, [[food inflation]], corruption,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Richard |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/8258077/Tunisia-riots-US-warns-Middle-East-to-reform-or-be-overthrown.html |title=Tunisia riots: Reform or be overthrown, US tells Arab states amid fresh riots |publisher=Telegraph |date=13 January 2011|accessdate=14 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; lack of [[freedom of speech]] and other forms of [[political freedom]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ryan|first=Yasmine |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/20111614145839362.html |title=Tunisia's bitter cyberwar |publisher=Al Jazeera English |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and poor [[living conditions]].

Following Ben Ali's departure, a [[state of emergency]] was declared and a caretaker coalition government was created, which included members of Ben Ali's party, the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), as well as [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] figures from other ministries. However, the five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned almost immediately.&lt;ref name=&quot;threeministers&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title=Tunisia announces withdrawal of 3 ministers from unity gov't: TV | date=18 January 2011 | publisher=[[People's Daily Online]] | url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7264930.html |accessdate=20 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vrgMnytL |archivedate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_protests_21jan&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title= Protests hit Tunisia amid mourning | date=21 January 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011121104023232257.html |accessdate=21 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vuUSjc1C |archivedate=21 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of continued daily protests, on 27 January Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]] reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself, and on 6 February the former ruling party was suspended;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jnj3WjlEykmF6gcKD1M335EfPhLg?Id=6fd3d1660cf2420cb7cc0e7c579061fd |agency=The Associated Press|title=Tunisian minister suspends ex-ruling party |publisher=Google |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; later, on 9 March, it was dissolved.&lt;ref name=dissolution&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2011-03-09-Tunisia_N.htm |title=Tunisia disbands party of ousted president |newspaper=USA Today |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and [[Beji Caid el Sebsi]] became Prime Minister.

Following the uprising in Tunisia and prior to his entry as a central figure in Egyptian politics, potential [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|presidential candidate]] [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] warned of a 'Tunisia-style explosion' in Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/warning-egypt-could-follow-tunisia-20110119-19wly.html|title=Warning Egypt could follow Tunisia|author=Jack Shenker|location=Melbourne|work=The Age |location=Australia|date=20 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests in Egypt began on 25 January and ran for 18 days. Beginning around midnight on 28 January, the Egyptian government attempted, somewhat successfully, to eliminate the nation's Internet access, in order to inhibit the protesters' ability to organize through [[social media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pomed.org/blog/2011/01/egypt-ap-confirms-government-has-disrupted-internet-service.html/|title=Egypt: AP Confirms Government has Disrupted Internet Service|publisher=pomed.org|accessdate=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that day, as tens of thousands protested on the streets of Egypt's major cities, President Mubarak dismissed his government, later appointing a new cabinet. Mubarak also appointed the first Vice President in almost 30 years.

On 10 February, Mubarak ceded all presidential power to Vice President [[Omar Suleiman]], but soon thereafter announced that he would remain as President until the end of his term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110211/D9LA9H180.html|title=Egypt's Mubarak refuses to quit, hands VP powers|publisher=Apnews.myway.com|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, protests continued the next day, and Suleiman quickly announced that Mubarak had resigned from the presidency and transferred power to the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces|Armed Forces of Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sharm el-Sheikh resort in world spotlight as Egypt's Mubarak flees Cairo|url=http://travel.usatoday.com/destinations/dispatches/post/2011/02/sharm-el-sheikh-resort--in-world-spotlight-as-egypts-mubarak-flees-cairo/142665/1|accessdate=11 February 2011|work=USA Today|date=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The military immediately dissolved the [[Egyptian Parliament]], suspended the [[Constitution of Egypt]], and promised to lift the nation's thirty-year &quot;[[Emergency law in Egypt|emergency law]]s&quot;.

After the success of the revolution in Tunisia, a protest on living conditions began on 14 January in [[Bayda, Libya]], where protesters clashed with police and attacked government offices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/16/muammar-gaddafi-condemns-tunisia-uprising | title = Muammar Gaddafi condemns Tunisia uprising | date = 16 January 2011 | newspaper=The Guardian | place = UK | location=London | first1=Mohamed | last1=ElBaradei | first2=Matthew | last2=Weaver}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cjpme.org/DisplayDocument.aspx?DocumentID=1560&amp;SaveMode=0 | title = Canadians for Justice and Peace in the Middle East | author=&lt;Please add first missing authors to populate metadata.&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-government protests began in Libya on 15 February 2011. By 18 February, the opposition controlled most of [[Benghazi]], the country's second-largest city. The government dispatched elite troops and mercenaries in an attempt to recapture it, but they were repelled. By 20 February, protests had spread to the capital [[Tripoli]], leading to a television address by [[Saif al-Islam Gaddafi]], who warned the protestors that their country could descend into civil war. The rising death toll, numbering in the thousands, drew international condemnation and resulted in the resignation of several Libyan diplomats, along with calls for the regime's dismantlement.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

On 26 February 2011, amidst ongoing efforts by demonstrators and rebel forces to wrest control of Tripoli from the [[Jamahiriya]], the opposition set up an [[National Transitional Council|interim government]] in Benghazi to oppose Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lse.co.uk/FinanceNews.asp?ArticleCode=77c8l0riig2uluz&amp;ArticleHeadline=Ex_Libyan_minister_forms_interim_govtreport |title= Ex Libyan minister forms interim govt-report| agency=LSE | date=26 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1359954/Libya-rebels-seize-Tripoli-thousands-foreigners-battle-flee-hell.html?ito=feeds-newsxml| title = Exodus Tripoli: Libyan rebels seize control of third major city as thousands of foreigners battle to flee 'hell'| agency=The Daily Mail|date=24 February 2011|accessdate=27 February 2011|location=London|first=Liz|last=Hazelton}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite initial opposition success, government forces subsequently took back much of the Mediterranean coast.

On 17 March, [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1973]] was adopted, authorising a [[no-fly zone]] over Libya, and &quot;all necessary measures&quot; to protect civilians. Two days later, France, the United States and the United Kingdom [[2011 military intervention in Libya|intervened in Libya]] with a bombing campaign against pro-Gaddafi forces. A coalition of 27 states from Europe and the Middle East soon joined the intervention. The forces were driven back from the outskirts of Benghazi, and the rebels [[Late March 2011 Libyan rebel offensive|mounted an offensive]], capturing scores of towns across the coast of Libya. The offensive stalled however, and a counter-offensive by the government retook most of the towns, until a [[Battle of BregaâAjdabiya road|stalemate]] was formed between [[Brega]] and [[Ajdabiya]], the former being held by the government and the latter in the hands of the rebels. Focus then shifted to the west of the country, where bitter fighting continued. After a [[Battle of Misrata|three-month-long battle]], a loyalist siege of rebel-held [[Misrata]], the third largest city in Libya, was broken in large part due to coalition air strikes. The four major fronts of combat were generally considered to be the [[Nafusa Mountains]], the [[Tripolitania]]n coast, the [[Gulf of Sidra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vancouversun.com/story_print.html?id=5061000&amp;sponsor=|agency=The Vancouver Sun|date=6 July 2011|accessdate=20 July 2011|title=Rebels wage a secret night-time war on the streets of Tripoli|first=Adrian|last=Blomfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the southern [[Libyan Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424053111904233404576458154035344420.html|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=20 July 2011|title=Rebels Move Toward Gadhafi Stronghold||author=Levinson, Charles|accessdate=12 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late August, anti-Gaddafi fighters [[Battle of Tripoli (2011)|captured]] [[Tripoli]], scattering Gaddafi's government and marking the end of his 42 years of autocracy.

On 9 March, in a live televised address, King Mohammed announced that he would begin a comprehensive constitutional reform aimed at improving democracy and the rule of law.

On 20 March, a further protest was held in Casablanca to mark the end of the first month since the original 20 February demonstrations and to maintain pressure for reform.

==Analysis==
===Ethnic scope===
Many analysts, journalists, and involved parties have focused on the protests as being a uniquely [[Arab people|Arab]] phenomenon, and indeed, protests and uprisings have been strongest and most wide-reaching in majority-Arabic-speaking countries, giving rise to the popular moniker of Arab Springâa play on the so-called 1968 [[Prague Spring]], a democratic awakening in what was then [[History of Czechoslovakia (1948â1989)|communist]] [[Czechoslovakia]]âto refer to protests, uprisings, and revolutions in those states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/11/us-iran-region-unrest-idUSTRE73A42Q20110411|agency=Reuters|date=11 April 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011|first=Reza|last=Derakhshi|title=Hardship blunts Iranian interest in Arab protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/Europe-Watches-Arab-Protests-for-Lessons-115572254.html|agency=Voice of America|title=Europe Watches Arab Protests for Lessons|date=8 February 2011|first=Lisa|last=Bryant|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=The Jerusalem Post|url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=211703|title=Surge in Arab protests expected in Gulf states|first=Oren|last=Kessler|date=11 March 2011|accessdate=27 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the international media has also noted the role of minority groups in many of these majority-Arab countries in the revolts. In addition, this series of revolutions has been marked by the absence of [[Arab Nationalism|Arab Nationalist]] banners and rhetoric among the masses in favor of principles of human rights, freedom, democracy and cultural diversity, even in absolute majority-Arab countries.

Protests in many countries affected by the Arab Spring have attracted widespread support from the international community, while harsh government responses have generally met condemnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=NDU0MTU1MjQw|agency=Kuwait Times|date=28 May 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Poland rallies E Europe's support for 'Arab Spring'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12869552|agency=BBC News|date=26 March 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Syria protests: US and UN condemn armed crackdown}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mmegi.bw/index.php?sid=1&amp;aid=1138&amp;dir=2011/February/Tuesday22|agency=Mmegi Online|date=22 February 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Botswana condemns Libya}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;IranMub&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/world/20110201/162402844.html|agency=Ria Novosti|date=1 February 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Iran backs anti-Mubarak protests in Egypt â foreign minister}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[2011 Bahraini uprising|Bahraini]], [[2011 Moroccan protests|Moroccan]], and [[2011 Syrian uprising|Syrian]] protests, the international response has been considerably more nuanced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/11/apr/1201.html|agency=Payvand Iran News|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Iran and Bahrain exchange threats of embassy closure while Kuwait confirms expulsion of Iranian diplomats}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/view_syria_protests/3540271.html|agency=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|date=29 March 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=The View From Iran Of Syria's Protests}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.worldtribune.com/worldtribune/WTARC/2011/me_military0315_03_21.asp|agency=World Tribune|date=21 March 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Qatar, other Gulf states deploy troops to Bahrain}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/03/24/idUS251054+24-Mar-2011+PRN20110324|agency=Reuters/PR Newswire|date=24 March 2011|accessdate=5 June 2011|title=Sec.

Some critics have accused Western governments, including those of France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, of [[hypocrisy]] in the way they have reacted to the Arab Spring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pilger|first=John|title=Behind the Arab revolt is a word we dare not speak|url=http://www.johnpilger.com/articles/behind-the-arab-revolt-is-a-word-we-dare-not-speak|accessdate=5 June 2011|newspaper=[[JohnPilger.com]]|date=18 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cockburn|first=Patrick|title=So the Arab landscape shifts â and confusion reigns|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/patrick-cockburn-so-the-arab-landscape-shifts-ndash-and-confusion-reigns-2269022.html|accessdate=4 June 2011|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=17 April 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] accused the [[presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] of endeavoring to muffle the revolutionary wave and stifle popular democratization efforts in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chomsky|first=Noam|title=The U.S. and Its Allies Will Do Anything to Prevent Democracy in the Arab World|url=http://www.democracynow.org/seo/2011/5/11/noam_chomsky_the_us_and_its|accessdate=4 June 2011|newspaper=[[Democracy Now]]|date=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protests have also affected oil prices, contributing to the [[2011 energy crisis]]. The [[International Monetary Fund]] said oil prices were likely to be higher than originally forecast due to unrest in the Middle East and North Africa, major regions of oil production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.canoe.ca/money/business/canada/archives/2011/02/20110217-151716.html|title=Oil price rising to dangerous levels for economy |publisher=money.canoe.ca/ |date=18 February 2011 |accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenan Engin, a German-Turkish political scientist, identified the new uprising in Arab and Islamic countries as the &quot;fifth wave of democracy&quot; because of evident features qualitatively similar to the &quot;third wave of democracy&quot; in Latin America that took place in the '70s and '80s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kenan Engin |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=the-arab-spring-the-5.0-democracy-wave-2011-08-19 |title=The Arab Spring: The 5.0 Democracy Wave |publisher=Hurriyet Daily News |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.migrapolis-deutschland.de/index.php?id=1994 |title=MIGRApolis: Die fÃ¼nfte Welle der Demokratisierung im islamisch-arabischen Raum? |publisher=Migrapolis-deutschland.de |accessdate=28 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
