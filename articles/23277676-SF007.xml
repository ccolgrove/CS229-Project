'''Microsoft Security Essentials''' ('''MSE''') is a free [[Antivirus software|antivirus software product]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems that provides protection against different types of [[malware]] such as [[computer virus]], [[spyware]], [[rootkit]]s and [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horses]]. Unlike the [[Microsoft Forefront]] family of enterprise-oriented security products, Microsoft Security Essentials is geared for consumer use.

Microsoft Security Essentials [[#Reception|received positive reviews]] upon its release. In September 2011, it was the most popular antivirus software product in North America and the second most popular in the world.

==Development==
In 2005, Microsoft acquired security software firm [[Sybari]] of [[Hauppauge, New York]], and shortly thereafter released the [[Microsoft Forefront]] line of server security products.  
Microsoft then announced plans for a free consumer security product [[List of Microsoft codenames|codenamed]] '''Morro''' on 18 November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/Presspass/press/2008/nov08/11-18NoCostSecurityPR.mspx Microsoft Announces Plans for No-Cost Consumer Security Offering]&lt;/ref&gt; It marked a change in Microsoft's consumer antivirus marketing strategy: Instead of offering a subscription-based antivirus with a host of other tools, such as [[backup]] and a [[personal firewall]], ''Morro'' would be free for all genuine installations of Windows not intended for business use (with an exception for small home based businesses) and offers protection against all types of [[malware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc&quot; &gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7737520.stm |title=Microsoft to offer free security |publisher=BBC News |date=19 November 2008 |accessdate=4 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Microsoft Forefront]] would be offered alongside Microsoft Security Essentials, with central management tools not present in Microsoft Security Essentials, which is based on Microsoft Forefront technology obtained through the acquisition of Sybari in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.technet.com/b/mmpc/archive/2009/09/29/introducing-microsoft-security-essentials.aspx Introducing Microsoft Security Essentials&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

On 23 June 2009, Microsoft opened a public [[software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] to 75,000 people in the [[United States]], [[Israel]], [[People's Republic of China]] and [[Brazil]]. At the time, Microsoft stated that Microsoft Security Essentials would be finalized and released before the end of 2009, in 20 markets and 10 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Foley |first=Mary-Jo |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=3141 |title=Microsoft Security Essentials beta to be capped at 75,000, kicks off today |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final build was released on 29 September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mediati |first=Nick |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/172762/microsoft_security_essentials_launches_tuesday.html |title=Microsoft Security Essentials Launches Tuesday  |publisher=[[PC World (magazine)|PCWorld]] |date=28 June 2009 |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbronline.com/news/microsoft_launches_new_antimalware_service_090928 |title=Microsoft Launches New Anti-Malware Service |publisher=Computer Business Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hardware requirements for Microsoft Security Essentials differ, depending on the [[operating system]]. For Windows XP, Microsoft Security Essentials requires at least a 500 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[Central processing unit|processor]] and 256 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. On Windows Vista and Windows 7, Microsoft Security Essentials requires a 1 [[gigahertz|GHz]] processor and 1 GB of RAM. Under any compatible operating system, a [[VGA]] screen of 800 Ã 600 or higher, 140 MB of free space, and an Internet connection are also required.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Microsoft Corporations |url=http://www.microsoft.com/security_essentials/resources.aspx?mkt=en-us&amp;s=1#mainNav |title=Find out what you need to know about installing and running Microsoft Security Essentials |accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second version ===
On 19 July 2010, Microsoft released a [[technical preview]] of Microsoft Security Essentials 2.0. On 16 December 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials version 2.0 passed the technical preview stage and was officially released to public. This version includes ''Network Inspection System'', a [[network intrusion detection system]] that works on Windows Vista and Windows 7 as well as a new anti-malware engine that employs [[Heuristics#Computer science|heuristics]] in malware detection.

=== Future ===
On 13 September 2011, at the Microsoft BUILD conference in [[Anaheim, California]], Microsoft announced it will be integrating built-in anti-malware features in the upcoming version of Windows, codenamed [[Windows 8]]. Microsoft also showed that this new antivirus is capable of preventing an infected [[USB flash memory]] from compromising the system during the boot process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Whitney|first=Lance|title=Windows 8 to offer built-in malware protection|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-20106681-75/windows-8-to-offer-built-in-malware-protection/|work=[[CNET]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=15 September 2011|date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kingsley-Hughes|first=Adrian|title=Windows 8 will ship with built-in antivirus protection|work=[[ZDNet]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=15 September 2011|date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Small businesses are also allowed to install this product on up to 10 devices. The software license agreement however, denies the use of Microsoft Security Essentials in academic institutions, enterprises and governmental locations. The license agreement also denies the user the right to reverse-engineer, hack, decompile or disassemble Microsoft Security Essentials or to publish or disclose the results of benchmark tests of this software product to third parties without prior written approval from Microsoft Corporation.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSE-EULA&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Finally, on 2 October 2009, Avast Software a.s. (developer of [[avast!]]) commented that it has an ambivalent view towards Microsoft Security Essentials. &quot;MSE is not the silver bullet but it is also not the bad sequel to One Care that some claim,&quot; said Vincent Steckler, Avast Software CEO.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brian Krebs of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' reported that a &quot;quick scan&quot; took about 10 minutes, and a &quot;full scan&quot; about 45 minutes on an installation of [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Krebs&quot; /&gt;

[[Ars Technica]] reviewed it positively, citing its organized interface, low resource usage, and its status as [[freeware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ars Technica&quot;&gt;{{cite web

''[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'' noted its &quot;clear-cut&quot; and &quot;cleanly designed&quot; tabbed [[user interface]]. At the top of the main tab, the security status is clearly shown. The other three tabs allow users to manually update Microsoft Security Essentials, review its history, and change program settings. However, PC World found some of the settings to be cryptic and confusing. Settings, such as what to do when malware is found, default to &quot;Microsoft Security Essentials' recommended action&quot;. There is no explanation of the recommended action except in the help file. The editor was also confused because Microsoft Security Essentials does not mention it automatically updates itself within the interface; some may believe they must manually update Microsoft Security Essentials through the &quot;Update&quot; tab.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCWorld&quot; /&gt; However, this was included in the final release.

''[[PC Magazine]]'' cited Microsoft Security Essentials's small installation package (about 7 MB, depending on the operating system) and its speedy installation. On the downside, the full installation occupied about 110 MB of disk space, and the initial update took 5 to 15 minutes. The editor also noted the fact Microsoft Security Essentials sets [[Windows Update]] into its fully automatic mode, which automatically downloads and installs updates although it can then be turned off again through the control panel. Installation succeeded on 12 malware-infected systems. Some full scans took over an hour on infected systems; however, a scan on a clean system took 35 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCMag&quot; /&gt;

Although the Beta release of Microsoft Security Essentials did poorly in PC Magazine tests, the [[Software release life cycle#General availability|official final release]] did significantly better in AV-Test.org tests. According to Neil Rubenking, a PC Magazine author, in an on-demand scan test that he conducted in June 2009, Microsoft Security Essentials Beta found 89 percent of all malware samples: It found only 30 percent of commercial keyloggers, 67 percent of [[rootkits]] and only half of [[scareware]] samples. The suite's real-time protection found 83 percent of all malware samples and blocked the majority of them: In this test, Microsoft Security Essentials found 40 percent of the commercial keyloggers and 78 percent of the rootkits.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCMag&quot; /&gt; Later on October that year, AV-Test.org conducted a series of trials on the officially released version of the product in which Microsoft Security Essentials detected and caught 98.44 percent of 545,034 [[computer virus]]es, [[computer worms]] and [[Trojan horse (computing)|software Trojan horses]] as well as 90.95 percent of 14,222 [[spyware]] and [[adware]] samples. It also detected and eliminated all 25 tested rootkits. Microsoft Security Essentials generated no [[false-positive]]s at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On 7 January 2010, Microsoft Security Essentials won the [[PC Advisor]]'s ''Best Free Software'' award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Microsoft Security Essentials v2.0 was released shortly thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Market share==
One year after the initial release of Microsoft Security Essentials, on 29 September 2010, it had gained 30 million users.&lt;ref name=TechRadar &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/microsoft-security-essentials-racks-up-30-million-users-719995 |title=Microsoft Security Essentials racks up 30 million users |publisher=TechRadar |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Security Industry Market Share Analysis'' report of June 2011, published by OPSWAT, Inc. states that Microsoft Security Essentials has been one of the most popular antivirus products in the world.&lt;ref name=OPSWAT-June-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Industry Market Share Analysis â June 2011|url=http://www.opswat.com/media/reports/OPSWAT-Market-Share-Report-June-2011.pdf|work=OPSWAT Market Share Report|publisher=OPSWAT|accessdate=12 June 2011|format=[[PDF]]|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the report, Microsoft Security Essentials had 10.66% of the global market&lt;ref name=OPSWAT-June-2011 /&gt;{{rp|5}} and 15.68% of the North America market.&lt;ref name=OPSWAT-June-2011 /&gt;{{rp|4}} The same report places Microsoft the number one antivirus vendor in the North America with 17.07% market share,&lt;ref name=OPSWAT-June-2011 /&gt;{{rp|3}} as well as the number four antivirus vendor in the whole world.&lt;ref name=OPSWAT-June-2011 /&gt;{{rp|2}}

John Dunn of PC World, who analyzed the report, noted that the tendency to use free antivirus software is something new. &quot;After all, free antivirus suites have been around for years but have tended to be seen as the poor relations to paid software.&quot; He named Microsoft Security Essentials as a source of influence for PC users to adopt free antivirus software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In September 2011, OPSWAT report indicates that Microsoft Security Essentials has become the second most popular antivirus product in the world, while remaining the most popular in North America.&lt;ref name=OPSWAT-September-2011&gt;{{cite web|title=Security Industry Market Share Analysis â September 2011|url=http://www.opswat.com/sites/default/files/OPSWAT-market-share-report-september-2011.pdf|work=OPSWAT Market Share Report|publisher=OPSWAT|accessdate=30 August 2011|format=[[PDF]]|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rogue antivirus software==
In February 2010, a [[rogue security software]] package calling itself &quot;Security Essentials 2010&quot; appeared on the Internet. This malware, designated ''TrojanDownloader:Win32/Fakeinit'', bears no resemblance to Microsoft Security Essentials except for the name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A more dangerous form of these malware rogues however, appeared in October 2010. This malware, designated ''Rogue:Win32/FakePAV'', closely resembles Microsoft Security Essentials in look and uses sophisticated social engineering to compel users into introducing malware to their systems, under the guise of five different fictional anti-malware products. This malware also terminates and prevents the launch of 156 different programs, including but not limited to [[Registry Editor]], [[Command Prompt]], [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera browser|Opera]], [[Safari (browser)|Safari]], [[Google Chrome]] and other web browsers, email clients, instant messaging clients, media players and entertainment software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
