The '''BaojiâLanzhou High-Speed Railway''' is a proposed [[high-speed railway]] between [[Baoji]] and [[Lanzhou]], in [[China]]. The railway will cut the rail travel between Baoji and Lanzhou from current five hours to one hour and a half. It will connect with [[Xi'anâBaoji High-Speed Railway]] to the east and [[LanzhouâUrumqi High-Speed Railway]] to the west.
The feasibility study report has been approved by the [[National Development and Reform Commission]] and the construction work is expected to start in the first half of 2011.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.xinhuanet.com/chinanews/2011-03/05/content_22208959.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven stations will be built on the line: Baoji South, Dongcha, Tianshui South, Qin'an, Tongwei, Dingxi, and Lanzhou West. 92% of the total length will be elevated or in tunnels. The total investment is estimated to be CNÂ¥64 billion.&lt;ref&gt;http://gs.people.com.cn/GB/183283/14068390.html&lt;/ref&gt;
