The '''1992â93 MetJHL [[Season (sports)|season]]''' is the [[List of OJHL seasons|2nd]] season of the [[Metro Junior A Hockey League]] (MetJHL). The 13 teams of the Fullan and Bauer Divisions competed in a 48-game schedule.  The top 6 teams in each division made the playoffs.

The winner of the MetJHL playoffs, the [[Wexford Raiders]], could not proceed further in the National playdowns as the MetJHL was not a member of the [[Ontario Hockey Association]].  However, the Raiders were permitted to play a 2-game series for charity against the [[OJHL|OHA's Central Junior League]]'s champion, the [[Barrie Colts]].  The Raiders won both games.

==Exhibition Series vs. [[OJHL|CJAHL]]==
The [[Barrie Colts]] of the [[OJHL|OHA's Central Junior A League]] and the [[Wexford Raiders]] of the Metro League played a pair of exhibition games head-to-head for charity.  The purpose of the games was to match the probably champions of the two leagues head-to-head to see where each league's talent level stood if the OHA was to allow both leagues in as sanctioned Junior A leagues for the 1993-94 season.  Wexford won both games by narrow margins, but the second game was marred by an incident involving a fight, initiated by the [[Barrie Colts]], that spilled into the crowd.
