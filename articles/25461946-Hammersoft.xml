The '''2009â10 Temple Owls men's basketball team''' represented [[Temple University]] in the [[2009â10 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]]. They were led by head coach [[Fran Dunphy]] and played their home games at the [[Liacouras Center]]. The Owls are members of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. They finished the season 29&amp;ndash;6, 14&amp;ndash;2 in A-10 play to claim a share of the regular season championship. They won the [[2010 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament]] for the third consecutive year to receive the conferences automatic bid to the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. They received a 5 seed in the East Region where they were upset in the first round by 12 seed [[2009â10 Cornell Big Red men's basketball team|Cornell]].

==Preseason==
The team is set to play their home games at [[Liacouras Center]], which has a capacity of 10,206.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbssports.com/collegebasketball/teams/page/TEMP/temple-owls|title=Temple Owls|accessdate=19 December 2009|date=2009|work=[[CBS Sports]]|publisher=CBS Interactive}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are in their 28th season as a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://a.espncdn.com/media/pdf/091115/temple.pdf|title=Temple|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coming back from their 2008â09 season, they compiled a record of 22-12 and won the [[Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament]] for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueribbon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://insider.espn.go.com/ncb/insider/news/story?id=4536484&amp;action=login&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fncb%2finsider%2fnews%2fstory%3fid%3d4536484|title=Team Preview: Temple|date=22 October 2009|work=Blue Ribbon Yearbook|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=21 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Temple lost star player [[Dionte Christmas]] to graduation, whom Blue Ribbon Yearbook said that, if &quot;anything good that happened to the Owls last year, Christmas had a hand in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blueribbon&quot;/&gt; He led Temple in three statistics: points per game (19.5), three-pointers completed  (107), and total steals (51); he finished second in two more: rebounds per game (5.5) and assists (28).&lt;ref name=&quot;blueribbon&quot;/&gt; In addition, he was an honorable mention All-American and scored 2,000 points over his college basketball career. Also graduating were two other starters: 7-0 center Sergio Olmos, who was selected as an All-A10 Tournament player, and point guard Semaj Inge.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaguidepreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.owlsports.com/documents/2009/12/8/Pages_24-26,_Preview.pdf|title=2009-10 Temple Men's Basketball Media Guide: Preview|work=[[Temple Owls]]|publisher=[[Temple University]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple's schedule was announced on September 3, 2009, consisting of a school record-tying 31 games in the regular season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://owlsports.com/news/2009/9/3/MBB_0903093202.aspx?path=mbball|title=Men's Basketball Announces 2009-10 Schedule|date=3 September 2009|work=[[Temple Owls]]|publisher=[[Temple University]]|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The out-of-conference portion, adopted on July 21, was regarded as one of the toughest in college hoops.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueribbon&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://owlsports.com/news/2009/7/21/072109aaa_105.aspx?path=mbball|title=Kansas, Villanova Highlight 2009-10 Non-Conference Men's Basketball Schedule|date=21 July 2009|work=[[Temple Owls]]|publisher=[[Temple University]]|accessdate=24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The highlights of it include: [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]] and [[Siena]], which began the season ranked; [[Virginia Tech]], a competitor in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]]; [[Penn State]], who won the [[2009 National Invitation Tournament]]; and [[Villanova]] and [[Kansas]], two top 10 teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;blueribbon&quot;/&gt;

Due to these factors, Temple was picked to finish fifth in the conference by the Atlantic 10 Preseason Poll, tied with [[Duquesne]]. [[Lavoy Allen]] was the only team member selected on the Preseason All-Atlantic 10 First Team.&lt;ref name=preseasonallconf&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/atl10/sports/m-baskbl/auto_pdf/MBBPre0910.pdf|title=2009-10 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Preseason All-Conference Teams|date=22 October 2009|work=[[CBS Sports]]|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=18 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Blue Ribbon Yearbook gave the [[backcourt]] a grade of B, the [[frontcourt]] a B, the bench/depth a C+, and the intangibles a B+. They commented that &quot;the Owls have had a way the last couple years of surprising people,&quot; and that while Temple &quot;might still surprise some people, but don't expect it to be with an NCAA Tournament berth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;blueribbon&quot;/&gt;

==Season==
===Preconference season===
The Owls kicked off their season on November 14, 2009 with a 76-56 win against the [[University of Delaware]], sending the Fighting Blue Hens to their fourth straight loss as a home opener.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293180048|title=Temple 76, Delaware 56|date=15 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, the Owls failed to capitalize on preseason No.&amp;nbsp;19 [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown Hoyas]]' sloppy play, as the Hoyas were victorious 45-46. The game featured more fouls (18) and turnovers (16) than completed baskets (15) for Georgetown, playing their home opener at the [[Verizon Center]]. Georgetown led 19-13 at halftime, but Temple managed to mount a comeback, as they led with 6 seconds left in regulation until Hoya [[Greg Monroe]] scored the winning 3-pointer. After the game, Temple's 68-game winning streak when opponents scored less than 50 points was crushed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293210046|title=Hoyas blow 12-point second-half lead but hold off Owls|date=18 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=22 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 21, Temple beat the [[Siena Saints]], after overcoming a six point deficit at the half to end the game at 73-69.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293250218|title=Temple 73, Siena 69|date=22 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=25 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Owls began receiving votes in the [[2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball rankings]] for the week of November 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/rankings?seasonYear=2010&amp;weekNumber=3&amp;seasonType=2|title=2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings (Nov. 23)|accessdate=15 January 2010|date=23 November 2009|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an easy win against [[Ball State]] on November 24, the Owls next faced [[Virginia Tech]] in the semifinals of the [[Philly Hoop Group Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293280218 |title=Temple 66, Ball State 46|date=24 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hokies&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293310218 |title=Temple 61, Virginia Tech 50|date=27 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=14 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temple overcame [[Malcolm Delaney]]'s 32 points to defeat the Hokies 60-51 on November 27. Their 4-1 start was the Owls' best since 2000.&lt;ref name=hokies/&gt;

The team suffered their second loss of the season by the undefeated [[St. John's Red Storm|Red Storm of St. John's]] on November 28, in the championship game of the Philly Hoop Group Classic. Temple led 22-21 at the half, but the Red Storm went on a 14-2 run in the beginning of the second half from which the Owls could not recover, and St. John's won 55-48.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293320218 |title=St. John's 55, Temple 48 |date=29 November 2009|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=15 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused Temple to lose all support in the national rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/rankings?seasonYear=2010&amp;weekNumber=4&amp;seasonType=2|title=2010 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings (Nov. 30)|accessdate=15 January 2010|date=30 November 2009|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Owls rebounded with three consecutive wins: against [[2009â10 Western Michigan Broncos men's basketball team|Western Michigan]], [[2009â10 Penn State Nittany Lions men's basketball team|Penn State]], and [[Miami RedHawks men's basketball|Miami (Ohio)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=293352711 |title=Temple 76, W.

Ryan Brooks's 19 points, the only Owl scoring in double figures, helped lead Temple over the Nittany Lions 45-42 in the largely defensive matchup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://owlsports.com/news/2009/12/5/MBB_1205095935.aspx?path=mbball|title=Men's Basketball Wins Defensive Struggle With Penn State, 45-42|date=5 December 2009|work=[[Temple Owls]]|publisher=[[Temple University]]|accessdate=16 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
