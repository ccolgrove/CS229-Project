''&quot;O Maravilhoso Mundo de Disney&quot;'' (''Wonderful World of Disney&quot;'') is the block after the ''Zapping Zone'' where different [[Walt Disney Pictures]] are aired.

* If it lasts 1:40 to 1:45, a miniature episode of an Original Animated Series will air (most likely an 11-minute episode of an Animated Original Series, the most common to air are ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' and ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. Sometimes, ''[[Art Attack]]'' is air instead).
* If it lasts 1:50 to 1:55, either a music video with air along with Disney Channel promos music video, or an episode of a Disney Channel Short Series such as ''[[Shaun the Sheep]]'', ''The Road to [[The Cheetah Girls 3: One World]]'', ''[[Quando Toca o Sino|As the Bell Rings]],'', ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'' or ''Disney Planet''.

=== Filme Disney Channel ===
''&quot;Filme Disney Channel&quot;'' (''Disney Channel Movie'') is a movie block aired on Fridays after ''Zapping Zone'', Saturdays, Thursdays and sometimes any other [[weekday]] after [[Wonderful World of Disney]].
