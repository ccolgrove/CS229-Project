The '''[[Palestinian territories]]''' or Occupied Palestinian Territory are two conventional name used, among others, to describe the territories of the [[West Bank]], [[East Jerusalem]] and the [[Gaza Strip]], which were designated as the jurisdiction of the [[Palestinian Authority]] in the Palestinian-Israeli agreement of 13 September 1993.&lt;ref&gt;Paragraph IV of the 1993 Declaration of Principles, which is part of the [[Oslo Accords]], [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/middle_east/israel_and_the_palestinians/key_documents/1682727.stm full text on the BBC News website].&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally these territories are also referred to as Palestine, which creates some ambiguity with the term [[Palestine]] as a geographic region between the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Jordan River]], and various adjoining lands.&lt;ref name=PEF&gt;{{cite web|title=The Palestine Exploration Fund|publisher=The [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]|url=http://www.pef.org.uk/oldsite/Paldef.htm|accessdate=2008-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final status of the Palestinian territories and their final boundaries are two issues that have been subject to deep dispute within the context of the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. The names and terminology used to describe the territory or locations within its current boundaries are also often disputed. In the [[Palestinian National Charter]], the Palestinian [[homeland]] is defined as the territory of British Mandate Palestine (excluding [[Transjordan]]).&lt;ref name=Said&gt;Said and Hitchens, 2001, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[State of Israel]] was established as a national homeland for the [[Jews]] in approximately three-quarters of this territory in May 1948, amid the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]]. The remaining quarter, comprising the [[Gaza Strip]] and the [[West Bank]] (including what is now known as [[East Jerusalem]]), were [[Occupation of the Gaza Strip by Egypt|occupied by Egypt]] and [[Occupation of the West Bank and East Jerusalem by Jordan|by Jordan]], and later [[Israeli-occupied territories|by Israel]] during the 1967 [[Six Day War]].

The Palestinian people, including the [[Palestinian diaspora]], have been represented before the international community by the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) since its establishment in 1964. In November 1988, the [[Palestinian National Council]] (PNC), the [[government-in-exile|parliament-in-exile]] of the PLO [[Palestinian Declaration of Independence|proclaimed the establishment]] of the State of Palestine, diplomatically recognized by several tens of countries.&lt;ref&gt;There are contradicting reports about the actual number ranging from 67 [http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g8_mQhPKa5f5urfm_o3_nYf_Y_Wg] to about 100&lt;/ref&gt; Deviating from the usual criteria governing the classic definition of a [[nation-state|state]] or [[country]], the precise boundaries of Palestine have yet to be determined and full autonomy has yet to be secured.&lt;ref name=George&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Palestine a State?|author=Forji Amin George|date=June 2004|url=http://www.expertlaw.com/library/international_law/palestine.html|accessdate=2008-04-04|publisher=Expert Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Miltonp5&gt;Milton-Edwards, 2008, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Palestinian National Authority]], established pursuant to the [[Oslo Accords]], is an interim administrative body responsible for governance in population Palestinian centers in the [[West Bank]] and [[Gaza Strip]] until final status negotiations are concluded.&lt;ref name=EF/&gt;
