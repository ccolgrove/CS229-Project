==Profile==
DWBR or '''Business Radio''' is the only remaining radio station broadcasting in the [[Metro Manila]] area that plays the [[adult standards|old standards]] [[traditional pop music|type]] of [[music]], from the era of the [[big bands]], to the crooners, showtunes, Broadway or songs that gained prominence in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, featuring artists like [[Frank Sinatra]], [[Matt Monro]], [[Doris Day]], [[Eartha Kitt]], [[Andy Williams]], [[The Platters]], etc. 

The station also covers and reports on the latest business stories and issues in the Philippines with its coverage of the Philippine [[stock market]] in the mornings. The station also boosts itself with various talk programs that discusses relevant matters concerning business, the [[Natural environment|environment]]. 

Sunday programming in the afternoon can be described as nostalgic with veteran radio disc jockeys, considered as the pioneer voices in Philippine radio going on board for &quot;Golden Years&quot; with the likes of [[Ernie Zarate]], [[Jo San Diego]], [[Barr Samson]], [[Lito Gorospe]] and [[Bong Lapira]]. Previously, voices of Philippine broadcast icons like [[Ben Aniceto]], [[Eddie Ilarde]], including the late greats [[Johnny Wilson (radio)|Johnny Wilson]] and [[Eddie Mercado]] were heard on DWBR. On the news programming part, veteran radio and television news anchor [[Bon Vibar]] can still be heard on DWBR with the same old clear and crisp voice of an unaccented English. Veteran social-political commentarist [[Larry Henares]] still dishes out issues of the day on his radio program, &quot;Make My Day&quot; from Monday to Friday.

The radio station also promotes OPM or [[Original Pilipino Music]] by playing two to three Filipino songs every hour, mostly Filipino music of the recent decades. The station also features on Sunday night a special program that highlights traditional Filipino music called the &quot;[[kundiman]]&quot; and the &quot;[[harana]],&quot; or music of serenade.
