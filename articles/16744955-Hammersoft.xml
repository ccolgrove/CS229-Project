In 1999 Namibia signed a mutual defence pact with its northern neighbour [[Angola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Situation Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web

This affected the [[Angolan Civil War]] that had been ongoing since Angola's independence in 1975. Namibia's ruling party [[SWAPO]] sought to support the ruling party [[MPLA]] in Angola against the rebel movement [[UNITA]], whose stronghold is in southern Angola, bordering to Namibia. The defence pact allowed Angolan troops to use Namibian territory when attacking [[Jonas Savimbi]]'s UNITA.

The alliance between SWAPO and MPLA was formed during the 1960s while both Angola and Namibia sought to overthrow colonial regimes ([[Portuguese Empire]] and [[Apartheid]] [[South Africa]]). The [[Namibian War of Independence]] coincided with the [[Angolan civil war]] for nearly 25 years. In Angola, the leftist movement MPLA was fighting the rightist movement UNITA, which was supported by [[South Africa]]. In Namibia, [[SWAPO]], then being a rebel movement, was fighting for independence from South Africa. As MPLA and SWAPO shared a common ideological ground, and had a common enemy in South Africa, they came to cooperate.

The Angolan civil war resulted in a large number of Angolan [[refugees]] coming to Namibia. At its peak in 2001 there were over 30,000 [[Angolans in Namibia|Angolan refugees in Namibia]]. The calmer situation in Angola has made it possible for many of them to return to their home with the help of [[UNHCR]], and in 2004 only 12,600 remained in Namibia.
