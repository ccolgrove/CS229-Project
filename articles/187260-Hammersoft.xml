The '''culture of Greece''' has evolved over thousands of years, beginning in [[Mycenaean Greece]], continuing most notably into [[Classical Greece]], through the influence of the [[Roman Empire]] and its [[Greek East]]ern successor the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Other cultures and states such as [[Frankokratia|Latin and Frankish states]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Venetian Republic]], [[Genoese Republic]], and [[British Empire]] have also left their influence on modern Greek culture, but historians credit the [[Greek War of Independence]] with revitalising Greece and giving birth to a single entity of its multi-faceted culture.

===Ancient Greece===
{{Main|Ancient Greek architecture}}
Ancient Greek architecture is best known through its temples and theatres.

===Byzantine Greece===
{{Main|Byzantine architecture}}

Byzantine architecture is the architecture of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Byzantine architecture emphasized a Greek cross layout, the Byzantine capitol style of column (a mixture of [[Ionic order|Ionic]] and [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] capitols) and a central [[dome]] surrounded by several smaller domes.

===Modern Greece===
{{Main|Modern Greek architecture}}

After the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] of Greece and during the nineteenth century, the [[Neoclassical architecture]] was heavily used for both public and private building.&lt;ref&gt;Manos G. BirÄs, MarÅ KardamitsÄ-AdamÄ, ''Neoclassical architecture in Greece''&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the churches, Greece also experienced the [[Neo-Byzantine]] revival.

In the twentieth century, Greek architecture followed international architectural trends. Important Greek and international architects designed many buildings of [[Athens]] and other Greek cities, such as [[Dimitris Pikionis]], [[Stamatios Kleanthis]], [[Anastasios Metaxas]], [[Ernst Ziller]], [[Theophil Freiherr von Hansen]], [[Patroklos Karantinos]], [[Walter Gropius]], [[Eero Saarinen]] and [[Mario Botta]]. Several new buildings were also constructed by [[Santiago Calatrava]] for the 2004 [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens Olympics]], while [[Bernard Tschumi]]  designed the [[New Acropolis Museum]].

==Painting==
===Byzantine Greece===
{{main|Byzantine Art|Macedonian art (Byzantine)}}
[[File:Hagiasophia-christ.jpg|thumb|160px|Example of Greek Orthodox visual [[hagiography]].]]

Byzantine art is the term created for the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] from about the 5th century until the fall of [[Constantinople]] in 1453. The most salient feature of this new aesthetic was its âabstract,â or anti-naturalistic character. If classical art was marked by the attempt to create representations that mimicked reality as closely as possible, Byzantine art seems to have abandoned this attempt in favor of a more symbolic approach. The Byzantine painting concentrated mainly on [[icon]]s and [[hagiography|hagiographies]].

===Modern Greece===
{{main|Cretan School|Heptanese School (painting)|Modern Greek art}}
[[File:Gyzis nikolaos photo.jpeg|thumb|left|130px|[[Nikolaos Gyzis]] (1842-1901), painter from [[Tinos]]. The island of Tinos has a significal contribution to modern Greek painting and sculpture.]]

The term [[Cretan School]] describes an important school of icon painting, also known as Post-Byzantine art, which flourished while [[Crete]] was under [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] rule during the late [[Middle Ages]], reaching its climax after the [[Fall of Constantinople]], becoming the central force in Greek painting during the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. The Cretan artists developed a particular style of painting under the influence of both Eastern and Western artistic traditions and movements. The most famous product of the school, [[El Greco]], was the most successful of the many artists who tried to build a career in Western Europe.

The [[Heptanese School (painting)|Heptanese School of painting]] succeeded the Cretan school as the leading school of Greek post-Byzantine painting after Crete fell to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in 1669. Like the Cretan school it combined Byzantine traditions with an increasing [[Western European]] artistic influence, and also saw the first significant depiction of secular subjects. The school was based in the [[Ionian islands]], which were not part of Ottoman Greece, from the middle of the 17th century until the middle of the 19th century.

Modern Greek painting, after the [[Greek War of Independence|independence]] and the creation of the modern Greek state, began to be developed around the time of [[Romanticism]] and the Greek artists absorbed many elements from their European colleagues, resulting in the culmination of the distinctive style of Greek Romantic art.

==Cinema==
{{Main|Greek cinema}}
[[File:John Malkovich press conference, TIFF 2007.jpg|thumb|Press conference at the [[Thessaloniki International Film Festival]].]]

Cinema first appeared in Greece in 1896 but the first actual cine-theatre was opened in 1907. In 1914 the ''Asty Films Company'' was founded and the production of long films begun. ''Golfo'' (ÎÎºÏÎ»ÏÏ), a well known traditional love story, is the first Greek long movie, although there were several minor productions such as newscasts before this. In 1931 [[Orestis Laskos]] directed ''Daphnis and Chloe'' (''ÎÎ¬ÏÎ½Î¹Ï ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î§Î»ÏÎ·''), contained the first nude scene in the history of European cinema. In 1944 [[Katina Paxinou]] was honoured with the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] for ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]''.

The 1950s and early 1960s are considered by many as the Greek Golden age of Cinema. Directors and actors of this era were recognized as important historical figures in Greece and some gained international acclaim: [[Mihalis Kakogiannis]], [[Alekos Sakellarios]], [[Melina Mercouri]], [[Nikos Tsiforos]], [[Iakovos Kambanelis]], [[Katina Paxinou]], [[Nikos Koundouros]], [[Ellie Lambeti]], [[Irene Papas]] etc. More than sixty films per year were made, with the majority having film noir elements . Notable films were ''Î ÎºÎ¬Î»ÏÎ¹ÎºÎ· Î»Î¯ÏÎ±'' (1955 directed by [[Giorgos Tzavelas]]), ''Î Î¹ÎºÏÏ Î¨ÏÎ¼Î¯'' (1951, directed by Grigoris Grigoriou), ''[[O Drakos]]'' (1956 directed by [[Nikos Koundouros]]), ''[[Stella (1955 film)|Stella]]'' (1955 directed by Cacoyannis and written by Kampanellis). Cacoyannis also directed ''Zorba the Greek'' with Anthony Quinn which received Best Director, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Film nominations. [[Finos Film]] also contributed to this period with movies such as ''ÎÎ±ÏÎ­ÏÎ½Î±, Î¦ÏÏÏÎµÎ¹Î± ÎºÎ±Î¹ Î¦Î¹Î»ÏÏÎ¹Î¼Î¿'', ''Î ÎÎµÎ¯Î± Î±ÏÏ ÏÎ¿ Î£Î¹ÎºÎ¬Î³Î¿'', ''Î¤Î¿ Î¾ÏÎ»Î¿ Î²Î³Î®ÎºÎµ Î±ÏÏ ÏÎ¿Î½ Î Î±ÏÎ¬Î´ÎµÎ¹ÏÎ¿'' and many more. During the 1970s and 1980s [[Theo Angelopoulos]] directed a series of notable and appreciated movies. His film ''[[Eternity and a Day]]'' won the [[Palme d'Or]] and the [[Prize of the Ecumenical Jury]] at the [[1998 Cannes Film Festival]].

There were also internationally renowned filmmakers in the Greek diaspora such as the Greek-American [[Elia Kazan]].

==Language==
{{Main|Greek language}}
[[File:AGMA Ostrakon Cimon.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek [[Ostracon]] bearing the name of [[Cimon]]. [[Stoa of Attalos|Museum of the Ancient Agora]], [[Athens]].]]

The Greek language is the official language of the [[Hellenic Republic]] and has a total of 15 million speakers worldwide; it is an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language. It is particularly remarkable in the depth of its continuity, beginning with the pre-historic [[Mycenaean Greek]] and the [[Linear B]] script, and maybe the [[Linear A]] script associated with [[Minoan civilization]], though Linear A is still undeciphered. Greek language is clearly detected in the Mycenaean language and the [[Cypriot syllabary]], and eventually the dialects of [[Ancient Greek]], of which [[Attic Greek]] bears the most resemblance to [[Modern Greek]]. The history of the language spans over 3400 years of written records. 

Greek has had enormous impact on other languages both directly on the [[Roman language|Romance languages]], and indirectly through its influence on the emerging [[Latin]] language during the early days of [[Rome]]. Signs of this influence, and its many developments, can be seen throughout the family of Western European  languages.

===Internet and &quot;Greeklish&quot;===
More recently, the rise of internet-based communication services as well as cell phones have caused a distinctive form of Greek written partially, and sometimes fully in Latin characters to emerge; this is known as [[Greeklish]], a form that has spread across the Greek diaspora and even to the two countries with majority Greek population, [[Cyprus]] and [[Greece]].

===Katharevousa===
{{Main|Katharevousa}}
KatharÃ©vousa is a purified form of the Greek Language midway between modern and ancient forms set in train during the early nineteenth century by Greek intellectual and revolutionary leader [[Adamantios Korais]], intended to return the Greek language closer to its ancient form. Its influence, in recent years, evolved toward a more formal role, and it came to be used primarily for official purposes such as diplomacy, politics, and other forms of official documentation. It has nevertheless had significant effects on the Greek language as it is still written and spoken today, and both vocabulary and grammatical and syntactical forms have re-entered [[Modern Greek]] via Katharevousa.

===Dialects===
{{double image|right|Distribution of Greek dialects in late Byzantine Empire en.png|195|GrikoSpeakingCommunitiesTodayV4.png|100|Distribution of [[Varieties of Modern Greek|Greek dialects]] during the late Byzantine times (left) and areas in South Italy where [[Griko language]] is still spoken (right).}}

There are a variety of dialects of the Greek language; the most notable include [[Cappadocian Greek language|Cappadocian]], [[Cretan dialect|Cretan Greek]], [[Cypriot Greek]], [[Pontic Greek]], the [[Griko language]] spoken in Southern Italy, and [[Tsakonian language|Tsakonian]], still spoken in the modern prefecture of [[Arcadia]] and widely noted as a surviving regional dialect of [[Doric Greek]].

==Literature==
{{Main|Greek literature}}

Greece has a remarkably rich and resilient literary tradition, extending over 2800 years and through several eras. The Classical era is that most commonly associated with [[Greek Literature]], beginning in 800 BCE and maintaining its influence through to the beginnings of [[Byzantine]] period, whereafter the influence of Christianity began to spawn a new development of the Greek written word. The many elements of a millennia-old tradition are reflected in Modern Greek literature, including the works of the Nobel laureates [[Odysseus Elytis]] and [[George Seferis]].

===Classical Greece===
The first recorded works in the western literary tradition are the [[epic poetry|epic]] poems of [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. Early Greek [[lyric poetry]], as represented by poets such as [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]], was responsible for defining the lyric [[genre]] as it is understood today in western literature. [[Aesop]] wrote his ''[[Fables]]'' in the 6th century BC. These innovations were to have a profound influence not only on Roman poets, most notably [[Virgil]] in his epic poem on the founding of Rome, ''[[The Aeneid]]'', but one that flourished throughout Europe.

Classical Greece is also judged the birthplace of [[theatre]]. [[Aeschylus]] introduced the ideas of [[dialogue]] and interacting characters to playwriting and in doing so, he effectively invented &quot;drama&quot;: his ''[[Oresteia]]'' trilogy of plays is judged his crowning achievement. Other refiners of playwriting were [[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]]. [[Aristophanes]], a comic playwright, defined and shaped the idea of [[comedy]] as a theatrical form.

[[File:Suda.jpg|thumb|left|160px|A page from a 16th-century edition of the 10th century Byzantine [[encyclopaedia]] of the ancient Mediterranean world, the [[Suda]].]]

[[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] are often attributed with developing the modern study of [[history]] into a field worthy of philosophical, literary, and scientific pursuit. [[Polybius]] first introduced into study the concept of [[Military|military history]].

[[Philosophy]] entered literature in the dialogues of [[Plato]], while his pupil [[Aristotle]], in his work the ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', formulated the first set criteria for [[literary criticism]]. Both these literary figures, in the context of the broader contributions of Greek philosophy in the Classical and Hellenistic eras, were to give rise to idea of [[Political Science]], the study of political evolution and the critique of governmental systems.

===Byzantine Greece===
{{Main|Byzantine Literature}}
[[File:Johannes Bessarion aport012.png|thumb|110px|[[Basilios Bessarion]].]]

The growth of Christianity throughout the [[Greco-Roman]] world in the 4th, 5th and 6th centuries, together with the Hellenization of the [[Byzantine Empire]] of the period, would lead to the formation of a unique literary form, combining Christian, Greek, Roman and Oriental (such as the [[Sassanid Dynasty|Persian Empire]]) influences. In its turn, this would promote developments such as Cretan poetry, the growth of poetic satire in the [[Greek East]] and the several pre-eminent historians of the period.

===Modern Greece===
{{Main|Modern Greek literature}}
[[File:Konstantinos Kavafis.jpg|thumb|110px|[[Constantine P. Cavafy]].]]

Modern Greek literature refers to literature written in the [[Greek language]] from the 11th century, with texts written in a language that is more familiar to the ears of [[Greeks]] today than is the language of the early Byzantine times.

It is also influenced by the [[Greek Revolution]] (1821-1830) and the subsequent independence of Greece and as such, by revolutionary themes. The impact of the [[Modern Greek Enlightenment]] is also notable, as well as the influence of the Byzantine Empire's [[acritic songs]], [[Byzantine novel]] and [[Romance (genre)|romance]] (''[[Erotokritos]]'' etc).

Moving into the twentieth century, the modern Greek literary tradition spans the work of [[Constantine P. Cavafy]], considered a key figure of twentieth century poetry, [[Giorgos Seferis]] (whose works and poems aimed to fuse the literature of Ancient and Modern Greece) and [[Odysseas Elytis]], both of whom won the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]. [[Nikos Kazantzakis]] is also considered a dominant figure, with works such as ''[[The Last Temptation of Christ]]'' and ''[[The Greek Passion]]'' receiving international recognition.

==Religion==

===Classical Greece===
[[File:Temple of Hephaestus.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Temple of Hephaestus]] in [[Athens]] is the best-preserved of all ancient Greek temples.]]

Classical Athens may be suggested to have heralded some of the same religious ideas that would later be promoted by [[Christianity]], such as [[Aristotle]]'s invocation of a perfect God, and [[Heraclitus]]' [[Logos]]. [[Plato]] considered there were rewards for the virtuous in the heavens and punishment for the wicked under the earth; the soul was valued more highly than the material body, and the material world was understood to be imperfect and not fully real (illustrated in [[Socrates]]'s [[allegory of the cave]]).

===Hellenistic Greece===
[[Alexander the Great|Alexander]]'s conquests spread classical concepts about the divine, the [[afterlife]], and much else across the eastern Mediterranean area. [[Jews]] and [[early Christians]] alike adopted the name &quot;[[hades]]&quot; when writing about &quot;[[sheol]]&quot; in Greek. [[Greco-Buddhism]] was the cultural [[syncretism]] between [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic culture]] and [[Buddhism]], which developed in the [[Indo-Greek Kingdom]]s. By the advent of [[Christianity]], the four original [[Pentarchy|patriarchates]] beyond Rome used Greek as their church language.

===Modern Greece===

[[File:Broken vases on Holy Saturday in Corfu.jpg|thumb|180px|Shards of pottery vases on the street, after being thrown from the windows of nearby houses. A [[Holy Saturday]] tradition in [[Corfu]].]]

The [[Greek Orthodox Church]], largely because of the importance of Byzantium in Greek history, as well as its role in the revolution, is a major institution in modern Greece. Its roles in society and larger role in overarching Greek culture are very important; a number of Greeks attend Church at least once a month or more and the Orthodox [[Easter]] holiday holds special significance. 

The [[Church of Greece]] also retains limited political influence through the fact the Greek constitution does not have an explicit separation of Church and State; a debate suggested by more conservative elements of the church in the early 2000s about identification cards and whether religious affiliation might be added to them highlights the friction between state and church on some issues; the proposal unsurprisingly was not accepted. A widely publicised set of corruption scandals in 2004 implicating a small group of senior churchmen also increased national debate on introducing a greater transparency to the church-state relationship.

Greek Orthodox Churches dot both the villages and towns of Greece and come in a variety of architectural forms, from older Byzantine churches, to more modern white brick churches, to newer cathedral-like structures with evident Byzantine influence. Greece (as well as Cyprus), also polled as, ostensibly, one of the most religious countries in [[Europe]], according to [[Eurostat]]; however, while the church has wide respect as a moral and cultural institution, a contrast in religious belief with Protestant northern Europe is more obvious than one with Catholic Mediterranean Europe.

Greece also has a significant minority of [[Islam|Muslims]] in [[Eastern Thrace]] (numbering around 100-150,000), with their places of worship guaranteed since the 1923 [[Treaty of Lausanne]]. The Greek state has fully approved the construction a main mosque for the more recent Muslim community of [[Athens]] under the [[freedom of religion]] provisions of the Greek constitution.

==Philosophy, science and mathematics==

The Greek world is widely regarded as having given birth to scientific thought by means of observation, thought, and development of a theory without the intervention of a supernatural force. [[Thales]], [[Anaximander]] and [[Democritus]] were amongst those contributing significantly to the establishment of this tradition. It is also, and perhaps more commonly in the western imagination, identified with the dawn of [[Western Philosophy]], as well as a mapping out of the [[Natural Sciences]]. Greek developments of mathematics continued well up until the decline of the [[Byzantine Empire]]. In the modern era Greeks continue to contribute to the fields of [[Science]], [[Mathematics]] and [[Philosophy]].

===Classical Greece===
{{see also|Greek mathematics|Greek philosophy|Ancient Greek medicine}}
[[File:Aristotle Altemps Inv8575.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Marble bust of [[Aristotle]].]]

The tradition of [[philosophy]] in Ancient Greece accompanied its literary development. Greek learning had a profound influence on [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Middle East]]ern civilizations. The works of [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], and other Greek philosophers profoundly influenced [[Classical civilization|Classical]] thought, the [[Islamic Golden Age]], and the [[Renaissance]].

In [[medicine]], doctors still refer to the [[Hippocratic oath]], instituted by [[Hippocrates]], regarded as foremost in laying the foundations of medicine as a science. [[Galen]] built on Hippocrates' theory of the [[Humorism|four humours]], and his writings became the foundation of medicine in [[Europe]] and the [[Middle East]] for centuries. The physicians [[Herophilos]] and [[Paulus Aegineta]] were pioneers in the study of [[anatomy]], while [[Pedanius Dioscorides]] wrote an extensive treatise on the practice of [[pharmacology]].

The period of [[Classical Greece]] (from 800BC until the rise of [[Macedon]], a Greek state in the north) is that most often associated with Greek advances in science. [[Thales of Miletus]] is regarded by many as the father of [[science]]; he was the first of the ancient philosophers to seek to explain the physical world in terms of natural rather than [[supernatural]] causes. [[Pythagoras]] was a [[mathematician]] often described as the &quot;father of numbers&quot;; it is believed that he had the pioneering insight into the numerical ratios that determine the [[musical scale]], and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] is commonly attributed to him. [[Diophantus|Diophantus of Alexandria]], in turn, was the &quot;father of [[algebra]]&quot;. Many parts of modern [[geometry]] are based on the work of [[Euclid]], while [[Eratosthenes]] was one of the first scientific [[geographer]]s, calculating the [[circumference]] of the [[earth]] and conceiving the first [[maps]] based on scientific principles.

The Hellenistic period, following Alexander's conquests, continued and built upon this knowledge. [[Hipparchus]] is considered the pre-eminent astronomical observer of the ancient world, and was probably the first to develop an accurate method for the prediction of [[solar eclipse]], while [[Aristarchus of Samos]] was the first known [[astronomer]] to propose a [[heliocentric model]] of the [[solar system]], though the [[geocentric model]] of [[Ptolemy]] was more commonly accepted until the seventeenth century. Ptolemy also contributed substantially to [[cartography]] and to the science of [[optics]]. For his part [[Archimedes]] was the first to calculate the value of [[pi|''Ï'']] and a [[geometric series]], and also the earliest known mathematical [[physicist]] discovering the law of [[buoyancy]], as well as conceiving the [[irrigation]] device known as [[Archimedes' screw]].

===Byzantine Greece===

[[File:Plethon autograph.jpg|thumb|160px|An original early 15th century manuscript in the hand of [[Gemistus Pletho|Georgios Gemistos Plethon]].]]

The Byzantine period remained largely a period of preservation in terms of classical Greco-Roman texts; there were, however, significant advances made in the fields of [[Byzantine Medicine|medicine]] and [[History|historical scholarship]]. Theological [[philosophy]] also remained an area of study, and there was, while not matching the achievements of preceding ages, a certain increase in the professionalism of study of these subjects, epitomized by the founding of the University of Constantinople.

Isidore of Miletus and Anthemius of Tralles, the architects of the famous [[Hagia Sophia]] in [[Constantinople]], also contributed towards mathematical theories concerning architectural form, and the perceived mathematical harmony needed to create a multi-domed structure. These ideas were to prove a heavy influence on the Ottoman architect [[Mimar Sinan]] in his creation of the [[Sultan Ahmed Mosque|Blue Mosque]], also in Constantinople. Tralles in particular produced several treatises on the [[Natural Sciences]], as well as his other forays into mathematics such as [[Conic Sections]].

The gradual migration of Greeks from Byzantium to the [[Italian city-states|Italian]] city states following the decline of the Byzantine Empire, and the texts they brought with them combined with the academic positions they held, was a major factor in lighting the first sparks of the [[Italian Renaissance]].

===Modern Greece===
[[File:Caratheodory Constantin Greek.JPG|thumb|160px|[[Constantin CarathÃ©odory]].]]

Greeks continue to contribute to science and technology in the modern world. [[John Argyris]], a Greek mathematician and engineer, was among the creators of the [[finite element analysis]] and the [[direct stiffness method]], relative to physics. Mathematician [[Constantin CarathÃ©odory]] worked in the fields of [[real analysis]], the [[calculus of variations]], and [[measure theory]] in the early 20th century. Biologist [[Fotis Kafatos]] pioneers in the field of molecular cloning and genomics. In medicine, [[Georgios Papanikolaou]] contributed heavily to the development of cancer screening with his [[Pap smear]]. The Greek car designer [[Alec Issigonis]] created the iconic [[Mini]] automobile, while the computer scientist [[Michael Dertouzos]] was amongst the pioneers of the internet. [[Nicholas Negroponte]], chairman of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Media Lab, is one of the founders of the program [[One Laptop Per Child]], a non-profit organisation aiming to extend [[Internet]] access in developing countries.

==Dance==
{{Main|Greek Dances}}

Greece has a continuous history of native dances reaching from antiquity till the modern era. It began in the [[Minoan Civilization|Mycenean period]].

===Classical Greece===
Ancient Greeks believed that dancing was invented by the [[Ancient Greek Religion|Gods]] and therefore associated it with religious ceremony. They believed that the gods offered this gift to select mortals only, who in turn taught dancing to their fellow-men.

Periodic evidence in ancient texts indicates that dance was held in high regard, in particular for its educational qualities. Dance, along with writing, music, and physical exercise, was fundamental to the commenced in a circle and ended with the dancers facing one another. When not dancing in a circle the dancers held their hands high or waved them to left and right. They held cymbals (very like the zilia of today) or a kerchief in their hands, and their movements were emphasized by their long sleeves. As they danced, they sang, either set songs or extemporized ones, sometimes in unison, sometimes in refrain, repeating the verse sung by the lead dancer. The onlookers joined in, clapping the rhythm or singing. Professional singers, often the [[Byzantine Music|musicians]] themselves, composed lyrics to suit the occasion.

Byzantine instruments included the guitar, single, double or multiple flute, sistrum, timpani (drum), psaltirio, Sirigs, lyre, cymbals, keras and kanonaki.

Popular dances of this period included the ''Syrtos'', ''Geranos'', ''Mantilia'' , ''Saximos'', ''Pyrichios'', and ''Kordakas'' . Some of these dances have their origins in the ancient period and are still enacted in some form today.

===Modern Greece===
[[File:Sfakia-dance.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Dancers from [[Crete]].]]

Greece is one of the few places in Europe where the day-to-day role of folk dance is sustained. Rather than functioning as a museum piece preserved only for performances and special events, it is a vivid expression of everyday life. Occasions for dance are usually weddings, family celebrations, and paneyeria (Patron Saints' name days). Dance has its place in ceremonial customs that are still preserved in Greek villages, such as dancing the bride during a wedding and dancing the [[trousseau]] of the bride during the wedding preparations. The [[carnival]] and Easter offer more opportunities for family gatherings and dancing. Greek [[Taverna|taverns]] providing live entertainment often include folk dances in their program.

Regional characteristics have developed over the years because of variances in [[Climate|climatic conditions]], [[Geography of Greece|land morphology]] and people's social lives. In later years, wars, international pacts and consequent movement of populations, and even movements of civil servants around the country, intermingled traditions. People learned new dances, adapted them to their environment, and included them in their feasts. ''Kalamatianos'' and ''Syrtos'' are considered Pan-Hellenic dances and are danced all over the world in diaspora communities. Others have also crossed boundaries and are known beyond the regions where they originated; these include the ''Pentozali'' from [[Crete]], ''Hasapiko'' from Constantinople, ''Zonaradikos'' from [[Thrace]], ''Pyrehios'' from [[Pontos]] and ''Balos'' from the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean islands]].

The avant-garde choreographer, director and dancer [[Dimitris Papaioannou]] was responsible for the critically successful [[Opening Ceremony]] of the 2004 [[Olympic Games]], with a conception that reflected the classical influences on modern and experimental Greek dance forms.

==Music==
{{Main|Music of Greece}}

Greece has a diverse and highly influential musical tradition, with ancient music influencing the [[Roman Empire]], and Byzantine liturgical chants and secular music influencing the [[Renaissance]]. Modern Greek music combines these elements, as well as influences from the [[Middle East]], to carry Greeks' interpretation of a wide range of musical forms.

===Classical Greece===
The history of music in Greece begins once more, as one might expect, with the music of ancient Greece, largely structured on the [[Lyre]] and other supporting [[string instruments]] of the era. Beyond the well-known structural legacies of the [[Pythagoras|Pythagorean scale]], and the related mathematical developments it upheld to define western classical music, relatively little is understood about the precise character of music during this period; we do know, however, that it left, as so often, a strong mark on the culture of [[Rome]]. What has been gleaned about the social role and character of ancient Greek music comes largely from pottery and other forms of [[Greek art]].

===Byzantine Greece===
{{main|Byzantine music}}

[[File:Byzantine Lyra Museo Nazionale.jpg|thumb|left|160px|Earliest known depiction of [[Byzantine lyra|lyra]] in a Byzantine ivory casket. The Byzantine Church music has a strong influence on modern Greek music.]]

The [[Byzantine Music]] is also of major significance to the history and development of European music, as [[Liturgy|liturgical chants]] became the foundation and stepping stone for music of the Renaissance (see: [[Renaissance Music]]). It is also certain that Byzantine music included an extensive tradition of instrumental court music and dance; any other picture would be both incongruous with the historically and archaeologically documented opulence of the Eastern Roman Empire. There survive a few but explicit accounts of secular music. A characteristic example is the accounts of pneumatic organs, whose construction was further advanced in the eastern empire prior to their development in the west following the Renaissance.

===Modern Greece===
[[File:Mikis Theodorakis Fabrik 070004.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Mikis Theodorakis]], popular composer, tried to introduce the [[bouzouki]] into the mainstream culture.]]

A range of domestically and internationally known composers and performers across the musical spectrum have found success in modern Greece, while traditional [[Greek music]] is noted as a mixture of influences from indigenous culture with those of west and east. A few [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] elements can be heard in the traditional songs, ''dhimotikÃ¡'', as well as in the modern [[blues]]y [[rembetika|rembÃ©tika]] music. A well-known Greek musical instrument is the [[bouzouki]]. &quot;Bouzouki&quot; is a descriptive Turkish name, but the instrument itself is probably of Greek origin (from the ancient Greek lute known as ''[[pandoura]]'', a kind of guitar, clearly visible in ancient statues, especially female figurines of the &quot;Tanagraies&quot; playing cord instruments).

Famous Greek musicians and composers of modern era include the central figure of 20th century European modernism [[Iannis Xenakis]], a composer, architect and theorist. [[Maria Callas]], [[Nikos Skalkottas]], [[Mikis Theodorakis]], [[Dimitris Mitropoulos]], [[Manos Hadjidakis]] and [[Vangelis]] also lead twentieth-century Greek contributions, alongside [[Demis Roussos]], [[Nana Mouskouri]], [[Yanni]], [[Georges Moustaki]], [[Eleni Karaindrou]] and others.

The birth of the first School of modern Greek classical music ([[Ionian School (music)|Heptanesean or Ionian School]], Greek:''ÎÏÏÎ±Î½Î·ÏÎ¹Î±ÎºÎ® Î£ÏÎ¿Î»Î®'') came through the [[Ionian Islands]] (notable composers include [[Spyridon Samaras]], [[Nikolaos Mantzaros]] and [[Pavlos Carrer]]), while [[Manolis Kalomiris]] is considered the founder of the ''Greek National School''.

==Education==
{{Main|Education in Greece}}
[[File:Athens academy.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Academy of Athens (modern)|Academy of Athens]] is Greece's national academy and the highest research establishment in the country.]]

[[Education in Greece]] is compulsory for all children 6â15 years old; namely, it includes Primary (Dimotiko) and Lower Secondary (Gymnasio) Education. The school life of the students, however, can start from the age of 2.5 years (pre-school education) in institutions (private and public) called &quot;Vrefonipiakoi Paidikoi Stathmi&quot; (creches). In some Vrefonipiakoi Stathmoi there are also Nipiaka Tmimata (nursery classes) which operate along with the Nipiagogeia (kindergartens).

Post-compulsory [[Secondary Education]], according to the reforms of 1997 and 2006, consists of two main school types: Genika Lykeia (General Upper Secondary Schools) and the Epaggelmatika Lykeia (Vocational Upper Secondary Schools), as well as the Epaggelmatikes Sxoles (Vocational Schools). Musical, Ecclesiastical and Physical Education Gymnasia and Lykeia are also in operation.

Post-compulsory Secondary Education also includes the [[Vocational Education|Vocational Training]] Institutes (IEK), which provide formal but unclassified level of education. These Institutes are not classified as an educational level, because they accept both Gymnasio (lower secondary school) and Lykeio (upper secondary school) graduates according to the relevant specializations they provide. Public higher education is divided into Universities and Technological Education Institutes (TEI). Students are admitted to these Institutes according to their performance at national level examinations taking place at the second and third grade of Lykeio. Additionally, students are admitted to the Hellenic Open University upon the completion of the 22 year of age by drawing lots.

Nea Dimokratia ([[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]), the Greek conservative right political party, has claimed that it will change the law so that private universities gain recognition. Without official recognition, students who have an EES degree are unable to work in the public sector. [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] took some action after [[EU]] intervention, namely the creation of a special government agency which certifies the vocational status of certain EES degree holders. However, their academic status still remains a problem. The issue of full recognition is still an issue of debate among Greek politicians.

{{Main|Politics of Greece}}
[[Image:Athens Parliament 4-2004.JPG|thumb|The building of the [[Hellenic Parliament]] was designed as a Royal Palace for [[Otto of Greece]].]]

Greece is a [[Parliament]]ary [[Republic]] with a president assuming a more ceremonial role than in some other republics, and the Prime Minister chosen from the leader of the majority party in the parliament. Greece has a codified [[constitution]] and a written Bill of Rights embedded within it. The current Prime Minister is [[George Papandreou (junior)]].

The politics of the third [[Hellenic Republic]] have been dominated by two main political parties, the self proclaimed socialists of [[Panhellenic Socialist Movement|PASOK]] and the conservative [[New Democracy (Greece)|New Democracy]]. Until recently{{when|date=January 2011}} PASOK had dominated the political scene, presiding over favourable growth rates economically but in the eyes of critics failing to deliver where unemployment and structural issues such as market liberalization were concerned.

New Democracy's election to government in 2004 has led to various initiatives to modernize the country, such as the education university scheme above as well as labour market liberalization. Politically there has been massive opposition to some of these moves owing to a large, well organized workers' movement in Greece, which distrusts the right wing administration and neo-liberal ideas. The population in general appears to accept many of the initiatives, reflected in governmental support; on the economic front many are so far warming to the reforms made by the administration, which have been largely rewarded with above average Eurozone growth rates. New Democracy were re-elected in September 2007.

A number of other smaller political parties exist. They include the third largest party (''the Communist Party''), which still commands large support from many rural working areas as well as some of the immigrant population in Greece, as well as the far-right ''Popular Orthodox Rally'', with the latter, while commanding a mere three and a half per cent of votes, seeking to capitalise on opposition in some quarters regarding Turkey's EU accession and any tension in the Aegean. There is also a relatively small, but well organized anarchist movement, though its status in Greece has been somewhat exaggerated by media overseas.

The political process is energetically and openly participated in by the people of Greece, while public demonstrations are a continual feature of Athenian life; however, there have been criticisms of a governmental failure to sufficiently involve minorities in political debate and hence a sidelining of their opinions. In general, politics is regarded as an acceptable subject to broach on almost every social occasion, and Greeks are often very vocal about their support (or lack of it) for certain policy proposals, or political parties themselves - this is perhaps reflected in what many consider the rather sensationalist [[Mass media|media]] on both sides of the political spectrum; although this is a feature of most European tabloids.
