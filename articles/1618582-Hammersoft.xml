The '''University of Nebraska at Omaha''' ('''UNO''') is a four-year state university located in Omaha,&amp;nbsp;Nebraska, USA.  Founded in 1908 as Omaha&amp;nbsp;University, the institution became the public '''Municipal University of Omaha''' in 1931. It assumed its current name in 1968 following a merger into the University of Nebraska. The institution has a strong tradition of serving commuter students from within Omaha, but in recent years has developed student housing to better serve students from Nebraska, the United States, and the world for whom the commute is not convenient.  On October 8, 2008, the University of Nebraska at Omaha celebrated its 100th year of existence.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) [http://www.unomaha.edu/100/ University of Nebraska at Omaha Celebrates 100 Years.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Omaha University===

The original Omaha University was founded in 1908 in the [[Kountze Place]] neighborhood of [[North Omaha]]. The first classes were located in the [[Redick Mansion]], once at North 24th and Pratt Streets, from 1909 through 1917. Established a few blocks north of the [[Presbyterian Theological Seminary]], most of the early faculty were recruited from Seminary teachers, as well as the faculty of [[Bellevue College]]. There were 26 students in the first year, most of whom graduated from [[Omaha Central High School|Omaha High School]]. Three of the University's first four presidents were ordained Presbyterian ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.omahahistory.org/History%20at%20a%20Glance%209-2007.pdf &quot;History of Omaha at a glance&quot;], [[Douglas County Historical Society]].

Retrieved 5/29/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Two other buildings on the original campus included Jacobs Hall, a gymnasium erected in 1910, and Joslyn Hall, a classroom building erected in 1917.

Jacobs Hall was a [[gym]]nasium facing North 24th Street that was built in 1910 with $14,000 received from the sale of land contributed by Lillian Maul. The land, the first donation to the University, was near the present West Dodge campus of the university. It was the first new building constructed on the university campus. Joslyn Hall was built with funds contributed by a well-known Omahan, [[George A. Joslyn]]. Donating $25,000 toward the building, Joslyn stipulated the school identify another $25,000 in a year. The building was located just north of [[Redick Hall]] and was finished in January 1917. Joslyn Hall had three stories and a basement with a total of thirty classrooms that accommodated 750 students. The building included chemistry and physics laboratories, an auditorium and music department.&lt;ref name=&quot;Old campus fades into oblivion&quot;&gt;[http://www.unoalumni.org/about_us/flashback/archive/206/ &quot;Old campus fades into oblivion&quot;], ''UNO Alumni Newsletter.''

In the early 1920s a proposed &quot;magnificent campus&quot; was slated for development between 21st and 25th Avenues, bounded by Kountze Park and the [[Carter Lake (Iowa-Nebraska)|Carter Lake Park]]. In 1927, businessmen formed the North Omaha Activities Association in order to redevelop [[Saratoga School]]'s playing field into a football field for the University's football team. With new bleachers built to accommodate a crowd of a thousand, the Saratoga Field was home to OU's football team until 1951.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unoalumni.org/About_Us/Flashback/Archive/238/index.asp Saratoga Field] University of Nebraska at Omaha website.&lt;/ref&gt; The school also served as OU's science call from 1917 to 1926.&lt;ref name=&quot;unoalumni.org&quot;&gt;(1960) [http://www.unoalumni.org/about_us/flashback/archive/208/ &quot;West Dodge Campus Choice Gave Unique Building Design&quot;], ''The Gateway'' - UNO.

Dr. [[Milo Bail]] became president of Omaha University in 1948 and served until 1965. During that time Omaha hotel magnate [[Eugene C. Eppley]]'s [[Eppley Foundation|foundation]] gave more than $1.2 million to the university. After Eppley's passing, the Eppley Foundation donated another $50,000 to recruit distinguished professors.

Retrieved 2/4/08.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952 the national [[Silver Wings]] student organization was founded at UO. In June 1964 Jacobs and Joslyn Halls were the last two original OU buildings at 24th &amp; Pratt Streets to be demolished.  In 1976 the [[Dr. C.C. and Mabel L. Criss Library]] replaced the Eppley Library.

The University moved from the [[North Omaha]] campus to its present main location at 60th and [[Dodge Street]] in 1938. The old campus buildings were used as apartments and offices, and were demolished to make way for a 12-story [[Omaha Housing Authority]] apartment building for the elderly, which was completed in 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;Old campus fades into oblivion&quot;/&gt;

 We will fight, fight, fight for our Mavericks,

 Everyone knows when that old whistle blows,
 We will shout, we will yell, we will scream.
 GO MAVS!

 we will cheer so all fans will know.
 Be it win or lose or draw,
 Everyone for Omaha,
 We will fight for U-N-O.
