'''tcpdump''' is a common [[packet analyzer]] that runs under the [[command line]]. It allows the user to intercept and display [[TCP/IP]] and other packets being transmitted or received over a [[computer network|network]] to which the computer is attached. Distributed under the [[BSD license]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; tcpdump is [[free software]].

Tcpdump works on most [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s: [[Linux]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], [[BSD]], [[Mac OS X]], [[HP-UX]] and [[AIX operating system|AIX]] among others.  In those systems, tcpdump uses the [[libpcap]] library to capture packets. The [[Porting|port]] of tcpdump for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] is called WinDump; it uses [[WinPcap]], the Windows port of libpcap.

==History==
It was originally written in 1987 by [[Van Jacobson]], [[Craig Leres]] and [[Steven McCanne]] who were, at the time, working in the [[Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory]] Network Research Group.

==Common uses==
Tcpdump analyzes network behavior, performance and applications that generate or receive network traffic.  It can also be used for analyzing the network infrastructure itself by determining whether all necessary [[Router (computing)|routing]] is occurring properly, allowing the user to further isolate the source of a problem.

It is also possible to use tcpdump for the specific purpose of intercepting and displaying the communications of another user or computer. A user with the necessary privileges on a system acting as a [[router (computing)|router]] or [[Gateway (computer networking)|gateway]] through which unencrypted traffic such as [[Telnet]] or [[HTTP]] passes can use tcpdump to view login IDs, passwords, the [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]]s and content of websites being viewed, or any other unencrypted information.

The user may optionally apply a [[Berkeley Packet Filter|BPF]]-based filter to limit the number of packets seen by tcpdump; this renders the output more usable on networks with a high volume of traffic.

==Privileges required==
In some [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s, a user must have [[superuser]] privileges to use tcpdump because the packet capturing mechanisms on those systems require elevated privileges.  However, the -Z option may be used to drop privileges to a specific unprivileged user after capturing has been set up.  In other Unix-like operating systems, the packet capturing mechanism can be configured to allow non-privileged users to use it; if that is done, superuser privileges are not required.
