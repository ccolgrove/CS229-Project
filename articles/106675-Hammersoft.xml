'''Lake Havasu City''' is a city in [[Mohave County, Arizona|Mohave County]], [[Arizona]], [[United States]]. According to 2010 Census Bureau estimates, the population of the town is 52,527.  It is served by [[Lake Havasu City Airport]].  Lake Havasu City is geographically isolated from the other cities in Mohave County.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.co.mohave.az.us/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The community first started as an Army Air Corps rest camp during World War II on the shores of [[Lake Havasu]].  Lake Havasu City was established in 1963 by [[Robert P. McCulloch]] (of [[McCulloch Motors Corporation|McCulloch]] chainsaws) as a [[planned community]]. McCulloch had purchased {{convert|3,500|acre|km2}} of property on the east side of [[Lake Havasu]] along Pittsburgh Point, the peninsula that eventually would be transformed into &quot;the island&quot;. The city was incorporated in 1978.

===London Bridge===
A tourist attraction in Lake Havasu City is the [[London Bridge (Lake Havasu City)|London Bridge]], which crosses a 930&amp;nbsp;ft (280 m) long man-made canal that leads from [[Lake Havasu]] (on the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]]) to Thompson Bay. It was bought for US $2.5 million from the [[City of London]] when the bridge was replaced in 1968. The bridge was disassembled, and the marked stones were shipped to Lake Havasu City and reassembled for another US $7 million. It opened in October 1971.

The London Bridge is the second most visited tourist attraction in Arizona, behind only the [[Grand Canyon]].

===Events===
Lake Havasu City is an active destination for a wide range of people. During the spring months, the community is joined by university students during [[Spring Break]].  With its reputation as a party community, Lake Havasu has twice been featured during MTV's Spring Break coverage.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0889616/]&lt;/ref&gt; For boaters, March to September are the prime months on Lake Havasu.
