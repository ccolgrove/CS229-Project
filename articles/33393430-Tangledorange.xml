'''Occupy Austin''' is an [[Occupation (protest)|occupation]] and [[Nonviolent resistance|peaceful protest]] that began on October 6, 2011 at City Hall in [[Austin, Texas]]. It is affiliated with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement that began in [[New York City]], and also with the [[&quot;Occupy&quot; protests]] in the United States and around the world. At the center of the occupation is the General Assembly, where the community comes out and tries to come to consensus on proposals for action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2011/10/12/occupy-austin-members-expand-goals |title=Occupy Austin members expand goals &amp;#124; The Daily Texan |publisher=Dailytexanonline.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background and history==
{{main|&quot;Occupy&quot; protests}}
The original intent of Occupy Austin, as with many of the other &quot;Occupy&quot; movements, was to denounce the role that large corporations had in promulgating the financial crisis. The protesters in Austin, as in other movements throughout the world, have described themselves as the &quot;99 percent,&quot; a reflection of their belief that the financial system rewards the richest 1 percent at the expense of everyone else.&lt;ref name=&quot;statesman1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/occupy-austin-protesters-air-grievances-without-drawing-police-1900452.html |title=Occupy Austin protesters air grievances without drawing police ire |publisher=Statesman.com |date=2011-08-24 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the features the Occupy Austin Event had at the beginning was that the occupation began progressing with little interference from the police and the city government. The organizers and occupiers had been mainly cooperative with the police, and some of the protesters had expressed appreciation for the role that the [[Austin Police Department]] has played during the occupation.&lt;ref name=&quot;statesman1&quot;/&gt;

On September 29th, 38 people were arrested for resisting new rules imposed by City Hall Management.

A discussion with an Austin Police Officer monitoring the situation indicates that a large percentage of the people actually occupying the City Hall area are transients who have taken advantage of the situation to camp downtown and partake of the free food provided.  The influx of the homeless has had a negative impact on the cleanliness of the area and the general cooperation that has existed between the demonstrators and the Austin Police. The Police are attempting to preserve the rights of the protesters and protect the interests of the City.  The protesters have remained peaceful and respectful of the Austin Police. The problems that are developing are a result of the damage done to the landscaping of the area by the large number of people, the unsanitary conditions of overuse and the increased expense of police presence and overtime pay for officers at a time when the City is experiencing budget problems.

==Mission and Values==

The following mission and values were ratified by the Occupy Austin General Assembly:

'''Solidarity Statement'''

We stand in solidarity with our brothers and sisters who occupy Wall Street and occupy around the world. We are dedicated to non-violently reclaiming control of our governments from the financial interests that have corrupted them. We demand that our public servants recognize that the people are the supreme authority.

'''Core Values'''

# We are committed to resisting the monied corruption of our democracy
# We are not a political institution or action group â to include the local, state and federal level
# We are committed to non-violent forms of resistance â including civil disobedience if necessary
# These core values are NOT subject to change unless on a national level and in solidarity with NYC

'''Goals and Demands'''

# This movement is about democracy. We demand that the government be truly responsive to those it represents. We demand an end to the massive corporate influence blocking the voice of the people by eliminating corporate personhood and limiting monetary contributions to political campaigns and lobbying.
# This movement is about economic security. We demand effective reforms to prevent banks and financial institutions from causing future economic crises.
# This movement is about corporate responsibility. We demand strict repercussions for corporations and institutions who cause serious financial damage to our country and its taxpayers.
# This movement is about financial fairness. We demand tax reforms to ensure that corporations and the wealthy pay their fair share in taxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Occupy Austin: Mission and Values |url=http://occupyaustin.org/wiki/doku.php?id=groups:mission_and_values:start |title=Occupy Austin Wiki: Mission and Values Working Group |publisher=Occupy Austin |date=2011-11-08 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Meredith Hoffmann |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/nyregion/occupy-wall-street-trying-to-settle-on-demands.html?_r=2&amp;hp |title=Protesters Debate What Demands, if Any, to Make |publisher=New York Times |date=2011-10-16 |accessdate=2011-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 13, 2011, at roughly 2:45 AM 4 protestors were arrested by [[Austin Police Department]] authorities when they refused to move as ordered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2011/10/13/occupy_austin_demonstrators_be.html |title=Austin news, sports, weather, Longhorns, business |publisher=Statesman.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Week 2 (October 13â19)===
On October 13, 2011, the [[Library of Congress]] chose Occupy Austin's main web portal for inclusion in the historic collection of Internet materials focusing on public policy topics, and commenced archiving the web portal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrea Ball |url=http://www.statesman.com/news/local/occupy-austin-whirling-into-action-and-chaos-at-1924154.html |title=Occupy Austin, whirling into action and chaos at a public space near you |publisher=Austin American-Statesman |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, 2011, a march was held to the [[JPMorgan Chase Tower]] and to the [[Texas State Capitol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://austin.ynn.com/content/top_stories/280931/occupy-austin-marches-to-chase-bank--capitol/ |title=Occupy Austin marches to Chase Bank, Capitol - YNN - Your News Now |publisher=Austin.ynn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 1000 people participated in the march.

{{expand section|date=October 2011}}

===Week 4 (October 27-November 3)===
On October 28, the City of Austin declared in a memo that new restrictions had been approved and would begin being enforced. These included a prohibition of sleeping on the mezzanine, exhibiting unattended signs, and the operation of food tables during certain hours.&lt;ref name='Vess 2011-10-31'&gt;{{cite news | first = Jessica | last = Vess | title = Occupy Austin organizers meet with city leaders | date = 2011-10-31 | url = http://www.kvue.com/home/Occupy-Austin-organizers-to-meet-with-city-leaders-132911553.html | work = KVUE News |accessurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62ro4dyl2|accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 30 at approximately 12:30 AM, 18 demonstrators at the Austin City Hall mezzanine, some of whom were forming an impromptu [[human chain]] around three food tables, were arrested on charges of [[trespass|criminal trespassing]]. Subsequently, 20 additional demonstrators were arrested for refusing to vacate the area for cleaning.&lt;ref name='Hadjigeorge 2011-10-31'&gt;{{cite news | first = Nick | last = Hadjigeorge | title = Occupy Austin demonstrators arrested after law confusion | date = 2011-10-31 | url = http://www.dailytexanonline.com/news/2011/10/31/occupy-austin-demonstrators-arrested-after-law-confusion | work = The Daily Texan | accessdate = 2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='HC 2011-10-30'&gt;{{cite news | title = 38 arrested in Occupy Austin demonstration | date = 2011-10-30 | publisher = [[Houston Chronicle]] | url = http://www.chron.com/news/article/38-arrested-in-Occupy-Austin-demonstration-2243747.php | work = Associated Press | accessdate = 2011-10-31|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62qNzuRYQ|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62qPWWyHX|archivedate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As per the terms of their charges, those arrested were barred from returning to the protest area for at least two years.&lt;ref name='Buczynski 2011-10-30'&gt;{{cite news | first = Beth | last = Buczynski | title = Police Clash With OWS Camps In Denver &amp; Austin | date = 2011-10-30 | url = http://www.care2.com/causes/police-clash-with-ows-camps-in-denver-austin.html | work = Care2 | accessdate = 2011-11-01|archivedate=2011-11-01|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/62riXaYXm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing the public in a press conference, Austin [[chief of police]] Art Acevedo stated âAustin is very fortunate that we have an activist community that understands that violence doesnât get you anything,â but that âonce youâre given the criminal trespassing warning, you either comply or engage in civil disobedience. Thatâs what 38 folks did yesterday and thatâs why they were arrested,â reaffirming his position that &quot;weâre very kind, but weâre going to do our job.&quot;&lt;ref name='Foster 2011-10-31'&gt;{{cite news | first = Paul | last = Foster | title = Occupy, APD agree cooperation is needed | date = 2011-10-31 | url = http://austin.ynn.com/content/top_stories/281180/occupy--apd-agree-cooperation-is-needed | work = YNN Austin | accessdate = 2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release issued by the Occupy Austin General Assembly, spokesperson Jonathan Cronin asserted that &quot;on Thursday, Chief of Police Acevedo had addressed the GA and had every opportunity to raise the proposed changes and answer questions about them. His silence about them, followed by these actions, has been taken [by many] as a provocation,&quot; and that the incident was &quot;entirely out of character from the good faith dealings we have had with city and police officials until now. Imposing these [new restrictions] apparently without due process is unnecessary and inflammatory.â&lt;ref name='OAGA 2011-10-30'&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://occupyaustin.org/2011/10/occupy-austin-statement-on-apd-city-hall-%E2%80%9Ccleanup%E2%80%9D/ | title = Occupy Austin Statement on APD City Hall &quot;Cleanup&quot; | date = 2011-10-30 | accessdate = 2011-11-01 | publisher = Occupy Austin General Assembly | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62ri3Tak1 | archivedate = 2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jim Harrington, director of the [[Texas Civil Rights Project]], issued a statement saying that &quot;If the police couldn't handle the situation, then it would have been appropriate to bring in a mediator. It's an absurd waste of tax money to spend police time and energy to break up a pure first amendment demonstration.&quot;&lt;ref name='Alberts 2011-10-30'&gt;{{cite news | first = Steve | last = Alberts | title = 37 Occupy Austin protesters arrested | date = 2011-10-30 | url = http://www.kvue.com/news/38-Occupy-Austin-protestors-arrested--132885918.html | work = KVUE News | accessdate = 2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 31, a fundraiser with live music performances was held to help cover legal expenses for those recently arrested.&lt;ref name='Fundraiser 2011-10-31'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://occupyaustin.org/general-assembly/ | title = Legal Fundraiser | accessdate = 2011-10-31 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/62qUpMiKO | archivedate = 2011-10-31 |quote=Occupy Austin will have a fundraiser Monday night (Oct 31) at City Hall to raise additional funds for bail bonds, for any unlawful arrests made on occupy protestors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Week 5 (November 4â10)===
On November 5, demonstrators marched to Wells Fargo in observation of [[Bank Transfer Day]].&lt;ref name='Robertson 2011-11-05'&gt; {{cite news | first = Sebastian | last = Robertson | title = Occupy Austin marches to Wells Fargo for Bank Transfer Day | date = 2011-11-05 | url = http://austin.ynn.com/content/headlines/281293/occupy-austin-marches-to-wells-fargo-for-bank-transfer-day | work = YNN Austin | accessdate = 2011-11-10|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/635FWVt3d|archivedate=2011-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
