In addition to his duties at ESPN, he is the Assistant Vice President of Marketing Communications at [[Saint Joseph's University]] and does color commentary for men's basketball for the [[Saint Joseph's Hawks]]. Lunardi correctly predicted all 65 teams to appear in the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008 NCAA Tournament]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/17/sports/ncaabasketball/17notebook.html | title=Big East Stands Tallest With 8 Bids | author=Evans, Thayer | date=March 17, 2008 | accessdate=2009-03-15 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; while correctly selecting 63 out the 65 teams in the [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2009 field]] by placing both Creighton and St. Mary's incorrectly in his final bracket on March 15.&lt;ref&gt;http://insider.espn.go.com/ncb/insider/news/story?id=3981856&amp;&amp;appRedirect=http%3a%2f%2finsider.espn.go.com%2fncb%2finsider%2fnews%2fstory%3fid%3d3981856&lt;/ref&gt;  Lunardi correctly selected 64 of the 65 teams in the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2010 NCAA Tournament]], believing that Illinois would receive the final at-large bid, while in reality, Florida did.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/blog/collegebasketballnation/post/_/id/6992/bracket-winners-and-losers&lt;/ref&gt;

Lunardi's first bracket for ESPN received 250,000 hits in the first 90 minutes posted. His brackets sometimes receive millions of hits over the course of a season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/03/03/AR2007030300980_pf.html | title=Need for Information Is Creating a Bracket | author=Prisbell, Eric | date=March 4, 2007 | accessdate=2009-03-15 | work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he has been a fixture on ESPN's ''Bracketology'' program and on ''[[SportsCenter]]'', especially during the months of February and March in the run-up to the NCAA Tournament.&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/bracketology&lt;/ref&gt;

One predecessor in &quot;Bracketology,&quot; to Lunardi would be the creator of CollegeRPI.com, Jerry Palm.
