'''''The Amazing Race 17''''' is the seventeenth installment of the reality television show ''[[The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series)|The Amazing Race]]''. ''The Amazing Race 17'' features 11 teams of two, each with a pre-existing relationship, in a race around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/cbs_casting/amazing_race/Application_Form.pdf|title=Application form|author=CBS.com|accessdate=2010-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development and filming===
CBS renewed the 17th edition of ''The Amazing Race'' on January 25, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbspressexpress.com/div.php/cbs_entertainment/release?id=23969|title=CBS Renews the 17th Edition of The Amazing Race|author=CBSPressExpress.com|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season premiered on September 26, 2010 with a special 90-minute episode; it returned to its regular hour-long format the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2010/07/22/cbs-reveals-fall-premiere-dates/|title=CBS reveals fall premiere dates|first=Lynette|last=Rice|date=2010-07-22|accessdate=2010-07-22|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This season spanned {{convert|32000|mi|km}} while racing across four continents, with first-time visits to [[Ghana]] and [[Bangladesh]], and for the first time in the show's history, teams crossed the [[Arctic Circle]].&lt;ref name=TAR17Cast&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvwatch.people.com/2010/09/01/amazing-race-season-17-miss-kentucky-kevjumba/|title=Beauty Queens, TV Hosts Set for New Season of The Amazing Race|last=Nudd|first=Tim|publisher=[[People (magazine)|''People'']]|date=2010-09-01|accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Filming began on May 26, 2010, with the starting line at the Eastern Point Yacht Club in [[Gloucester, Massachusetts|Gloucester]], [[Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Gloucester&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goodmorninggloucester.wordpress.com/2010/05/26/good-morning-gloucester-exclusive-gloucester-fishing-boats-transport-cbs-amazing-race-contestants-to-race-kick-off/|title=Good Morning Gloucester Exclusive â Gloucester Fishing Boats Transport CBS Amazing Race Contestants To Race Kick Off|publisher=GoodMorningGloucester|accessdate=2010-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; making this the first season since ''[[The Amazing Race 11|The Amazing Race All-Stars]]'' to start in a city other than Los Angeles and ended on June 15, 2010 with the finish line at [[Los Angeles]], California.

Prior to the ''Race''{{'}}s broadcast, CBS posted a short preview video clip from an episode on the Internet, showing Brook and Claire competing at a watermelon launching challenge using an elastic slingshot.  The clip showed Claire, working the slingshot, being hit in the face full-on with a watermelon after it failed to launch correctly, leaving her momentarily stunned but otherwise not seriously injured.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail video&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1310570/Thats-got-hurt-Amazing-Race-contestant-gruesome-run-watermelon.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|title=That's got to hurt!

Phil Keoghan began both the season and the video background segments of the contestants while standing on the grass mall of [[Castle Hill (Ipswich, Massachusetts)|Castle Hill]] in [[Ipswich, Massachusetts]].

Two new game elements were introduced in this season. The first is the [[The Amazing Race#Express Pass|Express Pass]], awarded to the team who finished first on the first Leg. This item would allow the team to skip any Detour, Roadblock, or Route Marker task before Leg 8. Dating couple Jill and Thomas won the Express Pass, which they later used to bypass the Beds Detour on Leg 4. Another new element is the Double U-Turn, where two teams are allowed to use U-Turns in a single race leg. 

During the Leg 3 Pit Stop in Ghana, teams helped renovate the school that they visited during the leg.

===Cast===
{{see also|List of The Amazing Race (U.S. TV series) contestants}}
Applications were due on February 4, 2010. Semi-finalist interviews were held sometime in March 2010 and the final casting interviews took place in [[Los Angeles]] around March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs.com/cbs_casting/amazing_race/Eligibility_Requirements.pdf|title=Eligibility Requirements|author=CBS.com|accessdate=2010-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; From there, 11 teams were selected as contestants and filming took place around May to June 2010.

The cast included a team of home shopping hosts, Internet entertainer [[KevJumba|Kevin Wu]] â popularly known as &quot;KevJumba&quot; â and his father Michael; [[Ivy League]] [[a cappella]] singers; and a birth mother and daughter who recently reunited following an adoption over 20 years earlier.&lt;ref name=TAR17Cast/&gt;  This was the first season ever without a married couple. There were 3 beauty queens competing: [[Mallory Ervin]], who competed in [[Miss America 2010]], where she placed fourth runner-up; [[Brook Roberts]], who competed in [[Miss America 2005]]; and [[Stephanie Smith (pageant titleholder)|Stephanie Smith]], who was [[Miss South Carolina USA]] 2009.

Chad Waltrip proposed to Stephanie Smith during the course of the race; they were married on November 20, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20445511,00.html|title=Amazing Race's Chad and Stephanie Are Married and Expecting | first = Carrie | last = Bell | work = [[People (magazine)|People]] | accessdate=2010-11-29 | date=2010-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gary &amp; Mallory raced again in ''[[The Amazing Race 18|The Amazing Race: Unfinished Business]]'' among a cast of returning teams from seasons 12â17 where they survived a non-elimination leg in [[Vienna, Austria]] and finished the race in 3rd place.

{{refbegin}}
#{{note|1}} While neither Ron nor Tony was shown performing the Roadblock in Leg 1, the official website lists Ron as the team member who completed the task.
#{{note|2}} Jill &amp; Thomas elected to use the Express Pass to bypass the Detour in Leg 4.
#{{note|3}} While Nick &amp; Vicki came in last in a non-elimination leg, they did not face a Speed Bump in the following leg. Post-race interviews revealed that the Speed Bump was waived, and that everyone's placement in that leg was equalized at the Detour, in compensation for various production difficulties in the previous leg affecting all of the teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/the-amazing-race-leg-omitted-speed-bump-due-production-issues-11697.php|title=Reality TV World talks to someone involved with the race.|date=2010-11-09|accessdate=2010-11-23|publisher=Reality TV World}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the problems involved the judge at the Classical Music Detour who made erroneous calls causing teams (Nick &amp; Vicki in particular) to spend more time at the task than they needed to.
#{{note|4}} Brook and Claire took a taxi to the Tower to the Church of the Savior on Blood. But when they found it the clue told them to walk, they asked their cab driver to go back to the Bank Bridge to 1 Vladimirsky Prospekt Tower and performed the task correctly. They checked in the mat in 2nd-place without Phil giving them a 30 minute penalty.
#{{note|5}} Chad &amp; Stephanie initially arrived 6th, but were not allowed to check in because they did not pay their taxi fare and had also left their bags in the taxi. In this time, Michael &amp; Kevin arrived to check in, but had been issued multiple penalties. When they returned, Chad &amp; Stephanie were told they had been issued a 30-minute penalty for taking a taxi from 1 Vladimirsky Prospekt Tower to the Church of the Savior on Blood, which was explicitly prohibited in the clue. However, because Michael &amp; Kevin had a longer penalty, Chad &amp; Stephanie were checked in for a 6th-place finish; their penalty was instead applied to their starting time in Leg 8. Meanwhile, Michael &amp; Kevin arrived at the Pit Stop in 6th while Chad &amp; Stephanie were turned away. However, they were issued two 30-minute penalties: one for hiring a taxi to lead them from Bank Bridge to 1 Vladimirsky Prospekt Tower and the other for taking a taxi from the Tower to the Church of the Savior on Blood. While they sat out their penalty, Chad &amp; Stephanie returned and were allowed to check in, resulting in Michael &amp; Kevin being eliminated.
#{{note|6}} Chad &amp; Stephanie left the Pit Stop in Saint Petersburg over 2 hours late because they accidentally overslept. This did not affect their overall placement in Leg 8 since they were the last to depart. During Leg 8, Chad proposed to Stephanie, who accepted. Their relationship title was changed from &quot;Newly Dating&quot; to &quot;Engaged&quot;.
#{{note|7}} Jill &amp; Thomas initially arrived 1st, but were issued a 30-minute penalty for paying a taxi driver to lead them to the Pit Stop, which was explicitly prohibited in the clue. Chad &amp; Stephanie checked in for a 1st-place finish during their penalty, dropping Jill &amp; Thomas to 2nd.
#{{note|8}} Nick &amp; Vicki elected to forfeit the Detour because they were too exhausted to continue. They arrived at the Pit Stop last, but were notified that it was a non-elimination leg. The 6-hour penalty they would have taken from the Detour was instead applied to their starting time in Leg 11.
#{{note|9}} Brook &amp; Claire initially arrived 1st, but were issued a 30-minute penalty for taking a taxi to their Detour location when the clue instructed teams to travel either on foot or take [[Seoul Metropolitan Subway|the subway]]. Jill &amp; Thomas checked in for a 1st-place finish during their penalty, dropping Brook &amp; Claire to 2nd.
#{{note|10}} Nick &amp; Vicki's departure time was not shown in Leg 11, because they departed 6 hours later and were way behind Brook &amp; Claire's departure, which was at 5:26 pm, due to the penalty applied to their starting time in that leg (see note 8). Also, by the time they made it to the Seung-il Bridge in [[Cheorwon]], all the other teams had already checked in at the Pit Stop and it had become too dark for them to safely perform some of the tasks. During the broadcast of the leg, they were only shown performing the Speed Bump and then immediately checking in at the Pit Stop to be eliminated. In interviews after the episode was broadcast, they revealed that they did the Detour as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/the-amazing-race/nick-and-vicki-of-the-amazing-38812.aspx|title=Nick and Vicki of 'The Amazing Race' Only Regret Taking the Penalty|date=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Amazing-Race-Nick-Vicki-1026463.aspx|title=''Amazing Race''{{'}}s Nick and Vicki: We Regret Taking the Six-Hour Penalty|first=Joyce|last=Eng|date=2010-12-06|accessdate=2010-12-07|publisher=[[TV Guide]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Elimination Station==
&lt;!--Warning, do not add false statements here &quot;e.g. a team was not sent to the villa.&quot;--&gt;
After elimination, the first five eliminated teams were sequestered at a villa in [[Cancun]], [[Mexico]], to await the finale. CBS posted short videos on its website after each episode aired in the [[Pacific Time Zone]] to show the eliminated teams interacting at the villa.

*After '''Leg 1''', ''Ron'' &amp; ''Tony'' were the first team eliminated and were sent to the villa. They expressed their disappointment in being the first eliminated team, but decided to make the most of their situation. After they settled into the villa, they decided to go kayaking, remarking how much easier it was compared to the [[coracle]] that they unsuccessfully manned during the race. Afterward, Ron and Tony sat by the pool and tried to predict who would be the first to join them in the villa; they agreed that it could be anyone.
*After '''Leg 2''', ''Andie'' &amp; ''Jenna'' were the second team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Ron and Tony welcomed them, glad to finally have another team in the villa to keep them company. Andie and Jenna revealed that they had only recently met, which shocked and moved both Ron and Tony. Andie and Jenna talked at length about their relationship over dinner with Ron and Tony, with Andie revealing the circumstances surrounding Jenna's adoption, and that she has 10 other children.
*'''Leg 3''' was a non-elimination leg; hence, no new teams were sent to the villa. Ron and Tony gave Andie and Jenna [[salsa (dance)|salsa dancing]] lessons. Afterward, Andie and Jenna sat by the pool and discussed their relationship.
*After '''Leg 4''', ''Connor'' &amp; ''Jonathan'' were the third team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Prior to their arrival, Ron, Tony, Andie, and Jenna went on a [[whale shark]] watching excursion, but after Andie and Jenna became [[seasickness|seasick]] from the rough waves, everyone returned to the villa without seeing any. Later, Connor and Jonathan arrived and shared the song they sang for Phil when they were eliminated. Connor and Jonathan then recounted what happened on their last leg, claiming that the remaining teams were starting to become more cutthroat â news which disappointed Andie and Jenna.
*After '''Leg 5''', ''Katie'' &amp; ''Rachel'' were the fourth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. Before their arrival, the three eliminated teams went to Kings Bath, where legend holds that the King bathed his children. Afterward, the three teams speculated on who would show up next, wanting another &quot;fun&quot; team to join them in the villa. Katie and Rachel arrived and immediately expressed how angry and disappointed they were to be eliminated, ignoring the other eliminated teams' attempts to console them. This irritated Ron and Tony, who claimed that Katie and Rachel's bitter attitudes were bringing a negative energy to the house. Later, Katie and Rachel admitted that they ''did'' enter the villa in a foul mood, but did not regret anything they had said, further bemoaning the fact that they were knocked out of the race.
*'''Leg 6''' was a non-elimination leg; hence, no new teams were sent to the villa. The group played a game of [[Water Volleyball|water volleyball]] together in the villa's pool. Afterward, they went to the beach. Katie and Rachel, still bitter about being eliminated, said that they did not want one of the remaining all-female teams to win the race, since Katie and Rachel wanted to be the first all-female winners.
*After '''Leg 7''', ''Michael'' &amp; ''Kevin'' were the fifth team eliminated and were sent to the villa. After the other teams went [[snorkeling]] during the day, Katie and Rachel continued to state that they wanted an all-female team (specifically Brook and Claire) to be eliminated next, as they still were upset that they personally would not be the first all-female team to win; the two girls were disappointed when they saw Michael and Kevin arrive. Kevin stated his disappointment at their elimination due to their hour-long penalty, while Michael joked that he was glad to finally be done with the stresses of racing. While alone, Kevin continued to say he wished they had not been eliminated so they could have potentially gone to Asia (specifically China) and have an advantage, but Michael told him not to dwell on it. The next day, the eliminated teams visited [[Punta Sur]], where Katie and Rachel spoke with Michael and Kevin about their elimination. Michael told them that they should not dwell on their loss, and that it should be an experience that will help them by teaching them how to accept even the biggest disappointments in life.
*After '''Leg 8''', ''Gary'' &amp; ''Mallory'' were the sixth team eliminated. The teams gathered around a phone, waiting for a call to see who was eliminated. Before the call, Jenna stated that she and Rachel had dreams the previous night that either Gary and Mallory or Brook and Claire were eliminated. Katie and Rachel stated, again, that they wanted Brook and Claire to be eliminated. Everyone was surprised when Gary and Mallory called, and told the teams that it was the hardest leg ever, and that they traveled for 16 hours and ended up losing to Nat and Kat with minutes to spare. After the call, the teams continued to comment on Katie and Rachel's obsession that an all-female team should not win the race this season. The next day, the eliminated teams went down to the docks to pick up an [[amberjack]] and then cook it in the traditional [[Maya people|Mayan]] [[Tikin Xic]] style. Once the food was prepared, Andie told everyone that it reminded her of home and being with family, and that the eliminated teams were her substitute family, and Connor joked that she was their substitute birth mom. Later, Ron and Tony spoke with Andie on her relationship with Jenna, and Andie said that whatever Jenna wanted to do from this point on was fine with her.
*After '''Leg 9''', ''Chad'' &amp; ''Stephanie'' were the seventh team eliminated. Connor and Jonathan spoke about how they feel that the fact that they did not attend their graduation at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] makes it better that they did not have the transition from college student into adulthood. Later, the eliminated teams went to a restaurant named [[Alux]], built in a [[cenote]], and Jenna had everyone around the table say what they learned from their time on the Race.
*'''Leg 10''' was a non-elimination leg, but this Elimination Station featured eliminated teams waiting for the phone call and Chad and Stephanie calling the villa after their elimination in Leg 9. They told the other eliminated teams how being U-Turned by Nat &amp; Kat led to their elimination, and then shared the news about their engagement. Ron joked with them by asking if the elimination affected their engagement. The eliminated teams discussed who they wanted in the top 3, with Nat &amp; Kat and Brook &amp; Claire both mentioned, with jokes made towards Katie &amp; Rachel's dislike that a girl-girl team might win and that it was not going to be them. Later, all the eliminated teams packed up and prepared for their flight to the final destination city. Michael finally admitted to Kevin that if he were more confident in himself, they might have been able to go farther in the Race. Andie and Jenna were glad that they would be returning home soon, and Jenna expressed how she felt about her relationship with her biological mother. As the eliminated teams left he villa, all of them speculated on what the final destination would be, with guesses ranging from somewhere in [[Arizona]] to [[Seattle]] to [[New York City]].
*After '''Leg 11''', ''Nick'' &amp; ''Vicki'' were the eighth and final team eliminated. Elimination Station showed the five eliminated teams arriving at the End City in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. After arriving in Los Angeles, the teams checked in to a hotel, settled into their rooms, and awaited the phone call from the eighth team eliminated. Ron commented that he and Tony are in their home city; Kevin commented that there would be a lot of interesting things to do in Los Angeles, while also saying to his father what it would be like if they were still racing; and Andie and Jenna discussed how their future relationship would develop. Later, the teams gathered to get the call from the field to learn that Nick &amp; Vicki had been eliminated. Vicki mentions how she had gotten sick in the previous leg, and that coupled with a penalty contributed to their loss. Nick said that he believed that Jill &amp; Thomas would win the race, as they had been coming in first lately, but Vicki said that she thinks Nat &amp; Kat would win. The eliminated teams joked that Rachel would physically attack either Brook &amp; Claire or Nat &amp; Kat if they came across the finish line first, although Rachel said she was no longer upset that a girl-girl team could win this season.
*'''Leg 12''' was the final leg of ''The Amazing Race 17''. Elimination Station showed the Finish Line that takes place in [[Greystone Mansion]]. Gary &amp; Mallory, Chad &amp; Stephanie, and Nick &amp; Vicki reunited with the other eliminated teams. Andie asked to see Stephanie's engagement ring, and she told the others that they had gotten in first place that leg and won a trip to Belize for their honeymoon. Tony led the eliminated teams in a dance before waiting for the remaining teams to cross the finish line. All the eliminated teams were waiting to find out who they think will cross the Finish Line first and win the $1 million. When they find out that Nat &amp; Kat crossed the finish line first and win the $1 million, everyone congratulated them on being the first all-female team to win the $1 million and the race. Rachel, although still upset that she and Katie were not that team, said she was still happy for their win. The teams then greeted Brook &amp; Claire as they crossed the finish line in 2nd Place, with everyone noting that the top two teams were both women teams. When Jill &amp; Thomas finally crossed the finish line in 3rd Place, Thomas conceded that even though he and Jill were top competitors, Nat &amp; Kat and Brook &amp; Claire were truly the top two teams. Teams expressed their opinions about the final three teams at the Finish Line along with their joys and disappointments about the race, and the learning experiences they could draw from it.
