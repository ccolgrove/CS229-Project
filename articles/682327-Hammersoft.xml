'''Highway 26''', also known as the '''Barkerville Highway''', is a minor east-west [[highway]] in the [[Cariboo|North Cariboo]] region of the [[British Columbia Interior|Central Interior of British Columbia]], [[Canada]].  First opened in [[1967]], it provides access to the community of [[Wells, British Columbia|Wells]] and the famous gold rush town of [[Barkerville, British Columbia|Barkerville]] at the foot of the [[Cariboo Mountains]], respectively 75 and 82&amp;nbsp;km (47 and 51&amp;nbsp;mi) east of the highway's junction with [[British Columbia Highway 97|Highway 97]] at [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]].  Also accessed by the route is [[Bowron Lakes Provincial Park]], a popular canoeing expedition circuit, the cutoff for which is between Barkerveill and Wells.  Since Highway 26 is very lightly travelled, it has not needed any major improvements since its opening.  Its route is approximately the same as that of the [[Cariboo Wagon Road]].
