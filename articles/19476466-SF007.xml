'''Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware''' ('''MBAM''') is a [[computer application]] that finds and removes [[malware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW&quot;/&gt; Made by Malwarebytes Corporation, it was released in January 2008. It is available in a free version, which scans for and removes malware when started manually, and a paid version, which provides scheduled scans, real-time protection and a flash memory scanner.

== Overview ==
MBAM is intended to find [[malware]] that other anti-virus and anti-spyware programs generally miss, including [[rogue security software]], [[adware]], and [[spyware]]. MBAM therefore does not interfere with existing anti-virus and anti-spyware programs on the computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malwarebytes.org/about.php|title=Malwarebytes Corporation|publisher=MalwareBytes|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2356509,00.asp | title=Free Antivirus and Antispyware | author=Neil J. Rubenking | publisher=PC Magazine | date=2009-12-02 | accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MBAM is available in both a free and a paid edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,70033-order,4-page,101-c,utilities/description.html|title=editorial review of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware|publisher=PC World|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The free edition must be run manually, while the paid version can automatically perform scheduled scans.  The paid version also adds real-time protection, IP based blocking to prevent access to malicious web sites and a flash memory scan option, which only scans the open services, programs and drivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET&quot;/&gt;

{{anchor|Language availabilities}} MBAM is available in Arabic, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish and Turkish.&lt;ref name=&quot;homePage&quot;/&gt;

== Reception ==
*[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]'s Preston Gralla wrote that &quot;Using Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware is simplicity itself&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;PCW&quot;/&gt;
*[[CNET]] cited Malwarebytes as being useful against the [[MS Antivirus]] malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.download.com/8301-2007_4-10050473-12.html?tag=mncol | title = Take a 'byte' out of malware | first = Seth last = Rosenblatt | date = 2008-09-24 | work = The Download Blog | publisher = CNET | accessdate = 2008-11-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CNET awarded it April 2009 Editor's Choice along with 25 other computer applications&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=cool_techie23 |date=December 3, 2009 |url=http://download.cnet.com/Malwarebytes-Anti-Malware/3000-8022_4-10804572.html?tag=mncol;txt |title=Malwarebytes Anti-Malware&amp;nbsp;â Free software downloads and software reviews&amp;nbsp;â CNET Download.com |publisher=Download.cnet.com |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNET2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/editors-choice/ |title=CNET Editors' Choice Awards 2009 Winners |publisher=Reviews.cnet.com |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bleeping Computer]] has listed Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware as a method of removing fake security applications such as MS Antivirus&lt;ref name=&quot;bleepcomp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/malware-removal/uninstall-antivirus-2009|title=How to remove Antivirus 2009|coauthors=Grinler|date=June 28, 2008|publisher=bleepingcomputer.com|language=EN|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bleepingcomputer.com/malware-removal/remove-spyware-protect-2009 |title=How to remove Spyware Protect 2009 (Uninstall Instructions) |publisher=Bleepingcomputer.com |date= |accessdate=2009-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Mark Gibbs of [[Network World]] gave Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware 4 out of 5 and wrote that &quot;It does the job and only the lack of a detailed explanation of what it has found stops it from getting 5 out of 5.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.networkworld.com/columnists/2009/010709-gearhead.html?hpg1=bn|title=Malwarebytes finds pesky Trojan|last=Gibbs|first=Mark|date=Jan. 7, 2009|work=Gearhead|publisher=Network World|page=2|language=EN|accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[PC Magazine]] gave Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware 3.5 out of 5, pointing out that although the product is good at removing malware and [[scareware]], it fell short on removing keyloggers and rootkits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rubenking|first=Neil J. |title=Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware 1.46|url=http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2363514,00.asp|publisher=[[PC Magazine]]|accessdate=3 June 2010|date=2010 May 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Controversy ==
On November 2, 2009, Malwarebytes accused&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malwarebytes.org/forums/index.php?showtopic=29681 IOBit Steals Malwarebytes' Intellectual Property]&lt;/ref&gt; rival IOBit of incorporating the database of Malwarebytes' Anti-Malware (and several products from other vendors, which were not named) in its security software IObit Security 360. IOBit denied the accusation and stated that the database is based on user submissions, and sometimes the same signature names that are in Malwarebytes get placed in the results. They said they did not have time to filter out the signature names that are similar to Malwarebytes. IOBit also stated that Malwarebytes does not have convincing proof, and promised that the databases were not stolen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.iobit.com/declaration-from-iobit_95.html Declaration from IObit].&lt;/ref&gt; After the declaration from IOBit, Malwarebytes replied that they are not convinced of the argument from IOBit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.malwarebytes.org/index.php?showtopic=30989&amp;hl= IOBitâs Denial of Theft Unconvincing].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-1009_3-10389650-83.html Malwarebytes accuses rival of software theft]. CNet.&lt;/ref&gt; Malwarebytes claims to have served [[DMCA]] infringement notices against CNET, [[Download.com]] and [[Majorgeeks|MajorGeeks.com]] in order to have the download sites remove the IOBit software.&lt;ref&gt;http://malwarebytes.besttechie.net/2009/11/03/iobits-denial-of-theft-unconvincing/&lt;/ref&gt; IObit said that as of Version 1.30, their database has been updated to address those accusations of intellectual property theft made earlier by Malwarebytes.&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/IObit-Security-360/3000-8022_4-10967594.html&lt;/ref&gt;
