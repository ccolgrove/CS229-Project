'''Cornell University''' ({{pron-en|kÉrËnÉl}} {{respell|kor|NEL|'}}) is an [[Ivy League]] [[university]] located in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]], [[New York]], United States.  It is a [[private university|private]] [[land-grant university]], receiving annual funding from the State of New York for certain educational missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spitzer 2005&quot;/&gt; Founded in 1865 by [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]], the university was intended to teach and make contributions in all fields of knowledge&amp;mdash;from the [[classics]] to the [[science]]s, and from the theoretical to the applied. These ideals, unconventional for the time, are captured in Cornell's motto, a popular 1865 Ezra Cornell quotation: &quot;I would found an institution where any person can find instruction in any study.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;motto&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Nov07/2015investWalsh.lgk.html | title = Cornell University Facts: Motto | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its founding, Cornell has also been a [[co-education]]al, non-[[sectarianism|sectarian]] institution where admission is offered irrespective of religion or race.

&lt;!--- This line was removed because it is a useless summary of Cornell. Cornell also offers programs in culinary arts, architecture, fashion design, and horticulture.  Cornell offers programs in [[liberal arts]], [[engineering]], [[agriculture]], [[management]], [[law]], [[medicine]] and [[veterinary medicine]]. ---&gt;The university is broadly organized into seven [[undergraduate education|undergraduate]] colleges and seven [[graduate school|graduate]] divisions at its main Ithaca campus, with each college and division defining its own admission standards and academic programs in near autonomy. The university also administers two satellite medical campuses, one in [[New York City]] and one in [[Education City]], [[Qatar]]. Cornell is one of two private [[land-grant university|land grant universities]],&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The other is the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].&lt;/ref&gt; and its seven undergraduate colleges include three private, [[statutory college|state-supported statutory or contract colleges]]. As a land grant college, it also operates a [[cooperative extension]] outreach program in every county of New York.

Cornell counts more than 255,000 living [[alumnus|alumni]], 31&amp;nbsp;[[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall Scholars]], 28&amp;nbsp;[[Rhodes Scholarship|Rhodes Scholars]] and [[List of Nobel laureates affiliated with Cornell University|41 Nobel laureates]] as affiliated with the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;factbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/cornell_facts.pdf | title = 2009â10 Factbook | publisher = Cornell University | format = PDF | accessdate = 2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nobel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/Nobel_Laureates_at_CUk1.shtml | title = Cornell Nobel laureates | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;Rhodes Scholars&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1165899600 | title = Uncle Ezra | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2007-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student body consists of nearly 14,000 undergraduate and 7,000 graduate students from all 50 states and 122 countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;student body&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/about/facts/stats.cfm | title = Facts about Cornell | format = URL| publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|History of Cornell University}}
Cornell University was founded on April&amp;nbsp;27, 1865 as the result of a [[New York State Senate|New York State (NYS) Senate]] bill that named the university as the state's [[land-grant university|land grant]] institution. Senator [[Ezra Cornell]] offered his farm in [[Ithaca, New York]] as a site and $500,000 of his personal fortune as an initial [[financial endowment|endowment]]. Fellow senator and experienced educator [[Andrew Dickson White]] agreed to be the first president. During the next three years, White oversaw the construction of the initial two buildings and traveled around the globe to attract students and [[faculty (university)|faculty]].&lt;ref name=&quot;founding&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| last = Becker | first = Carl L. | authorlink = Carl L.

Cornell continued to be a technological innovator applying its research to its own campus as well as to outreach efforts. For example, it was one of the first university campuses to use electricity to light the grounds from a water-powered [[dynamo]] in 1883.&lt;ref name=chp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|title=The Early History of District Energy at Cornell University|accessdate=2009-11-24|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070704140529/http://www.utilities.cornell.edu/utl_heatinghistory.html|archivedate=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1894, Cornell has included state-funded statutory colleges and has also administered research and extension activities that have been jointly funded by state and federal matching funds.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Cornell has had an active alumni since its earliest classes and was one of the first universities to included alumni-elected representatives on its Board of Trustees.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The University's charter was amended on April 24, 1867 to specify alumni elected trustees, ({{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=bPIKAAAAIAAJ&amp;dq=first%20alumni%20trustees%20cornell%20elect&amp;pg=PA278#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=278|title=Cornell University, a history, Volume 1|year=1905|publisher=University Publishing Society|accessdate=December 14, 2010|author=Waterman Thomas Hewett, Frank R.

Cornell expanded significantly, particularly since [[World War II|World War&amp;nbsp;II]], with its student population in Ithaca growing to its current count of about 20,000 students.

Cornell's main campus is on East Hill in [[Ithaca, New York]], overlooking the town and [[Cayuga Lake]]. When the university was founded in 1865, the campus consisted of 209.5&amp;nbsp;acres (0.85&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of Ezra Cornell's roughly 300&amp;nbsp;acre (1.2&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) farm.{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Since then, it has swelled to about 745&amp;nbsp;acres (3.0&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²), encompassing both the hill and much of the surrounding areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;ithaca&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/visiting/ithaca | title = Cornell University - The Ithaca Campus | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some 260 university buildings are divided primarily between [[Cornell Central Campus|Central]] and [[Cornell North Campus|North Campuses]] on the [[plateau]] of the Hill, [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]] on its slope, and Collegetown immediately south of Central Campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ithaca&quot; /&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Central Campus has laboratories, administrative buildings, and almost all of the campus' academic buildings, athletic facilities, auditoriums, and museums. The only remaining residential facility on Central Campus is the [[Cornell Law School|Law School's]] dormitory, Hughes Hall. North Campus contains [[freshman]] and [[graduate student]] housing, themed program houses, and 29&amp;nbsp;[[fraternity and sorority houses]]. West Campus has upperclass residential colleges and an additional 25&amp;nbsp;fraternity and sorority houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cornell.edu/maps/large.cfm | title = Cornell University Map | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2010}} Collegetown contains two upperclass [[residence halls]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dining.cornell.edu/campuslife/housing/undergraduate/cascadilla-hall.cfm|title=Housing â Cascadilla Hall|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campuslife.cornell.edu/campuslife/housing/undergraduate/sheldon-court.cfm|title=Sheldon Court|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Schwartz [[performing arts|Performing Arts]] Center amid a neighborhood of apartments, eateries, and businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.ithaca.ny.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&amp;SEC=%7B4519B3DC-DFAD-47EE-9E0A-6A55E243E4B4%7D&amp;DE=%7BFEA36033-DB19-4201-9F95-A5F4DAA6DE06%7D|title=Collegetown|publisher=City of Ithaca|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main campus is marked by an irregular layout and eclectic [[architectural style]]s, including ornate [[Collegiate Gothic]], [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]], [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] buildings, and less decorative [[international style (architecture)|international]] and [[modern architecture|modernist]] structures. The more ornate buildings generally predate [[World War II]]. Because the student population doubled from 7,000 in 1950 to 15,000 by 1970, grandiosity was neglected in favor of less expensive and more rapidly constructed styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Daniel | last=Margulis | coauthors=Schroeder, John | title=A Century at Cornell | publisher=[[Cornell Daily Sun]] | location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] | year=1980 | isbn=0-938304-00-3 | pages=110â111}}&lt;/ref&gt; While some buildings are neatly arranged into [[quadrangle (architecture)|quadrangles]], others are packed densely and haphazardly. These eccentricities arose from the university's numerous, ever-changing master plans for the campus. For example, in one of the earliest plans, [[Frederick Law Olmsted]], the designer of [[Central Park]], outlined a &quot;grand terrace&quot; overlooking [[Cayuga Lake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Kermit C. | last=Parsons | title=The Cornell Campus: A History of its Planning and Development | publisher=Cornell University Press | location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca, N.Y.]] | year=1968 | chapter=Chp. 3: A Quadrangle of Stone}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the terrace plan was dropped, McGraw Hall appears to face the wrong direction, facing Libe Slope rather than the Arts Quad.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

The Ithaca Campus is among the rolling valleys of the [[Finger Lakes]] region and, atop East Hill, provides a view of the surrounding area, including 38&amp;nbsp;miles (61.4&amp;nbsp;km) long [[Lake Cayuga]]. Two [[Canyon|gorges]], Fall Creek Gorge and Cascadilla Gorge, bound Central Campus and become popular swimming holes during the warmer months (although the university discourages their use).{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Adjacent to the main campus, Cornell owns the 2,800&amp;nbsp;acre (11.6&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) [[Cornell Plantations]], a [[botanical garden]] containing flowers, trees, and ponds along manicured trails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://explore.cornell.edu/scene.cfm?scene=Natural%20Beauty&amp;stop=CU%20%2D%20NB%20%2D%20Campus%20Gardens | title = Explore Cornell - Natural Beauty - Campus Gardens | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-04-06|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20051220145027/http://explore.cornell.edu/scene.cfm?scene=Natural+Beauty&amp;stop=CU+-+NB+-+Campus+Gardens|archivedate=2005-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weill Cornell Medical College in [[Qatar]] is in [[Education City, Qatar|Education City]], near [[Doha]]. Opened in September 2004, it was the first American medical school outside the United States. The college is part of Cornell's program to increase its international influence. The College is a joint initiative with the Qatar government, which seeks to improve the country's academic programs and medical care.&lt;ref name=&quot;aboutqatar&quot; /&gt; Along with its full four-year MD program, which mirrors the curriculum taught at [[Weill Medical College]] in New York City, the college offers a two-year undergraduate [[pre-medical]] program with a separate admissions process. This undergraduate program opened in September 2002 and was the first [[coeducation]]al institute of [[higher education]] in Qatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cunews.cornell.edu/releases/April01/weill.qatar.html | title = Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cornell is a non-profit organization governed by a 64-member [[board of trustees]] consisting of both privately and publicly appointed trustees. Three trustees are appointed by the [[Governor of New York]]; one seat is reserved for the eldest lineal descendant of Ezra Cornell; two members from each of the fields of agriculture, business and labor in New York state; eight trustees to be elected from among and by the alumni of the university; two trustees to be elected from among and by the faculty of the university at Ithaca and Geneva; two trustees to be elected from among and by the membership of the university's student body at Ithaca (one undergraduate and one graduate student);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cdsun.library.cornell.edu/cgi-bin/newscornell?a=d&amp;srpos=2&amp;cl=search&amp;d=CDS19810512.2.10.2&amp;e=--------20--1----Earl+Schuyler+Flansburgh-all|title=Trustees Discuss Role Students Play on Board|work=Cornell Daily Sun|volume=97|number=140|page=10|date=May 12, 1981|accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one trustee to be elected from among and by the nonacademic staff and employees of the university at Ithaca and Geneva, 37&amp;nbsp;trustees at large and finally, the Governor, [[Majority Leader of the New York State Senate|Temporary President of the Senate]], [[Speaker of the New York State Assembly|Speaker of the Assembly]], and president of the university serve in an ''[[ex officio]]'' voting capacity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bylaws&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cornell.edu/trustees/docs/012210-cu-bylaws.pdf |title=Bylaws of Cornell University |publisher=Board of Trustees, Cornell University |accessdate=October 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;New York State Education Law Â§5703.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter C.

Cornell consists of nine privately endowed colleges as well as four publicly supported &quot;[[statutory college]]s&quot;: the New York State College of Agriculture and Life Sciences, College of Human Ecology, School of Industrial and Labor Relations, and College of Veterinary Medicine. These statutory colleges received $131.9&amp;nbsp;million in [[State University of New York|SUNY]] appropriations in 2010-2011 to support their teaching, research, and service missions, which makes them accountable to SUNY trustees and other state agencies. The budget also includes $3.9 million of state funds for Cornell Cooperative Extension&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.suny.edu/GovtRelations/state/pdf/BudgetDocument.pdf|title=State University of New York 2010-2011 Budget|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ramanujan&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/April07/2007StateBudget.kr.html|title=State budget pleases CU administrators|last=Ramanujan|first=Krishna|date=17 April 2007|work=The Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Graffeo 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/nyctap/search/display.html?terms=&amp;url=/nyctap/I05_0016.htm|title=3 No. 14: In the Matter of Jeremy W.

Cornell is [[decentralized]], with its colleges and schools exercising wide autonomy. Each defines its own academic programs, operates its own [[college admissions|admissions]] and advising programs, and confers its own [[academic degree|degrees]]. The only university-wide requirements for a [[Bachelor's degree|baccalaureate]] degree are to pass a [[human swimming|swimming]] test, take two [[physical education]] courses, and satisfy a writing requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stateuniversity.com/universities/NY/Cornell_University.html|title=Cornell University|publisher=stateuniversity.com|accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of inter-school academic departments offer courses in more than one college.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cis.cornell.edu/studying.html|title=Studying Computing and Information Science|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biology.cornell.edu/academics/|title=Cornell Biology: Intro to the Major|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; All academic departments are affiliated with at least one college; the last department without such an affiliation, the [[Cornell Africana Studies and Research Center]], merged with the Arts College in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2010/12/02/day-hall-merges-africana-center-arts-college-director-resigns-protes|title=Day Hall Merges Africana Center Into Arts College; Director Resigns in Protest|authors=Lawrence Lan and Ben Gitlin|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=December 2, 2010|accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its founding, Cornell University was considered revolutionary because its founder, Ezra Cornell, was committed to access for all students, regardless of economic circumstance. Section 9 of the original charter of Cornell University ensured that the university &quot;shall be open to applicants for admission&amp;nbsp;... at the lowest rates of expense consistent with its welfare and efficiency, and without distinction as to rank, class, previous occupation or locality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;charter&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=United States.

The university awarded need-based grants as early as 1879, and its first endowed scholarship fund was created in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000037.pdf|page=13|title=Gifts and Giving|first=Michael|last=Whalen|date=May 2003|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1950s Cornell coordinated with other Ivy League schools to provide a consistent set of financial aid. However, in 1989, a consent decree to end a Justice Department antitrust investigation ended such coordination.&lt;ref name=&quot;2005-06 Financial Plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dpb.cornell.edu/documents/1000030.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Cornell University|title=2005-06 Financial Plan|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the decree, all Ivy League schools continue to award aid on financial need without offering any athletic scholarships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/WhatIsIvy/compliance.asp |publisher=[[Ivy League]] |title=NCAA Rules: A guide for Ivy Alumni and Friends of Athletics |accessdate=2010-04-11 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308165649/http://www.ivyleaguesports.com/WhatIsIvy/compliance.asp |archivedate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2010, Cornell announced a policy of matching any grant component of financial aid offers from other Ivy League schools, MIT, Duke University or Stanford, if an accepted applicant is trying to decide between Cornell and those other schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.cornell.edu/stories/Dec10/AidMatch.html|title=Cornell to match financial aid offers of peer universities|date=December 7, 2010|publisher=Cornell Chronicle|accessdate=December 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 31, 2008, Cornell announced a new financial aid initiative to be phased in over the following two years. In the first year, 2008â09, Cornell replaced need-based loans with scholarships for undergraduate students from families with incomes under $60,000 and capped such loans annually at $3,000 for students from families with incomes between $60,000 and $120,000. The following year, 2009â10, the program improved by replacing loan with scholarships for students from families with incomes up to $75,000, and capped annual loans at $3,000 for students from families with income between $75,000 and $120,000.  For families above $120,000, need-based loans were capped at $7,500 per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/section/news/content/2008/12/05/cuâs-new-aid-plan-will-help-during-econ-crisis|title=C.U.'s New Aid Plan Will Help During Econ.

In 1984, the [[National Science Foundation]] began work on establishing five new [[supercomputer]] centers, including the [[Cornell Theory Center|Cornell Center for Advanced Computing]], to provide high-speed computing resources for research within the United States. In 1985, a team from the [[National Center for Supercomputing Applications]] began the development of [[NSFNet]], a [[TCP/IP]]-based computer network that could connect to the [[ARPANET]], at the Cornell Center for Advanced Computing and the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. This high-speed network, unrestricted to academic users, became a backbone to which regional networks would be connected. Initially a 56-[[kilobit per second|kbit/s]] network, traffic on the network grew exponentially; the links were upgraded to 1.5&amp;nbsp;[[megabit per second|Mbit/s]] [[Digital Signal 1|T1s]] in 1988 and to 45&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in 1991. The NSFNet was a major milestone in the development of the [[Internet]] and its rapid growth coincided with the development of the [[World Wide Web]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nsf.gov/about/history/nsf0050/internet/launch.htm | title = The Internet - The Launch of NSFNET | publisher = National Science Foundation | accessdate = 2006-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=103050 | title = A Brief History of NSF and the Internet | publisher = National Science Foundation | accessdate = 2006-01-05|archivedate=2008-05-28|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080528230646/http://www.nsf.gov/news/news_summ.jsp?cntn_id=103050}}&lt;/ref&gt;
	
Cornell scientists have researched the fundamental particles of nature for more than 70 years. Cornell physicists, such as [[Hans Bethe]], contributed not only to the foundations of nuclear physics but also participated in the [[Manhattan Project]] (see also: [[List of Cornell Manhattan Project people]]). In the 1930s, Cornell built the second [[cyclotron]] in the United States. In the 1950s, Cornell physicists became the first to study [[synchrotron radiation]]. During the 1990s, the [[Cornell High Energy Synchrotron Source|Cornell Electron Storage Ring]], located beneath Alumni Field, was the world's highest-luminosity electron-positron collider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cerncourier.com/main/article/42/1/11 | title = Cornell's laboratory is at the crossroads | publisher = CERN Courier | accessdate = 2006-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lns.cornell.edu/accelphys/cesr.shtml | title = Accelerator Physics: Cornell Electron Storage Ring | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; After building the synchrotron at Cornell, [[Robert R.

The International Linear Collider, to be completed in the late 2010s, will complement the [[Large Hadron Collider]] and shed light on questions such as the identity of [[dark matter]] and the existence of extra dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.physics.cornell.edu/research/accelerator-physics/|title=Accelerator Physics|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the area of humanities and social sciences, Cornell is best known for being one of the world's greatest centers for the study of [[Southeast Asia]]. The [[Cornell South East Asia Program|Southeast Asia Program]] (SEAP) at Cornell is designated as a [[National Resource Center]] (NRC) by the United States Department of Education 2010â2014. Therefore, the SEAP is nationally prominent in promoting advanced foreign language training, area and international knowledge in the liberal arts and applied discipline focused on Southeast Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/southeastasia/ |title=Home &amp;#124; SEAP - Southeast Asia Progam |publisher=Einaudi.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.einaudi.cornell.edu/southeastasia/resources/research.asp George McTurnan Kahin Center for Advanced Research on Southeast Asia] is located in the historic &quot;Treman House.&quot; The house was built by [[Robert Henry Treman]], the son of an enterprising local family and the first member of that family to attend Cornell University and be elected to its board of trustees.

During the 2004â05 academic year, the Greek system committed 21,668 [[community service]] and [[advocacy]] hours and raised $176,547 in philanthropic efforts.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek&quot; /&gt; However, the administration has expressed concerns over student misconduct in the system. In 2004â05, of the 251 social events registered with the Office of Fraternity and Sorority Affairs, 37 (15%) resulted in a complaint. In that same year, there were five reported instances of property destruction, five reports of [[bias]], three [[hazing]] incidents, and various other allegations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greek&quot; /&gt; Misconduct by students, faculty or staff is reviewed by the Judicial Administrator, who administers Cornell's [[justice system]].

University housing is broadly divided into three sections: [[Cornell North Campus|North Campus]], [[Cornell West Campus|West Campus]], and Collegetown. Since a 1997 residential initiative, West Campus houses transfer and returning students, whereas North Campus is almost entirely populated by freshmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://ri.campuslife.cornell.edu/Ri_article_page_view.asp?action=article&amp;ID=2318 | title = The Residential Initiative: North Campus | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Cornell has several housing areas for graduate and professional students. Of these, [[Schuyler House]] (which was formerly a part of Sage Infirmary)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/fs/facinfo/fs_facilInfo.cfm?facil_cd=2702|title=Schuyler House|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hughes Hall, Cornell|Hughes Hall]] (which is the domitory wing of the law school complex)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/fs/facinfo/fs_facilInfo.cfm?facil_cd=3028|title=Hughes Hall|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; have a dorm layout, while [[Maplewood Apartments]], [[Hasbrouck Apartments]], and [[Thurston Court Apartments]] are apartment-style, some even allowing for family living. Off campus, many single family houses in the East Hill neighborhoods adjacent to the university have been converted to apartments. Private developers have also built several multi-story apartment complexes in the Collegetown neighborhood. Nine percent of undergraduate students reside in fraternity and sorority houses, although first semester freshmen are not permitted to join them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dos.cornell.edu/greek/info_for_students/index.cfm|title=DOS: For Students|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornellâs Greek system has 67 chapters and over 54 Greek residences that house approximately 1,500 students.

In addition to the school's varsity athletics, club sports teams have been organized as student organizations under the auspices of the Dean of Students. Cornell's intramural program includes 30 sports. Beside such familiar sports such as [[flag football]], [[squash (sport)|squash]], or [[water polo]], such unusual offerings as &quot;inner tube [[Water polo#Game variations|water polo]]&quot; and formerly &quot;broomstick polo&quot; have been offered, as well as a sports trivia competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.nycolleges.org/profiles.php?Inst_ID=25 | title = NYS College Guide Campus Profile: Cornell University | publisher = NYS College Guide | accessdate = 2006-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cornell students also often participate in the [[International Rutabaga Curling Championship]], held annually at the Ithaca Farmers' Market.

===Cornelliana===
{{Main|Cornelliana}}
Cornelliana is a term for Cornell's traditions, legends, and lore. Cornellian traditions include [[Slope Day]], a celebration held on the last day of classes of the spring semester, and [[Dragon Day]], which includes the burning of a dragon built by architecture students. Dragon Day is one of the school's oldest traditions and has been celebrated annually since 1901, typically on or near St. Patrick's Day. The dragon is built secretly by the architecture students, and taunting messages are left for the engineering students for the week before Dragon Day. On Dragon Day, the dragon is paraded across the Arts Quad and then set afire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55 | title = History of Dragon Day | publisher = Cornell University | accessdate = 2006-05-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060909042704/http://www.alumni.cornell.edu/cu_facts/read_more.cfm?id=55 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, if a virgin crosses the [[Arts Quad]] at midnight, the statues of [[Ezra Cornell]] and [[Andrew Dickson White]] will walk off their pedestals, meet in the center of the Quad, and shake hands, congratulating themselves on the chastity of students. There is also another myth that if a couple crosses the suspension bridge on North Campus, and the young woman does not accept a kiss from her partner, the bridge will fall. If the kiss is accepted, the couple is assured a long future together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fs.cornell.edu/tours/default.cfm?tour_id=41|title=Fall Creek Gorge: Suspension Bridge Virtual Tour|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university is also host to various student pranks. For example, on at least two different occasions the university has awoken to find something odd atop the 173-foot (52.7&amp;nbsp;m) tall McGraw clock tower&amp;mdash;once a 60-pound (27&amp;nbsp;kg) pumpkin and another time a disco ball. Because there is no access to the spire atop the tower, how the items were put in place remains a mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.news.cornell.edu/campus/pumpkin_tale.html | title = Pumpkin Tale | publisher = Cornell News Service | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The colors of the lights on McGraw tower change to orange for Halloween and green for St. Patrick's Day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ezra.cornell.edu/posting.php?timestamp=1067490000|title=Ask Uncle Ezra|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The clock tower also plays music.

The school colors are [[carnelian (color)|carnelian]] (a shade of red) and white, a play on &quot;Cornellian&quot; and Andrew Dickson White. A bear is commonly used as the unofficial mascot, which dates back to the introduction of the mascot &quot;Touchdown&quot; in 1915, a live bear who was brought onto the field during football games.&lt;ref name=&quot;mascot&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://cornellsun.com/node/17613|title=Wild Cornell Mascot Wreaks Havoc|work=Cornell Daily Sun|date=April 30, 2006|accessdate=2010-09-21|first=Casey|last= Holmes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university's [[alma mater]] is &quot;[[Far Above Cayuga's Waters]]&quot;, and its [[fight song]] is &quot;[[Give My Regards to Davy]]&quot;.

The university received worldwide attention for a series of six student suicides that occurred during the 2009&amp;ndash;10 school year, and they have since added temporary fences to its bridges while more permanent measures are in process. Before this abnormal cluster of suicides, the suicide rate at Cornell had been similar to or below the suicide rates of other American universities, including a period between 2005 and 2008 in which no suicides occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/03/20/new.york.cornell.suicides/index.html |title=Two suspected suicides confirmed at Cornell; total now at six |first=Ross |last=Levitt |lastauthoramp=yes |first2=Susan |last2=Candiotti |work=[[CNN]] |date=March 22, 2010 |publisher=CNN |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/17/education/17cornell.html |title=After 3 Suspected Suicides, Cornell Reaches Out |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=March 16, 2010 |first=Trip |last=Gabriel |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;
