'''George Charles Scott, Jr.''' (born March 23, 1944 in [[Greenville, Mississippi]]) is a former [[first baseman]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played for the [[Boston Red Sox]] (1966â71, 1977â79), [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1972â76), [[Kansas City Royals]] (1979) and [[New York Yankees]] (1979). He batted and threw right-handed.

==Career==
In 1965, he was the [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] triple crown winner, leading the league in home runs, RBIs, and batting average. Scott was a three-time [[MLB All-Star Game|All-Star]] in the [[American League]] in 1966, 1975 and 1977, starting the 1966 Mid-Summer Classic and homering in 1977. Scott hit over 20 [[home run]]s six times in his career, tying [[Reggie Jackson]] for the American League lead in 1975 with a career-high 36 and pacing the league in [[run batted in|RBI]] that same season with 109. Known for his glovework at first base, Scott was awarded the [[Gold Glove Award]] for fielding excellence in the American League during eight seasons (1967â68 and 1971â1976).

In a 14-season career, Scott posted a .268 [[batting average]] with 271 home runs (which he called &quot;taters&quot;) and 1051 RBI in 2034 [[games played|games]]. His nickname was 'Boomer' and he called his glove &quot;black beauty.&quot; George was well-known for having a good sense of humor. He wore a necklace which he once identified to a reporter as being composed of &quot;the second baseman's teeth&quot;. To complement his unique attire, George also was known for wearing a batting helmet while fielding at first base due to an experience he had with a fan throwing hard objects at him once during a road game.

Despite his successful career, Scott's 1968 season was noted by [[ESPN]] as one of the worst offensive performances ever, especially for a first baseman. [http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=baker/080822]

George is the father of three sons, Dion, George III and Brian. Scott's grandson, Deion Williams, a shortstop from Redan High School in Georgia, was recently drafted by the Washington Nationals in the 2011 draft and is playing in the Gulf Coast League.
