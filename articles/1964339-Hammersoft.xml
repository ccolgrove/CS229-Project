It ranges from accurate historical reproductions of [[American pioneer|pioneer]], [[mountain man]], [[American Civil War|Civil War]], [[cowboy]] and vaquero clothing to the stylized garments popularized by [[singing cowboy]]s such as [[Gene Autry]] and [[Roy Rogers]] in the 1940s and [[1950s|'50s]]. Western wear can be very informal, with a [[t-shirt]] and [[blue jeans]] forming a basic ensemble, or it may consist of tailored formal garments with western accents. At minimum, western wear generally incorporates a [[cowboy hat]], a leather [[Belt (clothing)|belt]], and [[cowboy boots]].

==Hat==
It may surprise many to learn that in the early days of the [[Old West]] it was the [[bowler hat]] rather than the [[slouch hat]], centercrease (derived from the army regulation [[Hardee hat]]), or [[sombrero]] that was the most popular among cowboys as it was less likely to blow out off in the wind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title=The Hat That Won the West | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=336&amp;dat=19571026&amp;id=xQQpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=PkgDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7036,5636283 | accessdate=2010-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1870s, however, the [[Stetson]] had become the most popular [[cowboy hat]] due to its use by the [[Union Cavalry]] as an alternative to the regulation blue [[kepi]].&lt;ref&gt;Stetson Hats 1865â1870, Jeffery B. Snyder 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;* [http://www.cavhooah.com/stetson.htm CavHooah.com â Stetson Page]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stampede string]]s were installed to prevent the hat from being blown off when riding at speed.

The tall white [[Ten gallon hat]]s traditionally worn by movie cowboys were of little use for the historical [[gunslinger]] as they made him an easy target, hence the preference of lawmen like [[Wild Bill Hickok]], [[Wyatt Earp]] and [[Bat Masterson]] for low-crowned black hats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nebraskahistory.org/lib-arch/research/manuscripts/family/hickok.htm Wild Bill Hickok collection] at [[Nebraska State Historical Society]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally part of the traditional [[Plains Indian]] costume, [[coonskin cap]]s were frequently worn by [[Mountain men]] like [[Davy Crockett]] for their warmth and durability. These were revived in the 1950s following the release of a popular Disney movie starring [[Fess Parker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coonskincap.com The Coonskin Cap]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/1639/1803/1600/Davy%20Crockett57.jpg Height of the Craze. 1957 Wales]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shirt==
A '''Western shirt''' is a traditional item of Western Wear characterized by a stylized [[yoke]] in front and in back. It is generally constructed of [[denim]] or [[tartan]] fabric with long sleeves, and in modern form is sometimes seen with snap pockets, patches made from [[bandana]] fabric, and fringe. 

A Western [[dress shirt]] is often elaborately decorated with piping, embroidered roses and a contrasting yoke. In the 1950s these were frequently worn by movie cowboys like [[Roy Rogers]] or [[Clayton Moore]]'s [[Lone Ranger]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westernshirts.com/western-shirts.html Western Shirts]&lt;/ref&gt; Derived from the elaborate [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[vaquero]] costumes like the [[Guayabera]] and the battleshirts worn by many Confederate soldiers, these were worn at [[rodeos]] so the cowboy could be easily identifiable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puertorico.com/blog/guayaberas-fashion-statement-for-men Guayabera]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Buffalo Bill]] was known to wear them with a buckskin [[fringe jacket]] during his Wild West shows and they were fashionable for teenagers in the 1970s and late 2000s.

Another common type of Western shirt is the shield-front shirt worn by many US Cavalry troopers during the [[American Civil War]] but originally derived from a red shirt issued to prewar firefighters. The cavalry shirt was made of blue wool with yellow piping and brass buttons and was invented by the flamboyant [[George Armstrong Custer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shootists.websitetoolbox.com/post?id=387795 Shield front shirts]&lt;/ref&gt; In recent times this shield-front shirt was popularised by [[John Wayne]] in [[Fort Apache]] and was also worn by [[rockabilly]] musicians like the [[Stray Cats]].

==Coat==
When a jacket is required there are is a wide choice available for both linedancers and [[historical re-enactors]]. These include [[frock coat]]s, [[poncho]]s popularised by [[Clint Eastwood]]'s [[Spaghetti Western]]s, short Mexican jackets with silver embroidery, [[fringe jacket]]s popular among [[outlaw country]], [[southern rock]] and 1980s [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] bands,&lt;ref&gt;1. ^ U.S. Cavalryman, 1865-1890, by Martin Pegler&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Duster coat]]s derived from originals worn in the Wild West.&lt;ref&gt;# George-Warren, Holly, and Michelle Freedman: How the West Was Worn, Harry N. Abrams (2001), ISBN 0-8109-0615-5.&lt;/ref&gt; More modern interpretations include [[leather]] [[waistcoat]]s inspired by the [[motorcycling|biker]] subculture and jackets with a design imitating the [[piebald]] color of a cow. Women may wear [[bolero]] jackets derived from the Civil War era [[zouave]] uniforms, [[shawl]]s, [[denim jackets]] in a color matching their jeans or skirt, or a [[fringe jacket]] like [[Annie Oakley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2006-05/annieoakley.html &quot;Little Miss Sure Shot&quot; - The Saga of Annie Oakley]&lt;/ref&gt;

For more formal occasions inhabitants of the West might opt for a suit with &quot;smile&quot; pockets, a half-belt at the rear, piping and a yoke similar to that on the Western shirts. This can take the form of an [[Ike jacket]], [[Leisure suit]] or three-button [[sportcoat]]. [[Country and Western]] singer [[Johnny Cash]] was known to wear an all-black Western suit, in contrast to the elaborate Nudie suits worn by stars like [[Elvis]] and [[Porter Waggoner]].&lt;ref&gt;Beard, Tyler (2001). ''100 Years of Western Wear'', p. 72. Gibbs Smith, Salt Lake City. ISBN  087905591X.&lt;/ref&gt;  The most elaborate western wear is the custom work created by [[tailor|rodeo tailors]] such as [[Nudie Cohn]] and [[Manuel Cuevas|Manuel]], which is characterized by elaborate [[embroidery]] and [[rhinestone]] decoration. (See also [[Nudie suit]].) This type of western wear, popularized by [[country music]] performers, is the origin of the phrase ''[[rhinestone cowboy]]''.

==Pants==
In the early days of the Wild West pants were made out of wool. In summer canvas was sometimes used. This changed during the [[Gold Rush]] of the 1840s when [[denim]] [[overalls]] became popular among miners for their cheapness and breathability. [[Levi Strauss]] improved the design by adding [[copper]] [[rivets]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://patimg1.uspto.gov/.piw?docid=00139121&amp;SectionNum=1&amp;IDKey=36265F66C6AD&amp;HomeUrl=http://patft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2%2526Sect2=HITOFF%2526u=%25252Fnetahtml%25252FPTO%25252Fsearch-adv.htm%2526r=130%2526f=G%2526l=50%2526d=PALL%2526s1=18730520.PD.%2526p=3%2526OS=%2526RS=ISD/18730520%252B |inventor-last=Davis | inventor-first =Jacob |inventor2-last=Strauss| inventor2-first =Levi |publication-date=9 August 1892| issue-date=20 May 1873 | title =Improvement in fastening pocket-openings |country-code=US |patent-number=139121 |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by the 1870s this design was adopted by [[rancher]]s and [[cowboy]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Transcript, Levi Strauss vs. H.B. Elfelt, District of California Circuit Court of the United States Ninth Judicial Circuit, 1874. National Archives, Pacific Sierra Region&lt;/ref&gt; The original [[Levi's]] jeans were soon followed by other makers including [[Wrangler jeans]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrangler.com Official website]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lee Cooper]]. These were frequently accessorised with kippy belts featuring metal [[concho]]s and large [[belt buckle]]s

Leather [[chaps]] were often worn to protect the cowboy's legs from [[cactus]] spines and prevent the fabric from wearing out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doversaddlery.com/product.asp?pn=X1%2D3502A&amp;ss=chaps English schooling chaps]. Web page accessed April 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Two common types include the skintight shotgun chaps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cowboyway.com/What/WhatAreChinks.htm Cowboyway.com], explanation of chaps styles.  Web page accessed March 10, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and wide batwing chaps. The latter were sometimes made from hides retaining their hair (known as &quot;woolies&quot;) rather than tanned leather. They appeared on the Great Plains somewhere around 1887.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/magazines/wild_west/4851691.html &quot;Westerners: Wild and Wooly Chaps.&quot; ''Wild West'' Magazine, February 2007, ''The History Net.''] Web site accessed September 2, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Women wore knee-length [[prairie skirt]]s,&lt;ref&gt;George-Warren, Holly, and Michelle Freedman: How the West Was Worn, p. 184-187.&lt;/ref&gt; red or blue [[gingham]] dresses or [[suede]] fringed skirts derived from Native American dress. Saloon girls wore short red dresses with [[corset]]s, [[garter belt]]s and [[stockings]].&lt;ref&gt;Waugh, Norah (December 1, 1990). Corsets and Crinolines. Routledge. ISBN 0-87830-526-2.&lt;/ref&gt; After [[World War II]], many women, returning to the home after working in the fields or factories while the men were overseas, began to wear jeans like the men.

==Neckwear==
During the [[Victorian era]], gentlemen would wear silk [[cravat]]s or [[necktie]]s to add color to their otherwise sober black or grey attire. These continued to be worn by respectable Westerners until the early 20th century. Following the Civil War it became common practise among working class veterans to loosely tie a [[bandana]] around their necks to keep the dust out of their faces. This practise originated in the [[Mexican-American War|Mexican War]] era regular army when troops threw away the hated [[leather]] [[leatherneck|stock]]s (a type of [[collar]] issued to soldiers) and replaced them with cheap [[paisley]] [[kerchief]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=-X2vvS698p4C&amp;lpg=PA84&amp;ots=EYg8U-33vX&amp;dq=neck%20stock%20regular%20us%20army&amp;pg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Don Troiani's Soldiers in America]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another well-known Western accessory, the [[bolo tie]], was a [[American pioneer|pioneer]] invention reputedly made from an expensive hatband. This was a favorite for [[gambler]]s and was quickly adopted by Mexican [[charro]]s who often wore it tied in a bow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/events/event.aspx?ID=127 Arte en la Charerria: The Artisanship of Mexican Equestrian Culture] at the [http://www.nationalcowboymuseum.org/events/event.aspx?ID=127 National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum, Oklahoma City]&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times it serves as formal wear in many southwestern states, notably Montana, New Mexico&lt;ref name=&quot;Richardson's Secret Weapon: The Bolo Tie&quot;&gt;[http://blog.washingtonpost.com/sleuth/2007/03/underdog_richardsons_secret_we.html Richardson's Secret Weapon: The Bolo Tie - The Sleuth&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barrypopik.com/index.php/texas/entry/bola_tie_bolo_tie/ Texas, The Lone Star State: Bola Tie (Bolo Tie)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
