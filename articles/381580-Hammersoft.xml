'''Eircom Group LTD''' (aka &quot;'''eircom'''&quot;) is a [[telecommunications]] company in the [[Republic of Ireland]], and a former state-owned incumbent. It is currently the largest telecommunications operator in the Republic of Ireland and operates primarily on the island of [[Ireland]], with a point of presence in [[Great Britain]].

As [[Telecom Ãireann|Bord Telecom Ãireann]], the company was (until 1999) a [[state monopoly]]; as a private company, it continues to dominate many telecommunications areas. Its main competitors are [[UPC Ireland]] (which operates its own cable network), [[Vodafone Ireland]] (which bought [[BT Ireland]]'s residential customer base on 22 July 2009 and is accessed through Eircom's network and BT Ireland's fibre), [[Imagine Communications]] (Irish Broadband &amp; Gaelic Telecom) and [[Magnet Networks]] and [[Smart Telecom]], with a mix of [[LLU]]/[[GLUMP]] from Eircom and fibre. 

Eircom currently operates the fixed-line telephone network, a [[HSDPA]] ([[3G]]) and [[GSM]]/[[EDGE]] (2.75G) mobile telephone network [[Meteor (mobile network)|Meteor]] (acquired from AllTel (Western Wireless) in 2005) and acts as an [[internet service provider]] (ISP) ''Eircom.net''. Eircom also operates a property-alarm installation and monitoring unit called ''Eircom Phonewatch''. Eircom broadband had a 49% share in 2006, and Eircom fixed voice lines 72% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siliconrepublic.com/news/news.nv?storyid=single7544 Comreg via Silicon Republic]&lt;/ref&gt; Current market share analysis is at comreg's site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comreg.ie comreg's site]&lt;/ref&gt; By late 2007 Eircom added their 500 thousandth DSL subscriber but broadband share may have fallen to 44% due to growth of fixed wireless, cable and fibre services.&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.enn.ie/article/97275.html enn reports Comreg Sep. 2007].&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its [[privatization]] in 1999, the company has been repeatedly loaded with [[debt]] and [[asset stripping|asset stripped]] by domestic and foreign [[Speculation|speculators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swp.ie/news/eircom-vulture-capitalists-profit-expense-workers-and-country/1728|title=Eircom: Vulture capitalists profit at the expense of workers and the country|publisher=SWP.ie|date=2009-04-30|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, despite the company annually generating a [[Earnings before interest and taxes|profit]], it is currently enacting wage cuts and [[Layoff|redundancies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telecomseurope.net/content/eircom-speeds-staff-cuts-maintain-profit-growth|title=Eircom speeds staff cuts to maintain profit growth|publisher=TelecomsEurope|date=2010-05-28|accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of July 2011, Eircom have total revenues of â¬360,000,000 in the bank.

==Services==

Eircom operates the largest fixed-line telecommunications network in the [[Republic of Ireland]], under licence from the [[Commission for Communications Regulation]]. Most homes and businesses in the state are connected by this network. A full range of telecommunications services is provided on the network including Business IP, its [[Multiprotocol Label Switching|MPLS]] platform. Eircom have also completed a wholly owned fibre network ring around Northern Ireland and another around Belfast. Their ISP division, Eircom Net, provides dial-up services, as well as broadband services (see broadband roll-out, below). Eircom Phonewatch provides [[burglar alarm|burglar-alarm]] and home monitoring services. Any alarm-monitoring products using SMS are &quot;hardcoded&quot; to work with Eircom's SMSC, so will not work on Digiweb, BT, Smart, UPC or Magnet phone networks. DECT SMS handsets are also preprogrammed for Eircom's SMSC. Any competing phone service that is not just carrier pre-selection (CPS) of Eircom must provide their own SMSC, but even when they do, consumers may be unable to migrate from Eircom due to SMSC numbers in equipment that cannot be reprogrammed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}}

Eircom's mobile arm, [[meteor (mobile network)|Meteor]], provides a full range of [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]]/([[3G]]) and [[GSM]]-based mobile communication services throughout the Republic of Ireland. Its GSM network operates at 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz and 900&amp;nbsp;MHz ranges, as the earlier GSM licences fully utilised the 900&amp;nbsp;MHz band. [[GPRS]] and [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] data services are also available. Meteor have recently{{When|date=January 2010}} launched [[High Speed Packet Access|HSPA]] ([[3G]] Mobile Broadband) services in Dublin, Cork, Dundalk and Drogheda. Meteor provides both bill-pay (contract) and pre-pay (non-contract) plans and has approximately 19% of the Irish mobile market, with 1,032,000 cellular subscribers on the Meteor Network. The company has used EDGE technology on its network and has received a [[3G]] (UMTS) licence, formerly removed from Eircom's competitor, [[Smart Telecom]] (This required 33% of the population to be covered by [[3G]] by September 2008.)

As an operator with significant market power, Eircom is required to provide a number of wholesale products to other operators and to switch calls onto other phone networks. Many broadband products offered by other operators are resales of the Eircom product.

Eircom's PhoneWatch subsidiary provides monitored burglar alarms, fire alarms, CCTV systems, and medical alert devices.

==History==
The company was formed in 1984, as Bord Telecom Ãireann, under the Posts and Telecommunications Act 1983. This article deals mainly with the post-privatisation Eircom. For details of the company during its time as a [[state-sponsored bodies of the Republic of Ireland|state-sponsored body]], see: [[Telecom Ãireann]].

From 2000 to 2008, Eircom sponsored the [[League of Ireland]].

===Privatisation===
Due to [[European Union|EU]] laws requiring the opening up of the Irish telecommunications market; however, Ireland had a derogation from competition until 2003. Telecom Ãireann was privatised, this was very controversial and subject to much debate. The process began in 1995, and by July 1999 the government had disposed of virtually all of its shareholding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/30/57/2510988.pdf |title=Enhancing Market Openness through Regulatory Reform |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eircom plc was then floated on the [[Irish Stock Exchange]], [[London Stock Exchange]], and [[New York Stock Exchange]] on 8 July 1999 and small/first-time investors were encouraged by the [[Irish Government]] to buy shares. The share price was set at â¬3.90. It later reached a high of â¬4.80, a 23% increase. Those initial investors who held onto their shares, until July 2000, received a 4% bonus-share allocation.

The Eircom flotation is considered to have been an example of a [[stock market bubble]]&amp;mdash; after the initial hype of the flotation died down, the stock price fell rapidly. Many of the 500,000 small investors were angered by the significant financial loss they incurred, blaming the government for not sufficiently warning them of the risks inherent in stock-market investment.

Since privatisation Eircom penetration of landlines has fallen from 82% to 69%. During this period, there has been a large increase in mobile phone ownership and a significant rise in line rental to the highest in Europe.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}

===Disposal of Eircell, going private and reflotation===
[[File:Old EIRCELL.PNG|thumb|right|'''Eircell''' Limited]]
In 2001, Eircom sold its mobile subsidiary [[Vodafone Ireland|Eircell]] to [[Vodafone]]. The company was transferred to a separate entity, Eircell 2000 plc which was then sold to Vodafone in a share swap. Eircom shareholders got 1 Eircell 2000 share for 1 eircom share. The conversion rate was then 0.9478 Vodafone shares for every 2 Eircell 2000 shares. This left the Eircom shareholder with not only shares in Eircom, but Vodafone also.

After the sale of Eircell, Eircom itself was believed to be undervalued and became the subject of a bidding war between two consortia: the E-Island consortium headed by [[Denis O'Brien]], and the [[Valentia Consortium]] headed by Tony O'Reilly, the chairman of [[Independent News and Media]]. Eventually in November 2001, the company agreed to a recommended offer of â¬1.335 per Eircom share. Eircom Plc was delisted from the stock exchange, become Eircom Limited, a [[private limited company by shares]] and a subsidiary of Valentia, and O'Reilly took the reins as Executive Chairman (a role he pursued with vigour, even holding management meetings at his [[Castlemartin House and Estate|Castlemartin]] home).

On 19 March 2004, the company returned to the stock market (although the company being listed, '''Eircom Group plc''', was in fact a new holding company, and was registered in [[England and Wales]] rather than the [[Republic of Ireland]]). The company floated at â¬1.55 a share, but dipped on initial trading before recovering to trade above its float price.

===Return to mobile â acquisition of Meteor===
In early 2005, several Irish newspapers reported that [[Meteor (mobile)|Meteor Mobile Communications]], the third mobile phone operator, was up for sale by its owners, [[Western Wireless]]. It was considered that this afforded Eircom an opportunity to re-enter the mobile communications market. On 9 July 2005, it was reported by ''[[The Irish Times]]'' that there had been three bidders for Meteor: Eircom, [[Smart Telecom]], and a consortium led by [[Denis O'Brien]]. On 14 July 2005 [[RTÃ News]] reported on their [http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0714/meteor-business.html business website] that Denis O'Brien had withdrawn from bidding, and that it was understood that Eircom was the top bidder at â¬410 million. On 21 July, it was announced that Smart Telecom had also withdrawn, leaving Eircom as the sole bidder. Eircom announced the agreement to purchase it on 25 July 2005 at a cost of â¬420m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2005/0725/eircom-business.html |title=RTÃ Business: Eircom mobile again, but shares drop |publisher=Rte.ie |date=2005-07-25 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of September 2008, [[Meteor (mobile)]] had over 1,000,000 customers and a market share of 30%, offering both [[GSM]] and 3G mobile telephony and broadband services.

=== eMobile (MVNO)===
As part of their mobile strategy, Eircom have also launched ''eMobile''. This is to be complementary to the Meteor division (mainly used by residential wireless customers). eMobile is a mobile virtual network operator [[MVNO]] which uses the Meteor Network for its services to residential &amp; business customers, to compliment the residential and business mobile services offered by Meteor.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telegeography.com/cu/article.php?article_id=17730&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eircom Northern Ireland ===
Eircom NI, is the name of the company's operations in Northern Ireland. With the division based in [[Belfast]], Eircom own and operate a fibre-optic network ring around Belfast and Northern Ireland, linking into the national Eircom Network in the rest of Ireland. Eircom NI have won significant contracts thus far, the largest being the â¬100m ''&quot;Network NI&quot;'' contract for the [[Northern Ireland Civil Service]], with other significant contracts as operator of choice for [[Northern Ireland Water]] and [[Viridian Group|Viridian]]. The company in Northern Ireland currently provides services to local government and SME sectors.

===Swisscom approach===
On 2 November 2005, it was reported that the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] telecommunications company, [[Swisscom]] AG, had made an approach to Eircom regarding a possible takeover of the company. On 25 November 2005, the [[Swiss Federal Council|Swiss government]] announced that it would use its controlling stake in Swisscom to block any foreign takeovers, effectively ending hopes of a bid.

===Babcock &amp; Brown===
In May 2006 it was announced that Eircom was to be sold to the Australian investment group [[Babcock and Brown]] in a deal worth â¬2.4 billion. The Employee Share Ownership Trust, which represents workers at the company, was to remain a minority shareholder. The sale was approved by shareholders on 26 July 2006, and at close of business on 17 August 2006, the shares were delisted from the Official Lists of the Irish Stock Exchange and the London Stock Exchange, ending Eircom's second period on the stock markets. The same day, Phillip Nolan resigned as [[chief executive officer|chief executive]] of Eircom, and on 1 September Rex Comb was officially named as the new CEO. Tony O'Reilly resigned as Chairman and was replaced by [[Pierre Danon]], previously of [[BT Group plc]] and [[JP Morgan Chase]].
Babcock and Brown have since collapsed as a company and their BCM vehicle, which owns over 50% of Eircom, broke all ties with the former parent and rebranded themselves as Eircom Holdings Limited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Triumph and disaster |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/bcm-shareholders-vote-to-cut-ties-with-parent-1721498.html |title=BCM shareholders vote to cut ties with parent - Irish, Business |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2009-04-28 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==
Eircom retains a virtual monopoly, at around 70%, on fixed-line telephony in the State (the only exceptions being those operated by UPC Ireland cable company (formerly [[NTL Ireland]] and Chorus), Digiweb Metro and some fibre offerings from BT, [[Magnet Networks]], Smart and Digiweb). [[Chorus Communications|Chorus]] previously offered wireless telephony but failed to renew their licence. Eircom is required to allow carrier pre-selection (CPS). Introduced in Ireland in 2001, CPS allows subscribers to use an alternative provider for all their calls, without the need to dial indirect access codes or numbers, although they still receive a bill from Eircom for line rental. Under a wholesale line rental scheme, it is possible for customers, to have a single bill from an alternative provider, for example, [[BT Ireland]], including the cost of Eircom line rental, rather than continuing to receive a separate one from Eircom for this cost. Unlike the UK, where BT's competitors now can charge less than BT for line rental, it is not yet possible for operators in Ireland to buy the lines from Eircom and charge their own rate for line rental, should they wish.

==Controveries with Eircom==
After the privatisation of Eircom, the highly profitable mobile phone division, Eircell, was sold to Vodafone. Some{{Who|date=November 2009}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=09/04/2001 - 08:04:50 |url=http://www.breakingnews.ie/archives/2001/0409/business/snmhqlgb/ |title=Eircom,Vodafone deal to go ahead |publisher=BreakingNews.ie |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider this act to be [[asset stripping]] by the large investors with interests in Eircom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2004/01/18/story441589443.asp |title=The insider: Barefaced cheek of Eircom chiefs: ThePost.ie |publisher=Archives.tcm.ie |date=2004-01-18 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eircom announced in June 2007 that from 30 July line rental charges would increase by â¬1.18 bringing line rental charges â already the most expensive in Europe to a total of â¬25.36 per month for a PSTN analogue line, one source indicated it was the highest line-rental charge in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ailish O'Hora |url=http://www.independent.ie/unsorted/features/story-of-the-week--higher-charges-for-phone-users-are-on-the-line-in-telecoms-sale-1041952.html |title=Higher charges for phone users are on the line in telecoms sale|publisher=Independent.ie |date=2007-07-21 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also announced was an increase of between 4.8 and 4.9% on local and national calls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electricnews.net/article/47455html electricnews.net 15-06-2007]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, Eircom pleaded guilty to a breach of the Data Protection Act, at the [[Dublin]] District Court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.independent.ie/national-news/top-telecoms-firms-fined-for-coldcalling-customers-2588990.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadband roll-out==

As of 2nd quarter 2006, 370,000 customers had broadband, 260,000 on DSL and the others on a mix of FWA, cable and satellite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comreg.ie/_fileupload/publications/ComReg0652.pdf |title=Quarterly Key Data Report |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Comreg, Q1 2006, Page 19).
 
On 1 November 2007, Eircom announced their 500,000th DSL customer.&lt;ref&gt;
   &quot;Eircom press announcement via finfacts&quot;, Finfacts.com, web:
    [http://www.finfacts.com/irelandbusinessnews/publish/&lt;!--
    --&gt;article_1011669.shtml FF669].
&lt;/ref&gt;
In terms of speed and availability, Eircom exchanges can only deliver broadband to houses within {{convert|5|km|mi|abbr=on}} in most of its exchanges and will not be investing in fibre optic or next-generation broadband, as stated in a meeting with members of DÃ¡il Ãireann in late 2008 about broadband availability. In 2011 Eircom announced that they would invest â¬100 million on high speed fibre optic lines which would be delivered as a pilot scheme to customers in Dublin and Wexford.

==Copyright enforcement==
===Blocking of The Pirate Bay===
On 21 April 2008 18:36, Eircom rejected claims by four major record companies that it, as the largest broadband internet service provider in the State, must bear some liability for the illegal free downloading of music by computer users. Eircom have thus far managed to come to an agreement with the companies involved, stating that they will be working in conjunction with these companies to prevent large amounts of copyrighted material being shared through the ISP. This in turn raises concerns over internet privacy, since presumably this will be done by monitoring the IP traffic associated with Eircom's customers. It is not known whether or not this bears any significance on the Meteor Mobile network, a mobile broadband supplier recently{{When|date=January 2010}} acquired by Eircom. Eircom has reportedly signed an out-of-court settlement with said companies and are initiating a program to clamp down on piracy, within their network, by instituting an IP monitoring service, accessible by the Irish Recorded Music Association (IRMA) and allowing up to three warnings before disconnection of service.

Currently, Eircom users who try to access The Pirate Bay receive the following message:

: &quot;On the 24 July 2009, an Order was made by the High Court requiring eircom to block or otherwise disable access by its subscribers to the website thePirateBay.org, its related domain names, IP addresses and URLs. The Court was satisfied that on the basis of the evidence presented by the record companies that the PirateBay website is a website that facilitates the exchange of copyrighted sound recordings without the consent of the copyright owners.&quot;

: &quot;eircom recognises the legitimate rights of the owners of copyrighted material and believes that individuals who share or download copyrighted material without the authorisation or the permission of the copyright owner are acting illegally.

: &quot;The Order further provides that should the PirateBay website content be legitimatised in the future, then eircom has liberty to apply to the Court to have the Order vacated and access to the PirateBay website enabled.&quot;

Since September 2009, The Pirate Bay website and trackers have remained blocked by eircom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://torrentfreak.com/eircom-pirate-bay-blockade-takes-effect-090901/ Eircom Pirate Bay blockade takes effect]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disconnection===
Eircom agreed to a controversial deal with the [[Irish Recorded Music Association|IRMA]] (Irish equivalent of the [[RIAA]]) to activate a &quot;three strikes system&quot; so it will ban users from the internet for 12 months if they appear to be downloading copyrighted content through [[peer to peer filesharing]] networks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0129/1232923373331.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==OneVision Irish DTT License application==

On 1 May 2009 Fintan Drury, chairman of the OneVision consortium (made up of the [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3 Group]], [[Arqiva]], Eircom and [[Setanta Sports]]), announced that OneVision is to enter negotiations with the BCI, with the view to takeover operations of the Irish pay DTT service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Airline charges |url=http://www.independent.ie/business/irish/onevision-sets-sights-on-paidfor-tv-project-1726759.html |title=OneVision sets sights on paid-for TV project - Irish, Business |publisher=Independent.ie |date=2009-05-02 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If negotiations are deemed successful, it may see the launch of DTT in late 2010/early 2011 at a proposed operation cost of â¬40 million. OneVision aspire to offer 23 channels coinciding with the free-to-air channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/finance/2009/0501/1224245754008.html |title=OneVision wants DTT licence - The Irish Times - Fri, 1 May 2009 |publisher=The Irish Times |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; For further information on the subject, see: [[One Vision (DTT)]]. Eircom is majority stakeholder in this project.
