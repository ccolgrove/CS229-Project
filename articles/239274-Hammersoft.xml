The '''University of Nevada, Reno''' (also referred to as '''University of Nevada''', '''UNR''', or simply '''Nevada'''), is a teaching and research university established in 1874 and located in [[Reno, Nevada]], USA.  It is the [[Land-grant university|land grant institution]] for the state of [[Nevada]].

The campus is home to the large-scale structures laboratory in the College of Engineering, which has put Nevada researchers at the forefront nationally in a wide range of seismological and large-scale structures testing and modeling. The Nevada Terawatt Facility, located on a satellite campus of the university, includes a terawatt-level [[Z-pinch]] machine and terawatt-class high-intensity laser system - one of the most powerful such lasers on any college campus in the country. It is home to the University of Nevada School of Medicine, with campuses in both of Nevada's major urban centers, Las Vegas and Reno, and a health network that extends to much of rural Nevada. The faculty are considered worldwide and national leaders in diverse areas such as environmental literature, journalism, Basque studies, and social sciences such as psychology.

The Carnegie Foundation ranks the University of Nevada, Reno in the Doctoral/Research University-Intensive category, which places it among the top 10 percent of all colleges and universities in the United States. This classification reflects the success in providing undergraduate students with opportunities to pursue degrees in more than 75 disciplines, and to pursue advanced degrees in a broad range of fields. Today, more than 100 graduate-degree programs are offered at the master's and doctoral level. Some of the degree programs offered by the university include journalism, biotechnology, mining, engineering, business administration, and natural sciences such as [[seismology]].

The university is home to the [[Donald W. Reynolds School of Journalism]], which has produced six [[Pulitzer Prize]] winners.&lt;ref&gt;http://journalism.unr.edu/about-us/&lt;/ref&gt; The school includes 16 clinical departments and five nationally recognized basic science departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicine.nevada.edu/ |title=University of Nevada School of Medicine |publisher=Medicine.nevada.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Nevada is also home to the National Judicial College, founded in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.judges.org/about.html |title=The NJC Experience |publisher=Judges.org |date=1978-01-01 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:UN RENO.jpg|thumb|left|Manzanita Lake in the southwestern part of the campus.]]
The University of Nevada was established by the Nevada State Constitution, and was founded in [[Elko, Nevada]] in 1874. In 1885, the University of Nevada was moved from Elko to its current home in Reno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Discover Nevada: History, stats, and highlights|url=http://www.unr.edu/discover-nevada/university-history|work=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=2 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The University of Nevada remained the only four-year academic institution in the state of Nevada until 1965, when the Nevada Southern campus (now the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]]) was separated to become its own university.

The University of Nevada, Reno has been affected by the national economic crisis, which resulted in the vertical cutting of several programs rather than blanket across the board cuts. The Fall 2011 semester saw the largest incoming class in the history of the University.

===Precise name===
There is some debate over whether the university should be called UNR or Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Demeritt |first=Clint |url=http://nevadasagebrush.com/blog/2007/09/25/the-coming-of-the-comma/ |title=The coming of the comma |publisher=The Nevada Sagebrush |date=2007-09-25 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some claim that since it was the first university in the state, its historic name should be its official designation as it is in many other multi-campus public university systems such as the [[University of Michigan]] or similar to the way the University of California's flagship campus of UC Berkeley is referred to as &quot;Cal&quot;, but only for sporting purposes.   Several of the university's institutions retain the institution's traditional name, &quot;University of Nevada,&quot; including the alumni association, the student government, and the athletics department (which refers to the university's teams simply as &quot;Nevada,&quot; a practice held since the late 1800s). When the University plays in sports against in-state rival, the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, the school's name is decided by the home team. When the game is held in Reno, it reads UNLV vs Nevada, however, if held in Las Vegas it reads, UNLV vs UNR.

===Early construction===
The university's first building, Morrill Hall, was completed in 1887 and still stands on the historic quad at the campus' southern end. The hall is named after U.S. Senator Justin Morrill, author of the 1862 Land-Grant College Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Straka|first=Thomas|title=Ten things you didn't know about: Land-grant universities|url=http://www.unr.edu/silverandblue/archive/2009/fall/NSB_Fall_2009_WEB_36.pdf|accessdate=2 August 2011|newspaper=Nevada Silver &amp; Blue|date=2009 November}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lincoln Hall (all-male residence) and Manzanita Hall (all-female residence) were both opened in 1896.

===The Quad===
The Quad is located in the southern part of the campus, surrounded by Morrill Hall and the Mackay School of Mines. This quadrangle is modeled after Thomas Jeffersonâs at the University of Virginia. The northern end of the Quad contains a statue of [[John William Mackay]] (namesake of Nevada's Mackay School of Mines, later renamed the [[Mackay School of Earth Sciences and Engineering]]), created by [[Mount Rushmore]] designer [[Gutzon Borglum]]. The Quad and the original campus buildings surrounding it have a listing on the National Register of Historic Places.

==Student media==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Ansari Business Bldg.JPG|thumb|left|Ansari Business Building]] --&gt;

Nevada's editorially independent, weekly student newspaper is called ''[[The Nevada Sagebrush]]''. It comes out every Tuesday afternoon, and employs more than 40 people, 25 full-time. Prior to 2004, the newspaper called itself simply the ''Sagebrush''.

The newspaper won the Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker award in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nevada Sagebrush nominated for Pacemaker award|url=http://journalism.unr.edu/latestnews/app-news/0/185/nevada-sagebrush-nominated-for-pacemaker-award/|work=Reynolds School of Journalism|publisher=University of Nevada, Reno|accessdate=14 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was also a finalist for a Pacemaker at the 2006 and 2007 ACP student journalism awards. It has won the best of show award at the fall 2005, 2006 and 2007 ACP national conferences in its category (weekly broadsheet at a four-year university). It was also nominated for an online ACP Pacemaker in 2008. It's new web site, [www.nevadasagebrush.com], which launched in the fall of 2007, has also been recognized by the Center for Innovation in College Media for it breaking news packages, podcasts, videos and general innovation and Web presence. Many of The ''Nevada Sagebrush'''s former editors go on to work and take internships at newspapers and news organizations such as ''The Washington Post'', ''The Oregonian'', ''USA Today'', ''The Miami Herald'', ''The Arizona Republic'' and the Associated Press as well as dozens of local newspapers around the country.

[[UNR Insight Magazine|Insight Magazine]] is the only student-run magazine at the University of Nevada, Reno. Formerly Nevada's yearbook for nearly 100 years, ''Insight Magazine'', has evolved into the second major publication circulating at the university. The first edition of Insight Magazine was published in September 2008. It presents itself as a theme-based monthly magazine, providing photography, stories and graphics,  in contrast to the weekly, newspaper-style of ''The Sagebrush''. It is put out both in print and online. The online version, ''UNRINSIGHT.com'', provides both support for the published stories and independent content.

In its sophomore year, Insight Magazine has received national attention from major college media organizations, such as the Associated College Press and the College Media Advisers. Insight placed fifth for headline presentation in Best of Collegiate Design 2009 by the &quot;College Media Advisers&quot;. At the 2009 ACP Conference in Austin, Texas, Insight placed fifth in Best of Show for an audio podcast.

Nevada's literary arts journal ''Brushfire'' was created by a group of students in 1950.  It is released once a semester and publishes original poetry, literature, and art by students and some faculty and community members.

The university is also home to a student-run radio station, Wolf Pack Radio. The station broadcasts primarily through its website, although it comes through at 1700 AM.
Starting in the Fall 2010 semester, Nevada broadcast journalism students started &quot;Wolf Pack Week,&quot; a 30-minute television newscast that is shown around campus.  Future episodes will air on PBS in Reno and Las Vegas.

There are other independent student publications on campus (although they have stopped publishing regularly since 2006), including ''The Nevada Blue'' and the ''Pack Patriot''.
