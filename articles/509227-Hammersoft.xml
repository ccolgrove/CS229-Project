== History ==

Bentley University was founded in 1917 as the Bentley School of Accounting and Finance by Harry C. Bentley who served as the schoolâs president until 1953. In 1961, the college was accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Science degrees under President Morison, who moved the college from its Boylston Street address in Boston to its current day location in Waltham, Massachusetts. Gregory H. Adamian, a major driving force in the college's development, became the fourth president in 1970. Under his guidance, the college became accredited to confer four-year Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1971 and graduate degrees in 1973. During this time, the school also changed its name to Bentley College. In the late 1990s, Bentley College became a pioneer{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} of incorporating information technology into its core business curriculum. In 2002, Bentley College opened up a campus in the Middle Eastern country of [[Bahrain]] in partnership with the Bahrain Institute of Banking and Finance. The college was accredited to confer its first doctoral degrees in the fields of business and accountancy in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2163 |title=We're sorry, but we can not find the page you're looking for. &amp;#124; Bentley University Newsroom |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2011}} A main fixture of the campus, The Bentley Library, underwent a sweeping renovation in 2006 during which time the school's logo was changed to showcase the clock tower that sits atop the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/news-events/pr_view.cfm?id=2258 |title=We're sorry, but we can not find the page you're looking for. &amp;#124; Bentley University Newsroom |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2011}} One year later, [[Gloria Cordes Larson]], a former state and federal government official and Boston-based lawyer became the first female president of Bentley College. In 2008, the school changed its name to Bentley University after being authorized by the state board of higher education to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/university/ |title=university : Bentley |publisher=Bentley.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}

==Mobile Computing Program==
All entering students receive a new notebook computer during their First Week sessions that familiarizes them with the computing resources available on campus. Students keep this computer until the beginning of their third year of study when they may exchange it for a new model.  The Mobile Computing Program is mandatory, helping Bentley maintain hardware and software uniformity among all students and faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bentley.edu/ugcatalogue/resources/mobile_computing_program.cfm |title=Mobile Computing Program : Bentley |publisher=Bentley.edu |date=2011-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners receive national recognition and interact with high-profile business leaders at the annual Bentley Leadership Forum in cooperation with [[TIME magazine]].

==The Hughey Center for Financial Services (HCFS)==
The Hughey Center for Financial Services (HCFS) named in honor of Bentley College alumnus David A. Hughey â55 (retired executive vice president of Dean Witter Inter-capital), was established in 1997. The HCFS has earned a national reputation{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} and has been featured on CNBC.

The mission of the center is to extend the educational goals of Bentley University through innovative classroom pedagogy, cutting-edge financial research, and real-world applications.

The mission is translated into three broad strategies:
* To integrate the Trading Room into the graduate and undergraduate curricula in an effort to enhance student learning, professional development, and success
* To create a positive, collegial, and collaborative environment that is supportive of faculty and student research activities
* To strengthen external relations with the investment management community

The center is dedicated to providing world-class education through the integration of the multi-million-dollar Trading Room. Supporting more than 40 graduate and undergraduate courses and providing faculty, students, and staff to an unrivaled{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} collection of financial technologies valued at more than $3.5 million in annual licensing fees, the Hughey Center serves as a model{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} for other colleges and universities around the globe.

==The Center for Business Ethics (CBE)==
The Center for Business Ethics is one of the worldâs leading{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} research and educational institutes in the field of business ethics. It is also among the oldest, having been established in 1976, when the field was in its infancy.

CBE is guided by its mission to promote integrity and trust in business by encouraging the establishment of ethical cultures in businesses everywhere. The center staff pursues this through the application of expertise, research, education and a collaborative approach to the dissemination of best practices.

For over three decades, CBE has demonstrated unsurpassed leadership in advancing knowledge, stimulating public discourse and fostering an appreciation for the importance of business ethics among a global network of executives, ethics and compliance professionals, academics, researchers and students of business.
