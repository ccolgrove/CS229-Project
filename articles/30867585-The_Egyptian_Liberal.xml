==Background==
Following the highly controversial [[Iranian presidential election, 2009|2009 Iranian presidential elections]], [[2009â2010 Iranian election protests|massive protests]] erupted across Iran. The Iranian government suppressed the protests and stopped the mass demonstrations in 2009, with only very minor flare-ups in 2010. However, not many of the protesters' demands were met.

Then, the [[2010â2011 Arab world protests]] spread across the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]]. After the ousting of President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] in [[Tunisia]] on 14 January 2011, millions of people began demonstrating across the region in a broad movement aimed at various issues such as their [[standard of living|standards of living]] or influencing significant reforms, with varying degrees of success. With the successful ousting of Egyptian President [[Hosni Mubarak]] on 11 February 2011 following that of President Ben Ali of Tunisia, renewed protests began in Iran.

==Protests==
On 27 January, the opposition [[Iranian Green Movement|Green Movement]] of Iran announced a series of protests against the [[Politics of Iran|Iranian government]] scheduled to take place prior to the &quot;Revolution Day&quot; march on 11 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Athanasiadis|first=Iason|title=Iran Green Movement promising big February protests|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0127/Iran-Green-Movement-promising-big-February-protests|accessdate=14 February 2011|newspaper=Christian Science Monitor|date=27 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 February, various opposition groups in Iran sent a letter to the [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Ministry of Interior]] requesting permission to protest under the control of the [[Iranian police]]. Permission was refused by the relevant government officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Protests wash over Iran, Bahrain and Yemen, inspired by Arab world unrest |author= |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/protests-wash-over-iran-bahrain-and-yemen-inspired-by-arab-world-unrest-1.343352 |newspaper=[[Haaretz]] |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these setbacks and crackdowns on activists and members of opposition parties, opposition leaders such as [[Mir Hossein Mousavi]] and [[Mehdi Karroubi]], called for protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=english.aljazeera.net |title=Iran opposition planning protests|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/2011212162526150718.html |publisher=aljazeera |date=|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's 'Day of Rage' |author= |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/day_of_rage_blog/2299873.html?page=1&amp;x=1#relatedInfoContainer |newspaper=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=7 February 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protests that occurred on this day marked a setback for the government of Iran, as the regime has campaigned that Mousavi's Green Movement had lost momentum, but the revived uprisings helps prove otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/02/25-bahman-and-the-green-revival.html |title=Tehran Bureau: 25 Bahman and the Green Revival |publisher=PBS Frontline |date=15 February 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to some reports, 1,500 [[Hezbollah]] fighters assisted in the suppression of the protests in Azadi Square. Following the initial protests, Hezbollah fighters allegedly continued to participate, assisting local forces in suppressing protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;report hezbollah fighting&quot;&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4031344,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alsharq alawsat (21.02.20111) [http://aawsat.com/details.asp?section=4&amp;article=609167&amp;issueno=11773 &quot;1500 Hizbullah members participated in oppressing Iranian protesters&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fars News Agency]] released a report in the morning warning that &quot;armed opposition groups plan to shoot at people in [the] protest rally set for Sunday afternoon.&quot; The agency claimed that this group was [[Mujahideen-e Khalq]] an Iraq-based Iranian opposition group, which had entered the country for the sole purpose of attacking the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran warns opposition rally may turn violent |author= |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/20/AR2011022000251.html |newspaper=[[Washington Post]] |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}} {{Dead link|date=June 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Protesters began gathering in the tens of thousands throughout Iran and especially in Tehran. The protesters were seen occupying government buildings, such as the [[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting]] building. However, extremely large numbers of police and plainclothes Basij militia were stationed throughout the city, even outnumbering the protesters in some of the city squares. Tear gas was fired and witnesses reported that security forces fired into protests and beat demonstrators with steel batons. In one neighborhood, Basij members reportedly took over a commercial building and dropped tear gas canisters from the roof onto protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/02/21/irans-foreces-battle-protesters-nationwide/ | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report hezbollah fighting&quot;/&gt; Eyewitnesses reported that two protesters were killed by Basij paramilitaries, one each in the [[Vanak]] and [[Valiasr Street|Vali Asr]] squares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall Street&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's Forces Battle Protests Nationwide |author=Farnaz Fassihi |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703498804576156041487406056.html |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=21 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police arrested a number of protesters and were seen stopping people on the streets and frisking them, along with removing people from vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran Squelches Protest Attempt in Capital |author=Liz Robbins |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/21/world/middleeast/21iran.html?src=mv |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fars News Agency]] reported that she had been released after claiming that she was out shopping.&lt;ref name=&quot;report hezbollah fighting&quot;/&gt;

There were also reports of other protester demonstrations going on in other major cities across Iran. However, coverage by journalists was thin, because the [[Ministry of Intelligence and National Security (Iran)|Ministry of Intelligence and National Security]] had &quot;sent a letter to foreign media offices in Tehran warning them that their bureaus would be shut down and their reporters deported if they wrote &quot;negative articles&quot; surrounding the opposition protests.&quot; While the protests were taking place, the IRNA news agency released television reports saying that things were &quot;completely quiet and normal&quot;. Furthermore, the Fars News Agency had released reports to the public saying that the February 20 protests would be especially violent, because the &quot;opposition plans to shoot people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall Street&quot;/&gt;

It was later reported by witnesses that demonstrations did take place in [[Isfahan]] and [[Shiraz]], most of which were dispersed after being attacked by police and Basij militia.

A video depicting opposition leader Mehdi Karroubi was released early February 25 on the news website Sahamnews.org. It had been recorded by Karroubi before he had been placed under house arrest on February 13. It called for the protesters to remain determined, saying &quot;We must remain determined on the road of our convictions, and I am certain we will succeed...We are committed to the pact we made with the people, to establish the power of the people and Islam based on elections. And on this road, no trouble, no difficulty is too hard to bear.&quot; The video itself was snuck out of his home by his wife in order to get it to the local media.&lt;ref name=karroubi&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's Karroubi isolated but determined: website |author= |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5h1yjFxj3dd4f9Cg6ij6KcZbD6VnQ?docId=CNG.99868b1ecc4e65dad00cb9c958f4949c.921 |newspaper=[[Agence France-Presse]] |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that opposition leaders Mousavi and Karroubi, along with their wives, had been &quot;placed in a safe house for their own welfare, but they have not been arrested&quot;, according to officials in the Iranian government. This was stated to be for their own protection, as the protesters were &quot;looking for martyrs&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Safe&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's two opposition leaders, their wives are placed in safe house |author=Reza Sayah and Michael Martinez |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/02/26/iran.opposition/ |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=26 February 2011 |accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran]] expressed its concern for these changes, since a [[safe house]] is &quot;considered a place for the secret detention of high security-value detainees, which is not under the control of the judiciary or any other monitoring mechanisms.&quot; They have been reportedly used in the past by the Iranian government as places where confessions are obtained from detainees through &quot;methods and techniques&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Safe&quot;/&gt;

====February 28====
The statement that opposition leaders Mousavi and Karroubi had been moved to a safe house was put at odds with a statement released by a member of the Iranian judiciary, who stated that, &quot;The two are currently in their homes and there have only been restrictions on their contacts,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's judiciary denies arrest of opposition leaders: report |author= |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/28/us-iran-opposition-arrest-idUSTRE71R5BX20110228 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=28 February 2011 |accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the families of opposition leaders [[Karroubi]] and [[Mousavi]], and the website Kaleme, (which is connected to the leaders), Karroubi and Mousavi and their wives have been arrested and are being held in [[Heshmatiyeh Prison]].

Opposition website Kaleme posted an announcement by the Green Coordination Council of the [[The Green Path of Hope|Green Path of Hope]] that called for a protest set for March 8, which is [[International Women's Day]]. The protest is to be focused on &quot;demanding more gender equality in the Islamic Republic and to protest the &quot;incarceration&quot; of opposition leaders Mir Houssein Mousavi and Mehdi Karroubi and their wives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IRAN: Opposition websites encourage supporters to join hands with activists on International Women's Day, call for fresh protests |author= |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/03/iran-women-protests-march-8-green-movement-security-mousavi-karroubi.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=5 March 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nobel Peace laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] made a similar announcement also calling for support for a March 8 protest, saying, &quot;On this day, shoulder to shoulder with our brothers, we will come to the streets to support the popular and broad democratic demands, because achieving âequal rightsâ is possible only if voiced in a democratic system. But, we must not allow anyone to disregard our demands under the auspices of preventing crisis or avoiding divisiveness.&quot; She also commented on the [[Chador|change of dress]] for Iranian women that had become law at the beginning of the Iranian government, stating, &quot;Thirty-two years ago on March 8, International Womenâs Day, a statement broadcast on national television, stripped women employed by the government of one of their most basic rights â the freedom to choose their own dress...Iranian women are not starved for political power nor are they demanding decadence.

The official website of opposition leader Karroubi released a statement saying that [[Ayatollah]] [[Ali Khamenei]] had been directly involved in the &quot;abduction of Karroubi and his wife, Fatemeh&quot;, having given the orders to the soldiers under his command to do so. The statement also said that Vahid Haghanian, the administrative advisor to Khamenei, had personally led the &quot;security forces which raided Karroubi's house in north Tehran and confiscated his belongings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran's supreme leader accused of abducting key opponents |author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/06/iran-supreme-leader-accused-abducting |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=6 March 2011 |accessdate=7 March 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====March 8====
[[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]], the former fourth Iranian president and prominent critic of the current Iranian government, was ousted as head of the [[Assembly of Experts]], a body of clerics that chooses Iran's Supreme Leader. His departure from the Assembly came about after a lengthy period of opposition towards him among the conservatives of the Assembly after his support for the 2009 election protests. He had been running for reelection as head of the assembly, against Mahdavi Kani, but withdrew himself upon leaving the assembly. During his last speech at the Assembly, he stated, &quot;I would like to devote my time to writing my memoirs and not run for any more public office.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Critic&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=In Iran, Critic Leaves Key Post |author=Farnaz Fassihi |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704758904576188050369176360.html |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=9 March 2011 |accessdate=9 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:8 March Tehran.jpg|thumb|left|Women's rally in Tehran]] --&gt;

Rafsanjani's resignation from the Assembly caused concern among the opposition protesters, as they had been hoping that he would &quot;help influence Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei to moderate his support for Mr. Ahmadinejad&quot;. Analysts have stated that his resignation now allows the Assembly to choose a new supreme leader that will be more conservative than would otherwise have been possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Critic&quot;/&gt;

A report was released by [[Tehran Bureau]]'s staff reporter Hamid Farokhnia who has been covering events in Tehran. He stated that in preparation for the protests planned for [[International Women's Day]] on March 8, various groups that have been leading the opposition, such as the [[The Green Path of Hope]], the [[Mourning Mothers]] and other groups, made announcements telling their followers to protest in multiple locations across Tehran. The purpose of this, according to Farokhnia, was to thin out the security presence at any one area, as this separation of protesters would require the Iranian police and the Basij to cover all possible places of protest in the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamid&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Opinion: The Fog of Protest |author=Hamid Farokhnia |url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2011/03/opinion-the-fog-of-protest.html?utm_campaign=homepage&amp;utm_medium=feeds&amp;utm_source=feeds |newspaper=[[Tehran Bureau]] |date=10 March 2011 |accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the methods that the Basij used to counteract this was to obtain more members, having new members &quot;as young as 14&quot; joining. Also, perhaps in order to show some sense of equality in light of International Women's Day, according to Farokhnia, the police also had groups of &quot;female stormtroopers&quot; working with the police and Basij, which he described as &quot;fierce-looking chador-clad warriors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamid&quot;/&gt;

Farokhnia went on to say that the Mourning Mothers told their followers to gather in protest at the usual place, &quot;Laleh Park west of Vali Asr&quot;. In contrast, the Green Path of Hope assigned &quot;four or five strategic locales in the city to its followers.&quot; This resulted in confusion for both the police forces and for the protesters, who eventually gave up on gathering in one of the places given and instead returned to the &quot;old routine of walking quietly on the sidewalks of Enghelab Avenue.&quot; Because of the approach of the [[Persian New Year]], Farokhnia stated, there was a high number of shoppers that ended up mingling with the protesters, creating confusion on which people were the protesters. Farokhnia explained the scenario as having &quot;made for unnerving moments of tension but also rare instances of congeniality: protesters offering cookies to the special units of NAJA (the state police) and some young Basijis smiling approvingly at the brave protesters, proving for the umpteenth time that no matter how foul a political ideology, most Iranians in their hearts are revolted by violence and fanaticism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hamid&quot;/&gt;

The children of opposition leaders Mousavi and Karroubi released a statement through Mousavi's website Kaleme stating that on March 8, they had been allowed to visit their parents. It was revealed that the two opposition leaders were being held in separate houses that were in the same neighborhood as Mousavi's home. Mousavi had told them that during an earlier raid on his home by police forces &quot;various documents pertaining to the period of [his] years as prime minister, and a series of CDs containing years of work and research by Zahra Rahnavard were confiscated&quot;. Their children had been warned after their visit not to discuss it with anyone; but, after a few days of consideration, they decided to publish the information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran: Opposition Leaders Allowed Visit With Children |author= |url=http://www.eurasiareview.com/world-news/middle-east/iran-opposition-leaders-allowed-visit-with-children-13032011/ |newspaper=[[Radio Zamaneh]] |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Saudi-owned pan-Arab news channel,''[[Al Arabiya]]'', there were protests by [[Iranian Arabs]] in the city of [[Ahvaz]], capital of the Khuzestan province who were &quot;demanding more rights and humanitarian benefits&quot;. Al Arabiya reports that when the protests began, the city was blockaded by Iranian security forces, who &quot;broke up demonstrations by force.&quot; and that &quot;15 people from Ahwaz have been killed and dozens have been wounded&quot;.&lt;ref name=ahwaz/&gt;

Lebanon-based journalist Roula Hajjar wrote on the [[Los Angeles Times]]'s blog that the protests on April 15 had also occurred in the cities Abadan, Khorramshahr,  Mahshahr and Shadegan. She noted that the events had &quot; largely escaped international attention primarily due to the efforts of Iranian officials.&quot;  She also stated that the state news agencies in Iran had reported the killing of at least three people, &quot;including one officer&quot;, by &quot;armed insurgents&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=IRAN: Outside the spotlight, Arab uprising smolders in country's southwest |author=Roula Hajjar |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/04/iran-ahvaz-protests-violence-human-rights-arab-seperatism.html |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=April 30, 2011 |accessdate=June 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Human Rights Watch]] released a statement, saying that the Iranian government should allow international media into the area.

Amedinejad, having sidelined many of its powerful opponents (Notably [[Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani]] and [[Mohammed Khatami]]), recently tried to shortcut Khamenei powers; most notably by firing [[Heidar Moslehi]], the intelligence minister, a conservative ally to Khamenei, without Khamenei's agreement. Moslehi was later restored by Khamenei, while several close allies of the president, including Amedinejad's progressive chief of staff [[Esfandiar Rahim Mashaei]], have been arrested and accused of invoking [[djinn]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/05/201156113955925329.html|title=Ahmadinejad row with Khamenei intensifies|publisher=Aljazeera.net|date=2011-05-06|author=Aljazeera.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arrests==
[[Ignacio PÃ©rez-Cambra]], the [[Consul (representative)|Consul]] of [[Spain]] in Iran, was arrested for a period of four hours during the early part of the day on 14 February.

Ghaneh Jaleh, the brother of one of the students who were killed, was arrested on February 17, reportedly because he gave &quot;a telephone interview to foreign media about his brother&quot;, specifically to ''[[Voice of America]]''. During the interview, he told Voice of America that his brother, Saleh Jaleh, was not a member of the Basij, as was being claimed, but that the Basij membership card had been faked by the government. He explained that, on February 15, his cousin had taken a photo of Saleh from his home and it was this image of Saleh that was on the Basij membership card.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamaneh&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran arrests brother of student killed in recent protests |author= |url=http://radiozamaneh.com/english/content/iran-arrests-brother-student-killed-recent-protests |newspaper=[[Radio Zamaneh]] |date=17 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian reformists call for protest |author= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/20112197512326286.html |newspaper=[[Al Jazeera]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reported that at least 16-18 student activists at [[Tehran University]] have been arrested since the beginning of the protests. One student, Arzhang Alipour, had &quot;given interviews to media describing how fellow student Hamed Nour-Mohammadi was killed during protests in the southwestern city of Shiraz on February 20&quot;, which resulted him being called in front of the disciplinary committe of the university three times before he was finally arrested on March 12.&lt;ref name=&quot;Farda&quot;/&gt;

==Casualties==
[[File:Saneh.jpg|thumb|[[Sane Jaleh]]]]
The human rights organisation [[HRANA]]'s website reported that one person had died after riot police opened fire at protesters near Tohid Square in Tehran.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran protests see reinvigorated activists take to the streets in thousands |author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/14/iran-protests-reinvigorated-activists |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Kazem Jalali]], one of the injured protesters also died later in the day on February 14.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowhere&quot; /&gt;

Both people killed (Mohammad Mokhtari and [[Sane Jaleh|Sanee Zhaleh]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Reuters&quot;&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-iran-protests-clash-idUSTRE71F48120110216?pageNumber=2 Supporters, opponents of Iran govt clash at funeral], Reuters, Feb 16, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) were students, though from different universities. According to the Iranian government, [[Sane Jaleh|Sanee Zhaleh]] was a member of the [[Basij]] militia and was killed by the opposition. Reuters reported that protesters did not deny that Zhaleh was a Basij member, but that he had &quot;attended Monday's rally as an active opposition supporter;&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Supporters, opponents of Iran govt clash at funeral |author= |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/16/us-iran-protests-clash-idUSTRE71F48120110216 |newspaper=[[Reuters]] |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=16 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but other protesters have strongly denied Zhaleh's Basij involvement and produced an image of Zhaleh visiting [[Grand Ayatollah]] [[Hossein Ali Montazeri]] -- one of the main critics of [[Ayatollah Khamenei]] and [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] -- indicating Zhaleh was truly with the opposition. [[International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran]] (ICHRI) and [[Tehran Bureau]] both quote student oppositionists who deny Jaleh was a Basiji. A member of the Tahkim-e Vahdat student organisation ([[Office for Strengthening Unity]]{{Clarify|date=February 2011}}) told the ICHRI that Jaleh was &quot;not a Basiji&quot; but a member of the Tehran Arts Universityâs Islamic Association, and that &quot;he had attended previous demonstrations as well&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranhumanrights.org/2011/02/sane-jaleh-truth/ The Truth About Sane Jalehâs Murder â Student Protester Was Killed By Direct Shot], ICHRI, 15 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Sanee's brother, Ghaneh Jaleh, also denied Saleh's membership in the Basij. He and others assert that Jaleh's Basij membership card was faked from a photo taken from Ghaneh's house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zamaneh&quot;/&gt;

Clashes erupted during the funeral service held for Zhaleh. ''[[VOA|Voice of America]]'' reported that government loyalists arrived at the funeral and began fighting with the protesters, forcing them to leave and abandon the funeral service.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA&quot;/&gt; ''[[The Guardian]]'' also reported that Iranian authorities had &quot;hijacked the funeral of Zhaleh, busing in hundreds of pro-government supporters and banning his own family from attending.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian opposition calls for fresh protests over pair killed during rally |author=Saeed Kamali Dehghan |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/19/iranian-opposition-fresh-protests-pair-killed |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=19 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting|IRIB]]'' new service reported that the mourners at the funeral were government supporters and could be heard chanting slogans such as &quot;death to Mousavi&quot; and &quot;death to Karroubi.&quot; IRIB also reported that the funeral procession was then attacked by members of &quot;the sedition movement,&quot; who were repelled by pro-government protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/world/2011-02/16/c_13734969.htm |title=Clashes erupted between rival groups at funeral of Iranian protest victim |publisher=News.xinhuanet.com |date=16 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two unidentified men were killed by the Basij militia during the February 20 protests, each respectively in the [[Vanak]] and [[Valiasr Street|Vali Asr]] squares.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall Street&quot;/&gt;

It was later reported that another student, Hamed Nour-Mohammadi, was killed by security forces during the protests in Shiraz. The Iranian state media later quoted the president of the student's university as saying that &quot;Nour-Mohammadi died in a car accident and that he hadn't taken part in the antigovernment rallies that day.&quot; Since Mohammadi's death, student protesters have not been allowed into the university grounds and his family warned &quot;to remain silent on the subject of Nour-Mohammadi's death.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFERL1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Iranian Students Say The Number Of Arrests Show Regime Is Nervous |author=Farangis Najibullah |url=http://www.rferl.org/content/iran_student_killed/2317385.html |newspaper=[[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]] |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic responses==
[[President of Iran|Iranian President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] released a statement saying, &quot;It is clear the Iranian nation has enemies because it is a nation that wants to shine, conquer peaks and change [its international] relations...Of course, there is a lot of hostility against the government. But they knew that they would get nowhere....[the organizers of the protests] just wanted to tarnish the Iranian nation's brilliance...It is a shining sun.

The commander of the [[Basij]] [[Mohammad Reza Naqdi|Mohammad Reza Naghdi]] told the [[Fars News Agency]] that he believed the protests had been started by &quot;western spies&quot; and that &quot;western intelligence agencies are searching for a mentally challenged person who can set himself on fire in Tehran to trigger developments like those in Egypt and Tunisia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;

The [[Mourning Mothers]] gave their support to the protests and stated that they would be joining the protesters in their marches. They called for the unconditional release of all political prisoners, abolition of the death penalty and a public trial for all those who had permitted massacres of citizens in the past 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ø§Ø¹ÙØ§Ù Ø­ÙØ§ÛØª Ù Ø´Ø±Ú©Øª ÙØ§Ø¯Ø±Ø§Ù Ø¹Ø²Ø§Ø¯Ø§Ø± Ø¯Ø± ØªØ¸Ø§ÙØ±Ø§Øª Ù¢Ûµ Ø¨ÙÙÙ |author= |url=http://www.rahesabz.net/story/32463/ |newspaper=Rahesabz |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clerics call for &quot;anger&quot; rally===
The Islamic Propagation Coordination Council called for a rally on 18 February in order to show anger at what it called the &quot;crimes&quot; of &quot;seditionist&quot; leaders and their rebel allies.

===Use of child soldiers===
''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that after the 1 March protest onwards, children from ages 12â16 began being [[Military use of children|used]] by the Basij against the protesters. According to information released by the [[International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran]], these children were &quot;armed with batons, clubs and air guns and ordered to attack demonstrators who have tried to gather in Tehran.&quot; They had been bussed in by the government from rural provinces far from the capital. People in the area stated that the children had been paid and were also promised [[chelo kebab]] dinners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Child&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran 'using child soldiers' to suppress Tehran protests |author=Robert Tait |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/mar/13/iran-child-soldiers-tehran-protests |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=13 March 2011 |accessdate=15 March 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The executive director of the International Campaign for Human Rights in Iran Hadi Ghaemi stated that &quot;it's really a violation of international law. It's no different than [[child soldiers]], which is the custom in many zones of conflict. They are being recruited into being part of the conflict and armed for it.&quot; He also commented that &quot;they are very keen to display violence. Teenage boys are notorious for that. They are being used to ensure there is a good ratio of government forces to protesters and because the average policeman in Tehran could have some kind of family connection to the people they have to beat up. It's a classic tactic to bring people from outside, because they have no sense of sympathy for city dwellers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Child&quot;/&gt;

==International reactions==
;Supranational bodies
*{{flag|European Union}} At the meeting in [[Brussels]] of the 27 members of the European Union on February 21, seven of the EU countries &quot;called for sanctions to be adopted when the ministers gather again next month&quot; against Iran for their human rights violations. This was in response to the government's actions in terms of the protesters and because of the execution of &quot;[[Zahra Bahrami]], an Iranian-Dutch national sentenced for drug trafficking&quot;, on February 4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Iran rights abuse raises threat of new EU sanctions |author= |url=http://www.iranfocus.com/en/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22826:iran-rights-abuse-raises-threat-of-new-eu-sanctions-&amp;catid=5:human-rights&amp;Itemid=27 |newspaper=[[Iran Focus]] |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
