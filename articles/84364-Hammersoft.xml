'''Chris Date''' (born 1941) is an independent author, lecturer, researcher, and consultant, specializing in relational database theory. 

==Biography==
Chris Date attended [[RGS High Wycombe|High Wycombe Royal Grammar School (U.K.)]] from 1951 to 1958 and received his [[Bachelor of Arts| BA]] in [[Mathematics]] from [[Cambridge University]] (U.K.) in 1962. He entered the computer business as a mathematical programmer at [[LEO (computer)|Leo Computers Ltd]]. (London), where he quickly moved into education and training. In 1966, he earned his Master's degree at Cambridge, and, in 1967, he joined [[IBM]] Hursley (UK) as a [[programming]] instructor. Between 1969 and 1974, he was a principal instructor in IBMâs European education program.

While working at [[IBM]] he was involved in technical planning and design for the IBM products [[SQL/DS]] and [[IBM DB2|DB2]].
He was also involved with [[Edgar F. Codd]]âs [[relational model]] for database management.  
He left IBM in 1983 and has written extensively of the relational model, in association with [[Hugh Darwen]].

His book ''An Introduction to Database Systems'', currently in its 8th edition, is widely regarded as one of the fundamental texts on the subject. It has sold well over 700,000 copies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sfdama.org/NewsletterArchive/2007/newsletter2007-01.htm| title= Data Management Association, January 2007 Newsletter}}&lt;/ref&gt; not counting translations, and is used by several hundred colleges and universities worldwide.  

He is also the author of many other books on [[data management]], most notably ''Databases, Types, and the Relational Model'', subtitled and commonly referred to as ''[[The Third Manifesto]]'', currently in its third edition (note that earlier editions were titled differently, but maintained the same subtitle), a detailed and sweeping proposal for the future direction of [[DBMS]]s.
