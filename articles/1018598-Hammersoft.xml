The '''South Africa national football team''' ({{lang-af|Suid-Afrikaanse nasionale sokkerspan}}) represents [[South Africa]] in [[association football]] and is controlled by the [[South African Football Association]], the governing body for [[football in South Africa]]. South Africa's home ground is [[FNB Stadium|Soccer City]], known as FNB Stadium due to a naming rights deal, in [[Johannesburg]]. The team's current head coach is [[Pitso Mosimane]]. They returned to the world stage in 1992, after years of being banned from [[FIFA]] due to the [[South Africa under apartheid|apartheid]] system. In 2010, South Africa became the first [[Africa]]n nation to host the [[FIFA World Cup]] when it hosted the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|19th FIFA World Cup]] in June and July 2010. The team's [[Siphiwe Tshabalala]] was also the first person to score in this World Cup during the opening game against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Despite defeating [[France national football team|France]] 2â1 in their final game of the Group Stage, they failed to progress from the first round of the tournament, becoming the first host nation to do so.  South Africa had hosted the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] in [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|2009]]. The team's highest achievement was winning the [[African Cup of Nations]] at home in [[1996 Africa Cup of Nations|1996]].

==History==
===Pre-1992===
Football first arrived in South Africa through colonialism in the late nineteenth century, as the game was popular among British soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goldblatt |first=David |title=The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football |publisher=Penguin|location=London |year=2007 |pages=90â91 |isbn=978-0-14-101582-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the earliest days of the sport in South Africa until the end of apartheid, organised football was affected by the country's system of racial segregation. The all-white Football Association of South Africa (FASA), was formed in 1892, while the South African [[Indian South Africans|Indian]] Football Association (SAIFA), the South African [[Bantu speaking peoples of South Africa|Bantu]] Football Association (SABFA) and the South African [[Coloured]] Football Association (SACFA) were founded in 1903, 1933 and 1936 respectively.

South Africa was one of four African nations to attend FIFA's 1953 congress, at which the four demanded, and won, representation on the FIFA executive committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt493&quot;&gt;Goldblatt, ''The Ball is Round: A Global History of Football'', p493&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the four nations (South Africa, [[Ethiopia]], [[Egypt]] and [[Sudan]]) founded the [[Confederation of African Football]] in 1956,&lt;ref name=&quot;Goldblatt493&quot;/&gt; and the South African representative, Fred Fell, sat at the first meeting as a founding member. It soon became clear however that South Africa's constitution prohibited racially mixed teams from competitive sport and so they could only send either an all-black side or an all-white side to the planned [[1957 African Cup of Nations]]. This was unacceptable to the other members of the Confederation and South Africa were disqualified from the competition, however some sources{{Who|date=September 2011}} say that they withdrew voluntarily.

At the second CAF conference in 1958 South Africa were formally expelled from CAF. The all-white (FASA) were admitted to [[FIFA]] in the same year, but in August 1960 it was given an ultimatum of one year to fall in line with the non-discriminatory regulations of FIFA. On 26 September 1961 at the annual FIFA conference, the South African association was formally suspended from FIFA. [[Stanley Rous|Sir Stanley Rous]], president of [[The Football Association]] of England and a champion of South Africa's FIFA membership, was elected FIFA President a few days later. Rous was adamant that sport, and FIFA in particular, should not embroil itself in political matters and against fierce opposition he continued to resist attempts to expel South Africa from FIFA. The suspension was lifted in January 1963 after a visit to South Africa by Rous in order to investigate the state of football in the country.

Rous declared that if the suspension were not lifted, football there would be discontinued, possibly to the point of no recovery. The next annual conference of FIFA in October 1964 took place in Tokyo and was attended by a larger contingent of representatives from African and Asian associations and here the suspension of South Africa's membership was re-imposed. In 1976, after the [[Soweto uprising]], they were formally expelled from FIFA.

In 1991, when the apartheid system was beginning to be demolished, a new multi-racial South African Football Association was formed, and admitted to FIFA â and thus finally allowing South Africa to enter the qualifying stages for subsequent World Cups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2010/06/21/boycott-north-korea-in-the-world-cup.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992 to 1994===
On 7 July 1992, the South African national team played its first game in two decades, beating [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]] 1â0 at [[Kings Park Stadium|Kings Park]] in [[Durban]].

The team entered the [[1994 Africa Cup of Nations qualification|1994 Africa Cup of Nations qualifiers]] and was placed in Group 5, along with [[Mauritius national football team|Mauritius]], [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] and [[Zimbabwe national football team|Zimbabwe]]. They won one game, away to Mauritius, and drew to Mauritius and Zimbabwe at home. The team finished third in the group and failed to qualify.

For the [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CAF â First Round)|1994 FIFA World Cup qualifiers]] South Africa was placed in Group D, along with [[Congo national football team|Congo]], [[Libya national football team|Libya]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. Libya withdrew from the qualifiers. South Africa beat Congo home and away.The drew to Nigeria at home and lost away. South Africa finished second in the group, and failed to qualify for the next stage of the qualifiers.

===1995 to 1998===
They hosted (and won) the [[1996 Africa Cup of Nations]]. The team were losing finalists at the [[1998 Africa Cup of Nations]]. South Africa qualified for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], but failed to progress past the group stage.

===1999 to 2002===
The team lost during finished third at the [[2000 Africa Cup of Nations]] and were progressed to the quarter finals at the [[2002 Africa Cup of Nations]]. South Africa qualified for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], but failed to progress past the group stage.

===2003 to 2006===
The team was eliminated during the group stage at both the [[2004 Africa Cup of Nations|2004]] and [[2006 Africa Cup of Nations]].

===2007 to 2010===
South Africa failed to impress local supporters by not scoring a single goal in the African Nations Cup of 2006. In light of these poor performances it was decided that the hiring of a more experienced manager was essential. Rumours began to fly, prior to the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]], that England coach [[Sven-GÃ¶ran Eriksson]] was to be the man for the job, with SAFA apparently offering him R30 million to take Bafana Bafana to glory in 2010. However this has since been denied. 

The former Brazil coach [[Carlos Alberto Parreira]] accepted the job. He signed a R100 million contract covering four years. His term as manager started 1 January 2007 targeting the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] but he resigned in April 2008 due to family reasons. [[Joel Santana]] signed to coach until 2010,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/soccer/wires/04/22/2080.ap.la.spt.soc.south.africa.santana.0414/index.html CNN]{{dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was fired in late 2009. Carlos Alberto Parreira then returned to coach the team.

The team was eliminated during the group stage of the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations]]. They were losing semifinalists at the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]], but failed to qualify for the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations]].

During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the team played a good tournament, despite not making it past the group stage. South Africa tied 1-1 with Mexico in the opener, scoring first. They lost 3-0 to Uruguay despite showing some promise early in the game. They were able to defeat France 2-1 mostly dominating the game, but because of goal difference, they could not advance to the Round of 16.

===2011===
South Africa failed to qualify for the [[2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification|Africa Cup of Nations]] finals after the rules were misread.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/capeargus/sa-football-stands-embarrassed-1.1153838 &quot;SA football stands embarrassed&quot;] ''iol.co.za''. 10 October 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; They ultimately played for and achieved a draw at home in [[Nelspruit]] against Sierra Leone in a game they needed to win, when news about Niger trailing in Egypt was received, leading to the qualification of Niger at their and also Sierra Leone expense. They then celebrated at the end as if they had qualified making it the second time they will be so embarrassed in 4 years after qualifying as a lucky 3rd and last best runners-up for the [[2008 Africa Cup of Nations qualification#Group 11|2008]] edition with [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]] catapulting over South Africa as Group winners after a 3-1 win in [[Cape Town]] - and thereby gaining an automatic qualifying ticket on head to head record with the South Africans erroneously thinking goal difference will be the primary tie-breaker.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iol.co.za/sport/bemused-bafana-in-the-dark-over-procedure-1.577948 &quot;Bemused Bafana 'in the dark' over procedure&quot;] ''iol.co.za''. 11 September 2007. &lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]] also announced that the team had qualified and the [[South African Football Association|SAFA]] president [[Kirsten Nematandani]] then congratulated the team on TV before realization dawned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/oct/09/south-africa-africa-cup-of-nations &quot;South Africa miss out on Africa Cup of Nations after misreading rules&quot;]. Reuters/''The Guardian''. 9 October 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; [[South African Football Association|SAFA]] said they would appeal to [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] but the appeal was later withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/oct/10/south-africa-africa-cup-nations?intcmp=239 &quot;South Africa appeal to CAF following Africa Cup of Nations mix-up&quot;]. Reuters/''The Guardian''. 10 October 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.football365.co.za/story/0,22162,14287_7251423,00.html &quot;SAFA withdraw AFCON appeal&quot;]. ''football365.co.za''. 19 October 2011. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Nickname==
&quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; is a nickname given to the national side by its fans, it is [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and translates as &quot;the boys, the boys&quot;. Its actual meaning [to those who understand Zulu deeply]'Go boys! Go boys !'   

In July 1992, at Kingspark stadium in Durban fans shouted 'Bafana bafana' which means 'Go boys go boys' when South Africa was on the verge to beat Cameroon and also after the game  then a group of three journalists from South Africa newspaper, [[The Sowetan]], began to use the name in print media when referring to the team. The name was used informally, as SAFA felt that the name was not commercially viable, and that it was degrading to refer to a team of men as boys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bafana Bafana - Who Owns This Nickname for the South African Soccer Team?
|url=http://www.spoor.com/home/index.php?ipkMenuID=&amp;ipkArticleID=167|publisher=Spoor.com|accessdate=23 September 2011|date=2 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Standton Woodrush Ltd applied for a patent of the name in 1993. The name was patented granted, however it was for clothing only. In 1994, the team's technical sponsor at the time, Kappa, applied for the trademarks to the names &quot;Bafana&quot; and &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; in class 25. These rights were granted, and subsequently passed on to SAFA. In 1997, SAFA filed for the trademark &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; for all goods and services, in all classes.

SAFA then applied to have Standton Woodrush Ltd removed from the Trade Marks register, on the grounds that SAFA was the rightful owner of the name. The case was dismissed on the ground that SAFA was not an interested person within the meaning of this term as used in the Trade Marks Act No. 94 of 1993, which provides that only an interested party has legal standing to seek relief. 

SAFA made another application to gain ownership of the trade mark, with the second application going to the Appeal Court. The court again found that SAFA did not have the grounds to ownership of the name in all classes. The court held that an intention to use a mark does not create a preference to registration, and that the proprietor of a trade mark need not be its originator.

In 2011 SAFA paid R5 million to  Standton Woodrush Ltd. This allowed SAFA to own the rights to the name &quot;Bafana Bafana&quot; in class 25, and all other classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAFA settle on R5m fee for Bafana name|url=http://www.mtnfootball.com/live/content.php?Item_ID=45819|publisher=MTN Football|accessdate=25 June 2011|date=25 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home stadium==
The South Africa national football team does not use a single stadium as its home stadium for matches. Instead, they use a variety of stadiums throughout South Africa to host matches at.

The largest venue used is the 94 700-seater [[FNB Stadium|Soccer City]] in [[Soweto]], outside [[Johannesburg]]. Other often used venues include the [[Atteridgeville Super Stadium]], outside [[Pretoria]], the [[Royal Bafokeng Stadium]], outside [[Rustenburg]], the [[Free State Stadium]] in [[Bloemfontein]] and [[Moses Mabhida Stadium]] in [[Durban]].

Matches have also been hosted at [[Ellis Park Stadium|Ellis Park]] in Johannesburg, [[Kings Park Stadium|Kings Park]] in Durban, [[Cape Town Stadium]] and [[Newlands Stadium]] in [[Cape Town]], [[Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium]] and the [[EPRU Stadium]] in [[Port Elizabeth]], [[Loftus Versfeld Stadium|Loftus Versfeld]] in Pretoria, [[Orlando Stadium]] in Soweto, [[Mbombela Stadium]] in [[Nelspruit]], [[Peter Mokaba Stadium]] in [[Polokwane]] and [[Hoffe Park Stadium]] in [[Kimberley, Northern Cape|Kimberley]].

The team has also hosted matches outside of South Africa. In preparation for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]], the team hosted a friendly in [[Baiersbronn]], [[Germany]].  As a warm-up for the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]], the team hosted a friendly at [[Mong Kok Stadium]] in [[Hong Kong]]. In 2006 the team hosted a Nelson Mandela Challenge match at [[Griffin Park]], in [[London]], [[England]]. During their preparations for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], the team hosted two matches in Germany. The matches were played at the [[BRITA-Arena]] in [[Wiesbaden]] and the [[Stadion am Bieberer Berg]] in [[Offenbach am Main]].

==Media coverage==
The [[South African Football Association]] owns the rights to national team matches played in South Africa. SAFA currently have a contract with the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], to broadcast these matches. It is up to the SABC to procure the rights to matches played outside of the country.

The SABC usually shows most national team games, though they have often had problems with broadcasting weekday matches. They have previously used delayed live footage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Safa blamed for Bafana's delayed live broadcast last night|url=http://www.sabcnews.com/portal/site/SABCNews/menuitem.5c4f8fe7ee929f602ea12ea1674daeb9/?vgnextoid=aa0424b9e9928210VgnVCM10000077d4ea9bRCRD&amp;vgnextfmt=default|publisher=SABC News|date=23 April 2010|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
, and sometimes not shown matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Another own goal for SABC
|url=http://www.sport24.co.za/Soccer/BafanaBafana/Another-own-goal-for-SABC-20101010|publisher=News24|date=10 October 2010|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most large tournaments in which the team play, such as the [[FIFA World Cup]] and [[Africa Cup of Nations]], have separate broadcast rights.[[SuperSport (TV channel)|Supersport]] purchase the pay tv rights to these tournaments, thus during these tournaments, they also show South African matches. The SABC usually holds the free to air rights to these tournaments, with the notable exception being the [[2002 FIFA World Cup]]. Those matches were shown be e.tv.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SA FREE CHANNEL WINS 2002 WORLD CUP RIGHTS

==Sponsors==
The team's kit has traditionally been made up of combinations of the colours green and gold, the country's sporting colours. There was however, a period in the early 2000s, when the team wore a predominately white kit. The current home kit is mostly gold, while the away kit is mostly green.

When the team returned to international football in 1992, their kit was supplied by Italian clothing company, [[Kappa (company)|Kappa]]. The team wore Kappa kits up to and during the [[1998 FIFA World Cup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bafana to be decked out in Puma|url=http://www.sowetanlive.co.za/sport/2010/11/17/bafana-to-be-decked-out-in-puma|publisher=The Sowetan|accessdate=2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1998 World Cup, the kits for all South African national football teams have been supplied by German sports apparel company [[Adidas]]. The sponsorship deal is believed to be worth R14 million per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Companies want more bang for their sponsorship buck|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/sport/soccer/article798580.ece/Companies-want-more-bang-for-their-sponsorship-buck|publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=5 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their contract with the [[South African Football Association]] runs until the end of 2010.

The team has two main sponsors, [[Absa Group|ABSA]] and [[SABMiller|South African Breweries]], which sponsors the team under their Castle Lager brand. The team's techinal sponsor was [[Adidas]], and its broadcast sponsor is the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation|SABC]]. Other sponsors are [[Avis Rent a Car System|AVIS]], [[Coca-Cola]], Internet Solutions, [[Mercedes-Benz|Mercedes-Benz South Africa]] , [[Netcare]], [[South African Airways]], [[Sasol|SASOL]], [[Southern Sun Hotel Group|Southern Sun]] and [[Vodacom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Partners|url=http://slam.co.za/bb_partners.aspx|publisher=SAFA Licensing and Media|accessdate=18 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 June 2011, SAFA announced [[Puma AG|Puma]] as its new technical sponsor and unveiled Bafana Bafana's new kit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New Sponsor and kit|url=http://eyewitnessnews.co.za/Story.aspx?Id=67438|publisher=Eyewitness News|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://footballfashion.org/wordpress/2011/06/07/south-africa-puma-201112-home-and-away-kits-jerseys/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==International record==
===FIFA World Cup Profile===
Although South Africa has made three appearances in the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], they have not made it past the first round. The team's first attempt to qualify as for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup]]. The team finished second in their group, behind [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]], who went on to play at the World Cup. Their first appearance was in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|France 1998]], six years after they had been readmitted to the global football family. Despite a 3â0 drubbing to [[France national football team|France]] in their opening game, they went on to draw against [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]] and [[Saudi Arabia national football team|Saudi Arabia]], the team finished third and thus exited the tournement. [[2002 FIFA World Cup|Korea/Japan 2002]] was expected to be an opportunity for Bafana Bafana to step up to the next level but they were eliminated at the group stage despite drawing to [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]] and beating [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] 1â0 for their first-ever World Cup win. The team finished third in their group, losing out to Paraguay on goal difference. The team failed to qualify for the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] after finishing third in their qualifying group. [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] won the group and progressed to the tournement, while [[Congo DR national football team|Congo DR]] finished ahead of South Africa on head to head results. During the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in [[South Africa]], they beat [[France national football team|France]] 2â1 and drew 1â1 to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], but lost 0â3 to [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]]. They lost out on progression to the round of 16, on goal difference, for their second World Cup in a row.
