'''Glam rock''' (also known as '''glitter rock''') is a style of [[rock music|rock]] and [[pop music]] that developed in the UK in the early 1970s, which was performed by singers and musicians who wore outrageous clothes, makeup and hairstyles, particularly platform-soled boots and glitter.&lt;ref name = Encarta&gt;{{cite web |work=[[Encarta]] | url = http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_561509274/glam_rock.html |title=Glam Rock |accessdate = 21 December 2008|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257013401672884|archivedate=2009-10-31|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The flamboyant costumes and visual styles of glam performers were often [[camp (style)|camp]] or [[androgyny|androgynous]], and have been connected with new views of [[gender roles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|title=The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'N' Roll|year=1995|publisher=Serpents Tail|location=London|page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glam rock visuals peaked during the mid 1970s with artists including [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]], [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]] and [[Gary Glitter]] in the UK and [[New York Dolls]], [[Lou Reed]] and [[Jobriath]] in the US.

==Characteristics==
Musically glam rock was very diverse, varying between the simple [[rock and roll]] revivalism of figures like [[Alvin Stardust]] to the complex art rock of [[Roxy Music]], and can be seen as much as a fashion as a musical sub-genre.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shuker2005pp124-5&quot;/&gt; Visually it was a mesh of various styles, ranging from 1930s [[Hollywood]] glamour, through 1950s pin-up sex appeal, pre-war [[Cabaret]] theatrics, [[Victorian literature|Victorian]] literary and [[symbolist]] styles, [[science fiction]], to ancient and occult [[mysticism]] and [[mythology]]; manifesting itself in outrageous clothes, makeup, hairstyles, and platform-soled boots.&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), ISBN 0754640574, pp. 57, 63, 87 and 141.&lt;/ref&gt; Glam is most noted for its sexual and gender ambiguity and representations of [[androgyny]], beside extensive use of theatrics.&lt;ref name=AllmusicGR&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=explore|id=style/d388|pure_url=yes}} &quot;Glam rock&quot;], ''Allmusic'', retrieved 26 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; It was prefigured by the showmanship and gender identity manipulation of American acts such as [[The Cockettes]] and [[Alice Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), ISBN 0472068687, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:David-Bowie Early.jpg|thumb|180px|right|[[David Bowie]] during the [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders]] Tour.]]
Glam rock emerged out of the English [[psychedelic rock|psychedelic]] and [[art rock]] scenes of the late 1960s and can be seen as both an extension of, and reaction against, those trends.&lt;ref name=Shuker2005pp124-5&gt;R. Shuker, ''Popular Music: the Key Concepts'' (Abingdon: Routledge, 2nd edn., 2005), ISBN 0-415-34770-X, pp. 124-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are associated with [[Marc Bolan]], who had renamed his folk duo [[T. Rex (band)|T. Rex]] and taken up electric instruments by the end of the 1960s. Often cited as the moment of inception is his appearance on the UK TV programme ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' in March 1971 wearing glitter and satins, to perform what would be his second UK Top 10 hit (and first UK Number 1 hit), &quot;[[Hot Love (T. Rex song)|Hot Love]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Paytress, ''Bolan - The Rise And Fall Of A 20th Century Superstar'' ([[Omnibus Press]] 2002) ISBN 0711992932, pp 180-181&lt;/ref&gt; From late 1971, already a minor star, [[David Bowie]] developed his [[The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars|Ziggy Stardust]] persona, incorporating elements of professional make up, mime and performance into his act.&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p72&gt;P. Auslander, &quot;Watch that man David Bowie: Hammersmith Odeon, London, July 3, 1973&quot; in I. Inglis, ed., ''Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), ISBN 0754640574, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt; These performers were soon followed in the style by acts including Roxy Music, [[Sweet (band)|Sweet]], [[Slade]], [[Mott the Hoople]], [[Mud (band)|Mud]] and Alvin Stardust.&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p72/&gt; While highly successful in the single charts in the UK, very few of these musicians were able to make a serious impact in the United States; Bowie was the major exception becoming an international superstar and prompting the adoption of glam styles among acts like [[Lou Reed]], [[Iggy Pop]], [[New York Dolls]] and [[Jobriath]], often known as &quot;glitter rock&quot; and with a darker lyrical content than their British counterparts.&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p80&gt;P. Auslander, &quot;Watch that man David Bowie: Hammersmith Odeon, London, July 3, 1973&quot; in Ian Inglis, ed., ''Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), ISBN 0754640574, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the UK the term glitter rock was most often used to refer to the extreme version of glam pursued by [[Gary Glitter]] and his support musicians the [[Glitter Band]], who between them achieved eighteen top ten singles in the UK between 1972 and 1976.&lt;ref name=Bogdanov2002Glitter&gt;V.

Erlewine, ''All Music Guide to Rock: the Definitive Guide to Rock, Pop, and Soul'' (Milwaukee, WI: Backbeat Books, 3rd edn., 2002), ISBN 0-87930-653-X, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt; A second wave of glam rock acts, including [[Suzi Quatro]], [[Roy Wood]]'s [[Wizzard]] and [[Sparks (band)|Sparks]], dominated the British single charts from about 1974 to 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhodes|first=Lisa|title=Ladyland: Women and Rock Culture|year=2005|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|location=Philadelphia|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p72/&gt; Quatro directly inspired the pioneering Los Angeles based all-girl group [[The Runaways]].&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), ISBN 0754640574, pp. 222-3.&lt;/ref&gt; From this second wave of glam rockers emerged a group of female artists who exemplified the androgynous look and hard-rocking attitude, including Quatro, Joan Jett and the Runaways, and Heart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Mina Julia|title=Girls Rock! Fifty Years of Women Making Music|year=2004|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|location=Lexington, KY|coauthors=Tisa Lewis, Susan Maxine Shaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Existing acts, some not usually considered central to the genre, also adopted glam styles, including [[Rod Stewart]], [[Elton John]], [[Queen (band)|Queen]] and, for a time, even the [[Rolling Stones]].&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p72/&gt; [[Punk rock]], often seen as a reaction to the artifice of glam rock, but using some elements of the genre including makeup and involving covers versions of glam rock records,&lt;ref&gt;S. Frith and A. Goodwin, ''On Record: Rock, Pop, and the Written Word'' (Pantheon Books, 1990), ISBN 0394564758, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; helped end the fashion for glam from about 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auslander2006p80&quot;/&gt;

== Subsequent influence ==

Although glam rock went into a steep decline in popularity in the second half of the 1970s it was a direct influence on acts that rose to prominence later, including [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] and American [[glam metal]] acts like [[Quiet Riot]], [[W.A.S.P.]], [[Twisted Sister]] and [[MÃ¶tley CrÃ¼e]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Moore, ''Sells Like Teen Spirit: Music, Youth Culture, and Social Crisis'' (New York, NY: New York University Press, 2009), ISBN 0814757480, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; It was a major influence on the [[New Romantic]]s in Britain, acts like [[Adam Ant]] and [[Flock of Seagulls]] extended it, and its androgyny and sexual politics were picked up by acts including [[Culture Club]], [[Bronski Beat]] and [[Frankie Goes to Hollywood]].&lt;ref name=Auslander2006p79&gt;P. Auslander, &quot;Watch that man David Bowie: Hammersmith Odeon, London, July 3, 1973&quot; in I. Inglis, ed., ''Performance and Popular Music: History, Place and Time'' (Aldershot: Ashgate, 2006), ISBN 0754640574, p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; It also had an influence on the formation of [[gothic rock]], which was completely informed by the make-up, clothes, theatricality and sound, and even on [[punk rock]], which adopted some of the performance and persona-creating tendencies of the genre, as well as the genre's emphasis on pop-art qualities and simple but powerful instrumentation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Auslander2006p80&quot;/&gt; In [[Japan]] in the 1990s, [[visual kei]] was strongly influenced by glam rock aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;I. Condry, ''Hip-hop Japan: Rap and the Paths of Cultural Globalization'' (Duke University Press, 2006), ISBN 0822338920, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Glam has since enjoyed continued influence and sporadic modest revivals in [[R&amp;B]] crossover act [[Prince (musician)|Prince]],&lt;ref&gt;P. Auslander, ''Performing Glam Rock: Gender and Theatricality in Popular Music'' (Ann Arbor, MI: University of Michigan Press, 2006), ISBN 0754640574, p. 227.&lt;/ref&gt; and bands such as [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]],&lt;ref&gt;P. Buckley, ''The Rough Guide to Rock'' (London: Rough Guides, 3rd edn., 2003), ISBN 1843531054, p. 796.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chainsaw Kittens]] and [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]].&lt;ref&gt;R.
