'''WebMoney''' is an [[electronic money]] and online payment system (transactions are conducted through '''WebMoney Transfer'''). WM Transfer Ltd, the owner and administrator of WebMoney Transfer Online Payment System, was founded in 1998 and is a legal corporate entity of [[Belize]], [[Central America]]. Originally targeted mainly at [[Russia]]n clients, it is now used worldwide. The company claims to have more than 11 million users.&lt;ref&gt;https://newsblog.wmtransfer.com/asp/comments.asp?blogID=6&amp;MessageID=16336&lt;/ref&gt;

As of Dec 17 2010, [[Steam (software)|Steam]] accepts WebMoney as a payment method.&lt;ref&gt;http://store.steampowered.com/news/4806/&lt;/ref&gt;

An unrelated Japanese company provides a similar online payment system using the same name. However, the Japanese service only supports accounts denominated in [[Japanese yen|yen]] and anonymity is not as strong as in WebMoney.

==Currency==
Every account, known as a &quot;purse&quot;, is run in [[Gold]]-equivalents (WMG), [[US Dollar]]-equivalents (WMZ), [[Russian ruble|ruble]]-equivalents (WMR), [[Belarusian ruble]]-equivalents [WMB] [[euro]]-equivalents (WME) or [[Ukrainian hryvnia|hryvnia]]-equivalents (WMU). 
From May 31, 2011 system supports [[Vietnamese Äá»ng]]-equivalents (WMV), but only through mobile phone interface,.&lt;ref&gt;http://owebmoney.ru/inform/?id=351&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wmtransfer.vn/&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, [[Kyrgyzstani som]] and [[Uzbekistani som]]-equivalents (WMS) and (WMY) were expluatated, but canceled by central system authority.

Accounts are identified by strings called WM-IDs; account holders can remain completely anonymous towards each other.

Signing up and receiving webmoney (known as &quot;WM units&quot;) from other users is free; sending WM units to other accounts incurs a fee of 0.8%. Funds can be deposited into or withdrawn from webmoney accounts by [[money order]], [[wire transfer]], by conversion from other [[electronic currency|electronic currencies]], or by cash transactions at authorized exchange offices; all of these incur various fees. It is also possible to purchase WM cards for $10â$100 in order to fund an account.

==Made for CIS==
The main address for technical support is given in [[Moscow]]; the main proprietor and administrator is located in [[Belize]]. Transactions in WMR are underwritten by WMR LLC in Moscow and transactions in WME and WMZ are underwritten by Amstar Holdings Limited.

Besides CIS and Eastern European countries, WebMoney has offices in such countries as USA, Netherlands, Spain, Japan, Greece, Israel, France, UAE.

==Security==
WebMoney transactions do not require a credit card or bank account and are final and cannot be retracted; this is similar to [[e-gold]] and [[cash]] and unlike [[credit card]] transactions and [[PayPal]].

==Criticism==
* WebMoney isn't integrated into an international financial system. It doesn't offer to fill purse using international credit cards. It doesn't accept [[Western Union]] or [[Paypal]] transfers. There are some third parties offering such services for [[commission (remuneration)|commission]] fees.
* The routine need to use third parties for many operations with WebMoney raises the question of trust and the possibility of fraud.
* User accounts can be blocked without explanation or for critique of the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.webplanet.ru/news/law/2008/02/08/webmoney.html |title=WebMoney Ð·Ð°Ð±Ð»Ð¾ÐºÐ¸ÑÐ¾Ð²Ð°Ð» Ð½ÐµÐ´Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð¿Ð¾Ð»ÑÐ·Ð¾Ð²Ð°ÑÐµÐ»Ñ |language=Russian |trans_title=Webmoney has blocked unsatisfied user | date=8 Feb 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://webplanet.ru/news/service/2010/12/09/wm_polizey.html |title=Webmoney Ð·Ð°Ð±Ð°Ð½Ð¸Ð»Ð¸ ÐºÐ¾Ð»ÑÐ¼Ð½Ð¸ÑÑÐ° &quot;ÐÐµÐ±Ð¿Ð»Ð°Ð½ÐµÑÑ&quot;...
