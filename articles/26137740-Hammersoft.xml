==History==
Kansas State Volleyball has been one of the most successful programs in the [[Big 12 Conference]] and the nation
under the direction of Coach Suzie Fritz since becoming the head coach in 2001. The Wildcats have reached the
NCAA Tournament each year but one with Fritz at the helm.  The Wildcats have the third highest winning percentage in the Big 12 overall and in conference play. K-State has also made its impact on the national scene finishing in the AVCA Top 25 Coaches Poll every year but one with an average final ranking of 19. Only one other Big 12 team has been ranked in the final coaches poll more than K-State in the Fritz era.  The Wildcats to a home winning percentage of .772 over the last eight seasons.  K-State has made its impact on the court as well with 13 All-Big 12 First Team selections since 2001.

The Wildcat volleyball team has been more successful in the classroom than any other program in the Big 12
since Fritz took over at K-State. No other Big 12 team has had more Academic All-Big 12 First Team selections
than the Wildcats. The success of the Wildcats in the classroom comes from every player as K-State has been
awarded the AVCA Team Academic Award seven times since Fritz has been head coach and eight total since the inception
of the award for the 1992â93 academic year.
