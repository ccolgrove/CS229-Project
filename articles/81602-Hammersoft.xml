'''Glendale''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|É¡|l|É|n|d|eÉª|l}}) is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], United States. As of the 2010 Census, the city population is 191,719, down from 194,973 at the 2000 census.&lt;ref&gt;[http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL1.ST13&amp;prodType=table# Census.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; making it the third largest city in Los Angeles County and the [[List of largest California cities by population|22nd largest city in the state of California]]. It is also one of the two large cities in the United States that shares its name with a larger American city ([[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Arizona]]).  

Glendale lies at the eastern end of the [[San Fernando Valley]], bisected by the [[Verdugo Mountains]], and is a [[suburb]] in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]]. The city is bordered to the northwest by the [[Sun Valley, Los Angeles, California|Sun Valley]] and [[Tujunga, Los Angeles, California|Tujunga]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles; to the northeast by [[La CaÃ±ada Flintridge, California|La CaÃ±ada Flintridge]] and the unincorporated area of [[La Crescenta, California|La Crescenta]]; to the west by [[Burbank, California|Burbank]] and [[Griffith Park]]; to the east by [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California|Eagle Rock]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]; to the south by the [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles, California|Atwater Village]] neighborhood of Los Angeles; and to the southeast by [[Glassell Park, Los Angeles, California|Glassell Park]] neighborhood of Los Angeles. The [[Golden State Freeway|Golden State]], [[Ventura Freeway|Ventura]], [[Glendale Freeway|Glendale]], and [[Foothill Freeway|Foothill]] [[freeway]]s run through the city.  

Glendale's [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale|Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery]] contains the remains of many noted celebrities and local residents. Glendale is also home to one of the largest communities of Armenians in the United States, with one in four people in Glendale being Armenian.

==History==
[[Image:Glendale-1870s.jpg|thumb|left|The Glendale area in the 1870s.]]
The area was long inhabited by the [[Tongva people]] (or &quot;People of the Earth&quot;), who were later renamed the GabrieleÃ±os by the Spanish missionaries, after the nearby [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel]].

In 1798, [[Jose Maria Verdugo|JosÃ© MarÃ­a Verdugo]], a [[corporal]] in the Spanish army from [[Baja California (peninsula)|Baja California]], received the [[Rancho San Rafael]] from Governor [[Diego de Borica]], formalizing his possession and use of land on which he had been grazing livestock and farming since 1784. Rancho San Rafael was a Spanish concession, of which 25 were made in California.  Unlike the later Mexican land grants, the concessions were similar to grazing permits, with the title remaining with the Spanish crown.&lt;ref&gt;Beck, Warren A., Haase, Ynez D. (1974). ''Historical Atlas of California''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1860 His grandson [[Jose Maria Verdugo#Julio Verdugo|Teodoro Verdugo]] built the ''Verdugo [[Adobe]]'', which is the oldest building in Glendale. The property is the location of the ''Oak of Peace'' where early [[Californio]] leaders including [[Pio Pico]] met in 1847 and decided to surrender to [[Lieutenant Colonel]] [[John C. FrÃ©mont]].

Verdugo's descendants sold the ranch in various parcels, some of which are included in present-day [[Atwater Village, Los Angeles, California|Atwater Village]], [[Eagle Rock, Los Angeles, California|Eagle Rock]], and [[Highland Park, Los Angeles, California|Highland Park]] neighborhoods of Los Angeles.
[[Image:Glendale-1910.jpg|thumb|left|Glendale, 1910.]]
In 1884, residents gathered to form a town and chose the name &quot;Glendale&quot;. Residents to the southwest formed &quot;Tropico&quot; in 1887. The [[Pacific Electric Railway]] brought streetcar service in 1904. {{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Glendale incorporated in 1906, and annexed Tropico 12 years later. An important civic [[wiktionary:booster|booster]] of the era was [[Leslie Coombs Brand]] (1859â1925), who built an estate in 1904 called ''El Miradero'' featuring an eye-catching mansion whose architecture combined characteristics of Spanish, Moorish, and Indian styles, copied from the East Indian Pavilion at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] (World's Fair) held in Chicago, which he visited. Brand loved to fly, and built a private airstrip in 1919 and hosted &quot;fly-in&quot; parties, providing a direct link to the soon-to-be-built nearby [[Grand Central Airport (United States)|Grand Central Airport]]. The grounds of ''El Miradero'' are now city-owned ''Brand Park'' and the mansion is the ''Brand Library'', according to the terms of his will.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brandlibrary.org/brand_history.asp |title=The Brand legacy, Mansion and Library |publisher=Brandlibrary.org |date=July 28, 2010 |accessdate=January 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brand partnered with [[Henry E. Huntington]] to bring the Pacific Electric Railway, or the &quot;Red Cars,&quot; to the area. Today, he is memorialized by one of the city's main thoroughfares, ''Brand Boulevard''.

[[Image:Glendale-Brand-1915.jpg|thumb|right|Looking south on Brand Blvd, 1915.]]

The city's population rose from 13,756 in 1920 to 62,736 in 1930. The [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] opened in 1917. Pioneering [[endocrinology|endocrinologist]] and entrepreneur Dr. [[Henry Harrower|Henry R. Harrower]] opened his clinic in Glendale in 1920, which for many years was the largest business in the city. The [[American Green Cross]], an early [[Conservation ethic|conservation]] and tree preservation society, was formed in 1926 (it disbanded three years later and the current organization of that name is unrelated). In 1964, Glendale was selected by [[George Lincoln Rockwell]] to be the West Coast headquarters of the [[American Nazi Party]]. Its offices, on Colorado Street in the downtown section of the city, remained open until the early 1980s.

In 1977 and 1978 ten murdered women were found in and around Glendale in what became known as the case of the [[Hillside Strangler]]. The murders were the work of [[Kenneth Bianchi]] and [[Angelo Buono]], the latter of whom resided at 703 East Colorado Street where most of the murders took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=Crime Figure |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-17/local/me-5255_1_crime-figure/2 |publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Glendale panorama.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Glendale from the southwest, with the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] in the background.]]
Glendale is located at the juncture of two large valleys, the [[San Fernando Valley|San Fernando]] and the [[San Gabriel Valley|San Gabriel]]. According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|79.212|km2|mi2|1|abbr=on}}. {{convert|30.5|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.13|sqmi|km2}} of it (0.43%) is water. It is bordered to the north by the foothill communities of [[La Canada Flintridge, California|La Canada Flintridge]], [[La Crescenta, California|La Crescenta]], and [[Tujunga]]; to the south by the [[Atwater Village]] community incorporated by the city of Los Angeles; to the east by [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]] and [[Eagle Rock, California|Eagle Rock]] (also incorporated within Los Angeles); and to the west by the city of [[Burbank, California|Burbank]].

===Geology===
Several known earthquake faults criss-cross the Glendale area and adjacent mountains, as they do most of southern California. Among the more recognized faults by seismologists are the Sierra Madre and Hollywood faults, which are situated in the city's northern and southwestern portions, respectively. Additionally, the Verdugo and Raymond faults intersect through the city's central and southeastern areas. The San Gabriel fault, meanwhile, is located northeast of the city. Roughly {{convert|75|mi|km}} northeast of Glendale, there's a major part of the [[San Andreas Fault]] known as the &quot;Big Bend,&quot; where quake-recurrence tracking shows major activity roughly every 140â160 years. The closest portion of the San Andreas is actually {{convert|29|mi|km}} from Glendale. The last major quake along the southern San Andreas was recorded in 1857.

In the [[1971 San Fernando earthquake]], which took place along the western edge of the Sierra Madre fault, there were surface ruptures nearly {{convert|12|mi|km}} long, including one portion a few miles northwest of Glendale. Most of the damage was in the northern [[San Fernando Valley]], although 31 structures in Glendale suffered major damage and had to be demolished, plus dozens of chimneys were toppled. The [[1994 Northridge earthquake]] had an epicenter about {{convert|18|mi|km}} from Glendale. The city suffered severe damage to a public parking structure and sections of the Glendale Galleria parking structures and exterior columns incurred damages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.glendale.ca.us/pdf/HMP/HMP_Sec-6_Earthquakes.pdf Ci.glendale.ca] City of Glendale report&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Glendale has a [[Mediterranean climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''Csa''). The highest recorded temperature in Glendale was 117Â°F (47Â°C) in September 2010. The lowest recorded temperature was 15 Â°F (â9 Â°C) in December 1968. The warmest month is August and the coolest month is January. The rainfall is highest in February and lowest in July. The hills and mountains of northern Glendale occasionally see snow and sleet, owing to its colder temperatures. Around every 5â10 years it snows. The last time it snowed was February 26, 2011, and snow accumulations around 2&amp;nbsp;inches were present. Sleet was present as well. Frost is common from late November to early March. Heavy rains are also common during the winter time. There are about 2 thunderstorms in Glendale per year, of which are occasionally severe and produce strong winds and hail. Every year, sometime from September to November, strong Santa Ana Winds produce 40-80&amp;nbsp;mph winds that sometimes damages property. Summers can be very warm with the highest temperature recorded at 112 degrees in 1990.  Average summer temperature is 90 degrees.

[[Grand Central Airport (United States)|Grand Central Airport]] was a municipal airport developed from 1923 which became the largest employer in Glendale for many years, and contributed to the development of aviation in the United States in many important ways. The main terminal building still stands and includes both art deco and Spanish style architectural elements. The facility was the first official terminal for the Los Angeles area as well as the departure point for the first commercial west to east transcontinental flight flown by [[Charles Lindbergh]]. During [[World War II]], the Grand Central Air Terminal building was camouflaged to protect it from enemy targeting. It was closed down in 1959, and made way for the Grand Central Business Park.

The [[Bob's Big Boy]] chain of [[hamburger]] restaurants started in Glendale on East Colorado in August 1936, and the [[Baskin-Robbins]], &quot;31 Flavors&quot; chain of [[ice cream]] parlors started in Adams Square in 1945.
