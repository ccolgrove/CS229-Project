'''LEGO Digital Designer''', or '''LDD''', is a [[Freeware|free]] computer program produced by the [[Lego Group|LEGO Group]] as a part of [[Lego Design By Me|LEGO Design byME]]. It is available for [[Mac OS|Mac]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] platforms. The program allows users to build models using virtual [[Lego|LEGO]] bricks, in a [[computer-aided design]] like manner. Through January 16, 2012, these can be uploaded, along with instructions and a box design, to the LEGO Design byME website, from where the models can be ordered for delivery as a real, packaged set. Users can also take &quot;[[screenshots]]&quot; of their models and [[Data storage device|store]] the models on their computer in a .LXF File.

== Features ==

Only a subset of the bricks made by LEGO are available for use in LDD.

LDD can generate build instructions automatically.

== End of customized model delivery service ==
On November 9, 2011, Lego announced that the Design byME service will end on January 16, 2012, citing its complexity and failure to meet the company's quality expectations. A replacement is promised, but has not been announced. In its absence, custom brick orders will have to be made via the Pick a Brick service. The closing of Design byME will not affect the ability of LDD users to print custom instructions for their models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changes to Design byME in January|url=http://designbyme.lego.com/en-us/news/default.aspx?id=302930|publisher=Lego|accessdate=2011-11-17|date=2011-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
