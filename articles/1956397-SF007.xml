'''Microsoft Internet Explorer 4''' (abbreviated as '''IE4''') is a graphical web browser released in September 1997 by [[Microsoft]], primarily for [[Microsoft Windows]], but also with versions available for [[Apple Macintosh|Apple Mac OS]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[HP-UX]]&lt;ref&gt;See [[Internet Explorer for Mac]] and [[Internet Explorer for Unix]].&lt;/ref&gt; and marketed as &quot;The Web the Way You Want It&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS History&quot;/&gt;

It was one of the main participants of the first [[browser war]]. Its distribution methods and Windows integration were involved in [[United States v. Microsoft]]. It was superseded by Microsoft [[Internet Explorer 5]] in March 1999. Version 4.0 was included with [[Windows 95]] OEM Service Release 2.5 and 4.01 in [[Windows 98]], in addition the Internet Explorer layout engine [[Trident (layout engine)|Trident]] was introduced. It attained just over 60% market share by March 1999 when [[Internet Explorer 5|IE5]] was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecounter.com/stats/1999/March/browser.php The Counter March 1999]&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2001 when [[Internet Explorer 6]] was released, IE4.x had dropped to 7% market share and IE5 had increased to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2001/August/browser.php TheCounter August 2001&lt;/ref&gt; IE4 market share dropped under 1% by 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecounter.com/stats/2004/August/browser.php The Counter August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Internet Explorer 4 is no longer available for download from Microsoft.  However, archive 16-bit and 32-bit versions are publicly available on the  Evolt.org browser archive.  These include [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win16/4.0/ieoutlookrealjava/iefull.zip Internet Explorer 4.0] (16-bit), [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/4.01/ie4.zip Internet Explorer 4.01] (32-bit), [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/4.01-sp1/ie401sp1.exe Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 1] (32-bit), and [http://www.mirrorservice.org/sites/browsers.evolt.org/browsers/ie/win32/4.01-sp2/ie401sp2.exe Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2] (32-bit). You can upgrade to a later version of IE such as 5 or 6.

==Overview==

The Internet Explorer 4 Beta was released in April 1997, and Beta in July that year. Internet Explorer 4 was released to the public in September, [[1997]] and deepened the level of integration between the web browser and the underlying operating system.  Installing version 4 on a Windows 95 or Windows NT 4 machine and choosing &quot;[[Windows Desktop Update]]&quot; would result in the traditional Windows Explorer being replaced by a version more akin to a web browser interface, as well as the Windows desktop itself being web-enabled via [[Active Desktop]].  The integration with Windows, however, was subject to numerous packaging criticisms (see [[United States v. Microsoft]]).  This option was no longer available with the installers for later versions of Internet Explorer but was not removed from the system if already installed. Internet Explorer 4 introduced support for [[Group Policy]], allowing companies to configure and lock down many aspects of the browser's configuration.  Internet Mail and News was replaced with [[Outlook Express]], and [[Microsoft Chat]] and an improved [[NetMeeting]] were also included.  This version also was included with [[Windows 98]]. '''Version 4.5''' (only for Mac) dropped support for [[68k]] Macs, but offered new features such as easier 128-bit encryption.&lt;ref&gt;http://cws.internet.com/file/11708.htm WinPlanet IE4 Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcpro.co.uk/broadband/reviews/671/internet-explorer-4.html PC Pro IE4 Review&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.macuser.co.uk/macuser/reviews/16079/microsoft-internet-explorer-v40.html MacUser IE 4 Review&lt;/ref&gt; The last non-Mac version, was 4.0 Service Pack 2, however. Uninstalling IE4 became the subject of concern to some users and was a point of contention in later lawsuits (see [[Removal of Internet Explorer]] and [[United States v. Microsoft]].)

===Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Macintosh===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Internet Explorer 4.0--System 8.1.png|thumb|right|Internet Explorer 4.0 on Mac OS 8.1]] --&gt;
{{Main|Internet Explorer for Mac}}
&lt;!-- Initial Version (2008) based on Internet Explorer for Mac IE4 section --&gt;
On January 6, 1998, at the Macworld Expo in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], Microsoft announced the release of the final version of ''Internet Explorer version 4.0 for Macintosh''. Version 4 included support for [[offline browsing]], [[Dynamic HTML]], a new faster [[Java virtual machine]] and Security Zones that allow users or administrators to limit access to certain types of web content depending on which zone (for example Intranet or Internet) the content was coming from. At the same event, Apple announced the release of [[Mac OS 8|Mac OS 8.1]], which would be bundled with IE4.

At the following year's San Francisco Macworld Expo on January 9, 1999, Microsoft announced the release of ''Internet Explorer 4.5 Macintosh Edition''. This new version, which dropped 68K processor support, introduced Form AutoFill, Print Preview, the Page Holder pane which let a user hold a page of links on one side of the screen that opened pages in the right hand and support for Mac OS technology like [[Sherlock (software)|Sherlock]].

===Internet Explorer 4 for Unix===
{{Main|Internet Explorer for UNIX}}
[[Image:Internet Explorer 4 for Solaris screenshot.png|thumb|right|Internet Explorer 4 for [[Solaris]]]]

On November 5, 1997 a [[Software release life cycle#Beta|beta]] of IE for Unix 4.0 was released for testing on Solaris.&lt;ref name=&quot;sunsite.uakom.sk&quot;&gt;[http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-11-1997/swol-11-ie4.html Microsoft's Internet Explorer 4.0 for Solaris] ([http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-11-1997/images/ie-unix.gif Screenshot]) - Robert McMillan writing for SunWorld (November 5, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, 1998 it was reported that IE 4.0 for Solaris was due in March; Tod Nielsen, general manager of Microsoft's developer relations group, joked that &quot;he wanted to launch Internet Explorer 4.0 for Unix at the [[Ripley's Believe It or Not!]] [[museum]] in [[San Francisco]]&quot; because of [[skepticism]] from those who suspected IE for Unix was [[vaporware]].&lt;ref name=&quot;www.infoworld.com&quot;&gt;[http://replay.web.archive.org/19990829191129/http://www.infoworld.com/cgi-bin/displayStory.pl?980127.wiieunix.htm Microsoft says Unix browser is on schedule] - Bob Trott writing for InfoWorld Electric (January 27, 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; It was further reported that versions for &quot;[[HP-UX]], [[AIX operating system|IBM AIX]], and [[Irix]]&quot; were planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;www.infoworld.com&quot;/&gt; (Note that at the time MainWin XDE 3.0 was only available for the &quot;Solaris [[SPARC]] 2.51 platform&quot;, but MainWin XDE 2.1 was &quot;available on Solaris SPARC 2.51, Solaris Intel 5.5.1, [[SunOS]] 4.1.4, Irix 5.3, Irix 6.2, HP UX 10.2 and IBM AIX 4.1.5.&quot;){{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} On March 4, 1998 IE 4.0 for Unix on Solaris released.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}} Later that year a version for HP-UX was released.

==Features, technology, and integrated software==
Internet Explorer 4 came with [[Active Desktop]], [[Windows Desktop Update]], [[Active Channel|Channels]], [[Frontpage Express]], [[Netmeeting]], [[Windows Media Station|NetShow]], [[Web Publishing Wizard]], [[Microsoft Chat]] 2.0 and [[RealNetworks|Progressive Networks]] [[Real Player]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MS History&quot;&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/windows/ie/community/columns/historyofie.mspx MS History&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pcpro.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.pcpro.co.uk/broadband/reviews/671/internet-explorer-4.html PC Pro: Focus: Broadband: Product Reviews: Internet Explorer 4&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Outlook Express|Outlook Express 4]] replaced [[Internet Mail and News]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MS History&quot;/&gt;

Other new features including [[Dynamic HTML]], inline [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Favicon]]s, a parental rating system, and the ability to 'subscribe' to a website in favorites, where it would notify the user of an update.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cws.internet.com/article/2240-3103.htm Internet Explorer 4 - WinPlanet Windows Software Reviews&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Stephen Reid of [[PC Pro]] noted in his review:
{{quote|But it was the Web-style view that surprised me so much on first using IE 4. This changes the way you look at Windows, with files and folders now acting like hyperlinks on a Web page; you move your cursor over them to select them, then single click to launch. Individual folders are viewed as Web pages, including My Computer and Control Panel, and any folder you wish can be customised with your choice of background.|Stephen Reid|{{cite web

===Bundled and/or integrated software===
*'''[[Microsoft Chat]] 2.0''' is a simple text [[Online chat|chatting]] program included in the [[Windows NT]]-line of operating system, including Windows NT 3.x, [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]]. It utilizes [[NetBIOS#Session service|NetBIOS session service]] and [[NetDDE]].
*'''[[Outlook Express]]''' 4.0 is the successor of [[Microsoft Internet Mail and News]], an early e-mail client add-on for [[Internet Explorer 3]]. Internet Mail and News handled only [[plain text]] and rich text ([[Rich Text Format|RTF]]) e-mail, it lacked [[HTML e-mail]]. Despite the calling it 4.0, it was its debut.
*'''[[NetMeeting]]''' is a [[VoIP]] and multi-point [[videoconferencing]] client that uses the [[H.323]] protocol for video and audio conferencing.
*'''FrontPage Express 2.0''' was a stripped-down version of [[Microsoft Frontpage]]. It was bundled with IE4, but was also available for free, and could be downloaded from online repositories.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;You can find the latest version at the www.Microsoft.com Web site&quot; in Ruth Maran et al.: ''Office 97 - Superbook'', 1998, Marangraphics, ISBN 1-896283-42-X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Frontpage Express is included with Internet Explorer to make it easy for you to upload all of your HTML pages to a server&quot; in ''Microsoft Internet Explorer 4 - Step by Step'', 1997, Catapult/Microsoft Press, ISBN 1-57231-514-8&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Real Player''' was a streaming media player made by Progressive Networks (later called [[RealNetworks]]). The first version of RealPlayer was introduced in April 1995 as RealAudio Player and was one of the first media players capable of [[streaming media]] over the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fpp&quot;&gt;[http://www.realnetworks.com/company/press/releases/2006/patent_cts.html Release History]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Active Desktop===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Windows98.png|thumb|right|The Channel Bar, appearing in [[Windows 98]], is an Active Desktop item]] --&gt;
{{Main|Active Desktop}}
'''Active Desktop''' is a feature of [[Microsoft]] [[Internet Explorer]] 4.0's optional [[Windows Desktop Update]] that allows the user to add [[Hypertext Markup Language|HTML]] content to the [[desktop metaphor|desktop]], along with some other features.  This functionality was intended to be installed on the then-current [[Windows 95]] operating system, and later [[Windows 98]]. Active Desktop placed a number of &quot;channels&quot; on the user's computer [[desktop metaphor|desktop]] that provided continually-updated information, such as news headlines and stock quotes, without requiring the user to open a [[Web browser]].

===Channels===
{{Main|Active Channel}}
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Active Channels.png|thumb|Active Channels overview in IE4]] --&gt;

'''Active Channel''' is a [[website]] type which allows synchronizing website content and viewing it offline. It makes use of the [[Channel Definition Format]], which is a way of defining a website's content and structure. Each country had different channels, so picking a country during the installation of IE 4 (and therefore [[Windows 98]]) was important. Channels could be displayed in a Channel Bar and made heavy use of [[Dynamic HTML]].

===Windows Desktop Update===
{{Main|Windows Desktop Update}}
'''Windows Desktop Update''' was an optional feature included with Internet Explorer 4, which provided several updated [[Shell (computing)|shell]] features later introduced with the '''[[Windows 98]]''' [[operating system]] for older versions of [[Microsoft Windows]]. The Windows Desktop Update also added the ability to create desk-bands like the quicklaunch bar. It also updated the Windows file manager, explorer.exe (also a shell), to be more modular and extensible.

===Trident (MSHTML)===
{{Main|Trident (layout engine)}}
Trident (MSHTML) was a layout engine introduced with IE4. It was designed as a [[Component-based software engineering|software component]] to allow [[software developer]]s to easily add web browsing functionality to their own applications.  It presents a [[Component Object Model|COM]] interface for accessing and editing web pages in any COM-supported environment, like [[C++]] and [[.NET Framework|.NET]]. For instance, a web browser control can be added to a C++ program and Trident can then be used to access the page currently displayed in the web browser and retrieve element values. Events from the web browser control can also be captured. Trident functionality becomes available by connecting the file &lt;tt&gt;mshtml.dll&lt;/tt&gt; to the software project.

===Browser Helper Object===
{{Main|Browser Helper Object}}
A '''Browser Helper Object''' ('''BHO''') is a [[Library (computer science)|DLL]] [[Module (programming)|module]] designed as a [[Plug-in (computing)|plugin]] for Internet Explorer 4.0, and provides added functionality. Most BHOs are loaded once by each new instance of Internet Explorer.

==System requirements==
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Windows Explorer 98 Second Edition.png|right|thumb|IE4 featured shell integration with [[Windows Explorer]] in [[Windows 98]]]] --&gt;

===Adoption capability overview===
Internet Explorer 4.0 had support for [[Windows 3.1]], [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]], [[Windows NT 3.x]], and [[Windows NT 4.0]] (Service Pack 3 or later). Version 4.0 was included in the first release of Windows 98, although the second edition included IE5.  However, major OS releases after Win 98 SE, such as [[Windows 2000]], supported [[Internet Explorer 5]] (or higher). Internet Explorer also supported HP-UX, Solaris, and Mac OS. IE4 supported [[68k]] Macs, although this was dropped in Internet Explorer 4.5.

===PC===
For PC, Initially [[Windows 95]] or above, 16Mb of RAM, 11Mb of disk space (minimum for install).&lt;ref name=&quot;pcpro.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

===Mac===
System Requirements for initial release of 4.0 for Mac:&lt;ref name=&quot;ie4mac&quot;&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/q180942/ Article ID 180942&lt;/ref&gt;
* Macintosh with 68030 or higher processor
* [[System 7.1]] or higher
* 8 MB of [[Random access memory|RAM]] with [[virtual memory]] on (12Mb recommended)
* 12 MB of [[hard disk]] space for IE4 and 8.5 MB of hard disk space for [[Java VM]].
* [[Open Transport]] 1.1.1 or higher or [[MacTCP]] 2.0.6 or, Config PPP or similar PPP connection software (Control Panel) with PPP (Extension).&lt;ref name=&quot;ie4mac&quot; /&gt;

IE 4.5 did not support 68k Macs.

==Encryption==
Internet Explorer 4 supported 40-bit and later 128-bit encryption through an add-on,&lt;ref&gt;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722908.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; using [[Server Gated Cryptography]] (SGC).&lt;ref name=&quot;128bit&quot;&gt;http://support.microsoft.com/kb/195833 KB195833&lt;/ref&gt; 256-bit encryption would not become available in IE for nearly 10 years until the [[Windows Vista]] version of [[Internet Explorer 7]].

128-bit encryption was available or included for these versions:&lt;ref name=&quot;128bit&quot; /&gt;
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 for Macintosh
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.5 128-Bit Edition
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 for Unix
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.01 Service Pack 2
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 for Macintosh
*Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 128-Bit Edition

If it was not possible to upgrade to 128-bit, then 40-bit (SGC) was standard.&lt;ref name=&quot;128bit&quot; /&gt;
