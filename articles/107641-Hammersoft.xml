&lt;!-- Infobox ends --&gt;

'''Irwindale''' is a city in the [[San Gabriel Valley]], in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]].  The population was 1,422 at the 2010 census, down from 1,446 at the 2000 census.

With relatively few residents, Irwindale consists mostly of [[quarry|rock quarries]], which are the major revenue source for the city. The [[Irwindale Speedway]] is also located in the city, as is the [[Santa Fe Dam Recreation Area]] near the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]], and a plant of the [[Miller Brewing Company]].  The city became the new permanent site for the annual [[Renaissance Fair|Southern California Renaissance Pleasure Faire]] in 2005, after it moved from its previous home at the Glen Helen Regional Park in [[Devore]].

Unlike the fellow low population cities [[Industry, California|Industry]] and [[Vernon, California|Vernon]], there are actual neighborhoods in Irwindale.  Irwindale is a full service city, offering police and library services.  There is a skate park, a teen center, a senior center, and a public gymnasium. The housing is centered near the southeast corner of Arrow Highway and Irwindale Avenue, with a small tract of housing in the southwest corner of the city near Cypress Avenue.

==Bell-like corruption alleged in Irwindale==
A town of modest means, with an average income of $30,000, and a poverty rate 16.4 percent is suspected of being governed by high-rolling executives. Four current and former Irwindale officials, including a council member, have been charged with misuse of public funds.  The accused city officials went on a reported five trips to New York City, between 2001 and 2005, supposedly to procure a higher bond rating for Irwindale. But prosecutors allege that they just &quot;mostly partied.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;town&quot;&gt;http://townhall.com/columnists/MonaCharen/2010/11/02/corruption_as_usual/page/full/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LA Times]] exposed the details. The city had set aside $87 million for an &quot;affordable housing&quot; fund, but &quot;little housing was built or rehabilitated&quot; according to the newspaper. City officials did dip into the fund, however, for lavish trips to New York. They stayed at the [[Ritz Carlton]] for as long as six nights at a time. They ate at the  higly expensive [[Le Bernadin]] and [[River Cafe]]. They bought tickets for themselves to [[Yankees]] and [[Mets]] games and to Broadway shows such as ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[Mamma Mia!]]'', and they made sure they had chauffeurs to take them  around town. The final bill for the five trips is estimated at $205,678.&lt;ref name=&quot;town&quot;/&gt;

==History==
The present day area encompassing Irwindale was originally part of the [[Ranchos of California|Mexican land grant]]s by [[Alta California]] Governor [[Juan Alvarado]] of [[Rancho La Puente]], [[Rancho Azusa de Dalton]], [[Rancho Azusa de Duarte]], and [[Rancho San Francisquito (Dalton)|Rancho San Francisquito]].&lt;ref&gt;Ogden Hoffman, 1862, ''Reports of Land Cases Determined in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California'', Numa Hubert, San Francisco&lt;/ref&gt; was first settled by the families of Gregorio Fraijo and Fecundo Ayon in the 1850s.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.irwindale.ca.us/history.html|title=History|work=City of Irwindale website|accessdate=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Significant economic growth did not arrive until the advent of the automobile, which drove up demand for the area's rocks and sand for the paving of roads. The city was incorporated on August 6, 1957.

Irwindale took advantage of urban redevelopment laws starting in 1976, and prospered in the following decade; it attracted a {{convert|200|acre|adj=on}} [[Miller Brewing Company]] plant, the corporate headquarters of [[H. F. Ahmanson &amp; Co.|Home Federal Savings &amp; Loan]], and other companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;rocksriches&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|work=[[New York Times]]|title=From Rocks to Riches: Tiny Suburb That Landed a Pro Team|first=Judith|last=Cummings|date=September 12, 1987|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE5DE1031F931A2575AC0A961948260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, its landscape was dominated by 19 gravel pits, which it was obligated to fill. In the summer of 1987, city councilman Joe Breceda approached [[Al Davis]], owner of the [[National Football League]]'s [[Oakland Raiders|Los Angeles Raiders]], about building a new stadium on the site of one of the disused pits.

Davis, long and vocally displeased with the Raiders' home at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]], agreed to a $115 million deal. He would take ownership of the new stadium provided the Raiders would play there for 19 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytraiders&quot;&gt;{{cite newspaper|work=[[New York Times]]|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE1D7163AF934A1575BC0A961948260|title=Talking Deals: Raiders' Town: First and Long|first=Judith|last=Cummings|date=August 27, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, the deal included a $10 million nonrefundable signing bonus paid directly to Davis regardless of whether the plan would be executed.&lt;ref name=&quot;siraiders&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|url=http://vault.sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1066472/index.htm|title=The Talk Of The Town: Meet Irwindale, Calif., home-to-be of the Raiders|first=Rick|last=Reilly|date=September 14, 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the event, both parties were served multiple lawsuits, the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] demanded strict environmental impact assessments, and the [[Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors]] demurred, and the project was canceled. Davis pocketed the $10 million, and eventually moved the Raiders back to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]].
