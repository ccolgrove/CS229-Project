The '''Canadian federal election of 1997''' was held on June 2, 1997, to elect members of the [[Canadian House of Commons]] of the [[36th Canadian Parliament|36th Parliament]] of [[Canada]]. [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Jean ChrÃ©tien]]'s [[Liberal Party of Canada]] won a second majority government. The [[Reform Party of Canada]] replaced the [[Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois]] as the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]].

The election closely reflected the pattern that had been set out in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 election]]. The Liberals swept [[Ontario]], a divided Bloc managed a reduced majority in [[Quebec]], and much of the west was won by Reform, particularly its [[Alberta]] base, enabling the Reform to overtake the Bloc as the second largest party.

The major change was that the [[New Democratic Party]] (NDP) and the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] all but wiped out the Liberals in [[Atlantic Canada]], leaving only [[Prince Edward Island]] which remained entirely Liberal. Among these defeated were two cabinet ministers; [[David Dingwall]], [[Minister of Public Works (Canada)|Minister of Public Works]] from [[Nova Scotia]], and [[Doug Young (politician)|Doug Young]], [[Minister of National Defence (Canada)|Minister of National Defence]] from [[New Brunswick]], both lost to NDP candidates in a major blow to the Liberals, as Atlantic voters were upset over cuts to [[employment insurance]] and other programs. Also unsuccessful in his bid for a seat was [[Dominic LeBlanc]], a Liberal and the son of then-Governor General [[RomÃ©o LeBlanc]].

Some commentators on election night were even predicting that the Liberals would be cut down to a [[minority government]], and/or ChrÃ©tien would lose his seat, although it was clear that none of the opposition parties could manage a plurality of seats. ChrÃ©tien did narrowly win his riding and the Liberals would manage a four-seat majority thanks to some gains in Quebec at the expense of the Bloc, although they finished considerably lower than the 1993 total due to the losses in Atlantic Canada. Mostly because of these gains in Atlantic Canada, [[Jean Charest]]'s Tories and [[Alexa McDonough]]'s NDP both regained [[official party status]] in the House of Commons. This marked the first time in Canadian history that five political parties held official party status in a single session of Parliament. The Progressive Conservative Party placed third in the popular vote, behind Liberal and Reform, but still won the fewest seats due to the first past the post system. The Reform Party gained seats in Western Canada to overtake the Bloc as the second-largest party in the House to become the Official Opposition.

Independent member [[John Nunziata]], who had been expelled from the Liberal Party for opposing the [[Goods and Services Tax (Canada)|Goods and Services Tax]], was also re-elected in his riding in [[Toronto]].

A change of 718 votes in just five ridings, BonavistaâTrinityâConception, SimcoeâGrey, HumberâSt. BarbeâBaie Verte, Cardigan, and BellechasseâEtcheminsâMontmagnyâL'Islet (286, 241, 117, 50, and 24 votes respectively), from the Liberals to the second place candidate (NDP, Ref, PC, PC, and BQ, respectively) would have resulted in a minority government.

Voter turnout was 67.0%, one of the lowest federal election turnouts ever.

==Campaign==
The election was declared on April 26, 1997, and to be held on June 2 of that year, one year and a half before the mandate of the government would expire. Prime Minister [[Jean ChrÃ©tien]] was criticized for having called an early election for political reasons, as polls at the time predicted that the Liberal Party was expected to win a landslide victory capturing at least 180 to at most 220 of the 301 seats in the House of Commons.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9704/27/canada.election/index.html | work=CNN | title=ChrÃ©tien sets Canadian election for June 2 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The right-wing conservative vote continued to be divided between the Progressive Conservative Party and the Reform Party and was expected to not be able to defeat the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt; 

When the election was called, many commentators noted that it ended the second shortest majority mandate in Canadian history; only [[Wilfrid Laurier]]'s term of office from 1908-1911 had been even more brief. ChrÃ©tien's decision to hold an early election was seen as cynical by some, as Manitoba was still recovering from the devastating [[Red River Flood, 1997|Red River Flood]] earlier in the year. [[Reg Alcock]] and several others inside the Liberal Party had opposed the timing of the vote, and the poor results prompted Paul Martin's supporters to [[2004 Liberal Party of Canada infighting#ChrÃ©tien government|organize against ChrÃ©tien]]. 

The major issue in the campaign was national unity due to a referendum on independence from Canada being held in Quebec in 1995 which was only narrowly rejected.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt;

==Political Parties==
===Liberal Party===
[[Image:Liberal Party of Canada L logo-Parti Liberal du Canada logo de L (1990s-2004).svg|thumb|220px|right|Liberal Party logo during the election.]]
The Liberal Party under [[Jean ChrÃ©tien]] campaigned on promising to continue to cut the federal deficit to allow the creation of a budget surplus and then to spend one half of the surplus on repaying Canada's national debt as well as cutting taxes while the other half of the surplus would be used to increase funding to social programs such as health care, taking action to assist Canadian children living in poverty, and to promote job creation.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). ''The Canadian General Election of 1997''. Dundurn Press Ltd, 1998. Pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The platform was called ''Securing Our Future Together''.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 45.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberal Party was attacked by the opposition parties for failing to keep many of the promises that the party campaigned on in the [[Canadian federal election, 1993|1993 federal election]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 46&quot;&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Liberals attacked the Progressive Conservatives and the Reform Party for prematurely calling for tax cuts while a deficit still remained while attacking the New Democratic Party for proposing to increase government spending while Canada faced a deficit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 46&quot;/&gt;

The Liberals suffered from a number of faulters and weaknesses in their campaign. In one incident, Jean ChrÃ©tien was questioned by reporters over the financial cost of Liberals' election proposal of a national pharmacare program in which reporters claimed that ChrÃ©tien was unsure of what the costs of such a program would be.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 46&quot;&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 46&lt;/ref&gt; ChrÃ©tien also turned down invitations for interviews by Canada's national media outlet, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] (CBC) and [[MuchMusic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 46&quot;/&gt; In the televised debates between the five major political parties, ChrÃ©tien conceded to apologize to Canadians for his government having cut funding for social programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 46&quot;/&gt;

===Reform Party===
[[File:Reform Party of Canada wave logo (english version).svg|thumbnail|450px|right|English version of the Reform Party logo during the election.]]
[[File:Parti reformiste du Canada logo de vague (version francais).svg|thumbnail|450px|right|French version of the Reform Party logo during the election.]]
The [[Reform Party of Canada|Reform Party]] under [[Preston Manning]] campaigned on preserving national unity through equal enfranchisement and decentralization of multiple federal government powers to all of the provinces, cutting taxes, reducing the size of government, reducing spending, and strongly opposing proposals for a special distinct society status for Quebec.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 46 and 118&lt;/ref&gt; Their platform was titled the ''Fresh Start for all Canadians''.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; The Reformers expanded candidates into Quebec, making this the first and last election in which the Reform Party would hold candidates in every region of Canada, as in 1993 they excluded running candidates in Quebec and in 1988 the party only represented [[Western Canada]]. The Reform Party attempted to utilize the election to finally make the party a national party by aiming to make political inroads outside of Western Canada, particularly in Canada's most highly populated province of Ontario.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 112&quot;&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Reformers faced multiple problems. The party was repeatedly accused by other parties and the media for ostensibly holding intolerant views due to comments made by a number of Reform MPs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 112&quot;/&gt; Manning's leadership abilities had been questioned by a number of former members of the Reform Party including future Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] who accused Manning of inappropriately using the party's internal finances for a lavish $31,000 [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] personal expense allowance as leader.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 112&lt;/ref&gt; Critics had accused the party's performance during the 1993-1997 parliament of being disorganized.&lt;ref name=&quot;Frizzell, Alan 1998. Pp. 46&quot;/&gt; Some Reform Party supporters were frustrated by the party's decision to expand its political base into Quebec as they continued to believe that the party should represent English Canada and others from the right-wing and populist faction of the party were angry that Manning punished MPs [[Bob Ringma]] and [[David Chatters]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; During the campaign the Reform Party released a controversial television advertisement where the faces of four Quebec politicians: Prime Minister Jean ChrÃ©tien, Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois leader Gilles Duceppe, Progressive Conservative leader Jean Charest, and the separatist Premier of Quebec [[Lucien Bouchard]] were crossed out followed by a message saying that Quebec politicians had dominated the federal government for too long and that the Reform Party would end this favoritism towards Quebec.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/9706/01/canada.elex/index.html | work=CNN | title=Canada poised for vote that may deadlock parliament | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advertisement was harshly criticized by the other party leaders including accusations that Preston Manning was &quot;intolerant&quot; and a &quot;bigot&quot; for having permitted the advertisement to be aired.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn.com&quot;/&gt; Though accused of being intolerant towards minorities by opponents, multiple visible minorities ran as Reform Party candidates and a number were elected as MPs including [[Rahim Jaffer]], who became Canada's first [[Muslim]] member of parliament; [[Gurmant Grewal]], an [[Indo-Canadian]]; and [[Inky Mark]], a [[Chinese-Canadian]].

The Reform Party began the campaign with substantial finances with $1.5 million [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] in cash reserves and by the end of the campaign had raised a total of $8 million CAD with a vast majority of the money coming from donations by individuals or small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 120.&lt;/ref&gt;

The results for the Reform Party were a minor tactical success as the party gained enough seats in Western Canada to become the Official Opposition, removing the Quebec separatist Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois from the position. The party won the second largest number of votes and won 60 seats in the House of Commons. Strategically, the Reform Party failed to make inroads into Ontario and other parts of eastern Canada and lost its one seat it previously held in Ontario, leaving the party with no seats east of the province of Manitoba, isolating the party to effectively being a western-based party, which was in part due to vote-splitting of the right-wing conservative vote in Ontario between Reformers and Progressive Conservatives.

===Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois===
[[File:Bloc Quebecois 1990s.svg|thumb|350px|right|Logo of the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois during the election.]]
The Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois lost its position of Official Opposition that it first held since 1993 and fell to the position of Third Party in the House of Commons. The party won the fifth largest number of votes of the total vote of Canada, though the party ran exclusively in Quebec. However the party remained the largest party in [[Quebec]], capturing a majority of 44 seats out of the total 75 in the province.

===New Democratic Party===
[[File:NDP NPD 1997.svg|thumb|450px|right|Logo of the New Democratic Party during the election.]]
The [[New Democratic Party]] under the leadership of [[Alexa McDonough]] regained official party status that the party lost in the 1993 Canadian federal election. The party won the fourth largest share of total votes and won 21 seats in the election with a substantial showing in Atlantic Canada as well as winning seats in almost all provinces and regions of Canada except for Alberta and Quebec.

===Progressive Conservative Party===
[[Image:Parti PC Party Canada 1996.svg|thumb|250px|right|Logo of the Progressive Conservative Party during the election.]]
The Progressive Conservative Party under [[Jean Charest]] campaigned on securing national unity in Canada by recognizing Quebec as being a distinct society within Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Frizzell, Alan (ed.); Pammett, Jon H (ed.). 1998. Pp. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; Charest and the Progressive Conservatives benefited from supporting distinct society in Quebec and resulted in the party rapidly rising in popularity amongst both francophones and non-francophones in Quebec, with polls indicating that Quebec voters preferred Charest over [[Gilles Duceppe]], the leader of the Bloc QuÃ©bÃ©cois.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, Harold D.; Kornberg, Allan;Wearing, Peter. A Polity on the Edge: Canada. Pp. 246.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Progressive Conservatives faced multiple difficulties due to the party not being able to apply for federal financial assistance due to it not being an official party as after the 1993 election, the Progressive Conservatives had collapsed from being federal government to only having two seats. Western Canadians who had voted in protest for the Reform Party in 1993 due to their dismay with the Progressive Conservatives still remained frustrated with the party and the Reformers remained the dominant conservative political force in the west. In addition, the inroads by Reformers into Ontario caused vote splitting between the Progressive Conservatives and Reformers which in Canada's plurality electoral system, allowed the Liberals with the plurality of votes in many Ontario ridings to be elected when the total combined Reform Party and Progressive Conservative Party vote in such ridings was more than the Liberal Party.

The Progressive Conservatives won the third largest number of the total votes and improved their situation in the House of Commons as they were restored as an official party after winning 20 seats. However the Progressive Conservatives were isolated as largely an eastern regional party, as won most of their seats in [[Atlantic Canada]] and [[Quebec]], while winning only one seat in both Ontario and Manitoba due to vote splitting with the Reform Party.

===Green Party===
The [[Green Party of Canada]] enjoyed a 79% increase in support from the previous election, and saw its greatest success in British Columbia where it received 2% of the vote despite not running a full slate of candidates in the province.  The Green Party remained almost entirely off the national media's radar.  At 0.43% of the vote, and 1.64% of the vote in the ridings it contested, the Green Party remained a small but growing movement.
