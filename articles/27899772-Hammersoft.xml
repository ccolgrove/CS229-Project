The '''UzunkÃ¶prÃ¼ Railway Station''' (''UzunkÃ¶prÃ¼ GarÄ±'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) is a railway station serving [[UzunkÃ¶prÃ¼]], though situated 3 kilometres north of that town. The station is used by an Ä°stanbul-UzunkÃ¶prÃ¼ service, an UzunkÃ¶prÃ¼-Alpullu service, and the [[Dostluk/Filia Express]], a daily train between [[Istanbul]] and [[Thessaloniki]].

==History==
The station was built in 1873 by the ''[[Chemins de fer Orientaux]]'' on their [[Ä°stanbul]]-[[Vienna]] main line. The world famous [[Orient Express]] stopped at the station on its journey between [[Paris]] and [[Ä°stanbul]]. A [[Turkish State Railways]] organisation was formed after [[World War I]], and in 1937 took over the ''Chemins de fer Orientaux'' as well as the station.
