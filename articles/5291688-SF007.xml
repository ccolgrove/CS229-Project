'''Executor''' is software for [[X86 architecture|x86]]-based [[personal computer|PCs]] that allows older [[68k]]-based [[Macintosh|Apple Macintosh]] programs to be run under various x86-based [[operating system]]s. Executor was created by ARDI (Abacus Research and Development, Inc.). As of [[2005]], Executor development has been indefinitely postponed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=ARDI website|url=http://www.ardi.com/ardi.php|accessdate=2009-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Unlike other true Macintosh emulators, Executor requires no startup [[Read-only memory|ROM]] images or other Apple intellectual property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Setting up Executor For Windows|url=http://emaculation.com/doku.php/executor_setup|publisher=[[E-Maculation]]|accessdate=2010-08-30 |date=January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executor, much like [[Wine (software)|Wine]] for running Windows applications on Unix-like platforms, translates [[Macintosh Toolbox]] API calls and [[QuickDraw]] routines into equivalent Win32 or [[POSIX]] API calls. The MS-DOS version of Executor runs using the [[CWSDPMI]] [[protected mode]] [[DOS extender]].

Executor translates 68k [[Endianness|big-endian]] binary code into x86 little-endian binary code.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emulate Mac OS on your Linux box&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Emulate Mac OS on your Linux box|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/05/05/emulate.mac.idg/index.html|publisher=''[[Cable News Network|CNN.com]]''|accessdate=2009-02-24 | first=Pawel | last=Leszek | date=2000-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executor can only run Macintosh programs designed to run on [[Motorola 68000|68000]]-based Macintosh hardware. Executor can mimic either Macintosh [[System 7 (Macintosh)|System 7.0.0]] or [[System 6|System 6.0.7]] for older applications that do not work in System 7.0.0 mode. With a 486DX4 75MHz processor, performance was roughly comparable to a [[Quadra 610]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.ardi.com/MacHack_96.html|title=Executor Internals: How to Efficiently Run Mac Programs on PCs|authors=Mathew J. Hostetter, Clifford T. Matthews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the [[graphical user interface|GUI]]-oriented nature of classic Mac OS applications, Executor has its own GUI environment known as Browser. Browser attempts to somewhat mimic the classic Mac OS desktop and the [[Macintosh Finder|Finder]] application without having features such as the trash can or Mac OS control panels.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emulate Mac OS on your Linux box&quot;/&gt; The default Apple menu also does not exist in Browser but is replaced with a rough-equivalent; running Mac applications will have Apple menu functions available. Executor does not have support for [[computer networking|networking]] of any type, including [[AppleTalk]] support. Executor also lacks the ability to run components (such as extensions or control panels) that are highly integrated with classic Mac OS versions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Emulate Mac OS on your Linux box&quot;/&gt; Due to the differences between the actual MacOS ROM and the emulation provided by Executor, other compatibility issues may exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Open source ROM replacement? in Mini vMac FAQ|url=http://minivmac.sourceforge.net/faq.html|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Heinz Heise|heise Magazine]] reports issues with installation of many programs, and running early versions of [[StarWriter]] and [[Adobe PageMill]]. However, once installed, [[Microsoft Word]] and [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]], and [[BBEdit|BBEdit Lite]] are usable.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Executor - using Mac applications under Linux (The Executor)|publisher=[[Heinz Heise|heise Magazine]]|url=http://www.heise.de/ix/artikel/The-Executor-505290.html|first=Stefan|last=KÃ¼hnel|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Executor can run on x86-based PCs running [[Microsoft Windows]] and various specific [[Linux]] distributions. All versions of Executor require a minimum configuration of a 90&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Pentium compatible processor|Pentium]] processor, 32 MB of RAM with 4 MB available to Executor, and a minimum of 8 MB of hard drive space for installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=ARDI website - Executor For Windows Overview (Internet Archive)|url=http://www.ardi.com/exe_win.php |accessdate=2009-02-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927051523/http://www.ardi.com/exe_win.php |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the [[Unofficial Macintosh Emulation Pages]] reports successfully running Executor with 24MB of RAM under Windows 95.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Executor/DOS under Win32|publisher=[[Unofficial Macintosh Emulation Pages]]|url=http://www.reocities.com/SiliconValley/Lakes/9359/w95.htm|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Linux version of Executor has been tested under [[Red Hat Linux]] 5 through 7, [[SuSE]] 6, [[Caldera OpenLinux]] 2, [[Debian]] 2.1, and [[Yellow Dog Linux]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=ARDI website - Executor For Linux Overview (Internet Archive)|url=http://www.ardi.com/exe_lin.php |accessdate=2009-02-24 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927051555/http://www.ardi.com/exe_lin.php |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Older versions of Executor also run under [[MS-DOS]] and [[NeXTSTEP]].

==Current status==
Currently, Executor isn't being supported or developed. Clifford Matthews, ARDI's Founder, released serial codes that worked until December 31, 2006, and again until the end of June 2007. On July 23, 2007, a new working serial code with no expiration date was released,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardi.com/ardi.php|title=ARDI,an Emulation and Reverse-Engineering Company|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the status of Executor remains unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ardi.com/ardi.php|title=ARDI website|accessdate=2007-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After considering an [[open source]] release of the [[source code]] for some time, Matthews released the source code for [http://github.com/ctm/executor/tree/master executor] and [http://github.com/ctm/syn68k/tree/master syn68k] on October 5, 2008 under a very permissive MIT-style license.
