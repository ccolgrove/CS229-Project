'''RTM2''', also known as ''TV2'' is a [[television station]] in [[Malaysia]] owned and operated by the [[Radio Television Malaysia]], a division of the Malaysian Government. RTM2 is now broadcasting for 24 hours a day effective January 2006.

== History ==
The broadcasting of RTM TV2 began on 17 November 1969 when ''Televisyen Malaysia'' (currently known as [[TV1 (Malaysia)|RTM TV1]] split into two channels. It offers local and international [[entertainment]] [[Television program|programs]], [[film]]s and [[drama]]s. Some elements such as [[sex]] and [[violence]] are censored as RTM is one of the government departments.

RTM2 is also available over the [[Astro (satellite TV)|Astro]] [[direct broadcast satellite]] platform on channel 102 (formerly on channel 6, then channel 2).

On 1 January 2006, this channel began to broadcast in 24 hours daily, offering more programmes for viewers who stay up late to watch television.

On 1 January 2007, RTM television stations were once again restructured by [[Ahmad Shabery Cheek|Dato' Ahmad Shabery Cheek]] the then [[Cabinet of Malaysia|Information Minister]]. RTM2 got a new slogan: ''Your Family Channel''.

[[TV Pendidikan]] programmes were aired through this channel from 1972 to 1999, alternate with RTM1 in the afternoon until 1994 where it airs in the morning. Daytime programming on RTM1 started in 1 March 1994 has caused TV Pendidikan to be broadcast only on RTM2.

RTM1, RTM2 and the radio stations under [[Radio Televisyen Malaysia]] broadcasts from their headquarters in [[Angkasapuri]], [[Kuala Lumpur]].

RTM2 currently broadcasts under ([[VHF|Very High Frequency]]) band III, although some parts of [[Malaysia]] it transmits the signal in [[UHF]] where it is normally tuned to band 2. In the [[Klang Valley]] the VHF channel for RTM2 is 8, with a weaker transmission on channel 10 in certain parts of the [[Klang Valley]]. It is also available over the [[RTMi]] test DVB-T transmission over 658&amp;nbsp;MHz, SID 2. As of 1 January 2007, it is also available over a test DMB-T/H transmission on Band III.

==Criticism==
In 2007, this channel has been criticised for not airing most of the F1 events (only 7 out of the 17 races live, the rest are ''delayed telecast''). Many viewers are upset that RTM is not serious about the coverage and this telecast rights should be given back to private TV stations.
