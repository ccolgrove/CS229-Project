Because the [[2010 Four Continents Figure Skating Championships]] were held so close to the U.S. Championships, U.S. Figure Skating had submitted possible entries in advance. Dobbs was on the alternate list for Four Continents and was assigned to the event following the 2010 U.S. Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=44109&amp;type=media | title = U.S. Figure Skating Announces Ladies, Ice Dancing Teams Nominated to 2010 U.S. Olympic Figure Skating Team | date = January 23, 2010 | accessdate = January 27, 2010 | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dobbs &amp; Jacobsen were not listed as alternates and so could not have been sent; but were the fourth alternates for the [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=44090&amp;type=media | title = U.S. Figure Skating Announces Pairs Teams Nominated to 2010 U.S. Olympic Figure Skating Team | date = January 16, 2010 | accessdate = January 27, 2010 | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
