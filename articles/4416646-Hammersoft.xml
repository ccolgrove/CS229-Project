'''Donald D. &quot;Don&quot; Lapre''' (May 19, 1964 â October 2, 2011)&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide&quot;&gt;[http://www.myfoxphoenix.com/dpp/news/justice/incarcerated-tv-pitchman-don-lapre-death-10-2-2011 KSAZ: &quot;Incarcerated TV Pitchman Don Lapre Found Dead&quot;, October 3, 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt; was an American TV [[pitchman]]. He became a [[multi-level marketing]] and [[infomercial]] salesman. His work involved product packages such as &quot;The Greatest Vitamin in the World&quot; and &quot;Making Money Secrets&quot;. 

Lapre was criticized as selling questionable business plans that often did not work for his clients. In June 2011, Lapre was charged with 41 counts of conspiracy, [[mail fraud]], [[wire fraud]], and promotional [[money laundering]] related to his Internet businesses. He was arrested on June 24, 2011, for failing to appear in court to face these charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5itB9WHOh4bkgXfEJh0Z3T2KIPpFw?docId=2f42773b2eca4709a3f9b424845bca55|title=TV pitchman arrested after missing appearance|agency=Associated Press|date=June 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 2, 2011, Lapre died of an apparent [[suicide]] while awaiting trial in federal custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide&quot;/&gt;

==Business ventures==
A high-school dropout,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2000-01-13/feature.html/page2.html|author=Leigh Farr|title=Don Wan|accessdate=2007-03-12|work=[[Phoenix New Times]]|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20000824160429/http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/issues/2000-01-13/feature.html/page2.html|archivedate=2000-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1990 Lapre and his wife started a [[credit repair]] business called Unknown Concepts. Lapre then began selling a 36-page booklet explaining how to recover a [[Federal Housing Administration]] insurance refund after paying off a home mortgage. He also began offering [[Premium-rate telephone number|&quot;900&quot; phone lines]]. On TV infomercials in the early&amp;ndash;mid 1990s, he claimed that by placing &quot;tiny classified ads&quot; in newspapers he was &quot;able to make $50,000 a week from [his] tiny one-bedroom apartment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mubCkCAEiDQ&amp;feature Don Lapre Sells Tiny Classified Ads]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Lapre began broadcasting ''The Making Money Show with Don Lapre'', which suggested that viewers could make money as easily as he had. For several years the show was ranked among the ten most frequently broadcast cable television infomercials. The principal product was Lapre's &quot;Money Making Secrets&quot;, a package of booklets, tapes, and common-sense tips for placing ads and operating a 900-number business. The product was sold through &quot;New Strategies&quot;, whose parent company was Tropical Beaches.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In 2005, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) warned Lapre about claims his vitamins were intended as a drug for diseases such as diabetes, stroke, heart disease, insomnia, cancer, and arthritis. The [http://www.fda.gov/Cder/warn/cyber/2006/Cyber.pdf FDA] stated &quot;Your products are not [[generally recognized as safe and effective]] for the above referenced conditions.&quot; In 2006 the [http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/cyber/2005/CL169e.pdf FDA] again warned Lapre about untruthful claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/cder/warn/cyber/2005/CL169e.pdf FDA warns Lapre again about claims]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Consumer [[wikt:watchdog|watchdog]] organizations such as [[Quackwatch]] had accused Lapre of peddling [[get-rich-quick scheme]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/lapre.html|author=[[Stephen Barrett]], MD and Quill, Timothy, MD|title=Be Wary of Don Lapre, Doug Grant, and &quot;The Greatest Vitamin in the World&quot;|accessdate=2007-02-11|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Charges===
According to a June 15, 2011 Associated Press article, Lapre was indicted by a federal grand jury in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], on June 8, 2011, on accusations of running a nationwide scheme to sell worthless Internet businesses. Federal prosecutors accused Lapre of bilking more than 220,000 victims out of nearly $52 million. He was charged with 41 counts of conspiracy, mail fraud, wire fraud, promotional money laundering, and transactional money laundering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jun. 15, 2011 10:59 AM Associated Press |url=http://www.azcentral.com/community/phoenix/articles/2011/06/15/20110615phoenix-pitchman-arrest-web-scheme.html |title=Phoenix-based TV pitchman Donald Lapre accused of bilking 220,000 out of $52M |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.casewatch.org/doj/lapre/indictment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnbc.com/id/43413517 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A federal judge issued a bench warrant for Lapre on June 22, 2011, after he failed to appear at his arraignment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.duluthnewstribune.com/event/article/id/202535/group/homepage ''Duluth News Tribune'' report on Lapre's bench warrant]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/06/23/3722483/tv-pitchman-no-show-at-federal.html &quot;Lapre 'no-show' at arraignment&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 27, 2011, Lapre was arrested in [[Tempe, Arizona]] at a [[Life Time Fitness]] center, where he had reportedly lived for two days, with serious self-inflicted knife wounds to his groin.  The wounds led authorities to believe Lapre had attempted suicide while at the Lifetime Fitness by attempting to sever the [[femoral artery]] in his legs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc15.com/dpp/news/region_southeast_valley/tempe/u.s.-marshals%3A-phoenix-pitchman-found-with-deep-wounds-near-tempe-lifetime-fitness-where-he-hid-out Lapre attempts suicide in Tempe]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
Lapre died in custody from an apparent suicide on October 2, 2011, while in jail awaiting his trial, which was scheduled to begin on October 4, 2011. Lapre died from severe blood loss after cutting his throat with a razor blade.&lt;ref name=&quot;suicide&quot;/&gt; The autopsy report said that Mr. Lapre died of massive blood loss due to the fact that he had wrapped himself in sheets to conceal any blood loss from prison officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sflchronicle.com/news/2011/10/update-king-of-infomercials-don-lapre-used-a-razor-blade-to-kill-himself/ |title=King Of Infomercials Don Lapre Used A Razor Blade To Kill Himself &amp;#124; South Florida Chronicle |publisher=Sflchronicle.com |date=2011-10-05 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
