The '''2010 statewide legislative elections''' were held on November 2, 2010, halfway through [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s first term in office. Elections were held for 88 legislative chambers, with all states but [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[New Jersey]] and [[Virginia]] holding elections in at least one house. [[Kansas]], [[New Mexico]] and [[South Carolina]] held elections for their lower, but not upper houses.

[[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] scored record gains, gaining at least 680 total seats and taking control of 19 legislative chambers, while the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] lost at least 21 chambers.&lt;ref&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2010/nov/03/news/la-pn-state-legislatures-20101104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/13/AR2010111304276.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The winners of this election cycle will serve in their respective legislatures for either a 2 or 4 year term, depending on state election rules.
