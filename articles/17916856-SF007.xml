'''Mozilla Firefox 3.0''' is a version of the [[Firefox]] [[web browser]] released on June 17, 2008 by the [[Mozilla Corporation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;developer1&quot;/&gt;

Firefox 3.0 uses version 1.9 of the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] layout engine for displaying web pages. This version fixes many bugs, improves standard compliance, and implements many new web APIs compared to [[Firefox 2|Firefox 2.0]]. Other new features include a redesigned download manager, a new &quot;Places&quot; system for storing bookmarks and history, and separate [[theme (computing)|themes]] for different operating systems.

Firefox 3.0 had over 8 million unique downloads the day it was released, and by July 2008 held over 5.6% of the recorded [[usage share of web browsers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=2|title=Market share for browsers, operating systems and search engines|accessdate=2008-08-16|publisher=Net Applications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current estimates of Firefox 3.0's global market share {{as of|2010|02|lc=on}} are generally in the range of 4-5%,&lt;ref name=&quot;Net Applications&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and dropping as users migrate to [[Firefox 3.5]] and more recently [[Firefox 3.6]].
Partially as a result of this, between mid-December 2009 and the end of January 2010, Firefox 3.5 was the most popular browser (when counting individual browser versions) passing [[Internet Explorer 7]].&lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://blog.seattlepi.com/microsoft/archives/188906.asp?from=blog_last3 Firefox 3.5 is world's most popular browser, StatCounter says], Nick Eaton. seattlepi blogs. 2009-12-21. Retrieved 2009-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mozilla ended support for Firefox 3 on March 30, 2010 with the release of 3.0.19.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/WeeklyUpdates/2010-03-01#Video_for_today.27s_meeting Mozilla.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
{{See also|History of Firefox}}
Firefox 3.0 was developed under the codename ''[[Gran Paradiso]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.planning/browse_thread/thread/c73f6a1c25e8e7b0/b714ca46975f0109#b714ca46975f0109 |title=Gecko 1.9/Firefox 3 (&quot;Gran Paradiso&quot;) Planning Meeting, Wednesday Jun 7, 11:00 am |publisher=Groups.google.com |date=2006-06-02 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This, like other Firefox codenames, is the name of an actual place; in this case the seventh-highest mountain in the [[Graian Alps]].

Planning began in October 2006, when the development team asked users to submit feature requests that they wished to be included in Firefox 3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061013-7986.html |title=Firefox accepting feature suggestions for version 3 |date= 2006-10-13 |accessdate=2007-02-05 |last=Reimer |first=Jeremy |publisher=Arstechnica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mozilla Foundation released the first beta on November 19, 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;avail&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2007/11/19/firefox-3-beta-1-now-available-for-download/ |author=Mike Beltzner |publisher=Mozilla Developer News |title=Firefox 3 Beta 1 now available for download}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second beta on December 18, 2007,&lt;ref name=&quot;avail&quot;/&gt; the third beta on February 12, 2008, the fourth beta on March 10, 2008, and the fifth and final beta on April 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2064 |title=Firefox 3 beta 4 code freeze tonight, beta 5 release looks likely |first=Paula |last=Rooney |publisher=[[ZDNet]] |date=2008-02-26 |accessdate=2008-02-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[release candidate]] was announced on May 16, 2008, followed by a second release candidate on June 4, 2008, and a third (differing from the second release candidate only in that it corrected a serious bug for Mac users) on June 11, 2008. Mozilla shipped the final release on June 17, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;developer1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://developer.mozilla.org/devnews/index.php/2008/06/11/coming-tuesday-june-17th-firefox-3/|title= Coming Tuesday, June 17th: Firefox 3|publisher=Mozilla Developer News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Anick Jesdanun | coauthors=Associated Press | title=New Firefox Web browser to be released Tuesday | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/25125727/ | date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2010-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On its release date, Firefox 3 was featured in popular culture, mentioned on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'', among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.comedycentral.com/colbertreport/full-episodes/index.jhtml?episodeId=173608 | title = Colbert Report episode June 17, 17th minute. | accessdate =  2008-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Changes and features ==
=== Backend changes ===
One of the big changes in Firefox 3 is the implementation of [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 1.9, an updated [[layout engine]]. The new version fixes many bugs, improves standard compliance, and implements new web [[Application programming interface|APIs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mdc_fx3_developers&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Firefox_3_for_developers | title = Firefox 3 for developers | accessdate = 2007-07-17 |date=2007-07-17 | publisher = Mozilla Developer Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, it makes Firefox 3 the first official release of a Mozilla browser to pass the [[Acid2]] test, a standards-compliance test for web-page rendering. It also gets a better score on the [[Acid3]] test than Firefox 2.

Some of the new features are defined in the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group|WHATWG]] [[HTML 5]] specification,&lt;ref name=&quot;mdc_fx3_developers&quot;/&gt; such as support for web-based protocol handlers, a native implementation of the &lt;code&gt;getElementsByClassName&lt;/code&gt; method, support for safe message-passing with &lt;code&gt;postMessage&lt;/code&gt;, and support for offline web applications. Other new features include [[Animated PNG|APNG]] support, and [[EXSLT]] support.&lt;ref name=&quot;mdc_fx3_developers&quot;/&gt;

A new internal [[malloc|memory allocator]], [[Malloc#FreeBSD's jemalloc|jemalloc]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A Scalable Concurrent malloc(3) Implementation for FreeBSD |first=Jason |last=Evans |url=http://people.freebsd.org/~jasone/jemalloc/bsdcan2006/jemalloc.pdf |format=PDF |date= 2006-04-16 |accessdate=2008-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; is used rather than the default [[libc]] one.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

Gecko 1.9 uses [[Cairo (graphics)|Cairo]] as a graphics backend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Mozilla Cairo Vector Graphics | url=http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6498 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060219212346/http://www.mozillazine.org/talkback.html?article=6498 | archivedate=2006-02-19 | accessdate = 2007-01-24 |date=2005-04-24 | publisher=mozillaZine}} A page describing the future usage of Cairo.&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for improved graphics performance and better consistency of look and feel on various operating systems. Because of Cairo's lack of support for [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]], [[Windows Me]] and [[Windows NT]] (versions [[Windows NT 4.0|4.0]] and below), and because [[Microsoft]] ended support for Windows 98 and Windows Me on July 11, 2006, Firefox 3 does not run on those operating systems. Similarly, the Mac version of Firefox 3 runs only on [[Mac OS X]] 10.4 or higher,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mozilla.org/projects/granparadiso/system-requirements.html | title=Gran Paradiso - System Requirements | accessdate=2007-09-11 | publisher = mozilla.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; but, unlike previous versions, has a native [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]] [[Widget (computing)|widget]] interface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reviews.zdnet.co.uk/software/productivity/0,1000001108,39285100,00.htm | title=Firefox 3 (Gran Paradiso) Alpha 1 | accessdate=2007-02-05 |date=2006-12-12 | author = [[CNET]] staff | publisher = [[ZDNet]].co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Frontend changes ===
[[File:Firefox 3.x download manager.png|thumb|right|New Firefox 3 Download Manager in [[Ubuntu Studio]].]]
As for the [[front-end and back-end|frontend]] changes, Firefox features a redesigned download manager with built-in search and the ability to resume downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/3.0b1/releasenotes/ | title=Firefox 3 Beta 1 Release Notes |date=2007-11-19 | accessdate=2007-12-05 | publisher=mozilla.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a new plug-in manager is included in the add-ons window&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/08/first-look-to-firefox-3s-new-download-manager/ | title=First look to Firefox 3âs new download manager | date=2007-08-11 | accessdate=2007-08-12 | last = Cabello | first = Percy | publisher = mozillalinks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extensions can be installed with a [[package manager]]. [[Microformat]]s are supported for use by software that can understand their use in documents to store data in a machine-readable form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Microformats | title=Microformats (Mozilla Wiki) | date=2007-05-24 | accessdate=2007-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Firefox 3 Location Bar.png|thumb|300px|right|New location bar auto-complete feature in Firefox 3.]]
The password manager in Firefox 3 asks the user if they would like it to remember the password after the [[log on]] attempt rather than before. By doing this users are able to avoid storing an incorrect password in the password manager after a bad log on attempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mozillalinks.org/wp/2007/09/firefoxs-password-manager-gets-smarter/ | title=Firefoxâs password manager gets smarter | date=2007-09-01 | accessdate=2007-09-07 | last = Cabello | first = Percy | publisher = mozillalinks.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefox 3 uses a &quot;Places&quot; system for storing bookmarks and history in an [[SQLite]] backend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/index.php?title=Places&amp;oldid=46000 | title=Places | date=2006-10-16 | accessdate=2007-02-05 | author = Mozilla Wiki contributors | publisher = Mozilla Wiki}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new system stores more information about user's history and bookmarks, in particular letting the user [[Tag (metadata)|tag]] the pages. It is also used to implement an improved algorithm for the new location bar auto-complete feature (dubbed the &quot;Awesomebar&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.org/projects/firefox/3.0a8/releasenotes/ |title=3.0a8 release notes |publisher=Mozilla.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Places:Fx3UIPlan Places:Fx3UIPlan - MozillaWiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mac version of Firefox 3 supports [[Growl (software)|Growl]] notifications, the Mac OS X spell checker, and [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua]]-style form controls.

=== Themes ===
To give the browser a more native look and feel on different operating systems, Firefox 3 uses separate themes for Mac OS X, Linux, Windows XP, and Windows Vista. When running on [[GNOME]], Firefox 3 displays icons from the environment; thus, when the desktop environment icon theme changes, Firefox follows suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A first look at the Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/11/15/afirst-look-at-the-firefox-3-visual-refresh-for-linux | date=2007-11-15 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | author = Ryan Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional icons were also made to be used when no appropriate icon exists; these were made following the [[Tango Desktop Project]] guidelines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = A first look at the Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2007/11/13/update-on-the-firefox-3-linux-theme/ | date=2007-11-13 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | author = Alex Faaborg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the GTK version has replaced the non-native tab bar that was implemented in Firefox 2.0 and instead uses the native GTK+ tab style.

The default icons and icon layout for Firefox 3 also changed dramatically, taking on a keyhole shape for the forward and back buttons by default on two of the three platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2008/01/22/navigation-toolbar-on-windows/ | title=Keyhole Shape | date=2007-01-23 | accessdate=2007-01-23 | author = Alex Faaborg | publisher = Alex Faaborg}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the keyhole shape does not take effect in Linux or in the small-icon mode. [[The Iconfactory]] created the icons for the Microsoft Windows platform. In addition, separate icons sets are displayed for Windows XP and Vista.

=== Breakpad ===
[[File:Google Breakpad Mozilla Firefox Crash Reporter Minefield 3.0pre 2008041704 en-US Xfce4.png|thumb|Mozilla Crash Reporter on [[Debian]] with [[Xfce4]]]]

[http://code.google.com/p/google-breakpad/ Breakpad] (previously called &quot;Airbag&quot;) is an open-source [[crash reporter]] utility which replaced the proprietary Talkback. It is being developed by [[Google]] and Mozilla, and used in Firefox and Thunderbird.&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2006-09-12/deploying-the-airbag/ Deploying the Airbag]. ''BSBlog'' (Mozilla developer Benjamin Smedberg's weblog).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://benjamin.smedbergs.us/blog/2007-03-29/using-breakpad-with-19a3/ Using Breakpad with Gran Paradiso (1.9a3)]. ''BSBlog'' (Mozilla developer Benjamin Smedberg's weblog).&lt;/ref&gt; This product is significant because it is the first open source multi-platform crash reporting system.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

During development Breakpad was first included May 27, 2007, in Firefox 3 trunk builds on Windows NT and Mac OS X, and, weeks later, on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=381099 Bug 381099 â Turn on crash reporting by default (Win+Mac)], mozilla.org bug tracker]&lt;/ref&gt; Breakpad replaced Talkback (also known as the Quality Feedback Agent) as the crash reporter used by the [[Mozilla]] software to report crashes of its products to a centralized [[Server (computing)|server]] for aggregation or case-by-case analysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkback-public.mozilla.org|title=Mozilla Talkback server|accessdate=2006-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talkback was [[proprietary software]] licensed to the Mozilla Corporation by [[SupportSoft]].

== Usage ==
{{Firefox usage share}}
Net Applications noted that the use of Firefox 3 beta rapidly increased to a usage share of 0.62% in May 2008. They interpreted this increase to mean that Firefox 3 betas were stable and that users were using it as their primary browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=3&amp;qpcustom=Firefox+3.0&amp;sample=11 | title = Firefox 3.0 BETA Gaining Market Share | publisher = Net Applications | accessdate = 2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 24 hours after the release of Firefox 3.0, usage rose from under 1% to over 3% according to Net Applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/report.aspx?qprid=31 | title=Firefox 3.0 Usage Share (EDT) | publisher=Net Applications | date=2008-06-19 | accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; It reached a peak of 21.17% in April 2009 before declining as users switched to [[Firefox 3.5]] and later [[Firefox 3.6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://marketshare.hitslink.com/browser-market-share.aspx?qprid=3&amp;qpcal=1&amp;qptimeframe=M&amp;qpsp=123 |title=Hitslink.com |publisher=Marketshare.hitslink.com |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Guinness World Record ===
[[File:Firefox 3 Downloads.svg|250px|thumb|right|World map of all downloads of Mozilla Firefox 3 from June 17, 2008 to July 2, 2008]]
{{Wikinews|Mozilla sets record for most software downloads in 24 hours}}
The official date for the launch of Firefox 3 was June 17, 2008, named &quot;Download Day 2008&quot;. Firefox was aiming to set the record for most software downloads in 24 hours.

Download Day officially started at 11:16 a.m. [[Pacific Time Zone|PDT]] (18:16 UTC) on June 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spreadfirefox.com/node/2438 |title=The Official Download Day Time at www.spreadfirefox.com |publisher=Spreadfirefox.com |date=2008-06-17 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the announced date, the download day was June 18 for timezones greater than GMT +6, which includes half of [[Asia]] and all of [[Oceania]].

The large number of users attempting to access the Mozilla website on June 17 caused it to become unavailable for at least a few hours and attempts at upgrading to the new version resulted in server timeouts. The site was not updated for the download of Firefox 3 until 12:00 PDT (19:00 UTC), two hours later than originally scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/06/17/firefox_3_debuts/|title=Firefox 3 Download Day falls flat on face|publisher=The Register|author=Kelly Fiveash|date=2008-06-17|accessdate=2008-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Melissa |url=http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2008/06/17/firefox-3-coming-soon/ |title=The Mozilla Blog - Firefox 3 coming soon! |publisher=Blog.mozilla.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gareth Deaves, Records Manager for Guinness World Records, complimented Mozilla, saying, &quot;Mobilizing over 8 million internet users within 24 hours is an extremely impressive accomplishment and we would like to congratulate the Mozilla community for their hard work and dedication.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/press/mozilla-2008-07-02.html|title=Mozilla Sets New Guinness World Record with Firefox 3 Downloads|publisher=[[Mozilla]]|author=Naventi, Steve|date=2008-07-02|accessdate=2008-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operating System support===
