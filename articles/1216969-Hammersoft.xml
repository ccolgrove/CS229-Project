'''Lyveden New Bield''' (sometimes called New Build) is an unfinished summer house in the parish of [[Aldwinkle St Peter]] in the county of [[Northamptonshire]], [[England]].

==Construction==
It was constructed for Sir [[Thomas Tresham II|Thomas Tresham]], the fervent [[Roman Catholic]] of [[Rushton Hall]], and is thought to have been designed by Robert Stickells. The exact date is unknown but can be estimated to circa 1604&amp;ndash;05, the year of Tresham's death. The New Bield was on the estate of Tresham's second home Lyvedon Old Bield. 

Just as at Tresham's smaller [[folly]] [[Rushton Triangular Lodge]], his principal estate, the New Bield has a religious design full of symbolism. Designed on a plan reminiscent of a [[Greek cross]], the [[facade]]s have a strict symmetry. The building has two floors above a raised [[basement]], with [[mullion]]ed and [[Transom (architectural)|transomed]] windows. Each floor had three rooms with a staircase in the south projection of the cross. The exterior of the building is decorated by [[friezes]] of a religious nature. The [[metope (architecture)|metopes]] contain the emblems and [[motif (art)|motifs]] found also at the triangular lodge, such as the &quot;IHS&quot; [[christogram]].

==Purpose==
The house was obviously meant for occupation as not only does it have a [[great hall]] and [[parlour]] on the first floor and kitchen and buttery in the basement, but also a bedroom on the upper floor. The building was probably never intended for full time occupation. Too close to the main house for use as a hunting lodge, it may have been intended for use as a &quot;Secret House&quot;&amp;mdash;keeping a secret house was a custom of the 16th century. Often within a mile of the main house, the secret house was a place where the head of the household would retire for a few days with a minimum of servants, while the principal house was thoroughly cleaned, and bearing in mind the sanitation of the time, fumigated. Similar examples of &quot;secret houses&quot; exist at [[Leconfield]] and [[Warkworth, Northamptonshire|Warkworth]] where their use for this purpose has been well documented.

==Lyveden Old Bield==
Lyveden Old Bield, the once grand principal house of the [[Estate (house)|estate]], had belonged to the Tresham family from c.1450. Today, little remains and what does was probably built by Thomas Tresham's grandson Lewis. The gatehouse has been removed to [[Fermyn Woods Hall]], and the staircase has been transported to [[United States|America]]. One wing remains with mullioned windows.

==The Tresham Family and The Gunpowder Plot==
Sir Thomas Tresham died in 1605 following decades of religious persecution, his once vast wealth having been severely depleted. His son [[Francis Tresham]] inherited the estate, but within the same year, along with his cousins Catesby and Wintour, became involved in the [[Gunpowder Plot]]. Thus, within a year the estate had a third owner, Francis's son [[Lewis Tresham]]. The estate was managed by Lewis's mother until her death in 1615.

After this Lewis Tresham, a spendthrift, lost the remaining family wealth. The estate was eventually sold following the death of his son in 1643.

==National Trust==
Lyveden New Bield was never completed or used. It remains exactly as it was when the builders left following Sir Thomas Tresham's death. Evidence of the planned [[terrace (gardening)|terraces]] and water garden remain. Today, it is in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]]. 

In 2010, National Trust experts studying photographs taken by the [[Luftwaffe]] during the [[Second World War]] discovered the remains of an Elizabethan fruit garden in the grounds of Lyveden New Bield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tel2010&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Louise |last=Gray |title=Photos taken by the enemy in Second World War shows lost Tudor garden |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/8112577/Photos-taken-by-the-enemy-in-Second-World-War-shows-lost-Tudor-garden.html |newspaper=Telegraph |date=2010-11-06 |accessdate=2010-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gardens were subsequently upgraded to a Grade I listing by [[English Heritage]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Tel2010&quot; /&gt;
