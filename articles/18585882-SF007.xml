'''''The Dark Knight''''' is a cancelled [[Action game|action]] [[video game]] loosely based on the [[The Dark Knight (film)|film of the same name]]. The game was unofficially announced in the summer of 2007 to be developed by [[Pandemic Studios]] as an [[open world]] [[Batman]] game.

The game was confirmed, albeit unofficially, on July 17, 2008 by actor [[Gary Oldman]] during an interview with [[G4 (TV channel)|G4]]'s [[Kristin Adams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;g4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.g4tv.com/thefeed/blog/post/687343/Dark_Knight_Game_Leaks.html|title=G4 confirms Dark Knight Game}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his interview on [[Gametrailers]], Oldman said he knew an awful lot of effort had gone into getting Batman's gliding abilities to feel suitably smooth and fluid for the ''Dark Knight'' game. Oldman, who reprised his role as [[James Gordon (comics)|Lt. Jim Gordon]], did not name a developer in the interview but anonymous sources reported that ''The Dark Knight'' was a secret project of Pandemic Studios and EA.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsweek&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Derrick J.|last=Lang|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/151202|title='Dark Knight' reigns not in video game|accessdate=2008-08-22|date=2008-08-07|publisher=[[Newsweek]]|work=[[Associated Press|AP]]}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps3.ign.com/articles/789/789648p1.html|title=Rumor: Pandemic to Develop New Batman Game|author=Matt Casamassina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite prior speculation,&lt;ref name=&quot;g4&quot;/&gt; no further announcements were made regarding production of the game, even upon the [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] release of the films on December 9, 2008 in the United States. According to a ''[[Newsweek]]'' article, the lack of a game at the same time of the movie's release may have cost an estimated $101 million in missed revenue. EA and Pandemic Studios had announced that the game would come out on [[PlayStation 3]] console.&lt;ref&gt;http://australiangamer.com/news/1224_why_so_serious_pandemic.html&lt;/ref&gt; Pandemic Brisbane, who were responsible for developing this game, has since been shut down and the project cancelled.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdkcanned-kotaku&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/88736-Screwing-Up-Batman|title=Screwing Up Batman|author=Andy Chalk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
