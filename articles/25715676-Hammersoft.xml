Gormley learned to play the guitar as a teenager and later wrote a number of original compositions in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;G4TV&quot; /&gt; His musical influences include [[Led Zeppelin]], [[Bob Dylan]], [[Rush (band)|Rush]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[James Taylor]] and [[Boston (band)|Boston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum&quot; /&gt; During his time enlisted in the [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]], Gormley was stationed in Scotland where he recorded a demo for his songs, but he was unable to gain a recording contract on his return to the USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;G4TV&quot; /&gt; In 1986, Gormley entered the music studio once again to record two new songs.&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum&quot; /&gt;

==''The Uncharted Zone''==
Having decided to give up pursuing a career as a musician, Gormley didn't release his music to the public until his first music video was filmed in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogum.com/archives/music-related-content/this-is-your-dads-music-video_045241.html|title=This Is Your Dad's Music Video|date=January 13, 2009|publisher=''[[Stereogum|Videogum]]''|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gormley was given a platform when his music videos appeared on ''The Uncharted Zone'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Coilhouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coilhouse.net/2009/01/mark-gormley-is-love/#more-5460|title=Mark Gormley is Love|last=Yayanos|first=Meredith|date=January 16, 2009|publisher=''Coilhouse Magazine''|accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; a weekly [[public-access television]] music show that plays original and cover videos by local artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infocus&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infocus-magazine.com/article/PensacolaConnection/108/|title=Pensacola Connection|last=Manning|first=Ken|date=June 30, 2010|publisher=''Infocus Magazine''|accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Uncharted Zone'' is shown on the [[Blab Television]] cable station&lt;ref name=&quot;Infocus&quot; /&gt; and is based in the Gulf Coast of [[Florida]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Vice&quot; /&gt; Gormley has since recorded a number of music videos for the show.

The low-budget music videos are produced by Phil Thomas Katt,&lt;ref name=&quot;Infocus&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro&quot; /&gt; a local musician&lt;ref name=&quot;Infocus&quot; /&gt; and former radio DJ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vice&quot; /&gt; The videos are characterised by their frequent use of [[Chroma key|green screen]] effects, local scenery and, quite often, comedic or dramatic story lines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theridiculant.metro.co.uk/2009/01/the-wonderful-world-of-mark-gormley.html|title=The Wonderful World of Mark Gormley|publisher=''[[Metro (Associated Metro Limited)|Metro]]''|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNJ&quot; /&gt; Katt runs ''The Uncharted Zone'' with his co-host and longtime friend Tommy Robinetti.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vice&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viceland.com/wp/2009/01/the-uncharted-zone-with-phil-thomas-katt/|title=The Uncharted Zone with Phil Thomas Katt|last=Herrman|first=John|date=January 29, 2009|publisher=''[[Vice (magazine)|Vice]]''|accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PNJ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/pnj/access/2061749651.html?FMT=ABS&amp;date=Jun+19%2C+2010|title=Pensacola's music man: Phil Thomas Katt|last=Ross|first=Rebecca|date=June 19, 2010|publisher=''[[Pensacola News Journal]]''|accessdate=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two can be found introducing each video with quirky commentary and anecdotes about each featured artist.&lt;ref name=&quot;Infocus&quot; /&gt;

In addition to the television broadcast, ''The Uncharted Zone'' began posting videos on YouTube in 2007. These videos gained popularity during 2009. In a 2010 interview, Phil Thomas Katt explained: ''âThe videos had been on YouTube for a while, and then, last year, things really took off.â''&lt;ref name=&quot;PNJ&quot; /&gt; Thanks to these YouTube videos, Katt became a cult icon to a growing group of fans and fellow musicians, and Gormley was propelled to internet stardom.&lt;ref name=&quot;PNJ&quot; /&gt;

In October 2010, Gormley received the first ever ''The Uncharted Zone'' 'Youzie Award'.&lt;ref name=&quot;Youzie&quot;/&gt; The award signified Gormley becoming the first artist in ''The Uncharted Zone's'' history to have a music video surpass one million views on YouTube.&lt;ref name=&quot;Youzie&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGktTdRBFbU|title=Mark Gormley Receives &quot;Youzie Award&quot; 2010|date=October 15, 2010|publisher=''The Uncharted Zone''|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gormley has been asked to perform by concert bookers and TV shows including the late-night talk show ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'', but he decided to decline the offers.&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogum.com/archives/music-related-content/mark-gormley-talks-about-his-i_048561.html|title=Mark Gormley Talks About His Internet Fame; Remains Adorable And Grounded|date=January 27, 2009|publisher=''[[Stereogum|Videogum]]''|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogum.com/archives/music-related-content/mark-gormleys-first-new-video_055061.html|title=Mark Gormley's First New Video Since His Worldwide Fame Happened! |date=February 25, 2009|publisher=''[[Stereogum|Videogum]]''|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gormley has avoided the spotlight and is notoriously [[Recluse|reclusive]].&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum3&quot; /&gt; In an interview conducted by ''The Uncharted Zone's'' Michele Carnley, Gormley claimed ''âI'm just little old me from Pensacola.â''&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum2&quot; /&gt; When asked about his sudden internet fame, Gormley replied ''âIt's a bit overwhelming. You know, when I did this I just did it for fun. Something to do, something therapeutic.â''&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum&quot; /&gt;

==Music videos==
Gormley's debut music video is for the song &quot;Beginnings&quot;, which includes still images of scenery in his native Pensacola.

The &quot;Little Wings&quot; music video includes footage of [[Gull|seagulls]] in flight, as Gormley sings in front of ocean scenes. Gormley and his music video for &quot;Little Wings&quot; were featured on the website of Colorado-based newspaper ''[[Westword]]'', who remarked &quot;there's something strangely appealing about Gormley...I have to say that this song is actually pretty great&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.westword.com/backbeat/2009/10/freaky_friday_little_wings_-_m.php|title=Freaky Friday: &quot;Little Wings&quot; - Mark Gormley|last=Casciato|first=Cory|date=October 16, 2009|publisher=''[[Westword]]''|accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Stereogum|Videogum]]'' listed the &quot;Little Wings&quot; music video as one of the best [[viral videos]] of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://videogum.com/archives/viral_video/the_best_viral_videos_of_2009_105741.html|title=The Best Viral Videos of 2009: A Retrospective|date=December 15, 2009|publisher=''[[Stereogum|Videogum]]''|accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Gray Days&quot; is one of Gormley's darkest songs, that ''[[LimeLife]]'' referred to as a &quot;moving, Zeppelinesque tribute&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.limelife.com/channel-music/486.html|title=Mark Gormley is a Genius|date=January 14, 2009|publisher=''[[LimeLife]]''|accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

I started hearing from folks all over the country. Mark never cared about being a celebrity, but the interest was there.â''&lt;ref name=&quot;PNJ&quot; /&gt; In January 2011, &quot;Without You&quot; was featured on [[truTV]]'s ''[[The Smoking Gun Presents: World's Dumbest...|The Smoking Gun Presents: World's Dumbest]]'' ''Performers #6''.&lt;ref name=&quot;truTV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zJ_YZg2hJ8|title=World's Dumbest Performers 6 #17|date=January 20, 2011|publisher=''[[truTV]]''|accessdate=2011-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators on the music video included actor [[Daniel Baldwin]], comedian [[Loni Love]], and writers [[Billy Kimball]] and Michael Loftus.&lt;ref name=&quot;truTV&quot; /&gt; Loni Love criticized Gormley's choice of clothing, whereas Michael Loftus commented &quot;you don't expect him to have a golden throat like that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;truTV&quot; /&gt;

Gormley's missed opportunites and sudden fame were parodied in the music video for &quot;The Cries in Our Eyes&quot;. During the course of the video, Gormley is depicted performing in front of famous [[landmarks]] from around the world and being photographed by [[paparazzi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;videogum2&quot; /&gt; According to Missouri newsweekly ''[[Riverfront Times]]'', the music video created &quot;the Mark Gormley tour that could have been&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.riverfronttimes.com/atoz/2009/03/st_louis_cheesy_music_video_mark_gormley_cries_in_our_eyes_arch.php|title=St. Louis Achieves Cheesy Music Video Fame!|last=Levitt|first=Aimee|date=March 3, 2009|publisher=''[[Riverfront Times]]''|accessdate=2010-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The music video for &quot;Sing Me Your Song&quot; largely takes place on the [[Moon]] and in space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro 2&quot; /&gt; The video capitalised on Gormley's success by featuring [[product placement]] for the [[Cheetos]] snack food.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro 2&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Video Static&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videostatic.com/vs/2010/01/diversion-mark-gormley-sing-me-your-song.html|title=DIVERSION: Mark Gormley &quot;Sing Me Your Song&quot;|last=Gottlieb|first=Steven|date=January 8, 2010|publisher=''Video Static''|accessdate=2010-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Music website ''Video Static'' described the song as &quot;haunting&quot; and praised the music videos use of product placement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Video Static&quot; /&gt; Gormley opted to receive no money from the product placement deal, giving all revenue to ''The Uncharted Zone'' to help them during the difficult economy.

Gormley's music video for the song &quot;All We Need&quot; was released on June 27, 2010. It marks the final music video from his debut album. Gormley plans to write and record new songs in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;G4TV&quot; /&gt; A Mark Gormley DVD is also in production.
