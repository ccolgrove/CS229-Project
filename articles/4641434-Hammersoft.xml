{{Politics of Philippines}}
A '''general election''' was held in the [[Philippines]] on April 7, 1978 for the election of the 166 (of the 208) regional representatives to the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (the nation's first parliament). The elections were participated by the leading opposition party, the '''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]''' (LABAN) which had twenty-one candidates for the Metro Manila area and the leading candidate was the jailed opposition leader [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Ninoy Aquino]] while the regime's party known as the '''[[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]]''' (KBL) which was led by the then First Lady [[Imelda Marcos]]. Ninoy was allowed to run by the his fellow party mates in the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] who boycotted the elections but was not allowed to campaign, so his family campaigned for him. The night before the elections on April 6, 1978, a noise barrage was organized by the supporters of (LABAN) which occurred up to dawn.

==Background==
The Philippines was under [[martial law]] since 1972, thereby the incumbent president [[Ferdinand Marcos]] ruled by decree. Prior to this, the [[Constitution of the Philippines]] was being drafted by the [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|Constitutional Convention]] whose delegates were [[Philippine Constitutional Convention election, 1970|elected in 1970]]. The Constitutional Convention approved the final draft of the Constitution which consisted of the abolition of the Philippine Congress and replaced with an interim National Assembly to consisted of the President, the Vice-President, the President of the Constitutional Convention and Members of the Senate and House of Representatives in November 1972 and [[Philippine constitutional plebiscite, 1973|later ratified]] on January 17, 1973 through so-called &quot;citizens' assemblies&quot;. The Constitution were amended twice in [[Philippine Martial Law referendum, 1973|July 27â28, 1973]] and [[Philippine executive and legislative powers referendum, 1975|February 27â28, 1975]]. The Constitution was amended once again in [[Philippine constitutional referendum-plebiscite, 1976|October 16â17, 1976]] which contained the &quot;Amendment No. 6&quot; which changed the name of the interim National Assembly from the &quot;National Assembly&quot; to &quot;Batasang Pambansa&quot; more commonly as the &quot;Batasan&quot;. 

==Campaign==
===Lakas ng Bayan===
{{main|Lakas ng Bayan}}
In 1978, from his prison cell, Aquino was allowed to take part in the elections. Although his friends, former Senators [[Gerry Roxas]] and [[Jovito Salonga]], preferred to boycott the elections, Aquino urged his supporters to organize and run 21 candidates in [[Metro Manila]]. Thus his political party, dubbed ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]'' (&quot;People's Power&quot;), was born. The party's acronym was &quot;LABAN&quot; (&quot;fight&quot; in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]). He was allowed one television interview on ''Face the Nation'' (hosted by Ronnie Nathanielsz) and proved to a startled and impressed populace that imprisonment had neither dulled his rapier-like tongue nor dampened his fighting spirit. Foreign correspondents and diplomats asked what would happen to the LABAN ticket. People agreed with him that his party would win overwhelmingly in an honest election. On April 6, 1978, supporters of the [[Lakas ng Bayan]] (LABAN), the opposition party headed by former Senator [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] who was still in jail and twenty other candidates contesting the Region IV-A (Metro Manila) seats, came out in protest by asking bystanders and cars to make noise in support the opposition.

===Kilusang Bagong Lipunan===
President Marcos created the [[Kilusang Bagong Lipunan]] (New Society Movement)
