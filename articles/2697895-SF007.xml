'''QtParted''' is a program for [[Linux]] which is used for creating, destroying, resizing and managing [[Partition (computing)|partitions]]. It uses the [[GNU Parted]] libraries and is built with the [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] toolkit. Like GNU Parted, it has inherent support for the resizing of [[NTFS]] partitions, using the [[ntfsresize]] utility. It does not handle LVM partitions.

The QtParted team does not provide an official [[Live CD]] to use QtParted with. However, QtParted is included in [[Ark Linux]] Live (the [[Ark Linux]] team is currently maintaining QtParted), in the popular live Linux distribution [[Knoppix]], on the [[Kubuntu]] live CD, in [[MEPIS]], in [[NimbleX]] and in the [[Trinity Rescue Kit]].

After not being maintained since 2005, it has been superseded by [[KDE Partition Manager]].
