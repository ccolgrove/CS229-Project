'''Western Washington University''' (''WWU'' or ''Western'') is one of six [[public university|state-funded]], [[university|four-year universities]] of [[higher education]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. It is located in [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]] and offers [[bachelor degree|bachelor's]] and [[master degree|master's]] degrees.

==History==
[[File:2009-0604-OldMain-WWU.jpg|thumb|left|Old Main]]
Western was established as the ''New Whatcom [[normal school|Normal School]]'', a teachers' school for women, by [[Phoebe Judson]] in [[Lynden, Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lynden.org/visiting/history.php Lynden Chamber of Commerce: Pioneer History]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually the school moved to Bellingham (then &quot;New Whatcom&quot;), and through the efforts of William R. Moultray and George Judson (Phoebe's son),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Judson |first=Phoebe Goodell |authorlink=|title=[[A Pioneer's Search for an Ideal Home|A Pioneer's Search for an Ideal Home: A Book of Personal Memoirs]] |origyear=1925 |year=1984 |publisher=University of Nebraska Press |location=Lincoln, Nebraska |isbn=0-8032-2563-6 |page=289|chapter=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Governor#United States|Governor]] [[John McGraw (governor)|John McGraw]] signed legislation establishing the ''New Whatcom Normal School'' on February 24, 1893. The first official class entered in 1899, composed of 88 students.

The institution that is now ''Western Washington University'' has since undergone several name changes. In 1901, the school's name was changed to ''State Normal School at Whatcom'' to reflect New Whatcom's name change. Again, in 1904, the name was changed to ''Washington State Normal School at Bellingham'' when the townships of Whatcom and [[Fairhaven, Washington|Fairhaven]] joined, and again in 1937, to ''Western Washington College of Education'' when it became a 4-year college. Twenty-four years later it became ''Western Washington State College'' and finally, in 1977, the institution gained university status.

The 1960s was a period of especially rapid growth for Western, as its enrollment increased from 3,000 students to over 10,000 during the decade. Also during this time, [[Fairhaven College]] was founded (1967), with non-traditional education methods that would serve as a model for [[Evergreen State College|The Evergreen State College]] in [[Olympia, Washington]]. Two years later, the Huxley College of the Environment was founded, continuing Western's trend toward &quot;cluster&quot; colleges. That same year, on a spring afternoon, students gained headlines by blocking [[Interstate 5]] to protest the [[Vietnam War]]. 

Since this period, the College of Arts and Sciences was founded (1973) and divided into the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences and the College of Sciences &amp;  Technology (2003); the College of Fine and Performing Arts was formed from several art departments (1975); and the College of Business and Economics was established (1976). During the 1999â2000 school year, Western celebrated its [[Centennial]].  

Today, WWU has a major presence in Bellingham's economy, and contributes significantly to the political, social, and artistic aspects of the city. With a student body that currently consists of over 14,000 students, the university is the third largest in Washington after Washington State University at about 26,000 students and the University of Washington at about 43,000 students both undergraduate and graduate.

==Campus==
[[Image:Fisher Fountain.JPGâ|thumb|Fisher Fountain]]
WWU's scenic location in Bellingham, a rapidly-growing city of about 80,000 people, overlooks [[Bellingham Bay]] and many of [[Puget Sound]]âs 172 [[San Juan Islands]]. It was originally built on a [[peat bog]], and due to this and the area's geography, the university has had to address problems from its buildings slowly sinking into the ground. The university is {{convert|90|mi|km}} north of [[Seattle]], {{convert|55|mi|km}} south of [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], and an hourâs drive from {{convert|10,778|ft|m|0|adj=on}} [[Mount Baker]].  The university is located close to [[Interstate 5]]. 

[[Image:Wilson Library.JPGâ|thumb|Wilson Library]]The campus is {{convert|215|acre|ha}}, including the  {{convert|38|acre|ha|adj=on}} Sehome Arboretum, operated jointly with the city of Bellingham.  Campus facilities include an electronic music studio, an air pollution lab, a motor vehicle research lab, a marine research lab, a wind tunnel, an [[electron microscope]], and a [[neutron generator]] lab.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.princetonreview.com/college/research/profiles/campuslife.asp?listing=1023539&amp;LTID=1&amp;intbucketid=&lt;/ref&gt; Western's Vehicle Research Institute has led ''[[Automobile Magazine]]'' to describe Western as &quot;very possibly the best school in the country for total car design.&quot;  Western also has off-campus facilities at Shannon Point Marine Center in [[Anacortes, Washington]]; Lakewood, a {{convert|15|acre|ha|adj=on}} student-university facility at nearby [[Lake Whatcom]]; and [[Whatcom County]] property used for environmental and aquatic analyses.

==Athletics==
[[Image:Western Washington University Viking Ship.jpg|right|WWU Vikings]]

WWU is a [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] member of the [[Great Northwest Athletic Conference]]. The university's [[mascot]] is a [[Viking]], named Victor E. Viking, identical to the mascot of [[Portland State Vikings|Portland State University]].

The Vikings won the first three GNAC All-Sports Championships and placed 31st among 225 NCAA II schools in U.S. Sports Academy Directorsâ Cup standings in 2003-04. In January 2004, the women's [[basketball]] team became the 15th NCAA school to win 700 games. A total of 59 Vikings earned league all-star honors and 34 were GNAC academic all-stars in 2003-04. In the 2006 and 2007 seasons, the Vikings participated in football as a member the [[North Central Conference]], as the GNAC discontinued the sport following the 2005 season. However, with the demise of the NCC on July 1, 2008, the GNAC re-started its football program in 2008 and the Vikings joined its five-team football division.  

However, on January 9, 2009 the school announced it would be dropping its football program effective immediately, meaning that the 2008 year was the last year football will be played.  The school finished the year at 6-5 and the program will finish with an overall record of 383-380-34 in 98 seasons starting in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/collegesports/2008607131_western09.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Western Washing University shuts down its football program after 98 seasons | first=Bud | last=Withers | date=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western varsity squads have won a total of five national championships (Softball-1998, Women's Rowing 2005-2008), and the club Cycling team won a title in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://west.wwu.edu/ucomm_news/articles/1519.asp|title= WWU Cycling Wins National Championship Team Earns Top Spot in Division II National Collegiate Road Championship|publisher=Western Washington University|accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With their women's rowing capturing the national title again in 2008, Western became the first school in NCAA history to 4-peat as national champions.{{Clarifyme|date=March 2008}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sports/2003726940_colleges30.html|title= State Colleges Report | WWU 3-peat not a surprise|publisher=The Seattle Times|accessdate=2007-12-11 | date=May 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Wade King Student Recreation Center.JPGâ|thumb|Wade King Student Recreation Center]]

In 2007, the Viking volleyball team finished national runner-up in the NCAA tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ncaasports.com/volleyball/womens/recaps/d2_1201_01633154/2007|title= Concordia-St. Paul 3, Western Washington 1|publisher=[[NCAA]]|accessdate=2007-12-02}}{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the best finish in school history, bettering a third place in the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics|NAIA]] tournament in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://wwuvikings.cstv.com/sports/w-volley/recaps/120107aae.html|title= WWU is NCAA II National Runner-up, loses to Concordia-St. Paul in title match|accessdate=2007-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Men's Cross Country team finished 11th at nationals, well above their pre-nats ranking of 17th. The nationals squad included four redshirt freshman, and only two seniors, giving the Viking XC team a very promising future.

The Vikings again made the tourney in 2010 losing to #5 Davenport University of Michigan in the first round 11-9. Western competes in the PNCLL Division 2 league with teams such as Western Oregon, Gonzaga, Pacific Lutheran, Whitman and Central Washington. The Vikings have qualified for the playoffs the last 7 seasons never winning the PNCLL title. 

=== Waterskiing ===
The WWU Water Ski Team competed at the 31st Collegiate Water Ski National Championships, Oct. 22-24, at Ironwood Ranch in Arvin, Calif.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncwsa.com/index.php/nationals/archived-nationals/2009-nationals 2009 Nationals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Hosted by Cal Poly and sanctioned by USA Water Ski and the National Collegiate Water Ski Association, the competition included 12 teams in Division 1 and 10 teams in Division 2. The WWU Water Ski Team led the field after two events and managed to stay in 1st after their second event, slalom skiing.  As the last day of competition started, Westerns team brought their 'A' game and managed to stay top three after the final event, trick skiing.  The WWU Water Ski Team took 3rd place after multiple days of intense competition.

Kenny O'Connell, alumni of WWU, recently donated $13 million to help fund a new Water Ski facility, the KOC Center. This facility, according to star skier Cameron Van Til, &quot;will help us go the distance, if you know what I mean.&quot; O'Connell however, declined to comment when asked by the Hillsborough Times of whether or not he will be in attendance at any of the 2012 WWU competitions.
