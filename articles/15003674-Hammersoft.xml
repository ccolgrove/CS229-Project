'''JoÃ£o Eduardo de Salles Nobre''', known as '''Dudu Nobre''' ([[Rio de Janeiro (city)|Rio de Janeiro, RJ]], November 6 of 1974), is a [[Brazil]]ian [[composer]] and [[singer]].

== Biography ==
He is the son of the [[Engineering|engineer]] JoÃ£o Nobre and of Anita Nobre. His mother, Anita Nobre, controlled three [[pagode]] bands, where Dudu, already in his infancy, used to play with tam-tam and [[pandeiro]] with the same ease that his neighbors were applied in marbles. And he did not reject this apprenticeship in his backyard.&lt;ref name=pla020885&gt;{{pt icon}} [http://www.dudunobre.com.br/?sec_atual=11 Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result, when he was six years old, he started to study classic [[piano]], and when he was nine he received the instrument that would never separate from himâthe [[cavaquinho]].&lt;ref name=pla020885/&gt;

When Dudu was ten years old, he iniciated his career in the samba schools for beginners. There he met the mythical Beto &quot;''Sem BraÃ§o''&quot; (Without arm) and the two starred in the [[samba-enredo]] of Alegria da Passarela, a school that later became Aprendizes do Salgueiro, the school for beginners owned by [[GRES AcadÃªmicos do Salgueiro]]. &quot;Beto was one of the most experienced (''sambistas'') that I ever knew,&quot; Dudu cites in his official site.&lt;ref name=pla020885/&gt; 

After this he attributed credit to three sambas in Aprendizes do Salgueiro, another in Herdeiros da Vila, and one more in Estrelinha da Mocidade and also in ImpÃ©rio do Futuro. This as an adolescent composer. 

As a musician, when he was thirteen he made a cycle of shows with [[Mocidade Independente de Padre Miguel]] and when he was 15 he rotated in [[Switzerland]], [[Finland]], [[England]], and [[Germany]], with Cia. Brasiliana.&lt;ref name=pla020885/&gt;

Back in Brazil, he joined the band of [[Almir Guineto]] and later played with DicrÃ³ and Pedrinho da Flor. When Dudu was 19 years old, he joined the band of [[Zeca Pagodinho]], same epoch when Dudu entered into the Law Faculty. The advocacy was repealed in the fifth year.&lt;ref name=pla020885/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getmein.com/world-music/dudu-nobre-1/info.html Getmein]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dudu writes that &quot;Zeca is a godfather. And he tells me that the samba is a passion and that I was chosen by the samba&quot;.&lt;ref name=pla020885/&gt;
 
Dudu was married with the model and dancer [[Adriana Bombom]] and has two daughters: Olivia and Thalita.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1658494/bio IMBD]&lt;/ref&gt; They got divorced in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ego.globo.com/Gente/Noticias/0,,MUL1282035-9798,00-DUDU+NOBRE+CONFIRMA+AFASTAMENTO+DE+ADRIANA+BOMBOM+AGORA+E+NOTORIO.html Dudu Nobre confirma afastamento de Adriana Bombom: âAgora Ã© notÃ³rioâ]&lt;/ref&gt; He is the brother of the standard bearer Lucinha Nobre.

== Compositions ==
Among the musics that really succeeded, are detached:

# ''Vou botar teu nome na macumba'' (I am going to put your name in the [[macumba]]);
# ''Posso atÃ© me apaixonar'' (I can even fall in love);
# ''...SÃ£o Jorge, AnastÃ¡cia e as crianÃ§as'' (...[[Saint George]], Anastsia, and the children);
# ''Ãgua da Minha Sede'' (Water of my thirst);
# ''Pro Amor Render'' (Fot the love to surrender);
# ''Chegue Mais'' (Arrive more).
