{{wiktionary}}
'''''Aloha''''' in the [[Hawaiian language]] means ''[[affection]]'', ''[[peace]]'', ''[[compassion]]'' and ''[[mercy]]''. Since the middle of the 19th century, it also has come to be used as an [[English language|English]] greeting to say ''[[wiktionary:goodbye|goodbye]]'' and ''[[hello]]''. Currently, it is mostly used in the sense of ''hello''.

It is also the [[state nickname]] of [[Hawaii]], the &quot;Aloha State&quot;.

==Etymology==
The word ''aloha'' derives from the [[proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] root *''qarofa'', and ultimately from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollexonline&gt;[http://pollex.org.nz/entry/qarofa.a/ Polynesian Lexicon Online]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=biggs1979&gt;Biggs, Bruce, 1979. Proto-Polynesian Word List II. ''Working Papers in Anthropology, Archaeology, linguistics, and Maori Studies No. 53.'' Department of Anthropology, University of Auckland.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=s87CbwAACAAJ&amp;dq=etymology+of+aloha+with+qalofa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nDx3Tu76LsLZ0QHQ563hDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;It has cognates in other [[Polynesian languages]], such as [[Samoan language|Samoan]] ''alofa'' and  [[MÄori language|MÄori]] ''aroha'', also meaning &quot;love.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=s87CbwAACAAJ&amp;dq=etymology+of+aloha+with+qalofa&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=nDx3Tu76LsLZ0QHQ563hDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA], additional text.&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[folk etymology]] claims that it derives from a compound of the [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]] words ''alo'' meaning &quot;presence&quot;, &quot;front&quot;, &quot;face&quot;, or &quot;share&quot;; and ''ha'', meaning &quot;breath of life&quot; or &quot;essence of life.&quot; Although ''alo'' does indeed mean &quot;presence&quot; etc., the word for breath is spelled with a macron or kahakoÅ over the a (hÄ) whereas the word aloha does not have a long a.

==Usage==
The use of the word as a greeting has been reconstructed to Proto-Polynesian.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollexonline2&gt;[http://pollex.org.nz/entry/qarofa.b/ Polynesian Lexicon Online]&lt;/ref&gt; Before contact with the West, other words used for greeting included ''welina'' and ''anoai.'' Today, &quot;aloha kakahiaka&quot; is the phrase for &quot;good morning.&quot; &quot;Aloha {{okina}}auinalÄ&quot; means &quot;good afternoon&quot; and &quot;aloha ahiahi&quot; means &quot;good evening.&quot; &quot;Aloha kÄakou&quot; is a common form of &quot;welcome to all.&quot;

In modern Hawai{{okina}}i, numerous businesses have aloha in their names, with more than 3 pages of listings in the O{{okina}}ahu phone book alone.

==Trends==
Recent trends are popularizing the term elsewhere in the United States. Popular entertainer, [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] star and [[Hollywood]] actress [[Bette Midler]], born in Honolulu, uses the greeting frequently in national appearances. The word was also used frequently in the 1968 and 2010 versions of the hit television drama ''[[Hawaii Five-0]]''. In the influential [[1982]] film comedy ''[[Fast Times at Ridgemont High]]'' the student, and surfer, Jeff Spicolli, [[Sean Penn]], uses the greeting with the eccentric teacher Mr. Hand, [[Ray Walston]], who had earlier made use of the greeting himself. The Aloha Spirit is a major concept in ''[[Lilo and Stitch]]'', a [[Disney]] series of movies and TV shows, set in Hawai{{okina}}i. The drama series ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]]'', shot in Hawai{{okina}}i, has a thank you note at the end of the credits saying &quot;We thank the people of Hawai{{okina}}i and their Aloha Spirit&quot;. Aloha is a term also used in the [[Nickelodeon (TV channel)|Nickelodeon]] program [[Rocket Power]].

Arguably the most famous historical Hawaiian song, &quot;[[Aloha Ê»Oe]]&quot; was written by the last queen of Hawaii, [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]].

The term inspired the name of the [[ALOHAnet|ALOHA Protocol]] introduced in the 1970s by the [[University of Hawaii]].

In Hawai{{okina}}i someone can be said to have or show aloha in the way they treat others; whether family, friend, neighbor or stranger.
