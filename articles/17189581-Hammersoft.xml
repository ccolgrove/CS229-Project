==Content==
{{Main|List of programs broadcast by Cartoon Network (Southeast Asia)}}
Almost all of its programs are either from [[Warner Bros.]], [[MGM]] or [[Hanna-Barbera]]. For the Philippine feed is one of only two feeds that has '''Toonami''' as an [[anime]]/[[Super Sentai|Power Rangers]] block, the other being to Pakistani feed the compete with [[Animax (TV network)|Animax]]'s South Asia feed. While the Southeast Asia feed is using for original Cartoon Network Studios as well as Warner Bros. Animation . This Southeast Asia feed is now avalailable for [[anime]]/[[Super Sentai]] programming: [[Naruto]], [[Inazuma Eleven]] and [[Kamen Rider: Dragon Knight]].

==Brief history==
===1 January 1994 â 21 August 1999: Checkerboard Era===
It had started its broadcast on 1 January 1994 as the dual-channel names '''TNT &amp; Cartoon Network''', operating from 06:00 am to 09:00 pm runtime a 15-hours broadcasting, with [[Turner Classic Movies]] (formerly [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]) taking the remainder of the daily schedule. On 1 July 2001, Cartoon Network Asia became a separate 24-hour channel, with exclusive local feeds for the [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]]-speaking areas like [[Republic of China]], the [[English language|English Speaking]] areas in the [[Philippines]], [[India]], [[Singapore]], [[Australia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Brunei]], [[Thailand]], [[Myanmar]], [[Vietnam]], [[Korean language|Korean]] speaking areas in [[South Korea]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese speaking areas]] in [[Japan]].

It originally aired only [[List of works produced by Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera cartoons]] such as [[Yogi Bear]], [[Top Cat]], [[The Flintstones]] etc. The channel quickly started to develop though, airing for the first time MGM cartoons ([[Tom and Jerry]], [[Droopy]], and [[Spike and Tyke]]) in 1996, and (after [[Time Warner]]'s purchase of Turner in 1996) Warner Bros shows ([[Looney Tunes]], and several other Looney Tunes related cartoons) in 1997. In 1998, Cartoon Network started to air its first original shows ([[Space Ghost Coast to Coast]] and [[The Moxy Show]]), however [[The Moxy Show]] was soon cancelled.

===22 August 1999 â 30 September 2005: Powerhouse Era===
August 22, 1999 was the day Cartoon Network received its first facelift, introducing new bumpers, new shows and a new 'powerhouse' theme. The new shows for 1999 were [[Dexter's Laboratory]], [[Cow &amp; Chicken]], [[I Am Weasel]], [[Ed, Edd n' Eddy]] and [[Johnny Bravo]]. The following year, 2000, saw even more Cartoon Network originals being introduced, including [[The Powerpuff Girls]], [[Mike, Lu &amp; Og]] and [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]. Some of these shows ([[Mike, Lu &amp; Og]], [[Ed, Edd n' Eddy]] and [[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]) were not produced by Cartoon Network. In 2001, the rate of new Cartoon Network originals kept going, with [[Sheep in the Big City]], [[Time Squad]], and [[Samurai Jack]] being brought in. Due to the large number of Cartoon Network originals that were on Cartoon Network, they decided to name these shows ''[[Cartoon Cartoons]]'', which led to the Friday night block Cartoon Cartoon Fridays being introduced to Asia later in 2001. Also in 2001, Cartoon Network introduced other programming blocks including Toonami, Acme Hour, Prime Time, [[Boomerang (Southeast Asia)|Boomerang]] (now a channel) and Cartoon Network After Dark. 2002 saw more [[Cartoon Cartoons]] introduced including [[Grim &amp; Evil]], [[Robot Jones]], and [[Codename: Kids Next Door]]. [[Grim &amp; Evil]] eventually spun off into two separate series, [[The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy]] and [[Evil Con Carne]]. [[Justice League]] and [[Mucha Lucha!]] also debuted on Cartoon Network in 2002.

In January 2003, the Southeast Asian version made its debut in [[South Korea]], after the cancellation of Cartoon Network block on [[Tooniverse]]. However, CN SEA cannot contain a Korean audio track as the South Korean law prohibits non-South Korean TV channels carrying Korean audio track. But it could carry Korean subtitles.

In 2003, there were no new Cartoon Network original shows added to the schedule, however there were several new programming blocks and non-Cartoon-Cartoons added. The programming blocks include Boomeraction (currently a block on the channel Boomerang), and Tiny TV (currently also a block on Boomerang). Shows added to the line-up in 2003 include [[The Mask]], and X Men: Evolution. 2004 saw the introduction of [[Foster's Home For Imaginary Friends]], the sole new show to debut that year. Programming blocks introduced in 2004 include Fridays (which was the replacement for the now-defunct Cartoon Cartoon Fridays). Also, 2005 was the year that the Boomerang programming block was made into a TV channel.

===1 October 2005 â 30 August 2008: City Era===
On October 1, 2005, the bumpers were replaced with 3-D animations of a 'city' that all the Cartoon Network toons lived in. Show-specific bumpers were replaced with 3-D animations of a well-known scene from the particular show (e.g.: a [[Dexter's Laboratory]] bumper would feature Dexter's house, a [[The Powerpuff Girls|Powerpuff Girls]] bumper would feature most likely the PPG household, and so forth). The retro, checker board logo was replaced with the 'CN' city-style logo of today. In 2006, several new Cartoon Network originals premiered, including [[Ben 10]], [[The Life and Times of Juniper Lee]], [[Camp Lazlo]], [[Hi Hi Puffy Ami Yumi]], [[My Gym Partner's a Monkey]] and [[Squirrel Boy]]. The ''Cartoon Cartoons'' moniker previously used for Cartoon Network originals was also dropped in 2006.

In 2006, [[JoongAng Ilbo]] and Turner made a joint venture to launch a separate South Korean version of Cartoon Network. It was set to launch in November 2006. However, the launch was suddenly delayed due to the content dispute with [[Tooniverse]]: The joint venture was going to make its own Korean language version of some of CN originals, apart from the one already produced by Tooniverse. ([[The Powerpuff Girls]], [[Dexter's Laboratory]] and [[Johnny Bravo]] for example.) Then, the plan was eventually cancelled.

===31 August 2008 â 1 October 2011: New Wave Era===
On August 31, 2008, the format of Cartoon Network's bumpers and commercials changed and also CN changed the name of Cartoon Network Theatre to Cartoon Network Popcorn.
With the major visual theme being the recurring 'dynamic line' in all the station IDs and bumps etc.

Recently, Cartoon Network began to broadcast Japanese television series, including live action ones. However, because of local regulations and broadcasting rights issues (For example, in South Korea, broadcast of Japanese TV programmes, as well as South Korean-Japanese co-productions, on the non-South Korean TV channels, except signals from Japan, are prohibited), some Japanese programmes are only available &quot;in selected territories&quot;. Continuing South Korean examples, [[Naruto]], [[Inazuma Eleven (manga)|Inazuma Eleven]] and [[Kamen Rider Hibiki|Masked Rider Hibiki]] are often blocked while a text disclaimer is filling screen, or, replaced by non-Japanese series. [[Powerpuff Girls Z]], an American-Japanese co-production, made an exception.

===1 October 2011 - Present: It's a Fun Thing! (Check it) Era===
On 1 October 2011, during The Amazing World of Gumball premiere, Cartoon Network introduced its new branding and logo. Designed by [[Brand New School]], it makes heavy use of the black and white checkerboard motif, as well as various CMYK color variations and patterns. The slogan ''It's a Fun Thing!'' was also introduced.

==Programming Blocks==
===Cartoon Network Popcorn===
Premiering movies that range from Cartoon Network specials to non-related movies, on Saturday at 6:00 PM and Sunday at 11:00 AM. Originally introduced as ''Cartoon Network Theater'' under the City look.

===Cartoon Network Video===
In late 2007 Cartoon Network launched Cartoon Network Video, a video on demand service designed for Asia Pacific broadband viewers with flash video. It does not allow full screen viewing..


===Good Morning Scooby!===

==Former Blocks==
===Chunky Toons===
This was a time block that featured Cartoon Network original series with minimal breaks. Eventually, in March 2008, CN expanded the minimal breaks scheme to the entire schedule. 



===Boomerang===
{{Main|Boomerang (Southeast Asia TV channel)}}
Now a separate [[Boomerang (TV channel)|TV channel]] is now available in the Asia-Pacific region (Boomerang Australia and Boomerang SeAsia Feed).

===Tiny TV===
Tiny TV was first shown on Cartoon Network Asia in June 2002 from 9am - 12pm on weekdays. Previously, the block aired babyfied versions of cartoon series such as [[The Flintstone Kids]], [[Baby Looney Tunes]], [[Tom &amp; Jerry Kids]] and [[A Pup Named Scooby Doo]].

Due to improvement of schedule changes, Tiny TV was moved to earlier in the morning, and eventually ended on November 2008 on Cartoon Network (Southeast Asia).

===Toonami===
A time block which is dedicated in showing action-oriented non-anime shows every Monday to Thursday nights and on Weekend mornings. This block was removed on January 2009, nevertheless, the former Toonami programs continued to be shown without the Toonami branding for some time afterward.

===Fridays===
This Friday evening program block originally consisted of three parts:
* '''Fridays Premiere''' shows new episodes of cartoon series;
* '''Fridays .Com Pick''' broadcasts shows that have been chosen by TV viewers.
* '''Fridays Flick''' shows movies.

The .Com Pick and movie segments were later dropped, leaving just Fridays Premiere. The premiere was dropped in 2009, and briefly revived for ''[[Speed Racer: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Ben 10: Alien Force]]'' later that year.

===New Mondays===
For a few months, Cartoon Network Asia broadcast two cartoon series with two new episodes each every Monday night from 6:00 p.m. Shows premiered in this block were ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'', ''[[The Secret Saturdays]]'', ''[[Chowder]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Two-Shoes]]''.
