'''''Big Shiny Tunes''''' is a series of [[rock (music)|rock]] albums featuring Various Artists compiled and released by the [[Canada|Canadian]] [[music television]] station [[MuchMusic]], beginning in 1996. The best-selling album of the series was ''Big Shiny Tunes 2'', which was certified Diamond in Canada (1,000,000 units) by the [[CRIA]] on March 25, 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRIA.ca&quot;&gt;[http://www.cria.ca/cert_db_search.php?page=1&amp;wclause=+WHERE+cert_album_name+like+%27%25big+shiny+tunes%25%27+ORDER+BY+cert_date%2C+cert_award+&amp;rcnt=39&amp;csearch=20&amp;nextprev=1 CRIA.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been cited as the best-selling album series in Canadian history,&lt;ref name=&quot;niche&quot;&gt;Tom Harrison, &quot;Big Shiny Tunes finds big niche: Compilation albums reflect modern rock and sell millions in Canada,&quot; ''The Province,'' Vancouver, B.C.: January 13, 2002, pg. B.5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chapters]], &quot;[http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/item.asp?Item=9463418782&amp;Catalog=Music&amp;N=36+321142&amp;Lang=en&amp;Section=music&amp;zxac=1 Big Shiny Tunes 10],&quot; URL accessed February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; with 5 million albums sold in ten years.&lt;ref&gt;[[CNW Group]], &quot;[http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/November2005/10/c3472.html MuchMusic Celebrates 10 Years of 'Big Shiny Tunes'],&quot; November 10, 2005, URL accessed February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characteristics==
The ''Big Shiny Tunes'' albums are each thought to be composed of a combination of rock songs that are major hits by well-known artists, less successful songs by well-known artists and songs by more obscure artists, released in the same year as the albums' publication.&lt;ref&gt;Ivan Danielewicz, &quot;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/viewstory.php?sid=8503 Spun],&quot; Gauntlet Publications Society, [[University of Calgary]], February 05, 2004, URL accessed February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  There are a combination of Canadian, British and American performers. One common feature among the selected artists is that they are attached to [[Universal Music]], [[Warner Bros.]], [[EMI Music Canada]], and/or MuchMusic, who come together to produce ''Big Shiny Tunes'' albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;niche&quot;/&gt;

Part of the appeal of the series is that those who do not usually buy albums will find ''Big Shiny Tunes'' provides several well-known songs, as opposed to a CD by a single artist whose non-single tracks may be relatively unfamiliar.&lt;ref name=&quot;niche&quot;/&gt; The music is aimed at teenagers and young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond J. Arsenault, &quot;Big Shiny Tunes really shining,&quot; ''Journal- Pioneer'', Summerside, Prince Edward Island: November 27, 1999, pg. A.7.&lt;/ref&gt; There has been some criticism of consistency in regards to the use of censored versus uncensored versions of songs from album to album (''Big Shiny Tunes 6'' carried a label stating that some songs contained coarse language, while the previous and following albums had censored songs by Matthew Good, Limp Bizkit, Staind, Not By Choice and Wheatus).

In addition to the ordinary albums in the series, MuchMusic also released albums that compile the biggest hits across a span of years, such as ''Big Shiny 80s'' (2005) that included classics like [[Billy Idol]]'s &quot;[[White Wedding (song)|White Wedding]].&quot; There have also been two volumes of ''Big Shiny 90s'' released.

==History==
The album ''Big Shiny Tunes'' was released in 1996.  A new edition has since been released every year, with ''Big Shiny Tunes 2'' being particularly successful (the second and third albums alone account for 2,000,000 of the CDs and tapes sold under the brand).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=''[[Chart (magazine)|Chart]]'' | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080323152551/http://www.chartattack.com/damn/1999/19991117.html | archivedate=2008-03-23 | url=http://www.chartattack.com/damn/1999/19991117.html | date=1999-11-17 | title=Daily Music News | accessdate=2009-10-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Big Shiny Tunes 2'' had been accompanied by heavy advertising.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Dafoe, &quot;New Recordings pop Big Shiny tunes 2,&quot; ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', Toronto, Ontario: January 22, 1998, pg. C.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The next year, MuchMusic assembled ''Big Shiny Tunes 3'' by having its audience vote on which songs they would like to have included, a novel process.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri Block, &quot;[http://www.carillon.uregina.ca/99.01.21/arts/cds.html CD Reviews],&quot; ''The Carillon'', January, 1999, volume 41, no. 17, [[University of Regina]], URL accessed February 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The success of the series continued as ''Big Shiny Tunes 6'' sold 68,500 copies in its first week in 2001, more than any other album in Canada that week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem&quot;&gt;John Williams, &quot;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/E/Eminem/2002/11/20/744919.html Eminem polishes off 'Shiny Tunes'],&quot; [[Canoe.ca]], URL accessed February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the series would soon lose its predominance with the growth in popularity of [[rap music]], as the next year ''Big Shiny Tunes 7'' was outsold in its first week in Canada by [[Eminem]]'s [[8 Mile (soundtrack)|soundtrack to the film ''8 Mile'']].  Still, ''Big Shiny Tunes 7'' sold 25,100 copies that week.&lt;ref name=&quot;Eminem&quot;/&gt;  ''Big Shiny Tunes 8'', released in 2003, would also make the best-seller list in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;John Williams, &quot;[http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/F/Furtado_Nelly/2003/12/03/745274.html New Furtado stumbles on chart],&quot; [[Canoe.ca]], URL accessed February 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  The latest album in the series, ''Big Shiny Tunes 14'', was released on October 20, 2009. No edition of Big Shiny Tunes was released in 2010, possibly indicating the discontinuation of the series.
