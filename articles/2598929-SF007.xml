'''Avidemux''' is a [[free and open-source]] [[video editing software|video editing program]] designed for video editing and [[video processing]]. It is written in [[C++]], and uses either the [[GTK+]] or [[Qt (framework)|Qt]].

== Features ==
Avidemux is capable of [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear video editing]], applying [[visual effect]]s (called âFiltersâ by Avidemux) to video, and [[transcoding]] video into various formats. Some of the filters were [[Porting|ported]] from [[MPlayer]] and [[Avisynth]]. Avidemux can also insert audio streams into a video file (an action known as [[multiplexing]] or âmuxingâ) or extract audio streams from video files (an action known as âdemuxingâ).

An integral and important part of the design of the program is its '''project system''', which uses the [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine]]. Whole projects with all options, configurations, selections, and preferences can be saved into a project file. Like [[VirtualDub]]'s VCF scripting capabilities, Avidemux has advanced scripting available for it both in its [[GUI]] and command line modes. It also supports a non-project system just like VirtualDub, where users can simply create all of their configurations and save the video directly without making a project file. A project queue system is also available.

Avidemux has built-in subtitle processing, both for [[Optical Character Recognition]] of DVD subtitles and for rendering hard subtitle. Avidemux supports various subtitle formats, including [[MicroDVD]] (.SUB), [[SubStation Alpha]] (.SSA), [[Advanced SubStation Alpha]] (.ASS) and [[SubRip]] (.SRT).

While it is primarily a [[GUI]] program, Avidemux can also be run from the [[command line]].

=== Components ===
Avidemux was written from scratch, but additional code from [[FFmpeg]], [[MPlayer]], [[Transcode (software)|Transcode]] and [[Avisynth]] has been used on occasion as well. Nonetheless it is a completely standalone program that does not require any other programs to read, decode, or encode other than itself. The built-in libavcodec library from the FFmpeg project is used for decoding and encoding of various audio and video formats such as MPEG-4 ASP. The primary (though not the only) Avidemux programmer is a person known as Mean, who often frequents the Avidemux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Avidemux project is open to user input and many suggestions from its users have already been implemented as fully written features.

=== Multithreading ===
Multithreading has been implemented in the following areas of Avidemux (some partially through libavcodec):
* Encoding
** [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] (using [[x264]])
** [[MPEG-1]] and [[MPEG-2]] (using [[libavcodec]])
** [[MPEG-4 Part 2]] (SP/[[Advanced Simple Profile|ASP]], using libavcodec or [[Xvid]])
*** Xvid requires the latest version from the CVS
* Decoding
** MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 (using libavcodec)
** MPEG-4 Part 2 (SP/ASP, using libavcodec)

==Versions and ports==
The current stable version of Avidemux is 2.5.3. Compared to the 2.3 and earlier versions, Avidemux 2.4 offers 3 user interfaces: [[GTK+]], shell and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] 4.

Avidemux is available for almost all distributions of [[Linux]] that are capable of compiling C++, GTK+ and the [[SpiderMonkey (JavaScript engine)|SpiderMonkey JavaScript engine]]. A [[Win32]] version of this program is also available for [[Microsoft Windows]] users, as well as [[Mac OS X]], [[FreeBSD]], [[NetBSD]] and [[OpenBSD]] ports and packages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Comparison ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
Avidemux can be compared with [[VirtualDub]] or [[VirtualDubMod]]. While it cannot do everything that VirtualDub can, Avidemux can do things that its Windows-only counterpart cannot. It has native support for OGM, MP4 and Matroska files, direct read input for various types of [[MPEG]] files, and many other video formats and containers. It offers [[MPEG]] editing and requantization. It also has built-in subtitle handling.

Avidemux's features and functions are comparable to VirtualDub, but it has also been criticized for a poor user interface. Due to Avidemux's [[Thread (computer science)|multithreading]] features and native support for [[x86-64]], it was capable of outperforming VirtualDub in certain respects for several years.

Avidemux primarily uses its GUI to perform tasks. This means that it is capable of doing many things that non-[[GUI]] users would otherwise have to do using command line tools such as [[MEncoder]] or [[Transcode (software)|Transcode]].
