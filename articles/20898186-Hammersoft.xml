The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Buffalo Bills]] season''' was the 50th Professional Football season for the original [[American Football League]] team, and its 40th in the NFL. The Bills were unable to improve upon their third consecutive 7â9 regular season record ([[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]], [[2007 Buffalo Bills season|2007]], and [[2008 Buffalo Bills season|2008]]) and failed to make the playoffs for the 10th consecutive year, the longest standing playoff drought in the NFL (tied with the [[Detroit Lions]]).

[[Dick Jauron]] returned as head coach for a fourth season, the first Bills coach since [[Marv Levy]] to receive a contract extension beyond three years. He was fired on November 17 after a 3â6 start and replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator [[Perry Fewell]].

===Regular season===
The Bills played a 16-game schedule in 2009, in accordance with the [[Regular season (NFL)#Formula|NFL scheduling formula]]. The schedule consisted of six games against their [[AFC East]] divisional rivals (two each against the [[Miami Dolphins]], [[New England Patriots]], and [[New York Jets]]), four intra-conference games versus the [[AFC South]] (one game each against the [[Houston Texans]], [[Indianapolis Colts]], [[Jacksonville Jaguars]], and [[Tennessee Titans]]), four inter-conference games against teams from the [[NFC South]] (one game each against the [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Carolina Panthers]], [[New Orleans Saints]], and [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]]), and two games against the remaining two AFC teams that, like Buffalo, finished fourth in their respective divisions in 2008 (one game each versus the [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Kansas City Chiefs]]). For the first time, the Bills faced the Buccaneers in Buffalo; in the 33-year history of the Tampa Bay franchise, all previous regular-season games between the two teams have been held in [[Tampa|Tampa, Florida]].

The Bills began their season at [[Gillette Stadium]] for an AFL Legacy duel with their AFC East rival, the [[New England Patriots]], in the first game of a [[ESPN Monday Night Football|MNF]] doubleheader.  Buffalo got off to a fast start in the first quarter as quarterback [[Trent Edwards]] completed an 11-yard touchdown pass to rookie tight end [[Shawn Nelson (American football)|Shawn Nelson]].  The Patriots would respond in the second quarter as running back [[Fred Taylor (American football)|Fred Taylor]] got a 1-yard touchdown run, yet Buffalo came right back as defensive end [[Aaron Schobel]] returned an interception 26 yards for a touchdown.  New England would close out the half with kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] getting a 20-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Bills would add to their lead as kicker [[Rian Lindell]] made a 40-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Patriots replied with Gostkowski nailing a 28-yard field goal.  Buffalo would increase their lead as Edwards completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]].  With just over 5 minutes to play, The Patriots would strike back as quarterback [[Tom Brady]] completed an 18-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Benjamin Watson]] (with a failed two-point conversion).  On the ensuing kickoff, cornerback [[Leodis McKelvin]] got the kickoff from his own endzone and got as far as the Bills 31-yard line, where he was stripped of the ball and New England's Gostkowski recovered.  This would eventually set up Brady's 16-yard touchdown pass to Watson (with another failed two-point conversion). With under a minute to play Buffalo tried to respond, but the Patriots' defense was too much to overcome.

With the bitter loss, the Bills began their season at 0â1.

===Week 2: vs. Tampa Bay Buccaneers===

Hoping to rebound from a tough loss to the Patriots, the Bills would play their Week 2 home opener in an interconference duel with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].  This would be the first time that Buffalo ever hosted Tampa Bay in a regular season game, since they played a preseason game with each other in 1977.

In the first quarter, the Bills came out firing as quarterback [[Trent Edwards]] completed a 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]], safety [[Donte Whitner]] returning an interception 76 yards for a touchdown, and kicker [[Rian Lindell]] making a 31-yard field goal.  The Buccaneers would get on the board in the second quarter as quarterback [[Byron Leftwich]] completed a 42-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Kellen Winslow II|Kellen Winslow]], while Buffalo replied with Lindell getting a 43-yard field goal.  Tampa Bay would close out the half as Leftwich completed an 8-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Carnell Williams|Carnell &quot;Cadillac&quot; Williams]].

After a scoreless third quarter, the Bills began to pull away as Lindell got a 43-yard field goal and Edwards completed a 43-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Terrell Owens]].  The Buccaneers tried to rally as Leftwich completed a 6-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Jerramy Stevens]] (with a failed two-point conversion), yet Buffalo closed out the game with Lindell nailing a 20-yard field goal.

With the win, the Bills improved to 1â1.

Coming off their win the Buccaneers, the Bills stayed at home for a Week 3 interconference duel with the [[New Orleans Saints]].  Buffalo would trail early as Saints running back [[Lynell Hamilton]] got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Bills would answer in the second quarter on a fake field goal attempt, punter [[Brian Moorman]] threw a 25-yard touchdown pass to defensive end [[Ryan Denney]].  New Orleans would close out the half with kicker [[John Carney (American football)|John Carney]]'s 27-yard field goal.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Saints took control in the fourth quarter with running back [[Pierre Thomas (American football)|Pierre Thomas]]' 34-yard touchdown run, Carney's 35-yard field goal, and Thomas' 19-yard touchdown run.

With the loss, Buffalo fell to 1â2.

Hoping to rebound from their home loss to the Saints, the Bills flew to [[Land Shark Stadium]] for a Week 4 AFC East duel with the [[Miami Dolphins]].  After a scoreless first quarter, Buffalo would find themselves trailing in the second as Dolphins kicker [[Dan Carpenter]] got a 33-yard field goal, followed by cornerback [[Vontae Davis]] returning an interception 23 yards for a touchdown.  The Bills would get on the board with a 35-yard field goal from kicker [[Rian Lindell]], but Miami would answer with running back [[Ronnie Brown]]'s 1-yard touchdown run.

The Dolphins' domination continued into the third quarter with quarterback [[Chad Henne]] completing a 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Brian Hartline]], followed by a 1-yard touchdown run by running back [[Ricky Williams]].  Buffalo tried to salvage the game in the fourth quarter with quarterback [[Trent Edwards]] completing a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide recevier [[Josh Reed]], but Miami would close out the game with Brown's 4-yard touchdown pass.

With the loss, the Bills fell to 1â3.

The Bills, hoping to shake off a loss to the winless [[Miami|Miami Dolphins]] on the road the week before, faced the 0â4 [[Cleveland Browns]] at [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]]. The wind played a factor throughout the game, making it difficult for both teams to sustain drives in the air. The Browns and Bills traded punts in the first quarter until the Bills had a drive end at their own 47 after turning it over on downs. This stop led to the only points of the first half by the Browns, a 24 yard field goal by backup kicker [[Billy Cundiff]]. Cundiff was the starter at kicker for the Browns due to the injury to their regular kicker [[Phil Dawson]].

In the second half, the longest drive by the Bills in the game was in their opening possession, which led to a successful 36 yard field goal by Bills kicker [[Rian Lindell]] to tie the game at 3. Later in the third quarter, each quarterback threw an interception, first [[Trent Edwards]] of the Bills to cornerback [[Eric Wright (cornerback b. 1985)|Eric Wright]] of the Browns, and then [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] of the Browns to Bills' safety [[Jairus Byrd]]. Deadlocked at 3 apiece going into the fourth quarter, both offenses continued to be stifled. However, a special teams blunder by Bills punt returner [[Roscoe Parrish]] allowed the Browns to set up at the Buffalo 16 yard line after Parrish muffed the punt. From this turnover, the Browns were able to win the game on an 18 yard field goal by Cundiff with 23 seconds left to play. This loss dropped the Bills' record to 1â4, with the division rival [[New York Jets]] next up on the schedule in the [[Giants Stadium|Meadowlands]]. The Browns improved their record to 1â4. During the game, the Bills lost two defensive starters to injury who were carted off the field- linebacker [[Kawika Mitchell]] and linebacker [[Marcus Buggs]].

In this loss, the Bills earned the dubious distinction of losing to a quarterback with the worst completion percentage in NFL history in a win, the Browns Derek Anderson, who completed just 2 out of 17 passes for just 23 yards- a percentage of 11%.
