__NOTOC__
'''Louis le Brocquy''' (born 10 November 1916) is an Irish painter born in [[Dublin]]. His work has received many accolades in a career that spans seventy years of creative practice. In 1956, he represented Ireland at the [[Venice Biennale]], winning the 'Premio Acquisito Internationale'(a once-off award meaning it was acquired by the Nestle Corporation) with ''A Family'' ([[National Gallery of Ireland]]),&lt;ref&gt;Louis le Brocquy represented Ireland at the 1956 Venice Biennale alongside the sculptor Hilary Heron. His painting ''A Family'' was awarded the'' Premio Acquisito Internationale'', and was subsequently included in the exhibition ''Mostra dei Premiatialla XXVIII Biennale'', Messina, 1956.&lt;/ref&gt; subsequently included in the historic exhibition ''Fifty Years of Modern Art'' [[Brussels]], [[Expo '58|World Fair 1958]].&lt;ref&gt;The exhibition &quot;Cinquante Ans d'Art Moderne&quot; was an ambitious attempt to trace and categorise the development of painting and sculpture from CÃ©zanne and Rodin to date (World Fair, Brussels, 1958)&lt;/ref&gt; The same year he married the Irish painter [[Anne Madden]] and left London to work in the French Midi. 

Le Brocquy is widely acclaimed for his evocative &quot;Portrait âHeads&quot; of literary figures and fellow artists, which include [[William Butler Yeats]], [[James Joyce]], and his friends [[Samuel Beckett]], [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]] and [[Seamus Heaney]], in recent years le Brocquy's early &quot;Tinker&quot; subjects and Grey period &quot;Family&quot; paintings, have attracted attention on the international marketplace placing le Brocquy within a very select group of British and Irish artists whose works have commanded prices in excess of Â£1 million during their lifetimes that include [[Lucian Freud]], [[David Hockney]], [[Frank Auerbach]], and [[Francis Bacon (painter)|Francis Bacon]].&lt;ref&gt;The painting ''Tinker Woman with Newspaper'' (1947-48) set a world auction record for an Irish living artist, Sotheby's, Irish Sale, London, May 2000. The price (StgÂ£1.15m) places le Brocquy within a very select group of British and Irish artists whose works have commanded prices in excess of Â£1 million during their lifetimes. http://www.sothebys.com/app/live/dept/DepartmentGlobal.jsp?dept_id=157&lt;/ref&gt;

The artist's work is represented in numerous public collections from the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum|Guggenheim]], New York to the [[Tate Modern]], London. In Ireland, he is honoured as the first and only living painter to be included in the ''Permanent Irish Collection'' of the [[National Gallery of Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;The painting ''A Family'' was presented as a gift to the Gallery by businessman, collector, and Chair of the Board of the National Gallery of Ireland, Lochlann Quinn, in 2001, using section 1003 of the Taxes Consolidation Act on donations of objects of historical and cultural pre-eminence (1997). He had purchased it for StgÂ£1.7million. Dr. SÃ­ghle Bhreathnach-Lynch, Curator of Irish Art, National Gallery of Ireland, has observed: 'Presented as a gift in 2001 to the National Gallery, A Family is rightly recognized as a seminal painting in the history of 20th-century Irish art. It is not only an important transitional work in the artist's oeuvre but one anticipating modernism as an everyday style in Irish art. All of this is implicitly acknowledged in its being on display to the public. To date, the exception to the policy of only displaying work by dead artists in the Gallery is the continuous acquisition of portraits by contemporary artists for the National Portrait Collection. Le Brocquy is the only living artist to have a work on show as part of the permanent collection.' ''Louis le Brocquy's A Family'' : 'An unwholesome and satanic distortion of natural beauty', CIRCA Art Magazine, 2002. (Quote 'An unwholesome and satanic distortion of natural beauty', The Irish Times, letter from &quot;Verdad&quot; of Co. Dublin, 6 March 1952).&lt;/ref&gt;
