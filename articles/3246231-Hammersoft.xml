The '''Windecker YE-5A''' was an experimental [[aircraft]] evaluated by the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. It was an all-[[Composite material|composite]] construction aircraft, based on the commercial single-engine, low-wing [[Windecker Eagle]]. The YE-5A, delivered in [[1973 in aviation|1973]], was used in tests relating to the [[radar]] detectability (commonly known as '[[Stealth technology|stealth]]') of composite aircraft. The composite airframe was shown to be difficult to detect using radar; however other components, including the metal [[Piston engine|engine]], could be seen on radar. The aircraft was then transferred to the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] for use in further tests. A single YE-5A (serial number 73-1653) was built. This aircraft was destroyed in a crash during flight testing, and was replaced by a conventional civilian model Windecker Eagle. This aircraft is disassembled and in storage in the [[United States Army Aviation Museum]] at [[Fort Rucker]], [[Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaglebehindthecurtain.com/WindeckerEagle/tabid/55/Default.aspx] ''Eagle Behind the Curtain''.
