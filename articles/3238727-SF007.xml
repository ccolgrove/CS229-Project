'''Adam Internet''' is an Australian [[Internet service provider]].

==Background==

Originally founded in 1986 as the Adelaide [[Amiga]] club, Adam Internet grew out of the original [[bulletin board system]] of the Adelaide Amiga User Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=LeMay|first=Renai|title=Friday Five: Adam Internetâs Scott Hicks|url=http://delimiter.com.au/2010/02/05/friday-five-adam-internets-scott-hicks/|work=Delimiter|accessdate=30 August 2010|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bulletin board was set up in 1987 and was originally run by the user group, but was co-opted by its [[sysop]], Greg Hicks. In 1989 it transformed into a commercial multi-line [[TBBS]]-based bulletin board, which, at the time, was the largest bulletin board system in the southern hemisphere, and for many years was the most popular in Adelaide.

With 100 staff members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adam.com.au/nImages/clockingupthehours.pdf |title=Clocking up the hours. |publisher=The Advertiser, South Australia |last=Tredrea |first=Alexandra |date=2 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a customer base of 80,000+&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam Internet, Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite press |url=http://www.alvarion.com/images/stories/resourcecenter/customerstories/cs_adam%20australia_11_2009_lr.pdf |title=Adam Internet, Australia |publisher=Alvarion}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2009 Adam Internet held 35% of South Australia's Internet market.

Adam Internet provides a range of separately metered services at no extra charge,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adam.com.au/unmetered/unmetered.php&lt;/ref&gt; some of these services being operated by Adam directly, examples including: a gaming community â GamingSA, which operates a range of servers for various games; ABC iView; and file servers â FileArena, which hosts a large file repository containing (but not limited to) games, Linux distributions, streaming of local youth radio station [[Fresh FM (Australia)|Fresh 92.7]], and a [[Tucows]] mirror.
