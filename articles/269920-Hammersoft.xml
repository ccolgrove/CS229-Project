The '''Xeon''' is a brand of multiprocessing- or multi-socket-capable [[x86]] [[microprocessor]]s from [[Intel Corporation]] targeted at the non-consumer [[Server (computing)|server]], [[workstation]] and [[embedded system]] markets.
==Overview==
The ''Xeon'' brand has been maintained over several generations of x86 and [[x86-64]] processors. Older models added the ''Xeon'' moniker to the end of the name of their corresponding desktop processor, but more recent models used the name ''Xeon'' on its own. The ''Xeon'' CPUs generally have more [[cache]] than their desktop counterparts in addition to multiprocessing capabilities.

== P6-based Xeon ==
==={{Anchor|Drake}}Pentium II Xeon===
[[Image:Pentium II Xeon 450 512.jpg|thumb|right|A 450 MHz Pentium II Xeon with a 512 KB L2 cache. The cartridge cover has been removed.]]
The first Xeon-branded processor was the Pentium II Xeon (code-named &quot;'''Drake'''&quot;). It was released in 1998, replacing the [[Pentium Pro]] in Intel's server lineup. The Pentium II Xeon was a &quot;''[[Deschutes (microprocessor)|Deschutes]]''&quot; [[Pentium II]] (and shared the same product code: 80523) with a full-speed 512&amp;nbsp;KB, 1&amp;nbsp;MB, or 2&amp;nbsp;MB [[CPU cache|L2 cache]]. The L2 cache was implemented with custom 512 KB SRAMs developed by Intel. The number of SRAMs depended on the amount of cache. A 512 KB configuration required one SRAM, a 1 MB configuration: two SRAMs, and a 2 MB configuration: four SRAMs on both sides of the PCB. Each SRAM was a 12.90&amp;nbsp;mm by 17.23&amp;nbsp;mm (222.21&amp;nbsp;mmÂ²) die fabricated in a 0.35&amp;nbsp;Âµm four-layer metal CMOS process and packaged in a cavity-down wire-bonded [[land grid array]] (LGA).&lt;ref&gt;Bateman B., et al., &quot;A 450MHz 512kB Second-Level Cache with a 3.6GB/s Data Bandwidth,&quot; ISSCC Digest of Technical Papers, February 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The additional cache required a larger module and thus the Pentium II Xeon used a larger slot, [[Slot 2]]. It was supported by the [[440GX]] dual-processor workstation [[chipset]] and the [[450NX]] quad- or octo-processor chipset.

==={{Anchor|Tanner|Cascades}}Pentium III Xeon===
In [[1999]], the [[Pentium II]] Xeon was replaced by the [[Pentium III]] Xeon. Reflecting the incremental changes from the Pentium II &quot;''[[Deschutes (microprocessor)|Deschutes]]''&quot; core to the Pentium III &quot;''[[Katmai (microprocessor)|Katmai]]''&quot; core, the first Pentium III Xeon, named &quot;'''Tanner'''&quot;, was just like its predecessor except for the addition of [[Streaming SIMD Extensions]] (SSE) and a few cache controller improvements. The product codes for '''Tanner''' mirrored that of ''Katmai''; 80525.

The second version, named &quot;'''Cascades'''&quot;, was based on the Pentium III &quot;''[[Coppermine (microprocessor)|Coppermine]]''&quot; core. The &quot;'''Cascades'''&quot; Xeon used a 133&amp;nbsp;MT/s bus and relatively small 256&amp;nbsp;KB on-die L2 cache resulting in almost the same capabilities as the [[Slot 1]] ''Coppermine'' processors, which were capable of dual-processor operation but not quad-processor operation.

To improve this situation, Intel released another version, officially also named &quot;'''Cascades'''&quot;, but often referred to as &quot;'''Cascades 2&amp;nbsp;MB'''&quot;. That came in two variants: with 1&amp;nbsp;MB or 2&amp;nbsp;MB of L2 cache. Its bus speed was fixed at 100&amp;nbsp;MT/s, though in practice the cache was able to offset this. The product code for '''Cascades''' mirrored that of ''Coppermine''; 80526.

== Netburst-based Xeon ==
=== Xeon (DP) &amp; Xeon MP (32-bit)===
====Foster====
{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Foster&quot; (180 nm)]]}}
{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Foster MP&quot; (180 nm)]]}}
In mid-2001, the Xeon brand was introduced (&quot;Pentium&quot; was dropped from the name). The initial variant that used the new [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst microarchitecture]], &quot;'''Foster'''&quot;, was slightly different from the desktop [[Pentium 4]] (&quot;''[[Pentium 4#Willamette|Willamette]]''&quot;). It was a decent chip for workstations, but for server applications it was almost always outperformed by the older Cascades cores with a 2 MB L2 cache and AMD's [[Athlon|Athlon MP]]. Combined with the need to use expensive [[RDRAM|Rambus Dynamic RAM]], the Foster's sales were somewhat unimpressive.

At most two Foster processors could be accommodated in a symmetric multiprocessing ([[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]]) system built with a mainstream chipset, so a second version ('''Foster MP''') was introduced with a 1&amp;nbsp;MB L3 cache and the Jackson [[Hyper-threading|Hyper-Threading]] capacity. This improved performance slightly, but not enough to lift it out of third place. It was also priced much higher than the dual-processor (DP) versions. The ''Foster'' shared the 80528 product code with Willamette.

====Prestonia====
{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Prestonia&quot; (130 nm)]]}}
In 2002 Intel released a [[130 nanometer|130&amp;nbsp;nm]] version of Xeon branded CPU, codenamed &quot;'''Prestonia'''&quot;.  It supported Intel's new Hyper-Threading technology and had a 512&amp;nbsp;KB L2 cache. This was based on the &quot;''[[Pentium 4#Northwood|Northwood]]''&quot; Pentium 4 core. A new server chipset, [[Intel_Xeon_chipsets#NetBurst-based Xeon chipsets|E7500]] (which allowed the use of dual-channel [[DDR SDRAM]]), was released to support this processor in servers, and soon the bus speed was boosted to 533&amp;nbsp;MT/s (accompanied by new chipsets: the E7501 for servers and the E7505 for workstations). The ''Prestonia'' performed much better than its predecessor and noticeably better than Athlon MP. The support of new features in the E75xx series also gave it a key advantage over the Pentium III Xeon and Athlon MP branded CPUs (both stuck with rather old chipsets), and it quickly became the top-selling server/workstation processor.

Subsequent to the ''Prestonia'' was the &quot;'''Gallatin'''&quot;, which had an L3 cache of 1&amp;nbsp;MB or 2&amp;nbsp;MB. Its Xeon MP version also performed much better than the ''Foster MP'', and was popular in servers. Later experience with the 130&amp;nbsp;nm process allowed Intel to create the Xeon MP branded ''Gallatin'' with 4&amp;nbsp;MB cache. The Xeon branded ''Prestonia'' and ''Gallatin'' were designated 80532, like Northwood.

{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Irwindale&quot; (90_nm)]]}}

Due to a lack of success with Intel's [[Itanium]] and Itanium 2 processors, AMD was able to introduce [[x86-64]], a 64-bit extension to the [[x86 architecture]].  Intel followed suit by including [[Intel 64]] (formerly EM64T; it is almost identical to [[AMD64]]) in
the [[90 nanometer|90&amp;nbsp;nm]] version of the Pentium 4 (&quot;''[[Pentium 4#Prescott|Prescott]]''&quot;), and a Xeon version codenamed &quot;'''Nocona'''&quot; with 1 MB L2 cache was released in 2004. Released with it were the E7525 (workstation), E7520 and E7320 (both server) chipsets, which added support for [[PCI Express]], [[DDR2 SDRAM|DDR-II]] and [[Serial ATA]]. The Xeon was noticeably slower than AMD's Opteron, although it could be faster in situations where Hyper-Threading came into play.

A slightly updated core called &quot;'''Irwindale'''&quot; was released in early 2005, with 2 MB L2 cache and the ability to have its clock speed reduced during low processor demand. Although it was a bit more competitive than the ''Nocona'' had been, independent [http://www.anandtech.com/cpuchipsets/showdoc.aspx?i=2591 tests] showed that AMD's Opteron still outperformed ''Irwindale''. Both of these Prescott-derived Xeons have the product code 80546.

==== Cranford and Potomac ====

{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Potomac&quot; (90 nm)]]}}

64-bit Xeon MPs were introduced in April 2005. The cheaper &quot;'''Cranford'''&quot; was an MP version of ''Nocona'', while the more expensive &quot;'''Potomac'''&quot; was a ''Cranford'' with 8&amp;nbsp;MB of L3 cache. Like Nocona and Irwindale, they also have product code 80546.

The first [[Multi-core (computing)|dual-core]] CPU branded Xeon, codenamed '''Paxville DP''', product code 80551, was released by Intel on 10 October 2005. Paxville DP had [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst microarchitecture]], and was a dual-core equivalent of the single-core [[#Nocona and Irwindale|Irwindale]] (related to the [[Pentium D]] branded &quot;''[[Pentium D#Smithfield|Smithfield&quot;]]''&quot;) with 4&amp;nbsp;MB of L2 Cache (2&amp;nbsp;MB per core). The only Paxville DP model released ran at 2.8&amp;nbsp;GHz, featured an 800&amp;nbsp;MT/s front side bus, and was produced using a [[90 nanometer|90&amp;nbsp;nm process]].

====7000-series &quot;Paxville MP&quot;====

{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Paxville MP&quot; (90 nm)]]}}

An MP-capable version of Paxville DP, codenamed '''Paxville MP''', product code 80560, was released on 1 November 2005. There are two versions: one with 2&amp;nbsp;MB of L2 Cache (1&amp;nbsp;MB per core), and one with 4&amp;nbsp;MB of L2 (2&amp;nbsp;MB per core). Paxville MP, called the dual-core Xeon 7000-series, was produced using a 90&amp;nbsp;nm process. Paxville MP clock ranges between 2.67&amp;nbsp;GHz and 3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz (model numbers 7020-7041), with some models having a 667&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB, and others having an 800&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB.

On 23 May 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5000 series) codenamed '''Dempsey''' (product code 80555). Released as the Dual-Core Xeon 5000-series, Dempsey is a [[NetBurst (microarchitecture)|NetBurst microarchitecture]] processor produced using a [[65 nanometer|65&amp;nbsp;nm process]], and is virtually identical to Intel's &quot;[[Pentium D#Presler|Presler]]&quot; [[Pentium Extreme Edition]], except for the addition of SMP support, which lets Dempsey operate in dual-processor systems. Dempsey ranges between 2.50&amp;nbsp;GHz and 3.73&amp;nbsp;GHz (model numbers 5020-5080). Some models have a 667&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB, and others have a 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB. Dempsey has 4&amp;nbsp;MB of L2 Cache (2&amp;nbsp;MB per core). A Medium Voltage model, at 3.2&amp;nbsp;GHz and 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB (model number 5063), has also been released. Dempsey also introduces a new interface for Xeon processors: [[LGA 771]], also known as '''Socket J'''. Dempsey was the first Xeon core in a long time to be somewhat competitive with its Opteron-based counterparts, although it could not claim a decisive lead in any performance metric - that would have to wait for its successor, the Woodcrest.

On 14 March 2006, Intel released a dual-core processor codenamed '''Sossaman''' and branded as ''Xeon'' LV (low-voltage).  Subsequently an ULV (ultra-low-voltage) version was released. The ''Sossaman'' was a low-/ultra-low-power and double-processor capable CPU (like [[AMD Quad FX platform|AMD Quad FX]]), based on the &quot;''[[Yonah (microprocessor)|Yonah]]''&quot; processor, for ultradense non-consumer environment (i.e. targeted at the blade-server and embedded markets), and was rated at a [[Thermal Design Power|thermal design power]] (TDP) of 31 [[watt|W]] (LV: 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz, 2&amp;nbsp;GHz and 2.16&amp;nbsp;GHz) and 15 W (ULV: 1.66&amp;nbsp;GHz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Intel drops 32-bit dual-core LV processors |url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/33150/135/ |publisher=TG Daily |accessdate=2007-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it supported most of the same features as earlier Xeons: Virtualization Technology, 667&amp;nbsp;MT/s front side bus, and dual-core processing, but did not support 64-bit operations, so could not run 64-bit server software, such as [[Microsoft Exchange Server#Exchange Server 2007|Microsoft Exchange Server 2007]], and therefore was limited to 16&amp;nbsp;GB of memory.  A planned successor, codenamed &quot;''[[Merom (microprocessor)|Merom]] MP''&quot; was to be a drop-in upgrade to enable ''Sossaman''-based servers to upgrade to 64-bit capability. However, this was abandoned in favour of low-voltage versions of the ''[[Xeon#5100-series &quot;Woodcrest&quot;|Woodcrest LV]]'' processor leaving the ''Sossaman'' at a dead-end with no upgrade path.

On 26 June 2006, Intel released the dual-core CPU (Xeon branded 5100 series) codenamed '''Woodcrest''' (product code 80556); it was the first Intel [[Core (microarchitecture)|Core microarchitecture]] processor to be launched on the market. It is a server and workstation version of the [[Intel Core 2]] processor.  Intel claims that it provides an 80% boost in performance, while reducing power consumption by 20% relative to the Pentium D.

Most models have a 1333&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB, except for the 5110 and 5120, which have a 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB.  The fastest processor (5160) operates at 3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz. All Woodcrests use [[LGA 771]] and all except two models have a TDP of 65&amp;nbsp;W. The 5160 has a TDP of 80&amp;nbsp;W and the 5148LV (2.33&amp;nbsp;GHz) has a TDP of 40&amp;nbsp;W.  The previous generation Xeons had a TDP of 130&amp;nbsp;W.  All models support Intel 64 (Intel's x86-64 implementation), the [[NX bit|XD bit]], and [[x86 virtualization|Virtualization Technology]], with the &quot;[[Demand Based Switching]]&quot; power management option only on Dual-Core Xeon 5140 or above. Woodcrest has 4&amp;nbsp;MB of shared L2 Cache.

It comprised two separate dual-core dies next to each other in one CPU package and manufactured '''in a [[45 nanometer|45&amp;nbsp;nm process]]'''. The models are the X3320, X3350, X3360 and X3370, running at 2.50&amp;nbsp;GHz, 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz, 2.83&amp;nbsp;GHz and 3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz, respectively. The L2 cache is a unified 6&amp;nbsp;MB per die (except for the X3320 with a smaller 3&amp;nbsp;MB L2 cache per die), and a front-side bus of 1333&amp;nbsp;MHz. All models feature Intel 64 (Intel's x86-64 implementation), the [[NX bit|XD bit]], and [[x86 virtualization|Virtualization Technology]], as well as &quot;Demand Based Switching&quot;.

The [[Yorkfield (microprocessor)#Yorkfield CL|Yorkfield-CL]] (product code 80584) variant of these processors are X3323, X3353 and X3363, a reduced TDP of 80W and are made for single-CPU [[LGA 771]] systems instead of [[LGA 775]], which is used in all other Yorkfield processors. Otherwise they are identical to their Yorkfield counterparts.

{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Clovertown&quot; (65 nm)]]}}

A quad-core (2x2) successor of the Woodcrest for DP segment, consisting of two dual-core Woodcrest chips in one package similarly to the dual-core Pentium D branded CPUs (two single-core chips) or the quad-core [[Kentsfield (microprocessor)|Kentsfield]].  All Clovertowns use the [[LGA 771]] package. The Clovertown has been usually implemented with two Woodcrest dies on a [[Multi-Chip Module|multi-chip module]], with 8&amp;nbsp;MB of L2 cache (4&amp;nbsp;MB per die). Like Woodcrest, lower models use a 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB, and higher models use a 1333&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB. Intel released '''Clovertown''', product code 80563, on 14 November 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20061114comp.htm Intel Ignites Quad-Core Era], Intel News Release.&lt;/ref&gt; with models E5310, E5320, E5335, E5345, and X5355, ranging from 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz to 2.66&amp;nbsp;GHz. All models support: MMX, SSE, SSE2, SSE3, SSSE3, Intel 64, XD bit (an NX bit implementation), Intel VT. The E and X designations are borrowed from Intel's Core 2 model numbering scheme; an ending of -0 implies a 1066&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB, and an ending of -5 implies a 1333&amp;nbsp;MT/s FSB.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailytech_quad-xeon&quot;/&gt; All models have a TDP of 80&amp;nbsp;W with the exception of the X5355, which has a TDP of 120&amp;nbsp;W. A low-voltage version of Clovertown with a TDP of 50&amp;nbsp;W has a model numbers L5310, L5320 and L5335 (1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz, 1.86&amp;nbsp;GHz and 2.0&amp;nbsp;GHz respectively). The 3.0&amp;nbsp;GHz X5365 arrived in July 2007, and became available in the [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Mac Pro]] [http://www.apple.com/macpro] on 4 April 2007.[http://tgdaily.com/2006/09/26/intel_core_2_quad_announcement/]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/Intel+Readies+New+Xeons+and+Price+Cuts/article6493.htm Intel Readies New Xeons and Price Cuts], DailyTech&lt;/ref&gt; The X5365 performs up to around 38&amp;nbsp;[[GFLOPS]] in the LINPACK benchmark.

On 11 November 2007 Intel presented [[Yorkfield (microprocessor)|Yorkfield]]-based Xeons - called Harpertown (product code 80574) - to the public.[http://download.intel.com/design/xeon/datashts/318589.pdf] This family consists of dual die quad-core CPUs manufactured on a [[45 nanometer|45&amp;nbsp;nm process]] and featuring 1333&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz front-side buses, with TDP rated from 50&amp;nbsp;W to 150&amp;nbsp;W depending on the model. These processors fit in the [[LGA 771]] package. All models feature Intel 64 (Intel's x86-64 implementation), the [[NX bit|XD bit]], and [[x86 virtualization|Virtualization Technology]].  All except the E5405 also feature [[Demand Based Switching]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ark.intel.com/cpu.aspx?groupID=33079 Quad-Core Intel Xeon Processor E5405], Intel ARK (Automated Relational Knowledgebase)&lt;/ref&gt;
The supplementary character in front of the model-number represents the thermal rating: an L depicts a TDP of 50&amp;nbsp;W, an E depicts 80&amp;nbsp;W whereas an X is 120&amp;nbsp;W TDP or above. The speed of 3.00&amp;nbsp;GHz comes as four models, two models with 80&amp;nbsp;W TDP two other models with 120&amp;nbsp;W TDP with 1333&amp;nbsp;MHz or 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz front-side bus respectively. The fastest Harpertown is the X5492 whose TDP of 150&amp;nbsp;W is higher than those of the Prescott-based Xeon DP but having twice as many cores. (The X5482 is also sold under the name &quot;Core 2 Extreme QX9775&quot; for use in the [[Intel SkullTrail]] system.)

Intel 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz front-side bus Xeon processors will drop into the Seaburg chipset whereas several mainboards featuring the Intel 5000/5200-chipset are enabled to run the processors with 1333&amp;nbsp;MHz front-side bus processors. Seaburg features support for dual {{nowrap|PCIe 2.0 x16}} slots and up to 128&amp;nbsp;GB of memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytech.com/Intel+Readies+1600+MHz+FrontSide+Bus+Xeons/article8656.htm Intel Readies 1600&amp;nbsp;MHz Front-Side Bus Xeons], DailyTech&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trustedreviews.com/cpu-memory/news/2007/08/30/Intel-Xeons-Coming-With-1600MHz-FSB/p1 Intel Xeons Coming With 1600MHz FSB], TrustedReviews&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7300 series, codenamed '''Tigerton''' (product code 80565) is a four-socket (packaged in [[Socket 604]]) and more capable [[quad-core processor]], consisting of two [[dual core]] Core2 architecture silicon chips on a single ceramic module, similar to Intel's Xeon 5300 series Clovertown processor modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Intel Launches First Industry-Standard Quad-Core Products for High-End, Multi-Processor Servers |date={{Start date|2007|09|05}} |publisher=[[Intel Corporation]] |url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/2007/20070905comp.htm |accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 7300 series uses Intel's Caneland (Clarksboro) platform.

Intel claims the 7300 series Xeons offer more than twice the performance and more than three times the performance per watt as Intel's previous generation 7100 series. The 7300 series' Caneland chipset provides a point to point interface allowing the full front side bus bandwidth per processor.

The 7xxx series is aimed at the large server market, supporting configurations of up to 32&amp;nbsp;CPUs per host.

Xeon 3400-series processors based on '''Lynnfield''' fill the gap between the previous 3300-series &quot;Yorkfield&quot; processors and the newer 3500-series &quot;Bloomfield&quot;. Like Bloomfield, they are quad-core single-package processors based on the [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem microarchitecture]], but were introduced almost a year later, in September 2009. The same processors are marketed for mid-range to high-end desktops systems as [[Core i5]] and [[Core i7]]. They have two integrated memory channels as well as [[PCI Express]] and [[Direct Media Interface]] links, but no [[QuickPath]] Interface.

{{main|Clarkdale (microprocessor)}}
{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Clarkdale&quot; (32 nm)]]}}

At low end of the 3400-series is not a Lynnfield but a '''Clarkdale''' processor, which is also used in the Core i3-500 and Core i5-600 processors as well as the Celeron G1000 and G6000 Pentium series. A single model was released in March 2010, the Xeon L3406. Compared to all other Clarkdale-based products, this one does not support integrated graphics, but has a much lower thermal design power of just 30 W. Compared to the Lynnfield-based Xeon 3400 models, it only offers two cores.

{{main|Bloomfield (microprocessor)}}
{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Bloomfield&quot; (45 nm)]]}}

'''Bloomfield''' is the codename for the successor to the Xeon Core microarchitecture, is based on the [[Nehalem (microarchitecture)|Nehalem microarchitecture]] and uses the same [[45 nanometer|45&amp;nbsp;nm]] manufacturing methods as Intel's [[Penryn (microprocessor)|Penryn]]. The first processor released with the Nehalem architecture is the desktop [[Intel Core i7]], which was released in November 2008. This is the server version for single CPU systems.
This is a '''single-socket''' Intel Xeon processor.
The performance improvements over previous Xeon processors are based mainly on:
* Integrated [[memory controller]] supporting 3 Memory Channels of [[DDR3]] UDIMM (Unbuffered) or RDIMM (Registered)
* A new point-to-point processor interconnect ''[[QuickPath]]'', replacing the legacy front side bus
* Simultaneous multithreading by multiple cores and [[hyper-threading]] (2x per core).

The first processor released with the Nehalem microarchitecture is the desktop [[Intel Core i7]], which was released in November 2008. Server processors of the Xeon 55xx range were first supplied to testers in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/weblog/showpost.aspx?i=532 AnandTech: Intel Xeon 5570: Smashing SAP records], December 16th, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance improvements over previous Xeon processors are based mainly on:
* Integrated [[memory controller]] supporting three memory channels of [[DDR3]] SDRAM.
* A new point-to-point processor interconnect ''[[QuickPath]]'', replacing the legacy front side bus. Gainestown has two QuickPath interfaces.
* [[Hyper-threading]] (2x per core, starting from 5518), that was already present in pre-Core Duo processors.

'''Jasper Forest''' is a Nehalem-based embedded processor with [[PCI Express]] connections on-die, core counts from 1 to 4 cores and power envelopes from 23 to 85 watts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/08/idf_beijing_2009/ Intel demos Moorestown, embeds Nehalem]&lt;/ref&gt;

The uni-processor version without QPI comes as LC35xx and EC35xx, while the dual-processor version is sold as LC55xx and EC55xx and uses QPI for communication between the processors. Both versions use a DMI link to communicate with the 3420 that is also used in the 3400-series Lynfield Xeon processors, but use an [[LGA 1366]] package that is otherwise used for processors with QPI but no DMI or PCI Express links. The CPUID code of both Lynnfield and Jasper forest is 106Ex, i.e. family 6, model 30.

The [[Celeron]] P1053 belongs into the same family as the LC35xx series, but lacks some [[Reliability, Availability and Serviceability|RAS]] features that are present in the Xeon version.

Gulftown or '''Westmere-EP''', a six-core 32&amp;nbsp;nm [[Westmere (microarchitecture)|Westmere]]-based processor, is the basis for the Xeon 36xx and 56xx series and the [[Intel Core#Core i7|Core i7]]-980X. It launched in the first quarter of 2010. The 36xx-series follows the 35xx-series Bloomfield uni-processor model while the 56xx-series follows the 55xx-series Gainestown dual-processor model and both are socket compatible to their predecessors.

Beckton or '''Nehalem-EX''' (EXpandable server market) is a Nehalem-based processor with up to eight cores and uses buffering inside the chipset to support up to 16 standard DDR3 DIMMS per CPU socket without requiring the use of FB-DIMMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://anandtech.com/weblog/showpost.aspx?i=603
|title=Nehalem-EX: 2.3 billion transistors, eight cores, one die}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike all previous Xeon MP processors, Nehalem-EX uses the new [[LGA 1567]] package, replacing the [[Socket 604]] used in the previous models, up to Xeon [[#7400-series &quot;Dunnington&quot;|7400 &quot;Dunnington&quot;]]. The 75xx models have four QuickPath interfaces, so it can be used in up-to eight-socket configurations, while the 65xx models are only for up to two sockets. Designed by the Digital Enterprise Group (DEG) Santa Clara and Hudson Design Teams, Beckton is manufactured on the P1266 (45&amp;nbsp;nm) technology. Its launch in March 2010 coincided with that of its direct competitor, AMD's [[Opteron]] 6xxx &quot;Magny-Cours&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/opinion/976/1050976/intel-bunch-fun-cpus-moves-2010 Intel's next bunch of fun CPUs moves to 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Most models limit the number of cores and QPI links as well as the L3 Cache size in order to get a broader range of products out of the single chip design.

==={{Anchor|Westmere-EX}}E7-x8xx-series &quot;Westmere-EX&quot;===
{{dablink|List: [[List of Intel Xeon microprocessors#&quot;Westmere-EX&quot; (32 nm)]]}}

Westmere-EX is the follow-on to Beckton/Nehalem-EX and the first Intel Chip to have ten CPU cores. The microarchitecture is the same as in the six-core Gulftown/Westmere-EP processor, but it uses the [[LGA 1567]] package like Beckton to support up to eight sockets.

Starting with Westmere-EX, the naming scheme has changes once again, with &quot;E7-xxxx&quot; now signifying the high-end line of Xeon processors using a package that supports larger than two-CPU configurations, formerly the 7xxx series. Similarly, the 3xxx uniprocessor and 5xxx dual-processor series turned into E3-xxxx and E5-xxxx, respectively, for later processors.
