'''Mountain Dew MDX''' was an [[energy drink]] manufactured and distributed by [[PepsiCo]] under the [[Mountain Dew]] brand. It was introduced in 2005 as PepsiCo's second attempt to market an energy soda. [[Josta]], the first [[energy drink]] introduced by a major soft drink company from 1995 to 1999.  &quot;Power Pack&quot; is the marketing term given to the energy ingredients blend in MDX. In June 2005, [[Coca-Cola]] started to test-market [[Vault (soft drink)|Vault]] as an Energy Drink/Soda. Pepsi saw that this was selling well, so Pepsi quickly released their own version before [[Vault (soft drink)|Vault]] hit stores nationally. 

MDX was initially sold in 14 oz. bottles, and was pricier than other Pepsi soft drinks.  Due to slow sales, it was relaunched in the fall of 2006 in 20 oz. bottles, and was marketed alongside other Pepsi soft drinks at the same price.  The sugar free version had however been discontinued. Despite technically being discontinued, Mountain Dew MDX is still sold in some markets {{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}, although it is not as easily found as it previously was.
