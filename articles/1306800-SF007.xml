'''GetRight''' is a [[shareware]] [[download manager]] developed by Headlight Software.

==Features==
GetRight is able to pause and resume downloads, download from multiple servers to speed up download time (&quot;segmented downloading&quot;), scheduling the starting and stopping of downloads and shutting off the computer or disconnecting the modem when the downloads have finished. It is also able to integrate with Microsoft's [[Internet Explorer]], and [[Mozilla Firefox]] with the [[FlashGot]] extension.
It features support for the [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] protocol, [[Metalink]], and [[podcast]] support, along with built-in verification [[MD5]] and [[SHA-1]] checksums.

==Releases==
Version 6 is available in two license modes: Standard and Pro. &quot;Standard&quot; is the continuation of previous versions, while &quot;Pro&quot; contains new features like: upload capability, using scripts for programming its tasks, a simple web server (called &quot;Web Access&quot;), ability to act as a proxy server or work in a Client/Server mode when using two or more computers in a network.
