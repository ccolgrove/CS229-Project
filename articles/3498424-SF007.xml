The '''Tango Desktop Project''' is an [[Open-source software|open-source]] initiative to create a set of design guidelines and to provide a consistent [[user experience]] for applications on [[desktop environment]]s. The project has created a set of [[computer icon|icon]]s known as the Tango Icon Library, which is described as a &quot;proof of concept&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Library |accessdate=2011-06-15 |title=Tango Icon Library - Tango Desktop Project |date=2010-08-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tango Desktop Project is a project of [[freedesktop.org]], and is closely linked with other freedesktop.org guidelines such as the [http://freedesktop.org/wiki/Specifications/icon-theme-spec Standard Icon Theming Specification].

== Objectives ==

The key objective of the project is to allow developers to easily integrate their software (in terms of appearance) with the desktop. The visual inconsistencies that arise from different [[Freedesktop.org|desktop]] environments ([[KDE]], [[GNOME]], [[Xfce]]...) and custom distributions make it hard for third parties to target [[Linux]]. Ideally, any project that follows the Tango guidelines will have a [[look and feel]] that matches well with other icons and applications that follow the guidelines.

The style does not aim to be visually unique to distinguish itself. Instead, a secondary aim of the project is a style that makes applications look appropriate running on operating systems common at that time, such that [[Independent software vendor|ISV]]s will find that their application does not look out of place on [[Windows XP]], [[Mac OS X]], [[KDE]], [[GNOME]], or [[Xfce]].

Apart from the visual guidelines, the project aims to provide a set of common metaphors for the icons. Tango follows the Freedesktop.org's [[Standard Icon Theming Specification]] and actively develops the [[Freedesktop.org]]'s [[Standard Icon Naming Specification]], defining names for the most common icons and the used metaphors.

Many free software projects, such as [[GIMP]], [[Scribus]], and [[GNOME]], have started to follow the Tango style guidelines for their icons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Showroom Tango Showroom - Tango Desktop Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, [[Mozilla Firefox 3]] uses Tango icons when it is unable to find the user's installed iconset, and also for icons not covered by said iconset.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title = A first look at the Firefox 3 visual refresh for Linux | url = http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2007/11/13/update-on-the-firefox-3-linux-theme/ | date=2007-11-13 | accessdate=2008-07-11 | first = Alex | last = Faaborg }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also possible for proprietary closed source applications to use Tango Desktop Project icons. Examples highlighted by the Tango Showroom include VMware Workstation 6 and Medsphere OpenVista CIS.

== History ==

In 2009, the original  Tango icons were released into the [[public domain]] in order to make their implementation easier, due to the [[copyleft]] aspects of the [[Creative Commons]] [[Creative Commons licenses|license]] (Attribution-ShareAlike) they were previously released under.

== Palette ==

This is the [[hexadecimal]] color [[Palette (computing)|palette]] used by the Tango Desktop Project, organized by color group and brightness:&lt;ref&gt;[http://tango.freedesktop.org/Tango_Icon_Theme_Guidelines#Color Tango Icon Theme Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;
