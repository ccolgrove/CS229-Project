'''Dropbox''' is a [[Web application|Web-based]] [[file hosting service]] operated by ''Dropbox, Inc.'' that uses [[cloud storage]] to enable [[User (computing)|users]] to store and share files and folders with others across the Internet using [[file synchronization]]. It was founded in 2007 by [[MIT]] graduates [[Drew Houston]] and [[Arash Ferdowsi]] as a [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]] [[Startup company|startup]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web

There are both free and paid services, each with varying options.&lt;ref name=&quot;pricing&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url         =https://www.dropbox.com/pricing | title       =Official Dropbox Pricing Page | accessdate  =April 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison to similar services, Dropbox offers a relatively large number of user clients across a variety of desktop and mobile operating systems. There are a number of versions across many [[Operating System|operating systems]], including versions for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Linux]] (official and [[Dropbox_(service)#External_links|unofficial]]),&lt;ref&gt;Official clients include 32- and 64-bit builds, and unofficial include the open source KDropbox, for the KDE desktop environment.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as versions for mobile devices, such as [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Windows Phone 7]], [[iPhone]], [[iPad]] and [[BlackBerry OS|BlackBerry]], and a web-based client for when no local client is installed. Dropbox uses the [[freemium]] financial model and its free service provides 2&amp;nbsp;[[Gigabyte|GB]] of free online storage. Users who refer Dropbox to others can gain up to 8 GB of additional free storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =https://www.dropbox.com/help/54 | title       =How do I earn bonus space for referring friends to Dropbox? | work=The Dropbox Blog | accessdate  =March 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service's major competitors include [[Box.net]], [[FilesAnywhere]], [[CloudMe]], [[CrashPlan]], [[Egnyte]], [[iCloud]], [[Mozy]], [[SpiderOak]], [[SugarSync]], [[TitanFile]], [[Ubuntu One]], [[Windows Live SkyDrive]], [[Wuala]] and [[ZumoDrive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://lifehacker.com/5064688/free-online-storage-feature+by+feature-comparison-chart | title       =Free Online Storage Feature-by-Feature Comparison Chart | first       =Kevin | last        =Purdy | date        =October 17, 2008 | publisher=[[Lifehacker]] | accessdate  =April 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ars_boxnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2009/02/boxnet-takes-online-file-storage-collaborative-social.ars | title       =Box.net takes online file storage collaborative, social | first       =David | last        =Chartier | date        =February 5, 2009 | publisher=[[Ars Technica]] | accessdate  =April 22, 2010 | quote       =As a quick primer, Box.net is fundamentally similar to Dropbox, Windows Live SkyDrive, Apple's iDisk, and a wealth of online file storage competitors.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
According to Dropbox, founder [[Drew Houston]] conceived the idea after repeatedly forgetting his [[USB flash drive|USB drive]] while he was a student at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]. He says that existing services at the time &quot;suffered problems with Internet latency, large files, bugs, or just made me think too much.&quot; He began making something for himself, but then realized that it could benefit others with the same problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=23 | title       =Meet the Team! (Part 1) | first       =Jon | last        =Ying | date        =February 5, 2009 | work=The Dropbox Blog | publisher=Dropbox, Inc. | accessdate  =April 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drew Houston|Houston]] founded Dropbox, Inc. in 2007, and shortly thereafter secured seed funding from [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]].&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt; Dropbox officially launched at 2008's [[TechCrunch50]], an annual technology conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;domain&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://techcrunch.com/2009/10/13/dropbox-acquires-the-domain-everyone-thought-it-had-dropbox-com | title       =Dropbox Acquires The Domain Everyone Thought It Had: Dropbox.com | first       =Jason | last        =Kincaid | date        =October 13, 2009 | publisher=[[TechCrunch]] | accessdate  =April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to trademark disputes between Evenflow (Dropbox's parent company) and Proxy, Inc., Dropbox's official [[domain name]] was actually &quot;'''get'''dropbox.com&quot; until October 2009, when they acquired their current domain, &quot;dropbox.com&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;domain&quot;/&gt;

[[OPSWAT Inc.|OPSWAT]] reported in their December 2010 Market Share report that Dropbox held 10.41% of the worldwide Backup Client market, based on number of installations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oesisok.com/news-resources/reports/q4-2010-antivirus-backup-client-and-windows-os-reports|title=OPSWAT's December 2010 Market Share Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, Dropbox struck deals with Japanese mobile service providers [[Softbank]] and [[Sony Ericsson]]. As per the terms of the deal Dropbox will come preloaded on their mobile phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levy|first=Ari|title=Dropbox Partners With Softbank, Sony Ericsson for Growth in Asia, Europe|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-05-30/dropbox-partners-with-softbank-sony-ericsson-for-global-growth.html|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{As of|April 2011}}, Dropbox has more than 25 million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kim|first=Ryan|title=Why Dropboxâs 25 Million Users Are Just the Start|url=http://gigaom.com/2011/04/18/why-dropboxs-25-million-users-are-just-the-start/|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2011-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010 Dropbox users in [[People's Republic of China|China]] were unable to access Dropbox. Later, Dropbox confirmed they had been [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|blocked by China]]. Due to the fact that the censorship usually focuses on popular services only, many considered this evidence of Dropbox's rapidly rising popularity and international user base. Up to Nov 2011, the website is still blocked in China, but locally installed applications are usable with some [[Internet_service_provider|ISPs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://stuff.techwhack.com/8815-dropbox-4 | title = dropbox banned | publisher=techwhack | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.neowin.net/news/china-blocks-dropbox-cloud-storage-service | title = dropbox blocked | publisher=neowin | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.geek.com/articles/news/china-has-blocked-dropbox-20100511/ | title = dropbox blocked | publisher=geek.com | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://shanghaiist.com/2010/05/11/another_one_bites_the_dust_file-sha.php | title = dropbox blocked | publisher=shanghaiist | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mingtiandi.com/entrepreneurship/20100511/idiot-proofing-dropbox-and-the-gfw/ | title = dropbox blocked in china | publisher=mingtiandi | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financials ==
Dropbox has received a total venture capital funding of $7.2&amp;nbsp;million from several investors, including [[Y Combinator (company)|Y Combinator]], [[Sequoia Capital]] and [[Accel Partners]].&lt;ref name=crunchbase&gt;{{cite web|title=Dropbox|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/company/dropbox|publisher=[[CrunchBase]]|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to speculation, Dropbox's valuation is more than $1&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.fortune.cnn.com/2011/03/16/cloud-computing-for-the-rest-of-us/ cnn.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[TechCrunch]], [[VentureBeat]], [[Business Insider]] and [[Financial Post]] have also speculated that Dropbox's valuation could be as high as $5 to $10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lacy|first=Sarah|title=Dropbox Raising Massive Round at a $5B-Plus Valuation|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/07/12/dropbox-raising-massive-round-at-a-5b-plus-valuation/|publisher=[[TechCrunch]]|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2011-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dropbox's annual revenue is expected to reach $240 million in 2011.&lt;ref name='forbesinsidestory' /&gt;

Dropbox is based in San Francisco, and is funded by [[Sequoia Capital]], [[Accel Partners]], and Amidzad.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;/&gt;   Starting in mid-2009, they began releasing new features gradually to help measure customer interest, a [[Lean Startup]] technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://online.wsj.com/article/NA_WSJ_PUB:SB10001424052748704635204575242543105830072.html | title = Philosophy Helps Start-Ups Move Faster | first = Pui-Wing | last = Tam | date = May 20, 2010 |work=Wall Street Journal | accessdate =September 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business model ==
Dropbox operates on the [[Freemium]] financial model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gannes|first=Liz|title=Case Studies in Freemium: Pandora, Dropbox, Evernote, Automattic and MailChimp|url=http://gigaom.com/2010/03/26/case-studies-in-freemium-pandora-dropbox-evernote-automattic-and-mailchimp/|publisher=[[GigaOm]]|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dropbox offers a free account of 2 GB and a paid account of 50 GB, 100 GB, and a team account of 1 TB or more. The free account and the paid account are identical in all aspects except for the amount of storage space offered. Providing the free account to users costs a lot of money to Dropbox but nevertheless Dropbox continues to provide the free accounts because it benefits Dropbox in several ways. [[Drew Houston]], the CEO of Dropbox has pointed out that:

: &quot;''Most of our growth is word of mouth/viral, so free users are still valuable: we grow faster, and they refer people who might pay''&quot;

: &quot;''Picking the right duration is tricky, and people add files to their Dropboxes at different rates. Many pay eventually after using the free service for a long time.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why did Dropbox decide to go with a free plan instead of a limited-time trial?|url=http://www.quora.com/Dropbox/Why-did-Dropbox-decide-to-go-with-a-free-plan-instead-of-a-limited-time-trial|publisher=[[Quora]]|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2011, [[Forbes]] published that Dropbox has 50 million users, of which 96% are using a free account.&lt;ref name='forbesinsidestory'&gt;{{cite web|last=Barret|first=Victoria|title=Dropbox: The Inside Story Of Tech's Hottest Startup|url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/victoriabarret/2011/10/18/dropbox-the-inside-story-of-techs-hottest-startup/|work=Forbes|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=18 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For a brief period of time, Dropbox operated an affiliate program whereby third parties which referred customers to Dropbox would get a small cut out of Dropbox's revenue. But this affiliate program was shut down indefinitely on November 5, 2009 because it was not providing good returns. Dropbox provided the following official explanation:

: &quot;''We believe that our efforts as a company are better spent improving the Dropbox product for our customers and delivering the features that they have been asking for.''&quot;

: &quot;''Because we are a small company, we have to be very selective about which projects we work on, and the affiliate program didn't seem like a wise use of our resources.''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official Dropbox Affiliates Page|url=https://www.dropbox.com/affiliates|publisher=Dropbox|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
Both the Dropbox server and desktop client software are primarily written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. The desktop client uses GUI toolkits such as [[wxWidgets]] and [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]]. Other notable Python libraries include Twisted, ctypes, and pywin32. The software does not use any third-party file sync or version control libraries and was built from scratch.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PyCon 2011: How Dropbox Did It and How Python Helped|url=http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-how-dropbox-did-it-and-how-python-helped-4896698|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dropbox client enables users to drop any file into a designated folder that is then synced with Dropbox's Internet service and to any other of the user's computers and devices with the Dropbox client.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ryan Paul | title = How Dropbox ended my search for seamless sync on Linux | publisher=Ars Technica | url = http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080914-how-dropbox-ended-my-search-for-seamless-sync-on-linux.html | accessdate =September 24, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users may also upload files manually through a web browser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Scott Dunn | title = Dropbox File Sync Service | publisher=PC World | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/149058/dropbox_file_sync_service.html | accessdate =September 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through these usages, it can be an alternative to [[sneakernet]] (physical transportation of removable media), and other traditional forms of file transfer, such as [[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] and [[e-mail attachment]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.badlanguage.net/writing-tools-dropbox | title = writing tools dropbox | publisher=badlanguage.net | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Dropbox functions as a storage service, its focus is on synchronization and sharing. It supports revision history, so files deleted from the Dropbox folder may be recovered from any of the synced computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work=Dropbox FAQ | title = Can I undelete files and recover old versions of files? | publisher=Dropbox, Inc. | url = https://www.dropbox.com/help/11 | accessdate =January 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Adam Pash | title = Dropbox Syncs and Backs Up Files Between Computers Instantaneously | publisher=Lifehacker | url = http://lifehacker.com/397778/dropbox-syncs-and-backs-up-files-between-computers-instantaneously | accessdate =September 22, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dropbox's version control also helps users know the history of a file they may be currently working on, enabling more than one person to edit and re-post files without complications of losing its previous form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Jason Snell | title = Throw your stuff in Dropbox | publisher=Macworld | url = http://www.macworld.com/article/138810/2009/02/mwvodcast93.html | accessdate =February 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The version history is limited to 30 days. A paid option for unlimited version history called &quot;Pack-Rat&quot; is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = What is Pack-Rat? | publisher=Dropbox | url = https://www.getdropbox.com/help/113 | accessdate =October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version history is paired with the use of [[delta encoding]] technology. To conserve bandwidth and time, if a file in a user's Dropbox folder is changed, Dropbox only uploads the [[Block (data storage)|pieces of the file]] that are changed when syncing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dropbox.com/help/8 | work=Dropbox FAQ | title = Does Dropbox always upload/download the entire file any time a change is made? | accessdate =February 9, 2010 | quote = Before transferring a file, we compare the new file to the previous version and only send the piece of the file that changed.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the desktop client has no restriction on individual file size, files uploaded via the web site are limited to a maximum of 300 [[Megabyte|MB]] per file.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dropbox.com/help/5 | work=Dropbox FAQ | title = Is there a limit or maximum to how big my files can be? | publisher=Dropbox, Inc. | quote = Files uploaded to Dropbox via the desktop application have no file size limit. There is, however, a 300MB cap on files transferred via the website. }}&lt;/ref&gt; To prevent free users (who get 2 GB of free storage) from creating multiple free accounts, Dropbox includes the content of shared folders when totaling the amount of space used on the account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dropbox.com/help/59 | title = Will joining someone else's shared folder use my quota? | publisher=Dropbox, Inc. |work=Dropbox FAQ | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dropbox uses [[Amazon.com|Amazon]]'s [[Amazon S3|S3]] storage system to store the files&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.dropbox.com/help/7 | work=Dropbox FAQ | title = Where are my files stored? | publisher=Dropbox, Inc. | quote = All files stored online by Dropbox are encrypted and kept securely on Amazon's Simple Storage Service (S3) in data centers located along the east coast of the United States.}}&lt;/ref&gt;; though [[Drew Houston|Houston]] has stated that Dropbox may switch to a different storage provider at some point in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/dropbox-review-invites-and-7-questions-with-the-founder | title       =DropBox : Review, Invites, and 7 Questions with the Founder | first       =Dave | last        =Drager | date        =March 17, 2010 | publisher=MakeUseOf.com | accessdate  =May 7, 2010 | quote       =We may not be on s3 forever, and will build our own store in addition, but for now this lets us focus on both the client software and the performance of the layer weâve developed on top of s3.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also uses [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]] transfers for synchronization and stores the data via [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES]]-256 encryption.&lt;ref name=&quot;features&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dropbox.com/features | title = Dropbox Features | accessdate =January 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Power users have devised a number of innovative uses for and [[Mashup (web application hybrid)|mash-ups]] of the technology that expand Dropbox' functionality. These include: sending files to a Dropbox via [[Gmail]]; using Dropbox to sync [[Instant messaging|IM]] chat logs; [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]] management; [[Password manager|password management]]; [[Remote desktop software|remote application launching]] and system monitoring; and as a free [[Web hosting service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Alex Castle | url = http://www.maximumpc.com/article/features/15_things_you_have_know_about_dropbox?page=0%2C3 | title = 15 Hacks Every Dropbox User Should Know | publisher=Maximum PC | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://storecrowd.com/blog/dropbox-hacks/ | title = 15 Advanced Dropbox Hacks | publisher=StoreCrowd | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://lifehacker.com/5063176/how-to-use-dropbox-as-the-ultimate-password-syncer | title       =How to Use Dropbox as the Ultimate Password Syncer | first       =Adam | last        =Pash | date        =October 14, 2008 | publisher=[[LifeHacker]] | accessdate  =May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://lifehacker.com/5547714/launch-applications-remotely-with-dropbox-and-autohotkey | title       =Launch Applications Remotely with Dropbox and AutoHotkey | first       =Whitson | last        =Gordon | date        =May 25, 2010 | publisher=[[LifeHacker]] | accessdate  =May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://lifehacker.com/5541713/use-dropbox-to-monitor-your-computer-remotely | title       =Use Dropbox to Monitor Your Computer Remotely | first       =Erica | last        =Ho | date        =May 18, 2010 | publisher=[[LifeHacker]] | accessdate  =May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url         =http://lifehacker.com/5528104/use-dropbox-to-share-and-host-your-web-site | title       =Use Dropbox to Share and Host Your Web Site | author=tehdavid | date        =April 30, 2010 | publisher=[[LifeHacker]] | accessdate  =May 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Functionality ==

=== Add-ons ===
There are a large number of official and unofficial Dropbox addons that are available, mostly created by the Dropbox community. These addons are both in the form of web services such as SendToDropbox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Send to Dropbox|url=http://sendtodropbox.com/|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which allows users to email files to their Dropboxes) and desktop applications such as MacDropAny&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DropboxAddons/MacDropAny â Dropbox Wiki|url=http://wiki.dropbox.com/DropboxAddons/MacDropAny|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which allows users to sync any folder on their computer with Dropbox). There is also a web services and browser extensions called cloudHQ for Dropbox&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=cloudHQ for Dropbox â Integrate Dropbox and Google Docs|url=http://cloudHQ.net/dropbox|accessdate=May 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which allows Dropbox users to synchronize [[Google Docs]] with files in Dropbox storage and also to edit Dropbox documents in the browser.

There are also a number of client applications for operating systems that Dropbox does not officially support, such as [[Maemo]], [[Symbian]], and [[webOS]].

An [[open source]] tool called [[Dropship (software)|Dropship]] provides unauthenticated access to Dropbox-hosted files by using the Dropbox [[Application programming interface|API]] to access files by their hash. Dropbox has attempted to squash this project by requesting its suspension where it was being hosted, and by inadvertently issuing a fake [[DMCA takedown notice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=DeFelippi|first=Dan|title=Dropbox Attempts to Kill Open Source Project|url=http://razorfast.com/2011/04/25/dropbox-attempts-to-kill-open-source-project/|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2011-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dropbox user demographics ==
A plurality of Dropbox users ie 32.7% are from the United States, with 6.7% and 6.5% from the United Kingdom and Germany respectively. 
66.1% of Dropbox users use Windows only, 20.9% use [[Mac OS]] only, 2.0% use [[Linux]] only, and the remainder use some combination of the three.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ying|first=Jon|title=Dropbox around the world!|url=http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=339|publisher=Dropbox|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Copyright issues ==
Dropbox has agreed to abide by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]] copyright guidelines and therefore it has dissuaded its users from uploading copyrighted content to Dropbox's servers.

== Criticism ==
Dropbox has been criticized by independent security researcher Derek Newton, who has argued that Dropbox's authentication architecture is inherently insecure&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Newton|first=Derek|title=Dropbox authentication: insecure by design|url=http://dereknewton.com/2011/04/dropbox-authentication-static-host-ids/|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and by software expert [[Miguel de Icaza]] who claims that Dropbox's terms of service contradicts its privacy policy and that the company's famous claim &quot;Dropbox employees arenât able to access user files&quot; is a lie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=de Icaza|first=Miguel|title=Dropbox Lack of Security|url=http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Apr-19.html|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service has also been criticized for not supporting the ability for users to use their own AES-256 keys and for automatically signing in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://paulstamatiou.com/thoughts-on-dropbox | title = Thoughts on Dropbox | publisher=Paul Stamatiou | accessdate =April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, a complaint was filed with the US [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] alleging Dropbox misled users about the privacy and security of their files. At the heart of the complaint was the policy of &quot;deduplication&quot;, where the system checks if a file has been uploaded before by any other user, and links to the existing copy if so; and the policy of using a single AES-256 key for every file on the system so Dropbox can (and does, for deduplication) look at encrypted files stored on the system, with the consequence that any intruder who gets the key (as well as Dropbox employees) could decrypt any file if they had access to Dropbox's backend storage infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dropbox Accused Of Misleading Customers On Security | author=Mathew J. Schwarz | url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/storage/security/229500683 | magazine=InformationWeek | date=May 16, 2011 | accessdate=May 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June 2011, all Dropbox accounts could be accessed without password for 4 hours as reported by [[TechCrunch]]. The error was caused by a code update made at 1:54&amp;nbsp;pm Pacific Time. The error was detected at 5:41&amp;nbsp;pm and immediately fixed. Less than 1 percent of Dropbox's users were logged in at that time. All logged in sessions were ended since then. All users with compromised accounts were notified by emails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Dropbox Security Bug Made Passwords Optional For Four Hours | author=Jason Kincaid | url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/06/20/dropbox-security-bug-made-passwords-optional-for-four-hours/ | magazine=TechCrunch | date=June 20, 2011 | accessdate=June 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.dropbox.com/?p=821 dropbox.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Dropbox could potentially face a class action lawsuit over this incident. The lawsuit is being initiated by Cristina Wong of Los Angeles and claims violation of the California Unfair Competition Law. The suit has been filed as Wong et al. v. Dropbox Inc., No. 11-CV-3092-LB, (N.D. Cal. June 22, 2011). The suit is scheduled to be heard by U.S. Magistrate Judge Laurel Beeler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hylkema|first=Joe|title=Online storage provider Dropbox sued over data breach|url=http://newsandinsight.thomsonreuters.com/California/News/Journal/2011/07_-_July/Online_storage_provider_Dropbox_sued_over_data_breach/|accessdate=19 July 2011|date=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
