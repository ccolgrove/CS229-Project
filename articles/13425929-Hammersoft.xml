'''Samer Saeed''' ({{lang-ar|'''Ø³Ø§ÙØ± Ø³Ø¹ÙØ¯'''}}) (born July 1, 1987, in [[Iraq]]) is an Iraqi [[midfielder]]. Samer plays currently with [[Najaf FC]] in Iraq, and for the [[Iraq national football team]].

==Career==
Saeed belongs among the generation of Iraqi players who emerged after 2003. As a teenager, he was recruited by Arbil FC, where he remained until 2006. After spending the next season with [[Baghdad]]-based Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya, he moved to Al-Ahly Tripoli in [[Libya]] in 2007. Saeed made a name for himself in his adopted country and was named Libya's âBest Foreign Player of the Year' in 2008.

==International career==
In his international debut, a friendly with Jordan on 24 January 2008, Samer Saeed donned the number 8 jersey, a number [[Ahmad Abd Ali]] had seemingly made his own in Iraq's title-winning campaign at the [[2007 AFC Asian Cup]]. The game ended 1-1, with Saeed playing impressively in his creative role. Prior to this senior bow, the diminutive midfielder had figured prominently with the Iraqi Olympic side that won silver at the [[2006 Asian Games]] in [[Doha]].

==Attributes==
Standing just 165&amp;nbsp;cm tall, Saeed is one of the shortest players in the Iraqi team. But what he lacks in physical stature, the midfielder makes up for with pace, skill and creativity.

==Honours==
=== Country===
* [[Football at the 2006 Asian Games|2006 Asian Games]] Silver medallist.

===Clubs===
* Libyan League Best foreign Player 2008

==Personal==
Samer is the twin brother of the Iraqi defender [[Samal Saeed]].
