'''GDM''' (the '''[[GNOME]] Display Manager''') provides a simpler to use alternative [[X display manager (program type)|display manager]] for the [[X Window System]]'s XDM.

The X Window System by default uses the [[X Display Manager (implementation)|XDM]] display manager. However, resolving XDM configuration issues typically involves editing a [[configuration file]]. GDM allows users to customize or troubleshoot settings without having to resort to a command line. Users can pick their session type on a per-login basis. GDM also features easy customization with [[Skin (computing)|theme]]s.

== Hidden features ==
GDM has a few [[Easter egg (media)|Easter eggs]], in the form of strings to be entered in the username box. These can be found in the source file &quot;gui/guilogin.c&quot;, in a function named &quot;evil&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gdm/tree/gui/gdmlogin.c?h=gnome-2-20#n806 | title=gdm - guilogin.c | accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Dancing login - type &quot;Start Dancing&quot; to start, and &quot;Stop Dancing&quot; to stop. (This requires the standard greeter, rather than the graphical one).
* &quot;Gimme Random Cursor&quot; - can be used repeatedly.
* &quot;Require Quarter&quot; (or &quot;Require Quater&quot;, for backward compatibility with a typo in the original),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://git.gnome.org/cgit/gdm/commit/?h=gnome-2-20&amp;id=ee8de912c84d9df4180965fe49108051f563ce11 | title= GDM commit ee8de912 | date= 5 March 2001 | accessdate=2009-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; then log in normally - a dialog box appears after entering the password.

=== Queen of England ===
Some of the copyright notices of GDM refer to the &quot;Queen of England&quot;, who is also named as a maintainer in release announcements since version 2.2.1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2001-May/msg00008.html | title=ANNOUNCE: GDM 2.2.1, the &quot;Just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not after you&quot; release | date=4 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was only later that the developers realised that there has been no &quot;Queen of England&quot; since the [[Acts of Union 1707|Acts of Union]] of 1707.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gdm-list/2004-March/msg00002.html | title=ANNOUNCE: GDM 2.5.90.2 (unstable), the &quot;Nose poking&quot; release | date= 4 Mar 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
