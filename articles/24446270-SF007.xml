'''Gnoppix''' was an [[operating system]] primarily intended to offer the [[GNOME]] desktop environment on a [[Live CD]], which allows the operating system to be used without installing it to [[hard disk]].

Gnoppix was inspired by [[Knoppix]], a Live CD distribution which used [[KDE]] for its user interface until the Version 6 release. Both distributions are based on [[Advanced Packaging Tool]], designed for [[Debian]]. The name is a play on Knoppix but with a G in the tradition of naming GNOME apps with an initial G (to KDE's K). (Knoppix now uses [[LXDE]] and the new initial LX.)

Although Gnoppix was intended to be used as Live CD it could also be installed to and booted from a hard disk. Gnoppix was originally built around its own customised Live CD environment; the last editions, however, were a rebranded and customised version of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].{{Fact|date=March 2009}}
