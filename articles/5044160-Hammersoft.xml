'''Milan MartiÄ''' ([[Serbian Cyrillic]]: ÐÐ¸Ð»Ð°Ð½ ÐÐ°ÑÑÐ¸Ñ; born 18 November 1954) is a [[Serb]]ian politician, former president of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]]. He was a senior rebel commander of Serbian forces in [[Croatia]] during the [[Croatian War of Independence]].

MartiÄ was convicted of [[war crimes]] by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY)]] on 12 June 2007 and sentenced to 35 years in prison.

==Biography==
MartiÄ was born near Knin and was the local [[police chief]] in [[Knin]] at the time of [[Croatia]]'s [[declaration of independence]]. In 1990, he took on the position of local Serb leader, organizing ''MartiÄ's Police'' [[militia]]. From 4 January 1991 to August 1995, MartiÄ held various leadership positions, including President, Minister of Defence, Minister of Internal Affairs, in the unrecognised offices of the [[SAO Krajina|Serbian Autonomous District (SAO) Krajina]], and the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]] (RSK).

Martic was supported by [[Slobodan Milosevic]] during the 1993 presidential election in Serbian Krajina. Martic ran for the [[Serbian Party of Socialists (Croatia)|Serbian Party of Socialists]] which received significant financial support from Milosevic's [[Socialist Party of Serbia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scc.rutgers.edu/serbian_digest/117/t117-3.htm Milosevic Loses Krajina], Filip Svarm, December 20, 1993 Vreme News Digest Agency No 117&lt;/ref&gt; In a second round of voting in 1994 he was elected President and remained in power until the fall of Serbian Krajina during the Croatia's [[Operation Storm]] in 1995.

Initially indicted by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia]] (ICTY) on 25 July 1995, MartiÄ surrendered on May 15, 2002, and was transferred to the tribunal in [[The Hague]] the same day. He was charged with murder, persecutions, inhumane treatment, forced displacement, plunder of public or private property, wanton destruction of cities, towns or villages. He [[plea]]ded not guilty to all counts.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC&quot;&gt;{{cite web

According to the ICTY, in the amended indictment, he &quot;helped organize an [[ethnic cleansing]] campaign of Croats and other non-Serbs from Krajina where 78,000 lived and virtually the entire non-Serb population was forcibly removed, deported or killed&quot;. He was originally charged only with ordering [[Zagreb rocket attack|a rocket attack]] on the Croatian capital of [[Zagreb]] which killed seven civilians as retaliation to [[Operation Flash]]. MartiÄ later appeared on Serbian television and radio, admitting he ordered the shelling.

[[Milan BabiÄ]] who, along with MartiÄ, was one of the most important leaders of rebelled Croatian Serbs, said during MartiÄ's trial that the entire war in Croatia was MartiÄ's responsibility, orchestrated by [[Belgrade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; His sentence of 35 years in prison was confirmed by ICTY appellate council on October 8, 2008. The judgment was also especially damaging to the legacy of the Republic of Serbian Krajina and the then Serbian regime as MartiÄ was found to have been part of a &quot;joint criminal enterprise&quot; which included [[Blagoje AdÅ¾iÄ]], [[Milan BabiÄ]], [[Radmilo BogdanoviÄ]], [[Veljko KadijeviÄ]], [[Radovan KaradÅ¾iÄ]], [[Slobodan MiloÅ¡eviÄ]], [[Ratko MladiÄ]], [[Vojislav Å eÅ¡elj]], [[Franko SimatoviÄ]], [[Jovica StaniÅ¡iÄ]], and 
[[Dragan VasiljkoviÄ]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ICTY judgment&quot; /&gt;

In June 2009 he was transferred to serve the sentence in [[Tartu]] prison in [[Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltictimes.com/news/articles/23143/ War criminal transferred to Estonia]&lt;/ref&gt;
