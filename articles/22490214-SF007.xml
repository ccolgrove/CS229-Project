'''Aurora''' (formerly named '''Eeebuntu''')  (not to be confused with '''[[EasyPeasy]]''', formerly known as Ubuntu Eee) is an [[operating system]] for [[netbook]]s. The current version is based on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], though newer versions will be based on [[Debian]] Unstable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.eeebuntu.org/viewtopic.php?p=21102#p21102 Eeevolution - Eeebuntu 4.0 and beyond]&lt;/ref&gt; Eeebuntu was designed originally for the [[Asus Eee PC]] line of netbooks.

Four versions are available for install: Standard, NBR (standard with [[Ubuntu Netbook Edition]]), Base and [[LXDE]].

== Features ==

* Integrates the [http://www.statux.org/content?page=catalog&amp;catagory=7&amp;product=asus-eee eeepc-tray] ACPI (now changed to [http://www.sf.net/projects/jupiter Jupiter]) utility to control ACPI events and toggle certain devices on the Eee on/off.

== History ==
Eeebuntu was created in Dec 2007 by Steve Wood. At that time Eeebuntu was little more than a collection of scripts applied to a live Ubuntu image.  As the project matured the post install scripts were dropped in favour of a modified kernel that contained pre-compiled hardware drivers.

Other developers took interest in the project and by December 2008 Eeebuntu had grown into a Linux distribution in its own right with around 1,500 registered forum users.  Eeebuntu 2.0 was the first Eeebuntu version to completely remove Ubuntu branding and use its own artwork and themes.

Eeebuntu has 4 versions:
* Base - 565MB ISO footprint, reduced number of [[pre-installed]] applications.
* Standard - A [[compiz]] enabled full desktop with a number of pre-installed applications.
* NBR - Using the Ubuntu Netbook interface with a number of pre-installed applications.
* LXDE - Utilising the [[LXDE]] desktop and a number of pre-installed applications.

== Current release ==
The latest release of Eeebuntu is based on Ubuntu 9.04. It addresses a number of issues with the integrated Intel graphics cards and provides Eee PC specific optimization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gadgetmix.com/index/eeebuntu-3-0-review-base-and-standard-editions/ EEEBUNTU 3.0 REVIEW]&lt;/ref&gt;
