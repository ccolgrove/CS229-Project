==Early life==
Yastrzemski was born in [[Southampton (town), New York|Southampton, New York]] to Carl Yastrzemski, Sr. and Hattie Skonieczny.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Yastrzemski at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Both his parents were of a Polish background, and young Carl was bilingual from an early age. Raised on his father's potato farm, Carl played on sandlot baseball teams with his father, who, he maintains, was a better athlete than he was. &quot;Yaz&quot; attended [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]] on a basketball scholarship (his career Long Island high school scoring mark at Bridgehampton broke one previously held by [[Jim Brown]]) briefly before embarking on his baseball career. His Notre Dame teammates nicknamed Yastrzemski &quot;Murph,&quot; in an ironic bid to impute an Irish flavor despite his obvious Polish origins.

Yastrzemski signed with the Red Sox organization, which sent him to the [[Minor league baseball|minor-league]] Raleigh Capitals in {{by|1959}}, where he led the league with a .377 batting average,&lt;ref name=yazbio&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yaz8.com/bio.htm|title=Official Yastrzemski Web Bio|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=yaz8.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/leader.cgi?type=bat&amp;id=10728 1959 Carolina League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; They then moved him to the [[Minneapolis Millers]] for the post-season and the {{by|1960}} season.&lt;ref name=millers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stewthornley.net/millers.html|title=Minneapolis Millers history|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yastrzemski, who had studied business at Notre Dame, fulfilled a promise to his parents by finishing his degree at [[Merrimack College]] in North Andover, Mass., in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/add_Yastrzemski_Carl.html|title=Yaz won Triple Crown|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work= ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major League career==
===Early career===
Yastrzemski began his major-league career in {{by|1961}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Yastrzemski at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; From the beginning, there was tremendous pressure on him to perform, as he succeeded to the position of Sox legend [[Ted Williams]].&lt;ref name=&quot;''Rawlings Presents Big Stix: The Greatest Hitters in the History of the Major Leagues''&quot;/&gt; He would prove to be a worthy successor at the plate, and a far superior defensive player with a strong arm, expert in playing off the [[Green Monster]], [[Fenway Park]]'s left-field wall. In 12 years as a left fielder, Yastrzemski won seven Gold Gloves and led in assists seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=Carl_Yastrzemski_1939|title=The Ballplayers - Carl Yastrzemski |accessdate=2008-07-25 |work=BaseballLibrary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_al.shtml#1977 American League Gold Glove Award winners at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

While his first two years were viewed as solid but unspectacular, he emerged as a rising star in {{by|1963}}, winning the [[American League]] batting championship with a batting average of .321, and also leading the league in doubles and walks, finishing sixth in the [[MLB Most Valuable Player award|Most Valuable Player]] voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1963-batting-leaders.shtml 1963 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1963.shtml#ALmvp 1963 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting results at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

===1967===
Yastrzemski enjoyed his best season in {{by|1967}}, when he won the [[American League]] [[Triple crown (baseball)|Triple Crown]] with a .326 [[batting average]], 44 [[home run]]s (tied with [[Harmon Killebrew]]) and 121 [[Run batted in|RBIs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1967 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Yastrzemski's Triple Crown win in 1967 is the last time a major league hitter has won the Batting Triple Crown as of the end of the {{by|2010}} season - conversely six different pitchers have since won the pitchers' version. He was voted [[Major League Baseball Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] almost unanimously (one voter chose [[CÃ©sar Tovar]] of the [[Minnesota Twins|Twins]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;1967 American League Most Valuable Player Award voting resultsa at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;

[[1967 Boston Red Sox season|1967]] was the season of the [[The Impossible Dream (1967)|&quot;Impossible Dream&quot;]] for the Red Sox (referring to the hit song from the musical play ''[[Man of La Mancha]]''), who rebounded from a ninth-place finish a year before to win the American League pennant (their first since {{by|1946}}) on the last day of the season.&lt;ref name=&quot;1967 American League Team Statistics and Standings at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1967.shtml 1967 American League Team Statistics and Standings at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; With the Red Sox battling as part of a four-team pennant race, Yastrzemski hit .513 (23 hits in 44 at bats) with five home runs and 16 runs batted in over the last two weeks of the season, and finished a mere one game ahead of the [[Detroit Tigers]] and [[Minnesota Twins]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1967 American League Team Statistics and Standings at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=TCsDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA66&amp;dq=yastrzemski+baseball+digest&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=yastrzemski%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Triple Crown Season in '67 Marked High Point for Yaz'', by Dan Shaughnessy, Baseball Digest, August 1992, Vol. 51, No. 8, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Sox lost the [[1967 World Series|World Series]] four games to three to the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], losing three times to [[Bob Gibson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1967_WS.shtml 1967 World Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In that season, Yastrzemski also won the [[Hickok Belt]] as top professional athlete of the year and ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine's &quot;[[Sportsman of the Year]]&quot; Award.

In an article he co-wrote for the November 1967 issue of SPORT Magazine, Yastrzemski credited Boston's remarkable season to manager [[Dick Williams]] and an infusion of youth, including [[Rico Petrocelli]] and [[Tony Conigliaro]]. Referring to Williams, Yastrzemski wrote: &quot;He got rid of all the individuality, made us into a team, gave us an incentive, and made us want to win.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesportgallery.com/sport-stories/1967nov-redsox.html|title=Carl Yastrzemski - Behind the Red Sox Turnaround - SPORT magazine|accessdate=2008-07-25 |work= thesportgallery.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later career===
[[Image:YazTigerStadium.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Yastrzemski at-bat in [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]], Detroit, Michigan, 1983]]
In {{by|1968}} Yastrzemski again won the batting championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;1968 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1968-batting-leaders.shtml 1968 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the competitive advantages pitchers enjoyed between 1963 and 1968 (prior to the lowering of the [[pitcher's mound]]), Yastrzemski's .301 mark in &quot;The Year of the Pitcher&quot; is the lowest average of any batting champion in major league history; however, he was the only hitter in the American League to hit .300 for that season against such formidable pitching, as well as leading the league in on-base percentage and walks.&lt;ref name=&quot;1968 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He had many more strong seasons, consistently finishing in the top ten in the league in many statistical categories.

In {{by|1969}}, Yastrzemski enjoyed the first of two straight 40-home run seasons as he led the Red Sox to third-place finishes that year and the next. He got four hits, tying the record, and won the All-Star Game MVP in {{by|1970}}, although the American League lost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NLS/NLS197007140.shtml 1970 All-Star Game at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; His .329 batting average that season was his career high, but he finished second behind the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]]' [[Alex Johnson]] for the batting title by less than .001.&lt;ref name=&quot;1970 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1970-batting-leaders.shtml 1970 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson himself robbed Yastrzemski of a homer (after the season, admitting that a fan in the stands put the ball in his glove) was pulled out of the last game to ensure his batting title. In 1970 Yaz led the league in slugging and on-base percentage, finishing third in home runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;1970 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;  

Although he hit but 61 home runs over the next four years ([[1971 Boston Red Sox season|1971]] through [[1974 Boston Red Sox season|1974]]) as the Red Sox finished second twice and third twice, he finished in the top 10 in batting, and top three in on base percentage and walks in [[1973 Boston Red Sox season|1973]] and 1974, and led the league in runs scored in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1973-batting-leaders.shtml 1973 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1974-batting-leaders.shtml 1974 American League Batting Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the [[1975 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1975 All-Star Game]], Yastrzemski was called to [[Pinch hitter|pinch-hit]] in the sixth inning, with two men on base and the American League down 3-0. Without wearing a batting helmet, he hit [[Tom Seaver]]'s first pitch for a home run to tie the score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS197507150.shtml 1975 All-Star Game at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The three-run homer was the only scoring the American League did that night as they lost 6-3.

Yastrzemski and the Red Sox would suffer another World Series loss in {{wsy|1975}}, losing four games to three to the [[Cincinnati Reds]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1975_WS.shtml 1975 World Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Yastrzemski made the final out in Game 7 on a fly out to center, trailing by one run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197510220.shtml 1975 World Series Game 7 box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, he also made the final out of the [[1978 American League East tie-breaker game]] with a foul pop to third base.&lt;ref name=&quot;October 2, 1978 Yankees-Red Sox box score at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/BOS/BOS197810020.shtml October 2, 1978 Yankees-Red Sox box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; This game featured [[Bucky Dent]]'s famous homer (although [[Reggie Jackson]]'s home run was the eventual winning run). Earlier in the game, however, Yastrzemski began the scoring with a home run off left-handed pitcher [[Ron Guidry]], who was having a career year (25 wins, 3 loses and a 1.74 ERA).&lt;ref name=&quot;October 2, 1978 Yankees-Red Sox box score at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; It was the only homer the [[Cy Young Award]] winner allowed to a left-hander all season. 

On May 19, [[1976 Boston Red Sox season|1976]], Yastrzemski hit three home runs against the Detroit Tigers at [[Tiger Stadium (Detroit)|Tiger Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/DET/DET197605190.shtml May 19, 1976 Red Sox-Tigers box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; He then went to [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] and hit two more, tying the major league record of five home runs in two consecutive games.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=ZDQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=carl+yastrzemski+baseball+digest&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=carl%20yastrzemski%20baseball%20digest&amp;f=false ''Yastrzemski Recalls His Most Memorable Games'', by Peter Gammons, Baseball Digest, September 1981,Vol. 40, No. 9, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/NYA/NYA197605200.shtml May 20, 1976 Red Sox-Yankees box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[1978 Boston Red Sox season|1978]] Yastrzemski, then 39, was one of the five oldest players in the league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/AL/1978-other-leaders.shtml 1978 American League Awards, All-Stars and Other Leaders at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1982 Boston Red Sox season|1982]], playing primarily as a designated hitter, an early season hitting streak placed him among the league's leading hitters and saw him featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated and played in that year's All-Star game.

Yastrzemski retired in {{by|1983}} at the age of 44, although he stated in his autobiography ''Yaz'' that he was initially planning on playing the 1984 season, until he tired from a long midseason slump. He also stated that had he known how good a pitcher [[Roger Clemens]] would have been, he would have continued on in 1984 regardless, to have had a chance to play with him.

No player has had a longer career with only one team, 23 seasons, a record which he shares with [[Brooks Robinson]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles]].&lt;ref name=&quot;''Rawlings Presents Big Stix: The Greatest Hitters in the History of the Major Leagues''&quot;/&gt; His final career statistics include 3,308 [[games played]] (second all-time and most with only one team), 646 doubles (seventh all-time), 452 home runs, 1,844 RBIs (12th all-time), and a batting average of .285.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Yastrzemski at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He had 1,845 [[Base on balls|walks]] in his career, (sixth all-time), and 1,157 extra base hits (ninth all-time). Yastrzemski was the first player to ever collect over 3,000 [[Hit (baseball statistics)|hits]] and 400 home runs solely in the American League;&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Sox retired numbers at MLB.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.mlb.com/bos/history/retired_numbers.jsp Red Sox retired numbers at MLB.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the feat has since been accomplished by [[Cal Ripken Jr.]]. He was named to the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] 18 times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Yastrzemski at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Yastrzemski won three American League [[List of Major League Baseball batting champions|batting championships]] in his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carl Yastrzemski at the Baseball Hall of Fame&quot;/&gt; In addition, Yastrzemski only trails [[Ty Cobb]] in hits collected with a single team, and trails only Cobb and [[Tris Speaker]] in hits collected playing in the American League, both of whom played before World War II.

[[Image:Carl Yastrzemski01.jpg|thumb|right|In the Red Sox Hall of Fame at [[Fenway Park]]]]

As one of the top players of his era, he was elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in his first year of eligibility, with the support of 94% of voters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Sox retired numbers at MLB.com&quot;/&gt; For his entire career with the Red Sox, he wore uniform number 8. The Red Sox retired this number on August 6, 1989 after Yastrzemski was elected to the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=&quot;Red Sox retired numbers at MLB.com&quot;/&gt; In {{by|1999}}, Yastrzemski ranked number 72 on ''[[Sporting News|The Sporting News]]''' list of [[The Sporting News list of Baseball's Greatest Players|the 100 Greatest Baseball Players]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.sportingnews.com/baseball/100/ Carl Yastrzemski at The Sporting News 100 Greatest Baseball Players]&lt;/ref&gt; That same season, he was named a finalist to the [[Major League Baseball All-Century Team]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/history/mlb_history_moreinfo.jsp Carl Yastrzemski at The Major League Baseball All-Century Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

Yastrzemski was well-known for his batting stance, holding his bat exceptionally high, giving his swing a large, dramatic arc, and more power at the plate. However, in his later years, he adjusted his stance and held the bat lower. He was also known for modifying his [[batting helmets]] by enlarging the right ear hole (for comfort) and removing part of the right ear flap (for better vision of the ball as it was being pitched).

A record album of the Red Sox's 1967 season, aptly titled &quot;The Impossible Dream&quot;, featured a song by DJ [[Jess Cain]] of praise for &quot;The man they call Yaz&quot;, which included the line &quot;Although 'Yastrzemski' is a lengthy name / It fits quite nicely in our Hall of Fame.&quot; (A link to the song appears below.) The song can be heard, and the album cover can be seen, in the apartment of Ben Wrightman (played by [[Jimmy Fallon]]) in the [[2005 in film|2005 film]] ''[[Fever Pitch (2005 film)|Fever Pitch]]''. Earlier in the film, Ben's girlfriend, Lindsay Meeks ([[Drew Barrymore]]), not yet familiar with the triumphs and tribulations of the Red Sox, is unable to properly pronounce Yastrzemski's name, and has to be corrected by the surrounding fans: &quot;Ya-STREM-ski!&quot;

Along with [[Johnny Pesky]], Yastrzemski raised the [[2004 World Series]] championship banner over [[Fenway Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0CE1DB123EF931A25757C0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=print|title=With Rings and Then a Rout, It's a Great Day for the Red Sox|newspaper=The New York Times|date=April 12, 2005|first=Tyler|last=Kepner|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is currently a roving instructor with the Red Sox, and was honored by throwing out the first pitch in Game 1 of both the 2004 and 2007 World Series. In August 2008, Yastrzemski underwent successful triple bypass heart surgery at [[Massachusetts General Hospital]]. In June 2009, Boston drafted Carl's grandson Michael, a left fielder out of [[St. John's Preparatory School (Danvers, Massachusetts)|St. John's Prep]] in the 36th round; Michael did not sign with the team and went to [[Vanderbilt University|Vanderbilt]] where he starts in right field and wears number 18.
