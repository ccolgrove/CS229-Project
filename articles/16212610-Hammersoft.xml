She has a bright personality and a close relationship with her father. She is very well rounded which grabs the attention of the boys in her school and local area. Her nickname is '''Juubei''', a reference to the famous Japanese swordman [[Yagyuu Juubei]]. As Yagyuu Juubei, Jiyuu is described as a calculating young swordwoman with a completely different persona, although some of her true self is still shown. Whenever she defeats an enemy, she releases him/her from their hatred on Yagyuu Juubei. Despite her appearance of a petite young high school girl, Jiyuu does have some skills, one of these is the &quot;Yagyuu Shinkageryuu Mutodori&quot;, a sword catching skill used to prevent harm on her opponent.

Jiyuu first encountered Koinosuke Odagou, who had been searching for a worthy successor for the ''Lovely Eyepatch''. After her first transformation into Yagyuu Juubei, Jiyuu is targeted by the Ryuujouji clan, a school that has had a grudge on Yagyuu Juubei. Since then, Jiyuu has  battled with the Ryuujouji clan and their leader. 

The second series starts a year later. Even though Jiyuu has tried to forget the events of the first series, she still feels guilty over what happened to Koinosuke. She requests Sai quit being a [[ghostwriter]] and write her a love story under his own name. She meets and befriends Freesia Yagyuu, a transfer student from Russia, and later encounters Koinosuke's child, Ayunosuke. At first, she refuses to wear the Eyepatch, but after being attacked by the Siberian Yagyuu and Freesia, she picks up her sword once again. 

After being slapped by Sai, Jiyuu falls into a state of confusion, mistaking Mikage as her mother while not recognising Sai as her father. Later, both Mikage and Sai help her to regain her memories. Understanding her destiny, she provokes Freesia into an amazing duel and convinces her to stop her goal of vengeance, after which they are attacked by the spirit of Kita Retsusai. Together with Freesia, Jiyuu defeats Retsusai, wiping him out of existence. She feels guilty over what has happened to Ayunosuke, but the last screen shot shows her reuniting with Ayunosuke.
