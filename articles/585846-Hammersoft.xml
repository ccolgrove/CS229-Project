The '''South Carolina Stingrays''' are a professional [[minor league]] [[ice hockey]] team based in [[North Charleston, South Carolina|North Charleston]], [[South Carolina]]. The Stingrays play in the South Division of the [[ECHL]]'s Eastern Conference. They play their home games at the [[North Charleston Coliseum]]. The Carolina Ice Palace, also located in North Charleston, serves as a practice facility and backup arena for the Stingrays. Established in 1993, the team has been owned by a conglomerate of local business owners since 1995. Since 2004, the team has been affiliated with the [[Washington Capitals]] of the [[National Hockey League]] and the [[Hershey Bears]] of the [[American Hockey League]].

The Stingrays are the first professional ice hockey team established in the state of South Carolina.&lt;ref name=&quot;First&quot; /&gt; With the relocation of the [[Johnstown Chiefs]] to [[Greenville Road Warriors|Greenville]], South Carolina in [[2010&amp;ndash;11 ECHL season|2010]], the Stingrays became the oldest continuously operational ECHL franchise to remain in its founding city (the [[Wheeling Nailers]], while an older franchise, originated in [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina]] as the [[Carolina Thunderbirds]] in 1988).  

The Stingrays have finished with the [[Brabham Cup|best record]] in the ECHL once, and qualified for the playoffs for every season except [[2006&amp;ndash;07 ECHL season|one]]. With [[Kelly Cup]] championships in [[1996&amp;ndash;97 ECHL season|1997]], [[2000&amp;ndash;01 ECHL season|2001]] and [[2008&amp;ndash;09 ECHL season|2009]], the Stingrays are tied with the [[Hampton Roads Admirals]] for the record for most league championships. Twenty-two former Stingrays players have gone on to play in the [[National Hockey League]] with one ([[Rich Peverley]]) winning the [[Stanley Cup]] with the [[Boston Bruins]] in [[2010&amp;ndash;11 NHL season|2011]].

The team developed a large fan base rapidly following its inception. During its first season ([[1993&amp;ndash;94 ECHL season|1993&amp;ndash;94]]) the team boasted an average of 9,151 fans a game&amp;mdash;one of the largest crowds in minor league hockey.&lt;ref name = &quot;Dixie&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Jon C.|last=Stott|title=Hockey Night in Dixie: Minor Pro Hockey in the American South|year=2006|publisher=Heritage House Publishing Company Ltd.|page=70|isbn=1894974212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent years have seen a downward trend in attendance.

===Birth of a franchise===
The South Carolina Stingrays were founded in 1993 as an expansion team in the [[ECHL|East Coast Hockey League]] (ECHL). Its management team included Joseph Scanlon as president/CEO and retired [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) player [[Rick Vaive]] as head coach.

He was replaced as president and CEO by retired NHL [[Hockey Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] [[Marcel Dionne]] in December of that year. Dionne was accused of assault in February 1994 by Lynn Bernstein, an ally of Scanlon, over a dispute regarding the removal of advertising signs at the [[North Charleston Coliseum]], but was later acquitted.&lt;ref&gt;MacDougall, David (1994-12-09).

The group also included [[Jerry Zucker (businessman)|Jerry]] and [[Anita Zucker]], Harvey Nathan and Lynn Bernstein (owners of local restaurant Nathan's Deli), and the Greenwald family of Seabrook Island.

===Retired numbers===
&lt;small&gt;Updated August 5, 2011.&lt;ref name = &quot;history&quot; /&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

'''12''' - Mark Bavis, who played from 1994&amp;ndash;96 when the Stingrays were an affiliate of the [[Buffalo Sabres]]. Bavis, by then a [[Los Angeles Kings]] scout, was killed along with Kings Director of Professional Scouting [[Garnet Bailey]] on [[United Airlines Flight 175]] when [[Al-Qaeda]] terrorists hijacked the airliner, and steered it towards the [[World Trade Center]] on [[September 11, 2001]]. The Stingrays retired his jersey before the start of the 2001&amp;ndash;02 season.
*Regular season statistics: 87 GP, 30 G, 38 A, 68 PTS, 186 PIM.
*Playoff statistics: 17 GP, 3 G, 7 A, 10 PTS, 34 PIM.

'''14''' - David Seitz, who played from 1996&amp;ndash;2004 and was a popular forward on the franchise with team records in goals, assists, and points, including over 200 goals and 500 points overall, fifth on the ECHL's all-time assists list, and two ECHL Kelly Cups. Seitz's retirement, caused by an ECHL restriction on experienced players on a roster after the Stingrays signed players for a road trip, sent shockwaves through the community.
*Regular season statistics: 489 GP, 217 G, 370 A, 587 PTS, 503 PIM.

'''24''' - Brett Marietti, a popular player and former captain, retired after the 2002&amp;ndash;03 season. Team management promptly retired his jersey in 2003. Marietti's tenure as captain ranks among the longest in ECHL history for a player to captain a single team.

*Playoff statistics: 69 GP, 30 G, 32 A, 62 PTS, 129 PIM.
