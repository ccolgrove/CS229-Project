'''Tisquantum''' (better known as '''Squanto''') (c. 1580s â November 1622) was a [[Patuxet tribe|Patuxet]]. He was the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] who assisted the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] after their first winter in the New World and was integral to their survival. The [[Patuxet tribe]] was a [[Tributary state|tributary]] of the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag Confederacy]].
==Biography==



Squanto's exact date of birth is unknown but many historians listed it as January 1, 1580. On his way back to the Patuxet in 1614, Tisquantum was kidnapped by Englishman Thomas Hunt. Hunt was one of [[John Smith (explorer)|John Smith]]'s lieutenants. Hunt was planning to sell fish, corn, and captured natives in [[MÃ¡laga]], [[Spain]]. There Hunt attempted to sell Tisquantum and a number of other [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] into slavery in Spain for Â£20 apiece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~mosmd/squanto.htm |title= Squanto | publisher= Roots Web | accessdate= 30 Nov 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some local friars discovered what Hunt was attempting and took the remaining Native Americans&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; Tisquantum included&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; in order to instruct them in the [[Christian]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;Sir Ferdinando Gorges, &quot;A Brief Relation of the Discovery and Plantation of New England&quot; (London: 1622)&lt;/ref&gt; Tisquantum convinced the friars to let him try to return home. He managed to get to [[London]], where he lived with and worked for a few years with John Slany, a shipbuilder who apparently taught Tisquantum more English. Slany took Tisquantum with him when he sailed to [[Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland|Cuper's Cove]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].&lt;ref&gt;1491. Mann, Charles C.&lt;/ref&gt; To get to New England, Tisquantum tried to take part in an expedition to that part of the North American east coast. When that plan fell through, he returned to [[England]] in 1618.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}  
At last in 1619 Tisquantum returned to his homeland, having joined an exploratory expedition along the New England coast, led by Captain [[Thomas Dermer]]. He soon discovered that the [[Patuxet]], as well as a majority of coastal New England tribes (mostly [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] and [[Massachusett]]), had been decimated the year before by an [[epidemic]] [[pandemic|plague]], possibly [[smallpox]]; it has recently been postulated as having been [[leptospirosis]].&lt;ref&gt;Marr JS, Cathey JT. New hypothesis for cause of an epidemic among Native Americans, New England, 1616â1619. Emerg Infect Dis [serial on the Internet]. 2010 Feb. http://www.cdc.gov/EID/content/16/2/281.htm DOI: 10.3201/edi1602.090276&lt;/ref&gt; Native Americans had no natural [[Immunity (medical)|immunity]] to European [[infectious diseases]].

Tisquantum finally settled with [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] at the site of his former village, which the English named [[Plymouth, Massachusetts|Plymouth]]. He helped them recover from an extremely hard first winter by teaching them [[Three Sisters (agriculture)|the native method of Maize cultivation]]. This method utilized local fish ([[herring]]) to [[fertilize]] crops. He likewise taught the colonists how to catch the herring necessary to fertilize maize in the native fashion along with the methods by which they could catch [[american eel|eels]] and other local wildlife for food. 

In 1621 Tisquantum was the guide and translator for settlers [[Stephen Hopkins (settler)|Stephen Hopkins]] and [[Edward Winslow]] as they traveled upland on a diplomatic mission to the [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] ''[[sachem]]'', known today as ''[[Massasoit]]''. In a subsequent mission for [[Governor William Bradford]] that summer, Tisquantum was captured by Wampanoag while gathering intelligence on the renegade ''[[Sachem|sagamore]]'', [[Corbitant]], at the village of ''Nemasket'' (site of present-day [[Middleborough]], Massachusetts.) [[Myles Standish]] led a ten-man team of settlers from Plymouth to rescue Tisquantum if he were alive or, if he had been killed, to avenge him. Tisquantum was found alive and well. He was welcomed back by the Pilgrims at Plymouth, where he continued in his vital role as assistant to the colony.

Although he worked at alliances, Tisquantum ended up distrusted by both the English and the Wampanoag. [[Massasoit]], the ''sachem'' who first appointed Tisquantum as liaison to the Pilgrims, nevertheless did not trust him in the tribe's dealings with the settlers. He assigned ''[[Hobomok|Hobamok]]'' (whose name may have been a [[pseudonym]], as it meant &quot;mischievous&quot;), to watch over Tisquantum and act as a second representative.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

On his way back from a meeting to repair damaged relations between the Wampanoag and Pilgrims, Tisquantum became sick with a fever.  Some historians have speculated that he was poisoned by the Wampanoag because they believed he had been disloyal to the ''sachem''.&lt;ref&gt;Philbrick, Nathaniel: ''Mayflower'', p. 138. Viking, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Tisquantum died a few days later in 1622 in [[Chatham, Massachusetts]]. He was buried in an unmarked grave, possibly in Plymouth's cemetery [[Burial Hill]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Peace between the two groups lasted for another fifty years.

Governor William Bradford, in ''Bradford's History of the English Settlement'', wrote regarding Tisquantum's death:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here [Manamoick Bay] Squanto fell ill of Indian fever, bleeding much at the nose, which the Indians take as a symptom of death, and within a few days he died.  He begged the Governor to pray for him, that he might go to the Englishman's God in heaven, and bequeathed several of his things to his English friends, as remembrances.  His death was a great loss.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
