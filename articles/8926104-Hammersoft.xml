This is the [[order of battle]] of German and Allied forces during the [[Battle of the Bulge]].

&lt;u&gt;''Caveat''&lt;/u&gt;: This Battle lasted more than a month, with assignments in considerable flux. Any hierarchy of unit within Corps within Army within Army Group is inherently a snapshot of a single moment in that flux. The hierarchy given here is at a moment nearly at the end of the Battle. To fully understand the hierarchy at any given moment in the Battle, you must not rely on this page alone. &lt;u&gt;For example&lt;/u&gt;, the hierarchy here places the U. S. 7th Armored Division in XVIII Corps in U. S. First Army in 12th Army Group. However, when the German attack began on 16 December 1944, the alignment of U. S. 7th Armored Division was (XIII Corps, U. S. Ninth Army, 12th Army Group). Later that day, the alignment became (VIII Corps, U. S. First Army, 12th Army Group). On 20 December, the alignment became (XVIII Corps, U. S. First Army, 12th Army Group) and on the same day (XVIII Corps, U. S. First Army, 21st Army Group). On 18 January 1945, the final alignment became (XVIII Corps, U. S. First Army, 12th Army Group) -- the alignment in the hierarchy given here.
