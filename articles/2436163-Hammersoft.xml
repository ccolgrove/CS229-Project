'''''Studio 23''''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] [[television network]] owned by the [[ABS-CBN Corporation]]. The network is named for its flagship station in [[Metro Manila]], [[DWAC-TV]], which is carried on UHF channel 23. The network is a sister network of the main channel, [[ABSâCBN]], airing programming aimed towards young adults, such as [[North American]] imports and other English-language programming, and original [[Filipino culture|Filipino]] programming aimed at the demographic as well, such as supplemental programming for ABS-CBN programs. This station studios are located at 3/F ABS-CBN Broadcast Center, Sgt. Esguerra Ave., Mother Ignacia St., [[Diliman]], [[Quezon City]].

==History==
At a planning session during the mid-1990s, ABS-CBN staff members were plotting out plans for a new UHF channel offering a more &quot;upscale&quot; alternative to the main ABS-CBN. This channel, was Studio 23. In the lead-up to the launch, ABS-CBN acquired the rights to many syndicated [[United States|US]] imports, such as [[Wheel of Fortune (US game show)|Wheel of Fortune]] and [[The Oprah Winfrey Show]].

The flagship station, [[DWAC-TV]] owned by the [[AMCARA Broadcasting Network]], signed on about a month before the launch of Studio 23, simulcasting [[MTV Southeast Asia|MTV Asia]]. Studio 23 was officially launched on October 12, 1996, but as a timeshare with MTV Asia aired during the daytime, with Studio 23 programming taking over in the primetime hours. The first program aired on launch night was the movie ''[[The Bodyguard]]''. Two days later on October 14, 1996, ''News 23'' premiered, Studio 23's news program produced by [[ABS-CBN News &amp; Current Affairs]]. On January 1, 2001, ABS-CBN severed their ties with MTV Asia, and Studio 23 gained total control of DWAC-TV. MTV moved to [[DWNB-TV]] after the change and relaunched as [[MTV Philippines]]. In 2003, Studio 23 had simulcasted with [[DWWX-TV|ABS-CBN Channel 2]] and it lasted within a few months.

Studio 23's programming has evolved from being &quot;upscale&quot; (as suggested by their previous slogan as the &quot;Premium Network&quot;), to aimed more at the youth and young adult demographics. The network still airs a multitude of US imports, but Studio 23 also airs original programming, such as spinoffs and supplemental programming for shows aired on the main ABS-CBN network, such as [[Pinoy Dream Academy]] and [[Pinoy Big Brother]]. The network has won numerous awards from various groups, such as a silver medal in the Print category at the 2006 [[Promax Awards]]. Its flagship program, the talk show [[Y Speak]], has also won numerous awards and accolades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://alpha.studio23.tv/tabid/65/Default.aspx Studio 23 About Us/History Via www.studio23.tv]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, The network rebranding it's network from English to Taglish/Tagalog used in 2004.
