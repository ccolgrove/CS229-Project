The '''Filesystem Hierarchy Standard''' ('''FHS''') defines the main directories and their contents in [[Linux]] [[operating system]]s.  For the most part, it is a formalization and extension of the traditional [[BSD]] [[Unix directory structure|filesystem hierarchy]].

The FHS is maintained by the [[Linux Foundation]], a non-profit organization consisting of major software and hardware vendors, such as [[HP]], [[Red Hat]], [[IBM]] and [[Dell]].

The current version is 2.3, announced on January 29, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=6704992 (ANNOUNCE) FHS 2.3 Released], From: Christopher Yeoh - 2004-01-29, Email Archive: freestandards-fhs-discuss (read-only), Free Standards Group, SourceForge.net&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Most [[Linux distribution]]s follow the FHS and declare it their own policy to maintain FHS compliance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Red Hat]] reference guide on [http://www.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/html/Deployment_Guide/s1-filesystem-fhs.html file system structure]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[SuSE Linux]] Enterprise Server Administration, Novell authorized courseware, by Jason W. Eckert, Novell; Course Technology, 2006; ISBN 1418837318, 9781418837310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Debian]] policy on [http://www.debian.org/doc/debian-policy/ch-opersys.html FHS compliance]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [https://help.ubuntu.com/community/LinuxFilesystemTreeOverview Linux File system Tree Overview] - Community Ubuntu Documentation&lt;/ref&gt;

When the FHS was created, other UNIX and [[Unix-like]] operating systems already had their own standards, notably the &lt;tt&gt;hier(7)&lt;/tt&gt; description of file system layout&lt;ref&gt;{{man|7|hier|FreeBSD}}&lt;/ref&gt; that has existed since the release of [[Version 7 Unix]] (in 1979), or the [[SunOS]] &lt;tt&gt;filesystem(7)&lt;/tt&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/man.cgi?query=filesystem&amp;manpath=SunOS+4.1.3 SunOS 4.1.3 manual page for filesystem(7)], dated 10 January 1988 (from the FreeBSD Man Pages library)&lt;/ref&gt; later [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] &lt;tt&gt;filesystem(5)&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{man|5|filesystem|Solaris}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://manpages.unixforum.co.uk/man-pages/unix/solaris-10-11_06/5/filesystem-man-page.html |title=filesystem man page - Solaris 10 11/06 Man Pages |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Linux distributions include a &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt; directory as a [[virtual filesystem]] ([[sysfs]], comparable to &lt;code&gt;/proc&lt;/code&gt;, which is a [[procfs]]), which stores and allows modification of the devices connected to the system, whereas many traditional UNIX and Unix-like operating systems use &lt;code&gt;/sys&lt;/code&gt; as a [[symbolic link]] to the [[Kernel (computing)|kernel]] source tree.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Some Linux systems such as [[GoboLinux]] and [[Syllable (operating system)|Syllable Server]] use a completely different approach from the FHS. {{Clarify|date=August 2011}}

== History ==
The process of developing a standard [[File system|filesystem]] hierarchy began in August 1993 with an effort to restructure the file and directory structure of [[Linux]]. The FSSTND (''Filesystem Standard''), a filesystem hierarchy standard specific to the Linux [[operating system]], was released on 14 February 1994. Subsequent revisions were released on 9 October 1994 and 28 March 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://garrett.damore.org/fsstnd/fsstnd.html The Linux Filesystem Standard], by Garrett D'Amore, Page 45-47 in Linux Journal, July 1995, Issue 15&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1996, the goal of developing a more comprehensive version of FSSTND to address not only Linux, but other [[Unix-like]] systems was adopted with the help of members of the [[BSD]] development community. As a result, a concerted effort was made to focus on issues that were general to Unix-like systems. In recognition of this widening of scope, the name of the standard was changed to Filesystem Hierarchy Standard.

==Directory structure==
In the FHS all files and [[directory (file systems)|directories]] appear under the [[root directory]] &quot;/&quot;, even if they are stored on different physical devices. Note however that some of these directories may or may not be present on a Unix system depending on whether certain subsystems, such as the [[X Window System]], are installed.

The majority of these directories exist in all UNIX operating systems and are generally used in much the same way; however, the descriptions here are those used specifically for the FHS, and are not considered authoritative for platforms other than Linux.

There has been controversy over the meaning of the name itself. In early versions of the UNIX Implementation Document from Bell labs, /etc is referred to as the ''[[et cetera|etcetera]] directory'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite manual|author=J. DeFelicc|title=Preliminary Release of UNIX Implementation Document|date=1972-03-17|id=IMO.1-1|section=E.0|page=8|issue=D|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/bellLabs/unix/PreliminaryUnixImplementationDocument_Jun72.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; as this directory historically held everything that did not belong elsewhere (however, the FHS restricts /etc to static configuration files and may not contain binaries).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pathname.com/fhs/pub/fhs-2.3.html#ETCHOSTSPECIFICSYSTEMCONFIGURATION&lt;/ref&gt; Since the publication of early documentation, the directory name has been re-designated in various ways.

Most of the time &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local/&lt;/tt&gt; is used for installing software/data that are ''not'' part of the standard operating system distribution (in such case, &lt;tt&gt;/usr/&lt;/tt&gt; would only contain software/data that ''are'' part of the standard operating system distribution).
