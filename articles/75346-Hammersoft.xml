'''Beverly Hills''' is an affluent city located in [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States. With a population of 34,109 at the 2010 census, up from 33,784 as of the 2000 census, it is home to numerous Hollywood celebrities.  Beverly Hills and the neighboring city of [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]] are together entirely surrounded by the city of [[Los Angeles]]. To be specific, Beverly Hills is bordered on the northwest by the Los Angeles neighborhood of [[Bel Air, Los Angeles, California|Bel-Air]] and the [[Santa Monica Mountains]], on the east by West Hollywood, the [[Carthay]] neighborhood of Los Angeles, and the [[Fairfax District, Los Angeles, California|Fairfax District]] of Los Angeles, and on the south by the [[Beverlywood, Los Angeles, California|Beverlywood]]. The area's &quot;[[Platinum Triangle, Los Angeles|Platinum Triangle]]&quot; of affluent neighborhoods is formed by the city of Beverly Hills and the Los Angeles neighborhoods of Bel Air and [[Holmby Hills, Los Angeles, California|Holmby Hills]].

==History==
===18th century===
[[Gaspar de PortolÃ ]]'s land expedition arrived in the area on August 3, 1769. The group consisted of PortolÃ  (the first [[governor]] of the province of California), some [[Franciscan]] priests and a cavalcade of leather-jacket soldiers and horses. On September 27, 1821,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bachfestival.org/ ''September 27, 1821'']&lt;/ref&gt; [[New Spain]] became Mexico and the province of California quietly changed flags.

That same decade, retired Spanish soldier Vicente Ferrer Valdez and his wife, Maria Rita Villa de Valdez, settled on the {{convert|4500|acre|km2}} ''[[Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas]]''. Rita did not care for the name, however, and chose to call it ''San Antonio''. The Valdez [[adobe]] home was built near what is the present-day intersection of Sunset Boulevard and Alpine Drive. Valdez died in 1828, leaving Rita and eleven children.

===19th century===
California was ceded by Mexico to the United States in 1848 with the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], marking the end of the Mexican-American War. It was admitted as a U.S. state on September 9, 1850.

In 1852 Maria Rita Valdez De Villa asked to purchase a league of land for $4,000. She called the land Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas. It was later purchased by Major [[Henry Hancock]] (of [[Hancock Park]] fame), a New Hampshire attorney. He had come to the state during the 1849 gold rush. He used the land as a farm until 1868, when Dr. Edward Preuss, a native of [[Louisville, Kentucky]], bought the land.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificislandtravel.com/north_america/western_usa/california/la_beverlyhills.html History of Beverly Hills].&lt;/ref&gt;

A brief [[petroleum|oil]] boom raised interest in the area in 1865 when the [[Pioneer Oil Company]] bought the rights to drill wells.

===20th century===

On October 22, 1906, the community of Beverly Hills was declared open by the Percy H. Clark Co., managers of the tract of land. It was described as a &quot;beautiful suburban residence between this city Los Angeles and Santa Monica.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;1906latimes&quot;&gt;BEVERLY HILLS. (1906, October 21). Los Angeles Times, V1. Retrieved 2008-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The community was designed to allow the buyers to build a custom house on the land they purchased in the new development. The Rodeo Land and Water Company (Burton Green) decided to name it Beverly Hills after [[Beverly Farms]] in [[Beverly, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.beverlyhills.org/about/radio/default.asp History of Beverly Hills]. Retrieved 2010-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, the land was known as the Hammel and Denker ranch, which was one of Southern California's most fertile lands for growing [[lima beans]].&lt;ref name=&quot;1906latimes&quot;/&gt; As an area bounded today by Wilshire Boulevard to the south, the foothills just above Sunset Boulevard to the north, Whittier Drive on the west, and Doheny Drive to the east, Hammel and Denker ranch was part of the [[land grant]] known as [[Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas|El Rodeo de Las Aguas]] (the Ranch of the Gathering Waters) and was purchased in 1906 by a syndicate of [[railroad]] [[magnate]] [[Henry E. Huntington]], oil tycoon [[Charles A. Canfield]], W G. Kerckhoff, W. S. Porter, Burton M. Green, and real estate developer [[Max Whittier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Neighborly Advise.

The investment company marketed Beverly Hills as &quot;between the city and the sea.&quot;

In September, 1911, work began on the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]]. The Los Angeles Times would call it a &quot;monster hostelry&quot; since it cost $300,000.&lt;ref&gt;WORK STARTS WITH RUSH ON MONSTER HOSTELRY :Great Tourist Hostelry for Beautiful Site Between the City and the Sea. (1911, September 23). Los Angeles Times, p. I14. Retrieved 2008-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, lots were selling for around $2,000 each.&lt;ref&gt;BEVERLY HILLS SALES. (1911, December 17). Los Angeles Times, p. V28. Retrieved 2008-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1919, [[Douglas Fairbanks]] and [[Mary Pickford]] bought land on Summit Drive and built ''[[Pickfair]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;beverlyhills.pro&quot;&gt;[http://www.beverlyhills.pro/beverly_hills_history_middle_years/ Beverly Hills Middle Years]. Retrieved 2010-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1921, they announced that they would build the home that they had been &quot;dreaming&quot; about in Beverly Hills.&lt;ref&gt;THREE NEW HOMES FOR FAIRBANKS :Husband of Mary Pickford to Build at Beverly Hills, Santa Barbara, Lake Como.. (1921, January 11). The Los Angeles Times, II1. Retrieved 2008-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Will Rogers]], a wisecracking political humorist, wrote of the land boom in 1923, &quot;Lots are sold so quickly and often out here that they put through [[escrow]] made out to the 12th owner... They couldn't possibly make out a separate deed for each purchaser; besides, he wouldn't have time to read it in the 10 minutes' time he owned the land.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The movie colony was well entrenched by 1928 when [[Harold Lloyd]] ([[Harold Lloyd Estate|'Greenacres']]), [[John Barrymore]], [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]], and [[Miriam Hopkins]] built residences there.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The population in 1920 was 674; in 1924, it was 5,000; by 1930, it was 17,429.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodusa.co.uk&quot;&gt;[http://www.hollywoodusa.co.uk/beverlyhills.htm The History of Beverly Hills]. Retrieved 2010-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The issuance of building permits in 1918 totaled $35,200; in 1919, $304,900; in 1921, $787,729; 1922, $1,838,994.&lt;ref name=&quot;beverlyhills.pro&quot;/&gt;

In early 1920, the [[Beverly Hills Speedway]], a {{convert|1.25|mi|km|1}} wood oval track with turns banked 35 degrees was opened. Joe Boyer ran his race car {{convert|110|mph|km/h|1}} during the exhibition run.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The races drew huge crowds and [[Radio programming|radio]] broadcasts were on a par with today's [[Indianapolis 500]]. There were also [[aviation]] shows, another national craze. The speedway was closed in 1924 and the site was later subdivided for housing and businesses.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

In 1923, annexation to the city of Los Angeles was proposed, but faced opposition. Residents Mary Pickford, Will Rogers and others mobilized local voters against the plan.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} Those for annexation argued that Los Angeles would provide an adequate supply of better quality water for growth. Workers left bottles of sulfur-smelling water on the doorsteps of every home in Beverly Hills with a label that read: &quot;Warning. Drink sparingly of this water as it has laxative qualities.&quot; Despite the campaign tactics, annexation was defeated 507 to 337.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The following year, the city voted $400,000 in bonds to purchase the water system from the Beverly Hills Utilities Company and drill additional wells.

This fight for an independent city was arguably the first union of show business and politics in the United States. {{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} When Will Rogers became involved in the local city government the community received international advertising. In 1925, Rogers was given the title &quot;Honorary Mayor of Beverly Hills,&quot; becoming the first and (to date) only person so honored as such. The same year, the citizens of the city voted a $100,000 bond issue to purchase with Los Angeles, Santa Monica and [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]] {{convert|385|acre|km2|1}} for the building of [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. There were {{convert|96|mi|km|1}} of paved streets in the city limits by 1927. In 1928, the [[Beverly-Wilshire Hotel]] on Wilshire Boulevard between El Camino and Rodeo Drives, part of the old Beverly Hills Speedway, was completed. That same year, [[Greystone Mansion]] was completed by Edward L. Doheny, Jr., the only son and heir of wealthy oil man [[Edward L. Doheny]]. And, in 1930, horses were banned in the City of Beverly Hills.

In the early 1930s, Santa Monica Park was renamed [[Beverly Gardens Park|Beverly Gardens]] and was extended to span the entire two-mile (3-kilometer) length of Santa Monica Boulevard through the city. At its Santa Monica and Wilshire corner, the [[Electric Fountain]], a constant symphony of form and color at night, was installed, with a small sculpture at the top of a [[Tongva people|Tongva]] kneeling in prayer, homage to the heritage of Beverly Hills as a wellspring of fertility and abundance.

In April 1931, the new [[Italian Renaissance]]-style City Hall was opened.&lt;ref&gt;Wanamaker, Marc. Beverly Hills: 1930â2005. p. 9 ISBN 0095299717441999&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1933, the effects of the [[Great Depression|Depression]] were being felt in Beverly Hills. The city and school board cut salaries to save funds. In February, some 161 parcels of land were advertised for sale for delinquent lighting assessments. The Chamber of Commerce established an employment bureau, and the mayor requested a branch welfare office from the County of Los Angeles.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} By 1937, the city had weathered the storm of the Depression and was riding the crest of a wave of retail sales that reached more than $20,000,000, and bank deposits topped the $25,000,000 figure. Property values of that year showed a 30% increase over the previous year.&lt;ref name=&quot;hollywoodusa.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

By the 1950s, small vacant lots remained and developers cropped whole mountains to ease the housing shortage. The stables and trails of the unusually large Doheny family estate; Greystone Mansion was bought by Paul Trousdale. The Trousdale Estates area was eventually annexed and an expensive housing development began to take shape in the hills above the city.  Today Trousdale Estates is an enclave for Hollywood celebrities and media moguls.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.modernluxury.com/style/trousdale-estates-beverly-hills-enclave]. August 2010 http://www.modernluxury.com/style/trousdale-estates-beverly-hills-enclave.&lt;/ref&gt;

Beverly Hills marketed itself as one of the most glamorous places in the world to [[shopping|shop]].  The Golden Triangle, with [[Rodeo Drive]] at its center, was marketed as the apex of [[Chic (style)|chic]] shopping and [[fashion]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.westside-la.org/beverlyhills.html Westside Economic Collaborative â Beverly Hills]. Retrieved 2010-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Via Rodeo was completed in 1990. The Spanish [[cobblestone]] street leads to 2 Rodeo Drive, a &quot;mini-mall&quot; with upscale shops and restaurants. In 1992, the Beverly Hills Civic Center was opened. Designed by [[architect]] [[Charles Willard Moore|Charles Moore]], it links the new public library, fire department, and police department with the historic City Hall.

Rodeo Drive, Beverly Drive, and Canon Drive all recently underwent construction to widen the [[sidewalks]] and beautify the streets. New construction that added more [[parking lot|parking]] for visitors to the famed shopping area has also just been completed.

==Geography==

Beverly Hills is nearly entirely surrounded by the city of Los Angeles, sharing only a portion of its eastern border, primarily along Doheny Drive, with [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]]. The precise limits of Beverly Hills are complex, and therefore hard to describe; however, the city limits can be roughly described as the area surrounded by the Los Angeles Country Club and Century Park Drive to the Southwest, Whitworth Drive to the South, at various points Doheny Drive/Robertson Blvd/San Vicente Blvd to the East, and the Hollywood Hills to the North.

Major east-west thoroughfares in Beverly Hills include [[Wilshire Boulevard]], [[Santa Monica Boulevard]], and [[Sunset Boulevard]]. Shopping is prevalent along Beverly Drive and the world-famous [[Rodeo Drive]]. Coldwater Canyon Drive is the main road out of Beverly Hills to the north into the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Beverly Drive and Roberston Blvd are the primary roads exiting the city to the south. Beverly Hills is one of the few cities in the Los Angeles area that is not directly served by a freeway.

In spite of the city's name, most residents live in the &quot;flats&quot; of Beverly Hills, a relatively flat land that includes all of Beverly Hills south of Sunset Blvd. The houses in the hills north of Sunset Boulevard have a much higher value than average houses in the rest of Beverly Hills, and the most expensive houses in Beverly Hills are all in the hills. Santa Monica Boulevard divides the &quot;flats&quot; into two areas, locally known as &quot;North or South of the tracks,&quot; referring to the train tracks that were once used by the old [[Pacific Electric]] streetcar line that traversed Beverly Hills along Santa Monica Blvd. Houses south of Wilshire have more urban square and rectangular lots, in general smaller than those to the north. There are also more apartment buildings south of Wilshire Blvd than anywhere else in Beverly Hills, and the average house value south of Wilshire is the lowest in Beverly Hills.

Nearly all businesses and government offices in Beverly Hills are located south of Santa Monica Boulevard, two notable exceptions being the [[Beverly Hills Hotel]] and the [[Beverly Hilton Hotel]]. Just outside the city limits to the west lies the [[Los Angeles Country Club]]. Other locations commonly associated with Beverly Hills include the [[Cedars-Sinai Medical Center]] and the [[Beverly Center]], just outside city limits to the east.
