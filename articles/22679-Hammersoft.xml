The '''Office of Strategic Services''' ('''OSS''') was a [[United States]] [[intelligence agency]] formed during [[World War II]]. It was the wartime intelligence agency, and it was a predecessor of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA). The OSS was formed in order to coordinate [[espionage]] activities behind enemy lines for the branches of the [[United States Armed Forces]].

==Origins and activities==
Prior to the formation of the OSS (the American version of the British [[Secret Intelligence Service]] and [[Special Operations Executive]]), American intelligence had been conducted on an ad-hoc basis by the various departments of the executive branch, including the [[United States Department of State|State]], [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]], [[United States Department of the Navy|Navy]], and [[United States Department of War|War]] Departments. They had no overall direction, coordination, or control. The [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] had separate code-breaking departments ([[Signals Intelligence Service]] and [[OP-20-G]]). Also, the original code-breaking operation of the State Department, [[Black Chamber|MI-8]], run by [[Herbert Yardley]], had been shut down in 1929 by [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Henry Stimson]], deeming it an inappropriate function for the diplomatic arm, because &quot;gentlemen don't read each other's mail&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Stimson, Henry L. ''On Active Service in Peace and War'' (1948). ''per'' ''Bartlett's Familiar Quotations'', 16th ed.&lt;/ref&gt; 

President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] was concerned about American intelligence deficiencies. On the suggestion of Canadian/British spymaster [[William Stephenson]], the senior British intelligence officer in the western hemisphere, Roosevelt requested that [[William J. Donovan]] draft a plan for an intelligence service. Colonel Donovan was employed to evaluate the global military position in order to offer suggestions concerning American intelligence requirements because the U.S. did not have a central intelligence agency. After submitting his work, &quot;Memorandum of Establishment of Service of Strategic Information,&quot; Colonel Donovan was appointed as the &quot;Co-ordinator of Information&quot; in July 1941.

The Office of Strategic Services was established by a Presidential military order issued by President Roosevelt on June 13, 1942, to collect and analyze strategic information required by the [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and to conduct special operations not assigned to other agencies. During the War, the OSS supplied policy makers with facts and estimates, but the OSS never had jurisdiction over all foreign intelligence activities. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] was responsible for intelligence work in [[Latin America]], and the Army and Navy guarded their areas of responsibility.

From 1943â1945, the OSS played a major role in training [[Kuomintang]] troops in [[China]] and [[Burma]], and recruited [[Jingpo people|Kachin]], and other indigenous irregular forces for sabotage as well as guides for Allied forces in [[China Burma India Theater of World War II|Burma]] fighting the Japanese Army.  Among other activities, the OSS helped arm, train and supply [[resistance movement]]s, including [[Mao Zedong]]'s [[People's Liberation Army|Red Army]] in China and the [[Viet Minh]] in [[French Indochina]], in areas [[military occupation|occupied]] by the [[Axis powers]] during [[World War II]]. The OSS also recruited and ran one of the war's most important spies, the German diplomat [[Fritz Kolbe]]. Other functions of the OSS included the use of [[propaganda]], [[espionage]], [[subversion]], and post-war planning.

The OSS purchased Soviet code and cipher material (or Finnish information on them) from Ã©migrÃ© [[Finnish army]] officers in late 1944. Secretary of State [[Edward Stettinius, Jr.]], protested that this violated an agreement President Roosevelt made with the Soviet Union not to interfere with Soviet cipher traffic from the United States. General Donovan might have copied the papers before returning them the following January, but there is no record of [[Arlington Hall]]'s receiving them, and CIA and NSA archives have no surviving copies. This codebook was in fact used as part of the [[Venona]] [[decryption]] effort, which helped uncover large-scale Soviet espionage in [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Andrew (historian)|Andrew, Christopher]] and [[Vasili Mitrokhin|Mitrokhin, Vasili]], ''The Mitrokhin Archive, Volume 1: The KGB in Europe and the West'', 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the greatest accomplishments of the OSS during World War II was its penetration of [[Nazi Germany]] by OSS operatives. The OSS was responsible for training German and Austrian individuals for missions inside Germany. Some of these agents included exiled communists and Socialist party members, labor activists, anti-Nazi prisoners-of-war, and German and Jewish refugees. At the height of its influence during World War II, the OSS employed almost 24,000 people.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2008/US/08/14/spies.revealed.ap/index.html &quot;Chef Julia Child, others part of WWII spy network&quot;], [[CNN]], 2008-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:George Musulin.jpg|thumb|225px|OSS 1st Lieutenant [[George Musulin]] behind enemy lines in German-occupied Serbia, as Chetnik, during his first mission on November 1943. His second misson was [[Operation Halyard|Halyard]]]]

In 1943, the Office of Strategic Services set up operations in Istanbul.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hassell, A page 158&quot;&gt;Hassell and McCrae, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey, as a neutral country during the Second World War, was a place where both the Axis and Allied powers sought to set up networks of spies. The railroads connecting [[central Asia]] with [[Europe]] as well as Turkey's close proximity to the Balkan states placed it at a crossroads of intelligence gathering. The goal of the OSS Istanbul operation called Project Net-1 was to infiltrate and extenuate subversive action in the old Ottoman and [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hassell, A page 158&quot;/&gt;

Head of operations at OSS Istanbul was a banker from Chicago named Lanning &quot;Packy&quot; Macfarland who maintained the cover story as a banker for the American [[lend-lease program]].&lt;ref&gt;Hassell and MacRae, p.159&lt;/ref&gt; Macfarland hired Alfred Schwarz, a Czechoslovakian engineer and businessman who came to be known as &quot;Dogwood&quot; and ended up establishing the notorious Dogwood information chain.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hassell, A page 166&quot;&gt;Hassell and MacRae, p.166&lt;/ref&gt; Dogwood in turn hired a personal assistant named Walter Arndt and established himself as an employee of the Istanbul Western Electrik Kompani.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hassell, A page 166&quot;/&gt; Through Schwartz and Arndt the OSS was able to infiltrate [[anti-fascist]] groups in Austria, Hungary and Germany. Schwartz was able to convince Romanian, Bulgarian, Hungarian and Swiss diplomatic couriers to smuggle American intelligence information into these territories and establish contact with elements antagonistic to the Nazis and their collaborators.&lt;ref&gt;Hassell and MacRae, p.167&lt;/ref&gt; Couriers and agents memorized information and produced analytical reports; when they were not able to memorize effectively they recorded information on [[microfilm]] and hid it in their shoes or hollowed pencils.&lt;ref name=rubin&gt;Rubin, B: ''Istanbul Intrigues'', page 168. Pharos Books, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Through this process information about the Nazi regime made its way to Macfarland and the OSS in Istanbul and eventually to Washington.

While the OSS &quot;Dogwood-chain&quot; produced a lot of information, its reliability was increasingly questioned by British intelligence. Eventually by May 1944 through collaboration between the OSS, British intelligence, Cairo and Washington the entire &quot;Dogwood-chain&quot; was found to be unreliable and dangerous.&lt;ref name=rubin /&gt; Planting phony information into the OSS was intended to misdirect the resources of the Allies. Schwartz's &quot;Dogwood â chain&quot; which was the largest American intelligence gathering tool in occupied territory, was shortly thereafter shut down.&lt;ref&gt;Hassell and MacRae, p.184&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1942, a young physician named Christian J. Lambertsen invented the first [[Scuba set|Self-contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus]] (SCUBA) and demonstrated it to OSS &amp;ndash; after already being rejected by the U.S. Navy &amp;ndash; in a pool at a hotel in Washington D.C.&lt;ref name=cjl&gt;Shapiro, T. Rees. [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/18/AR2011021802873.html &quot;Christian J. Lambertsen, OSS officer who created early scuba device, dies at 93&quot;]. ''[[Washington Post]]'' (February 18, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; The OSS not only bought into the concept, they hired Lambertsen to lead the program and build up the dive element of their maritime unit.&lt;ref name=cjl /&gt;

==Transformation into the CIA==
One month after the war was won in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations]], on September 20, 1945, the 33rd U.S. President [[Harry S Truman]] signed an [[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]] which came into effect as of October 1, 1945. Thus in the following days from September 20, 1945 the functions of the OSS were split between the [[Department of State]] and the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]]. The State Department received the Research and Analysis Branch of OSS which was renamed the Interim Research and Intelligence Service or ([[IRIS]]) and headed by U.S. Army Colonel Alfred McCormack. This was later renamed the [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]].

The War Department took over the [[Secret Intelligence Branch|Secret Intelligence]] (SI) and [[counter-espionage|Counter-Espionage]] (X-2) Branches, which were then housed in a new office created for just this purposeâthe [[Strategic Services Unit]] (SSU). The Secretary of War appointed Brigadier General [[John Magruder (Brigadier General)|John Magruder]] (formerly Donovan's Deputy Director for Intelligence in OSS) as the director to oversee the liquidation of the OSS, and more importantly, the preservation of the clandestine intelligence capability of the OSS.

In January 1946, President Truman created the Central Intelligence Group (CIG) which was the direct precursor to the CIA. The assets of the SSU, which now constituted a streamlined &quot;nucleus&quot; of clandestine intelligence was transferred to the CIG in mid-1946 and reconstituted as the Office of Special Operations (OSO). Next, the [[National Security Act of 1947]] established the United States's first permanent peacetime intelligence agency, the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which then took up the functions of the OSS.  The direct descendant of the paramilitary component of the OSS is the [[Special Activities Division]] of the CIA.&lt;ref&gt;Waller, Douglas &quot;CIA's Secret Army&quot;, ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
[[Prince William Forest Park]] (then known as Chopawamsic Recreational Demonstration Area) was the site of an OSS training camp that operated from 1942 to 1945. Area &quot;C&quot;, consisting of approximately {{convert|6,000|acre|km2}}, was used extensively for communications training, whereas Area &quot;A&quot; was use for training some of the OGs.  [[Catoctin Mountain Park]], now the location of [[Camp David]], was the site of OSS training Area &quot;B.&quot; [[Congressional Country Club]] (Area F) in [[Bethesda, Maryland|Bethesda]], MD was the primary OSS training facility.

The [[London]] branch of the OSS, its first overseas facility, was at 70, Grosvenor Street, W1. 
 
The Facilities of the [[Catalina Island Marine Institute]] at Toyon Bay on Santa Catalina Island, Calif., are composed (in part) of a former OSS survival training camp.

The National Park Service commissioned a study of OSS National Park training facilities by Professor John Chambers of Rutgers University.

[[Camp X]], near [[Oshawa]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], where an &quot;assassination and elimination&quot; training program was operated by the OSS. It was dubbed &quot;the school of mayhem and murder&quot; by George Hunter White who trained at the facility in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Albarelli, H.A.

==Personnel==
The names of all OSS personnel and documents of their OSS service, previously a closely guarded secret, were released by the US [[National Archives and Records Administration|National Archives]] on August 14, 2008.  Among the 24,000 names were those of [[Julia Child]], [[Arthur Goldberg]], [[Saul K. Padover]], [[Arthur Schlesinger, Jr.]], [[Bruce Sundlun]], and [[John Ford]].&lt;ref name=cnn /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackledge, Brett J. and Herschaft, Randy [http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080814/ap_on_go_ot/spies_revealed  , &quot;Documents: Julia Child part of WW II-era spy ring&quot;], [[Associated Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;  The 750,000 pages in the 35,000 personnel files include applications of people who were not recruited or hired, as well as the service records of those who were.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archives.gov/research/arc/topics/oss-personnel/ Office of Strategic Services Personnel Files from World War II] â overview page, search links, digital excerpts;
