===Dances and ballets===
In 1969, she formed her own company, Twyla Tharp Dance. Her work often utilizes [[classical music]], [[jazz]] and contemporary [[pop music]]. From 1971 to 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance performed original works around the world. 

In 1973, Tharp choreographed ''Deuce Coupe'' to the music of [[The Beach Boys]] for the [[Joffrey Ballet]].  ''Deuce Coupe'' is considered to be the first crossover ballet. Later she choreographed ''Push Comes To Shove'' (1976), which featured [[Mikhail Baryshnikov]] and is now thought to be the best example of the crossover ballet. 

In 1988, Twyla Tharp Dance merged with [[American Ballet Theatre]], since which time ABT has held the world premieres of sixteen of Tharp's works.

After this record setting run in California, the New York show ran for 35 previews and 28 performances. 

In 2009, Tharp worked with the songs of [[Frank Sinatra]] to mount ''Come Fly With Me'', which ran at the [[Alliance Theater]] in Atlanta and was the best selling four-week run as of the date of closing in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Marketing Statement from [[Alliance Theater]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Renamed ''[[Come Fly Away]]''  the show opened on Broadway in 2010 at the  [[Marquis Theatre]] in New York and ran for 26 previews and 188 performances.

&quot;When I go into a studio I know exactly what I want, but never know quite how I'll get it. Each dance is a mystery story.&quot;
