Tantawi, who is a [[Nubian people|Nubian]] Egyptian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=53688 Egypt State Information Service (Official Egyptian government website)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:foPGOMDLdxUJ:www.egypttoday.com/printerfriendly.aspx%3FArticleID%3D1640+Mohamed+Hussein+Tantawi+nubian&amp;cd=30&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=uk&amp;source=www.google.co.uk Paradise Lost] Egypt Today (Google cached version)&lt;/ref&gt; received his commission as a military officer on April 1, 1956 serving in the infantry.

In 1991 he also commanding an Egyptian army unit in the U.S.-led [[Gulf War]] against [[Iraq]] to force it to withdraw from Kuwait, which it invaded in 1990.

On May 20, 1991, following the dismissal of Lt. General Youssef Sabri Abu Taleb,&lt;ref&gt;[http://thetruthpublication.blogspot.com/2011/02/mubarak-steps-down-informed-vice.html The Truth Publication Online (2011-02-11)]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tantawi was appointed as Minister of Defense and Military Production and commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Armed Forces. He was also appointed as [[Field Marshal]]. It is believed that Tantawi would have succeeded Mubarak as president of Egypt, had the [[Hosni Mubarak#Assassination attempts|assassination attempt in June 1995]] been successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sobelman |first=Daniel |year=2001 |title=Gamal Mubarak, President of Egypt? |journal=Middle East Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=31â40 |doi= |url=http://www.meforum.org/27/gamal-mubarak-president-of-egypt }}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 2011, Tantawi was seen as a possible contender for the Egyptian presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrison&quot; /&gt;

==2011 Egyptian Revolution==

On February 11, 2011 when President [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned, after 18 days of protests from the Egyptian people, he transferred authority to the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]], headed by Tantawi. The council, overseeing issues with the Chairman of the [[Supreme Constitutional Court of Egypt|Supreme Constitutional Court]], [[Farouk Sultan]], have since dissolved the Egyptian parliament,&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/egypt-trades-torture-supervisor-mubaraks-poodle/story?id=12895439 Egypt Trades Torture Supervisor for 'Mubarak's Poodle'?] ABC News, February 11 2011&lt;/ref&gt; overseen the [[Egyptian constitutional referendum, 2011|referendum over temporary constitutional amendments]] take place on March 19, and have presided over the accountability of Mubarak and many of the former regime's top figures summons to justice.

On a personal level, Tantawi had kept a relatively low profile since the handing over of power to the Council, only making a first public appearance in an address to mark the graduation of a batch at the Police Academy on 16 May 2011. He has opted to leave most public speeches  and press releases to other senior members in the council, he also appointed  [[Prime Minister of Egypt| Prime Minister]] [[Essam Sharaf]] and his [[Cabinet of Egypt|cabinet]]. Tantawi has also received a number of foreign officials, including British [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[David Cameron]] and [[United States Secretary of State| US Secretary of State]] [[Hillary Clinton]].

After a new series of protests in November 2011, that escalated by 22nd November to over 33 dead and over 2,000 injured in the wake of the use of force by the police to quell protests at [[Tahrir Square]] and its vicinity, Tantawi appeared on Egyptian national television to pledge the speeding up of presidential elections - the principal demand of protesters - and that the armed forces &quot;are fully prepared to immediately hand over power and to return to their original duty in protecting the homeland if that what they people want, through a popular referendum if necessary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-15843425 Egypt military pledges to speed up power transfer] BBC News, 22 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;
