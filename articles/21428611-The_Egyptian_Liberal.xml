The '''State of Law Coalition''' ({{lang-ar|Ø¥Ø¦ØªÙØ§Ù Ø¯ÙÙØ© Ø§ÙÙØ§ÙÙÙ}}''I'tilÄf Dawlat al-QÄnÅ«n'') also known as '''Rule of Law Coalition'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.presstv.com/detail.aspx?id=126481&amp;sectionid=351020201&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Iraq]]i political coalition formed for the [[Iraqi governorate elections, 2009]] by [[Prime Minister of Iraq]], [[Nouri al-Maliki]] and his [[Islamic Dawa Party]].

The name was an emphasis on the improved security situation which Maliki's government had achieved through the [[Battle of Basra (2008)|Battle of Basra]] and other operations of the Iraqi Security Forces.

Due to disagreements with the [[Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq]] and the [[Sadrists]], the Dawa Party decided not to join the [[Iraqi National Alliance]] for the [[Iraqi parliamentary election, 2010]], but run in their own coalition: the State of Law Coalition.
