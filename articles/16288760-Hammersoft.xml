The figure of the prancing (or [[Attitude_(heraldry)#Rampant|rampant]] in heraldry) [[white horse]] can also be referred to as '''Invicta''', which is the [[Invicta (motto)|motto of Kent]].&lt;ref name=BBC7880889&gt;{{cite web

|quote=A prancing white horse is the logo for the county council and has been the symbol of Kent for hundreds of years. However, a sculpture of the Invicta, supported by Kent County Council in response to Mr Wallinger's entry, was rejected by judges last year.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The white [[horse]] of Kent is the old symbol for the [[Jutes|Jutish]] [[kingdom of Kent]], dating from the 6th - 8th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hampshireflag.co.uk/world-flags/allflags/gb-kent.html www.hampshireflag.co.uk] Coat of Arms&lt;/ref&gt;

The white horse relates to the emblem of [[Horsa]], the brother of [[Hengest]], who defeated the King [[Vortigern]] near [[Aylesford]]. The first recorded reference to the white horse can be found in ''Restitution of Decayed Antiquities'' from [[1605]] by [[Richard Verstegan]]. The book shows an engraving of Hengist and Horsa landing in Kent in [[449]] under the banner of a rampant white horse. Indeed, continental origins of this emblem can be found from the coat of arms of [[Lower Saxony]], the Dutch region of [[Twente]], the [[House of Welf]] (who adapted it in the late 14th century; before then the Welf coat of arms was a golden lion on red ground) and the modern German State of [[North Rhine-Westphalia]]: the [[Saxon Steed]]. Some historians note that [[Jutes]] migrating to Kent through the continent may have been associated with the [[Rhineland]] south of the Saxons.

==Usage==
The horse is a key part of the official [[coat of arms]] of the county, and appears on the coat of arms of many of the Boroughs of Kent&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civicheraldry.co.uk/kent.html www.civicheraldry.co.uk] Kent Borough Council coats of arms&lt;/ref&gt; and on the [[University of Kent#Coat of arms|University of Kent coat of arms]]. The horse is depicted on the [[Flag of Kent]] and forms part of the modern logos of [[Kent County Council]], the [[Kent Fire and Rescue Service]] and the [[Kent Police]].

The horse also features on the logos of many companies and sports teams in Kent. It was used on the former ''[[Invictaway]]'' London commuter coaches operated by [[Maidstone &amp; District]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nationalbusco.fotopic.net/p12901490.html Image of a black liveried Invictaway bus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://flickr.com/photos/andytakersdad/1472885872/in/set-72157601795326096/ Image of a green liveried Invictaway bus]&lt;/ref&gt; A large number of [[pubs]] in the county also feature ''White Horse'' in their name, although this also occurs around the [[United Kingdom]] and may not necessarily relate to the Kent horse.
