Founded under the auspices of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church]] and with the support of prominent residents of Middletown, the now secular university was the first institution of higher education to be named after [[John Wesley]], the founder of [[Methodism]]. About twenty unrelated colleges and universities were subsequently named after Wesley. Wesleyan, along with [[Amherst College|Amherst]] and [[Williams College|Williams]] Colleges, is a member of the historic [[Little Three]] colleges and has long been known as one of the [[Little Ivies]].

The original core buildings of the campus were North College and South College. North College was a [[Nassau Hall]]-type building seen in most early American college campuses, but it was replaced after a fire in 1909 with the current North College. South College is the sole building from the beginning of the college. These two buildings were the first two in a line of six later called 'College Row', facing an expanse of lawn, (the campus), and a broad view of the Connecticut Valley below. The other buildings of College row include the recently renovated Memorial Chapel, which was planned in commemoration of the bicentennial of Methodism, the original college library, now a theater, and Judd Hall. Adjacent to College row, Olin Library, Harriman Hall, Shanklin Hall, and the former Hall Chemistry Building were designed by the architectural firm of [[McKim, Mead, and White]] as a set (with Clark Hall and a never built sixth building) to form a quadrangle.

The northern end of High Street contains several large buildings which were former private residences a few of which were exceptional architectural examples. These include [[Samuel Wadsworth Russell House|Russell House]], a [[National Historic Landmark]], two Alsop family houses, (one is currently the African-American Studies center with student housing, the other is the [[Davison Art Center]]), the Davison infirmary, a second Russell family house that contains the University Development Office, and Downey House, (remembered fondly by alumni as the onetime main campus dining facility and pub, now classrooms and academic offices). There are other departmental offices in the neighborhood. High Street, which is the old center of campus, was once described by [[Charles Dickens]] as &quot;the most beautiful street in America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20070924182431/http://www.wesleyan.edu/175/wesfacts.html Did You Know / WesFact #1: High Street], Wesleyan University.

===Butterfield Colleges===
====College of Social Studies====
The [[College of Social Studies]] (CSS) was founded in 1959, combining the fields of history, economics, government, and philosophy. It emphasizes intellectual independence and collaborative and social ties between faculty and students. Students take 5.5 of the program's 10.5 (thesis-writing students take 11.5) required credits during their sophomore year. Sophomore year focuses on the development of modern Western society from historical, economic, social and political perspectives, and culminates with comprehensive final exams. Junior year has a more global focus, while Seniors are required to write an Honors thesis (full year) or a Senior Essay.  The program is known for its collegial spirit and academic rigor.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/css/ Program Description], College of Social Studies, Wesleyan University. Retrieved 18 February 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

====College of Letters====
The College of Letters (COL) combines the study of history, literature, philosophy, and a foreign language of the student's choice. The program has a primary focus on the Western canon.  Undertaking a chronological study that progresses from antiquities to modernity, COL students take one colloquium together each semester and study abroad for the second semester of their sophomore year; they are expected to be at an intermediate level of study in their language of choice at the time they enter the program as sophomores.  During their junior year students prepare for intensive comprehensive examinations on the three colloquia taken up to this point. During their senior year students must write a thesis (full year paper) or an essay (half year paper).&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/col/overview.html College of Letters: Cultivating the âeducated imaginationâ], Wesleyan University.

====College of the Environment====
The College of the Environment (COE), created in 2009, integrates the following components: 1) a curricular component, including the newly established environmental studies major, the environmental studies certificate, and a senior capstone project; 2) a [[Think Tank]] of Wesleyan faculty, scholars of prominence, and undergraduates whose aim is to produce scholarly work that will influence national and international thinking and action on critical environmental issues; and 3) the Collaborative Research Initiative (CRI), which is designed to encourage COE majors with the most potential to undertake environmental research. The threefold goal of the CRI combines: a) preparing students for senior research work; b) recruiting students of exceptional skill for participation in the COE Think Tank; and c) preparing students for research careers in environmental studies, as well as facilitating internships (non-credit) to provide students with research opportunities and &quot;real world&quot; experience (e.g., internships with governmental organizations, NGO's, and businesses, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enn.com/press_releases/3489 : Wesleyan University to Host National Conference on Pricing Carbon Emissions].

===Science and mathematics===
According to [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) research and data, the University ranks first nationally among liberal arts colleges in federal funding for research in the sciences and mathematics. Wesleyan is also the number one ranked liberal arts institution in publications by science and mathematics faculty as determined by a measure of research publication rate and impact of publication that factors in both the number of research papers and the number of times those papers are cited in the literature. The University's undergraduates co-author (with Wesleyan faculty) and publish more scientific papers than do students at any other liberal arts school. Additionally, the University is the only liberal arts college in the nation to receive research funding from the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH) to support a Molecular Biophysics Predoctoral Research Training Program. Wesleyan is the sole undergraduate liberal arts college to receive this support among research universities such as Stanford, University of California at Berkeley, Johns Hopkins, Harvard University Medical School, Duke, Cornell, and the University of Pennsylvania.The University also may be the only liberal arts college to offer an undergraduate concentration in Molecular Biophysics. Medical school acceptances historically have averaged above 90% and in some years Wesleyan has recorded an acceptance rate of 100%. Many pre-med graduates are admitted to the most prestigious programs in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wesleyan Science Facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wesleyan University&quot;&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/astro/academics/undergrad.html Undergraduate Program], Astronomy Department, Wesleyan University, Research Corporation's, &quot;Academic Excellence: The Sourcebook&quot;.

==== Science in Society ====
Wesleyan's Science in Society Program (SISP) is an interdisciplinary major that encourages integrated study of the sciences and medicine as practices, institutions, and intellectual achievements, among other areas of study. The program has three components: science courses, SISP courses, and an area of concentration (which may include a major in one of the sciences). The program is well suited for students interested in a variety of professional and academic pursuits, since it encourages students to integrate technical scientific understanding with a grasp of the multiple contexts in which scientific knowledge is applied, and the issues at stake in its application.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/28/obituaries/earl-d-hanson-66-wesleyan-professor-and-science-leader.html Earl D.

The academically rigorous program provides for interdisciplinary graduate study independent of the undergraduate academic departments. This replaced the Master of Arts in Teaching program previously offered, and expanded it so that students can pursue graduate study for any purpose.

A large proportion of G.L.S.P. students are public and private school teachers from the region, and the others are in different professions, or are otherwise augmenting their graduate studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://frontrow.espn.go.com/2011/10/sidelines-chuck-pagano-stargazer/ Sidelines: Chuck Pagano, stargazer Â« ESPN Front Row].

The Graduate Liberal Studies Program offers both the Master of Arts in Liberal Studies (MALS) and the Certificate of Advanced Studies (C.A.S.). The former requires 36 credit hours of study and may culminate in a capstone project or thesis. The latter requires 30 credit hours of academic study and a thesis.

The Center is also a place for ongoing communication between the humanities and the social sciences. Its program each semester is organized around a central theme, which in turn shapes a weekly series of public lectures and smaller seminars. As a meeting place for the humanities and social sciences, for Wesleyan faculty and visiting scholars, and for faculty and students, the Center is an important site of intellectual life at the University.&lt;ref name=&quot;britannica1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wesleyan.edu/chum/ Celebrating 50 Years], Center for the Humanities, Wesleyan University.

===Student activism===
====Need-blind admissions====
Wesleyan adheres to a [[need-blind admission]] policy. Financial circumstances are not considered when deciding whether to admit, wait list, or turn down an applicant. In 1982, trustees announced that, following federal cuts to student aid, Wesleyan would begin to consider financial circumstances when admitting wait-listed students. Students protested the decision,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Protest over Aid Ends at Wesleyan&quot;, New York Times, 19 May 1982, p. B5.&lt;/ref&gt; and though trustees did not back down from their recommendations, Wesleyan raised enough money for financial aid to avoid putting the new policy into effect.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Ability to Pay Becomes Factor in Admissions&quot;, ''New York Times'', 6 May 1990, p. A51. The title refers to a change in policy at [[Smith College]], not at Wesleyan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the administration again considered a moratorium on need-blind admissions. A student group, Students for Financially Accessible Education (SFAE), organized a series of actions, including rallies, a silent vigil encircling a trustee meeting, a sit-in in an administration building, and a camp-out on its lawn. Wesleyan's need-blind admissions policy was preserved and remains today. For several years, SFAE continued to raise awareness about financial accessibility, offering interest-free loans to students with financial emergencies, and raising money for financial aid through energy conservation campaigns. The group appears to be dormant at this time.

====WESU &amp; National Public Radio====
Another controversy in the same period was the status of the campus radio station, [[WESU]], founded in 1939 as the second college radio station in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Evan Simko-Bednarski, [http://www.wesufm.org/history.html A Brief, Informal, Probably Incomplete History of WESU], WESU-FM.

Until 2004, WESU's format had been entirely free-form, with DJs and student staff having complete freedom to program what they will.
