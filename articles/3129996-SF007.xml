'''Metacafe''' is a web site that specializes in short-form video entertainment in the categories of movies, video games, sports, music and TV.

The company is headquartered in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], with offices in New York, Los Angeles, London and Tel Aviv. Metacafe is privately held and its investors include [[Accel Partners]], [[Benchmark Capital]], [[DAG Ventures]] and [[Highland Capital Partners]].

In its early years, Metacafe was similar to other video viewing websites such as [[YouTube]] or [[Dailymotion]], but has since transformed itself into a short-form video entertainment site with several differences. The site now showcases curated, exclusive and original premium entertainment-related video content.

The company's partners include marquee content providers such as major movie studios, video game publishers, broadcast and cable TV networks, music labels and sports leagues.

The site is advertising supported, working closely with brands in the entertainment, consumer electronics, telecommunications, consumer packaged goods, food &amp; beverage, and automotive sectors.

==Company statistics==
Metacafe attracts more than 13 million unique monthly U.S. viewers and streams more than 53 million videos in the U.S. each month, according to comScore Video Metrix (March 2011).   The site's global audience is more than 40 million unique monthly viewers.

As of September 2011 its [[Alexa Internet|Alexa]] global rank was 336th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Metacafe.com|url=http://www.alexa.com/siteinfo/metacafe.com|publisher=Alexa Internet|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
Metacafe Inc. was founded in July 2002 in [[Tel Aviv]] by [[Israelis|Israeli]] entrepreneurs [[Eyal Hertzog]] ([[Chief technical officer]]) and Arik Czerniak ([[CEO]]) and raised $3 million from [[Benchmark Capital]]. In June 2006, the company closed a [[venture capital|Series B financing]] round of $12 million. Investors included [[Accel Partners]] and [[Benchmark Capital]]. That September, the company moved its headquarters to [[Palo Alto]], [[California]] and in October, Metacafe was ranked the third largest video site in the world according to [[comScore]].&lt;ref name=&quot;try_harder&quot;&gt;''We Try Harder,'' article from [http://ipcommunications.tmcnet.com/news/2006/11/29/234159.htm?p=video IPcommunications.tmcnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The company is currently headquartered in San Francisco, CA.

On February 5, 2007, Erick Hachenburg, previously of [[Electronic Arts]] and [[Pogo.com|Pogo]], took over as [[CEO]] of the company. The company closed a [[venture capital|Series C financing]] round of $30 million in August, 2007 with [[Accel Partners]], [[Benchmark Capital]], [[DAG Ventures]] and [[Highland Capital Partners]].

&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Directors cut screenshot.jpg|thumb|Metacafe's Director's Cut Page|{{deletable image-caption|1=Wednesday, 26 March 2008}}]] --&gt;
In October 2006, Metacafe announced its Producer Rewards&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Metacafe.com/producer_rewards/ Metacafe - Producer Rewards&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
program in which video producers were paid for their original content.  Through this program, any video that was viewed a minimum of 20,000 times, achieved a VideoRank rating of 3.00 or higher, and did not violate any [[copyrights]] or other Metacafe community standards was awarded $5 for every 1,000 U.S. views. Pay only for U.S. views.

The program had several success stories, some of which have been featured on national TV, such as The Can Tossing Video,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacafe.com/watch/1402448/can_toss/ Metacafe.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Beer Launching Fridge]] on [[David Letterman]], and the Ron Paul Girl series&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livfilms.com/?cat=6 Livfilms.com]&lt;/ref&gt; by  Liv Films,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metacafe.com/channels/Liv+Films Liv Films' Channel]&lt;/ref&gt; that has been featured on [[Fox News]] and [[CNN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livfilms.com Livfilms.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Metacafe has also teamed up with notable TV producers like [[Steven Bochco]] ([[Hill Street Blues]], [[L.A. Law]]) with a series called Cafe Confidential, a 44 [[webisode]] series consisting of teens and twenty-somethings sharing semi-autobiographical stories. The short-form videos, shot close-up, were taken from interviews of more than 100 people talking about memorable moments.

By the end of 2008, Producer Rewards was considerably curtailed before being shut down completely due to a lack of demonstrable profitability. Once the Producer Rewards program closed, users like Kipkay switched their focus to [[YouTube]].

==Content accessibility==
Numerous third-party web sites, applications and browser plug-ins allow users to download Metacafe videos.
