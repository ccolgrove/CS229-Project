==Unpopular designs==
[[British Airways]] introduced varied and unusual tailfin designs in 1997.  These &quot;airline liveries and logos&quot; were intended to make the airline's branding more cosmopolitan and were described as &quot;arty&quot; and &quot;ethnic&quot;.  They were unpopular with many customers and also caused confusion for ground controllers who had more difficulty recognising the [[British Airways ethnic liveries]] aircraft to give clear taxiing instructions.  Despite the Â£60M expense of this livery, it was replaced completely in 2001 and the airline has now returned to a more traditional design based upon the [[Union flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/low/uk/1325127.stm|title=R.I.P. British Airways' funky tailfins|publisher=BBC|date=Friday, 11 May, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;   
[[Brussels Airlines]] first logo was a stylised letter [[B]] composed of 13 dots resembling a [[runway]].  This was thought to be unlucky and protests by [[superstition|superstitious]] passengers caused the airline to add another dot.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/6383171.stm|title='Unlucky' airline logo grounded|publisher=BBC|date=21 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
