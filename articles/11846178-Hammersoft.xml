[[File:terminator1001.jpg|thumb|250px|A Series 800 terminator, a robot-only version of the [[cyborg]] played by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]].]]

In the [[Terminator (franchise)|''Terminator'' film series]], a '''terminator''' is an [[autonomous robot]], typically [[humanoid robot|humanoid]], originally conceived as a virtually indestructible [[soldier]] and [[Assassination|assassin]], as well as an [[Infiltration tactics|infiltrator]].

[[James Cameron]] introduced the first terminator character in the 1984 movie ''[[The Terminator]]'', featuring a single [[cyborg]] simply called &quot;The Terminator&quot;, portrayed by [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. When later ''Terminator'' movies introduced additional models, some sources retroactively gave Schwarzenegger's character a model number, leading to [[Terminator (character)#Character nomenclature|multiple conflicting names]].

==Physical characteristics==


In the ''Terminator'' universe, the Terminator is a formidable &quot;cybernetic organism&quot;, robotic assassin and soldier, designed by the military supercomputer [[Skynet (fictional)|Skynet]] for infiltration and combat duty, towards the ultimate goal of exterminating the [[Tech-Com|human resistance]]. It can [[natural language processing|speak naturally]], [[sound alike|copy the voices of others]], [[optical character recognition|read human handwriting]], and even genuinely [[sweating|sweat]], [[odor|smell]], and [[blood|bleed]]. To detect the Terminators, who are otherwise indistinguishable from humans, the human resistance uses [[dog]]s to alert humans to their presence.

A trait persistent throughout the series is the faint red glow of the &quot;[[robotic eye|eye]]s&quot; when online, which dim to nothing when a Terminator shuts down. In all four movies, the lack of the glow has been used to show when one is out of action. The trait is so characteristic that light-up eyes are often found on Terminator merchandise,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hottoys.com.hk/product.php?cat=22&amp;pid=259 Example product with simple light-up feature]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with some even replicating the dimming/reillumination effect that occurs during shut down or start up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sideshowtoy.com/cgi-bin/category.cgi?item=8333 |title=T-800 Endoskeleton |publisher=Sideshowtoy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Guardian Terminator [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron]] states to [[John Connor]] in ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'' episode &quot;The Mousetrap&quot;, that Terminators' densities deny them the ability to swim.  T-888 [[Cromartie (Terminator)|Cromartie]] demonstrated in the same episode, however, that they can survive submerged and walk along the bed to the shore. The prototype Terminator Marcus Wright in ''Terminator Salvation'' did demonstrate the ability to swim, though he is the only one of his type.

===Construction===
As seen in the movies, a Terminator can withstand standard 20th century [[firearm]]s, crash through walls intact, and survive [[explosion]]s to some degree. Repeated shotgun blasts have enough force to knock it down and temporarily disable it, while heavy amounts of automatic fire are able to compromise the organic disguise layer. In the second film, the Terminator says he can run for 120 years on his existing power cells. In the finale to ''Terminator 2'', his power source is damaged, and he is able to find an alternate source, described on the DVD commentary as [[heat sink]]s, harnessing the thermal energy from the hot surroundings. In the third film, the T-850 series Terminator operates on two hydrogen cells and discards one of them early due to damage. It explodes shortly thereafter with enough force to produce a small [[mushroom cloud]]; the fact that many of them are powered by nuclear fuel cells is confirmed by the fourth film.

The [[endoskeleton]] is actuated by a powerful network of [[electric]] [[servomechanism]]s, making Terminators [[superhuman strength|superhumanly strong]]. For instance, in the third movie, Schwarzenegger's character was able to break through a cement wall, while being able to handle firing a [[machine gun]] from the hip with one hand, while holding a coffin containing John Connor and a heavy cache of weapons, showing no signs of the extra weight being any real concern; in the second film, Schwarzenegger's character was able to resist the recoil of firing a [[minigun]] without any noticeable difficulty.  Late in the first film, the Terminator is stripped of its organic elements by fire. What remains is the machine itself, in James Cameron's own words &quot;a chrome skeleton&quot;, &quot;like [[Death (personification)|Death]] rendered in steel.&quot; In the later ''Terminator'' films, armies of endoskeleton-only Terminators are seen. They are visually identical to the one in the first film, and feature prominently in the &quot;future war&quot; sequences of those films.

Despite what Kyle Reese claimed in the first film of &quot;cyborgs do not feel pain,&quot; in the second film it was revealed that they are capable of sensing injuries and &quot;the data could be called pain&quot;, according to the Series 800 Model 101.  In an episode of ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles,'' &quot;Mr. Ferguson Is Ill Today,&quot; another cyborg, Cameron, revealed to have an intolerance to some degrees of temperature in its surrounding, as humans do.  Unlike humans, however, being machines, they are capable of resisting or shutting off this sense of discomfort. In the following episode, &quot;Complications&quot;, Cameron elaborates that Terminators can appreciate physical sensations such as the wind blowing through its hair and toes, and process them in a psychological manner.

===CPU===

The Terminator [[Central processing unit|CPU]] is a [[room-temperature superconductor|room-temperature superconducting]] [[artificial neural network]] with [[artificial intelligence|the ability to learn]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Tarisa:''' &quot;It's a neural-net processor. It thinks and learns like we do. It's superconducting at room temperature.&quot; ''[http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Terminator-2-Judgement-Day.html (Terminator 2: Judgment Day Script)]''&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Terminator 2'', The Terminator states that &quot;the more contact [it] has with humans, the more [it] learns.&quot; In the Special Edition, he says that Skynet &quot;presets the switch to '[[read-only memory|read-only]]' when [Terminators] are sent out alone&quot;, to prevent them from &quot;thinking too much&quot;. Sarah and John activate his learning ability, after which it becomes more curious and begins trying to understand and imitate human behavior. This leads to his use of the [[catch phrase]] &quot;Hasta la vista, baby.&quot; A line spoken by the Terminator at the end of the film: &quot;I know now why you cry, but it is something that I can never do.&quot; Sarah muses in the closing narration that the Terminator had &quot;learn[ed] the value of human life&quot;.

Terminators, being machines, do not value life, and pragmatically kill in keeping with its programming, i.e. to fulfill its mission.  When discussing a variation on the ''[[Blade Runner]]'' '[[Voight-Kampff machine|tortoise test]]' in ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode, &quot;Complications&quot;, Cameron states that a [[tortoise]] did not pose a threat and &quot;We are not programmed to be cruel,&quot; implying that Terminators would right an overturned tortoise.  Terminators had to be trained to torture - by humans, such as engineer/criminal [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#F|Charles Fischer]] - as shown in &quot;Complications&quot;.

Terminators appear incapable of [[suicide|&quot;self termination&quot;]], in ''Terminator 2'' the badly damaged Terminator states this to Sarah before asking her to lower it into molten steel (so that his chip cannot be used to help create Skynet). The Cameron Terminator is however able to place a destructive charge next to its chip, and entrusts John with the button that would immediately destroy the processor if pressed. To prevent the possible reprogramming of defeated Terminators, as the television series ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode &quot;The Tower Is Tall But The Fall Is Short&quot; reveals, Skynet coats later chips with a phosphorus compound which cause them to self-destruct when they contact oxygen.

===Organic covering===

The flesh-covering that is used on the majority of Terminator models has similar qualities to real human [[muscle fibre]] and [[dermis]], including soft tissue and skin, as well as the ability to sweat, simulate breathing and produce realistic body odor.&lt;ref&gt;As mentioned by Kyle Reese in ''[[The Terminator (film)|The Terminator]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Terminator flesh does contain blood, it only displays very minimal bleeding when damaged and has never been shown to experience any kind of profuse bleeding even from massive lacerations and dozens of gunshot wounds. It is unknown what manner of circulatory system, if any, is employed, nor what biological processes take place to sustain the flesh covering.  James Cameron's 1982 Treatment reveals, &quot;it has to eat and breathe to keep the skin alive, though a lot less than us... and there's a little tiny heart and internal organs about the size of a chicken's in a recessed compartment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/Terminator_Treatment.txt |title=Terminator Treatment |publisher=SciFiScripts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At least some Terminator models can consume [[Food|sustenance]].  Cameron eats a corn chip in the [[Pilot (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|''Sarah Connor Chronicles'' pilot]], and later a piece of a pancake.  The liquid metal [[T-1001]] is also shown to have this capability.  The T-888s presumably consume food, given Vick Chamberlain's ability to maintain a human cover for years while married to a human woman.

Under 2007-era analysis Terminator blood is shown to be similar to human blood, using a [[Blood substitutes|synthetic oxygen carrier]] rather than human [[red blood cell]]s, as Terminator endoskeletons contain no [[bone marrow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|Episode 3: &quot;The Turk&quot;, ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']]&lt;/ref&gt; Terminator flesh heals by itself,&lt;ref&gt;According to the Terminator, when asked by Sarah Connor in ''[[Terminator 2: Judgment Day]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and at a much faster rate than normal human tissue&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[[Heavy Metal (Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles)|Episode 4: &quot;Heavy Metal&quot;, ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']]&lt;/ref&gt; and has never been shown to bruise or discolor from trauma, even after several days. However, a Terminator's flesh covering can die if it sustains adequately massive damage, at which point it takes on a waxy, [[corpse]]-like pallor and begins to decompose.This process is seen in the later scenes of the original film where The Terminator, holed up in his [[hotel]] room, is attracting flies and draws an inquiry from the [[janitor]] as to whether the smell is coming from a dead animal. More advanced flesh use on T-888s appears to not suffer the effects of age or deprivation,  as shown in the ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode, &quot;Self Made Man,&quot; where a T-888 known as [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Myron Stark|Myron Stark]] is able to maintain his organic covering while sealed within a wall for eighty years; no explanation for this ability was provided.  Terminator flesh lacerations can be repaired; the T-800 and Sarah Connor closed each other's wounds with sutures in ''Terminator 2: Judgment Day'', and Cameron sealed her wounds with heavy duty staples in ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' episode &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;.

Although clearly not the normal procedure, a bare [[Cromartie (Terminator)|T-888]] endoskeleton was able to grow itself a new flesh covering using 2007 technology (with the assistance of a geneticist and its own knowledge of future formula) by submerging itself in a blood-like [[bathing|bath]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt; This improvised process resulted in a deformed covering that had the appearance of a burn victim and lacked its own biological [[human eye|eye]]s, requiring it to steal those of the [[geneticist]] and subsequently undergo [[cosmetic surgery]] to produce a more normal appearance.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt; The theft of the scientist's eyes suggests that Terminator flesh is capable of accepting some degree of [[organ transplants|organ grafts]] from ordinary humans, that it can circumvent [[transplant rejection]], and is capable of sustaining the life of the grafted tissue via its own unknown biological process. 

It has been shown that Terminators' flesh coverings are somehow grown identically, producing many multiple copies of exactly the same physical appearance, indicating the use of specific physical templates for different variations of a model or series. The most well known is that worn by multiple Model 101/T-800/850 units portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger, as well as a T-888 model known as &quot;Vick Chamberlain&quot; having a memory of facing a room (presumably in the factory where it was created) of several dozen units sharing an identical template to itself, [[nudity|naked]] and moving in unison.&lt;ref&gt;''[[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|Episode 8, &quot;Vick's Chip&quot;, ''Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles'']].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some terminators' outer coverings are custom-designed to copy the appearances of humans whom they are intended to kill and replace.  Three such examples in ''The Sarah Connor Chronicles'' include [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Carl Greenway|Carl Greenway]] in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|&quot;Automatic for the People&quot;]], [[James Ellison (Terminator)|James Ellison]] in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|&quot;Brothers of Nablus&quot;]] and Cameron's pattern, [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles minor characters#Allison Young|Allison Young]], in [[List of Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles episodes|&quot;Allison from Palmdale&quot;]].

===Liquid metal===

The [[T-1000]], [[T-1001]], [[T-X]], and [[T-1000000]] machines employ a &quot;liquid metal&quot; mimetic poly-alloy that allows them to quickly shapeshift to achieve near-perfect [[mimicry]] and also rapidly recover from damage.

The T-1000 and T-1001 models, which are composed entirely of the substance, can quickly [[liquify]] and assume forms in innovative and surprising ways, including fitting through narrow openings, morphing their arms into solid metal shapes or [[bladed weapons]], walking through prison bars, and flattening themselves on the ground to hide or [[ambush]] targets.&lt;ref name=&quot;scifiscripts.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifiscripts.com/scripts/t2.txt |title=Terminator2: Judgement Day |publisher=Scifiscripts.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also extrude small, simple items from itself (such as a pair of sunglasses). It can change its color and texture to simulate flesh, clothing, and other nonmetallic materials.  They are effectively impervious to mechanical damage, such as being dismembered, shot with bullets, or attacked with explosive devices.  Wounds close almost immediately, and any detached parts simply flow back into the Terminator's body. Low temperatures can cause the liquid metal to freeze, which inhibits its ability to move or shapeshift.

Freezing also appears to have a lasting negative effect on its ability to shapeshift. In ''Terminator 2 - The Extended Special Edition'', there are additional scenes that shows the T-1000 partially losing control of its morphing ability after is has recovered from being frozen by liquid nitrogen. One of its hands stick to a railing and while walking its feet attaches to, and morphs into the floor. &lt;br /&gt;
High temperatures degrade its ability to maintain a disguise. Only extremely high temperatures, such as molten steel are capable of disassociating its molecular structure and permanently destroying it.

The T-X model is covered by the mimetic poly-alloy, providing it the ability to mimic humanoid forms while enforcing the endoskeleton beneath.

===Other Skynet battle units===

As seen in the &quot;future war&quot; scenes from various ''Terminator'' media, Skynet employs robots not designed to appear as humans even while having access to those who are. This page primarily discusses the Infiltrator subfamily of Humanoid Hunter-Killer branch. Simple Humanoid Hunter-Killers (HKs) share the endoskeletons and combat characteristics with Infiltrators, but not the living tissue sheath. Instead, they serve as general infantry.

Non-Humanoid Hunter-Killers are robotic versions of various vehicles, built with roughly the same technologies as the contemporary Terminators. The original film introduced a [[VTOL]] gunship (HK-Aerial) and an HK-Tank. ''[[Terminator: Salvation]]'' also adds an armed motorcycle, a much larger transport aircraft, the massive Harvester walker and a small recon drone; other media introduce a plethora of other designs.

==Development of the Terminators==
According to the films, the terminators were created by an artificially intelligent computer, [[Skynet (fictional)|Skynet]], to wipe out the remains of humanity. Some models are designed to look exactly like humans in order to infiltrate their bases, progressing from fake rubber skin, to artificially grown human flesh over their electronics, to mimetic polyalloy able to mimic any person or object.

According to the first two films, terminators were [[Cyberdyne Systems]] models created after the war between man and machines started. In the altered timeline of ''T3'' created by the destruction of Cyberdyne in ''T2'', terminators were created by the [[Cyber Research Systems]] division of the [[U.S. Air Force]] to replace soldiers on the battlefield prior to Judgment Day, starting with the [[T-1 (Terminator character)|T-1]].

In the television series ''[[Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles]]'', [[Cameron (Terminator)|Cameron Phillips]] establishes that modern terminators are made of [[coltan]] for heat resistance, while previous models were made of [[titanium]].

==Models==
The first terminator model shown, simply called &quot;The Terminator&quot;, was introduced in the first film, with a new model terminator added for each subsequent film. In addition to those models shown on screen, other spin off sources have introduced more, including T-800s with different appearances from Schwarzenegger, the T-70 from ''[[T2 3-D: Battle Across Time]]'' and the female I-950 from ''[[T2: Infiltrator]]''.
