===Facilities===
'''Nelson Field House''', located on Bloomsburg Universityâs upper campus, serves as home for the universityâs indoor athletic events.  The facility, constructed in 1971, is currently undergoing a $13.4 million dollar facelift. Among the renovations to the field house will be a new bleacher system for the main gym area, a new scoreboard, a new wrestling room on the lower level of the facility, a new and expanded press box, dedicated locker rooms for each sport, including an expanded football locker room, improved office space and additional storage space. In addition the '''Nelson Field House Pool''' features six competition-length lanes, automatic Colorado Timing System, and bleacher seating for nearly 800 spectators in the gallery. The pool serves as the site of Bloomsburg varsity swimming and club [[water polo]] contests as well as [[PIAA]] District IV championship meets.The project also provides for enhancements to both the upper and lower entrances that will showcase the awards the teams have won over the last three decades. 

'''Robert B. Redman Stadium''' is situated on the upper campus of Bloomsburg University as part of the university's 103-acre athletic complex and is home to the football and track &amp; field programs. Originally built in February 1974, the new facility took the place of Athletic Park in downtown Bloomsburg as Home of the Huskies. 
 
In the spring of 2008 the facility was completely renovated as a part of a $3.45 million dollar project which included a press box with elevator, new rest rooms, artificial turf field, track and field facilities, new railings and ADA compliance, new parking lot, new visitor bleachers and lights. 
 
The stadium, which overlooks the scenic Susquehanna Valley, has seating for 5,000 spectators, although attendance at several events has exceeded that total. The largest crowd to see a football game in the facility totalled 7,483 at the 1985 Homecoming contest against [[Millersville University of Pennsylvania|Millersville]].
 
Originally, when planning began for the new stadium in 1963, the proposed site was on the lower campus across from where the Rec Center is now; however, a consultant's report recommended the upper campus development. The project finally got underway in 1972 at a total cost of $725,000.

'''Sports Stadium''', a new multi-purpose, lighted field, was opened in 2006. The $1.5 million dollar facility features a state-of-the-art, Fieldturf monofilament, artificial surface used by the field hockey, menâs and womenâs soccer and womenâs lacrosse teams. The facility also features a brand-new press box, sound system and seating for over 700 fans. 

'''Jan M. Hutchinson Field''' is home to Bloomsburg softball.  The stadium features large block dugouts, stadium style steating behind home plate and a scoreboard.

'''Danny Litwhiler Field''' is home to Bloomsburg's baseball program and features a large mesh screen and seating behind homeplate making it a fan friendly venue to watch college baseball.
