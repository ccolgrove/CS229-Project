'''PRIME7''' is an Australian [[Television broadcasting in Australia|television network]] owned by [[Prime Media Group Limited]]. Prime Television launched on 17 March 1962 as ''[[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN/CWN]]'' in [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] and [[Dubbo]], [[New South Wales]], and has since expanded to cover regional [[New South Wales]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]] as a [[Seven Network]] affiliate.

PRIME's administration and broadcast facilities are based in [[Canberra]], alongside the network's parent company Prime Media Group Limited and the playout facilities for the [[Golden West Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;report05&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==History==
===Origins===
Prime Television originally began as a group of separate stations and networks - ''Midstate Television'' in [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Dubbo]] and [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]], ''[[AMV (TV station)|RVN/AMV]]'' in [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]] and [[Wagga Wagga]], and ''NEN/ECN'' in [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] and [[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|publisher= AusTVHistory
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[CBN (Australian TV station)|CBN-8]] [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]] began on 17 March 1962, followed by [[CBN (Australian TV station)|CWN-6]] Dubbo on 1 December 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; The two stations were both licensed to ''Country Broadcasting Services'' (also the owner of radio station [[2GZ]] in Orange). CWN-6 was a direct relay of CBN-8 - this meant that the two stations formed the country's first regional network, CBN/CWN.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

At the same time, [[AMV (TV station)|RVN-2]] [[Wagga Wagga, New South Wales|Wagga Wagga]] began on 19 June 1964, and [[MTN (TV station)|MTN-9]] [[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] began on 15 December 1965. The two stations merged in 1971 as the ''Riverina and North East Victoria Television Service Pty Ltd'', ''RVN/AMV'' on air.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

In northern New South Wales, NEN-9 [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] began transmission on 27 September 1965, with a relay in [[Armidale, New South Wales|Armidale]] (NEN-1, later NEN-10) on 15 July 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; ECN-8 [[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]] started on 27 May 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; At one stage, ECN-8 was tied NRN-11 [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]] (now owned by [[Southern Cross Broadcasting]] as [[Southern Cross Ten]]), however the two stations split. NEN later merged with ECN as ''NEN-9/ECN-8''.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

===Television 6-8-9===
As a result of the financial difficulties that many independent stations faced, MTN-9 joined CWN-6 and CBN-8 to form ''Television 6, 8, 9'' in 1973 (later known as ''Midstate Television'').&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; Relays were launched in [[Portland, New South Wales|Portland]], [[Lithgow, New South Wales|Lithgow]], [[Mudgee]], [[Cobar, New South Wales|Cobar]], [[Kandos, New South Wales|Kandos]] and [[Rylstone, New South Wales|Rylstone]] and [[Bathurst, New South Wales|Bathurst]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

[[Colour television]] was introduced at the same time as the rest of the country, on 1 March 1975 - one of the single most expensive processes undertaken by CBN to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; The station was a prominent broadcaster of local sporting events including [[Tennis]] and [[Rugby football|Rugby]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; In 1979 a documentary titled ''Goin' Down The Road'', about the 1978 National Rodeo Titles won the network a [[Logie award]] for an 'Outstanding Contribution by a Regional Station'.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

Midstate produced a number of local programs, including the ''Weekend Report'', ''Early Shift'', ''Rural Roundup'' and ''Around the Schools''.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; Since 1968 CBN was able to access the [[Postmaster-General's Department|Postmaster General]]'s microwave link for national news and other major events.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

===Aggregation===
[[Image:Prime, 2WG and Star FM broadcasting studios.jpg|thumb|Former RVN now (CBN-2) the Prime Television studios in Wagga Wagga]]
Midstate Television was bought out by media magnate Paul Ramsay's Ramcorp Ltd. in October 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; It was soon merged with Ramcorp's other stations, ''RVN/AMV'' and ''NEN/ECN''. The name ''The Prime Network'' had been in use since 1986. By 1988 the network began to show increased [[Seven Network]] programming in readiness for [[Regional television in Australia#Aggregation|aggregation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

When aggregation took place, Prime began broadcasting to both southern [[New South Wales]] and northern [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. Transmission problems meant that aggregation in southern [[New South Wales]] took place in two stages - first the [[Australian Capital Territory]] and [[South Coast (New South Wales)|NSW south coast]] on 31 March 1989, followed by [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Dubbo]], and [[Wagga Wagga]] on 31 December 1989. These changes led to the de-merger of RVN-AMV, with RVN becoming CBN-2.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt;

[[Griffith, New South Wales|Griffith]] remained a one-station market, however instead of taking programming from Prime in line with the network's other stations, [[MTN (TV station)|MTN-9]] relayed programming mainly from [[WIN Television]] in southern New South Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; A supplementary license, AMN-31, was successfully bid for by MTN in 1996, providing a relay of Prime Television.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-90s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the station was purchased by [[WIN Television]], which undertook a number of minor changes - mainly changing the news service to [[WIN News]], and using entirely WIN branding. AMN-31 remains a relay of Prime. Similarly, the [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] license area remained separate from the remainder of Victoria, albeit with a single station, STV-8, later bought out by [[WIN Television]] in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; PTV-31 began broadcasting the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-90s&quot; /&gt;

Although advertising revenue increased post-aggregation, local programming declined as a result of the costs incurred by the network's expansion - an estimated $45 million had been spent by Ramcorp during and in the lead-up to aggregation.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-90s&quot; /&gt; After losses of $50 million, it was not until 1993 that the renamed [[Prime Television Limited]] posted a profit.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-90s&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;afr93&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Prime Returns from the Brink |url=http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/health/ramsay_early.html |work=[[Australian Financial Review]] |publisher= |date=25 August 1993 |accessdate=15 September 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070910103323/http://www.uow.edu.au/arts/sts/bmartin/dissent/documents/health/ramsay_early.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 10 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1996, PRIME's parent company, [[Prime Television Limited]], purchased the [[Golden West Network]], a merged group of four stations; BTW-3 [[Bunbury, Western Australia|Bunbury]], VEW-8 [[Kalgoorlie, Western Australia|Kalgoorlie]], GTW-11 [[Geraldton, Western Australia|Geraldton]] and GSW-9 [[Albany, Western Australia|Albany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The network began to expand into New Zealand in 1997, when a number of licenses were purchased from [[United Christian Broadcasters]] for an estimated $3.6 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;thepress&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The network's relationship with Seven was further developed throughout the early 2000s, leading to the unsuccessful introduction of ''7onPrime'' branding for [[Seven Network]]-produced programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-00s&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Local news bulletins for [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Canberra]], and [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] were axed in 2001 due to falling ratings and the anticipated costs of the switch to [[digital television]].&lt;ref name=&quot;newsaxings-tele&quot;&gt;

Prime formed a partnership with the [[Nine Network]] (affiliated in Australia to competitor [[WIN Television]]), giving its owner, [[PBL Media]] the option to purchase a 50% share of [[Prime Television New Zealand]] in return for access to original programming, and cross-promotion in PBL's New Zealand magazine titles.&lt;ref name=&quot;primenz-pbl&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Nine Network Australia Formally Commences New Zealand Partnership with Prime Television Australia |publisher=[[PBL Media]] |date=  18 February 2002 |url=http://www.pbl.com.au/nine_network_australia_formally_commences_new_zealand_partnership_with_prime_television_australia.htm |accessdate=2 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, Prime Television New Zealand began to take on branding and programming similar to that of the [[Nine Network]]. In November 2005, [[Prime Television New Zealand]] was purchased by [[subscription television]] provider [[SKY Network Television]] for $[[New Zealand dollar|NZ]]30 million, completed after approval by New Zealand's [[Commerce Commission]] in February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.primetv.co.nz/default.asp?t=4 |title= Corporate - About Us |accessdate=1 September 2007 |year=2006 |work=[[Prime Television New Zealand]] |publisher=[http://www.primetv.co.nz/ primetv.co.nz] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mildura Digital Television]], a digital-only station in [[Mildura, Victoria|Mildura]] began transmissions in 2006 as a joint venture between [[Prime Television Limited]] and [[WIN Corporation]]. [[Section 38A|Section 38B]] of the ''Broadcasting Services Act'' allowed for the provision of a third station owned by either one or both existing networks. MDT is a direct relay of [[ATV-10|Ten Melbourne]], albeit with local advertising.

Prime Television announced on 21 December 2009 that it would start broadcasting [[7TWO]] on 23 December 2009.

===2010s===
On 25 September 2010, Prime began transmission of the new HD digital channel [[7mate]] aimed at men 16-49. The first program to be broadcast was the drawn [[2010 AFL Grand Final]]. On 15 January 2011, Prime Media Group reported that Prime and [[Golden West Network|GWN]] were to rebrand as Prime7 and GWN7 respectively. The news bulletins has changed to Prime7 News and GWN7 News, during that, 7TWO and 7MATE dropped the &quot;Prime&quot; logo on the multichannels. Prime and GWN relaunched on 16 January 2011 at 6:00pm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prime7.com.au&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==
Prime's programming schedule is almost identical to that of its metropolitan affiliate, the [[Seven Network]], with some differences. Since the network's inception it has featured a broad range of original local programming, currently including children's program ''The Saturday Club'', music show ''X:Press'' as well as community service segment ''Prime InfoNet'', a series of short updates listing local community events.

Prime's overnight schedule also differs from the Seven Network feed, containing infomercials from Danoz Direct, Home Shopping, and a feed from pay television channel [[Expo Channel|Expo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

''Prime7 News'' is the network's local news service. Full bulletins are produced for the towns and surrounding regions originally covered by the stations &quot;Midstate 6,8,9 Television&quot;, [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]]/[[Dubbo]],  &quot;RVN-2/AMV-4&quot;, [[Albury, New South Wales|Albury]]/[[Wodonga, Victoria|Wodonga]] and &quot;9/8 Television&quot; (NEN-9/ECN-8) [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]]/[[Taree, New South Wales|Taree]], prior to the [[Regional television in Australia#Aggregation|aggregation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; of regional television services in New South Wales that occurred in the early 1990s. In other areas two-minute news updates are shown at various times of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-00s&quot; /&gt;

''Prime7 News'' is presented live, from local studios weeknightly at 6pm in most areas, with the exception of Orange and Wagga Wagga where both bulletins presented from Canberra,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TV news decision ends an era|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/08/06/2975258.htm|accessdate=17 August 2010|newspaper=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;prime&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Prime airs its first Canberra bulletin|accessdate=17 August 2010|newspaper=The Daily Advertiser|date=17 August 2010|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by a delayed bulletin of ''[[Seven News]]''. The Albury and Orange ''Prime7 News'' bulletins are presented by [[Daniel Gibson (presenter)|Daniel Gibson]] with Madelaine Collignon presenting the weather. Elspeth Taylor and sport presenter Bill North present the Tamworth and North Coast bulletins, while in Wagga Wagga the news presenter is presented by Doug Hogan.

News bulletins for the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]], [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[Canberra]], and [[Wollongong, New South Wales|Wollongong]] were axed in 2001 (in the Gold Coast's case, 2000). At the same time, the network's [[Moree]] news bureau, which provided stories for the [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] bulletin, was closed.&lt;ref name=&quot;newsaxings-tele&quot; /&gt; This, as well as the closure of bulletin by [[Southern Cross Ten]] in parts of [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]], prompted an investigation by the [[Australian Broadcasting Authority]]. New rules were later set out requiring regional stations to offer minimum levels of local content, over a six-week period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Logos==
Prime Television became a network in November 1988, witha shared logo produced and used across the regional stations, featuring the word ''Prime Television'' above an outlined rectangle.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; Aggregation occurred across the network on 31 December 1989, along with the introduction of a green logo featuring the word ''Prime'' with the letter ''i'' dotted with a globe.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-60s&quot; /&gt; This logo was used across the network until 1991, when a new gold logo was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-90s&quot; /&gt; Following a decade in use, 2001 saw the launch of a new simplified yellow logo, with the removal of the circle. This logo has been used since, and was launched concurrently with a similarly design logo on the [[Golden West Network]].&lt;ref name=&quot;atvh-00s&quot; /&gt; Following the 2011 relaunch, a new logo was introduced which features the [[Seven Network]] logo.
