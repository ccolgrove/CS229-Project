'''GRML''' &amp;ndash; an [[acronym]] for '''General Reuse Markup Language''' &amp;ndash; is a [[markup language]] similar to [[HTML]] and [[XML]], using tags to organize data in files and web pages. Data is organized in columns and rows. Tags are used to define forms, images, and hyper-linking. Its syntax, like HTML, is based on a simplified subset of [[SGML]]. GRML is not in very wide use as of May 2005. 

GRML is a data-oriented format which defines data content rather than data presentation; the file or web browser determines how data is displayed. This is the same goal as HTML's separating CSS from HTML, moving away from &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;font&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags, but GRML takes it even further. One of the key aims in creating the format was to separate &quot;views&quot; of the data from &quot;forms&quot; used to manipulate it.

It is also a common result of a typographical error when attempting to type [[HTML]], because HT and GR are adjacent on a [[Qwerty]] keyboard.
