'''Jetix''' was a children's television programming brand owned by [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] and [[The Walt Disney Company]] broadcast in [[France]]. It was previously known as [[Fox Kids]].

The channel was available in [[France]], [[Monaco]], [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Switzerland]], [[Madagascar]], [[RÃ©union]], [[Mauritius]] and [[Caribbean Sea]] ([[Antilles]], [[Guyane]], [[Guadaloupe]], [[Martinique]]). There were two Jetix websites in France, one for Jetix and one carrying their former title, [[Fox Kids]]. www.FoxKids.Fr was mainly a Jetix Website with the Fox Kids logo slapped on it, then relabeled with [[The Walt Disney Company]] ownership.
