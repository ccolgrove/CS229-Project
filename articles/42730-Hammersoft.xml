==History==
'''{{Main|History of Emory University}}'''
[[Image:Emory Glenn Chapel.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church near the main entrance of Emory University]]

In 1836, a small group of Methodists from [[Newton County, Georgia|Newton County]] contemplated the establishment of a new town and college. The town was named [[Oxford, Georgia|Oxford]] after the school's prestigious [[University of Oxford|British namesake]],&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/history/index.html |title=History &amp; Traditions Overview|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which graduated the two founders of Methodism, [[John Wesley|John]] and [[Charles Wesley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/history/index.html|title=A Brief History|last=Hauk|first=Gary S|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The college was named after [[John Emory]], an American Methodist bishop who inspired them.&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;/&gt;

Events preceding the chartering of Emory College began in 1783, when the Georgia State legislature provided for the founding of &quot;a college or seminary of learning.&quot; However, general support of education in Georgia was meager until the 1830s, when an educational fad in Germany inspired Georgia Methodists to create a school for manual labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; At the Georgia Methodist Conference in 1834, a preacher known as &quot;Uncle Allen&quot; Turner suggested that Georgia Methodists should develop their own school rather than support [[Randolph-Macon College|Randolph-Macon]] in [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;english&quot;&gt;English, Thomas H. ''Emory University 1915â1965: A Semicentennial History'' (Atlanta: Emory University, 1966).&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the Manual Labor School was created in Covington, Georgia in 1835.

On December 10, 1836, the [[Georgia General Assembly]] granted the Georgia Methodist Conference a charter to Emory College, named for [[John Emory]], a popular bishop who had presided at the 1834 conference but had died in a carriage accident in 1835.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Two years after the chartering, the college opened its doors, and on September 17, 1838, the college's first president, [[Ignatius Alphonso Few]], and three faculty members welcomed fifteen freshmen and sophomores.&lt;ref name=&quot;english&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:class of 1845.jpg|250px|right|thumb|Class of 1908]]

Emory College imposed a strict environment during most of the nineteenth century. By signing their names into the ''Matriculation Book'', students were bound to obey the &quot;Laws and Statutes of the College,&quot; which bound students to their rooms during study hours, and forbade them from leaving the town limits without the president's consent and engaging in immoral activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Until the presidency of [[Warren Candler]] in the 1890s, Emory prohibited intercollegiate sports. He thought the practice &quot;evil, only evil, and that continually,&quot; his principal objection being the cost of intercollegiate athletic programs, the temptation of gambling, and the distraction from academics.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; However, he was not unalterably opposed to athletics, and during his presidency he raised funds for the first gymnasium at Emory and oversaw the creation of the nation's first model [[intramural sports|intramural program]].

Emory College was closed briefly during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. In the autumn of 1861, every student left to fight, and the college's trustees closed for the duration. During the war, the college's buildings saw duty both as a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] hospital and [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] headquarters.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; When Emory reopened in January 1866, the school's library was destroyed and its small endowment was depleted.&lt;ref name=&quot;english&quot;/&gt; Only with the aid of a state grant could students afford to resume their education.

In the years following the Civil War, Emory, along with the rest of the South, struggled to overcome financial devastation.&lt;ref name=&quot;overview&quot;/&gt;
The first step toward financial stability came in 1880, when Emory President [[Atticus Haygood|Atticus G. Haygood]] preached a [[Thanksgiving Day]] sermon expressing gratitude for the end of slavery, which captured the attention of George I. Seney, a Brooklyn banker and Methodist. Seney gave Emory College $5,000 to repay its debts, $50,000 for construction, and $75,000 to establish a new endowment.&lt;ref name=&quot;english&quot;/&gt; Over the years, Seney invested more than a quarter-million dollars into Emory College, helping to erect the administration building in Oxford that bears his name.

Under President [[Atticus Haygood|Haygood]]'s direction, Emory College began to offer many technical and professional subjects in addition to courses required for degrees.&lt;ref name=&quot;timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/timeline/index.html|title=A Sesquicentennial Timeline: 1833-1987|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=2009-05-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, Emory had evolved its traditional liberal arts program into a broad curriculum encouraging students to pursue degrees in science, study in theology and law, and even learning and expertise in technology and tool craft. The technology department was launched by President [[Isaac Stiles Hopkins]], a polymath professor at Emory College, who was later convinced by state legislators to become the first president of what is now the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The course of Emory's history changed dramatically when, in November 1979, Robert and George Woodruff presented the institution with a gift of $105 million in [[Coca-Cola]] stock. At the time this was the largest single gift to any institution of higher education in American history, and it made a profound impact on Emory's direction in the next two decades, boosting the university to the top ranks of American research universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

Emory is celebrating its 175th anniversary in 2011. A university committee identified a list of 175 [http://www.emory.edu/home/about/anniversary/175-of-everything/history-makers.html history makers] for the occasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emory History Makers|url=http://www.emory.edu/home/about/anniversary/175-of-everything/history-makers.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [http://www.emory.edu/home/about/anniversary/almanac/index.html daily almanac] features highlights from Emory's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=175th Anniversary: Daily Almanac|url=http://www.emory.edu/home/about/anniversary/almanac/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community Education===
[[Emory Continuing Education]] offers certificate programs, computer training, professional development, personal enrichment, and corporate and senior education opportunities for those in the pursuit of lifelong learning, including certification programs, computer training and professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Emory Continuing Education website |url=http://www.ece.emory.edu/ |accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Emory Pre-College Program]] offers summer programs for rising high school juniors and seniors.

==Student life==
===Residential life===
Emory requires its students to live on campus for the first two years of undergraduate life, with defined options for freshmen and sophomores.   Juniors and seniors may elect to live off-campus or continue in campus housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residence Life &amp; Housing website|url=http://www.emory.edu/HOUSING/UNDERGRAD/houseopt.html|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fraternities have existed on Emory's campus as early as 1840. One early chronicler makes the case that Emory's &quot;temple&quot; of the Mystic Seven may have been the first chapter of a national fraternity established anywhere in the South. Today, the Greek-letter sororities and fraternities play an important part in leavening Emory's campus life. For undergraduates, Greek life comprises approximately 30% of the Emory student population. The Office of Greek Life recognizes and regulates on-campus chapters of fraternities and sororities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office of Sorority and Fraternity Life|url=http://www.osfl.campuslifetech.org/|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fraternities have on-campus housing located on Eagle Row, and Sorority Village, a series of townhouses, faces the fraternity houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Residence Life &amp; Housing website|url=http://www.emory.edu/HOUSING/UNDERGRAD/opt_greek.html|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Greek Life is an important social engagement for students, but it is not totally exclusive -- students from different sororities and fraternities regularly socialize, and the college's emphasis on on-campus housing helps students make friends inside and outside the Greek system.

===Dooley===
{{Split section|Dooley (mascot)|Talk:Emory University#Dooley|date=July 2011}}
[[Image:Thompson dooley.jpg|120px|right|thumb|Dooley, the unofficial [[mascot]] of Emory University]]
Traditions at Emory include Dooley,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emory University website|url=http://www.emory.edu/home/about/history/dooley.html|accessdate=2011-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;Spirit of Emory&quot; and the unofficial mascot of the university. Dooley is a [[skeleton]] and is usually dressed in black. The original Dooley was an actual skeleton from a biology/anatomy classroom. The name &quot;Dooley&quot; was given to the unofficial mascot in 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dooleystory&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://emoryhistory.emory.edu/traditions/Dooleystory.html|title=Traditions &amp; Rituals|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each year in the spring, during Dooley's Week, Dooley roams Emory's campus, flanked by bodyguards dressed in all black (&quot;Dooley guards&quot;) and lets students out of class with unscheduled appearances in classrooms. A spokesperson amongst the bodyguards walks with him to deliver his messages as he never speaks himself. His identity is unknown and how his guards are involved with the tradition is often fodder for campus gossip. He adopts the first name and middle initial of the University's current president; Dooley's current full name is James W. Dooley, after [[James W. Wagner]]. Dooley's Week culminates with Dooley's Ball, a grand celebration that takes place in the center of campus on McDonough Field. A sporting match called The Dooley Cup is played between the university administration and the [[student government association]] each spring.{{fact|date=October 2011}}

===Community service===
The university received the 2008 Presidential Award for General Community Service, which is the highest federal recognition given to higher education institutions for their commitment to community service, service-learning and civic engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emorywheel.com/detail.php?n=26552 |title=Emory Receives Top Service Recognition |publisher=''[[The Emory Wheel]]'' |date=September 2, 2009 |accessdate=2010-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 25% of Emory students participate in Volunteer Emory, Emory's umbrella community service group. As one of the most popular groups on campus, Volunteer Emory offers dozens of ways to serve the community, working with varied organizations including the Atlanta Community Food Bank, [[Trees Atlanta]], PAWS Atlanta, and Jones Boys and Girls Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://volunteer.emory.edu/|title=Volunteer Emory|publisher=Emory University|accessdate=2011-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Emory Cares International Service Day brings together students, alumni and other community members to volunteer at a number of projects organized by Emory and its many partners around the city of Atlanta and in cities worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emory Alumni Association website|url=http://www.alumni.emory.edu/volunteer-and-give/emory-cares.html|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student organizations===
Hundreds of student clubs and organizations operate on Emory's campus. These include numerous [[student government]], [[special interest]], and [[community service|service organizations]].

The Student Government Association (SGA) charters and provides most of the funding for other student groups, and represents students' interests when dealing with the administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.students.emory.edu/SGA/sga/ |title=Emory University SGA â Student Government Association |publisher=Students.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The SGA oversees divisional councils, each coinciding with the undergraduate, graduate and professional schools of the university. Notable among these are the College Council (CC) which handles students concerns primarily for the undergraduate body of the Emory College of Arts and Sciences and annually sponsors the State of Race event. The Student Programming Council (SPC) is the school's primary programming organization, responsible for planning five events every year: Homecoming Week, Fall Band Party, Spring Band Party, Swoopstock and Dooley's Week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spc.campuslifetech.org/?page_id=2 |title=Emory SPC - Official Website |publisher=Students.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Emory Wheel]]'', Emory's undergraduate student newspaper, has been continually published since 1919. It is financially independent from the university, covering its costs from self-generated advertising sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emorywheel.com/about/ |title=About |publisher=''[[The Emory Wheel]]'' |accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freebase.com/view/en/the_emory_wheel/ |title=About |publisher=''[[The Emory Wheel]]'' |accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[WMRE (Emory)|WMRE]], Emory's student operated radio station, began broadcasting in 1989. Although it was initially only available to on-campus listeners, it now enjoys a worldwide audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.students.emory.edu/WMRE/About.html |title=About |publisher=Students.emory.edu |date= |accessdate=2009-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Honor Society]], the oldest society, founded in 1902; [[Ducemus]]; Speculum; the Order of Ammon; and the Paladin Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emory University main website|url=http://www.emory.edu/home/about/history/index.html|accessdate=16 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arts===
Students may engage in the performing and fine arts as an area of academic study or as extracurricular activities. Undergraduates may pursue a major in the performing arts (dance, theater, or music) or in film studies, art history, visual arts, or creative writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arts.emory.edu/about/index.html |title=About Arts at Emory |publisher=Emory University |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Graduate programs in art history, film studies, and music are offered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gs.emory.edu/academics/index.php |title=Degree Programs |publisher=Laney Graduate School |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are more than 50 student organizations dedicated to the arts. Students can explore artistic interests as diverse as architecture, breakdancing, poetry, and improvisational comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.creativity.emory.edu/student-art-groups.shtml |title=Student Arts Groups |publisher=Emory University |accessdate=2010-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
