'''Verizon North LLC''' is a [[Verizon]] operating company providing local telephone service to former [[GTE]] customers in [[Pennsylvania]]. 

==History==
In [[2010]], when the original [[Frontier North|Verizon North]] was sold to [[Frontier Communications]], whose service region included Pennsylvania&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol39/39-49/2258.html PA Bulletin, Doc. No. 09-2258&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. The original Verizon North became [[Frontier North]], Pennsylvania operations were split into a new company, '''Verizon North Retain Company'''&lt;ref&gt;http://wutc.wa.gov/rms2.nsf/177d98baa5918c7388256a550064a61e/5f6cff42529e2356882575c8007b94e5!OpenDocument&lt;/ref&gt;.

The current company, '''Verizon North LLC''', was created in [[December]] [[2010]] and absorbed the operations of Verizon North Retain Co.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pabulletin.com/secure/data/vol40/40-40/1912.html Pennsylvania Public Service Bulletin]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is separate from [[Bell of Pennsylvania|Verizon Pennsylvania]] which provides telephone service to former [[Bell System]] lines.
