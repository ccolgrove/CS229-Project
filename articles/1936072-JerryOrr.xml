In 1973 a [[1973 Uruguayan coup d'Ã©tat|coup]] was declared in [[Uruguay]] by the president, [[Juan MarÃ­a Bordaberry]], who closed parliament and imposed direct rule from a [[military junta|junta]] of military generals. The official reason was to crush the ''Tupamaros'', a [[Marxist]] [[Urban guerrilla warfare|urban guerrilla]] movement. The [[leftist]] [[trade union]] federations called a [[general strike]] and for [[factory occupation]]s. The strike lasted just over two weeks. It was ended with most of the trade union leaders in jail, dead, or exiled to [[Argentina]]. As part of the coup all associations including trade unions were declared illegal and banned.

Unions and political parties remained illegal until a general strike in 1984 forced the military to accept civilian rule and the restoration of democracy.
