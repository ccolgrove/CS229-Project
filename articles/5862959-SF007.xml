Originally pioneered by [[Altiris]] and named Software Virtualization Solution, SWV allows applications and data to be put into virtual layers (application layers and data layers) instead of being installed to the base [[file system]] and [[Windows Registry|Registry]].  This is achieved through the use of a filter [[device driver|driver]] and layering technology [[Altiris]] acquired from FSLogic. By placing applications and data into managed layers called Virtual Software Packages (VSP's), SWV allows on-the-fly activation, deactivation, or reseting of applications, to avoid conflicts between applications, and to remove them cleanly without altering the base Windows installation.

Altiris are in partnership with AppStream to provide streaming of virtual applications.  According to a quote from DABCC.com, this will &quot;deliver virtualized, on-demand application delivery and management&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.dabcc.com/article.aspx?id=2793|title=DABCC Article}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Altiris was acquired by [[Symantec Corporation]], who are the makers of [[Norton AntiVirus]], amongst other things. SWV is available on a trial basis, but must be purchased to enable the full features.

Previous names for SWV are the before-mentioned SVS and Software Virtualization Professional.
