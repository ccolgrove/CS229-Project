'''LibreOffice Writer''' is the [[open-source]] [[word processor]] component of the [[LibreOffice]] [[Software package (installation)|software package]] and is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of [[OpenOffice.org Writer]]. Writer is a word processor similar to [[Microsoft Word]] and Corel's [[WordPerfect]], with some of their features.
