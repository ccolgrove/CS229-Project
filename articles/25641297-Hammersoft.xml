The '''[[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[Cleveland Browns]] [[List of Cleveland Browns seasons|season]]''' was the team's 64th season as a professional sports franchise and its 60th season as a member of the [[National Football League]] (NFL).  The team failed to break the longest playoff appearance drought in franchise history, a current streak of eight seasons without reaching the playoffs. The team finished 5â11, matching its win total from the [[2009 Cleveland Browns season|2009 season]] and placed third in the [[AFC North]]. This season marked the first season under the leadership of team president [[Mike Holmgren]] and general manager [[Tom Heckert, Jr.|Tom Heckert]].  It also marked the second season under head coach [[Eric Mangini]].  The Browns played all of their home games at [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] in [[Cleveland, Ohio]].

== Off-season ==
=== Personnel changes ===
On December 21, 2009, the Browns hired [[Mike Holmgren]], former [[Green Bay Packers]] head coach and [[Seattle Seahawks]] head coach and general manager, to take over as the team president. His duties will include personnel management and oversight over all operations.

Although many believed that the institution of Holmgren as president would lead to the firing of Browns' head coach [[Eric Mangini]], he announced his intent to retain Mangini and the entire coaching staff for the 2010 season on January 7, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Leahy, Sean |date=January 7, 2010 |title= Browns president Mike Holmgren will keep Eric Mangini as coach|work=USA Today |url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/01/espn-browns-president-mike-holmgren-will-keep-eric-mangini-as-coach/1 |accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, the Browns hired former [[Philadelphia Eagles]]' general manager [[Tom Heckert, Jr.|Tom Heckert]] as general manager, the first major hire by Holmgren.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Withers, Tom |date=January 10, 2010 |title= AP source: Heckert leaving Eagles for Browns|agency=Associated Press |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=ap-browns-heckert&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uniform changes===
After wearing solid brown pants with their white away jerseys during their 2009 campaign, the Browns will return to wearing their traditional white pants with orange-brown-orange lining for their 2010 away games. Furthermore, they will wear white socks with orange-brown-orange piping with these uniforms, bringing back the &quot;classic&quot; Browns away look, as well as marking a departure from the past decade when solid brown socks were worn with both the home and away uniforms. These changes were confirmed during the team's first preseason game against the Packers on August 14 and by Eric Mangini the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/08/eric-mangini-cleveland-browns-will-abandon-the-brown-pants-look/1 |title=Eric Mangini: Cleveland Browns will abandon the brown-pants look |publisher=USA Today|date= August 17, 2010|accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Browns headed to New York to take on the [[2010 Buffalo Bills season|Buffalo Bills]] for their Week 14 duel. It was a low-scoring affair due to the freezing rain pelting the field for much of the game. On their Oopening drive, the Browns drove down to the Bills' one yard line but could not get into the end. Kicker [[Phil Dawson]] kicked a 19 yard field goal in the first quarter. In the second quarter, [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] connected with [[David Nelson (American football)|David Nelson]] on an 11 yard pass for the game's only touchdown, giving the Bills a 7-3 lead. Dawson hit another field goal to pull the Browns within one, but a [[Rian Lindell]] 30 yard field goal gave the Bills a 10-6 lead at the half. Several turnovers in the second half stopped the Browns from making progress down the field, and another Lindell field goal in the fourth quarter sent the Browns to a 13-6 loss. The lone high point for the Browns was [[Peyton Hillis]], who became the first white running back to rush for over 1,000 yards in a season in 25 years.

With the loss, the Browns fell to 5&amp;ndash;8 and were eliminated from playoff contention. This marks the eighth consecutive season in which the Browns failed to make the playoffs, a franchise record.
