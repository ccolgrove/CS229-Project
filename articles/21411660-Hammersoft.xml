The '''Medupi Power Station''' is a new dry-cooled coal fired power station being built by [[Eskom]] near [[Lephalale]] in [[Limpopo]] province, [[South Africa]]. When completed, the power station will have six boilers each powering an 800 MW turbine, producing 4800 MW of power.  This will be the largest dry-cooled coal fired power station in the world.&lt;ref&gt;www.eskom.co.za/content/NB%200002MedupiPowerStation.doc&lt;/ref&gt;  Contracts have been placed with [[Hitachi]] to supply the boilers and [[Alstom]] to provide the Steam turbines for this plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tradeinvestsa.co.za/news/982506.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  At R33.6 Billion, these are the biggest contracts ever placed by Eskom.  Super-critical boilers will be used to improve the efficiency of the power plant.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/supercritical-boilers-to-improve-efficiency-at-medupi-2007-12-14&lt;/ref&gt;

Medupi will be supplied by coal from  [[Exxaro|Exxaroâs]] Grootegeluk coal mine, located to the north of the site.  Eskom has placed a contract with Exxaro to supply 14.6 MT coal per year for 40 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.engineeringnews.co.za/article/medupi-project-on-track-for-scheduled-delivery-2008-12-05&lt;/ref&gt; The first 800 MW unit is expected to be commissioned in early 2012, with the next units following at 9 month intervals.  The power station is currently expected to cost R100 Billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKLK4963152009012 | work=Reuters | deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=September 2011|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building of the coal power station has attracted widespread criticism in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-04-03-zille-says-anc-stands-to-make-r1bn-from-medupi&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have accused the ANC led government of pushing the project forward because the political party holds a 25% stake in the venture and stands to make a profit close to 1 Billion rand on the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opposition slams ANC 'about-turn' on Hitachi|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2010-04-14-opposition-slams-anc-aboutturn-on-hitachi|publisher=Mail &amp; Guardian Online|accessdate=24 May 2010|date=14 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backers of the project argue that the plant is needed to supply vital electricity to South Africa over the long term.&lt;ref&gt;http://powerplants.einnews.com/login.php?redir=%2Fnews.php%3Fwid%3D287187525&amp;n=12&lt;/ref&gt; Some point out that effective management of coal supplies was what was really needed, rather than yet another environmentally unfriendly coal station.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/2008/nationalresponse_sa_electricity1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The approval of the World Bank loan drew criticism as a massive blow to the environment and a debt burden that would cripple poverty-riddled South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2010/04/09/09climatewire-south-africa-wins-375-billion-coal-loan-17887.html?pagewanted=2 | work=The New York Times | title=South Africa Wins $3.75 Billion Coal Loan | first=Lisa | last=Friedman | date=2010-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
