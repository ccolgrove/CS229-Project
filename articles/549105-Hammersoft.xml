A '''Whitelighter''' is a [[fictional character]] featured on the [[WB Television Network|WB]] television series ''[[Charmed]]''. These beings are former human mortals who are given a second chance at life in order to serve under an angelic group known as [[Elders (Charmed)|The Elders]] as guardian angels for good witches and other future Whitelighters.

==Description==
Whitelighters are the &quot;guardian angels&quot; of good witches and future Whitelighters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Secrets and Guys|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/secrets-and-guys-1057/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 21&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Love Hurts|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/love-hurts-1064/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mortal charges are not known or seen to have much interaction with their whitelighters. They watch over their charges and intervene when necessary to help them along their path and keep them safe; they can also be called by their charges. They can constantly hear the lives of their charges in their heads,&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 92&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Siren's Song|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/siren-song-179885/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and if one of them calls their Whitelighter's name, he/she can usually show up at a moment's notice.

Whitelighters are people who were generally good people that have died.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 21&quot;/&gt; They are given the choice to become Whitelighters and given the [[Whitelighter#Powers and abilities|powers of a Whitelighter]] instead of moving on to the [[afterlife]]. Their bodies are replicas of their former human bodies, but are composed of orbs which are described as white lights (hence the term Whitelighter) that have a healing ability to them. If struck by a power that would usually kill a mortal (for example, an energy ball or particle acceleration), their bodies will explode into orbs then reform relatively unharmed;&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 101&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: House Call|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/house-call-206379/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; they can, however, be knocked unconscious.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 68&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Charmed Again (Part 2)|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/charmed-again-2-73475/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because their orbs make their bodies immortal, the only sure way to kill a Whitelighter is to poison them with a [[Darklighter]] arrow.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 21&quot;/&gt;

==Hybrids==

The type of Whitelighter hybrid seen on-screen have been the child of a witch and a Whitelighter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 67&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Charmed Again (Part 1)|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/charmed-again-1-73474/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 103&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: The Day the Magic Died|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/the-day-the-magic-died-212377/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 110&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Oh My Goddess (Part 1)|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/oh-my-goddess-1-236597/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whitelighter-witch hybrids have been shown to possess both the powers of a Whitelighter, which range from Orbing to Healing, and also witch abilities, such as spellcasting and potion making.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 67&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 110&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 121&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Charmed: Chris-Crossed|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/charmed/chris-crossed-272565/|publisher=TV.com|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the series, [[Paige Matthews]] is the first Whitelighter hybrid seen on-screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 68&quot;/&gt; She is also the first hybrid to display a magical power that has been affected by both her witch and Whitelighter halves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 68&quot;/&gt; As a witch of Warren blood and a Charmed One, Paige received the power to &quot;[[Telekinesis|move things with her mind]]&quot;, which is one of the three powers belonging to her ancestor [[Melinda Warren]]. However, since she is also a Whitelighter, her Telekinesis became [[Paige Matthews#Telekinetic Orbing|Telekinetic Orbing]], which is the ability to call for an object and orb it to the caller.&lt;ref name=&quot;Episode 68&quot;/&gt; 

Throughout the series' television run, there have been eight Whitelighter hybrids shown on-screen.

== Modern usage ==

''&quot;Whitelighter&quot;'' is also a term used in the [[Neopagan]] community, particularly amongst [[Wiccans]] to describe those who see [[Deity]] only in the &quot;good&quot;, but not in things unpleasant or unappealing. The term used in this sense is generally [[pejorative]].
