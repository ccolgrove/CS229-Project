'''''Front''''' was first published by Cabal Communications in 1998, it was created to rival [[IPC Media|IPC's]] publication ''[[Loaded (magazine)|Loaded]]'', catering to a demographic of 16- to 25-year-old males. It began as part of the [[United Kingdom|British]] &quot;[[lad mags|lads' mag]]&quot; genre of magazines though the covers rejects this description with the statement &quot;Front is no lads' mag&quot;. It also retains a much higher female readers' percentage than other magazines in the genre.

Whilst a major selling point is the photo-shoots of models, the magazine also focuses heavily on music, films, gadgets and games, plus sections on fashion and sport. Glamour shoots within the magazine usually involve well-known models rather than celebrities.

The magazine has also been responsible for a number of high profile stunts, most notably smuggling an [[Eric Cantona]] lookalike into the Manchester United team photo during a Champions League game. Today it is edited by Steve Beech and published by The Kane Corporation who are based in Soho, [[London]].

The Kane Corporation is led by self-made millionaire entrepreneur [[Dominic McVey]] (born 1985) and managing director of talent agency Money, Francis Ridley.
