'''MoD Boscombe Down''' {{Airport codes||EGDM}} is an aircraft testing site located at [[Idmiston]], south of [[Amesbury]], in [[Wiltshire]], [[England]]. It is run and managed by [[QinetiQ]], the company created as part of the breakup of the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] in 2001 by the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]. It is the home of the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]].

The site was formerly known as '''RAF Boscombe Down''' and since 1939 has evaluated aircraft for the British armed forces.

==History==

Aircraft testing at the airfield started when the [[Aeroplane and Armament Experimental Establishment]] (A&amp;AEE) moved from [[RAF Martlesham Heath]] in August 1939, as [[World War II]] hostilities commenced, when the airfield was the [[RAF Station]] Boscombe Down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.adastral.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=51 | title= Site History | work= UCL Adastral Park Post Graduate Campus | accessdate= 2007-10-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070810203624/http://www.adastral.ucl.ac.uk/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=48&amp;Itemid=51 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site has witnessed many significant developments in the British aviation industry, including trials of many aircraft flown by the British armed forces since the [[Second World War]], such as the first flights of the English Electric P 1, forerunner of the [[English Electric Lightning|Lightning]], and the [[BAC TSR-2|BAC TSR.2]]. It was also formerly home to the School of Aviation Medicine.

In 1992 the site was renamed the ''Aircraft and Armament Evaluation Establishment'' when experimental work moved to the [[Defence Research Agency]]. Responsibility for the site passed from the [[MoD Procurement Executive]] to the Defence Test and Evaluation Organisation (DTEO) in 1993, and subsequently to the [[Defence Evaluation and Research Agency]] in 1995.

Following the creation of [[QinetiQ]] in 2001, a 25 year Long Term Partnering Agreement (LTPA) was established with the MOD. Boscombe Down remains a government airfield but operated by QinetiQ on behalf of the MOD. The Joint Test and Evaluation Group was established under the control of [[RAF Air Command]] and together with QinetiQ forms the Aircraft Test and Evaluation Centre (ATEC). This unique partnership is charged with the test and evaluation of future and in-service military aircraft. The military personnel of the JTEG play a central role in the test and evaluation process alongside their QinetiQ colleagues.

A small part of Boscombe's history is being preserved in the US. The Anglo American Lightning Organisation are returning to flight the former ETPS [[English Electric Lightning]], XS422. The group is basing the restoration in the US as the CAA is expected to refuse permission for the aircraft to fly in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lightning422supporters.co.uk/pages/html/index1.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The voluntary group, made up of RAF and former-RAF engineers, as well as civilian volunteers, has been carrying out a 'floor-up' restoration and as of spring 2008 were around 80% mechanically complete. It is hoped, funds permitting, that XS422 will be ready for flight within the next 12 months. The project is currently seeking investors and supporters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

==Today==
The site has two runways, one of {{convert|3212|m|abbr=on|0}} in length and the second {{Convert|1914|m|abbr=on|0}}. It is home to [[Rotary Wing Test Squadron]], Fast Jet Test Squadron, [[Heavy Aircraft Test Squadron]], Handling Squadron, and the [[Empire Test Pilots' School]]. It is also currently home to the [[Southampton University Air Squadron]] [http://www.southamptonuas.co.uk/public/public.php].

Boscombe Down has been associated with rumours concerning [[U.S.]] [[black projects]]. An incident is reported to have occurred there on 26 September 1994, although evidence is scarce, and both the British and American Governments have refused to comment on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dreamlandresort.com/black_projects/boscombe.htm|title=RAF Boscombe Down's Black Day|accessdate=2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/secret-us-spyplane-crash-may-be-kept-under-wraps-1272714.html |title=Secret US spyplane crash may be kept under wraps |publisher=[[The Independent]] |last1=Bellamy |first1=Christopher |last2=Walker |first2=Timothy |date=14 March 1997 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007 it was announced that RAF Boscombe Down would become a quick reaction alert (QRA) airbase from early 2008, offering round-the-clock fighter coverage for the South and South West of UK airspace.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.salisburyjournal.co.uk/display.var.1792468.0.air_base_in_front_line_fullyarmed.php Air base in front line fully-armed]'' - ''[[Salisbury Journal]]'', Monday 29 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to media reports QRA aircraft will only be based at Boscombe Down if and when a specific threat to the region is deemed to exist.

A well preserved [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] [[coffin]] was found to the west of the site in 2007, on what is now the 'Archers Gate' development.&lt;ref name=&quot;romancoffin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wessexarch.co.uk/blogs/news/2008/01/14/video-boscombe-down-roman-coffin|title=Video of the Boscombe Down Roman coffin|date=14 January 2008|publisher=Wessex Archaeology|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
