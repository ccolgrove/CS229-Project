'''xine''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|k|s|iË|n}})&lt;ref name=pronunciation&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xine-project.org/faq#pronounce | title=xine FAQ, ''How do I pronounce &quot;xine&quot;?'' |publisher=xine-project.org | accessdate=2006-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[multimedia]] playback engine for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s released under the [[GNU General Public License]]. xine is built around a [[shared library]] (xine-lib) that supports different frontend player applications. Another important feature of xine is the ability to manually correct the [[synchronization]] of audio and video streams. xine uses libraries from other projects such as [[liba52]], [[libmpeg2]], [[FFmpeg]], [[MPEG Audio Decoder|libmad]], [[FAAD2]], and [[Ogle DVD Player|Ogle]].&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xine-project.org/about | title=About xine |publisher=xine-project.org | accessdate=2006-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; xine can also use binary Windows codecs through a wrapper, bundled as the w32codecs, for playback of some media formats that are not handled natively.&lt;ref name=&quot;features&quot; /&gt;

== History==

xine was started in 2000 by GÃ¼nter Bartsch shortly after [[LinuxTag]]. At that time playing [[DVD]]s in [[Linux]] was described as a tortuous process&lt;ref name=ancient_linux_dvd&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/Linux-HOWTO/DVD-HOWTO.html | title=Ancient Linux DVD HOWTO (How DVDs were played on Linux in the twentieth century) |publisher=faqs.org | accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; since one had to manually create audio and video [[named pipe]]s and start their separated decoder processes.

GÃ¼nter realized the OMS (Open Media System) or [[LiViD]] approach had obvious shortcomings in terms of audio and video synchronization, so xine was born as an experiment trying to get it right. The project evolved into a modern media player [[multi-threaded]] architecture.&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.xine-project.org/hackersguide#AEN467 | title=The xine hacker's guide - Engine architecture and data flow |publisher=xine-project.org | accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During xine development, some effort was dedicated to making a clear separation of the player engine (xine-lib) and [[Front-end and back-end|front-end]] (xine-ui). Since the 1.0 release (2004-12-25) the API of xine-lib is considered stable and several applications and players rely on it.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

GÃ¼nter left the project in 2003 when he officially announced the new project leaders, Miguel Freitas, Michael Roitzsch, Mike Melanson and Thibaut Mattern.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

== DVD issues ==
Since it is not a member of [[DVD Forum]], the xine project is not contractually obliged to insert [[user operation prohibition]] such as disallowing fast-forward or skipping during trailers and ads.  However, without membership in the Forum, the project also cannot make xine play DVDs [[encryption|encrypted]] with [[Content Scrambling System|CSS]] except by using
reverse-engineered code.  xine therefore uses the [[libdvdcss]] library, which was created by reverse engineering.  The legal status of libdvdcss is questionable in several nations; in the [[United States]], for example, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] [[Universal v. Reimerdes|arguably prohibits reverse-engineering]] of CSS. Virtually all commercial DVDs are encrypted with CSS.

== Other issues ==
To prevent a screensaver from starting, xine sends a [[scroll lock]] key signal to the environment to pretend keyboard interaction took place. This can often lead to issues with other programs running as they receive the scroll lock key as normal input. One example is the [[Konsole]] terminal emulator, which changes the behaviour of the arrow keys when scroll lock is used.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

== xine backend ==
The shared library (xine-lib) used and developed by xine is also used by other projects. For example, it can be used instead of [[GStreamer]] as a backend for the [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]] media framework used by [[KDE]] and [[Qt (framework)|Qt]].
