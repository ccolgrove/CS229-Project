'''MLDonkey''' is an [[open source]], multi-protocol, [[peer-to-peer]] [[file sharing]] application that runs as a back-end server application on many platforms. It can be controlled through a user interface provided by one of many separate front-ends, including a Web interface, telnet interface and over a dozen native client programs.

Originally a [[Linux]] client for the [[EDonkey network|eDonkey]] protocol, it now runs on many flavors of [[Unix-like]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[MorphOS]] and supports numerous peer-to-peer protocols.

It is written in [[Objective Caml]], with some [[C (programming language)|C]] and even some [[Assembly language|assembly]].

== History ==

Development of the software began in late 2001. The original developer of MLDonkey is Fabrice Le Fessant from [[Institut national de recherche en informatique et en automatique|INRIA]]. It was originally conceived as an effort to spread the use of Objective Caml in the open source community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/inria-00071789/en/ Fabrice Le Fessant; MLdonkey, a Multi-Network Peer-to-Peer File-Sharing Program]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2003, [[Slyck.com]] reported brief friction between MLDonkey developers and the official [[Overnet]] MetaMachine developers, which denounced MLDonkey as a &quot;rogue client&quot;, allegedly for incorrect behavior on the network.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Mennecke, [http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=34 Rogue Clients and Overnet], January 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Versions before 3.0 have a known security vulnerability that allows an attacker with access to the web interface to read any file on the file system.&lt;ref&gt;DJ Walker-Morgan, [http://www.h-online.com/security/news/item/MLDonkey-3-0-closes-security-hole-740577.html MLDonkey 3.0 closes security hole], [[Heinz Heise|H-online]], 16 March 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
Features of MLdonkey core:

* Peer to peer (p2p) program that supports the following network protocols, either partially or completely:
**  [[eDonkey network]]
**  [[Overnet]]
**  [[BitTorrent (protocol)|BitTorrent]]
**  [[Kad Network]]
**  [[Direct Connect (file sharing)|Direct Connect]]
**  [[HTTP]]/[[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]]
* Multiple control interfaces: telnet, web interface, third party GUIs.

Written in the [[Ocaml]] programming language and licensed under the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]], the application separates the user interface (which can be a [[web browser]], [[telnet]], or a third-party [[GUI]] application) and the code that interacts with the peer-to-peer networks.

MLDonkey is able to connect simultaneously to different peers using different network protocols. In addition it can download and merge parts of one file from different network protocols&lt;ref&gt;[http://mldonkey.sourceforge.net/Merge Latest cores (above 2.5.28) contain an experimental feature: swarming between networks]&lt;/ref&gt; although this feature is currently documented as experimental. MLDonkey runs in a terminal session and does not require a GUI environment, saving memory and processing resources. Behavior is controlled by editable configuration files, orâin a more user friendly fashionâfrom a separate user interface.

From release 2.9.0 on, support for [[gnutella]] and [[Gnutella2|G2]] are no longer compiled in by default as both plugins are buggy and currently unmaintained; however, it is still possible to compile them in by making the appropriate setting in the configuration file.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=719769 MLDonkey will no longer compile in Gnutella and G2 support by default]&lt;/ref&gt;
