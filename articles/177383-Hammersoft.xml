The band formed in 1996 when musicians [[Dan Donegan]], [[Steve Kmak|Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak]], and [[Mike Wengren]] hired [[David Draiman]] as their singer. Since the band's formation, they have sold over 13 million albums worldwide, making them one of the largest grossing metal/rock bands in recent years.&lt;ref name=&quot;disturbedsuccess&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/video_news/disturbed_success_disturbing_to_some.html |title=Disturbed Success Disturbing To Some|date=September 12, 2008|publisher=Ultimate Guitar|accessdate=April 27, u2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band has released five studio albums, four of which have consecutively debuted at number-one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Asylum beats KP for #1 Album&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.hitfix.com/blogs/the-beat-goes-on/posts/does-katy-perry-get-disturbed-on-the-billboard-200| title= Disturbed's Asylum beats Katy Perry for #1 Album| publisher= ''HitFix''|date= September 7, 2010|accessdate= September 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, vocalist David Draiman stated that the band will not be touring in 2012 and will go on a [[hiatus]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sputnikmusic.com&quot;&gt;http://sputnikmusic.com/news.php?newsid=18667&lt;/ref&gt; In interviews, the band has said that the band will not be breaking up permanently and this will be temporary.

==History==
===Early years as Brawl (1994â1996)===
Before vocalist [[David Draiman]] joined Disturbed, they were known as Brawl. Brawl's lineup consisted of vocalist Erich Awalt, guitarist [[Dan Donegan]], drummer [[Mike Wengren]], and bassist [[Steve &quot;Fuzz&quot; Kmak]]. Before changing their name to &quot;Brawl&quot;, however, Donegan mentioned in the band's DVD, ''Decade of Disturbed'', that the name was originally going to be called &quot;Crawl&quot;; they switched it to &quot;Brawl&quot;, due to the name already being used by another band. Awalt left the band shortly after the recording of a demo tape; the other three members advertised for a singer. They posted an advertisement in the local music publication in [[Chicago, Illinois]], called the &quot;Illinois Entertainer&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.O.L. DVD&quot;&gt;{{cite DVD-notes |title=M.O.L. |titleyear=2002 |director=Nathan &quot;Karma&quot; Cox |format=booklet |publisher= |location= |publisherid= |year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draiman answered the advertisement after going to twenty other auditions that month.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.O.L. DVD&quot; /&gt; Guitarist Dan Donegan commented on Draiman: &quot;You know, out of all the singers that we had talked to or auditioned, he [Draiman] was the only singer who was ready to go with originals. And that impressed me, just to attempt that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.O.L. DVD&quot; /&gt;

With regard to Draiman being the new singer for the band, Donegan said, &quot;After a minute or two, he just starts banging out these melodies that were huge...I'm playing my guitar and I'm grinning from ear to ear, trying not to give it away that I like this guy, you know, because I don't want to, you know...[say] 'Yeah, we'll give you a call back. We'll, you know, discuss it.' But I was so psyched. Chill up my spine. I'm like, 'There is something here'.&quot; As drummer Mike Wengren commented, &quot;We clicked right off the bat.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;M.O.L. DVD&quot;/&gt; Draiman then joined the band in 1996 and the band was re-named Disturbed. When asked in an interview why he suggested to name the band Disturbed, Draiman said, &quot;It had been a name I have been contemplating for a band for years. It just seems to symbolize everything we were feeling at the time. The level of conformity that people are forced into was disturbing to us and we were just trying to push the envelope and the name just sorta made sense.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.concertlivewire.com/interviews/disturbed.htm |title=David Draiman of Disturbed Interview&amp;nbsp;â One on One |publisher=concertlivewire.com |date=February 19, 2005 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Sickness'' (1998â2000)===
After re-naming the band, Disturbed went on to record two 3-track demo tapes, the first having the demos for [[The Game (Disturbed song)|&quot;The Game&quot;]], &quot;[[Down with the Sickness]]&quot;, and &quot;Meaning of life&quot;, with the second having the demos for &quot;Want&quot;, &quot;[[Stupify]]&quot;, and &quot;Droppin' Plates&quot;. The artwork was composed of the band's recently created mascot, The Guy. The band eventually signed with [[Giant Records (Warner)|Giant Records]]. In 2000, the band released its debut album, titled ''[[The Sickness]]'', which launched the band into stardom. The album peaked at number twenty-nine on the ''[[Billboard 200]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p415878|pure_url=yes}} |title=Disturbed &gt; Charts &amp; Awards &gt; Billboard Albums |publisher=Macrovision |accessdate=March 6, 2009 |work=Allmusic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it has sold over four million copies in the United States since its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/BLABBERMOUTH.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=101575 |title=Disturbed Interviewed on KISW's 'The Men's Room'; Audio Available |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=July 25, 2008 |accessdate=March 6, 2009 |work=Blabbermouth.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before joining [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]'s 2001 European tour, bassist Steve Kmak was unable to play with the band due to a shattered ankle, caused by falling out of a fire escape outside Disturbed's rehearsal hall in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;fuzzinjury&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1437929/20010112/disturbed.jhtml |title=Disturbed Bassist Won't Make European Trek Due To Injury |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |publisher=MTV |date=January 12, 2001 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He took the fire escape to exit the building while the elevator was being used to move their equipment downstairs. After a successful operation, doctors highly recommended that Kmak skip the tour to avoid more severe damage to his foot.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} But he did perform with the band on January 11 and 12, 2001 at Disturbed's show in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;fuzzinjury&quot; /&gt; During the European tour, [[Marty O'Brien]] replaced Kmak until he was able to tour again.

===''Believe'' (2001â2003)===
In February 2001, it was announced that the band had covered the song &quot;[[Midlife Crisis]]&quot; for a [[Faith No More]] tribute album,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439351/20010213/faith_no_more.jhtml |title=Faith No More Tribute To Feature Papa Roach, Disturbed |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |publisher=MTV |date=February 13, 2001 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the cover was not used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amazon.com/Tribute-Year-Faith-No-More/dp/B000069JJZ |title=A Tribute of the Year: Tribute to Faith No More |publisher=Amazon |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 4, 2002, Disturbed released a documentary DVD about the band, titled [[M.O.L.]], which showed some of the band's more personal moments in the studio and during tours, as well as featuring several music videos and live performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=3566 |title=Disturbed to Issue DVD in June |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=May 18, 2002 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 17, 2002, Disturbed released their second studio album, titled ''[[Believe (Disturbed album)|Believe]]'', which debuted at number-one on the ''Billboard 200''.&lt;ref name=&quot;believeno1debut&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1457783/20020925/disturbed.jhtml |title=Believe It: Disturbed Top Billboard Albums Chart |first=Joe |last=D'Angelo |publisher=MTV |date=September 25, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music video for the first single from the album, titled &quot;[[Prayer (song)|Prayer]]&quot;, was pulled from most television stations, due to the similarities it had with the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=5261 |title=Disturbed Clip Too &quot;Disturbing&quot; for Video Outlets |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=August 6, 2002 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Draiman]] recorded vocals for a song titled &quot;Forsaken&quot;, a song written and produced by [[Jonathan Davis]] of the band [[Korn]], released on ''[[Queen of the Damned (soundtrack)|Queen of the Damned]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDnotes&quot;&gt;{{cite album-notes|title=Queen of the Damned soundtrack|albumlink=Queen of the Damned (soundtrack)|year=2002|format=insert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Believe record cycle, [[Mike Wengren]] mentioned on ''Decade of Disturbed'' that he could not remember much of this time, that it was a darker time for him and that he used [[alcohol]] as a [[coping skill]]. This was mainly due to his mother battling cancer, the tension between him and the rest of the band, and his fiancÃ©e at the time leaving him. He also stated that he would use his &quot;Mikey Chronicles&quot;, which were of him acting comedic, to numb the problems.

In 2003, the band once again participated in the Ozzfest tour and started another one of their own tours, titled Music as a Weapon II. The bands [[Chevelle]], [[Taproot (band)|Taproot]], and [[Unloco]] toured with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=16012 |title=Disturbed to Unleash 'Weapon' in November |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=October 16, 2003 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the tour, Disturbed debuted an unreleased song, titled &quot;Dehumanized&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=10731 |title=Music as a Weapon Tour to Result in Live CD |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=March 21, 2003 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Disturbed finished the Music as a Weapon II tour, Steve Kmak was fired by the band because of &quot;personality differences&quot;. He was replaced by [[John Moyer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;newbassplayer&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.ultimate-guitar.com/news/general_music_news/disturbed_finds_new_bassist.html|title=Disturbed Finds New Bassist|date=2004-05-04|accessdate=2008-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hometown Gig&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=25277 |title=Disturbed Debut New Bassist at Hometown Gig |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=July 30, 2004 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who is now the current bass player. On the night Moyer became the band's new bass player, Disturbed played live at the [[House of Blues]] and performed two new songs, &quot;Hell&quot; and &quot;Monster&quot;, both of which are B-side tracks on the band's third studio album, ''[[Ten Thousand Fists]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hometown Gig&quot; /&gt;

===''Ten Thousand Fists'' (2004â2006)===
Disturbed's third studio album, ''Ten Thousand Fists'', was released on September 20, 2005. The album debuted at number-one on the ''Billboard 200'', while also selling around 238,000 copies in the week following its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=46114 |title=Disturbed Drummer: 'We Don't Pigeonhole Ourselves in Metal' |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=December 27, 2005 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album was certified platinum, shipping 1,000,000 units, in the United States on January 5, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.Net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=46439 |title=Disturbed: 'Ten Thousand Fists' Certified Platinum |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=January 5, 2006 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band toured with [[10 Years (band)|10 Years]] and [[Ill NiÃ±o]] in support of the album. Disturbed headlined Ozzfest 2006 along with [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[System of a Down]], [[Lacuna Coil]], [[DragonForce]], [[Avenged Sevenfold]], and [[Hatebreed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=18272 |title=Official Ozzfest 2006 Lineup Revealed |publisher=Metal Underground |date=March 9, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Launch Radio Networks, Disturbed vocalist [[David Draiman]] stated that twenty songs were recorded for the album, but only fourteen made it to the final track listing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=39268 |title=DISTURBED: Fan Club Edition Of New Album To Include Bonus Tracks |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining songs included &quot;Hell&quot;, which was included in one of the two &quot;[[Stricken (song)|Stricken]]&quot; singles;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t10464360|pure_url=yes}} |title=Hell Disturbed |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Monster&quot;, which was included as an iTunes pre-order bonus for ''Ten Thousand Fists'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spawn.com/news/news6.aspx?id=12687 |title=Listen to New Disturbed Ten Thousand Fists Album Here |work=TMP International, Inc. |publisher=Spawn |date=September 16, 2005 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; then later included on the ''Ten Thousand Fists'' Tour Edition; &quot;Two Worlds&quot;, which was also included on the Tour Edition of ''Ten Thousand Fists''; and &quot;Sickened&quot;, which was included in the &quot;[[Land of Confusion#Disturbed cover version and video|Land of Confusion]]&quot; single.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t10557123|pure_url=yes}} |title=Sickened Disturbed |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Ten Thousand Fists'' is the first album released by Disturbed to feature guitar solos. The band stated that they felt that guitar solos are a part of music that is absent in a lot of modern music, and they wanted to bring some of that back. Songs like &quot;Stricken&quot;, &quot;Overburdened&quot;, and &quot;Land of Confusion&quot; all feature guitar solos, as well as many others.

In 2006, a European tour was scheduled but had been moved twice due to Draiman having troubles with severe acid reflux, which affected his voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;tourpostponevoicetroubles&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=49933 |title=Disturbed Singer David Draiman Bleeds For His Music |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draiman commented, &quot;I had been taking [[Lansoprazole|Prevacid]] for about four years and my body built up a resistance to it, to the point where it wasn't doing anything anymore...I had a night of drinking in London followed by a full day and night of drinking on a day off in Dublin, because what else is there to do in Ireland but drink? That, coupled with a show where I had monitor problems, and I pretty much trashed my voice.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;draimanstatementvoiceproblems&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1513924/20051116/disturbed.jhtml |title=Life Is Sweet For Disturbed â Apart From A Little Acid Reflux |first=Jon |last=Wiederhorn |publisher=MTV |date=November 16, 2005 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Later that year, Draiman underwent surgery for a deviated septum which affected his voice.&lt;ref name=&quot;draimanstatementvoiceproblems&quot;/&gt; It was successful, and ever since then, Draiman has limited his drinking on the road.&lt;ref name=&quot;draimaninterview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/23565422/ |title=Draiman proud soldiers are feeling Disturbed |first=Doug |last=Miller |publisher=MSNBC |date=March 16, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Draiman became involved in the [[peer-to-peer file sharing]] controversy by publicly speaking out against the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]]'s lawsuits against file sharing individuals, despite the fact his record label is a member of the RIAA. Draiman commented, &quot;This is not rocket science. Instead of spending all this money litigating against kids who are the people they're trying to sell things to in the first place, they have to learn how to effectively use the Internet. For the artists, my ass...I didn't ask them to protect me, and I don't want their protection.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;draimanonillegaldownloading&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=13496 |title=Disturbed's David Draiman Offers 'Solution' To Illegal Music Downloading |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=July 11, 2003 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draiman also told NYRock: &quot;[I'm] Very positive about the internet, Napster. I think it's a tremendous tool for reaching many more people than we ever could without it. When you release music you want it to be heard by people...Nothing is going to do that better than Napster. I can't tell you how many kids have come up to me and said, 'I downloaded a couple of tunes off Napster and I went out and bought the album.'...I don't really make money off of record sales anyway.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nyrock.com/interviews/2001/disturbed_int.asp |title=Interview with David Draiman of Disturbed |publisher=NY Rock |date=July 2001 |author=Gabriella |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an earlier interview, David Draiman briefly talked about the band's fifth studio album, stating that the album will be as dark as their previous album, ''Indestructible'', if not darker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=108748 |title=Disturbed Frontman Talks Engagement, Next Single |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=November 12, 2008 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draiman also stated that the album is &quot;still identifiably Disturbed, but showing more maturation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;disturbed1.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disturbed1.com/news/ |title=News &amp;#124; Disturbed |publisher=Disturbed1.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Song-writing for the fifth studio album began in late 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBB20090616&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=122149 |title=Disturbed In Milan: Video Footage, Photos Available |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=June 18, 2009 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an earlier interview with Mike Wengren and John Moyer, it was stated that, judging by Draiman's feelings on the last few years of his life, that Disturbed's new album will be aggressive, angry, and &quot;hard-hitting&quot;, but will be similar musically to their album ''Believe''. Wengren also said that the new album may be released in the spring or summer of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sonicexcess.com/disturbed_interview.html |title=Photos and interview with Disturbed |publisher=Sonicexcess.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Draiman has confirmed that a DVD is in the works.&lt;ref name=&quot;RRBB20090616&quot; /&gt; A countdown clock appeared on the band's website, which ended on January 12, 2010 at 5:00 p.m. EST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=132959 |title=Disturbed: Official DVD Announcement Expected Next Week |work=Blabbermouth.net |publisher=Roadrunner Records |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a trailer for the upcoming DVD, titled ''Decade of Disturbed'', was revealed.

On April 20, 2010, roughly two months after they entered the studio, Disturbed announced that they had finished recording the album, and were ready to begin mixing the album in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. As they did with their last album ''Indestructible'', Disturbed stated that they self-produced ''Asylum''.&lt;ref name=&quot;disturbed1.com&quot;/&gt; The band announced that ''Asylum'' would be released on August 31, 2010.

On Thursday, April 28, Disturbed announced that their previously unreleased bonus track from ''Asylum'', titled &quot;3&quot;, would be available for download on their [http://www.disturbed1.com website]. They said that all proceeds made from the download of the song would go towards the Damien Echols Defense Fund, a benefit foundation supporting the release of the [[West Memphis Three]].

In an interview on July 13, 2011, Draiman announced that not only will Disturbed not be touring their sixth annual Music as a Weapon tour next year, they will not be touring during the year 2012 at all. They will be going on an indefinite hiatus due to personal reasons with each of the band members. Draiman stated, &quot;We're not gonna do our own thing. This is gonna be the last tour that the American people get to see us in for awhile, if not indefinitely. We have some things going on internally, we have some personal things going on. You're not gonna see a Disturbed tour for awhile.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;sputnikmusic.com&quot;/&gt;

In a later interview, Draiman stressed that the hiatus is not the result of conflict between the band members. &quot;This is really not due to any animosity. I want to make that very clear. In fact, we just had dinner together last night. Believe me, it's not like we can't work with each other any more or we don't get along. This isn't a bad blood thing, and I don't ever want people to get that impression of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.billboard.com/#/news/disturbed-s-draiman-on-band-s-hiatus-it-1005297902.story&lt;/ref&gt;

Disturbed released a b-side compilation album, titled ''[[The Lost Children (album)|The Lost Children]]'', on November 8, 2011. The song &quot;[[Hell (Disturbed song)|Hell]]&quot; was made available for digital download on October 11, 2011, but Draiman stated on his Twitter page that there would not be a music video for it. A previously unreleased track, titled &quot;Mine&quot;, also appears on the album. The track listing and release date were revealed on Draiman's Twitter page on September 20.

==Mascot==
Disturbed's mascot, named &quot;The Guy&quot;, was originally just a drawing of a face with a large grin, as seen on the back of the album ''[[The Sickness]]''. The original drawing of The Guy was then edited using a digital distorting program. After the original image had been distorted three times The Guy became the official mascot for the band. Later, he would be drawn as a full figure by artist [[David Finch (comics)|David Finch]].

{{quote|We probably have too much melody going on or we're not quite as turbulent or caustic. While I really love that type of music, it's not what we try to do.

Allmusic reviewer Bradley Torreano described the album ''[[Believe (Disturbed album)|Believe]]'' as &quot;taking the sort of jump that their heroes in [[Soundgarden]] and Pantera made after their respective breakthrough records&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusicreview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Overview Believe Disturbed |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r607468|pure_url=yes}} |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also described the title track as moving &quot;from a brutal chug to a sweeping chorus that suddenly stops in its tracks and turns into a winding [[riff]] that recalls the work of vintage [[James Hetfield]]&quot;.
''Believe'' is also considered by several critics to be a step away from the [[industrial metal]] sound featured on ''[[The Sickness]]'', moving towards a more hard rock/heavy metal sound that was continued in their following albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;411mania.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.411mania.com/music/album_reviews/822/Disturbed-%E2%80%93-Ten-Thousand-Fists-Review.htm |title=Disturbed â Ten Thousand Fists Review |first=Brandon |last=Ratliff |publisher=411 Mania |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;blender.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.blender.com/guide/new/50905/believe.html |title=Review Disturbed Believe |first=Ben |last=Mitchell |publisher=Blender |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ew.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,350620,00.html |title=Music Review Believe (2002) Disturbed |publisher=Entertainment Weekly |first=Josh |last=Tyrangiel |date=September 20, 2002 |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r1382607|pure_url=yes}} |title=Review Indestructible Disturbed |first=James Christopher |last=Monger |publisher=Allmusic |accessdate=April 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to frontman David Draiman on the band home documentary ''[[M.O.L.]]'', the lyrics that he writes are inspired by life experience, perception, and actual experiences of his own, and he stated that he likes to present his ideas with cryptic lyrics.&lt;ref name=&quot;M.O.L. DVD&quot; /&gt;

Guitarist Dan Donegan typically uses tunings such as drop C# and [[Drop C tuning|drop C]], which are lower tunings than regular E standard. These lower tunings allow for a darker, more mysterious feel in Donegan's riffs. Donegan also uses subtle electronic effects to add to the fullness of the music, which the rest of the band refers to as &quot;The Danny Donegan Orchestra&quot;.
