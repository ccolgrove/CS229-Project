'''Window Clippings''' is a [[Microsoft Windows]] software application that enables users to capture screenshots from open windows and menus so that the transparency ([[alpha channel]]) of target window is also captured.  This includes shadows and translucent glass areas produced by [[Windows Aero]] in Windows Vista and 7.

Window Clippings 2.0.28 was the last [[freeware]] version.  Version 2.1.16 and onwards watermark the screenshots in the lower right corner (version 2) or in the center (version 3) of each image.

Window Clippings supports add-ins which extend its functionality. Window Clippings 2.1 comes with a handful of add-ins that enable it to send taken screenshots directly to [[Paint.NET]] or [[Microsoft OneNote]].
