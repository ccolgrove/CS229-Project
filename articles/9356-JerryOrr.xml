'''El Salvador''' or simply '''Salvador'''&lt;ref name=covenant&gt;{{cite web|title=THE COVENANT OF THE LEAGUE OF NATIONS.|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/imt/parti.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|audio=En-us-El Salvador.ogg|É|l|_|Ë|s|Ã¦|l|v|É|d|Ér}} ({{lang-es|RepÃºblica de El Salvador|links=no}}, literally 'Republic of The Savior') is the smallest and the most densely populated country in [[Central America]]. The country's capital city and largest city is [[San Salvador]]; [[Santa Ana, El Salvador|Santa Ana]] and [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] are also important cultural and commercial centers in the country and in all of Central America. El Salvador borders the Pacific Ocean on the west, and the countries of [[Guatemala]] to the north and [[Honduras]] to the east. Its eastern-most region lies on the coast of the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], opposite [[Nicaragua]]. As of 2009, El Salvador had a population of approximately 5,744,113 people, composed predominantly of [[Mestizo]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNdata&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Salvadoran colÃ³n|colÃ³n]] was the official currency of El Salvador from 1892 to 2001, when it adopted the [[U.S. Dollar]]. In 2010 El Salvador ranked in the top 10 among Latin American countries in terms of the Human Development Index and in the top 3 in Central America (behind Costa Rica and Panama); because of this, the country is currently undergoing rapid [[industrialization]].

El Salvador was explored and settled by the Spanish in the 16th century and remained a territory of Spain until 1821, when it joined Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras and Nicaragua in a union named the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]. When this union dissolved in 1841, El Salvador maintained its own government until it joined Honduras and Nicaragua in 1896 to form the [[Greater Republic of Central America]], which later dissolved in 1898. El Salvador's origins of human civilization date back to the [[Pipil people]] of CuzcatlÃ¡n, which means ''The Place of Precious Diamonds and Jewels''. The people of El Salvador are variably referred to as Salvadoran or Salvadorian, while the term ''Cuzcatleco'' is commonly used to identify someone of Salvadoran heritage.

==History==
{{Main|History of El Salvador}}
[[File:ES JoyadeCeren 06 2011 Estructura 9 Area 2 Tamazcal 2106.jpg|thumb|left|Temazcal in Joya de Ceren|200px]]

===Pre-Columbian===
In pre-Columbian times the territory was inhabited by various Native American peoples, including the [[Pipil people|Pipil]], a [[Nahuatl languag|Nahuatl-speaking]] population that occupied the central and western regions of the territory, and the Lenca, who settled in the east of the country. The larger domain until the [[Spanish conquest of the Americas|Spanish conquest]] of the kingdom was CuzcatlÃ¡n. The [[Mayan civilization]]  which inhabited El Salvador has left ruins such as those at Tazumal, Joya De Ceren, San Andres, Casa Blanca, Cihuatan, and Chalchuapa.

===Discovery===
In 1520 the indigenous population of the territory had been reduced by 80% due to the smallpox epidemic that affected the [[Mesoamerican]] area. The Spanish Admiral [[AndrÃ©s NiÃ±o]] led an expedition to Central America and disembarked on Meanguera island, which he named Petronila, in the [[Gulf of Fonseca]], on May 31, 1522. Thereafter he discovered [[Jiquilisco Bay]] on the mouth of [[Lempa River]]. This was the first known visit by Spaniards to what is now Salvadoran territory.

====Conquest of CuzcatlÃ¡n====

The Spanish [[Conquistadors]] led by [[Pedro de Quintanilla]] and his brother Gonzalo arrived between 1524 and 1525 from the area comprising the present Republic of Guatemala, after participating in the conquest of Mexico and crossing the Rio Paz (Peace River) into what is now the Republic of El Salvador. The Pipil had no treasure but held land with rich and fertile soil, good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in El Salvador as they had in other places like Guatemala or Mexico, but recognized the richness of the verdant land's volcanic soil. 

Pedro de Alvarado led the first incursion by Spanish forces to extend their dominion to the nation of [[CuzcatlÃ¡n]] (El Salvador), in June 1524. On June 8, 1524, the conquerors arrived in the neighborhood of [[Acajutla]] at a village called Acaxual. There, according to records,
a battle ensued between the opposing armies, with the [[Pipils]] wearing cotton armor (of three fingers' thickness according to Alvarado) and carrying long lances. This circumstance would be crucial in the progression of the battle. Alvarado approached the Pipil lines with his archers' showers of crossbow arrows, but the natives did not retreat. The conquistador noticed the proximity of a nearby hill and knew that it could be a convenient hiding place for his opponents. Alvarado pretended that his army had given up the battle and had retreated. The Pipils then suddenly rushed the invaders giving Alvarado an opportunity to inflict massive losses. The Pipils that fell to the ground could not get back on their feet, hindered by the weight of their cotton armor, which enabled the Spanish to slaughter them. 

In the words of Alvarado: &quot;...the destruction was so great that in just a short time there were none which were left alive...&quot;. However, Alvarado's army were not completely unscathed. In the battle Alvarado himself was struck by a sling shot to his thigh which fractured his femur bone. According to local tradition the stone that hit the conquistador was hurled by a Pipil &quot;Tatoni&quot; (a prince), called Atonal. The resultant infection lasted about eight months and left Alvarado partially crippled. In spite of this wound, he continued the conquest campaign with relish. 

The Spanish efforts were firmly resisted by the indigenous people, including the Pipil and their Mayan speaking neighbors. Despite Alvarado's initial success in the [[Battle of Acajutla]], the people of CuzcatlÃ¡n, who according to tradition were led by a warlord called [[Atlacatl]], defeated the Spaniards and forced them to withdraw to Guatemala. There Pedro de Alvarado was again wounded, this time on his left thigh, which left him handicapped for the rest of his life. He abandoned the war and appointed his brother, [[Gonzalo de Alvarado]], to continue the task. Two subsequent expeditions were required (the first in 1525, followed by a smaller group in 1528) to bring the Pipil under Spanish control. In 1525 the conquest of CuzcatlÃ¡n was completed and the city of [[San Salvador]] was established. They faced much resistance from the Pipils and were not able to reach eastern El Salvador, the area of the Lencas. 

Finally, with reinforcements, the Spanish established the garrison town of [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], headed by [[Luis de Moscoso]], explorer and conquistador, in 1526. A Maya-Lenca woman, crown Princess Antu Silan Ulap I, daughter of Asisilcan Nachan I and Lady Omomatku, Monarch of the Lencas, organized resistance to the domination of the gold- and profit-hungry Conquistadors. The Lenca kingdom was alarmed by de Moscoso's invasion, and Antu Silan dealt with it by going from village to village, uniting all the Lenca towns in present day El Salvador and Honduras against the Spaniards. Through surprise attacks and their overwhelming numbers they were able to drive the Spanish out of San Miguel and destroy the garrison. 

For ten years, the Lencas prevented the Spanish from building a permanent settlement. Then the Spanish returned with more soldiers, including about 2,000 forced conscripts from indigenous communities in Mexico and Guatemala. They pursued the Lenca leaders further up into the mountains of IntibucÃ¡. Antu Silan Ulap continued leading the united forces until, late in pregnancy, she slipped out of the conflicted area to a safe haven, Tihuilotal, to give birth to twins, a girl and a boy. Their father was Prince Salaiki Kanul from Sesori. The daughter became Atonim Silan I &amp;ndash; she and her twin and another brother lived in the mountains near the lake Olomega and Maquigue &amp;ndash; in this way they escaped the Spanish and their allies who were hunting them. Tihuilotal is a little southwest of the present city of La UniÃ³n, near the source of the sacred Managuara River. 

Antu Silan Ulap eventually handed over control of the Lenca resistance to Lempira (also called Empira). Lempira was noteworthy among indigenous leaders in that he mocked the Spanish by wearing their clothes after capturing them and he used their weapons, captured in battle. Lempira fought in command of thousands of Lenca forces for six more years in El Salvador and Honduras until finally he was killed in battle and the remaining Lenca forces retreated into the hills. The Spanish were then able to rebuild their garrison town of San Miguel in 1537.

====Spanish rule/Colony and Independence====

In the early sixteenth century, the Spanish [[conquistador]]s ventured into ports to extend their dominion to the area.  They called the land &quot;{{lang|es|Provincia De Nuestro SeÃ±or Jesus Cristo, El Salvador Del Mundo}}&quot; (&quot;Province of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Savior of the World&quot;), which was subsequently abbreviated to &quot;{{lang|es|El Salvador}} (The Savior)&quot;.
[[File:Acto de Independencia 184 Liceo Salvador.jpg|thumb|right|Celebration of 184 years of independence in El Salvador, at the [[Liceo SalvadoreÃ±o]], a school in San Salvador]]
During the colonial period, El Salvador was part of the Captaincy General of Guatemala, created as an administrative division of the Spanish Empire also known as the Kingdom of Guatemala (Spanish: ''Reino de Guatemala''). The Salvadoran territory  was administered as the Mayor of Sonsonate, with San Salvador being established as an [[intendancy|intendancia]] in 1786.

Towards the end of 1811, a combination of internal and external factors motivated Central American elites to attempt to gain independence from the Spanish Crown. The most important internal factors were the desire of local elites to control the country's affairs free of involvement from Spanish authorities, and the Creoles' long-standing aspiration for independence. The main external factors motivating the independence movement were the success of the [[French Revolution|French]] and [[American Revolution|American]] revolutions in the eighteenth century, and the weakening of the Spanish Crown's military power as a result of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], with the resulting inability to control its colonies effectively.

On 5 November 1811, Salvadoran priest [[JosÃ© MatÃ­as Delgado]], rang the bells of Iglesia La Merced in San Salvador, calling for insurrection and launching the [[1811 Independence Movement]]. This insurrection was suppressed and many of its leaders were arrested and served sentences in jail. Another insurrection was launched in 1814, and again it was suppressed. Finally, on September 15, 1821, in light of unrest in Guatemala, Spanish authorities capitulated and signed the 'Acta de Independencia' (Deed of Independence) which released all of the Captaincy of Guatemala (comprising current territories of Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica and the Mexican state of [[Chiapas]]) from Spanish rule and declared its Independence.

In early 1822, the authorities of the newly independent Central American provinces, meeting in Guatemala City, voted to join the newly constituted [[First Mexican Empire]] under [[AgustÃ­n de Iturbide]]. El Salvador resisted, insisting on autonomy for the Central American countries. A Mexican military detachment marched to [[San Salvador]] and suppressed dissent, but with the fall of Iturbide on 19 March 1823, the army decamped back to Mexico. Shortly thereafter, the authorities of the provinces revoked the vote for joining Mexico, deciding instead to form a federal union of the five remaining provinces (Chiapas permanently joined Mexico at this juncture).

The enormous profits that [[coffee]] yielded as a monoculture export served as an impetus for the concentration of land in the hands of an [[oligarchy]] of just a few families.&lt;ref&gt;Politics in Central America, Thomas P. Anderson&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} A succession of [[president]]s from the ranks of the Salvadoran oligarchy, nominally both [[conservatism|conservative]] and [[liberalism|liberal]], throughout the last half of the nineteenth century generally agreed on the promotion of coffee as the predominant [[cash crop]], on the development of infrastructure ([[railroad]]s and [[sea port|port facilities]]) primarily in support of the coffee trade, on the elimination of communal landholdings to facilitate further coffee production, on the passage of anti-[[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] laws to ensure that displaced [[Peasant|campesinos]] and other rural residents provided sufficient [[labour (economics)|labor]] for the coffee fincas ([[plantation]]s), and on the suppression of rural discontent. In 1912, the national guard was created as a rural police force.

===20th century===
[[File:TomÃ¡s Regalado.jpg|thumb|left|General TomÃ¡s Regalado was President of El Salvador from 14 November 1898 until 1 March 1903. He was a military ruler. After he left office, he remained active in the Army of El Salvador, and was killed July 11, 1906 at El Jicaro during a war against Guatemala.]]
The economy was based on coffee growing after the mid-19th century and, as the world market for indigo withered away, prospered or suffered as the world coffee price fluctuated. El Salvador president [[TomÃ¡s Regalado (Salvadoran politician)|Tomas Regalado]] came to power by force in 1898 and his regime lasted until 1903. He reinitiated designating presidential successors. Up until 1913 El Salvador had been politically stable, but there was popular discontent as well, president Araujo was killed and there are many hypotheses for his murder.

Araujo was followed by the Melendez-Quinonez dynasty that lasted from 1913 to 1927. [[Pio Romero Bosque]], ex-Minister of the Government, succeeded president [[Jorge Melendez]] and in 1930 he announced free elections in which Ing. [[Arturo Araujo]] came to power on March 1, 1931. His government only lasted nine months. His Labor Party lacked political and government experience and many Labor party members used government offices inefficiently.

In that year, [[Farabundo MartÃ­]] came back from exile that was ordered by Romero Bosque, sending him to Washington, D.C. and spending time with U.S. President [[Herbert Hoover]]. He was visited by some local leftists. President Romero Bosque sent him away before the upcoming 1930 presidential elections for his communist activities. President Araujo faced popular discontent as people expected economic reforms and land. Demonstrations started since the first week of his government in front of the National Palace. His Minister of War was General [[Maximiliano HernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­nez]] and his National Police Director Rochac, the president's brother-in-law.

A coup d'Ã©tat was organized by junior officers and the first strike started in the First Regiment of Infantry across from the National Palace in downtown San Salvador and only the First Regiment of Calvary and the National Police was loyal to the president and defended him (the National Police had been paid its payroll), but later that night on December 1931, after hours of military fight and outnumbered surrendered to the military revolution.

The Directorate (composed of officers) hid behind a shadowy figure, whose name (as told by Thomas Anderson in his book ''Matanza'') was [[Rodolfo Duke]], a rich man and also General MartÃ­nez. The causes of the revolt were mainly supposed to be due to the discontent of the army for not being paid by President Araujo for some months. Araujo left the National Palace and later tried to organize to defeat the revolt, but was unable.

The U.S. Minister in El Salvador met with the Directorate and later recognized the government of Vice President MartÃ­nez who agreed to have later presidential elections (MartÃ­nez resigned in 1934 six months before the presidential elections to be able to run for the presidency and then as the only candidate won the election ruling from 1935 to 1939 and then 1939&amp;ndash;1943 and finally started his 4th term in 1944 but resigned in May after the General strike; MartÃ­nez said he was going to respect the Constitution which said he could not be reelected, but he did not).

From December 1931, the year of the coup in which MartÃ­nez came to power, there was brutal suppression of rural resistance. The most notable event was the February 1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising, led by [[Farabundo MartÃ­]] and with leaders like [[Abel Cuenca]], and other academic people like Alfonso Luna and Mario Zapata. Only Abel Cuenca survived, the other freedom fighters were killed by the government. It was later referred to as [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising|La Matanza]] (the massacre), because President Martinez massacred tens of thousands of peasants.

Historically, high Salvadoran population density has contributed to tensions with neighboring [[Honduras]], as land-poor Salvadorans emigrated to less densely populated Honduras and established themselves as squatters on unused or underused land. This phenomenon was a major cause of the [[Football War|1969 Football War]] between El Salvador and Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/22.htm El Salvador â Demographics]&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 130,000 Salvadorans had been forcibly expelled or had fled from Honduras.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/32.htm El Salvador â Migration]&quot;.

====The PDC and the PCN parties====
[[File:Trenapopa(sansalvador).JPG|right|thumb|FENADESAL train in Apopa.]]

In 1960, two political parties were born and are still active in the El Salvador politics; the Christian Democratic Party (PDC) and the National Conciliation Party (PCN). Both share ideals, but one represents the middle class and the latter the Army.

Opposition leader [[JosÃ© NapoleÃ³n Duarte]] from the [[Christian Democratic Party (El Salvador)|PDC]] was the mayor of San Salvador from 1964 to 1970, winning three elections during the Jose Adalberto Rivera regime (this president allowed free elections for mayors and the National Assembly). Duarte later ran for president but was defeated in the 1972 presidential elections with UNO (National Opposition Union). The official PCN was declared winner with ex-Minister of Interior Col. Arturo Armando Molina.  Duarte, at some officers' request, supported a revolt for the election fraud, but was captured, tortured and later exiled.  Duarte came back to the country in 1979 to enter politics after working in Venezuela projects as an engineer.

====The October 1979 coup d'Ã©tat====
In October 1979, a [[coup d'Ã©tat]] brought the [[Revolutionary Government Junta of El Salvador]] to power. It nationalized many private companies and took over much privately owned land. The purpose of this new junta was to stop the revolutionary movement already underway because of Duarte's stolen election. Nevertheless, the oligarchy opposed agrarian reform and a junta formed with young liberal elements from the Army such as General Majano and General Gutierrez{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} as well as progressives such as Ungo and Alvarez.

Owing to the pressure of the staunch oligarchy and the inability to control the Army in repressing its own people because they were fighting for their right to unionize, agrarian reform, better wages, health, freedom of expression, this Junta was dissolved. In the meantime the guerrilla movement was spreading in all sectors of the Salvadoran society. Middle and high school students were organized in MERS (Movimiento Estudiantil Revolucionario de Secundaria, Revolutionary Movement of Secondary Students); college students were involved with AGEUS (Asociacion de Estudiantes Universitarios Salvadorenos; Association of Salvadoran College Students); workers were organized in BPR (Bloque Popular Revolucionario, Popular Revolutionary Block).

The U.S. supported and financed the creation of a second Junta to change the political environment and stop the spread of a leftist insurrection. Napoleon Duarte was recalled from his exile in Venezuela to head this new Junta. However, a revolution was already underway and his new role as head of the Junta was seen as opportunistic by the general population. He was unable to influence the outcome of the insurrection movement and this resulted in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]] (1980â1992).

[[File:Perquin mural.jpg|thumb|right|Mural in [[Perquin]], former &quot;[[guerrilla]] capital&quot; and now a tourist destination.]]
On January 16, 1992 the government of El Salvador represented by president Alfredo Cristiani and the guerrillas represented by the commanders of the five guerrilla groups such as Shafick Handal, Joaquin Villalobos, Salvador SÃ¡nchez Ceren, Francisco Jovel and Eduardo Sancho signed the Peace Agreements ending a 12-years civil war in the Chapultepec Castle in Mexico. The international community was present, and there was wide admiration because after the signature of the president he stood up and shook hands with all the now ex-guerrilla commanders. The Peace Agreements included reduction of the Army, the dissolution of the National Police, Treasury Police, National Guard, and the Civilian Defense, a paramilitary group. The organization of a new Civil Police and the end of impunity with which the government would leave recommendation to a Commission of the Truth.

====End of the 20th century====
From 1989 until 2004, Salvadorans favored the [[Nationalist Republican Alliance]] (ARENA) party, voting in ARENA presidents in every election ([[Alfredo Cristiani]], [[Armando CalderÃ³n Sol]], [[Francisco Flores PÃ©rez]], [[Antonio Saca]]) until 2009, when [[Mauricio Funes]] was elected president from the [[Farabundo MartÃ­ National Liberation Front]] (FLMN) party.

Economic reforms since the early 1990s have brought major benefits in terms of improved social conditions, diversification of its export sector, and access to international financial markets at investment grade level, while crime remains a major problem for the investment climate. This all ended in 2001 and support for ARENA weakened. There is internal turmoil in the ARENA party while the FMLN party is growing and united.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/COUNTRIES/LACEXT/ELSALVADOREXTN/0,,menuPK:295253~pagePK:141132~piPK:141107~theSitePK:295244,00.html|title=El Salvador Country Brief|publisher=World Bank|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The unsuccessful attempts of the left-wing party to win presidential elections led to its selection of a journalist rather than a former guerrilla leader as a candidate. On March 15, 2009, [[Mauricio Funes]], a television figure, became the first president from the [[Farabundo MartÃ­ National Liberation Front|FMLN]] party. He was inaugurated on June 1, 2009. One focus of the Funes government has been revealing the alleged corruption from the past government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diariocolatino.com/es/20090612/nacionales/67865/|title=Funes saca a luz corrupciÃ³n en gobiernos de ARENA|publisher=Diario CoLatino|year=2009|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Geography of El Salvador}}
[[File:Meanguera del Golfo.JPG|left|thumb|Meanguera Island view from the [[Gulf of Fonseca]]]]
[[File:Izzyd.jpg|thumb|right|[[Izalco (volcano)|Izalco Volcano]]]]

El Salvador is located in Central America. It has a total area of {{convert|8,123|sqmi|km2}} (about the size of [[Massachusetts]] or [[Wales]]). It is the smallest country in continental America and is affectionately called ('''&quot;[[Pulgarcito]] de America&quot;'''), the &quot;[[Tom Thumb]] of the Americas&quot;. It has {{convert|123.6|sqmi|km2}} of water within its borders. It lies between latitudes [[13th parallel north|13Â°]] and [[15th parallel north|15Â°N]], and longitudes [[87th meridian west|87Â°]] and [[91st meridian west|91Â°W]].

Several small rivers flow through El Salvador into the Pacific Ocean, including the [[GoascorÃ¡n River|GoascorÃ¡n]], [[Jiboa River|Jiboa]], [[Torola River|Torola]], [[Paz River|Paz]] and the [[RÃ­o Grande de San Miguel]]. Only the largest river, the [[Lempa River]], flowing from [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]] across El Salvador to the ocean, is navigatable for commercial traffic.

Volcanic craters enclose lakes, the most important of which are [[Lake Ilopango]] (70&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²/27 sq mi) and [[Lake Coatepeque]] (26&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²/10 sq mi). [[Lake GÃ¼ija]] is El Salvador's largest natural lake (44&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²/17 sq mi). Several artificial lakes were created by the damming of the Lempa, the largest of which is [[CerrÃ³n Grande Hydroelectric Dam|Embalse CerrÃ³n Grande]] (135&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²).

El Salvador shares borders with Guatemala and Honduras. It is the only [[Central American]] country that does not have a Caribbean coastline. The highest point in the country is [[Cerro El Pital]] at 8,957 feet (2,730 m), which shares a border with [[Honduras]].

=== Climate ===
{{Main|Climate of El Salvador}}

El Salvador has a [[tropical climate]] with pronounced wet and dry seasons. Temperatures vary primarily with elevation and show little seasonal change. The Pacific lowlands are uniformly hot; the central plateau and mountain areas are more moderate. The rainy season extends from May to October, this time of year is referred to as ''invierno'' or winter. Almost all the annual rainfall occurs during this time, and yearly totals, particularly on southern-facing mountain slopes, can be as high as {{convert|2170|mm|in|1}}. The best time to visit El Salvador would be at the beginning or end of the dry season. Protected areas and the central plateau receive less, although still significant, amounts. Rainfall during this season generally comes from low pressure over the Pacific and usually falls in heavy afternoon thunderstorms. [[Hurricane]]s occasionally form in the Pacific with the notable exception of [[Hurricane Mitch]], which formed in the Atlantic and crossed Central America.

From November through April, the northeast [[trade winds]] control weather patterns; this time of year is referred to as ''verano'', or summer. During these months, air flowing from the Caribbean has lost most of the precipitation while passing over the mountains in [[Honduras]]. By the time this air reaches El Salvador, it is dry, hot, and hazy. However, in the extreme northeastern part of the country, near [[Cerro El Pital]] snow is know to fall during this time as well as during the winter of course due to a very high elevation (it is often referred to as the coldest place in the country). During El Salvador's summer temperatures are warm to hot but dry (excluding the northern higher mountain ranges, where temperatures are chilly).

===Biodiversity and endangered species===
[[File:Ocelot.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Ocelot]] is a native of El Salvador.]]
[[File:motmot1.jpg|thumb|right|Torogoz is El Salvador's national bird.]]

Globally there are eight species of sea turtles, six nests on the coast of Central America and four in the Salvadoran coast: the leatherback turtle (Dermochelys coriacea), hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata), green sea turtle (Chelonia agasizzii) and the olive ridley (Lepidochelys olivacea).

Of these four the most common is the olive ridley, followed by the brown (black). The other two species are much more difficult to find as they are critically endangered (hawksbill and leatherback), while the olive ridley and brown (black), are in danger of extinction.

Recent conservation efforts provide hope for the future of the country's biological diversity. In 1997 the government established the Ministry of the Environment and Natural Resources. A general environmental framework law was approved by the National Assembly in 1999. Specific legislation to protect wildlife is still pending.

In addition, a number of non-governmental organizations are doing important work to safeguard some of the country's most important forested areas. Foremost among these is SalvaNatura which manages El Impossible, the country's largest national park, under an agreement with El Salvador's environmental authorities.

Despite these efforts much remains to be done.

In El salvador it is estimated that there are 500 species of birds, 1,000 species of butterflies, 400 species of orchids, 800 species of trees, and 800 species of marine fish.

=== Natural disasters ===
El Salvador lies along the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]], and is thus subject to significant [[tectonic plate|tectonic]] activity, including frequent [[earthquake]]s and [[volcano|volcanic]] activity. Recent examples include the earthquake on January 13, 2001, that measured 7.7 on the [[Richter magnitude scale|Richter scale]] and caused a [[landslide]] that killed more than 800 people;&lt;ref name = &quot;tdfiyp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1109.html |title=El Salvador landslide |publisher=Travel.state.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another earthquake only a month after the first one, on February 13, 2001, that killed 255 people and damaged about 20% of the nation's housing. Luckily, many families were able to find safety from the landslides caused by the earthquake.

The San Salvador area has been hit by earthquakes in 1576, 1659, 1798, 1839, 1854, 1873, 1880, 1917, 1919, 1965, 1986, 2001 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lomnitz|first=Cinna|authorlink= |date=1 April 1966|title=The San Salvador earthquake of May 3, 1965 |journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|volume=56|issue=2|pages=561â575|id= |url=http://bssa.geoscienceworld.org/cgi/content/abstract/56/2/561|accessdate= |quote= |author2=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Moment magnitude scale|5.7 M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;]]-earthquake of 1986 resulted in 1,500 deaths, 10,000 injuries, and 100,000 people left homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harlow|first=David H. |authorlink= |year=1993|title=The San Salvador earthquake of 10 October 1986 and its historical context|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|volume=83|issue=4|pages=1143â1154|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Bommer|first=Julian|authorlink= |year=1987|title=The San Salvador earthquake of 10th October 1986|journal=Disasters|volume=11 |issue=2|pages=83â95|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7717.1987.tb00620.x|url= |accessdate= |quote= |last2=Ledbetter|first2=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Salvador's most recent destructive volcanic eruption took place on October 1, 2005, when the [[Santa Ana Volcano]] spewed up a cloud of ash, hot mud and rocks, which fell on nearby villages and caused two deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdfiyp&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laprensagrafica.com/especiales/2005/erupcion/316655.asp ErupciÃ³n en Santa Ana|La Prensa GrÃ¡fica]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most severe volcanic eruption in this area occurred in the 5th century AD when the [[Ilopango (volcano)|Ilopango]] volcano erupted with a [[Volcanic Explosivity Index|VEI]] strength of 6, producing widespread [[pyroclastic flow]]s and devastating [[Maya civilization|Mayan cities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dull|first=Robert A.|authorlink= |year=2001|title=Volcanism, Ecology and Culture: A Reassessment of the Volcan Ilopango Tbj eruption in the Southern Maya Realm|journal=Latin American Antiquity|volume=12 |issue=1|pages=25â44|doi=10.2307/971755|url= |accessdate= |quote= |author2=Southon|author3=Sheets}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Salvador's position on the Pacific Ocean also makes it subject to severe weather conditions, including heavy rainstorms and severe [[drought]]s, both of which may be made more extreme by the [[El NiÃ±o]] and [[La NiÃ±a]] effects. In the summer of 2001, a severe drought destroyed 80% of the country's crops, causing [[famine]] in the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/wideangle/shows/elsalvador/photo6.html|title=Photo Essay: El Salvador, the Makings of a Gangland|publisher=Pbs.org|date= 2006-07-11|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiu.edu/~oberbaue/el_salvador.pdf|title=Fiu.edu|format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 2005, severe rains resulted in dangerous flooding and [[landslide]]s, which caused a minimum of fifty deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;tdfiyp&quot;/&gt; El Salvador's location in Central America also makes it vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s coming off the Caribbean, however this risk is much less than for other Central American countries.

The [[Santa Ana Volcano]] in El Salvador is currently dormant, the last eruptions were in 1904 and 2005. [[Coatepeque Caldera|Lago de Coatepeque]] (one of El Salvador's lakes) was created by water filling the [[caldera]] formed after a massive eruption.

The British [[Imperial College London|Imperial College's]] [[El Salvador Project]] aims to build earthquake-proof buildings in remote areas of the country.

== Government and politics ==
[[Image:Alfredo Cristiani.jpg|200px|thumb|Former President Alfredo Cristiani-Burkard.]]
{{Main|Politics of El Salvador}}
{{Main|Foreign relations of El Salvador}}

The 1983 Constitution is the highest legal authority in the country. El Salvador is a democratic and representative, whose three bodies are: the Executive Branch, headed by the President of the Republic who is elected by direct vote and remains in office for five years. He can be elected for only one term. The president has a Cabinet of Minister, whom he appoints, and is also the General Commander of the Armed Forces.

The other entities are the Legislative Branch, called El Salvador's Legislative Assembly (unicameral) of 84 deputies, and the Judiciary, headed by the Supreme Court, which is composed of 15 judges, one of them being elected as President of judiciary.

The Chapultepec Peace Accords (1992) created the new National Civil Police, the Attorney for the Defense of Human Rights and the Supreme Electoral Tribunal. The Peace Accords re-imagined the Frente Farabundo Marti para la Liberacion Nacional (FMLN) as a political party and redefined the role of the army to be for the defense of the sovereignty and territorial integrity. The Accords also removed some security forces who were in command of the army, such as the National Guard, Treasury Police and special battalions that were formed to fight against the insurgency of the 1980s.

The political framework of El Salvador is a [[presidential system|presidential]] [[representative democracy|representative democratic]] [[republic]] with a multiform multi-party system. The [[President of El Salvador]], currently [[Mauricio Funes]], is both [[head of state]] and [[head of government]]. [[Executive power]] is exercised by the government. [[Legislative power]] is vested in both the [[government]] and the [[Legislative Assembly of El Salvador|Legislative Assembly]]. The country also has an independent [[Judiciary]] and Supreme Court.

=== Main Political Parties ===
Although El Salvador has 6 political parties, the  main ones, or the one which receive the most votes are the conservative right, ARENA, and the liberal left, FMLN.  The GANA, PDC, PCN, and CD have been retired.

[[Amnesty International]] asserts  that anti-terrorism laws are misused, allowing the government to detain and harass its political opponents. In addition, Amnesty International has drawn attention to several arrests of police officers for unlawful police killings. Other current issues to gain Amnesty International's attention in the past 10 years include missing children, failure of law enforcement to properly investigate and prosecute crimes against women, and rendering [[labor unions|organized labor]] illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/all-countries/el-salvador/page.do?id=1011148 El Salvador Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Departments ===
{{See also|Ranked list of Salvadoran departments|Salvadoran Departments by HDI}}

El Salvador is divided into 14 [[Departments of El Salvador|departments]] (''departamentos''), which in turn are subdivided into 262 [[Municipalities of El Salvador|municipalities]] (''municipios'').

== Economy ==
{{Main|Economy of El Salvador}}
[[File:Futura WTCSS.jpg|thumb|left|[[World Trade Center San Salvador]]]]
[[File:BDiegoRN-21.JPG|thumb|right|Salvadoran Highway (21) near completion.]]
There are several hydroelectric dams along the Lempa river. There is the Guayojo dam, the [[CerrÃ³n Grande Hydroelectric Dam]], the 5 de Noviembre dam, and the 15 de Septiembre dam which can be easily seen from the [[Pan-American highway]].
According to the [[IMF]] and [[CIA World Factbook]], El Salvador has the third largest economy in the region (behind Costa Rica and Panama) when comparing nominal Gross Domestic Product and purchasing power GDP.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of countries by GDP (nominal)]]&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador's GDP per capita stands at US $4,365.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rank Order - GDP - per capita (PPP) |publisher=U.S. Central Intelligence Agency World Factbook |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/rankorder/2004rank.html |accessdate=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

El Salvador's economy has been hampered at times by natural disasters such as earthquakes and hurricanes, but it is currently growing steadily. [[Antiguo CuscatlÃ¡n]] has the highest per capita income of all the cities in the country and is a center of international investment.

GDP in [[purchasing power parity]] (PPP) in 2008 was estimated at $ 25.895 billion USD. The service sector is the largest component of GDP at 64.1%, followed by the industrial sector at 24.7% (2008 est.). Agriculture represents only 11.2% of GDP (2010 est.).

[[File:San Salvador.jpg|thumb|right|San Salvador one of the fastest growing capitals in the world]]
The [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] has been growing since 1996 at an annual rate that averages 3.2% real growth. The government has recently committed to [[free market]] initiatives, and the 2007 GDP's real growth rate was 4.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Gross Domestic Product, annual rates, main economic sectors |publisher=[[Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador]] |url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/sr_produccion.html |accessdate=2007-11-17| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071107150307/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/sr_produccion.html| archivedate = November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1999, net international reserves equaled US $1.8 billion or roughly five months of imports. Having this hard currency buffer to work with, the Salvadoran government undertook a monetary integration plan beginning January 1, 2001 by which the U.S. dollar became legal tender alongside the [[Salvadoran colÃ³n]] and all formal accounting was done in U.S. dollars. Thus the government has formally limited the  implementing of open market monetary policies to influence short term variables in the economy. As of September 2007, net [[international reserve system|international reserves]] stood at $2.42 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saldos a fin de aÃ±o o mes|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|language=Spanish|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/estadisticas/Sector_externo/sectorexterno_reservasint_anual.html|accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014022202/http://bcr.gob.sv/estadisticas/Sector_externo/sectorexterno_reservasint_anual.html|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.state.gov/travel/cis_pa_tw/cis/cis_1109.html Country Specific Information, U.S. State Department], 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has long been a challenge in El Salvador to develop new growth sectors for a more diversified economy. In the past the country produced gold and silver.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Oancea: Mining in Central America http://magazine.mining.com/Issues/0901/MiningCentralAmerica.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; As with other former colonies, El Salvador was considered a mono-export economy (an economy that depended heavily on one type of export) for many years. During colonial times, the Spanish decided that El Salvador would produce and export [[Indigo dye|indigo]], but after the invention of synthetic dyes in the 19th century, the newly created modern state turned to [[coffee]] as the main export.

[[File:Fdpt18102006bmcha43c.jpg|thumb|left|[[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]] is an important economic center of El Salvador and home to &quot;Carnival of San Miguel&quot;, the biggest festival of entertainment and gastronomy in Central America.]]
There are a total of 15 [[free trade zone]]s in El Salvador. El Salvador signed the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) â negotiated by the five countries of Central America and the [[Dominican Republic]] â with the United States in 2004. CAFTA requires that the Salvadoran government adopt policies that foster [[free trade]]. El Salvador has signed free trade agreements with Mexico, [[Chile]], the Dominican Republic, and [[Panama]] and increased its [[trade]] with those countries. El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua also are negotiating a free trade agreement with Canada. In October 2007, these four countries and Costa Rica began free trade agreement negotiations with the European Union. Negotiations started in 2006 for a free trade agreement with [[Colombia]].

The government has focused on improving the collection of its current [[revenue]]s with a focus on indirect taxes. A 10% [[value-added tax]] (IVA in Spanish), implemented in September 1992, was raised to 13% in July 1995.

[[Inflation]] has been steady and among the lowest in the region. Since 1997 inflation has averaged 3%, with recent years increasing to nearly 5%. As a result of the free trade agreements from 2000 to 2006 total exports have grown 19% from $2.94 billion to $3.51 billion, and total imports have risen 54% from $4.95 billion to $7.63 billion. This has resulted in a 102% increase in the trade deficit from $2.01 billion to $4.12 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trade Balance, Annual and Monthly Accumulated|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071014112428/http://bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_balanzacom.html|archivedate=October 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Llano del Muerto in Perquin El Salvador.jpg|thumb|Llano del Muerto in [[Perquin]]; tourism is the fastest growing sector of the Salvadoran economy.]]
Remittances from Salvadorans living and working in the United States, sent to family in El Salvador, are a major source of foreign [[income]] and offset the substantial [[trade deficit]] of $4.12 billion. Remittances have increased steadily in the last decade and reached an all-time high of $3.32 billion in 2006 (an increase of 17% over the previous year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Family Remittances|publisher=Banco Central de Reserva de El Salvador|url=http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html |accessdate=2007-11-17|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071107112652/http://www.bcr.gob.sv/ingles/estadisticas/se_remesas.html|archivedate=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; approximately 16.2% of [[gross domestic product]](GDP).

Remittances have had positive and negative effects on El Salvador. In 2005 the number of people living in [[extreme poverty]] in El Salvador was 20%,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Objetivos de Desarrollo del Milenio|url=http://www.redsolidaria.gob.sv/content/view/677/46/1/1/|accessdate=2007-05-23|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; according to a United Nations Development Program report, without remittances the number of Salvadorans living in extreme poverty would rise to 37%. While Salvadoran education levels have gone up, wage expectations have risen faster than either skills or productivity. For example, some Salvadorans are no longer willing to take jobs that pay them less than what they receive monthly from family members abroad. This has led to an influx of Hondurans and Nicaraguans who are willing to work for the prevailing wage. Also, the local propensity for consumption over investment has increased. 

Money from [[remittance]]s has also increased prices for certain commodities such as real estate. Many Salvadorans abroad earning much higher wages can afford higher prices for houses in El Salvador than local Salvadorans and thus push up the prices that all Salvadorans must pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/13/AR2006051300879_pf.html|title=Washington Post|work=Washington Post|date=2006-05-13|accessdate=2010-05-02|first=N.C.|last= Aizenman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being the smallest country geographically in Central America, El Salvador has the third largest economy with a per capita income that is roughly two-thirds that of Costa Rica and Panama, but more than double that of Nicaragua. Growth has been modest in recent years and the economy contracted nearly 3% in 2009. Due to a growing and dollarized economy In recent years, El Salvador is seeing an increase of [[Central American]], [[South American]], and Caribbean immigrants from [[Guatemalans]], [[Hondurans]], [[Nicaraguans]], [[Dominicans]], [[Colombian people|Colombians]], [[Venezuelan people|Venezuelan]], [[Peruvians]] and [[Cubans]] searching for better living opportunities. 

El Salvador leads the region in remittances per capita with inflows equivalent to nearly all export income and about a third of all households receive these financial inflows. In 2006 El Salvador was the first country to ratify the Central America-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement. CAFTA has bolstered exports of processed foods, sugar, and ethanol, and supported investment in the apparel sector, which faced Asian competition with the expiration of the Multi-Fiber Agreement in 2005. In anticipation of the declines in the apparel sector's competitiveness, the previous administration sought to diversify the economy by promoting the country as a regional distribution and logistics hub, and by promoting tourism investment through tax incentives. 

El Salvador has promoted an open trade and investment environment, and has embarked on a wave of privatizations extending to telecom, electricity distribution, banking, and pension funds. In late 2006, the government and the Millennium Challenge Corporation signed a five-year, $461 million compact to stimulate economic growth and reduce poverty in the country's northern region, the primary conflict zone during the civil war, through investments in education, public services, enterprise development, and transportation infrastructure. With the adoption of the US dollar as its currency in 2001, El Salvador lost control over monetary policy. Any counter-cyclical policy response to the downturn must be through fiscal policy, which is constrained by legislative requirements for a two-thirds majority to approve any international financing.

The population of El Salvador increased from 1.9 million inhabitants in 1950 to 4.7 million in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://countrystudies.us/el-salvador/23.htm El Salvador â Population Growth and Age Distribution]&quot;. [[Library of Congress Country Studies]].&lt;/ref&gt; El Salvador has lacked authoritative demographic data for many years because no national census was taken between 1992 and 2007. Before the 2009 census, patterns in population growth led many officials (including within the Salvadoran government) to estimate the country's population at between 7.1 and 7.2 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2033.htm|title=Population figures|publisher=State.gov|date=2010-01-29|accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
However, on May 12, 2008, El Salvador's Ministry of Economy released statistics gathered in the census of the previous May. These data present a figure for the total population that corroborates the earlier estimates: 7,185,218.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Challenges to the 2009 census on a number of grounds are forthcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=PCN desconfÃ­a del censo poblacional|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/nacion/1075588.asp|accessdate=2008-07-28|publisher=La Prensa Grafica}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.laprensagrafica.com/nacion/1056295.asp|title=Censo y padron no coinciden}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pddh.gob.sv/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=148|author=PDDH de El Salvador|title=Censo de poblaciÃ³n y vivienda invisibiliza la existencia de los pueblos indÃ­genas de El Salvador}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country's population is composed of [[mestizo]]s (those of mixed indigenous [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] and [[Spanish people|European]] ancestry), [[whites]], and indigenous peoples. Eighty-six percent of Salvadorans are of mixed ancestry. In the mestizo population, Salvadorans of predominantly Mediterranean descent and indigenes who are not connected to indigenous customs or language all identify themselves as mestizo culturally. 
[[File:Anita Page Stars of the Photoplay.jpg|thumb|150 px|left| [[Anita Page]] was an American-Salvadoran actress]]

Twelve percent of Salvadorans are mostly of [[Spanish people|Spanish]] descent. Small communities of [[French people|French]], [[Germans|German]], [[Swiss people|Swiss]], [[English people|English]], [[Irish people|Irish]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Danish people|Danish]], [[Swedish people|Swedish]], [[Norwegians|Norwegian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]] and [[Central European]] ethnicity also exist within the country. The majority of [[Central European]] immigrants arrived during World War II as refugees from the [[Czech Republic]], [[Germany]], [[Hungary]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], and [[Switzerland]], and their descendants are scattered in different communities across El Salvador. [[Russians]] came in during the Salvadoran civil war, concurrent with the U.S./Soviet Union cold war, to help the communist guerrillas in their struggle to seize the government. [[United States|Americans]], [[Australians]], and [[Canadians]]  assisted the military junta in their fight against the communists. 

Only one percent of the Salvadoran population is pure indigenous, mostly [[Maya peoples|Mayan]], [[Pipil people|Pipil]], [[Lenca people|Lenca]] and Kakawira (Cacaopera). The presently low numbers of indigenous people may be partly explained by mass murders during the [[1932 Salvadoran peasant uprising]] (or ''La Matanza''), in which up to 30,000 [[peasants]] were killed in what by modern standards would be considered [[genocide]] because of the Salvadoran army's efforts to exterminate a certain racial group. Other ethnic groups include [[Arabs]], [[Jews]], other [[Central Americans]], [[South Americans]], [[Caribbeans]] and a small group of [[Asians]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

El Salvador is the only Central American country that has no visible or significant [[African]] population today because of its lack of an Atlantic coastline and attendant access to the slave trade which occurred along the east coast for centuries. This scarcity of [[Afro-Salvadoran]] population is also due to laws imposed by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[Criollo people|Criollo]]s around the 17th century after a slave revolt, and which was sustained by authorities even after independence was won from Spain in 1821 and slavery was abolished.

Until the end of the 20th century people of African descent weren't allowed to enter the country unless the oligarchy determined it was absolutely necessary. In addition, General [[Maximiliano HernÃ¡ndez MartÃ­nez]] instituted race laws in 1930 that prohibited four ethnic groupsâ[[black people|blacks]], [[Romani people|Gypsies]], [[Asians]], and [[Arab]]s, from entering the country and stipulated that certain peopleâ[[Lebanese people|Lebanese]], [[Syrian]], [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] and [[Turkish people|Turkish]], were not allowed to enter El Salvador unless they were of European ancestry{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}. It was not until the 1980s that this law was rescinded. Regardless of these racial laws, Afro-Salvadorans are present in some areas due to immigrants arriving from neighboring countries like [[Belize]], [[Honduras]], and [[Nicaragua]], who eventually mixed in with the local populations. [[Palestinian Christians]] are today one of the most notable immigrant groups in El Salvador, despite their relatively small numbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.laprensagrafica.com/dominical/318769.asp|author=Elena Salamanca|title=NO a &quot;los otros&quot;|date=October 23, 2005|publisher= La Prensa GrÃ¡fica|accessdate=2007-12-29|language=Spanish|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080102044414/http://www.laprensagrafica.com/dominical/318769.asp|archivedate=January 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Montgomery, Tommie Sue|title=Revolution in El Salvador: from civil strife to civil peace|publisher=Westview Press|location=Boulder, Colo|year= 1995|isbn=0-8133-0071-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the book &quot;Seeing Indians &amp;ndash; A Study of Race, Nation, and Power in El Salvador&quot;, by Viginia Q. Tilley, page 210: &quot;...no twentieth-century law or regulation ever prohibited the entry, settlement, or patriation of blacks, under the Martinez dictatorship or any other regime.&quot; There have been several publications presenting information about Africans in what is now El Salvador during the colonial period.

Among the immigrant groups in El Salvador, [[Palestinian Christians]] stand out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MarÃ­n-GuzmÃ¡n|first=Roberto|title=A Century of Palestinian Immigration into Central America: A study of their economic and cultural contributions|year=2000|publisher=[[Universidad de Costa Rica]]|location=San Jose, CR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though few in number, their descendants have attained great economic and political power in the country, as evidenced by the election of ex-president [[Antonio Saca]] â whose opponent in the 2004 election, [[Schafik Handal]], was likewise of Palestinian descent â and the flourishing commercial, industrial, and construction firms owned by this ethnic group.

The capital city of San Salvador has about 2.1 million people; an estimated 42% of El Salvador's population live in rural areas. [[Urbanization]] has expanded at a phenomenal rate in El Salvador since the 1960s, driving millions to the cities and creating growth problems for cities around the country.

In the first half of 2007, government statistics provided by La PolicÃ­a Nacional Civil of El Salvador showed lower numbers in [[homicide]] and [[extortion]]s as well as [[robbery]] and [[theft]] of vehicles. In 2007 homicides in El Salvador were reduced by 22%, extortions were reduced by 7%, and robbery and theft of vehicles had gone down 18%, in comparison with the same period in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;elsalvador.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first= |last= |coauthors= |title=Disminuye delincuencia segÃºn la PNC|date= |publisher= |url= http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_completa.asp?idCat=2913&amp;idArt=1562092|work= |pages= |accessdate=2007-11-06|language= Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in 2009, there has been an increase in homicides and extortions of about 30% more than in 2008, according to some statistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/pdf/20090731/EDH20090731NAC002P.pdf|title=Elsalvador.com |format=PDF|date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2004, there were approximately 3.2 million Salvadorans living outside El Salvador, with the United States traditionally being the destination of choice for Salvadorans looking for greater economic opportunity. By 2009, there were about 1.6 million Salvadoran immigrants and Americans of Salvadoran descent in the U.S.,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/09/23/AR2009092304494.html Salvadorans Seek a Voice To Match Their Numbers]&quot;.

The majority of expatriates emigrated during the civil war of the 1980s for political reasons and later because of adverse economic and social conditions. Other countries with notable Salvadoran communities include Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom (including the [[Cayman Islands]]), Sweden, Brazil, Italy, Colombia, and Australia. There is also a large community of [[Nicaraguan]]s, 100,000 according to some figures, in theÂ UnitedÂ StatesÂ andÂ CostaÂ Rica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thedialogue.org/PublicationFiles/The%20Nicaragua%20case_M%20Orozco2%20REV.pdf|title=The Nicaragua case_M Orozco2 REV.doc|format=PDF|date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of them seasonal immigrants.

===Language===
[[Central American Spanish]] is the official language and is spoken by virtually all inhabitants. Some indigenous people still speak their native tongues (such as [[Nahuatl]] and [[Mayan languages|Maya]]), but indigenous Salvadoreans who do not identify as mestizo constitute only 1% of the country's population. However all of them can speak Spanish. [[Q'eqchi' language|Q'eqchi']] is spoken by immigrants of [[Guatemala]]n and [[Belize]]an indigenous people living in El Salvador. There have also been recent large migrations of [[Hondurans]] and [[Nicaraguans]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=kek Ethnologue report for language code:kek]&lt;/ref&gt; 

German, Dutch and French are taught as a secondary language only in private international schools, such as the Liceo Frances (France), Escuela Alemana (Germany), Academia Britanica Cuscatleca (United Kingdom) and the Escuela Americana (United States). English has been taught by Americans and the British in El Salvador for several decades, at least 50 years. However most formal education is given in private schools, which sometime may make it hard to access for most of the population, who have to attend public schools and receive a very elementary level of English. There has been an American school in the country for a few decades.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is also spoken. There has been a small Japanese community in El Salvador since World War II.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}, as well as a considerable Taiwanese community.

The local Spanish [[vernacular]] is called [[Caliche slang|''Caliche'']]. Salvadoreans use [[voseo]], which is also used in [[Uruguay]] and [[Argentina]]. This refers to the use of &quot;vos&quot; as the second person pronoun, instead of &quot;tÃº&quot;.However &quot;caliche&quot; is considered informal and some people choose not to use it. [[Nahuatl]] is an indigenous language that has survived, though it is only used by small communities of some elderly Salvadorans in western El Salvador.

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in El Salvador}}

There is diversity of religious and ethnic groups in El Salvador. The majority of the population are Christians, mostly Roman Catholics (52.5%), while [[Protestantism]] represents 27.6% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2008/108525.htm International Religious Freedom Report 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Mormonism]] and [[Pentecostalism]] are two of the notable Non&amp;ndash;[[Catholic Church|Catholic]] faiths in El Salvador. According to a survey in 2008, 52.6% of El Salvador's residents are Catholic and 27.9% are Protestant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2009/127390.htm|title=International Religious Freedom Report 2009|publisher=State.gov|date=2009-10-26|accessdate= 2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pentecostals and Latter-Day Saints (Mormons). The Latter-day Saint (Mormon church) temple was dedicated earlier this year in San Salvador. Other religions (1.4%) are present as well - Islam, Judaism and Jehovah's Witnesses.

=== Crime ===
{{main|Crime in El Salvador}}
In the past years El Salvador has experienced high crime rates including gang-related crimes and [[juvenile delinquency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Peetz|first=Peter|authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2008|month= June|title=Youth, Crime, and the Responses of the State: Discourses on Violence in Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Nicaragua |journal=GIGA Working Papers|volume=80|issue= |pages= |id= |url=http://vg02.met.vgwort.de/cf8b767595d54e20906c4dc67d12df?l=http://www.giga-hamburg.de/dl/download.php?d=/content/publikationen/pdf/wp80_peetz.pdf|accessdate= |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that this was a result of the deportation of thousands of Salvadorans from the U.S, the majority of whom were members of [[MS-13]] (Mara Salvatrucha, Mississippi, or La Mara),&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mara_Salvatrucha&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-90s. The gangs in which Salvadorans had been involved in the United States began to show up in El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9342427/El-Salvador&lt;/ref&gt;

Today El Salvador experiences some of the highest murder rates in the Latin America; it is also considered an epicenter of the gang crisis, along with [[Guatemala]] and [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Clare|last=Ribando|coauthors= |title= Gangs in Central America|date=2005-05-10|publisher=The Library of Congress|url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RS22141.pdf|work= Congressional Research Service|pages= |accessdate=2007-06-30|language= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this, the government has set up countless programs to try to guide the youth away from gang membership; so far its efforts have not produced any quick results. One of the government programs was a gang-reform called &quot;Super Mano Dura&quot; (Super Firm Hand). Super Mano Dura had little success and was highly criticized by the [[United Nations|UN]]. It saw temporary success in 2004 but then saw a rise in crime after 2005. In 2004, the rate of intentional homicides per 100,000 citizens was 41, with 60% of the homicides committed were [[gang]]-related.&lt;ref name=&quot;FAS&quot;/&gt; 

The Salvadoran government reported that the Super Mano Dura gang legislation led to a 14% drop in murders in 2004. However, El Salvador currently has 65 homocides per 100,000 inhabitants, more than triple the current rate of Mexico.&lt;ref name=NYRB&gt;&quot;In the New Gangland of El Salvador,&quot; ''New York Review of Books'', 10 November 2011, p.46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ryann|last=Bresnahan|coauthors= |title=El Salvador Dispatches Additional Contingent to Iraq:Domestic Issues Overrule Anxiety over War|date=2006-07-21|publisher= |url=http://www.coha.org/2006/08/21/el-salvador-dispatches-additional-contingent-to-iraq/|work =Council on Hemispheric Affairs (COHA)|pages= |accessdate= 2007-06-30|language= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are an estimated 25,000 gangmembers at large in El Salvador with another 9,000 in prison.&lt;ref name=NYRB/&gt; The well most known gangs, called &quot;[[maras (gangs)|maras]]&quot; in colloquial Spanish, are [[Mara Salvatrucha]] and their rivals [[18th Street gang|Calle 18]]; maras are, or at least were, hunted by [[death squad]]s including [[Sombra Negra]].

== Culture ==
{{Main|Culture of El Salvador}}
[[File:Fiestas patrias.JPG|thumb|right|Celebration of la fiestas patrias in Las Chinamas]]

[[Mestizo]] culture dominates the country heavy in Native American Indigenous and European Spanish influences. A new mix of population began as a result of the European settlers intermixing at great extent with the native [[Mesoamericans]] population of [[Cuzcatlan]]. The [[Catholic Church]] plays an important role in the Salvadoran culture. [[Archbishop Ãscar Romero]] is a national hero for his role in resisting human rights violations that were occurring in the lead-up to the Salvadoran Civil War.&lt;ref name=Eaton&gt;Eaton, Helen-May (1991). ''[http://scholars.wlu.ca/etd/116/ The impact of the Archbishop Ãscar Romero's alliance with the struggle for liberation of the Salvadoran people: A discussion of church-state relations (El Salvador)]'' (M.A. thesis) Wilfrid Laurier University&lt;/ref&gt; Significant foreign personalities in El Salvador were the [[Jesuit]] priests and professors [[Ignacio Ellacuria]], [[Ignacio MartÃ­n-BarÃ³]], and [[Segundo Montes]], who were murdered in 1989 by the Salvadoran Army during the height of the civil war.

Painting, ceramics and textile goods are the main manual [[artistic]] expressions. Writers [[Francisco Gavidia]] (1863â1955), [[SalarruÃ©]] (Salvador Salazar ArruÃ©) (1899â1975), [[Claudia Lars]], [[Alfredo Espino]], [[Pedro Geoffroy Rivas]], [[Manlio Argueta]], [[JosÃ© Roberto Cea]], and poet [[Roque Dalton]] are among the most important writers to stem from El Salvador. Notable 20th century personages include the late filmmaker [[Baltasar Polio]], female film director [[Patricia Chica]], artist [[Fernando Llort]], and [[caricaturist]] [[ToÃ±o Salazar]].

Amongst the more renowned representatives of the graphic arts are the painters [[Augusto Crespin]], [[Noe Canjura]], [[Carlos CaÃ±as]], [[Julia DÃ­az]], [[Mauricio Mejia]], [[Maria Elena Palomo de Mejia]], [[Camilo Minero]], [[Ricardo Carbonell]], [[Roberto Huezo]], [[Miguel Angel Cerna]], (the painter and writer better known as MACLo), [[Esael Araujo]], and many others.

The only airport serving international flights in the country is [[Comalapa International Airport]]. This airport is located about {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} southeast of San Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aeropuertoelsalvador.gob.sv/|title=CEPA - Aeropuerto Internacional de El Salvador|publisher=Aeropuertoelsalvador.gob.sv|date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airport is commonly known as Comalapa International or El Salvador International.

El Salvador's tourism industry has grown dynamically over recent years as the Salvadoran government focuses on developing this sector. Last year tourism accounted for 4.6% of GDP; only 10 years ago, it accounted for 0.4%. In this same year tourism grew 4.5% worldwide. Comparatively, El Salvador saw an increase of 8.97%, from 1.15 million to 1.27 million tourists. This has led to revenue from tourism growing 35.9% from $634 million to $862 million. As a reference point, in 1996 tourism revenue was $44.2 million. Also, there has been an even greater increase in the number of excursionists (visits that do not include an overnight stay). 222,000 excursionists visited El Salvador in 2006, a 24% increase over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsalvadorturismo.gob.sv/boletin2006.pdf/ Elsalvadorturismo.gob.sv] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most North American and European tourists are seeking out El Salvador's beaches and nightlife. Besides these two choices, El Salvador's tourism landscape is slightly different than those of other Central American countries. Because of its geographical size and urbanization, there are not many nature-themed tourist destinations such as ecotours or archaeological monuments. [[Surfing]], however, is a natural tourist sector that has gained popularity in recent years as Salvadoran beaches have become increasingly popular. Surfers visit many beaches on the coast of La Libertad and the east side of the country, finding surfing spots that are not yet overcrowded. Also, the use of the [[United States dollar]] as Salvadoran currency and direct flights of 4â6 hours from most cities in the United States are important things to note for first-time travelers from the United States. Urbanization and [[Americanization]] of Salvadoran culture has also led to something else that first time tourists might be surprised to see: the abundance of American-style malls, stores, and restaurants in the three main urban areas, especially greater San Salvador.

Currently, tourists to El Salvador can be classified into four groups: Central Americans; North Americans; Salvadorans living abroad, primarily in the United States; and Europeans and South Americans. The first three represent the vast majority of tourists. Recently, El Salvador has attempted to broaden its tourist base and increase the number of visitors from Europe and South America. Early indicators show that the government's efforts are working. When comparing JanuaryâMarch 2007 to the same period in 2006 (most recent data available), overall tourism has grown 10%, while from North America 38%, Europe 31%, and South America 36%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elsalvadorturismo.gob.sv/MARZO2007.pdf/ Elsalvadorturismo.gob.sv] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall, Livingston Airlines will initiate the only direct flight between Europe (departing from [[Milan]]) and El Salvador. The Decameron Salinitas, a recently inaugurated resort, has contributed to the growth of tourism from South American visitors (because of name recognition of the resort chain) and is looking to do the same with Europeans.

A whole new segment of tourism has grown up around El Salvador's recent turbulent past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.app.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070121/LIFE02/701210335 App.com]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artillery fragments, battle photographs, combat plans, and mountain hideouts have become tourist attractions in themselves. Since 1992, residents in some economically depressed areas have set up local enterprises to profit from these. The mountain town of [[Perquin]] was considered the &quot;guerrilla capital&quot;, and today it is home to the &quot;Museum of the Revolution&quot;, featuring cannons, uniforms, pieces of [[Soviet armed forces|Soviet]] weaponry, and other weapons of war once used by the [[FMLN]]'s (Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front) headquarters.

According to the El Salvadoran newspaper [[El Diario De Hoy]], the top 10 attractions are: the coastal beaches, [[La Libertad, La Libertad|La Libertad]], [[Ruta Las Flores]], [[Suchitoto]], [[Playa Las Flores]] in [[San Miguel, El Salvador|San Miguel]], [[La Palma (El Salvador)|La Palma]], [[Santa Ana Volcano|Santa Ana]] (location of the country's highest volcano), [[Nahuizalco]], [[Apaneca]], [[Juayua]], and [[San Ignacio, Chalatenango|San Ignacio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/mwedh/nota/nota_varias_fotos.asp?idCat=2907&amp;idArt=1482342 |title=elsalvador.com |publisher=elsalvador.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the numerous volcanic crater lakes in the mountains, [[Lake Coatepeque]] and [[Lake Ilopango]] are two of the most beautiful.

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|Salvadoran cuisine}}
[[File:Plain pupusas revueltas.jpg|right|thumb|'Pupusas, the national and most famous dish of El Salvador.]]
One of El Salvador's notable dishes is the [[pupusa]]. Pupusas are hand-made corn tortilla (made of [[masa|masa de maÃ­z]] or masa de arroz, a maize or rice flour dough used in [[Latin American cuisine]]) stuffed with one or more of the following: cheese (usually a soft Salvadoran cheese such as [[quesillo]], similar to mozarella), [[chicharrÃ³n]], or [[refried beans]]. Sometimes the filling is queso con loroco  (cheese combined with [[loroco]], a vine flower bud native to Central America). Pupusas revueltas are pupusas filled with beans, cheese and pork. There are also vegetarian options. Some adventurous restaurants even offer pupusas stuffed with shrimp or spinach. The name &quot;pupusa&quot; comes from the pipil-nahuatl word, ''pupushahua''. The pupusa's exact origins are debated, although its presence in El Salvador is known to predate the arrival of the Spaniards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elsalvador.com/noticias/2003/10/31/nacional/nacio7.html|title=Elsalvador.com|publisher=Elsalvador.com|date= |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two other typical Salvadoran dishes are yuca frita and panes rellenos. Yuca frita, which is deep fried [[cassava]] root served with [[curtido]] (a pickled cabbage, onion and carrot topping) and pork rinds with pescaditas (fried baby sardines). The Yuca is sometimes served boiled instead of fried. Panes con Pavo (literally breads with turkey) are warm [[Turkey (bird)|turkey]]-filled submarine sandwiches. The turkey is marinated and then roasted with [[Pipil people|Pipil]] spices and handpulled. This sandwich is traditionally served with [[chicken]], [[tomato]], and [[watercress]] along with [[cucumber]], [[onion]], [[lettuce]], [[mayonnaise]], and [[mustard (condiment)|mustard]].

One of El Salvador's typical breakfasts is fried plantain, usually served with cream. It is  common in Salvadoran restaurants and homes, including those of immigrants to the United States.

&quot;Maria Luisa&quot; is a dessert commonly found in El Salvador. It is a layered cake that is soaked in orange marmalade and sprinkled with powdered sugar.

A popular drink that Salvadorans enjoy is [[Horchata]], a drink native to the [[Valencian Community]] in Spain. Horchata is most commonly made of the [[morro seed]] ground into a powder and added to milk or water, and sugar. Horchata is drunk year round and can be drunk anytime of day. It mostly is accompanied by a plate of pupusas or fried yucca. Horchata from El Salvador has a very distinct taste and is not to be confused with Mexican horchata, which is rice based. Coffee is also a common morning beverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.everyculture.com/Cr-Ga/El-Salvador.html|title=Culture of El Salvador - traditional, history, people, clothing, women, beliefs, food, customs, family}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular drinks in El Salvador include &quot;Ensaladas&quot;  a drink made of chopped fruit swimming in fruit juice and  Kolachampan, a sugar cane-flavored carbonated beverage.

One of the most popular desserts is the cake Pastel de tres leches (Cake of three milks),  consisting of three types of milk; evaporated milk, condensed milk, and [[cream]].

== Education ==
[[File:UNIVERSIDAD FRANCISCO GAVIDIA.jpg|thumb|250px|Commons at the Universidad Francisco Gavidia campus.]]
{{Main|Education in El Salvador}}
The public education system in El Salvador is severely lacking in resources. Class sizes in public schools can reach 50 children, so Salvadorans who can afford the cost often choose to send their children to private schools, that are reasonably higher in every level. Most private schools follow foreign study systems: American, European or other advanced systems. Lower-income families are forced to rely on the public education system.

Education in El Salvador is free through high school. After nine years of basic education (elementary - middle school) students have the option of a two year high school or a three year high school. A two year high school prepares the student to transfer to a university. A three year high school allows the student graduate with a vocational career and enter the workforce or transfer to a university as well to further their education in that field.

The Post-Secondary education varies widely in price

There is one public university:
* [[Universidad de El Salvador]], UES
The University of El Salvador has one main campus in San Salvador and three more campuses in Santa Ana, San Miguel and San Vicente.

El Salvador has several private universities:
* [[Universidad Dr. JosÃ© MatÃ­as Delgado]], UJMD

* [[Universidad Francisco Gavidia]], UFG&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ufg.edu.sv/ UFG.edu.sv] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Universidad Tecnologica]], UTec
* [[Universidad Don Bosco]], UDB&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.udb.edu.sv/ UDB.edu.sv] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Universidad Evangelica]]

Local Foundations and NGOs are fostering further education development.

==Sport==

The [[El Salvador national football team]] qualified for the [[FIFA World Cup]] in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[1982 FIFA World Cup|1981]]. Their qualification for the 1970 tournament was marred by the [[Football War]], a war against [[Honduras]] who the team had defeated.
