A '''spin model''' is a [[mathematical model]] used in physics primarily to explain [[magnetism]]. Spin models may either be [[classical spin models|classical]] or [[quantum spin model|quantum]] mechanical in nature. Spin models have been studied in quantum field theory as examples of [[integrable model]]s. Spin models are also used in [[quantum information theory]] and [[computability theory]] in [[theoretical computer science]]. The theory of spin models is far reaching and unifying topic that cuts across many fields.

==Introduction==
In ordinary [[material]]s, the magnetic dipole moments of individual atoms produce magnetic fields that cancel one another, because each dipole points in a random direction. [[Ferromagnet]]ic materials below their [[Curie temperature]], however, exhibit [[magnetic domain]]s in which the atomic dipole moments are locally aligned, producing a macroscopic, non-zero magnetic field from the domain. These are the ordinary &quot;magnets&quot; with which we are all familiar.

The study of the behavior of such &quot;spin models&quot; is a thriving area of research in [[condensed matter physics]]. For instance, the [[Ising model]] describes spins (dipoles) that have only two possible states, up and down, whereas in the [[Heisenberg model]] the spin vector is allowed to point in any direction. These models have many interesting properties, which have led to interesting results in the theory of [[phase transition]]s.
