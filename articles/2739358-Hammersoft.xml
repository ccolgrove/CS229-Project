'''Federal prison'''s are run by national governments in countries where subdivisions of the country also operate prisons.

In the [[United States]] federal prisons are operated by the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]]. In Canada the [[Correctional Service of Canada]] operates federal prisons. Prison sentences in these federal prisons may be handed down to convicts who have violated a federal law.
