'''Dell IdeaStorm''' is a [[website]] launched by [[Dell]] on February 16, 2007 to allow Dell &quot;to gauge which ideas are most important and most relevant to&quot; the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dellideastorm.com/about About Dell IdeaStorm]&lt;/ref&gt;

After registering, users are able to ''add'' articles, ''promote'' them, ''demote them'' and ''comment'' on them. Articles can also be demoted, and a &quot;vote half life&quot; system&lt;ref name=&quot;Message From The Site Manager&quot;&gt;[http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/ideastorm/moderator?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=gen Message From The Site Manager&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is used to stop older ideas which are no longer receiving votes from appearing on the popular ideas page. Dell also modifies the half life vote to prop up ideas which they feel need more exposure, as they did for the poll asking which topics Michael Dell would be more important to cover at the 2007 LinuxWorld conference. As articles are promoted, their score is increased, allowing Dell to rank which suggestions and requests are considered most important by the website's users. A page is maintained to demonstrate how Dell is acting upon the suggestions, the page is only changed when the status of an idea changes to IMPLEMENTED, no information is provided as to which ideas are being acted on till then. The idea process involves much discussion which at time leads to more ideas, yet Dell continues to remove comments (besides comments which are in bad taste) which leads to confusion as the thought process of the comments is left disjointed and nonsensical at times. Voting has come under scrutiny with some members voting with more than one account, which generated the termed &quot;double dippers&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/69986 IdeaStorm delete accounts without a unique email or traceroute]&lt;/ref&gt; Dell has added some measures to help discourage this but is still working on preventing it.

Originally, the most popular suggestions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dellideastorm.com/popular Popular Ideas - Dell IdeaStorm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; concerned the inclusion of [[free software]] and [[operating system]]s in a Dell [[computer system]]. These suggestions were numerous, but were subsequently merged into a single &quot;article&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Message From The Site Manager&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideastorm.com/article/show/61771 Pre-Installed Linux | Ubuntu | Fedora | OpenSUSE | Multi-Boot - Dell IdeaStorm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to popular demand, Dell quickly moved to survey customers on their preferred [[Linux distribution]]s. On May 24, 2007, Dell started selling three computer systems with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] 7.04 preinstalled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://direct2dell.com/one2one/archive/2007/05/24/15994.aspx Dell Offers Three Consumer Systems With Ubuntu 7.04 - Direct2Dell&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The article requesting Linux systems eventually moved down the list to be replaced by newer ideas, such as a request to sell the Ubuntu systems internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dellideastorm.com/article/show/66672 Sell Linux PCs Worldwide - not only the United States - Dell IdeaStorm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other popular suggestions include requests for Dell's [[technical support]] [[telephone line]]s to be based in the [[USA]] (and other countries in which Dell computers are sold) and operated by people who speak and understand [[English language|English]] [[fluency|well]], as opposed to being based outside the USA or operated by [[India|foreigner]]s who do not speak and understand English well; and that Dell's website be improved. Various improvements and changes in the style, design, and [[computer hardware|hardware]] of Dell's products have also been requested. Current popular suggestions also concern such issues as preinstalled software being optional&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dellideastorm.com/article/show/62715 Preinstalled Software Must Be Optional - Dell IdeaStorm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and reinstallation CDs being provided at no extra cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dellideastorm.com/article/show/66635 Always include all software and driver reinstallation discs for free (or at least let us get the option to)... don't make us pay extra - Dell IdeaStorm&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dell Ideastorm's Terms of Services, a posted idea will grant Dell royalty free license to use and implement it without compensation to the originator. Participants should be aware of this before posting any ideas.
