'''Feather Linux''', created by Robert Sullivan, is a [[Knoppix]]-based [[operating system]] which fits in under 128 MB&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/13292/53/1/1/|title=Secure web browsing through Live Linux distros|publisher=iTWire|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; (while older versions were made to fit within 64 MB). It boots from either a CD or a [[USB flash drive]], into a [[Fluxbox]] [[desktop environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook|title=Linux Bible 2005 Edition: Boot Up to Ubuntu, Fedora, KNOPPIX, Debian, OpenSUSE, and 11 Other Distributions|first1=Chris |last1=Negus|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|year= 2005|isbn=0764579495|pages=456|url=http://books.google.com/?id=HqUzmfa8pWcC&amp;pg=PA456&amp;dq=%22Feather+Linux%22#PPA456,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a wide range of desktop and rescue software, and can load entirely into [[Random access memory|RAM]] (if enough RAM is available) or be installed to a hard drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|url=http://featherlinux.berlios.de/about.htm|title=Feather Linux - About|publisher= Feather Linux|date=15 May 2008|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feather Linux contains [[GTK+]] applications, such as [[AbiWord]] and [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]]. Feather Linux has tried to include software that people would frequently be using on their desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/55586|title=Linux.com :Feather Linux: Light is right|publisher=www.linux.com|accessdate=2009-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its most recent release being on 2005-07-04, Feather Linux is now dormant. Feather Linux and [[Damn Small Linux]] share some common goals.
