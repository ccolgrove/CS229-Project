The '''Amiga''' is a family of [[personal computer]]s that was sold by [[Commodore International|Commodore]] in the 1980s and 1990s. The first model was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its graphical, audio and multi-tasking abilities. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from 8-bit computers, such as the [[Commodore 64]], and the platform quickly grew in popularity among computer enthusiasts. The best selling model, the [[Amiga 500]], was introduced in 1987 and became the leading home computer of the late 1980s and early 1990s in much of Western Europe. In [[North America]] success was more modest. The Amiga went on to sell approximately six million units.&lt;ref name=&quot;reimer&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/total-share.ars | title=Total share: 30 years of personal computer market share figures | author=Jeremy Reimer | work=Ars Technica | accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second generation Amiga systems ([[Amiga 1200|A1200]] and [[Amiga 4000|A4000]]) were released in 1992. However, poor marketing and failure to repeat the technological advances of the first systems meant that the Amiga quickly lost its market share to competing platforms, such as the [[fourth generation game console]]s, [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM PC compatible]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;reimer&quot;/&gt;

Based on the [[Motorola 68000 family|Motorola 68000 series]] of [[microprocessor]]s, the machine sports a [[original Amiga chipset|custom chipset]] with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a [[pre-emptive multitasking]] operating system called [[AmigaOS]].

Although early Commodore advertisements attempted to cast the computer as an all-purpose business machine, the Amiga was most commercially successful as a home computer, with a wide range of [[video game|games]] and creative software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=PsJ0ZZMuEQs YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - ''Celebrities''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube.com/watch?v=ludrX2s1ZuM YouTube.com], Commodore advert 1987 - TV spot version of 20-minute presentation&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a less expensive alternative to the [[Apple Macintosh]] and [[IBM-PC]] as a general-purpose business or home computer. The platform became particularly popular for gaming and [[demoscene]] activities. It also found a prominent role in the [[desktop video]], [[video production]], and [[show control]] business, leading to affordable video editing systems such as the [[Video Toaster]]. The Amiga's native ability to simultaneously play back multiple digital sound samples made it a popular platform for early &quot;[[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]&quot; music software. The relatively powerful processor and ability to access several megabytes of memory led to the development of several 3D rendering packages, including [[LightWave 3D]] and [[Aladdin 4D]]. 

Since the demise of Commodore, various groups have marketed successors to the original Amiga line. [[Eyetech]] sold PowerPC based hardware under the [[AmigaOne]] brand from 2002 to 2005, and Acube sells the AmigaOS 3 compatible [[Minimig]] systems with a MC68000 compatible CPU and AmigaOS 4 compatible [[Sam440]] and [[Sam460]] systems with PowerPC processors.

The name ''Amiga'' was chosen by the developers specifically from the Spanish word for a female friend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/ahistory.html | title=The Twists and Turns of the Amiga Saga | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NB yes there are several other languages that use the same word, but the Amiga developers only knew Spanish and so that's the derivation. Please don't add a list of other languages here --&gt; and because it occurred before [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Atari]] alphabetically. It also gave the message that the Amiga computer line was 'user friendly' as a pun or play on words.&lt;ref&gt;DeMaria and Wilson (2003) ''High Score!: The Illustrated History of Electronic Games'' p. 109 ISBN 0-07-223172-6&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of the Amiga}}

{{Rquote|right|&quot;The Amiga was so far ahead of its time that almost nobody--including Commodore's marketing department--could fully articulate what it was all about. Today, it's obvious the Amiga was the first multimedia computer, but in those days it was derided as a game machine because few people grasped the importance of advanced graphics, sound, and video. Nine years later, vendors are still struggling to make systems that work like 1985 Amigas.&lt;br /&gt;--''[[Byte Magazine]],'' August 1994}}

[[Image:Recent Amiga.svg|thumb|right|265px|Amiga Technologies Logo. (1996)]]

Development of the Amiga began in 1982 with [[Jay Miner]] as the principal hardware designer of [[Amiga Corporation]]. It was initially intended to be a next generation [[video game]] machine, but was redesigned as a general purpose computer after the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.amigau.com/aig/prototypes/lorraine.html | title=Amiga Lorraine | work=Amiga History Guide | author=Gareth Knight | accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigaforever.com/games/ AmigaForever.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Amiga Forever - Amiga Games&lt;/ref&gt; A prototype of the full computer was shown to the public for the first time at the Summer [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=yC4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;ots=CtmypWJGu2&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Amiga Demos Its New Machine}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to bring the design to market [[Commodore International]] bought Amiga Corporation and funded development. The first model was released in 1985 as simply &quot;The Amiga from Commodore&quot;, later to be retroactively dubbed the [[Amiga 1000]]. The following year the Amiga product line was expanded with the introduction of two new models; the [[Amiga 2000]] for high-end graphics and business use, and the [[Amiga 500]] for home use. Commodore later released other Amiga models, both for low-end gaming use and high-end productivity use.

In 1994, Commodore filed for bankruptcy and its assets were purchased by [[Escom (computer corp)|Escom]], a German PC manufacturer, who created the subsidiary company Amiga Technologies. They re-released the A1200 and A4000T, and introduced a new [[68060]] version of the A4000T. However, Escom in turn went bankrupt in 1997. The Amiga brand was then sold to another PC manufacturer, [[Gateway 2000]], which had announced grand plans for it. However, in 2000, Gateway sold the Amiga brand without having released any products. The current owner of the trademark, [[Amiga, Inc.]], licensed the rights to sell hardware using the [[AmigaOne]] brand to computer vendors Eyetech Group, Ltd. and A-Eon Technology CVBA. Unofficial Amiga clones were developed by Italian hardware company, Acube.

== Hardware ==
At its core, the Amiga has a custom chipset consisting of several [[coprocessor]]s, which handle audio, video and [[direct memory access]] independently of the [[Central Processing Unit]] (CPU). This architecture freed up the Amiga's processor for other tasks and gave the Amiga a performance edge over its competitors, particularly in terms of video-intensive applications and games.&lt;ref name=&quot;amiga_hardware_ref&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Commodore-Amiga, Inc. | title=Amiga Hardware Reference Manual | edition=Third | series=Amiga Technical Reference Series | year=1991 | publisher=Addison-Wesley | isbn=0-201-56776-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The general Amiga architecture uses two distinct [[bus (computing)|bus]] subsystems, namely, the chipset bus and the CPU bus. The chipset bus allows the custom coprocessors and CPU to address [[Amiga Chip RAM|&quot;Chip RAM&quot;]]. The CPU bus provides addressing to other subsystems, such as, conventional RAM, ROM and the [[Zorro II]] or [[Zorro III]] expansion subsystems. This architecture enables independent operation of the subsystems. CPU expansion boards may provide additional custom buses. Additionally, &quot;busboards&quot; or &quot;bridgeboards&quot; may provide [[Industry Standard Architecture|ISA]] or [[Conventional PCI|PCI]] buses.&lt;ref name=&quot;amiga_hardware_ref&quot;/&gt;

=== Central processing unit ===
&lt;!-- Removed image: [[Image:Motorola PowerPC 604e 233MHz.jpg|75px|thumb|right|&lt;small&gt;[[PowerPC]] processor.&lt;/small&gt;]] --&gt;

The [[Motorola]] [[Motorola 68000 family|68000]] series of microprocessors was used in all Amiga models from Commodore. While the 68000 family has a [[32-bit]] design, the 68000 used in several early models is generally referred to as 16-bit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/oneamiga1.html | title = The One for 16-bit Games | accessdate = 2007-07-17 | first = Gareth | last = Knight | work = Amiga History Guide }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://amigareviews.classicgaming.gamespy.com/s_snippe.htm | title = Amiga Reviews: Zzap 16-Bit Gaming|accessdate =2008-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 68000 has a [[16-bit]] external [[data bus]] so must transfer 32 bits of data in two consecutive steps, a technique called [[multiplexing]]&amp;nbsp;â all this is transparent to the software, which was 32-bit from the beginning. The 68000 could address 16 MB of physical memory. Later Amiga models featured full 32-bit CPUs with a larger address space and [[instruction pipeline]] facilities. Commodore's design choice to remain with the 68000 architecture ensured that code was backward-compatible across the Amiga line.

CPU upgrades were offered by both Commodore and third-party manufacturers. Most Amiga models can be upgraded either by direct CPU replacement or through expansion boards. Such boards often featured faster and higher capacity memory interfaces and [[hard disk drive|hard disk]] controllers.

Towards the end of Commodore's time in charge of Amiga development there were suggestions that Commodore intended to move away from the 68000 series to higher performance [[Reduced instruction set computing|RISC]] processors, such as the [[PA-RISC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;actuator&quot;&gt;{{citation | url=http://www.thule.no/haynie/research/acutiatr/docs/acu1.pdf | title=Architecture Specification for Acutiator | first=Dave | last=Haynie | publisher=Commodore International Services Corporation, Technology Division | date=18 October 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haynie &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/haynie3drisc.html |title=CBM's Plans for the RISC-Chipset |author=Dave Haynie |date=1995.01.24 |quote=The initial schedule of 18 months was for the Hombre game machine hardware. There's no real OS here, just a library of routines, including a 3D package, which would probably be licensed. The Amiga OS was not to have run on this system in any form. |publisher=Gareth Knight |accessdate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these ideas were never developed before Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Despite this, third-party manufacturers designed upgrades featuring a combination of 68000 series and PowerPC processors along with a PowerPC native [[Kernel (computing)|micro-kernel]] and software.&lt;ref&gt;The Big Book of Amiga Hardware [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=154 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de], [http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/cgi-bin/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=225 AmigaHardware.MarioMisic.de]&lt;/ref&gt; Later Amiga clones featured PowerPC processors only.

=== Custom chipset ===
The custom chipset at the core of the Amiga design appeared in three distinct generations, with a large degree of backward-compatibility. The [[Original Chip Set]] (OCS) appeared with the launch of the A1000. OCS was eventually followed by the modestly improved [[Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) in 1990 and finally by the 32-bit [[Advanced Graphics Architecture]] (AGA) in 1992. Each chipset consists of several [[coprocessors]] which handle [[blitter|graphics acceleration]], digital audio, [[direct memory access]] and communication between various peripherals (e.g., CPU, memory and floppy disks). In addition, some models featured auxiliary [[Amiga custom chips|custom chip]]s which performed tasks, such as, [[SCSI]] control and display de-interlacing.

==== Graphics ====
[[Image:HAM6example.png|thumb|right|A 4096 color [[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM]] picture created with [[Photon Paint]] in 1989.]]

All Amiga systems can display full-screen animated graphics with 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64 ([[Amiga Halfbrite mode|EHB Mode]]) or 4096 colors ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]). Models with the AGA chipset (A1200 and A4000) also have non-EHB 64, 128, 256 and 262144 ([[Amiga Hold-and-Modify|HAM Mode]]) color modes and a palette expanded from 4096 to [[Truecolor|16.8 million colors]].
&lt;!-- Something about retargetable graphic hardware here --&gt;
The Amiga chipset can ''[[genlock]]''&amp;nbsp;â adjust its own screen refresh timing to match an NTSC or PAL video signal. When combined with setting transparency, this allows an Amiga to overlay an external video source with graphics. This ability made the Amiga popular for many applications, and provides the ability to do [[Character generator|character generation]] and [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects far more cheaply than earlier systems. Some frequent users of this ability included wedding videographers, TV stations and their weather forecasting divisions (for weather graphics and radar), advertising channels, music video production, and 'desktop video'. The [[NewTek]] [[Video Toaster]] was made possible by the genlock ability of the Amiga.

In 1988 the release of the Amiga A2024&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=863 Commodore: A2024]&lt;/ref&gt; fixed-frequency [[monochrome]] monitor with built-in framebuffer and flicker fixer hardware provided the Amiga with a choice of high-resolution graphic modes (1024Ã800 for NTSC and 1024Ã1024 for PAL).

==== Sound ====
The sound chip, named Paula, supports four sound channels (two for the left speaker and two for the right) with 8-bit resolution for each channel and a 6-bit volume control per channel. The analog output is connected to a low-pass filter, which filters out high-frequency aliases when the Amiga is using a lower sampling rate (see [[Nyquist limit]]). The brightness of the Amiga's power LED is used to indicate the status of the Amigaâs low-pass filter. The filter is active when the LED is at normal brightness, and deactivated when dimmed (or off on older A500 Amigas). On Amiga 1000 (and very first Amiga 500 and Amiga 2000 model), the power LED had no relation to the filter's status, a wire needed to be manually soldered between pins on the sound chip to disable the filter. Paula can read directly from the system's [[RAM]], using direct memory access (DMA), making sound playback without CPU intervention possible.

Although the hardware is limited to four separate sound channels, software such as ''[[OctaMED]]'' uses software mixing to allow eight or more virtual channels, and it was possible for software to mix two hardware channels to achieve a single 14-bit resolution channel by playing with the volumes of the channels in such a way that one of the source channels contributes the most significant bits and the other the least ones.

The quality of the Amiga's sound output, and the fact that the hardware is ubiquitous and easily addressed by software, were standout features of Amiga hardware unavailable on PC platforms for years. Third-party sound cards exist that provide DSP functions, multi-track direct-to-disk recording, multiple hardware sound channels and 16-bit and beyond resolutions. A retargetable sound API called [[AHI (Amiga)|AHI]] was developed allowing these cards to be used transparently by the OS and software.

=== Kickstart firmware ===
{{Main|Kickstart (Amiga)}}
Kickstart is the [[booting|bootstrap]] [[firmware]]. Its purpose is to initialize the Amiga hardware and core components of [[AmigaOS]] and then attempt to boot from a [[bootable]] [[volume (computing)|volume]], such as a floppy disk or hard disk drive.

The first production Amiga, the Amiga 1000, required Kickstart to be loaded first from floppy disk into 256 [[kilobyte|kB]] of RAM reserved for this purpose. Later models generally hold Kickstart on an embedded [[Read-only memory|ROM]] chip, improving start-up times. Models can be upgraded by replacing the ROM. Like the Amiga 1000, early Amiga 3000 systems loaded Kickstart from hard (or floppy) disk as the machine was launched while AmigaOS 2.0 was still in [[software release cycle#Beta|beta]] development.

Several third-party vendors produced switchable socket doublers to allow two ROM chips to plug into the single ROM socket on the motherboard. These became popular as later Kickstart versions caused some backwards compatibility problems with earlier Amiga software titles. The effect of these switchable doublers was a convenient [[dual boot]] system, with a choice of two distinct OS versions via a pre-determined key sequence at reboot, or via a two way switch installed in the case, depending on the specific version installed.

=== Peripherals ===
[[File:Amiga Sound Sampling Hardware.jpg|right|thumb|8-bit sound sampling hardware for the Amiga]]The Amiga was one of the first home computers for which inexpensive sound sampling and video digitization accessories were available. As a result of this and the Amiga's audio and video capabilities the Amiga became a popular system for editing and producing both music and video.

Many expansion boards were produced for Amiga computers to improve the performance and capability of the hardware, such as memory expansions, [[SCSI]] controllers, CPU boards, and graphics boards. Other upgrades include genlocks, Ethernet cards, modems, sound cards and samplers, video digitizers, extra serial ports, and IDE controllers. Additions after the demise of Commodore company are USB cards.

The most popular upgrades were memory, SCSI controllers and CPU accelerator cards. These were sometimes combined into the one device.

Early CPU accelerator cards feature full 32-bit CPUs of the 68000 family such as the [[Motorola 68020]] and [[Motorola 68030]], almost always with 32-bit memory and usually with [[floating point unit|FPUs]] and [[Memory management unit|MMUs]] or the facility to add them. Later designs feature the [[Motorola 68040]] and [[Motorola 68060]]. Both CPUs feature integrated FPUs and MMUs. Many CPU accelerator cards also had integrated SCSI controllers.

Phase5 designed the [[PowerUP (accelerator)|PowerUP]] boards ([[PowerUP (accelerator)#Blizzard PPC|Blizzard PPC]] and [[PowerUP (accelerator)#Cyberstorm PPC|CyberStorm PPC]]) featuring both a 68k (a 68040 or 68060) and a PowerPC (603 or 604) CPU, which are able to run the two CPUs at the same time (and share the system memory). The PowerPC CPU on PowerUP boards is usually used as a coprocessor for heavy computations (a powerful CPU is needed to run for example [[MAME]], but even decoding [[JPEG]] pictures and [[MP3]] audio was considered heavy computation at the time). It is also possible to ignore the 68k CPU and run [[Linux]] on the PPC (project Linux APUS), but a PowerPC native AmigaOS promised by Amiga Technologies GmbH was not available when the PowerUP boards first appeared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amiga goes POWER PC (TM)|url=http://www.cucug.org/amiga/aminews/1995/at951111.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

24-bit graphics cards and video cards were also available. Graphics cards are designed primarily for 2D artwork production, workstation use, and later, gaming. Video cards are designed for inputting and outputting video signals, and processing and manipulating video.

Perhaps the most famous video card in the North American market was the ''NewTek [[Video Toaster]]''. This was a powerful video effects board which turned the Amiga into an affordable video processing computer which found its way into many professional video environments. Due to its [[NTSC]]-only design it did not find a market in countries that used the [[PAL]] standard, such as in Europe. In PAL countries the ''OpalVision'' card was popular, although less featured and supported than the Video Toaster. Low-cost [[Timebase correction|time base correctors (TBCs)]] specifically designed to work with the Toaster quickly came to market, most of which were designed as standard Amiga bus cards.

Various manufacturers started producing PCI busboards for the A1200 and A4000, allowing standard Amiga computers to use PCI cards such as Voodoo graphic cards, [[Sound Blaster]] sound cards, 10/100 Ethernet cards, and TV tuner cards. Other manufacturers produced hybrid boards which contained an Intel x86 series chip, allowing the Amiga to emulate a PC.

PowerPC upgrades with Wide SCSI controllers, PCI busboards with Ethernet, sound and 3D graphics cards, and tower cases allowed the A1200 and A4000 to survive well into the late nineties.

Expansion boards were made by [[Richmond Sound Design]] that allow their [[show control]] and [[sound design]] software to communicate with their custom hardware frames either by ribbon cable or fiber optic cable for long distances, allowing the Amiga to control up to eight million digitally controlled external audio, lighting, automation, relay and voltage control channels spread around a large theme park, for example. See [[Amiga software]] for more information on these applications.

=== Networking ===
Amiga had three networking interface APIs:
* AS225 - Is the official Commodore TCP/IP stack [[Application programming interface|API]] with hardcoded drivers in revision 1 (AS225r1) for the [[AMD Lance Am7990|A2065 Ethernet]] and the A2060 Arcnet interfaces.&lt;ref name=&quot;amigahi_netfaq_AmiTCP&quot;/&gt; In revision 2 (AS225r2) the SANA-II interface was used.
* SANA-II&amp;nbsp;â Is a standardized API for hardware of network interfaces. It uses an inefficient buffer handling scheme, and lacks proper support for [[Promiscuous mode|promiscuous]] and [[multicast]] modes.
* Miami Network Interface (MNI) - Is an API that doesn't have the problems which SANA-II suffers from. It requires [[AmigaOS]] v2,04 or higher.

Different network media was used:

They are, in order of appearance: [[Amiga 1000|1000]], [[Amiga 2000|2000]], [[Amiga 500|500]], [[Amiga 1500|1500]], [[Amiga 2500|2500]], [[Amiga 3000|3000]], [[Amiga 3000UX|3000UX]], [[Amiga 3000T|3000T]], [[Amiga CDTV|CDTV]], [[Amiga 500+|500+]], [[Amiga 600|600]], [[Amiga 4000|4000]], [[Amiga 1200|1200]], [[Amiga CD32|CD32]], and [[Amiga 4000T|4000T]]. The PowerPC based [[AmigaOne]] was later produced from 2002 to 2005. Some companies have also released Amiga [[Clone (computer science)|clones]].

=== Commodore Amiga ===
[[Image:Amiga500 system.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 500]] (1987) was the best selling model.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/sales.html AmigaHistory.co.uk&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Image:Amiiga4000DP.jpg|thumb|The [[Amiga 4000]] (1992) was the last desktop computer made by Commodore.]]

The first Amiga model, the Amiga 1000, was launched in 1985 as a high-end home computer and became popular for its impressive graphics, video and audio capabilities. In 2006, [[PC World (magazine)|PC World]] rated the Amiga 1000 as the seventh greatest PC of all time, stating &quot;''Years ahead of its time, the Amiga was the world's first multimedia, multitasking personal computer''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,126692-page,8-c,systems/article.html PC World, The 25 Greatest PCs of All Time]&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the A1000, Commodore updated the desktop line of Amiga computers with the [[Amiga 2000]] in 1987, the [[Amiga 3000]] in 1990, and the [[Amiga 4000]] in 1992, each offering improved capabilities and expansion options. However, the best selling models were the budget models, particularly the highly successful [[Amiga 500]] (1987) and the [[Amiga 1200]] (1992). The [[Amiga 500+]] (1991) was the shortest lived model, replacing the Amiga 500 and lasting only six months until it was phased out and replaced with the [[Amiga 600]] (1992), which in turn was also quickly replaced by the Amiga 1200.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a500plus.html Commodore Amiga 500+]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Commodore CDTV|CDTV]], launched in 1991, was a [[CD-ROM]] based all-in-one multimedia system. It was an early attempt at a multi-purpose multimedia appliance in an era before multimedia consoles and CD-ROM drives were common. Unfortunately for Commodore, the system never achieved any real commercial success.

Commodore's last Amiga offering before filing for bankruptcy was an attempt to capture a portion of the highly competitive 1990s console market with the [[Amiga CD32]] (1993), a 32-bit CD-ROM games console. Though discontinued after Commodore's demise it met with moderate commercial success in Europe.

Following purchase of Commodore's assets by Escom in 1995, the A1200 and A4000T continued to be sold in small quantities until 1996, though the ground lost since the initial launch and the prohibitive expense of these units meant that the Amiga line never regained any real popularity.

Several Amiga models contained references to songs by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[The B-52's]]. Early A500 units, at least, had the words &quot;B52/ROCK LOBSTER&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollerfink.de/wp-content/rollerfink.blogs.com/photos/uncategorized/img_1518.JPG RollerFink.de]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Printed circuit board#Manufacturing|silk-screen printed]] onto their [[printed circuit board]], a reference to the popular song &quot;[[Rock Lobster]]&quot;  The [[Amiga 600]] referenced  &quot;JUNE BUG&quot; (after the song &quot;Junebug&quot;) and the [[Amiga 1200]] had &quot;CHANNEL Z&quot; (after &quot;[[Channel Z (song)|Channel Z]]&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Knight|first=Gareth|title=References to B52 songs on Amiga Motherboards|year=1997â2006|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/b52board.html|accessdate =2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== AmigaOS 4 systems ===
{{Main|AmigaOS 4}}

AmigaOS 4 (OS4) is designed for PowerPC Amiga systems and currently runs on both Amigas equipped with CyberstormPPC or BlizzardPPC accelerator boards, and on the PPC Teron series based [[AmigaOne]] computers built by [[Eyetech]] under license by Amiga Inc. AmigaOS 4.0 had been available only in developer pre-releases for numerous years until it was officially released in December 2006. Due to the nature of some provisions of the contract between Amiga Inc. and [[Hyperion Entertainment]] (the Belgian company which is developing the OS), the commercial AmigaOS 4 had been available only to licensed buyers of AmigaOne motherboards.

AmigaOS 4.0 for Amigas equipped with PowerUP accelerator boards was released in November 2007. The most recent release AmigaOS is 4.1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/articles/culture/amigaos41-ars.ars/5 It's alive!: Ars reviews AmigaOS 4.1], Ars Technica, September 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

No new Amiga hardware has been released since the AmigaOne; however [[Acube Systems]] has entered an agreement with Hyperion under which it has ported AmigaOS 4 to its [[Sam440ep]] and [[Sam460ex]] line of PowerPC-based motherboards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acube-systems.biz/eng/news.php?id=35 ''OEM Version of AmigaOS 4.1 for Sam440ep imminent''], Acube Systems, September 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 version for [[Pegasos|Pegasos II]] from [[Genesi]]/[[Bplan|bPlan GmbH]] was released in co-operation with Acube Systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amigaworld.net/modules/news/article.php?storyid=4740 ''AmigaOS 4.1 for Pegasos II''], Hyperion Entertainment, January 31, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, in 2009/2010, A-Eon Technology announced the [[AmigaOne X1000]].

=== Amiga hardware clones ===
Long-time Amiga developer MacroSystem entered the Amiga-clone market with their [http://www.amiga-hardware.com/showhardware.cgi?HARDID=43 DraCo] [[Non-linear editing system|nonlinear video edit]] system. It appears in two versions, initially a tower model and later a cube. DraCo expanded upon and combined a number of earlier expansion cards developed for Amiga (VLabMotion, Toccata, WarpEngine, RetinaIII) into a true Amiga-clone powered by Motorola's [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processor. The DraCo can run AmigaOS 3.1 up through AmigaOS 3.9. It is the only Amiga-based system to support [[FireWire]] for video I/O. DraCo also offers an Amiga-compatible [[Amiga Zorro II|ZORRO-II]] expansion bus and introduced a faster custom DraCoBus, capable of 30 MB/sec transfer rates (faster than Commodore's [[Amiga Zorro III|ZORRO-III]]). The technology was later used in the Casablanca system, a set-top-box also designed for non-linear video editing.

In 1998, [[Index Information]] released the Access, an Amiga-clone similar to the Amiga 1200, but on a motherboard which could fit into a standard [[Drive bay#5%&quot;|5 1/4&quot; drive bay]]. It features either a [[Motorola 68020|68020]] or [[Motorola 68030|68030]] CPU, with a redesigned [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset, and runs AmigaOS 3.1.

In 1998, former Amiga employees (John Smith, Peter Kittel, [[Dave Haynie]] and Andy Finkel to mention few) formed new company called PIOS. Their hardware platform, PIOS One, was aimed at Amiga, Atari and Macintosh users. The company was renamed to Met@box in 1999 until it folded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/pios/pios1.html|title=PIOS One}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NatAmi (short for ''Native Amiga'') hardware project began in 2005 with the aim of designing and building an Amiga [[Home computer remakes|clone]] motherboard that is enhanced with modern features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nr2.ru/technology/320289.html|title=ÐÑÐ¿ÑÑÐµÐ½ Ð¿ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¸Ð¿ Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¾Ð¹ Ð¼Ð¾Ð´ÐµÐ»Ð¸ ÐºÐ¾Ð¼Ð¿ÑÑÑÐµÑÐ¾Ð² Amiga (Ð¤ÐÐ¢Ð)|date=Feb 13, 2011|publisher=Ð Ð¾ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ÑÐºÐ¾Ðµ Ð¸Ð½ÑÐ¾ÑÐ¼Ð°ÑÐ¸Ð¾Ð½Ð½Ð¾Ðµ Ð°Ð³ÐµÐ½ÑÑÑÐ²Ð¾ Â«ÐÐ¾Ð²ÑÐ¹ Ð ÐµÐ³Ð¸Ð¾Ð½Â». ÐÐµÑÑÐ¸Ñ 2.0|language=Russian|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NatAmi motherboard is a standard [[Mini-ITX]]-compatible form factor computer motherboard, powered by a Motorola/Freescale [[68060]] and its chipset. It is compatible with the original Amiga chipset, which has been inscribed on a programmable FPGA [[Altera]] chip on the board. The NatAmi is the second Amiga clone project after the [[Minimig]] motherboard, and its history is very similar to that of the [[C-One]] mainboard developed by [[Jeri Ellsworth]] and [[Jens SchÃ¶nfeld]]. From a commercial point of view, Natami's circuitry and design are currently [[Closed Source]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} One goal of the NatAmi project is to design an Amiga-compatible motherboard that includes up-to-date features but that does not rely on emulation (as in [[WinUAE]]), modern PC [[Intel]] components, or a modern [[PowerPC]] mainboard. As such, NatAmi is not intended to become another evolutionary heir to classic Amigas (such as with [[AmigaOne]] or [[Pegasos]] computers). This &quot;purist&quot; philosophy essentially limits the resulting processor speed but puts the focus on bandwidth and low latencies. The developers also recreated the entire Amiga chipset, freeing it from Classic Amiga legacy limitations such as two [[megabytes]] of audio and video graphics RAM as in the [[Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA chipset]], and rebuilt this new chipset by programming a modern [[FPGA]] [[Altera]] Cyclone IV chip. Later, the developers decided to create from scratch a new software-form processor chip, codenamed &quot;N68050&quot; that resides in the physical Altera FPGA programmable chip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, two new Amiga clones were announced, both using [[Field-programmable gate array|FPGA]] based hardware synthesis to replace the Amiga [[Amiga Original chipset|OCS]] custom chipset. The first, the [[Minimig]], is a personal project of Dutch engineer Dennis van Weeren.  Referred to as &quot;new Amiga hardware&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;minimig&quot;&gt;[http://home.hetnet.nl/~weeren001/minimig.html HetNet.nl]&lt;/ref&gt; the original model was built on a [[Xilinx]] Spartan-3 development board, but soon a dedicated board was developed. The minimig uses the FPGA to reproduce the custom Denise, Agnus, Paula and [[Amiga custom chips#Gary|Gary]] chips as well as both 8520 [[MOS Technology CIA|CIAs]] and implements a simple version of [[Amiga custom chips#Amber|Amber]].  The rest of the chips are an actual 68000 CPU, ram chips, and a PIC microcontroller for [[BIOS]] control.&lt;ref name=&quot;minimig&quot;/&gt;  The design for Minimig was released as [[open source]] on July 25, 2007. In February, 2008, an Italian company [[Acube Systems]] began selling Minimig boards. A third party upgrade replaces the PIC microcontroller with a more powerful ARM processor, providing more functionality such as write access and support for hard disk images. The minimig core is being ported to the FPGArcade &quot;Replay&quot; board. The Replay uses a larger FPGA which will support the AGA chipset and a 63030 soft core. The Replay board is designed to emulate many older computers and classic arcade machines.

The second is the Clone-A system announced by [[Individual Computers]]. As of mid 2007 it has been shown in its development form, with FPGA-based boards replacing the Amiga chipset and mounted on an Amiga 500 motherboard.&lt;ref name=&quot;individual&quot;&gt;[http://siliconsonic.de/news/news118_e.htm SiliconSonic.de]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 by ArcadeRetroGaming, called the Multiple Classic Computer, which emulates the Commodore 64. Support for Amiga software is planned.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Emulation ===
{{Main|Amiga emulation}}
Like many popular but discontinued platforms, the Amiga has been the target of various emulation projects so that software developed for the Amiga can be run on other computer platforms without the original hardware. Such emulators attempt to replicate the functionality of the Amiga architecture in software. As mentioned above, attempts have also been made to replicate the Amiga chipset in [[FPGA]] chips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acube-systems.biz/index.php?page=news&amp;id=23 &quot;Minimig available&quot; announcement by Acube Systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most challenging aspects of emulation is the design of the Amiga chipset, which relies on cycle-critical timings. As a result, early emulators did not always achieve the intended results though later emulator versions can now accurately reproduce the behavior of Amiga systems.

== Operating systems ==
=== AmigaOS ===
{{Main|AmigaOS}}
{{Rquote|right|&quot;[AmigaOS] remains one of the great operating systems of the past 20 years, incorporating a small kernel and tremendous [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] capabilities the likes of which have only recently been developed in [[OS/2]] and [[Windows NT]]. The biggest difference is that the AmigaOS could operate fully and multitask in as little as {{nowrap|250 K}} of address space.&lt;br /&gt;--''[[John C. Dvorak]], PC Magazine,'' October 1996.&lt;ref&gt;From PC Magazine, October 22, 1996
Inside Track By John C. Dvorak&lt;/ref&gt;}}

AmigaOS is a single-user [[Computer multitasking|multitasking]] [[operating system]]. It was developed first by Commodore International, and initially introduced in 1985 with the Amiga 1000. Original versions run on the Motorola 68000 series of microprocessors, while [[AmigaOS 4]] runs only on PowerPC microprocessors. At the time of release AmigaOS put an operating system that was well ahead of its time into the hands of the average consumer. It was one of the first commercially available consumer operating systems for personal computers to implement [[Preemption (computing)|preemptive]] multitasking.

Another notable feature was the combined use of both a [[command-line interface]] and [[graphical user interface]]. [[AmigaDOS]] was the disk operating system and command line portion of the OS and [[Workbench (AmigaOS)|Workbench]] the native graphical windowing, [[Icon (computer)|icon]]s, menu and pointer environment for file management and launching applications. Notably, AmigaDOS allowed long [[filename]]s (up to 107 characters) with [[Whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] and did not require [[file extension]]s. The [[windowing system]] and user interface engine which handles all input events is called [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]].&lt;ref name=&quot;amiga_intuition_ref&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first1=Robert J. | last1=Mical | first2=Susan| last2=Deyl | authorlink1=RJ Mical | title=Amiga Intuition Reference Manual | series=Amiga Technical Reference Series | year=1987 | publisher=Addison-Wesley Publishing Company, Inc. | isbn=0-201-11076-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The multi-tasking kernel was called [[Exec (Amiga)|Exec]]. It acts as a scheduler for tasks running on the system, providing pre-emptive multitasking with prioritised round-robin scheduling. It enabled true pre-emptive multitasking in as little as 256 kB of free memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;cunningham_lee_amiga_exec&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cunningham-lee.com/misc/amiga_exec.html|title=Byte Magazine on the Amiga Exec|accessdate=2008-04-12|last= Holloway|first= Tim}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like other operating systems of the time, the OS lacks [[memory protection]]. This was because the [[Motorola 68000|68000]] [[CPU]] does not include a [[memory management unit]] and therefore there is no way to enforce protection of memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;google.groups.com (Memory Protection)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.advocacy/msg/7d0bf445a2c22d67?hl=en&amp;|title= Adding Memory Protection (MP) to the Amiga|work = groups.google.com|accessdate = December 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although this speeds and eases [[inter-process communication]] (programs can communicate by simply passing a [[Pointer (computing)|pointer]] back and forth), the lack of memory protection made the AmigaOS more vulnerable to [[Crash (computing)|crashes]] from badly behaving [[Computer program|programs]], and fundamentally incapable of enforcing any form of security model since any program had full access to the system. A co-operational memory protection feature was implemented in [[AmigaOS 4]] and could be retrofitted to old AmigaOS systems using [[Enforcer (Amiga)|Enforcer]] or [[CyberGuard]] tools.

The problem was somewhat exacerbated by Commodore's initial decision to release documentation relating not only to the OS's underlying software routines, but also to the hardware itself, enabling intrepid programmers who cut their teeth on the Commodore 64 to [[Peek and Poke|POKE]] the hardware directly, as was done on the older platform. While the decision to release the documentation was a popular one and allowed the creation of fast, sophisticated sound and graphics routines in games and demos, it also contributed to system instability as some programmers lacked the expertise to program at this level. For this reason, when the new [[Advanced Graphics Architecture|AGA]] chipset was released, [[Commodore International|Commodore]] declined to release low-level documentation in an attempt to force developers into using the approved software routines.

==== Influence on other operating systems ====

AmigaOS directly or indirectly inspired the development of various operating systems. [[MorphOS]] and [[AROS]] clearly inherit heavily from the structure of AmigaOS as explained directly in articles regarding these two operating systems. AmigaOS also influenced [[BeOS]], which featured a centralized system of [[Amiga support and maintenance software#Datatypes|Datatypes]], similar to that present in AmigaOS. Likewise, [[DragonFlyBSD]] was also inspired by AmigaOS as stated by Dragonfly developer [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]] who is a former Amiga developer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2006-02/msg00087.html Re: User-Space Device Drivers], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 28 February 2006. Retrieved 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/kernel/2003-07/msg00049.html Re: You could do worse than Mach ports], [[Matthew Dillon (computer scientist)|Matthew Dillon]], Dragonfly Kernel mailing list, 17 July 2003. Retrieved 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[WindowLab]] and [[amiwm]] are among several [[window manager]]s for the [[X Window System]] seek to mimic the Workbench interface.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

=== Unix and Unix-like systems ===
Commodore-Amiga produced [[Amiga Unix]], informally known as Amix, based on AT&amp;T [[UNIX System V|SVR4]]. It supports the [[Amiga 2500]] and Amiga 3000 and was included with the [[Amiga 3000UX]]. Among other unusual features of Amix is a hardware-accelerated windowing system which can scroll windows without copying data. Amix is not supported on the later Amiga systems based on [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]] processors.

Other, still maintained, operating systems are available for the classic Amiga platform, including Linux and [[NetBSD]]. Both require a CPU with MMU such as the [[Motorola 68020|68020]] with [[Motorola 68851|68851]] or full versions of the [[Motorola 68030|68030]], [[Motorola 68040|68040]] or [[Motorola 68060|68060]]. There is also a version of Linux for Amigas with PowerPC accelerator cards. [[Debian]] and [[Yellow Dog Linux]] can run on the AmigaOne.

There is an official, older version of [[OpenBSD]]. The last Amiga release is 3.2. [[Minix]] 1.5.10 also runs on Amiga.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.compwisdom.com/topics/Minix Minix] ''Comp Wisdon''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emulating other systems ===
{{Main|Emulation on the Amiga}}
The Amiga is able to emulate other computer platforms ranging from many 8-bit systems such as the [[Sinclair ZX Spectrum]], Commodore 64, Nintendo Game Boy, Nintendo Entertainment System, [[Apple II]] and the [[TRS-80]], up to platforms such as the IBM PC, Apple Macintosh and Atari ST. [[MAME]] (the arcade machine emulator) is also available for Amiga systems with PPC accelerator card upgrades.

== Amiga software ==
{{Main|Amiga software}}
The Amiga was a primary target for productivity and game development during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Software was often developed for the Amiga and the [[Atari ST]] simultaneously, since the ST had a similar CPU architecture.

&lt;!-- Technical trivialities, like how many bytes that is moved across the bus, is not all that interesting. And try to keep AmigaOS stuff to the AmigaOS article --&gt;
[[Aminet]] was created in 1992 and until around 1996, was the largest public archive of software, art and documents for any platform.

== Boing Ball ==
[[Image:boingball.png|thumb|The Boing Ball.]]
The Boing Ball has been synonymous with Amiga since its public release in 1985. The bouncing ball (or other graphical elements) has been a popular theme in computer [[demo effect]]s since the 1950s, when a bouncing ball demo was released for [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]] computers and became the primary theme for early Atari games [[Pong]] and [[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]. [[Commodore International|Commodore]] released a bouncing ball demo at the 1978 [[Consumer Electronics Show]], to illustrate the capabilities of the VIC chip. A similar theme was used by Amiga Corporation to demonstrate the capabilities of the Amiga computer at the 1984 Winter Consumer Electronics Show in January 1984. It was a real-time [[animation]] showing a red-and-white spinning ball (about 1/4 screen size) bouncing up and down and casting a shadow on a wall behind it. The echoing deep Bong! sound and left-right motion was added soon after the show was over. Since then, the Boing Ball became one of the most well-known symbols for Amiga and compatible computers.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} Within the context of this tradition of bouncing ball demos at the Consumer Electronics Show, CBS Electronics also showed a Bouncing Ball demo for the [[Atari]] VCS/2600, with a spinning and bouncing ball, at the same event.

The 1984 Boing Ball demo was one of the very first demos shown on the Amiga. It was specifically designed to take advantage of the Amiga's custom graphics, achieving a level of speed and smoothness not previously seen on an affordable computer. The 1984 demo ran standalone as there was no official DOS operating system and Intuition was just a glint in [[Robert J. Mical|RJ Mical]]'s eye at the time. A year later this demo was converted to operate in an [[Intuition (Amiga)|Intuition]] Screen, allowing the higher resolution Amiga Workbench screen to be dragged down to make the Boing Ball visible from behind, bouncing up above the Workbench while the Workbench remained fully active. Since the Boing Ball used almost no CPU time (only to calculate the bounce angles - animation was handled by playfield vertical and horizontal scrolling tricks, the rotation animation was done with [[color cycling]] in the graphics chip, and of course the sound chip handled the sound), this made a particularly impressive demonstration of multitasking at the time.

The Boing Ball itself was never adopted as a [[trademark]] by [[Commodore International|Commodore]]. The official Amiga trademark is a rainbow-colored double [[checkmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/originsboing.html|title=Dr. Ryan Czerwinski of Merlancia Industries explains the origin of the Amiga Boing ball and checkmark|author=Ryan Czerwinski|date=December 31, 2001|work=Amiga Network News| accessdate=2010-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Amiga community ==
When Commodore went bankrupt in 1994, there remained a very active Amiga community, which continued to support the platform long after mainstream commercial vendors abandoned it. The most popular Amiga magazine, ''[[Amiga Format]]'', continued to publish editions until 2000, some six years after Commodore filed for bankruptcy. Another magazine, ''[[Amiga Active]]'', was launched in 1999 and was published until 2001. Several magazines are in publication today, notably ''Amiga Future'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigafuture.de Amigafuture.de]&lt;/ref&gt; which is available in both English and German; ''Bitplane.it'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bitplane.it Bitplane.it]&lt;/ref&gt; a bi-monthly magazine in Italian; and ''AmigaPower'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://amigapower.free.fr/ Amigapower.free.fr]&lt;/ref&gt; a long-running French magazine.

In spite of declining interest in the platform there was a bi-weekly specialist column in the UK weekly magazine [[Micro Mart]]. There is also a web site,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amiga.org/index.php Amiga.org]&lt;/ref&gt; that has served as a community discussion and support resource since the 1994 bankruptcy. Other popular English-language [[Internet forum|''fora'']] also exist, particularly &lt;code&gt;Amigaworld.net&lt;/code&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigaworld.net AmigaWorld.net]&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;code&gt;English Amiga Board&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eab.abime.net/ EAB.abime.net]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable historic uses ==

The Amiga series of computers found a place in early computer graphic design and television presentation. Below are some examples of notable uses and users:
*Season 1 and part of season 2 of the television series ''[[Babylon 5]]'' were rendered in LightWave 3D on Amigas.&lt;ref name=lurk-effects&gt;[http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/making/effects.html The Lurker's Guide to Babylon 5]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lurk-thornton&gt;[http://www.midwinter.com/lurk/making/thornton.html An Interview with Ron Thornton], October 16, 1995.  &quot;Effects are designed on an accelerated Amiga 2000 with a Video Toaster board in it, using LightWave 3-D and Modeler 3-D.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Other television series using Amigas for special effects included ''[[SeaQuest DSV]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newtek-europe.com/uk/community/lightwave/gorner/1.html Interview with Matt Gorner]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Max Headroom (TV series)|Max Headroom]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g4tv.com/techtvvault/features/37823/Max_Headroom_on_TechTV.html 'Max Headroom' on TechTV]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, many other celebrities and notable individuals have made use of the Amiga:&lt;ref&gt;For other notable users see [http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/fau/main.html Famous Amiga Users at AmigaHistory].&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Andy Warhol]] was an early user of the Amiga and appeared at the launch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnode.org/text/andywarhol/index.html|title=Amiga Andy article|work=Artnode online}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he made a computer artwork of [[Debbie Harry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3oqUd8utr14 Andy Warhol paints Debbie Harry on an Amiga], Uploaded by theisotope on March 7, 2008 on YouTube.&lt;/ref&gt; Warhol used the Amiga to create a new style of art made with computers, and was the author of a multimedia opera called ''&quot;you are the one&quot;'' which consists of an animated sequence featuring images of actress [[Marilyn Monroe]] assembled in a short movie with a soundtrack. The video was discovered on two old Amiga floppies in a drawer in Warhol's studio and repaired in 2006 by the Detroit Museum of New Art.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.com/section/news/index.asp?int_sec=2&amp;int_new=18091|title=Artdaily article about the discovery and repair of &quot;you are the one&quot;|work=Artdaily|accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pop artist has been quoted as saying: ''&quot;The thing I like most about doing this kind of work on the Amiga is that it looks like my work in other media.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Amiga World Magazine|url=http://www.artnode.org/text/andywarhol/amigandy.pdf|title=Interview with Andy Warhol|accessdate=2007-01-07|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Art Journal, Vol 49 No 3, Computers and Art: Issues of Content (Autumn, 1990) pp. 248-252|url=http://links.jstor.org/sici?sici=0004-3249%28199023%2949%3A3%3C248%3ATDRAIT%3E2.0.CO%3B2-V&amp;size=LARGE|title=The Digital Revolution: Art in the Computer Age|author=Cynthia Goodman|accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A pioneer of the [[Digital Art]] movement, [[Laurence Gartel]], along with Jeff Bruette,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artnode.org/text/andywarhol/index.html Amigaworld, January 1986]: Retrieved May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  personally taught Andy Warhol how to use the Amiga and relevant software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galleriiizu.com/currentexhibition.html Galleriiizu.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Actor [[Dick Van Dyke]] was a self-described &quot;rabid&quot; user of the Amiga, although he has since switched to other platforms and sold most of his Amiga equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/blogs/jim_hill/archive/2004/08/11/443.aspx|title=Dick van Dyke at SIGGRAPH|accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Katie Hafner|url=http://www.nytimes.com/library/tech/00/06/circuits/articles/22amig.html?oref=login|title=The Return of a Desktop Cult Classic (No, Not the Mac)|publisher=New York Times|date=2000-06-22|accessdate=2007-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Amigas were used in various [[NASA]] laboratories to keep track of multiple low orbiting satellites, and were still used up to 2003/04 (dismissed and sold in 2006). This is another example of long lifetime reliability of Amiga hardware, as well as professional use. Amigas were also used at Kennedy Space Center to run strip-chart recorders, to format and display data, and control stations of platforms for [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta rocket]] launches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://obligement.free.fr/articles/amiganasa.php|title=Reportage: l'Amiga Ã  la NASA|publisher=obligement.free.fr }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Artist [[Jean Giraud|Jean &quot;Moebius&quot; Giraud]] credits the Amiga he bought for his son as a bridge to learning about &quot;using paint box programs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/2.01/moebius.html|title=Moebius|publisher=Wired }}&lt;/ref&gt; He uploaded some of his early experiments to the file sharing forums on [[CompuServe]].
*[[Tom Fulp]] is noted as saying he used the Amiga as his first computer for creating cartoons and animations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamedev.net/columns/interviews/tomfulp.asp Tol Fulp interview]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[London Transport Museum]] developed their own interactive multi-media software for the CD32. The software included a walkthrough of various exhibits and a virtual tour of the museum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/press/indexcd32.html CD32: The Hyper-Museum Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic]] film ''[[UHF (film)|UHF]]'' contains a computer animated music video parody of the [[Dire Straits]] song &quot;[[Money for Nothing (song)|Money for Nothing]]&quot;, titled &quot;[[Money For Nothing/Beverly Hillbillies]]&quot;. According to the DVD commentary track, this spoof was created on an Amiga home computer.&lt;ref&gt;''UHF'' DVD commentary track&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Rolf Harris]] used an Amiga to digitize his hand-drawn art work for animation on his television series, ''Rolf's Cartoon Club''.
*[[Todd Rundgren]]'s video &quot;Change Myself&quot; was produced with Toaster and Lightwave.
*An Amiga 1000 can be seen in the movie ''[[Disorderlies]]'' in the background running a heart animation.
*An Amiga 4000 was in Michael Jackson's movie ''[[Michael Jackson's Ghosts|Ghosts]]''. At the left of the screen, an Amiga monitor and keyboard can be easily seen at the end credit. (at exactly 38:40)
*Scottish pop artist [[Calvin Harris]] composed his debut album ''[[I Created Disco]]'' with an [[Amiga 1200]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scala-london.co.uk/scala/event.php?id=656|title=Calvin Harris|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2008-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Susumu Hirasawa]], a [[Japan]]ese [[Electropop]]-[[artist]] is known for using Amigas to compose and perform music.
*Electronic musician [[Max Tundra]] also created his three albums with an Amiga 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cokemachineglow.com/track_review/3960|title=Track Reviews on Cokemachineglow|publisher=cokemachineglow|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2008-11-29}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A black Commodore Amiga 1200 was seen on an episode of ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'', used as evidence to lead to a murder suspect. A clip of this show hosted on [[YouTube]] became infamous because of the high number of errors in such a minor mention. Among many other errors, an [[IBM 5150]] (the first PC) was shown as its floppy drive, and it was described as using &quot;a homemade operating system&quot; with a &quot;6800 chipset&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xazjgsx4SJw|title=YouTube - Bones S03E07 Amiga clip}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Tom Berenger|Tom Berenger's]] character Gary Simmons uses an Amiga 500 for his KKK network in the 1988 movie ''[[Betrayed (1988 film)|Betrayed]]''.
*Amiga 500 motherboards were used, in conjunction with a [[Laserdisc]] player and [[Genlock]] device, in arcade games manufactured by [[American Laser Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dragons-lair-project.com/tech/pages/alg.asp|title=American Laser Games Tech Center|publisher=Dragon's Lair Project|accessdate=2009-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A custom [[Amiga 4000T]] motherboard was used in the HDI 1000 medical ultrasound system built by Bothell, Washington based Advanced Technology Labs (now part of Philips Medical Systems).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PG01&amp;p=1&amp;u=/netahtml/PTO/srchnum.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=20070106157.PGNR.&amp;OS=DN/20070106157&amp;RS=DN/20070106157|title=United States Patent Application 20070106157}}&lt;/ref&gt;
