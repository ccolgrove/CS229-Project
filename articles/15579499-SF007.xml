'''Dragon Player''' is a simple [[media player (application software)|media player]] for the [[KDE]] [[desktop environment]]. It is the renamed continuation of a video player for [[KDE 3]] called Codeine, which was originally created and developed by Max Howell, and is now developed by Ian Monroe under the new name for [[KDE Software Compilation 4|KDE SC 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragonplayer.net/ Dragon Player website]&lt;/ref&gt; Because Dragon Player makes use of [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]]âa multimedia API that itself connects to any of several [[multimedia framework]]sâit will play anything the particular connected [[multimedia framework]] supports. It was the default video player in the KDE 4 version of [[Kubuntu]] from 8.04 to 9.10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kubuntu.org/announcements/8.04-release.php Kubuntu 8.04 Released]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Features ===
* Simple interface
* Resuming videos
* Support for subtitles
* Video display settings (brightness, contrast)
* Due to using [[Solid (KDE)|Solid]] and [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]], Dragon Player is independent of any multimedia framework or hardware abstraction layer
* Supports playing CDs and DVDs&lt;ref&gt;[http://dot.kde.org/1201910126/ KDE Commit-Digest for 27th January 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
