The '''OSU Ice Rink''' is a 1,000 seat hockey rink located at [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio]], United States. The rink was built in 1961, and houses the [[Ohio State Buckeyes women's ice hockey]] team and the [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's ice hockey]] team. The men's hockey team occupied the facility from 1963 until 1998, when the [[Value City Arena]] was completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first =Craig |last =Merz |title =Curtain falls on old rink |publisher =Columbus Dispatch |page =12H |date =1998-12-04 |accessdate =2006-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1999 renovation brought the rink to full [[National Hockey League|NHL]] dimensions and improved the facilities. The rink is located adjacent to the east side of [[St. John Arena]] on Woody Hayes Drive, just north of [[Ohio Stadium]].

In 2007, the men's Buckeye hockey team played three preliminary-round [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association|CCHA]] tournament games at the Ice Rink due to scheduling conflicts with the OHSAA Wrestling Tournament at Value City Arena. These games marked the men's ice hockey team's first game in the Ice Rink since 1999.
