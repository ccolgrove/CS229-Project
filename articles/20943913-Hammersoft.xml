The '''2009 [[Atlanta Falcons]] season''' was the 44th season for the team in the [[National Football League]]. The team looked to match or improve upon their 11â5 record from [[2008 Atlanta Falcons season|2008]] and return to the playoffs, however the Falcons were eliminated from contention in Week 15. Despite not making the playoffs, the team, with a record of 9â7, posted consecutive winning seasons for the first time in franchise history. The only Falcon this year to play in the Pro Bowl was Roddy White. He finished the game with 8 catches and 84 yards.
