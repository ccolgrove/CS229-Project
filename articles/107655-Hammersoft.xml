'''Malibu''' ({{IPA-en|ËmÃ¦lÉ¨buË|pron}}) is an affluent, beachfront city in northwestern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]]. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 12,645. Malibu consists of a {{convert|21|mi|km|sing=on}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.malibu.ca.us/index.cfm?fuseaction=nav&amp;navid=3 Length of City of Malibu (Malibu before incorporation was {{convert|27|mi|km}}] from the City of Malibu's website&lt;/ref&gt; strip of prime Pacific coastline. The community is famous for its warm, sandy beaches, and for being the home of many Hollywood movie stars and others associated with the entertainment industry. Signs around the city proclaim &quot;27 miles of scenic beauty&quot;, referring to Malibu's original length of {{convert|27|mi|km}} before the city was incorporated in 1991.

Most Malibu residents live within a few hundred yards of [[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]] ([[California State Route 1|State Route 1]]), which traverses the city, with some residents living up to a mile away from the beach up narrow canyons, and many more residents of the unincorporated canyon areas identifying Malibu as their hometown.  The city is also bounded (more or less) by [[Topanga, California|Topanga Canyon]] to the East, the [[Santa Monica Mountains]] consisting of [[Agoura Hills]], [[Calabasas]], and [[Woodland Hills]] to the North, the [[Pacific Ocean]] to the South, and [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]] to the West.

Malibu's beaches include Surfrider Beach, [[Zuma Beach]], Malibu State Beach, Topanga State Beach, Point Dume State Beach and Dan Blocker Beach; its local parks include Malibu Bluffs Park&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.malibu.ca.us/index.cfm?fuseaction=detailgroup&amp;navid=174&amp;cid=3826 Malibu Bluffs Park (local)] from the City of Malibu's website&lt;/ref&gt; (formerly Malibu Bluffs State Park), Trancas Canyon Park, Las Flores Creek Park, and Legacy Park,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibulegacy.org/ Malibu Legacy Park (local)]&lt;/ref&gt; with neighboring parks [[Malibu Creek State Park]], [[Leo Carrillo State Park|Leo Carrillo State Beach and Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/?page_id=616 Leo Carrillo SB]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Point Mugu State Park]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=630 Pt. Mugu SP]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area]], and neighboring state beach Robert H. Meyer Memorial State Beach,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=633 Robert H. Meyer Memorial SB]&lt;/ref&gt; that was once part of Old Malibu (before Malibu became a city), and better known as pristine beaches, El Pescador, La Piedra and El Matador.

==History==
Malibu was originally settled by the [[Chumash (tribe)|Chumash]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] whose territory extended loosely from the [[San Joaquin Valley]] to [[San Luis Obispo]] to Malibu, as well as several islands off the southern coast of California. They named it &quot;''Humaliwo''&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24435 Humaliwo: An Ethnographic Overview of the Chumas in Malibu]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;the surf sounds loudly.&quot; The city's name derives from this, as the &quot;Hu&quot; syllable is not stressed.

[[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Juan Cabrillo]] is believed to have moored at Malibu Lagoon, at the mouth of Malibu Creek, to obtain fresh water in 1542. The Spanish presence returned with the [[Spanish Missions of California|California mission]] system, and the area was part of [[Rancho Topanga Malibu Sequit]] â a {{convert|13000|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[land grant]] â in 1802. That ranch passed intact to [[Frederick Hastings Rindge]] in 1891. He and his widow, Rhoda May Rindge, guarded their privacy zealously by hiring guards to evict all trespassers and fighting a lengthy court battle to prevent the building of a [[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]] railroad line. Few roads even entered the area before 1929, when the state won another court case and built what is now known as the [[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]]. By then May Rindge was forced to subdivide her property and begin selling and leasing lots. The Rindge house, known as the [[Adamson House]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=672 Adamson House]&lt;/ref&gt; (a [[National Register of Historic Places]] site and [[California Historical Landmark]]), is now part of Malibu Creek State Park and is situated between [[Malibu Lagoon State Beach]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=835 Malibu Lagoon State Beach]&lt;/ref&gt; and Surfrider Beach, beside the Malibu Pier&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parks.ca.gov/default.asp?page_id=24409 Malibu Pier]&lt;/ref&gt; that was originally built for the family yacht.

In 1926, in an effort to avoid selling land to stave off insolvency, Rhoda May Rindge created a small ceramic tile factory. At its height, Malibu Potteries employed over 100 workers, and produced decorative tiles which furnish many [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-area public buildings and [[Beverly Hills]] residences. The factory, located one-half mile east of the pier, was ravaged by a fire in 1931. Although the factory partially reopened in 1932, it could not recover from the effects of the [[Great Depression]] and a steep downturn in Southern California construction projects. A distinct hybrid of [[Moorish]] and [[Arts and crafts]] designs, Malibu tile is considered highly collectible. Fine examples of the tiles may be seen at the Adamson House and Serra Retreat, a fifty-room mansion that was started in the 1920s as the main Rindge home on a hill overlooking the lagoon. The unfinished building was sold to the [[Franciscan]] Order in 1942&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serraretreat.com/about/index.htm Rindge House sold to Franciscans] from serraretreat.com&lt;/ref&gt; and is operated as a [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] facility,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.serraretreat.com/ Serra Retreat]&lt;/ref&gt; Serra Retreat. It burned in the 1970 fire and was rebuilt using many of the original tiles.

'''Malibu Colony''' was one of the first areas inhabited after Malibu was opened to the public in 1929 and it is one of Malibu's most famous districts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://malibuca.org/ MalibuCa.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is located south of Malibu Road and the Pacific Coast Highway, west of Malibu Lagoon State Beach, and east of Malibu Bluffs Park (formerly a state park). Initially May Rindge kept control of Malibu Beach, allowing a few wealthy Hollywood stars to build vacation homes. Nearly a decade later, money woes forced Rindge to sell the land, and the Colony was born. Long known as a popular private enclave for wealthy celebrities,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seeing-stars.com/Live/Malibu.shtml Celebrities living in Malibu Colony] from seeing-stars.com&lt;/ref&gt; the Malibu Colony today is a [[gated community]], with multi-million dollar homes on small lots. The Colony commands breathtaking views of the Pacific Ocean, affording a spectacular coastline view stretching from [[Santa Monica]] to [[Rancho Palos Verdes]] to the south (known locally as the ''Queen's Necklace''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trails.com/rentals/propertyna.asp?vacation=01044_Thousand+Oaks_California Malibu to RPV: Queen's Necklace] from trails.com&lt;/ref&gt;) and the bluffs of [[Point Dume]] to the north.

'''High technology in Malibu''': the first working model of a [[laser]] was demonstrated by Dr. Theodore Maiman in 1960 in Malibu at then [[Hughes Research Laboratories|Hughes Research Laboratory]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seattlepi.com/local/6420AP_WA_Obit_Maiman.html Dr. Maiman's laser, the world's first] from seattlepi.nwsource.com&lt;/ref&gt; (now known as HRL Laboratories LLC). In the 1990s HRL Laboratories developed the FastScat computer code,&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrl.com/media/anlRprts/05_AR.pdf HRL's FastScat] from the HRL Laboratories website&lt;/ref&gt; for frequency domain algorithms and implementation, recognized as perhaps the most accurate code in the world for radar cross-section calculations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} [[TRW]] built a laboratory in Solstice Canyon without any structural steel to test magnetic detectors for satellites and medical devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Historic Buildings in Solstice Canyon Are Burned: Park Is Closed: Matthew Keller House and TRW Aerospace Research Buildings Destroyed by Corral Fire|title=Malibu Surfside News|first= ANNE |last=SOBLE|date=November 29, 2007|url=http://www.malibusurfsidenews.com/stories/200711/20071129001.html|accessdate=December 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Incorporation''': in 1991 most of the old Malibu land grant was incorporated as a city to allow local control of the area (as cities, unlike townships, are not subject to the same level of county government oversight). Prior to achieving municipal status, the local residents had fought several county-proposed developments, including an offshore [[freeway]], a [[nuclear power plant]], and several plans to replace septic tanks with [[sanitary sewer|sewer]] lines. The incorporation drive gained impetus in 1986, when the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors approved plans for a regional sewer that would have been large enough to serve 400,000 people in the western Santa Monica Mountains. Residents were incensed that they would be assessed taxes and fees to pay for the oversized sewer project, and feared that the already-capacity Pacific Coast Highway would need to be widened into a freeway to accommodate growth that they did not want. The Supervisors fought the incorporation drive and prevented the residents from voting, a decision that was overturned in courts.

The city councils that were elected in the 1990s were unable to write a Local Coastal Plan (LCP) that preserved enough public access to satisfy the California Coastal Commission, as required by the California Coastal Act. The state Legislature eventually passed a Malibu-specific law that allowed the Coastal Commission to write an LCP for Malibu, thus neutering the city's ability to control many aspects of land use. Because of the failure to adequately address sewage disposal problems in the heart of the city, the local water board ordered Malibu in November 2009 to build a sewage plant for the Civic Center area. The city council has objected to that solution.

== Geography ==
[[Image:Paradise cove.JPG|thumb|250px|The Paradise Cove pier in Malibu]]
Malibu is located at {{Coord|34|1|50|N|118|46|43|W|region:US-CA_type:landmark_source:GNIS|name=Malibu, California (GNIS point)}} (34.030450, â118.778612).{{GR|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|19.8|sqmi|km2}}, over 99% of it land.

Malibu's dry brush and steep clay slopes make it susceptible to fires, floods, and mudslides. Poor grading practices and over-irrigation or leaking pipes exacerbate the tendency for landslides.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Carbon Beach, Paradise Cove, Escondido Beach, Surfrider Beach, Broad Beach, Pirate's Cove, Westward Beach, Zuma Beach, and Trancas are places along the coast in Malibu. Point Dume forms the northern end of the [[Santa Monica Bay]], and Point Dume Headlands Park affords a vista of stretching to the [[Palos Verdes Peninsula]] and [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]]. Directly below the park, on the western side of the point, is Pirates Cove, named for rum-runners during [[Prohibition in the United States|Prohibition]] who liked the secluded beach for offloading their cargo.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Because of its relative seclusion, Pirate's Cove was previously used as a [[nude beach]], but because nudity is now illegal on all [[Los Angeles County]] beaches, nude sunbathers are subject to fines and/or arrest. On the eastern side of the point is &quot;Little Dume&quot;, a surf spot which is accessible only by an unmarked trail below Wildlife Drive which has a locked gate.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}  Surfers often paddle out from Paradise Cove to the area when the waves are breaking.

Like all California beaches, Malibu beaches are technically public land below the mean high tide line. Many large public beaches (Zuma Beach, Surfrider Beach) are easy to access, but such access is sometimes limited in some of the smaller and more remote beaches. Some Malibu beaches are private, such as Paradise Cove, which charges an entrance fee to keep the crowds at bay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ruba.com/place/Paradise_Cove_Beach-anon Review of Paradise Cove] Retrieved November 5, 2009. {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although access to most all Malibu beaches can be obtained after a bit of a walk, the issue of expanded public access is continuously addressed and debated by the City. Many Malibu homeowners{{Who|date=July 2009}} favor limited public access expansions to some beaches, claiming that many visitors are less likely than residents to respect the beaches or private property.

==Natural disasters==

Malibu lies on the fringe of an extensive [[chaparral]] wilderness area, the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nps.gov/samo Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area] from the [[National Park Service]] website&lt;/ref&gt; Various environmental elements collectively create a recipe for natural disasters: the mountainous and geologically unstable terrain; seasonal rainstorms that result in dense vegetation growth; seasonal dry [[Santa Ana winds]]; and a naturally dry topography and climate.

===Mudslides===
One of the most problematic side-effects of the fires that periodically rage through Malibu is the destruction of vegetation, which normally provides some degree of topographical stability to the loosely packed shale and sandstone hills during periods of heavy precipitation. Rainstorms following large wildfires can thus cause a phenomenon known as mudslides, in which water-saturated earth and rock moves quickly down mountainsides, or entire slices of mountainside abruptly detach and fall downward.

After the 1993 wildfire stripped the surrounding mountains of their earth-hugging [[chaparral]], torrential rainstorms in early 1994 caused a massive mudslide near Las Flores Canyon that closed down the main coastal transport artery, Pacific Coast Highway, for months. Thousands of tons of mud, rocks, and water rained down on the Pacific Coast Highway like it was a sluicebox. The destruction to property and infrastructure was exacerbated by the narrow constriction of the road at that point, with beachside houses buttressing the highway with little or no frontage land acting as a buffer to the mudslide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/research/qr/qr107.html Mudslides in Malibu, etc.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Another large mudslide occurred on Malibu Canyon Road, between the Pepperdine University campus and HRL Laboratories LLC, closing down Malibu Canyon for two months.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wrh.noaa.gov/sgx/document/weatherhistory.pdf Malibu Mudslides] from noaa.gov&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet another behemoth slide occurred on another main canyon road, Kanan-Dume Road about one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) up the canyon from the Pacific Coast Highway. This last road closure lasted over a period of many months, with Kanan finally fixed by the California Department of Transportation (Cal-Trans)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dot.ca.gov/ Cal-Trans official web site]&lt;/ref&gt; over a year after the road collapse.

Mudslides can and do happen at any time in Malibu, whether or not there has been a recent fire or rainstorm. Pacific Coast Highway, Kanan-Dume Road, and Malibu Canyon road (as well as many other local roads) have all been subject to many subsequent mudslide-related closures.  During any period of prolonged or intense rain, Caltrans snowplows will patrol most canyon roads in the area, clearing mud, rocks, and other fallen debris from the roadways.  Such efforts keep most roads passable, but it is nevertheless common for one or more of the major avenues in and out of Malibu to be temporarily shut down during the rainy season.

===Storms===
Malibu is periodically subjected to intense coastal storms, although its Mediterranean climate means that such occurrences are relatively infrequent.

Friday, January 25, 2008, during a storm which was unusually large for the Southern California area, a tornado came ashore and struck a naval base's hangar, ripping off the roof. It was the first tornado to strike Malibu's shoreline in recorded history.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

===Earthquakes===
Malibu lies fairly close to the [[San Andreas Fault]], and is subject to the same regional geological unrest as the rest of the Los Angeles Basin.

==Government and infrastructure==
===Local government===
Malibu is a general law city governed with a five-member City Council including the mayor and mayor pro tem. The City Council hires a city manager to carry out policies and serve as executive officer. Every even-numbered year either two or three members are elected by the people to serve a four-year term. Usually, the City Council meets in April and chooses one of its members as mayor and one as mayor-pro-tem. In 2006, this pattern was deviated from when the council decided to have a cycle of three mayors and mayor pro-tems in the coming two years.

=== Malibu Bluffs Community Park and Malibu Bluffs Recreation Area ===

The former '''Malibu Bluffs State Park''' ownership changed hands in 2006 after the California Department of Parks and Recreation transferred the park's {{convert|93|acre|m2}} control to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://smmc.ca.gov/ Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy website]&lt;/ref&gt; They established the '''Malibu Bluffs Recreation Area''', an Open Space Preserve of {{convert|90|acre|m2}} on the bluffs between the Pacific Coast Highway and Malibu Road, directly opposite Pepperdine University and Malibu Canyon Road.  The {{convert|100|ft|m|adj=on}} bluffs rise above Amarillo Beach and Puerco Beach across Malibu Road. Five public stairways (which adjoin private property) lead down to the shoreline from the base of the bluffs. The trails begin from the spacious lawns in Malibu Bluffs Community Park

For over 20 years, the State Parks had tried to kick out Malibu Little League's baseball diamonds and tall baseball fences, with the intention of returning the land to its native wetlands and vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibutimes.com/articles/2006/09/21/news/news3.txt Bluffs Park under local control] from the ''Malibu Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  A rider to a California state law was written specifically in the 1950s to allow baseball, with its attendant field accoutrements, to continue being played in the state park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibutimes.com/articles/2005/01/27/news/news2.txt 20-yr conflict over Malibu Bluffs Park] from the ''Malibu Times''&lt;/ref&gt;  Several generations of Malibuites worked to keep Malibu Bluffs Park for baseball and soccer.

=== Malibu Legacy Park Project ===
Adjacent to the [[Malibu Country Mart]] was a vacant, {{convert|20|acre|m2|sing=on}} plot of land owned by billionaire [[Jerry Perenchio]] and sold to the City of Malibu in 2005 with strict deed restrictions prohibiting any further commercial use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibucomplete.com/mc_people_wealthy_perenchio.php Malibu'S Wealthy: A.

This site is now home to Malibu Legacy Park, an ongoing restoration project undertaken by the City, with broad community support. The City hopes that a state-of-the-art water treatment plant already built will use stormwater runoff that accumulates in the park, making it into an environmental cleaning machine that will end the City's stormwater pollution contribution to Malibu Creek, Malibu Lagoon, and the world-famous Surfrider Beach.  The Malibu Legacy Park Project responds to critical issues: (1) bacteria reduction by stormwater treatment, (2) nutrient reduction in wastewater management, (3) restoration and development of riparian habitats, and (4) the development of an open space area for passive recreation and environmental education. In addition, the Project will be linked by a âlinear parkâ to neighboring Surfrider Beach, Malibu Pier, Malibu Lagoon, and Malibu Bluffs Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annenbergfoundation.org/news/news_show.htm?doc_id=635503 Annenberg Foundation | News | City of Malibu Announces $2 Million Matching Grant from the Annenberg Foundation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is located east of Webb Way, and between Civic Center Way on the north and PCH to the south. It was the site of the annual Labor Day Weekend Kiwanis Club Chili Cook-Off from 1982â2009 (the fair will be moved to nearby streets and parking lots in 2010,  the city says). Further back, it was agricultural land, planted in geraniums, other flowers and vegetables by the Takahashi family since 1924.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.malibucomplete.com/mc_history_malibucity_chilicookoffland.php Malibu Chili Cook-Off Land Purchase&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of now, &quot;Legacy Park&quot; stands in the lot adjacent to the Malibu Public Library, many citizens of Malibu feel the project was a large waste of money because the park does not contain grass areas, only many walkways and plants.
