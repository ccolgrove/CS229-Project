==History==
{{Main|History of the University of Texas at Austin}}

===Establishment===
The first mention of a public university in [[Texas]] can be traced to the 1827 constitution for the [[Mexico|Mexican]] state of [[Coahuila y Tejas]]. Although an article promised to establish public education in the arts and sciences, no action was taken by the Mexican government. But after Texas obtained its [[Texas Declaration of Independence|independence]] from Mexico in 1836, the Congress of Texas adopted the [[Constitution of the Republic of Texas|Constitution of the Republic]], which included a provision to establish public education in the [[Republic of Texas|republic]], including two universities or colleges. On January 26, 1839, the Congress of Texas agreed to eventually set aside fifty [[league (unit)|league]]s of land towards the effort; in addition, {{convert|40|acre|m2}} in the new capital of Austin were reserved and designated &quot;College Hill.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/UU/kcu9.html |title=University of Texas at Austin |accessdate=2009-05-02 |publisher=The Handbook of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, Texas was [[Texas Annexation|annexed]] into the [[United States]]. The state legislature passed the Act of 1858, which set aside $100,000 in United States [[bond (finance)|bonds]] towards construction of a university. In addition, the legislature designated land, previously reserved for the encouragement of railroad construction, toward the universities' fifty leagues. However, Texas's [[secession]] from the Union and the [[American Civil War]] prevented further action on these plans.
[[Image:Oldmainbuilding.jpg|right|thumbnail|The university's Old Main Building in 1903]]

After the war, the 1862 [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]] facilitated the creation of what is now [[Texas A&amp;M University]], which was established in 1876 as the Agricultural &amp; Mechanical College of Texas.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHA&quot;/&gt; The [[Texas Constitution|Texas Constitution of 1876]] mandated that the state establish a university &quot;at an early day,&quot; calling for the creation of a &quot;university of the first class,&quot; styled &quot;The University of Texas.&quot; It revoked the endowment of the railroad lands of the Act of 1858 but appropriated {{convert|1000000|acre|km2}} in West Texas. In 1883, another two million were granted, with income from the sale of land and [[grazing rights]] going to The University of Texas and Texas A&amp;M.&lt;ref name=&quot;TSHA&quot;/&gt;

In 1881, Austin was chosen as the site of the main university, and Galveston was designated the location of the medical department. On the original &quot;College Hill,&quot; an official ceremony began construction on what is now referred to as the old Main Building in late 1882. The university opened its doors on September 15, 1883.

===Expansion and growth===
[[Image:UT tower lit entirely in orange.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|The Tower]], completed in 1937, stands 307 ft (94 m) tall and dons [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)#Lighting|different colors of lighting on special occasions.]]]]
The old [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]]-[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic]] [[Main Building (University of Texas at Austin)|Main Building]] served as the central point of the campus's {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}} site, and was used for nearly all purposes. But by the 1930s, discussions arose about the need for new library space, and the Main Building was razed in 1934 over the objections of many students and faculty. The modern-day tower and Main Building were constructed in its place.

In 1910, George Brackenridge donated {{convert|500|acre|km2}} located on the [[Colorado River (Texas)|Colorado River]] to the university . A vote by the regents to move the campus to the donated land was met with outrage, and the land has only been used for auxiliary purposes such as graduate student housing.  Part of the tract was sold in the late-1990s for luxury housing, and there are controversial proposals to sell the remainder of the tract. The [[Brackenridge Field Laboratory]] was established on {{convert|82|acre|m2}} of the land in 1967.

As a result of the controversy, in 1921, the legislature appropriated $1,350,000 for the purchase of land adjacent to the main campus. But expansion was hampered by the constitutional restriction against funding the construction of buildings. With the discovery of [[petroleum|oil]] on university-owned grounds in 1923, the institution was able to put its new wealth towards its general endowment fund. These savings allowed the passing of amendments to make way for bond issues in 1931 and 1947, with the latter expansion necessary from the spike in enrollment following [[World War II]]. The university built 19 permanent structures between 1950 and 1965, when it was given the right of [[eminent domain]]. With this power, the university purchased additional properties surrounding the original {{convert|40|acre|m2}}.

During [[World War II]], University of Texas was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;list-of-v-12&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USN/Admin-Hist/115-8thND/115-8ND-23.html |title=U.S. Naval Administration in World War II |publisher=HyperWar Foundation |last= |first=  |accessdate=September 29, 2011 |date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent history===
On August 1, 1966, Texas student [[Charles Whitman]] barricaded the observation deck in the tower of the Main Building. With two rifles, a [[sawed-off shotgun]] and various other weapons, he killed 10 people on campus from the observation deck, below the clocks on the tower and three more in the tower, as well as wounding two more inside the observation deck. Whitman had been a patient at the University Health Center, and on March 29, preceding the shootings, had conveyed to psychiatrist Maurice Heatley his feelings of overwhelming hostilities and that he was thinking about &quot;going up on the tower with a deer rifle and start shooting people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://alt.cimedia.com/statesman/specialreports/whitman/heatley.pdf |title=Charles Whitman #8009 |first=M.D. |last=Heatley, M.D. |date=1966-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Whitman event, the observation deck was closed until 1968, and then closed again in 1975 following a series of [[suicide]] jumps during the 1970s. In 1999, after installation of security fencing and other safety precautions, the tower observation deck reopened to the public.


The first [[presidential library]] on a university campus was dedicated on May 22, 1971 with former [[Lyndon B. Johnson|President Johnson]], [[Lady Bird Johnson]] and then-President [[Richard Nixon]] in attendance. Constructed on the eastern side of the main campus, the [[Lyndon Baines Johnson Library and Museum]] is one of 12 presidential libraries administered by the [[National Archives and Records Administration]].

The University of Texas has experienced a wave of new construction recently with several significant buildings. On April 30, 2006, the school opened the [[Blanton Museum of Art]].&lt;ref&gt;The University of Texas at Austin Visitor's Guide, 2008, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, the AT&amp;T Executive Education and Conference Center opened, with the hotel and conference center forming part of a new gateway to the university. Also in 2008, [[Darrell K Royal-Texas Memorial Stadium]] was expanded to a seating capacity of 100,119, making it the largest stadium (by capacity) in the state of Texas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/page2/29657234.html | title= Utility Infielder: Another stadium set for demolition | publisher=San Antonio Express-News | date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the morning of September 28, 2010, 19-year-old Colton Tooley opened fire on campus with a semi-automatic rifle, resulting in a lockdown of the university campus. He then walked into the Perry-CastaÃ±eda Library and committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.statesman.com/blogs/content/shared-gen/blogs/austin/blotter/entries/2010/09/28/police_on_scene_of_shooting_on.html | title=UT campus given all-clear after Tuesday morning shooting  | publisher= The Austin American-Statesman | date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2010-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 19, 2011, the university announced the creation of a 24-hour television network in partnership with [[ESPN]], dubbed the [[Longhorn Network]].  ESPN will pay a $300 million guaranteed rights fee over 20 years to the university and to IMG College, UT Austin's multimedia rights partner.  The network will cover the university's intercollegiate athletics, music, cultural arts and academics programs.  The channel is scheduled to air in September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2011/01/19/espn_tv_network/ | title=ESPN, IMG Introduce TV Network for The University of Texas at Austin  | publisher=The University of Texas at Austin | date=2011-01-19 |accessdate=2011-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Texas has an extensive underground [[tunnel]] system that links all of the buildings on campus. Constructed in the 1930s under the supervision of creator Carl Eckhardt, then head of the physical plant, the tunnels have grown along with the university campus. They currently measure approximately six miles in total length.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytexanonline.com/top-stories/tunneling-for-truth-the-myth-explained-1.1775531 Tunneling for truth: the myth explained] ''The Daily Texan.''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.betterthanyourboyfriend.com/the-secret-tunnels-under-ut.htm The Secret Tunnels Under The University of Texas] ''Better Than Your Boyfriend.''&lt;/ref&gt; The tunnel system is used for communications and utility service. It is closed to the public and is guarded by [[burglar alarm|silent alarms]]. Since the late 1940s the university has generated its own electricity. Today its natural gas cogeneration plant has a capacity of 123 MW. The university also operates a 1.1 megawatt [[TRIGA]] nuclear reactor at the J.J. Pickle Research Campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nuclear&quot;&gt;[http://www.me.utexas.edu/~nuclear/about.htm Nuclear Engineering Teaching Lab] ''Nuclear and Radiation Engineering Program.'.'

In addition, the university has six honors programs that span a variety of academic fields: Liberal Arts Honors, the Business Honors Program, the Turing Scholars Program in Computer Sciences, Engineering Honors, the Dean's Scholars Honors Program in Natural Sciences, and the interdisciplinary Plan II Honors program. The university also offers innovative programs for promoting academic excellence and leadership development such as the [[Freshman Research Initiative]] and [http://www.utexas.edu/tip/ Texas Interdisciplinary Plan]. 

The University of Texas at Austin offers more than 100 undergraduate and 170 graduate degrees. In the 2009-2010 academic year, the university awarded a total of 13,215 degrees: 67.7% [[bachelor's degree]]s, 22.0% [[master's degree]]s, 6.4% [[doctorate|doctoral degree]]s, and 3.9% Professional degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Degrees Conferred Information, 2009-2010 Academic Year | url=http://www.utexas.edu/academic/ima/sites/default/files/SHB10-11Degrees.pdf | format=pdf | publisher=The University of Texas Office of Institutional Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admission===
[[File:Nhb utexas.jpg|left|thumb|The Norman Hackerman Building]]
As a state public university, the University of Texas at Austin was, until recently, subject to [[Texas House Bill 588]], which guarantees graduating Texas high school seniors in the top 10% of their class admission to any public Texas university. A new state law granting UT (but no other state university) a partial exemption from the top 10% rule, Senate Bill 175, was passed by the 81st Legislature in 2009. It modifies this admissions policy by limiting automatically admitted freshmen to 75% of the entering in-state freshman class, starting in 2011.  The university will admit the top one percent, the top two percent and so forth until the cap is reached; the university expects to automatically admit students in the top 8% of their graduating class for 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The University of Texas at Austin to Automatically Admit Top 8 Percent of High School Graduates for 2011 |url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/09/16/top8_percent/ | accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, students admitted under [[Texas House Bill 588]] are not guaranteed their choice of college or major, but rather only guaranteed admission to the university as a whole. Many colleges, such as the Cockrell School of Engineering, have secondary requirements that must be met for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Admission: Undergraduate Admission | url=http://registrar.utexas.edu/catalogs/gi09-10/ch02/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

For others who go through the traditional application process, selectivity is deemed &quot;more selective&quot; according to the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Carnegie Foundation Classifications of The University of Texas at Austin |url=http://carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&amp;subkey=16431&amp;start=782 |accessdate=2007-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Fall 2009, 31,362 applied and 45.6% were accepted, and of those accepted, 51.0% enrolled.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title=2009-2010 Common Data Set | url=http://www.utexas.edu/academic/ima/sites/default/files/CDS_UT_Austin2009-10%20(Final).pdf |accessdate=2009-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university's freshman retention rate in 2009 was 92.5% and the six-year graduation rate was 81.0%.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt;  The Fall 2011 entering class had an average ACT composite score of 28 and an average SAT composite score of 1844.&lt;ref name=&quot;12th Class Day Fall 2011&quot;/&gt;

===Faculty and research===
[[File:USA harlan j smith telescope TX.jpg|left|thumb|Harlan J. Smith Telescope]]
{{See also|List of University of Texas at Austin faculty}}
In Fall 2009, the school employed 2,770 [[Full-time equivalent|full-time]] faculty members (88.3% of whom hold the terminal degree in their field), with a student-to-faculty ratio of 17.3 to 1.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009-2010 Common Data Set&quot;/&gt;  The university's faculty includes 63 members of the National Academy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top 200 Institutions: National Academy Members |url=http://mup.asu.edu/research_data.html |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; winners of the [[Nobel Prize]], the [[Pulitzer Prize]], the [[National Medal of Science]], the [[National Medal of Technology]], the [[Turing Award]] and other various awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Facts &amp; Rankings, College of Natural Sciences | url=http://cns.utexas.edu/about-the-college/facts-rankings | accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nine Nobel Laureates are or have been affiliated with UT Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Nobel Laureates by University Affiliation | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Prize_laureates_by_university_affiliation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Except for [[MIT]], UT Austin attracts more federal research grants than any American university without a medical school.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas.edu&quot;/&gt;  For the 2009-2010 school year, the university exceeded $640 million in research funding (up from $590 million the previous year)&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas.edu&quot;/&gt; and has earned more than 300 patents since 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=OTC Statistics |url=http://www.otc.utexas.edu/Statistics.jsp | accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  UT Austin houses the Office of Technology Commercialization, a [[technology transfer]] center which serves as the bridge between laboratory research and commercial development.  In 2009, UT Austin created nine new start-up companies to commercialize technology developed at the university and has created 46 start-ups in the past seven years.  UT Austin license agreements generated $10.9 million in revenue for the university in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;utexas1&quot;/&gt;

Research at UT Austin is largely focused in the engineering and physical sciences,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Top American Research Universities 2009 | url=http://mup.asu.edu/research2009.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is a world-leading research institution in fields such as computer science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The 20 Most-Cited Institutions in Computer Science, 1998-2008 | url=http://sciencewatch.com/inter/ins/08/08octTOP20COM/ | accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Energy is a major research thrust of the university, with major federally funded projects on biofuels,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=University of Texas at Austin biologists, engineers in $25 million project to develop jet fuel from algal oil |url=http://www.engr.utexas.edu/news/articles/200905051707/index.cfm | accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; battery and solar cell technology, and geological carbon dioxide storage,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Energy Frontier Research Center (EFRC) Awards | url=http://www.er.doe.gov/bes/EFRC.html | accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.  In 2009, UT founded the Energy Institute, led by former Under Secretary for Science [[Raymond L. Orbach]], to organize and advance multi-disciplinary energy research at the university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Director of New Energy Institute Named At The University of Texas at Austin | url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2009/07/14/orbach_energy_institute/ | accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the university does not have a medical school, it houses medical programs associated with other campuses and allied health professional programs, as well as major research programs in pharmacy, biomedical engineering, and neuroscience and others.  UT Austin opened the $100 million Dell Pediatric Research Institute in 2010 as part of an effort to increase medical research at the university and establish a medical research complex, and associated medical school, in the city of Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Seton, UT lay foundations for Austin medical school |url=http://dpri.utexas.edu/news/seton-ut-lay-foundations-for-austin-medical-school | accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dell Pediatric Research Institute Opens at Mueller, Brings New Focus To Children's Health Research at The University of Texas at Austin |url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2010/04/23/dpri_opening/ | accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UT Austin operates several major auxiliary research centers.  The world's third-largest telescope, the [[Hobby-Eberly Telescope]], and three other large telescopes are part of UT's [[McDonald Observatory]], located {{convert|450|mi|km}} west of Austin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=McDonald Observatory | url=http://www.as.utexas.edu/mcdonald/mcdonald.html | accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hobby-Eberly Telescope | url=http://hetdex.org/hetdex/het.php | accessdate=2010-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university manages nearly {{convert|300|acre|km2}} of biological field laboratories, including the [[Brackenridge Field Laboratory]] in Austin.

Founded in 1946, UT's Applied Research Laboratories at the PRC has been responsible for the development or testing of the vast majority of high-frequency sonar equipment used by the Navy, and in 2007, was granted a research contract by the Navy funded up to $928 million over ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ARL:UT About Us | url=http://www.arlut.utexas.edu/about/index.html | accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The University of Texas at Austin Research Unit Receives Navy Contract That Could Reach $928 Million | url=http://www.utexas.edu/news/2007/09/27/arl/ | accessdate=2009-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Endowment===
{{Main|Permanent University Fund}}
The university has an endowment of $7.2 billion, out of the $16.11 billion (according to 2008 estimates) available to the University of Texas System. This figure reflects the fact that the school has the largest endowment of any public university in the nation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

30% of the university's endowment comes from [[Permanent University Fund]] (PUF), with nearly $15 billion in assets as of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=List of U.S. colleges and universities by endowment | url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_U.S._colleges_and_universities_by_endowment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As required by the Texas Constitution [http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/txconst/sections/cn000700-001800.html], the University of Texas System gets two-thirds of the [[Available University Fund]], the annual distribution of PUF income. A regental policy [http://www.utsystem.edu/OGC/RegentalPolicies/AUFspend.htm] requires that ''at least'' 45 percent of this money go to the university for &quot;program enrichment.&quot; By taking two-thirds and multiplying it by 45 percent, we get 30 percent which is the ''minimum'' amount of AUF income that can be distributed to the school under current policies. The Regents, however, can and do decide to allocate additional amounts to the university. Also, the majority of the University of Texas system share of the AUF is used for its debt service [[bond (finance)|bonds]], some of which were issued for the benefit of the Austin campus [http://www.utsystem.edu/CONT/REPORTS/LARs/AUFLAR-102704.pdf]. One should note that the Regents are free to change the 45 percent minimum of the University of Texas System share going to the Austin campus at any time, although doing so might be difficult politically.&lt;/ref&gt; Proceeds from lands appropriated in 1839 and 1876, as well as oil monies, comprise the majority of PUF. At one time, the PUF was the chief source of income for Texas's two university systems, The University of Texas System and the [[Texas A&amp;M University System]]; today, however, its revenues account for less than 10 percent of the universities' annual budgets. This has challenged the universities to increase sponsored research and private donations. Privately funded endowments contribute over $2 billion to the University's total endowment value.

The university is one of only two public universities in the U.S. that have a triple-A credit rating from all three major credit rating agencies, along with the [[University of Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesdispatch.com/rtd/news/state_regional/article/UVAA04_20090403-223316/248738/ U.Va. poised to issue $300 million in bonds to finance campus construction projects] &amp;ndash; ''[[Richmond Times-Dispatch]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
{{See also|Texas Student Media}}
Students express their opinions in and outside of class through periodicals including ''[[Study Breaks Magazine]]'', ''[[The Daily Texan]]'' (the most award-winning daily college newspaper in the United States),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gicurrent/ch5/ch5g.html|title = Student Publications|accessdate = 2007-08-05|work = University of Texas at Austin |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071017224905/http://utexas.edu/student/registrar/catalogs/gicurrent/ch5/ch5g.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Texas Travesty]]''. Over the airwaves students' voices are heard through [[K09VR]] and [[KVRX]].

The Computer Writing and Research Lab of the university's Department of Rhetoric and Writing also hosts ''the Blogora'', a [[blog]] for &quot;connecting rhetoric, rhetorical methods and theories, and rhetoricians with public life&quot; by the [[Rhetoric Society of America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://rsa.cwrl.utexas.edu/ the Blogora]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has a yearbook. In the 1980s it annually sold 14,000 copies. In 1997 it sold 1,700, an all-time low. Kathy Lawrence, the media adviser at UT Austin, said that yearbook sales declined once the school switched from in-person registration to telephone-based registration. During in-person registrations, the university often asked students to buy student yearbooks. Lawrence said that other factors leading to a decline in yearbook sales at UT Austin included increasing numbers of students and a decline in participation in campus life. As of 2008 about 2,500 copies sell annually. To salvage the yearbook, Lawrence introduced personalized pages. When Lawrence concluded that [[social networking sites]] lead to a decline in yearbook sales, Sarah Viren of the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' said that Lawrence &quot;eventually opted to hold off on the personalized pages.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Viren, Sarah. &quot;[http://www.chron.com/life/article/Yearbooks-vanish-from-Houston-schools-in-Facebook-1610639.php Yearbooks vanish from Houston schools in Facebook era].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.

The University of Texas offers a wide variety of varsity and intramural sports programs. As of 2008, the university's athletics program ranked fifth in the nation among [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] schools, according to the [[National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nacda.cstv.com/ National Association of Collegiate Directors of Athletics]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the breadth of sports offered and the quality of the programs, Texas was selected as &quot;America's Best Sports College&quot; in a 2002 analysis performed by ''[[Sports Illustrated]].''&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/si_online/news/2002/10/01/1_10/ America's Best Sports Colleges] ''[[Sports Illustrated]]''.

The University of Texas has traditionally been considered a [[college football]] powerhouse.&lt;ref name=&quot;Potomac&quot;&gt;{{cite book  | url=http://www.potomacbooksinc.com/Books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=167960 | title=Texas Longhorns Football History A to Z | author=Pennington, Richard | publisher=Potomac Books | accessdate=2007-08-04  | isbn=1934186139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tarheel&quot;&gt;{{cite news |work=DailyTarheel.com | publisher= The Daily Tarheel | author=Fitt, Aaron | url=http://www.dailytarheel.com/media/storage/paper885/news/2002/09/14/Sportsaturday/Its-Not.About.Mack-1349746.shtml?norewrite200606280132&amp;sourcedomain=www.dailytarheel.com | title=It's not about Mack | date=September 14, 2002 | accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BC$&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/04/commentary/column_sportsbiz/sportsbiz/ | title=Texas is the BC$ champ, too - Even before their stunning upset of USC, the Longhorns were big winners where it matters. |work=CNNMoney | publisher=Turner Broadcasting | date=January 5, 2006 | accessdate=2007-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the start of the 2007 season, the Longhorns were ranked third in the all-time list of both total wins and winning percentage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ark State gw&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mackbrown-texasfootball.com/doc_lib/090107_notes.pdf | title=Game notes - Arkansas State | work=MackBrownTexasFootball.com | publisher=University of Texas &amp; Host Interactive | format=PDF | date=September 1, 2007 | accessdate=2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team experienced its greatest success under coach [[Darrell Royal]], winning three national championships in 1963, 1969, and 1970. It won a fourth title under head coach [[Mack Brown]] in 2005 after a 41-38 victory over previously undefeated [[University of Southern California|Southern California]] in the [[2006 Rose Bowl]].

In recent years, the men's [[college basketball|basketball]] team has gained prominence, advancing to the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] Sweet Sixteen in 2002, the Final Four in 2003, the Sweet Sixteen in 2004, and the [[Elite Eight]] in 2006 and 2008.

The University's [[college baseball|baseball]] team is considered to be one of the best in the nation with more trips to the [[College World Series]] (33) than any other school, with wins in 1949, 1950, 1975, 1983, 2002 and 2005.

Additionally, the University's highly successful men's and women's swimming and diving teams lay claim to sixteen NCAA Division I titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texassports.com/index.php?s=&amp;url_channel_id=20&amp;url_article_id=1733&amp;change_well_id=2 TEXAS LONGHORNS Official Athletic Site]&lt;/ref&gt; The swim team was first developed under Coach [[Tex Robertson]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsdhof.org/bio-Tex%20Robertson.html|title=Biography - Tex Robertson|accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the men's team is under the leadership of [[Eddie Reese]], who served as the head men's coach at the [[1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Games]] in [[Athens]] and the [[2008 Summer Olympics|2008 Games]] in [[Beijing]].

===Rivalries===
The Longhorns have a rivalry in all sports with the [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies]]. The two schools have acknowledged the importance of this rivalry by creating the [[State Farm Lone Star Showdown]] series, which encompasses all sports where both schools field a varsity team. The football game played between the two schools is the third longest-running rivalry in the nation and is the longest-running rivalry for both schools. It finished in 2011 with their 118th game. The Longhorns led the &quot;showdown,&quot; 76-37-5. The game was traditionally played on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]] day. Both schools held a rally before the annual football game &amp;mdash; Texas hosted the [[Hex Rally]], and students at Texas A&amp;M hosted the [[Aggie Bonfire#Revival|Aggie Bonfire]] (although it is no longer an officially sanctioned Texas A&amp;M event after the deaths of 12 students in 1999).

The Longhorns also have a long standing football rivalry with the [[Oklahoma Sooners]] and hold a 59-41-5 edge in that series. Since 1932, the teams have played annually at the [[Cotton Bowl (stadium)|Cotton Bowl]] in Dallas, Texas, in the [[Red River Rivalry]] game. The rivalry has grown in recent years, as the winner has gone to the Big 12 Conference championship and BCS National championship games.

Other schools, such as [[Arkansas Razorbacks|University of Arkansas]] and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders|Texas Tech]], also count Texas among their rivals; however, each of these schools also trail Texas by significant margins in overall series records, 56-21-0 and 45-15-0, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.yahoo.com/ncaaf/preview?gid=200610280086 Texas Longhorns/Texas Tech Raiders Preview Saturday, October 28, 2006] ''[http://sports.yahoo.com/ Yahoo!
