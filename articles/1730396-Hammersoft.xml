'''Story:''' The first Illinois men's basketball team to be ranked number one in the polls since [[Lou Henson]]'s &quot;[[1988â89 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Flyin' Illini]]&quot; of 1989. Illinois won the Big Ten Tournament and were the overall number one seed in the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 NCAA Tournament]], eventually losing to the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], the number two overall seed, in the finals, 75â70. This Illinois team tied the NCAA record at that time for most wins in a season with 37 and was undefeated until losing the final game of the regular season at Ohio State by the score of 64â65, on a three pointer by Matt Sylvester in the final seconds of the game.

==Controversy==
{{main|Chief Illiniwek}}[[File:Illiniwek logo.svg|thumb|right|100px|The Chief Illiniwek symbol]]
A symbol/mascot of the University's athletic teams was, from 1926â2007, a Native American figure, Chief Illiniwek, who sparked significant controversy beginning in the 1980s. Critics of the Chief claimed that it was a racist stereotype and a symbol of the oppression to Native Americans that took place in past American history. Supporters claimed that it was inoffensive and a source of pride and reverence to the Native American heritage of Illinois Past Sioux elder, [[Frank Fools Crow]], made and sold an authentic ceremonial costume and headdress to the university; recently, the Oglala Sioux tribe demanded the costume and headdress back from the university, though this move was opposed by one of Fools Crow's descendants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.siouxcityjournal.com/news/state-and-regional/article_922ee216-4d4a-575c-9c78-4eca3d07da2f.html |newspaper=Sioux City Journal |title=U of I says Chief Illiniwek feathers returned; tribe disagrees |publisher=Associated Press |date=22 January 2007 |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University was (and is) deeply divided on this issue; while some of the faculty condemned the symbol, the administration remained supportive of it. The University Board of Trustees announced on February 16, 2007, that the Chief's last public performance would be the final home game of the 2006â2007 Men's Basketball season. The name &quot;Fighting Illini&quot; was retained, as the NCAA rescinded its criticism of the use of the term. The name &quot;Fighting Illini&quot; pre-dates the Chief Illiniwek symbol and was bestowed upon the team in honor of Illinoisans who fought in World War I; the use of the name &quot;Illini&quot; dates to the 19th century.
