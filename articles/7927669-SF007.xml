The three most notable descendants in current use are [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], and [[NetBSD]], which are all derived from [[386BSD]] and [[4.4BSD]]-Lite, by various routes. Both NetBSD and FreeBSD started life in 1993, initially derived from 386BSD, but in 1994 migrating to a 4.4BSD-Lite code base. OpenBSD was [[Fork (software development)|forked]] in 1995 from NetBSD. Other notable derivatives include [[DragonFly BSD]], which was forked from FreeBSD 4.8, and [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] and [[Mac OS X]], with its [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] base including a large amount of code derived from [[FreeBSD]].

Most of the current BSD operating systems are [[open source]] and available for download, free of charge, under the [[BSD License]], the most notable exceptions being Mac OS X and iOS. They also generally use a [[monolithic kernel]] architecture, apart from Mac OS X and DragonFly BSD which feature [[hybrid kernel]]s. The various open source BSD projects generally develop the kernel and [[userland]] programs and libraries together, the source code being managed using a single central source repository.

In the past, BSD was also used as a basis for several proprietary versions of UNIX, such as [[Sun Microsystems|Sun]]'s [[SunOS]], [[Sequent Computer Systems|Sequent]]'s [[Dynix]], [[NeXT]]'s [[NeXTSTEP]], [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]]'s [[Ultrix]] and OSF/1 AXP (now [[Tru64 UNIX]]). Of these, only the last is still currently supported in its original form. Parts of NeXT's software became the foundation for [[Mac OS X]] which, together with iOS, is among the most commercially successful BSD variants in the general market.

==Aims and philosophies==
===DragonFly BSD===
[[DragonFly BSD]] aims to be inherently easy to understand and develop for multi-processor capable infrastructures. Starting with FreeBSD 4.8, the main aim is to radically change the kernel architecture, introducing [[microkernel]]-like [[message passing]] which will enhance scalability and reliability on [[symmetric multiprocessing]] platforms, and also be applicable to [[non-uniform memory access|NUMA]] and [[Cluster (computing)|clustered]] systems. The long-term goal is to provide transparent [[single-system image]] clustering. DragonFly BSD currently supports both the [[IA-32]] platform and the [[x86-64]] (or AMD64) platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;dragonflyfaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===FreeBSD===
[[FreeBSD]] aims to make an operating system usable for any purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year = 1995-2006 | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#FREEBSD-GOALS | title = Chapter 1 Introduction: 1.2. - What is the goal of the FreeBSD Project? | work = Frequently Asked Questions for FreeBSD 4.X, 5.X, and 6.X | publisher = The FreeBSD Documentation Project | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to run a wide variety of applications, be easy to use, contain cutting edge features, and be highly scalable on very high load network servers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/about.html | title = About FreeBSD | accessdate = 2006-10-14 | date = 2006-10-12 | publisher = The FreeBSD Project
}}&lt;/ref&gt; FreeBSD is free and open source, and the project prefers the BSD license. However, they sometimes accept [[non-disclosure agreement]]s (NDAs) and include a limited number of closed-source [[Hardware abstraction layer|HAL]] modules for specific device drivers in their source tree, to support the hardware of companies who do not provide purely open source drivers (such as HALs to program [[software-defined radio]]s so that vendors do not share their proprietary algorithms). To maintain a high level of quality and provide good support for &quot;production quality [[commercial off-the-shelf]] (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end embedded systems&quot;, FreeBSD focuses on a narrow set of architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/articles/committers-guide/archs.html#AEN1248 | title = Support for Multiple Architectures: Statement of General Intent | accessdate = 2006-10-14 | date = Â©1999-2005 | work = Committer's Guide | publisher = The FreeBSD Documentation Project
| quote=The FreeBSD Project targets &quot;production quality commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) workstation, server, and high-end embedded systems&quot;.}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant focus of development over the last five years has been fine-grained locking and [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] scalability. Other recent work includes Common Criteria security functionality, such as mandatory access control and security event audit support.

===NetBSD===
[[NetBSD]] aims to provide a freely redistributable operating system that professionals, hobbyists, and researchers can use in any manner they wish. The main focus is portability, through the use of clear distinctions between machine-dependent and machine-independent code. It runs on a wide variety of 32-bit and 64-bit processor architectures and hardware platforms, and is intended to interoperate well with other operating systems. NetBSD places emphasis on correct design, well-written code, stability, and efficiency. Where practical, close compliance with open API and protocol standards is also aimed for. In June, 2008, the NetBSD Foundation moved to a two clause BSD license, citing changes at UCB and industry applicability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2006-01-08 | url = http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/about.html | title = About the NetBSD Project - What is the NetBSD project? | publisher = The NetBSD Foundation, Inc. | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===OpenBSD===
[[OpenBSD]] aims at security, correctness, and being as free as possible. Security policies include revealing security flaws publicly, known as [[full disclosure]]; thoroughly [[auditing]] code for bugs and security issues; various security features, including the [[W^X]] page protection technology and heavy use of randomization; a &quot;[[secure by default]]&quot; philosophy including disabling all non-essential services and having sane initial settings; and integrated [[cryptography]], originally made easier due to relaxed [[Canadian]] export laws relative to the [[United States]]. Concerning software freedom, OpenBSD prefers the [[BSD license|BSD]] or [[ISC license]], with the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] acceptable only for existing software which is impractical to replace, such as the [[GNU Compiler Collection]]. NDAs are never considered acceptable. This has led to the founding of a number of child projects such as [[OpenSSH]], [[OpenNTPD]], [[OpenCVS]], [[OpenBGPD]], [[PF (firewall)|PF]] and [[Common Address Redundancy Protocol|CARP]] to replace restricted alternatives, and campaigns to persuade hardware vendors to release documentation. In common with its parent, NetBSD, OpenBSD strives to run on a wide variety of hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2005-10-12 | url = http://www.openbsd.org/goals.html | title = OpenBSD Project Goals | publisher = OpenBSD | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PC-BSD===
[[PC-BSD]] aims at user friendliness for the lay-person. [[KDE]] is included by default in version 8, but version 9 will offer KDE, GNOME, XFCE and LXDE during the installation.&lt;ref name=&quot;blog.pcbsd.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.pcbsd.org/2011/03/a-quick-look-at-the-upcoming-pc-bsd-9/ |title=A Quick Look at the Upcoming PC-BSD 9 |first=Kris |last=Moore  |date=March 14, 2011 |work=Official PC-BSD Blog |accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An easy to use software manager that is included, downloads and installs binary packages. Each version of PC-BSD remains directly descended from the same version of [[FreeBSD]]. The FreeBSD community will typically point users looking for an &quot;easy&quot; BSD to the PC-BSD project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2011-04-14 | url = http://forums.freebsd.org/showthread.php?p=131681#post131681 | title = FreeBSD Form Post &quot;Seriously&quot; | publisher = FreeBSD Forums | accessdate = 2011-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popularity==
[[File:Bsd distributions usage.svg|thumb|200px|[[Bar chart]] showing the proportion of users of each [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variant from a BSD usage survey from September 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsdcsurvey&quot;/&gt;]]
In September 2005, the BSD Certification Group, after advertising on a number of mailing lists, surveyed 4,330 BSD users, 3,958 of whom took the survey in English, to assess the relative popularity of the various BSD operating systems. About 77% of respondents used FreeBSD, 33% used OpenBSD, 16% used NetBSD, 2.6% used Dragonfly, and 6.6% used other (potentially non-BSD) systems. Other languages offered were Brazilian and European Portuguese, German, Italian, and Polish. Note that there was no control group or pre-screening of the survey takers. Those who checked &quot;Other&quot; were asked to specify that operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsdcsurvey&quot;&gt;[http://www.bsdcertification.org/ BSD Certification site]; [[PDF]] of [http://www.bsdcertification.org/downloads/pr_20051031_usage_survey_en_en.pdf usage survey results]. Retrieved on 2006-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because survey takers were permitted to select more than one answer, the percentages shown in the graph, which are out of the number survey of participants, add up to greater than 100%. If a survey taker filled in more than one choice for &quot;other&quot;, this is still only counted as one vote for other on this chart.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsdcsurvey&quot; /&gt;

Another attempt to profile worldwide BSD usage is the *BSDstats Project, whose primary goal is to demonstrate to hardware vendors the penetration of BSD and viability of hardware drivers for the operating system. The project collects data monthly from any BSD system administrators willing to participate, and currently records the BSD market share of FreeBSD, OpenBSD, NetBSD, DragonflyBSD, Debian GNU/kFreeBSD, PC-BSD, and MirBSD.&lt;ref name=&quot;bsdstats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.bsdstats.org | title = *BSD Usage Statistics | accessdate = 2006-09-30 | publisher = The *BSD Stats Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[DistroWatch]] website, well known in the Linux community and often used as a rough guide to free operating system popularity, publishes page hits for each of the Linux distributions and other operating systems it covers. As of June 2011, using a data span of the last six months it placed FreeBSD in 15th place with 484 hits per day; PC-BSD in 24th place with 346 hits per day; GhostBSD in 53rd place with 171 hits, OpenBSD in 58th place with 164 hits per day; DragonFly in 62nd place with 142 hits per day; and NetBSD in 100th place with 94 hits per day.&lt;ref name=&quot;Distrowatch Rankings&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 2001-2011 | url = http://distrowatch.com/ | title = DistroWatch.com: Put the fun back into computing. | publisher = DistroWatch.com | accessdate = 2011-06-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The names FreeBSD and OpenBSD are references to software freedom: both in cost and [[open source]].&lt;ref name=&quot;freebsdname&quot;&gt;{{cite web | year = 1995-2006 | url = http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/faq/introduction.html#WHY-CALLED-FREEBSD | title = Chapter 1 Introduction - Why is it called FreeBSD? | work = Frequently Asked Questions for FreeBSD 4.X, 5.X, and 6.X | publisher = The FreeBSD Documentation Project

NetBSD's name is a tribute to the [[Internet]], which brought the original developers together.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | year = 1994-2006 | url = http://www.netbsd.org/Misc/about.html#name | title = About the NetBSD Project - Why the name? | publisher = The NetBSD Foundation | accessdate = 2006-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first BSD mascot was the [[BSD daemon]], named after a common type of [[Unix]] software program, a ''[[daemon (computer software)|daemon]]''. FreeBSD still uses the image, a red cartoon [[daemon (mythology)|daemon]] named Beastie, wielding a pitchfork, as its mascot today. In 2005, after a competition, a stylized version of Beastie's head designed and drawn by Anton Gural was chosen as the FreeBSD logo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://logo-contest.freebsd.org/ FreeBSD Logo Competition]. The FreeBSD Project. Competition ended 2005-06-30. Retrieved on 2006-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The FreeBSD slogan is &quot;The Power to Serve.&quot; 

The NetBSD flag, designed in 2004 by Grant Bisset, is inspired by the original NetBSD logo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Mueller | first = Shawn | year = 1994 | url = http://www.netbsd.org/images/NetBSD-old.jpg | title = Original NetBSD Logo | publisher = The NetBSD Foundation | accessdate = 2006-04-22 | format = [[JPEG]]}} Also see [http://www.netbsd.org/gallery/logos.html NetBSD Logos].&lt;/ref&gt; designed in 1994 by Shawn Mueller, portraying a number of BSD daemons raising a flag on top of a mound of computer equipment. This was based on a [[World War II]] photograph, [[Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima]]. The Board of Directors of The NetBSD Foundation believed this was too complicated, too hard to reproduce and had negative cultural ramifications and was thus not a suitable image for NetBSD in the corporate world. The new, simpler flag design replaced this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NetBSD slogan is &quot;Of course it runs NetBSD&quot;, referring to the operating system's portability.

Originally, OpenBSD used the BSD daemon as a mascot, but later replaced it with [[Puffy (mascot)|Puffy]]. Although Puffy is usually referred to as a [[pufferfish]], the spikes on the cartoon images give him a closer likeness to the [[porcupinefish]]. The logo is a reference to the fish's defensive capabilities and to the [[Blowfish (cipher)|Blowfish]] cryptography algorithm used in OpenBSD. OpenBSD also has a number of slogans including &quot;Secure by default&quot;, which was used in the first OpenBSD song, 'E-railed', and &quot;Free, Functional &amp; Secure&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;puffy39&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.openbsd.org/images/puffy39.jpg | title = OpenBSD 3.9 - Free, Functional &amp; Secure | format = JPEG | publisher = OpenBSD | accessdate = 2006-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has released an original song with every release since 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2006-04-15 | url = http://www.openbsd.org/lyrics.html | title = OpenBSD release song lyrics | publisher = OpenBSD | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DragonFly BSD logo, designed by Joe Angrisano, is a [[dragonfly]] named Fred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dragonflybsd.org/about/images.shtml official DragonFlyBSD artwork]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of unofficial logos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = 2006-03-28 | url = http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://wiki.dragonflybsd.org/index.php/DragonFly_Artwork | title = DFWiki - DragonFly Artwork | publisher = The DragonFlyBSD Project | accessdate = 2006-04-22 }} (This page was noted to be a redirect to the front page of new DragonFly Wiki on 2006-06-17, but most of the old images remain available via the [[Digital time capsule|Wayback Machine]].)&lt;/ref&gt; by various authors also show the dragonfly or stylized versions of it. DragonFly BSD considers itself to be &quot;the logical continuation of the FreeBSD 4.x series.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dragonflybsd.org/about/history.cgi | title = The History of DragonFly | publisher = The DragonFly BSD Project | accessdate = 2006-04-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060414233820/http://www.dragonflybsd.org/about/history.cgi |archivedate = 2006-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; FireflyBSD has a similar logo, a firefly, showing its close relationship to DragonFly BSD. In fact, the FireflyBSD website states that proceeds from sales will go to the development of DragonFly BSD, suggesting that the two may in fact be very closely related.

[[PicoBSD]]'s slogan is &quot;For the little BSD in all of us,&quot; and its logo includes a version of FreeBSD's Beastie as a child,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://people.freebsd.org/~picobsd/images/picobsdbanner.gif  | title = PicoBSD Banner - For the little BSD in all of us | format = [[GIF]] | publisher = The FreeBSD Project | accessdate = 2006-04-22 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060503041952/http://people.freebsd.org/~picobsd/images/picobsdbanner.gif |archivedate = 2006-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing its close connection to FreeBSD, and the minimal amount of code needed to run as a [[Live CD]].

A number of BSD OSes use stylized version of their respective names for logos. This includes Mac OS X, PC-BSD, DesktopBSD, ClosedBSD,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.closedbsd.org/images/logo.jpg | title = ClosedBSD logo

This is intended to emphasize the change from previous versions of [[Mac OS]], which were not based on BSD and had version numbers expressed using [[Arabic numeral]]s. PC-BSD's slogan is &quot;Personal computing, served up BSD style!&quot;, DesktopBSD's &quot;A Step Towards BSD on the Desktop.&quot; MicroBSD's slogan is &quot;The small secure unix like OS.&quot;

[[MirOS]]'s site collects a variety of BSD mascots and [[Tux]], the [[Linux]] mascot, together, illustrating the project's aim of supporting both BSD and Linux kernels. MirOS's slogan is &quot;a wonderful operating system for a world of peace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mirbsd.mirsolutions.de/ | title = MirOS/MirPorts: a wonderful operating system for a world of peace | publisher = MirOS Project | accessdate = 2006-04-22

{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=a1&gt;386BSD, BSD/OS, SunOS, and Ultrix are historic operating systems that are no longer developed. BSDeviant and ekkoBSD do not exist anymore either, although BSDeviant is still available for download (see external links). MicroBSD ended, then started again in 2003, but it does not seem that any progress has been made since then, though the website still exists.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=a2&gt;This article only refers to SunOS through version 4.x. SunOS from release 5.x forward is based on SVR4, and is most commonly referred to as the [[Solaris Operating System]].&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|group=Note|refs=
&lt;ref name=b1&gt;[[Unix File System|UFS]] and [[Unix File System|UFS2]] are descendants of the old [[Berkeley Fast File System|FFS]]. However, many BSD operating systems refer to UFS1 as FFS.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=b2&gt;Operating systems where the GUI is not installed and turned on by default are often bundled with an implementation of the [[X Window System]]. However, installing X is usually optional.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=b3&gt;Most operating systems use proprietary APIs in addition to any supported standards.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=b5&gt;OpenBSD contains support for modules on some architectures. They are used only to add third-party features: extracting existing functions into modules in the same manner as FreeBSD is not possible.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=b6&gt;Unlike FreeBSD, OpenBSD includes the [[X Window System]] as base install sets rather than packages within the [[ports collection]]. It includes some local changes and is managed as part of the OpenBSD source tree.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref name=b7&gt;NetBSD includes either [[X.Org]] or [[XFree86]] (depending on platform) as a base install set and includes some local changes, maintained within the NetBSD source tree.&lt;/ref&gt;
