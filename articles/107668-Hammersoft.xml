== History and culture ==
[[File:Library Pico Rivera.jpg|thumb|left|Pico Rivera Public Library, built in 1961]]
Pico Rivera was founded in 1958, from the merger of the long-standing unincorporated communities of Pico (named for [[PÃ­o Pico]], the last [[Mexico|Mexican]] governor of California) and Rivera. Situated on a rich alluvial plain between the [[Rio Hondo (California)|Rio Hondo]] and the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]], the area was once predominantly agricultural, but at the end of WWII, the fast rising demand for homes lured builders to the attractive terrain.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;  Since the 1950s, it has been both residential as well as industrial.  It had a [[Ford (automobile)|Ford]] plant for many years. Pico Rivera lies below the [[Whittier Narrows]], making it one of the &quot;[[Gateway Cities]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chooselacounty.com/laregions/gateway.html Choose LA County | Los Angeles County Economic Development Corporation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1958, 56 percent of the electorate voted for incorporation. They approved a [[Council-Manager]] form of government, and the name &quot;Pico Rivera&quot; was established for the new city. Five citizens were chosen from a slate of 24 candidates to serve as members of the first City Council and Pico Rivera officially became the 61st city in Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

The north side of the city is home to the [[Pico Rivera Sports Arena]], where concerts and other events are held.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.atomz.com/search/?sp-q=Sports+Arena&amp;sp-a=sp10021921&amp;sp-f=ISO-8859-1&amp;FINDbttn.x=0&amp;FINDbttn.y=0 City of Pico Rivera | YOUR SEARCH RESULTS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parks and recreation===

There are nine parks and playgrounds throughout the city, including Smith Park on [[Rosemead Boulevard]],  Rivera Park on Shade Lane, Pico Park on [[Beverly Boulevard]], Rio Vista Park, and Stream Land Park at the north end of Durfee Road.  The community enjoys more than 120 acres committed to public recreational facilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pico-rivera.org/government/citydepartments/parksandrecreation.html City Of Pico Rivera | City Departments: Parks And Recreation&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; There are 18 athletic fields, two gymnasiums and four community centers, a nine-hole executive golf course, skatepark and aquatic centers.&lt;ref name=&quot;community&quot;&gt;http://www.ci.pico-rivera.ca.us/ourcommunity/commfacilities.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pico Rivera Municipal Golf Course===

In 1965, the Pico Rivera Municipal Golf Course was built for the communal enjoyment of not only its residents and golfers, but also for those in the surrounding communities. The executive nine hole course plays to a par 29 and measures 1504 yards. The practice facilities include two putting greens and a covered driving range. Lighting throughout the Golf Course and Driving Range enables play and practice until 10:00 p.m.&lt;ref name=&quot;community&quot;/&gt;

===Senior Center===

Pico Rivera's Congressional Rep. Grace Napolitano, who helped with the funding, and the city officials launched a newly renovated senior center that includes  high tech computer lab with 16 new computers and a modern dance room.  Funded by  the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and the city's general fund, the $350,000 renovation of the over 20-year-old center &quot;is an example of your tax dollars at work,&quot; Napolitano told a crowd of local officials and residents, who toured the new facility.  Napolitano secured a $198,000 federal grant for the project and the city contributed $157,000 in federal stimulus funds.  The fitness room has 18 exercise machines, a set of free weights and two 40-inch flat screen TVs.  The activity room has a mirrored wall with a ballet bar and a state-of-the-art sound system.  The billiard room, which is a popular part of the senior center, was relocated to larger quarters within the center. It now houses four new pool tables.&lt;ref name=&quot;tribune&quot;/&gt;
The Pico Rivera Center, 9200 Mines Avenue, opens from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. Monday through Thursday and 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. Friday.
