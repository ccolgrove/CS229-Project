'''[[Sailing|Sailing/Yachting]]''' is a [[Olympic sport]] starting from the Games of the 1st [[Olympiad]] ([[Sailing at the 1896 Summer Olympics|1896 Olympics]] in Athens {{GRC}}). With the exception of [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]] and possible [[1916 Summer Olympics|1916]] sailing was always a part of the Olympic program.
The Sailing program of 1932 consisted of a total of four sailing classes (disciplines). For each class races were scheduled from 5â12 August of the coast of [[Los Angeles Harbor]] on the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;The Canadian book: ''Canada's Olympic Sailing Legacy, Paris 1924 â Beijing 2008, By Hugh Drake] and Paul Henderson'', speak of [[Newport Beach]] as venue for the 1932 Olympic Sailing.&lt;/ref&gt;

The venue of the X&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Olympiad sailing event was off the coast of Los Angeles Harbor. For the Star, 6 and 8&amp;nbsp;Metre the races were held on the broad Pacific. For the Snowbird-monotype the course area was near the coast sheltered by the [[San Pedro Breakwater]].
[[File:1932 8&amp;nbsp;Metre Transport.jpg|thumb|left|Transporting a 8&amp;nbsp;Metre to the Olympics.]]
Many of the sailors lived, during the Olympics, near the harbor area. For those who lived in the [[Olympic village]] transport was arranged.

For the Olympics in general and sailing specific, having the Olympics in the USA, in the midst of the [[financial crisis]], was a challenge. The ''safe'' choice of using the Metre classes turned out to be a very expensive one. Transporting the yachts to Los Angeles was hardly possible in the economical climate. The new Olympic Star was hardly used in Europe and not many sailors knew how to handle this difficult keelboat. With a significant effort, by the Southern California Yachting Association, arrangements were made for foreign country to use local Stars, 6 and 8&amp;nbsp;Metres. Thirty Snowbirds were provided by the Olympic Committee but only eleven were needed.

But at the end of the day sailing proved to be strong enough to survive this period in time by showing good sailing and good management of the event. At the next Olympics Sailing was stronger than ever.

For the first time the all [[Olympic sports]] were held in the same period of the year. Sailing was now a complete integrated part of the Olympics.

=== Classes (equipment) ===
At first the [[International 14]] Dinghy was chosen for the monotype races. However this idea was abandoned since this is normally a double handed boat. Finally the Snowbird, a small V-bottom Catboat, was selected for the task. As double handed ''one design'' the Star made her first appearance at the Olympics.

== Remarks ==

* For the first time a consistent point system for all races in all events was used ([[Scoring systems for Sailing at the Summer Olympics#1932 Olympic scoring system|1932 Olympic scoring system]]).
* The [[Olympic creed]] was well spread during this Olympics. Maybe ironic to see that by the next time Los Angeles was the home of the Olympics, it also marked a turning point in the Olympic movement and winning became more and more important.
* In the officiel report is mentioned that the NAVY vessels took nicely care that the course area of the Snowbirds was free of traffic. In the book of Hugh Drake the Canadian Snowbird sailor complains that the huge NAVY vessels created a lot of wind shadow over the course.
* During the US 8&amp;nbsp;Metre trials the team of [[Owen Churchill]] beat the team of his brother in law [[Pierpont Davis]]. During the Olympics a team for the 8&amp;nbsp;Metre could have a reserve for every position. By combining the teams for the Olympics and smart exchange of crewmembers for every race, each crewmember of the trials won a gold medal.

=== Sailors ===
During the Sailing regatta's at the 1932 Summer Olympics among others the following persons were competing in the various classes:
