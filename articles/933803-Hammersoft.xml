'''Castaic, California''', is an [[unincorporated community]] and [[census-designated place]]&lt;ref&gt;{{gnis|2582966}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Los Angeles County, California]], north of Santa Clarita and a few miles from [[Six Flags Magic Mountain]] amusement park. It is approximately 39&amp;nbsp;miles (63&amp;nbsp;km) from the [[downtown Los Angeles]] Civic Center. As of the [[United States 2010 Census|2010 Census]], Castaic had a population of 19,015. The community has a [[ZIP Code]] of 91384 and area code of [[area code 661|661]].

==History==

The origin of the name ''Castaic''  is the [[Chumash people|Chumash]] [[Native Americans of the United States|Native American]] word ''Kashtuk,'' meaning &quot;eyes.&quot; Modern Castaic began in 1915 with the opening of the original [[Ridge Route]], which brought travelers looking for gasoline, water, food and lodging to the community. Some of the earliest businesses started in Castaic are Castaic Brick (founded 1927) and George Dunn's Wayside Dairy (founded 1929). Sam's Place (Sam Parson, proprietor) on the Ridge Route has long since gone and is now a memory. Castaic is a major truck stop along the [[Interstate 5]] freeway.

==Geography==

Castaic covers 7.3 square miles (18.9&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of area and includes the Val Verde and Chiquito Canyon areas.
