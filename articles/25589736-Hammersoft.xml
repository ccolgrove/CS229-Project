== History ==
The Bruin Democrats was founded in the tumultuous 1960s by former UCLA students, Representative [[Henry Waxman]] and Representative [[Howard Berman]]. In the 1970s, the Bruin Democrats, led by current LA City Councilman [[Paul Koretz]] and Representative [[Brad Sherman]], received a charter from the [[Democratic National Committee]] in 1979. The Honorable [[Howard Berman]], Democratic Congressman from the 28th District of California, cites Bruin Democrats as the start of his political career. The Bruin Democrats are proud to have such distinguished alumni, many of whom serve in the US Congress, California State Assembly and Los Angeles City Council. 


The Bruin Democrats have hosted numerous renowned politicians and dignitaries at UCLA. In October 2000, the Bruin Democrats held one of the largest rallies for Democratic presidential candidate [[Al Gore]], and in May 2003 the Bruin Democrats helped host Democratic presidential candidate [[John Kerry]]âs unveiling of his major foreign policy plan. During the [[2008 Presidential Election]], current President [[Barack Obama]], Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]], and former Senator [[John Edwards]] campaigned with the Bruin Democrats on the UCLA campus. 


Throughout the decades, the Bruin Democrats have continued to promote the values of the Democratic Party and youth participation in government.&lt;ref name=&quot; The return of the youth vote&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-me-firstvote5feb05,1,4717838.story|title= The return of the youth vote|last=Song|first=Jason |date=February 5, 2008|publisher=Los Angeles Times|language=English|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has continued to be a visible and prominent group both on the [[UCLA]] campus and throughout the nation, &lt;ref name=&quot;Minnesota senator builds student support for presidential hopeful Bill Bradley &quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-23995766.html|title=Minnesota senator builds student support for presidential hopeful Bill Bradley |coauthors=Cathy Collins &amp; Benjamin Parke|publisher= University Wire |language=English|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/10/28/politics/uwire/main4554595.shtml%20e.g.%20CBS%20News%202008|title=UCLA Students Head To Nevada To Back Barack|last=Jaganathan|first=Neha |date=Oct 27, 2008|publisher=CBS News|language=English|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the club won the 2001 âYoung Democrat Club of the Yearâ at the California Democratic Convention.
