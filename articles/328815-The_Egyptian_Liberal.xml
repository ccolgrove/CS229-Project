<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="328815" ns="0" title="Theistic evolution"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Theistic evolution''' or '''evolutionary creation''' is a concept that asserts that classical religious teachings about [[God]]  are compatible with the modern scientific understanding about biological [[evolution]]. In short, theistic evolutionists believe that [[existence of God|there is a God]], that God is [[Creator deity|the creator]] of the [[matter|material]] universe and (by consequence) all life within, and that biological evolution is simply a [[nature|natural process]] within that creation. Evolution, according to this view, is simply a tool that God employed to develop [[human being|human life]].

Theistic evolution is not a [[scientific theory]], but a particular view about how the science of evolution relates to religious belief and interpretation. Theistic evolution supporters can be seen as one of the groups who reject the [[conflict thesis]] regarding the [[relationship between religion and science]]{{ndash}} that is, they hold that religious teachings about creation and scientific theories of evolution need not contradict. Proponents of this view are sometimes described as Christian [[Darwinism|Darwinists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== Terminology ==
The term was used by [[National Center for Science Education]] executive director [[Eugenie Scott]] to refer to the part of the overall spectrum of beliefs about creation and evolution holding the theological view that God creates through evolution. It covers a wide range of beliefs about the extent of any intervention by God, with some approaching [[deism]] in rejecting continued intervention. Others see intervention at critical intervals in history in a way consistent with scientific explanations of [[speciation]], but with similarities to the ideas of [[Progressive Creationism]] that God created &quot;kinds&quot; of animals sequentially.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncseweb.org/resources/articles/1593_the_creationevolution_continu_12_7_2000.asp The Creation/Evolution Continuum] by [[Eugenie Scott]], December 2000, [[National Center for Science Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Acceptance ==
This view is generally accepted by major [[Christian]] churches, including the [[Catholic Church]], [[Eastern Orthodox]] Church and some [[Mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] denominations; virtually all [[Judaism|Jewish]] denominations; and other religious groups that lack a [[Biblical literalism|literalist]] stance concerning some holy [[scripture]]s. Various biblical literalists have accepted or noted openness to this stance, including theologian [[Benjamin Breckinridge Warfield|B.B. Warfield]] and evangelist [[Billy Graham]].

With this approach toward evolution, scriptural creation stories are typically interpreted as being [[allegory|allegorical]] in nature.
Both Jews and Christians have considered the idea of the [[Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|creation history as an allegory]] (instead of a historical description) long before the development of Darwin's theory. An example in Christianity would be the earlier writings by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), though he later rejected allegory in favor of  literal interpretation.  By this Augustine meant that in Genesis 1 the terms &quot;light&quot;, &quot;day&quot;, and &quot;morning&quot; hold a spiritual, rather than physical, meaning, and that this spiritual morning is just as literal as physical morning.  Augustine recognizes that the creation of a spiritual morning is as much a historical event as the creation of physical light.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSCF3-88Young.html&quot;&gt;[http://www.asa3.org/aSA/PSCF/1988/PSCF3-88Young.html Davis A. Young, &quot;The Contemporary Relevance of Augustine's View of Creation&quot; from ''Perspectives on Science and Christian Faith'' 40.1]&lt;/ref&gt; [In later work, Augustine said: &quot;...there are some who think that only the world was made by God and that everything else is made by the world according to his ordination and command, but that God Himself makes nothing&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, JH (trans) (1982) &quot;St. Augustine. The Literal Meaning of Genesis&quot;, Paulist Press, New York, p171&lt;/ref&gt;]  Three noted Jewish examples are that of the writings of [[Philo of Alexandria]] (1st century),&lt;ref name=&quot;book2.html&quot;&gt;{{wayback|url=http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/yonge/book2.html|title=&quot;Allegorical Interpretation, I&quot; from ''The Works of Philo Judaeus'', translated by C.D. Yonge}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maimonides]] (12th century) and [[Gersonides]] (13th century).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'' 2:17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Jewish philosophy#Jewish Philosophy after Maimonides|Milchamot Hashem]]'' 6:8&lt;/ref&gt;

Theistic evolutionists argue that it is inappropriate to use [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] as a scientific text, since it was written in a pre-scientific age and originally intended for religious instruction; as such, seemingly chronological aspects of the creation accounts should be thought of in terms of a [[Framework interpretation (Genesis)|literary framework]].  Theistic evolutionists may believe that creation is not literally a week long process but a process beginning in the time of Genesis and continuing through all of time, including today.  This view affirms that God created the world and was the primary causation of our being, while scientific changes such as evolution are part of &quot;creatio continua&quot; or continuing creation which is still occurring in the never ending process of creation.  This is one possible way of interpreting biblical scriptures, such as Genesis, that seem to be in opposition to scientific theories, such as evolution.&lt;ref name=Peters&gt;''Can You Believe in God and Evolution'', Ted Peters and Matrinez Hewlett&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
{{Rquote|right|....creationism has come to mean some fundamentalistic, literal, scientific interpretation of Genesis. Judaic-Christian faith is radically creationist, but in a totally different sense. It is rooted in a belief that everything depends upon God, or better, all is a gift from God.|Fr [[George Coyne]], Director, Vatican Observatory, 1978-2006}}
Theistic evolution holds that the theist's acceptance of [[evolutionary biology]] is not fundamentally different from the acceptance of other [[science]]s, such as [[astronomy]] or [[meteorology]]. The latter two are also based on a [[methodology|methodological]] assumption of [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] to study and explain the natural world, without assuming the existence or nonexistence of the [[supernatural]]. In this view, it is held both religiously and scientifically correct to reinterpret ancient religious texts in line with modern-day scientific findings about evolution.  St. Anselm described theology as &quot;Faith seeking understanding&quot;&lt;ref name=Anselm&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and theistic evolutionists believe that this search for understanding extends to scientific understanding.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}  In light of this view, authors writing on the subject, such as Ted Peters and Martinez Hewlett, say that &quot;The best science and our best thinking about God belong together.&quot;&lt;ref name=Peters/&gt; Peters and Hewlett see science as a means of evaluating, understanding, and using to our benefit the intricacies of the world that God has created for us.

==Spectrum of viewpoints==
Many religious organizations accept evolutionary theory, though their related theological interpretations vary. Additionally, individuals or movements within such organizations may not accept evolution, and stances on evolution may have adapted (or evolved) throughout history.

===BahÃ¡'Ã­===
In the [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]], [[`Abdul-BahÃ¡]], the son of the founder of the religion, wrote about the origin of life. A fundamental part of `Abdul-BahÃ¡'s teachings on evolution is the belief that all life came from the [[Common descent|same origin]]: &quot;the origin of all material life is one...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Effendi|1912|p=350}}&lt;/ref&gt; He states that from this sole origin, the complete diversity of life was generated: &quot;Consider the world of created beings, how varied and diverse they are in species, yet with one sole origin&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-BahÃ¡|1912|pp= 51â52}}&lt;/ref&gt; He explains that a slow, gradual process led to the development of complex entities:

:&quot;[T]he growth and development of all beings is gradual; this is the universal divine organization and the natural system. The seed does not at once become a tree; the embryo does not at once become a man; the mineral does not suddenly become a stone. No, they grow and develop gradually and attain the limit of perfection&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|`Abdu'l-BahÃ¡|1908|pp=198â99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{See also|Allegorical interpretations of Genesis|Framework interpretation (Genesis)}}

Evolution contradicts a literalistic interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]]; however, according to Roman [[Catholicism]] and most contemporary [[Protestant]] Churches, [[biblical literalism]] in the creation account is not mandatory. Christians have considered allegorical interpretations of Genesis since long before the development of [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theory of evolution, or [[James Hutton|Hutton]]'s principle of [[Uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]]. A notable example is [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] (4th century), who, on [[theology|theological]] grounds, argued that everything in the universe was created by God in the same instant, and not in six days as a plain reading of Genesis would require.&lt;ref name=&quot;PSCF3-88Young.html&quot;/&gt; Modern theologians such as [[Meredith G. Kline]] and [[Henri Blocher]] have advocated what has become known as the [[literary framework interpretation]] of the days of Genesis.

====Contemporary Christian denominations====
Many [[Christian denomination]]s support or accept theistic evolution. For example, on 12 February 2006, the 197th anniversary of [[Charles Darwin]]'s birth was commemorated by &quot;[[Evolution Sunday]]&quot; where the message that followers of Christ do not have to choose between biblical stories of creation and evolution was taught in classes and sermons at many [[Methodism|Methodist]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopalian]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], [[Congregational church|Congregationalist]], [[United Church of Christ]], [[Baptist]] and community churches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/content/news_syndication/article_060220creationism.shtml Churches urged to challenge Intelligent Design  -20/02/06]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the [[National Council of Churches]] [[USA]] has issued a teaching resource to &quot;assist people of faith who experience no conflict between science and their faith and who embrace science as one way of appreciating the beauty and complexity of
God's creation.&quot; This resource cites the Episcopal Church, according to whom the stories of creation in Genesis &quot;should not be understood as historical and scientific accounts of origins but as proclamations of basic theological truths about creation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncccusa.org/pdfs/evolutionbrochurefinal.html Science, Religion, and the Teaching of Evolution in Public School Science Classes] (pdf), The [[National Council of Churches]] Committee on Public Education and Literacy, [http://www.ncccusa.org/news/060330evolution.html Teaching Evolution], March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The positions of particular denominations are discussed below.

=====Anglicanism=====
[[Anglicanism|Anglicans]] (including the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]], the [[Church of England]] and others) believe that the Bible &quot;contains all things necessary to salvation,&quot; while believing that &quot;science and Christian theology can complement one another in the quest for truth and understanding.&quot; Specifically on the subject of creation/evolution, Anglicans view &quot;Big Bang cosmology&quot; as being &quot;in tune with both the concepts of creation out of nothing and continuous creation.&quot; Their position is clearly set out in the ''Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/19021_58398_ENG_HTM.htm Catechism of Creation Part II: Creation and Science]&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] Dr [[Rowan Williams]] expressed his thought that &quot;creationism is, in a sense, a kind of [[category mistake]], as if the Bible were a theory like other theories. Whatever the biblical account of creation is, it's not a theory alongside theories... My worry is creationism can end up reducing the doctrine of creation rather than enhancing it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/religion/Story/0,,1735404,00.html ''The Guardian'', March 21, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; His view is that creationism should not be taught in schools.

=====United Methodist Church=====
The [[United Methodist Church]] affirms a Creator God and supports the scientific study of creation.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
âWe recognize science as a legitimate interpretation of Godâs natural world. We affirm the validity of the claims of science in describing the natural world and in determining what is scientific. We preclude science from making authoritative claims about theological issues and theology from making authoritative claims about scientific issues. We find that scienceâs descriptions of cosmological, geological, and biological evolution are not in conflict with theology.â &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.umc.org/site/apps/nlnet/content3.aspx?c=lwL4KnN1LtH&amp;b=3082929&amp;ct=6715227]  The Book of Discipline of The United Methodist Church â 2008,  The United Methodist Publishing House.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Church of the Nazarene=====
The [[Church of the Nazarene]], an [[evangelicalism|evangelical]] Christian denomination, sees &quot;knowledge acquired by science and human inquiry equal to that acquired by divine revelation,&quot; and, while the church &quot;'believes in the Biblical account of creation' and holds that God is the sole creator, it allows latitude 'regarding the &quot;how&quot; of creation.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/20657204/site/newsweek/ &quot;Can God Love Darwin, Too?&quot; by Sharon Begley, ''Newsweek'', Sept. 17, 2007 issue]&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Richard G. Colling]], author of ''Random Designer''&lt;ref&gt;''Random Designer: Created from Chaos to Connect with the Creator'', Browning Press, 2004, ISBN 0-9753904-0-6&lt;/ref&gt; and professor at [[Olivet Nazarene University]], received criticism from elements within the denomination in 2007 for his book (published in 2004),&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;/&gt; [[Darrel R. Falk]] of [[Point Loma Nazarene]] published a similar book in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;''Coming to Peace with Science: Bridging the Worlds Between Faith and Biology'', InterVarsity Press, 2004, ISBN 0-8308-2742-0&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Karl Giberson]] of [[Eastern Nazarene]], the first Nazarene scholar to publish with [[Oxford University Press]], has published four books since 1993 on the tensions between science and religion,&lt;ref&gt;''Worlds Apart: The Unholy War between Religion and Science'', Beacon Hill Press, 1993 ISBN 0-8341-1504-2&lt;br /&gt;With [[Donald Yerxa]], ''Species of Origins: America's Search for a Creation Story'', Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc., 2002 ISBN 0-7425-0764-5&lt;br /&gt;With [[Mariano Artigas]], ''The Oracles of Science: Celebrity Scientist Versus God and Religion'', Oxford University Press, 2006 ISBN 0-19-531072-1&lt;/ref&gt; including his most recently published ''Saving Darwin''.&lt;ref name=&quot;msnbc.msn.com&quot;/&gt;

Theologians of note in the denomination whose work on science and religion shows the promise of cooperation include [[Thomas Jay Oord]] (Science of Love, [[The Altruism Reader]]), [[Michael Lodahl]] ([[God of Nature and of Grace]]), and [[Samuel M. Powell]] ([[Participating in God]]).  These theologians see no major problem reconciling theology with the general theory of evolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

The Nazarene ''Manual'', a document crafted to provide Biblical guidance and denominational expression for Church members, states: &quot;The Church of the Nazarene believes in the biblical account of creation (âIn the beginning God created the heavens and the earth . . .ââGenesis 1:1). We oppose any godless interpretation of the origin of the universe and of humankind. However, the church accepts as valid all scientifically verifiable discoveries in geology and other natural phenomena, for we firmly believe that God is the Creator. (Articles I.1., V. 5.1, VII.) (2005)&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.premierstudios.com/nazarene/docs/Manual2005_09.pdf Manual, p.371]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Eastern Orthodox Church=====
The Eastern Orthodox Church is divided in two large categories, which might be labeled as compatibilism and incompatibilism.

On the one hand, compatibilists hold that science and theology are compatible and view them as complementary revelations of God. As God is the source of both his specific revelation of himself in the Christian faith and the source of the general revelation of himself in nature, the findings of science and theology cannot really contradict; the contradictions must be merely apparent and a resolution possible which is faithful to the truth of God's revelation.
Nicozisin (Father George) is a compatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orthodoxresearchinstitute.org/articles/dogmatics/nicozisin_creationism.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, incompatibilists hold that science can be incompatible with faith. They usually argue either that science is philosophically based on a kind of naturalism or that God's specific revelation is infallible and therefore trumps the findings of human reason in the case of any conflict between them. This is often based on a suspicion of human reason to arrive at reliable conclusions in the first place.
Bufeev, S. V, is an incompatibilist.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creatio.orthodoxy.ru/sbornik/sbufeev_whynot_english.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Roman Catholic Church=====
{{Main|Evolution and the Roman Catholic Church}}

The position of the Roman Catholic Church on the theory of evolution has changed over the last two centuries from a large period of no official mention, to a statement of neutrality in the 1950s, to limited guarded acceptance in recent years, rejecting the materialistic and reductionist philosophies behind it, and insisting that the human soul was immediately infused by God, and the reality of a single ancestor (commonly called [[Monogenesis (disambiguation)|monogenism]]) for the human race. The Church does not argue with scientists on matters such as the [[age of the earth]] and the authenticity of the [[fossil record]], seeing such matters as outside its area of expertise. Papal pronouncements, along with commentaries by cardinals, indicate that the Church is aware of the general findings of scientists on the gradual appearance of life. The Church's stance is that the temporal appearance of life has been guided by God, but the Church has thus far declined to define in what way that may be.

The official Church's position remains a focus of controversy and is fairly non-specific, stating only that faith and the origin of man's material body &quot;from pre-existing living matter&quot; are not in conflict, and that the existence of God is required to explain the spiritual component of man's origin.{{Citation needed|date=August 2007}}

===Deism===
{{See also|Deism}}
[[Deism]] is belief in a [[God]] or [[first cause]] based on [[reason]], rather than on [[faith]] or [[revelation]]. Most deists believe that God does not interfere with the world or create [[miracle]]s. Some deists believe that a [[Divine Creator]] initiated a universe in which evolution occurred, by designing the system and the natural laws, although many deists believe that God also created life itself, before allowing it to be subject to evolution. They find it to be undignified and unwieldy for a deity to make constant adjustments rather than letting evolution elegantly adapt organisms to changing environments. Other deists take the stronger position that God ceased to exist after setting in motion the laws of the universe.

One recent convert to deism was philosopher and professor [[Antony Flew]], who became a deist in December 2004. Professor Flew, a former [[atheist]], later argued that recent research into the origins of life supports the theory that some form of intelligence was involved. Whilst accepting subsequent Darwinian evolution, Flew argued that this cannot explain the complexities of the origins of life. He also stated that the investigation of [[DNA]] &quot;has shown, by the almost unbelievable complexity of the arrangements which are needed to produce [life], that intelligence must have been involved&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/atheist_philosopher_041210.html Atheist Philosopher, 81, Now Believes in God | LiveScience&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; though he subsequently retracted this statement in an interview with Joan Bakewell for BBC Radio 4 in March 2005: &quot;What I was converted to was the existence of an [[Aristotelian view of God|Aristotelian God]], and Aristotle's God had no interest in human affairs at all.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/programmes/belief/scripts/antony_flew.html BBC interview, Professor Antony Flew] March 22, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;{{irrel}}&lt;!-- No evidence that Flew is a TE, so how is this paragraph relevant? --&gt;&lt;!-- He accepts evolution, but believes in a deity. --&gt;

===Evolutionary creation===
Evolutionary creation&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ualberta.ca/~dlamoure/3EvoCr.htm Evolutionary creation], [[Denis Lamoureux]]&lt;/ref&gt; (EC, also referred to by some observers as ''evolutionary creationism'') states that the Creator God uses evolution to bring about his plan. [[Eugenie Scott]] states in ''Evolution Vs. Creationism'' that it is a type of evolution rather than creationism, despite its name, and that it is &quot;hardly distinguishable from Theistic Evolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=EvC/&gt;  Scott, citing personal communication with prominent evolutionary creationist [[Denis Lamoureux]], states that &quot;the differences between EC and theistic evolution lie not in science but in theology, with EC being held by more conservative (Evangelical) Christians, who view God as being more actively involved in evolution than do most theistic evolutionists&quot;.&lt;ref name=EvC/&gt;

===Hinduism===
{{See also|Hindu views on evolution}}

Hindu views on evolution include a range of viewpoints in regards to [[evolution]], [[creationism]], and the [[origin of life]] within the traditions of [[Hinduism]]. The accounts of the emergence of life within the universe vary in description, but classically the [[deity]] called [[Brahma]], from a [[Trimurti]] of three deities also including [[Vishnu]] and [[Shiva]], is described as performing the act of 'creation', or more specifically of 'propagating life within the universe' with the other two deities being responsible for 'preservation' and 'destruction' (of the universe) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/hinduism/beliefs/intro_1.shtml |title=Religion &amp; Ethics-Hinduism |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Hindu schools do not treat the scriptural [[Creation myth#Hindu|creation myth]] literally and often the creation stories themselves do not go into specific detail, thus leaving open the possibility of incorporating at least some theories in support of evolution. Some Hindus find support for, or foreshadowing of evolutionary ideas in [[Hindu scriptures|scriptures]], namely the [[Vedas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.well.com/user/jct/science.html | title=Science and spirituality: Any Points of Contact?

====Day and Night of Brahma====
Science writers [[Carl Sagan]] and [[Fritjof Capra]] have pointed out similarities between the latest scientific understanding of the age of the universe, and the Hindu concept of a &quot;day and night of Brahma&quot;, which is much closer to the current known age of the universe than other creation myths. The days and nights of Brahma posit a view of the universe that is divinely created, and is not strictly evolutionary, but an ongoing cycle of birth, death, and rebirth of the universe. According to Sagan:
{{quotation|The Hindu religion is the only one of the world's great faiths dedicated to the idea that the Cosmos itself undergoes an immense, indeed an infinite, number of deaths and rebirths. It is the only religion in which time scales correspond to those of modern scientific cosmology. Its cycles run from our ordinary day and night to a day and night of Brahma, 8.64 billion years long, longer than the age of the Earth or the Sun and about half the time since the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Sagan | first =Carl | authorlink =Carl Sagan | title =[[Cosmos (book)|Cosmos]] | publisher =Ballantine Books | year =1985 | isbn =978-0345331359 }} p. 258.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Capra, in his popular book [[The Tao of Physics]], wrote that:
{{quotation|This idea of a periodically expanding and contracting universe, which involves a scale of time and space of vast proportions, has arisen not only in modern cosmology, but also in ancient Indian mythology. Experiencing the universe as an organic and rhythmically moving cosmos, the Hindus were able to develop evolutionary cosmologies which come very close to our modern scientific models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Capra | first =Fritjof | authorlink =Fritjof Capra | title =[[Tao of Physics]] | publisher =Shambhala | year =1991 | isbn =978-0877735946 }} p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====DaÅÄvatÄras and evolution====
British geneticist and evolutionary biologist, [[J B S Haldane]], observed that the Dasavataras (ten principal avatars of Lord [[Vishnu]]) are a true sequential depiction of the great unfolding of [[evolution]]. The avatars of [[Vishnu]] show an uncanny similarity to the biological theory of evolution of life on earth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/101713&lt;/ref&gt;

Lord Rama, Lord Krishna and Lord Buddha were the seventh, eighth and ninth other avatars of Lord Vishnu. It indicates the physical and mental changes and evolution in the man from its time of appearance.

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic creationism}}
Many Muslims believe in evolutionary creationism, especially among mainstream [[Sunni]] and [[Shi'a]] Muslim communities.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Some literalist Muslims reject origin of species from a common ancestor by evolution as incompatible with the [[Qur'an]]. However, even amongst Muslims who accept evolution, many believe that humanity was a special creation by God. For example, Shaikh Nuh Ha Mim Keller, an American Muslim and specialist in Islamic law has argued in ''Islam and Evolution''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masud.co.uk/ISLAM/nuh/evolve.htm Evolution and Islam&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that a belief in [[macroevolution]] is not incompatible with Islam, as long as it is accepted that &quot;Allah is the Creator of everything&quot; (Qur'an 13:16) and that Allah specifically created humanity (in the person of Adam; Qur'an 38:71-76). Shaikh Keller states in his conclusion however:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;As for claim that man has evolved from a non-human species, this is unbelief (kufr) no matter if we ascribe the process to Allah or to &quot;nature,&quot; because it negates the truth of Adam's special creation that Allah has revealed in the Qur'an. Man is of special origin, attested to not only by revelation, but also by the divine secret within him, the capacity for ma'rifa or knowledge of the Divine that he alone of all things possesses. By his God-given nature, man stands before a door opening onto infinitude that no other creature in the universe can aspire to. Man is something else.&quot;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Judaism===
{{See also|Judaism and evolution}}
In general, three of the four major [[Jewish denominations|denominations]] of American [[Judaism]] ([[Reconstructionist Judaism|Reconstructionist]], [[Reform Judaism|Reform]], and [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative]]) accept theistic evolution. Within [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodoxy]], there is much debate about the issue.  Most [[Modern Orthodox Judaism|Modern Orthodox]] groups accept theistic evolution and most [[Haredi Judaism|Ultra-Orthodox]] groups do not.  This disagreement was most vociferous in the [[Natan Slifkin#Controversy|Natan Slifkin controversy]] which arose when a number of prominent Ultra-Orthodox Rabbis banned books written by Rabbi Natan Slifkin which explored the idea of theistic evolution within Jewish tradition.  These Rabbis forming part of [[Jewish opposition to evolution]] considered that his books were [[heresy]] as they indicated that the [[Talmud]] is not necessarily correct about scientific matters such as the [[age of the Earth]].

Advocates of theistic evolution within Judaism follow two general approaches. Either the [[Genesis creation myth|creation account]] in the [[Torah]] is not to be taken as a literal text, but rather as a [[symbol]]ic work, or, alternatively, that the 'days' do not refer to 24-hour periods (justified by how the first day in the biblical account actually precedes the creation of the sun and earth by which 24 hour days are reckoned). In the latter view, Jewish [[scholars]] point out how the order of creation in Genesis corresponds to the scientific description of the development of life on Earthâthe sun, then earth, then oceans, then oceanic plant life, fish preceding land-based life, with mammals and finally humans lastâand in no way specifies the method of creation in a manner prohibitive of evolution.

==Proponents==
===Evolutionary biologists who were also theists===
Although [[evolutionary biologists]] have often been [[agnostics]] (most notably [[Thomas Huxley]] and [[Charles Darwin]]) or [[Atheism|atheists]] (most notably [[Richard Dawkins]]), from the outset many have had a belief in some form of theism. These have included [[Alfred Russel Wallace]] (1823&amp;ndash;1913), who in a joint paper with [[Charles Darwin]] in 1858, proposed the theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]]. Wallace, in his later years, was effectively a [[deist]] who believed that &quot;the unseen universe of Spirit&quot; had interceded to create life as well as consciousness in animals and (separately) in humans.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} Darwin had a longstanding close friendship with the American botanist [[Asa Gray]] who was a leading supporter of Darwin's theory, and a devout Presbyterian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/religion-historical-resources |title=Historical Resources |year=2009 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray wrote a series of essays on the relationship of natural selection to religious belief and [[natural theology]], and supported the views of theologians who said that design through evolution was inherent in all forms of life.&lt;ref name=Grayreviews&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/essays-reviews-by-asa-gray |title=Essays &amp; reviews by Asa Gray |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;br&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/gray-essay-evolution-theology |title=Essay: Evolution &amp; theology |author=Asa Gray |authorlink=Asa Gray |date=January 15, 1874 |work= Darwin Correspondence Project |publisher=The Nation |pages= |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin had Gray and [[Charles Kingsley]] in mind when he wrote that &quot;It seems to me absurd to doubt that a man may be an ardent theist &amp; an evolutionist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-12041 |title=Letter 12041 â Darwin, C. R. to Fordyce, John, 7 May 1879 |publisher=Darwin Correspondence Project |accessdate=2009-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early example of this kind of approach came from computing pioneer [[Charles Babbage]] who published his unofficial ''Ninth [[Bridgewater Treatise]]'' in 1837, putting forward the thesis that God had the omnipotence and foresight to create as a divine legislator, making laws (or programs) which then produced species at the appropriate times, rather than continually interfering with ''ad hoc'' miracles each time a new species was required.

[[Pierre Teilhard de Chardin]] (1881&amp;ndash;1955) was a noted geologist and paleontologist as well as a [[Jesuit]] Priest who wrote extensively on the subject of incorporating evolution into a new understanding of Christianity. Initially suppressed by the [[Roman Catholic Church]], his theological work has had considerable influence and is widely taught in Catholic and most [[mainline (Protestant)|mainline Protestant]] seminaries.

Both [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890&amp;ndash;1962) and [[Theodosius Dobzhansky]] (1900&amp;ndash;1975), were Christians and architects of the [[modern evolutionary synthesis]]. Dobzhansky, a Russian Orthodox, wrote a famous 1973 essay entitled ''[[Nothing in Biology Makes Sense Except in the Light of Evolution]]'' espousing evolutionary creationism:

:&quot;I am a creationist and an evolutionist. Evolution is God's, or Nature's, method of creation. Creation is not an event that happened in 4004 BC; it is a process that began some 10 billion years ago and is still under way... Does the evolutionary doctrine clash with religious faith? It does not. It is a blunder to mistake the Holy Scriptures for elementary textbooks of astronomy, geology, biology, and anthropology. Only if symbols are construed to mean what they are not intended to mean can there arise imaginary, insoluble conflicts... the blunder leads to blasphemy: the Creator is accused of systematic deceitfulness.&quot;

In the realm of biology and theology, the saying coined by [[Thomas Jay Oord]] is perhaps appropriate: &quot;The Bible tells us how to find abundant life, not the details of how life became abundant.&quot;

==Criticism==
The major criticism of theistic evolution by non-theistic evolutionists focuses on its essential belief in a [[supernatural]] [[Creator deity|creator]]. These proponents argue that by the application of [[Occam's razor]], sufficient explanation of the phenomena of evolution is provided by the processes of evolution, such as ''natural'' selection, and the intervention or direction of a ''super''natural entity is not required, simply adding another variable or assumption to the theory of evolution.  Evolutionary biologist and prominent atheist [[Richard Dawkins]] considers theistic evolution as a superfluous attempt to &quot;smuggle God in by the back door&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers(2006) p374&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationists]] criticise theistic evolution on theological grounds, finding it hard to reconcile the nature of a loving God with the process of evolution, in particular, the existence of death and suffering before the [[Fall of Man]]. They consider that it undermines central biblical teachings by regarding the creation account as a myth, a parable, or an allegory, instead of believing that it is historical. They also fear that a capitulation to what they call &quot;[[Atheism|atheistic]]&quot; [[naturalism (philosophy)|naturalism]] will confine [[God of the gaps|God to the gaps]] in scientific explanations, undermining biblical doctrines, such as God's [[Incarnation (Christianity)|incarnation]] through Christ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answersingenesis.org/creation/v17/i4/theistic_evolution.asp answersingenesis.org: ''10 dangers of theistic evolution'']&lt;/ref&gt;
