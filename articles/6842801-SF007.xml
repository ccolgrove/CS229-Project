The '''Affero General Public License''', often abbreviated as '''Affero GPL''' and '''AGPL''' (and sometimes informally called the '''Affero License'''), refers to two distinct, though historically related, [[free software licenses]]:

Both versions of the AGPL were designed to close a perceived [[application service provider]] &quot;loophole&quot; (the &quot;ASP loophole&quot;) in the ordinary GPL, where by using but not distributing the software, the [[copyleft]] provisions are not triggered. Each version differs from the version of the GNU GPL on which it is based in having an additional provision addressing use of software over a [[Computer networking|computer network]].   The additional provision requires that the complete source code be made available to any network user of the AGPL-licensed work, typically a [[Web application]].

The [[Free Software Foundation]] has recommended that the GNU AGPLv3 be considered for any software that will commonly be run over a network.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot;&gt;[http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/index_html List of free-software licences on the FSF website]: â''We recommend that developers consider using the GNU AGPL for any software which will commonly be run over a network''â.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Open Source Initiative]] approved the GNU AGPLv3&lt;ref name=&quot;osi&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical|title=OSI approved licenses}}&lt;/ref&gt; as an [[open source]] license in March 2008 after [[Funambol]] submitted it for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.funambol.com/news/pressrelease_2008.3.13.php|title=Funambol Helps New AGPLv3 Open Source License Gain Formal OSI Approval}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, while developing an e-learning and e-service business model, [[Henry Poole (technologist)|Henry Poole]] met with [[Richard Stallman]] in Amsterdam where they discussed the [[Application service provider|ASP]] loophole in GPLv2. Over the following months, Stallman and Poole discussed approaches to solving the problem. In 2001, Poole founded [[Affero]], Inc. (a web services business), and he needed a license that would require distribution by other organizations who used Affero code to create derivative web services. At that time, Poole contacted [[Bradley M. Kuhn]] and [[Eben Moglen]] of the [[Free Software Foundation]] to get advice on a new license that would close the ASP loophole in GPLv2.

Around late February 2002, Kuhn suggested, based on the idea of a program that prints its own source code, that GPLv2 be supplemented with a section 2(d) that would require derivative works to maintain a &quot;download source&quot; feature that would provide complete and corresponding source code.  Kuhn argued that there was precedent for such a requirement in GPLv2 section 2(c),  which required preservation of certain features by downstream distributors and modifiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stet_and_AGPLV3&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Moglen and Kuhn wrote the text of the proposed new section 2(d), and provided it to Poole, who then requested and received permission from the FSF to publish a derivative of GPLv2 for this purpose. In March 2002, Affero, Inc. published the original Affero General Public License (AGPLv1) for use with the Affero project and made the new license available for use by other [[software-as-a-service]] developers.

The FSF contemplated including the special provision of AGPLv1 into GPLv3 but ultimately decided to publish a separate license, nearly identical to GPLv3 but containing a provision similar in purpose and effect to section 2(d) of AGPLv1.  The new license was dubbed the GNU Affero General Public License, the retention of the Affero name indicating its close historical relationship with AGPLv1.  The GNU AGPL was given version number 3 for parity with the GPL, and the current GNU Affero General Public License is often abbreviated ''AGPLv3''.

The finalized version of AGPLv3&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[stet (software)|Stet]] is the first software system known to be released under AGPLv3 (on November 21, 2007),&lt;ref name=&quot;Stet_and_AGPLV3&quot;/&gt; and is the only known program to be used primarily for the production of its own license.

==Compatibility with the GPL==
Both versions of the AGPL, like the corresponding versions of the GNU GPL on which they are based, are [[Copyleft#Strong and weak copyleft|strong copyleft]] licenses. In the FSF's judgment, the additional requirement in section 2(d) of AGPLv1 made it [[License compatibility|incompatible]] with the otherwise nearly identical GPLv2.  That is to say, one cannot distribute a single work formed by
combining components covered by each license.

By contrast, GPLv3 and AGPLv3 each include clauses (in section 13 of each license) that together achieve a form of mutual compatibility for the two licenses. These clauses explicitly allow the &quot;conveying&quot; of a work formed by linking code licensed under the one license against code licensed under the other license&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html The GNU General Public License - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation (FSF)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;, despite the licenses otherwise not allowing relicensing under the terms of each other.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot; /&gt; In this way, the copyleft of each license is relaxed to allow distribution of such combinations.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsf&quot; /&gt;

To establish an upgrade path from AGPLv1 to the FSF's AGPLv3, [[Affero|Affero, Inc.]] published the [http://www.affero.org/agpl2.html Affero General Public License version 2], which is merely a transitional license that allows recipients of  software licensed under &quot;AGPLv1 or any later version as published by Affero, Inc.&quot; to distribute the software, or derivative works, under AGPLv3.

==Examples of web applications under AGPL==

Some of the best-known examples of AGPL software include the collaborative online word processor [[Co-ment]] (the successor of [[Stet]]), the develop and maintain software [[launchpad]], the distributed social networking services [[Diaspora (software)|Diaspora]] and [[StatusNet]], and the network monitoring application [[Shinken]].
