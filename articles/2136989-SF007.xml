 Caos Linux NSA-1.0.8 release is now available!&lt;/ref&gt;, but as of 2011-05-04, the timestamp of 2009-12-14 on the [http://caos.osuosl.org/Caos-NSA-1.0/install/i386/caos-nsa-1.0.i386.iso main ISO-9660 image] is well over a year old&lt;ref&gt;wget -S - -O /dev/null http://caos.osuosl.org/Caos-NSA-1.0/install/i386/caos-nsa-1.0.i386.iso 2&gt;&amp;1 | grep 'Last-Modified:'&lt;/ref&gt;. Though Infiscale describes its GravityOS as &quot;[including] the small footprint of Caos&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:ARfubxy6lLkJ:www.infiscale.com/html/products.html+http://www.infiscale.com/html/products.html&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us&amp;client=ubuntu&lt;/ref&gt; indicating a level of influence from the seemingly discontinued distribution. The name has been capitalized in various ways: cAos and CAos were used with earlier releases. CAOS and Caos are used on the web site's main pages.

CAOS Linux combines aspects of [[Debian]], [[Red Hat Linux]]/[[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], and [[FreeBSD]] in a manner that aspires to be stable enough for [[Server (computing)|server]]s and [[Computer cluster|cluster]]s, for a [[Product lifecycle (marketing)|life cycle]] of 3 to 5 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.caoslinux.org/features.html&lt;/ref&gt; The CAOS Project is part of a larger organization (The CAOS Foundation) which is a team of open source developers working and using resources together.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}
