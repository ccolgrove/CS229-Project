'''Ford Motor Company of Canada, Limited''' ([[Canadian French|French]]: ''Ford du Canada LimitÃ©e'') was founded in 1904 for the purpose of manufacturing and selling Ford automobiles in [[Canada]] and the [[British Empire]]. The [[Ford Motor Company]] in Detroit transferred the patent and selling rights to the Walkerville Wagon Company, in order to avoid the tariff rates for non-British Empire countries. The Company was originally known as the Walkerville Wagon Works, and was located in Walkerville, Ontario (now incorporated within [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], [[Ontario]]). The Company President Gordon McGregor convinced a group of investors to invest in [[Henry Ford]]'s new automobile, which was being produced across the river in Detroit.

On August 17, 1904, the Ford Motor Company was founded in [[Walkerville, Ontario]]. The Company had gained all Ford patent rights and selling privileges to all parts of the British Empire, except [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain and Ireland]]. The Model C, the first car to be produced in Canada, rolled out of the factory in late September 1904. The Company could produce two cars at a time and in its first full year of production, the Company was able to produce 117 automobiles. The Company's first export sales were to [[Calcutta]], [[India]]. The Company is still an important manufacturing enterprise in Windsor.

With the growth in car sales after [[World War II]], Ford of Canada decided to move its head office and build a new assembly plant in [[Oakville, Ontario]]. The new Oakville assembly plant was opened in 1953. In order to meet ever increasing demand, the Company opened another assembly plant in [[Talbotville, Ontario]] in 1967.

Historically Ford was one of most powerful companies in Canada, and in the 1970s, Ford was the &quot;largest&quot; company in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.uwo.ca/business/200TopCompanies.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ford of Canada celebrated its Centennial in 2004, shortly after the Parent Company [[Ford]] in the [[United States]] did in 2003.

In 2010, Ford was embroiled in a controversy surrounding a plan to construct a massive gas-fired power plant to be operated by [[TransCanada]] on a disused {{convert|13.5|acre|m2|adj=on}} portion of its Oakville assembly plant.  Local residents and politicians have pleaded with Ford not to continue with the plan, which is believed by many to threaten the health and safety of local residents.  With the recent [[2010 Connecticut power plant explosion|catastrophic explosion]] at a gas-fired power plant in [[Middletown, Connecticut]], and the [[2008 Toronto propane explosion]], many{{Who|date=November 2010}} believe that a buffer zone for such plants is required and that the Ford site is inappropriate due to its close proximity to homes and schools.

Current CEO and President of Ford Motor Company of Canada is [[David Mondragon]], effective September 1, 2008, replacing [[Barry Engle]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiandriver.com/thenews/2008/08/25/ford-of-canada-names-new-president.htm |title=General News Â» Ford of Canada names new president |publisher=CanadianDriver |date=2008-09-01 |accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; who resigned to join [[New Holland Ag|New Holland America]] as its CEO.  [[William H. Osborne]] had held the position since 2005 and was replaced by Engle in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auto123.com/en/news/car-news/barry-engle-the-new-president-of-ford-motor-company-of-canada-video?artid=94746 |title=Barry Engle, the new President of Ford Motor Company of Canada (video) - Car News &amp;#124; Page 1 |publisher=Auto123 |date= |accessdate=2009-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The firm both sells automobiles in [[Canada]], and manufactures [[automobiles]], for sale in [[Canada]] and other countries.
