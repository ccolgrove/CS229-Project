'''St Michael &amp; All Angels Church''' is a [[Church of England]] church in the village of [[Wood End, Atherstone|Wood End]], [[Warwickshire]], England. Built in 1906, this small wooden church is part of the parish of Baxterley with Hurley and Wood End

==History==
The Church was built in 1906 for the village of Wood End which had been built in 1890. When the church was built it was on its own until it was surrounded by prefabricated housing which was re built during the 1980s.

The church has no distinctive features and has just a small hall.

==Today==
The church is part of the [[Diocese of Birmingham]], the archdeaconry of Aston, The Deanery of [[Polesworth]] and is in the parish of [[Baxterley Church|Baxterley]] with [[Church of the Resurrection, Hurley|Hurley]] and Wood End. 

It is part of the Kingsbury and Baxterley group of churches along with [[Baxterley Church|Baxterley]], [[Church of St Peter &amp; St Paul, Kingsbury|Kingsbury]], [[St. Mary The Church of Our Lady Merevale|Merevale]] and [[Church of the Resurrection, Hurley|Hurley]], All five share the same vicar who is currently Revd. Janet Gasper.&lt;ref name=&quot;parishweb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=KingsBaxtGroup.org|url=http://www.kingbaxgroup.org.uk/index.html|publisher=Kingsbury &amp; Baxterley Group of Parish Churches|accessdate=29 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
