The Adventist presence in India began in the early 1890s. Progress was slow. By 1904, there were about 130 Adventists there.&lt;ref name = &quot;Outline&quot; &gt;{{Cite book

At first, converts were of European heritage. There were some among the Indian population. One of them, A. C. Mookerjee. He was the grandson of [[William Carey|William Carey's]] first convert. &lt;ref name = &quot;Spalding3&quot; &gt;{{Cite book

In 1900 the mission director, D. A. Robinson, died from smallpox. [[William A. Spicer]], at thirty-five years old, became the director. He was editor of the Oriental Watchman, the first Adventist periodical to be published in a completely non-Christian land. His leadership of the field was brief. In 1901, while attending the General Conference, Spicer was appointed as the secretary of the Foreign Mission Board located in the United States. [[John Luis Shaw|John L. Shaw]] took over the leadership of the India field. Shaw came from the principalship of the church's South African school at Cape Town. With a few brief absences, he remained in India for twenty-three years.&lt;ref name = &quot;Spalding3&quot; /&gt;

The first of the Seventh-day Adventist Mission Quarterlies focused on the need for evangelism in India's major cities.Many people of India, still under British rule, spoke English. The 1912 Quarterly included a thrice repeated appeal from Shaw. He emphasized the need for missionaries who could preach in English.&lt;ref name = &quot;Quarterly&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

In 1912, five Adventist missions formed the organization of the India field: North India, West India, South India, Bengal and Burma. (See the map to the right.)
