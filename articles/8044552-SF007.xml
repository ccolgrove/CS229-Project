The '''KDE Control Center'''. also known as '''KControl''', is the centralized settings manager for the [[KDE]] [[desktop environment]]. It is part of the [[kdeadmin]] package. It can be considered the KDE counterpart of the [[Windows Control Panel]].

KControl has a modular architecture. The window is split into two parts: the left side displays the list of available modules (also known as applets), and the right side displays the current module. Applications can install their own KControl modules (an example being [[Konqueror]]), although most applications prefer to use their own, independent settings managers.

Although KControl is installed by default in [[Kubuntu]], that distribution uses a non-standard version of it by default, redesigned to resemble the [[Mac OS X]] system settings manager. The &quot;classic&quot; KControl is also available, however. A ported version of the Kubuntu '''[[System Settings]]''' application has also replaced KControl in [[KDE_Software_Compilation_4|KDE SC 4]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KDE 4.0 Alpha 2 Announcement&quot;&gt;KDE 4.0 Alpha 2 Announcement http://dot.kde.org/1183569837/&lt;/ref&gt; Systemsettings has been accepted as &quot;an improved user interface for configuring the desktop and other aspects of the system&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debian package details for systemsettings&quot;&gt;Debian Package Details for Systemsettings http://packages.debian.org/lenny/kde/systemsettings&lt;/ref&gt;
