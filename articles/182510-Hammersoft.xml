The '''Baha Men''' are Bahamian singers in a [[Bahamas|Bahamian]] band. They play a modernised style of Bahamian music called [[Junkanoo]].

==Early career as High Voltage (1980â1991)==
The group was formed in the Bahamas in 1980 as High Voltage. They used to start the genre &quot;Junkanoo&quot; in 1982. In 1991, they changed their name to Baha Men.

==Baha Men==
The group renamed themselves as '''Baha Men''' in 1991, and released their first album under that name, ''[[Junkanoo (album)|Junkanoo]]'', in [[1992 in music|1992]]. The album was very traditional in its sound.

===International success===
In the 1990s they began aiming their music at a more mainstream [[audience]], and achieved great, if short-lived, popularity with [[2000 in music|2000]]'s remake of &quot;[[Who Let the Dogs Out?]]&quot; (originally composed by [[Anslem Douglas]]), recorded with the help of [[Orlando Infante]]. The song was a chart success in many countries, and also became a popular song at US sporting events.

&quot;Who Let the Dogs Out?&quot; also earned the band several awards: a [[Grammy Award]] in 2000 for [[Best Dance Recording]]; [[Billboard Music Award]]s for World Music Artist of the Year and World Music Album of the Year; and a [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Nickelodeon Kids Choice Award]] for Favorite Song. In 2002, they won another Kids' Choice Award for Favorite Band.

===Recent activity===
In June 2008 &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out?&quot; was discussed on  ''[[I Love the New Millennium]]''. The Baha Men's most recent [[record album|album]] was ''[[Holla!]] '', released in [[2004 in music|2004]], but according to their [[MySpace]] page, they are set to release an album in the year 2010 and began a tour in September 2009. Baha Men will launch this tour from Nassau, Bahamas

===Involvement in motion pictures===
The Baha Men were one of the many artists to record a song on the album ''[[DisneyMania]]'' and two of its four sequels. On the first DisneyMania, they recorded &quot;Hakuna Matata&quot; from ''[[The Lion King]]''. On ''[[DisneyMania 2]]'', they recorded the famous song &quot;It's a Small World&quot; from the Disney park attraction of the [[it's a small world|same name]]. They were absent from ''[[DisneyMania 3]]'', though they returned for ''[[DisneyMania 4]]'', recording their take on the song &quot;Hawaiian Roller Coaster Ride&quot; from ''[[Lilo and Stitch]]'' entitled &quot;Bahaman Roller Coaster Ride.&quot; A number of their songs have used in major motion pictures such as: ''[[Rugrats In Paris]]'', ''[[Miss Congeniality (film)|Miss Congeniality]]'', ''[[Rat Race (film)|Rat Race]]'', and ''[[Garfield: The Movie]]''. They also recorded a cover of [[Elton John]]'s hit &quot;[[Crocodile Rock]]&quot; for the film ''[[Crocodile Hunter: Collision Course]]'' starring [[Steve Irwin]] and family. In fact, the band has also made an appearance on the big screen, when they starred as themselves in the 1994 romantic comedy ''[[My Father the Hero (1994 film)|My Father the Hero]]'' starring [[Gerard Depardieu]] and [[Katherine Heigl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popentertainment.com/bahamen.htm |title=Pop Entertainment Baha Men |publisher=Popentertainment.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Baha Men also were featured in the soundtrack of ''[[Shrek]]'' with their hit song &quot;Best Years of Our Lives&quot;. &quot;Who Let the Dogs Out?&quot; was also featured in the 2009 hit comedy ''[[The Hangover (film)|The Hangover]]''.
