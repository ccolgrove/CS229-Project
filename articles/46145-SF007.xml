'''Solaris''' is a [[Unix]] [[operating system]] originally developed by  [[Sun Microsystems]]. It superseded their earlier [[SunOS]] in 1993. '''Oracle Solaris''', as it is now known, has been owned by [[Oracle Corporation]] since Oracle's acquisition of Sun in January 2010.&lt;ref name=completion&gt;{{cite web | url= http://finance.yahoo.com/news/Oracle-Completes-Acquisition-iw-2658323391.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 | publisher= Yahoo | title= Oracle Completes Acquisition of Sun | date= 27 January 2010 | accessdate= 27 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solaris is known for its [[scalability]], especially on [[SPARC]] systems, and for originating many innovative features such as [[DTrace]], [[ZFS]] and Time Slider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Solaris was historically developed as [[proprietary software]], then in June 2005 Sun Microsystems released most of the [[codebase]] under the [[CDDL]] license, and founded the [[OpenSolaris]] [[open source]] project.&lt;ref&gt;

==History ==
&lt;!-- Line breaks make citations easier to maintain, and there's no benefit to removing them; please discuss on talk before &quot;cleaning up white space&quot; --&gt;

In 1987, [[AT&amp;T]] and Sun announced that they were collaborating on a project to merge the most popular Unix variants on the market at that time: [[BSD]], [[System V]], and [[Xenix]]. This became Unix [[System V Release 4]] (SVR4).&lt;ref name=&quot;Salus&quot;&gt;{{cite book
   |title=A Quarter Century of Unix
   |last=Salus
   |first=Peter
   |publisher=Addison-Wesley
   |year=1994
   |isbn=0-201-54777-5
   |pages=199â200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 4, 1991, Sun announced that it would replace its existing BSD-derived Unix, [[SunOS|SunOS 4]], with one based on SVR4. This was identified internally as '''SunOS 5''', but a new marketing name was introduced at the same time: '''Solaris 2'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release
  | title = SunSoft introduces first shrink-wrapped distributed computing solution: Solaris

  | accessdate = 2007-08-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; While SunOS 4.1.''x'' micro releases were [[retronym|retroactively named]] '''Solaris 1''' by Sun, the Solaris name is almost exclusively used to refer to the SVR4-derived SunOS 5.0 and later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://kb.iu.edu/data/agjq.html

  | date = 2006-03-
  | work = Knowledge Base
  | publisher = Indiana University Technology Services
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The justification for this new &quot;overbrand&quot; was that it encompassed not only SunOS, but also the [[OpenWindows]] [[graphical user interface]] and [[Open Network Computing]] (ONC) functionality. The SunOS minor version is included in the Solaris release number; for example, '''Solaris 2.4''' incorporated SunOS 5.4. After Solaris 2.6, Sun dropped the &quot;2.&quot; from the number, so Solaris 7 incorporates SunOS 5.7, and the latest release SunOS 5.10 forms the core of '''Solaris 10'''.

==Supported architectures==
Solaris uses a common [[Source code|code base]] for the platforms it supports: [[SPARC]] and i86pc (which includes both [[x86]] and [[x86-64]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://sun.com/bigadmin/hcl | title = Solaris OS: Hardware Compatibility Lists | accessdate = 2006-12-12 | work = BigAdmin System Administration Portal | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Solaris has a reputation for being well-suited to [[symmetric multiprocessing]], supporting a large number of [[central processing unit|CPUs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

This has often led to more reliable systems, but at a cost premium over [[commodity]] PC hardware. However, it has also supported x86 systems since Solaris 2.1 and the latest version, Solaris 10, includes support for 64-bit x86 applications, allowing Sun to capitalize on the availability of commodity 64-bit CPUs based on the [[x86-64]] architecture. Sun has heavily marketed Solaris for use with both its own &quot;x64&quot; [[workstation]]s and [[server (computing)|servers]] based on [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] and [[Intel]] [[Xeon]] processors, as well as x86 systems manufactured by companies such as [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], and [[IBM]]. As of 2009, the following vendors support Solaris for their x86 server systems:

===Other platforms===
Solaris 2.5.1 included support for the [[PowerPC]] platform ([[PowerPC Reference Platform]]), but the port was canceled before the Solaris 2.6 release.&lt;ref name=&quot;ppc-kickstart&quot;/&gt; In January 2006 a community of developers at [[Blastwave]] began work on a PowerPC port which they named ''Polaris''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Solaris also supports the [[Linux]] platform [[application binary interface|ABI]], allowing Solaris to run native Linux [[object file|binaries]] on x86 systems. This feature is called &quot;Solaris Containers for Linux Applications&quot; or SCLA, based on the [[branded zones]] functionality introduced in Solaris 10 8/07.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Installation and usage options==
Solaris can be installed from various pre-packaged software groups, ranging from a minimalistic &quot;Reduced Network Support&quot; to a complete &quot;Entire Plus [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]]&quot;. Installation of Solaris is not necessary for an individual to use the system. Additional software, like Apache, MySQL, etc. can be installed as well in a packaged form from sunfreeware, [[OpenCSW]] and [[Blastwave]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunfreeware.org Sunfreeware Package List]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opencsw.org/packages OpenCSW Package List]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage with installation===
[[Image:Sol10-text-welcome-screen.gif|thumb|right|250px|Solaris 10 text installation]]
[[Image:Sol10-WelcomeWebStart.gif|thumb|right|250px|Solaris 10 graphical installation]]
Solaris can be installed from physical media or a network for use on a desktop or server.

Solaris can be interactively installed from a text console on platforms without a video display and mouse. This may be selected for servers, in a rack, in a remote data center, from a terminal server or even dial up modem.

Solaris can be interactively installed from a graphical console. This may be selected for personal workstations or laptops, in a local area, where a console may normally be used.

Solaris can be automatically installed over a network. System administrators can customize installations with scripts and configuration files, including configuration and automatic installation of third-party software, without purchasing additional software management utilities.

When Solaris is installed, the operating system will reside on the same system where the installation occurred. Applications may be individually installed on the local system, or can be mounted via the network from a remote system.

===Usage without installation===
Solaris can be used without separately installing the operating system on a desktop or server.

Solaris can be booted from a remote server providing an OS image in a [[diskless workstation|diskless]] environment, or in an environment where an internal disk is only used for swap space. In this configuration, the operating system still runs locally on the system. Applications may or may not reside locally when they are running. This may be selected for businesses or educational institutions where rapid setup is required (workstations can be &quot;rolled off&quot; of a loading dock, the [[MAC address]] registered into a central server, plugged in, and be immediately usable) or rapid replacement is required (if a desktop hardware failure occurs, a new workstation is pulled from a closet, plugged in, and a user can resume their work from their last saved point.)

Solaris can also be used from a thin client. Applications, operating system, window manager, and graphical rendering runs on one or more remote servers. Administrators can add a user account to a central Solaris system and a thin client can be rolled from a closet, placed on a desktop, and a user can start work immediately. If there is a hardware failure, the thin client can be swapped and the user can resume their work from the exact point of failure, whether or not the work was saved.

==Desktop environments==
[[Image:openwindows.jpg|thumb|right|250px|olvwm with OpenWindows on Solaris]]
Early releases of Solaris used [[OpenWindows]] as the standard desktop environment. In Solaris 2.0 to 2.2, OpenWindows supported both [[NeWS]] and [[X Window System|X]] applications, and provided [[backward compatibility]] for [[SunView]] applications from Sun's older desktop environment. NeWS allowed applications to be built in an [[object oriented]] way using [[PostScript]], a common printing language released in 1982. The [[X Window System]] originated from [[MIT]]'s [[Project Athena]] in 1984 and allowed for the display of an application to be disconnected from the machine where the application was running, separated by a network connection. Sunâs original bundled SunView application suite was ported to X.

Sun later dropped support for legacy SunView applications and NeWS with OpenWindows 3.3, which shipped with Solaris 2.3, and switched to [[X11R5]] with [[Display Postscript]] support. The graphical look and feel remained based upon [[OPEN LOOK]]. OpenWindows 3.6.2 was the last release under Solaris 8. The OPEN LOOK Window Manager ([[olwm]]) with other OPEN LOOK specific applications were dropped in Solaris 9, but support libraries were still bundled, providing long term binary backwards compatibility with existing applications. The OPEN LOOK Virtual Window Manager ([[olvwm]]) can still be downloaded for Solaris from [http://www.sunfreeware.com sunfreeware] and works on releases as recent as Solaris 10.

[[Image:DECwindows-openvms-v7.3-1.png|thumb|right|250px|Common Desktop Environment]]
Sun and other Unix vendors created an industry alliance to standardize Unix desktops. As a member of COSE, the [[Common Open Software Environment]] initiative, Sun helped co-develop the [[Common Desktop Environment]]. CDE was an initiative to create a standard Unix desktop environment. Each vendor contributed different components: [[Hewlett-Packard]] contributed the [[X window manager|window manager]], [[IBM]] provided the [[file manager]], and Sun provided the [[e-mail]] and calendar facilities as well as drag-and-drop support ([[ToolTalk]]). This new desktop environment was based upon the [[Motif (widget toolkit)|Motif]] look and feel and the old OPEN LOOK desktop environment was considered legacy. CDE unified Unix desktops across multiple [[open system]] vendors. CDE was available as an unbundled add-on for Solaris 2.4 and 2.5, and was included in Solaris 2.6 through 10. The CDE applications are no longer included in OpenSolaris and Solaris 11, but many libraries remain for binary backwards compatibility.

In 2001, Sun issued a preview release of the open-source desktop environment [[GNOME]] 1.4, based on the [[GTK+]] toolkit, for Solaris 8.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnome1.4&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mail.gnome.org/archives/gnome-announce-list/2001-May/msg00046.html|title=Sun Announces GNOME 1.4 for Solaris|last=Mannina|first=Scott|date=2001-05-23|accessdate=2009-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solaris 9 8/03 introduced GNOME 2.0 as an alternative to CDE. Solaris 10 includes Sun's [[Java Desktop System]] (JDS), which is based on GNOME and comes with a large set of applications, including [[StarOffice]], Sun's [[office suite]]. Sun describes JDS as a &quot;major component&quot; of Solaris 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open source desktop environments [[KDE]] and [[Xfce]], along with numerous other [[window managers]], also compile and run on recent versions of Solaris.

Sun was investing in a new desktop environment called [[Project Looking Glass]] since 2003. The project has been inactive since late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lg3d-core.dev.java.net/|title=Project Looking Glass Homepage|accessdate=2010-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development release==
The underlying Solaris codebase has been under continuous development since work began in the late 1980s on what was eventually released as Solaris 2.0. Each version such as Solaris 10 is based on a snapshot of this development codebase, taken near the time of its release, which is then maintained as a derived project. Updates to that project are built and delivered several times a year until the next official release comes out.

The Solaris version under development by Sun since the release of Solaris 10 in 2005 is [[codename]]d ''Nevada'', and is derived from what is now the [[OpenSolaris]] codebase.

In 2003, an addition to the Solaris development process was initiated. Under the program name ''Software Express for Solaris'' (or just ''Solaris Express''), a binary release based on the current development basis was made available for download on a monthly basis, allowing anyone to try out new features and test the quality and stability of the OS as it progressed to the release of the next official Solaris version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

  | publisher = Sun Microsystems, Inc.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later change to this program introduced a quarterly release model with support available, renamed ''Solaris Express Developer Edition'' (SXDE).

In 2007, Sun announced ''Project Indiana'' with several goals, including providing an open source binary distribution of the OpenSolaris project, replacing SXDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://sun.com/featured-articles/2007-0731/feature/

  |author = Robert Baty
  |date = 2007-07-31
  |publisher = Sun Microsystems
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first release of this distribution was ''OpenSolaris 2008.05''.

&lt;span id=&quot;SXCE&quot;&gt;
The ''Solaris Express Community Edition'' (SXCE)&lt;/span&gt; was intended specifically for OpenSolaris developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | url = http://opensolaris.org/os/downloads/on/
  | title = Operating System/Networking (ON) Download Center
  | accessdate = 2006-12-12
  | work = OpenSolaris web site
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was updated every two weeks, until it was discontinued in January 2010, with users recommended to migrate to the OpenSolaris distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  |url = http://mail.opensolaris.org/pipermail/opensolaris-announce/2010-January/001356.html
  |title = Update on SXCE
  |accessdate = 2010-03-21
  |author = Derek Cicero
  |date = 2010-01-06
  |publisher = Sun Microsystems
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the download license seen when downloading the image files indicates its use is limited to personal, educational and evaluation purposes, the license acceptance form displayed when the user actually installs from these images lists additional uses including commercial and production environments.

SXCE releases terminated with build 130 and OpenSolaris releases terminated with build 134 a few weeks later. The next release of OpenSolaris based on build 134 was due in March 2010 but it was never fully released, though the packages were made available on the package repository.   Instead Oracle renamed the binary distro to Solaris 11 Express, with different license terms, and released build 151a as 2010.11 in November 2010.
