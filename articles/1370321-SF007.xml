'''Windows Defender''', formerly known as '''Microsoft AntiSpyware''', is a software product from [[Microsoft]] to prevent, remove, and [[quarantine]] [[spyware]] in [[Microsoft Windows]]. It is included and enabled by default in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], and is available as a free download for [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]].

==Basic features==
Windows Defender features spyware scanning capabilities like other free spyware-scanning products available on the market, and includes a number of real-time security agents that monitor several common areas of Windows for changes which may be caused by spyware. It also includes the ability to easily remove [[ActiveX]] applications that are installed. Also integrated is support for [[Microsoft SpyNet]] network that allows users to report to Microsoft what they consider to be spyware, and what applications and device drivers they allow to be installed on their system.

==History==
===Beta 1===
[[File:Windows AntiSpyware Beta 1.png|thumb|left|Microsoft AntiSpyware Beta 1 (Version 1.0.701)]]
Windows Defender is based on [[GIANT AntiSpyware]], which was originally developed by [[GIANT Company Software, Inc]]. The company's acquisition was announced by Microsoft on December 16, 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winsupersite&quot;&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=[[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the original GIANT AntiSpyware supported older Windows versions, support for the [[Windows 9x]] line of operating systems was later dropped.

The first release of Microsoft AntiSpyware was released in [[Development stage#Beta|beta]] form on January 6, 2005 and was basically a repackaged GIANT AntiSpyware.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winsupersite&quot; /&gt;  It was then a free product (though only for genuine installations of Windows), contained few new features and was simply rebranded as a Microsoft product. More builds were released as 2005 progressed, with the last Beta 1 refresh released on November 21, 2005.

===Beta 2===
At the 2005 [[RSA Security]] conference, Chief Software Architect and co-founder of Microsoft, [[Bill Gates]], announced that Windows Defender (which was known as Microsoft AntiSpyware prior to November 4, 2005) would be made available free of charge to all validly licensed Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003 users to help secure their systems against the increasing malware threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Windows Defender (Beta 2) was released on February 13, 2006. It featured the program's new name and a significant user interface redesign. The core engine was rewritten in [[C++]], unlike the original GIANT-developed one, which was written in [[Visual Basic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/reviews/windefender_beta2.asp|title=Windows Defender Beta 2 Review: Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows|last=Thurrott|first=Paul|authorlink=Paul Thurrott|publisher=SuperSite for Windows|date={{date|February 14, 2006}}|accessdate={{date|2009-10-08}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; This improved the application's performance. Also, since beta 2, the program works as a Windows service, unlike earlier releases, which enables the application to protect the computer even when a user is not logged on. The Windows Defender application is technically an [[User interface|interface]] to the service, which also has the same name. Beta 2 also requires [[Windows Genuine Advantage]] validation. However, Windows Defender (Beta 2) did not contain some of the tools found in Microsoft AntiSpyware (Beta 1). Microsoft removed the ''System Inoculation'', ''Secure Shredder''  and ''System Explorer'' tools found in MSAS (Beta 1) as well as the ''Tracks Eraser'' tool, which allowed users to easily delete many different types of temporary files related to [[Internet Explorer 6]], including [[HTTP cookies|cookies]], [[Web cache|temporary internet files]], and [[Windows Media Player]] playback history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Winsupersite&quot; /&gt; Microsoft later released German&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Windows Defender: Startseite|url=http://www.microsoft.com/germany/windows/products/winfamily/defender/default.mspx|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=8 May 2011|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Japanese&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ãã¤ã¯ã­ã½ãã ã»ã­ã¥ãªãã£ At Home|url=http://www.microsoft.com/japan/protect/default.mspx|publisher=Microsoft Corporation|accessdate=8 May 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; versions of Windows Defender (Beta 2).

===General availability===

==Advanced features==
[[File:Windows Defender EICAR.png|thumb|Windows Defender is shown here successfully blocking the [[EICAR test file]].]]

===Real-time protection===
In the Windows Defender options, the user can configure [[real-time protection]] options:
* ''Auto Start'' - Monitors lists of programs that are allowed to automatically run when the user starts the computer
* ''System Configuration (settings)'' - Monitors security-related settings in Windows
* ''Internet Explorer Add-ons'' - Monitors programs that automatically run when the user starts Internet Explorer
* ''Internet Explorer Configurations (settings)'' - Monitors browser security settings
* ''Internet Explorer Downloads'' - Monitors files and programs that are designed to work with Internet Explorer
* ''Services and Drivers'' - Monitors services and drivers as they interact with Windows and programs
* ''Application Execution'' - Monitors when programs start and any operations they perform while running
* ''Application Registration'' - Monitors tools and files in the operating system where programs can register to run at any time
* ''Windows Add-ons'' - Monitors add-on programs (also known as software utilities) for Windows

===Internet Explorer integration===
There is integration with [[Internet Explorer]] which enables files to be scanned when they are downloaded to help ensure that one does not accidentally download malicious software. This implementation is similar to the real-time scanners of many [[Antivirus software|anti-virus]] products on the market. Although not combined with Firefox or other browsers, Windows Defender still scans downloaded files for malicious code, as part of the real-time protection.

===Software Explorer===
The ''Advanced Tools'' section allows users to discover potential vulnerabilities with a series of Software Explorers. They provide views of startup programs, currently running software, network connected applications, and [[Winsock]] providers ([[Layered Service Provider|Winsock LSPs]]). In each Explorer, every element is rated as either &quot;Known&quot;, &quot;Unknown&quot; or &quot;Potentially Unwanted&quot;. The first and last categories carry a link to learn more about the particular item, and the second category invites users to submit the program to Microsoft SpyNet for analysis by experts. The Software Explorer feature has been removed from Windows Defender in Windows 7.

===Windows Vista-specific functionality===
Windows Defender in Windows Vista automatically blocks all startup items that require administrator privileges to run (this is considered suspicious behavior for a startup item). This automatic blocking is related to the [[User Account Control|UAC]] (User Account Control) functionality in Windows Vista, and requires users to manually run each of these startup items each time they log in.

===Microsoft Security Essentials===
Windows Defender is superseded by [[Microsoft Security Essentials]], a standalone antimalware product from Microsoft. Upon installation, Microsoft Security Essentials disables Windows Defender and takes over its duty.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuperSite&quot;&gt;{{cite web
