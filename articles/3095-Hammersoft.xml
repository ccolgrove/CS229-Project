The '''Amiga 500''' - also known as the '''A500''' (or its code name 'Rock Lobster') - was the first âlow-endâ [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[Amiga]] [[16-bit|16]]/[[32-bit]] [[multimedia]] home/[[personal computer]]. It was announced at the winter [[Consumer Electronics Show]] in January [[1987]] - at the same time as the high-end [[Amiga 2000]] - and competed directly against the [[Atari ST|Atari 520ST]]. Before Amiga 500 was shipped, Commodore suggested that the list price of the Amiga 500 was 595.95 [[United States dollar|USD]] without a monitor. At delivery in 1987, Commodore announced that the Amiga 500 would carry a 699 USD list price.

The Amiga 500 represented a return to Commodore's roots by being sold in the same mass retail outlets as the [[Commodore 64]] - to which it was a spiritual successor - as opposed to the computer-store-only [[Amiga 1000]].

The original Amiga 500 proved to be Commodoreâs best-selling Amiga model, enjoying particular success in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigau.com/aig/sales.html amigau.com - Commodore-Amiga Sales Figures&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although popular with hobbyists, arguably its most widespread use was as a gaming machine, where its advanced graphics and sound for the time were of significant benefit.

== Releases ==

In October 1989, the Amiga 500 dropped its price from 499 [[Pound sterling|GBP]] to 399 GBP and was bundled with the ''Batman Pack'' in the United Kingdom. This price drop helped Commodore to sell more than 1 million Amiga 500s in 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/a500batman.html A500 Batman Bundle]&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1991, an enhanced model known as the [[Amiga 500+]] replaced the standard Amiga 500 in some markets, it was bundled with the ''Cartoon Classics'' pack in the United Kingdom at 399 GBP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/cartoon.html Cartoon Classics Bundles]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Amiga 500 series was discontinued in mid-1992 replaced by the similarly specified and priced [[Amiga 600]], although this new machine had originally been intended as a much cheaper budget model, which would have been the A300. In late 1992, Commodore released the ânext-generationâ [[Amiga 1200]], a machine closer in concept to the original Amiga 500, but featuring significant technical improvements. Despite this, neither the A1200 nor the A600 replicated the commercial success of its predecessor as, by this time, the market was definitively shifting from the [[home computer]] platforms of the past to commodity [[Wintel]] [[IBM PC compatible|PCs]] and the new &quot;low-cost&quot; [[Macintosh Classic]], [[Macintosh LC|LC]] and [[IIsi]] models.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amigahistory.co.uk/commodore.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technical description ==

The Amiga 500 utilizes a [[Motorola 68000]] microprocessor running at {{nowrap|7.15909 [[MHz]]}} ([[NTSC]]) or {{nowrap|7.09379 [[MHz]]}} ([[PAL]]). The CPU is 32-bit internally, but uses a 16-bit data bus and 24-bit address bus, providing a maximum of 16 [[megabyte|MB]] of [[address space]]. The Amiga 500 uses the same [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] chipset as the Amiga 1000, so graphics can be displayed in multiple resolutions and color depths, even on the same screen. Resolutions vary from 320x200 (up to 32 colors) to 640x200 (up to 16 colors) for NTSC (704x484 overscan) and 320x256 to 640x256 for PAL (704x576 overscan.)&lt;ref name=&quot;displaysize&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Peck|first1 = Robert|last2 = Deyl|first2 = Susan|last3 = Miner|first3 = Jay|last4 = Raymond|first4 = Chris|title = Amiga hardware reference manual|publisher = [[Addison Wesley]]|year = 1986|month = September|page = 72|isbn = 0-201-11077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system uses [[planar (computer graphics)|planar]] graphics, with up to five bitplanes (four in hires) allowing 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 color screens, from a palette of 4096 colors. Two special graphics modes are also available: Extra HalfBrite, which uses a 6th bitplane as a mask to half the brightness of any color, and {{nowrap|[[Hold And Modify]] (HAM)}} which allows all the 4096 colors to be used on screen at simultaneously. However only one of the red, green, blue base colours could be changed in the adjacent pixel in this mode.&lt;ref name=bitplanes&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Peck|first1 = Robert|last2 = Deyl|first2 = Susan|last3 = Miner|first3 = Jay|last4 = Raymond|first4 = Chris|title = Amiga hardware reference manual|publisher = [[Addison Wesley]]|year = 1986|month = September|page = 37|isbn = 0-201-11077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later revisions of the chipset are [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] switchable in software. The sound chip produces four hardware mixed channels of 8-bit PCM at a sampling frequency of up to {{nowrap|28 kHz}}. The hardware channels have independent volume levels and sampling rates and are output with two channels mixed to the left and two to the right audio output. Each channel can also be designated another channel where it can modulate both volume and frequency using its own output. The stock system comes with [[AmigaOS]] version 1.2 or 1.3 and {{nowrap|512 [[kilobyte|kB]]}} of [[Chip RAM]], one built in double-density [[floppy disk drive]] that is completely programmable and can read {{nowrap|720 kB}} [[IBM PC]] disks, {{nowrap|880 kB}} standard Amiga disks, and up to {{nowrap|984 kB}} using custom formatting drivers like Klaus Deppichâs [http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/Diskspr3 diskspare.device]. The Amiga 500 houses the keyboard and floppy drive in one shell, unlike the [[Amiga 1000]].

Despite the lack of [[Amiga Zorro II|Amiga 2000-compatible internal expansion slots]], there are many ports and expansion options. There are two [[Atari 2600]] [[D-subminiature|DE9M]] sockets for [[joystick]]s or [[Mouse (computing)|mice]], stereo audio ([[RCA connector]]s 1&amp;nbsp;V [[Peak-to-peak|p-p]]). There is a floppy drive port for daisy-chaining up to 3 extra floppy disk drives via an DB23F connector.&lt;ref name=gbwxgm&gt;{{cite web|title=Hi Res Version, Rear of Amiga 500 - 122K|url=http://amigahardware.mariomisic.de/download_photos/a500_4_big.jpg}} 070728 amigahardware.mariomisic.de&lt;/ref&gt; The then-standard [[RS-232]] serial port (DB25M) and [[Centronics]] [[parallel port]] (DB25F) are also included. The power supply is ({{nowrap|+5V}}, {{nowrap|+/-12V}}).&lt;ref name=itgehi&gt;{{cite web|title=Amiga 500/600/1200 Power Connector|url=http://www.ntrautanen.fi/computers/hardware/misc/a500_power.htm}} 070808 ntrautanen.fi&lt;/ref&gt; 
The system displays video in analog [[RGB color model|RGB]] {{nowrap|50 [[hertz|Hz]]}} [[PAL]] and {{nowrap|60 Hz}} [[NTSC]] using a proprietary DB23M video connector and outputs video at {{nowrap|15,750 Hz}} (incompatible with most VGA monitors) [[Synchronization|HSync]] for standard video modes while a [[Multisync monitor]] is required for some higher resolutions. This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. The system was bundled with an [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] to provide output on [[television]]s with a coaxial input, while [[composite video]] is available via an [[RCA connector]]. There is also a [[Zorro II]] bus expansion on the left side (behind a plastic cover). Peripherals such as a hard drive can be added via the expansion slot and are configured automatically by the Amiga's [[AutoConfig]] standard, so that multiple devices do not conflict with each other. Up to {{nowrap|8 MB}} of âfast&quot; RAM can be added using the side expansion slot.

The Amiga 500 has a &quot;trapdoor&quot; slot on the underside for an upgrade of {{nowrap|512 kB}} of RAM. The extra RAM is classified as &quot;fast&quot; RAM, but is sometimes referred to as &quot;slow&quot; RAM since due to the design of the expansion bus it is actually on the chipset bus. Such upgrades usually include a battery-backed [[real-time clock]]. All versions of the A500 can have the additional RAM configured as Chip RAM by a simple hardware modification, which involves fitting a later model (8372A) [[MOS Technology Agnus|Agnus]] chip. Likewise, all versions of the A500 can be upgraded to {{nowrap|2 MB}} Chip RAM by fitting the {{nowrap|8372B Agnus}} chip and adding additional memory. 

The Amiga 500 also sports an unusual feature for a budget machine, socketed chips, which allow easy replacement of defective chips. The CPU can be directly upgraded to a [[Motorola 68010|68010]] or to a [[Motorola 68020|68020]], [[Motorola 68030|68030]], or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] via the side expansion slot. In fact, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set]] (ECS) versions.

The case is made from [[Acrylonitrile butadiene styrene|ABS]] plastics which may become brown with time. This can be reversed by using the public domain chemical mix &quot;[[Retr0bright]]&quot;.

Whenever the computer is powered on a self diagnostic test is run that will show any failure with a specific colour where 
{{color|Green|Green}} means no [[Amiga Chip RAM|chip RAM]] found or is damaged, 
{{color|Red|Red}} means bad [[Kickstart (Amiga)|kickstart]]-[[Read-only memory|ROM]], 
&lt;!--{{Background color|Black|--&gt;{{color|#DFDF00|Yellow}} means mostly a bad [[Central processing unit|CPU]] (no trap routine) or a bad [[Amiga Zorro II|Zorro]] [[expansion card]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://eab.abime.net/showthread.php?t=497 abime.net - Question  blinking power led/no screen on amiga 500] read 2011-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;
{{color|Blue|Blue}} means custom chip problem ([[Original Chip Set#Denise|Denise]] [[Original Chip Set#Paula|Paula]] [[Original Chip Set#Agnus|Agnus]]),
{{color|Lime|Light green}} means [[MOS Technology CIA|CIA]] problem,
{{color|Silver|Light Grey}} means if stops at Grey that the CIA can be defective,
Black/stripes means ROM or CIA problem,
Black (no video) means really basic problem.&lt;ref name=a3b&gt;[http://amiga.serveftp.net/A3000_HardwareGuide/booting-problems.html amiga.serveftp.net - A3000 Booting Problems] read 2011-11-03&lt;/ref&gt;
The keyboard [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] uses blink codes where
One blink means the keyboard ROM has a checksum error,
Two blinks means RAM failure,
Three blinks means watchdog timer failure.&lt;ref name=a3b/&gt;
Using [[caps lock]] key and getting a response means CIA and the CPU works.&lt;ref name=a3b/&gt;

== Technical specifications ==
[[Image:Amiga 1.3 and disks.jpg|thumb|right|The standard Amiga 500 requires floppies to boot]]
* [[Original Amiga chipset|OCS]] (1.2 &amp; 1.3 models) or [[Amiga Enhanced Chip Set|ECS]] (500+ 2.04 models) chipset. ECS revisions of the chipset made [[PAL]]/[[NTSC]] mode switchable in software.
** Graphics can be of arbitrary dimensions, resolution and colour depth, even on the same screen.
** Without using overscan, the graphics can be 320 or 640 pixels wide by 200/256 or 400/512 pixels tall.
** [[Planar (computer graphics)|Planar]] graphics are used, with up to 5 bitplanes (4 in hires); this allowed 2, 4, 8, 16 and 32 colour screens, from a palette of 4096 colours. Two special graphics modes were also included: Extra HalfBrite, which used a 6th bitplane as a mask that halved the brightness of any colour seen, and [[Hold And Modify]] (HAM), which allowed all 4096 colours on screen at once.
** [[Rhett Anderson]] developed the so called ''Sliced HAM'' or ''SHM'' mode, which was a standard 32-color mode, but used the [[Original_Amiga_chipset#Copper|Copper]] (part of the Agnus chip which could change hardware registers at given screen positions) to reprogram the color palette registers at each scanline. The advantage of SHM files was the ability to display all 4096 colors while eliminating the color blur of HAM compression.
** Sound is 4 hardware-mixed channels of 8-bit sound at up to {{nowrap|28 kHz}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Amiga 500|work=OldComputers.com| url=http://www.old-computers.com/MUSEUM/computer.asp?c=65&amp;st=1| accessdate=December 15, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hardware channels had independent volumes (65 levels) and sampling rates, and mixed down to two fully left and fully right stereo outputs. A software controllable low-pass audio filter is also included.
* 512 [[kilobyte|kB]] of [[Chip RAM]].
* [[AmigaOS]] 1.2 or 1.3
* One double-density [[floppy disk drive]] is built in, which is completely programmable and thus can read {{nowrap|720 kB}} [[IBM PC]] disks, {{nowrap|880 kB}} standard Amiga disks, and up to {{nowrap|984 kB}} with custom formatting (such as Klaus Deppichâs [http://aminet.net/package/disk/misc/Diskspr3 diskspare.device]). Uses {{nowrap|300 rpm}} and {{nowrap|250 kbit/s}}.
* Built in keyboard.
* A two-button mouse is included.

=== Graphics ===
* [[PAL]] mode: 320 Ã 256, 640 Ã 256, 640 Ã 512 ([[Interlaced video|interlace]]), 704 Ã 576 in overscan.
* [[NTSC]] mode: 320 Ã 200, 640 Ã 200, 640 Ã 400 (interlace), 704 Ã 484 in overscan.
Max 6 [[Color depth|bpp]]. The Amiga could show multiple resolution modes at the same time, splitting the screen vertically. An additional mode called [[Hold-And-Modify]] (HAM) makes it possible to utilize {{nowrap|12 bpp}} over a {{nowrap|3 [[pixel]]s}} wide span. This works by letting each pixel position use the previous RGB value and modify one of the red, green or blue values to a new 4-bit value. This will cause some negligible colour artifacts however.

=== Connectors ===
[[Image:Amiga 520.jpg|thumb|right|The Amiga 520 adapter allowed for an [[RF modulator|RF modulated]] output, to be connected to a TV]]
* Two [[D-subminiature#DE-9_connector|DB9M]] sockets for [[joystick]]s or [[Mouse (computing)|mice]] (as popularized by the [[Atari 2600]]).
* Stereo audio ([[RCA connector]]s 1&amp;nbsp;V [[Peak-to-peak|p-p]]).
* A floppy drive port (DB23F), for daisy-chaining up to 3 extra floppy disk drives via an [[D-subminiature|DB23F]] connector.&lt;ref name = &quot;gbwxgm&quot;/&gt;
* A standard [[RS-232]] serial port (DB25M).
* A [[parallel port]] (DB25F).
* Power inlet ({{nowrap|+5 V}}, {{nowrap|+/-12 V}}).&lt;ref name = &quot;itgehi&quot; /&gt;
* Analogue [[RGB]] 50 [[hertz|Hz]] [[PAL]] and {{nowrap|60 Hz}} [[NTSC]] video output, provided on an Amiga-specific [[DB23]]M [[Amiga video connector|video connector]]. Can drive video with {{nowrap|15,750 Hz}} [[Synchronization|HSync]] for standard Amiga video modes. This is not compatible with most [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] monitors. A [[Multisync monitor]] is required for some higher resolutions. This connection can also be [[genlock]]ed to an external video signal. An [[RF modulator|RF adapter]] (A520) was frequently bundled with the machine to provide output on regular [[television]]s or on [[composite video|composite]] monitors. A digital 16 colour Red-Green-Blue-Intensity signal is available too on the same connector.
* Monochrome video via an [[RCA connector]].
* [[Zorro II]] bus expansion on the left side behind a plastic cover.
* Trapdoor slot under the machine, for RAM expansion and [[real-time clock]].

=== Expansions ===

* Expansion ports are limited to a side expansion port and a trapdoor expansion on the underside of the machine. The casing can also be opened up (voiding the warranty), all chips are socketed rather than [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] soldered, so they can be replaced by hand.
* The CPU can be upgraded to a [[68010]] directly or to a [[68020]], [[68030]] or [[Motorola 68040|68040]] via the side expansion slot.
* The Chip RAM can be upgraded to 1 [[megabyte|MB]] directly on the motherboard, provided a [[Fat Agnus]] chip is also installed to support it.
* Likewise, all the custom chips can be upgraded to the [[Extended chip set|ECS]] chipset.
* 512 kB of â[[Amiga Chip RAM#Fast RAM|Slow RAM]]â or âTrapdoor RAMâ can be added via the trapdoor expansion. Such upgrades usually also included a battery-backed clock. The memory were however only accessable by the processor but still slow as the chip RAM.
* Up to 8 MB of âFast RAMâ can be added via the side expansion slot.
* Hard drive and other peripherals can be added via the side expansion slot.
* Several companies provided combined CPU, memory and hard drive upgrades - or provided chainable expansions, as there is only one side expansion slot.
* Expansions are configured automatically by [[AutoConfig]] software, so multiple pieces of hardware did not conflict with each other.
