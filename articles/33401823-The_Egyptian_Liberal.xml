In April 2009 he founded the No to Compulsory Military Service movement. He declared his [[conscientious objection]], demanding to be exempted from military service. Instead, he was arrested on 12 November 2010 by military police but was released two days later, and finally exempted from service on medical grounds. Sanad participated actively in the Egyptian revolution, highlighting the fact that Egypt has effectively been ruled by the military for six decades. He was arrested on 4 February by military police and tortured, but released 27 hours later. He was arrested in his home in the Ain Shams neighbourhood in Cairo at about 10 PM on 28 March 2011 by military police. He was only able to call his brother the next day to inform him of his arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wri-irg.org/node/12513 |title=EGYPT: Egyptian pacifist Maikel Nabil Sanad arrested for insulting the military &amp;#124; War Resisters' International |publisher=Wri-irg.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sanad was sentenced to three years' imprisonment on charges of &quot;insulting the military&quot; in his post &quot;The Army and The People Were Never One Hand&quot; on maikelnabil.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maikelnabil.com/2011/03/army-and-people-wasnt-ever-one-hand.html |title=Maikel Nabil Sanad ÙØ§ÙÙÙ ÙØ¨ÙÙ Ø³ÙØ¯: The Army and The People Were Never One Hand |publisher=Maikelnabil.com |date=2011-03-08 |accessdate=2011-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the 10th of Ramadan military court in Nasr City near Cairo on 10 April. Before this, he was imprisoned in a special punishment cell at El Marg prison, which did not allow him any sunlight. In addition, his cell mates threatened him.
