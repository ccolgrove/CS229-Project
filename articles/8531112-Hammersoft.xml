The animated television series ''[[Avatar: The Last Airbender]]'' and its live-action film adaptation, ''[[The Last Airbender]]'', feature an extensive cast of characters created by [[Bryan Konietzko]] and [[Michael Dante DiMartino]]. Taking place in a fictional universe composed of four sovereign nations, the series deals with a war started by the belligerent Fire Nation as an attempt to conquer the world. The Avatar, a being who represents the spirit of the Earth itself and alone holds the power to counter the Fire Nation aggression, has been mysteriously missing for the past 100 years, plunging the world into a century of war. The first phase of war ended with a [[genocide]] of the Air Nomads, near extinction of the Water Tribes, and extensive [[colonization]] of the Earth Kingdom, thus setting up the world in which the characters of the series live.

The main [[protagonist]] of the series is [[Aang]], the most recent incarnation of the Avatar, who is released from an iceberg after being [[suspended animation|frozen]] for 100 years. With his new friends [[Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Katara]] and [[Sokka]], and later [[Toph]], Aang sets out to master the three unlearned bending arts and end the war that has ravaged the world during his absence. The series also focuses on [[Zuko]], the [[crown prince]] of the Fire Nation; initially portrayed as an antagonist who tries to capture Aang, but with the help of [[Uncle Iroh|his uncle]], become a [[deuteragonist]].

Character designs were originated from a series of drawings by one of the show's creators, [[Bryan Konietzko]]. The main sketch depicted a middle-aged [[monk]] with an arrow on his head and later included a flying bison as his pet. Konietzko's partner, [[Michael Dante DiMartino]], was interested in documentaries related to the [[South Pole]] at the time. They combined these ideas and created the concept of an &quot;air guy&quot; and &quot;water guys&quot; trapped in a snowy wasteland, with &quot;fire guys&quot; invading them.&lt;ref name=&quot;NickMagInterview1&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=DiMartino|first=Michael Dante|coauthors=Konietzko, Bryan|title=In Their Elements|journal=Nickelodeon Magazine|page=6|year=2006|issue=Winter 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the writers based the characters' different bending abilities on distinct styles of [[martial arts]].

==Character conception==
The characters of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' were designed by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]] and [[Bryan Konietzko]], the co-creators of the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;NickMagInterview1&quot;/&gt; The anime-styled character art was inspired by [[Shinichiro Watanabe]]'s ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]'', ''[[Samurai Champloo]]'', and ''[[FLCL]]'' (''Fooly Cooly'') of [[Gainax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/894/894105p1.html|title=Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko talk Airbender|publisher=IGN|author=Mell, Tory Ireland|date=July 26, 2008|accessdate=July 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original character conception was derived from a sketch by Bryan Konietzko that depicted a middle-aged balding man with an arrow on his head.&lt;ref name=&quot;NickMagInterview1&quot;/&gt; Studios such as [[Studio 4Â°C]], [[Production I.G]], and [[Studio Ghibli]], which produced anime-styled cartoons, were also sources of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last =Mullins|first =Summer|title =Creation Station, an interview with Bryan Konietzko and Michael DiMartino|issue =39|page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greatest influences on the series were [[Art of East Asia|Asian art]] and history; the characters' various personalities and traits are based on philosophical teachings such as [[Taoism]] and [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217111256/http://www.nicksplat.com/Whatsup/200510/12000135.html| archivedate = December 17, 2007| title = Interview With The Creators| accessdate = December 2, 2006|date=October 12, 2005| publisher = NickSplat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/28/arts/television/28lass.html?ei=5090&amp;en=2d9845c5b0133bb9&amp;ex=1282881600&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss&amp;pagewanted=all| title = Kung Fu Fightin' Anime Stars, Bo| accessdate = December 2, 2006| author = Mark Lasswell|date=August 25, 2005| newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the show, some characters have the ability to manipulate one of the four classic elements of ancient philosophy: [[Water (classical element)|Water]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]] and [[Air (classical element)|Air]], although the Avatar has the ability to control all four.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.musogato.com/avatar/calligraphy.html| title = Distant Horizon: Avatar Calligraphy| accessdate = December 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these employ a different form of [[martial arts]] in their fighting choreography: [[Baguazhang|Ba Gua]] for [[Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Elements|Airbending]], [[Hung Gar]] for [[Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Elements|Earthbending]], [[Northern Shaolin]] for [[Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Elements|Firebending]], and [[T'ai chi ch'uan|T'ai chi]] for [[Avatar:_The_Last_Airbender#Elements|Waterbending]].&lt;ref name=&quot;avatar2/index.jhtml&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.nick.com/shows/avatar| title = Nickelodeon's Official Avatar: The Last Airbender Flash Site| accessdate = December 2, 2006| publisher = Nick.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individual styles of martial arts also reflect on the personalities of the user and the nations as a whole. These starkly individual tendencies are explained in eighty-five distinct types of &quot;[[Neijia|Jings]]&quot;, or internal energy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Return To Omashu&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Return to Omashu|airdate=April 7, 2006|season=2|number=3|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Elizabeth Welch Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep23}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Ba Gua employs the &quot;negative jing&quot; to create erratic circular movements and capitalizes on [[centripetal force]] and defensive positions while Northern Shaolin follows the &quot;positive jing&quot; and emphasizes brute strength and aggression to generate power.&lt;ref name=&quot;avatar2/index.jhtml&quot;/&gt; The negative jing reflects [[Aang]]'s bending styles and his tendency to be unpredictable and extremely carefree, as well as his [[pacifism|pacifist]] and non-aggressive nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Storm&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Storm|airdate=June 3, 2005|season=1|number=12|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 1)#ep12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sozin Comet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.toonzone.net/article.php?ID=25009|title=&quot;Sozin's Comet&quot; Produces an Epic Season Finale for &quot;Avatar the Last Airbender&quot;|author=Liu, Ed|publisher=Toon Zone|date=July 18, 2008|accessdate=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kyoshi&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Warriors of Kyoshi|airdate=March 4, 2005|season=1|number=4|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: Nick Malis|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 1)#ep4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the recurring characters of the series have received traits based on the respective element.

After Aang is rescued from a century of [[suspended animation]] by Katara and Sokka, the trio embark to teach Aang the remaining three elements: water, earth, and fire.

Aang ultimately defeats the Fire Lord at the end of the series; but instead of killing him, deprives him of firebending ability.

===Katara===
{{Main|Katara (Avatar: The Last Airbender)}}
Katara ({{zh |s=å¡å¡æ |p=KÇ TÇlÄ}}) is voiced by [[Mae Whitman]] in the animated series&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyReview1&quot; /&gt;  and portrayed by [[Nicola Peltz]] in the live-action film.&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot;/&gt; She is the last waterbender of the Southern Water Tribe, the others being captured or killed by the [[Universe of Avatar: The Last Airbender#Navy|Southern Raiders]]. At the age of fourteen, she had mastered the art of waterbending &lt;ref name=&quot;NickMagScan04&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pittarese|first=Frank|title=Nation Exploration|journal=Nickelodeon Magazine|page=2|year=2006|issue=Winter 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and therefore began teaching Aang the art alongside his study of earthbending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter Work&quot;/&gt; Katara is very stubborn and is known for resisting gender stereotypes and discrimination &lt;ref name=&quot;The Waterbending Master&quot;/&gt;; but acts as den mother to the other protagonists. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter Work&quot;/&gt; As a waterbender, she is able to heal injuries, change water into [[ice]], and use it to cut through solid objects, and learns the manipulation of liquids within a living creature, called 'blood-bending'.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Puppetmaster&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Puppetmaster|airdate=October 25, 2007|season=3|number=8|credits=Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Tim Hedrick|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 3)#ep48}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known to become enamoured easily, and is often deeply hurt and angered by [[treachery]] or dishonesty.

===Sokka===
{{Main|Sokka}}
Sokka ({{zh |s=ç´¢å¡ |p=SÇo KÇ}}) is voiced by [[Jack DeSena]]&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyReview1&quot; /&gt; in the animated series and portrayed by [[Jackson Rathbone]] in the live-action film.&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot;/&gt; He is a 15-year-old warrior from the Southern Water Tribe, and Katara's elder brother.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bitter Work&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Bitter Work|airdate=June 2, 2006|season=2|number=9|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: Aaron Ehasz|series: Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep29}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one of Aang's companions; but has no bending power of his own, and instead relies on his intellect, courage, and martial skill. &lt;ref name=&quot;The Library&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Library|airdate=June 14, 2006|season=2|number=10|credits=Director: Giancarlo Volpe; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Surprisingly in an inhabitant of a mystical world, Sokka prefers science and is something of a [[jack of all trades, master of none|jack-of-all-trades]], in which respect he is easily able to understand the Fire Nation's advanced technology, and perfects the design of the [[hot air balloon]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Northern Air Temple| series = Avatar: The Last Airbender | network = Nickelodeon | airdate=November 4, 2005|season = 1 (Book 1) | number = 17|episodelink = Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 1)#ep17}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Toph===
{{Main|Toph Bei Fong}}
Toph ({{zh |s=åæ¹æè |p=BÄifÄng TuÃ²fÃº}}) is voiced by [[Jessie Flower]]&lt;ref name=&quot;TV Guide Cast&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/avatar-airbender/cast/194673|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender Cast and Details|publisher=[[TV Guide]]|date=|accessdate=November 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the animated series. She is a blind [[Earthbender|Earthbending]] grandmaster of the prestigious Bei Fong family in the Earth Kingdom.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Blind Bandit&quot;/&gt; Though blind, Toph has the ability to &quot;feel&quot; vibrations in the earth, be it the presence of trees and buildings or the march of [[ant]]s several meters away. Through this heightened sense, she can identify people's locations, their distance from her, and their physical build. This sense provides her with a distinct advantage when facing other Earthbenders in combat, as they characteristically require contact with the ground and extract rocks from their surroundings. As another result of her blindness, Toph has acquired an acute sense of hearing, enabling her to recognize people by the sound of their voices and to eavesdrop on distant conversations.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Desert&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Desert|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep31|season=2|number=11|transcripturl=http://www.avatarspiritmedia.net/transcripts.php?ep=211|credits=Director: Lauren MacMullan; Writer: Tim Hedrick|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other Earthbenders, Toph has a distinct style of earthbending not based on [[Hung Gar]] as is conventional, but rather the [[Southern Praying Mantis (martial art)|Southern Praying Mantis]]. This style places emphasis on quick generation of energy and low kicks that complement Toph's build. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| author = Lee, Henry and Harry A.

Against the will of her parents, Toph learned Earthbending through secret training and later fled her home to help Aang master Earthbending.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Blind Bandit&quot;/&gt; Toph is fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, and confrontational; commonly depicted as the [[choleric]] and [[tomboy]] of the group.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Blind Bandit&quot;/&gt; Later in the series, Toph taught herself metalbending while escaping from a metal box, by manipulation of the impurities within the metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Earth King&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=The Earth King|airdate=November 16, 2006|season=2|number=18|credits=Director: Ethan Spaulding; Writer: John O'Bryan|series=Avatar: The Last Airbender|serieslink=Avatar: The Last Airbender|network=Nickelodeon|episodelink=Avatar: The Last Airbender (Season 2)#ep38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prince Zuko ({{zh |s=èç§ |p=SÅ« KÄ}}) is voiced by [[Dante Basco]]&lt;ref name=&quot;VarietyReview1&quot; /&gt; in the animated series and portrayed by [[Dev Patel]] in the live-action film.&lt;ref name=&quot;more&quot;/&gt; At first, Zuko appears with a shaved head and a long topknot; but as the series continues he cuts off his topknot and grows his hair into a shaggy mane.

Director: Joaquim dos Santos; Writer: Aaron Ehasz. Avatar: The Last Airbender. Nickelodeon. 2007-11-26.

Despite his age and apparent frailty, Bumi is an Earthbending master, himself claiming at one point to be &quot;the most powerful Earthbender you'll ever see&quot;. He appears only once in each season: in Book 1 wherein his character is introduced, in Book 2 when Aang seeks to learn Earthbending from him, and in Book 3 wherein he aids Iroh and others to recapture Ba Sing Se from the Fire Nation.

*''' Combustion Man'''(also known as &quot;Sparky Sparky Boom Man&quot;) first appeared in the third season as an assassin hired by Prince Zuko to kill Aang, and served as an antagonist until his apparent death. His chief weapon is a unique method of Firebending allowing him to generate explosions from a [[third eye]] painted on his forehead, whereby he terrorizes the Avatar and his friends. He has no speaking parts and shows no mannerism except those suggesting a fierce attachment to his purpose.

*'''Earth King Kuei''' (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) is the king of the Earth Kingdom. In his first appearance, he is shown to have been tricked by his chancellor, who kept the war with the Fire Nation a secret from him.

*'''Hakoda''' (voiced by [[AndrÃ© Sogliuzzo]]) is Katara's and Sokka's father and the leader of the Southern Water Tribe. Much of Sokka's ingenuity and craftiness in the show is attributed to Hakoda's teachings. Hakoda went to fight the Fire Nation before the beginning of the series, reappearing later to lead his son's invasion.

*'''Haru''' (voiced by Michael Dow) is an Earthbender that Sokka, Aang, and Katara meet in the first season, and whom they assist freeing his father and other Earthbenders from the Fire Nation. Like many other characters, he appears later in an invasion of the Fire Nation.

*'''Tyro''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]]) is an Earthbender and the father of Haru.

*'''Jeong Jeong''' (voiced by [[Keone Young]]) is one of Aang's firebending teachers; a former admiral of the Fire Nation's navy, who lives in exile with his followers.

He utilizes the Dai Li, Ba Sing Se's cultural protectors, to silence anyone who is disrupting the peace, secretly imprisoning them and using hypnotic tactics to subdue them. This effectively keeps the citizens of Ba Sing Se in ignorance of the war until Ba Sing Se is captured by the Fire Nation.

*'''Joo Dee''' (voiced by [[Lauren Tom]]) is a woman in Ba Sing Se, who appears as the protagonists' hostess but later turns out to be one of the Dai Li.  She shows little emotion at all and, despite seeming brainwashed, understands the city's situation.  She is not seen after the episode &quot;[[Lake Laogai]]&quot;.

*'''June''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) is a bounty hunter who travels around the Earth Kingdom.   She hunts her prey with the help of her mount, a giant beast called a Shirshu, named Nyla, which is totally blind but possesses a heightened sense of smell.

*'''Avatar Kyoshi''' (voiced by [[Jennifer Hale]]) was the incarnation immediately preceding Avatar Roku, 412 years before the start of the series. Kyoshi is described as a gigantic woman, possessing the largest feet of any Avatar, and lived to be 230 years old. Her traditional weapons are golden metal fans which, in addition to her manner of dress and style of fighting, were adopted by the young warrior women of Kyoshi Island, which she detached from the mainland to defy a self-stimulated conqueror.

*'''Longshot''' is another member of the Freedom Fighters. He accompanies Jet and Smellerbee to Ba Sing Se. He rarely speaks, until the final episode in which he appears, &quot;Lake Laogai&quot;.

*'''Nyla''' is a male Shirshu (an immense, musteline-like predator), who served as the mount and companion of the bounty hunter June. Characteristic of his species Nyla's tongue contains neurotoxins that temporarily paralyze a human being. Also like other Shirshu, Nyla has no eyes and &quot;sees&quot; by his powerful scent receptors; a trait utilized by Sokka by tipping [[perfume]]s into Nyla's path.

*'''The Mechanist''' (voiced by [[Rene Auberjonois]]) is a brilliant and eccentric inventor and engineer from the Earth Kingdom who led his people into the mountains to take up residence in the abandoned Northern Air Temple when their village was destroyed by a flood.  His ingenious inventions, some inspired by the Airbenders, made his people's lives easier.  Because of his scientific approach to the world, he becomes friends with Sokka, and they develop a number of devices together.  Unfortunately, his abilities come to the attention of the Fire Nation and he is coerced into developing a number of machines, redeeming himself after he breaks the arrangement and helps Aang repel the Fire Nation when they raid the temple.  He later aids the invasion on the Day of the Black Sun with numerous new inventions, including waterbending-powered submarines.  When the invasion fails, he is captured and later reunited with his son Teo after the war.

*'''Teo''' (voiced by [[Daniel Samonas]]) is the Mechanist's son, rendered [[paraplegic]] and wheelchair-bound after a flood destroyed their village and killed Teo's mother.  To give his son and the villagers a new and happier life, the Mechanist led them into the mountains, where Teo became adept with at flying on a special glider.  A kind-hearted, respectful, and honest boy, he soon becomes friends with Aang. After discovering that his father has been reluctantly creating machines for the Fire Nation, Teo aids Aang repelling Fire Nation raiders.  He returns during the invasion of the Day of the Black Sun, but is forced to separate from his father when the Avatar's group is forced to surrender.  He accompanies Aang to the Western Air Temple and befriends Haru and the Duke before the Avatar's group is forced to flee when Azula attacks the temple.  He is reunited with his father after the war.

*'''Master Pakku''' (voiced by [[Victor Brandt]]) is a Waterbending master and instructor of the North Pole's Northern Water Tribe Waterbending classes. He is dryly sarcastic and very serious about his teachings. He is also stubbornly set in the customs of his culture, as by only teaching Waterbending to male students; but his ways change after identifying Katara as the granddaughter of his runaway fiancee Kanna, whom he later marries.

*'''Master Piandao''' (voiced by [[Robert Patrick]]) is a swordsmith and master of swordsmanship, based in the Fire Nation, who teaches a foundation of his skills to Sokka. He is later shown assisting the others of the White Lotus in recapturing Ba Sing Se. 

*'''Smellerbee''' (voiced by [[Nika Futterman]]) is a Freedom Fighter.  She was first seen in the episode &quot;Jet&quot;, wherein she helped destroy a dam. She is later accompanying Jet and Longshot to Ba Sing Se, but leaves Jet after watching him become obsessed with proving that Iroh and Zuko are Firebenders. She and Longshot are not seen after Jet is killed in &quot;Lake Laogai&quot;.

*'''The Duke''' (voiced by [[Mitch Holleman]] in Book 1, and [[Nick Swoboda]] in Book 3) is the youngest of the Freedom Fighters. He does not accompany Jet to Ba Sing Se but is later seen with Pipsqueak in the Black Sun invasion force. He goes with Aang to the Western Air Temple after the invasion's failure, and is seperated from them after Azula's attack. He is also seen hugging Toph at the end of the finale.

*'''Pipsqueak''' (voiced by [[Sterling Young]]) is the largest and strongest of the Freedom Fighters, despite his name. He joins the invasion against the Fire Nation and is taken captive when it fails. He is seen again at the end of the finale. He is friends with The Duke.

*'''Xin Fu''' (voiced by [[Marc Graue]]) was a promoter and host of an earth-bending prizefighting ring who later becomes a bounty hunter, hired by Toph's father to bring her home. He works with Earthbending instructor turned bounty hunter Master Yu to accomplish this. While dearching for Toph, he also briefly pursues Zuko and Iroh. He succeeds in capturing Toph in a metal box, but she manages to escape by creating Metalbending and proceeds to seal him and Master Yu inside. Neither of them are shown again after this.

*'''The Boulder''' (voiced by [[Mick Foley]]) is an earthbender first seen in the episode &quot;The Blind Bandit&quot; as a prizefighter; but who re-appears during the attempt to invade the Fire Nation. He speaks of himself in the third person, and his name is thought a [[parody]] of [[Dwayne Johnson|The Rock]].

*'''Big Bad Hippo''' (voiced by [[Kevin Michael Richardson]] is an opponent of Boulder's in an Earthbending match, and later appears with him in the invasion. He is a tall, heavy man with 4 especially-prominent teeth, and is possibly a parody of [[King Hippo]] of the ''Punch-Out!!'' franchise.

*'''Fire Lord Sozin''' (voiced by [[Ron Perlman]]) was the Fire Lord who started the [[World war|war]] with the other nations. In a flashback, it is shown that he was once friends with Avatar Roku, but disobeyed his advice against war and later permitted his death. With the Avatar no longer there to maintain balance, Sozin wiped out the Air Nomads using the power of a nearby [[comet]], which was renamed Sozin's Comet in his honour. It is hinted that, in his last moments before [[death]], Sozin regretted his actions.

==Organizations==
The following is a list of collective entities within the fictional universe.

*'''Freedom Fighters''' - First encountered in &quot;[[#Jet|Jet]]&quot;, this rag-tag group led by episode's namesake and operates out of the forests in the Earth Kingdom. The group consists of its leader [[#J|Jet]] and his subordinates [[#P|Pipsqueak]], [[#S|Smellerbee]], Longshot, Duke, and Sneers.

* '''Kyoshi Warriors''' - A group of female warriors from Kyoshi Island, led by [[Suki (Avatar: The Last Airbender)|Suki]], resembling Avatar Kyoshi in costume and fighting-style.  Ty Lee joins the group at the end of the series.

*'''Sandbenders''' - Earthbenders who specialize in bending sand.  They are nomads who live in a great desert in the Earth Kingdom.

*'''Order of the White Lotus''' - An international organization of teachers, philosophers, and warriors, who value knowledge and wisdom above all else.

*'''Dai Li''' - The [[secret police]] and cultural enforcers of Ba Sing Se, usurped by Princess Azula until she banishes them shortly before her coronation as Firelord.  The group had originally been created by Avatar Kyoshi to protect the social conventions of Ba Sing Se, but had become corrupt over time.

==Reception==
The characters of ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' received both praise and criticism from reviewers. Troy Island Mell, of [[IGN]], felt that the story &quot;would [not] be anywhere near as good as it is without its ability to create such strong characters&quot;. In particular, Mell enjoyed the development of Katara and Zuko throughout the first season, but thought that Zuko's relationship with his uncle was not &quot;very organic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/879/879027p1.html IGN Season 1 Review|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender â Season 1 Review|publisher=IGN|author=Mell, Tory Ireland|date=June 4, 2008|accessdate=March 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jamie S. Rich of [[DVDTalk]] generally agreed with Mell's assessment of the characters. Rich also praised the fact that, unlike many cartoon television series, ''Avatar'' introduces antagonists that have a deep backstory and &quot;are [not] just evil for the sake of it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/30417/avatar-the-last-airbender-the-complete-book-2-collection/|title=Avatar The Last Airbender - The Complete Book 2 Collection|publisher=DVDTalk|date=September 11, 2007|author=Rich, Jamie S.|accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeremy Mullin, another IGN reviewer, felt that the characters were not brilliantly done, though he noted that they introduced some drama and romantic tension usually not found on Nickelodeon, especially between Aang and Katara.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/741/741838p1.html|title=Avatar - Season 1 - Review|author=Mullin, Jeremy|publisher=IGN|date=October 25, 2006|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lair of the Green Knight and DVD Verdict also enjoyed the romantic tension, focusing mainly on the female cast: Katara, Toph, and Azula, as well as the two minor characters, Mai and Ty Lee. Fitz at Lair of the Green Knight lauded the decision to not stereotypically fashion the woman into the &quot;usual weak female characters&quot; but to instead give them &quot;strong opinions and strength&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://writer.fitzhome.com/cartoons/dvd-review-avatar-the-last-airbender-the-complete-book-3-collection/|title=Avatar â Season 1 â Review|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]] also compared character relationships, complimenting &quot;Sokka and Princess Yue's forbidden love&quot; while criticizing Iroh and Zuko's relationship as not being executed properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/875/875015p1.html|title=Avatar: The Last Airbender - &quot;The Siege of the North, Part 1&quot; Review|publisher=IGN|author=Mell, Tory Ireland|date=May 18, 2008|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; DVDVerdict felt that some minor characters, especially Mai and Ty Lee, were &quot;love em' or hate em'&quot; characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/avatarvol1.php|title=DVDverdict Review|publisher=DVDverdict|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gabriel Powers of DVDActive thought that while the characters fit into neat &quot;[[archetype]]s&quot;, it was not a bad thing and fit well with the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dvdactive.com/reviews/dvd/avatar-the-last-airbender-book-3-collection.html|title=Avatar Review|publisher=DVD Active|accessdate=May 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, ''Avatar'' was awarded a [[Peabody Award|Peabody]] for its &quot;unusually complex characters&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.peabody.uga.edu/news/event.php?id=59|title=Peabody 2008 Winners|publisher=[[Peabody Awards]]|accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the cartoon one of few animations to win the award and the only one to be cited for its character development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.animationinsider.net/article.php?articleID=2044|title='AVATAR' Animation Wins Peabody Award|publisher=Animation Insider|author=Bynum, Aaron H.|date=April 3, 2009|accessdate=July 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casting==
{{See also|The Last Airbender#Casting}}
[[File:Sokkakatara.jpg|300px|thumb|Katara and Sokka as depicted in the third season of the cartoon (left) and film (right). The casting of white actors to portray dark-skinned characters sparked controversy and accusations of racism against the studio and casting agencies.]]
[[M. Night Shyamalan]] originally offered the roles of Aang to [[Noah Ringer]]; Sokka to [[Jackson Rathbone]]; Katara to [[Nicola Peltz]]; and Zuko to [[Jesse McCartney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Nicole Sperling|title=Shyamalan lines up his cast for 'The Last Airbender'|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=2008-12-10|url=http://hollywoodinsider.ew.com/2008/12/shyamalan-casts.html|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In selecting Nicola Peltz, Shyamalan commented that he did not want to make ''The Last Airbender'' without her, saying that &quot;I said that only once before in my career, and that was when I met [[Haley Joel Osment|Haley]] in ''[[The Sixth Sense]]'' auditions.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Dyball |first=Rennie |url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20340703,00.html |title=3 Reasons to Watch for Actress Nicola Peltz - Movie News, M.

The casting of all-[[white people|white]] actors for main protagonist roles in the live-action, Asian-influenced film triggered a negative reaction which was marked by accusations of racism, a letter-writing campaign, and a protest outside of a [[Philadelphia]] casting call for movie extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Graeme McMillan|title=Avatar Casting Makes Fans See...

It's one of those things where, hopefully, the audience will suspend disbelief a little bit.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Larry Carroll|title='Twilight' Star Jackson Rathbone Hopes To 'Show His Range' In 'Last Airbender'|work=[[MTV]]|date=January 15, 2009|url=http://www.mtv.com/movies/news/articles/1602757/story.jhtml|accessdate=January 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaun Toub, who plays Iroh, also defended the casting choices. He noted that &quot;if they would have put all Asians in a certain nation, I think then there would be people who come out and said, âWell, now you're stereotyping, saying that anything that has to do with martial arts has to do with Asians and chop suey and all that.' So it's nice to mix it up and just do the unexpected.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;LA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-ca-air-bender-20100502,0,434688.story|title=On the set: Casting of âLast Airbenderâ stirs controversy|publisher=''[[Los Angeles Times]]''|author=Adams, Sam|date=May 2, 2010|accessdate=May 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Movie critic [[Roger Ebert]] was one of the critical voices against the casting decision. When asked about selection of primarily white actors to portray the characters, he said, &quot;The original series ''Avatar: The Last Airbender'' was highly regarded and popular for three seasons on Nickelodeon. Its fans take it for granted that its heroes are Asian. Why would Paramount and Shyamalan go out of their way to offend these fans? There are many young Asian actors capable of playing the parts.&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Roger Ebert|title=Answer Man|accessdate= December 26, 2009|date= December 23, 2009|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/section?category=ANSWERMAN&amp;date=20091223|work=[[Roger Ebert]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jevon Phillips of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' noted that despite Shyamalan's attempts to defuse the situation, the issue will &quot;not fade away or be overlooked&quot;, and that this film exemplifies the need for a debate within Hollywood about racial diversity in its films.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/comments_blog/2010/04/the-last-airbender-causes-a-casting-commotion.html|title=
