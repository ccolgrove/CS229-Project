'''Imperial Medicals Rugby Club''' (&quot;Imperial Medics&quot;) is the name given to the [[rugby union]] team of [[Imperial College School of Medicine Students' Union]], a modern amalgam of three formerly distinct hospital rugby clubs each with a long history, having all been founded in the nineteenth century. The teams from [[Charing Cross Hospital]]
and [[Chelsea &amp; Westminster Hospital|Westminster Hospital]] were the first to merge in 1984 following the union of their respective Medical Departments. When [[St Mary's Hospital, London]] also merged in 1997 the team was strengthened by one of the two most successful hospital sides in London. Imperial Medics is notable for its recent dominance of the oldest competition in rugby, the [[United Hospitals Cup]], as well as its history and the joint history of its constituent elements which have produced a large number of international players.
