'''State elections''' were held in [[Australia]] on 15 September 1979. All 47 seats in the [[South Australian House of Assembly]] were up for election. The incumbent [[Australian Labor Party]] led by [[Premiers of South Australia|Premier]] of South Australia [[Des Corcoran]] was defeated by the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] led by [[Leader of the Opposition (South Australia)|Leader of the Opposition]] [[David Tonkin]].

A [[Norwood state by-election, 1980|Norwood by-election]] was held due to the seat's election result being overturned by a court decision, which saw the seat lost from the Liberals to Labor, which meant the Liberals held 24 seats with Labor on 20 seats.

==Background==
Parliamentary elections for both houses of the [[Parliament of South Australia]] were held in [[South Australia]] in 1979, which saw [[David Tonkin]] and the Liberal party defeat the incumbent [[Australian Labor Party]] led by [[Des Corcoran]], after being premier for only seven months after [[Don Dunstan]]s sudden resignation due to ill health.

Spurred by positive opinion polls and seeking to escape the shadow of Dunstan, Corcoran called a snap election (without pre-informing the party apparatus) in order to gain a mandate of his own.  The election campaign was plagued by problems, [[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] was biased toward the Liberal campaign, and the Labor Party suffered a large swing against it.  Corcoran was bitter in defeat, believing sections of the ALP had undermined him during the campaign. Corcoran resigned as leader in [[1979]] and retired from politics in [[1982]].

Tonkin quickly gained a reputation as a progressive member of the LCL and was an early supporter of the [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]] faction created by former premier [[Steele Hall]], although Tonkin remained with the LCL when the Liberal Movement split from it.

Tonkin first gained statewide prominence in 1974 when he successfully introduced a private member's bill to outlaw sex discrimination, the first such law in [[Australia]].  This prominence led to a successful 1975 challenge to LCL parliamentary leader [[Bruce Eastick]] for the party leadership.

As leader, Tonkin worked toward healing the internal party wounds caused from the split of the Liberal Movement by coaxing the Liberal Movement back into the Liberal fold, which allowed the [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal Party]] to regain government at the 1979 election against a seemingly disunited [[Australian Labor Party]].

==[[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]] Results==
The two [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]] members elected in 1975 had rejoined the Liberal Party.

In 1982, Labor MLC [[Norman Foster (Australian politician)|Norm Foster]] resigned from the Labor Party (to vote in favour of the [[Olympic Dam]] development) and sat the remainder of his term (until the [[South Australian state election, 1982|1982 election]]) as an independent.
