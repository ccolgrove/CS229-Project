'''Mmbara Hulisani Kevin''' (born 1979) is the former President (2007â2009) of [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO (the Pan Africanist Youth Congress)]], a youth wing of PAC ([[Pan Africanist Congress]] Of Azania) in South Africa.
Hulisani made news headlines when he took a defiant stance against the current president of PAC (Mr. [[Letlapa Mphahlele]]), even going to the extent of calling for his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news24.com/News24/South_Africa/Politics/0,,2-7-12_2248861,00.html |title=PAC 'facing leadership crisis' |publisher=News24 article |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Hulisani was born in the former homeland of [[Venda]], in South Africa, in 1979. 

Throughout his early life, there is no record to imply any interest in politics. It was only during high school, when Hulisani became the president of the SRC of Guvhukuvhu High School, in the village of Phiphidi in the former Venda; that it became apparent. His stay at the helm of the SRC was marked by a renewed politicalization of students who before had quietly lead their student lives. Unconfirmed reports places, a number of student marches in that school, during his reign as president of the SRC.

== Politics ==
=== Background ===
It is not clear as to when did Hulisani became a member of the PAC and PAYCO in particular. 

But before serving as the president of [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]], Hulisani held a number of positions within the ranks of the party including its student wing, PASMA and branches. He also served as the Secretary General of PAYCO before becoming the President&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Africa Live |url=http://uhurunews.com/radio/playaudio?resource_name=youth-month-in-occupied-azania-south-africa-2007-06-24-audio |title=An interview with Nyabinga Dzimbahwe of Uhuru News when Hulisani was Secretary General |publisher=Uhurunews.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulisani was also one of the voices that opposed the Floor-Crossing policy, championed and legislated by the [[African National Congress|ANC]] government, which allowed party representatives in parliament to move to another party while keeping their seat in parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dispatch.co.za/2005/09/06/editoria/letters.html |title=A letter to the editor of Dispatch on floor crossing |publisher=Dispatch.co.za |date=6 September 2005 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hulisani also worked as a Researcher for the [[Limpopo]] Legislature in 2003, working with [[Maxwel Nemadzivhanani]].,&lt;ref name=&quot;linkedin.com&quot;&gt;http://www.linkedin.com/pub/dir/hulisani/mmbara Hulisani's profile in LinkedIn&lt;/ref&gt; then Provincial chairman of PAC in Limpopo Province.

=== PAYCO Presidency ===

At a [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]] National Congress held in Durban, under the theme &quot;Mobilizing Youth Power to Build Socialism and African Unity&quot;, Hulisani was elected President of [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]] succeeding its former president [[Sbusiso Xaba]].

On March 2008, he condemned the racist video made by students from the [[Free State University]]. Of the acts portrayed in the video he said they  &quot;makes a mockery of the struggle
against apartheid settler colonialism,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://70.84.171.10/~etools/newsbrief/2008/news0303.txt A newsBrief of the incident&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 May 2009, Hulisani convened the 1st Mayihlome Annual Lecture, which was addressed by the former President of [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]], [[Mashao Matome]].The lecture was used as a forum to discuss a new programme adopted by [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]] called IOTA,&lt;ref&gt;IOTA stands for: Idiologize, Organize, for Takeover&lt;/ref&gt; which is aimed at repositioning the [[Pan Africanist Congress|PAC]]. On the same occasion an online News publication called &quot;Mayihlome&quot; was launched on [[WordPress]], Hulisani currently serves as its Chief Editor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mayihlome.wordpress.com/ |title=Mayihlome News |publisher=Mayihlome.wordpress.com |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]] Kimberly National Congress held in November 2009, Hulisani was succeeded by [[Ndebele Linda]] as president of  [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://payco.org.za/index.php/about-us/basic-information/history-of-payco |title=History of PAYCO |publisher=payco.org.za}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== African Socialist International(ASI) ===

Hulisani, in his capacity as an official of [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]], has a relationship with the ASI, an international body of socialists who pursue a pan-African agenda. In 2006, he had a meeting with ASI Chairman [[Omali Yeshitela]] and others, on his visit to South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uhurunews.com/story?resource_name=drum-spear-mmbara |title=Hulisani's article after the visit of Chairman Omali in UHURU News |publisher=Uhurunews.com |date=20 February 2009 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Controvesies}}Controversies ==

A number of controversies has followed the election of Hulisani as president of  [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]]. Some even calling them politically suicidal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feveronline.co.za/details.asp?StoNum=707&amp;pub=&amp;from=details%2Easp%3FStoNum%3D3643%26from%3Dindex%2Easp%253F |title=A Feveronline report on Payco leaders against Hulisani Mmbara's decision |publisher=Feveronline.co.za |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

=== Call for Lethlapa Mphahlele to step down ===

'''9 January 2008''': Hulisani, in a statement, called for the resignation of PAC president Lethlapa Mphahlele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-01-09-pac-youth-congress-rebels-against-party-leader |title=Mail&amp;Gurdian Report on the call for Lethlapa Mphahlele to step down |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position was met with strong objection among the leadership of the PAC, who even mentioned that [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]]did not qualify, as a component structure, to call for the resignation of the president of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mg.co.za/article/2008-01-09-pac-youth-congress-rebels-against-party-leader |title=Report on Mail&amp;Gurdian on Hulisani's statement |publisher=Mg.co.za |date=9 January 2008 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some provincial [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]]leaders distanced themselves from the decision and the pronouncement made by Hulisani, some even calling it unilateral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.feveronline.co.za/details.asp?StoNum=707&amp;pub=&amp;from=details%2Easp%3FStoNum%3D3643%26from%3Dindex%2Easp%253F |title=A Feveronline report on Hulisani's statement |publisher=Feveronline.co.za |date=25 January 2008 |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Hulisani insisted that the decision was not taken by his person but by the NEC of [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]], including the provincial leaders.

=== 2009 General Elections ===

'''30 January 2009''': a communication was made by the [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|PAYCO]] NEC, to the members, on the decision to boycott the 2009 General Elections of South Africa so as to refuse the [[Pan Africanist Congress|PAC]] votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/group/payco/browse_thread/thread/e85544a3238c5e40/4514b4d44efba702?lnk=gst&amp;q=2009+elections#4514b4d44efba702 |title=A communication on the position of PAYCO |publisher=Groups.google.com |date= |accessdate=6 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This position received some opposition from within the  [[Pan Africanist Youth Congress|Pan Africanist Youth Congress of Azania]], and was also against the position of [[Pan Africanist Congress|PAC]], as it participated in the elections.
