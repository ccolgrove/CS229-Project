'''Apache Lucene''' is a [[free software|free]]/[[open source software|open source]] [[information retrieval]] [[Library (computing)|software library]], originally created in [[Java (programming language)|Java]] by [[Doug Cutting]]. It is supported by the [[Apache Software Foundation]] and is released under the [[Apache Software License]].

Lucene has been ported to other programming languages including [[Object Pascal|Delphi]], [[Perl]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[C++]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] and [[PHP]].

==History==
Lucene was originally written by [[Doug Cutting]]. It was initially available for download from its home at the [[SourceForge]] web site. It joined the Apache Software Foundationâs [[Jakarta Project|Jakarta]] family of open source Java products in September 2001 and became its own top-level Apache project in February 2005. Until recently, it included a number of sub-projects, such as [[Lucene Java]], Droids, [[Lucene.net|Lucene.Net]], [[Lucy (Lucene)|Lucy]], [[Apache Mahout|Mahout]], [[Solr]], [[Nutch]], [[Open Relevance Project]], [[PyLucene]] and [[Apache Tika|Tika]].  Solr has been merged into the Lucene project itself and Mahout, Nutch and Tika have been moved to be independent top-level projects.

==Features and common use==
While suitable for any application which requires full text [[Index (search engine)|indexing]] and searching capability, Lucene has been widely recognized &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Machine Learning and Data Mining in Pattern Recognition: 5th International Conference |last=Perner |first=Petra |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2007 |publisher=Springer |location= |isbn=978-3-540-73498-7 |page=387 |pages= |url= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glscube.org/downloads/glscube_design.pdf GNU/Linux Semantic Storage System]&lt;/ref&gt; for its utility in the implementation of [[Internet search engine]]s and local, single-site searching.

At the core of Lucene's logical architecture is the idea of a '''document''' containing '''fields''' of text. This flexibility allows Lucene's API to be independent of the [[file format]]. Text from [[Portable Document Format|PDFs]], [[HTML]], [[Microsoft Word]], and [[OpenDocument]] documents, as well as many others (except images), can all be indexed as long as their textual information can be extracted.

== Lucene-based projects ==
Lucene itself is just an indexing and search library and does not contain [[web spider|crawling]] and HTML [[parsers|parsing]] functionality.  However, several projects extend Lucene's capability:
* Apache [[Nutch]] provides web crawling and HTML parsing
* Apache [[Solr]] â an enterprise search server
* [[ElasticSearch]]  â an enterprise search server. 
* [[Compass Project|Compass]] â a Java Search Engine Framework

== Users ==

For a list of companies that use Lucene (rather than extend), see Lucene's [http://wiki.apache.org/lucene-java/PoweredBy PoweredBy] page. As an example Twitter is using Lucene for its real time search&lt;ref name=&quot;twitter&quot;&gt;Twitter uses Lucene [http://techcrunch.com/2010/10/06/new-twitter-search/]&lt;/ref&gt;
