The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Miami Dolphins]] season''' was the organization's 39th season in the [[National Football League]] and 43rd overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Miami Dolphins History|work = NFL-History.com|url = http://www.nfl-history.com/dolphins.php|accessdate =2008-01-02|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090201202808/http://www.nfl-history.com/dolphins.php |archivedate = February 1, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the regular season the Dolphins completed the greatest single-season turnaround in NFL history,&lt;ref&gt;http://beatthesportsbook.com/home/?p=10901  {{Wayback|url=http://beatthesportsbook.com/home/?p=10901|date =20110707220437}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/columnists/greg_cote/story/822086.html  {{Wayback|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/sports/columnists/greg_cote/story/822086.html|date =20110521234138}}&lt;/ref&gt; going from a 1â15 regular season record in 2007 to an 11â5 record in 2008. The previous standard for improvement one year after a 1â15 season belonged to the 1992 Indianapolis Colts, who went 9â7.  The 1999 Indianapolis Colts were the only other team to accomplish a 10-game turnaround, winning 13 games after winning 3 in 1998. Additionally, Miami won the [[AFC East]], becoming the first team in NFL history to win their division after only having one win the previous season.

The offseason also saw the departure of two [[Pro Bowl]]ers and long-time Dolphins with the release of [[linebacker]] [[Zach Thomas]] and trade of [[defensive end]] [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]].

==Offseason personnel moves==
===Front office===
On December 27, 2007, Dolphins owner [[Wayne Huizenga]] hired former NFL head coach and [[ESPN]] analyst [[Bill Parcells]] as Executive Vice President of Football Operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ParcellsHired&quot; /&gt; Parcells signed a four-year deal with the Dolphins less than a day after turning down a similar offer from the [[Atlanta Falcons]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ParcellsFalcons&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Parcells signs four-year deal to head Dolphins' football operations | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3162909 | accessdate = 2 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just a few days after Parcells' hiring, three men were dismissed from the Dolphins' front office.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerFired&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Three Leave Dolphins | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5617 | accessdate = 2 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080103113349/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5617 |archivedate = January 3, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of which was general manager [[Randy Mueller]], who was hired by the team in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerHired&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Randy Mueller hired as Dolphins GM | work = USAToday.com | url = http://www.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/dolphins/2005-06-06-mueller-hired_x.htm | accessdate = 2 January 2008 | date=2005-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also dismissed were Assistant Director of Player Personnel Mike Baugh and College Scouting Coordinator Rick Thompson.&lt;ref name=&quot;MuellerFired&quot; /&gt;

Three days after Mueller's dismissal, Parcells hired [[Jeff Ireland]] as the team's new general manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrelandHired&quot; /&gt; Ireland had worked for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] the past seven years, including the last three as Vice President of College and Pro Scouting.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrelandHired&quot; /&gt; Ireland had worked with Parcells previously, when the latter was head coach of the Cowboys from 2003 to 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrelandHired&quot; /&gt; Although Ireland was officially given final say on personnel decisions, it was speculated that Parcells was actually in control, and did not hold the title of General Manager so that the team may hire a front office executive from another team.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinalSay&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =  Tuna helper on the menu for afternoon introduction | work = DolphinsInDeth.blogspot.com | url = http://dolphinsindepth.blogspot.com/2007/12/tuna-helper-on-menu-for-afternoon.html | accessdate =  6 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, the Dolphins reeled in another former Cowboys executive when they hired [[Brian Gaine]] as Assistant Director of Player Personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrianGaine&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =  Brian Gaine Named Assistant Director Of Player Personnel | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5634 | accessdate =  16 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080119103615/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5634 |archivedate = January 19, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaine had previously spent the past three seasons as the Cowboys' Assistant Director of Pro Scouting, working with both Parcells and Ireland during that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrianGaine&quot; /&gt;

Following the [[2008 NFL Draft]], it was reported on May 1 that the Dolphins had fired scouts [[Ellis Rainsberger]], [[Jack Glowik]] and [[Roger Pollard]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ScoutsFired&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =  Fins Firing Scouts | work = ProFootballTalk.com | url = http://www.profootballtalk.com/2008/05/01/fins-firing-scouts/ | accessdate =  5 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team's vice president of media relations, [[Harvey Greene]], said Rainsberger had retired and did not comment on the other two reported firings.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScoutsFired&quot;/&gt;

===Coaches===
====Head coach====
Just one day after hiring of [[Jeff Ireland]] as general manager, the Dolphins fired head coach [[Cam Cameron]] after just one season on the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronFired&quot; /&gt; Cameron led the Dolphins to an NFL worst 1â15 record in 2007, which was also the worst in franchise history.&lt;ref name=&quot;nfl&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 2007 NFL Regular Season Standings | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/standings?category=div&amp;season=2007-REG&amp;split=Overall | accessdate =  3 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;2007record&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Miami Dolphins Team Encyclopedia | work = pro-football-reference.com | url = http://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/mia/ | accessdate =  3 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, all but two members of the coaching staff were dismissed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronFired&quot; /&gt; The only coaches retained were assistant special teams coach [[Steve Hoffman (American football)|Steve Hoffman]] and linebackers coach [[George Edwards (American football)|George Edwards]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CameronFired&quot; /&gt; Both Hoffman and Edwards were coaches for the [[Dallas Cowboys]] during Ireland's tenure with the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;IrelandHired&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;HoffmanBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Profile â Steve Hoffman | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_hoffman_s.asp | accessdate =  3 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071019161508/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_hoffman_s.asp |archivedate = October 19, 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdwardsBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Profile â George Edwards | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_edwards_g.asp | accessdate =  3 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090226012635/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/team/coachingstaff/coachingstaff_edwards_g.asp |archivedate = February 26, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A search for Cameron's replacement began almost immediately after his firing.&lt;ref name=&quot;CoachSearch&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins can Cameron, search for new coach | work = Herald.com | url = http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/365360.html | accessdate =  4 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110521211430/http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/365360.html |archivedate = May 21, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various candidates were rumored, many of which had some connection to Parcells and/or Ireland.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClaytonCandidates&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Parcells wants his own guy, so Cameron's out | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=clayton_john&amp;id=3178799 | accessdate =  4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rumored candidates included [[Cleveland Browns]] head coach [[Romeo Crennel]], [[Dallas Cowboys]] assistant [[Tony Sparano]], Cowboys secondary coach [[Todd Bowles]], [[Arizona Cardinals]] running backs coach [[Maurice Carthon]] and Cardinals offensive coordinator [[Todd Haley]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ClaytonCandidates&quot; /&gt; Additionally, [[Baltimore Ravens]] defensive coordinator [[Rex Ryan]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] defensive coordinator [[Leslie Frazier]] were contacted.&lt;ref name=&quot;RyanContacted&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins contact Rex Ryan | work = Sun-Sentinel.com | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/football/pro/dolphins/sfl-dolryan010307,0,2496419.story | accessdate =  4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FrazierInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins will interview Vikings' Frazier | work = Herald.com | url = http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/366020.html | accessdate =  4 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110521211446/http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/366020.html |archivedate = May 21, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' suggested that [[Washington Redskins]] defensive coordinator [[Gregg Williams]] could be a candidate as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;GreggWilliamsRumor&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Taylor's Dad Thanks Team for Its Support | work = WashingtonPost.com | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/06/AR2008010602038.html | accessdate =  7 January 2008 | first1=Paul | last1=Tenorio | first2=Jason | last2=Reid | date=2008-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first interview scheduled was Sparano, who met with the Dolphins on Saturday, January 11.&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins to interview Sparano Saturday | work = Sun-Sentinel.com | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/football/pro/dolphins/sfl-0104sporano,0,5058179.story?coll=sofla_tab01_layout | accessdate =  4 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sparano had previously met with the [[Atlanta Falcons]] and [[Baltimore Ravens]] regarding their head coaching vacancies.&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoWillAccept&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Source: Sparano will take Dolphins job | work = NHRegister.com | url = http://www.nhregister.com/WebApp/appmanager/JRC/BigDaily?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=pg_article&amp;r21.content=/MAIN_REP/Article/2008/01/05/1373966 | accessdate =  6 January 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 6, it was reported that Sparano would be offered the Dolphins' head coaching job, and that he would accept.&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoWillAccept&quot; /&gt; The Dolphins denied the report later that day, saying it was an initial interview only and that the team had interviews with others planned over the next few days.&lt;ref name=&quot;DenySparanoReport&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins deny report they offered Sparano coaching job | work = Sun-Sentinel.com | url = http://www.sun-sentinel.com/sports/football/pro/dolphins/sfl-doldeny010607,0,1976725.story | accessdate =  7 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the addition of quarterbacks coach [[David Lee (American football coach)|David Lee]], a former Cowboys assistant, fueled speculation that Sparano was indeed going to the next head coach of the Miami Dolphins.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidLeeHired&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins hire QB coach with tie to Cowboys | work = Herald.com | url = http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/370080.html | accessdate =  7 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110521211450/http://www.miamiherald.com/616/story/370080.html |archivedate = May 21, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PFTLeeSpeculation&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Fins situation gets even fishier | work = ProFootballTalk.com | url = http://beta.profootballtalk.com/2008/01/07/fins-situation-gets-even-fishier/ | accessdate =  7 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team then proceeded to interview Frazier, Ryan and [[Tennessee Titans]] defensive coordinator [[Jim Schwartz]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FrazierRyan&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Ryan interviews with Dolphins after talking to Ravens | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3187335 | accessdate =  16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SchwartzInterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins Confirm Interview With Schwartz | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5632 | accessdate =  16 January 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080118133522/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5632 |archivedate = January 18, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Dallas Cowboys]] lost to the [[New York Giants]] in the divisional round of the [[NFL playoffs, 2007-08#NFC: New York Giants 21, Dallas Cowboys 17|2007 NFL playoffs]] on January 13,&lt;ref name=&quot;CowboysLoss&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = NFL Game Center: Post Game â New York Giants at Dallas Cowboys â 2007 Division Playoffs | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter?season=2007&amp;week=POST20&amp;game_id=29523 | accessdate =  16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; speculation grew that Sparano's hiring was imminent.&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoESPN&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Of four candidates, Cowboys' Sparano out front for Dolphins job | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3196640 | accessdate =  16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoSalgueroBlog&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =  Pieces fall into place for Dolphins hiring of coach | work = Herald.com | url = http://dolphinsindepth.blogspot.com/2008/01/pieces-fall-into-place-for-dolphins.html | accessdate =  16 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 16, the Dolphins ended their search by naming Sparano the eighth head coach in franchise history.&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoHired&quot; /&gt; He received a four-year contract believed to be worth between $2.5 and $2.7 million per season.&lt;ref name=&quot;SparanoContract&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title =  Dolphins hire Sparano as head coach, replacing Cameron | work = ESPN.com | url = http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3199065 | accessdate =  17 January 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Assistants====
Parcells and Ireland made their first coaching staff addition on January 7, luring [[Ole Miss Rebels football|Ole Miss]] offensive coordinator [[David Lee (American football coach)|David Lee]] to be [[quarterback]]s coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidLeeHired&quot; /&gt; Lee, who briefly followed [[Houston Nutt]] to Ole Miss after serving as his offensive coordinator at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] in 2007, worked with Parcells and Ireland as the Cowboys' quarterbacks coach from 2003 to 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidLeeHired&quot; /&gt; The addition fueled speculation that Sparano was indeed going to the next head coach of the Miami Dolphins.&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidLeeHired&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PFTLeeSpeculation&quot; /&gt;

Two days after hiring Sparano as their head coach, the Dolphins made their second assistance coach hiring. On January 18, [[Mike Maser]] was named the team's new offensive line coach. Maser had previously served in the same capacity for the [[Carolina Panthers]] from 2003 to 2006, and worked with Sparano when both were assistants for the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in 2002.

Over the next week, the Dolphins filled various positions on Sparano's staff. On January 22, former [[Kansas City Chiefs]] running backs coach [[James Saxon (American football)|James Saxon]] was hired in the same capacity for the Dolphins.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaxsonMarcus&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins Add Marcus And Saxon To Coaching Staff | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5646 | accessdate =  12 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080229044800/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5646 |archivedate = February 29, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also hired that day was former [[Atlanta Falcons]] strength and conditioning coach [[Evan Marcus]], who took the same job with Miami.&lt;ref name=&quot;SaxsonMarcus&quot; /&gt;

On January 23, the Dolphins added four more assistant coaches to their staff when they named [[Paul Pasqualoni]] as their defensive coordinator, [[Todd Bowles]] as assistant head coach/secondary, [[Kacy Rodgers]] as defensive line coach and [[David Corrao]] as defensive quality control coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;FourCoachesHired&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dolphins Add Four Coaches To Staff | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5650 | accessdate =  12 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080221183736/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5650 |archivedate = February 21, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pasqualoni, Bowles and Rodgers all came from the [[Dallas Cowboys]]' staff, while Corrao was most recently linebackers coach at the [[Ole Miss Rebels|University of Mississippi]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FourCoachesHired&quot; /&gt;

====Final staff====
When the Dolphins' coaching staff was completed with the hiring of offensive coordinator [[Dan Henning]] on February 14, only two of the 17 assistant coaches under Sparano (Edwards and Hoffman) were holdovers from the previous season's staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;StaffComplete&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Sparano Completes Staff Of &quot;Idea People&quot; | work = MiamiDolphins.com | url = http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5676 | accessdate =  12 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080211064616/http://www.miamidolphins.com/newsite/news/top_story.asp?contentID=5676 |archivedate = February 11, 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the new coaches (Bowles, Pasqualoni and Rodgers) had experience with Parcells, Ireland and Sparano in Dallas.&lt;ref name=&quot;StaffComplete&quot; /&gt; The completed staff was as follows:

'''Notes'''
* The Dolphins own second-round pick, the first of the round, was the 32nd overall in the draft rather than the 33rd because the [[New England Patriots]] forfeited their first-round pick (31st overall) after the [[2007 National Football League videotaping controversy|Spygate]] incident.&lt;ref name=&quot;FirstOverallPick&quot; /&gt;
* The Dolphins acquired a second-round pick from the [[San Diego Chargers]] in a trade that sent [[wide receiver]] [[Chris Chambers]] to San Diego on October 16, 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ChambersTrade&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Chargers trade for Chris Chambers | work = Scout.com | url = http://sdg.scout.com/2/691409.html | accessdate =  3 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first day of the draft, the Dolphins traded second-year running back [[Lorenzo Booker]] to the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in exchange for a fourth-round pick (115th overall) in the [[2008 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BookerToEagles&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Eagles give up first-round draft pick, acquire RB Booker from 'Fins | work = NFL.com | url = http://www.nfl.com/draft/story?id=09000d5d807ff74b&amp;template=without-video&amp;confirm=true | accessdate =  5 May 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the second day of the draft, the Dolphins acquired the [[Detroit Lions]]' third-round pick (66th overall) as well as their sixth-round pick (176th overall) in exchange for the Dolphins' third-round pick (64th overall).&lt;ref name=&quot;LionsTrade&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Lions take RB K.

The Dolphins headed to Foxboro to face the Division rival New England Patriots. Little did New England know that they would be a test for an offensive formation concocted as the Dolphins coaching staff wanted to put running backs [[Ricky Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]] onto the field at the same time.  David Lee thus revealed the ''[[Wildcat formation|Wildcat]]'' to the NFL. [[Ronnie Brown]] would take direct snaps and keep it himself or hand it of to another back.  The Dolphins decimated the Patriots all day with the Wildcat offense for a 38â13 victory.

Entering the postseason as the AFC's #3 seed, the Dolphins began their playoff run at home in the AFC Wild Card Round, with a Week 7 rematch against the #6 [[Baltimore Ravens]].  Miami would deliver the game's first points with rookie kicker [[Dan Carpenter]]'s 19-yard field goal.  The Ravens would later respond with a 23-yard field goal from kicker [[Matt Stover]].  Baltimore would take the lead with safety [[Ed Reed]] returning a [[Chad Pennington]] interception 64&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown.  The Ravens would then close out the half with Stover's 31-yard field goal.

Baltimore would increase their lead in the third quarter with running back [[Le'Ron McClain]]'s 8-yard touchdown run.  The Dolphins tried to come back in the fourth quarter as Pennington completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Ronnie Brown]] (with a failed PAT), but the Ravens would pull away as quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] got a 5-yard touchdown run.

With the loss, Miami's impressive turnaround season ended with an overall record of 11â6.

Despite having only 16 turnovers throughout the entire regular season, the Dolphins committed 5 turnovers (4 interceptions and a lost fumble).
