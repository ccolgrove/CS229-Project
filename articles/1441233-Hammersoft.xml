'''Yet Another Previewer''' (or '''YAP''') is the name of two different document previewing applications, one for [[Device independent file format|DVI]] and one for [[PostScript]].

==PostScript==
The YAP for PostScript previewing is used to dynamically edit and re-render PostScript as if one was editing a file, unlike the actual PostScript interpreter itself (such as [[ghostscript]]), which deals with PostScript input interactively from a user. 

YAP first was bundled with the NeXT demos package of [[NeXTSTEP]], which was also bundled with [[OPENSTEP]]. It was not carried into its incarnation as [[Mac OS X]], presumably because of PostScript's lessened importance with the OS X subsystems relying on [[Display PDF]] instead.

==DVI==
The YAP for DVI viewing is a program bundled with the widely used [[MiKTeX]] [[TeX]] distribution for the [[Microsoft Windows]] platform. YAP allows zooming in and out by several integer factors, besides having a &quot;magnifying glass&quot; feature for local zooming. It supports [[PostScript]] specials (for instance, rendering [[LaTeX]] documents with [[PSTricks]]). Since YAP supports [[inverse search]] (when the DVI file was compiled with ''source specials''), it can be configured to launch a LaTeX editor for the source file, placing the cursor on the corresponding word under the cursor in YAP. However, unlike [[PDF]], there is no search facility. YAP is [[free software]] published under the [[GNU]] [[GNU General Public License|GPL]]. It was written by Christian Schenk.
