The '''Sazak assault''' was an ambush carried out in 1997, in the Sazak neighbourhood of [[ReÅadiye]], in [[Turkey]]'s [[Tokat Province]]. Four Turkish soldiers were killed in the ambush and although no group immediately claimed responsibility, the attack was later revealed to have been a joint operation by three [[Communist]] guerrilla groups: the separatist [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] and the Turkish [[Revolutionary People's Liberation PartyâFront]] and [[Communist Party of Turkey/MarxistâLeninist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;tensions&quot;/&gt;

The soldiers were returning to their outpost after a patroll and had only 1.3 kilometers left to travel when they were ambushed by a joint force of Kurdish PKK and Turkish DHKP/C and TKP-ML insurgents. Four soldiers were killed in the ambush and due to the heavy fog, all insurgents managed to escape.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=E83E8F162B372E3F47BF432EABEA4A96?newsId=195085 Govât poised to finalize reform package despite provocations]&lt;/ref&gt;

That same year period the PKK and DHKP/C were also involved in a joint attack on a local flour factory in Tokat, which killed 3 Turkish officials.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hri.org/news/agencies/trkpr/1997/97-07-09.trkpr.html#03 Turkish Press Review, 97-07-09]&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve years later, a similar attack was carried out in the same area, which left 7 soldiers dead&lt;ref name=&quot;tensions&quot;/&gt; and 3 injured.&lt;ref&gt;[[HÃ¼rriyet]] [http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=between-hearts-and-minds-2009-12-08 Between hearts and minds]&lt;/ref&gt;
