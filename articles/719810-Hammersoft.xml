'''Haskell Indian Nations University''' is a [[tribal university]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aihec.org/colleges/index.cfm] AIHEC: &quot;About Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs)&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; located in [[Lawrence, Kansas]], for members of federally recognized [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] [[tribe]]s in the [[United States]]. Founded in 1884 as a residential boarding-school for American Indian children,&lt;ref&gt;[http://diverseeducation.com/article/12608 HINU Commemorates 125th Anniversary&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; the school has evolved into an [[North Central Association]]-accredited university that offers both associate and baccalaureate degrees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/admission/index.html Haskell Informational Recruiting Video]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Enrollment at the campus is nearly 1,000 students per semester, representing approximately 140 Tribal Nations and Alaska Native communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell&quot;&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/about.html About Haskell]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with [[Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute]], Haskell is funded by the [[Bureau of Indian Education]]. As such, because of U.S. Trust Responsibility&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.findlaw.com/1999/May/20/132928.html The Federal Trust Responsibility in a Self-Determination Era]&lt;/ref&gt; to American Indian Tribes, Haskell does not charge tuition. However, students are responsible for paying semester fees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/haskell/admissions/financialaid.asp Welcome to Haskell Indian Nations University!&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   

Haskell is home to the [[Haskell Cultural Center and Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/cultural/index.html The Haskell Cultural Center and Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanindianathletichalloffame.com/ The American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Indian Leader]] (the oldest American Indian student newspaper in the country),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/student_life/indian_leader.html The Indian Leader]&lt;/ref&gt; numerous student clubs and organizations,&lt;ref name=&quot;Student Life&quot;&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/student_life/index.html Student Life]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork]], and the [[Haskell-Baker Wetlands]]. The renowned [[Rinehart Collection]] is housed in the Haskell Cultural Center. Numerous sculptures and murals are located throughout the campus. The University is one of 37 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aihec.org/colleges/TCUroster.cfm Tribal College and University Roster]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Indian Higher Education Consortium]], an organization for Tribal colleges and universities. Haskell also is a member of the [[American Council on Education]], The [[Council for Higher Education Accreditation]], [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]], and the [[National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf Haskell General Catalog, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The University enjoys a positive reputation for hosting cultural and academic events that attracts visitors (both American Indian and non-Indian) from across the country and abroad. These activities include the annual [[Haskell Indian Art Market]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/art_market/index.html Haskell Indian Art Market]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Stories-n-Motion Film Festival]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawrence.com/events/2011/apr/02/42903/ 7th Annual Stories-n-Motion Film Festival]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Haskell Commencement Pow-Wow.]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitlawrence.com/events/2840/haskell-indian-nations-commencement-native-american-pow-wow Haskell's Commencement &amp; Pow-Wow]&lt;/ref&gt; These public events are held along with numerous educational conferences, workshops, and presentations.    

Due to its unique history, visitors enjoy touring and learning about Haskell history and its campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitlawrence.com/attractions/haskell-indian-nations-university Lawrence Convention and Visitors Bureau: &quot;Haskell Indian Nations University&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; A self-guided Walking Tour map is available courtesy of the Haskell Cultural Center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/cultural/brochures/Walking%20Tour_combined.pdf &quot;Haskell Campus Walking Tour Map&quot; (2 pages;.pdf)]&lt;/ref&gt; Twelve campus buildings are U.S. [[National Historic Landmark]]s.

==History==
The history of Haskell Indian Nations University is a unique story, reflecting both U.S. Indian policy and self-determination efforts by Indian Country and Alaska Native communities. Haskell was founded during an era when [[Native American boarding schools]] were created as a way to undermine Tribes and Tribal Nations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asu.edu/lib/archives/boardingschools.htm ASU's Bibliography of Indian Boarding Schools: Approximately 1875 TO 1940]&lt;/ref&gt; From this original mission, Haskell has transformed into a Tribal-based university whose alumni work in numerous areas to serve Indian Country and Alaska Native communities.   

* '''1884''': Formed as the '''United States Indian Industrial Training School''', the school opened for 22 students, a number that increased to 400 within one semester. According to the university's website, the early trades for boys included tailoring, wagon making, blacksmithing, harness making, painting, shoe making, and farming. Girls studied cooking, sewing and homemaking. Most of the students' food was produced on the Haskell farm, and students were expected to participate in various industrial duties.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell&quot;/&gt;

* '''1887''': Name changed to '''Haskell Institute''' to honor [[Dudley Haskell]], the [[U.S. Representative]] responsible for the school being in Lawrence. Under a semi-military system, students wore uniforms, marched to classes and exercised regularly. Facilities included a brig, or jail for unruly students.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

* '''1894''': 606 students from 36 states.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

* '''1927''': High school classes were accredited by the state of Kansas, and Haskell also began offering post high school courses in a variety of areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell, page 5&quot;&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf About Haskell, page 5]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1965''': Haskell graduated its last high school class.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell, page 5&quot;/&gt;

* '''1970''': Haskell began offering a junior college curriculum and changes its name to '''Haskell Indian Junior College.'''&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell, page 5&quot;/&gt;

* '''1988''': Planning begins for the transformation from a junior college into a baccalaureate-degree granting university and national center for Indian education, research, and cultural preservation.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell, pp 5-6&quot;&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf About Haskell, pp 5-6]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''1993''': The Assistant Secretary for Indian Affairs, [[Ada Deer]], approves the vision developed by and for Haskell, and the junior college's name is changed to '''Haskell Indian Nations University'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Haskell, pp 5-6&quot;/&gt; Haskell offers its first four-year baccalaureate degree program in elementary teacher education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/cultural/pgs/_about_haskell.html About Haskell]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
* '''1998''': Haskell begins to offer baccalaureate degrees in American Indian studies,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/5754/1/ins.v02.n1.77-85.pdf &quot;The American Indian Studies Program at Haskell Indian Nations University&quot; in Indigenous Nations Studies Journal, 2.1, Spring 2001, page 77]&lt;/ref&gt; Business Administration, and Environmental Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf &quot;University History&quot; page 6 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic Programs ==
Haskell offers four baccalaureate degree programs and four associate degrees in a variety of subjects.

===Indigenous and American Indian Studies (BA)===
Students in this program study an an integrated foundation of interdisciplinary knowledge and the practical skills needed to contribute to the development of Indigenous American Indian and Alaska Native communities and nations. The program is interdisciplinary in nature, thereby providing students the flexibility needed to prepare either for graduate or professional school or to enter the workplace after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf Course Catalog, page 76]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business Administration (BS)===
The School of Business offers the Bachelor of Science in Business Administration with emphases in management or 
tribal management. For students who enter the Management track, the emphasis is on a traditional academic study of contemporary management practices and theories common to the management of human, financial, technical, natural, and other resources. Students interested in the Tribal Management track explore contemporary and historical issues that impact tribal governments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf Course Catalog, page 77]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Elementary Teacher Education (BS)===
Education majors who complete a Bachelor of Science Degree in Elementary Education and successfully pass the Principles of Learning and Teaching (PLT) and Elementary Education: Curriculum, Instruction, and Assessment Test. examination will be eligible to apply for Kansas provisional licensure to teach kindergarten through the sixth grade. Candidates wishing to teach in other states should check
with respective state certification units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf Course Catalog, page 92]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental Sciences (BS)===
The Environmental Sciences program provides its majors with a broad-based background that prepares students for graduate school or a career in environmental or biological fields. Courses offered through this major include Biology, Ecology, Chemistry, Physics, Geography, Natural Resources, and Environmental Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf Course Catalog, page 68]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Museums and Libraries ==
Haskell is home to the [[American Indian Athletic Hall of Fame]], which recognizes famous Haskell athletes including [[John Levi]], [[Jim Thorpe]], [[Moses Yellow Hair]], and [[Billy Mills]].

The [[Haskell Cultural Center and Museum]] is a [[museum]] that provides exhibits of interest about Indigenous history. It also houses archives that includes collections on Haskell and of other subjects.  

Tommaney Library is a fully functioning academic resource center.

==Student Activities==
There are more than 20 student organizations and clubs on campus,&lt;ref name=&quot;Student Life&quot;/&gt; providing students with the chance to become involved in campus life as well as participating in activities in the surrounding community.

==Athletics==
:''For more information, see [[Haskell Indian Nations Fighting Indians]]''

The Fighting Indians compete in the NAIA [[Midlands Collegiate Athletic Conference]] and independent circuit in Football, leaving the [[Central States Football League]] in 2006. Team colors are purple, gold and white. 
* Men's Sports: Football, Cross Country, Basketball, Golf.
* Women's Sports: Cross Country, Basketball, Softball, Volleyball
* Club Sports: Baseball, Boxing

Haskell is noted for having one of the best college football teams in the nation from 1900 to 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=_RqQQHqQdAAC&amp;pg=PA156&amp;lpg=PA156&amp;dq=haskell+institute+football#v=onepage&amp;q=haskell%20institute%20football&amp;f=false | title = Shaping college football: The transformation of an American sport, 1919-1930 | isbn = 9780815608868 | author1 = Schmidt | first1 = Raymond | date = 2007-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus Architecture and Art==
In addition to its historic architecture, Haskell is recognized for its collection of public sculptures, murals, photographs, and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2011/apr/29/haskell-campus-populated-artwork-past-and-present/ Haskell Artwork]&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include the well-known sculpture, &quot;Comrade in Mourning,&quot; by [[Allan Houser]].

==Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Haskell medicine wheel.jpg|thumb|alt=Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork.|Haskell Medicine Wheel, south campus.]] --&gt;
The [[Haskell Medicine Wheel Earthwork]] is located south of the campus and was designed by Haskell professors, students, crop artist [[Stan Herd]], and tribal elders, and dedicated in 1992 as a response to the 500th commemoration of the &quot;Columbian Legacy.&quot; The creation of the Medicine Wheel is offered as a Native gift to all people of this planet.

The Medicine Wheel is rich with symbolism. According to the Haskell Catalog, &quot;The Medicine Wheel symbolizes the scope and richness of indigenous cultures, from the beginning of humankind to the present. The circle is symbolic of the perpetual and sacredness of the spirituality of native peoples. The spokes are the four directions. The circle marks the astrological locations of the Summer and
Winter solstice and represent the death, rebirth, balance and healing in Mother Earth. The bear claw represents
the strength needed for the survival of indigenous people. The thunderbird located to the east represents the
spiritual traditions of tribal people and points to the sacred circle and sacred fire contained within the Medicine
Wheel Teachings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf &quot;Medicine Wheel&quot; in the Haskell General Catalog, page 6]&lt;/ref&gt;  

A replica of the Medicine Wheel is carved in the tile at the [[Haskell Cultural Center and Museum]] as a way of balancing the campus (with a medicine wheel on the north and south ends of campus).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/cultural/pgs/_medicine_wheel.html Medicine Wheel]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Haskell-Baker Wetlands==
:''For more information, see [[Haskell-Baker Wetlands]]''

The Haskell-Baker Wetlands span approximately 640 acres (2.6 km2), covering the south side of the Haskell campus. These wetlands are home to 243 species of birds, 21 species of fish, 22 species of reptiles, and 26 species of plants. This area serves as a feeding and breeding ground for the migratory birds that breed in Canada and set up camp in the wetlands while on their way to Mexico and South America. The Northern Crawfish Frog is an endangered species and its critical habitat is the wetlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/student_life/wpo.html Wetlands Protection Organization]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable Students, Alumni, Staff, and Faculty==
:''For more information, see [[List of Haskell Indian Nations University People]]''
Beginning with the first graduates, a number of individuals have left Haskell to go on to distinguished careers, serving in Tribal, local, and national capacities. In addition, well-known individuals have served at Haskell. 

Notable Haskell people include Tribal education advocate [[Henry Roe Cloud]], athlete [[John Levi]], the current Chairman of National Indian Gaming Association, [[Ernie Stevens, Jr.]], and screenwriter and director [[Stephen Paul Judd]].

The Haskell campus is home to 12 buildings which are listed as U.S. National Historic Landmarks.

===Blalock Hall===
This is a newer building on campus. It was constructed in 1978 and named in honor of Mrs. Margaret Blalock, Chippewa,
a Haskell alumna, and a long-time Haskell employee who was committed to serving the Haskell students. It now is a residential hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Residency Halls, p. 19&quot;&gt;[http://www.haskell.edu/catalog/haskell_general_catalog.pdf University Residency Halls, p. 19]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Osceola and Keokuk Halls===
These adjoined buildings also are known as &quot;O-K Hall.&quot; These two buildings were originally constructed in 1884. At that time, Osceola Hall served as a menâs hall and Keokuk Hall served as a womenâs hall. Osceola was a famous Seminole warrior whose name means âRising Sun.â Keokuk, a Sac and Fox whose name means âWatchful Fox,â was not a chief by birth, but rose to the position
through skillful leadership, force of character, and brilliant oratory. O-K Hall is currently a residential hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Residency Halls, p. 19&quot;/&gt;

===Pocahontas Hall===
Pocahontas Hall was built in 1931, and was named after the daughter of Powhatan, an Algonquian chief. It currently is a residential hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Residency Halls, p. 19&quot;/&gt;

===Powhatan Hall===
Built in 1932 and named after the Algonquian Chief, it originally functioned as classroom space. It now is a residential hall. Powhatan.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Residency Halls, p. 19&quot;/&gt;

===Roe Cloud Hall===
A new building on campus, it was completed in 1997. Roe Cloud Hall is named after Dr. [[Henry Roe Cloud]], a member of the Winnebago Nation. He was the first American Indian superintendent of the Haskell Institute, serving from 1933 to 1935. Dr. Roe Cloud later served in the presidential administrations of Herbert Hoover and Franklin Delano Roosevelt. He remained a strong voice on behalf of American Indian issues and education throughout his life and his career.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Residency Halls, p. 19&quot;/&gt;

===Winona Hall===
Originally constructed in 1897, it was rebuilt in 1962. The name Winona, by Lakota tradition, is given to daughters who are the first-born child of the family. Winona Hall currently is a co-ed honors residential hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;University Residency Halls, p. 19&quot;/&gt; 

After earning an associate degrees, many students transfer to the [[University of Kansas]], other colleges, or join the workforce. Because of this fact, the university was erroneously reported in one report as having a low retention rate. The university received a #9 ranking on the 2010 &quot;Top 50 Dropout Factory&quot; list from ''[[Washington Monthly]]'' in their College Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2010/dropout_factories.php |title=2010 Dropout Factories|accessdate=2010-09-02|work=2010 rankings of the 4-year public and private not-for-profit colleges in America with the worst graduation rates|publisher=Washington Monthly, 2010 College Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;
