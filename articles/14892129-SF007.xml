'''Creative Writer 2''' was released in 1996. The interface was updated and the program was now designed for [[Windows 95]]. The program ran in a window as opposed to full screen. Also gone was Imaginopolis and the feeling of an all enclosed environment although McZee still survived. The program had become more like Microsoft's Word although still very much aimed at children as shown by the templates enclosed. The sounds for menu items remained but the menu's had been rearranged following a study carried out by Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/marycz/druin98.htm Is This Computer Broken or What]- The Role of Usability Research in Designing - Childrenâs Computer Products (Libby Hanna, Ph.D. - IMG Usability )Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; Creative Writer 2 also shipped with Microsoft's Paint It! from their [[Microsoft Plus!#Microsoft Plus.21 for Kids.21|Plus for Kids]] pack. Support for creating and publishing websites was also included in Creative Writer 2 through Microsoft's Web Publishing Wizard.

Also available free of charge was a Microsoft Creative Writer 2 Document Viewer which allowed users without Creative Writer 2 to view (but not edit) .max files created with Creative Writer 2.
