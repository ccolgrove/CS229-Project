'''''Le XXe SiÃ¨cle''''' (The 20th Century) was a [[Belgium|Belgian]] newspaper that was published from 1895 and 1940. Its supplement ''[[Le Petit VingtiÃ¨me]]'' is known as the first publication to feature ''[[The Adventures of Tintin]]''.

The conservative [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] newspaper was founded by Georges Helleputte, Joseph dâUrsel, and Athanase de Broqueville (brother of Belgian Prime Minister [[Charles de Broqueville]]). Its first issue was published on June 6, 1895. It sold poorly and was kept alive by Charles de Broqueville and other Belgian aristocrats. 

In 1914, Fernand Neuray took over as editor-in-chief. He distanced the newspaper from the Catholic alignment and tried to position it as a national newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;http://biwako.skynetblogs.be/archive/2010/08/06/l-action-fran%C3%A7aise-dans-le-nationalisme-belge.html&lt;/ref&gt; It finally folded in 1940, when Nazi [[Germany]] invaded Belgium.
