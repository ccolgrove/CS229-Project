The '''University of Northern Colorado''' ('''UNC''' or '''Northern Colorado''') is a coeducational public institution of higher education in [[Greeley, Colorado]] with a satellite campus in [[Lowry, Denver|Lowry]] in [[Denver, Colorado]]. Established in 1889 as the State Normal School of Colorado, the University has a strong background in teacher education. The university offers over 100 undergraduate programs in the arts, sciences, humanities, business, human sciences, and education. Undergraduate degrees are typically 4 year programs and degree programs have a strong emphasis in liberal arts education. The university offers nearly 50 graduate programs primarily in education. Academic programs are distributed among six colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;degrees&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unco.edu/about_unc/|title=About UNC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of The University of Northern Colorado begins in the late 1880s, when citizens of Greeley petitioned the Colorado government to create a school to educate teachers in their community. In April 1889 Governor Cooper signed a bill establishing the Colorado State Normal School. Classes began in October of the next year. Since then the institution has been through many changes in focus, architecture, and student ideals.&lt;ref name=&quot;brief_history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unco.edu/library/archives/arc_previous_names.htm|title=Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Northern Colorado opened on October 6, 1890, as the '''Colorado State Normal School''' to train qualified teachers for the state's public schools, with a staff of four instructors and 96 students, offering certification after completing a two-year course. Greeley's citizens raised the necessary money for the first building. At that time, certificates were granted upon the completion of a two-year course. In 1911 the school's name was changed to '''Colorado State Teachers College''' and offered bachelor degrees after completion of a four-year course. In 1935 the name changed again to '''Colorado State College of Education''' to recognize the graduate program, which was started in 1913. In 1957 the name was shortened to '''Colorado State College''' to recognize the further growth of programs and offerings. Finally, in 1970 the name was changed to the current '''University of Northern Colorado'''.

Originally Colorado State Normal School occupied only one building, Cranford Hall.  It was set fire to in 1949 by a disgruntled theater student who was later arrested for this and several other crimes. The building was repaired, and classes were held there until 1965 when the building was deemed unsafe for classroom use. Many offices were held here until December 1971 when the entire structure became too unsafe to use, and in 1972 the building was demolished. The cornerstone was saved and now graces the northeast corner of &quot;Cranford Park&quot; with four commemorative plaques regarding Cranford's significance and legacy in UNC's history.

The south end of Central Campus grew with the addition of Gordon Hall, Belford Hall, and Decker Hall in 1921, which were originally built as female residence halls. Around this time, the Faculty Apartments were built, later known as Presidents Row. The Faculty Apartments were built shortly after the President's House, now used as the Visitors Center. Sabin, Snyder, and Tobey-Kendel Halls were added in 1936 when enrollment was growing, and men's residence halls were added on the old East Campus. These halls, Hadden and Hayes, are east of Campus on 6th Avenue. The institution sold the land and buildings, and are no longer used as residence halls.  In the 1950s Weibking Hall, Wilson Hall, and a larger dining space were added on to the already existing Tobey-Kendel Hall to accommodate the large influx of students after the war had ended. In 1997, students voted on a fee increase to fund two buildings to house the Women's Resource Center, the Counseling Center, and the Student Health Center.  Scott-Willcoxon and Cassidy Halls opened in 1999 with the new Hansen-Willis residence hall.

In the late 1950s the school grew beyond the available acreage.  The institution found an outlet for expansion in the Petrikin family farm to the southwest of the main campus, adding about {{convert|150|acre|km2}}.  West Campus expanded to include a new library, several residence halls, academic halls, recreation center, and football and other athletic facilities.  The 1960s was a flurry of construction with a new building erected almost every year.  Built in 1963, McCowen Hall was the first co-educational residence hall, and hosted nearly 30,000 students over the course of its lifetime.  In the late part of the decade, McKee Hall and Turner Residence Hall opened, adding spaces for the College of Education and 600 residents, respectively.  In the early 1970s, James A. Michener Library, Lawrenson Hall and Candelaria Hall would be the last buildings to be added to campus for almost 20 years, until the Campus Recreation Center opened in the mid-1990s.  Most recently,  McCowen was torn down in 2008 to make room for new residence halls, North and South Hall.

==Traditions==
===Alma mater===
''Ah! Well I Remember'' is the [[alma mater]] of the University of Northern Colorado. It was written by J. De Forest Cline. The words Purple and Gold refer to the previous colors of the institution. While the current colors are Navy Blue and Gold the alma mater retained the former colors.&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ah! Well I Remember, Friends of âPurple and Gold.â&lt;/br&gt;
Friends met in September, Pledging their Faith to hold.&lt;/br&gt;
Gone, Friends of September, Gone dear friends of old.&lt;/br&gt;
Time never shall sever, Friends of âPurple and Gold.â&lt;/br&gt;
Time never shall sever, Friends of âPurple and Gold.â
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Campus==
The campus is divided into two main areas: central, and west. UNC's Central Campus includes the areas north of 20th Street and west of 8th Avenue in [[Greeley, Colorado]]. The residence halls on Central Campus have been designated a state historic district.&lt;ref name=&quot;refname1&quot; group=&quot;Ref&quot;/&gt; UNC's Central Campus was the original part of the campus and currently houses the College of Performing &amp; Visual Arts, schools in the College of Natural &amp; Health Science, and the Kenneth W. Monfort College of Business.  Central has a quieter, more traditional &quot;collegiate&quot; feeling.

West Campus includes the areas south of 20th Street and west of 10th Avenue, including the College of Humanities &amp; Social Sciences, College of Education &amp; Behavioral Sciences, and schools in the College of Natural &amp; Health Sciences.  West Campus houses 2,000 students and is generally the more social area of campus.

===Other locations===
The university operates several satellite campuses, with locations in [[Loveland, Colorado]], [[Denver, Colorado]], and [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]].  The Denver campus hosts two programs, the Center for Urban Education (focuses on providing opportunities for working teachers), and the DO-IT Center (ASL-English interpreter training).

Old Man Mountain is a group of cabins owned by the University located in [[Estes Park, Colorado]], and serves as a common retreat location for the community.

==Athletics==
[[Image:NorthernColorado.jpeg|thumb|right|The logo of Northern Colorado athletics, in use since 2004]]

Sports teams at the school are called ''Bears.'' Northern Colorado is currently in the fourth year of a four-year process of moving from [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]âs [[Division II (NCAA)|Division II]] to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], Football Championship Subdivision (formerly I-AA) for [[American football|football]]. Northern Colorado joined the [[Big Sky Conference]] on July 1, 2006. The school mascot is Klawz the [[Bear]] and the school colors are Navy Blue and [[Gold]]. The Fight Song is the âUNC Fight Songâ.

Before, UNC was a member of the [[Rocky Mountain Athletic Conference]] from 1923 to 1972. Joining the [[Great Plains Athletic Conference]] for four years (1972â76). Following several years of being conference independent, The University of Northern Colorado joined the [[North Central Conference]]. The Bears have won two Division II Football National Championships in 1996 and 1997.  Northern Colorado's Athletic Director is Jay Hinrichs. On [[March 9]], [[2011]] the Bears won the [[Big Sky Conference]] tournament championship in [[men's basketball]], clinching a trip to the [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], the first in the school's history.

The Bears play their football games at [[Nottingham Field]], while the Men's and Women's Basketball teams and Women's Volleyball team play at the [[Butler-Hancock Sports Pavilion]]. &quot;Fear The Claw&quot; is the student section slogan. Northern Colorado won its first Big Sky Championship in 2009 when the Women's Volleyball team beat Portland State to capture the Big Sky Volleyball Championship. The Bears have many athletes in the pros. Probably the biggest is [[Vincent Jackson]] who attended and played football at Northern Colorado from 2001 to 2004 before being drafted by the [[San Diego Chargers]] in the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. Other famous football alums for the school are: punter [[Dirk Johnson]], safety [[Reed Doughty]] who plays for the [[Washington Redskins]], defensive lineman [[Aaron Smith (American football)|Aaron Smith]] of the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], and over 10 others.

===Mascots===
[[Image:2005 1029Homecoming0142.JPG|thumb|right|The university's mascot, &quot;Klawz&quot;]]

The bear is the mascot of the UNC. The bear officially became the mascot in 1923. Before the school adopted the bear as their mascot, athletes used the nickname the Teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Various ''The Mirror''s and ''Cache La Poudre''s&lt;/ref&gt;  The bear was said to be inspired by a bear on top of an Alaskan totem pole donated by an 1897 alum in 1914. The totem pole was kept in the University Center, but under the federal Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, the pole was reclaimed by the [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]] in 2003. Klawz in the mascot that attends all the sports games. Klawz is the newest addition to the long line of Bears' mascots over the years at the University of Northern Colorado. He was recruited after Gunter Bear became exhausted from his duties and retired.  Klawz made his first appearance in Nottingham Field on August 30, 2003 before the UNC football team opened their season against New Mexico Highlands.

==Achievements==
===Normal school===
Founded in 1889 as the State Normal School, Northern Colorado met a vital need to train qualified teachers in the growing state of Colorado, which was then less than 15 years old. More than a century and four name changes later, the institution has grown to become a [http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&amp;subkey=4917&amp;start=782 Doctoral Research] university. At Northern Colorado's centennial in 1989, only four universities in the U.S. surpassed it in the total number of teachers trained.{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Robert | title = Shaping educational change: the first century of the University of Northern Colorado at Greeley | origyear = 1889 | accessdate = 2006}} All current Northern Colorado programs are clustered around an institutional mission devoted to teacher education. Its early dedication to reaching the highest levels of educational excellence, coupled with the generation and dissemination of new pedagogical knowledge, earned Northern Colorado the name âColumbia of the West.â{{cite book | last = Larson | first = Robert | title = Shaping educational change: the first century of the University of Northern Colorado at Greeley | origyear = 1889 | accessdate = 2006}} In 1985, the Colorado Legislature took the unique step of designating Northern Colorado as âthe primary institution for undergraduate and graduate teacher education in the state of Colorado.â{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Monfort College of Business===
The Kenneth W. [[Monfort College of Business]] at the University of Northern Colorado offers the only program of its kind in the Rocky Mountain region â focused exclusively on undergraduate business education and internationally accredited in business administration and accounting.
