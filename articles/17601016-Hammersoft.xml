{{2008 Mid-American Conference football standings}}

The '''2008 Ball State Cardinals football team''' represented [[Ball State University]] in the [[Mid-American Conference]] during the [[2008 NCAA Division I FBS football season|2008â2009]] [[college football]] season.  [[Brady Hoke]], in his sixth season at Ball State, was the head coach until December 15, when he resigned to become the head coach at [[San Diego State Aztecs football|San Diego State]]. He was succeeded by offensive coordinator [[Stan Parrish]], who coached the team during the [[GMAC Bowl]] and beyond. The Cardinals' home games were played at [[Scheumann Stadium]] in [[Muncie, Indiana]].

With a 12â0 record during the regular season, the Cardinals completed their first perfect regular season since 1949 and their first undefeated season in Mid-American Conference play since 1978. The Cardinals earned their first Mid-American Conference West Championship in program history. The Cardinals chance at perfection ended after an upset loss to [[Buffalo Bulls football|Buffalo]] in the [[2008 MAC Championship Game]]. Ball State concluded the season with a 45â13&amp;nbsp;loss to [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]] in the [[2009 GMAC Bowl]]. The game marked the first time in school history Ball State has played in a bowl game in back-to-back seasons.

==Pre-season==
===Outlook===
The Cardinals ended the 2007 season with a 7â6 overall record, the Mid-American Conference West Division Co-Championship and the programâs first bowl game in 11&amp;nbsp;seasons, losing to [[Rutgers University|Rutgers]] 52â30 in the [[2008 International Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The quarterback of the Ball State offense was [[Nate Davis (quarterback)|Nate Davis]] who threw for 30&amp;nbsp;touchdowns to just six interceptions in his 478&amp;nbsp;pass attempts. The Cardinals returned their starting receiving corps, which helped lead Ball State to be the #1&amp;nbsp;ranked passing offense in the Mid-American Conference. Wide receiver [[Dante Love]] produced nearly 1,400&amp;nbsp;receiving yards while adding 203&amp;nbsp;more rushing with eleven touchdowns in 2007. Love also led the Mid-American Conference in three categories; receptions per game (7.7), receiving yards per game (107.5) and all-purpose yards (207). Punter Chris Miller was third in the country in 2007 averaging 45.4&amp;nbsp;yards per punt last season and was considered to be an [[All-American]] candidate. The Cardinals also returned tight end Darius Hill. Considered to be the premier tight end in the Mid-American Conference, Hill averaged 71&amp;nbsp;yards per game and scored 11&amp;nbsp;touchdowns last season.

Nate Davis passed for 326&amp;nbsp;yards and four touchdowns, but it was the Cardinalsâ defense that repeatedly came up with the big plays in the second half of a 35â23&amp;nbsp;victory over the Midshipmen. Davis passed for 215&amp;nbsp;yards in the first half, including touchdowns of 61&amp;nbsp;yards to Dante Love on the second play of the game and 30&amp;nbsp;yards to Briggs Orsbon late in the second quarter. Love, who tied a school record with his eleventh game of at least 100&amp;nbsp;yards receiving, also rushed for a touchdown and caught a go-ahead 8&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass from Davis midway through the third quarter. After Loveâs second touchdown catch put Ball State ahead 28â23, Navy threatened to take the lead again late in the third period. Shun White, who set a Navy rushing record with 348&amp;nbsp;yards and three touchdowns in the previous week, was stopped at the 3&amp;nbsp;yard line, and quarterback Jarod Bryant, who ran for Navyâs first two touchdowns, was held for no gain on fourth down, giving the ball back to the Cardinals.

MiQuale Lewis started the scoring in the game as he ran for a 10&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown run. On Ball State's next series, Davis completed a 40&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass to Lewis Johnson, whose &quot;stop-and-go&quot; move enabled him to elude two defenders. Western Michigan responded with a trick play, scoring when [[Tim Hiller]] threw a [[Lateral pass|lateral]] to backup quarterback Drew Burdi, who turned and threw a 36&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass to Scneider Julien, making it 14â7. The Broncos tied it early in the second quarter on a pass from Hiller to Juan Nunez, who caught the nine yard pass over his shoulder. The Cardinals broke the tie on a 43&amp;nbsp;yard field goal from Ian McGarvey and took a 24â14 halftime lead when Davis ran for a six yard touchdown run. Lewis' one yard touchdown run late in the third quarter and Trey Lewis' interception return made it 38â14. Western Michigan closed to 38â22 early in the fourth when Brandon West scored on an eight yard touchdown run. But Lewis closed it out with a one yard touchdown run with 4:31 to go, his twentieth rushing score of the season, which broke the previous record set by Mark Bornholdt in 1979. The Cardinals completed their first perfect regular season since 1949, their first undefeated season in Mid-American Conference play since 1978 and clinched a spot in the conference title game.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPB&quot;/&gt; The win gave Ball State its first Mid-American Conference West title in program history.&lt;ref name=&quot;FTI&quot;/&gt; A school record 11,088&amp;nbsp;students and 23,861&amp;nbsp;overall attended the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;SPB&quot;&gt;{{cite news

The Cardinals fell into an early deficit when Buffalo quarterback [[Drew Willy]] completed a pass to Naam Roosevelt for a two yard touchdown. The Cardinals responded midway through the second quarter as MiQuale Lewis ran for a four yard touchdown. As the first half expired, Ian McGarvey kicked a 47&amp;nbsp;yard field goal to give the Cardinals a 10â7 lead. In the third quarter, Willy completed a 39&amp;nbsp;yard pass to Roosevelt to give the Bulls the lead 14â10. The Cardinals responded on the next drive, as Lewis concluded a seven play, 65&amp;nbsp;yard drive with his second touchdown of the game, this time on a one yard run to give the Cardinals the lead. After recovering a fumble, the Cardinals offense made it all the way to the Buffalo one yard line, but a two yard loss and a [[false start]] penalty pushed the ball back to the eight yard line. On the next play, Nate Davis attempted to dive into the end zone, but fumbled the ball and was recovered by Buffalo's Mike Newton, who ran the ball back 92&amp;nbsp;yards for a touchdown. After getting to the Buffalo 15&amp;nbsp;yard line, the Cardinals fumbled for the third time and was run back for a 74&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown by Buffalo's Sherrod Lott for a 28â17 lead. The Cardinals fourth fumble of the game, which was forced and recovered by Buffaloâs Adekunle Akingba, set up Willyâs third touchdown pass to Roosevelt on an eight-yard completion to increase the lead to 35â17. The Cardinals cut the Buffalo lead back to 11&amp;nbsp;points with 4:17&amp;nbsp;remaining in the game after a 22&amp;nbsp;yard completion from Davis to Louis Johnson. Needing to get the ball back quickly, the Cardinals attempted an onside kick after the score, which was recovered by the Bulls. Buffalo then extended its lead to 18&amp;nbsp;points for a second time at 42â24, on a one yard touchdown run by James Starks. An interception in the end zone with 41&amp;nbsp;seconds remaining in the game sealed the win for Buffalo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Tulsa took the early 7â0&amp;nbsp;lead over the Cardinals in the first quarter but Ball State answered back with an 18&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown run from Nate Davis. The Cardinals defense held Tulsa to a 30&amp;nbsp;yard field goal late in the first quarter but the Golden Hurricane went on to score with 10:39&amp;nbsp;remaining in the second quarter increasing their lead to 17â7. Robert Eddins blocked the first punt of his career and Jeremy Hill recovered the ball to give Ball State favorable field position, which resulted in a 40&amp;nbsp;yard field goal from Ian McGarvey with 6:36&amp;nbsp;left in the second quarter and closed Tulsa's lead to 17â10. Tulsa made its way down the field quickly to go ahead of the Cardinals 24â10&amp;nbsp;with 4:30&amp;nbsp;left in the second quarter on a 57-yard touchdown run.  With 29&amp;nbsp;seconds before the completion of the first half, McGarvey made a 22&amp;nbsp;yard field goal to close the gap to 24â13 at the break. During halftime, inclement weather conditions occurred with a heavy downpour which continued for the majority of the remainder of the game.  But the weather did not hamper the Golden Hurricane who opened the second half with a touchdown to take a 31â13&amp;nbsp;edge over Ball State.  Tulsa added another touchdown after Tarrion Adams scored his third touchdown of the game making it 38â13&amp;nbsp;with 13:29&amp;nbsp;remaining in the fourth quarter. The last touchdown scored was with 10:25&amp;nbsp;in the fourth when Tulsa completed a 13&amp;nbsp;,yard pass to Jacob Frank making the score 45â13.
