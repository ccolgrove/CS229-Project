==Biography==
===1966â1999===
Sherinian was born in [[Laguna Beach, California]] of [[Armenians in Greece|Greek-Armenian]] descent. He began taking piano lessons at age five in [[Santa Cruz, California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dereksherinian.com/bio.htm|title=Derek Sherinian - Bio|publisher=DerekSherinian.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Proginterview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://progsheet1.hypermart.net/sherinian.html|title=Derek Sherinian Interview|publisher=ProgSheet.com|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; After his junior year at [[Soquel High School]], he received a scholarship to the [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston where he was the roommate of future [[Megadeth]] guitarist and [[Trans-Siberian Orchestra]] musical director [[Al Pitrelli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p192320|pure_url=yes}}|title=Derek Sherinian - Overview|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has since studied with other keyboard players, including [[Mitchel Forman]], [[T Lavitz]] and [[Russell Ferrante]]. His first professional gig after leaving Boston was with ex-[[Jimi Hendrix]] [[Band of Gypsies]] drummer [[Buddy Miles]]. Sherinian got his first big break with [[Alice Cooper]] in 1989 to tour in support of the platinum selling &quot;Trash&quot; album.&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;/&gt; After touring with Alice Cooper, Sherinian played offstage keyboards on the 1992 [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] Revenge tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;/&gt;

In 1994, Derek replaced [[Kevin Moore]] in the [[progressive metal]] band [[Dream Theater]], originally just for the band's promotional tour for ''[[Awake (Dream Theater album)|Awake]]''. On February 1995, however, he was made a full-time member of the band. He recorded the albums ''[[A Change of Seasons]]'' (1995), ''[[Falling into Infinity|Falling Into Infinity]]'' (1997), and ''[[Once In A LIVEtime]]'' (1998) with Dream Theater before being replaced in January 1999 by [[Jordan Rudess]] due to creative differences and turmoil within the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allmusic&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mikeportnoy.com/about/mpfaq/showquestion.asp?menu=about&amp;faq=1&amp;fldAuto=460|title=Mike Portnoy FAQ|publisher=Mikeportnoy.com|accessdate=2007-06-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061213022345/http://www.mikeportnoy.com/about/mpfaq/showquestion.asp?menu=about&amp;faq=1&amp;fldAuto=460 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dtfaq.com/question/46 |title=Dream Theater FAQ|accessdate=2007-06-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060524124912/http://www.dtfaq.com/question/46 |archivedate = 2006-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rudessarticle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-03-10|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060310/ai_n16144393|title=Dream Theater returns to roots|publisher=Deseret Morning News and FindArticles.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherinian remained on good terms with the band, and reunited with Dream Theater for a one-off concert in 2004, which was recorded and released as [[When Dream and Day Unite|When Dream and Day Reunite]] (2004). The band's performance of &quot;[[Images and Words|Metropolis Pt. 1]]&quot; featured an extended improvisation between Sherinian, Rudess, and guitarist [[John Petrucci]].

During the late 1990s, Sherinian released two albums with the progressive rock supergroup [[Platypus (band)|Platypus]], which also featured Dream Theater bassist [[John Myung]], Dregs drummer [[Rod Morgenstein]], and King's X guitarist [[Ty Tabor]]. The group released two albums, ''[[When Pus Comes to Shove]]'' (1998) and ''[[Ice Cycles]]'' (2000), before disbanding in 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlabbermouthArchives&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?Mode=Archive&amp;Date=9/18/2001|title=2001 Archives|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1999 â present===
Since 1999, Sherinian has recorded seven solo albums, featuring performances by numerous highly acclaimed musicians. 

Sherinian's first solo album, [[Planet X (album)|Planet X]] (1999), written and recorded with Australian drummer [[Virgil Donati]], led to the formation of a band of the same name ([[Planet X (band)|Planet X]]). Guitar virtuoso [[Tony MacAlpine]] was recruited to complete the band. Sherinian has stated that his intention when forming Planet X was to create a group of musicians that &quot;played their instruments so fiercely, that they would strike fear in the hearts of all musicians&quot;.  

In 2001, Derek teamed with drummer [[Simon Phillips]] and guitarists [[Steve Lukather]] and [[Zakk Wylde]] to record ''[[Inertia (Derek Sherinian album)|Inertia]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGInertia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Wildran, Jonathan|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r533008|pure_url=yes}}|title=Inertia - Overview|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by ''[[Black Utopia]]'' (2003). For ''Black Utopia'', three new faces joined Sherinianâs group: bassist [[Billy Sheehan]], rock guitarist [[Yngwie Malmsteen]], and [[jazz fusion]] guitarist [[Al Di Meola]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AMGUtopia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Rivadavia, Eduardo|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r638319|pure_url=yes}}|title=Black Utopia - Overview|publisher=AllMusic.com|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BlabberMouthUtopia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2003-02-13|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=9673|title=Former DREAM THEATER Keyboardist Completes Work On New Solo CD|publisher=BlabberMouth.net|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to this fusion-influenced lineup, Sherinian stated:
{{Blockquote|I have always been a fan of [[jazz fusion]], but from the perspective of a rock player crossing over to jazz, not vice versa. I think that is how [[Jeff Beck]] (who Sherinian stated he hopes to play with in a recent interview) approached his classic instrumental records and I like to follow in that path.&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;/&gt;}} 
Sherinian also calls the album &quot;a lot darker and heavier than [''Inertia'']&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;UtopiaCover&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revelationz.net/index.asp?ID=721|title=Interview - Derek Sherinian|publisher=[[RevelationZ]] Magazine|accessdate=2007-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Japan]], the cover of ''Black Utopia'' was altered to remove the cross in the title without Sherinian's consent; Sherinian has commented that the cross &quot;meant nothing&quot; and was added for aesthetic purposes.&lt;ref name=&quot;UtopiaCover&quot;/&gt;

Sherinian extended further into the fusion realm by collaborating with guitarist [[Allan Holdsworth]] and violinist [[Jerry Goodman]] (formerly of the Mahavishnu Orchestra) on ''[[Mythology (Derek Sherinian album)|Mythology]]'' (2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;BlabbermouthMythology&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2004-09-28|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=27368|title=New DEREK SHERINIAN Solo Album To Feature Guest Appearances By ZAKK WYLDE, JOHN SYKES|publisher=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=2007-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to another appearance by Phillips, other musicians appearing on this recording were [[Zakk Wylde]], [[John Sykes]], [[Steve Stevens]], and [[Tony Franklin (musician)|Tony Franklin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BlabbermouthMythology&quot;/&gt; &lt;!--A 2005 audio interview about &quot;Mythology&quot;, as well as other aspects of Derek's career, can be heard [http://hrs.chimpftp.com/interviews/081.m3u] here.--&gt;

Since 2002, Sherinian has toured with several well-known artists, including [[Billy Idol]] and Yngwie Malmsteen.&lt;ref name=&quot;Idolarticle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2004-12-06|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2004_Dec_6/ai_n7637352|title=Billy Idol to Release First CD Featuring New Music in More Than 10 Years; Rebel Rocker Offers DEVIL'S PLAYGROUND on March 22; `Scream' Goes to Radio Early January|publisher=Business Wire and FindArticles.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Derek's fifth solo album, ''[[Blood of the Snake]]'' (2006), features contributions from Idol, as well as former [[Guns N' Roses]] guitarist [[Slash (musician)|Slash]], [[John Petrucci]] of Dream Theater, and [[Brian Tichy]]; Phillips, Franklin and Lukather  make return appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;AllmusicBlood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Prato, Greg|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r848760|pure_url=yes}}|title=Blood of the Snake - Overview|publisher=Allmusic.com|accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BlabbermouthSnake&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2006-05-06|url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=51903

Later that year, Sherinian also performed a one-off acoustic gig with [[Alice In Chains]] to launch their ''[[Black Gives Way To Blue]]'' album.

In 2010, Sherinian became a founding member of supergroup [[Black Country Communion]] with [[Glenn Hughes]], [[Jason Bonham]], and [[Joe Bonamassa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Blabbermouth1&quot;/&gt; releasing their eponymous debut.
1n 2011, Sherinian performed on a second Black Country Communion record titiled &quot;2&quot;, followed with a nine week tour of the United States and Europe. In September of that year, Sherinian released his seventh solo album titled &quot;[[Oceana (Derek Sherinian album)| Oceana]]&quot; reuniting with Simon Phillips and Steve Lukather, and featuring a guest appearance from BCC bandmate Joe Bonamassa.

== Influences and collaborations ==
&lt;!--in addition to that awesome guitar world source, there is more info available on Derek's website under the &quot;other artists&quot; sections.--&gt;
In a 2000 interview, Sherinian cited his early keyboard influences as being [[Jan Hammer]] ([[Mahavishnu Orchestra]]), [[Keith Emerson]] ([[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] and [[The Nice]]), [[Rick Wakeman]] ([[Yes (band)|Yes]]), and [[Elton John]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Proginterview&quot;/&gt; Other influences include guitarists [[Allan Holdsworth]], [[Jeff Beck]], and [[Eddie Van Halen]]. Sherinian enjoys co-writing material with fellow musicians, and often finds that he writes better material with drummers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jan van der Vorst|url=http://www.dprp.net/specials/sherinian1204/index.php|title=Derek Sherinian: Interview 2004|publisher=Dutch Progressive Rock Page|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sherinian cites Van Halen's guitar playing as having a direct influence on his aggressive unique approach to keyboards in terms of technique as well as tone; his unique signature lead patch contains numerous elements of guitar sounds such as distortion, harmonics, and palm-muting, eventually leading to playing a gig with Eddie for a party at Van Halen's home in 2006, of which Sherinian said &quot;It was the highlight of my career, it was completely surreal.&quot;  Sherinian's work with noted [[Toto (band)|Toto]] guitarist [[Steve Lukather]] on the 2001 solo CD ''Inertia'' was cited by Lukather as &quot;probably my best recorded work in my whole career. Great record! I'm very proud of it!&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;SherinianBio&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dereksherinian.com/bio.htm|title=Derek Sherinian - Bio|publisher=DerekSherinian.com|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sherinian's collaborations with top musicians were featured in a 2007 article in ''[[Guitar World]]'' magazine, where guitarist [[Zakk Wylde]] offered &quot;People want to play with him because heâs that good. He can play everything from the easiest licks on a piano to the most complex [[Beethoven]] [[sonata]]s with ease.&quot; [[Dream Theater]] guitarist [[John Petrucci]] added &quot;...Derek -considering the fact that heâs heavily into guitarists and rock music, his history, and the range of all the great guitarists heâs worked with âplays with a fire unheard of from most keyboardists.â&lt;ref name=&quot;GuitarWorld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Lalaina, Joe|url=http://www.guitarworld.com/derek_sherinian|title=King of the Keys: Derek Sherinian|publisher=Guitar World|accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherinian explains that he enlists a variety of guitarists because he &quot;[does not] think there is one guitarist who can cover all the styles featured on [the] albums.&quot; Sherinian often tailors songs for specific guitarists, such as Holdsworth and Wylde for &quot;Day of the Dead&quot; (off ''Mythology'');&lt;ref name=&quot;GuitarWorld&quot;/&gt; in this respect, he seeks to take certain aspects of genres and make them ''&quot;collide in an eloquent way&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;UtopiaCover&quot;/&gt;&lt;!--==Reception==Sherinian is highly respected in the music community, especially in regard to his post-Dream Theater work.

In collaboration with KORG sound designer Jack Hotop, they created Sherinian's signature &quot;guitaristic&quot; lead sound (the &quot;Monster Lead&quot;, made famous on the Dream Theater album &quot;Falling Into Infinity&quot;) on the Trinity, as well as other, more &quot;modern&quot; and &quot;aggressive&quot; keyboard patches, owing to his fondness of guitar tones and technique. Derek is currently using the KORG Kronos in the studio and live. 
Derek also uses the [[Hammond B3 organ]]; he thinks that ''&quot;every rock keyboardist should have a distorted Leslie and a Hammond as part of their sound.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artist-shop.com/irc/platypus.htm|title=Chat with Rod Morgenstein and Derek Sherinian of Platypus|publisher=Artist-shop.com|accessdate=2007-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Derek is also known for being one of the first keyboardists to use vertical keyboard stands, influencing a new generation of keyboardists. A more detailed list of equipment can be found at Sherinian's Web site ([http://www.dereksherinian.com/gear.htm]).

Sherinian currently uses the following gear: [[Korg Kronos|Korg Kronos 61]], [[Moog Voyager XL]], [[Clavia|Clavia Nord Lead 3]], [[Clavia|Clavia Nord Elerctro 3]], [[Clavia Nord Stage 2 88]].
