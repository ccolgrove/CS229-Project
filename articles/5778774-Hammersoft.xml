'''Hot 3''' (styled as '''HOT3'''; {{lang-he|××× 3}}; also available in [[High-definition television|HD]] as '''HOT3 HD''') is an [[Israel]]i [[television]] channel. First introduced as '''The Family Channel''' in the early 1990s and later simply as '''Channel 3''', it was one of the very first exclusive channels of regulated cable television in Israel.

At first the channel's Program Schedule was mostly made of [[Drama]]s, some American shows from the past (''[[Soap (TV series)|Soap]]'', ''[[All in the family]])'', [[Soap Opera]]s such as ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'', and a few experimental original productions.

Within a few years, the channel became the Israeli home of many successful television shows from America and other countries, adding the tag line &quot;The best shows in the world&quot;. However, in 2002 the channel lost this privilege due to a financial dispute with [[Warner Bros.]] and could not continue to air content distributed by Warner. This resulted in Channel 3 losing shows such as ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'' and ''[[The West Wing]]'' - all of which were purchased by other channels.

Since then the channel added more and more original content while continuing to air non-Warner purchased shows. The channel's name was changed to &quot;Hot 3&quot; in 2004, not long after the three Israeli cable companies united and became the &quot;[[Hot (Israel)|Hot]]&quot; company.

To date, the longest-running original show in the channel was &quot;Good Evening with Guy Pines&quot;, a televised magazine hosted by [[Guy Pines]], covering the world of entertainment both in Israel and the world. This show aired at least 4 times a week for 13 seasons between 1997â2010, and an earlier version was the Israeli &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, also hosted by Pines which aired from 1994 to 1996. Pines also covered events such as [[film festivals]] around the world before &quot;Good Evening&quot; started.

January of [[2010]] saw the launch of Hot 3 HD, a [[High-definition video|high definition]] [[simulcast]] of Hot 3. Although a year earlier, in January of [[2009]] the channel already produced the first ever Israeli original drama to be shot in high definition - &quot;Timrot Ashan&quot; (Pillars of Smoke).

In [[October]] [[2011]] the original [[SDTV]] channel was transferred to [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] broadcast, with accordance to most of its content, after more than 20 years of broadcasting in 4:3 aspect ratio.
