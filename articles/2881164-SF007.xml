'''TorrentFlux''' is a free and [[open source]] multi-user GUI for [[BitTornado]]. Unlike most [[BitTorrent client]]s, its main user interface is a web interface. It is scripted in [[PHP]], with a [[MySQL]] database and runs on a web server.

Its web interface allows it to be operated on a remote server, which is useful for file services based at an Internet service center.

The most recent beta release also includes support for [[ADOdb]], allowing for use of other database backends. Numerous &quot;hacks&quot; have been written to add additional functionality.

==Status==
The latest release is 2.4 final for Linux, released on June 18, 2008. The latest Windows version is 1.3, released August 15, 2004.

==TorrentFlux-b4rt==
In January 2007 a fork called '''TorrentFlux-b4rt''' was created by a TorrentFlux forum member with the alias &quot;b4rt&quot;. TorrentFlux-b4rt incorporates many of the mods created by the community, as well as some new features and display themes, into a single package. An existing TorrentFlux installation can be converted to a TorrentFlux-b4rt installation, preserving all settings and data, by using the scripts included with TorrentFlux-b4rt.
The newer versions of TorrentFlux-b4rt are completely rewritten, and no longer based on the original TorrentFlux source code.

Key TorrentFlux-b4rt additions:
* A more advanced queue management system.
* The ability to periodically scan [[RSS]] feeds for new transfers to start.
* The ability to change upload/download rates while a transfer is running.
* Transfer statistics logging and bulk operations (start/stop all transfers).
* The ability to use clients besides BitTornado: [[Transmission (BitTorrent)|Transmission]] and [[Vuze|Azureus]] for torrents, [[wget]] for [[http]] and [[ftp]] downloads, and [[nzbperl]] for [[usenet]] downloads (using [[NZB]] files).
* The ability to use VLC Player to stream across the network.

==TorrentFlux NG==
In October 2010, a few TorrentFlux-b4rt enthusiasts created a fork from '''TorrentFlux-b4rt'''. The reason for this is that project development for '''TorrentFlux-b4rt''' has come to an end, the continuous stream of spam on the forums, a website that had not been updated for years and a lack of permissions and access for others to update the project and the site.

TorrentFlux NG wants to include the following features in its first release:
* DHT
* Encryption of torrent traffic
* Magnet links for adding torrents
* Better memory management (1 process for multiple torrent downloads instead of 1 process per torrent)
* No need to write patches for each new release of Transmission
* New user interface/theme

One of the key targets for future releases is the separation of the front-end from the back-end.
