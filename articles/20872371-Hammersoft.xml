The '''2009 Baltimore Ravens season''' is the [[Baltimore Ravens|franchise's]] [[List of Baltimore Ravens seasons|14th season]] as a team in the [[National Football League]] (NFL). The franchise entered the season off an 11â5 record in their [[2008 Baltimore Ravens season|previous season]], a playoff berth, but a loss in the [[AFC Championship|American Football Conference (AFC) Championship]] game against the eventual [[Super Bowl XLIII]] champions, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]]. The Ravens recorded nine victories to seven losses, although they were unable to win the [[AFC North]] division title. However, due to various playoff clinching scenarios in the AFC, the Ravens were able to clinch a [[NFL Wild card|wild card]] [[2009-10 NFL Playoffs|playoff]] berth against the [[New England Patriots]], which they won. They, however, lost in the AFC playoffs divisional round against the [[Indianapolis Colts]]; with this loss, the 2009 season came to an end for the Ravens. For [[head coach]] [[John Harbaugh]], this was his second year with the franchise, compiling a overall record of 20â12 in the regular season.

==Offseason==
[[Rex Ryan]], a longtime fixture on the Ravens' sidelines, departed for New York to become the [[New York Jets]] head coach after the Ravens fell to the Steelers in the [[National Football League playoffs, 2008-09|2008 AFC Championship]] game.

Other notable offseason departures include linebacker [[Bart Scott]] and safety [[Jim Leonhard]], both of whom left Baltimore to follow Rex Ryan to New York, and longtime [[placekicker]] [[Matt Stover]]. On March 5, 2009, Stover told reporters that the Ravens were &quot;going in a different direction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://games.espn.go.com/ffl/resources/playernews?playerId=129&lt;/ref&gt; When Stover's tenure ended with the Ravens, the team severed ties with one of its two remaining players from the Ravens' first season in 1996; the other being [[Ray Lewis (American football)|Ray Lewis]].
===2009 NFL Draft===
The Baltimore Ravens had six selections going into in the [[2009 NFL Draft]], which was held in [[Radio City Music Hall]] in [[New York City]], [[New York]] on April 25 and April 26, 2009.

The Baltimore Ravens began the 2009 season at home for the second season in a row. They hosted the Kansas City Chiefs, who struggled to a franchise-worst 2â14 record in 2008. The Ravens dominated time of possession and offensive production throughout the game, but their special teams miscues made the game much closer than the score would indicate. The Ravens found the end zone half way through the first quarter for their first touchdown of the season when Flacco found Willis McGahee for a 3 yard touchdown pass. The Ravens would later increase their advantage with a Steven Hauschka field goal. In the second quarter, a special teams miscue led to Chiefs safety Jon McGraw blocking a Sam Koch punt into the end zone, where he recovered for a touchdown. Early in the third quarter, Derrick Johnson intercepted an errant Joe Flacco pass and returned it to the Ravens 3 yard line. Chiefs quarterback Brodie Croyle found standout receiver Dwayne Bowe for a touchdown three plays later. The Ravens would respond with an 11 play, five minute drive capped off by a 9 yard touchdown to Todd Heap. After trading touchdowns halfway through the fourth quarter, the Ravens defense forced a turnover on downs, and the Ravens offense capitalized with a Le'Ron McClain 1 yard touchdown run. The Ravens would add an additional touchdown from McGahee in the final minute of the game to open their season with a 38 â 24 win, and the second win in as many home openers. With the win, not only do the Ravens improve to 1â0, they are the only team in the AFC North to win their home opener on Kickoff Sunday; the Pittsburgh Steelers defeated the Tennessee Titans 13 â 10 on Kickoff Night the Thursday prior.

The Chargers host the Ravens in their home debut in San Diego after a narrow escape in the second of two [[2009 NFL season|AFL 50th Anniversary]]-themed division rivalry Monday Night matchups against the Raiders in Oakland. The Chargers jumped out to an early lead when a blown coverage led to an easy 81 yard touchdown pass from Philip Rivers to Darren Sproles. The Ravens answered with Willis McGahee on a 5 yard touchdown run, but the Chargers would increase their advantage on a Nate Kaeding field goal. The offensive display would continue in the second quarter, but the Ravens touchdowns were only answered by Chargers field goals. McGahee found the end zone a second time to take the lead 14 â 10, but the Chargers pulled within one on the second Kaeding field goal. Flacco then found Kelley Washington for Flacco's first touchdown pass of the day and Washington's first touchdown reception as a Raven just inside the 2-minute halftime warning. Rivers led the Chargers down the field in an attempt to answer, but the drive stalled and had to settle for the third of four Kaeding field goals. In the second half, both defenses stiffened. Todd Heap would get his second touchdown catch of the season from Flacco from 9 yards out, but the Chargers responded with a 35 yard touchdown catch from Vincent Jackson. Late in the fourth quarter, interceptions from Flacco and Rivers led to trading field goals. After a Ravens punt, Rivers led the Chargers all the way down to the Ravens 15. The Chargers went for the first down on fourth down to go for the win, but Sproles was stopped by Ray Lewis five yards in the backfield, allowing the Ravens to run the clock out. With the win, not only do the Ravens improve to 2â0, the Ravens take sole possession of first place in the AFC North.

After another high scoring affair in San Diego, the Ravens returned to Baltimore with a one game lead on the Steelers and Bengals and hosted their first AFC North Division game against the Cleveland Browns. (Coincidentally, the Bengals host the Steelers in divisional play in week three as well.) Although this was the third consecutive high scoring game for the Ravens, this was not a close contest. The Ravens struck early on the first of two touchdown runs from Willis McGahee, and would increase their advantage on a Hauschka field goal. In the second quarter, after another Hauschka field goal, McGahee found the end zone again. His second rushing TD leads the NFL with five. Although the Browns wanted to prove they were up to the challenge of contending with a quality football team, miscues thoroughly undid the Browns as quarterbacks Derek Anderson and Brady Quinn combined for four interceptions. Quinn was benched at the half in favor of Anderson, but Anderson was no better than his maligned counterpart. The third quarter only saw another touchdown for the Ravens, but was a special one for Ray Rice, as it was his first career NFL touchdown. The final minutes of the third quarter also saw the Browns longest drive of the day, but as time expired in the third quarter, the Browns were stopped short of the end zone. The fourth quarter opened with the Browns only points of the game on a field goal from Billy Cundiff, a free-agent signee since kicker Phil Dawson was inactive due to a leg injury. The final points of the contest came on the third Anderson interception, which was Ed Reed's first of the season. Flacco's touchdown was not only the longest of the season for him to date, but was the only passing touchdown all day. He hit a wide open Derrick Mason after a blown coverage in the Browns secondary for a 72 yard touchdown. With the win, the Ravens improve to 3â0 and improve to 1â0 in the AFC North.

Coming off their divisional home win over the Browns, the Ravens flew to [[Gillette Stadium]] for a Week 4 battle with the [[New England Patriots]].  After Patriots kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] got a 32-yard field goal in the first quarter, Baltimore got into the game with quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] hooking up with wide receiver [[Derrick Mason]] on a 20-yard touchdown pass.  In the second quarter, New England came back with quarterback [[Tom Brady]]'s 1-yard touchdown run and running back [[Sammy Morris]]' 12-yard touchdown run.

The Ravens would reply in the third quarter with defensive end [[Terrell Suggs]] sacking Brady, causing a fumble which rolled into the Patriots' endzone, where defensive end [[Dwan Edwards]] would land on it for a touchdown.  New England would come right back with Brady's 14-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Randy Moss]].  Baltimore would play some catch-up in the fourth quarter as Flacco found running back [[Willis McGahee]] on a 13-yard touchdown pass, but the Patriots willingly replied with Gostkowski's 33-yard field goal.  Flacco would lead a last-minute drive, but New England's stiffened and came away with the win.

With the tough loss, the Ravens fell to 3â1.

Hoping to rebound from their tough road loss to the Patriots, the Ravens went home for a Week 5 AFC North duel with the [[Cincinnati Bengals]].  The winner would take the lead in the division after five weeks.

After a scoreless first quarter, Baltimore's defense went to work in the second quarter with safety [[Ed Reed]] returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown.  The Bengals would answer with a 32-yard field goal from kicker [[Shayne Graham]].  Near the end of the third quarter, Cincinnati would take the lead on a 28-yard touchdown run from running back [[Cedric Benson]].  The Ravens would respond in the fourth quarter as quarterback [[Joe Flacco]] hooked up with running back [[Ray Rice]] 48-yard touchdown pass.  However, late in the game, the Bengals would deliver the final strike as quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] completed a 20-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Andre Caldwell]].  Baltimore tried to rally, but an interception from cornerback [[Leon Hall]] eliminated any chance of a comeback.

With the loss, the Ravens fell to 3â2.

Also, the defense's 40-game streak of keeping a single rusher under 100 yards was snapped.  The last time that Baltimore allowed a 100-yard rusher was Dec. 10, 2006 against the Chiefs' [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson]].

Trying to snap a two-game losing streak, the Ravens flew to the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] for a Week 6 interconference duel with the [[Minnesota Vikings]].  Baltimore would trail in the first quarter as Vikings quarterback [[Brett Favre]] completed a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Visanthe Shiancoe]] and a 4-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Bernard Berrian]].  Afterwards, the Ravens would snag the only points of the second quarter with kicker [[Steven Hauschka]] making a 29-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, Minnesota would extend its lead as kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] nailed a 40-yard field goal. Baltimore would come right back into the game with running back [[Ray Rice]]'s 22-yard touchdown run, but Longwell helped out the Vikings with a 22-yard field goal.  In a nerve-racking fourth quarter, Minnesota increased its lead with Favre finding Shiancoe again on a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Ravens would respond with quarterback [[Joe Flacco]]'s 32-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Mark Clayton (American football, born 1982)|Mark Clayton]].  After Longwell gave the Vikings a 29-yard field goal, Baltimore would take the lead as Flacco completed a 12-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Derrick Mason]] and Rice getting a 33-yard touchdown run.  Minnesota would regain the lead as Longwell booted a 31-yard field goal.  Flacco would get the Ravens into scoring range, but Hauschka's 44-yard field goal attempt sailed wide left, preserving the Vikings' so-far perfect season.

With the loss, Baltimore went into its bye week at 3â3.

This also marked the first time that the Ravens defense allowed back-to-back 100-yard rushers since 2005 (Bengals' [[Rudi Johnson]] &amp; Texans' [[Domanick Williams]]).

Following a close loss to the [[Indianapolis Colts|Colts]] the prior week, the much-hated Steelers came to town for a rematch of last year's AFC Championship Game. Steelers starting QB [[Ben Roethlisberger]], who suffered a concussion in the previous week's overtime loss to the [[Kansas City Chiefs|Chiefs]] did not start, and was the designated 3rd (emergency) quarterback. Backup [[Charlie Batch]] also was hurt in that game, which left 2nd-year QB [[Dennis Dixon]], who previously had one pass in his NFL career, to start. The Steelers received the opening kickoff, but went three-and-out. On the ensuing possession, the Ravens drove down the field with ease, capping off their drive with a touchdown run by Willis McGahee. In the second quarter, Dixon hit WR [[Santonio Holmes]] on a play-action pass for a 33 yard TD, tying the game. The Ravens answered on the following drive, with a 52-yard strike from Joe Flacco to Mark Clayton, setting up a 10-yard touchdown pass to Derrick Mason. In the third quarter, on the Ravens opening possession, Mark Clayton made a 9 yard reception but fumbled the ball. The ball was kicked 20 yards towards the Steelers endzone by a Pittsburgh player, but recovered by Tyrone Carter. The Steelers drove, but were held to a field goal by Jeff Reed. Later in the 4th quarter, Joe Flacco was sacked by [[Lawrence Timmons]] and fumbled the ball, recovered by the Steelers near midfield. The drive resulted in a 24 yard run on a QB option by Dixon, giving the Steelers their first lead of the night. On the Ravens next possession, things were looking bad when the offense was facing a 3rd and 22 with around 3 minutes left. Joe Flacco completed a pass to Derrick Mason for 17 yards, leaving John Harbaugh with a critical decision. Harbaugh opted to go for it, and Joe Flacco found Ray Rice for a 44-yard reception, setting the Ravens up inside the Steeler 10 yard line with less than 2 minutes left. Billy Cundiff tied the game with a 24 yard field goal. On the following Steeler possession, Dennis Dixon was nearly intercepted by Lardarius Webb. The Steelers were forced to punt, giving the ball back to the Ravens with about 1:30 left in the game. A very good punt return into Steeler territory by [[Chris Carr (American football)|Chris Carr]] was wiped off by a block in the back. Despite the setback, the Ravens managed to drive to the Steeler 40 yard line, where their drive stalled. On 3rd and 9 with 25 seconds left, Joe Flacco was sacked and fumbled, but the ball was recovered by Ben Grubbs. With the clock counting inside 10 seconds left and no timeouts, the field goal team managed to get into formation, and get the kick off. The 56 yard attempt by Billy Cundiff was dead center, but about 2 yards short. In overtime, the Steelers won the toss and got the ball, but were forced to punt. The Ravens, also forced to punt deep in their own territory, gave the ball to Pittsburgh around the Steeler 40 yard line. On a 3rd and 5, Dennis Dixon thew an interception to LB [[Paul Kruger (American football)|Paul Kruger]], who returned the ball 26 yards to the Steeler 28 yard line. Already in field goal range, the Ravens ran the ball down to the Pittsburgh 11 yard line where Billy Cundiff made a 29 yard field goal to win the game.

With the win, both teams' records is 6â5. The Ravens hold the final wild card seed in the AFC due to the head-to-head tiebreaker over Pittsburgh.

Entering the postseason as the AFC's sixth seed, the Ravens began their playoff run at [[Gillette Stadium]] in the AFC Wild Card round against the #3 seeded [[New England Patriots]]. This game was a rematch of their game played during Week 4 of the 2009 season.  The Ravens drew first blood. As [[Ray Rice]] took the hand off from Flacco and ran through a hole in the Defense and on his way to a 83 yard TD! This was the on the Ravens' first offensive play of the game. It was the longest rush of his career and the 2nd longest rush in NFL postseason history.&lt;ref name=&quot;ravenspats&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scores.espn.go.com/nfl/playbyplay?gameId=300110017|title=Baltimore 33, New England 14|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Less than 2 minutes later, LB and DE [[Terrell Suggs]], forces a fumble from New England quarterback [[Tom Brady]]'s hand on a 3rd and 11 pass attempt and recovers for the Ravens on the New England 17. [[Le'Ron McClain]] then capped a 5 play Ravens scoring drive with a 2 yard touchdown plunge, extending the lead to 14â0.&lt;ref name=&quot;ravenspats&quot;/&gt; The Ravens capitalized on another New England miscue when cornerback [[Chris Carr (American football)|Chris Carr]] intercepted a Tom Brady pass. After a 6 play 26 yard drive Ray Rice hopped into the end-zone for his second touchdown of the quarter. On the Patriots very next possession another Tom Brady pass is intercepted by safety [[Ed Reed]]. Reed took the interception and returned it 25 yards before handing it off to Dawan Landry who took it another 25 yards. This led to leading to a Ravens field goal and a 24â0 first quarter lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;ravenspats&quot;/&gt; The Ravens went on to defeat the Patriots by a final score of 33â14. The Ravens would advance to face the top-seeded Colts in the Divisional Round.

Coming off their impressive Wild Card road win over the Patriots, the Ravens flew to [[Lucas Oil Stadium]] for the AFC Divisional Round against the top-seeded [[Indianapolis Colts]].  Baltimore would trail to begin the first quarter as former Ravens kicker [[Matt Stover]] got a 44-yard field goal.  The Ravens would respond with kicker [[Billy Cundiff]] making a 25-yard field goal.  However, the Colts rebounded in the second quarter as quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] completed a 10-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Austin Collie]] and a 3-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Reggie Wayne]].  Following a scoreless third quarter, Baltimore's deficit increased in the fourth quarter as Stover gave Indianapolis a 33-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Ravens' season ended with an overall record of 10â8.
