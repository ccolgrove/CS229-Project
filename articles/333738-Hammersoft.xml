'''Thomas Montgomery Newman''' (born October 20, 1955) is an American [[composer]] and [[conducting|conductor]], best known for his many film scores. He is one of the more respected and recognized composers for modern film and has scored over fifty feature films in a career which spans nearly three decades.

Newman has received a total of ten [[Academy Award]] nominations, although as of 2011, he has yet to win the award.  He has however won a [[British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]], two [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] and an [[Emmy Awards|Emmy]], and has been nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]].  Newman was honored with the Richard Kirk award at the 2000 [[Broadcast Music Incorporated|BMI]] Film and TV Awards.  The award is given annually to a composer who has made significant contributions to film and television music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bmi.com/news/entry/233494 |title=Richard Kirk Award: Thomas Newman Fulfills the Promise of His Legacy|publisher=bmi.com|accessdate=2010-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in Los Angeles, California, he was the youngest son of Mississippi-born Martha Louise (nÃ©e Montgomery) and composer [[Alfred Newman]]. He is a member of a film-scoring dynasty in [[Hollywood]] that includes his father, brother [[David Newman (composer)|David Newman]], sister Maria Newman, uncle [[Lionel Newman]] and his cousins [[Joey Newman]] and [[Randy Newman]] (who is also known as a singer and songwriter). Newman was educated at [[Yale University]] before starting his career in music.

==Film scoring career==
His first major score was for the 1984 film ''[[Reckless (1984 film)|Reckless]]''. In 1999, Newman composed the score to [[Sam Mendes]]' first feature film ''[[American Beauty (film)|American Beauty]]'', created using mainly percussion instruments.  Newman believed the score helped move the film along without disturbing the &quot;moral ambiguity&quot; of the script, saying &quot;It was a real delicate balancing act in terms of what music worked to preserve that.&quot;  This was his first collaboration with Mendes, and he would go on to score all of the director's subsequent films except for ''[[Away We Go]]''.  He received a fourth Oscar nomination for this score, and although he lost again (to [[John Corigliano]] for ''[[The Red Violin]]''), he did receive a [[Grammy]] and a [[BAFTA]].

His critical and commercial success has continued in recent years with his scores for films such as ''[[The Green Mile (film)|The Green Mile]]'', ''[[Erin Brockovich]]'', ''[[In the Bedroom]]'', and ''[[The Salton Sea]]''.  He was nominated consecutively for a further three Academy Awards, for ''[[Road to Perdition]]'' (2002), ''[[Finding Nemo]]'' (2003), and ''[[Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events]]'' (2004).  However, he lost on each occasion, to [[Elliot Goldenthal]] (for ''[[Frida]]''), [[Howard Shore]] (for ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King]]''), and [[Jan A. P. Kaczmarek]] (for ''[[Finding Neverland]]'') respectively.

He was again nominated for an Oscar for scoring [[Steven Soderbergh]]'s ''[[The Good German]]'' (2006).  At the Oscar ceremony, he appeared in the opening segment by [[Errol Morris]], who jokingly stated that Newman had been nominated for and failed to win an Oscar eight times.  Newman replied: &quot;No, I've failed seven but this will be my eighth&quot;, and indeed, he again lost, this time to [[Gustavo Santaolalla]] for ''[[Babel (film)|Babel]]''.

His first score since ''[[The Good German]]'' was for the 2008 animated film ''[[WALL-E]]'', collaborating for the second time with director [[Andrew Stanton]] (with the first collaboration being ''[[Finding Nemo]]'').  The film won the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature (as had &quot;Nemo&quot;).  Newman received two Oscar nominations: one for Best Original Score, and another for Best Original Song for &quot;Down to Earth&quot;, which he co-wrote with [[Peter Gabriel]].  He was nominated in the Original Score category with two other veteran composers, [[James Newton-Howard]] and [[Danny Elfman]], both of whom have also been nominated for several Oscars but each time unsuccessfully.  Newman lost both the score and song nominations to [[A R Rahman]] for his work on ''[[Slumdog Millionaire]]''.  He and Peter Gabriel did however win a Grammy for &quot;Down to Earth&quot;.

During 2008 Newman also scored ''[[Towelhead (film)|Towelhead]]'' and Sam Mendes' ''[[Revolutionary Road]]''.  He scored ''[[Brothers (2009 film)|Brothers]]'' in 2009.

Newman's scores of 2011 include &quot;The Help&quot;, &quot;Great Hope Springs&quot;, John Madden's ''[[The Debt (2011 film)|The Debt]]'' and ''[[The Adjustment Bureau]]''.
