'''Novell, Inc.''' ({{IPA-en|noÊËvÉl|pron}};) is a multinational [[software]] and [[outsourcing|services]] company. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of [[Attachmate|The Attachmate Group]]. It specializes in network operating systems, such as [[Novell NetWare]]; systems management solutions, such as [[Novell ZENworks]]; and collaboration solutions, such as [[Novell Groupwise]] and [[Novell Vibe]].

Novell was instrumental in making the [[Utah Valley]] a focus for technology and software development.  Novell technology contributed to the emergence of [[local area network]]s, which displaced the dominant [[mainframe computer|mainframe computing]] model and changed computing worldwide.  Today, a primary focus of the company is on developing [[open source]] software for [[Business|enterprise]] clients.

== History ==
Novell owes its beginnings to the [[Eyring Research Institute]] (ERI) in Provo, Utah. [[Dennis Fairclough]], [[Drew Major]], [[Dale Neibaur]] and [[Kyle Powell]] left ERI and took with them the experience and technology to found Novell. Fairclough was the member of the original team that started Novell Data Systems. Major, Neibaur and Powell went on to form [[SuperSet]] Software. Fairclough was the original founder of Novell, who was dismissed when [[Ray Noorda]] came to Novell. Major, Neibaur and Powell continued to support Novell through their [[SuperSet]] Software Group.

At ERI, Fairclough, Major, Neibaur and Powell worked on government contracts for the Intelligent Systems Technology Project, and gained an important insight into the [[ARPANET]] and related technologies, ideas which would become crucial to the foundation of Novell.

{{quote|text=ERI spawned many high-tech spin-offs, including [[WordPerfect]], Novell, and Dynix in computers and some in the military and communication areas that have all benefited the world.|sign=Cleo Harmon, wife of the Founder and the Secretary of the President at [[Eyring Research Institute]]|source=''The Life of Frank Carlyle Harmon'', published 1999.}}

The company began in 1979 in [[Provo, Utah]] as Novell Data Systems Inc., a [[hardware]] [[manufacturer]] producing [[CP/M]]-based systems. It was co-founded by [[George Canova]], [[Darin Field]], and [[Jack Davis (Novell co-founder)|Jack Davis]]. [[Victor V. Vurpillat]] brought the deal to [[Pete Musser]], chairman of the board of [[Safeguard Scientifics, Inc.]], who provided the seed funding. The micro computer that was produced by the company was comparatively weak against performance by competitors. In order to compete on systems sales Novell wrote a program to link more than one to operate micro computer together. The company initially did not do well, and both Davis and Canova left the firm. The Safeguard board then ordered Musser to shut Novell down. Musser contacted two Safeguard investors and investment bankers, Barry Rubenstein and Fred Dolin, who guaranteed to raise the necessary funds to continue the business as a software company. Novell's networking program could work on computers from other companies. They, along with Jack Messman, interviewed and hired [[Raymond Noorda]]. The required funding was obtained through a rights offering to Safeguard shareholders, managed by the Cleveland brokerage house, Prescott, Ball and Turben, and guaranteed by Rubenstein and Dolin.

In January 1983, the company's name was shortened to Novell, Inc., and Raymond Noorda became the head of the firm.  Later that same year, the company introduced its most significant product, the multi-[[System platform|platform]] [[network operating system]] (NOS), [[Novell NetWare]].

=== NetWare ===
The first Novell product was a proprietary hardware server based on [[Motorola 6800]] [[CPU]] supporting 6 [[MUX]] ports per board for a maximum of 4 boards per server using a [[star topology]] with [[twisted pair]] cabling. A [[network interface card]] (NIC) was developed for the IBM PC [[industry standard architecture]] (ISA) bus. The server was using the first [[network operating system]] (NOS) called [[ShareNet]]. Later, ShareNet was ported to run on the [[Intel]] platform and renamed NetWare. The first commercial release of NetWare was version 1.5.

Novell based its [[network protocol]] on [[Xerox Network Systems]] (XNS), and created its own standards from IDP and SPP, which it named [[Internetwork Packet Exchange]] (IPX) and [[IPX/SPX|Sequenced Packet Exchange]] (SPX). File and print services ran on the [[NetWare Core Protocol]] (NCP) over IPX, as did [[Routing Information Protocol]] (RIP) and [[Service Advertising Protocol]] (SAP).

NetWare uses Novell DOS (formerly [[DR-DOS]]) as a boot loader. Novell DOS is similar to [[MS-DOS]] and [[IBM]] [[PC-DOS]], but no extra license for DOS is required; this came from the acquisition of [[Digital Research]] in 1991. Novell had already acquired [[Kanwal Rekhi]]'s company [[Excelan]], which manufactured smart [[ethernet]] cards and commercialized the internet protocol [[TCP/IP]], solidifying Novell's presence in these niche areas.

It was around this time also that [[Ed Tittel]] of [[HTML]] [[For Dummies]] notoriety became involved with Novell. Tittel took up various positions within the newly acquired Excelan, becoming national marketing manager for Novell, before being named as Novell's director of technical marketing.

Novell did extremely well throughout the 1980s. It aggressively expanded its market share by selling the expensive [[ethernet card]]s at cost. By 1990, Novell had an almost [[monopoly|monopolistic]] position in NOS for any business requiring a network.

With this market leadership, Novell began to acquire and build services on top of its NetWare operating platform. These services extended NetWare's capabilities with such products as NetWare for SAA, Novell multi-protocol router, [[GroupWise]] and [[BorderManager]].

=== Beyond NetWare ===
However, Novell was also diversifying, moving away from its smaller users to target large corporations, although the company later attempted to refocus with NetWare for Small Business. It reduced investment in research and was slow to improve the product administration tools, although it was helped by the fact its products typically needed little &quot;tweaking&quot;&amp;nbsp;â they just ran.

In June 1993, the company bought [[Unix System Laboratories]] from [[AT&amp;T]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grokline.net/detail_vendor.php?id=20|title=Grokline Project:Novell|work=[[Grokline]]|accessdate=2008-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; acquiring rights to the [[Unix]] operating system, seemingly in an attempt to challenge [[Microsoft]]. In 1994, Novell bought [[WordPerfect]], as well as the [[Quattro Pro]] from [[Borland]]. These acquisitions did not last. Novell in 1995 assigned portions of its Unix business to the [[Santa Cruz Operation]]. WordPerfect and Quattro Pro were sold to [[Corel]] in 1996. [[Novell DOS]] was also sold to [[Caldera (company)|Caldera]] in 1996.

As Novell faced new competition, Noorda was replaced by [[Robert Frankenberg]] in 1994,&lt;ref name=&quot;fisher1994&quot;&gt;Fisher, Lawrence M. (April 6, 1994). Longtime Hewlett Executive Named Novell Chief. ''[[New York Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; and was followed by several CEOs who served short terms. One of Novell's major innovations at the time was Novell Directory Services (NDS), now known as [[eDirectory]]. Introduced with [[NetWare]] v4.0. eDirectory replaced the old [[Bindery server]] and user management technology employed by [[NetWare#NetWare_3.x|NetWare 3.x]] and earlier.

In 1996, the company began a move into internet-enabled products, replacing reliance on the proprietary IPX protocol in favor of a native TCP/IP stack. The move was accelerated when [[Eric Schmidt]] became CEO in 1997 and then Christopher Stone was brought in. The result was NetWare v5.0, released in October 1998, which leveraged and built upon eDirectory and introduced new functions, such as Novell Cluster Services (NCS, a replacement for SFT-III) and Novell Storage Services (NSS), a replacement for the Traditional/FAT filesystem used by earlier versions of NetWare. While NetWare v5.0 introduced native TCP/IP support into the NOS, IPX was still supported, allowing for smooth transitions between environments and avoiding the &quot;forklift upgrades&quot; frequently required by competing environments. Similarly, the Traditional/FAT file system remained a supported option.

However, by 1999, Novell had lost its dominant market position, and was continually being out-marketed by [[Microsoft]], which gained access to corporate data centers by bypassing technical staff and selling directly to corporate executives. Microsoft worked to make NetWare look second place with [[Windows 2000]] features such as Group Policy. Microsoft's [[GUI]] was also more popular and looked more modern than the character-based Novell interfaces. With falling revenue, the company focused on net services and platform interoperability. Products such as eDirectory and GroupWise were made multi-platform.

In October 2000, Novell released a new product, dubbed DirXML, which was designed to synchronize data, often user information, between disparate directory and database systems. This product leveraged the speed and functionality of eDirectory to store information, and would later become the [[Novell Identity Manager]] and form the foundation of a core product set within Novell.

In July 2001, Novell acquired the consulting company, [[Cambridge Technology Partners]], founded in [[Cambridge, MA]] by [[John J. Donovan]], to expand offerings into services. Novell felt that the ability to offer solutions (a combination of software and services) was key to satisfying customer demand. The merger was apparently against the firm's software development culture, and the finance personnel at the firm also recommended against it. The CEO of CTP, [[Jack Messman]], engineered the merger using his position as a board member of Novell since its inception and soon became CEO of Novell as well.  He then hired back Chris Stone as vice chairman and CEO to set the course for Novell's strategy into open source and enterprise Linux.  With the acquisition of CTP, Novell moved its headquarters to [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2002/04/29/story5.html |title=Cambridge-bound Novell pins recovery on CTP buy&amp;nbsp;â Boston Business Journal: |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date= 2002-04-29|accessdate=2008-11-04 |first=Phil |last=Sweeney}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2002, Novell acquired SilverStream Software, a leader in web services-oriented application, but a laggard in the marketplace. The business area called [[Novell exteNd]] contains [[XML]] and [[Web Service]] tools based on [[Java EE]].

=== Linux for Business ===
In August 2003, Novell acquired [[Ximian]], a developer of [[open source]] [[Linux]] applications ([[Novell Evolution|Evolution]], [[Red Carpet (software)|Red Carpet]] and [[Mono (software)|Mono]]). This acquisition signaled Novell's plans to move its collective product set onto a [[Linux kernel]].

In November 2003, Novell acquired [[SUSE Linux|SuSE]], a developer of a leading [[Linux distribution]], which led to a major shift of power in Linux distributions. [[IBM]] also invested $50 million to show support of the SuSE acquisition. Within the [[openSUSE]] project, Novell continues to contribute to SUSE Linux.  openSUSE can be downloaded freely and available as boxed retail product [http://www.open-slx.com/doku.php] with formal support [http://www.open-slx.com/doku.php?id=support].

In mid-2003, Novell released &quot;Novell eNterprise Linux Services&quot; (NNLS), which ported some of the services traditionally associated with [[NetWare]] to [[SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server]] (SLES) version 8.

In November 2004, Novell released the Linux-based enterprise desktop [[Novell Linux Desktop]] v9. This product was based on Ximian Desktop and SUSE Linux Professional 9.1. This was Novell's first attempt to get into the enterprise desktop market.

The successor product to [[NetWare]], ''[[Novell Open Enterprise Server|Open Enterprise Server]]'', was released in March 2005. OES offers all the services previously hosted by [[NetWare]] v6.5, and added the choice of delivering those services using either a [[NetWare]] v6.5 or [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] v9 kernel. The release was aimed to persuade [[NetWare]] customers to move to Linux.

=== Stagnation ===
From 2003 through 2005 Novell released many products across its portfolio, with the intention of arresting falling market share and to move away from dependencies on other Novell products, but the launches were not as successful as Novell had hoped. In late 2004, Chris Stone left the company after an apparent control issue with then Chairman Jack Messman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/05_44/b3957125.htm |title=Cold Realities For Novell |publisher=Businessweek.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to cut costs, Novell announced a round of layoffs in late 2005. While revenue from its Linux business continued to grow, the growth was not fast enough to stop the decrease in revenue of [[NetWare]]. While the company's revenue was not falling rapidly, it wasn't growing, either. Lack of clear direction or effective management meant that Novell took longer than expected to complete its restructuring.

In June 2006, chief executive [[Jack Messman]] and chief finance officer [[Joseph Tibbetts]] were fired, with [[Ronald Hovsepian]], Novell's president and chief operating officer, appointed chief executive, and [[Dana Russell]], vice-president of finance and corporate controller, appointed interim CFO.

=== &quot;Your Linux is Ready&quot; ===
In August 2006, Novell released the SUSE Linux Enterprise 10 (SLE 10) series. SUSE Linux Enterprise Server was the first enterprise class Linux server to offer virtualization based on the [[Xen]] hypervisor. SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (popularly known as SLED) featured a new user-friendly GUI and [[XGL]]-based 3D display capabilities. The release of SLE 10 was marketed with the phrase &quot;Your Linux is Ready&quot;, meant to convey that Novell's Linux offerings were ready for the enterprise. In late September 2006 Novell announced a real time version of SLES called [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Real Time]] (SLERT) based on technology from [[Concurrent Computer Corporation]].

=== {{Visible anchor|Agreement with Microsoft}}===
On November 2, 2006, Novell and [[Microsoft]] announced a joint patent agreement to cover their respective products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/nov06/11-02MSNovellPR.mspx |title=Microsoft and Novell Announce Broad Collaboration on Windows and Linux Interoperability and Support |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/2006/11-02NovellInterop.mspx |title=Steve Ballmer: Microsoft and Novell Collaboration Announcement |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also promised to work more closely, to improve compatibility of software, setting up a joint research facility. Executives of both companies hope such cooperation will lead to better compatibility between [[Microsoft Office]] and [[OpenOffice.org]] and better [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] techniques.

Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] said of the deal, &quot;This set of agreements will really help bridge the divide between open-source and proprietary source software.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.com.com/Microsoft+makes+Linux+pact+with+Novell/2100-1016_3-6132119.html?tag=nefd.lede |title=Microsoft makes Linux pact with Novell&amp;nbsp;â CNET News.com |publisher=News.com.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The deal involves upfront payment of $348 million from Microsoft to Novell for patent cooperation and [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server|SLES]] subscription. Additionally, Microsoft will spend around $46 million yearly, over the next 5 years, for marketing and selling a combined SLES/Windows Server offering and related virtualization solutions, while Novell will pay at least $40 million yearly to Microsoft, in the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS7235986827.html |title=Novell gets $348 million from Microsoft |publisher=Linux-watch.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first results of this partnership was that Novell adapted the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/odf-converter OpenXML/ODF Translator] for use in [[OpenOffice.org]].&lt;ref&gt;http://download.novell.com/SummaryFree.jsp?buildid=ESrjfdE4U58%7E&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reaction of FOSS community====
Initial reaction from members of the [[free and open source software|FOSS]] community over the patent protection was mostly critical, with expressions of concern that Novell had &quot;sold out&quot; and of doubt that the [[GPL]] would allow distribution of code, including the Linux kernel, under this exclusive agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20061102175508403 |title=Groklaw&amp;nbsp;â Novell Sells Out |publisher=Groklaw.net |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20061103073628401 |title=Groklaw&amp;nbsp;â The Morning After&amp;nbsp;â Reactions to Novell-MS&amp;nbsp;â Updated 2xs |publisher=Groklaw.net |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/207559/ |title=Various responses to Microsoft/Novell [LWN.net&amp;#93; |publisher=Lwn.net |date= November 3, 2006 |author=corbet |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the FOSS development community on November 9 2006, [[Bradley M. Kuhn]], CTO of the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] described the agreement as &quot;worse than useless.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/news/20061109a.html |title=Bradley M. Kuhn's Letter to the FOSS Development Community Regarding Microsoft's Patent Promise&amp;nbsp;â Software Freedom Law Center |publisher=Softwarefreedom.org |date=November 9, 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a separate development the chairman of the [[SFLC]], [[Eben Moglen]], reported that Novell had offered cooperation with the SFLC to permit a confidential audit to determine the compliance of the agreement with the GPL (version 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2168151/novells-opens-microsoft |title=Novell opens legal books to GPL pundits&amp;nbsp;â vnunet.com |publisher=Vnunet.com |author=Written by Tom Sanders in California |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Stallman]], founder of the [[Free Software Foundation]], said in November 2006 that changes coming with the version 3 of the [[GPL]] will preclude such deals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/tokyo-rms-transcript.en.html#novell-ms |title=GPLv3&amp;nbsp;â Transcript of Richard Stallman from the fifth international GPLv3 conference, Tokyo, Japan; 2006-11-21 |publisher=Fsfeurope.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the final revision of the third version of the GPL license was decided, the deal between Microsoft and Novell was [[grandfather clause|grandfather]]ed in. A new clause will let companies like Novell distribute GPLv3 software even if they have made such patent partnerships in the past, as long as the partnership deal was made before March 28, 2007 (GPLv3 Section 11 paragraph 7 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0-standalone.html |title=GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 3 |publisher=fsf.org |date= |accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

On November 12 2006, the [[Samba (software)|Samba]] team expressed strong disapproval of Novell's announcement on November 2 2006 and asked Novell to reconsider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.samba.org/announcements/team_to_novell/ |title=Samba Team Asks Novell to Reconsider |publisher=News.samba.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Samba team includes an employee of Novell, [[Jeremy Allison]], who confirmed in a comment on [[Slashdot]] that the statement was agreed on by all members of the team,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=206202&amp;cid=16817478 |title=Samba Team Urges Novell To Reconsider |publisher=Slashdot.org |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later quit his job at Novell in protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20061221081000710 |title=Groklaw&amp;nbsp;â Jeremy Allison Has Resigned from Novell to Protest MS Patent Deal |publisher=Groklaw.net |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early February 2007, Reuters reported that the [[Free Software Foundation]] had announced that it was reviewing Novell's right to sell Linux versions, and may even ban Novell from selling Linux, because of an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://today.reuters.com/misc/PrinterFriendlyPopup.aspx?type=technologyNews&amp;storyID=2007-02-02T230933Z_01_N02280856_RTRUKOC_0_US-NOVELL-LINUX.xml] see quote from [[Eben Moglen]], the Foundation's general counsel: ''&quot;The community of people wants to do anything they can to interfere with this deal and all deals like it. They have every reason to be deeply concerned that this is the beginning of a significant patent aggression by Microsoft&quot;''.&lt;/ref&gt; However [[Eben Moglen]] later said that he was quoted out of context.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS6837365670.html Linux-Watch]&lt;/ref&gt; He was explaining that [[GPL]] version 3 will be designed to block similar deals in the future. Currently, Novell is not violating the GPL version 2&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux.com/feature/60030 |title=Is Novell losing Linux? No, it's just bad reporting |publisher=Linux.com |date= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the GPLv3 prevents such deals being made in the future.&lt;ref&gt;http://gplv3.fsf.org/dd3-faq&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has released two public covenants not to sue for the infringement of its patents when using Moonlight.  The two covenants require the implementation to not to be released in GPLv3 .&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/newmoonlight.mspx&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/moonlight.mspx&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intelligent Workload Management ===
In December 2009, Novell announced its intention to lead the market it identified as [[intelligent workload management]] (IWM).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/features/article.php/3851851/Novell-Delivers-Workload-Automation-Strategy-Tools|title=Novell Delivers Workload Automation Strategy, Tools|date=2009-12-08|publisher=Datamation|accessdate=2010-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's products will enable customers to manage diverse workloads in a heterogeneous data center.

=== Acquisition by Attachmate ===
Novell had long been rumored to be a target for acquisition by a variety of other companies.  On March 2, 2010, Elliott Associates, L.P., an institutional investor with approximately 8.5% stock ownership of Novell, offered to acquire the company for $5.75 per share in cash, or $1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/elliott-offers-to-acquire-novell-86009382.html|title=Elliott Offers to Acquire Novell|date=2010-03-02|publisher=PR Newswire}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 20, 2010,  the company declined the offer and stated that the proposal was inadequate and that it undervalued the Company's franchise and growth prospects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2010/032010-novell-rejects-takeover.html|title=Novell rejects &quot;inadequate&quot; $2B takeover bid|date=2010-03-20|publisher=Networkworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novell announced in November 2010 that it had agreed to be acquired by [[Attachmate]] for $2.2 billion. Attachmate plans to operate Novell as two units, one being [[SUSE Linux distributions|SUSE]]. As part of the deal, 882 [[Software patent|patents]] owned by Novell are planned to be sold to [[CPTN Holdings]] LLC, a consortium of companies led by [[Microsoft]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/758004/000119312510265964/d8k.htm|title=FORM 8-K&amp;nbsp;â Novell Inc.

On 27 April 2011, Novell announced that the merger with Attachmate had been completed, with Attachmate paying $6.10 per share in cash to acquire Novell.  Immediately prior, Novell completed the sale of &quot;certain identified issued patents and patent applications&quot; to CPTN Holdings LLC for $450 million in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Novell Completes Merger with Attachmate and Patent Sale to CPTN Holdings LLC|url=http://www.novell.com/news/press/2011/4/novell-completes-merger-with-attachmate-and-patent-sale-to-cptn-holdings-llc.html|publisher=Novell|accessdate=28 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novell is now a wholly owned subsidiary of The Attachmate Group, the parent company of Attachmate Corporation.

The U.S. Department of Justice announced that in order to proceed with the first phase of their acquisition of certain patents and patent applications from Novell Inc., CPTN Holdings LLC and its owners altered their original agreements to address the department's antitrust concerns. The department said that, as originally proposed, the deal would jeopardize the ability of open source software, such as Linux, to continue to innovate and compete in the development and distribution of server, desktop, and mobile operating systems, middleware, and virtualization products.
With regard to licensing the patents:
* All of the Novell patents will be acquired subject to the GNU General Public License, Version 2, a widely adopted open-source license, and the Open Invention Network (OIN) License, a significant license for the Linux System;
* CPTN does not have the right to limit which of the patents, if any, are available under the OIN license; and
* Neither CPTN nor its owners will make any statement or take any action with the purpose of influencing or encouraging either Novell or Attachmate to modify which of the patents are available under the OIN license.

Concurrent with the closing of the acquisition, some of Novell's products and brands were transferred to another [[Attachmate Group]] business units, [[NetIQ]], and the [[SUSE Linux]] brand was spun off as its own business unit. The fourth business unit, [[Attachmate]], was not directly impacted by the acquisition.

On April 2011, Attachmate announced layoffs for the Novell workforce, including hundreds of employees from their [[Provo, Utah|Provo]] [[Utah Valley]] center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
