'''Windows 8''' is the codename for the next version of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[computer]] [[operating system]] following [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sinofsky shows off Windows 8 at D9 |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31021_3-20068119-260.html?tag=topStories1 |accessdate=2 June 2011 |publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has many changes from previous versions. In particular it adds support for [[ARM architecture|ARM microprocessors]] in addition to the previously supported [[x86]] microprocessors from [[Intel]] and [[AMD]]. A new Start Screen interface has been added that was designed for [[touchscreen]] input in addition to mouse, keyboard, and [[Pen computing|pen]] input.

==History and development==
===Early announcements===
In January 2011, at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] (CES), Microsoft announced that Windows 8 would be adding support for [[ARM architecture|ARM microprocessors]] in addition to the [[x86]] microprocessors from [[Intel]] and [[AMD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2011/jan11/01-05SOCsupport.mspx |title=Microsoft Announces Support of System on a Chip Architectures From Intel, AMD, and ARM for Next Version of Windows |work=[[Microsoft]] |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2011/01/05/businessinsider-microsoft-spills-beans-on--at-ces-2011-1.DTL |title=OK, So Windows Is Coming To ARM Tablets...Someday (MSFT) |newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] |first=Matt |last=Rosoff |date=January 5, 2011 |accessdate=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milestone leaks===

A 32-bit Milestone 1 build, build 7850, with a build date of September 22, 2010, was leaked to BetaArchive, an online beta community, which was soon leaked to P2P/torrent sharing networks on April 12, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows7themes.net/leak-windows-8-m1-build-7850-screenshots.html |title=Leak: Windows 8 M1 Build 7850 Screenshots}}&lt;/ref&gt; Milestone 1 includes a [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon]] interface for Windows Explorer,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-secrets-windows-explorer-ribbon-130084 |title=Windows 8 Secrets: Windows Explorer Ribbon |publisher=SuperSite for Windows

A 32-bit Milestone 2 build, build 7927, was leaked to [[The Pirate Bay]] on August 29, 2011 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winrumors.com/windows-8-milestone-2-build-7927-leaks/ |title=Windows 8 Build 7927 x86 leak.}}&lt;/ref&gt; right after many pictures leaked on BetaArchive the day before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betaarchive.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=6&amp;t=21710 |title=Windows 8 6.2.7927.x86fre screenshots .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features of this build are mostly the same as build 7955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultrawindows.nl/tmp/windows/windows8/6279270|title=Windows 8 (7927) â UltraWindows.nl|date=29 august 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 32-bit Milestone 2 build, build 7955, was leaked to BetaArchive on April 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winrumors.com/early-windows-8-milestone-2-build-7955-leaked/ |title=Windows 8 Build 7955 x86 leak.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Features of this build included a new pattern login and a new file system known as [[Protogon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ultrawindows.nl/tmp/windows/windows8/6279550|title=Windows 8 â UltraWindows.nl|date=15 juni 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A 64-bit Milestone 3 build, build 7959, was leaked to BetaArchive on May 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winrumors.com/windows-server-8-milestone-3-build-7959-leaked/ |title=Windows Server 8 Build 7959 x64 leak.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This build is notable for being the first publicly leaked Windows Server 8 build, as well as the first leaked 64-bit build.

A Milestone 3 build, build 7971, was released to close partners of Microsoft on March 29, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://windows8center.com/news/microsoft-begins-shipping-windows-8-build-7971-via-connect/ |title=Microsoft begins shipping Windows 8 Build 7971 via Connect |publisher=Windows 8 Center |first=Albert |date=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was kept under heavy security. However, a few screenshots were leaked. The &quot;Windows 7 Basic&quot; theme now uses similar metrics to the Aero style, but maintains its non-hardware accelerated design, and also supports taskbar thumbnails. The boxes that encase the &quot;close, maximize, and minimize&quot; buttons have been removed, leaving just the signs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windows8news.com/2011/03/16/windows-8-aero-light-ui-revealed/ |title=Windows 8 Aero Light UI Revealed |publisher=Windows 8 News |date=2011-03-16 |accessdate=2011-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 64-bit Milestone 3 build, build 7989, leaked to BetaArchive on June 18, 2011 after screenshots were revealed the previous day. An SMS feature, a new virtual keyboard, a new bootscreen, transparency in the basic theme, geo-location services, [[Hyper-V]] 3.0, and [[Windows PowerShell|PowerShell]] 3.0 were revealed in this build.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itproportal.com/2011/06/21/windows-8-build-7989-leaked-features-many-new-enhancements/ |title=Windows 8 Build 7989 Leaked, Features Many New Enhancements |publisher=ITProPortal.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Official announcements===
At the Microsoft Developer Forum in Tokyo on May 23, 2011, Microsoft CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] announced that the next version of Windows would be released the following year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballmer at MDF Tokyo 2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Ballmer |first=Steve |title=Steve Ballmer: Microsoft Developer Forum |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/steve/2011/05-23Developer.mspx |work=Microsoft News Center |publisher=Microsoft Corporation |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&quot;And yet, as we look forward to the next generation of Windows systems, which will come out next year, there's a whole lot more coming. As we progress through the year, you ought to expect to hear a lot about Windows 8. Windows 8 slates, tablets, PCs, a variety of different form factors.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ballmer at MDF Tokyo 2011&quot; /&gt;

However, Microsoft quickly amended Ballmer's words in a statement issued that afternoon:

:&quot;It appears there was a misstatement. We are eagerly awaiting the next generation of Windows 7 hardware that will be available in the coming fiscal year. To date, we have yet to formally announce any timing or naming for the next version of Windows.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Keizer |first=Gregg |title=Microsoft backpedals from Ballmer's Windows 8 comments |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217000/Microsoft_backpedals_from_Ballmer_s_Windows_8_comments?taxonomyId=18 |publisher=Computerworld Inc. |accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 1, 2011, Microsoft officially unveiled Windows 8 and some of its new features at the ''Taipei Computex 2011'' in Taipei (Taiwan) by Mike Angiulo and at the ''D9 conference'' in California (United States) by Julie Larson-Green and Microsoft's Windows President [[Steven Sinofsky]].&lt;ref name=microsoftconference&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft Computex D9 Conference on Engadget.com |url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/01/live-from-microsofts-windows-8-preview-event-at-computex-2011/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=win8preview&gt;{{cite web |title=Previewing 'Windows 8' at Microsoft Website |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/features/2011/jun11/06-01corporatenews.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main feature that was shown was the new user interface.

On August 15, 2011, Microsoft opened a new blog called &quot;Building Windows 8&quot; for users and developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Sinofsky |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/08/15/welcome-to-building-windows-8.aspx |title=Welcome to Building Windows 8 â Building Windows 8 â Site Home â MSDN Blogs |publisher=Blogs.msdn.com |date=2011-08-15 |accessdate=2011-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Build conference and developer preview===
Microsoft unveiled new Windows 8 features and improvements on September 13, 2011, day one of the BUILD developer conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;W8PreviewGuide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/E/4/1E455D53-C382-4A39-BA73-55413F183333/Windows_Developer_Preview-Windows8_guide.pdf |title=Windows 8 Developer Preview Guide |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft also released a Developer Preview build (Build 8102) of Windows 8 for the developer community to download and start working with. This developer preview includes tools for building &quot;metro style apps&quot;, such as [[Microsoft Windows SDK]] for Metro style apps, Microsoft Visual Studio 11 Express for Windows 8 Developer Preview and [[Microsoft Expression Blend]] 5 Developer Preview.&lt;ref name=BUILD&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows BUILD by Microsoft |url=http://www.buildwindows.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft has shown a development roadmap at the BUILD conference stating that the coming milestones will be Beta, Release Candidate, [[Release to manufacture|RTM]], and general availability.

According to Microsoft, there were more than 500,000 downloads of the Windows 8 Developer Preview within the first 12 hours of its release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/09/14/steve-ballmer-touts-500-000-windows-8-downloads-in-less-than-12/ |title=Steve Ballmer touts 500,000 Windows 8 downloads in less than 12 hours |publisher=Engadget |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New features==
[[File:Windows To Go USB Drive.png|thumb|Bootable [[Windows To Go]] USB flash drive]]
{{Main|Features new to Windows 8}}

Windows 8 will contain a new user interface based on Microsoft's [[design language]] named [[Metro (design language)|Metro]].  With the new change, the Start Menu was replaced in favor for the new Start Screen, where  there are tiles that contain shortcuts to applications, Metro style applications, and updating tiles, similar to [[Windows Phone]].

A new authentication method allows users to sketch in three different places over the picture to login, instead of typing a password.&lt;ref&gt;[http://channel9.msdn.com/events/BUILD/BUILD2011/KEY-0001 Keynote #1 | BUILD2011 | Channel 9].

Windows 8 Beta (2011-09-21). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows Explorer]] now uses a [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon interface]], similar to those used in Microsoft Office applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mashable.com/2011/04/03/windows-8-leaked-pics/ Mashable Tech â Spy Shots: Windows 8 With a Ribbon Interface?]. Mashable.com (2011-04-03). Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature expected to be introduced in Windows 8 is native [[USB 3.0]] support, without the need to load drivers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anandtech.com/show/4665/native-usb-30-support-coming-to-windows-8 Native USB 3.0 Support Coming to Windows 8]. AnandTech. Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8 will come with [[Windows Store (Windows 8)|Windows Store]], an online marketplace for buying, selling, and advertising applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.electronista.com/articles/11/09/19/windows.8.app.store.limits.raise.antitrust.issues/ Microsoft limits Windows 8 Metro apps to its own store]. Electronista. Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8 can be run from a USB-connected drive, such as a flash drive. This feature is called [[Windows To Go]]. It is intended for enterprise administrators to provide users with a Windows 8 image that reflects the corporate desktop; pricing and licensing details were not discussed when the feature was announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcpmag.com/articles/2011/09/16/microsoft-unveils-windows-to-go-for-the-enterprise.aspx Microsoft Certified Professional Magazine: Windows 8 Will Run On Thumb Drive, 16 September 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.co.uk/blogs/zdnet-uk-first-take-10013312/windows-8-windows-to-go-10024384/&lt;/ref&gt;. WTG is not included in Windows 8 previews.

Windows 8 will support [[multiple monitors]] with the new ability to natively display different background images on each display and customized taskbar(s) on each of the connected displays.

The Developer Preview comes with two new recovery functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/home/br229518 Windows Dev Center]. Msdn.microsoft.com. Retrieved on 2011-10-14,&lt;/ref&gt; '''Refresh''' and '''Reset''', which both make a complete restore easier than a re-installation. The former keeps all the settings and files of the user intact and only reverses all changes to Windows files to its original state while removing all installed programs and apps. The latter deletes all files and effectively re-installs Windows, but without any additional user input such as agreeing to license agreements or selecting a hard disk required. After a reset completes, the user will be asked for the product key and will then proceed to account creation.&lt;ref&gt;Bright, Peter.

Ars Technica. Retrieved on 2011-10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

One big change is that user accounts do not have to be local-only (or from an [[Active Directory]] domain) anymore but can be linked up to one's Windows Live ID. This has the advantage that users will not lose their settings and files as they move from their home computer to their work laptop or to any other computer also using Windows 8.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.askvg.com/what-are-the-benefits-of-windows-live-id-integration-in-windows-8/ Tweaking with Vishal â Windows 8 Live ID Integration].

Other new features include a new Welcome screen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-secrets-welcome-screen-130065 |title=Windows 8 Secrets: Welcome Screen |publisher=SuperSite for Windows |first=Paul |last=Thurrott |date= |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; a new packaged application model called [[AppX]] that is based on [[Microsoft Silverlight|Silverlight]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-secrets-modern-reader-135788 |title=Windows 8 Secrets: Modern Reader |publisher=SuperSite for Windows |first=Paul |last=Thurrott |date=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Open Packaging Conventions]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/hh464929(v=VS.85).aspx App packages and deployment].

There is also a stripped down &quot;Immersive&quot; version of Internet Explorer, using the similar Metro-based user interface of the mobile version of [[Internet Explorer Mobile|Internet Explorer 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/article/windows8/windows-8-secrets-internet-explorer-immersive-135787 |title=Windows 8 Secrets: Internet Explorer Immersive |publisher=SuperSite for Windows |first=Paul |last=Thurrott |date=April 5, 2011 |accessdate=April 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Immersive Version of Internet Explorer 10 does not support ActiveX plugins, in order to be an [[HTML5]]-only browser. The Desktop version of IE10 does support ActiveX plugins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-14949869 |title=Microsoft drops Flash from IE on Windows 8 tablets |publisher=BBC |date= 2011-09-16 |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A new &quot;Hybrid Boot&quot; option that uses &quot;advanced hibernation functionality&quot; on shutdown to allow faster startup times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.neowin.net/news/windows-8-hybrid-boot-discovered |title=Windows 8 &quot;Hybrid Boot&quot; discovered}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/desktop-os/2011/09/09/windows-8-hybrid-mode-brings-faster-boot-40093896/&lt;/ref&gt;

A new version of [[Windows Task Manager|Task Manager]] with a redesigned user interface is also present in pre-release versions of Windows 8.

==Hardware requirements==
Microsoft say that the Windows Developer Preview (a pre-release version of Windows 8) works well on hardware suitable for Windows Vista or [[Windows 7#Hardware requirements|7]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/br229516 |title=ewindows Metro Style Apps Developer Downloads |publisher=Msdn.microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A multi-touch screen is required to use touch input. For Metro applications, a screen resolution of 1024x768 or higher is required.

Microsoft may also require new PCs to have the [[Unified Extensible Firmware Interface|UEFI]] secure boot feature enabled by default to be given Windows 8 certification. There has been some concern about this, that it could lead to machines that do not support alternative operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mjg59.dreamwidth.org/5552.html|title=Blog post of Red Hat developer|publisher=Matthew Garrett|date=2011-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturer is free to choose which [[Cryptographic signature|signatures]] are accepted by the feature and to offer the ability to turn off the secure boot feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2011/09/microsoft-attempt-address-windows-8-linux-worries/|title=Microsoft Attempt to Address Windows 8 âLinux Worriesâ|publisher[[OMG!

==Compatibility==

Windows 8 for [[x86]] processors will run much software compatible with previous [[x86]] versions of Windows, with the usual restrictions: 64-bit Windows will run also 32-bit software but not 16-bit ones; 32-bit Windows will optionally run 16-bit software if installed to do so, but will not run 64-bit software. Either 32- or 64-bit Windows can be installed on [[x86-64]] processors. Some expertise in manipulating compatibility settings may be required to run, for example, 16-bit software for Windows 3.x under 32-bit Windows 8, in cases where it is possible. In particular, applications compatible with 32- and 64-bit Windows 7 will run in the same way on Windows 8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashgear.com/windows-8-on-arm-wont-run-x86-apps-microsoft-admits-16180415/|title=Windows 8 on ARM wonât run x86 apps Microsoft admits|publisher=[[slashgear]] |date= |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8 for [[ARM architecture|ARM processors]] will not run software created for x86; software will have to be [[ported]] by its developers to create ARM executables from [[source code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://betanews.com/2011/09/19/will-windows-8-have-an-arm-app-gap/|title=Will Windows 8 have an ARM app gap?|publisher=betanews |date=September 19, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/15/sinofsky_windows8_arm_support_x86_apps/|title=Microsoft: No Windows 8 ARM support for x86 apps?|publisher=[[The Register]] |date= September 15, 2011|accessdate=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 8 Developer Preview is incompatible with some virtualization platforms, such as [[Virtual PC]]. A blog post by Microsoft notes that the setup process is error-prone when installing in a virtual machine, and installing without [[hardware virtualization]] support can be particularly problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/b/b8/archive/2011/09/16/running-windows-8-developer-preview-in-a-virtual-environment.aspx|title=Running Windows 8 Developer Preview in a virtual environment|publisher=Microsoft|date=2011-09-16|accessdate=2011-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported to work under [[VMware Workstation]] and [[VMware Player]] â detailed instructions for installing in these environments have been published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tseonet.blogspot.com/2011/09/installing-windows-8-developer-preview.html Installing Windows 8 Developer Preview in VMware]&lt;/ref&gt;
