==In depth analysis of week of 2004 election==
&lt;!-- [[Image:USPresidentialSeal transparent 100px.png||right|100px|The Seal of the President of the United States of America]]--&gt;
This page contains a timeline of the '''2004 U.S. presidential election'''. For a more in-depth discussion of the candidates and issues at stake in that election and the campaign history leading up to election day, see [[U.S. presidential election, 2004]]. For information on other races conducted the same day, see [[U.S. Senate election, 2004]] and [[U.S. House election, 2004]]. For an explanation of the U.S. presidential election process see [[U.S. Electoral College]].

The U.S. presidential election occurred on November 2, 2004. However, as in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. election]], the election was too close for a winner to be declared that night. By the next morning, the Republican campaign was declaring a victory while the results in several states remained too close for the media to declare winners. Soon afterward the Kerry campaign decided that there were not enough uncounted votes in Ohio for them to win that state and Kerry telephoned Bush to concede. At 2 p.m. EST, Kerry held a news conference announcing the same. An hour later, Bush held his own to accept his victory.

In Ohio, the Libertarian and Green parties raised $113,600 necessary to fund a recount of the popular vote, which took place in early December and upheld the Bush victory in that state.

==Events==
===Tuesday, November 2, 2004===
====Morning====
*Citizens in two small [[New Hampshire]] towns were the first to have their ballots counted in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. The polls were opened at midnight and closed within minutes as everyone who had registered had voted. In [[Dixville Notch, New Hampshire|Dixville Notch]], the more famous of the two due to its longstanding tradition of early voting, the incumbent lost ground compared to his showing in 2000, but got more total votes than the challenger: Bush â 19, Kerry â 7. Bush also won the vote in [[Hart's Location, New Hampshire|Hart's Location]], which managed to report its results slightly earlier this year; Bush â 16, Kerry â 14, and Nader â 1. (09:00 UTC, November 2, 2004, Associated Press ([http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/E/ELN_FIRST_VOTES?SITE=JRC&amp;SECTION=HOME&amp;TEMPLATE=DEFAULT Associated Press]) ([http://www.reuters.co.uk/newsPackageArticle.jhtml?type=worldNews&amp;storyID=613450&amp;section=news Reuters]) In both cases this represented a small swing compared with the 2000 results from the Republican candidate to the Democratic candidate.
*&quot;U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[John Paul Stevens]] Tuesday allowed Republicans to challenge voter qualifications at the polls in Ohio, a key battleground state that could determine the presidential election. Stevens acted on an emergency request shortly before polls opened in Ohio and across the nation.&quot; He refused to set aside a U.S. appeals court order, issued Monday, which, reversing a lower court's ban, permitted political party members to challenge the credentials of potential voters at polling places across the state. -[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=topNews&amp;storyID=6689186 Reuters] ([http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=10000087&amp;sid=a7QdNFNQp7NY&amp;refer=top_world_news Bloomberg])
*Some reports say Florida, Virginia, Maryland, and Washington, D.C., (and possibly other states) have received record numbers of requests for absentee ballots for this election. Absentee ballots are counted differently based on the state,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electionline.org/site/docs/html/counting_absentee_ballots.htm |title=Pew Center on the States |publisher=electionline.org |date= |accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with most states counting them on election day, but with some exceptions, the last deadline being 10 days after the election (all Washington, D.C. absentee ballots, and oversea absentee ballots in Ohio and Florida). Washington State allows 15 days after the election for out of country absentee ballots to come in. It is possible that absentee ballots are being requested due to concerns about electronic voting, or simply due to an expected high overall voter turnout.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbc-2.com/articles/readarticle.asp?articleid=1661&amp;z=3&amp;p= ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Staff |url=http://washingtontimes.com/metro/20041101-110119-6698r.htm |title=Absentee Voting Surges This Year | work = [[The Washington Times]] |date= November 1, 2004 |accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bush projected to win in Nevada, North Carolina and Colorado. Together with the polls from MyDD there are results from 34 states. Kerry leads with 192 electoral votes, while Bush has 152.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Shafer, Jack |url=http://washingtontimes.com/metro/20041101-110119-6698r.htm/ |title=Mucho Flattering to Kerry; Plus Nader Makes an Appearance. - By Jack Shafer - Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.msn.com |date= November 2, 2004 |accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Based on exit polls, Zogby predicts a decisive 311 to 213 win for Kerry with 14 electoral votes too close to call.
* As the day progresses, late-day exit polls show that Florida has flipped to Bush, but by a narrow margin, and Nevada to Kerry, giving the challenger a 289-249 edge.

====Evening====
*At 7:00 pm EST, polls close in GA, IN, KY, SC, VT, and VA. CNN, CBS, ABC, NBC, and Fox News Channel all agree in projecting Georgia, Indiana, and Kentucky for Bush, and Vermont for Kerry, giving the Republicans a 34-3 lead.
*At 7:30 pm, polls close in OH and WV. ABC, CBS, CNN, and Fox News call West Virginia for Bush. NBC waits 15 minutes before concurring. Bush leads 39-3.
*At 8:00 pm, polls are closed in AL, CT, DE, DC, FL, IL, KS, ME, MD, MA, MI, MS, MO, NJ, OK, PA, TN, and TX. CNN, CBS, Fox, and NBC project Alabama, Oklahoma, and Tennessee for President Bush; Connecticut, Delaware, Washington DC, Illinois, Massachusetts, Maryland, Maine (at-large vote and first congressional district), New Jersey, and Vermont for Senator Kerry: current electoral vote is 77-66, Kerry ahead. ABC does not call Maine until a half-hour later and has Kerry ahead 74-66.
*NBC calls North Carolina for Bush, 81-77 for Bush
*CNN (and ABC, and possibly others) projects South Carolina (8), Virginia (13), Kansas (6), Nebraska (4), North Dakota (3), South Dakota (3), Texas (34) and Wyoming (3) for President Bush, and New York (31) and Rhode Island (4) for Senator Kerry. Projected count 155-112 for Bush. According to these numbers, both candidates have won the same states that their parties won in the 2000 election, but redistribution of districts means that the Democrats have lost 5 electoral votes and the Republicans have won 2 with respect to those elections.
*CNN and ABC project Louisiana (9) and Mississippi (6) for the president, leaving the count at 170-112 for the incumbent.
*FoxNewsChannel has Bush at 193-112 with Missouri (11), Arkansas (5) and Utah (5) now in the Bush column.

*ABC calls Arizona (10) for Bush. 210-188.
*CNN won't call Florida but says Kerry camp is all but conceding there.
*ABC has Bush 237-Kerry 188

*On CNN, Bush re-election committee chair [[Marc Racicot]] says we'll have a result tonight, seemed quietly confident of victory in Ohio and generally. Kerry camp still optimistic about Ohio.
*Kerry camp less optimistic now, according to FoxNews.
*ABC says Bush 237 Kerry 195; Fox says Bush 246 Kerry 206
*BBC, CNN, ABC and FoxNews call Colorado for Bush.

*BBC, ABC, CBS, CNN call Nevada for Bush. FOX News and MSNBC, who both earlier called Ohio for Bush, do not call Nevada for Bushâyet as of 4:07 a.m. EST. (Calling both for Bush would be equivalent to calling the presidency for Bush.)
*NBC calls Minnesota for Kerry.
*[[Tom Brokaw]] of NBC News refuses to call Nevada for Bush as long as outstanding absentee ballots (rumored to be as many as 60,000) have not been counted. Another reason for refusal is the contention by the Kerry camp that Ohio should not be called for Bush.
*BBC, CNN call Wisconsin for Kerry.
*On a special edition of ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', Tom Brokaw announces that NBC News will not call any more states for either candidate as long as the Kerry camp contests the Bush win in Ohio. This puts the NBC News electoral vote count at 269 for Bush and 238 for Kerry.

*Voting machines controversy in PA. Before polls even opened in Philadelphia, 2,000 votes had already been cast on voting machines. [http://www.drudgereport.com/vote1.htm Drudge Report].

Bush, 251 for Democratic Senator John Kerry, and 1 for Democratic Senator John Edwards, leading to Bush's reelection, despite a formal challenge to Ohio's electoral votes, the first challenge since 1877, resulting in a vote â 1-74 (Yea-Nay) in the Senate and 31-267 in the House.

==Election incidents==
As of November 10, there were 31,515 reported incidents of voting problems nationally, with approx. 350 new incidents being reported a day. One-third of the problems (12,074) involved voter registration, followed by &quot;polling place inquiries&quot; (7,073), absentee ballot-related problems (3,218) and machine problems (1,599). The latter included complaints that some machines registered votes for George W. Bush when the voter selected John Kerry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://voteprotect.org/index.php?display=EIRMapCounty&amp;tab=ALL&amp;state=Ohio&amp;county=Mahoning&amp;cat=02&amp;start_time=&amp;start_date=&amp;end_time=&amp;end_date=&amp;search=&amp;go=Apply+filter |title=VerifiedVoting.org : Index |publisher=Voteprotect.org |date= |accessdate= February 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some allege that voting locations that used electronic voting machines that did not issue a paper receipt or offer auditability correlate geographically with areas that had unilateral discrepancies between exit poll numbers and actual results. Exit polling data in these areas show significantly higher support for Kerry than actual results (outside the margin of error). Some are concerned that, from a statistical perspective, this may be indicative of [[vote rigging]], because the likelihood of this happening by chance is less than 1 in 50,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=405  |title=The Blue Lemur - Progressive Politics and Media News Â» Odds of Bush gaining by 4 percent in all exit polling states 1 in 50,000; Evoting/paper variance not found to be significant |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate= May 24, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050903013112/http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=405 |archivedate = September 3, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others point out this could be explained by poor exit polling techniques or all discrepancies may be within the margin of error.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/TECH/biztech/11/04/e.votingtested.ap/index.html ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scoop.co.nz/mason/stories/HL0411/S00072.htm |title=Faun Otter: Vote Fraud - Exit Polls Vs Actuals |publisher=Scoop |date= November 4, 2004 |accessdate= May 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=388  |title=The Blue Lemur - Progressive Politics and Media News Â» Exit polls and 'actual' results don't match; Evoting states show greater discrepancy |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate= May 24, 2010 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20050823032944/http://www.bluelemur.com/index.php?p=388 |archivedate = August 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opednews.com/thoreau_110404_diebold.htm |title=Never Say Die-bold: So You Don't Think the Bush Campaign Stole This Election?

===Colorado constitutional amendment===
&lt;div id=&quot;Colorado&quot;&gt;* â Colorado had a constitutional amendment, [[Colorado Amendment 36|Amendment 36]], on the ballot this year which could have changed the process by which its electoral votes were distributed. The vote failed, so Colorado awarded all 9 of its electoral votes to Bush, the winner of the vote in that state. Results of the vote follow:

|-
| colspan=&quot;3&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; background:silver;&quot;| '''Colorado Amendment 36'''&lt;/font&gt;
|-
| |'''Position''' || '''Votes''' || '''Vote %'''
|-
| |Yes (proportional split) || 355,712 || 34.10%
|-
| |No (remains winner-take-all) || 686,431 || 65.90%
|}&lt;/div&gt;

===Maine and Nebraska splits===
&lt;div id=&quot;Split&quot;&gt;** â Maine and Nebraska are unlike the other 48 states and the District of Columbia in that they allocate their electoral votes in the following manner: 1 for the winner of each Congressional district, 2 for the state winner. However, neither state split the vote, so each of these states effectively went winner-take-all.&lt;/div&gt;

===Pre-election odds===
* On [http://www.tradesports.com/ Tradesports], the Bush [[futures contract]] dropped from about 53, where it had been for several days before election, to about 30, in about an hour, but then rallied to 65-66 by 15:30 UTC. On [[Betfair]] the odds on a Bush victory increased from 1.75 at the beginning of the day, to 5.0 at 13:00 UTC, and moved down to 1.33 at 15:20 UTC.
* [http://www.oddschecker.com/specials/politics-and-election Oddschecker] gave real time odds and accurate reflection of probabilities from various UK bookmakers.

* The [http://128.255.244.60/graphs/graph_Pres04_WTA.cfm Iowa Futures Market] briefly showed Bush losing ground, with Kerry picking up.

* The price of [[crude oil|light crude oil]] dropped the day before election by nearly $1.63 (3.2%), amid speculation that a win for Kerry would result in the abolition of President Bush's maximum-capacity [[Strategic Petroleum Reserve]] policy. Oil prices continued to fall after the election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/newsArticle.jhtml?type=businessNews&amp;storyID=6692242 ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/ap/20041104/ap_on_bi_ge/oil_prices_80 ]{{dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
