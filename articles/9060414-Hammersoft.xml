'''WLOF''' is a [[Catholic]] radio station broadcasting from [[Attica, New York]]. WLOF is located at 101.7 on the FM dial and covers much of Western New York, including Buffalo and Niagara Falls.  Referred to as ''[[The Station of the Cross]]'', WLOF is owned and operated by [[Holy Family Communications]] which also owns and operates [[WHIC]] in Rochester, New York. The call letters represent [[Our Lady of Fatima]], to whom this station is dedicated. Both stations rely on the [http://www.ewtn.com/radio/ EWTN Global Catholic Radio Network] for the bulk of their programming.

==History==
101.7 [[Megahertz|MHz]] in [[Attica, New York]] began its broadcasting life as WBTF &quot;BT Country&quot;.  It was the sister station to [[WBTA]] in [[Batavia, New York]].

Beginning on February 13, 1998, 101.7 FM was acquired by Broben Communications, Inc. and used ''WXOX'' as its [[callsign]]. WXOX then forced nearby station [[WHUG]] in Jamestown to change frequencies in an effort to gain coverage area. While WXOX, 101.7 broadcast modern-rock as &quot;The Spot,&quot; supposedly covering &quot;Attica, Amherst and Buffalo&quot; and acting as a challenger to [[WEDG]].  It made a significant advertising blitz in the Buffalo market and even created its own &quot;Spotfest&quot; music festival, but it never even registered a measurable audience in the ratings books, let alone make a serious challenge at any Buffalo station, because of its very weak signal (it had 1/15th of the signal strength of another Wyoming County station, [[WLKK|WNUC]], which was an average station at its best).&lt;ref&gt;Fybush, Scott.

On August 15, 1999 [[Holy Family Communications]] acquired WXOX and began broadcasting Catholic programming as WLOF becoming the sixth Catholic Radio station in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://svartifoss2.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/call_hist.pl?Facility_id=31812&amp;Callsign=WLOF Call Sign History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
