==Early Brooklyn baseball==
[[Image:Champions_of_america.jpg|thumb|250px|left|The 1865 Atlantics were one of the first dynasties in organized baseball]]
[[Brooklyn]] was home to numerous [[baseball]] clubs in the mid-1850s. Eight of 16 participants in the [[National Association of Base Ball Players|first convention]] were from Brooklyn, including the [[Brooklyn Atlantics|Atlantic]], [[Brooklyn Eckfords|Eckford]], and [[Brooklyn Excelsiors|Excelsior]] clubs that combined to dominate play for most of the 1860s. Brooklyn helped make baseball commercial, as the locale of the first paid admission games, a series of three all star contests matching New York and Brooklyn in 1858. Brooklyn also featured the first two enclosed baseball grounds, the [[Union Grounds]] and the [[Capitoline Grounds]]; enclosed, dedicated ballparks accelerated the evolution from [[amateur]]ism to [[professional]]ism.

Despite the success of Brooklyn clubs in the first Association, officially amateur until 1869, they fielded weak teams in the succeeding [[National Association of Professional Base Ball Players]], the first professional league formed in 1871. The Excelsiors no longer challenged for the amateur championship after the Civil War and never entered the professional NA. The Eckfords and Atlantics declined to join until 1872 and thereby lost their best players; Eckford survived only one season and Atlantic four, with losing teams.

The [[National League]] replaced the NA in 1876 and granted exclusive territories to its eight members, excluding the Atlantics in favor of the [[New York Mutuals]], who had shared the same home grounds. When the Mutuals were expelled by the league, the [[Hartford Dark Blues]] club moved in, changed its name to '''The Brooklyn Hartfords'''&lt;ref name = &quot;Hartford Dark Blues&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = 1877 Hartford Dark Blues â Statistics and Roster | url =  http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/HAR/1877.shtml | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and played its home games at Union Grounds in 1877 before disbanding.

===The origin of the Dodgers===
The team currently known as the Dodgers was formed (as the &quot;Brooklyn Grays&quot;) in 1883 by real estate magnate and baseball enthusiast [[Charlie Byrne (baseball)|Charles Byrne]], who convinced his brother-in-law [[Joseph Doyle (baseball)|Joseph Doyle]] and casino operator [[Ferdinand Abell]] to start the team with him.  Byrne set up a grandstand on Fifth Avenue and named it [[Washington Park (baseball)|Washington Park]] in honor of [[George Washington]]. The team played in the minor [[International League|Inter-State Association of Professional Baseball Clubs]] that first season. Doyle became the first manager of the team, which drew 6,000 fans to its first home game on May 12, 1883 against the [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] team. The team won the league title after the Camden Merritt club disbanded on July 20 and Brooklyn picked up some of its better players. The Grays were invited to join the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] for the following season. &lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=o3V21Ug-9t0C&amp;pg=PA12&amp;lpg=PA12&amp;dq=interstate+association+1883+brooklyn&amp;source=web&amp;ots=lnxrWQurDQ&amp;sig=rfQGzn7xGNH_YwmrRXbx2rzscPY#PPA12,M1]&lt;/ref&gt;

After winning the AA championship in 1889, the team moved to the [[National League]] and won the 1890 NL Championship, the first Major League team to win consecutive championships in two different leagues. Their success during this period was partly attributed to their absorbing the players of the defunct [[New York Metropolitans]] and [[Brooklyn Ward's Wonders]]. In 1899, the Dodgers merged with the [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Baltimore Orioles]], as Baltimore manager [[Ned Hanlon (baseball)|Ned Hanlon]] became the club's new skipper and [[Charles Ebbets]] became the primary owner of the team.

===The team's nickname===
[[Image: LA 1133.png|thumb|225px|right|Logo of the Brooklyn Dodgers/Superbas from 1910 through 1913]]
By 1890, New Yorkers (Brooklyn was a separate city until it became a borough in 1898) routinely called anyone from Brooklyn a &quot;trolley dodger&quot;, due to the vast network of street car lines criss-crossing the borough as people dodged trains to cross the streets. When the second Washington Park burned down early in the 1891 season, the team moved to nearby Eastern Park, which was bordered on two sides by street car tracks.  That's when the team was first called the '''Brooklyn Trolley Dodgers'''. That was soon shortened to '''Brooklyn Dodgers'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1890's&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dodgers Timeline | url = http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/history/timeline01.jsp | publisher = Los Angeles Dodgers | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly because of the &quot;street character&quot; nature of Jack Dawkins, the &quot;[[Artful Dodger]]&quot; in [[Charles Dickens]]' ''[[Oliver Twist]]'', sportswriters in the early 20th Century began referring to the Dodgers as the &quot;Bums&quot;.

Other team names used by the franchise which would finally be called the Dodgers were the Grays, the Grooms, the Bridegrooms, the Superbas and the Robins.  All of these nicknames were used by fans and sportswriters to describe the team, but not in any official capacity.  The team's legal name was the Brooklyn Base Ball Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Brooklyn Ball Parks | url = http://www.covehurst.net/ddyte/brooklyn/dodgers.html | publisher = BrooklynBallParks.com | accessdate = 2008-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the Trolley Dodger nickname was used throughout this period, along with these other nicknames, by fans and sportswriters of the day.  The team did not use the name in any formal sense until 1932, when the word &quot;Dodgers&quot; appeared on jerseys for the team.&lt;ref name=&quot;National Baseball Hall of Fame&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dressed to the Nines uniform database | url = http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?league=NL&amp;city=Brooklyn&amp;lowYear=1930&amp;highYear=1940&amp;sort=year&amp;increment=9 | publisher = National Baseball Hall of Fame | accessdate = 2008-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;conclusive shift&quot; came in 1933, when both home and road jerseys for the team bore the name &quot;Dodgers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LeonardBernardo&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Leonard|last=Bernado|first2=Jennifer|last2=Weiss|year=2006|title=Brooklyn By Name:  From Bedford-Stuyvesant to Flatbush Avenue, And From Ebbets Field To Williamsburg|location=New York|publisher=New York University Press|page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of how the many popularized names of the team were used interchangeably are available from newspaper articles from the period before 1932.  A New York Times article describing a game the Dodgers played in 1916 starts out by referring to how &quot;Jimmy Callahan, pilot of the Pirates, did his best to wreck the hopes the Dodgers have of gaining the National League pennant&quot;, but then goes on to comment &quot;the only thing that saved the Superbas from being toppled from first place was that the Phillies lost one of the two games played&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Buccaneers Rout Sleepy Superbas | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E04EFDA1F31E733A05757C1A96F9C946796D6CF | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | format=PDF | date=1916-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  What is interesting about the use of these two nicknames is that most baseball statistics sites and baseball historians generally now refer to the pennant-winning 1916 Brooklyn team as the Robins.  A 1918 New York Times article does use the nickname Robins in its title &quot;Buccaneers Take Last From Robins&quot;, but the subtitle of the article reads &quot;Subdue The Superbas By 11 To 4, Making Series An Even Break&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Buccaneers Take Last From Robins | url = http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9C00E3DA103BEE3ABC4152DFB3668383609EDE | publisher = New York Times | accessdate = 2008-10-08 | format=PDF | date=1918-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example of the interchangeability of the different nicknames is found on the program issued at Ebbets Field for the [[1920 World Series]], which identifies the matchup in the series as &quot;Dodgers vs. Indians&quot;, despite the fact that the Robins nickname had been in consistent usage at this point for around six years.&lt;ref&gt;http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:1920_World_Series_program.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalry with the Giants==
{{Main|DodgersâGiants rivalry}}
The historic and heated rivalry between the Dodgers and the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] is more than a century old. It began when both clubs played in New York City (the Dodgers in [[Brooklyn]] and the Giants in [[Manhattan]]). When both franchises moved to [[California]] after the 1957 season, the rivalry was easily transplanted, as the cities of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] have long been rivals in economics, culture, and politics.

===&quot;Uncle Robbieâ and the &quot;Daffiness Boys&quot;===
Manager [[Wilbert Robinson]], another former [[Baltimore Orioles (19th century)|Oriole]], popularly known as âUncle Robbie&quot;, restored the Brooklyn team to respectability. His &quot;Brooklyn Robins&quot; reached the [[1916 World Series|1916]] and [[1920 World Series]], losing both, but contending perennially for several seasons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1910's&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dodgers Timeline | url = http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/history/timeline03.jsp | publisher = Los Angeles Dodgers | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Ebbets and Ed McKeever died within a week of each other in 1925, and Robbie was named president while still field manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1920's&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dodgers Timeline | url = http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/history/timeline04.jsp | publisher = Los Angeles Dodgers | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon assuming the title of president, however, Robinsonâs ability to focus on the field declined, and the teams of the late 1920s were often fondly referred to as the &quot;Daffiness Boys&quot; for their distracted, error-ridden style of play.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Dodgers Timeline | url = http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/la/history/timeline05.jsp | publisher = Los Angeles Dodgers | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outfielder [[Babe Herman]] was the leader both in hitting and in zaniness. The signature Dodger play from this era occurred when Herman doubled into a [[double play]], in which three players â [[Dazzy Vance]], [[Chick Fewster]], and Herman â all ended up at third base at the same time. After his removal as club president, Robinson returned to managing, and the clubâs performance rebounded somewhat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt;

When Robinson retired in 1931, he was replaced as manager by [[Max Carey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; Although some suggested renaming the &quot;Robins&quot; the &quot;Brooklyn Canaries&quot;, after Carey (whose last name was originally &quot;Carnarius&quot;), the name &quot;Brooklyn Dodgers&quot; returned to stay following Robinson's retirement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; It was during this era that [[Willard Mullin]], a noted sports [[cartoonist]], fixed the Brooklyn team with the lovable nickname of '''&quot;Dem Bums&quot;'''. After hearing his cab driver ask, &quot;So how did those bums do today?&quot;, Mullin decided to sketch an exaggerated version of famed circus clown [[Emmett Kelly]] to represent the Dodgers in his much-praised cartoons in the ''[[New York World-Telegram]]''. Both image and nickname caught on, so much so many a Dodger yearbook cover, from 1951 through 1957, featured a Willard Mullin illustration of the Brooklyn Bum.

Perhaps the highlight of the Daffiness Boys era came after Wilbert Robinson left the dugout.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; In [[1934 in baseball|1934]], Giants player/manager [[Bill Terry]] was asked about the Dodgersâ chances in the coming pennant race and cracked infamously, &quot;Is Brooklyn still in the league?&quot; Managed now by [[Casey Stengel]] (who played for the Dodgers in the 1910s and would go on to greatness managing the [[New York Yankees]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; the [[1934 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1934]] Dodgers were determined to make their presence felt. As it happened, the season entered its final games with the [[1934 New York Giants season|Giants]] tied with the [[1934 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis Cardinals]] for the pennant, with the Giantsâ remaining games against the Dodgers. Stengel led his Bums to the [[Polo Grounds]] for the showdown, and they beat the Giants twice to knock them out of the pennant race.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; The &quot;[[Gashouse Gang]]&quot; Cardinals nailed the pennant by beating the [[Cincinnati Reds]] those same two days.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt;

One key development during this era was the 1938 appointment of [[Larry MacPhail|Leland &quot;Larry&quot; MacPhail]] as Dodgers' general manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; MacPhail, who brought night baseball to MLB as general manager of the Reds, also introduced Brooklyn to night baseball and ordered the successful refurbishing of Ebbets Field.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dodgers Timeline - 1930's&quot;/&gt; He also brought Reds voice [[Red Barber]] to Brooklyn as the Dodgers' lead announcer in 1939, just after MacPhail broke the New York baseball executives' agreement to ban live baseball broadcasts, enacted because of the fear of what effect the radio calls would have on the home teams' attendance.

MacPhail remained with the Dodgers until 1942, when he returned to the Armed Forces for [[World War II]]. (He later became one of the Yankees' co-owners, bidding unsuccessfully for Barber to join him in the Bronx as announcer.) MacPhail's son [[Lee MacPhail|Leland Jr.]] and grandson [[Andy MacPhail|Andy]] also became MLB executives.

The first major-league baseball game to be [[Television|televised]] was [[1939 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Brooklyn]]'s 6â1 victory over [[1939 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati]] at Ebbets Field on August 26, 1939. [[Batting helmet]]s were introduced to Major League Baseball by the Dodgers in 1941.

==Breaking the color barrier==
[[Image:Jrobinson.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jackie Robinson]].]]
For most of the first half of the 20th century, no Major League Baseball team employed a black player. A parallel system of [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]] developed, but most of the Negro League players were denied a chance to prove their skill before a national audience. [[Jackie Robinson]] became the first African-American to play Major League baseball in the 20th Century when he played his first major league game on April 15, 1947 as a member of the Dodgers. Robinson's entry into the league was mainly due to General Manager [[Branch Rickey]]'s efforts. The deeply religious Rickey's motivation appears to have been primarily moral, although business considerations were also present. Rickey was a member of [[The Methodist Church (USA)|The Methodist Church]], the antecedent denomination to [[The United Methodist Church]] of today, which was a strong advocate for [[social justice]] and active later in the [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|Civil Rights movement]].&lt;ref name=&quot;[[The New York Times]] - Branch Rickey&quot;&gt; {{cite news | title=Branch Rickey, 83, Dies in Missouri |url=http://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1220.html|publisher=|accessdate=2008-12-29 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides selecting Robinson for his exceptional baseball skills, Rickey also considered Robinson's outstanding personal character in his decision, since he knew that [[booing|boos]], taunts, and criticism would be directed at Robinson and that Robinson would have to be tough enough to withstand this abuse without attempting to retaliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Superstars and Screwballs: 100 Years of Brooklyn Baseball|first=Richard|last=Goldstein|authorlink=Richard Goldstein (writer born 1942)|location=New York|publisher=Dutton|year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inclusion of Robinson on the team also led the Dodgers to move its [[spring training]] site. Prior to 1946, the Dodgers held their spring training in [[Jacksonville, Florida]].  However, the city's stadium refused to host an exhibition game with the [[Montreal Royals]] â the Dodgersâ own farm club â on whose roster Robinson appeared at the time, citing segregation laws. Nearby [[Sanford, Florida|Sanford]] similarly declined. Ultimately, City Island Ballpark in [[Daytona Beach, Florida|Daytona Beach]] agreed to host the game with Robinson on the field. The team would return to Daytona Beach for spring training in 1947, this time with Robinson on the big club. Although the Dodgers ultimately built Dodgertown and its [[Holman Stadium (Vero Beach)|Holman Stadium]] further south in [[Vero Beach, Florida|Vero Beach]], and played there for 61 spring training seasons from 1948 through 2008, Daytona Beach would rename City Island Ballpark to [[Jackie Robinson Ballpark]] in his honor.

This event was the continuation of the integration of professional sports in the United States, with professional football having led the way in 1946, with the concomitant demise of the [[Negro league baseball|Negro Leagues]], and is regarded as a key moment in the history of the American civil rights movement. Robinson was an exceptional player, a speedy [[stolen base|runner]] who sparked the team with his intensity. He was the inaugural recipient of the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year Award|Rookie of the Year]] award, which is now named the Jackie Robinson award in his honor. The Dodgers' willingness to integrate, when most other teams refused to, was a key factor in their 1947â1956 success. They won six pennants in those 10 years with the help of Robinson, three-time MVP [[Roy Campanella]], Cy Young Award winner [[Don Newcombe]], [[Jim Gilliam]], and [[Joe Black]]. Robinson would eventually go on to become the first African-American elected to the [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] in 1962.

==&quot;Wait âtil next year!&quot;==
After the wilderness years of the 1920s and 1930s, the Dodgers were rebuilt into a contending club first by general manager [[Larry MacPhail]] and then the legendary [[Branch Rickey]]. Led by [[Pee Wee Reese]], [[Jackie Robinson]] and [[Gil Hodges]] in the infield, [[Duke Snider]] in center field, [[Carl Furillo]] in right field, [[Roy Campanella]] behind the plate, and [[Don Newcombe]] on the pitcher's mound, the Dodgers won pennants in {{wsy|1941}}, {{wsy|1947}}, {{wsy|1949}}, {{wsy|1952}}, and {{wsy|1953}}, only to fall to the [[New York Yankees]] in all five of the subsequent World Series.
The annual ritual of building excitement, followed in the end by disappointment, became a common pattern to the long suffering fans, and '''&quot;Wait âtil next year!&quot;''' became an unofficial Dodger slogan.

While the Dodgers generally enjoyed success during this period, in {{by|1951}} they fell victim to one of the largest collapses in the history of baseball.&lt;ref name =&quot;Lies, Damned Lies&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Silver | first = Nate | publisher = Baseball Prospectus | title = Lies, Damned Lies | url = http://www.baseballprospectus.com/article.php?articleid=6764 | date = 2007-09-27 | accessdate = 2008-09-22 | authorlink = Nate Silver}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 11, [[1951 Brooklyn Dodgers season|1951]], Brooklyn led the National League by an enormous 13Â½ games over their archrivals, the [[1951 New York Giants (MLB) season|Giants]]. While the Dodgers went 26â22 from that time until the end of the season, the Giants went on an absolute tear, winning an amazing 37 of their last 44 games, including their last seven in a row. At the end of the season the Dodgers and the Giants were tied for first place, forcing a three-game playoff for the pennant. The Giants took Game 1 by a score of 3â1 before being shut out by the Dodgers' [[Clem Labine]] in Game 2, 10â0. It all came down to the final game, and Brooklyn seemed to have the pennant locked up, holding a 4â2 lead in the bottom of the ninth inning. Giants outfielder, [[Bobby Thomson]], however, hit a stunning three-run [[walk-off home run]] off the Dodgers' [[Ralph Branca]] to secure the NL Championship for New York. To this day Thomson's home run is known as the [[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round The World]].

In 1955 by which time the core of the Dodger team was beginning to age &quot;next year&quot; finally came. The fabled &quot;Boys of Summer&quot; shot down the &quot;Bronx Bombers&quot; in seven games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/51141/1955-world-series-rare-never-seen|title= 1955 World Series: Rare, Never-Seen|publisher= LIFE.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;, led by the first-class pitching of young left-hander [[Johnny Podres]], whose key pitch was a [[changeup]] known as &quot;pulling down the lampshade&quot; because of the arm motion used right when the ball was released.&lt;ref name = &quot;MLBTickets&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Los Angeles Dodgers Baseball | url = http://www.mlb-tickets.net/los-angeles-dodgers.html | year = 2006 | accessdate = 2008-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podres won two Series games, including the deciding seventh. The turning point of Game 7 was a spectacular double play that began with left fielder [[Sandy Amoros]] running down [[Yogi Berra]]âs long fly ball, then throwing to [[shortstop]] [[Pee Wee Reese]], who doubled up a surprised [[Gil McDougald]] at first base to preserve the Dodger lead. The Dodgers won 2â0.

Although the [[1956 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] lost the World Series to the [[1956 New York Yankees season|Yankees]] in {{wsy|1956}} (during which the Yankees pitcher [[Don Larsen]] pitched the only postseason [[perfect game]] in baseball history, and the only post-season no-hitter for the next 54 years), it hardly seemed to matter. Brooklyn fans had their memory of triumph, and soon that would be all they were left with â a victory that decades later would be remembered in the [[Billy Joel]] single &quot;[[We Didn't Start the Fire]]&quot;, which included the line, &quot;Brooklyn's got a winning team.&quot;

==Move to California==
Real estate businessman [[Walter O'Malley]] had acquired majority ownership of the Dodgers in 1950, when he bought the shares of his co-owners, Branch Rickey and the estate of the late John L. Smith. Before long he was working to buy new land in Brooklyn to build a more accessible and better arrayed ballpark than [[Ebbets Field]]. Beloved as it was, Ebbets Field had grown old and was not well served by infrastructure, to the point where the Dodgers could not sell the park out even in the heat of a pennant race (despite largely dominating the league from [[1946 in baseball|1946]] to [[1957 in baseball|1957]]).

New York City Construction Coordinator [[Robert Moses]], however, sought to force O'Malley into using a site in [[Flushing Meadows Park|Flushing Meadows]], [[Queens]] â the site for what eventually became [[Shea Stadium]]. Moses's vision involved a city-built, city-owned park, which was greatly at odds with O'Malley's real-estate savvy. When it became clear to O'Malley that he was not going to be allowed to buy any suitable land in Brooklyn, he began thinking elsewhere.

Walter O'Malley was free to purchase land of his own choosing but needed Robert Moses to condemn land along the Atlantic Railroad Yards (O'Malley's preferred choice) in downtown Brooklyn under Title I authority. Title I gave the city municipality power to condemn land for the purpose of building what it calls &quot;public purpose&quot; projects. Moses's interpretation of &quot;public purpose&quot; was to build public parks, public housing and public highways/bridges. What O'Malley wanted was for Moses to use this authority rather than pay market value for the land. With Title I, the city, aka Robert Moses, could have sold the land to O'Malley at a below market price. Robert Moses refused to honor O'Malley's request and responded by saying, &quot;If you want the land so bad, why don't you purchase it with your own money?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Dodgers Move West|first=Neil J.|last=Sullivan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, non-stop transcontinental air travel had become routine during the years since the [[Second World War]], and teams were no longer bound by much slower railroad timetables. Because of these transportation advances, it became possible to locate teams further apart â as far west as California â while maintaining the same game schedules.

When Los Angeles officials attended the [[1956 World Series]] looking to entice a team to move to the [[Los Angeles|City of Angels]], they were not even thinking of the Dodgers. Their original target had been the Washington Senators (who would in fact move to [[Bloomington, Minnesota]] to become the [[Minnesota Twins]] in [[1961 in baseball|1961]]). At the same time, O'Malley was looking for a contingency in case Moses and other New York politicians refused to let him build the Brooklyn stadium he wanted, and sent word to the Los Angeles officials that he was interested in talking. Los Angeles offered him what New York would not: a chance to buy land suitable for building a ballpark, and own that ballpark, giving him complete control over all its revenue streams.

Meanwhile, Giants owner [[Horace Stoneham]] was having similar difficulty finding a replacement for his team's antiquated home stadium, the [[Polo Grounds]]. Stoneham was considering moving the Giants to Minneapolis, but was persuaded instead to move them to San Francisco, ensuring that the Dodgers would have a National League rival closer than St. Louis. So the two arch-rival teams, the Dodgers and Giants, moved out to the West Coast together after the 1957 season.

The Brooklyn Dodgers played their final game at Ebbets Field on September 24, [[1957 in baseball|1957]], which the [[1957 Brooklyn Dodgers season|Dodgers]] won 2â0 over the [[1957 Pittsburgh Pirates season|Pittsburgh Pirates]].

On April 18, [[1958 in baseball|1958]], the Los Angeles Dodgers played their first game in LA, defeating the former New York and now new [[1958 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]], 6â5, before 78,672 fans at the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/LAN/LAN195804180.shtml|title= Giants 5 Dodgers 6 (Boxscore)|date=|work=Baseball Reference|accessdate=2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sadly, catcher [[Roy Campanella]], left partially paralyzed in an off-season accident, was never able to play for Los Angeles.

A [[2007 in film|2007]] [[HBO]] film, ''[[Brooklyn Dodgers: The Ghosts of Flatbush]]'', is a documentary covering the Dodgers history from early days to the beginning of the Los Angeles era. In the film the story is related that O'Malley was so hated by Brooklyn Dodger fans, after the move to California, that it was said, &quot;If you asked a Brooklyn Dodger fan, if you had a gun with only two bullets in it and were in a room with Hitler, Stalin and O'Malley, who would you shoot? The answer: O'Malley, twice!&quot;
