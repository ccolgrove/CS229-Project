&quot;'''Hymn 2000'''&quot; is a song by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. It is the fourth and closing track of side one on his first album, ''[[Empty Sky]]''.

==Musical structure==
The song was something of an oddity on the &quot;Empty Sky&quot; album. This song doesn't feature drums, instead only having tambourine provide the rhythm. This song, along with &quot;[[Skyline Pigeon]]&quot;, reflected Elton John's early philosophy of &quot;If in doubt, write a hymn!&quot;

==Lyrical meaning==
One of John/Taupin's biggest inspirations was [[Bob Dylan]]. It is clear that he has been the biggest influence on this particular tune, since the vocal is sung in a style that easily could remind of his earlier folk-days. The lyric seems to be inspired by his later years, with nonsencial settings, such as the opening line: &quot;''She chose the soft centre and took it to bed with her mother''&quot;. Similar settings run throughout the song. The chorus then goes:

&quot;''And I don't want to be &lt;br&gt;
''The son of any freak &lt;br&gt;
''Who for a chocolate centre &lt;br&gt;
''Can take you off the street 

''For soon they'll plough the desert &lt;br&gt;
''And God knows where I'll be &lt;br&gt;
''Collecting submarine numbers &lt;br&gt;
''On the main street of the sea''&quot;

It has never been performed live in any form.

In a 2008 interview with [[Elvis Costello]] John revealed that he tried to sound like [[Leonard Cohen]] in the singing style. This is one of the few times John mentions and quotes an album track from this particular album.
