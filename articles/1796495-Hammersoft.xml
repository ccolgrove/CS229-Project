The '''Old Brass Spittoon''' is the name of the [[trophy]] that is annually awarded to the winner of the  [[Big Ten Conference]] [[college football]] game between [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] and [[Michigan State University]]. First presented in [[1950 in sports|1950]], it was Michigan State's idea to start up the trophy and Indiana quickly accepted. It's believed that the spittoon has been around since both universities were established.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Michigan State won the 1994 contest, 27-21, but later forfeited the win due to NCAA violations.

The series is now a permanent part of the schedule for the teams as Michigan State and Indiana are cross-division rivals.  Prior to the expansion of the Big Ten in 2011, there were stoppages in the series because the schools were not protected rivals in the rotating conference schedule (note no game in 1999 and 2000, and again in 2009 and 2010).
