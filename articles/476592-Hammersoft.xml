== History ==
[[File:Pulliamclocktower.jpg|thumb|The Pulliam Hall clock tower. The Pulliam Hall clock tower has a functioning carillon and has been incorporated into the Southern Illinois University Carbondale logo.]]
An Act of the Twenty-sixth General Assembly of Illinois, approved March 9, 1869, created Southern Illinois Normal University, the second state-supported [[normal school]] in Illinois.  Carbondale held the ceremony of cornerstone laying, May 17, 1870.&lt;ref&gt;Lentz, Eli G. (1955). Seventy-Five Years in Retrospect. Carbondale, IL.: Southern Illinois University. pp. 11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869, SIU was founded as a teacher's college named '''Southern Illinois Normal College'''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert P. Howard, ''Illinois: A History of the Prairie State'' (Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972), 341.&lt;/ref&gt;  It began with twelve academic departments and an initial class of 143.

After World War II, there was more of a push towards higher education.  Southern Illinois University Carbondale grew rapidly in size from 3,500 to over 23,000 students between 1950 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History3.htm/&lt;/ref&gt;

The university continued as a teacher's college until Delyte W. Morris took office as president of the university in 1948. Morris was SIU's longest serving president (1948â1970).&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Egyptian'', [http://www.dailyegyptian.com/fall98/delytemorris/ &quot;Delyte Morris&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; During his presidency, Morris transformed SIU, adding Colleges of Law, Medicine, and Dentistry.

In 1957, a second campus of SIU was established at Edwardsville.  This school, now known as [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]], is now an independent university within the SIU system.

In 2005, then-SIU chancellor Walter Wendler unveiled a comprehensive plan called Saluki Way, which will reshape the Carbondale campus over a 15-year period.  Since the unveiling, much progress has been made in completing the Saluki Way project.  This includes a new Football Stadium, a renovated SIU Arena, and many cosmetic changes for the campus.  Also part of Saluki Way, The groundbreaking for a New Student Services building is set for early 2012.

== Leadership ==
On November 18, 2005, the SIU Board of Trustees unanimously selected former congressman and three-degree SIU alumnus [[Glenn Poshard]] to serve as the new President of Southern Illinois University. Poshard took office in January 2006.&lt;ref&gt;SIU Press Release. [http://news.siu.edu/news/November05/111805sd5057.jsp SIU Board Chooses Poshard For President].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Campus ==
=== Morris Library ===
[[File:MorrisLibraryPhoto.jpg|thumb|left|Morris Library near the completion of major renovations in the fall of 2009.]]
Morris Library is the main library for SIUC.  The Library holds more than 2.6 million volumes, 3.6 million microform units, and over 36,000 current periodicals and serials.  Library users have access to I-Share (the statewide automated library system) and to a comprehensive array of databases and other electronic data files.  As the campus center for access to academic information and collaborative academic technology projects, Morris Library provides a wide range of services, including reference assistance, instructional and technical support, distance learning, geographic information systems (GIS), and multimedia courseware development.  Morris Library is a member of the Consortium of Academic and Research Libraries in Illinois (CARLI),  Association of Research Libraries (ARL), and the Greater Western Library Alliance (GWLA).

In 2009, Morris Library completed a massive renovation and expansion at a cost of $41 million with the architectural design team of PSA Dewberry and [[Woollen, Molzan and Partners]]. The building's original faÃ§ade and the HVAC and elevator systems were completely replaced. Every floor except the basement, sixth and seventh floors of the seven-story building were completely overhauled to drastically improve accessibility and remove confusion. The remaining floors were gutted, but the renovation to those parts of the building were not completed, due to budget shortfalls and cost overruns on the construction. An additional {{convert|50000|sqft|m2}} of space was added to the north side of the library. Delyte's, a new coffee shop named after former SIU President Delyte W. Morris, now operates in a portion of the new space.

=== Student Center ===
[[File:Fun glowbowling.jpg|thumb|&quot;Glow bowling&quot; at the SIU Student Center bowling alley.]]
With over {{convert|8|acre|ha|2}} of floor space, the SIU Student Center is one of the largest student unions in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siucstudentcenter.org/ |title=Home |publisher=SIUC Student Center |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs and services offered provide SIU students, faculty, and staff a place to  relax, gather a group to study or grab a bite to eat.

The Student Center offers several ballrooms and smaller, expandable conference rooms for small or large gatherings. Student-run radio station [[WIDB]] 104.3 FM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.widb.net/ |title=WIDB.net |publisher=WIDB.net |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; broadcasts from the Student Center, and the Black Affairs Office, International Student Council, Student Programming Council or &quot;SPC,&quot; student governments and the Greek Council are among the organizations with their offices in the building.

The Student Center operates a Bowling &amp; Billiards facility that completed a major renovation in 2009, including electronic scoring, new lanes, glow-in-the-dark flooring, flat-screen TVs, drop-down screens, and new seating areas. Each lane is equipped with bumpers, and three IKAN Bowling Ramps will be available to attach to any model of wheelchair, allowing the occupant to control the speed, direction, and timing of the bowling ball's release. Twelve new Olhausen pool tables along with new lighting and an updated sound system are featured on the billiards side of the facility.

Outdoor facilities include several lighted hard-surface tennis courts, Jean Stehr Field (used for intramural baseball, flag football and soccer), a Frisbee golf course, the campus boat dock and campus beach.

=== Health Center ===
On February 3, 2006, SIU opened a new, {{convert|57000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} [http://shc.siuc.edu/ health center] adjacent to the Recreational Center. The $9.6 million dollar facility provides medical services to the university community and houses the medical clinic, pharmacy, wellness resources, mental health clinic, and sports medicine and physical therapy facilities.

{{main|Southern Illinois Salukis}}
The '''Southern Illinois Salukis''' are the athletic teams representing Southern Illinois University Carbondale. The university first sponsored athletic teams during the 1913â14 school year, when they were known as the &quot;Maroons.&quot; Students and faculty began lobbying for a new mascot during the late 1940s. On March 19, 1951, the student body voted to change the official nickname to the Salukis. The [[saluki]], the royal dog of ancient Egypt, was chosen as the mascot due to its reputation as a fast and tenacious hunter and because the southern Illinois region is known as &quot;[[Little Egypt (region)|Little Egypt]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siusalukis.cstv.com/ot/saluki-mascot.html |title=Southern Illinois Official Athletic Site â Athletics |publisher=Siusalukis.cstv.com |date=March 19, 1951 |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Salukis sponsor 16 varsity teams. Most compete in the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] (MVC), specifically in men's and women's basketball, men's and women's cross country, men's and women's golf, softball, women's swimming, men's and women's tennis, men's and women's track and field, and volleyball.

=== Cardboard Boat Regatta ===
[[File:Siucampus lake.JPG|thumb|Sunset over Southern Illinois University's Campus Lake.]]
The Cardboard Boat Regatta is an event held every spring semester at Campus Lake. Participants include university students and community members both young and old. The goal is to complete three trips around a 200-yard course on the lake using makeshift cardboard boats. There are three different categories for entries: canoes or kayaks, experimental boats and instant boats (boats created on-site the day of the event).

The idea for a Cardboard Regatta first originated in 1974 at Southern Illinois University. Richard Archer, a professor of Art and Design, dreamed up a final examination for students in his freshman design class. [[Buckminster Fuller]], then a Distinguished Professor at SIU, had espoused the principle of &quot;doing the most with the least,&quot; and faculty members found it intriguing to apply these principles in their classes. Archer felt it would be a real test of students' creativity and three-dimensional design skills to build human-sized boats made only of cardboard, and more than 20 years later, it is still happening.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gcbr.com/faqs.html&lt;/ref&gt; Many communities, organizations and other universities around the country have joined in on the fun and now organize their own Cardboard Boat Regattas.

=== Competitive programs ===

Three Flying Salukis captured individual titles as well&lt;ref&gt;http://nifa.us/SAFECON_2011_Results.html&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The aviation program has been one of the best nationally for many years, with SIU's young pilots winning the International Aerobatic Club Collegiate National Team Award five of the last six years.
