{{main|Windows Aero}}

Premium editions of Windows Vista include a redesigned user interface and visual style, named ''Windows Aero (Authentic, Energetic, Reflective and Open)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aero is intended to be cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing than previous Windows versions, including glass-like transparencies and window animations. Windows Aero also features a new default font ([[Segoe UI]]) with a slightly larger size, a streamlined style for [[Wizard (software)|wizards]], and a change in the tone and phrasing of most of the dialogs and control panels.

In addition to the Windows Aero visual style, Windows Vista Home Basic exclusively includes a &quot;Windows Vista Standard&quot; theme which has the same hardware requirements as &quot;Windows Aero&quot;, and therefore uses the [[Desktop Window Manager]] for desktop composition, but does not include the ability to generate live thumbnails of running applications, nor does it allow transparency of the window frame. As a result, 3D effects and other features associated with live thumbnails are not included with this theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Included with all versions, there is a &quot;Windows Vista Basic&quot; theme which does not use desktop composition, and is geared towards lower-end machines that are not able to use the [[Desktop Window Manager]]; this theme being comparable to the Luna XP theme. Finally Vista includes the &quot;Windows Classic&quot; and &quot;Windows Standard&quot; themes which are similar to the classic themes in Windows 2000 and Windows XP. [[Windows Aero]] is not available in Windows Vista Home Basic and Starter editions, although the [[Desktop Window Manager]] is included in Windows Vista Home Basic.

===Start menu===
{{main|Start menu}}
In [[Windows Vista]], the Start Menu has undergone major changes, with the taskbar icon no longer labeled &quot;Start&quot; but instead has the Windows pearl orb. At the top level, the Start Menu, as in Windows XP, has two columns of menu choices. Under the default configuration, the &quot;Run,&quot; and &quot;Printers&quot; options do not appear. However, those items can be added to the Start Menu. One of the chief additions with Windows Vista is a ''Search'' pane or box, where users may begin typing immediately. The contents of the Start menu itself are indexed and searchable, besides the global search index. If indexing is turned on, the search box returns results on-the-fly as users type into it. This allows the Start menu to act as a fast and powerful application launcher. The Start menu search also doubles as the Run command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The Run command can also be added separately to the right column in the Start menu.

Another major change to the Start menu in Windows Vista is that it no longer presents the ''All programs'' menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a ''Back'' button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present at the top of the right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The ''Power'' button's action is configurable through ''Power options'' in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer into Sleep mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the ''Lock'' button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the ''Lock'' button is clicked.

Like Windows XP, Windows Vista allows users to switch back to the pre-Windows XP style &quot;Classic&quot; Start menu, however, the ''Search'' box is not present on the Classic Start menu.

===Windows Explorer===
&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Windows Explorer Vista.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in Windows Vista]] --&gt;
{{main|Windows Explorer}}
====Layout and visualization====
Windows Explorer's task pane has been removed, integrating the relevant task options into the toolbar. A Favorites pane on the left contains commonly accessed folders and prepopulated ''Search Folders''. Seven different views are available to view files and folders, namely, List, Details, Small icons, Medium icons, Large icons, Extra large icons or Tiles. File and folder actions such as Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Redo, Delete, Rename and Properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the ''Organize'' button is clicked. It is also possible to change the layout of the Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display Classic Menus, a Search Pane, a Preview Pane, a Reading Pane, and/or the Navigation Pane. Document Properties are available from the common 'Open' and 'Save' dialog boxes, so it is easier to add metadata (such as ''author'' or ''subject'') to a document. The metadata can be viewed and edited in the ''Details Pane'' that shows up at the bottom of an Explorer window. The ''Navigation Pane'' contains a list of most common folders (the ''Favorites'') for quick navigation. It can also show the folder layout of the entire hard drive or a subset of it. It can contain both real folders as well as [[Virtual folder#Windows Vista|virtual ones]]. By default it contains links to folders such as ''Documents'' and the publicly shared folder, as well as virtual folders that search and present the saved virtual folders and that lists the recently changed documents. The ''Preview Pane'' can be used to preview the contents of a document, including viewing pictures in a size larger than the thumbnails shown in the folder listing, and sampling contents of a media file, without opening any additional program. Explorer can show a preview for any image format if the necessary codec authored using the ''[[Windows Imaging Component]]'' is installed. Also, if an application installs ''Preview handlers'' (like [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]] does), then the documents can be edited in the preview pane itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/07/13/10-things-windows-explorer-has-a-new-preview-pane.aspx | title = 10 Things - Windows Explorer Has a New Preview Pane | author = Nick White | publisher = Windows Shell Blog | accessdate = 2007-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows Explorer also contains modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer is the ''Details pane'', which displays metadata and information relating to the currently selected file or folder. Windows Vista introduces a newer IThumbnailProvider interface that shows thumbnails in the Details pane as well as in large icon views. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file. Thumbnails can be zoomed on. The preview panel allows you to see thumbnails of all sorts of files and view the contents of documents, similar to the way you can preview email messages in Outlook, without opening the files. There's a new intelligent algorithm for creation of Video thumbnails, which chooses a random frame inside the video and ensures the thumbnail is not black (XP showed the first frame, it was usually black).  

The address bar has been modified to present a [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumbs]] view, which shows the full path to the current location. Clicking any location in the path hierarchy takes the user to that level, instead of repeatedly pressing the Back button. This is roughly analogous to what is possible prior to Windows Vista by pressing the small down-arrow next to &quot;Back&quot; and selecting any folder from a list of previously accessed folders. It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow to the right of the last item, or to click in the space to the right of this to copy or edit the path manually. As with many other Microsoft-made Windows Vista applications, the menu bar is hidden by default. Pressing the Alt key makes the menu bar appear. Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars. Check boxes allow the selection of multiple files. When items are grouped, clicking the group header selects all items under that group. Multiple groups of files can also be selected by clicking the group headers while holding down Ctrl. 

==== Icons ====

[[Icon (computing)|Icons]] in Windows Vista are visually more realistic than illustrative. Icons are scalable in size up to 256&amp;nbsp;Ã 256 pixels. Required icon sizes are 16&amp;nbsp;Ã 16, 32&amp;nbsp;Ã 32, and 256&amp;nbsp;Ã 256. Optional sizes are 24&amp;nbsp;Ã 24, 48&amp;nbsp;Ã 48, 64&amp;nbsp;Ã 64, 96&amp;nbsp;Ã 96, and 128&amp;nbsp;Ã 128. Document icons show the actual document contents and several media types are distinguished by icon overlays (video, audio, photos). The icons can be zoomed in and out using a gradual slider or by holding down the ''Ctrl'' key and using the mouse scroll wheel. To optimize and reduce the size of large icons, icons may be stored as compressed [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]]s. To maintain backward compatibility with earlier versions of Windows, only larger sized icons can use lossless PNG

==== Organizing &amp; metadata ====

Windows Explorer includes significant changes from previous versions of Windows in terms of organization. Column headers are available in all Explorer views and allow filtering, sorting, grouping and stacking. Combined with integrated desktop search, Explorer allows users to find and organize their files in new ways, such as &quot;Stacks&quot;. The &quot;Stacks&quot; view groups files according to the criterion specified by the user. Stacks can be clicked to filter the files shown in Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer also sorts files on-the-fly automatically as they are renamed or pasted.

The ''Details pane'' also allows for the change of some textual metadata such as &quot;Author&quot; and &quot;Title&quot; in files that support them within Windows Explorer. A new type of metadata called tags allows users to add descriptive terms to documents for easier categorization and retrieval. Some files support open metadata, allowing users to define new types of metadata for their files. Out of the box, Windows Vista supports Microsoft Office documents and most audio files. Metadata support for other file types can however be added by writing ''Property handlers''. Unlike previous versions of Windows, all metadata is stored inside the file, so that it will always travel with the file. However, initially, users will be able to add metadata to only a few file types.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/help/0acda837-dacc-4a88-bb01-43dc816ad3821033.mspx Windows Vista Help: Add tags or other properties to files]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== File operations ====

When moving or copying files, Windows Explorer displays the full source and destination path, size and number of items and the transfer speed in megabytes per second (MB/s). If a conflict or error is encountered, it does not terminate the copy, move or delete operation. Rather, the file is skipped and the rest of the files processed. At the end of the operation, the errors are presented to the user with resolution options (if available). If two files have the same name, an option is available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the only options were to either replace the destination file or cancel the process. The user can also choose to apply the same action to further conflicts, if any. Also, for the first time in Windows, processing of dates when moving trees is somewhat consistent. Until now, every folder and subfolder obtained all three dates new to the time of operation. This was from the own nature of the operation at the file system level, create destination folders, move files, delete origin folders. Moved folders in Vista preserve creation and modification dates. Access date gets the time of the operation.

When renaming a file, even when extensions are being displayed, Explorer highlights only the filename without selecting the extension. Renaming multiple files is quicker as pressing Tab automatically renames the existing file or folder and opens the file name text field for the next file for renaming. Shift+Tab allow renaming in the same manner upwards.

In case a file is in use or &quot;locked&quot; by another application, Windows Explorer informs users to close the application and retry the file operation. Also, a new interface &lt;code&gt;IFileIsInUse&lt;/code&gt; is introduced into the API which developers can use to let other applications switch to the main window of the application that has the file open or simply close the file from the &quot;File In Use&quot; dialog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/03/29/Your-File-Is-In-Use_2620_-Demystified.aspx 'File in Use' Demystified]&lt;/ref&gt; If the running application exposes these operations by means of the &lt;code&gt;IFileIsInUse&lt;/code&gt; interface, Windows Explorer, upon encountering a locked file, allows the user to close the file or switch to the application from the dialog box itself.
&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:Fileinuse.png|thumb|right|240px|Windows Explorer allows to close and unlock the files used by other applications]] --&gt;

=== Default Programs ===

A common issue in previous Windows versions was that competing applications doing common tasks each tried to associate themselves as the default for a certain file type using their own custom user interface. The default application information for a particular file type was stored in the registry on a per-machine basis, resulting in applications changing another user's default program when one user's defaults were changed and each application querying several different registry values when launched. In Windows Vista onwards, [[File association|file type associations]] and protocol handlers can be set on a per-user basis using the new ''Default Programs'' API, meaning default programs for file types and tasks can be different for each individual user. There is an API for calling a common ''user interface'' so applications no longer need to maintain their own file association UI. The Default Programs API gives applications a programmatic way to check for and discover other default applications, restore a single or all registered defaults, query for the owner of a specific default file association/protocol, launch the ''Default Programs UI'' for a specific application or clear all per user associations. Applications only need to registered at install time to be part of ''Default Programs''.

=== Windows Flip and Flip 3D ===
[[Image:Vista Flip 3d.png|thumb|right|Windows Flip 3D]]

For all Windows Vista Premium Ready PCs, when using Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, a preview of each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a cascading stack of their open windows using the mouse scroll wheel. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views of all of them simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are ''Win+Tab'', which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, ''Ctrl+Win+Tab'', which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and ''Shift+Win+Tab'' to flip through open windows backward).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/windowsvista/features/default.aspx | title=Windows Vista: The Features: User Experience | author=Microsoft | publisher=Microsoft }}&lt;/ref&gt; The window buttons on the taskbar show a thumbnail image of the window, when the mouse hovers over the button.

=== Windows Ultimate Extras ===
{{main|Windows Ultimate Extras}}
Windows Ultimate Extras are optional features offered to users of [[Windows Vista]] [[Windows Vista editions|Ultimate]], accessible from [[Windows Update]]. They include [[Windows DreamScene]], a utility that allows videos to be used as desktop backgrounds, MUI packs, Windows Sound Schemes, games and BitLocker enhancements.

=== Other shell improvements ===
* The Date and Time control panel has been rewritten completely for Windows Vista and allows two additional clocks to be displayed in analog and digital style which can be from other time zones. The calendar control is also enhanced.
* Detection of [[Blu-ray Disc]], [[HD DVD]], [[Super Video CD]] and [[Video CD]] were added to [[AutoPlay]]. AutoPlay in Windows Vista and later is a global Control Panel setting instead of a per-device setting.
* It is now possible to install and select non-English languages on a per-user basis which transforms the entire shell user interface and applications into Arabic, Chinese, French, German, Japanese or Spanish from the next login. This feature is only available in the Enterprise and Ultimate editions of Windows Vista.
* [[JPEG]] files can be natively set as the desktop [[Computer wallpaper|wallpaper]] without using [[Active Desktop]] (which is no longer supported).&lt;ref name=&quot;kramercompat5&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the [[aspect ratio]] of images is maintained properly while applying them as the desktop wallpaper.
* Windows Vista includes new [[Disk Cleanup]] handlers for cleaning up setup log files, system error memory dumps and the [[Windows thumbnail cache|thumbnail cache]].
* A Property Sheet shell extension known as ''Previous Versions'' can revert the contents of any file to an arbitrary point in the past from the file's ''Properties''. The ''Previous Versions'' feature utilizes [[Shadow Copy]], a storage backup technology introduced in Windows Server 2003.
* [[Dialog box]]es also display their status on the [[taskbar]]. Previously, only [[Window (computing)|windows]] showed their status on the taskbar.
* The ''Version'' tab that appeared for binary files with version information in Windows XP and the ''Summary'' tab that appeared for all files on NTFS volumes have been combined into a single ''Details'' tab. If a ''Property handler'' is installed, the Details property sheet allows editing file metadata similar to the Details pane. Windows Explorer has built-in ability to remove any extra metadata associated with the file (Remove Properties and Personal Information).
* Windows Vista includes context menu commands for folders to open a command prompt at the selected folder and to copy their path. Shortcut items have a context menu to open their target location. A sound event and shell overlay icon are also present for [[User Account Control]].
* A new ''Task Dialog'' [[API]] to address the common misuse of the old Message Box API and make designing custom dialogs easier.
* Common dialogs for applications such as Open, Save, Choose folder, Print, Page Setup, Font have been enhanced.
* Windows Vista includes a ''Games'' folder (also known as the [[Games for Windows#Games Explorer|Games Explorer]]), which provides access to all installed games from a single location, thereby making it easy to manage multiple games.
* [[WebDAV]] has been enhanced to support operation over [[Secure Sockets Layer|SSL]] connections, as well as connecting on alternate ports. An update for [[Windows XP]] SP2 which supports this feature is also available. [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/892211] However, in [[Windows Vista]], only the WebDAV redirector is present while the original &quot;Web folders&quot; client has been removed. The Web Folders client is only installed if Office 2003 or an earlier version of Office is installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ureader.com/message/33325723.aspx WebDAV in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improvements to the Windows C++ standard and common [[GUI widget|controls]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163384.aspx Windows Vista Control Enhancements] &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Windows Search ===
{{see also|Windows Search}}
{{Anchor|Search}}
Windows Vista features system-wide integrated search, called ''Instant Search'' (also known as ''Windows Search'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Windows Vista: Features Explained: Instant Search|url = http://www.microsoft.com/windows/products/windowsvista/features/details/instantsearch.mspx |accessdate = 2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Instant Search'' is designed to run significantly faster and offers more customized search capabilities. Search boxes have been added throughout the Explorer user interface, to the Start menu, Open/Save dialog boxes, and several of the applications included with Windows Vista. By default, Instant Search indexes only a small number of folders such as the start menu, the names of files opened, the Documents folder, and the user's e-mail. Beyond searching for files, search works with Help, Control Panel, Networking, and more. In Control Panel, for example, typing &quot;firewall&quot; will instantly return all applets that have to do with the system firewall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/winvista_rc1_best.asp Five Great Features in Windows Vista RC1]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Windows Vista Search.png|thumb|right|The ''Search Explorer'' advanced search pane]]

The search engine uses indexing to allow for a quick display of results for a given search. Advanced options allow the user to choose the file type, how it should be indexed, the properties only, or the properties and the file contents. The Start menu search also doubles as the ''Run'' command from previous versions of Windows; simply typing any command will execute it. The indexed search platform is based on [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Desktop Search]] 3.0 ([[Windows Search]] version 4.0 in Vista SP2), allowing third-party applications (e.g. [[Microsoft Outlook]] 2007) to use the indexing platform to store [[metadata]] and perform searches on Windows Vista or Windows XP (with the [[Windows Desktop Search]] redistributable installed). This is in contrast to the search engine of Windows XP, which takes some time to display results, and only after the user has finished typing the search string. The Windows Vista search allows users to add multiple filters to continually refine search results (Such as &quot;File contains the word 'example'&quot;). It is also possible to search across RSS and [[Atom (standard)|Atom]] feeds, straight from Windows Explorer. Windows search uses [[IFilters]] that are used by Windows Desktop Search as well. The IFilter interface can be implemented by software makers so that files created by their applications can be better integrated with search and indexing programs.

Searching can also be done from the box at the bottom of the start menu, so it is possible to start a program from here by typing its name, for example &quot;Calc&quot; to start the calculator, &quot;Word&quot; to start Microsoft Word, &quot;Mail&quot; to open Windows Mail, a web address to start the default browser at a particular site, the default search engine, or even a folder name, filename or network share name.

There is also the ability to save searches as a [[Virtual folder|Search Folder]] where opening the folder will execute a specific search automatically and display the results as a normal folder. A search folder is just an XML file which stores the search query, including the search operators as well. When these files are accessed, the search is run with the saved query string and the results presented as a virtual folder. Windows Vista also supports query composition, where a saved search (called a ''scope'') can be nested within the query string of another search.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2006/10/31/Query-Composition_3A00_-Building-a-search-upon-another-search.aspx | title = Query Composition: Building a search upon another search | accessdate = 2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; These virtual folders are also distributable via [[RSS (file format)|RSS]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

Windows Vista also features an enhanced file content search for non-indexed locations, whereby the files being scanned are processed by the same IFilters that would be used for indexing, therefore offering more consistent results between indexed and non-indexed searches as well as the ability for third-parties to add support for additional file formats to have their content searched.

=== Windows Sidebar ===

[[Image:Sidebar Gadgets RTM.png|thumb|right|Windows Gadgets]]
{{main|Windows Sidebar}}
[[Windows Sidebar]] is a new panel which can be placed on either the left or the right-hand side of the screen where a user can place [[Desktop Gadgets]], which are small applets designed for a specialized purpose (such as displaying the weather or sports scores). The gadgets can also be placed on other parts of the desktop, if desired, by dragging. By default, Windows Vista ships with 11 gadgets: Calendar, Clock, Contacts, CPU Meter, Currency Conversion, Feed Headlines, Notes, Picture Puzzle, Slide Show, Stocks, and Weather. Additional gadgets are published at Microsoft's web site, which offers both Microsoft-created and user-submitted gadgets in a gallery.

[[Microsoft Gadgets|Gadgets]] are written using a combination of [[Dynamic HTML|DHTML]] for visual layout, [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]] for functional code, and an [[Extensible Markup Language|XML]] file for defining the gadget's metadata (author name, description, etc.) The gadget is then distributed as a ZIP file with a .gadget extension. Displaying the gadget using [[Dynamic HTML|DHTML]] allows the same gadget to be used on Microsoft's [[Live.com]] and [[Windows Live Spaces]] sites. Alternatively, on Windows Vista, the gadget can detect that [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]] is available and take advantage of its graphical abilities to display differently from the web version.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Windows Calendar.png|thumb|[[Windows Calendar]]]] --&gt;
[[Image:Paint Vista.png|thumb|[[Paint (software)|Paint]]]]

* '''[[Backup and Restore Center]]''' also known as '''[[Backup and Restore Center|Windows Backup Status and Configuration]]''' replaces [[NTBackup]] although Windows NT Backup Restore Utility is available for download&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/0065e938-1191-4c1a-96db-d21fdc8ca1ab1033.mspx Windows NT Backup Restore Utility is available for download]&lt;/ref&gt;  Backup and Restore Center operates in two modes: (a) Backup/Restore selected files&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/699ce30c-13f1-46ec-9684-e84bf4109dd81033.mspx Windows File Backup]&lt;/ref&gt; or (b) Complete PC Backup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/Windows/en-US/Help/ca11e84f-fce6-4e3e-82ef-467870bb6baf1033.mspx Windows Complete PC Backup]&lt;/ref&gt; If using Complete PC Backup, incremental snapshots are stored on external hard disk or optical media, and the complete system can be restored to protect against hardware failure or severe software damage.  Automatic scheduling of file backups is not available in Vista Home Basic.  Complete PC Backup is not available in Vista Home Basic and Home Premium.
* '''[[Windows Mail]]''' replaces [[Outlook Express]], the [[email]] client in previous Windows versions. It incorporates a Phishing Filter like the one found in IE7 as well as [[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian junk mail filtering]] which is updated monthly via Windows Update. Also, e-mail messages are now stored as individual files rather than in a binary database to reduce frequent corruption and make messages searchable in real-time. Backing up and restoring account setup information, configuration and mail store is now made easier. It does however omit some features of Outlook Express , such as identities and a &quot;Block sender&quot; for Usenet access. Windows Mail is itself being replaced with [[Windows Live Mail]].
* '''[[Windows Contacts]]''', a new unified contact and personal information management application, replaces [[Windows Address Book]] (WAB). It is based on a new [[XML]] based file format where each contact appears as an individual .contact file, and features extensibility APIs for integration with other applications. It can store custom information related to contacts, including display pictures. The legacy *.wab format and the open standard *.vcf ([[vCard]]) and *.csv (Comma separated values) file formats are also supported.
* '''[[Windows Calendar]]''' is the new calendar application that is included in Windows Vista. It supports the popular [[iCalendar]] format as well as sharing, subscribing and publishing of calendars on [[WebDAV]]-enabled web servers and network shares.
* '''[[Windows Fax and Scan]]''', which is available '''only''' in the Business, Ultimate and Enterprise editions of Windows Vista, is an integrated faxing and scanning application. With this users can send and receive faxes, fax or email scanned documents and forward faxes as email attachments from the computer. It replaces (or enhances) the 'Fax Services' component which was available as an optional component in [[Windows XP]]. By connecting a [[Image scanner|scanner]] and a fax-capable [[modem]] to the computer, users can preview documents before scanning them and can choose to directly fax or email the scanned documents. The [[user interface]] resembles that of '[[Windows Mail]]' with preview pane, tree views etc.
* '''[[Windows Meeting Space]]''', the replacement for [[NetMeeting]], is a [[peer-to-peer]] (p2p) collaboration application. Users can share applications (or their entire desktop) with other users on the local network, or over the Internet. Windows Meeting Space allows sharing of the desktop with other co-workers, distribution and collaborative editing of documents, and passing notes to other participants. Windows Meeting Space automatically finds other users using ''People Near Me'', a technology that uses [[WS-Discovery]] to see other users on a local network.
* '''[[Paint (software)|Paint]]''' has new features such as a crop function and the undo limit has been raised from 3 to 10.
* '''[[WordPad]]''' now supports the [[Text Services Framework]], using which [[Windows Speech Recognition]] is implemented. Therefore, it is possible to dictate text in WordPad, and similar other applications which support RichEdit.
* '''[[Windows Sound Recorder|Sound Recorder]]''' has been rewritten and now supports recording clips of any length and saving them as [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]]. However, saving to [[WAV]] format is not supported except in the N editions of Windows Vista.

[[Image:Snipping Tool Vista.png|thumb|[[Snipping Tool]]]]

* '''[[Snipping Tool]]''', first introduced in ''Experience Pack for [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] 2005'', is a screen-capture tool that allows for taking screen shots (called ''snips'') of windows, rectangular areas, or free-form areas. ''Snips'' can then be annotated, saved (as an image file or [[HTML]] page), or e-mailed.
* The '''[[Microsoft Magnifier|Magnifier]]''' accessibility tool uses [[Windows Presentation Foundation|WPF]], which in turn uses vector images to render the content. As a result, the rendered magnified image is sharp and not pixelated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/tims/archive/2006/04/04/568648.aspx Magnifier in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; However, this applies only to WPF applications. Non-WPF applications are still magnified the traditional way. Also, due to a change introduced in WPF 3.5 SP1, this functionality is lost if .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 is installed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/greg_schechter/archive/2008/05/12/gpu-accelerated-custom-effects-for-wpf.aspx GPU-accelerated custom effects for WPF: Greg Schechter's blog]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has also released a ''Magnification API'' to allow assistive technology applications to use the Magnifier engine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms692162(VS.85).aspx Magnification SDK]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Windows Photo Gallery Vista.png|thumb|[[Windows Photo Gallery]]]]

* '''[[Windows Photo Gallery]]''', a photo and video library management application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual pictures including custom metadata based on the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]]. It also allows basic editing of images, such as adjusting color and exposure, resizing, cropping, red-eye reduction and printing. Slideshows, with pan, fade and other effects, can also be created, and burnt to DVD. It allows custom metadata to be added to images and videos, and enables searching by the attributes. It also supports [[Raw image format|RAW images]] natively and can open and organize any image format for which image codecs are installed in the [[Windows Imaging Component]]. Images and videos may be viewed in the ''Windows Photo Gallery Viewer'' with options to zoom, pan and losslessly rotate images, pause or play videos, and bring up the ''Info'' pane to view and edit metadata about a photo or video. ICC V4 color profiles embedded in images are also supported. The ''Photo Print Wizard'' has been improved to offer a lot of customizability. An upgraded version of this, [[Windows Live Photo Gallery]] allows you to upload and share photos and videos online as part of [[Windows Live]] services.

* '''[[Windows Movie Maker]]''' supports smooth [[Direct3D]]-based effects and transitions, editing and outputting HD video, importing recorded [[DVR-MS]] format videos, as well as burning the output movie on a CD. In Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate editions, it can import [[HDV]] video from camcorders and output video to [[Windows DVD Maker]] for creating [[DVD-Video]] discs. New effects and transitions have been added. All Windows Vista Movie Maker versions require pixel shader hardware support.
* '''[[Windows DVD Maker]]''', a DVD creation application. Applications can also pass an XML file to DVD maker for authoring and burning.

* '''Games''': [[Minesweeper (computer game)|Minesweeper]], [[Solitaire (Windows)|Solitaire]], [[Hearts (Windows)|Hearts]], [[FreeCell]] and [[Spider Solitaire (Windows)|Spider Solitaire]] have been updated and rewritten to take advantage of Windows Vista's new graphics capabilities. Also included are new games, namely, [[Purble Place]], [[Chess Titans]] and [[Mahjong Titans]]. [[InkBall]], a game previously available only with [[Tablet computer|Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]], has been included and can also be played using a mouse. [[Full Tilt! Pinball|Pinball]] has been dropped. As of September 2008, users of the ''Ultimate'' edition of Windows Vista can also download [[Texas Hold 'Em Poker]] and [[Microsoft Tinker]] as [[Windows Ultimate Extras|Ultimate Extras]].

=== Windows Internet Explorer 7 ===

[[Image:Windows Internet Explorer 7 Vista.png|thumb|[[Windows Internet Explorer]] 7]]
{{main|Internet Explorer 7|Internet Explorer 8}}
Windows Vista includes Internet Explorer 7 and can be upgraded to later versions of Internet Explorer such as [[Internet Explorer 8]] or [[Internet Explorer 9]]. Internet Explorer 7 adds support for [[tabbed browsing]], [[Atom (standard)|Atom]], [[RSS (file format)|RSS]], [[internationalized domain name]]s, a search box, a [[phishing]] filter, an anti-spoofing URL engine, fine-grained control over ActiveX add-ons, thumbnails of all open tabs in a single window (called Quick Tabs), page zoom, and tab groups. Tab groups make it possible to open a folder of Favorites in tabs with a single click. Importing bookmarks and cookies from other web browsers is also supported. Additionally, there is now proper support for [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] images with transparency as well as improvements and fixes to [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]] and HTML rendering. The [[Windows RSS Platform]] offers native [[RSS (file format)|RSS]] support, with developer APIs.

On Windows Vista, Internet Explorer operates in a special &quot;Protected Mode&quot;, which runs the browser in a security sandbox that has no access to the rest of the operating system or file system, except the ''[[Temporary Internet Files]]'' folder. This feature aims to mitigate problems whereby newly-discovered flaws in the browser (or in [[ActiveX]] controls hosted inside it) allowed hackers to subversively install software on the user's computer (typically spyware).&lt;ref name=&quot;protectedmodeie&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer 7 in Windows Vista also exclusively supports [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] (AES) key lengths up to 256 bits outlined in RFC 3268 and [[Public key certificate|certificate]] revocation checking using [[Online Certificate Status Protocol]]. The TLS implementation has also been updated to support extensions as outlined in RFC 3546, most notable of which is [[Server Name Indication]] support.

Internet Explorer 7 additionally features an update to the WinInet API. The new version has better support for [[IPv6]], and handles hexadecimal literals in the IPv6 address. It also includes better support for [[Gzip]] and [[deflate]] compression, so that communication with a web server can be compressed and thus will require less data to be transferred.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/10/31/487509.aspx IE's Gzip and deflate support]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/06/06/425875.aspx IE already supports Gzip and deflate]&lt;/ref&gt; Internet Explorer Protected Mode support in WinInet is exclusive to Windows Vista and later Windows versions.

=== Windows Media Player 11 ===
{{main|Windows Media Player}}
[[Image:Windows Media Player 11 Vista.png|thumb|[[Windows Media Player]] 11]]
Windows Media Player 11, which is also available on [[Windows XP]], features a revised interface. The ''Media Library'' is now presented without the category trees which were prominent in the earlier versions. Rather, on selecting the category in the left pane, the contents appear on the right, in a graphical manner with thumbnailsâa departure from textual presentation of information. Missing album art can be added directly to the placeholders in the Library itself (though the program re-renders all album art imported this way into 1:1 pixel ratio, 200x200 resolution [[jpeg]]s). Views for ''Music'', ''Pictures'', ''Video'' and ''Recorded TV'' are separate and can be chosen individually from the navigation bar. Entries for ''Pictures'' and ''Video'' show their thumbnails.  Search has been upgraded to be much faster.

Windows Media Player 11 in Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate Editions supports MMC-5 driver commands for the [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] content protection scheme, as well as the [[Universal Disk Format|UDF]] file system which is required for [[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] and [[HD DVD]] playback. However, all of the codecs required for playback of HD DVD and Blu-ray video are not included. '''[[VC-1]]''' and the '''[[MPEG-2]]''' video decoders, as well as the [[Dolby Digital|Dolby Digital (AC-3) 5.1]] audio decoder are included in Windows Vista Home Premium and Ultimate Editions. [[H.264]] video and other multichannel surround sound audio standards still require third party decoders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2006/may06/05-24WinHECHDDVDPR.mspx Microsoft press release on HD DVD playback]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdrinfo.com/Sections/News/Details.aspx?NewsId=17217 Windows Vista and HD DVD Playback]&lt;/ref&gt;

Other features of Windows Media Player 11 include:
* Windows Media Format 11 Runtime - Updates the earlier Windows Media runtime to support low bitrate WMA Professional Audio and includes a [[VC-1]] compliant WMV Advanced Profile codec. Support for ripping audio CDs to [[WAV]] and [[Windows Media Audio#Windows_Media_Audio_Professional|WMA 10 Pro]] formats is also added. 
* Stacking - Stacking allows graphical viewing of how many albums exist in a specific category of music. The pile appears larger as the category contains more albums.
*''Search improvements'' - Searches and displays results as characters are being entered, without waiting for ''Enter'' key to be hit. Results are refined based on further characters that are typed.
*''Disc spanning'' - ''CD Burning'' now shows a graphical bar showing how much space will be used on the disc. It splits a burn list onto multiple discs in case the content does not fit on one disc.
* Global Status - Global status shows a broad overview of what the player is doing. The information presented include status information regarding buffering, ripping, burning and synchronization.
*Improved synchronization features for loading content onto [[PlaysForSure]]-compatible portable players. WMP 11 supports reverse-synchronization, by which media present on the portable device can be replicated back to the PC. 
* Media Sharing - which allows one to share their Media library and make it accessible to other PCs running [[Windows Vista]] or later Windows versions, [[Xbox 360]], or networked Media Receivers via [[UPnP]]. Content (Music, Pictures, Video) can be streamed to and from [[Universal Plug and Play|Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) AV]] enabled devices such as the [[PS3]], [[Xbox 360]], and Roku [[SoundBridge]]. This includes DRM protected [[PlaysForSure]] content.
* [[URGE]] - The new music store from [[Microsoft]] and [[MTV]] networks is integrated with the player. As of October 28, 2007, the URGE service was discontinued when it merged with Rhapsody; the link in Windows Media Player 11 remains but is no longer functional. In order to use Rhapsody, a separate download is required.

Certain features of Media Sharing in Windows Media Player 11 are only available in [[Windows Vista]] and later.&lt;ref name=&quot;wmp11et&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, WMP 11 on Windows Vista can also connect to remote media libraries; this is not available in the Windows XP version.

=== Windows Media Center ===

{{main|Windows Media Center}}
[[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] in Windows Vista, available in the Home Premium and Ultimate editions, has been upgraded significantly, including a considerable overhaul of the user interface. Each button in the main menu, which contains sections such as &quot;Music&quot;, &quot;Videos&quot;, and &quot;TV&quot;, gets encased in a box when selected, and for each selection, a submenu comes up, extending horizontally. When any of the options is selected, the entries for each are presented in a grid-like structure, with each item being identified by album art, if its an audio file, or a thumbnail image if it is a picture, a video or a TV recording, and other related options, such as different views for the music collection if &quot;Music&quot; is selected, extend horizontally along the top of the grid. Similarly, other items are identified by suggestive artwork. The grid displaying the items is also extended horizontally, and the selected item is enlarged compared to the rest.
Other features of Windows Media Center include:

* Support for two dual-tuner cards
* Native DVD/MPEG-2 support
* Addition of ''Movies and DVD'' button which lists all the movies on the hard drive and DVD.
* ''Tasks'' button that provides access to jobs such as setting up and configuring a media center extender device.
* Any video playing is overlaid on the background of the user interface, if the UI is navigated while the video is still playing.
* Support for high-definition (HD) content, and [[CableCARD]] support.
* Uses the .NET 2.0 CLR

=== Internet Information Services 7 ===

[[Image:Internet Information Services 7 Console.png|thumb|right|[[Internet Information Services|IIS]] 7's redesigned management console]]
{{main|Internet Information Services|Windows Activation Services}}
Windows Vista includes '''Internet Information Services''' (IIS) version 7, which has been refactored into a modular architecture, with integrated .NET extensibility. Instead of a monolithic server which features all services, IIS 7 has a core web server engine, and modules offering specific functionality can be added to the engine to enable its features. Writing extensions to IIS 7 using [[ISAPI]] has been deprecated in favor of the module API. Much of IIS's own functionality is built on this API, and as such, developers will have much more control over a request process than was possible in prior versions.

A significant change from previous versions of IIS is that all web server configuration information is stored solely in XML configuration files, instead of in the metabase. The server has a global configuration file that provides defaults, and each virtual web's document root (and any subdirectory thereof) may contain a '''web.config''' containing settings that augment or override the defaults. Changes to these files take effect immediately. This marks a significant departure from previous versions whereby web interfaces, or machine administrator access, was required to change simple settings such as default document, active modules, and security/authentication.

IIS 7 also features a completely rewritten administration interface that takes advantage of modern [[Microsoft Management Console|MMC]] features such as task panes and asynchronous operation. Configuration of [[ASP.NET]] is more fully integrated into the administrative interface.

== Security and safety ==
{{main|Security and safety features new to Windows Vista}}
Beginning in early 2002 with Microsoft's announcement of their [[Trustworthy Computing]] initiative, a great deal of work has gone into making Windows Vista a more secure operating system than its predecessors. Internally, Microsoft adopted a &quot;Secure Development Lifecycle&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sdl&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| author=Steve Lipner, Michael Howard
| title=The Trustworthy Computing Security Development Lifecycle
| publisher=Microsoft Developer Network
| month=March | year=2005

| accessdate=2006-02-15
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; with the underlying ethos of, &quot;Secure by design, secure by default, secure in deployment&quot;. New code for Windows Vista was developed with the SDL methodology, and all existing code was reviewed and refactored to improve security.

Some of the most significant and most discussed security features included with Windows Vista include [[User Account Control]], [[Kernel Patch Protection]], [[BitLocker Drive Encryption]], [[Mandatory Integrity Control]], [[Protected Media Path|Digital Rights Management]], [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Other TCP/IP stack security features|TCP/IP stack security improvements]], [[Address Space Layout Randomization]] and the [[Encrypting File System|EFS]] and [[Cryptographic API|cryptography]] improvements. Additionally, Windows Vista includes a range of [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista#Windows parental controls|parental controls]], which give owners of a computer a set of tools to limit what other accounts on a computer can do, and an improved [[Windows Firewall]] which supports both inbound and outbound packet filtering, IPv6 connection filtering and more detailed configurable rules and policies.

== Management and administration ==
{{main|Management features new to Windows Vista}}
Windows Vista contains a range of new technologies and features that are intended to help [[network administrator]]s and [[power user]]s better manage their systems. Notable changes include a complete replacement of the &quot;Windows Setup&quot; process based on [[Windows Preinstallation Environment]] (WinPE), completely rewritten [[Windows Imaging Format|image-based]] deployment mechanisms, a significantly improved [[Task Scheduler]], a revamped [[Event Viewer#Windows Event Log|eventing infrastructure]], [[Windows Recovery Environment|GUI recovery tools]], support for per-application [[Remote Desktop Protocol|Remote Desktop]] sessions, new diagnostic, health monitoring and [[Management features new to Windows Vista#System tools|system administration tools]], and a range of new [[Group Policy]] settings covering many of the new features.

Previous versions of IIS included with Windows XP had hard limits on concurrent connections and defined web servers; IIS 7.0 on Windows Vista will not limit the number of connections allowed but will limit workloads based on the active concurrent requests to 10.

== Graphics ==
=== Desktop Window Manager ===
{{main|Desktop Window Manager}}
The [[Desktop Window Manager]] is the new [[windowing system]] which handles the drawing of all content to the screen. Instead of windows drawing directly to the video card's memory buffers, contents are instead rendered to back-buffers (technically Direct3D surfaces), which are then arranged in the appropriate Z-order, then displayed to the user. This drawing method uses significantly more video memory than the traditional window-drawing method used in previous versions of Windows, which only required enough memory to contain the composite of all currently visible windows at any given time. With the entire contents of windows being stored in video memory, a user can move windows around the screen smoothly, without having &quot;tearing&quot; artifacts be visible while the operating system asks applications to redraw the newly visible parts of their windows. Other features new to Windows Vista such as live thumbnail window previews and Flip 3D are implemented through the DWM.

Users need to have a [[DirectX]] 9 capable video card to be able to use the Desktop Window Manager. Machines that can't use the DWM fall back to a &quot;Basic&quot; theme, and use screen drawing methods similar to Windows XP.

The [[Desktop Window Manager]] (DWM) is included in all editions of Windows Vista except the Starter edition.

=== DirectX ===
{{main|Direct3D|DirectX Graphics Infrastructure}}

Windows Vista includes a new version of Direct3D, called Direct3D 10. It adds scheduling and memory virtualization capabilities to the graphics subsystem and forgoes the current [[DirectX]] practice of using &quot;capability bits&quot; to indicate which features are active on the current hardware. Instead, Direct3D 10 defines a minimum standard of hardware capabilities which must be supported for a display system to be &quot;Direct3D 10 compatible&quot;. Microsoft's goal is to create an environment for developers and designers where they can be assured that the input they provide will be rendered in exactly the same fashion on all supported graphics cards. This has been a recurring problem with the DirectX 9 model, where different video cards have produced different results, thus requiring fixes keyed to specific cards to be produced by developers.

According to Microsoft, Direct3D 10 will be able to display some graphics up to 8 times faster than DirectX 9.0c because of the new improved [[Windows Display Driver Model]]. In addition, Direct3D 10 incorporates Microsoft's [[High Level Shader Language]] 4.0. However, Direct3D 10 is not backward compatible like prior versions of DirectX. The same game will not be compatible with both Direct3D 10 ''and'' Direct3D 9 or below. Games would need to be developed for both APIs, one version for Direct3D 9 and below if targeting Windows versions prior to Windows Vista and another version using Direct3D 10 if targeting only Windows Vista. Windows Vista does, however, contain a backward compatible Direct3D 9 implementation.

The Direct3D 10 API introduces unified [[Vertex Shader|vertex]] and [[Pixel Shader|pixel shaders]]. In addition, it also supports ''Geometry Shaders'', which operate on entire geometric primitives (points, lines, and triangles), and can allow calculations based on adjacent primitives as well. The output of the geometry shader can be passed directly onwards to the rasterizer for interpolation and pixel shading, or written to a vertex buffer (known as 'stream out') to be fed back into the beginning of the pipeline.

D3D10 functionality requires WDDM ([[Windows Display Driver Model]]) and new graphics hardware. The graphics hardware will be pre-emptively multithreaded, to allow multiple threads to use the GPU in turns. It will also provide paging of the graphics memory.

The version of Direct3D 9 available in Windows Vista is called Direct3D 9Ex. This modified API also uses the [[Windows Display Driver Model|WDDM]] and allows Direct3D 9 applications to access some of the features available in Windows Vista such as cross-process shared surfaces, managed graphics memory, prioritization of resources, text anti-aliasing, advanced gamma functions, and device removal management.

'''Deprecation of other DirectX APIs:'''

In Windows Vista, only [[Direct3D]] features an overhaul. The DirectX SDK mentions that most of the other APIs have been deprecated. [[DirectInput]] and [[DirectPlay]] have been deprecated and some of their components removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb318767(VS.85).aspx DirectPlay deprecated]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.microsoft.com/msdn/showpost.aspx?postid=1198467&amp;siteid=1 DirectInput ConfigureDevices in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; [[DirectSound]] and therefore, [[DirectMusic]] lack hardware abstraction and are emulated in software. The [[DirectMusic]] kernel mode synthesizer that supplies the DirectMusic components with a high-resolution timer has been removed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943253 Timing jitter and clock drift when editing or playing MIDI in Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== DirectX Video Acceleration 2.0 ===
{{main|Media Foundation}}
Windows Vista introduces DirectX Video Acceleration (DXVA) 2.0 which enhances the implementation of the video pipeline and adds a host of other [[Device driver|DDIs]], including a Capture DDI for video capture. The DDIs it shares with DXVA 1.0 are also enhanced with support for hardware acceleration of more operations. Also, the DDI functions are directly available to callers and need not be mediated by the video renderer.&lt;ref name=&quot;new&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms788119.aspx | title = What's New in DirectShow | accessdate = 2007-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, pipelines for simply decoding the media (without rendering) or post-processing and rendering (without decoding) can also be created. These features require the [[Windows Display Driver Model]] drivers.

[[Windows Vista]] also introduces a new video renderer, available as both a [[Media Foundation]] component and a [[DirectShow]] filter, called the ''Enhanced Video Renderer'' (''EVR'').&lt;ref name=&quot;EVR&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms694916.aspx|title=Enhanced Video Renderer|work=MSDN Library|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=2007-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; EVR is designed to work with [[Desktop Window Manager]].

DXVA 2.0 supports only [[Enhanced Video Renderer]] as the video renderer on Windows Vista. DXVA integrates with [[Media Foundation]] and allows DXVA pipelines to be exposed as ''Media Foundation Transforms'' (''MFTs''). Even decoder pipelines or post-processing pipelines can be exposed as MFTs, which can be used by the [[Media Foundation]] topology loader to create a full media playback pipeline. DXVA 1.0 is emulated using DXVA 2.0.

=== Imaging ===
{{main|Windows Imaging Component|HD Photo}}
[[Windows Imaging Component]] '''(WIC)''' is a new extensible imaging framework that allows applications supporting the framework to automatically get support of installed codecs for [[graphics file format]]s. [[Windows Presentation Foundation]] applications also automatically support the installed image codecs. Third party developers can write their own image codecs for their specific image file formats. By default, Windows Vista ships with the [[JPEG]], [[TIFF]], [[GIF]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[BMP file format|BMP]] and [[Windows Media Photo|HD Photo]] codecs. Codecs for [[Raw image format|RAW]] image formats used generally by high-end digital cameras are also supported in this manner. [[Windows Explorer]], [[Windows Photo Gallery]] and Windows Photo Gallery Viewer are based on this new framework and can thus view and organize images in any format for which the necessary codecs are installed.

[[HD Photo]] (previously known as Windows Media Photo)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/xps/wmphoto.mspx HD Photo Specifications]&lt;/ref&gt; is a photographic still [[Graphics file format|image file format]], that is introduced with Windows Vista. It supports features such as [[high dynamic range imaging]], [[Lossy compression|lossy]] as well as [[lossless compression]], up to 32-[[color depth|bpp]] [[Fixed-point arithmetic|fixed]] or [[floating point]] representation, [[Transparency in graphic files|transparency]], [[RGB color model|RGB]], [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] and n-channel [[color space]]s, [[Radiance (software)|Radiance]] [[RGBE image format|RGBE]], embedded [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] color profiles, multiple images per file and support for [[Exchangeable image file format|Exif]] and [[Extensible Metadata Platform|XMP]] [[metadata]] formats. It is the preferred image format for [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] documents.

=== Color management ===
{{main|Windows Color System}}
Windows Vista features ''Windows Color System (WCS)'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/color/WCS.mspx Windows Color System]&lt;/ref&gt; a platform for [[color management]]. Its goal is to obtain color consistency across various software and hardware, including cameras, monitors, printers and scanners. Different devices interpret the same colors differently, according to their software and hardware configurations. As a result, they must be properly calibrated to reproduce colors consistently across different devices. WCS aims to make this process of color calibration automatic and transparent, as an evolution of ICC Color Profiles.

Windows Color System is based on a completely new ''Color Infrastructure and Translation Engine'' (CITE). It is backed up by a new color processing pipeline that supports bit-depths more than 32 bits per pixel, multiple color channels (more than 3), alternative color spaces and high dynamic range coloring, using a technology named ''Kyuanos''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalcamerainfo.com/content/Windows-Vista-to-use-Canon-Color-Management-.htm Windows Vista to use Canon software]&lt;/ref&gt; developed by [[Canon Inc.|Canon]]. The color processing pipeline allows device developers to add their own [[gamut]] mapping algorithm into the pipeline to customize the color response of the device. The new pipeline also uses floating point calculations to minimize round-off losses, which are inherent in integer processing. Once the color pipeline finishes processing the colors, the CITE engine applies a ''color transform'' according to a color profile, specific to a device to ensure the output color matches to what is expected.

WCS features explicit support for LCD as well as CRT monitors, projectors, printers, and other imaging devices and provides customized support for each. WCS uses color profiles according to the CIE Color Appearance Model recommendation ([[CIECAM02]]), defined using [[XML]], to define how the color representation actually translates to a visible color. [[International Color Consortium|ICC]] V4 color profiles are also supported. [[Windows Photo Gallery]] and Photo Viewer, [[Windows Imaging Component]], the [[HD Photo]] format, [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] print path and XPS documents all support color management.

== Mobile computing ==
Some significant changes have been made to Windows Vista for mobile computing.

=== Power management ===
==== Sleep state ====

In Windows Vista, the user can select a ''Hybrid Sleep'' option. Hybrid Sleep saves information from the computer's memory to the hibernation file on disk, but instead of turning off the computer, it simultaneously enters Standby mode. If power is lost, the system resumes from the existing hibernate image on disk. On a laptop, after the specified amount of time, it shuts down (hibernates). Hybrid Sleep thus, offers the benefits of fast resume when in Standby mode and improved reliability in case of power loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://windowshelp.microsoft.com/windows/en-us/help/335c6a5d-0304-4af1-b135-6bf6c124dc111033.mspx#EZEAC Windows Vista Help]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fine-grained power configuration ====
Windows Vista allows fine-grained control over power settings such as setting the power saving mode for wireless adapters, USB selective suspend, [[PCI Express]] link state power management, processor state etc., and also allows configuring power settings for specific scenarios such as while sharing media files, giving a presentation, adaptive display mode and while indexing files.

In earlier Windows versions, drivers sometimes prevented Windows from entering or reliably resuming from a power-saving state. This problem has been solved in Windows Vista. Applications can disable sleep idle timers when needed such as when burning discs or recording media. Away mode, which is not a power plan by itself but a feature, automatically turns off displays, video rendering and sound but keeps the computer working when the user is away from the computer. Optionally, it can also switch to sleep mode. Power settings are also configurable through Group Policy.

The battery icon in the notification area has been improved to let the user more easily select a &quot;Power plan&quot;. &quot;Presentation Settings&quot;, through the Transient Multimon Manager (TMM), allow saving of display preferences when an external display such as a projector or external monitor is connected. The setting can be restored when the same device is re-connected later. Presentation settings are available only on mobile computers.

Beginning with Windows Vista Service Pack 1, the operating system can turn off periodic VSync interrupt counting of CPU when the screen is not being refreshed from new graphics or mouse activity. This can result in significant energy savings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/device/display/wddm_vsync.mspx WHDC: VSync Control in Windows Vista SP1]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other mobility enhancements ===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Windows Mobility Center screenshot.png|thumb|Screenshot of the new Windows Mobility Center control panel.]] --&gt;

* Windows Vista supports USB selective suspend for a wider range of class drivers such as USB video class, portable devices, USB Bluetooth class etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/E/6/5E66B27B-988B-4F50-AF3A-C2FF1E62180F/CON-T537_WH08.pptx USB Technology Update And Windows Connectivity Strategy]&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Windows Mobility Center]] is a new control panel available only on mobile computers that centralizes relevant information and configuration. It is extensible so that hardware manufacturers can add further capabilities to control other features specific to their hardware.
* [[Windows Mobile Device Center]] centralizes management of external mobile devices. It includes a basic RNDIS driver to make simple connections to mobile devices. For complete functionality including synchronization of tasks, calendar data, contacts, email etc. with [[Microsoft Office Outlook]], a driver needs to be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsmobile/devicecenter.mspx Windows Mobile Device Center]&lt;/ref&gt; Synchronization with [[Windows Mail]], [[Windows Calendar]] or [[Windows Contacts]] is not supported. Whenever a Windows Mobile device is connected, the ''Mobile Device Center'' pane pops up giving options to manage media and other files on the device, as well as control their settings.
* Windows Vista has built-in USB [[Media Transfer Protocol]] support, with MTP over TCP/IP as well. With the Platform Update for Windows Vista installed, it also supports MTP over Bluetooth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/wpdblog/archive/2009/08/29/mtp-over-various-transports.aspx MTP Over Various Transports]&lt;/ref&gt;
* A new ''Windows Portable Devices'' API has been introduced to communicate with attached media and all portable devices such as mobile phones, portable media players, PDAs etc.
* Windows Vista introduces [[WinUSB]], a generic ''user-mode'' [[USB]] [[device driver|driver]] with client API for simple devices that are accessed by only one application at a time.
* [[Sync Center]] is a centralized location which provides an organized summary view of any sync partnership users have created for synchronizing data and files, such as mobile devices, network syncing (offline files), portable media devices and so on. While the earlier promised ability to automatically synchronize files among computers using [[peer-to-peer]] technology is not included,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.windowsitpro.com/windowspaulthurrott/Article/ArticleID/50481/windowspaulthurrott_50481.html Microsoft strips key features from Office 2007, Vista]&lt;/ref&gt; a ''powertoy'', [[SyncToy]], is available that supports synchronizing local and network files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/using/digitalphotography/prophoto/synctoy.mspx SyncToy: a free powertoy download for file synchronization&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Windows SideShow]] is a new technology that lets Windows Vista drive a small external display that is built into the outside of a mobile PC's lid. The display can be updated with a number of different kinds of information, such as contacts, maps, calendar, and email. This can then be consulted while the mobile PC is otherwise powered down.&lt;ref name=&quot;sideshowdemo&quot;&gt;Some pictures of an [[ASUS]] notebook computer with a SideShow display was published at notebookreview.com: [http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=2713 Microsoft Windows Vista SideShow - In-Depth].&lt;/ref&gt;
* All the handwriting recognition, speech recognition and pen &amp; ink features from [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] as well as accessories like [[Tablet PC Input Panel]], [[Windows Journal]], Sticky Notes and [[InkBall]] have been included. New features include ''gestures'' and ''pen flicks''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms704819(VS.85).aspx Integrating application gestures]&lt;/ref&gt; There is intrinsic support for handwriting and ink, via the ''Ink Analysis'' API.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/windowsvista/prodinfo/what/mobile/default.aspx Windows Vista Mobile API]&lt;/ref&gt; A new control, the ''InkCanvas'' is made available by the API to add ink support to applications. Ink support can not only recognize handwriting and formatting, but also hand-drawn shapes which are converted to vector-graphics, rendered as the shape that was intended to be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/swick/archive/2007/11/01/shape-recognition-with-wpf-and-inkanalysis.aspx Shape Recognition with WPF and InkAnalysis]&lt;/ref&gt; An update for [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]] containing Ink Analysis and StylusInput API support is also available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=884012e7-dd97-4dbc-bf79-68ce8ee2b590&amp;DisplayLang=en Ink Analysis and Input Supplement for the Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Development Kit 1.7]&lt;/ref&gt; Support for [[touchscreen]]s is also included.
*The [[Tablet PC Input Panel]] has been updated to support AutoComplete. Handwriting recognition accuracy can be improved by training using the handwriting recognition personalization tool. By installing an [[Multilingual User Interface|MUI]] pack for a particular language, handwriting recognition if available for that language can be used as well.

== Language support ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Windows vista french.png|float|right|200px|{{deletable image-caption|1=Friday, 7 August 2009}}]] --&gt;Windows Vista supports more languages than previous versions of Windows (usually Asian e.g. Khmer, Lao). In addition, Windows Vista Enterprise and Ultimate editions allow installing additional languages using [[Multilingual User Interface|MUI]] packs instead of just the install language. Unicode font and character support has also been improved. Windows Vista also supports &quot;custom locales&quot;, allowing users to create their own locale data for use in applications using the ''Locale Builder'' tool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e4588c5e-8f21-45cc-b862-38df8d9bd528&amp;displaylang=en Microsoft Locale Builder for Windows Vista]&lt;/ref&gt;
