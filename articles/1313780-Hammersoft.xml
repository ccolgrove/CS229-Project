'''Snowdon''' is a [[metro station|station]] on the [[Montreal Metro]] [[Rapid transit|rapid transit system]], operated by the [[SociÃ©tÃ© de transport de MontrÃ©al]] (STM). It is located in the [[Snowdon, Quebec|Snowdon]] [[Districts of Montreal|neighbourhood]] of the borough of [[CÃ´te-des-NeigesâNotre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce]] in [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], [[Canada]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stm.info/English/metro/a-m49.htm Snowdon Metro Station]&lt;/ref&gt;. It is a transfer station between the [[Line 2 Orange (Montreal Metro)|Orange Line]] and [[Line 5 Blue (Montreal Metro)|Blue Line]], and is the western terminus of the Blue Line.

The station opened on September 7, 1981 with service on the orange line only, though the blue line platforms were built at the same time. At the time it was the western terminus of the Orange Line, taking over from [[Place-Saint-Henri (Montreal Metro)|Place-Saint-Henri]]; it is thus the only station to have been the terminus of two different lines. Service on the Blue Line began on January 4, 1988.

==Overview==
[[Image:Snowdon Platform Arrangement.svg|thumb|left|160px|Arrangement of platforms at Snowdon station]]
The station was constructed as an anti-directional [[cross-platform interchange]], with three lateral tunnels containing two stories each, joined by four cross-tunnels; both lines therefore have stacked platforms. This layout was intended to allow rapid transfer between a future extension into Notre-Dame-de-GrÃ¢ce and service to downtown; unfortunately, this service never opened, and the station's layout means that most people who transfer between the blue and orange lines must go down stairs. 

The station's central access tunnel is connected at its western end to the station's single entrance, which is integrated into an STM control centre and contains a small sunken garden.

==Architecture and art==
[[File:Snowdon-Murals.JPG|thumb|left|A portion of the &quot;Winter&quot; mural on the platform]]
The station was designed by Jean-Louis Beaulieu, who also provided sculptural grilles for the station's main staircase and the rear of the control building. The station's main artwork, a group of four murals by [[Claude GuitÃ©]] running the full length of the platform and entitled ''Les quatre saisons'' (the four seasons). The murals are painted on 500 panels of asbestos cement stretching the entire length of the platforms, they portray semi-abstract scenes of the foliage and weather associated with each of the four seasons. The seasons go in order, counterclockwise around the platforms, with [[winter]] on the CÃ´te-Vertu platform, [[spring (season)|spring]] on Montmorency, [[summer]] on the Saint-Michel departure platform, and [[autumn]] on the Snowdon arrival platform.

Soon after the station opened the murals were victims of [[graffiti]] that badly damaged the artwork. Attempts of removing the graffiti destroyed large sections of the paintings. In 2004 the murals were all removed for a restoration plan by the STM to have the artist repaint the murals and slowly have them reinstalled in the station. As of June 2010 all the murals have been repainted, and are partially reinstalled on all four platforms of the station with a protective sheet of glass to prevent any future vandalism.

==Origin of the name==
This station is named for the Snowdon neighbourhood. This area took its name from Snowdon Street, which in turn took its name from the owner of the farm on which it was built.
