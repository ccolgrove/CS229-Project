'''Hawaii'''  ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Hawaii.ogg|h|É|Ë|w|aÉª|.|iË}} or {{IPAc-en|h|É|Ë|w|aÉª|Ê|iË}} in English; [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]: '''''Hawai{{okina}}i''''') is the newest of the 50 [[U.S. state]]s (August 21, 1959), and is the only U.S. state made up entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in [[Polynesia]], occupying most of an [[archipelago]] in the central [[Pacific Ocean]], southwest of the continental United States, southeast of Japan, and northeast of Australia. Hawaiiâs diverse natural scenery, warm tropical climate, abundance of public beaches and oceanic surrounding, and active [[volcano]]es make it a popular destination for tourists, surfers, biologists, and volcanologists alike. Due to its mid-Pacific location, Hawaii has many North American and Asian influences along with its own vibrant native culture. Hawaii has over a million permanent residents along with many visitors and U.S. military personnel. Its capital is [[Honolulu]] on the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]].

The state encompasses nearly the entire volcanic [[Hawaiian Islands|Hawaiian Island chain]], which comprises hundreds of islands spread over {{convert|1500|mi}}. At the southeastern end of the archipelago, the eight &quot;main islands&quot; are (from the northwest to southeast) [[Niihau|Ni{{okina}}ihau]], [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], [[Molokai|Moloka{{okina}}i]], [[Lanai|LÄna{{okina}}i]], [[Kahoolawe|Kaho{{okina}}olawe]], [[Maui]], and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawai{{okina}}i]]. The last is by far the largest and is often called &quot;The Big Island&quot; to avoid confusion with the state as a whole. The archipelago is physiographically and ethnologically part of the Polynesian subregion of Oceania.

Hawaii's coastline is approximately {{convert|750|mi|km}} long, which is [[List of U.S. states by coastline|fourth in the United States]] after [[Alaska]], Florida, and California.

In standard American English, Hawaii is generally pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|É|Ë|w|aÉª|.|iË}}. In the [[Hawaiian language]], it is generally pronounced {{IPA-haw|hÉËwÉiÊi|}} or {{IPA-haw|hÉËvÉiÊi|}}.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Hawaii is one of two states that do not observe [[daylight saving time]], the other being [[Arizona]].

==Etymology==
The [[Hawaiian language]] word ''Hawai{{okina}}i'' derives from [[Proto-Polynesian language|Proto-Polynesian]] *''Sawaiki'', with the [[Internal reconstruction|reconstructed]] meaning &quot;homeland&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;Pollexâa reconstruction of the Proto-Polynesian lexicon, Biggs and Clark, 1994. The asterisk preceding the word signifies that it is a reconstructed word form.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hawai{{okina}}i'' [[cognates]] are found in other Polynesian languages, including [[MÄori language|MÄori]] (''Hawaiki''), [[Cook Islands Maori|Rarotongan]] (''Ê»Avaiki''), and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] (''Savai{{okina}}i''). (See also Hawaiki).

According to Pukui and Elbert,&lt;ref&gt;Pukui and Elbert 1986, p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Elsewhere in Polynesia, Hawai{{okina}}i or a cognate is the name of the underworld or of the ancestral home, but in Hawai{{okina}}i, the name has no meaning.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pukui, Elbert, and Mookini 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;

An archipelago situated some {{unit length|mi|2000|-2}} southwest of the North American mainland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://interactive2.er.usgs.gov/faq/list_faq_by_category/get_answer.asp?id=795 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20041021120319/http://interactive2.er.usgs.gov/faq/list_faq_by_category/get_answer.asp?id=795 |archivedate = October 21, 2004 |title = What constitutes the United States, what are the official definitions? |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate = July 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii is the southernmost state of the United States and the second westernmost state after Alaska.  Only Hawaii and Alaska do not share a border with another U.S. state.

Hawaii is the only state of the United States that is not geographically located in North America, grows coffee, is completely surrounded by water, is entirely an [[archipelago]], has royal palaces, and does not have a straight line in its state boundary.

Hawaiiâs tallest mountain, [[Mauna Kea]], stands at {{unit height|ft|13796}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanoes/maunakea/ |title=Mauna Kea Volcano, Hawaii |publisher=Hvo.wr.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; but is taller than [[Mount Everest]] if followed to the base of the mountain, which, lying at the floor of the Pacific Ocean, rises about {{unit height|ft|33500|-2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/2001/BeataUnke.shtml|last=Unke|first=Beata|year=2001|work=The Physics Factbook|title= Height of the Tallest Mountain on Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The eight main islands, Hawai{{okina}}i, Maui, O{{okina}}ahu, Kaho{{okina}}olawe, Lana{{okina}}i, Moloka{{okina}}i, Kaua{{okina}}i and Ni{{okina}}ihau are accompanied by many others. Ka{{okina}}ala is a small island near Ni{{okina}}ihau that is often overlooked. The [[Northwest Hawaiian Islands]] are a series of nine small, older masses northwest of Kaua{{okina}}i that extend from [[Nihoa]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]] that are remnants of once much larger volcanic mountains. There are also more than 100 small rocks and islets, such as [[Molokini]], that are either volcanic, marine sedimentary or erosional in origin, totaling 130 or so across the archipelago.&lt;ref&gt;

===Geology===
All the Hawaiian islands were formed from volcanic activity initiated at an undersea [[igneous rock|magma source]] called a [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]]. As the [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plate]] beneath much of the Pacific Ocean moves to the northwest, the hot spot remains stationary, slowly creating new volcanoes. Due to the hotspotâs location, the only active volcanoes are located around the southern half of the Big Island. The newest volcano, [[Loihi Seamount|LÅ{{okina}}ihi Seamount]], is located south of the Big Islandâs coast.

The last [[Hawaiian eruption|volcanic eruption]] outside the Big Island occurred at [[HaleakalÄ]] on Maui before the late 18th century, though it could have been hundreds of years earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hvo.wr.usgs.gov/volcanowatch/1999/99_09_09.html |title = Youngest lava flows on East Maui probably older than A.D. 1790 |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |date = September 9, 1999 |accessdate = October 4, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1790, KÄ«lauea exploded with the deadliest eruption (of the modern era) known to have occurred in what is now the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/fs074-97/ |title=Living on Active VolcanoesâThe Island of Hawaii, U.S. Geological Survey Fact Sheet 074-97 |publisher=Pubs.usgs.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; As many as 5,405 warriors and their families marching on [[KÄ«lauea]] were killed by that [[1790 Footprints|eruption]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008AGUFM.V11B2022S Human Footprints in Relation to the 1790 Eruption of KÄ«lauea], Swanson, D. A.; Rausch, J., ''American Geophysical Union.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Volcanic activity and subsequent erosion have created impressive geological features. The Big Island has the [[List of islands by highest point|third highest point]] among the worldâs islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldatlas.com/aatlas/infopage/islands.htm |title=Largest islands of the world |publisher=Worldatlas.com |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Slope instability of the volcanoes has generated damaging earthquakes with related [[tsunami]]s, particularly in [[1868 Hawaii earthquake|1868]] and 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;PTWC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/ptwc/hawaii.php|title=Tsunami Safety &amp; Preparedness in Hawai`i|last=Pacific Tsunami Warning Center|date=November 12, 2009|accessdate=November 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flora and fauna===
Because the islands are so far from other land habitats, life before human activity is said to have arrived by the â3 Wâsâ: wind (carried through the air), waves (brought by ocean currents), and wings (birds, insects, and whatever they brought with them). This isolation, and the wide range of environments (extreme altitude, tropical climate) produced a vast array of [[Endemism|endemic]] [[flora]] and [[fauna]] (see [[Endemism in the Hawaiian Islands]]). Hawaii has more endangered species and has lost a higher percentage of its endemic species than any other U.S. state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://nationalzoo.si.edu/Publications/ZooGoer/1995/1/hawaiisforestbirds.cfm| title=Hawaii's Forest Birds Sing the Blues| author=Howard Youth  | accessdate=October 31, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several areas in Hawaii are under the protection of the [[National Park Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hawaii | publisher=National Park Service | accessdate = July 15, 2008 | url = http://www.nps.gov/state/HI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii has two [[national park]]s: [[Haleakala National Park]] near [[Kula, Hawaii|Kula, on Maui]], includes [[HaleakalÄ]], the dormant volcano that formed east Maui; and [[Hawaii Volcanoes National Park]] in the southeast region of the island of Hawai{{okina}}i, which includes the active volcano [[KÄ«lauea]] and its various rift zones.

There are three [[national historical park]]s: [[Kalaupapa National Historical Park]] in Kalaupapa, Moloka{{okina}}i, the site of a former [[Leprosy|Hansenâs disease]] colony; [[Kaloko-Honokohau National Historical Park|Kaloko-HonokÅhau National Historical Park]] in [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]] on the island of Hawai{{okina}}i; and [[Pu'uhonua o Honaunau National Historical Park|Pu{{okina}}uhonua o HÅnaunau National Historical Park]], an ancient place of refuge. Other areas under the control of the National Park Service include [[Ala Kahakai National Historic Trail]] on the Big Island and the [[USS Arizona Memorial|USS ''Arizona'' Memorial]] at [[Pearl Harbor]] on O{{okina}}ahu.

The [[PapahÄnaumokuÄkea Marine National Monument]] was proclaimed by President [[George W. Bush]] on June 15, 2006. The monument covers roughly {{convert|140000|mi2|km2}} of reefs, atolls and shallow and deep sea out to {{convert|50|mi|km|-1}} offshore in the Pacific Ocean, larger than all of Americaâs National Parks combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.pewtrusts.org/ideas/ideas_item.cfm?content_item_id=3417&amp;content_type_id=15&amp;page=15&amp;issue=16&amp;issue_name=Protecting%20ocean%20life&amp;name=Op-eds%20(Pew)| title=Treasure Islands| author=Joshua Reichert and [[Theodore Roosevelt IV]]  | accessdate=June 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
{{See also|List of Hawaii tornadoes|Environment of Hawaii}}
[[File:Sunset in Kona or a real sunset over sea.jpg|thumb|Sunset in [[Kona District, Hawaii|Kona]]. The colors of the sunset are partly due to [[vog]], a form of air pollution that results when [[sulfur dioxide]] and other gases and particles emitted by an erupting [[volcano]] react with [[oxygen]] and moisture in the presence of [[sunlight]].|alt=Photo of sunset]]
Hawaiiâs climate is typical for the tropics, although temperatures and humidity tend to be a bit less extreme due to near-constant [[trade wind]]s from the east. Summer highs are usually in the upper 80s&amp;nbsp;Â°F, (around 31 Â°C) during the day and mid 70s, (around 24&amp;nbsp;Â°C) at night. Winter day temperatures are usually in the low to mid 80s, (around 28&amp;nbsp;Â°C) and (at low elevation) seldom dipping below the mid 60s (18&amp;nbsp;Â°C) at night. Snow, not usually associated with the tropics, falls at {{convert|4205|m}} on [[Mauna Kea]] and [[Mauna Loa]] on the Big Island in some winter months. Snow rarely falls on Haleakala. [[Mount Waialeale|Mount Wai{{okina}}ale{{okina}}ale]], on Kaua{{okina}}i, has the second highest average annual rainfall on Earth, about {{convert|460|in|m|1}}. Most of Hawaii has only two seasons: the dry season from May to October, and the wet season from October to April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prh.noaa.gov/hnl/pages/climate_summary.php |title=Climate of Hawaii |publisher=Prh.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local climates vary considerably on each island, grossly divisible into windward (''Ko{{okina}}olau'') and leeward (''[[Kona low|Kona]]'') areas based upon location relative to the higher mountains. Windward sides face cloud cover, so resorts concentrate on sunny leeward coasts.

==History==
{{Main|History of Hawaii}}
{{HI history}}
Hawaii is one of four states that were independent prior to becoming part of the United States, along with the [[Vermont Republic]] (1791), the [[Republic of Texas]] (1845), and the [[California Republic]] (1846), and one of two, along with Texas, that had formal [[diplomatic recognition]] internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/html/uscode20/usc_sec_20_00007512----000-.html |title=United States Code: Title 20,7512. Findings &amp;#124; LII / Legal Information Institute |publisher=Law.cornell.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kingdom of Hawaii]] was sovereign  from 1810 until 1893 when the monarchy was overthrown by resident American (and some European) businessmen. It was an independent republic from 1894 until 1898, when it was annexed by the United States as a territory, becoming a state in 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netstate.com/states/government/hi_government.htm |title=Hawaii State Government |publisher=Netstate.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii was the target of a surprise [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] by [[Imperial Japan]] on December 7, 1941. The attack on [[Pearl Harbor]] and other military and naval installations on [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], carried out by [[Warplane|aircraft]] and by [[midget submarine]]s, brought the United States into World War II.

===Pre-European contactâAncient Hawai{{okina}}i (800â1778)===
{{Main|Ancient Hawaii}}
The earliest habitation supported by [[archaeological]] evidence dates to as early as 300 CE, probably by [[Polynesia]]n settlers from the [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesas]], followed by a second wave of [[Human migration|migration]] from [[Raiatea]] and [[Bora Bora]] in the 11th century. The first recorded European contact with the islands was in 1778 by British explorer [[James Cook]].

Polynesians from the Marquesas and possibly the Society Islands may have first populated the Hawaiian Islands between 300 and 500 CE. There is a great deal of debate regarding these dates.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
| authorlink = Patrick Vinton Kirch  | coauthors = Colin Renfrew, Clive Gamble  | title = The Evolution of the Polynesian Chiefdoms  | publisher=Cambridge University Press   | year = 1989  | pages = 77â79  | isbn = 0521273161}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some archaeologists and historians believe that an early settlement from the Marquesas and a later wave of immigrants from [[Tahiti]], c. 1000, introduced a new line of high chiefs, the [[Kapu]] system, the practice of [[human sacrifice]] and the building of ''[[heiau]]''s. This later immigration is detailed in [[Hawaiian mythology|folk tales]] about [[Pa'ao|Pa{{okina}}ao]]. Other authors argue that there is no archaeological or linguistic evidence for a later influx of Tahitian settlers, and that Pa{{okina}}ao must be regarded as a myth.

[[File:King Kalaniopuu Greeting Cook 1781.png|thumb|upright|[[KalaniÊ»ÅpuÊ»u]], King of Hawaii bringing presents to Captain [[James Cook|Cook]]. Illustrated by [[John Webber]], artist aboard Cook's ship.|alt=Drawing of single-masted sailboat with one spinnaker-shaped sail, carrying dozens of men]]

Regardless of the question of Pa{{okina}}ao, historians agree that the history of the islands was marked by a slow but steady growth in population and the size of the chiefdoms, which grew to encompass whole islands. Local chiefs, called [[Ali'i|ali{{okina}}i]], ruled their settlements and launched wars to extend their sway and defend their communities from predatory rivals.

===James CookâEuropean arrival and the Kingdom of Hawaii (1778â1893)===
The 1778 arrival of British explorer [[James Cook]] was Hawaiiâs first documented contact with [[European ethnic groups|European]] [[List of explorers|explorers]]. Cook named the islands the &quot;Sandwich Islands&quot; in honor of his sponsor [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich]]. He published the islands' location and reported the [[Hawaiian language#Name|native name]] as ''Owyhee''. This spelling lives on in [[Owyhee County, Idaho]], after three Hawaiian members of a trapping party killed in that area.

Cook visited the islands twice. During his second visit in 1779, he attempted to abduct the [[Alii Aimoku of Hawaii|King of the Big Island of Hawaii]], [[Kalaniopu`u|Kalani{{okina}}Åpu{{okina}}u]], and hold him as ransom for the return of a ship's boat that was taken by a minor chief and his men, a tactic that had worked for Cook in Tahiti and other islands.&lt;ref&gt;Kuykendall, &quot;The Hawaiian Kingdom Volume I: Foundation and Transformation&quot;, p18 &quot;Cook's plan was to get the king on board the Resolution and keep him there until the stolen boat was returnedâa plan that had been effective under similar circumstances in the south Pacific&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Kalani{{okina}}Åpu{{okina}}u and his supporters fought back and Cook and four Marines were killed as Cook's party retreated to the beach and launched their boats.

After Cook's visit and the publication of several books relating his voyages, the Hawaiian islands received many European visitors: explorers, traders, and eventually whalers who found the islands a convenient harbor and source of supplies. Early British influence can be seen in the design of the [[flag of Hawaii]] which has the British [[Union Flag]] in the corner.

These visitors introduced diseases to the once-isolated islands and the Hawaiian population plunged precipitously&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/257332/Hawaii |title=Hawaii (state, United States) |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; because native Hawaiians had no resistance to [[influenza]], [[smallpox]], and [[measles]], among others. During the 1850s, measles killed a fifth of Hawaii's people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/database/article_display.cfm?HHID=422 Migration and Disease]. ''Digital History.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Historical records indicated that the earliest immigration of the Chinese came from Guangdong province: a few sailors in 1778 with Captain Cook's journey, more in 1788 with Kaina, and some in 1789 with an American trader who settled in Hawaii in the late 18th century.

====House of Kamehameha====
[[File:Entrevue de l'expedition de M. Kotzebue avec le roi Tammeamea dans l'ile d'Ovayhi, Iles Sandwich (detailed).jpg|thumb|210px|King Kamehameha receiving [[Otto von Kotzebue]]'s Russian naval expedition. Drawing by [[Louis Choris]] in 1816.]]
During the 1780s and 1790s, chiefs were often fighting for power. After a series of battles that ended in 1795 and forced cession of the island of Kaua{{okina}}i in 1810, all inhabited islands were subjugated under a single ruler who became known as [[Kamehameha I|King Kamehameha the Great]]. He established the [[House of Kamehameha]], a dynasty that ruled the kingdom until 1872.

After [[Kamehameha II]] inherited the throne in 1819, [[List of Missionaries to Hawaii|American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii]] converted many Hawaiians to Christianity. Their influence ended many ancient practices, and [[Kamehameha III]] was the first Christian king. One prominent Protestant missionary, [[Hiram Bingham I]], was a trusted adviser to the monarchy during this period. Other missionaries and their descendants became active in commercial and political affairs, leading to future conflicts between the monarchy and its restive American subjects.

Missionaries from other Christian denominations (such as Catholics, Mormons, and Episcopalians) were active, but never converted more than a minority of the Native Hawaiian population.

The death of the bachelor [[Kamehameha V|King Kamehameha V]]âwho did not name an heirâresulted in the popular election of [[Lunalilo]] over [[KalÄkaua]]. Lunalilo died the next year, also without naming an heir. Perhaps &quot;the People's King&quot; (Lunalilo) wanted the people to choose his successor as they had chosen him. In 1874 the election was contested within the legislature between KalÄkaua and Emma. This led to riots and the landing of U.S. and British troops, and governance passed to the [[House of KalÄkaua]].

====1887 Constitution====
In 1887, [[KalÄkaua]] was forced to sign the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]], which stripped the king of much of his authority. There was a property qualification for voting, which disenfranchised many poorer Hawaiians and favored the wealthier white community. Resident whites were allowed to vote, but resident [[Asian people|Asians]] were excluded. Because the 1887 Constitution was signed under threat of violence, it is known as the &quot;Bayonet Constitution&quot;. King KalÄkaua, reduced to a figurehead, reigned until his death in 1891. His sister, [[Liliuokalani|Lili{{okina}}uokalani]], succeeded him on the throne.

[[File:Ustroopshawaiirevolution.jpg|thumb|Ship's landing force at the time of the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy, January 1893.|alt=row of men with rifles]]

In 1893, Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani announced plans for a new constitution. On January 14, 1893, a group of mostly Euro-American business leaders and residents formed a [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] to [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow the Kingdom]] and seek annexation by the United States. United States Government Minister [[John L. Stevens]], responding to a request from the Committee of Safety, summoned a [[Company (military unit)|company]] of U.S. Marines. As one historian noted, the presence of these troops effectively made it impossible for the monarchy to protect itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Russ | first = William Adam | title = The Hawaiian Revolution (1893â94) | publisher=Associated University Presses | year = 1992 | page = 350 | isbn = 0945636431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Overthrow of 1893âthe Republic of Hawaii (1894â1898)===
In January 1893, Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani was overthrown and replaced by a Provisional Government composed of members of the Committee of Safety. Controversy filled the following years as the queen tried to re-establish her throne. The administration of President [[Grover Cleveland]] commissioned the [[Blount Report]], which concluded that the removal of Lili{{okina}}uokalani was illegal. The U.S. government first demanded that Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani be reinstated, but the Provisional Government refused. Congress followed with another investigation, and submitted the [[Morgan Report]] on February 26, 1894, which found all parties (including Minister Stevens) with the exception of the queen &quot;not guilty&quot; from any responsibility for the overthrow.&lt;ref&gt;Kuykendall, R.S. (1967) The Hawaiian Kingdom, 1874â1893. Honolulu: University of Hawaii Press. p. 648.&lt;/ref&gt; The accuracy and impartiality of both the Blount and Morgan reports has been questioned by partisans on both sides of the debate over the events of 1893.&lt;ref name=&quot;Adam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Kinzer | first = Stephen | title = Overthrow: America's Century of Regime Change From Hawaii to Iraq | publisher=Times Books | year = 2006 | isbn = 0805078614 | unused_data = ISBN status = May be invalidâplease double check }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mediamatters.org/items/200508220002 |publisher=Media Matters |title= Limbaugh repeated false claim that U.S. was &quot;strictly neutral&quot; in overthrow of Hawaiian queen }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;ikdfuf&quot;&gt;[http://www.hawaiireporter.com/file.aspx?Guid=aefef5f6-a533-486a-9459-691138355dd1 Hawaii Divided Against Itself Cannot Stand]{{dead link|date=November 2010}} by Bruce Fein&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, a joint [[Apology Resolution]] regarding the overthrow was passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton, apologizing for the overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom.&lt;ref name = &quot;ikdfuf&quot;/&gt; It is the first time in American history that the United States government has apologized for overthrowing the government of a sovereign nation.

[[File:Iolani Palace (1328).JPG|thumb|[[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]] in [[Honolulu]], formerly the residence of the Hawaiian monarch, was the capitol of the Republic of Hawaii.]]
The [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] ended on July 4, 1894, replaced by the [[Republic of Hawaii]].

The first Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii in 1885 as contract laborers for the sugar cane and pineapple plantations. Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii began when Puerto Rico's sugar industry was devastated by two hurricanes in 1899. The devastation caused a world-wide shortage of sugar and a huge demand for the product from Hawaii. Hawaiian sugar plantation owners began to recruit the jobless, but experienced, laborers in Puerto Rico. Two distinct waves of Korean immigration to Hawaii have occurred in the last century. The first arrived in between 1903 and 1924; the second wave began in 1965.

===Annexationâthe Territory of Hawaii (1898â1959)===
After [[William McKinley]] won the presidential election in 1896, Hawaii's annexation to the U.S. was again discussed. The previous president, [[Grover Cleveland]], was a friend of Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani. McKinley was open to persuasion by U.S. expansionists and by annexationists from Hawaii. He met with three annexationists from Hawaii: [[Lorrin A. Thurston|Lorrin Thurston]], Francis March Hatch and [[William Ansel Kinney]]. After negotiations, in June 1897,  Secretary of State [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] agreed to a treaty of annexation with these representatives of the Republic of Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |work=The [[Morgan Report]]  |url= http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=1897_Annexation_Treaty |title= 1897 Hawaii Annexation Treaty |accessdate= August 14, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty was never ratified by the [[U.S. Senate]].
Instead, the [[Newlands Resolution]] by both houses of [[United States Congress|Congress]] annexed the Republic to the United States and it became the [[Territory of Hawaii]]. Despite some opposition in the islands, the Newlands Resolution was passed by the House June 15, 1898, by a vote of 209 to 91, and by the Senate on July 6, 1898, by a vote of 42 to 21.
[[Image:US Shaw exploding in Pearl Harbor.jpg|thumb|USS ''Shaw'' exploding during the Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] 7 December 1941]]
In 1900, Hawaii was granted self-governance and retained [[Iolani Palace|{{okina}}Iolani Palace]] as the territorial capitol building. Despite several attempts to become a state, Hawaii remained a territory for sixty years. Plantation owners and key capitalists, who maintained control through financial institutions, or &quot;factors,&quot; known as the &quot;[[Big Five (Hawaii)|Big Five]]&quot;, found territorial status convenient, enabling them to continue importing cheap foreign labor; such immigration was prohibited in various states.

===Political Changes of 1954âthe State of Hawaii (1959âpresent)===
{{Main| Democratic Revolution of 1954 (Hawaii)}}

In the 1950s the power of the plantation owners was finally broken by descendants of immigrant laborers. Because they were born in a U.S. territory, they were legal U.S. citizens. The [[Hawaii Republican Party]], strongly supported by plantation owners, was voted out of office. The [[Democratic Party of Hawaii]] dominated politics for 40 years. Expecting to gain full voting rights, Hawaii's residents actively campaigned for statehood.

In March 1959, Congress passed the [[Hawaii Admission Act]] and U.S. President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] signed it into law. (The act excluded [[Palmyra Atoll]], part of the Kingdom and Territory of Hawaii, from the new state.) On June 27 of that year, a referendum asked residents of Hawaii to vote on the statehood bill. Hawaii voted 17 to 1 to accept. The choices were to accept the Act or to remain a territory, without the option of independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moolelo.com/human-rights.html |title=Human Rights differs from Equal Rights |publisher=Moolelo.com |date=2005-01-21 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hawaii-nation.org/pleb.html |title=Support For The Hawaiian Sovereignty Elections Council |publisher=Hawaii-nation.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiireporter.com/story.aspx?e1cfcf02-afc2-4aa8-b0cb-3514c3b81da4 Hawaii Reporter: Hawaii Reporter&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations [[Special Committee on Decolonization]] later removed Hawaii from the [[United Nations list of Non-Self-Governing Territories]].

After statehood, Hawaii quickly modernized via construction and a rapidly growing tourism economy. Later, state programs promoted Hawaiian culture. The [[1978 Hawaii State Constitutional Convention|Hawaii State Constitutional Convention of 1978]] incorporated programs such as the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]] to promote indigenous language and culture.

==Cities and towns==
[[File:Downtown Honolulu.jpg|thumb|[[Honolulu]] is the largest city and capital of Hawaii.|alt=downtown Honolulu showing a cluster of 10â30 story buildings]]

The movement of the Hawaiian royal family from the Big Island to Maui, and subsequently to O{{okina}}ahu, explains why population centers exist where they do today. [[Kamehameha III]] chose the largest city, [[Honolulu]], as his capital because of its natural harbor, the present-day [[Honolulu Harbor]].

Now the state capital, Honolulu is located along the southeast coast of O{{okina}}ahu. The previous capital was [[Lahaina, Hawaii|Lahaina]], Maui, and before that [[Kailua-Kona]], Hawaii. Some major towns are [[Hilo, Hawaii|Hilo]]; [[KÄne'ohe, Hawai'i|KÄne{{okina}}ohe]]; [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua]]; [[Pearl City, Hawaii|Pearl City]]; [[Waipahu, Hawaii|Waipahu]]; [[Kahului, Hawaii|Kahului]]; [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua-Kona]].

As of 2005, Hawaii has an estimated population of 1,275,194, an increase of 13,070, or 1.0%, from the prior year and an increase of 63,657, or 5.3%, since 2000. This includes a natural increase of 48,111 people (that is 96,028 births minus 47,917 deaths) and an increase due to net migration of 16,956 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,068 people, and migration within the country produced a net loss of 13,112 people. The center of population of Hawaii is located between the two islands of O{{okina}}ahu and Moloka{{okina}}i.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Population and Population Centers by State&amp;nbsp;â 2000 | publisher=United States Census Bureau | accessdate = December 4, 2008 | url = http://www.census.gov/geo/www/cenpop/statecenters.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii has a ''de facto'' population of over 1.3&amp;nbsp;million, due to large military and tourist populations. O{{okina}}ahu, nicknamed &quot;The Gathering Place&quot;, is the most populous island (and has the highest population density), with a resident population of just under one million in {{convert|597|sqmi|km2|0}}, about 1,650 people per square mile (for comparison, New Jersey, which has 8,717,925 people in {{convert|7417|sqmi|km2|0}} is the most-densely populated state with 1,134 people per square mile.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/34000.html |title=New Jersey Quickfacts |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawaii's 1,275,194 people, spread over {{convert|6423|mi2}} (including many unpopulated islands), results in an average population density of 188.6 persons per square mile,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/15000.html |title=Hawaii Quickfacts |publisher=Quickfacts.census.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes Hawaii less densely populated than Ohio and Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cesla.med.ucla.edu/html/pdf/charts.pdf#search=%22new%20jersey%20population%20density%22 Top 12 states in population density]{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The average projected lifespan of those born in Hawaii in 2000 was 79.8 years (77.1 years if male, 82.5 if female), longer than any other state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.census.gov/population/projections/MethTab2.xls |title=Average life expectancy at birth by state |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. military personnel make up approximately 1.3% of the population in the islands.

===Race and ethnicity===
{{See|Europeans in Oceania}}{{See also|Africans in Hawaii}}
According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Hawaii had a population of 1,360,301. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 24.7% White (22.7% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 1.6% Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 38.6% Asian, 10.0% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 1.2% from Some Other race, and 23.6% from Two or More Races. Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 8.9% of the population.
[[File:Early Japanese immigrants to Hawaii.jpg|thumb|Early Japanese immigrants to Hawaii]]
Hawaii is demographically unique because it has the highest percentage of Asian Americans and Multiracial Americans, as well as the lowest percentage of White Americans. Hawaii's Asian population mainly consists of 198,000 (14.6%) [[Filipino American]]s and 185,000 (13.6%) [[Japanese American]]s. In addition, there are roughly 55,000 (4.0%) Chinese Americans and 24,000 (1.8%) [[Korean American]]s. [[Native Hawaiians|Indigenous Hawaiians]] number over 80,000, which is 5.9% of the population. Over 120,000 (8.8%) Hispanic and Latino Americans make Hawaii their home. [[Mexican American|Mexicans]] number over 35,000 (2.6%); [[Puerto Ricans in the United States|Puerto Ricans]] exceed 44,000 (3.2%). Multiracial Americans form almost one-quarter of Hawaii's population, exceeding 320,000 people. [[Eurasian American]]s are a prominent mixed-race group; there are roughly 66,000 (4.9%) Eurasian Americans in Hawaii. The Non-Hispanic White population numbers at 310,000 and forms just over one-fifth of the population. The multiracial population outnumbers the non-Hispanic white population by about 10,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt;

The five largest [[Maps of American ancestries|European ancestries]] in Hawaii are [[German American|German]] (7.4%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (5.2%), [[English American|English]] (4.6%), [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] (4.3%), and [[Italian American|Italian]] (2.7%).

Approximately 82.2% of Hawaii's residents were born in the United States. Roughly 75.0% of the foreign-born residents hail from Asia.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|author=American FactFinder, United States Census Bureau |url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/ADPTable?_bm=y&amp;-geo_id=04000US15&amp;-qr_name=ACS_2008_1YR_G00_DP2&amp;-context=adp&amp;-ds_name=&amp;-tree_id=308&amp;-_lang=en&amp;-redoLog=true&amp;-format= |title=Hawaii â Selected Social Characteristics in the United States: 2008 |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaii is a [[majority-minority state]]. Non-Hispanic whites do not form a majority. Hawaii was the second majority-minority state. Both Hawaii and [[New Mexico]] have been majority-minority since the early 20th century.

The largest [[Maps of American ancestries|ancestry groups]] in Hawaii as of 2008 are in the table at right.
The third group of foreigners to arrive upon Hawaii's shores, after those from Polynesia and [[white people|Europe]], was from [[Han Chinese|Han China]]. Chinese workers on Western trading ships settled in Hawaii starting in 1789. In 1820 the first American missionaries came to preach Christianity and teach the Hawaiians Western ways. They were instrumental in convincing the Hawaiian Chiefs to end human sacrifice.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

A large proportion of Hawaii's population is now of Asian ancestry (especially [[Chinese American|Chinese]], [[Japanese American|Japanese]] and [[Filipino American|Filipino]].) Many are descendants of those immigrants brought to work on the sugar plantations in the 1850s and after. The first 153 Japanese immigrants arrived in Hawaii on June 19, 1868. They were not &quot;legally&quot; approved by the Japanese government because the contract was between a broker and the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], by then replaced by the [[Meiji Restoration]]. The first Japanese government-approved immigrants arrived on February 9, 1885 after KalÄkaua's petition to [[Emperor Meiji]] when KalÄkaua visited Japan in 1881.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Almost 13,000 [[Portuguese American|Portuguese]] had come by 1899. They too worked on the sugar plantations. By October 17, 1901, 5,000 [[Puerto Rican immigration to Hawaii|Puerto Ricans]] had made new homes on the four islands.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}}

===Languages===
The State of Hawaii has two official languages recognized in its 1978 constitution: English and [[Hawaiian language|Hawaiian]]. Article XV, Section 4, specifies that &quot;Hawaiian shall be required for public acts and transactions ''only as provided by law''&quot; [italic added]. [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawaii Creole English]] (locally referred to as 'Pidgin') is the native language of many born-and-raised residents and is a second language for many other residents.

====English====
As of the 2000 Census, 73.44% of Hawaii residents age 5 and older speak only English at home.&lt;ref name=mla&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/map_data_results&amp;state_id=15&amp;mode=state_tops |title=Language Map Data Center |publisher=Mla.org |date=2007-07-17 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2008 American Community Survey, 74.6% of Hawaii's residents over the age of five speak only English at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder.census.gov&quot;/&gt;

====Minority languages====
In addition, 2.6% of the state's residents speak Spanish; 1.6% speak other [[Indo-European language]]s; 21.0% speak an [[Languages of Asia|Asian language]]; and 0.2% speak a different language at home.&lt;ref name=&quot;factfinder.census.gov&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Portuguese immigrant family in Hawaii during the 19th century.jpg|thumb|170px|Portuguese immigrant family in Hawaii during the 19th century.]]
After English, other popular languages are [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] (most are bilingual in [[Filipino language|Filipino]]), Japanese, and [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]]. Significant [[European ethnic groups|European]] immigrants and descendants also speak their native languages; the most numerous are Spanish, German, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] and French.

Tagalog speakers make up 5.37% (which includes non-native speakers of [[Filipino language]], the national co-official Tagalog-based language), followed by Japanese at 4.96%, [[Ilokano language|Ilokano]] at 4.05%, Chinese at 1.92%, Hawaiian at 1.68%, Spanish at 1.66%, [[Korean language|Korean]] at 1.61%, and [[Samoan language|Samoan]] at 1.01%.&lt;ref name=mla/&gt;

====Hawaiian====
{{Main|Hawaiian language}}
The [[Hawaiian language]] has about 2000 native speakers, less than 0.1% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;Lyovin, Anatole V. (1997). ''An Introduction to the Languages of the World'', p. 258. New York: Oxford University Press, Inc. ISBN 0-19-508116-1.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[United States Census]], there were 27,160 total speakers of the language in Hawaii in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Census|year=2005|url=http://www.census.gov/Press-Release/www/releases/archives/facts_for_features_special_editions/004522.html |title=U.S. Census Press Releases}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}. [[Public Information Offce]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawaiian is a Polynesian member of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Lyovin|1997|pp=257â258}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is closely related to other [[Polynesian languages]], such as [[Marquesan language|Marquesan]], [[Tahitian language|Tahitian]], [[MÄori language|MÄori]], [[Rapa Nui language|Rapa Nui]] (the language of [[Easter Island]]), and less closely to [[Samoan language|Samoan]], and  [[Tongan language|Tongan]].

According to SchÃ¼tz (1994), the Marquesans colonized the archipelago in roughly 300 AD&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|SchÃ¼tz|1994|pp=334â336; 338 ''20n''}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by later waves of immigration from the [[Society Islands]] and [[Samoa]]-[[Tonga]].
Those [[Hawaiian language#Family and origin|Polynesians]] remained in the islands, thereby becoming the Hawaiian people. Their languages, over time, became the Hawaiian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Elbert|Pukui|1979|pp=35â36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kimura and Wilson (1983) also state, &quot;Linguists agree that Hawaiian is closely related to Eastern Polynesian, with a particularly strong link in the Southern Marquesas, and a secondary link in Tahiti, which may be explained by voyaging between the Hawaiian and Society Islands.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Kimura|Wilson|1983|p=185}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the arrival of Captain James Cook, the Hawaiian language had no written form. That form was developed mainly by American Protestant [[missionary|missionaries]] during 1820â1826. They assigned letters from the Latin alphabet that corresponded to the Hawaiian sounds.

Interest in Hawaiian increased significantly in the late 20th century. With the help of the [[Office of Hawaiian Affairs]], specially designated immersion schools were established where all subjects would be taught in Hawaiian. Also, the [[University of Hawaii System|University of Hawaii]] developed a Hawaiian language graduate studies program. Municipal codes were altered to favor Hawaiian place and street names for new civic developments.

Hawaiian distinguishes between long and short vowels. In modern practice, vowel length is indicated with a [[macron]] ([[Hawaiian language#Orthography (writing system)|''kahakÅ'']]).  Also, Hawaiian uses the [[glottal stop]] as a consonant ([[Okina|''{{okina}}okina'']]). It is written as a symbol similar to the apostrophe or opening single quote.

Hawaiian-language newspapers published from 1834â1948 and traditional native speakers of Hawaiian generally omit the marks in their own writing. The {{okina}}okina and kahakÅ are intended to help non-native speakers.

====Hawaiian Pidgin====
{{Main|Hawaiian Pidgin}}
Some locals speak [[Hawaiian Pidgin|Hawaii Creole English]] (HCE), often called &quot;[[pidgin]]&quot;. The lexicon of HCE derives mainly from English but also has words from Hawaiian, Chinese, Japanese, Portuguese, [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. During the 19th century, the increase in immigration (mainly from China, Japan, Portugalâand especially from the Azores archipelagoâand Spain), caused a variant of English to develop. By the early 20th century pidgin speakers had children who acquired the pidgin as their first language. HCE speakers use some Hawaiian words without those words being considered archaic. Most place names are retained from Hawaiian, as are some names for plants or animals. For example, [[tuna fish]] are often called ''ahi''.

[[File:International Mkt Place, Hawaii, 1958.JPG|thumb|International Market Place, Honolulu, 1958.]]
HCE speakers have modified the meanings of certain English words. For example, &quot;aunty&quot; and &quot;uncle&quot; refer to any adult who is a friend, or to show respect for an elder. Simplified grammar is used. For example, instead of &quot;It is hot today, isn't it?&quot;, an HCE speaker would say simply &quot;stay hot, eh?&quot; When a word does not come to mind quickly, the term &quot;[[da kine]]&quot; refers to any word you cannot think of. Through the [[surfing]] boom in Hawaii, HCE has influenced surfer slang. Some HCE expressions, such as ''brah'' and ''da kine'', have found their way to other places.

====Spelling of state name====
A somewhat divisive political issue arose when the constitution of the State of Hawaii added Hawaiian as a second official state language: the exact spelling of the state's name, which in the islands' language is ''Hawai'i'' (the apostrophe marking a Hawaiian consonant, a [[glottal stop|cut-off of breath]] before the final i). In the [[Hawaii Admission Act]] that granted Hawaiian statehood, the federal government recognized ''Hawaii'' to be the official state name.  Official government publications,  as well as department and office titles, use the traditional Hawaiian spelling, with no symbols for glottal stops or vowel length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wowpolynesia.com/hawaiian-language/ |title=Hawaiian language |publisher=Wow Polynesia |date=December 2, 2009 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, some private entities, including a local newspaper, do use such symbols.

The title of the state constitution is &quot;The Constitution of the State of Hawaii&quot;. In Article XV, Section 1 uses &quot;The State of Hawaii&quot;, Section 2 &quot;the island of Oahu&quot;, Section 3 &quot;The Hawaiian flag&quot;, and Section 5 specifies the state motto as &quot;Ua mau ke ea o ka aina i ka pono&quot;. Since these documents predate the modern use of the [[Ê»Okina|{{okina}}okina]] and the [[Macron|kahakÅ]] in Hawaiian orthography, the diacritics were not used.

The nuances in the Hawaiian language debate are often not obvious or appreciated among English speakers outside Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://joezarroli.com/agent/additionalpage_p.php?username=zarroliprops&amp;pageno=7 |title=Ocean City â Somers Point â North Wildwood â Wildwood â Wildwood Crest Real Estate for Sale |publisher=Joezarroli.com |date=August 17, 2005 |accessdate=April 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Makiki Christian Church, Honolulu.jpg|thumb|right|A church in Hawaii, 1958]]

The largest denominations by number of adherents were the Catholic Church with 240,813 in 2000&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/15_2000.asp|title=State Membership Reports |accessdate=June 15, 2010 |work=thearda.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] with 68,128 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/statistical-information|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080730060850/http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/statistical-information|archivedate=July 30, 2008 |title=LDS Newsroom Statistical Information |publisher=Newsroom.lds.org |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to data provided by religious establishments, religion in Hawaii in 2000 was distributed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.gov/dbedt/info/economic/databook/db2000 |title=State of Hawaii Data Book 2000, Section 1 Population, Table 1.47 |publisher=Hawaii.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glenmary.org/grc Glenmary Research Center]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Sep/21/il/il11afaith.html |title=Survey shows partial picture |publisher=The Honolulu Advertiser |date=2002-09-21 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Christianity: 351,000 (28.9%)
* [[Buddhism]]: 110,000 (9%)
* Judaism: 10,000 (0.8%)
* Other: 100,000 (10%)*
* Unaffiliated: 650,000 (51.1%)**

&quot;Other&quot; are religions other than Christianity, [[Buddhism]], or Judaism; this group includes [[BahÃ¡'Ã­ Faith]], [[Confucianism]], [[Daoism]], the [[Hawaiian religion]], [[Hinduism]], [[Islam]], [[Sikhism]], [[Shintoism]], [[Zoroastrianism]], and other religions.

&quot;Unaffiliated&quot; refers to people who do not belong to a congregation; this group includes agnostics, [[atheism|atheists]], [[humanism|humanists]], and the [[Irreligion|irreligious]].

A 2009 [[Gallup poll]] found religion was distributed as follows, excluding those of other non-Judeo-Christian religions and those who had &quot;no opinion&quot;:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/122075/Religious-Identity-States-Differ-Widely.aspx#2 |title=Religious Identity: States Differ Widely |publisher=Gallup.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Protestantism|Protestant]]/Other Christian: 37.8%
* Roman Catholic: 22.8%
* [[Mormonism]]: 3.3%
* Judaism: 0.7%
* [[Irreligion|Irreligious]], Agnostic, [[Atheism|Atheist]]: 21.0%

A special case is [[Ho'oponopono|Ho{{okina}}oponopono]], an ancient Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness, combined with prayer. It is both philosophy and way of life. Traditionally ho{{okina}}oponopono is practiced by healing priests or ''[[kahuna]] lapa{{okina}}au'' among family members of a person who is physically ill.

==Economy==
{{See also|Hawaii locations by per capita income}}
[[File:Dockhawaii.jpg|thumb|left|235px|A shipping dock in Hawaii]]

The history of Hawaii can be traced through a succession of dominant [[industry|industries]]: [[sandalwood]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&amp;PageID=274 |title=Hawaii sandalwood trade |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[whaling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaiihistory.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=ig.page&amp;PageID=287 |title=Whaling in Hawaii |publisher=Hawaiihistory.org |date=1999-06-16 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[sugarcane]] (see [[Sugar plantations in Hawaii]]), [[pineapple]], military, tourism, and education. Since statehood in 1959, tourism has been the largest industry, contributing 24.3% of the Gross State Product (GSP) in 1997, despite efforts to diversify. The gross output for the state in 2003 was US$47&amp;nbsp;billion; per capita income for Hawaii residents was US$30,441.

Hawaiian exports include food and apparel. These industries play a small role in the Hawaiian economy, however, due to the considerable shipping distance to viable markets, such as the West Coast of the United States. Food exports include coffee (see [[coffee production in Hawaii]]), [[macadamia]] nuts, [[pineapple]], livestock, and [[sugarcane]]. Agricultural sales for 2002, according to the Hawaii Agricultural Statistics Service, were US$370.9&amp;nbsp;million from diversified agriculture, US$100.6&amp;nbsp;million from pineapple, and US$64.3&amp;nbsp;million from sugarcane.

Hawaii has a relatively high state tax burden. In 2003, Hawaii residents had the highest state tax per capita at US$2,838. This is partly because education, health care and social services are all provided directly by the state, as opposed to local government in all other states.

Millions of tourists contribute to the tax take by paying the [[excise|general excise tax]] and hotel room tax; thus not all taxes come directly from residents. Business leaders, however, consider the state's tax burden too high, contributing to both higher prices and the perception of an unfriendly business climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://starbulletin.com/2004/05/21/news/story1.html |title=Honolulu Star-Bulletin Hawaii News |publisher=Starbulletin.com |date=2006-11-30 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; See the [[:Category:Business in Hawaii|list of businesses in Hawaii]] for more on commerce.

Hawaii was one of the few states to control gasoline prices through a [[Gas Cap Law]]. Since oil company profits in Hawaii compared to the mainland U.S. were under scrutiny, the law tied local gasoline prices to those of the mainland. It took effect in September 2005 amid price fluctuations caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], but was suspended in April 2006.

As of January 2010, the state's unemployment rate was 6.9%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the United States military spent $12.2&amp;nbsp;billion in Hawaii, accounting for 18% of spending in the state for that year.  75,000 United States Department of Defense personnel reside in Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], &quot;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/06/ap-military-spending-strong-in-hawaii-060111/ Study: Military spent $12B in Hawaii in 2009]&quot;, ''[[Military Times]]'', June 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cost of living===
The cost of living in Hawaii, specifically [[Honolulu]], is quite high compared to most major cities in the United States. However, the cost of living in Honolulu is 6.7% lower than in New York, NY and 3.6% lower than in San Francisco, CA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://salary.nytimes.com/costoflivingwizard/layoutscripts/coll_start.asp  Cost of Living Wizard] on The New York Times website&lt;/ref&gt; These numbers may not take into account certain costs, such as increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers &quot;outside the continental United States&quot;. While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Hawaii,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freeshipping.org/category/hawaii-free-shipping-coupons/ FreeShipping.org] for examples of stores that ship free to Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt; many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and certain other US territories.

The median home value in Hawaii in the 2000 US Census was $272,700 while the national median home value was less than half, at $119,600. Hawaii home values were the highest of all states, including California with a median home value of $211,500.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/hhes/www/housing/census/historic/values.html Historic Housing Values] on www.census.gov&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research from the [[National Association of Realtors]]Â® places the 2010 median sale price of a single family home in Honolulu, Hawaii at $607,600 and the US median sales price at $173,200. The sale price of single family homes in Hawaii was the highest of any US city in 2010, just above the &quot;Silicon Valley&quot; area of California ($602,000).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realtor.org/research/research/metroprice |title=Metropolitan Median Prices |publisher=Realtor.org |date=2005-02-15 |accessdate=2011-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

The [[indigenous peoples|aboriginal]] culture of Hawaii is [[Polynesia]]n. Hawaii represents the northernmost extension of the vast Polynesian triangle of the south and central Pacific Ocean. While traditional Hawaiian culture remains only as vestiges in modern Hawaiian society, there are reenactments of the ceremonies and traditions throughout the islands. Some of these cultural influences are strong enough to affect the United States at large, including the popularity (in greatly modified form) of [[luau]]s and [[hula]].

==Health==
{{Main|Hawaii Prepaid Health Care Act}}
Hawaii's health care system insures 92% (2009) of residents. Under the state's plan, businesses are required to provide insurance to employees who work more than twenty hours per week. Heavy regulation of insurance companies helps keep the cost to employers down. Due in part to heavy emphasis on preventive care, Hawaiians require hospital treatment less frequently than the rest of the United States, while total health care expenses (measured as a percentage of state GDP) are substantially lower. Given these achievements, proponents of [[universal health care]] elsewhere in the U.S. sometimes use Hawaii as a model for proposed federal and state health care plans.

==Education==
===Public schools===
{{Main|Hawai'i Department of Education}}
Hawaii has the U.S.' only school system that is unified statewide. Policy decisions are made by the fourteen-member state [[Hawaii Board of Education|Board of Education]]. The Board sets policy and hires the superintendent of schools, who oversees the state [[Hawaii Department of Education|Department of Education]]. The Department of Education is divided into seven districts, four on O{{okina}}ahu and one for each of the three other counties.

The main rationale for centralization is to combat inequalities between highly populated O{{okina}}ahu and the more rural Neighbor Islands, and between lower-income and more affluent areas. In most of the United States, schools are funded from local property taxes.

Educators struggle with children of non-native-English-speaking immigrants, whose cultures are different from those of the mainland (where most course materials and testing standards originate).

Public elementary, middle, and high school test scores in Hawaii are below national averages on tests mandated under the [[No Child Left Behind Act]]. Some of the gap has been attributed to the Hawaii Board of Education's requirement that all eligible students take these tests and report all student test scores (other states, Texas and Michigan for example, do not). Results reported in August, 2005, indicate that of 282 schools across the state, 185 (2/3) failed to reach federal minimum performance standards in math and reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=POSTED: 5:58&amp;nbsp;pm HST August 18, 2005 |url=http://www.thehawaiichannel.com/education/4870699/detail.html |title=Two-Thirds Of Hawaii Schools Do Not Meet Requirements â Education News Story â KITV Honolulu |publisher=Thehawaiichannel.com |date=August 18, 2005 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the [[ACT (examination)|ACT college placement tests]] show that in 2005, seniors scored slightly above the national average (21.9 compared with 20.9).&lt;ref&gt;Honolulu Advertiser, August 17, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;B1&lt;/ref&gt; In the widely accepted [[SAT]] examinations, Hawaii's college-bound seniors tend to score below the national average in all categories except mathematics.

===Other schools===
Hawaii educates more students in independent institutions of secondary education than any other state in the United States.{{dubious|date=July 2011}} It has four of the largest independent schools: [[Iolani School|{{okina}}Iolani School]], [[Kamehameha Schools]], [[Mid-Pacific Institute]], and [[Punahou School]]. The second Buddhist high school in the United States, and first Buddhist high school in Hawaii, Pacific Buddhist Academy, was founded in 2003. The first native controlled public charter school was the [[Kanu O Ka Aina New Century Charter School]].

Independent and charter schools can select their students, while the regular public schools must take all students in their district. The Kamehameha Schools are the only schools in the United States that openly grant admission to students based on ancestry, and the wealthiest schools in the United States, if not the world, having over nine billion [[US dollars]] in estate assets. In 2005, Kamehameha enrolled 5,398 students, 8.4% of the Native Hawaiian children in the state.&lt;ref&gt;

Graduates of secondary schools in Hawaii often enter directly into the work force. Some attend colleges and universities on the mainland or other countries, and the rest attend an institution of higher learning in Hawaii.

The largest is the [[University of Hawaii]] System. It consists of: the research university at [[University of Hawaii at Manoa|MÄnoa]]; two comprehensive campuses [[University of Hawaii at Hilo|Hilo]] and [[University of Hawaii-West Oahu|West O{{okina}}ahu]]; and seven Community Colleges. Private universities include [[Brigham Young UniversityâHawaii]], [[Chaminade University of Honolulu]], [[Hawaii Pacific University]], [[Wayland Baptist University]], or [[University of the Nations]].  The [[Saint Stephen Diocesan Seminary, Honolulu|Saint Stephen Diocesan Center]] is a [[seminary]] of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Honolulu]].

{{See also|Politics of Hawaii|Political party strength in Hawaii}}
The state government of Hawaii is modeled after the federal government with adaptations originating from the kingdom era of Hawaiian history. As codified in the [[Constitution of Hawaii]], there are three [[branches of government]]: executive, legislative and judicial.

The executive branch is led by the [[Governor of Hawaii]] assisted by the [[Lieutenant Governor of Hawaii]], both elected on the same ticket. The governor is the only state public official elected statewide; all others are  appointed by the governor. The lieutenant governor acts as the [[Secretary of State of Hawaii|Secretary of State]]. The governor and lieutenant governor oversee twenty agencies and departments from offices in the [[Hawaii State Capitol|State Capitol]]. The [[official residence]] of the governor is [[Washington Place]].

The legislative branch consists of the [[Bicameralism|bicameral]] [[Hawaii State Legislature]], which is composed of the 51-member [[Hawaii House of Representatives]] led by the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker of the House]] and the 25-member [[Hawaii Senate]] led by the [[President of the Senate]]. The Legislature meets at the State Capitol.

The unified judicial branch of Hawaii is the [[Hawai'i State Judiciary]]. The [[State supreme court|state's highest court]] is the [[Supreme Court of Hawaii]], which uses [[Aliiolani Hale|Ali{{okina}}iÅlani Hale]] as its chambers.

Unique to Hawaii is the lack of [[Municipal corporation|municipal governments]]. All local governments are administered at the [[County (United States)|county]] level. The only incorporated area in the state is a [[consolidated cityâcounty]], [[Honolulu County, Hawaii|Honolulu County]], which governs the entire island of [[Oahu]]. County executives are the referred to as mayors: The [[mayor of Hawaii County]], [[mayor of Honolulu]], [[Mayor of Kauai|mayor of Kaua{{okina}}i]] and [[mayor of Maui]]. The mayors are all elected in [[nonpartisan]] races.

==Federal government==
Hawaii is represented in the [[United States Congress]] by two Senators and two [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]]. All four are Democrats.

[[Colleen Hanabusa]] represents the [[Hawaii's 1st congressional district|1st congressional district]] in the House, representing southeastern [[Oahu]], including central Honolulu. [[Mazie Hirono]] represents the [[Hawaii's 2nd congressional district|2nd congressional district]], representing the rest of the state, which is mainly rural.

[[Daniel Inouye]] is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior senator]], having served since January 3, 1963. In June 2010, Inouye became the longest-serving current Senator; he is the current [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]], a position traditionally given to the longest-serving Senator of the majority party. [[Daniel Akaka]] is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior Senator]], having served since May 16, 1990. Inouye and Akaka were both born in 1924, making them the oldest current Senate duo.

Federal officials in Hawaii are based at the [[Prince Kuhio Federal Building|Prince KÅ«hiÅ Federal Building]] near the [[Aloha Tower]] and [[Honolulu Harbor]] in Honolulu. The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]], [[Internal Revenue Service]] and the [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] maintain their offices there, and the building is the also the site of [[United States federal courts|federal]] [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii|District Court for the District of Hawaii]] and the [[United States Attorney for the District of Hawaii]].

Hawaii supported Democrats in 10 of the last 12 presidential elections. The exceptions were [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972]] and [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]]. In [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]], [[John Kerry]] won the state's four electoral votes by a margin of nine percentage points with 54% of the vote. Every county supported the Democratic candidate. In 1964, [[favorite son]] candidate Senator [[Hiram Fong]] of Hawaii sought the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential nomination, while Patsy Mink ran in the Oregon primary in 1972.

[[Honolulu]] native, the [[List of United States Presidents|44th]] United States President [[Barack Obama]], then serving as [[United States Senator]] from [[Illinois]], was elected President of the United States on [[United States presidential election, 2008|November 4, 2008]]. Obama had won the Hawaiian Democratic Caucus on February 19, 2008 with 76% of the vote. He was the third Hawaii-born candidate to seek the nomination of a major party and the first presidential nominee from Hawaii.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rudin |first=Ken |url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/politicaljunkie/2009/12/todays_junkie_segment_on_totn_5.html |title=NPR's '&amp;#39;Political Junkie'&amp;#39;, 23 December 2009, accessed 30 December 2009 |publisher=Npr.org |date=December 23, 2009 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Heard on Tell Me More |url=http://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=96126355 |title=Asian Writer Ponders First Asian President Too |publisher=Npr.org |date=October 29, 2008 |accessdate=May 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
{{See also|Hawaii Department of Transportation|Aviation in Hawaii}}
A [[List of Hawaii state highways|system of state highways]] encircles each main island. Only O{{okina}}ahu has federal highways, and is the only area outside the contiguous 48 states to have signed [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]]. Travel can be slow due to narrow winding roads, and congestion in cities.  Each major island has a public bus system.

[[Honolulu International Airport]] is the major commercial aviation hub of Hawaii, with intercontinental services to North America, Asia, Australia, and Oceania. Within Hawaii, [[Hawaiian Airlines]], [[Mokulele Airlines]] and [[go! (airline)|go!]] use jets between the larger airports in Honolulu, LÄ«hu{{okina}}e, Kahului, Kona and Hilo, while [[Island Air]] and [[Pacific Wings]] serve smaller airports. These airlines also provide air freight service between the islands.

Private steamships and ferries were the sole way of traveling between the islands from the 19th century until the 1950s.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} [[Seaflite]] operated [[hydrofoil]]s between the major islands in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Hawaii Superferry]] operated between O{{okina}}ahu and Maui between December 2007 and March 2009, with additional routes planned for other islands. Legal issues over environmental impact statements and protests ended the service, though the company operating Superferry has expressed a wish to begin ferry service again at a future date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=[[Honolulu Star-Bulletin]] |url= http://www.starbulletin.com/news/20090329_Aloha_Superferry.html |title= Aloha, Superferry Alakai leaves Hawaii to find job |date= March 29, 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently there is passenger ferry service in [[Maui County]] between Moloka'i and Maui, and between Lana'i and Maui, though neither of these takes vehicles. [[Norwegian Cruise Lines]] also provides passenger [[cruise ship]] service between the islands.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

At one time, Hawaii had a network of railroads on each of the larger islands that helped move farm commodities as well as passengers. These railroads were all narrow gauge ({{convert|3|ft|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge for the majority although there were some {{convert|2|ft|6|in|mm|0|abbr=on}} gauge on some of the smaller islands â standard US gauge is {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}}).  The largest by far was the [[Oahu Railway and Land Company]] (OR&amp;L) which ran multiple lines from [[Honolulu]] across the western and northern part of [[Oahu]].  The OR&amp;L was an important player moving troops and goods during World War II.  Traffic on this line was busy enough that there were signals on the lines facilitating movement of trains and [[wigwag (railroad)|wigwag]] signals at some railroad crossings for the protection of motorists.  The mainline was officially abandoned in 1947, although part of it was bought by the US Navy and operated until 1970.  Thirteen miles (21&amp;nbsp;km) of track remain and preservationists occasionally run trains over a portion of this line.&lt;ref&gt;Hawaiian Railway Album â WW II Photographs Vol 2; Victor Norton Jr. and Gale E.
