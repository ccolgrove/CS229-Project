'''Vodafone Australia''' is a [[mobile telephone]] company, a subsidiary of [[Vodafone Hutchison Australia]]. Vodafone Australia was formerly a wholly owned subsidiary of Vodafone Plc (which is based in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]).

On 10 June 2009, after [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission|ACCC]] approval, Vodafone Australia merged with the Australian subsidiary of [[Hutchison 3G]] (known by its '3' brand) to become Vodafone Hutchison Australia Pty Ltd, owned by Hutchison Telecommunications Australia (a subsidiary of [[Hutchison Whampoa]]) and [[Vodafone Group PLC]] on a 50-50 basis.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchison Telecommunications Australia release to Australian Securities Exchange, 10 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Phone products include [[Prepaid mobile phone|prepaid]] and [[postpaid]] mobile services, on [[GSM]] and [[3G]] [[UMTS]] mobile networks. [[Vodafone live!]] is Vodafone's [[Mobile Web|mobile Internet]] service.

==Coverage==

The GSM mobile service on 900&amp;nbsp;MHz and 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz covers 94.52% of the Australian population. The 3G 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz [[UMTS]] network is available in metro areas of major cities and some larger regional centres covering 10% of the population. Expansion of the 3G UMTS network using 900&amp;nbsp;MHz to equal or surpass the GSM coverage is due to be completed by 31 August 2009 [http://www.vodafone.com.au/personal/services/coverage/maps/index.htm] [http://maps02.pdslive.com.au/VCATPublic/Kiosk.html]. 21 October Vodafone publicly announced their plans to improve Coverage in all major capital cities across Australia by building another 1,150 new 900MHz Network Towers on top of the 350 900MHz Towers already existing.

== Network Problems ==
In the last quarter of 2010, the Vodafone Australia network began to exhibit severe problems regarding call quality, voicemail, SMS reliability and data speeds. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/vodafone-sets-up-taskforce-to-fix-network-issues-as-9000-express-interest-in-class-action-20110105-19fkh.html Vodafone sets up taskforce to fix network issues as 9000 express interest in class action]&lt;/ref&gt; A class action suit was run against them, due to the network being seen as unfit for purpose. Vodafone blamed the customer use of smartphones, as well as faulty software patches for their problems. The CEO of Vodafone was forced to issue an apology and certain affected customers were allowed to leave prior to serving their contract periods &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.vodafone.com.au/blog/an-apology-to-our-customers An apology to our customers&lt;/ref&gt;. Shortly after that, Vodafone announced an new investment programme to address these and other issues. This will not complete until 2013.
