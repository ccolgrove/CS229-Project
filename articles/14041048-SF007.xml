The OSP is an example of free [[Fair, Reasonable and Non Discriminatory terms]] for patents, also known as a Covenant Not to Sue.

The OSP licensing covers any use and any implementations of an appended list of covered specifications. It is limited for implementations to the extent that they conform to those specifications. This allows for conformance to be partial and does not require the conformance to be perfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Compatibility with open source licensing==
The OSP is effectively a [[patent]] sublicense to everyone limited to use with certain formats and required technology to implement OSP licensed formats.

Open source licenses, in general, deal with licensing of [[copyright]]s of contributors to the software. [[GPLv2]] is an example of such copyright licensing. GPLv2 does not grant you 3rd party (patent) rights.

The open source software (OSS) licensing deals with copyrights on the [[source code]] created by the contributors. Source code based on an OSP licenced format specification has its own copyrights and is therefore sublicensable by the contributors themselves. The OSP is only about patent rights. It grants additional rights to implementers and users to the OSS licensing.

Because Microsoft through the OSP grants patent rights to anybody that implements or uses technology required for OOXML there is no need for sublicensing of patent rights through the GPL. OSS users and implementers get the same rights automatically.

An OSS implementer that uses GPL software which implements an OSP licensed format, is granted certain copyrights on the software through his GPL license, which are granted by the prior software contributors. In addition to that he is allowed to use Microsoft patents for required format related technology through the OSP license.

Several standards and OSS licensing experts have expressed support of the OSP in 2006.  An article in Cover Pages quotes [[Lawrence Rosen]], an attorney and lecturer at Stanford Law School, as saying, 

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I'm pleased that this OSP is compatible with free and open source licenses.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| publisher=xml.coverpages.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006 [[Mark Webbink]]; a lawyer and member of the board of the Software Freedom Law Center, and former employee of Linux vendor [[Red Hat]]; said,

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Red Hat believes that the text of the OSP gives sufficient flexibility to implement the listed specifications in software licensed under free and open source licenses. We commend Microsoftâs efforts to reach out to representatives from the open source community and solicit their feedback on this text, and Microsoft's willingness to make modifications in response to our comments.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|date=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Standards lawyer Andy Updegrove said in 2006 the Open Specification Promise was

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;what I consider to be a highly desirable tool for facilitating the implementation of open standards, in particular where those standards are of interest to the open source community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Scope limitation===
The [[Software Freedom Law Center]], which provides services to protect and advance free software and open source software, has warned of problems with the Open Specification Promise for use in [[free software| free software / open source software]] projects. In a published analysis of the promise it states that&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| title=Software Freedom Law Center Publishes Analysis of Microsoft's Open Specification Promise

:&quot;...it permits implementation under free software licenses so long as the resulting code isn't used freely.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFLC report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Microsoft's Open Specification Promise: No Assurance for GPL |url=http://www.softwarefreedom.org/resources/2008/osp-gpl.html |date=2008-03-12
|publisher=Software Freedom Law Center |accessdate=2008-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2008 the [[Software Freedom Law Center]] warned over a possible inconsistency with GPL&lt;ref name=&quot;SFLC report&quot;/&gt; and in specific the limited scope of the OSP. This applies specifically to the patent promise scope being limited to conforming implementations of covered specifications only.

Effectively when an implementer owns a patent and builds that patent technology in GPL3 licensed code, the implementer grants those first party rights patent rights downline to all re-users of that code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GNU General Public License (Version 3, 29 June 2007) |url=http://www.fsf.org/licensing/licenses/gpl.html |publisher=Free Software Foundation |date=2008-02-12}} See section 11 for patents.&lt;/ref&gt; If you use third party OSP protected patents in GPL3 code, you cannot sublicense those, and the OSP scope is limited to required (normative) parts of the covered specification. This means that when the code is reused, the OSP only applies as long as the reuse of that code is limited to implementing the covered specifications. If the OSP was not limited in that way, you could implement all patented technology in a GPL3 code implementation after which the code patented technology could be reused freely for all other possible implementations. The limitations of a one-sided patent promise only applying to covered specifications is also present in the IBM [http://www-03.ibm.com/linux/ossstds/isplist.html Interoperability Specifications Pledge] (ISP) and Sun Microsystems' [http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/office/ipr.php OpenDocument Patent Statement].

This means, for example, that use of the required Sun patented StarOffice-related technology for OpenDocument should be protected by the Sun Covenant, but reuse of the code with the patented technology for non-OpenDocument implementations is no longer protected by the related Sun covenant.

The OSP similarly can be used to freely implement any of the covered specifications in OSS but its scope is limited to the covered specifications and cannot be used to transfer Microsoft patent rights to other implementations of non covered specifications for instance by using the technology in code that has a patent transferring software license.

For this reason the SFLC has stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The OSP cannot be relied upon by GPL developers for their implementations not because its provisions conflict with GPL, but because it does not provide the freedom that the GPL requires.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFLC report&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The SFLC specifically point out:
* new versions of listed specifications could be issued at any time by Microsoft, and be excluded from the OSP.
* any code resulting from an implementation of one of the covered specifications could not safely be used outside the very limited field of use defined by Microsoft in the OSP.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFLC report&quot;/&gt;

The Microsoft OSP itself mentions the GPL in two of its FAQs. In one it says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;we canât give anyone a legal opinion about how our language relates to the GPL or other OSS licenses&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In another, it specifically only mentions the &quot;developers, distributors, and users of Covered Implementations&quot;, so excluding downstream developers, distributors, and users of code later derived from these &quot;Covered Implementations&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SFLC report&quot;/&gt; and it specifically does not mention which version of the GPL is addressed, leading some commentators to conclude that the current GPL 3 may be excluded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|quote=Use the GNU GPL 3: Most free software is released under the GNU GPL 2 or 3, which is incompatible with Microsoft's OSP (Open Specification Promise) and the Ms-PL (Microsoft Public License). This is not an accident. Microsoft does not want software written using their technology to spread to other platform. Again, it's vendor lock-in. If Microsoft truly wanted to work with the Open Source community, they should abandon the OSP and the Ms-PL for the GPL, or another OSI certified license.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Q: I am a developer/distributor/user of software that is licensed under the GPL, does the Open Specification Promise apply to me?&lt;br&gt;A: Absolutely, yes. The OSP applies to developers, distributors, and users of Covered Implementations without regard to the development model that created such implementations, or the type of copyright licenses under which they are distributed, or the business model of distributors/implementers. The OSP provides the assurance that Microsoft will not assert its Necessary Claims against anyone who make, use, sell, offer for sale, import, or distribute any Covered Implementation under any type of development or distribution model, including the GPL.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/interop/osp/default.mspx#ELPAC Microsoft Open Specification Promise - Frequently Asked Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
