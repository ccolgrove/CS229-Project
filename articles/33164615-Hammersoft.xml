==History==
Squad 1 was organized in [[Harlem]] at Engine 59 in 1955, moved to the [[Bronx]] at Ladder 58 in 1972, then to Engine 45 in 1975 and then disbanded in 1976. Squad 1 was re-established in 1977 in Brooklyn at 786 Union Street, the former quarters of Engine 269; which had been closed during the budget crisis. The local community had placed great pressure on the city to reopen the former house of Engine 269 and the city responded by reopening it and making it the new quarters for Squad 1.&lt;ref&gt;New York Fire Department (Source Date: September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Squad 1 was assigned a fully equipped pumper with ladder company hand and power tools. Squad 1âs responses included the former âfirst dueâ boxes of Engine 269 and working fires within a designated area. In 1998 New York City recognized the need to have more specialized units that could handle hazardous material incidents as well as increased readiness for incidents involving weapons of mass destruction. Six more engines were then designated as Squad Companies. Engine Company 41 was already an enhanced engine company but was redesigned as a Squad Company.&lt;ref&gt;New York Fire Department (Source Date: September 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Squad 1 responds as an engine in its first, second and third due assignments and as a Squad Company to working fires, high angle, collapse, confined space, subway emergencies and hazardous material emergencies in Brooklyn and throughout the city as needed. Squad 1 responds to approximately 1800 runs per year.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Tricarico, Tricks of the Trade: The Rescue/Pumper and the FDNY Squad Concept. Firehouse.Com , September 22, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
==September 11th Attacks==
Squad 1 lost half of its squad at the [[World Trade Center]] in the [[September 11th attacks]].  The squad would be one of the most devastated FDNY units impacted by the collapse of the Twin Towers losing 11 members:  Captain James M. Amato,  Lt. Edward A. D'Atri,  Lt. Michael Esposito,  Lt. Michael N. Fodor,  Brian Bilcher, Thomas M. Butler,  Peter Carroll,  Robert Cordice,  David J. Fontana,  Matthew David Garvey, and Stephen Gerard Siller.  Squad 1 crossed [[Brooklyn Bridge]] to respond to the attacks and was last seen in the south tower.  The door of their pumper engine was recovered and is now on display at the [[Smithsonian]] [[National Museum of American History]].&lt;ref&gt;The 9/11 World Trade Center attacks, through the eyes of a former NYC fire official.
