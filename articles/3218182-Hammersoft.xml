'''VH1''' is a specialist music television channel from [[MTV Networks Europe]]. The channel broadcasts into the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]. The channel is based on the original VH1 [[VH1|American channel of the same name]]. The channel launched across Europe on October 10, 1994.

==Concept==
*MTV Networks created VH1 as an alternative to its youth orientated channel [[MTV]].

*The channel targets an audience between 25 to 44 year olds, VH1 aims to be &quot;mature, sophisticated and totally stylish for viewers who still feel young and want to keep in-touch with what is happening on the music scene today.&quot; The music they play consists of music from the 1970s right through to today.

*Until 2008, much of their programming was taken from VH1 USA. The channel now focuses entirely on music videos, with many 'Top 20' and 'Top 40' countdowns. 

*Between its UK launch and the late 1990s the channel played many 80s videos including the present day at the time, while the logo was displayed in the top right hand corner with &quot;MUSIC FIRST&quot; displayed underneath it. The channel also at the time would dedicate particular days to an artist. Examples of these included &quot;[[The Jacksons|Jacksons]] Day&quot;, &quot;[[The Beautiful South|Beautiful South]] Day&quot; and &quot;[[Elton John]] Day&quot;. A &quot;[[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] Day&quot; in 1998 featured a full-length concert, alongside her music videos on the then daytime ''Upbeat'' programme.

*In July 1998, the channel ran a &quot;[[Pop Up Video]] Marathon&quot;. Another feature which would run on the channel was ''Ten of the Best'', in which an artist's video is played and then the act themselves are on camera selecting their ten best videos, in which they would say why they like it along with the song with a description of the video that the viewer would be shown. After the show ended on VH1, the same idea was then transferred to VH2, in which alternative artists like [[Feeder]] and [[Athlete (band)|Athlete]] would chose the videos. The videos shown were usually bands like [[The Pixies]], [[Elbow (band)|Elbow]] and [[Biffy Clyro]]. Despite VH2 later ceasing to exist, VH1 have not re-considered the concept.

'''Alternative VH1 channels:''' 

*'''[[VH1 Classic UK|VH1 Classic]]''' (launched 1 July 1999; closed 1 March 2010) played all time greats from the '60s to the '90s.

*'''[[VH2]]''' (launched 16 December 2003; closed 1 August 2006) showed mainly music videos and live concerts. It focused on [[Rock (music)|Rock]], [[Indie (music)|Indie]] and [[Punk rock|Punk]] music and branded itself as 'the alternative to manufactured pop'.
