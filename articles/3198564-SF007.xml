'''rPath, Inc.''' is a technology company based in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] that provides a platform (a &quot;service factory&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;) for enterprise IT organizations, [[independent software vendor]]s (ISVs) and on-demand service providers to automate the process of constructing (or packaging), deploying and updating software stacks across physical, virtual and cloud-based environments. rPath models the entire [[software stack]] and manages all of its components and dependencies under [[version control]] &lt;ref&gt;Hubbert, Evelyn. &quot;The Low-Hanging Fruit That Service Operations Teams Should Consider Now&quot;. Forrester Research, 2009, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;. It acts as a model-driven and version-controlled repository and software distribution hub &lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Rachel. &quot;Eucalyptus Systems, newScale and rPath join to build integrated cloud on-ramp&quot;. The 451 Group, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Technology Overview ==

rPath takes a different approach to automation than that of many traditional management-tool vendors &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;. To many in IT, automation is seen as the codification of [[runbook]]s &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;, but rPath industrializes the operational aspects of the [[data center]] by modeling software stacks and enabling them to be intelligently managed &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;. This approach has the potential to transform the way IT manages its relationship with the business units and the technology &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;. The rPath solution is suitable for organizations where change is an ongoing process. For these companies, the ability to industrialize the process and procedures will result in improved quality of service at reduced cost &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''System [[Version Control]]''' 

rPath provides a commercial [[version control]] platform for deployed software systems. rPath is not a source code management system. Rather, it is an operational management platform that applies the principles and disciplines of source code control to the management of deployable software systemsâspecifically, system manifests, packages, [[binaries]], policies and [[system configuration]]s. System [[version control]] is the technological foundation that ensures systems can be quickly reproduced, [[patch]]ed and updated, [[rollback]]-ed and reported on &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

'''Deep System Modeling''' 

rPath also provides a deeply modeled system inventory. This inventory granularly describes the desired state of every file, [[binary]], application component, and software stack on every production systemâwith complete information about applied policies and dependenciesâas version-controlled system manifests. These manifests are actionable models for managing the complete lifecycle of deployed systems, providing the basis for understanding change impact and controlling change. Also, rather than applying universal updates, [[patch]]es and updates can be targeted to only the systems that require change &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''Hierarchical System Definition'''

rPath allows definition of systems as layered variants of common base platforms. For example, the standard corporate web server stack may start with a standard build of [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] (RHEL), but add a specific custom version of the [[Apache HTTP Server]] and remove all availability of [[FTP]]. With this feature, IT administrators can avoid redundant and error-prone [[patch]]ing and application updates across thousands of instances by applying changes once to these base platforms &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 3-4.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

'''Policy-Based Control'''

rPath enables IT groups to define and automatically enforce build-time policies that govern how systems are constructed. These policies may enforce specific best practices, inject management agents, policies or metadata, or control which versions of software are or are not included. By using the policy-based controls and hierarchical definitions in rPath organizations can check that a system is compliant by comparing it to a reference architecture based on centrally defined policies &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

'''Automated Dependency Discovery'''

When rPath imports new or existing software artifacts into system [[version control]], it automatically analyzes each software artifact to discover its entire software supply chain, including [[operating system]] (OS) components, [[middleware]] and libraries. This information enables build-time system construction and validation and reduces the number of maintenance failures and outages that result from missing dependencies and conflicting components. âOvum considers the automated dependency-checking capability to be an extremely useful and often overlooked feature that all such tools should employ &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 4-5.&lt;/ref&gt;.â  
 
'''Release Lifecycle Management'''

rPath ensures stakeholders in each phase of the lifecycle are working from a consistent system definition, eliminating the risk of system âdriftâ between lifecycle stages and enabling a clean [[software build]] environment. rPath also provides access control and workflow to ensure controlled and auditable handoff between development, test, staging and production phases of the release lifecycle &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Conary ==
rPath developed [[Conary (package manager)|Conary]], an open source software [[package management system|package management]] and [[software configuration management|configuration]] software that forms the core of rBuilder.&lt;ref name=&quot;byfield&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Package management meets version control in rPath | publisher = [[linux.com]] | author = Bruce Byfield  | date = 2006-04-12 | url = http://www.linux.com/feature/53266 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows [[rollback]]s, incremental (&quot;changeset&quot;) updates, and distributed downloading which removes the need for programs such as [[Advanced Packaging Tool|apt]] or [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|yum]].

== History ==

rPath was founded in 2005 and was originally known for packaging applications as [[virtual appliance]]s for its [[independent software vendor]]s (ISVs) and end-user customers &lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Rachel. &quot;Eucalyptus Systems, newScale and rPath join to build integrated cloud on-ramp&quot;. The 451 Group, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;. It was co-founded by [[Erik Troan]], co-author of [[Red Hat Package Manager]] (RPM), the [[Linux]] standard [[package management system]] &lt;ref&gt;Waldman, Brett. Gillen, Al. &quot;IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Software Appliance 2009 Vendor Analysis&quot;. IDC, 2009, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;. rPath was one of the first entrants into the [[software appliance]] market and its innovative integrated lifecycle management quickly set it up apart from other solutions. rPathâs rBuilder product consistently scored at the top of the [[software appliance]] market in the capability categories &lt;ref&gt;Waldman, Brett. Gillen, Al. &quot;IDC MarketScape: Worldwide Software Appliance 2009 Vendor Analysis&quot;. IDC, 2009, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2009, rPath made a transition to selling to enterprise IT organizations. 

== Platform Support ==

rPath provides system automation for [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Server 2008]] and 2003 as well as [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] 4 and 5, [[SUSE Linux Enterprise Server]] 10, and [[CentOS]]. The solution is also available on-premise, as a dedicated hosted solution, and [[SaaS]] &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Partnerships ==

rPath has a number of key implementation and distribution partnerships including [[GlobalLogic]], NEI, [[EMC]], and [[IBM]]. Key technology partnerships include [[VMware]], [[Red Hat]], [[Microsoft]] &lt;ref&gt;Illsley, Roy. &quot;rPathârBuilder&quot;. Ovum, 2010, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== The NRE Alliance ==

The NRE Alliance (NRE) is a coalition of newScale, rPath and [[Eucalyptus_(computing) | Eucalyptus Systems]] focused on bringing self-service private and hybrid [[cloud computing]] to the enterprise. The three vendors have combined the best in self-service, automation and elasticity to deliver a complete enterprise [[cloud computing]] solution that will help IT departments transform into internally managed versions of a public [[cloud computing]] service like [[Rackspace]] or [[Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud]] (EC2) &lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, Rachel. &quot;Eucalyptus Systems, newScale and rPath join to build integrated cloud on-ramp&quot;. The 451 Group, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;. The coalition was announced on August 24, 2010 &lt;ref&gt;Burns, Paul. &quot;Four Keys to the Enterprise Cloud&quot;. Neovise, 2010, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

NRE offers the foundations for a complete enterprise [[cloud computing]] solution. newScale provides a self-service IT storefront with on-demand provisioning from a menu of private or public [[cloud computing]] service options; rPath is the âservice factory,â or a centralized software distribution hub for managing IT system construction and change; and [[Eucalyptus]] Systems provides private [[cloud computing]] infrastructure for elastic scaling of workloads based on dynamic demand. The complete solution is delivered by MomentumSI &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 1-2.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

&quot;One of the main benefits of this coalition is agility, helping multiple departments within IT to accelerate testing and deployment of new business applications. [The NRE Alliance] offers enterprise IT organizations a faster on-ramp to on-demand IT service delivery &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; 

&quot;The NRE Alliance delivers on the four key elements of an enterprise cloudâself-service, automation, elasticity and integration. It is these same four keys to the enterprise cloud which newScale, rPath, [[Eucalyptus]] Systems and MomentumSI have come together to provide. Building and managing a private cloud is now within reach &lt;ref&gt;Burns, Paul. &quot;Four Keys to the Enterprise Cloud&quot;. Neovise, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; 

While newScale is the storefront and orchestration engine, rPath is the &quot;service factory,&quot; which provides the &quot;back-end automation&quot; for the storefront &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

&quot;rPath automates the assembly of new, ready-to-deploy software stacks. The process is based on an automated build-time dependency discovery that resolves the entire dependency chain. The resulting information is the basis for a detailed model that defines what software, policies and configurations belong on a system. These models define entire application stacks or any layer of a stack (such as [[OS]] or [[middleware]]). Each model is version controlled to ensure consistency over time &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; 

The models rPath generates &quot;act as âblueprintsâ of the systems and system configurations representing a complete business service. The blueprints describe every piece of software and the relationships among software components. Policy enforcement associates policies with services and governs the specifications and relationships among the technology elements &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; 

&quot;Once rPath has modeled each service, it makes it available as a standardized and reusable component within the newScale catalog. The models can then be used to automate provisioning of similar services across development, test, and/or production environments, generating new images on-demand or incremental updates to deployed systems &lt;ref&gt;Craig, Julie. &quot;Cloud Coalition: rPath, newScale, and Eucalyptus Systems Partner on Self-Service Public and Private Cloud&quot;. Enterprise Management Associates, 2010, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot;
