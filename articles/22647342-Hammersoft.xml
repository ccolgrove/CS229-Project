The '''Battle Of Puthukkudiyirippu''' was a land battle fought between the [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Military]], [[58 Division (Sri Lanka)|58 Division]], [[53 Division (Sri Lanka)|53 Division]] and [[Task Force 8 (Sri Lanka)|Task Force 8]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) for the control of the last stronghold held by the LTTE. This battle is a part of the [[Northern Theater of Eelam War IV|Northern Theater]] of [[Eelam War IV]] during the [[Sri Lankan civil war]].

== Battle ==

The Battle of Puthukkudiyirippu was an armed confrontation over control over the AGA division of Puthukkudiyirippu in Sri Lanka between the 55, 58th and 53rd Division of the Sri Lankan Military and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) during the Sri Lankan civil war, fought from the first months of 2009 till the end of April 2009. Puthukkudiyirippu was the final LTTE base held by the LTTE during the Northern Theater of Eelam War IV. 

The battle of Puthukkudiyirippu was different from other battles because the area was an urban terrain. Both parties adopted hit and run strategies until a decisive battle was fought in [[Battle of Aanandapuram|Anandapuram junction]] where more than 600 LTTE carders and an array of top leaders were killed in five days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/315]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://dbsjeyaraj.com/dbsj/archives/293]&lt;/ref&gt; A major tiger offensive was met with a counter offensive, outflanking and encircling an entire division of LTTE in an area of 2 square kilometers.
