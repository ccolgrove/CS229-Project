The '''Poodle''' is a [[dog breed|breed]] of [[dog]]. The Standard Poodle is regarded as the second most [[dog intelligence|intelligent]] breed of dog after the [[Border Collie]], and before the [[German Shepherd Dog]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stanleycoren.com/e_intelligence.htm |title=Intelligent breeds, from |publisher=Stanley Coren |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|Intelligence (Dubious)|date=October 2011}} The poodle breed is found officially in toy, miniature, and standard sizes, with many [[coat (dog)|coat]] colors. Originally bred as a [[Dog type|type]] of [[water dog]], the poodle is skillful in many [[dog sports]], including agility, obedience, tracking, and even herding. Poodles have taken top honors in many [[conformation show]]s, including &quot;Best in Show&quot; at the [[Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show]] in 1991 and 2002, and at the [[World Dog Show]] in 2007 and 2010.

==History==
[[File:Wenceslas Hollar - A poodle, after Matham.jpg|thumb|right|A 17th century engraving of a poodle.]]
Poodles are retrievers or [[gun dog]]s, and can still be seen in that role most of the time. 
The poodle is believed to have originated in Germany, where it is known as the Pudel. The English word &quot;poodle&quot; comes from the Low German ''pudel'' or ''puddeln'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=poodle|title=etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning to splash in the water. The breed was standardized in France, where it was commonly used as a water retriever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bark Bytes, Inc. |url=http://www.barkbytes.com/history/poodle.htm |title=History of the Poodle |publisher=Barkbytes.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The American Kennel Club states that the large, or Standard, Poodle is the oldest of the three varieties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/poodle/index.cfm|title=From American Kennel Club site.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that the dog gained special fame as a water worker. So widely was it used as retriever that it was bred with a moisture-resistant coat to further facilitate progress in swimming. All of the Poodle's ancestors were acknowledged to be good swimmers, although one member of the family, the truffle dog (which may have been of Toy or Miniature size), it is said, never went near the water. [[Truffle (fungi)|Truffle]] hunting was widely practiced in England, and later in Spain and Germany, where the edible fungus has always been considered a delicacy. For scenting and digging up the fungus, the smaller dogs were favored, since they did less damage to the truffles with their feet than the larger kinds. So it is rumored&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chestofbooks.com/animals/dogs/British-Dog-Shows/The-Poodle-Part-3.html |title=The Poodle. Part 3 |publisher=Chestofbooks.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that a terrier was crossed with the Poodle to produce the ideal truffle hunter.

Despite the standard poodle's claim to greater age than the other varieties, there is some evidence to show that the smaller types developed only a short time after the breed assumed the general type by which it is recognized today. The smallest, or Toy variety, was developed in England in the 18th century, when the [[Havanese]] became popular there. This was a sleeve dog attributed to the West Indies from whence it traveled to Spain and then to England. The continent had known the poodle long before it came to England. Drawings by the German artist, [[Albrecht Durer]], establish the breed in the 15th and 16th centuries. It was the principal pet dog of the later 18th century in Spain, as shown by the paintings of the Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]]. France had toy poodles as pampered favorites during the reign of Louis XVI at about the same period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/poodle/history.cfm |title=American Kennel Club - Poodle History |publisher=Akc.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toy Puppy.png|150px|thumb|right|A toy poodle at ten weeks.]]

=== Appearance ===
Most poodles have a curly, non-shedding [[coat (dog)|coat]] that requires regular grooming. Since poodles do not have the plush double coat of many breeds, their fur is often referred to as &quot;hair&quot;, a term usually reserved for humans.{{Ref_label|1|note 1|none}} Most poodles are solid-colored, and many registries allow only solid colors in conformation shows. Poodles come in a wide variety of solid colors including white, black, blue, gray, silver, brown, cafe-au-lait, apricot, red and cream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akc.org/breeds/poodle/ American Kennel Club - Poodle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Parti&quot; (short for parti-colored) poodles have large patches of colors different from the main body color. &quot;Phantom&quot; poodles have tan points, a pattern similar to that of a [[Doberman Pinscher]] or [[Rottweiler]].

====Poodle sizes====
Unlike most breeds, poodles can come in a variety of sizes, distinguished by adult shoulder ([[withers]]) height. The exact height cutoffs among the varieties vary slightly from country to country. Non-FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale kennel clubs generally recognize three sizes, ''standard'', ''miniature'', and ''toy'', sometimes as sizes of the same breed and sometimes as separate breeds. The FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale recognizes four sizes of one breed, ''standard'', ''medium'', ''miniature'', and ''toy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fci.be/nomenclatures_detail.asp?lang=en&amp;file=group9#section2 |title=FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale Group 9, Section 2, Poodle |publisher=Fci.be |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only the FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale describes a maximum size for standard poodles. France is the country responsible for the breed in the FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale, and in this country the puppies of all sizes are listed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poodle.braquedubourbonnais.info/puppy.htm |title=List of poodle puppies registered to the French Kennel Club |publisher=scc.asso.fr|date= |accessdate=2006-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The terms ''royal standard'', ''teacup'', and ''tiny teacup'' are marketing names, and are not recognized by any major kennel club.

All the FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale poodles are in Group 9 ''Companion and Toy'', Section 2 ''Poodle''. All [[the Kennel Club]] poodles are in the [[Utility Group]]. All three sizes of poodle for the [[Australian National Kennel Council]] and the [[New Zealand Kennel Club]] are in the [[Non-Sporting Group]]. The [[Canadian Kennel Club]] and the American Kennel Club place standard and miniature sizes in the Non-Sporting Group, and the toy size in the [[Toy Group]]. The United Kennel Club places the miniature and toy in the [[Companion Group]] and the standard poodle in the [[Gundog Group]].

==== Coat ====
Unlike most dogs which have double [[coat (dog)|coats]], poodles have a single layer coat (no undercoat) composed of dense, curly [[fur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=what-is-the-difference-be |title=What is the difference between hair and fur? |work= [[Scientific American]] |publisher=Sciam.com |date=2001-02-20 |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Moult|sheds]] minimally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marvistavet.com/html/body_canine_lymphoma.html |title= Canine Lymphoma |quote=Most breeds have hairs in all different stages of the growth-shed cycle at the same time. A few breeds [incl. poodle] have all hairs in the same stage of growth-shed at the same time. |publisher=Marvistavet.com |accessdate=2011-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They  could be considered [[hypoallergenic]] (though not completely allergen free).&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.entdocs.org/catallergy.htm ''Allergic to Dogs, Is Any Dog Safe?''] Allergy site from an MD. Poodles, airedales, and schnauzers are cited as dogs that only shed their skin every 21&amp;nbsp;days, and so may be less of a problem for allergic people. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E0D61E3DF936A35751C0A961958260&amp;n=Top/News/Science/Topics/Animals |title= Nonallergenic Dog? Not Really |first= Denise |last= Grady |work=The New York Times |date=February 5, 1997 |accessdate=2011-04-21 }} How hypoallergenic the dog is may vary with the individual dog and the individual person.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the poodle does shed, but instead of the [[fur]] coming off of the dog, it becomes tangled in the surrounding hair. This can lead to matting without proper care. Texture ranges from coarse and woolly to soft and wavy. Poodle show clips require many hours of brushing and care per week, about 10&amp;nbsp;hours/week for a standard poodle. Poodles are usually clipped down as soon as their show career is over and put into a lower-maintenance cut. Pet clips are much less elaborate than show and require much less maintenance. A pet owner can anticipate grooming a poodle every six to eight weeks. Although professional grooming is often costly, poodles are easy to groom at home with the proper equipment.

==== Show clips ====
Many breed registries allow only certain clips for poodles shown in conformation. In American Kennel Club shows, adults must be shown in the &quot;Continental&quot; or &quot;English saddle&quot; clips. Dogs under 12 months old may be shown with a &quot;puppy clip.&quot; The American Kennel Club allows the Sporting Clip in Stud Dog and Brood Bitch classes as well.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Some sources believe the show clips evolved from working clips, which originally provided warmth to major joints when the dogs were immersed in cold water. The rest of the body is shaved for less drag in the water. Others express skepticism at this theory, instead citing the French [[circus]] as the origin of the entertaining and unique clips.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=====Second Puppy =====
[[Image:Jackie Vasteras 20070721-1.JPG|160px|thumb|right|A medium sized poodle in the Scandinavian clip]]
This clip is also called the Scandinavian clip or puppy clip. It was invented by Swedish and Norwegian show groomers in the 1970s. This clip is the most common one in all sizes for shows in Europe, and is allowed for adult poodles to be shown in the [[FÃ©dÃ©ration Cynologique Internationale|FCI]] countries. The face, throat, belly, feet and the base of the tail are shaved 5 to 7 days before the show to get a nice smooth appearance of the shaved areas. The hair on the head is left to form a &quot;topknot&quot; that is fixed in place using latex bands; this is because in most European countries, hair spray is banned. The rest of the dog is shaped with scissors. It makes the parts of the dog look fluffy.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===== Continental clip =====
In the continental clip the face, throat, feet and part of the tail are shaved. The upper half of the front legs is shaved, leaving &quot;fluffy pompons&quot; around the ankles. The hindquarters are shaved except for pompons on the lower leg (from the [[hock (zoology)|hock]] to the base of the foot) and optional round areas (sometimes called &quot;rosettes&quot;) over the hips. The continental clip is the most popular show clip today.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===== English Saddle clip =====
The English saddle clip is similar to the continental, except for the hindquarters. The hindquarters are not shaved except a small curved area on each flank (just behind the body), the feet, and bands just below the stifle (knee) and above the hock, leaving three pompoms. This clip is now rarely seen in standard poodles.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==== Pet clips ====
Pet clips can be as simple or as elaborate as owners wish. The hair under the tail should always be kept short to keep feces from matting in the poodle's curls. Most owners also keep the feet and face clipped short to prevent dirt from matting between toes, tear stains on lighter coated poodles and food from matting around the dog's muzzle. Beyond these sanitary requirements, desired clips depend on owners' preferences. Some owners maintain a longer clip in winter than summer, which they groom often with a wire slicker brush to remove tangles and prevent matting.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==== Corded coat ====
[[Image:Corded Standard Poodle black.jpg|thumb|right|A corded standard poodle]]
In most cases, whether a poodle is in a pet or show clip, hair is completely brushed out. Poodle hair can also be &quot;corded&quot; with rope-like mats similar to those of a [[Komondor]] or human [[dreadlocks]]. Though once as common as the curly poodle, corded poodles are now rare. [[Cording (Dog Grooming)|Corded coats]] are difficult to keep clean and take a long time to dry after washing. Any poodle with a normal coat can be corded when their adult coat is in. Corded poodles may be shown in all major kennel club shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;AKC&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akc.org/breeds/poodle/index.cfm |title=American Kennel Club: Poodle Breed Standard.

== Temperament ==
[[Image:Standard_Poodle_Catching.jpg|thumb|right|A standard poodle catching]]
Otherwise notable is this breed's keen sense for instinctual behavior. In particular, [[territorial marking|marking]] and hunting drives are more readily observable than in most other breeds. Even Toys will point birds. Classified as highly energetic, poodles can also get bored fairly easily and have been known to get creative about finding mischief. Poodles like to be in the center of things and are easily trained to do astonishing tricks involving both brains and agility. They have performed in circuses for centuries, beginning in Europe, and have been part of the Ringling Circus in its various forms from its inception. The Grimaldis, the famous British clowns Kenneth and Audrey Austin, &quot;developed a stronger circus act&quot; with a clever poodle named 'Twinkle,' the success of which allowed them to continue performing even as octogenarians.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Poodle History&quot;&gt;[http://www.poodlehistory.org/PCIRCUS2.HTM Poodlehistory.org]: Circus Poodles.

== Health ==

[[Image:Blond Older Poodle Enjoying Water.JPG|thumb|With proper care and nutrition, many enjoy life well into their teens. The toy poodle pictured above is 16, and with [[arthritis]] medication still has an active life.]]
The most common serious health issues of standard poodles (listed in order of the number of reported cases in the [http://www.poodlehealthregistry.org/ Poodle Health Registry] (as of August 20, 2007) are [[Addison's disease]], [[gastric dilatation volvulus]] (GDV = bloat/torsion), [[thyroid]] issues (hyperthyroid and hypothyroid), [[tracheal collapse]], epilepsy, sebaceous [[adenitis]], juvenile renal disease, [[hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]], and cancer. Standard poodles are also susceptible to some health issues usually too minor to report to the poodle health registry. The most common of these minor issues are probably ear infections. Ear infections are a problem in all poodle varieties because the poodle's nonshedding coat grows into the ear canal, where it traps wax and dirt. Ear problems can be minimized by proper ear care, including regular cleaning and plucking of hair within the ear canal. A [[veterinarian]] should be consulted if the dog shows signs of an ear infection.

=== Addison's Disease ===
[[Addison's disease]] is (as of August 20, 2007) the illness most commonly reported to the Poodle Health Registry. The number of reported cases of Addison's disease is nearly twice as high as the next most common problem (GDV). Addison's disease is characterized by insufficient production of glucocorticoid and/or mineralocortoid in the adrenal cortex (by the kidneys). Addison's is often undiagnosed because early symptoms are vague and easily mistaken for other conditions. Standard poodles with unexplained lethargy, frequent gastric disturbances, or an inability to tolerate stress should be tested for Addison's. Addison's can cause fatal sodium/potassium imbalances, but, if caught early and treated with lifelong medication, most dogs can live a relatively normal life.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Gastric dilatation volvulus ===
Standard poodle owners should take special note of the high incidence of GDV in this breed. Excess gas trapped in the dog's stomach causes &quot;[[bloat]].&quot; Twisting of the stomach (volvulus or &quot;torsion&quot;) causes or is caused by excess gas. Symptoms include restlessness, inability to get comfortable, pacing, or retching without being able to bring up anything. The dog's abdomen may be visibly swollen, but dogs can bloat or torsion without visible swelling. A dog with GDV requires immediate veterinary care. The dog's survival usually depends on whether the owner can get to a vet in time.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

=== Longevity and causes of death ===
Standard poodles in UK, Denmark and USA/Canada surveys had a median lifespan of 11.5 to 12 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy Longevity&quot;&gt;[http://users.pullman.com/lostriver/breeddata.htm Pullman.com] Dog Longevity Web Site. Compiled by K. M. Cassidy. Retrieved June 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a UK survey, the most common causes of death were cancer (30%), old age (18%), GDV (bloat/torsion, 6%), and cardiac disease (5%).&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;&gt;[http://www.thekennelclub.org.uk/item/570 Thekennelclub.org.uk], Kennel Club/British Small Animal Veterinary Association Scientific Committee. 2004.

Miniature and toy poodles in UK surveys had median lifespans of 14 to 14.5 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cassidy Longevity&quot;/&gt; In miniature poodles, the leading cause of death was old age (39%).&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;/&gt; In toy poodles, the leading causes of death were old age (25%) and kidney failure (20%).&lt;ref name=&quot;KC Survey&quot;/&gt;

Some toy poodles can live up to 20 years, if they have a healthy life and are not overweight.

Poodles are crossed with other breeds for various reasons, and the resulting puppies (called [[designer dog]]s) are described by whimsical [[portmanteau word]]s, such as [[cockapoo]] or spoodle (Cocker Spaniel cross), [[goldendoodle]], [[labradoodle]] (Labrador cross), Schnoodle, pekepoos (Pekingese cross), and many others.&lt;!--Editors, please do not add names, these are for example only, not a list. To add to a list see the poodle hybrid article. --&gt;

A cross between a shedding breed and a poodle (which does not shed much) does not reliably produce a non-shedding dog. Traits of puppies from crossbreedings are not as predictable as those from purebred poodle breedings, and the crosses may shed or have unexpected or undesirable qualities from the parent breeds.

Poodle crossbreds (also called ''hybrids'') are not recognized by any major breed registry, as crossbreeds are not one breed of dog, but two. If both parents are registered purebreds but of different breeds, it is still not possible to register a puppy as two different breeds. Some minor registries and Internet registry businesses will register dogs as any breed the owner chooses with minimal or no documentation; some even allow the breeder or owner to make up a new &quot;breed name&quot; (portmanteau word).

==Hypoallergenic qualities==
Poodles are often cited as a [[hypoallergenic dog breed]]. The poodle's individual hair follicles have an active growth period that is longer than that of many other breeds of dogs; combined with the tightly curled [[coat (dog)|coat]], which slows the loss of dander and dead hair by trapping it in the curls, an individual poodle may release less dander and hair into the environment. In addition, most poodles are frequently brushed and bathed to keep them looking their best; this not only removes hair and dander but also controls the other potent allergen, saliva.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dogplay.com/Articles/MyArticles/hair_vs_fur.html |title=Hair vs Fur |publisher=Dogplay.com |date= |accessdate=2010-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although hair, dander, and saliva can be minimized, they are still present and can stick to &quot;clothes and the carpets and furnishings in your home&quot;; inhaling them, or being licked by the dog, can trigger a reaction in a sensitive person. A vacuum cleaner with a HEPA filter can help clear dander floating in the air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/pet-allergy/DS00859/DSECTION=causes Pet allergy] [[Mayo Clinic]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word hypoallergenic, when referring to a dog, is also a misconception; all dogs shed. Poodles shed hair in minimal amounts, and also release dander, but are not as likely to trigger allergies as much as many other breeds.
