&quot;'''El Chico del Apartamento 512'''&quot; ({{lang-en|The Boy in Apartment 512}}) is a song by American [[Tejano music|Tejano pop]] singer [[Selena]]. &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; was the sixth single released from ''[[Amor Prohibido]]'' (1994). The song was written and produced by Selena's brother and music producer, [[A.B. Quintanilla III]], lead [[keyboardist]] of the [[Selena y Los Dinos|group]], [[Ricky Vela]], Joshua Munoz, [[Bebu Silvetti]], Steven Torres and James Moore. It was released in the United States for Tejano and [[Contemporary Latin#Music|Contemporary Latin]] radio stations and was released as a [[promotional single]] a day before Selena was [[Murder of Selena|murdered]] on March 30, 1995. Selena promoted the song during her [[Amor Prohibido Tour]], the song was included in every venue. Her final performance was on March 14, 1995 during her concert [[Little Havana, Miami#Calle Ocho Festival|Calle Ocho Festival]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]], which attracted over 100,000 fans.

While being interviewed with ''[[La NaciÃ³n]]'', Selena told them that she recorded the song because she believed her fans would appreciate her choice in [[Dance music|Latin-pop dance]] and wanted to gain fans, who weren't acquainted with her music. &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; was given mixed to positive reviews. Because the single was released a day prior to the murder of Selena, the event jeopardized any further developments for a [[music video]], to further promote the song. &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; had never shared a position on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' and failed to impact any music chart globally. Quintanilla III stated that &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; was a &quot;[[Music of Colombia|Colombian Cumbia]]&quot; song, while being interviewed for Selena's collection, ''20 Years of Music'' (2002). The song has been covered by many artists since its release.

Quintanilla III]], brother and music producer of Selena. While it was produced by Joshua Munoz, [[Bebu Silvetti]], Steven Torres and James Moore.&lt;ref name=&quot;booklet AP&quot;/&gt; The single was released the day before Selena was [[Murder of Selena|murdered]], which jeopardize any further development of a [[music video]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Selenaremembered&quot;/&gt;

Selena expressed why she wanted to record &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot;:

&lt;Blockquote&gt;
&quot;I really wanted to record this song when I first heard it. I was sitting down eating breakfast with my husband, [[Chris Perez]], when A.B. and Ricky came rushing in. I asked him &quot;what's wrong?&quot; and he replied telling me that I have to hear one of the songs that he and Rick had just wrote. So I walked over to A.B.'s house, keep in mind we are neighbors (laughs). When A.B., had given me the song to look at. I was already in love with it. I was glad that my brother and Rick had written the song, because, I wanted to get more fans who aren't fans of [[Tejano music]]. I wanted to show other Hispanics of this different type of sound. Like, there's [[Salsa music|salsa]], [[Merengue music|merengue]] and [[Bachata (music)|bachata]], but there's also &quot;Tejano&quot;. So I instantly wanted to record &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot;. I hope all my fans and the new ones cross my fingers (laughs), will enjoy this song. I literally recorded two takes on the song, and A.B., like always, wanted me to keep going. A.B., had liked the third take and we went with it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;La NaciÃ³n&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/Blockquote&gt;

Vela, stated in his interview that the song was the &quot;lead [[Tejano music|Tejano]] song&quot; because they had used more South American rhythms, in order to get a &quot;different sound&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;booklet AP&quot;/&gt;

&quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; is an [[Tempo|up-tempo]] song, drawing influences from [[Pop music|pop]] and [[dance music|dance]] music genres.&lt;ref name=music&gt;{{cite web|url= |first1=Selena |last1=Quintanilla-Perez |first2=Pete |last2=Astudillo |authorlink1=Selena |authorlink2=Pete Astudillo |title=Amor Prohibido: Selena Digital Sheet Music|year=1994 |accessdate=9 July 2011 |work=Musicnotes.com |publisher=[[Alfred Music Publishing]]|format=Musicnotes|at=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With 102 [[beats per minute]], the song is set in [[common time]] and it is composed in [[C minor]].

The song's lyrics describes a girl who lives in an apartment complex, who always get hit on by random guys she is not interested in. All of a sudden, a whistle blows from a handsome young man in the elevator and she is stuck with curiosity on who he is, which makes her heart jump. she discovers its her new neighbor from the apartment number 512. This triggers her to think about him, write him love letters and when she bumps into him in the apartment corridor she gets shy and acts like she is not interested in him. One day she gets the courage to knock on his door to confess her love for him. Her heart is broken when she knocks on the door and a blond haired woman opens the door. She wants to run away, but as she is about to, the blond girl asks her: &quot;Were you looking for my brother?&quot;, and the song ends.

== Critical reception ==
RaÃºl Manuel RodrÃ­guez of ''El Dictamen'', believed &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; was &quot;... a wonderful piece from Ricky Vela, who had never let [us] down with his great works ...&quot; and stated that &quot;... and Selena's legacy was only growing before she was murdered by the president of her fan club. The song was released a day before she was killed. If she had lived, &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; would have been a much better success [than what it was release] ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;El Dictamen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=La MÃºsica De La Reina Por Siempre VivirÃ¡. |author=RaÃºl Manuel RodrÃ­guez |url= |newspaper=El Dictamen |date=17 March 2009 |accessdate=10 July 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Victoria DÃ­az of ''[[Grupo Reforma]]'', commented on Selena's loss and the song, stating that &quot;... we [all] know if Selena had lived to further promote her [[Amor Prohibido|fifth studio album]], that her singles &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; and &quot;[[Techno Cumbia]]&quot; would have, without a doubt, appear on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''{{'}}s [[Top Latin Songs]] at number-one ...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;notas&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=No Ver El Ã©xito De La Reina Del Tex-Mex (en Notas) |author=Victoria DÃ­az |url= |newspaper=[[Grupo Reforma]] |date=11 May 1996 |accessdate=10 July 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also stated that &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; has gained popularity since its release, but failed to impact any music charts unlike Selena's other number-one singles from ''Amor prohibido'' (1994).

Carlos MelÃ©ndez, of ''[[El Nuevo DÃ­a]]'' commented on Quintanilla III's choice for selecting the song saying that &quot;... Selena already had great songs on her ''Amor prohibido'' album, but if A.B. had picked another song similar to &quot;Bidi bidi bom bom&quot;, the album would have been way better ...&quot; MelÃ©ndez's comments towards the song were upsetting to some Puerto Rican fans, who wrote to the newspaper, many of them stated that MelÃ©ndez &quot;does not know what music is&quot;. MelÃ©ndez also complained about the song, stating that &quot;... &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; is somewhat tiring after Selena had sung the [[Bridge (music)|chorus]] some multiple times. I think A.B., was trying too hard to show off Selena's musical abilities when he and Vela wrote this song ...&quot; MelÃ©ndez then stated that the song &quot;[is] not right for Selena&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;MelÃ©ndez&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Â¿Las Canciones De Una Reina? |author=Carlos MelÃ©ndez |url= |newspaper=[[El Nuevo DÃ­a]] |date=30 July 1997 |accessdate=10 July 2011|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Julio RamÃ­rez of [[MTV Latin America]] praised the song, while stating that he can spot crossover-potential.&lt;ref name=&quot;Playlist&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= La Musica Del Ano |episodelink= |series=Playlist |serieslink=MTV Latin America#Music shows |credits=Julio RamÃ­rez |network=[[MTV Latin America]] |station= |airdate=26 May 2007 |season= |seriesno= |number= |minutes= |quote= |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On ''[[La Jornada]]'', editor Gabriela Herrera wrote that &quot;El chico del apartamento 512&quot; had showed off Selena's talents as a musical performer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabriela Herrera&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Selena Su Vida En Retrospectiva |author=Gabriela Herrera |url= |newspaper=[[La Jornada]] |date=8 August 1995 |accessdate=10 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
