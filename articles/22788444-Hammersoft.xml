==Regular season==
In head coach [[Lee Rose (basketball)|Lee Rose]]'s first season at Purdue, where he introduced a slowed-down, tempo-controlled style of play, he led the Boilers to a [[Big Ten Conference]] co-title, along with the eventual NCAA Champion, [[Ervin Johnson]]-led [[1978-79 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]] team. With only a 32 team NCAA Tournament field in 1979, the Boilermakers were forced to enter the NIT, instead, due to the favor Michigan State had over Purdue for their head-to-head record on the season. Purdue qualified for the National Invitation Tournament, where they lost to the [[1978-79 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana Hoosiers]] in the tournament finals.
