'''Compton''' is a city in southern [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], [[United States]],&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comptoncity.org/ |title=Comptoncity.org | accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; southeast of downtown [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The city of Compton is one of the oldest cities in the county and on May 11, 1888, was the eighth city to incorporate. The city is considered part of the [[South Los Angeles|South side]] by residents of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=&quot;streetgangs.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetgangs.com/maps/southla_turf.html |title=Gang Maps â Gang Territory Map â South Central Los Angeles |publisher=Streetgangs.com |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a total population of 96,455.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://factfinder.census.gov/servlet/SAFFPopulation?_event=ChangeGeoContext&amp;geo_id=16000US0615044&amp;_geoContext=01000US%7C04000US06%7C16000US0615044&amp;_street=&amp;_county=compton%2C+california&amp;_cityTown=compton%2C+california&amp;_state=&amp;_zip=&amp;_lang=en&amp;_sse=on&amp;ActiveGeoDiv=geoSelect&amp;_useEV=&amp;pctxt=fph&amp;pgsl=010&amp;_submenuId=population_0&amp;ds_name=null&amp;_ci_nbr=null&amp;qr_name=null&amp;reg=null%3Anull&amp;_keyword=&amp;_industry= |title=Compton city, California â Population Finder â American FactFinder |publisher=Factfinder.census.gov |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is known as the &quot;Hub City&quot; due to its geographic centrality in Los Angeles County.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;  Neighborhoods in Compton include: Sunny Cove, Leland, Downtown Compton, and the Richland Farms.

==History==
[[Image:Comption-1914.jpg|thumb|left|Compton, 1914]]
In 1784, the [[Spain|Spanish]] Crown deeded a tract of over {{convert|75,000|acre|km2}} to [[Juan Jose Dominguez]] in this area.  The tract was named [[Rancho San Pedro]].  Dominguez's name was later applied to the [[Dominguez Hills]] community south of Compton.  The tree that marked the original northern boundary of the rancho still stands at the corner of Poppy and Short streets.  The rancho was sub-divided and parcels were sold within the [[Californios]] of [[Alta California]] until the lands were ceded after the [[Mexican-American war]] in 1848. [[United States|American]] [[immigrants]] acquired most of the rancho lands after 1848.

In 1867, Griffith Dickenson Compton led a group of thirty pioneers to the area. These families had traveled by wagon train south from [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], California in search of ways to earn a living other than in the rapid exhaustion of gold fields.  Originally named Gibsonville, after one of the tract owners, it was later called Comptonville.  However, to avoid confusion with the Comptonville located in [[Yuba County]], the name was shortened to Compton.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;  Comptonâs earliest settlers were faced with terrible hardships as they farmed the land in bleak weather to get by with just the barest subsistence.  The weather continued to be harsh, rainy and cold, and fuel was difficult to find.  To gather firewood  it was necessary to travel  to mountains close to [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].  The round trip took almost a week.  Many in the Compton party wanted to relocate to  a friendlier climate and settle down.  But there were only two general stores within traveling distance, one in the pueblo of [[Los Angeles]], the other in [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington]],  so they eventually made the decision to stay put.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;

By 1887, the settlers realized it was time to make improvements to the local government.  A series of town meetings were held to discuss incorporation of their little town. Griffith D. Compton donated his land to incorporate and create the city of Compton in 1889, but he did stipulate that a certain acreage be zoned solely for agriculture and named Richland Farms &lt;ref name=&quot;Comp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kcet.org/socal/departures/richland-farms/the-past/ |title=1 The Past &amp;#124; Departures |publisher=KCET |date=2010-07-23 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 1888, they forwarded a petition supporting the incorporation of Compton to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, who in turn forwarded the petition to the State Legislature. On May 11, 1888 the city of Compton was incorporated, it had a total  population of 500 people.  The first City Council meeting was held on May 14, 1888.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;

The ample residential lots of Richland Farms gave residents enough space to raise a family, and food to feed them, along with building a barn, and caring for livestock. The farms attracted the  black families who had begun migrating from the rural South in the 1950s,  there they found their 'home away from home' in this small community. Compton couldn't support large-scale agricultural business, but it did give the residents the opportunity to work the land for their families and for the welfare of the new community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp&quot;/&gt;

The 1920s saw the opening of the Compton Airport. Compton Junior College was founded and city officials moved to a new City Hall on Alameda Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt; On March 10, 1933, a devastating earthquake  caused many casualties,  schools were destroyed and there was major damage to the central business district.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;  While it would eventually be home to a large number of [[African Americans]], in 1930 there was only one black resident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Horne | first = Gerald | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Fire This Time: The Watts Uprising and the 1960s | publisher = Da Capo Press | year = 1997 | location = New York, New York | page = 27 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-306-80792-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1940s, middle class African-Americans began moving into the area, mostly on the west side. Compton grew quickly in the 1950s.  One reason for this was Compton was close to [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]], where there was an established community  of African Americans.  The eastern side of the city was predominately white until the 1970s.  Despite being located in the middle of a major metropolitan area, thanks to the legacy of Griffith D. Compton, there still remains one small pocket of agriculture from its earliest years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Comp&quot;/&gt;

During the 1950s and 1960s, after the Supreme Court declared all racially exclusive housing covenants (title deeds) unconstitutional in the case [[Shelley v. Kraemer]], the first African American families moved to the area. &lt;ref Name=&quot;black&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/history-of-the-city.htm |title=History of the City &amp;#124; About Compton |publisher=Comptoncity.org |date=1933-03-10 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton's growing African American population was still largely ignored and neglected by the city's elected officials.  [[Centennial High School (Compton, California)|Centennial High School]] was finally built to accommodate a burgeoning student population. &lt;ref Name=&quot;black&quot;/&gt; At one time, the City Council even discussed dismantling the Compton Police Department in favor of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] in an attempt to exclude blacks from law enforcement jobs.   This slowly began to change when, in 1958, the first African-American ran for a City Council seat. However, it would be another three years before an African-American would actually be elected to the City Council in 1961. &lt;ref Name=&quot;black&quot;/&gt;
[[Image:Comption-1920.jpg|thumb|right|Aerial view of Compton, 1920]]

[[Douglas Dollarhide]] made history in Compton in 1969 when he became [[California]]'s first African-American mayor of a metropolitan city. &lt;ref Name=&quot;black&quot;/&gt;  Two African-Americans and one Mexican-American were also elected to the local school board. &lt;ref Name=&quot;black&quot;/&gt; Four years later, in 1973, [[Doris A. Davis]] defeated Dollarhide's bid for re-election to become the first [[African-American]] female mayor of a metropolitan city in the [[United States]]. By the early 1970s, the city had one of the largest concentrations of African-Americans in the country with over ninety percent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

For many years, Compton was a much sought after neighborhood for the black middle class of Los Angeles. Now, only a few areas of Compton are still middle class communities. This past affluence is reflected in the area's appearance â Compton's streets are lined with relatively spacious and attractive single family homes. However, several factors have contributed to Compton's decline. One of the most significant factors was a steady erosion of its tax base. First by [[white flight|whites who fled]] to the newly incorporated cities of [[Artesia, California|Artesia]], [[Bellflower, California|Bellflower]], [[Cerritos, California|Cerritos]], [[Paramount, California|Paramount]] and [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] in the late 1950s. These nearby communities remained largely white early on despite [[Racial integration|integration]].&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Allen John and Edward Soja (1996). ''The City: Los Angeles and Urban Theory at the End of the Twentieth Century'' Berkeley: University of California Press. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This move was even further precipitated after the [[Watts Riots]] in 1965 and [[1992 Los Angeles riots]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Post Store |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2005/08/12/DI2005081201348.html |title=Outlook: The Negative Impact of the Watts Riots |publisher=washingtonpost.com |date= 2005-08-15|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon, middle class blacks also found other areas more attractive to them. Some were unincorporated areas of [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] such as [[Ladera Heights, California|Ladera Heights]], [[View Park-Windsor Hills, California|View Park]] and [[View Park-Windsor Hills, California|Windsor Hills]]; and others were cities such as [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and, particularly, [[Carson, California|Carson]]. The latter was significant because it had successfully thwarted attempts at [[annexation]] by neighboring Compton. The city of Carson opted instead for incorporation in 1968, which is notable because its black population was actually more affluent than its white population. As a newer city, it also offered more favorable tax rates and lower crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ci.carson.ca.us/content/department/about_carson/growing_pains.asp |title=Growing Pains of a Young City â City of Carson, CA |publisher=Ci.carson.ca.us |accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Although Compton is still often thought of as a primarily black community, [[Latinos]] are the largest ethnic group in the city. A possible reason for this misconception is, despite the shift in population, many [[African American]] professional athletes and rappers are originally from Compton. Also, African Americans continue to dominate local politics, holding most elected positions in the city. Although an [[Inner suburbs|inner suburb]] of Los Angeles, Compton has seen an increase of middle-class residents in the last few years, due to its affordable housing and a reduction in crime. With the influx of immigrants and the demographic shift in ethnic population, it was after the 2000 [[U.S. Census]] Latinos were recognized as the majority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/history-of-the-city.htm |title=History of the City &amp;#124; About Compton |publisher=Comptoncity.org |date=1933-03-10 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton has been referenced on numerous occasions in [[gang]] affiliation, [[gangsta rap]] and [[g-funk]] songs, especially in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and so has attained an association not only with gang violence and crime, but with [[hip hop music]] as well. The city is known as the home of many famous rappers. (see list [[List of people from Compton, California#Arts and entertainment]])  Compton has evolved into a younger community, the median age of people living in Compton, was 25 at the time of the last full census survey; the United States average at the time was 35.3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americantowns.com/ca/compton-information |title=Compton California (CA) Census and detailed community profile |publisher=AmericanTowns.com |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some episodes of the [[sitcom]] ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]'' took place in Compton because [[Will Smith]]'s friend Jazz lived there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/the-fresh-prince-of-bel-air |title=The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air: Information from |publisher=Answers.com |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Many well-known [[NBA]] players attended high school in the city as well. [[DeMar DeRozan]] attended Compton High School, and [[Tayshaun Prince]], [[Tyson Chandler]] and [[Brandon Jennings]] attended Dominguez High.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Compton has a growing [[Pacific Islander American|Pacific Islander]], [[Filipino American|Filipino]], and [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] community. West Compton and unincorporated Willowbrook have more middle class [[African American]]s than the central city (west of Alameda St.) and unincorporated East Compton, the latter of which has a higher number of Hispanics and working-class African Americans. Lower-income subsections on Compton Boulevard have many businesses owned by Latinos.

==Crime==
Compton's violent reputation was popularized in the late 1980s by the rise to prominence of local [[gangsta rap]] groups [[Compton's Most Wanted]] and especially [[N.W.A.]], who released the famous album ''[[Straight Outta Compton]]'' in 1988.  The city used to be notorious for [[gang violence]], primarily caused by the [[Bloods]], the [[Crips]], and [[SureÃ±os]] gangs that are allied with the Mexican [[drug cartels]].  Crime rates had been falling for years following the [[crack epidemic]] of the 1980s and early 1990s.

Crime, though present in lesser degrees beforehand, worsened significantly with the introduction of [[crack (cocaine)|crack cocaine]] in the latter part of the 20th century. The neighborhood lost wealthy residents, with the worsening safety problems, and, after the [[1992 Los Angeles riots|1992 riots]] in the [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles metropolitan area]], many [[African Americans]] left the city. Meanwhile, many Latino and other immigrant families moved into Compton, including [[Samoans]], [[Tongans]], [[Koreans]], [[Filipino American|Filipinos]], [[Belizeans]] and [[East Africa]]ns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comptoncity.org/index.php/About-Compton/demographic-information.htm |title=Demographic Information &amp;#124; About Compton |publisher=Comptoncity.org |date=1991-12-03 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton had 76 murders in 2005, which is significantly higher than the national average on a per capita basis. That same year, in an effort to combat [[gun violence]], the citizens of Compton were given the option to hand over their guns to the police and receive a $50â$100 check for various goods, called the Gifts for Guns Program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/dec/09/local/me-gifts-for-guns9 |title=Residents turn in guns in Compton â Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=2008-12-09 |accessdate=2010-08-12 | first=Kate | last=Linthicum}}&lt;/ref&gt; People have turned in about 7,000 guns over the last few years, [[KABC-TV]] reported. The program's success has prompted the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department|LASD]] to expand the program county-wide.&lt;ref name=&quot;SD&quot;&gt;Compton Sheriff's Station 2009 Year in review publication&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2006, Compton deployed twice as many [[sheriff|sheriff's deputies]] and the murder rate has steadily decreased in the last decade.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.idcide.com/citydata/ca/compton.htm |title=Compton Profile &amp;#124; Compton CA &amp;#124; Population, Crime, Map |publisher=Idcide.com |accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compton's [[property crime]] levels tend to be about the same as the average California city. The same data shows [[violent crime]], including arson, levels in Compton tend to be higher than California's average level.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; However, recent reports show that Compton's violent crime rate has been reduced by 30% over the last ten years.&lt;ref&gt;NBC News, 12-11-02&lt;/ref&gt;  

Although the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] does not even list Compton in the &quot;The 11 Most Dangerous Cities&quot; for overall crime rates in the United States,&lt;ref&gt; http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2011/02/16/the-11-most-dangerous-cities &lt;/ref&gt;, it contrasts the CQ Press, using data from the [[Crime in the United States|FBI's annual report of crime statistics]] &quot;Crime in the United States 2010,&quot; ranked Compton as the 8th most dangerous city in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime/2010/City_crime_rate_2010-2011_hightolow.pdf |title=AMSAFC2.WK4 |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Statistics will vary depending on how property crimes and violent crimes are weighted in each statistical survey.  See [[Statistical variability]]

In 2010, Compton Station area homicides were reduced by about 38 percent, with 26 homicides in 2010, compared with 42 homicides in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS1&quot;&gt;http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2011/01/17/homicides-dip-16-percent-in-compton-la-county/&lt;/ref&gt;   This number is a 53 percent decrease from five years ago, and was the lowest number of homicides since 1972.  The sheriffâs department reported: Taking into consideration the population changes, last year showed the lowest homicide rate since 1965.  Property crimes also decreased.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS1&quot;/&gt;

==Compton Cricket Club==
{{Main|Compton Cricket Club}}
[[Image:UmbroCCC.jpg|thumb|right|Umbro photographs The Compton CC in South Central LA, February 2009]]
The [[Compton Cricket Club]] (CCC), nicknamed &quot;The Homies &amp; the POPz&quot;, has also been christened &quot;America's Team&quot; and the &quot;US Ambassadors of Good Will and Peace in the sporting world of [[Cricket]].&quot;  At this time, the CCC is the only exhibition cricket team in the world that totally consists of North American-born players. 

&quot;The aim of playing cricket is to teach people how to respect themselves and respect authority, so they stop killing each other,&quot; says team founder, Ted Hayes. Their mission is &quot;to curb the negative effects of gang activities amongst the youth of Compton, [[South Central Los Angeles]], and all inner cities, and to address homelessness through the principles and ethics of cricket.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.comptoncricketclub.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  

The team has traveled to [[England]] and [[Australia]] and has collaborated with several charities during its exhibition tour raising money for Australian flood victims. Due to financial difficulties in building a [[cricket pitch]] in Compton, the team utilizes various fields in the [[Greater Los Angeles Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12382224 | work=BBC News | title=LA cricket: Club helps tame Compton's mean streets | date=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Lionel Cade]], an accountant, assumed the mayor's office in 1977, one of the first orders of business was to conduct an audit of the city's finances. It was discovered that the city was $2 million in debt. The administration was able to eliminate the huge deficit in one year by making cuts in every department. It also aggressively sought federal funding to help pay for essential services, which was at least partially effective. However, with the passage of the property tax cutting initiative [[Proposition 13]] by California voters, Compton was one of the cities hardest hit, since it had already eliminated most of the fat from its budget.&lt;ref&gt;William A.

==City government controversies==
Civic [[Political corruption|corruption]] has also been a widespread problem in Compton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990/oct/25 | work=The Los Angeles Times | title=Popular Articles &amp; Stories for October 25, 1990 â Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1990s, United States Attorney [[Joey Chin]] conducted a series of investigations, centered on a phony [[waste-to-energy]] scheme, that ultimately ensnared a number of prominent elected officials.

In 2000, the [[Compton Police Department]] was disbanded amidst controversy and charges of corruption.  The police department claims it was disbanded after investigations of gang activity led to then-Compton Mayor [[Omar Bradley (California politician)|Omar Bradley]].  Once this became public, the mayor charged it was the police who were themselves corrupt, and he disbanded the police department.  Omar Bradley has since faced serious corruption charges.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.blackpressusa.com/news/Article.asp?SID=3&amp;Title=National+News&amp;NewsID=2776 Former Compton Mayor among Five Officials Arrested after Probe]. ''BlackPressUSA''&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the situation, an alternative form of law enforcement was sought. Compton's policing needs are currently served by the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]].

Eric J. Perrodin, the city's current mayor, was investigated in 2007 by the California State Bar for threatening to violate a local newspaper's first amendment rights after the paper printed an investigative report relative to a contract granted to one of Perrodin's associates. Following the report, Perrodin threatened to yank the city's advertising contract with the paper&lt;ref&gt;([http://www.metnews.com/articles/2006/bull063006.htm District Attorneyâs Office Probing Prosecutor Over Alleged Threats]. &quot;Metropolitan News-Enterprise&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  A Times review of city records shows Perrodin was absent from city board and commission meetings nearly two-thirds of the time between July 2009 and July 2010.&lt;ref name=AP &gt;[http://www.cbs47.tv/news/state/story/Compton-council-fires-city-manager-again/4Nq3ekEo_0OkZND1KLIGAw.cspx?rss=154 Compton council fires city manager again â KGPE CBS47 News, Sports &amp; Weather for the Central Valley]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current recall efforts are a direct response from residents of the accusations of corruption of the city's mayor and council. Some of the accusations involve the issuing of city contracts to personal donors and friends. One particular accusation involved the trash and recycling contract of the city to Pacific Coast Waste and Recycling LLC in 2007,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecomptonbulletin.com/series1/index.html The Compton Bulletin Online â LOCAL NEWS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose leadership donated large amounts of money to Perrodin's political coffers.

Notices of intent to circulate recall petitions against four Compton city officials are expected to be filed  in August 2010, by a group of citizens who claim corruption in Compton is being ignored by the same authorities who were shocked  by the recent salary controversy  in the city of [[Bell, California|Bell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=By BETTY PLEASANT, Contributing Editor |url=http://www.wavenewspapers.com/opinion/Bottom-Line-In-Compton-recall-paperwork-soon-to-land-on-the-desks-of-top-city-officials-101040384.html |title=Bottom Line: In Compton, recall paperwork soon to land on the desks of top city officials &amp;#124; Los Angeles Wave â Community News, Sports &amp; Entertainment &amp;#124; Opinion |publisher=Wavenewspapers.com |date=2010-08-18 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compton has discharged its city manager for the second time in three years. ''The Los Angeles Times'' says the City Council voted in a closed meeting, September 9, 2010, to fire Charles Evans. ''The Times'' says council members refused to discuss the reasons for their decision. Evans took office in 2007, after the dismissal of previous City Manager Barbara Kilroy. City Controller Willie Norfleet will take over until a permanent manager can be named.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;
