'''''Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic''''' is a [[remix album]] by [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] (his stage name at that time being an unpronounceable symbol), released via mail exclusively through the [[NPG Music Club]], an Internet subscription service, on April 29, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Moss| first = Corey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = Prince Offers Fans Exclusive Material Via Online Club| work = MTV.com| publisher = | date = February 9, 2001| url = http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1439259/20010209/prince.jhtml| format = | doi = | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The album is an alternative version of ''[[Rave Un2 the Joy Fantastic]]'', released the previous year.

The album makes a number of alterations to its predecessor. One track (&quot;Rave In2 the Joy Fantastic&quot;) is a brand new version, with altered lyrics and a faster tempo. Four &quot;Undisputed (The Moneyappolis Mix)&quot;, &quot;[[The Greatest Romance Ever Sold]]&quot;, &quot;Hot Wit U (Nasty Girl Remix)&quot; and &quot;Man'O'War (Remix)&quot;) have been remixed or had substantial musical elements added or removed. Three tracks (&quot;Tangerine&quot;, &quot;Baby Knows&quot; and &quot;Prettyman&quot;) are mostly unchanged, save for slightly longer tag endings, or extended jams at the end. Five are unchanged (&quot;So Far, So Pleased&quot;, &quot;I Love U, but I Don't Trust U Anymore&quot;, &quot;Silly Game&quot;, &quot;Whatever U Do, Wherever U Go&quot;, &quot;The Sun, the Moon and Stars&quot;). Lastly, two tracks, &quot;Strange but True&quot; and &quot;[[Everyday Is a Winding Road]]&quot;, have been removed and replaced by the moody &quot;Beautiful Strange&quot;, a previously unreleased track written in 1998.

As it was released via the fan-centric NPG Music Club, the album received virtually no attention from wider media. However, with several improved songs, the removal of two weaker tracks, and the addition of &quot;Beautiful Strange&quot;, one of the album's highlights, fans generally consider ''Rave In2 The Joy Fantastic'' to be superior to its predecessor.
