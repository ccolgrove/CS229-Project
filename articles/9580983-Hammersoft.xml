The team would finish 7-2 that year [http://www.valpo.edu/athletics/assets/mediaguides/MBB-2006-2007-01.pdf]. In 1988, Homer Drew took the job as head coach and remained until retiring in May 2011. He was then succeeded by his son Bryce. 1988 would also be the year that the Crusaders defeated Number 19 Notre Dame in a game that came to be known as &quot;The Lutheran Miracle.&quot;

===The tallest team===
The [[1944 in sports|1944]]-[[1945 in sports|1945]] team was billed as &quot;The World's Tallest Team.&quot;[http://www.valpo.edu/athletics/assets/mediaguides/MBB-2006-2007-01.pdf] That year, they defeated [[Long Island University]] in a game played in [[Madison Square Garden]].

===Conference affiliation===
The Crusaders would join the [[Indiana Collegiate Conference]] for the [[1950 in sports|1950]]-[[1951 in sports|1951]] season. The Crusaders advanced to the NCAA tournament for the first time in [[1961 in sports|1961]]-[[1962 in sports|1962]]. In [[1968 in sports|1968]]-[[1969 in sports|1969]], they hosted an NCAA tournament game for the first time.
