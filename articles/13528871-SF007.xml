'''Nina Sky''' is an [[United States|American]] musical duo composed of [[identical twins]] '''Nicole''' and '''Natalie Albino''' (born March 13, 1984).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ninaskyhigh.com/blog/2011/03/the-birthday-rundown/ Nina Sky - Your Favorite Twins]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Albino's parents moved to [[New York]] from [[Puerto Rico]] and were divorced when the girls were younger. They were born in [[Queens, New York|Queens]] and grew up in Astoria, New York in a place called Marine Terrace 

Because their stepfather worked as a DJ, the twins were influenced by different types of [[music]]. When the sisters were only 7 years old, they wrote their first song, &quot;Sisters&quot;, and by the time they were 10, they already knew that they wanted to become singers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Artist&quot;&gt;[http://www.everblazin.net/_artistes_detail.php?p=artistdetail&amp;id=20 Artists]&lt;/ref&gt;

The twins' parents were very supportive of their daughters' ambitions. Their stepfather even gave them [[guitar]] and [[drum]] lessons. They were taken to [[audition]]s and, on some occasions, they even performed on some showcases. The sisters wanted to devise a name of their own. In using the first two [[syllable]]s of their names (&quot;Ni&quot; and &quot;Na&quot;), they came up with Nina. They then added Sky, which for them represented &quot;the sky's the limit&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dominicantimes.com/news.php?nid=425 Dominican Times]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004â2006: ''Nina Sky''===
In 2004, The Jettsonz introduced the girls to [[Cipha Sounds]], a [[hip hop music|hip hop]] DJ under the [[Star Trak Entertainment|Star Trak label]] owned by [[The Neptunes]] ([[Pharrell]] and [[Chad Hugo]]). Cipha Sounds was impressed when he heard the girls sing and suggested that they use the &quot;Coolie Dance&quot; [[riddim]]. The twins then proceeded to write &quot;Move Ya Body&quot; (along with The Jettsonz, who also produced the record), mixing [[Caribbean]], R&amp;B, and pop rhythms.  Eventually, a [[Demo (music)|demo]] of the song was made. The demo fell into the hands of Eddie O'Loughlin, the president of Next Plateau Entertainment  (which is a division of [[Universal Records]]). O'Loughlin signed the twins to a contract and they started working on their debut album.

The single &quot;[[Move Ya Body]]&quot; was released on April 27, 2004 and reached number 17 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart. Urban music and rhythmic top 40 stations quickly added the song to their play lists, sending the song up the charts. By July 17, &quot;Move Ya Body&quot; had gone to the top 5 on both sides of the Atlantic and had also reached the top 5 of a world combined R&amp;B chart based on the US, UK, Germany, France and Australia. The song had also reached the top 50 of the Australian charts. On June 29, 2004 they released their first [[Nina Sky (album)|self-titled album]], featuring [[Betty Wright]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://music.yahoo.com/ar-308196---Nina-Sky Nina Sky on Yahoo]&lt;/ref&gt;

The twins, Natalie and Nicole continued to work and promote their music. They have contributed to the [[reggaeton]] movement with songs such as &quot;[[Oye Mi Canto]]&quot;, and &quot;[[MÃ¡s MaÃ­z]]&quot; with artist and producer [[N.O.R.E.]] They were also featured artist on Sean Paul's song &quot;Connection&quot; from his album &quot;The Trinity&quot;

===2007âpresent: second album and ''The Other Side''===

Nina Sky collaborated with French singer Kenza Farah for the song &quot;Celle Qu'Il Te Faut&quot;, and was released in both French and English versions. The video was shot in New York.

Nina Sky was recording on their second studio album, ''[[Starting Today]]''. The album was originally due on July 27, 2007. Producers include [[Stereotypes (producers)|Stereotypes]], Bruno &amp; Phil, [[Neo da Matrix]], [[Ryan Leslie]], [[Salaam Remi]], and more. Guests include [[Rick Ross]] and others that have yet to be announced. In late 2007, Nina Sky left their label, Universal, and signed with [[Polo Grounds Music]]/[[J Records]].

Nina Sky have also put together remixes of popular songs including [[J. Holiday]]'s &quot;[[Bed]],&quot; [[Elliott Yamin]]'s &quot;[[Wait For You]]&quot;, [[Cassidy (rapper)|Cassidy]]'s &quot;[[My Drink n My 2 Step]], and [[The-Dream]]'s [[I Love Your Girl]]&quot; They have also worked with Brooklyn MC [[Red Cafe]] on his street album ''The Co-Op'', and [[The Alchemist (producer)|The Alchemist]] on his song &quot;Key To The City&quot;

Nina Sky recently appeared on [[Major Lazer]]'s album, [[Guns Don't Kill People... Lazers Do]].  They are currently in a battle with their record company [[Polo Grounds Music|Polo Grounds Records]], over the release of their new album &quot;Starting Today&quot;.  They have said they want to be released from their contract with the label because the label no longer supports them.&lt;ref&gt;http://neonlimelight.com/2010/03/11/nina-sky-ask-fans-to-help-them-get-out-of-record-contract/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Nicole Albino revealed she was openly [[lesbian|homosexual]] and married female fashion designer, Erin Magee.&lt;ref name=&quot;inkedmagazine&quot;&gt;http://www.inkedmag.com/inked-people/erin-magee.html&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had dated since 2009; in an interview with ''Inked Magazine'', Magee revealed that she had her last name legally changed to Nicole's and had gotten a tattoo of the name across her right breast.&lt;ref name=&quot;inkedmagazine&quot;/&gt;

With a new masculine (and as the public termed &quot;butched up&quot;) style, the duo independently released an 8 track EP for digital download in August, entitled &quot;The Other Side&quot;, which features production from [[DJ Yonny]], Salaam Remi, Kidz in the Hall &amp; many more. A video for the lead-single, &quot;[[You Ain't Got It (Funk That)]]&quot; was also released. In early 2011 they worked with Creep on their song 'You'. On May 16, they released the music video on their official website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ninaskyhigh.com/blog/2011/05/video-premier-us-x-creep-you/?sms_ss=twitter&amp;at_xt=4dd135a8af8c440d%2C0&lt;/ref&gt;

They have recently confirmed that a new EP is in the works.
