As Ellis works to undermine their police work and damage the victim's credibility, the detectives take the stand to prove they have more than just a he-said, she-said case.
* When Sgt. Munch introduces himself in the squad room, Andre Braugher's character comments: &quot;Have we met?&quot; This is a reference to the fact that Braugher played opposite Richard Belzer's character Munch for six seasons on ''Homicide: Life on the Street.'' &quot;It's kind of funny because Munch has been in both of these worlds, and here I am basically in Munch's world appearing as someone else, so there's a cute little meet and greet,&quot; Braugher told ''TV Guide.'' &quot;I say 'Have we met?'
