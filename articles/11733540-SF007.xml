'''Netscape Messenger''' is a standalone, multiplatform [[email client|e-mail]] and [[news client]] that was developed by [[Netscape]]. Announced on June 11, 2007 as ''Netscape Mercury'', the program was intended to accompany the [[web browser]] [[Netscape Navigator 9]], and was based on [[Mozilla]]'s [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?tsn=1&amp;nav=messages&amp;webtag=ws-nscpbrowser&amp;tid=8688 Netscape Mercury in progress] Retrieved on 2007-06-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The original name ''Mercury'' was named after the [[Roman mythology|Roman]] god [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the messenger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.netscape.com/n/pfx/forum.aspx?msg=8692.4&amp;nav=messages&amp;webtag=ws-nscpbrowser#a4 Feature requests in Mercury] Retrieved on 2007-06-12&lt;/ref&gt;) It replaced the former [[Netscape Mail &amp; Newsgroups]] client included in versions 4 to 7.2.

On November 15, 2007, the alpha was released for [[Linux]], [[Mac OS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.netscape.com/2007/11/15/netscape-messenger-9-alpha-1-released/ Netscape Blog on Netscape Messenger 9.a] Retrieved on 2007-11-16&lt;/ref&gt;
