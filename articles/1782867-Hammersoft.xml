Ianevski was born in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]] and has lived in [[England]] (for five years)&lt;ref name=ref&gt;[http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=55852 Stanislav Ianevski: Proud to be Bulgarian&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comingsoon.net/news/topnews.php?id=10507 The New Blood From Goblet of Fire - Coming Soon.net&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snitchseeker.com/harry-potter-news/stanislav-ianevski-sugar-magazine-29429/ Stanislav Ianevski in Sugar Magazine - SnitchSeeker.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; While attending [[Mill Hill School]] in the [[United Kingdom]], Ianevski had no particular acting aspirations and was not a drama student. He had only auditioned for ''[[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (film)|Harry Potter]]'' after being spotted by [[Fiona Weir]], a casting director who prompted him to attend an acting workshop, which resulted in his casting as [[Viktor Krum]], a [[Bulgaria]]n character in the [[Harry Potter]] series. He was selected from 600 others, most of whom had auditioned in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]]. [[Harry Melling (actor)|Harry Melling]], who played the part of [[Dudley Dursley]], attended Mill Hill School at the same time.

Ianevski's casting was announced in June 2004. During filming, he befriended fellow ''Harry Potter'' actors [[Robert Pattinson]] and [[Emma Watson]]. He also starred in ''[[Hostel 2]]'', the sequel to [[Eli Roth]]'s film ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]''. He reprised his role as Viktor Krum in ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (films)|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]'' Part 1.&lt;ref name=krum-doge-tlc&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.the-leaky-cauldron.org/2009/7/19/deathly-hallows-updates-stan-as-krum-returns-doge-is-cast-and-more|title=Deathly Hallows Updates: Krum Returns, Doge is Cast and More|date=2009-07-19|accessdate=2009-07-20|publisher=The Leaky Cauldron}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his sequences were cut from the final product, despite appearing in several photos.
