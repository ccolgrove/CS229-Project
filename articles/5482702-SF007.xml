Microsoft Digital Image came in three different editions: ''Digital Image Standard'', which offered tools for editing images, ''Digital Image Suite'', which added ''Digital Image Library'' for organizing images and ''Digital Image Suite Plus'', which included tools from Digital Image Suite and the video editing tools of [[Pinnacle Studio]]. Digital Image has support for [[Adobe Photoshop]] [[Photoshop plugin|plugins]]. Later versions also included [[Photo Story]] 3.1.
