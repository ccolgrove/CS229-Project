'''Arizona''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Arizona.ogg|Ã¦r|Éª|Ë|z|oÊ|n|É}} ({{lang-nv|Hoozdo Hahoodzo}}; [[O'odham language|O'odham]]: AlÄ­ á¹£onak); is a state located in the [[Southwestern United States|southwestern region]] of the United States. It is also part of the western United States and the [[Mountain States|mountain west]]. The capital and largest city is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The second largest city is [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]], followed [[List of cities in Arizona (by population)|in size]] by eight [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] cities: [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]], [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]] and then by [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] in Yuma County.

Arizona is the 48th state and last of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] admitted to the Union, achieving statehood on February 14, 1912. Arizona is noted for its [[desert]] climate, exceptionally hot summers, and mild winters, but it also features [[pine]] forests and mountain ranges in the northern high country, with much cooler weather than in the lower deserts.

Arizona is one of the [[Four Corners]] states. It borders [[New Mexico]], [[Utah]], [[Nevada]], and California, touches [[Colorado]], and has a {{convert|389|mi|adj=on}} [[Border|international border]] with the states of [[Sonora]] and [[Baja California]] in Mexico. It is the largest landlocked U.S. state by population. In addition to the [[Grand Canyon National Park|Grand Canyon]], many other [[United States National Forest|national forests]], [[National parks (United States)|parks]], and [[National parks (United States)|monuments]] are located in the state, while more than a quarter&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sheppardsoftware.com/usaweb/snapshot/Arizona.htm All about Arizona]. http://www.sheppardsoftware.com. Retrieved 2010-09-21.&lt;/ref&gt; of its territory is Federal Trust Land which serves as the home of the [[Navajo Nation]], the [[Hopi Reservation|Hopi tribe]], the [[Tohono O'odham]], [[Apache]] and [[Yaqui people|Yaqui]] people and various [[Yuman languages|Yuman]] tribes, such as the [[Yavapai people|Yavapai]], [[Quechan people|Quechan]] and [[Hualapai people|Hualapai]].

==Etymology==

The general consensus is that the name of the state comes from an earlier Spanish name, ''Arizonac'', derived from the [[O'odham language|O'odham]] name ''{{unicode|alÄ­ á¹£onak}}'' meaning &quot;small spring&quot;, which initially applied only to an area near the Mexican silver mining camp of [[Planchas de Plata, Sonora]]&lt;ref&gt;Bright, William (2004). ''Native American Place Names of the United States''. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, pg. 47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi | 10.2307/1496233 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Arizona|title=Arizona|last=Harper|first=Douglas|publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]|accessdate=2011-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McClintock, James (1916). ''Arizona, Prehistoric, Aboriginal, Pioneer, Modern: The Nationâs Youngest Commonwealth within a Land of Ancient Culture''. Chicago: The S.J. Clarke Publishing Co.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by the fact that that area is still known as ''{{unicode|alÄ­ á¹£onak}}'' in the O'odham language.&lt;ref&gt;Saxton, Dean, Saxton, Lucille, &amp; Enos, Susie. (1983). ''Dictionary: Tohono O'odham/Pima to English, English to Tohono O'odham/Pima''. Tucson, AZ: The University of Arizona Press&lt;/ref&gt; Other possible origins that have been proposed are the Spanish phrase 'Ã¡rida zona' (arid zone), shortened to Arizona or the [[Basque language|Basque]] phrase ''aritz ona'', &quot;the good oak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/columns/articles/0225clay0225.html |title=A sorry state of affairs when views change |publisher=[[Arizona Republic]] |accessdate=2007-03-03 |author=Thompson, Clay |date=2007-02-25| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QltB6Exf | archivedate = 2007-08-01| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://test.ahs.state.az.us/story/mar/az_name.htm |title=How Arizona did NOT Get its Name |publisher=Arizona Historical Society |accessdate=2007-03-03 |author=Jim Turner|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5QmUx03F4 |archivedate = 2007-08-01|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Donald Garate, 2005, &quot;Arizonac, a twentieth-century myth&quot;, ''Journal of Arizona History'' 46(2), pp. 161â184&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==

[[File:Saguaro Sunset.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Saguaro at Sunset from Saguaro National Park Rincon District east of Tucson, Arizona]]

{{Main|Geography of Arizona}}

: ''See also lists of [[List of counties in Arizona|counties]], [[List of islands of Arizona|islands]], [[List of rivers of Arizona|rivers]], [[List of lakes in Arizona|lakes]], [[List of Arizona state parks|state parks]], [[List of National Parks of the United States|national parks]], and [[List of U.S. National Forests|national forests]].

Arizona is located in the Southwestern United States as one of the [[Four Corners]] states. Arizona is the sixth [[List of U.S. states and territories by area|largest state in area]], after [[New Mexico]] and before [[Nevada]]. Of the state's {{convert|113998|sqmi|km2|-3}}, approximately 15% is privately owned. The remaining area is public forest and park land, state trust land and Native American reservations.

Arizona is best known for its [[desert]] [[landscape]], which is rich in [[xerophyte]] plants such as the [[cactus]]. It is also known for its climate, which presents exceptionally hot summers and mild winters. Less well known is the pine-covered high country of the [[Colorado Plateau]] in the north-central portion of the state, which contrasts with the desert [[Basin and Range Province|Basin and Range]] region in the southern portions of the state (see [[Arizona Mountains forests]]).

[[File:MOGOLLONRIM AZ17.jpg|thumb|left|175px|View from [[Mogollon Rim]]]]

Like other states of the [[Southwestern U.S.|Southwest]], Arizona has an abundance of topographical characteristics in addition to its [[desert]] climate. Mountains and [[plateaus]] are found in more than half of the state. Despite the state's aridity, 27% of Arizona is forest,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardwoodforest.org/hff.asp?ID1=Experience&amp;ID2=Arizona |title=Hardwood Forest Foundation: Experience: Arizona |publisher=Hardwoodforest.org |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a percentage comparable to modern day France or Germany. The largest stand in the world of [[Ponderosa pine]] trees is contained in Arizona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/project/wildfire/Arizona/prescott/prescott.html |title=Prescott Overview |publisher=Ncsu.edu |date=2002-05-15 |accessdate=2010-07-25| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4yfCYq | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mogollon Rim]], a {{convert|1998|ft|adj=on}} [[escarpment]], cuts across the central section of the state and marks the southwestern edge of the Colorado Plateau, where the state experienced its [[Rodeo-Chediski fire|second worst forest fire ever]] in 2002.

Arizona belongs firmly within the Basin and Range region of North America. The region was shaped by prehistoric [[volcanism]], followed by the cooling-off and related [[subsidence]].
[[File:USA 09847 Grand Canyon Luca Galuzzi 2007.jpg|left|175px|thumb|[[Grand Canyon]]]]

The [[Grand Canyon]] is a colorful, steep-sided [[gorge]], carved by the [[Colorado River (U.S.)|Colorado River]], in northern Arizona. The canyon is one of the [[Seven Natural Wonders of the World|seven natural wonders of the world]] and is largely contained in the [[Grand Canyon National Park]]âone of the first [[national parks]] in the United States. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] was a major proponent of designating the Grand Canyon area, visiting on numerous occasions to hunt [[mountain lion]] and enjoy the scenery.

The canyon was created by the [[Colorado River]] cutting a channel over millions of years, and is about {{convert|277|mi}} long, ranges in width from {{convert|4|to|18|mi|0}} and attains a depth of more than {{convert|1|mi}}. Nearly 2&amp;nbsp;billion years of the [[Earth]]'s history have been exposed as the Colorado River and its tributaries cut through layer after layer of [[sediment]] as the [[Colorado Plateau]]s have uplifted.

[[File:Meteor.jpg|left|thumb|175px|[[Meteor Crater]]]]

Arizona is home to one of the most well-preserved meteorite impact sites in the world. The Barringer Meteorite Crater (better known simply as &quot;[[Meteor Crater]]&quot;) is a gigantic hole in the middle of the high plains of the Colorado Plateau, about {{convert|25|mi|km}} west of [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]]. A rim of smashed and jumbled boulders, some of them the size of small houses, rises {{convert|150|ft|m}} above the level of the surrounding plain. The crater itself is nearly 1&amp;nbsp;mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) wide, and {{convert|570|ft|m}} deep.

Arizona is one of two states that does not observe [[Daylight Saving Time]], except in the [[Navajo Nation]], located in the northeastern region of the state. The other state is [[Hawaii]].

===Climate===
[[File:Grand Canyon Horse Shoe Bend MC.jpg|thumb|The Horseshoe Bend of the [[Colorado River]]]]
Due to its large area and variations in elevation the state has a wide variety of localized climate conditions. In the lower elevations, the climate is primarily desert, with mild winters and hot summers. Typically, from late fall to early spring, the weather is mild, averaging a minimum of {{convert|60|F}}. November through February are the coldest months with temperatures typically ranging from 40â75&amp;nbsp;Â°F (4â24&amp;nbsp;Â°C), although occasional [[frost]]s are not uncommon. About midway through February, the temperatures start to rise again with warm days, and cool breezy nights. The summer months of June through September bring a dry heat ranging from 90â128&amp;nbsp;Â°F (32â53&amp;nbsp;Â°C), with occasional high temperatures exceeding {{convert|128|F}} having been observed in the desert area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrcc.dri.edu/narratives/ARIZONA.htm |title=Arizona Climate |date=2001-12-07| accessdate=2011-05-26 |publisher=Desert Research Institute, Western Regional Climate Center, Reno, Nevada }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona's all time record high is {{convert|128|F|C}} recorded at [[Lake Havasu City, Arizona|Lake Havasu City]] on June 29, 1994 and July 5, 2007; the all time record low of {{convert|-40|F|C}} was recorded at [[Hawley Lake, Arizona|Hawley Lake]] on January 7, 1971.

Due to the primarily dry climate, large temperature swings often occur between day and night in less developed areas of the desert. The swings can be as large as {{nowrap|50&amp;nbsp;Â°F}} ({{nowrap|28&amp;nbsp;Â°C}}) in the summer months. In the state's urban centers, the effects of [[urban heat island|local warming]] result in much higher measured nighttime lows than in the recent past.

Arizona has an average annual rainfall of {{convert|12.7|in|mm|sigfig=3}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This hot moisture brings [[lightning]], [[thunderstorm]]s, wind, and torrential, if usually brief, downpours. These downpours often cause [[flash flood]]s, which can turn deadly. In an attempt to deter drivers from crossing flooding streams, the [[Arizona Legislature]] enacted the [[Stupid Motorist Law]]. It is rare for [[tornado]]es and [[List of Arizona hurricanes|hurricanes]] to occur in Arizona, but there are records of both occurring.

The northern third of Arizona is a [[plateau]] at significantly higher altitudes than the lower desert, and has an appreciably cooler climate, with cold winters and mild summers. Extreme cold temperatures are not unknown; cold air systems from the northern states and Canada occasionally push into the state, bringing temperatures below {{convert|0|F}} to the Northern parts of the state.

Indicative of the variation in climate, Arizona is the state which has both the metropolitan area with the most days over {{convert|100|F}} ([[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]), and the metropolitan area in the lower 48 states with nearly the most days with a low temperature below freezing ([[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/online/ccd/min32temp.html |title='&amp;#39;Mean number of Days with Minimum Temperature Below 32F'&amp;#39; National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, Retrieved March 24, 2007 |publisher=Lwf.ncdc.noaa.gov |date=2008-08-20 |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main|History of Arizona}}
[[File:Grand Canyon, Bryce, Capitol Reef Trip 281.jpg|right|thumb|The North Rim of the [[Grand Canyon]]]]
[[Marcos de Niza]], a Spanish [[Franciscan]], explored parts of the area in 1539 and met some of its original [[Native Americans in the United States|native]] inhabitants, probably the [[Sobaipuri]]. The expedition of Spanish explorer [[Francisco VÃ¡squez de Coronado|Coronado]] entered the area in 1540â1542 during its search for [[Quivira and CÃ­bola|CÃ­bola]]. [[Eusebio Kino|Father Kino]] was the next European in the region. A member of the [[Society of Jesus]], he led the development of a chain of missions and converted many of the Indians to Christianity in the [[PimerÃ­a Alta]] (now southern Arizona and northern [[Sonora]]) in the 1690s and early 18th century. Spain founded ''presidios'' (fortified towns) at Tubac in 1752 and Tucson in 1775. When Mexico achieved its independence from [[Spanish Empire|Spain]] in 1821, what is now Arizona became part of the Territory of ''Nueva California'', also known as ''[[Alta California]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anna et al., Historia de MÃ©xico. Barcelona: Critica, 2001, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[MexicanâAmerican War]] (1847), the U.S. occupied Mexico City and pursued its claim to much of northern Mexico, including what later became Arizona. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo (1848) specified that the sum of $15&amp;nbsp;million U.S. dollars in compensation (equivalent to about ${{Format price|{{inflation|US|15000000|1848|r=-6}}}} in present day terms{{inflation-fn|US}}) be paid to the Republic of Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mexican-American War]] as accessed on March 16, 2007 at 7:33 MST AM&lt;/ref&gt; In 1853 the land below the [[Gila River]] was acquired from Mexico in the [[Gadsden Purchase]]. Arizona was administered as part of the [[Territory of New Mexico]] until southern New Mexico seceded&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://members.tripod.com/~azrebel/page9.html |title=Arizona Ordinance of secession presented by the Col. Sherod Hunter Camp 1525, SCV, Phoenix, Arizona |publisher=Members.tripod.com |date=2007-07-23 |accessdate=2010-07-25| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4yrcJO | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Union as the [[Arizona Territory (CSA)|Confederate Territory of Arizona]] on March 16, 1861. Arizona was recognized as a Confederate Territory by presidential proclamation of [[Jefferson Davis]] on February 14, 1862. This is the first official use of the name. A new [[Arizona Territory]], consisting of the western half of New Mexico Territory was declared in Washington, D.C., on February 24, 1863. The new boundaries would later form the basis of the state.

Although names including &quot;Gadsonia&quot;, &quot;Pimeria&quot;, &quot;Montezuma&quot; and &quot;Arizuma&quot; had been considered for the territory,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pima.gov/cmo/sdcp/Archives/reports/Cult.html {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4ydaSD|date =2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Abraham Lincoln|President Lincoln]] signed the final bill, it read &quot;Arizona&quot;, and the name became permanent. ([[Montezuma (mythology)|Montezuma]] was not the [[Aztec]] Emperor, but the sacred name of a divine hero to the [[Pima]] people of the [[Gila River Valley|Gila]] valley, and was probably consideredâand rejectedâfor its sentimental value before the name &quot;Arizona&quot; was settled upon.)

[[Brigham Young]] sent [[Mormon]]s to Arizona in the mid-to-late 19th century. They founded [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]], [[Snowflake, Arizona|Snowflake]], [[Heber-Overgaard, Arizona|Heber]], [[Safford, Arizona|Safford]] and other towns. They also settled in the [[Phoenix Valley]] (or &quot;Valley of the Sun&quot;), [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], and other areas. The Mormons settled what became known as [[Northern Arizona]] and northern New Mexico, but these areas were located in a part of the former [[New Mexico Territory]].

During the Mexican Revolution from 1910 to 1920, a few battles were fought in the Mexican towns just across the border from Arizona border settlements. Throughout the revolution, Arizonans were enlisting in one of the several armies fighting in Mexico. The Battle of Ambos Nogales in 1918, other than Pancho Villa's 1916 Columbus Raid in New Mexico, was the only significant engagement on U.S. soil between United States and Mexican forces. The battle resulted in an American victory. After U.S. soldiers were fired on by Mexican Federal troops, the American garrison then launched an assault into Nogales Mexico. The Mexicans eventually surrendered after both sides sustained heavy casualties. A few months earlier, just west of Nogales, an Indian War battle occurred, thus being the last engagement in the American Indian Wars which lasted from 1775 to 1918. The participants in the fight were U.S. soldiers stationed on the border and Yaqui Indians who were using Arizona as a base to raid the nearby Mexican settlements, as part of their wars against Mexico.

Arizona became a U.S. state on February 14, 1912. This resulted in the end to the territorial colonization of Continental America. Arizona was the 48th state admitted into the U.S. and the last of the [[Contiguous United States|contiguous states]] to be admitted.

[[File:Sunset and cactus.JPG|thumb|A sunset in the Arizona desert near [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]]. The climate and imagery are two factors behind Arizona's tourism industry.]]
Cotton farming and copper mining, two of Arizona's most important statewide industries, suffered heavily during the [[Great Depression]], but it was during the 1920s and 1930s that tourism began to be the important Arizona industry it is today. Dude ranches such as the K L Bar and Remuda in Wickenburg, along with the Flying V and Tanque Verde in Tucson, gave tourists the chance to experience the flavor and life of the &quot;old West.&quot; Several upscale hotels and resorts opened during this period, some of which are still top tourist draws to this day; they include the [[Arizona Biltmore Hotel]] in central Phoenix (opened 1929) and the Wigwam Resort on the west side of the Phoenix area (opened 1936).

Arizona was the site of German and Italian [[POW]] camps during World War II and [[Japanese American|Japanese]] U.S.-resident internment camps. The camps were abolished after World War II. The Phoenix area site was purchased after the war by the [[Maytag]] family (of major [[home appliance]] fame), and is currently utilized as the [[Phoenix Zoo]]. A [[Japanese American internment]] camp was located on [[Mount Lemmon]], just outside of the state's southeastern city of Tucson. Another [[POW camp]] was located near the [[Gila River]] in eastern [[Yuma County, Arizona|Yuma County]]. Because of wartime fears of Japanese invasion of the west coast, all Japanese residents in western Arizona were required to reside in the war camps.

Arizona was also home to the [[Steele Indian School Park|Phoenix Indian School]], one of several federal institutions designed to forcibly assimilate native children into Anglo-American culture. Children were often enrolled into these schools against the wishes of their parents and families.

Arizona's population grew tremendously after World War II, in part because of the development of [[air conditioning]], which made the intense summers more comfortable. According to the Arizona Blue Book (published by the [[Arizona Secretary of State]]'s office each year), the state population in 1910 was 294,353. By 1970, it was 1,752,122. The percentage growth each decade averaged about 20% in the earlier decades and about 60% each decade thereafter.

The 1960s saw the establishment of [[retirement communities]], special age-restricted subdivisions catering exclusively to the needs of senior citizens who wanted to escape the harsh winters of the [[Midwest]] and the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]]. [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]], established by developer [[Del Webb]] and opened in 1960, was one of the first such communities. [[Green Valley, Arizona|Green Valley]], south of Tucson, was another such community and was designed to be a retirement subdivision for Arizona's teachers. (Many senior citizens arrive in Arizona each winter and stay only during the winter months; they are referred to as [[Snowbird (people)|snowbirds]].)

In March 2000, Arizona was the site of the first legally binding election to nominate a candidate for public office ever held over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thegreenpapers.com/News/19991003-0.html Arizona Democrats authorize Internet Voting for March 11 Advisory Primary]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2000 Arizona Democratic Primary, under worldwide attention, Al Gore defeated Bill Bradley, and voter turnout increased more than 500% over the 1996 primary.

Three ships named [[USS Arizona|USS ''Arizona'']] have been christened in honor of the state, although only [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'' (BB-39)]] was so named after statehood was achieved.

[[File:Scottsdale cityscape4.jpg|thumb|right|275px|View of suburban development in the [[Phoenix metropolitan area]] ]]
Arizona remained sparsely settled for most of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/34807/Arizona Arizona (state, United States)]. ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' Online.&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 census reported the population of &quot;Arizona County&quot; to be 6,482, of whom 4,040 were listed as &quot;Indians&quot;, 21 as &quot;free colored&quot; and 2,421 as &quot;white&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://blueprod.ssd.census.gov/population/www/documentation/twps0056/tab17.pdf Arizona â Race and Hispanic Origin: 1860 to 1990.]&quot; ([[PDF]]).

The population of the Phoenix metropolitan area increased by 45.3% from 1991 through 2001, helping to make Arizona the second fastest growing state in the nation in the 1990s (the fastest was [[Nevada]]).&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.census.gov/population/cen2000/phc-t3/tab05.txt Ranking Tables for Metropolitan Areas: 1990 and 2000].&quot; ''[[United States Census Bureau]].''

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Arizona had a population of 6,392,017. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 73.0% [[White American|White]] (57.8% [[Non-Hispanic Whites|Non-Hispanic White]] Alone), 4.1% Black or [[African American]], 4.6% [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] and Alaska Native, 2.8% [[Asian American|Asian]], 0.2% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 11.9% from Some Other Race, and 3.4% from Two or More Races.

===Religion===
As of the year 2000, the RCMS&lt;ref name=&quot;thearda&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thearda.com/mapsReports/reports/state/04_2000.asp|title=State Membership Reports |accessdate=2010-06-15 |work=thearda.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that the three largest denominational groups in Arizona are Catholic, [[Evangelical Protestant]] and [[Mainline Protestant]]. The Catholic Church has the highest number of adherents in Arizona (at 974,883), followed by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] with 251,974 members reported and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], reporting 138,516 adherents. The religious body with the largest number of congregations is [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (with 643 congregations) followed by the [[Southern Baptist Convention]] (with 323 congregations).

According to a 2007 survey conducted by The Pew Forum, the religious affiliation of the People of Arizona are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religions.pewforum.org/pdf/report-religious-landscape-study-full.pdf|date=2008-02|accessdate=2009-10-13|publisher=The Pew Forum|title=U.S. Religious Landscape Survey|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Roman Catholic]] â 25%
* [[Protestantism|Protestant]]â 40%
** [[Mainline Protestant|Mainline]] â 15%
** [[Evangelical]] â 23%
** Other Protestant â 2%
* [[Latter-day Saint|LDS]] (Mormon) â 4%

* [[Buddhist]] â 1%
* Other Religions â 4%
* Unaffiliated â 22%
* Don't Know/Refused â 2%

==Economy==
The 2006 total [[gross state product]] was $232&amp;nbsp;billion. If Arizona (and each of the other U.S. states) were an independent country along with all existing countries (2005), it would have the 61st largest economy in the world ([https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/index.html CIA â The World Factbook]). This figure gives Arizona a larger economy than such countries as Ireland, Finland, and New Zealand. Arizona currently has the 21st largest economy among states in the United States. As a percentage of its overall budget, Arizona's projected $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] for 2009 is one of the largest in the country, behind such states as Texas, California, Michigan, and Florida, to name a few.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/stories/2008/02/25/daily29.html Arizona budget deficit labeled country's worst], The Business Journal of Phoenix {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5mr4yjren|date =2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state's per capita income is $40,828, ranking 39th in the U.S. The state had a [[median household income]] of $50,958 making it 22nd in the country and just shy of the U.S. national median.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/regional/spi/2010/pdf/spi0310.pdf |title=News Release|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early in its history, Arizona's economy relied on the &quot;five C's&quot;: copper (see ''[[Copper mining in Arizona]]''), cotton, cattle, [[citrus]], and [[climate]] (tourism). At one point Arizona was the largest producer of cotton in the country. Copper is still extensively mined from many expansive open-pit and underground mines, accounting for two-thirds of the nation's output.

===Employment===
The state government is Arizona's largest employer, while [[Wal-Mart]] is the state's largest private employer, with 17,343 employees (2008). As of June 2010, the state's unemployment rate is 9.6%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/lau/ Bls.gov]; Local Area Unemployment Statistics {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5y2yzYkqn|date =2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nearly 70 percent of the land in Arizona is owned by the [[U.S. government]], which leases a portion of the [[Public domain (land)|public domain]] to ranchers or miners.

===Largest employers===
According to the ''[[Arizona Republic]]'', the largest employers in the state as of 2010 were:&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.azdatapages.com/datacenter/business/arizona-republic-top-100.html Arizona Republic 100: State's biggest employers].&quot; ''Arizona Republic''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taxation===
Arizona collects personal [[income tax]]es in five brackets: 2.87%, 3.20%, 3.74%, 4.72% and 5.04%. The state [[transaction privilege tax]] is 6.6%; however, county and municipal sales taxes generally add an additional 2%.

The state rate on transient lodging (hotel/[[motel]]) is 7.27%. The state of Arizona does not levy a state tax on food for home consumption or on drugs prescribed by a licensed physician or dentist. However, some cities in Arizona do levy a tax on food for home consumption.

All fifteen Arizona counties levy a tax. Incorporated municipalities also levy transaction privilege taxes which, with the exception of their hotel/motel tax, are generally in the range of 1-to-3%. These added assessments could push the combined sales [[tax rate]] to as high as 10.7%.

Main interstate routes include [[Interstate 17]], and [[Interstate 19]] running north-south, [[Interstate 40 in Arizona|Interstate 40]], [[Interstate 8 in Arizona|Interstate 8]], and [[Interstate 10 in Arizona|Interstate 10]] running east-west, and a short stretch of [[Interstate 15 in Arizona|Interstate 15]] running northeast/southwest through the extreme northwestern corner of the state. In addition, the various urban areas are served by complex networks of [[List of Arizona State Routes|state routes]] and highways, such as the [[Arizona State Route 101|Loop 101]], which is part of Phoenix's vast [[Metropolitan Phoenix Freeways|freeway system]].

===Public transportation, Amtrak, and intercity bus===
The Phoenix and Tucson metropolitan areas are served by public bus transit systems. Yuma and Flagstaff also have public bus systems. [[Greyhound Lines]] serves Phoenix, Tucson, Flagstaff, Yuma, and several smaller communities statewide.

A [[light rail]] system called [[METRO Light Rail (Phoenix)|Valley Metro Rail]] has recently been completed in Phoenix; it connects Central Phoenix with the nearby cities of Mesa and Tempe. The system officially opened for service in December 2008.

In May 2006, voters in Tucson approved a Regional Transportation Plan (a comprehensive bus transit/streetcar/roadway improvement program), and its funding via a new half-cent sales tax increment. The centerpiece of the plan is a light rail streetcar system (possibly similar to the [[Portland Streetcar]] in Oregon) that will travel through the downtown area, connecting the main [[University of Arizona]] campus with the Rio Nuevo master plan area on the western edge of downtown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightrailnow.org/news/n_tuc_2006-05b.htm |title=Tucson: Streetcar Plan Wins With 60% of Vote |publisher=Lightrailnow.org |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Amtrak]] ''[[Southwest Chief]]'' route serves Northern AZ, stopping at [[Winslow (Amtrak station)|Winslow]], [[Flagstaff (Amtrak station)|Flagstaff]], [[Williams Junction (Amtrak station)|Williams]] and [[Kingman (Amtrak station)|Kingman]]. The ''[[Texas Eagle]]'' and ''[[Sunset Limited]]'' routes serve South-Central Arizona, stopping at [[Tucson (Amtrak station)|Tucson]], [[Maricopa (Amtrak station)|Maricopa]], [[Yuma (Amtrak station)|Yuma]] and [[Benson (Amtrak station)|Benson]]. Phoenix's Amtrak service was canceled in 1996, and now an Amtrak bus runs between Phoenix and the station in Maricopa.

[[File:Azcap.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The [[Arizona State Capitol]], [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]]]

===Capitol complex===
The state capital of Arizona is [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. The original Capitol building, with its distinctive copper dome, was dedicated in 1901 (construction was completed for $136,000 in 1900), when the area was still a territory. Phoenix became the official state capital with Arizona's admission to the union in 1912.

The [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] and [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] buildings were dedicated in 1960, and an Executive Office Building was dedicated in 1974 (the ninth floor of this building is where the Office of the Governor is located). The original Capitol building was converted into a museum.

The Capitol complex is fronted and highlighted by the richly landscaped [[Wesley Bolin Memorial Plaza]], named after [[Wesley Bolin]], a governor who died in office in the 1970s. Numerous monuments and memorials are on the site, including the anchor and signal mast from the [[USS Arizona (BB-39)|USS ''Arizona'']] (one of the U.S. Navy ships [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|sunk in Pearl Harbor]]), a granite version of the [[Ten Commandments]], and the [[Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum]].

===State legislative branch===
The [[Arizona Legislature]] is [[bicameral]] (like the legislature of every other state except [[Nebraska]]) and consists of a thirty-member [[Arizona Senate|Senate]] and a 60-member [[Arizona House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Each of the thirty legislative districts has one senator and two representatives. Legislators are elected for two-year terms.

Each Legislature covers a two-year period. The first session following the general election is known as the first regular session, and the session convening in the second year is known as the second regular session. Each regular session begins on the second Monday in January and adjourns ''sine die'' (terminates for the year) no later than Saturday of the week in which the 100th day from the beginning of the regular session falls. The President of the Senate and Speaker of the House, by rule, may extend the session up to seven additional days. Thereafter, the session can only be extended by a majority vote of members present of each house.

The current majority party is the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]], which has held power in both houses since 1993.

Arizona state senators and representatives are elected for two year terms and are limited to four consecutive terms in a chamber, though there is no limit on the total number of terms. When a lawmaker is term-limited from office, it is not uncommon for him or her to run for election in the other chamber.

The fiscal year 2006â07 general fund budget, approved by the Arizona Legislature in June 2006, is slightly less than $10&amp;nbsp;billion. Besides the money spent on state agencies, it also includes more than $500&amp;nbsp;million in income- and property tax cuts, pay raises for government employees, and additional funding for the Kâ12 education system.

===State executive branch===
Arizonaâs executive branch is headed by a [[Governor of Arizona|governor]], who is elected to a four-year term. The governor may serve any number of terms, though no more than two in a row. Arizona is one of the few states that does not maintain a governorâs mansion. During office the governors reside within their private residence, and all executive offices are housed in the executive tower at the state capitol. The current governor of Arizona is [[Jan Brewer]] (R). She assumed office after [[Janet Napolitano]] had her nomination by [[Barack Obama]] for [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security|Secretary of Homeland Security]] confirmed by the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ariz. GOP would gain if Napolitano gets Obama post |agency=Associated Press |publisher=[[KTAR-FM|KTAR]] |date=November 20, 2008 |url=http://ktar.com/?nid=6&amp;sid=994469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arizona has had four female governors including the current Governor [[Jan Brewer]], more than any other state.

Other elected executive officials include the [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]], [[State Treasurer]], [[Arizona Attorney General|State Attorney General]], [[state education agency|Superintendent of Public Instruction]], [[Mine Inspector|State Mine Inspector]] and a five member [[Arizona Corporation Commission|Corporation Commission]]. All elected officials hold a term of four years, and are limited to two consecutive terms (except the office of the state mine inspector, which is exempt from term limits).

Arizona is one of seven states that do not have a specified [[Lieutenant governor (United States)#Arizona|lieutenant governor]]. The secretary of state is the first in line to succeed the governor in the event of death, disability, resignation, or removal from office. The line of succession also includes the attorney general, state treasurer and superintendent of public instruction. Since 1977, four secretaries of state and one attorney general have risen to Arizona's governorship through these means.

====Current elected officials====
* Governor of Arizona: [[Jan Brewer]] (R)
* Secretary of State: [[Ken Bennett]] (R)
* Attorney General: [[Tom Horne]] (R)
* State Treasurer: [[Doug Ducey]] (R)
* Superintendent of Public Instruction: [[John Huppenthal]] (R)
* State Mine Inspector: [[Joe Hart (politician)|Joe Hart]] (R)
* Corporation Commissioners: [[Gary Pierce]] (R), [[Kristin Mayes]] (R), [[Bob Stump (Corporation Commissioner)|Bob Stump]] (R), [[Sandra D. Kennedy]] (D), and [[Paul Newman (politician)|Paul Newman]]. (D)

===State judicial branch===
The [[Arizona Supreme Court]] is the highest court in Arizona. The court currently consists of one chief justice, a vice chief justice, and three associate justices. Justices are appointed by the governor from a list recommended by a bi-partisian commission, and are re-elected after the initial two years following their appointment. Subsequent re-elections occur every six years. The supreme court has appellate jurisdiction in death penalty cases, but almost all other appellate cases go through the [[Arizona Court of Appeals]] beforehand. The court has original jurisdiction in a few other circumstances, as outlined in the state constitution. The court may also declare laws unconstitutional, but only while seated ''[[en banc]]''. The court meets in the Arizona Supreme Court Building at the capitol complex (at the southern end of Wesley Bolin Plaza).

The Arizona Court of Appeals, further divided into two divisions, is the intermediate court in the state. Division One is based in Phoenix, consists of sixteen judges, and has jurisdiction in the Western and Northern regions of the state, along with the greater Phoenix area. Division Two is based in Tucson, consists of six judges, and has jurisdiction over the Southern regions of the state, including the Tucson area. Judges are selected in a method similar to the one used for state supreme court justices.

Each county of Arizona has a [[Arizona Superior Court|superior court]], the size and organization of which are varied and generally depend on the size of the particular county.

===Counties===
Arizona is divided into political jurisdictions designated as ''[[County (United States)|counties]]''. As of 1983 there were 15 counties in the state, ranging in size from {{convert|1238|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3}} to {{convert|18661|sqmi|km2|sigfig=4}}.

===Federal representation===
Arizona's two United States Senators are [[John McCain]] (R), the 2008 Republican Presidential Nominee, and [[Jon Kyl]] (R).

Arizona's representatives in the [[United States House of Representatives]] are [[Paul A. Gosar]] (R-1), [[Trent Franks]] (R-2), [[Ben Quayle]] (R-3), [[Ed Pastor]] (D-4), [[David Schweikert]] (R-5), [[Jeff Flake]] (R-6), [[Raul Grijalva]] (D-7), and [[Gabrielle Giffords]] (D-8). Arizona gained two seats in the House of Representatives due to [[redistricting]] based on [[2000 United States Census|Census 2000]].

''See also: [[:Category:Arizona elections|Elections in Arizona]], [[Political party strength in Arizona]]''&lt;br /&gt;

From statehood through the late 1940s, Arizona was primarily dominated by the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. During this time period, the Democratic candidate for the presidency carried the state each election, with the only exceptions being the elections of [[United States presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[United States presidential election, 1924|1924]] and [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928]]âall three of which were national [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] landslides.

Since the [[United States presidential election, 1952|election]] of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] in 1952, however, the state has voted consistently Republican in national politics, with the Republican candidate winning it in most presidential elections. [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] won Arizona by particularly large margins. The sole exception to this trend was the victory of Democrat [[Bill Clinton]] in [[United States presidential election, 1996|1996]]. Clinton also came within about a percentage point of gaining Arizona's electoral votes in [[United States presidential election, 1992|1992]]. However, the closest loss by a Democrat was by [[Lyndon Johnson]] in [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]], who lost the state by slightly over 5,000 votes to Senator [[Barry Goldwater]], an Arizona native. This was also the most closely contested state in that year's presidential election.

In recent years, the Republican Party has also dominated Arizona politics in general. The fast-growing Phoenix and Tucson suburbs became increasingly friendly to Republicans from the 1950s onward. During this time, many &quot;Pinto Democrats,&quot; or conservative Democrats from rural areas, became increasingly willing to support Republicans at the state and national level. While the state normally supports Republicans at the federal level, Democrats are often competitive in statewide elections, as in 2006, when [[Janet Napolitano]] was handily reelected the state's governor.

On March 4, 2008, [[John McCain]] effectively clinched the Republican nomination for 2008, becoming the first presidential nominee from the state since Barry Goldwater in 1964.

Arizona politics are dominated by a longstanding rivalry between its two largest counties, [[Maricopa County]] and [[Pima County]]--home to Phoenix and Tucson, respectively. The two counties have almost 75 percent of the state's population and cast almost 80 percent of the state's vote. They also elect a substantial majority of the state legislature.

Maricopa County is home to almost 60 percent of the state's population, and most of the state's elected officials live there. It has voted Republican in every presidential election since 1948. This includes the [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] run of native son Barry Goldwater; he would not have carried his home state had it not been for a 20,000-vote margin in Maricopa County. Similarly, while McCain won Arizona by eight percentage points in 2008, the margin would have likely been far closer if not for a 130,000-vote margin in Maricopa County.

In contrast, Pima County, home to Tucson, and most of southern Arizona have historically been more Democratic. While Tucson's suburbs lean Republican, they hold to a somewhat more moderate brand of Republicanism than is common in the Phoenix area.

Arizona rejected an [[Arizona Proposition 107 (2006)|anti-gay marriage amendment]] in a referendum as part of the 2006 elections. Arizona was the first state in the nation to do so. [[Recognition of same-sex unions in Arizona|Same-sex marriage]] was already illegal in Arizona, but this amendment would have denied any legal or financial benefits to unmarried homosexual or heterosexual couples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gay.com/news/article.html?2006/11/07/2 |title=Arizona stands alone against marriage ban â Queer Lesbian Gay News |publisher=Gay.com |accessdate=2010-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Arizona voters passed [[Arizona Proposition 102 (2008)|Proposition 102]], an amendment to the state constitution to define marriage as a union of one man and one woman, though by a narrower majority than similar votes in a number of other states. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azstarnet.com/metro/265756 Ban on gay unions solidly supported in most of Arizona]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Arizona passed the toughest [[Arizona SB 1070|illegal immigration legislation]] in the nation, igniting a fierce debate between supporters and detractors of the law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/24/us/politics/24immig.html|work=The New York Times|title=Arizona Enacts Stringent Law on Immigration|accessdate=2010-06-23 | first=Randal C. | last=Archibold | date=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|List of localities in Arizona|List of cities in Arizona (by population)|List of Arizona counties}}

[[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], located in [[Maricopa County, Arizona|Maricopa County]], is the largest city in Arizona and also the state capital. Other prominent cities in the Phoenix metro area include [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]] (the third largest city in Arizona), [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]], [[Peoria, Arizona|Peoria]], [[Chandler, Arizona|Chandler]], [[Sun City, Arizona|Sun City]], [[Sun City West, Arizona|Sun City West]], [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]], [[Surprise, Arizona|Surprise]], [[Gilbert, Arizona|Gilbert]], [[El Mirage, Arizona|El Mirage]], [[Avondale, Arizona|Avondale]], [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]], [[Tolleson, Arizona|Tolleson]] and [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], with a total metropolitan population of just over 4.3&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;Phoenix Business Journal, Sep. 2, 2011, page 4&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]] is the state's second largest city, and is located in [[Pima County]], approximately {{convert|110|mi}} [[Ordinal directions|southeast]] of the Phoenix metropolitan area. The Tucson metropolitan area crossed the one-million-resident threshold in early 2007. It is home to the [[University of Arizona]], which, along with Arizona State University in Tempe, are considered the state's flagship universities.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

The [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]] metropolitan area includes the cities of Prescott, [[Sedona, Arizona|Sedona]], [[Cottonwood, Arizona|Cottonwood]], [[Camp Verde, Arizona|Camp Verde]] and numerous other towns spread out over the {{convert|8123|sqmi|km2|sigfig=3}} of [[Yavapai County]] area. With 212,635 residents, this cluster of towns forms the third largest metropolitan area in the state. The city of Prescott (population 41,528) lies approximately {{convert|100|mi}} [[Ordinal directions|northwest]] of the Phoenix metropolitan area. Situated in pine tree forests at an elevation of about {{convert|5500|ft}}, Prescott enjoys a much cooler climate than Phoenix, with average summer highs in the upper 80s [[Fahrenheit]] and winter temperatures averaging {{convert|50|Â°F|Â°C}}.

[[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] is center of the fourth largest metropolitan area in Arizona. It is located near the borders of California and Mexico. It is one of the hottest cities in the United States with the average July high of {{convert|107|F}}. (The same month's average in [[Death Valley]] is {{convert|115|F}}.) The city also features sunny days about 90% of the year. The Yuma [[Metropolitan Statistical Area]] has a population of 160,000. Yuma also attracts many winter visitors from all over the United States.

[[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] is the largest city in northern Arizona, and is situated at an elevation of nearly {{convert|7000|ft}}. With its large Ponderosa Pine forests, snowy winter weather and picturesque mountains, it is a stark contrast to the desert regions typically associated with Arizona. It sits at the base of the [[San Francisco Peaks]] the highest mountain range in the state of Arizona, with [[Humphreys Peak]], the highest point in Arizona at {{convert|12633|ft}}. Flagstaff has a strong tourism sector, due to its proximity to numerous tourist attractions including: [[Grand Canyon National Park]], [[Sedona]], and [[Oak Creek Canyon]]. Historic [[U.S. Route 66]] is the main east-west street in the town. Flagstaff is home to 57,391 residents and the main campus of [[Northern Arizona University]].

==Education==
===Elementary and secondary education===
Public schools in Arizona are separated into about 220 local school districts which operate independently, but are governed in most cases by elected county school superintendents; these are in turn overseen by the [[Arizona State Board of Education]] (a division of the [[Arizona Department of Education]]) and the state Superintendent of Public Instruction (elected in partisan elections every even-numbered year when there is not a presidential election, for a four-year term). In 2005, a School District Redistricting Commission was established with the goal of combining and consolidating many of these districts.

===Higher education===
[[File:University of Arizona mall.jpg|thumb|right|[[University of Arizona]] located in [[Tucson, Arizona|Tucson]]]]
[[File:Asubiodesign.jpg|thumb|right|[[Arizona State University]] located in [[Tempe, Arizona|Tempe]]]]


Arizona is served by three public universities: The [[University of Arizona]], [[Arizona State University]], and [[Northern Arizona University]]. These schools are governed by the [[Arizona Board of Regents]].

Private higher education in Arizona is dominated by a large number of for-profit and &quot;chain&quot; (multi-site) universities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&amp;ct=2+3&amp;ic=1 College Navigator â Arizona] National Center for Education Statistics, [[U.S. Department of Education]]&lt;/ref&gt; Only one traditional (single-site, non-profit, four-year) private college exists in Arizona ([[Prescott College]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/?s=AZ&amp;ct=2+3&amp;ic=1&amp;pg=2&amp;id=105589 College Navigator â Four-Year Schools in Arizona] National Center for Education Statistics, [[U.S. Department of Education]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Arizona has a wide network of two-year vocational schools and [[community colleges]]. These colleges were governed historically by a separate statewide Board of Directors but, in 2002, the state legislature transferred almost all oversight authority to individual community college districts.&lt;ref&gt;2002 Legislature â HB 2710, which later became ARS 15-1444&lt;/ref&gt; The Maricopa County Community College District includes 11 community colleges throughout Maricopa County and is one of the largest in the nation.

Due to its numerous golf courses, Arizona is home to several stops on the [[PGA Tour]], most notably the [[Phoenix Open]], held at the [[TPC of Scottsdale]], and the [[WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship]] at the [[Ritz-Carlton Golf Club]] in [[Marana]].

With three state universities and several community colleges, college sports are also prevalent in Arizona. The intense rivalry between [[Arizona State University]] and the [[University of Arizona]] predates Arizona's statehood, and is the oldest rivalry in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Tom |last=Knauer |author=Tom Knauer|title=What is the Territorial Cup? |url=http://media.wildcat.arizona.edu/media/storage/paper997/news/2006/11/22/UaVsAsu/What-Is.The.Territorial.Cup-2507222.shtml |publisher=The Wildcat Online |date=2006-11-22 |accessdate=2007-04-02}} {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thus aptly named [[Territorial Cup]], first awarded in 1889 and certified as the oldest trophy in college football,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Official 2007 NCAA Division I Football Records Book | publisher=National Collegiate Athletic Association | year = 2007 | url = http://www.ncaa.org/library/records/football/football_records_book/2007/2007_d1_football_records_book.pdf|format=PDF}} {{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; is awarded to the winner of the âDuel in the Desert,â the annual football game between the two schools. Arizona also hosts several [[bowl game]]s in the [[Bowl Championship Series]]. The [[Fiesta Bowl]], originally held at [[Sun Devil Stadium]], will now be held at the [[University of Phoenix Stadium]] in [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]]. The University of Phoenix Stadium was also home to the [[2007 BCS National Championship Game]] and hosted [[Super Bowl XLII]] on February 3, 2008. The [[Insight Bowl]] is also held at [[Sun Devil Stadium]].

Besides being home to spring training, Arizona is also home to two other baseball leagues, [[Arizona Fall League]] and [[Arizona Winter League]]. The Fall League was founded in 1992 and is a [[minor league]] baseball league designed for players to refine their skills and perform in game settings in front of major and minor league baseball scouts and team executives, who are in attendance at almost every game. The league got exposure when [[Michael Jordan]] started his time in baseball with the [[Scottsdale Scorpions]]. The Arizona Winter League, founded in 2007, is a professional baseball league of four teams for the independent [[Golden Baseball League]]. The games are played in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] at the [[Desert Sun Stadium]], but added two new teams in the California desert, and one more in [[Sonora]] for the 2008 season.

===Spring training===
[[File:SpringTrainingHoHoKamPark.jpg|thumb|A spring training game between the two Chicago teams, the Cubs and the White Sox, at [[HoHoKam Park]] in [[Mesa, Arizona|Mesa]]]]
Arizona is a popular location for [[Major League Baseball]] [[spring training]], as it is the site of the [[Cactus League]]. The only other location for spring training is in Florida with the [[Grapefruit League]]. The [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] have a new spring training facility in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] owned by [[Glendale, Arizona|Glendale]] which opened in 2009, making them the 14th team in Arizona. Spring training has been somewhat of a tradition in Arizona since 1947 (i.e. the Cleveland Indians in [[Tucson]] until 1991, and the San Diego Padres in [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]] until 1992) despite the fact that the state did not have its own major league team until the state was awarded the [[Arizona Diamondbacks|Diamondbacks]] in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] as an expansion team. The state hosts the following teams:
&lt;div style=&quot;-moz-column-count:2; column-count:2;&quot;&gt;
* [[Arizona Diamondbacks]] in Salt River Fields.
* [[Chicago Cubs]] in [[HoHoKam Park]] of Mesa.

Arizona is prominently featured in the lyrics of many [[Country and Western]] songs, such as [[Jamie O'Neal]]'s hit ballad &quot;[[There Is No Arizona]]&quot;. [[George Strait]]'s &quot;Oceanfront Property&quot; uses &quot;ocean front property in Arizona&quot; as a metaphor for a sucker proposition. The line &quot;see you down in Arizona Bay&quot; is used in a [[Tool (band)|Tool]] song in reference to the possibility that L.A. will one day fall into the ocean.

&quot;Arizona&quot; was the title of a popular song recorded by [[Mark Lindsay]]. Arizona is also mentioned by the hit song &quot;[[Take It Easy]]&quot; written by [[Jackson Browne]] and [[Glenn Frey]] and performed by the [[Eagles (band)|Eagles]].  The song includes the lines:

:Well, I'm a standin' on a corner in [[Winslow, Arizona]],
:and such a fine sight to see
:It's a girl, my Lord, in a flatbed Ford,
:slowin' down to take a look at me

Arizona's budding music scene is helped by emerging bands, as well as some well-known artists. The [[Gin Blossoms]], [[Chronic Future]], [[Roger Clyne and the Peacemakers]], [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Caroline's Spine]], and others began their careers in Arizona. Also, a number of [[punk rock|punk]] bands got their start in Arizona, including [[JFA (band)|JFA]], [[The Feederz]], [[Sun City Girls]], [[The Meat Puppets]], and more recently [[Authority Zero]]. There is also a [[hardcore metal]] scene with artists such as [[blessthefall]], [[Scary Kids Scaring Kids]], [[The Maine (band)|The Maine]], [[Eyes Set To Kill]], [[The Bled]], [[Greeley Estates]], [[The Stiletto Formal]] However, there is also an [[indie rock]] scene with artist such as [[The Format]] and [[Fine China (band)|Fine China]]

[[Chester Bennington]], the lead vocalist of [[Linkin Park]], [[Bob Stubbs]] a former member and drummer of the band [[Social Distortion]] lives in Arizona, and [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] artist [[DJ Z-Trip]] are both from [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]]. One of Arizona's better known musicians would be [[shock rock]]er [[Alice Cooper]], who helped define the genre.
