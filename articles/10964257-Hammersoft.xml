The '''Scottish local elections, 2007''' were held on 3 May 2007, the same day as [[Scottish Parliament election, 2007|Scottish Parliament elections]] and [[United Kingdom local elections, 2007#English council elections|local elections]] in parts of [[England]]. All 32 Scottish [[Local government of Scotland|councils]] had all their seats up for election &amp;ndash; all Scottish councils are [[unitary authorities]].

This was the first election for local government in [[Great Britain]] to use the [[Single Transferable Vote]] (the system is used in [[Northern Ireland]]), as implemented by the [[Local Governance (Scotland) Act 2004]]. The new electoral system resulted in most councils being under no overall control.

Scanners supplied by DRS Data Services Limited of [[Milton Keynes]], in partnership with Electoral Reform Services (ERS), the trading arm of the [[Electoral Reform Society]], were used to [[Electronic vote counting|electronically count]] the [[Ballot paper|paper ballots]] in both the Scottish council elections and the Scottish Parliament general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://election.scotsman.com/topics.cfm?tid=1064&amp;id=588392006 &quot;Electronic counting to take over from tellers at elections&quot;], ''[[The Scotsman]]'', 19 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drs.co.uk/corporate/newsitem.asp?id=106 &quot;Green light for DRS &amp; ERS to deliver e-Count for 2007 Scottish Elections&quot;], press release, DRS Data Services Limited&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the [[Scottish_Parliament_general_election,_2007#Incidents|fiasco]] in 2007 of holding parliamentary (Holyrood) and local elections simultaneously, the next Scottish local elections are to be held in [[Scottish local elections, 2012|2012]] instead of 2011.
