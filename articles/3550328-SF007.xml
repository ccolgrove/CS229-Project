'''Adept Manager''' is a [[graphical user interface]] to the [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] for [[KDE]]. It was developed by Peter RoÄkai and was sponsored by [[Canonical Ltd.]] through the [[Kubuntu]] project, where it replaced the Kynaptic package manager.

Adept 2 is for KDE 3. The last stable release was 2.1.3. Adept 3 is for KDE 4. At the end of 2008 development was discontinued, except for bug fixes, as Adept was replaced by [[KPackageKit]] for [[Kubuntu#Releases|Kubuntu's 9.04]] release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mornfall.net/blog/farewell__44___adept.html &quot;farewell, adept&quot;], notice on the project website. December 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Adept, however, can still be installed from the Debian Testing, Debian Unstable and Ubuntu 9.04, 9.10, 10.04 and 10.10 repositories. Bug fixes are still done to Adept, but major work has been discontinued.
