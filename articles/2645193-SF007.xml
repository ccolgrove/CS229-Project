'''Ophcrack''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[open source]] ([[GNU General Public License|GPL]] licensed) program that [[password cracking|cracks]] Windows passwords by using [[LM hash]]es through [[rainbow table]]s.  The program includes the ability to import the hashes from a variety of formats, including dumping directly from the [[Security Accounts Manager|SAM]] files of Windows. On most computers, ophcrack can crack most passwords within a few minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pcsupport.about.com/od/toolsofthetrade/gr/ophcrack.htm &quot;OPH Reviews&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rainbow tables for LM hashes of [[alphanumeric]] passwords are provided for free by the developers. By default, ophcrack is bundled with tables that allows it to crack passwords no longer than 14 characters using only alphanumeric characters. Available for freely for download are two Windows XP tables, one small and one fast, and one Windows Vista table.&lt;ref name=&quot;tables&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/tables.php|title=Rainbow Tables for ophcrack}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Objectif SÃ©curitÃ© has even larger tables for purchase, intended for professional use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.objectif-securite.ch/en/products.php|title=Products}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger rainbow tables contain LM hashes of passwords with all printable characters, including symbols and spaces, and are available for purchase.&lt;ref name=&quot;tables&quot;/&gt;

Ophcrack is also available as [[Live CD]] distributions which automate the retrieval, decryption, and cracking of passwords from a [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] system. One Live CD distribution is available for Windows XP and lower, as well as another for Windows Vista and Windows 7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ophcrack.sourceforge.net/download.php|title=Download ophcrack}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Live CD distributions of ophcrack are built with [[SliTaz GNU/Linux]].

Starting with version 2.3, Ophcrack also cracks [[NTLM]] hashes.  This is necessary if the generation of the LM hash is disabled (this is default for [[Windows Vista]]), or if the password is longer than 14 characters (in which case the LM hash is not stored).
