'''Embarq Missouri, Inc.''' is a telephone operating company providing local telephone services in [[Missouri]] owned by [[CenturyLink]].

The company was established in [[1929]] as '''The United Telephone Company''', later changing its name to '''United Telephone Company of Missouri''' upon expansion of the United Telephone System. It was owned by [[United Telecommunications]].

United Utilities later became United Telecommunications in [[1972]], and acquired Sprint Long Distance from [[GTE]] in the [[1980s]]. The company later became [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint Corporation]] and United Telephone of Missouri then became '''Sprint Missouri, Inc.''', operating as part of the '''Sprint Local Telecommunications Division'''.

Sprint Corporation, in [[2005]], acquired [[Nextel]] and changed its name to [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint Nextel Corporation]]. The company intended to spin-off its wireline assets into a separate company, which in [[2006]] occurred as [[Embarq|Embarq Corporation]]. Sprint Missouri then became '''Embarq Missouri, Inc.'''

Embarq was acquired by [[CenturyTel]] in [[2009]], which in [[2010]] changed its name to '''CenturyLink'''. Embarq Missouri, at that point, began carrying on business under the CenturyLink name.
