'''Santa Monica''' is a beachfront city in western [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], [[California]], US. Situated on [[Santa Monica Bay]], it is surrounded on three sides by the city of Los Angeles â [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] on the northwest, [[Brentwood, Los Angeles|Brentwood]] on the north, [[West Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California|West Los Angeles]] on the northeast, [[Mar Vista, Los Angeles, California|Mar Vista]] on the east, and [[Venice, California|Venice]] on the southeast.

Santa Monica is home to executives and Hollywood celebrities amongst others and it is a mixture of affluent, single-family neighborhoods, renters, surfers, young professionals, and students. The [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] 2010 population for Santa Monica is 89,736. Santa Monica is named for [[Monica of Hippo|Saint Monica of Hippo]] because the area on which the city is now located was first visited by Spaniards on her [[feast day]].

Partly because of its agreeable climate, Santa Monica had become a famed [[resort]] town by the early 20th century. The city has experienced a boom since the late 1980s through the revitalization of its downtown core with significant job growth and increased tourism.

[[Image:Santamonica.jpg|thumb|right|The Santa Monica Pier.]]

The ''[[Santa Monica Looff Hippodrome]]'' ([[carousel]]) is a [[National Historic Landmark]]. It sits on the [[Santa Monica Pier]], which was built in 1909. The ''La Monica Ballroom'' on the pier was once the largest ballroom in the US, and the source for many ''New Year's Eve'' national network broadcasts.
The [[Santa Monica Civic Auditorium]] was an important music venue for several decades and hosted the [[Academy Awards]] in the 1960s. [[McCabe's Guitar Shop]] is still a leading acoustic performance space, as well as retail outlet. [[Bergamot Station]] is a city-owned art gallery compound that includes the [[Santa Monica Museum of Art]]. The city is also home to the [[Santa Monica Heritage Museum]].

Santa Monica has three shopping districts, Montana Avenue on the north side of the city, the Downtown District in the city's core, and Main Street on the south end of the city. Each of these districts has its own unique feel and personality. Montana Avenue is a stretch of boutique stores, restaurants, and small offices that generally features more upscale shopping. The Main Street district offers an eclectic mix of clothing, restaurants, and other specialty retail.

The Downtown District is the home of the [[Third Street Promenade]], a major outdoor pedestrian-only shopping district that stretches for three blocks between [[Wilshire Boulevard|Wilshire Blvd.]] and Broadway (not the same [[Broadway (Los Angeles)|Broadway]] in downtown and south Los Angeles).
Third Street is closed to vehicles for those three blocks to allow people to stroll, congregate, shop and enjoy street performers.
[[Santa Monica Place]], the indoor mall designed by [[Frank Gehry]], is located at the south end of the Promenade. After a period of redevelopment, the mall reopened in the fall of 2010 as a modern shopping-entertainment complex with more outdoor space.&lt;ref name=LAT001&gt;Martha Groves, [http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mall5mar05,1,5939547.story?coll=la-headlines-california Hopes high for low-profile mall], ''Los Angeles Times'', March 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Santa Monica hosts the annual [[Santa Monica Film Festival]].

The oldest movie theater in the city is the Majestic. Also known as the ''Mayfair Theatre'', the theater which opened in 1912 has been closed since the [[1994 Northridge earthquake]]. The ''Aero Theater'' (now operated by the [[American Cinematheque]]) and ''Criterion Theater'' were built in the 1930s and still show movies. The [[Third Street Promenade|Santa Monica Promenade]] alone supports more than a dozen movie screens.

Palisades Park stretches out along the crumbling bluffs overlooking the Pacific and is a favorite walking area to view the ocean. It features a [[camera obscura]]. For 48 years local churches and the Police Association assembled a 12-tableau story of Christmas in Palisades Park. The sheds were open on the street side, protected by chain-link fencing (for years there was no fencing because vandalism was not yet a large problem). Inside were dioramas of the Holy Family made from store mannequins; critics argued that many of them did not resemble real people, were damaged, or were otherwise inappropriate. In 2001 the city decided to temporarily end the practice of allowing private groups to place displays in city parks, but in 2004 the Christmas displays returned.

The Santa Monica Steps, a long, steep staircase that leads from north of San Vicente down into Santa Monica Canyon, is a popular spot for all-natural outdoor workouts. Some area residents have complained that the stairs have become too popular, and attract too many exercisers to the wealthy neighborhood of multimillion-dollar properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news

Natives and tourists alike have enjoyed the [[Santa Monica Rugby Club]] since 1972. The club has been very successful since its conception, most recently winning back-to-back national championships in 2005 and 2006. Santa Monica defeated the Boston Irish Wolfhounds 57-19 in the Division 1 final, convincingly claiming its second consecutive American title on June 4, 2006, in [[San Diego]]. They offer Men's, Women's and a thriving children's programs. The club recently joined the [[Rugby Super League (US)|Rugby Super League]].

Every fall the [[Santa Monica Chamber of Commerce]] hosts ''The Taste of Santa Monica'' on the Santa Monica Pier. Visitors can sample food and drinks from Santa Monica restaurants. Other annual events include the Business and Consumer Expo, Sustainable Quality Awards, Santa Monica Cares Health and Wellness Festival, and the State of the City.

Santa Monica is an international mecca for [[skateboarding]] culture.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

Santa Monica has two hospitals: [[Saint John's Health Center]] and [[Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center]]. Its cemetery is [[Woodlawn Memorial Cemetery, Santa Monica|Woodlawn Memorial]].

Santa Monica has several newspapers and magazines, including the ''Santa Monica Star'', ''[[Santa Monica Daily Press]]'', the ''[[Santa Monica Mirror]]'', the ''[[Santa Monica Observer]]'', ''[[Santa Monica Magazine]]'', and the ''Santa Monica Sun''.

==Geography==
[[Image:Ocean Avenue.jpg|thumb|Ocean Avenue at sunset.]]
The city rests on a mostly flat slope that angles down towards [[Ocean Avenue (Santa Monica)|Ocean Avenue]] and towards the south. High bluffs separate the north side of the city from the beaches.

===Climate===
[[Image:Santamonicadowntownsunset.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Wilshire Boulevard in Downtown Santa Monica at twilight.]]
Classified as a moderate [[Mediterranean climate]] (Koppen ''Csb''), Santa Monica enjoys an average of 310 days of sunshine a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weatherbase.com/weather/weather.php3?s=159227&amp;refer=| title=Weatherbase: Historical Weather for Los Angeles, California, United States of America| publisher=Weatherbase.com| date=| accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its location, nestled on the vast and open Santa Monica Bay, morning fog is a common phenomenon in May, June and early July (caused by ocean temperature variations and currents). Locals have a particular terminology for this phenomenon: the &quot;May Gray&quot; and the &quot;[[June Gloom]]&quot;. Overcast skies are common for June mornings, but usually the strong sun burns the fog off by noon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santabarbara.com/community/weather/junegloom.asp| title = Santa Barbara.com: June Gloom| publisher=SantaBarbara.com| date=| accessdate=2009-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, it will sometimes stay cloudy and cool all day during June, even as other parts of the Los Angeles area enjoy sunny skies and warmer temperatures. At times, the sun can be shining east of 20th Street, while the beach area is overcast. As a general rule, the beach temperature is from 5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit (3 to 6 degrees Celsius) cooler than it is inland.

It is also in September that highest temperatures tend to be reached. It is winter, however, when the hot, dry winds of the [[Santa Ana wind|Santa Anas]] are most common. In contrast, temperatures exceeding 10 degrees below average are rare.

The rainy season is from late October through late March. Winter storms usually approach from the northwest and pass quickly through the Southland. There is very little rain during the rest of the year. Yearly rainfall totals are unpredictable as rainy years are occasionally followed by droughts.

Santa Monica usually enjoys a cool breeze blowing in from the ocean, keeping the air fresh and clean. Therefore, smog is less of a problem for Santa Monica than elsewhere around Los Angeles. However, in the autumn months of September through November, the Santa Ana winds will sometimes blow from the east, bringing smoggy inland air to the beaches.

===Environment===
The city is well known as one of the leading sustainable cities in all of the US.{{Who|date=January 2010}} Three of every four of the city's public works vehicles run on alternative fuel, making it among the largest such fleets in the country. All public buildings use renewable energy. In the last 15 years, the city has cut greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 10%. City officials and residents have made the ongoing cleanup of the Santa Monica Bay a priority â an urban runoff facility catches {{convert|3.5|e6USgal|m3}} of water each week that would otherwise flow into the bay. Other environmental features include miles of beaches, extensive curbside recycling, farmers' markets, community gardens, and the city's bus system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.citymayors.com/environment/us_greencities.html City Mayors: The greenest US cities&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smgov.net/epd/ Environmental Programs Division (EPD) â City of Santa Monica&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
===Bicycles===
Santa Monica has received the Bicycle Friendly Community Award (Bronze) by the [[League of American Bicyclists]] in 2009. The distinction was mostly based on the local bicycle valet program. Local bicycle advocacy organizations include Bikerowave (moved to Mar Vista in 2009) and Santa Monica Spoke. Local police cracked down on Santa Monica [[Critical Mass]] rides in 2008 and effectively discontinued this flourishing tradition.
[[File:Santa Monica PCH.jpg|thumb|[[Pacific Coast Highway (California)|Pacific Coast Highway]] running through Santa Monica]]
===Motorized vehicles===
The [[Santa Monica Freeway]] ([[Interstate 10 (California)|Interstate 10]]) begins in Santa Monica near the Pacific Ocean and heads east. The Santa Monica Freeway between Santa Monica and downtown Los Angeles has the distinction of being one of the busiest highways in all of North America. After traversing [[Los Angeles County]], I-10 crosses seven more states, terminating at [[Jacksonville, Florida]]. In Santa Monica, there is a road sign designating this route as the ''' ''Christopher Columbus Transcontinental Highway'''''. [[State Route 2 (California)|State Route 2]] ([[Santa Monica Boulevard]]) begins in Santa Monica, barely grazing [[State Route 1 (California)|State Route 1]] at [[Lincoln Boulevard (Southern California)|Lincoln Boulevard]], and continues northeast across Los Angeles County, through the [[Angeles National Forest]], crossing the [[San Gabriel Mountains]] as the [[Angeles Crest Highway]], ending in [[Wrightwood, California|Wrightwood]]. Santa Monica is also the western (Pacific) terminus of historic [[U.S. Route 66 (California)|U.S. Route 66]]. Close to the eastern boundary of Santa Monica, [[Sepulveda Boulevard]] reaches from [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]] at the south, to the northern end of the [[San Fernando Valley]]. Just east of Santa Monica is [[Interstate 405 (California)|Interstate 405, the &quot;San Diego Freeway&quot;]], a major north-south route in Los Angeles County and [[Orange County, California]].

The [[City of Santa Monica]] has purchased the first [[ZeroTruck]] [[all-electric vehicle|all-electric]]  [[medium-duty truck]].

===Bus===
The city of Santa Monica runs its own bus service, the [[Big Blue Bus]], which also serves much of [[West Los Angeles (region)|West Los Angeles]] and the [[University of California at Los Angeles]] (UCLA). A Big Blue Bus was featured prominently in the action movie ''[[Speed (1994 film)|Speed]]''.

The city of Santa Monica is also served by the [[Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority]]'s bus lines. Metro also complements Big Blue service, as when Big Blue routes are not operational overnight, Metro buses make many Big Blue Bus stops, in addition to MTA stops. It currently has no rail service but Metro is working on bringing light rail to Santa Monica in the form of the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Exposition Line]]. Since the mid-1980s, various proposals have been made to extend the [[Purple Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Purple Line]] subway to Santa Monica under Wilshire Boulevard. However, to this day, no plans to complete the &quot;subway to the sea&quot; are imminent, owing to the difficulty of funding the estimated $5 billion project. In the past, Santa Monica had rail service operated by the [[Pacific Electric Railway]], until it was dismantled in the 1960s.

===Airport and ports===
The city owns and operates a [[general aviation]] airport, [[Santa Monica Airport]], which has been the site of several important aviation achievements. Commercial flights are available for residents at [[Los Angeles International Airport]], a few miles south of Santa Monica. 

Like other cities in Los Angeles County, Santa Monica is dependent upon the [[Port of Long Beach]] and the [[Port of Los Angeles]] for international ship cargo. In the 1890s, Santa Monica was once in competition with [[Wilmington, Los Angeles, California|Wilmington, California]], and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles, California|San Pedro]] for recognition as the &quot;Port of Los Angeles&quot; (see [[History of Santa Monica, California]]).

==Medical services==
Two major hospitals are within the Santa Monica city limits, UCLA Santa Monica Hospital and St. John's Hospital. There are four fire stations providing medical and fire response within the city staffed with 6 Paramedic Engines, 1 Truck company, 1 Hazardous Materials team and 1 Urban Search &amp; Rescue team.   Santa Monica Fire Department has its own Dispatch Center.  Ambulance transportation is provided by AmeriCare Ambulance Services. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ambulance Transportation|url=http://santamonicafire.org/Content.aspx?id=11372|work=Santa Monica Fire Department|publisher=Santa Monica Fire Department}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crime==
In 2006, crime in Santa Monica affected 4.41% of the population, slightly lower than the national average crime rate that year of 4.48%.&lt;ref name=SMCrime1&gt;{{cite web
   |title=Santa Monica CA Crime Statistics (2006 Crime Data)
   |url=http://santamonica.areaconnect.com/crime1.htm
   |accessdate=25 August 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The majority of this was property crime,
which affected 3.74% of Santa Monica's population in 2006;
this was higher than
the rates for Los Angeles County (2.76%)
and California (3.17%),&lt;ref name=SMCrime2&gt;{{cite web
   |title=Crime Statistics for Santa Monica
   |url=http://www.trulia.com/real_estate/Santa_Monica-California/community-info/
   |accessdate=25 August 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
but lower than the national average (3.91%).
These per-capita crime rates are computed based on Santa Monica's full-time population of about 85,000.
However,
the [[Santa Monica Police Department]] has suggested the actual per-capita crime rate is much lower,
as tourists, workers, and beachgoers can increase the city's daytime population to between 250,000 and
450,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Violent crimes affected 0.67% of the population in Santa Monica in 2006,
in line with Los Angeles County (0.65%),
but higher than the averages for California (0.53%)
and the nation (0.55%).&lt;ref name=SMCrime1/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMCrime2/&gt;

[[Hate crime]] has typically been minimal in Santa Monica, with only one reported incident in 2007.
However, the city experienced a spike of anti-Islamic hate crime in 2001, following the attacks of [[September 11 attacks|September 11]].
Hate crime levels returned to their minimal 2000 levels by 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In 2006, Santa Monica voters passed &quot;Measure Y&quot; with a 65% majority,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which moved the issuance of citations for marijuana smoking to the bottom of the police priority list. A 2009 study by the [[Santa Monica Daily Press]] showed that since the law took effect in 2007, the Santa Monica Police had
&quot;not issued any citations for offenses involving the adult, personal use of marijuana inside private residences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news

In June of 2011, the infamous Boston gangster [[Whitey Bulger]] was arrested in Santa Monica after being a fugitive for 16 years.  He had been living in the area for 15 years.

===Gang activity===
The Pico Neighborhood of Santa Monica experiences some gang activity. The city estimates that there are fewer than 50 gang members in Santa Monica, although some community organizers dispute this claim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfsantamonica.com/ssm_site/the_lookout/news/News-2006/March-2006/03_16_06_Police_Chief_Calls_for_Regional_Approach.htm Police Chief Calls for Regional Approach to Gang Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Gang activity has been prevalent for decades in the Pico neighborhood.

In October 1998, alleged Culver City 13 gang member Omar Sevilla, 21, of Culver City was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9500E2DA143DF933A15753C1A96E958260 Death of gangster Omar Sevilla.]&lt;/ref&gt; A couple of hours after the shooting of Sevilla, German tourist Horst Fietze was killed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Tourist-Murder-Fugitive-Captured-in-Jamaica.html NBC Los Angeles report on the capture of Fietze's killer]&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later Juan Martin Campos, age 23, a Santa Monica City employer and former gang member was shot and killed. Police believe this was a retaliatory killing in response to the death of Omar Sevilla.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/29/news/mn-37325 Gang Bullets Pierce Santa Monica's Image]&lt;/ref&gt; Less than twenty-four hours later, Javier Cruz was wounded in a drive-by shooting outside his home on 17th and Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surfsantamonica.com/ssm_site/the_lookout/news/News-2004/Dec-2004/12_07_04_Youth_and_Street_Violence.htm Violence in Pico]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/oct/21/local/me-34672 |title=Police Chief to Address Public Safety Concerns|publisher=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, there was a double homicide in the Westside Clothing store on Lincoln Boulevard. During the incident, Culver City gang members David &quot;Puppet&quot; Robles and Jesse &quot;Psycho&quot; Garcia entered the store masked and began opening fire, killing Anthony and Michael Juarez. They then ran outside to a getaway vehicle driven by a third Culver City gang member, who is now also in custody.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.santamonicapd.org/press_info/PressReleases/2006/PressRelease-2006-0415-HomicideInv.htm Suspects Charged in Westside Clothing Store Shooting]&lt;/ref&gt; The clothing store was believed to be a local hang out for Santa Monica gang members. The dead included two men from Northern California who had merely been visiting the store's owner, their cousin, to see if they could open a similar store in their area. Police say the incident was in retaliation for a shooting committed by the Santa Monica 13 gang days before the Juarez brothers were gunned down.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.streetgangs.com/topics/2003/110603PARA.HTML 'Gangster's Paradise Lost']&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the rivalry with the Culver City gang, gang members also feud with the Venice and [[West Los Angeles]] gangs. The main rivals in these regions include [[Venice 13]], and [[Crips|Venice Shoreline Crips]] gangs located in the Oakwood area of [[Venice, California]].

===Literature===
[[Raymond Chandler]]'s most famous character, private detective [[Philip Marlowe]], frequently has a portion of his adventures in a place called &quot;Bay City&quot;, which is modeled on depression-era Santa Monica.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Grove Press| isbn = 0802136370, 9780802136374| last = Hiney| first = Tom
| title = Raymond Chandler| year = 1999| page = 92}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Marlowe's world, Bay City is &quot;a wide-open town&quot;, where gambling and other crimes thrive due to a massively corrupt and ineffective police force.

The setting on a certain portion of [[Mitch Albom]]'s book, [[The Five People You Meet in Heaven]], has similarities to the Pacific Pier located along the [[Santa Monica]] beach. In the book, it is named Ruby Pier. Mitch Albom even acknowledged the Pacific Pier for its cooperation.

The main character from [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]]' [[The Land That Time Forgot (novel)]] was a shipbuilder from Santa Monica.

In ''[[Al Capone Does My Shirts]]'', the Flanagans move to [[Alcatraz]] from Santa Monica.
