'''India national under-16 football team''', also known as [[India]] under-16s or India U16(s), represents [[India]] in [[association football]] at a under-16 age level and is controlled by the [[All India Football Federation]], the governing body for [[Football in India]]. The current manager is Thomas Joseph, who was appointed in July 2011.

In the last few years, the [[All India Football Federation]] has been working hard for the development of the under-16 team. Top youth development expert and British coach Colin Toal has been given the job to plan out the strategies. The team was given extensive exposure before the previous Asian meet. It included trips to the United States and England to play a series of matches.

In the US, India won most of their matches and in England, they held the [[Manchester United]] under-16 team to a draw. 

The team is given round the year extensive training at the Training Centre in [[Margao]], [[Goa]].
