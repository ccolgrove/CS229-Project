'''Regional Railways''' was one of the three passenger sectors of [[British Rail]] created in 1982 that existed until 1996, 3 years after [[Privatisation of British Rail|privatisation]]. The sector was originally called '''Provincial'''.

Regional Railways was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors. Upon formation, its costs were four times its [[revenue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=David St John | last=Thomas | coauthors=Whitehouse, Patrick | year=1990 | title=BR in the Eighties | publisher= David &amp; Charles | location=Newton Abbot | isbn=0-7153-9854-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

Upon sectorisation in 1982, the passenger sectors created were [[InterCity (British Rail)|InterCity]] (principal express services) and [[Network SouthEast]] (mainly [[London]] [[commuter]] services).&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; Provincial was responsible for all other passenger services, except in the [[metropolitan county|metropolitan counties]], where local services were managed by [[passenger transport executive]]s.

==Services==

Regional Railways inherited a diverse range of routes, comprising both express and local services. Expresses mainly ran to non-principal destinations or on less popular routes, such as [[Birmingham]] or Liverpool to [[Norwich]] or [[Liverpool]] to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]], and were chiefly operated by older locomotives and second-hand InterCity coaches. Later these services were operated by Sprinter units - mainly 158s on express services. There were also the internal [[Scottish Region]] local services and expresses, the latter including the [[Edinburgh]]-[[Glasgow]] [[Push-pull train|push-pull]] service.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt;

Local services ran on both main lines and branch lines, and were often operated by [[List of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes#First Generation|first generation diesel multiple units]] dating back to the 1950s. Longer distance trains often formed of older coaches and locomotives of [[British Rail Class 31|Class 31]], [[British Rail Class 40|Class 40]] and [[British Rail Class 45|Class 45]] which were of similar vintage.

==Development of new rolling stock==

In the early 1980s, large numbers of [[Diesel multiple unit]] (DMU) and locomotive-hauled coaches were found to contain [[asbestos]]. Removing this would be a considerable cost and generating no extra revenue, which, coupled with the increasingly unreliabile old locomotives and DMUs prompted BR to look for a new generation of diesel multiple units.

[[Image:Regional Railways logo 122100.JPG|thumb|right|Regional Railway Branding on a first generation DMU, number 122100.]]

The prototype [[British Rail Class 210|Class 210s]], in service on a trial basis since 1981, were considered too expensive to be put into production, so BR looked elsewhere for new designs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt;

===Pacers===

The first, [[Pacer (train)|''Pacers'']], used bus technology from the [[Leyland National]], in classes numbered in the [[List of British Rail diesel multiple unit classes#Pacers|14X range]]. Not long after introduction to service large numbers of them suffered from a number of technical problems, particularly with their [[Gearbox|gearboxes]]. In [[Cornwall]] it was found that their long [[wheelbase]] caused intolerable squealing noises and high [[Railway tire|tyre]] wear on tight curves, and they quickly had to be replaced by the old DMUs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt; The solution obviously lay elsewhere, although after much modification, the Pacers eventually proved themselves in traffic.

===Sprinters===

[[Image:150001 pancras.jpg|thumb|right|150001 at St Pancras after a publicity run, 1985.]] BR ideally needed something mid-way between the Pacers and the Class 210s. In 1984/1985, two experimental DMU designs were put into service: the [[BREL]] [[British Rail Class 150|Class 150]] and [[Metro-Cammell]] [[British Rail Class 151|Class 151]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Motive&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Brian | last=Morrison | coauthors=''et al.'' | year=1986 | title=Motive Power Annual 1987 | publisher= Ian Allan | location=Shepperton | isbn=0-7110-1635-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these used [[Torque converter|hydraulic transmission]] and were less bus-like than the Pacers. After trials, the Class 150 was selected for production, entering service from 1987. Reliability was much improved by the new trains, with depot visits being reduced from two or three times a week to fortnightly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt;

The late 1980s and early 1990s also saw the development of secondary express services that complemented the mainline [[InterCity (British Rail)|Intercity]] routes. [[British Rail Class 155|Class 155]] and [[British Rail Class 156|Class 156]] Sprinters were developed to replace locomotive-hauled trains on these services; their interiors being designed with longer distance journeys in mind. In particular, key  Scottish and Transpennine routes were upgraded with new [[British Rail Class 158|Class 158]] Express Sprinters, while a network of '[[Alphaline]]' services was introduced elsewhere in the country.

By the end of the 1980s, passenger numbers had increased and costs had been reduced to two-and-a-half times revenue.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomas&quot;/&gt;

==Livery==

From 1986, Provincial adopted a version of the prototype Class 150 livery: &quot;aircraft&quot; blue over white, with a light blue stripe at waist level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fox&quot;&gt;{{cite book | first=Peter | last=Fox | year=1988 | title=Locomotives and Coaching Stock 1989 | publisher=Platform 5 | isbn=0-9065-7993-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; All new units, plus a few existing ones, such as selected [[British Rail Class 304|Class 304]] [[Electric Multiple Unit|EMU]]s, received it. Some units and coaches received the livery with '''ScotRail''' or '''Trans-Pennine''' branding.

The Class 158s, introduced in 1989, appeared in &quot;Express&quot; livery: dark grey window surrounds over light grey, with light and dark blue stripes at waist level. This colour scheme was also applied to some Class 156 units around privatisation.

The final vehicle to carry Regional Railways livery was a class 153, which was repainted in July 2008 into [[East Midlands Trains]] livery.

==Split for privatisation==
As part of the process of privatisation between 1994 and 1997, Regional Railways was split into several different shadow train operating units, which later became independent train operating companies:&lt;ref name=&quot;Knight&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | editor-first=Steven | editor-last=Knight | year=1997 | title=A comprehensive guide to Britain's new railway | publisher= EMAP Apex Publications | location=Peterborough | issn=368-437X }}&lt;/ref&gt;
