'''SM Aura''' in Taguig aims to be the first mall in the country to be certified via LEED or Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, the internationally recognized standard for green building design and construction developed by the USGBC. SM Prime is undertaking other green initiatives, particularly with its new malls, which will be announced on their opening dates. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sminvestments.com/smic/?p=250|title=SM Aura Taguig first LEED Mall in the Philippines|last=Camus|first= Miguel|date=2011-08-01|publisher=SM Investments}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning of SM Aura==
The design of the shopping center is still being finalized but sources say it would cater to the upper market owing to its proximity to Ayalaâs residential and commercial developments Serendra and Bonifacio High Street. Currently, Ayalaâs mall development [[Market! Market!]] caters to all shoppers' basic needs along with some known local and imported brands.

âWe expect to complete the shopping center by 2011,â added the source privy to the negotiations.

The SM groupâs expansion in Taguig, the source added, indicates its bullish outlook on the countryâs fundamentals despite the challenges brought by the global financial crisis.

The Taguig property is part of the donation given by the Bases Conversion and Development Authority to the local government as its share in the Bonifacio Global City project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://demo.mci.com.ph/smprime/?p=587&amp;type=2&amp;sec=49&amp;aid=2505/|title=SM to build shopping complex near The Fort|last=Madrilejos-Reyes|first=Honey|date=2009-03-03|publisher=Business Mirror|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
