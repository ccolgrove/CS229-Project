The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Oakland Raiders]] season''' was the team's forty-ninth season. The Raiders improved upon their 4â12 record from [[2007 Oakland Raiders season|2007]]. This was also the first time in four seasons that the team did not play both contestants from the previous [[Super Bowl]], playing the [[New England Patriots]], but not the [[New York Giants]]. This was also the first time in six seasons the club did not finish 4th in their division, but stood alone at third instead (they shared the spot with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] the previous season).

The Raiders began their 2008 campaign at home against their AFC West rival, the [[Denver Broncos]], in the second game of [[Monday Night Football]]'s doubleheader.  In the first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Broncos QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] completed a 26-yard TD pass to WR [[Eddie Royal]].  In the second quarter, the Raiders continued to trail as kicker [[Matt Prater]] got a 26-yard field goal, while FB [[Michael Pittman]] got a 3-yard TD run. In the third quarter, Oakland got even more black and blue as Cutler completed a 48-yard TD pass to WR [[Darrell Jackson]], while Prater nailed a 43-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders finally got on the board as QB [[JaMarcus Russell]] completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR [[Ashley Lelie]].  Denver ended its rout with RB [[Selvin Young]]'s 5-yard TD run and Pittman's 1-yard TD run.  Oakland would close the game with Russell's 4-yard TD pass to WR [[Ronald Curry]].

With the dismal loss, the Raiders began their season at 0â1 for the sixth straight year.

Hoping to rebound from their horrendous home loss to the Broncos, the Raiders flew to [[Arrowhead Stadium]] for a Week 2 AFC West showdown with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]]. In the first quarter, Oakland came out punching as kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] nailed a 56-yard and a 25-yard field goal. After a scoreless second quarter, rookie RB [[Darren McFadden]] picked up his first-ever career touchdown in the third quarter on a 19-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, the Raiders increased its lead with Janikowski getting a 40-yard field goal. The Chiefs would respond with their only score of the game as QB [[Tyler Thigpen]] completed a 2-yard TD pass to TE [[Tony Gonzalez (tight end)|Tony Gonzalez]] (along with a two-point conversion pass to FB [[Mike Cox (American football)|Mike Cox]]).  Oakland would close out the game with rookie RB [[Michael Bush]] getting a 32-yard TD run.

With the win, the Raiders improved to 1â1.

Darren McFadden (21 carries for 164 yards and a touchdown) would become the first rookie Raider to run for 100 yards since [[Bo Jackson]] in 1987.  Also, the Raiders' combined rushing attack would reach 300 yards for the first time since November 1987.

The defense's improvement from Week 1 showed, as they limited Kansas City to 8 points, which is the lowest that Oakland ever allowed since December 28, 2002 (7 point from San Diego).

===Week 3: at Buffalo Bills===

Hoping to build off their divisional road win over the Chiefs, the Raiders flew to [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] for a Week 3 duel with the [[Buffalo Bills]]. In the first quarter, Oakland got the early lead with kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] getting a 23-yard and a 35-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Bills responded with RB [[Marshawn Lynch]] getting a 14-yard TD run. The Raiders would end the half with Janikowski kicking a 32-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Raiders increased its lead with QB [[JaMarcus Russell]] getting a 1-yard TD run. However, in the fourth quarter, Buffalo started to rally as Lynch got a 3-yard TD run. Oakland would respond as Russell completed an 84-yard TD pass to WR [[Johnnie Lee Higgins]], yet the Bills got near as QB [[Trent Edwards]] completed a 14-yard TD pass to WR [[Roscoe Parrish]]. Later, Buffalo completed its rally as kicker [[Rian Lindell]] nailed the game-winning 38-yard field goal.

With the heart-breaking loss, the Raiders fell to 1â2.

After the game, [[Chris Mortensen]] of [[ESPN]] and [[Jay Glazer]] of [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] both erroneously reported that [[Lane Kiffin]] would be fired the following Monday; this turned out not to be the case, as Kiffin was coaching the team during Week 4.

Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Bills, the Raiders went home for a Week 4 AFC West duel with the [[San Diego Chargers]].  In the first quarter, Oakland struck first as kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] got a 22-yard goal, with Safety [[Gibril Wilson]] sacking Chargers QB [[Philip Rivers]] in his endzone for a safety.  In the second quarter, the Raiders increased their lead with QB [[JaMarcus Russell]] completing a 63-yard TD pass to TE [[Zach Miller]], along with Janikowski kicking a 28-yard field goal.

Just prior to halftime, Janikowski attempted to kick a 76 yard field goal, a full 13 yards longer than the NFL record and seven yards longer than the record at any level of gridiron football. Predictably, the kick fell well short, not even reaching the end zone (much less the goal posts), and the ball was picked up by Chargers cornerback [[Antonio Cromartie]].

In the third quarter, the Chargers got on the board with kicker [[Nate Kaeding]]'s 28-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, San Diego took the lead with Rivers' 9-yard TD pass to TE [[Antonio Gates]] and RB [[LaDainian Tomlinson]]'s 13-yard TD run (along with a successful 2-point conversion pass from Rivers to RB [[Darren Sproles]]). Oakland tried to prevent another collapse as Janikowski got a 32-yard field goal. However, the Chargers sealed the win with Kaeding nailing a 47-yard field goal and Tomlinson getting a 41-yard TD run.

With the loss, the Raiders went into their bye week at 1â3.

The following Tuesday, Lane Kiffin was officially fired as head coach and was replaced by offensive line coach [[Tom Cable]].

In the second quarter, the Saints took the lead as RB [[Reggie Bush]] got a 3-yard TD run, along with kicker [[Taylor Mehlhaff]] getting a 44-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Saints increased their lead as QB [[Drew Brees]] completed an 8-yard TD pass to RB [[Aaron Stecker]] and a 15-yard TD pass to Bush.
