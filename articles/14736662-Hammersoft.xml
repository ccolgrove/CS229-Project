'''Forever the Sickest Kids''' is an American pop punk band from [[Dallas, Texas]], who have yet to be signed to a new label after the closure of [[Universal Motown Records]]. In issue 228 of ''[[Alternative Press (music magazine)|Alternative Press]]'', the group was named the number one underground band in the &quot;22 Best Underground Bands&quot;. Their first EP, ''[[Television Off, Party On (EP)|Television Off, Party On]]'', was released on July 3, 2007. Their debut album, ''[[Underdog Alma Mater]]'', was later released on April 29, 2008.

==History==
===Formation and ''Underdog Alma Mater'' (2006-2008)===

While browsing [[PureVolume]], lead singer Jonathan Cook accidentally spent $350 that the band did not have to receive a front page placement of a song that they also did not have. For this reason, they went into the studio and wrote &quot;Hey Brittany&quot;, then recorded it with their producer Geoff Rockwell in a matter of days. Since it was first posted, &quot;Hey Brittany&quot; has garnered many Internet plays and triggered a bidding war among eight record labels.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} On April 24, 2007, Universal Motown emerged victorious, and released the band's ''[[Television Off, Party On (EP)|Television Off, Party On]]'' EP on July 3. The releases of ''[[The Sickest Warped Tour EP]]'' and the ''[[Hot Party Josh]'' would soon follow.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The band's first single, &quot;[[Whoa Oh! (Me vs. Everyone)]]&quot;, was released on April 20, 2008. Their debut album ''[[Underdog Alma Mater]]'' was later released on April 29, and their second single, &quot;[[She's a Lady (FTSK song)|She's a Lady]]&quot; was released on July 14.
