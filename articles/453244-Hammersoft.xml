Groban debuted as a singer in the seventh grade. His music teacher chose him to sing a solo of &quot;S'wonderful&quot; at the school's Cabaret Night, where he sang alone on stage for the first time.  At this time, he was more focused on theatrical arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;jglive-bio&quot;/&gt; In the summers of 1997 and 1998, he also attended the [[Interlochen Center for the Arts]] Camp in Michigan,&lt;ref name=&quot;big&quot;/&gt; majoring in music theatre, and began taking vocal lessons.  Groban went on to attend the [[Los Angeles County High School for the Arts]] as a theatre major and graduated in 1999.&lt;ref name=&quot;big&quot;/&gt;  He was admitted to [[Carnegie Mellon University]], intending to study drama, but he left four months into his first semester.  Offered a recording contract, he decided to pursue his singing career.&lt;ref name=&quot;big&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
===Early career===
In late 1998, the 17-year-old Groban was introduced by his [[vocal coach]] to [[Grammy Award|Grammy]]-winning producer/arranger [[David Foster]] and future manager Brian Avnet.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;/&gt; At the time Groban had no recording experience and was preparing to begin studying at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;/&gt; Groban worked for David Foster as a rehearsal singer on a series of high-profile events, including the January 1999 inauguration of [[Gray Davis]] as Governor of [[California]] and the [[41st Grammy Awards|1999 Grammy Awards]] where&amp;nbsp;â as a stand-in for [[Andrea Bocelli]]&amp;nbsp;â he rehearsed Foster's &quot;[[The Prayer (CÃ©line Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]]&quot; with [[Celine Dion|CÃ©line Dion]]. According to manager Avnet, Groban was very nervous about standing in for Bocelli and had to be talked into it, but his performance prompted the show hostess, [[Rosie O'Donnell]], to ask him to appear on [[The Rosie O'Donnell Show|her show]] the following week, which then led to an appearance on the [[Ally McBeal]] show.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hitquarters.com/index.php3?page=intrview/opar/intrview_BrianAvnetInterview.html |title=Interview with Brian Avnet |publisher=[[HitQuarters]]|date=16 Feb 2004 |accessdate=21 Dec 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David E. Kelley]], creator of the television series ''[[Ally McBeal]],'' created a character, Malcolm Wyatt, for Groban in the season finale aired in May 2001. The character of Malcolm Wyatt was so popular, prompting 8,000 emails from viewers,&lt;ref name=joshofcl/&gt; that Groban was asked to return the next season to reprise his role and perform &quot;[[To Where You Are]].&quot; Avnet claims this sequence of events effectively got Groban's career off the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;/&gt;

Groban was offered a recording contract at [[Warner Bros. Records]] through Foster's [[143 Records]] imprint. Avnet told [[HitQuarters]] that Warner initially proved resistant to the deal because &quot;They were afraid they wouldnât be able to get a voice like that on radio.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;hitquarters.com&quot;/&gt; Explaining his reasons for signing the artist, Foster said: &quot;I love his natural ability in the pop and rock arena, but I love his sense of classics even more. He's a true musical force to be reckoned with.&quot;&lt;ref name=joshofcl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joshgroban.com/ |title=Official Josh Groban site |publisher=Joshgroban.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Foster's influence, Groban's first album focused more on classics such as &quot;Gira Con Me Questa Notte&quot; and &quot;Alla Luce Del Sole.&quot;

Groban performed &quot;[[There for Me (Sarah Brightman song)|There For Me]]&quot; with [[Sarah Brightman]] on her 2000â01 ''La Luna World Tour'', and was featured on her &quot;La Luna&quot; concert DVD. He recorded &quot;For Always&quot; with [[Lara Fabian]] on the movie soundtrack to ''[[A.I. (film)|A.I.: Artificial Intelligence]]'' (2001). Groban performed in many benefit shows, including: &quot;The Andre Agassi Grand Slam Event For Children,&quot; singing alongside [[Elton John]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Don Henley]], and [[Robin Williams]]; &quot;Muhammad Ali's Fight Night Foundation&quot; which honored [[Michael J. Fox]] and others; &quot;The Family Celebration&quot; (2001), which was co-hosted by President [[Bill Clinton]] and his wife, [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], and [[David E. Kelley]] and his wife, [[Michelle Pfeiffer]]; and Michael Milken's CapCure event, which raises funds for cancer research.

The singer's self-titled debut album ''[[Josh Groban (album)|Josh Groban]]'' was released on November 20, 2001. Over the next year, it went from [[Music recording sales certification|gold]] to [[Music recording sales certification|double-platinum]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riaa.com/news/newsletter/120602.asp New Sets By Industry Vets Post Strong Sales]{{Dead link|date=August 2010}} ''[[RIAA]] newsletter December 4, 2002''&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2002, he performed &quot;To Where You Are&quot; and sang &quot;[[The Prayer (Celine Dion and Andrea Bocelli song)|The Prayer]]&quot; in a duet with [[Sissel KyrkjebÃ¸]] at the [[Nobel Peace Prize Concert]] in Oslo, Norway.
