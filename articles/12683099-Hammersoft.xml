==Overview ==
Before the series, Katherine was married to abusive police officer [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Wayne Davis|Wayne Davis]] ([[Gary Cole]]). Together, they had a daughter named Dylan (Hailee Denham). Wayne became increasingly violent, forcing Katherine to flee with Dylan (Hailee Denham), and seek refuge with her aunt, [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Lillian Simms|Lillian Simms]] ([[Ellen Geer]]). While living on Wisteria Lane, Katherine befriends her neighbours, [[Mary Alice Young]] and [[Susan Mayer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;know&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Now You Know (Desperate Housewives)|Now You Know]]&quot;.

Season 4, no. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; One night, Katherine returned to find Wayne had visited Dylan and gave her a new doll. Katherine put the doll on top of a [[chest of drawers|dresser]].&lt;ref name=&quot;free&quot; /&gt; and got into a fight with Wayne, hitting him with a candlestick. After Wayne left, Katherine and Lillian discover Dylan had tried to retrieve her doll and died when the dresser fell on top of her. Fearing Wayneâs wrath, Katherine and Lillian buried Dylan in nearby woods and left Wisteria Lane, telling Susan and Mary Alice that she had taken a job offer in Chicago.&lt;ref name=&quot;smiles&quot; /&gt; 

Katherine adopted a girl very similar to Dylan from a Romanian orphanage. &lt;ref name=&quot;free&quot; /&gt; Katherine began raising her adopted daughter, [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Dylan Mayfair|Dylan]] ([[Lyndsy Fonseca]]), and they moved to Chicago. Eventually, Katherine married [[gynecologist]] [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Adam Mayfair|Adam Mayfair]] ([[Nathan Fillion]]). Katherine tells Adam that Wayne killed her biological daughter and he agrees to keep her secret and protect them from her ex-husband. Years later, the Mayfairs move to Wisteria Lane to care for Lillian, now terminally ill, and escape the humiliation of Adam's alleged sexual harassment of one of his patients.

===Season Four===
Twelve years after leaving Wisteria Lane, Katherine, Adam and Dylan move in to Lillian's house. Susan introduces Katherine to Bree, Lynette and Gabrielle, her friends and neighbours; Katherine immediately clashes with each of them, particularly Bree. Meanwhile, Dylan doesn't remember living on Wisteria Lane. Katherine begins integrating herself into Susan's circle of friends but continues to conflict with Bree, Gabrielle and Lynette. Katherine's mysterious and cold exterior and Dylanâs lack of memories about life on Wisteria Lane raise the suspicions of their neighbours. Dylan questions Katherine about her birth father but Katherine only says that he is too dangerous to let back into their lives. 

Lillian moves into the Mayfairs' guest bedroom and writes a detailed account of the original Dylanâs death in a note addressed to Dylan Mayfair, but dies before she can give it to her. [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Sylvia Greene|Sylvia Greene]] ([[Melora Walters]]), the woman who accused Adam of sexual harassment in Chicago, visits him - hoping to rekindle their romance. Katherine thinks Sylvia's accusations are false but Adam admits having had an affair with her, which is why he settled out of court and they &quot;lost everything&quot; in Chicago. Katherine kicks Adam out of the house. While packing, he finds Lillian's note and leaves after confronting Katherine about her lies and she throws the note in the fire. However, Dylan salvages a few pieces and deducts that Katherine killed Wayne. She calls Adam for more answers but he calls Katherine. He promises to give her one last alibi and lie to Dylan but their marriage is still over. 

Katherine and Bree put aside their rivalry to start a catering business. Meanwhile, Wayne tracks down Dylan and the two start meeting in private; eventually, she reintroduces the two. Hoping to drive Wayne away, Katherine tells him that Dylan is not his daughter and a DNA test confirms that. Adam learns that Wayne has located Katherine and Dylan and offers to help them escape, deciding to take Dylan on a graduation trip and never return but Wayne kidnaps Adam. Fearing Wayne has killed Adam, Katherine begs Dylan to leave immediately but Dylan demands the entire truth. Katherine tells her, prompting Dylan to walk out. Later, Wayne corners Katherine and takes her hostage. Before he can shoot her, Adam arrives. Knowing Wayne will always track her, Katherine shoots him. Bree, Susan, Lynette, and Gabrielle tell the police that her actions were in self-defence and Katherine is finally integrated into their social group. Dylan returns and reunites with her mother.

===Season Five===
During the five years between seasons four and five, Katherine remains on Wisteria Lane.  Katherine briefly moves in with Bree, a recovering alcoholic who relapses when her husband, [[Orson Hodge]] ([[Kyle MacLachlan]]), leaves for jail.&lt;ref name=&quot;mirror&quot;&gt;&quot;[[Mirror Mirror (Desperate Housewives)|Mirror, Mirror]]&quot;. [[David Grossman (director)|David Grossman]] (director), [[Jeff Greenstein]] (writer). ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. October 26, 2008. Season 5, no. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;Katherine's rivalry with Bree continues despite their shared business. Katherine is unhappy when she realises that Bree has used her recipes in her cookbook and leaves her to run the business while she publicises it. Her resentment deepens when Bree hires Orson as an employee. Yearning for romance, Katherine secretly begins dating [[Mike Delfino]] ([[James Denton]]), Susan's ex-husband. Eventually, Susan finds out about the relationship and feels betrayed. She eventually gives them her blessing but is uncomfortable with their relationship.

Katherine begins spending more time with Susan and Mike's son, [[Acquaintances of Susan Mayer#M.J. Delfino|M.J.]] ([[Mason Vale Cotton (actor)|Mason Vale Cotton]]) and move in together. Susan tells Mike and Katherine that she's marrying Jackson but is horrified to learn that Mike will no longer have to pay her alimony. Katherine deceives Susan by letting her think Mike will pay alimony regardless. When Susan wants to thank Mike herself, Katherine admits not telling him that Susan's engagement to Jackson isn't real, afraid that he would leave her for Susan. The couple elope to [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], but Mike leaves Katherine at the airport when he learns that their neighbour, [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Dave Williams|Dave Williams]] ([[Neal McDonough]]), plans to kill M.J. in revenge. M.J. escapes unharmed and Mike and Susan share a passionate kiss following the ordeal.

===Season Six===
In the [[Nice is Different Than Good|sixth season premiere]], it is revealed that Mike married Susan, not Katherine. When Susan is out, her wedding dress is delivered to Katherine's house. Katherine wears it while cooking to annoy Susan. She also demands that Susan publicly apologize to her for taking Mike away. Susan initially refuses and locks her in a closet, Katherine then breaks free and crashes the wedding. Susan then apologizes, but Katherine's feelings remain bitter. When Susan is away, Katherine visits Mike, gives him a kiss and tells him she'll be there for him. Katherine then tells Orson that Mike made a pass at her, hoping this will get back to Susan. Bree becomes concerned when she sees Katherine spying through Susan and Mike's windows one night. After an incident at a wedding they were catering, Bree fires Katherine and advises her to seek professional help. Furious, Katherine scratches Bree's car. 

Katherine's rivalry with Susan intensifies as she continues pursuing Mike. Things come to a head at a neighborhood watch meeting after Susan ignores Katherine when she tries to volunteer, escalating into Susan publicly threatening Katherine if she doesn't leave her and Mike alone. Realizing the danger Katherine poses, Susan begins suspecting Katherine attacked her daughter, [[Acquaintances of Susan Mayer#Julie Mayer|Julie Mayer]], out of revenge. Though Katherine has an alibi, Susan and Mike's fears about Katherine are soon realized. When Mike hears Katherine told M.J. that Susan is a bad mother, he coldly tells her that he never loved her. When he leaves, Katherine stabs herself in the stomach with a knife that has Mike's fingerprints on it. Katherine frames Mike and he is sent to jail while she is in hospital. Susan worries that Katherine has suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] and asks Dylan to visit and have her mother committed for psychiatric observation. She then learns that Katherine has been telling Dylan that she, not Susan, was married to Mike. When Katherine realizes she's been caught, she has a complete breakdown. Katherine is institutionalized for a couple of months. 
 
When Katherine returns to Wisteria Lane, she develops a friendship with [[List of Desperate Housewives characters#Robin Gallagher|Robin Gallagher]] ([[Julie Benz]]), a former stripper who moves in with Susan and Mike. In order to preserve her friendship with Susan, Robin moves in with Katherine. Katherine is surprised to learn that Robin is a lesbian and begins to develop a physical attraction to her, as well as an emotional connection. Katherine is very confused by these new feelings. Soon, the two become sexually involved. When their relationship is made public, Katherine decides that she cares too much about what others think and suggests that she and Robin take a vacation in Paris while they work on defining their relationship. Robin agrees and the two leave town that night.
