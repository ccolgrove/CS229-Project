The '''HTC Evo 3D''' is an [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.3 (&quot;Gingerbread&quot;) smartphone that allows for the creation and viewing of 3D content through the use of two 5&amp;nbsp;[[Pixel#Megapixel|MP]] rear-facing cameras and a glasses-free 3D-capable 4.3&quot; [[qHD]] touch screen. In the United States, the Evo 3D is available exclusively on the [[Sprint Nextel|Sprint/Nextel network]]. Several GSM variants are also available in Canada, Europe and Asia. 

==History==
Sprint announced the HTC Evo 3D during [[CTIA]] in Orlando, Florida, on March 22, 2011. On May 2, [[Best Buy]] employees received permission to start receiving pre-orders for the HTC Evo 3D, but only if a customer who was not planning on buying a currently available model specifically requested it.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

On May 19, 2011, information was leaked on various websites of a possible June 4 release date for the phone. The leak appeared to originate from an internal [[Radio Shack]] email.

On May 24, 2011, it was confirmed that the Evo 3D has been locked down with a cryptographically signed bootloader, recovery, and kernel image - thereby most likely foreclosing custom roms such as [[CyanogenMod]]. On May 24, 2011 HTC released a statement via Facebook, saying that they are reviewing their bootloader policy. On May 26, 2011 Peter Chou, the CEO of HTC, announced on Facebook that &quot;we will no longer be locking the bootloaders on our devices.&quot; &lt;ref name='HTC bootloader unlocking'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.facebook.com/HTC/posts/10150307320018084 | title = There has been... | accessdate = 2011-05-28 | last = Chou | first = Peter | date = 2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Radio Shack ad leaked the price for the Evo 3D at [[United States dollar|US]]$199.99 or $600.00 with 2-year contract and $499.99 without contract, with a trade in credit on the [[HTC Evo 4G]] or Evo Shift of $100.

A second Radio Shack ad leaked on June 1 indicated that the Evo 3D will be released on June 24, with pre-orders ending on June 24. It maintained that the Evo 3D will be $100 off with the trade in of either the [[HTC Evo 4G]] or the [[HTC Evo Shift 4G]]

On June 6, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Savov|first=Vlad|title=HTC Evo 3D Launches June 24th|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/06/06/htc-evo-3d-launches-on-june-24th-for-200-joined-by-evo-view-4g/|work=Blog Post|accessdate=7 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Sprint officially announced that the HTC Evo 3D will be available on June 24, 2011. Internet retailer Wirefly posted a [http://www.wirefly.com/learn/android/htc-evo-3d-review/ video review of the HTC EVO 3D] on June 6, 2011.  It was also reported the phone would be available wordwide, and in Canada on the Rogers network.

On July 27, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=GSMArena|title=Vodafone UK dumping the upcoming GSM HTC EVO 3D|url=http://www.gsmarena.com/vodafone_uk_dumping_the_upcoming_gsm_htc_evo_3d-news-2940.php|=Blog Post|accessdate=27 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, Vodafone UK announced that it will not offer the HTC Evo 3D citing delays and has removed it from its coming soon page. 

A spokesman for the company states:
:&quot;Thereâs been speculation recently regarding availability of HTC EVO 3D.
 
:We can confirm that due to delays in the launch of the HTC EVO 3D, we no longer intend to include the device in our smartphone range. Weâll be contacting any customers who registered their interest shortly.
 
:We realize this might come as a disappointment, but weâve got some really exciting handsets in the pipeline. Keep an eye on our coming soon section for all the latest information about the products coming to Vodafone.&quot;

The EVO 3D has since been released in Australia as of September 2011 by both Telstra and Vodafone using GSM/3G networking.
