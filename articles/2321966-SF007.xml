{{nihongo|'''Kangaroo Notebook'''|ã«ã³ã¬ã«ã¼ã»ãã¼ã|KangarÅ« NÅto}} (published 1991) is a novel written by the [[Japan]]ese writer [[KÅbÅ Abe]] between ca. 1973 - 1977.

==Plot summary==

One morning, while pondering the stress of his latest assignment at his uninspiring job, the narrator of Kangaroo Notebook feels an itching on his leg that seems to indicate an unusual hair loss. The next morning he wakes to discover that he is sprouting small radishes on his shins. After battling to be seen in his local medical clinic, he enters a hospital, where a physician prescribes hot-spring therapy in Hell Valley.

Hooked to a penile catheter and an IV bottle, the narrator begins a harrowing journey on his hospital bed through the underworld that seems to lie beneath the city streets. Here, he seeks health not so much as he seeks simple explanations for what is happening to him and the strange people he meets: abusive ferrymen, waiflike child demons, vampire nurses, a chiropractor who runs a karate school and works a sideline as a euthanist.

==Miscellaneous==

[[Hideo Kojima]] has cited Kangaroo Notebook as his inspiration for [[Metal Gear Solid 2]].
