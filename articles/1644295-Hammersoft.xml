'''TCF Bank Stadium''', sometimes referred to as either &quot;'''The Bank'''&quot; or &quot;'''The Gopher Hole''',&quot; is the [[American football|football]] [[stadium]] for the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|Minnesota Golden Gophers]] college football team at the [[University of Minnesota]] in [[Minneapolis|Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. The 50,805 seat on-[[campus]] &quot;[[horseshoe]]&quot; style stadium is [[Building design|designed]] to support future expansion to seat up to 80,000 people, and it cost $288.5&amp;nbsp;million to build.

TCF Bank Stadium is the first of three spectator sports stadiums that either have been built or are being considered for the major tenants of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] â the Gophers and two professional teams, the [[Minnesota Twins]] baseball and [[Minnesota Vikings]] football teams.&lt;ref name=mpr5906 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Weiner, Jay|title=Getting our Fix|date=November 2007|work=Minnesota Monthly|url=http://www.minnesotamonthly.com/media/Minnesota-Monthly/November-2007/Getting-our-Fix/|publisher=Greenspring Media Group|accessdate=2007-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Served by [[Hiawatha Line|existing]] and [[Central Corridor (Minnesota)|under construction]] light rail, the three stadiums are located within a {{convert|1.25|mi|km}} radius loosely centered at the [[Guthrie Theater]] on the [[Mississippi River]] in downtown Minneapolis.  

==History==
TCF Bank is the third on-campus stadium and fourth stadium used for University of Minnesota football. Previous fields have been [[Northrop Field]], [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]], and [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]].

==Location==
The TCF Bank Stadium site is located on the northeast side of the Minneapolis campus, near the site of the former [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]]. The stadium's site had been the location of the Huron Boulevard Parking Complex, where the university's four largest parking lots were located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Stadium Location  | publisher = University of Minnesota via Internet Archive  | date = July 18, 2006  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/location.html#   | accessdate = 2006-12-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060502063337/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/location.html# |archivedate = 2006-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The address is 2009 University Ave S.E.&lt;ref name = &quot;logo&quot;&gt;{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium Logo Unveiling Signals Start of Construction Phase | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = July 11, 2007 | url = http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8400&amp;ATCLID=1087853 | accessdate = 2007-07-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The stadium is part of a 75-acre (.3&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) expansion of the Twin Cities campus, the largest since the [[University of Minnesota#West Bank|West Bank]] was built in the 1960s. Current plans for the area call for the construction of as many as ten new academic buildings by 2015.&lt;ref name=&quot;stribmjs&quot; /&gt; The proposed [[Central Corridor (Minnesota)|Central Corridor]] [[light rail]] transit line is expected to run near the stadium, with a [[Stadium Village Station|station]] in [[Stadium Village, Minneapolis|Stadium Village]] serving the facility. Construction of the Central Corridor is scheduled to begin in 2010 and be completed by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Central Corridor Light-Rail Transit Factsheet  | publisher = Metropolitan Council  | month = December | year = 2006  | url = http://metrocouncil.org/about/facts/CentralCorridorFacts.pdf  | format = PDF  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Environmental Impact Assessment|environmental impact assessment]] of the stadium site was conducted by the university between December 2004 and March 2006 at a cost of $1.5&amp;nbsp;million.  The results were approved by the Board of Regents on March 27, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Environmental Review Process  | publisher = University of Minnesota via Internet Archive  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/environmental_review.html  | accessdate = 2009-06-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807144513/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/environmental_review.html |archivedate = 2007-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==
TCF Bank Stadium is a horseshoe-style stadium which organizers said would have a &quot;traditional collegiate look and feel&quot;.&lt;ref name=newcost /&gt;  The first phase of the construction includes approximately 50,805 seats, with the design able to support future expansion of up to 80,000 seats.  There are 39 suites, 59 loge boxes, and 300 indoor club seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Stadium Features  | publisher = University of Minnesota via Internet Archive  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/features.html  | accessdate = 2007-05-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071025005557/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/features.html |archivedate = 2007-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 7, 2006, the university announced that the stadium's field would be laid out in an east-west configuration, with the open end of the stadium facing campus.  This layout, similar to that of Memorial Stadium, provides a view of downtown Minneapolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;stribmjs&quot;&gt;{{cite news  | last = Smetanka  | first = Mary Jane  | title = Gophers' stadium costs expected to rise  | publisher = Star Tribune  | date =  December 7, 2006 | url = http://www.startribune.com/512/story/861532.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scoreboard for the stadium was designed and built by [[Daktronics]] at a cost of $9&amp;nbsp;million.

On September 17, 2009, the University of Minnesota announced that TCF Bank Stadium was awarded [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] Silver Certification, the first college or professional football stadium to achieve LEED certification.&lt;ref name=LEED&gt;{{cite web | title = TCF Bank Stadium achieves LEED Certification | url = http://www.gophersports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=8400&amp;ATCLID=204796278 | accessdate = 2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;


==Stadium proposal==
The push for a new on-campus stadium for the Golden Gopher football team began in the fall of 2000. The university cited poor revenue and lack of a college football atmosphere at the off-campus [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]] as their main reasons for wanting to move back on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Hippert  | first = Rebecca  | title = Student senate minutes  | publisher = University of Minnesota Student Senate  | date = April 19, 2001  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/usenate/ssen/010419stu.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Pugmire  | first = Tim  | title = U of M may go it alone in stadium chase  | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio  | date = December 13, 2002  | url = http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200212/13_pugmiret_stadium/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A plan for a joint [[Minnesota Vikings]]/University of Minnesota football stadium was proposed in 2002, but differences over how the stadium would be designed and managed, as well as state budget constraints, led to the plan's failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Scheck  | first = Tom  | title = Committee kills Vikings stadium plan | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio | date = February 18, 2002  | url = http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200202/18_khoom_stadiums/index.shtml | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2003 a highly publicized attempt was made by [[T. Denny Sanford]] to be the lead donor for the project, but in early 2004 the plan fell through when the two parties were unable to come to an agreement on the financial terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Tibbetts  | first = Than  | title = Officials: Stadium plan must progress  | publisher = Minnesota Daily via Internet Archive  | date = October 19, 2004  | url = http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/10/19/10766  | accessdate =  |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080211104334/http://www.mndaily.com/articles/2004/10/19/10766 |archivedate = February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The university unveiled preliminary stadium drawings and a general plan to seek state money and donations in December 2003. On March 24, 2005, the university and TCF Bank announced a deal that would have the bank contribute $35&amp;nbsp;million towards the project which would give them naming rights.&lt;ref name=newstadium&gt;{{cite web  | title = TCF Financial Corporation gives $35&amp;nbsp;million  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = March 24, 2005  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Gophers_new_TCF_Bank_Stadium.html  | accessdate = 2006-01-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The deal was given an expiration date of December 31, 2005; time enough for the [[Minnesota Legislature]] to provide the bulk of funding needed to make the project a reality.&lt;ref name=dec31&gt;{{cite web  | title = Stadium sponsorship agreement with TCF extended  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = December 28, 2005  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Stadium_sponsorship_agreement_with_TCF_extended.html  | accessdate = 2005-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the remainder of 2005 the university concentrated on drafting a stadium proposal that would draw the support of state [[politician]]s.  The final plan proposed that the state of Minnesota would contribute 40% of the stadium cost while the university would raise the remaining 60% on its own.  Portions of that 60% were to be funded by the TCF naming rights, while the remainder would come from a $50 per semester student fee, private donations, the sale of 2,840&amp;nbsp;acres (11.5&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of university land in rural [[Dakota County, Minnesota|Dakota County]] back to the state, and game day parking revenue.&lt;ref name=newstadium /&gt;  Even though the university proposal drew widespread legislative support, the stadium effort suffered a setback when the 2005 legislative session ended before the stadium [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] could be heard.&lt;ref name=&quot;leg&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = At the Legislature | publisher = University of Minnesota via Internet Archive | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html  | accessdate = 2006-12-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070109075654/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/legislature.html |archivedate = 2007-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late in 2005 when it became evident that this would happen, the university and TCF Bank announced that it had extended the naming rights deal to June 30, 2006.&lt;ref name=dec31 /&gt;

[[Image:TCF Bank Stadium opener.jpg|thumb|The opening game at TCF Bank Stadium; September 12, 2009 vs. Air Force.]]
Despite the 2005 session having ended with the bill not even coming to a vote, the stadium effort did not lose momentum in the legislature and was introduced quickly in the 2006 session.  On April 6, 2006, the [[Minnesota House of Representatives]] passed the stadium bill on a 103&amp;ndash;30 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for H.F.

The proposed funding that was removed was to be replaced with a state wide [[tax]] on [[sports memorabilia]]. It also would have required the stadium to be named Veterans Memorial Stadium (which would be similar to the previous on-campus football stadium Memorial Stadium, which was last used in 1981 and then demolished in 1992).&lt;ref name=mpr5906&gt;{{cite news  | last = Sheck  | first = Tom  | title = Senate passes stadium bills for Twins, Gophers, and Vikings  | publisher = Minnesota Public Radio  | date = May 9, 2006  | url = http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2006/05/09/gopherstadium/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]] stated he supported the House version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Legislative approval 2006==
Even though the differences between the House and Senate bills were major, the details were ironed out and approved on May 19, in a House&amp;ndash;Senate [[conference committee]]. The TCF Bank naming rights and land sale remained in the bill, as did a scaled down $25 per year student fee.  The tax on sports memorabilia as well as the Veterans Memorial Stadium name were voted out.  The committee also voted to increase the state contribution to the project to compensate for the smaller student fees.&lt;ref name=highlights&gt;{{cite news  | title = Stadium bill highlights  | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune  | date = May 20, 2006  | url = http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614164230/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/05/ |archivedate = June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The compromise bill was then approved by both the full house and senate on May 20, and was signed by Governor Tim Pawlenty on May 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = Unofficial Recorded Roll Call Floor Vote for S.F.

==Funding==
The stadium's cost totals $288.5&amp;nbsp;million of which the university will pay 52 percent and the state of Minnesota the remaining 48 percent.

The university is also accepting donations from individuals. Initially donations were only being sought from &quot;high-end&quot; donors (those contributing $100,000 or more), but in June 2008 the university expanded the fundraising effort to gather smaller donations as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | title = New Gophers stadium starts search for more cash  | publisher = KARE11.com  | date = June 3, 2008  | url = http://www.kare11.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=513105  | accessdate = 2008-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = How Can I Help?  | publisher = University of Minnesota via Internet Archive  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/help.php  | accessdate = 2009-06-19 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071213204852/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/help.php |archivedate = 2007-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Kaszuba | first = Mike | title = U's stadium dream runs into financial reality | publisher = Minneapolis Star Tribune via Internet Archive | date = July 11, 2007 | url = http://www.startribune.com/gophers/story/1295440.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-11 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070713223410/http://www.startribune.com/gophers/story/1295440.html |archivedate = 2007-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, 2009, the University announced they had received a $6 million donation from [[T.

The remainder of the university's portion will come from a $12.50 per semester student fee&lt;ref name=Robson /&gt; ($25 per year) and game day parking revenue.

Even though the cost of building TCF Bank Stadium originated at $248.7 million, changes in the [[construction]] planning raised the cost to $288.5 million.&lt;ref name=newcost&gt;{{cite web  | title = Regents approve stadium design, new price tag  | publisher = University of Minnesota  | date = January 3, 2007  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/Feature_Stories/Regents_approve_stadium_design.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university has vowed that even if the stadium cost rises again, it will not seek more money from the state nor increase the student fees any further.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyfee&quot; /&gt;

It is important to note that the University has been charging all U of M students a mandatory Stadium Fee of $12.50 every semester since planning for the project began, and is continuing this fee despite the stadium being finished. The cost for the stadium was $288.5 million of which the university only had to pay 52 percent, and with an general average of more than 50,000 students in a given year, in only one semester the university makes more than $625,000 from the stadium fee, meaning they receive more than $6.25 million every 5 years from students. While $12.50 may not seem like much, it means that the university has forced every student to fund the TCF Stadium, despite the fact that many students were vehemently opposed to its construction. {{fact|date=November 2011}}

===Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux donations===

The [[Shakopee-Mdewakanton Indian Reservation|Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community]] (SMSC) agreed to donate $10 million for stadium construction, the largest gift Gopher athletics has ever received. The university matched an additional $2.5 million to create a $5 million endowment for scholarships for Native American  and low-income students.

Infrastructure work at the stadium site began in late June 2006, and a [[Groundbreaking|ceremonial groundbreaking]] took place at the stadium site on September 30, 2006.  The beginning of construction on the stadium itself along with the unveiling of the stadium's [[logo]] took place on July 11, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium logo unveiled to signal start of Gopher football stadium construction  | publisher = University of Minnesota | url = http://www1.umn.edu/umnnews/news_details.php?release=070706_3399&amp;page=UMNN  | accessdate = 2007-07-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | title = TCF Bank Stadium Construction PHASE 3  | publisher = University of Minnesota via Internet Archive  | url = http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/phase3.html   | accessdate = 2006-12-21 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070118193153/http://www1.umn.edu/stadium/phase3.html |archivedate = 2007-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Site preparation and [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] work continued through the summer and fall of 2007.

==Expansion==

The [[T. Denny Sanford Hall of Fame]] was opened in Fall of 2010, located on the Southwest end of the stadium next to Goldy's Locker Room. This hall of fame is not football specific, rather encompassing all of the University of Minnesota's athletic programs. It housed Floyd the pig after the win against Iowa in the 2010 football season. 

==Alcohol controversy==
University of Minnesota President Robert Bruininks originally planned to have the school apply for a state liquor license in order to serve [[beer]] and [[wine]] in limited areas of the stadium. Under his proposal, alcohol would have been available only to occupants of premium [[season ticket]] seats ranging in price from $1,800 to $45,000 a year. This is/was consistent with the University's long-held alcohol policy at other on-campus athletic venues, such as Williams Arena and Mariucci Arena. This is also consistent with other NCAA institutions (including all other Big Ten Conference teams except for the University of Michigan) with on campus stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Post| first = Tim| title = U of M wants to sell beer at football games, if you can afford it| publisher = Minnesota Public Radio| date = 2008-11-13| url = http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2008/11/12/u_of_m_wants_to_sell_beer_at_football_games_if_you_can_afford_it/| accessdate =2008-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; No [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] stadiums serve alcohol in their general seating.&lt;ref name=Shenoy /&gt;

In May 2009, the Minnesota legislature passed a law that states that no alcohol may be served or sold anywhere in the stadium, including in suites and premium boxes, unless all ticketholders 21 or older in the stadium can buy alcohol at a game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revisor.leg.state.mn.us/laws/?id=120&amp;doctype=chapter&amp;year=2009&amp;type=0  Minnesota Laws, 2009, Chapter 120, section 8]&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Minnesota regents voted on June 24, 2009, on Bruininks' subsequent proposal to ban alcohol entirely at campus athletic events (and also ban it in Mariucci and Williams arenas), which passed 10â2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ebert, Alex|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/49012236.html|title=No booze for U sports fans
|date=June 25, 2009|publisher=Avista Capital Partners|work=Star Tribune|accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, the legislature passed a law saying that alcohol could be served in premium seating if it was also available in one-third of the general seats. Bruininks declined to ask the board of regents to make this compromise. Dan Wolter, a spokesman for the university, said, &quot;We recognize and understand that underage drinking is a big problem in our society as a whole so that is a stand that the University wanted to take.&quot;&lt;ref name=Shenoy&gt;{{cite news|author=Shenoy, Rupa|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2010/06/07/no-alcohol-in-stadium/|date=June 7, 2010|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|title=U of M decides not to sell alcohol in TCF Bank football stadium|accessdate=June 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
[[Image:IMAG0252.jpg|thumb|South Wing of the Stadium featuring Goldy's Lockerroom]]
While TCF Bank Stadium is the game day venue of the Golden Gophers football team, the stadium will also provide the University with several other uses.  The stadium replaced [[Northrop Auditorium]] as the home of the [[University of Minnesota Marching Band]], providing the band with new storage, rehearsal, and locker facilities.  The university also expects to use the stadium for [[intramural sports]], career fairs, and graduation ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Hopp  | first = Deborah  | title = The U's new stadium is about more than football  | publisher = St. Paul Pioneer Press  | date = February 28, 2006  | url = http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/02/  | accessdate = 2007-07-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070614164236/http://blog.lib.umn.edu/stadium/stadium/2006/02/ |archivedate = June 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; University officials have also suggested that the stadium could be used to host outdoor hockey games, such as the annual [[NHL Winter Classic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Katzenstein  | first = Josh  | title = The U's new stadium is about more than football  | publisher = Minnesota Daily  | date = March 10, 2009  | url = http://www.mndaily.com/2009/03/10/tcf-bank-stadium-will-see-widespread-use  | accessdate = 2009-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
