'''WWTV''' is the [[CBS]]-affiliated [[television station]] for the northern [[Lower Peninsula of Michigan|Lower]] and eastern [[Upper Peninsula of Michigan|Upper]] Peninsulas of [[Michigan]]. Licensed to [[Cadillac, Michigan|Cadillac]], it broadcasts a [[High-definition television|high definition]] digital signal on [[VHF]] channel 9 from a transmitter at its studios on 130th Avenue, northeast of [[Tustin, Michigan|Tustin]], in [[Osceola County, Michigan|Osceola County]]. At 1,631 feet (497 m) high, the station's transmitter tower is the tallest in the state. When atmospheric conditions are right, WWTV's signal can be picked up as far south as [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] and the northern suburbs of [[Detroit]] (when [[CBET]] in [[Windsor, Ontario]] is off the air), and as far southwest as the communities on [[Wisconsin]]'s eastern shore of [[Lake Michigan]]. 

Like other network affiliates serving this vast and rural area, the station operates a full-time [[repeater]] station, '''WWUP-TV''' channel 10. Licensed to [[Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan|Sault Ste. Marie]], this station's transmitter is approximately 30 miles SSE of Sault Ste. Marie near [[Goetzville]] in [[Chippewa County, Michigan|Chippewa County]].

==Overview==
Together the two stations, which are known on-air as '''''9&amp;10 News''''', serve 23 counties in the northern Lower and three counties in the eastern Upper Peninsula. In addition, WWUP's signal can be received by viewers in [[Northern Ontario]] including Sault Ste. Marie's [[Canadian]] [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|sister city]]. The stations are owned by Heritage Broadcasting Group, which operates [[Fox Network|FOX]] affiliate [[WFQX-TV]] and its full-time satellite, WFUP, through a [[shared services]] agreement (SSA). That station is owned by Cadillac Telecasting. WWTV airs [[Television syndication|syndicated]] programming such as ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' and ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]''. The stations broadcast 24 hours a day, seven days a week. 

At one point, WWTV (not WWUP) was seen on cable in the [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Canadian Sault]]. However, local cable provider [[Shaw Communications]] switched its CBS feed to [[WWJ-TV]] from [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]]. For many years, WWTV was the only in-[[media market|market]] station on cable from the [[United States|American]] side of the locks as other [[United States|American]] stations were fed from [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]] and Detroit. WWTV is also available on [[cable television]] in much of Michigan north of [[Lansing, Michigan|Lansing]] as well as [[Charter Communications|Charter]] cable systems in [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]]. [[Persona Communications|Persona]] systems (now [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]]) in [[Greater Sudbury|Sudbury]], [[Ontario]] carried the station until around 2009 when it was replaced by [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]'s [[WIVB-TV]]. WWTV was also originally seen on the [[Cablevision (Canada)|Cablevision]] systems in [[Rouyn-Noranda]] and [[Val-d'Or]], [[Quebec]] until the early-2000s when it was replaced with [[WBZ-TV]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts]].

==History==
WWTV began broadcasting on [[New Year's Day]] in 1954. The station was on channel 13 and was owned by [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]] radio manufacturer Sparton Corporation. It was Michigan's first television station north of Lansing, predating Traverse City's [[WPBN-TV]] by several months. WWTV has been a CBS affiliate from its first day, but initially carried secondary affiliations with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] (the latter shut down in 1956). When WPBN signed on, WWTV shared ABC programming with that station until 1971, when [[WGTU]] signed on and became the area's ABC affiliate. WWTV aired some of ABC's soap operas and game shows while WPBN aired ABC's sports programming on the weekends. 

In 1958, broadcast pioneer [[John Fetzer]] purchased WWTV. Fetzer also owned the [[Detroit Tigers]] and the purchase brought Tigers games to Northern Michigan for the first time. In 1961, a fire at the station's transmitter spread to the studio and destroyed the building. The building was quickly rebuilt, complete with new equipment. In 1962, WWTV swapped channel locations with [[WZZM]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan|Grand Rapids]] and moved to its current location on channel 9. The move to channel 9 allowed WWTV to boost its broadcasting power to cover the entire northern half of the Lower Peninsula. On June 15 of that year, Fetzer signed on WWUP in Sault Ste. Marie as a full-time satellite of WWTV. The stations were known collectively as &quot;TV 9&amp;10&quot; from 1962 to the late-1990s when the stations dropped &quot;TV&quot; from their name and began referring to themselves as &quot;9&amp;10 News&quot;. Many viewers, however, continue to refer to the station as &quot;TV 9&amp;10&quot;.

In 1967, TV 9&amp;10 broadcast in color for the first time (as CBS was the last network to convert to color broadcasting). In 1978, Fetzer sold TV 9&amp;10 to [[Buffalo Bills]] owner [[Ralph C. Wilson, Jr.|Ralph Wilson]].  In 1988, the stations were sold to Heritage Broadcast Group, headed by [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroiter]] Mario Iacobelli. 9&amp;10 News has long been one of the most technologically advanced small-market television stations in the country. Legend has it that when the station broadcasted in color for the first time, CBS was jealous because 9&amp;10's color picture was of higher quality than the rest of the network. Under Iacobelli's ownership, the station has frequently made commercials that many claim to have the look and feel of Detroit-based stations. 

On May 10, 2007, it was announced that the area's [[Fox Network]] affiliate, [[WFQX-TV]], was being sold by current owner [[Rockfleet Broadcasting]] to Cadillac Telecasting. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) gave regulatory approval in late-October. After the closing of the sale, Cadillac Telecasting entered into a shared services agreement (SSA) with 9&amp;10 News.

On June 12, 2009, WWTV and WWUP closed down their analog signals and moved their digital signals to the previous analog channels.

On September 29, 2010, the FCC granted WWTV a construction permit for a digital fill-in translator on their pre-transition channel 40.&lt;ref&gt;http://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/prefill_and_display.pl?Application_id=1326268&amp;Service=LD&amp;Form_id=346&amp;Facility_id=26994&lt;/ref&gt; This translator will primarily serve the Traverse City area. This repeater began operation on December 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Per [http://www.9and10news.com/ www.9and10news.com/].&lt;/ref&gt;

==News operation==
[[Image:Wwtv news.png|thumb|left|The station's nightly 6 o'clock news open.]]

9&amp;10 News has long been the highest-rated television station in the market, especially in news. However, longtime runner-up [[NBC]] affiliate [[WPBN-TV]] (TV 7&amp;4) has closed the gap in recent years. 9&amp;10 News has always made a large investment into its news department resulting in a higher-quality product than conventional wisdom would suggest for a station based in the 116th market. All told, 9&amp;10 News airs 30 hours of news every week, a very large amount for a small-market station. 

One of the station's best-known faces belongs to John McGowan, who joined the station's on-air roster in 1977. He has served as Sports Director and currently anchors the station's weekend newscasts. McGowan also reports for ''Sports Overtime''. Other 9&amp;10 News alumni include [[WTVG]] weatherman Bill Spencer, ''[[Jeopardy!]]'' &quot;Clue Crew&quot; member Sarah Whitcomb, [[WOOD-TV]] reporters Larry Figurski and Dee Morrison, and former [[KPSP-LP|KPSP]] anchor Trish O'Shea. 

9&amp;10 News courted controversy when it polled viewers asking if they wanted the station to air a CBS special about the career of ''[[CBS Evening News]]'' anchor [[Dan Rather]], who was stepping down from his broadcast. After much attention from both local and national press, the poll was dropped and the special was aired. 

On October 31, 2007, 9&amp;10 News began producing a weeknight 10 o'clock newscast on new sister station WFQX. On January 7, 2008, CBS began requiring affiliates to carry ''[[The Early Show]]'' in its entirety. The third hour of ''Michigan This Morning'', which had been running from 7 to 8 in the morning, was moved to WFQX and expanded to two hours. That evening on WFQX, 9&amp;10 News launched the market's first 7 o'clock newscast. 

In addition to its main studios, 9&amp;10 News operates two news bureaus in Traverse City (located on Aero Park Drive, near [[Cherry Capital Airport]]) and [[Petoskey, Michigan|Petoskey]]. During its weather forecasts, 9&amp;10 News uses live, [[NOAA]] [[National Weather Service]] radar data from several regional sites. This data is presented on-screen as the &quot;Doppler 9&amp;10 Radar Network&quot;. The main signal comes from the radar located at the NWS Local Forecast Office in [[Gaylord, Michigan|Gaylord]]. Mondays through Thursdays after the [[11 o'clock news]], the station airs ''Sports Extra'', an extended sportscast. During [[high school]] sports season, Friday night 11 o'clock newscasts devote over 20 minutes to ''Sports Overtime''. Known as &quot;the original big show&quot;, it regularly features highlights from more than a dozen area high school sporting events and has won numerous awards for the station. 9&amp;10's website features video content from news and sports. It also offers the first and only wireless news website of the Northern Michigan television market.
