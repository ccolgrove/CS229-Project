<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="30108760" ns="0" title="Dulwich Hill Interchange MLR station"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Dulwich Hill Interchange MLR station''' is a planned light rail stop located in the southern part of the suburb of [[Dulwich Hill, New South Wales|Dulwich Hill]] on the [[Metro Light Rail]] line in [[Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]]. The stop is planned for completion in 2012. The extension will operate from the current light rail terminus at [[Lilyfield MLR station|Lilyfield]] making use of the former Rozelle branch of the [[Metropolitan Goods railway line]] heavy rail freight corridor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/rail/lightrail-extension.html Sydney Light Rail Extensions - Transport NSW]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transport.nsw.gov.au/sites/default/file/rail/SLRE-Community-Update-July-August-2010.pdf Community Update - Light Rail Extension - Inner West, Lilyfield to Dulwich Hill, July/August 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Dulwich Hill Interchange is located at the end of the closed section of the goods line and is thus the terminus of the light rail extension. The name is intended to highlight the connection with [[Dulwich Hill railway station]] which will be a short walk from the light rail stop.

The new service will provide a direct service to the city though the Bankstown line will be quicker. The main utility of the interchange will be providing improved access to Lewisham (including Lewisham railway station on the Inner West railway line), Summer Hill, Leichhardt, Haberfield, Lilyfield, Annandale, Glebe, Pyrmont and Darling Harbour.

==Design==
In the project's Environmental Assessment the stop was proposed to be located adjacent to the railway station with direct access from Wardell Road. This was to have been achieved by widening the cutting used by the railway lines and removing angle parking on Bedford Crescent. It was proposed to construct an island platform with two tracks.

A subsequent review favoured an alternative scheme which moves the stop to the end of Bedford Crescent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorprojects.planning.nsw.gov.au/files/67448/2%20Submissions%20Report%20-%20Appendix%20A%20(Part%201).pdf Submissions Report Appendix A (Part 1)] p 71. Transport NSW.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorprojects.planning.nsw.gov.au/files/67447/1%20Submissions%20Report%20-%20Main%20Report.pdf Submissions Report - Main Report] Figure 6.1 p 67. Transport NSW&lt;/ref&gt; This scheme includes a single side platform and is further away from the railway station, but includes a connection to Jack Shanahan Park on the western side of the light rail alignment. This improves access to the park from the east and access to the stop from the west. Other improvements cited are reduced construction cost and environmental impact due to the elimination of the extensive work required to widen the cutting under the original proposal, and the reduced need to interface with RailCorp assets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorprojects.planning.nsw.gov.au/files/67448/2%20Submissions%20Report%20-%20Appendix%20A%20(Part%201).pdf Submissions Report Appendix A (Part 1)] p 59. Transport NSW.&lt;/ref&gt;

The stop is estimated to be used by 540 boarding passengers per weekday by 2016 with 300 of those arriving by train and 30 arriving by bus. This is the highest patronage of any stop on the extension.&lt;ref&gt;[http://majorprojects.planning.nsw.gov.au/files/61649/08_Environmental%20Assessment%20-%20Volume%201%20-%20Part%20C1%20-%20Chapter%2010.pdf Environmental Assessment - Volume 1 - Part C1 - Chapter 10.] Table 10.1 p 201.
