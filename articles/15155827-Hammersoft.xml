The '''2008 [[San Diego Chargers]] season''' was the franchise's 49th overall season and their 39th in the NFL. While they completed the regular season with only an 8â8 record, they nonetheless captured their third consecutive [[AFC West]] championship.  In the first round of the playoffs, the Chargers upset the [[Indianapolis Colts]], but they were eliminated the following week during their divisional round game on the road against the eventual Super Bowl champion [[Pittsburgh Steelers]].

The Chargers became the first team to go 8â8 and win their division since [[1985 Cleveland Browns season|1985]], and by winning their Wild Card playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts, became the first team in NFL history to actually go an entire season without having a winning record until'' after'' the first round of the playoffs.  They also became the first team in NFL history to start the season 4â8, yet make the playoffs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/606/A45337052&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoping to rebound from their last-second home loss to the Panthers, the Chargers flew to [[Invesco Field at Mile High]] for a Week 2 AFC West duel with the [[Denver Broncos]].  In the first quarter, San Diego trailed early as FB [[Michael Pittman]] getting a 1-yard TD run, after a [[Philip Rivers]] pass to [[Chris Chambers]] was ruled an interception on the field. The Chargers challenged the ruling, but the replay system was inoperative to the officials, so the ruling on the field stood.  The 'Bolts would respond with kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] getting a 34-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Denver increased its lead with QB [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]] completing a 3-yard and a 14-yard TD pass to TE [[Tony Scheffler]].

The Chargers would strike at Denver's lead as QB [[Philip Rivers]] completing a 48-yard TD pass to WR [[Chris Chambers]], yet the Broncos would end the half with Cutler completing a 6-yard TD pass to WR [[Brandon Marshall]].

In the third quarter, the 'Bolts began to rally as Rivers completed a 15-yard TD pass to Chambers, along with Kaeding nailing a 21-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, San Diego took the lead with Kaeding's 28-yard field goal and Rivers' 66-yard TD pass to Sproles.  However, Denver responded with a 12-play, 80-yard drive (which included a second controversial officiating call that turned a game-winning fumble into an incomplete pass) that conclude with Cutler completing a 4-yard TD pass to WR [[Eddie Royal]], including Cutler's 2-point conversion pass to Royal. 

Notable: The game has been titled by press and websites as &quot;The Mile High Highjacking&quot; after the officiating call that cost San Diego the game.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

With yet-another last-moment loss, the Chargers fell to 0â2.
