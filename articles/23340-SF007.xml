'''''Paganism''''' (from [[Latin]] ''[[Wikt:paganus|paganus]]'', meaning &quot;country dweller&quot;, &quot;rustic&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/pagan.html&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[blanket term]], typically used to refer to non-Abrahamic, indigenous [[polytheistic]] religious traditions. 
[[Image:Isis Musei Capitolini MC744.jpg|right|thumb|[[Isis]] holding a sistrum and an oinochoe. (Roman artwork from the [[Hadrian]] period (117â138 CE).)]]
It is primarily used in a historical context, referring to [[Greco-Roman polytheism]] as well as the polytheistic traditions of [[Europe]] and [[North Africa]] before [[Christianization]]. In a wider sense, extended to contemporary religions, it includes most of the [[Eastern religions]] and the [[ethnic religion|indigenous traditions]] of the [[Native American mythology|Americas]], [[Shamanism|Central Asia]], [[Australia]] and [[African traditional religions|Africa]]; as well as non-Abrahamic [[folk religion]] in general. 
More narrow definitions will not include any of the [[world religion]]s and restrict the term to local or rural currents not organized as [[civil religion]]s. Characteristic of Pagan traditions is the absence of [[proselytism]] and the presence of a living mythology, which [[myth and ritual|explains religious practice]].

In the [[Christian]] perspective the term has been used historically to encompass all nonâ[[Abrahamic religions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CatholicEnc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Paganism |date=21 November 2009 |accessdate=17 August 2010 |quote=Paganism, in the broadest sense includes all religions other than the true one revealed by God, and, in a narrower sense, all except Christianity, Judaism, and Mohammedanism. The term is also used as the equivalent of Polytheism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.religioustolerance.org/paganism.htm â Robinson, B.A (2000). &quot;What do &quot;Paganism&quot; &amp; &quot;Pagan&quot; mean?&quot; at religioustolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''pagan'' is a Christian adaptation of the &quot;[[gentile]]&quot; of Judaism, and as such has an inherent Abrahamic bias, and [[pejorative]] connotations among [[monotheists]],&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Pagan&quot;, Encyclopedia Britannica 11th Edition, 1911, retrieved 22 May 2007.[http://encyclopedia.jrank.org/ORC_PAI/PAGAN_Lat_paganus_of_or_belongi.html]&lt;/ref&gt; comparable to heathen and [[infidel]] also known as [[kafir]] (ÙØ§ÙØ±) and [[mushrik]] in Islam. [[Peter Brown (historian)|Peter Brown]] observes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The adoption of ''paganus'' by Latin Christians as an all-embracing, pejorative term for polytheists represents an unforeseen and singularly long-lasting victory, within a religious group, of a word of Latin slang originally devoid of religious meaning. The evolution occurred only in the Latin west, and in connection with the Latin church. Elsewhere, &quot;[[ Hellenes (religion)|Hellene ]]&quot; or &quot;gentile&quot; (''[[Wikt:ethnicon|ethnikos]]'') remained the word for &quot;pagan&quot;; and ''paganos'' continued as a purely secular term, with overtones of the inferior and the commonplace.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Brown, in Glen Warren Bowersock, Peter Robert Lamont Brown, Oleg Grabar, eds., ''Late Antiquity: a guide to the postclassical world'', 1999, ''s.v.'' &quot;Pagan&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

For these reasons, [[ethnologists]] avoid the term &quot;paganism,&quot; with its uncertain and varied meanings, in referring to traditional or historic faiths, preferring more precise categories such as [[polytheism]], [[shamanism]], [[pantheism]], or [[animism]]. 

In the late 20th century, &quot;Paganism&quot;, ''or  &quot;[[Neopaganism]]&quot;,'' became widely used in reference to adherents of various [[New Religious Movements]] including [[Wicca]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/classic/A1032166 &quot;A Basic Introduction to Paganism&quot;], BBC, retrieved 19 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; As such, various modern scholars have begun to apply the term to three groups of separate faiths: [[Polytheism#Historical_polytheism|Historical Polytheism]] (such as [[Celtic polytheism]], [[Norse Paganism]], and [[Hellenic Polytheistic Reconstructionism]] also called Hellenismos), [[folk religion|Folk]]/[[Ethnic religion|ethnic]]/Indigenous religions (such as [[Chinese folk religion]] and [[African traditional religion]]), and [[Neopaganism]] (such as [[Wicca]] and [[Germanic Neopaganism]]).

===Pagan===
The term ''pagan'' is from the Latin ''paganus'', an adjective originally meaning &quot;[[rural]]&quot;, &quot;rustic&quot; or &quot;of the country.&quot;  As a noun, ''paganus'' was used to mean &quot;country dweller, villager.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_/pagan.html Word History&lt;/ref&gt; 
The semantic development of post-classical Latin ''paganus'' in the sense &quot;non-Christian, heathen&quot; is unclear. The dating of this sense is controversial, but the 4th century seems most plausible. An earlier example has been suggested in [[Tertullian]] &lt;u&gt;De Corona Militis xi&lt;/u&gt;, ''&quot;Apud hunc [sc. Christum] tam miles est paganus fidelis quam paganus est miles infidelis,&quot;'' but here the word ''paganus'' may be interpreted in the sense &quot;[[civilian]]&quot; rather than &quot;heathen&quot;. There are three main explanations of the development:

* (i) The older sense of classical Latin ''pÄgÄnus'' is &quot;of the country, rustic&quot; (also as noun). It has been argued that the transferred use reflects the fact that the ancient [[idolatry]] lingered on in the rural villages and hamlets after [[Christianity]] had been accepted in the towns and cities of the [[Roman Empire]];&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Alan W. &quot;Nature, Man and Woman&quot;, 1991, Vintage Books, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; cf. Orosius &lt;u&gt;Histories 1. Prol.&lt;/u&gt; ''&quot;Ex locorum agrestium compitis et pagis pagani vocantur.&quot;''  From its earliest beginnings, [[Christianity]] spread much more quickly in major urban areas (like [[Antioch]], [[Alexandria]], [[Carthage]], [[Roman Corinth|Corinth]], [[Rome]]) than in the countryside (in fact, the early church was almost entirely urban {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}), and soon the word for &quot;country dweller&quot; became synonymous with someone who was &quot;not a [[Christian]],&quot; giving rise to the modern meaning of &quot;pagan.&quot;  This may, in part, have had to do with the closeness to nature of rural people, who may have been more resistant to the new ideas of Christianity than those who lived in major urban centers and were cut off from the cycles of nature and the forms of spirituality associated with them. However, it may have also resulted from early Christian missionaries focusing their efforts within major population centers (e.g., [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]]), rather than throughout an expansive, yet sparsely populated, countryside (hence, the Latin term suggesting &quot;uneducated country folk&quot;) until a bit later on.
* (ii) The more common meaning of classical Latin ''pÄgÄnus'' is &quot;civilian, non-militant&quot; (adjective and noun). Christians called themselves ''mÄ«litÄs'', &quot;enrolled soldiers&quot; of [[Christ]], members of his [[Church militant and church triumphant|militant church]], and applied to non-Christians the term applied by [[soldier]]s to all who were &quot;not enrolled in the army&quot;. {{Clarify|date=January 2010}}
* (iii) The sense &quot;heathen&quot; arose from an interpretation of ''paganus'' as denoting a person who was outside a particular group or [[community]], hence &quot;not of the city&quot; or &quot;rural&quot;; cf. Orosius &lt;u&gt;Histories 1. Prol.&lt;/u&gt; ''&quot;ui alieni a civitate dei..pagani vocantur.&quot;'' See C. Mohrmann, &lt;u&gt;Vigiliae Christianae&lt;/u&gt; 6 (1952) 9ff.
:â[http://dictionary.oed.com Oxford English Dictionary, (online) 2nd Edition (1989)]

The post-classical Latin ''paganismus'' gave rise to both ''paganism'' and to its synonym ''paynimry''.&lt;ref&gt;OED etymology for paynim: &lt; Anglo-Norman paenisme, painisme, paienime, painnim, peinibvgnb, bjkbyh ikbh 
where is the pegacorn me, paenime, etc., and Old French paienime, paienisme heathen lands (c1150â74), heathen religion (1160) &lt; post-classical Latin paganismus (see PAGANISM n.), probably influenced by Old French paien (see PAYEN n.).&lt;/ref&gt; Paynimry may be used of paganism, its practises, and pagans,&lt;ref&gt;OED entry for 'paynimry'.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as for the domain or realm of pagans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/paynimry&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;[[Peasant]]&quot; is a [[cognate]], via [[Old French]] ''paisent''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3atext%3a1999%2e04%2e0062&amp;query=id%3dpagus#id,pagus Harry Thurston Peck, ''Harper's Dictionary of Classical Antiquity'', 1897; &quot;pagus&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In their origins, these usages derived from ''pagus'', &quot;province, countryside&quot;, cognate to  Greek ÏÎ¬Î³Î¿Ï &quot;rocky hill&quot;, and, even earlier,  &quot;something stuck in the ground&quot;, as a landmark: the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] root ''*pag-'' means &quot;fixed&quot; and is also the source of the words ''page'', ''[[The Pale|pale]]'' (stake), and ''pole'', as well as ''pact'' and ''peace''.

While ''pagan'' is attested in English from the 14th century, there is no evidence that the term ''paganism'' was in use in English before the 17th century. The [[Oxford English Dictionary|''OED'']] instances [[Edward Gibbon]]'s [[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire|''Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire'']] (1776): &quot;The divisions of Christianity suspended the ruin of Paganism.&quot; The term was not a [[neologism]], however, as ''paganismus'' was already used by [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]].&lt;ref&gt;Divers. Quaest. 83. Augustine makes clear that, in his time,  ''paganus'' was the term in [[Vulgar Latin]] synonymous to educated ''gentilis'' &quot;[[gentile]]&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than twenty years after the last vestiges of Paganism were crushed with great severity by the emperor [[Theodosius I]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14577d.htm &quot;Theodosius I&quot;, The Catholic Encyclopedia, 1912]&lt;/ref&gt; Rome was seized by [[Alaric]] in 410. This led to murmuring that the  gods of Paganism had taken greater care of the city than that of  the Christian God, inspiring [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] to write ''[[City of God (book)|The City of God]]'', alternative title &quot;''De Civitate Dei contra Paganos'': The City of God against the Pagans&quot;, in which he claimed that whilst the great 'city of Man' had fallen, Christians were ultimately citizens of the 'city of God.'&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The City of God&quot;, [[Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]], 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Heathen===
''Heathen'' is from [[Old English language|Old English]] ''hÃ¦Ã°en'' &quot;not Christian or Jewish&quot; (c.f. [[Old Norse]] ''heiÃ°inn''). Historically, the term was probably influenced by [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''haiÃ¾i'' &quot;dwelling on the [[Heath (habitat)|heath]]&quot;, appearing as ''haiÃ¾no'' in [[Ulfilas]]' bible as &quot;gentile woman&quot; (translating  the [[names of the Greeks#Hellene comes to mean &quot;pagan&quot;|&quot;Hellene&quot;]] in {{bibleverse||Mark|7:26|KJV}}). This translation was probably influenced by Latin ''paganus'', &quot;country dweller&quot;, or it was chosen because of its similarity to the Greek á¼Î¸Î½Î¹ÎºÏÏ [[ethnic|''ethnikos'']], &quot;[[gentile]]&quot;. It has even been suggested that Gothic ''haiÃ¾i'' is not related to &quot;heath&quot; at all, but rather a loan from [[Armenian language|Armenian]] ''hethanos'', itself loaned from Greek á¼Î¸Î½Î¿Ï ''ethnos''.
==Terminology==
{{See|Idolatry|Polytheism|Ethnic religion}}
Both &quot;pagan&quot; and &quot;heathen&quot; have historically been used as a [[pejorative]] by adherents of [[monotheism|monotheistic]] religions (such as [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]]) to indicate a disbeliever in their religion; although in modern times it is not always used as a pejorative. &quot;Paganism&quot; frequently refers to the religions of [[classical antiquity]], most notably [[Greek mythology]] or [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]]; and can be used neutrally or admiringly by those who refer to those complexes of belief. However, until the rise of [[Romanticism]] and the general acceptance of [[freedom of religion]] in [[western world|Western civilization]], &quot;paganism&quot; was almost always used disparagingly of [[heterodox]] beliefs falling outside the established political framework of the Christian Church.
[[File:Hypatia_Raphael_Sanzio_detail.jpg|right|thumb|[[Hypatia]] of Alexandria, philosopher, mathematician and astronomer, murdered by Christian monks in March 415 CE.]]
&quot;Pagan&quot; came to be equated with a Christianized sense of &quot;[[epicurean]]&quot; to signify a person who is sensual, materialistic, self-indulgent, unconcerned with the future and uninterested in sophisticated religion.  The word was usually used in this worldly and [[stereotype|stereotypical]] sense, particularly among those who were drawing attention to what they perceived as being the limitations of Paganism.  Thus [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote: &quot;The Pagan set out, with admirable sense, to enjoy himself. By the end of his civilization he had discovered that a man cannot enjoy himself and continue to enjoy anything else.&quot; In sharp contrast, [[Swinburne]] the poet would comment on this same theme: &quot;Thou hast conquered, O pale Galilean; the world has grown grey from thy breath; We have drunken of things Lethean, and fed on the fullness of death.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;'Hymn to Proserpine'&lt;/ref&gt;  

Christianity itself has been perceived at times as a form of [[polytheism]] by followers of the other Abrahamic religions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=489&amp;letter=C&amp;search=polytheism%20christianity Jewish Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Shirk (polytheism)|Shirk]]&lt;/ref&gt; because of the Christian doctrine of the [[Trinity]] (which at first glance appears indistinguishable from [[Tritheism]],&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, John (1912).

Retrieved 17 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; though this is variously condemned as [[heresy]] or [[apostasy]] by the main Christian denominations) or the celebration of Pagan feast days&lt;ref&gt;[[Christianised calendar]]&lt;/ref&gt; and other practices â through a process described as &quot;baptizing&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://asharqalawsat.com/english/news.asp?section=2&amp;id=6465 The Pope, The Emperor and the Persian Leader]&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;[[christianization]]&quot;. Even between Christians there have been similar charges of idolatry levelled, especially by Protestants,&lt;ref&gt;'[[Philip Melanchthon]] 'Apologia Confessionis Augustanae'&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Seznec]] 'The Survival of the Pagan Gods'&lt;/ref&gt; towards the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Churches for their [[veneration]] of the saints and images.

===Classical Antiquity===
{{main|Religion in ancient Greece|Ancient Roman religion|Hellenistic religion|Roman imperial cult|Mystery religion}}
[[Ludwig Feuerbach]] (1833) defines &quot;Paganism&quot; (''Heidentum'') in the context of [[classical antiquity]]
as &quot;the unity of religion and politics, of spirit and nature, of god and man&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;c.f. the civil, natural and mythical theologies of [[Marcus Terentius Varro]]&lt;/ref&gt; qualified by the observation that &quot;man&quot; in the Pagan view is always defined by [[ethnicity]], i.e. Greek, Roman, Egyptian, Jew, etc., so that each Pagan tradition is also a national tradition. 
Feuerbach goes on to postulate that the emergence of [[monotheism]] and thus the end of the Pagan period was a development which naturally grew out of [[Hellenistic philosophy]] due to the contradiction inherent in the ethnic nature of Pagan tradition and the universality of human spirituality (''[[Geist]]''), finally resulting in the emergence of a religion with a universalist scope in the form of  [[early Christianity|Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Feuerbach, ''Geschichte der neueren Philosophie'' (1833), Introduction, Â§1 (Paganism, Philosophy, Religion, Christianity)
''Das Wesen des Heidentums war die Einheit von Religion und Politik, Geist und Natur, Gott und Mensch. Aber der Mensch im Heidentum war nicht der Mensch schlechtweg, sondern der nationell bestimmte Mensch: der Grieche, der RÃ¶mer, der Ãgyptier, der Jude, folglich auch sein Gott ein nationell bestimmtes, besonderes, dem Wesen oder Gotte anderer VÃ¶lker entgegengesetztes Wesen â ein Wesen also im Widerspruch mit dem Geiste, welcher das Wesen der Menschheit und als ihr Wesen die allgemeine Einheit aller VÃ¶lker und Menschen ist. Die Aufhebung dieses Widerspruchs im Heidentum war die heidnische Philosophie; denn sie riÃ den Menschen heraus aus seiner nationellen Abgeschlossenheit und SelbstgenÃ¼gsamkeit, erhob ihn Ã¼ber die Borniertheit des VolksdÃ¼nkels und Volksglaubens, versetzte ihn auf den kosmopolitischen Standpunkt.''
&lt;/ref&gt;

====Late Antiquity====
{{see|Origins of Christianity|Decline of Hellenistic paganism|Magic in the Greco-Roman world|Hellenic philosophy and Christianity}}
The developments of [[Late Antiquity]] in the religious thought in the far-flung [[Roman Empire]] needs to be addressed separately, as this is the context in which [[Early Christianity]] itself developed as one of several monotheistic cults, and it was in this period that the concept of &quot;pagan&quot; developed in the first place. 
Christianity as it emerged out of [[Second Temple Judaism]] (or [[Hellenistic Judaism]]) stood in competition with other  religions advocating &quot;pagan monotheism&quot;, including [[Neoplatonism]], [[Mithraism]], [[Gnosticism]], [[Manichaeanism]], and the cult of [[Dionysus]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus'' 
&quot;two monotheistic religions, Dionysian and Christian, existed contemporaneously in Nea Paphos during the 4th century C.E. [...]  the particular iconography of Hermes and Dionysos in the panel of the Epiphany of Dionysos [...] represents the culmination of a Pagan iconographic tradition in which an infant divinity is seated on the lap of another divine figure; this Pagan motif was appropriated by early Christian artists and developed into the standardized icon of the Virgin and Child. Thus the mosaic helps to substantiate the existence of Pagan monotheism.&quot;   [http://www.bsw.org/?l=71851&amp;a=Comm06.html Biblical Studies on the Web]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dionysus]] in particular exhibits significant parallels with Christ, so that numerous scholars have concluded that the recasting of [[historical Jesus|Jesus the wandering rabbi]] into the image of [[Christ the Logos]], the divine saviour, reflects the cult of Dionysus directly. They point to the symbolism of wine and the importance it held in the mythology surrounding both Dionysus and Jesus Christ;&lt;ref&gt;[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], ''Description of Greece'' 6. 26. 1 - 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Athenaeus]], ''Deipnosophistae'' 2. 34a&lt;/ref&gt;  Wick argues that the use of [[wine]] [[religious symbolism|symbolism]] in the [[Gospel of John]], including the story of the [[Marriage at Cana]] at which Jesus turns water into wine, was intended to show Jesus as superior to Dionysus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wick 2004 179â198&quot;/&gt;  The scene in ''The Bacchae'' wherein Dionysus appears before King Pentheus on charges of claiming divinity is compared to the New Testament scene of Jesus being interrogated by [[Pontius Pilate]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wick 2004 179â198&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wick |first=Peter |title=Jesus gegen Dionysos?

With new translations of ancient texts by Herbert M. Howe. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey: Prentice-Hall, Inc., 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, it is difficult if not impossible to draw a clear line between &quot;Christianity&quot; and &quot;Paganism&quot; for the period of the 3rd to 4th centuries when Christianity was in its formative phase. Only with the emergence of [[Orthodox Christianity]] as reflected in the [[Apostle's Creed]] and the final [[decline of Hellenistic paganism]] by the 6th century does &quot;Paganism&quot; become a concept clearly distinct from Christianity.

==Pagan survivals in folklore==
{{See|Folklore}}
In addition, [[folklore]] that is not any longer perceived as holding any religious significance can in some instances be traced to pre-Christian or pre-[[Islam]]ic origins. In Europe, this is particularly the case with the various customs of [[Carnival]] or [[Fasnacht]] and the [[Yule]] traditions surrounding [[Santa Claus]]/[[Sinterklaas]]. By contrast, the [[Christmas tree]] in spite of frequent association with [[Thor's Oak]] cannot be shown to be an innovation predating the Early Modern period.

==Early Modern period==
Interest in pagan traditions was revived in the [[Renaissance]], at first in [[Renaissance magic]] as a revival of [[Greco-Roman magic]]. In the 17th century, description of paganism turned from the theological aspect to the [[ethnology|ethnological]], and a religion began to be understood as part of the [[ethnic]] identity of a people, and the study of the religions of &quot;primitive&quot; peoples triggered questions as to the ultimate historical [[origin of religion]]. Thus, [[Nicolas Fabri de Peiresc]] saw the pagan [[religions of Africa]] of his day as relicts that were in principle capable of shedding light on the historical Paganism of Classical Antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;It would be a great pleasure to make the comparison with what survives to us of ancient Paganism in our old books, in order to have better [grasped] their spirit.&quot; Peter N. Miller, ''History of Religion Becomes Ethnology: Some Evidence from Peiresc's Africa'' Journal of the History of Ideas 67.4 (2006) 675â696.[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/journal_of_the_history_of_ideas/v067/67.4miller.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Romanticism==

Paganism re-surfaces as a topic of fascination in 18th to 19th century [[Romanticism]], in particular in the context of the literary [[Celtic Revival|Celtic]] and [[Viking Revival|Viking]] revivals, which portrayed historical [[Celtic polytheism|Celtic]] and [[Germanic polytheism|Germanic]] polytheists as [[noble savage]]s.

The 19th century also saw much scholarly interest in the reconstruction of pagan mythology from folklore or fairy tales. This was notably attempted by the [[Brothers Grimm]], especially [[Jacob Grimm]] in his ''[[Teutonic Mythology]]'', and [[Elias LÃ¶nnrot]] with the compilation of the ''[[Kalevala]]''. The work of the Brothers Grimm influenced other collectors, both inspiring them to collect tales and leading them to similarly believe that the fairy tales of a country were particularly representative of it, to the neglect of cross-cultural influence.  Among those influenced were the Russian [[Alexander Afanasyev]], the Norwegians [[Peter Christen AsbjÃ¸rnsen]] and [[JÃ¸rgen Moe]], and the Englishman [[Joseph Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;Jack Zipes, ''The Great Fairy Tale Tradition: From Straparola and Basile to the Brothers Grimm'', p 846, ISBN 0-393-97636-X&lt;/ref&gt;  

Romanticist interest in non-classical antiquity coincided with the rise of [[Romantic nationalism]] and the rise of the [[nation state]] in the context of the [[1848 revolutions]], leading to the creation of ''[[national epic]]s'' and [[national myth]]s for the various newly formed states.
Pagan or folkloristic topics were also common in the [[Musical nationalism]] of the period.

==Contemporary Paganism==
{{Main|Neopaganism}}{{anchor|Neopaganism}}

[[File:Paganavebury.jpg|thumb|Pagan handfasting ceremony at Avebury (Beltane 2005).]]
Contemporary Paganism, or Neopaganism, includes [[Polytheistic reconstructionism|reconstructed religions]] such as [[Hellenic polytheism]], [[Celtic Reconstructionist Paganism|Celtic]] or [[Germanic neopaganism|Germanic]] reconstructionism as well as modern eclectic traditions such as [[Discordianism]], or [[Wicca]] and its many offshoots.

Many of the &quot;revivals&quot;, [[Wicca]] and [[Neo-druidism]] in particular, have their roots in 19th century [[Romanticism]] and retain noticeable elements of [[occultism]] or [[theosophy]] that were current then, setting them apart from historical rural (''paganus'') folk religion.
[[File:Amulet Thor's hammer (copy of find from SkÃ¥ne) 2010-07-10.jpg|right|thumb|220px|The hammer [[MjÃ¶llnir]] is one of the primary symbols of Germanic [[Neopaganism]]. Pendants of the MjÃ¶llnir are commonly worn amongst Germanic [[Neopagans]].]]
[[Neopaganism in the United States]] accounts for roughly a third of all contemporary Pagans worldwide, and for some 0.2% of US population, figuring as the sixth largest non-Christian denomination in the US, after [[Judaism]] (1.4%), [[Islam]] (0.6%), [[Buddhism]] (0.5%), [[Hinduism]] (0.3%) and [[Unitarian Universalism]] (0.3%).&lt;ref&gt;[[Religion in the United States#The American Religious Identification Survey|ARIS]] 2001 figures.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Iceland]], the members of [[ÃsatrÃºarfÃ©lagiÃ°]] account for 0.4% of the total population,&lt;ref&gt;Statistics Iceland â [http://www.statice.is/?PageID=1180&amp;src=/temp_en/Dialog/varval.asp?ma=MAN10001%26ti=Populations+by+religious+organizations+1990-2008+%26path=../Database/mannfjoldi/Trufelog/%26lang=1%26units=Number Statistics &gt;&gt; Population &gt;&gt; Religious organisations]&lt;/ref&gt; which is just over a thousand people. In Lithuania, many people practice [[Romuva]], a revived version of the pre-Christian religion of that country. Lithuania was among the last areas of Europe to be Christianized.

There are a number of Pagan authors who have examined the relation of the 20th-century movements of polytheistic revival with historical polytheism on one hand and  contemporary traditions of indigenous folk religion on the other.
[[Isaac Bonewits]] introduces a terminology to make this distinction,&lt;ref name=&quot;Defs&quot;&gt;[http://www.neopagan.net/PaganDefs.html &quot;Defining Paganism: Paleo-, Meso-, and Neo-&quot;]
(Version 2.5.1) 1979, 2007 c.e., Isaac Bonewits&lt;/ref&gt;
*Paleopaganism: A [[retronym]] coined to contrast with &quot;[[Neopaganism]]&quot;, &quot;original polytheistic, nature-centered faiths&quot;, such as  the pre-Hellenistic [[Ancient Greek religion|Greek]] and pre-imperial [[Religion in ancient Rome|Roman religion]], pre-Migration period [[Germanic paganism]] as described by [[Tacitus]], or [[Celtic polytheism]] as described by [[Julius Caesar]]. Among extant &quot;[[major religion]]s&quot;, Bonewits would count as Paleopagan   [[Hinduism]] as it stood prior to the [[Islamic invasions of India]], [[Shintoism]] and [[Taoism]].
*Mesopaganism: A group, which is, or has been, significantly influenced by monotheistic, dualistic, or nontheistic worldviews, but has been able to maintain an independence of religious practices. This group includes aboriginal Americans as well as [[Australian aborigines]], [[Viking Age]] [[Norse paganism]] and [[New Age]] spirituality.  Influences include: [[Freemasonry]], [[Rosicrucianism]], [[Theosophy]], [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualism]], and the many Afro-Diasporic faiths like [[Haitian Vodou]], [[SanterÃ­a]] and Espiritu religion. [[Isaac Bonewits]] includes [[British Traditional Wicca]] in this subdivision.
*[[Neopaganism]]: A movement by modern people to revive nature-worshipping, pre-Christian religions, or other nature-based spiritual paths. This definition may include groups such as [[Neo-druidism]] and [[Wicca]] at the other.

Prudence Jones and Nigel Pennick in their ''A History of Pagan Europe'' (1995) classify &quot;pagan religions&quot; as characterized by the following traits:
:*[[polytheism]]: Pagan religions recognise a plurality of divine beings, which may or may not be considered aspects of an underlying unity (the [[soft and hard polytheism]] distinction)
:*&quot;[[Earth religion|nature-based]]&quot;: Pagan religions have a concept of the divinity of [[Nature]],  which they view as a  manifestation of the divine, not as the &quot;fallen&quot; creation found in [[Dualistic cosmology]].
:*&quot;[[sacred feminine]]&quot;: Pagan religions recognize &quot;the female divine principle&quot;, identified as  &quot;[[Goddess movement|the Goddess]]&quot; (as opposed to individual [[goddesses]]) besides or in place of the male divine principle as expressed in the Abrahamic [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Prudence; Pennick, Nigel (1995). ''A History of Pagan Europe''. Page 2. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Demographics===
Paganism has been previously defined broadly, to encompass many or most of the faith traditions outside the [[Abrahamic religions]].

The term has also been used more narrowly,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/paganism.htm Meanings of the terms Pagan and Paganism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eisenstadt, S.N., 1983, Transcendental Visions â Other-Worldliness â and Its Transformations: Some More Comments on L. Dumont. ''Religion''13:1â17, at p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael York, Paganism as Root-Religion, The Pomegranate, 6:1 (2004), pp. 11â18 (distinguishing the main streams of developed religion as gnostic, dharmic, Abrahamic and pagan).&lt;/ref&gt; however, to refer only to religions outside the very large group of so-called [[Axial Age]] faiths that encompass both the Abrahamic religions and the chief Indian religions. Under this narrower definition, which differs from that historically used by many&lt;ref name=&quot;newadvent.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11388a.htm Catholic Encyclopaedia (1917 edition) on paganism]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=33161 Hindu rites at a famous Catholic shrine shocks many Catholics]&lt;/ref&gt;  (though by no means all&lt;ref&gt;David Scott, Christian Responses to Buddhism in Pre-Medieval Times, Numen, Vol. 32, No. 1 (Jul., 1985), pp. 88â100&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Audrius Beinorius, Buddhism in the Early European Imagination: A Historical Perspective, ACTA ORIENTALIA VILNENSIA 6:2 (2005), pp. 7â22&lt;/ref&gt;) Christians and other Westerners,  contemporary Paganism is a smaller and more marginal numerical phenomenon. According to [[Encyclopedia Britannica]] estimates (as of 2005), adherents of [[Chinese folk religion]] account for some 6.3% of world population, and adherents of [[tribal religion]]s (&quot;ethnoreligionists&quot;) for another 4.0%. The number of adherents of neopaganism is insignificant in comparison, amounting to 0.02% of world population at the most, or some 0.4% of the &quot;ethnoreligious&quot; population.
