Tulsa opened the season with a trip to the [[Louisiana Superdome|Superdome]] to take on division rival Tulane, whom they had defeated 56â7 in [[2008 Tulsa Golden Hurricane football team#Tulane|2008]]. Tulsa scored on their first three possessions to build up a 17â0 lead as Tulane's offense struggled in the first quarter. Tulane managed cut the deficit to 13 points late in the third quarter, but Damaris Johnson's 66-yard punt return for a score with twelve minutes to play ended their hopes of a comeback. Sophomore quarterback G.J. Kinne went 15 of 20 for 211 yards in his debut with the Golden Hurricane, throwing for one touchdown and running for another.

The Lobos responded with a field goal to make it 7-3 at the end of the first, but Tulsa scored 23 unanswered points in the second and third quarters to put the game out of reach.

In week 3, the Golden Hurricane made the drive to [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]] for their 24th meeting with the Sooners, whom they had beaten only once since 1979. Tulsa appeared to be off to a good start, intercepting [[Landry Jones]] on the first play of the game and taking 25 of their first 27 snaps in Oklahoma territory, but two costly red-zone turnovers and a missed 50-yard field goal kept them scoreless in the first half while the Sooners built an insurmountable 31-0 lead.

After a bye week, Tulsa returned home for a Wednesday-night matchup against Boise State, their highest-ranked opponent of the season. After recovering a muffed punt at their own 47, the Golden Hurricane got on the board first when Kinne pitched the ball to A.J. Whitmore, who completed a 53-yard trick pass to Damaris Johnson for the score. The Broncos responded with a touchdown and successful two-point conversion on their next drive, but Tulsa took the lead again when Kinne hit Trae Johnson from 15 yards at the end of the first quarter. Boise State scored 20 straight in the second and third quarters, but Tulsa threatened again in the fourth when Kinne completed two consecutive passes to Slick Shelley for 91 yards and a touchdown. After stopping Boise State twice, the Golden Hurricane got the ball back with just under two minutes to play for a final chance to tie the game. Three plays later, Kinne missed a wide-open Charles Clay on 4th and 6 and the Broncos were able to run out the clock.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Boise State survives Tulsa scare to remain unbeaten.&quot; [[Associated Press]].

Tulsa played their second straight Wednesday game on October 21, traveling to the [[Sun Bowl Stadium|Sun Bowl]] to take on a team they had defeated in a [[2008 Tulsa Golden Hurricane football team#UTEP|77â35 shootout]] the previous season. This time, the Miners were better prepared, building up a 13-0 lead in the first quarter. However, the momentum appeared to shift in the second after Tulsa got on the board with a 19-yard run from A.J. Whitmore and two long UTEP drives were ended by interceptions. The Golden Hurricane continued to roll after halftime, scoring 17 straight to take an 11-point lead. Tulsa appeared set to cruise to another easy win, but the tide of the game turned again in the middle of the fourth quarter when UTEP finally got their offense back in gear and cut the deficit to 3 with a touchdown and two-point conversion. After Tulsa went three-and-out on their next possession, the Miners drove down the field again to score the game-winning touchdown with 29 seconds remaining.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Buckram's 165 yards, late TD carry UTEP past Tulsa.&quot; [[Associated Press]].

The Golden Hurricane followed up their loss to UTEP with a poor homecoming performance against SMU on October 31. The first three drives of the game ended in turnovers and neither offense was able to do anything in the first quarter. Backup quarterback Jacob Bower came on in the second to replace a struggling Kinne, who went 2 of 10 for 10 yards and two interceptions. Bower completed a pair of 28-yard passes on his first drive, enabling a 13-yard touchdown run by Charles Opeseyitan with nine minutes to go in the half. SMU answered with a touchdown of its own, and the teams entered the locker room tied at 7. After the break, the Mustangs scored 13 straight to take a 20â7 lead. Tulsa managed to reduce the deficit to 7 when Bower hit Jacob Collums from 13 yards out, but the extra point was blocked. The Golden Hurricane's next drive ended after Kinne reentered the game for a questionable 4th-and-18 pass attempt which was broken up.

On November 7, Houston's fourth field goal of the game came as time expired giving the 13th-ranked Cougars a 46-45 victory over the Tulsa Golden Hurricane in front of 20,243 fans at H.A. Chapman Stadium during a televised Saturday night game. Four turnovers, including two interceptions and two fumbles, and a 98-yard Houston kickoff return doomed the Hurricane. Tulsa's Charles Clay capped a 73-yard, 10 play touchdown drive with a one-yard run with 3:28 remaining in the game to put the Hurricane ahead 45â37. But the nation's top-ranked offense marched 61 yards in 13 plays in just 3:02 to close the gap to 45â43. The Cougars two-point conversion failed with just 0:21 on the clock, presumably giving the Hurricane a 45â43 victory. But, the Cougars recovered the subsequent onside kick at the Houston 39-yard line. Three plays later, Houston traveled to the Tulsa 34-yard line setting up the winning field goal. Tulsa's G.J. Kinne became the first quarterback in school history to pass for 300 yards and rush for 100 yards in the same game, as he finished with 334 passing yards and three TDs, and 100 rushing yards and one touchdown. Charles Clay scored four touchdowns, two rushing and two receiving for the Hurricane, while Damaris Johnson totaled a career-best 324 all-purpose yards. Houston totaled 695 total yards on a new Tulsa opponent record of 100 plays, while the Hurricane gained a season-best 534 total yards.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Hogan's 51-yard FG as time expires caps rally in final 21 seconds&quot; [[Associated Press]].

In a rematch of the previous season's C-USA championship game, the Pirates (6â4, 5â1) dominated on offense in the first half and then sealed the game with three defensive touchdowns in the fourth quarter during a rare Sunday night game at Chapman Stadium on November 15.  Damaris Johnson, the nation's leader in all-purpose yardage, got the Golden Hurricane back in the game after the Pirates had built a 20-point lead in the first half. He returned a kickoff 57 yards and then had catches on back-to-back plays, the second going for 9 yards and a touchdown that brought Tulsa to 23â17 with 4 minutes left in the third quarter. East Carolina couldn't get its offense going again after amassing 401 yards in the first half, but G.J. Kinne's pass to Johnson was intercepted and returned for a touchdown to provide some extra cushion. Tulsa got the ball to the 7 on its ensuing possession, but Kinne's pass on fourth-and-6 bounced off of nose guard Linval Joseph's helmet and fell incomplete. A ECU defender then picked off another Kinne pass and brought it back 57 yards to put the game away with 2:23 remaining. The Pirates added a 49-yard return of a Kinne fumble 46 seconds later.  Kinne finished with 236 yards on 23-for-46 passing with two touchdowns and the two interceptions. Johnson had 14 catches for 135 yards. Ryan Fitzpatrick also connected on a career-long 51-yard field goal.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;East Carolina 44, Tulsa 17&quot; [[Associated Press]]. November 15, 2009.
