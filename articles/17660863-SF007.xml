'''Process Monitor''' is a free tool from [[Windows Sysinternals]], part of the [[Microsoft TechNet]] [[website]]. The tool, as an alternative to [[Windows Task Manager]], monitors and displays in real-time all file system activity on a [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. It combines two older tools, FileMon and RegMon and is used in [[system administration]], [[computer forensics]], and application debugging.

Process Monitor monitors and records all actions attempted against the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows Registry|Registry]].  Process Monitor can be used to detect failed attempts to read and write registry keys. It also allows for filtering on specific keys, processes, process IDs, and values. In addition it shows how applications use files and [[DLL]]s, detects some critical errors in [[system file]]s and more.

==History==
RegMon and its sister application [[Filemon]] were primarily created by [[Mark Russinovich]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/about.aspx TechNet Blogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bryce Cogswell]], employed by [[Nu-Mega Technologies]] and later [[SysInternals]] prior SysInternals being bought out by [[Microsoft]] in 2006.

The two tools were combined to create [[Process Monitor]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/technet/sysinternals/ProcessesAndThreads/Regmon.mspx RegMon for Windows&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb896645.aspx Process Monitor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;. Early versions of Process Monitor (up to version 2.8) ran on Windows 2000 SP4 with Update Rollup 4 &lt;ref&gt; [http://blogs.technet.com/b/chad/archive/2009/12/30/how-to-use-sysinternals-process-monitor-and-process-explorer-to-troubleshoot-sharepoint.aspx How to use Sysinternals Process Monitor and Process Explorer to Troubleshoot SharePoint] &lt;/ref&gt;. The current version only runs on Windows XP with the latest service pack and above.

===FileMon=== 
'''FileMon''' (from a [[concatenation]] of &quot;File&quot; and &quot;Monitor&quot;) â was a free utility for 32/64-bit [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating systems]] which provided users with a powerful tool to monitor and display file system activity.

FileMon is no longer supported.

===RegMon===
The [[regmon]] utility from Sysinternals provided forensics on [[Windows Registry]] usage.

RegMon is no longer supported.
