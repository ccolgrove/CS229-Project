He made his first appearance on 30 January 2006, when he was knocked over by [[Dot Branning]] and locked out of his house naked. [[Mo Harris]] picked the lock for him, but as his towel was caught in the door, he then had just his hands to cover himself. In 2011 Ellis said he would not consider returning to the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=Alison|title=60 Seconds|journal=[[Soaplife]]|date=13â24 June 2011|issue=252|pages=40|accessdate=17 June 2011|publisher=[[IPC Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Cousins gave [[Honey Mitchell|Honey Edwards]] advice about her unborn baby, found [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] when he ran away, and talked to [[Little Mo Mitchell]] about her baby [[Freddie Mitchell (EastEnders)|Freddie]], thinking that she was suffering from stress. He then developed romantic feelings for Little Mo.

Oliver went on a date with Little Mo, where she confided in him that she sometimes struggled with Freddie. He walked her home that night and they shared a kiss on the doorstep. Mo later confided in Oliver that she had nearly hit Freddie when he had been crying.	 
		
When Freddie was injured, Oliver told his colleague, [[List of EastEnders characters (2006)#Briony Campbell|Dr. Briony Campbell]], what Mo had told him. She told Social Services, who suspected Mo had caused Freddie's injuries. However, Mo suspected 10-year-old Ben Mitchell had caused them. Mo found out that Oliver had betrayed her and ended their relationship. Oliver was offered a job in [[Leeds]] and decided to leave Walford. When he told Little Mo, she was heartbroken. Since then, their relationship was on and off but they reconciled shortly after. 
	 
At the same time, Ben told Oliver that he hit Freddie on purpose, confirming Little Mo's suspicion, but Ben's father [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] told Oliver to keep quiet. Oliver took Mo for dinner and tried to convince her to go to the police to clear her name but she refused. They went to [[the Queen Victoria|The Queen Vic]] together and [[Peggy Mitchell]] called Mo a child beater. Oliver stood up for her and was about to tell everyone the truth about Freddie's injury. Little Mo was angry with Oliver for not respecting her decision and she stormed out the pub.

Oliver got drunk the following day and barmaid [[Dawn Swann]] had to help him get into his flat at the end of the night. [[Stacey Slater]] saw this but didn't tell Mo. Oliver finally admitted to Mo that he loved her and proposed to her on 25 May 2006. Happy with the outcome, the two prepared to leave Walford for Leeds, but not before apologising to Dawn for chucking her out of his flat the day he got drunk. She gave him a friendly kiss but Stacey also saw this and told Mo. Mo confronted Oliver and she pushed him to the ground and in response, he ended their relationship out of shock at to what she did to him. 

As Little Mo prepared to leave for [[Barnstaple]], Oliver realised that he still loved her and decided to ask her to go with him to [[Leeds]]. He ran to the tube station and tried to convince her to join him so they could be together. Little Mo chose not to go, and she left with Freddie. That day he also left Walford.

'''Albert &quot;Bert&quot; Atkinson''', played by [[Dave Hill (actor)|Dave Hill]], made his first appearance in [[Albert Square]] on 24 February 2006. He is last seen leaving Walford on 23 July 2007. Bert is from [[Slaithwaite]] in [[Huddersfield]], [[Yorkshire]] and is proud Yorkshireman and frequently mentions it in the show. He can often be found boasting around Albert Square about how Southerners do not match up to him and his fellow Northerners.

He is a friend of [[Joe Macer]], and comes to [[Walford]] to visit him, having heard from Joe's daughter [[Megan Macer|Megan]] of his marriage to [[Pauline Fowler]]. On the day he arrives, he is mistaken for a tramp by [[Bradley Branning]], flirts with [[Yolande Trueman]] and interrupts [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] and [[Sonia Fowler]]'s evening of passion by letting himself into their house while Joe and Pauline are on their honeymoon.

He flirts with [[Mo Harris]] and takes her back to Pauline and Joe's, where the newlyweds walk in on them kissing on the sofa. Mo identifies a [[tattoo]] on his upper left arm as one obtained in [[prison]], and realises that Bert knows Joe from prison. She reveals this to [[Dot Branning]] after splitting with Bert, after finding him in an alley in a tight embrace with Ina, a local market stall holder. After Pauline discovers Joe and Dot's betrayal, Bert moves in with Jim, Dot, Sonia and Bradley at 25 Albert Square. He later makes up with Mo and their passion started again.

In November 2006, Bert receives a visit from a man telling him that his ex-wife [[Evie Brown|Evie]] wanted to see him. She is dying of [[breast cancer]], and tells Bert that she still loves him, even after 38 years of not seeing each other. She also reveals that their daughter, Karen, died of breast cancer in 2004. Bert brings Evie back to Walford to stay with [[Pat Evans]] while the rest of her family are away, and Bert moves in with her, breaking up with Mo. Evie dies days after arriving in the Square but she shocks Bert by telling him that he has a grandson called [[Jay Brown|Jay]]. At Evie's funeral Bert meets Jay for the first time but does not introduce himself because he is too afraid of what may happen. Bert moves out of Pat's house and in with [[Patrick Trueman|Patrick]] and [[Yolande Trueman]]

On 5 February 2007, Beryl, the carer of Bert's grandson, Jay, brings Jay to live with Bert, saying she cannot look after him anymore. Bert tries to teach Jay not to steal, as he steals from [[Deano Wicks]]'s stall and Patrick and Yolande's shop. 

Pat later persuades [[Ian Beale]] to let Bert and Jay live at 15a Turpin Road (the flat above Ian's fish and chip shop). He is referred to an eye specialist with a suspected [[glaucoma]] after a check up at his optician's. Initially Bert refuses to have anything to do with surgery but after Jay discovers how serious his condition is and threatens to move out, Bert has the surgery and appears to make a full recovery.

In July 2007 Jay's father, [[Jase Dyer]], appears in Albert Square, looking for his son. After an initially frosty meeting, Bert allows him to meet Jay. The father and son hit it off together, and Jase moves into the flat. On seeing his grandson is being well looked after, Bert takes his cue to pack his bags and move on from the Square.

Bert is last mentioned twice on January 2009 in a conversation between Pat and [[Billy Mitchell (EastEnders)|Billy Mitchell]] due to Jay's behaviour problems and in March 2009 when Jay returns to Walford informing Billy that he is living with Bert, however, it is all a lie when an episode ends in Jay tucking himself in bed â covered in cardboard on a park bench. Mo eventually learns from Bert that Jay was not living with him and tells Billy, who then invites Jay to stay with him again.

Steve started jeering at the exotic dancer, [[SJ Fletcher]], and Bradley joined in, upsetting his girlfriend [[Stacey Slater]].
He later appeared in August, and bullied Bradley in [[The Queen Victoria|The Queen Vic]] pub, forcing him to buy all the drinks. Bradley's father, [[Max Branning|Max]] told Steve to leave Bradley alone, which only sparked more bullying at work, including Steve creating a [[flash animation]] of Bradley's head on a baby's body.

Bradley and Steve later found out that they were both up for a promotion at the bank where they worked. Steve was confident in his interview, but Bradley forwarded an abusive [[e-mail]] to their boss, [[#Tony Andrews|Mr. Andrews]], which got Steve fired. He was last seen being escorted out of the bank by security after losing his job on 11 August 2006.

'''Sarah-Jane &quot;SJ&quot; Fletcher''' was played by [[Natasha Beaumont]]. SJ moved to [[England]] from Australia (a few years before her arrival in [[Walford]]) to work in a gentleman's club, but needed somewhere to live because her landlord was selling up. She made her first appearance on 16 June 2006 when her car's tyre deflated in [[Albert Square]]. The mechanic, [[Minty Peterson]], helped her out by changing her tyre, and she took him to lunch to say thank you, but 'forgot' her purse.

Soon after, Minty and his flat mate [[Garry Hobbs|Garry]] were shocked to see SJ in [[R&amp;R (EastEnders)#Scarlet|Scarlet]] nightclub working as a [[stripper]]. They let SJ stay at their flat, although Garry was apprehensive about SJ and didn't want her to stay permanently. Minty was extremely keen on SJ. He enjoyed her company and didn't seem to mind that she rarely paid her way. Garry began to feel pushed aside by his best mate and a certain level of animosity arose whenever SJ was around. Minty was initially oblivious to this and invited SJ on a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] holiday in [[Germany]] that he had planned with Garry. SJ was extremely excited, however but decided not to go on the trip when Garry and Minty started to argue over her. After further arguing, SJ was eventually asked to leave Garry and Minty's flat, she departed for a while but upon her return, she began renting a flat of her own in [[Walford]].

Garry became infuriated with SJ manipulating Minty out of his money, feeling she was little more than a user. Minty would pay SJ's rent, continuously buy her gifts and drinks, give her money and take her out to dinner. Garry also suspected SJ was sleeping with her visitor [[List of EastEnders characters (2006)#Sid Clarke|Sid Clarke]], a fellow Australian. SJ denied the allegation and claimed that Sid was her brother, even producing photographic evidence of her and Sid together as kids to prove she wasn't lying. Minty believed her explanation, however it later became clear that SJ was deceiving him and Sid was actually her boyfriend.

Sid and SJ constructed a plan to keep Minty keen on SJ so they could continue to pilfer his money. SJ would flirt and lead Minty on, but the relationship never went further. Nevertheless Minty was quick to believe that there was a possibility he and SJ could eventually be together, so he was more than willing to ply her with money, even if it meant his own life suffered as a result. However, on 2 October 2006, Minty got fed up of SJ using him to buy her drinks in [[The Queen Victoria|The Queen Vic]] and shouted at her in the Square. Realising that she was about to lose her 'meal ticket' SJ changed tack. She and Minty reconciled, and started a relationship. The relationship was a sham, as SJ was still seeing Sid, but Minty was over the moon. He became infatuated with SJ, ruining his friendship with Garry and losing his job at the arches in the process, and what little money he did have was quickly squandered by SJ.

After months of using Minty, SJ began to feel guilty. She made it clear to Sid that she cared for Minty and didn't want to keep hurting him, but Sid could only think of the money that he would lose if the scam stopped. SJ tried to convince Sid to go home to Australia with her, so they could have a baby. Sid explained that he couldn't fulfil her needs and SJ ordered him to get out, but quickly changed her mind and ended up in bed with him at the same time she was due to meet Minty for a romantic meal. Meanwhile Garry had discovered that SJ and Sid were an item and while Minty was waiting for SJ to arrive for their meal, he went to his flat to declare that he had seen SJ and Sid kissing. Minty refused to believe him, and in order to prove that he was lying he went to SJ's, entered her flat and was shocked to see her having sex with Sid. The next morning, SJ and Sid had disappeared.

'''Rachel Branning''' is the mother of [[Bradley Branning]], and ex-wife of [[Max Branning|Max]]. She arrived in [[Albert Square]] when Bradley's grandfather [[Jim Branning|Jim]] threw him out of his house. She was still bitter about Max cheating on her with [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]]. She attacked Tanya at the opening of Booty. Rachel was determined to split Max and Tanya up so she tried to kiss Max, although he did not reciprocate. She apologised to Tanya that she had kissed Max as part of her plan to split them up. Rachel then returned to Tring.

Rachel returned to the Square on 18 October 2007 to help with preparations for Bradley's wedding to [[Stacey Slater]]. She was trying to take control of everything and continually kept making snide remarks about Tanya. She also warned Stacey that she could be next on Max's list of women, but like Tanya, Rachel was unaware of Stacey's affair with Max. Tanya told Rachel to move on, but she remained stuck in the past.

On 3 January 2008, she again returned to the Square after Dot had called her to tell her that Bradley needed her help due to the revelation of Stacey's affair with Max. Rachel took action and told Bradley that he should move in with her to take his mind off things. Bradley first said no, but after second thoughts, agreed to go back to Rachel's. Bradley then left Dot a note, saying to her that he has changed his mind and has gone by himself.

On 12 February 2008, Stacey travelled to Tring to find Bradley again and went to Rachel's house. Rachel was not pleased to see Stacey, still angry at her for hurting Bradley due to her affair with Max and told her that Bradley wanted nothing more to do with her and tried to throw her out. Stacey then told Rachel that she had been pregnant with Bradley's child, but Bradley forced her to have an abortion. Rachel showed sympathy to Stacey and gave her Bradley's address. Bradley later confronted his mum about giving Stacey his address, but Rachel told Bradley she gave Stacey his address because he needs to make a choice about his relationship with her, and that choice must be made. 

Bradley travelled to Tring to spend Christmas Day 2008 with her. She came to Walford for Bradley and [[Syd Chambers]]' leaving party on 8 October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a179389/staceys-condition-worsens.html|title=Stacey's condition worsens|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|accessdate=29 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made snide remarks towards Tanya, who returned home and convinced Max to come to the party. Rachel got drunk and warned Tanya that Max would always be a cheater, but Tanya defended her husband and told Rachel to move on from her own heartbreak.

Rachel returned on 3 December 2009 when Max needed money, telling her that he needed to forward it to Bradley in [[Canada]], but asked her to make the cheque out to him. [[Masood Ahmed]] drives Rachel back to Tring is his taxi but Max notices Rachel did not sign the cheque so he phones her mobile. She removes her seatbelt to reach her bag and Masood falls asleep at the wheel, causing the car to swerve and topple over. Masood is slightly injured but Rachel is hospitalised with a [[ruptured spleen]]. When Max visits her she tells him that she knew he was going to forge her signature on the cheque as she had known he was conning her all along, which she explained she had stopped the transfer. Rachel is discharged and visits Max, giving him a cheque for Â£3,000, saying she does not want to see his children out on the street. 

On 22 February 2010, Max contacts Rachel to tell her that Bradley has died after falling from the rooftop of [[The Queen Victoria]] public house. Max's sister [[Carol Jackson]] phones Rachel about the funeral and she cries on the phone. Rachel makes her final appearance at Bradley's funeral on 5 March, where she lays flowers on his grave with [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]).

Liz arrives in [[Walford]] from her home in [[Spain]] for Owen's trial, following his arrest for assaulting Denise. When Owen receives a suspended sentence, Liz arranges for him to move to [[Cardiff]] with her sister, and tries to take Owen away in a taxi. As the taxi leaves, Owen gets out and tells his mother he needs an alcoholic drink. He returns drunk, and knocks Liz unconscious. She wakes up to find that he has kidnapped his daughter [[Libby Fox|Libby]] ([[Belinda Owusu]]), and tried to kill her and himself. Liz tries to visit Libby in hospital, but Denise lies to her that Libby is sleeping. She then returns to Spain. 

She returns three years later for Libby's 18th birthday,&lt;ref name=&quot;owenliz&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a159616/owen-liz-turner-return-to-eastenders.html|title=Owen, Liz Turner return to 'EastEnders'|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=15 June 2009|accessdate=15 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and tells Libby that Owen wants her to visit him in prison. Libby does visit him, but regrets it after Denise finds out from her other daughter, [[Chelsea Fox|Chelsea]] ([[Tiana Benjamin]]). Liz tries to apologise to the Foxes about what Owen did to them, but Denise refuses to accept it. Liz then tries to get to know Libby better, but Libby informs her that Denise does not want Owen back in her life and Libby is going to support her mother's decision, meaning that she is no longer able to spend time with Liz. After an emotional goodbye between grandmother and granddaughter, Liz visits Owen one last time before returning to Spain, but he demands that she cancel her flight. The next week Liz decides to live in Walford, becoming [[Dot Branning]]'s ([[June Brown]]) lodger, which is met with opposition from Denise. She starts working on [[Ian Beale]]'s ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) fruit and veg stall and starts learning dances with [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) for a charity event, and they eventually go on a date.

When Owen is released from prison, he comes to Walford to see Liz, even though his license conditions forbid it. Owen starts a vendetta against Denise's new fiancÃ© [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]), and Lucas calls the police feeling very jealous of his presence to Denise. Lucas has Owen arrested for breaching his licence conditions, and when Liz visits him in prison he fails to convince her that Lucas is not the man everyone thinks he is. Liz orders Owen to get away from Walford, but he confronts Lucas on the day of his wedding to Denise, so Lucas murders him by strangling him with his bow tie. Liz feels guilty as she has sent Owen away from Walford so that he cannot interfere. She constantly tries to call him but thinks he has disowned her after not returning the calls, so she decides to give up and return to Spain. She returns again a few months later, turning up at Lucas and Denise's house, worried that she has not heard from Owen. She enlists Patrick's help, and they discover Owen has not used his mobile phone since the day he disappeared. Liz and Lucas argue over Owen, but Lucas promises to help her find her son. Liz mentions that Owen never fails to send flowers on her birthday, and is relieved when she receives flowers in Owen's name, but is suspicious when they are lilies, as Owen always sends daffodils. She returns to Spain without telling Patrick, but after he speaks to her on the phone, she says she will return to continue searching for Owen.

When Liz returns to Walford, she and Patrick start a relationship. Patrick worries that Liz wants to marry him but is relieved when Liz says she does not want to get married at her age. She decides she cannot continue the relationship without Owen's blessing, so begs Patrick to help find him. However, Denise asks Patrick to ask Liz to back off searching for Owen, and Patrick attempts to end their relationship, but Liz still wants to continue. That night Owen's body is discovered in the Square, and the next day the police inform Liz, leaving her devastated. Liz informs the police that she believes Denise is capable of killing Owen and watches as she is taken in for questioning. Liz then mourns Owen with Libby, but Libby disowns her after finding out that Liz had spoken to the police about Denise. Another body is found, which is identified as Denise's. Liz goes to Denise's wake and Patrick asks her to leave, but Libby says she wants her to stay and she reconciles with her granddaughter. On Libby's birthday, Liz gives her a photo of Owen. Later, she sees Denise and her family run from the house and Lucas being arrested. Patrick tells Liz that Lucas is the one who killed Owen, not Denise. It is revealed that Lucas had been keeping Denise prisoner and the body they buried belonged to someone else.

Liz decides she will return to Spain after Owen's funeral, and Chelsea asks to come with her to start a new life. Denise insists that Libby goes with them for a holiday. Preparing to leave, Liz says a final goodbye to Dot, saying it is hard to meet friends at her age, but Dot remains relatively cold towards Liz, hiding the fact she not want her to leave. Liz then says goodbye to Patrick, saying she will not return to England and that he has missed his chance. Waving goodbye to Walford, Liz leaves in a taxi with Libby and Chelsea.

Patrick's other guest, [[Jim Branning]], had heard of Cedric's wild reputation from Patrick, and was also shocked at the frail old man he met. When Patrick confronted Cedric, he told him that he was dying of [[pancreatic cancer]], and this was the &quot;farewell tour&quot; - he advised Patrick to enjoy his life, and not take it for granted as he had done. Afterwards, Cedric and Joy left to go home.

After Cedric's death, [[Denise Wicks|Denise Fox]] revealed to Patrick's wife [[Yolande Trueman|Yolande]] that she had never known her father but she knew he was in a band called The Five Hectors. It is therefore possible that Cedric was her father.

'''Aubrey Valentine''' was once a member of a band called The Five Hectors, along with [[Patrick Trueman]], [[#Cedric Lucas|Cedric Lucas]] and two other men named Dwight and Earl. Aubrey first appeared in [[Walford]] on 17 October 2006, for Cedric's funeral. Patrick revealed to Aubrey that local resident [[Denise Wicks|Denise Fox]] knew that her father was in The Five Hectors, but she did not know his name. On realising that he could possibly be Denise's father, Aubrey left the funeral reception.

He later returned and attended a dinner party at Patrick and [[Yolande Trueman|Yolande]]'s house, with Denise, her boyfriend [[Kevin Wicks|Kevin]], and children [[Chelsea Fox|Chelsea]] and [[Libby Fox|Libby]]. He agreed to take a paternity test for Denise, and stayed with her at [[Pat Evans]]' house. He later moved in with Patrick and Yolande when he found out that Patrick and Pat had had an affair. He then got Yolande drunk and they shared a passionate kiss.

When Yolande woke up, she couldn't remember anything beyond the kiss. 

Yolande decided to throw Aubrey out of her house, and whilst packing his bag for him, found that he hadn't sent off the paternity test. She confronted Aubrey, who told her that he knew he wasn't Denise's father, but didn't send off the test because he didn't want Patrick to have a daughter when he didn't. He also revealed that he wasn't rich as he had previously stated, and the car he drove was not his, but hired. Aubrey also confessed that he lied about having sex with Yolande, as he was jealous of Patrick having a wife.

Aubrey carried on pretending that he was awaiting the test results, until he made a speech during another dinner party at Pat's house, where he referred to Denise and her daughters as &quot;family&quot;, and Yolande exposed him as a fraud. He subsequently told Patrick that he and Yolande had kissed. As he drove away he told Patrick that things hadn't changed, and he always got Patrick's girls.

Preeti is a beauty therapist working at a beauty parlour called La Jolie Madame, but when [[Tanya Branning]]'s business starts failing, Tanya's husband [[Max Branning|Max]] suggests that she should poach Preeti to work at her beauty parlour, Booty, as Preeti has a large clientele. She has a [[one-night stand]] with [[Sean Slater]] when his fiancÃ©e [[Ruby Allen]] is in [[Venice]]. Sean's sister [[Stacey Slater|Stacey]] slaps her, but they later become friends. 

Preeti attends Tanya's birthday party with colleague [[Chelsea Fox]]. She dresses up in high heels and enhances her [[breast]]s with [[falsies|padding]] to impress [[Mickey Miller]], but falls over when she sees him as she is not used to wearing the shoes. When she gets up, Mickey's girlfriend, [[Li Chong (EastEnders)|Li Chong]] sees the padding and announces it to the pub. Preeti runs back to Chelsea's house, distraught. On Preeti's birthday, Chelsea and Li organise an [[Ann Summers]]-style party at Stacey's house. [[Bradley Branning]] asks her out after [[Deano Wicks]] is unsuccessful in chatting her up.

She goes on a date with salesman [[List of EastEnders characters (2007)#Warren Stamp|Warren Stamp]], but he attacks her, bruising her arm.

When Li manipulates Mickey into becoming an escort, Preeti teaches Mickey the finer arts of massage in an effort to get close to him. When Li discovers this, she is jealous. Li takes the opportunity to pay back Preeti during a ruckus at party held at [[Shirley Carter]]'s flat by viciously standing on her toe.

She flirts with Mickey when helping him find [[Gus Smith]]'s dog, [[Wellard]], who has been kidnapped. Preeti continues to hold a torch for Mickey and is put out when he and Gus go on a date with twin sisters Tamara and Tonicha.

However, Tanya apologises to Preeti about her behaviour and makes it up to her by offering her the position of manager. Preeti accepts her apology but does not want to take the job.

Preeti is not seen again but is mentioned in 2010 when Chelsea finds a toy that Preeti gave her.

'''Linda Clarke''', played by [[Lynda Baron]], is the mother of [[Jane Beale]] and [[Christian Clarke]]. She appeared for a couple of episodes in 2006, and then regularly from November 2008 to February 2009.

Linda surprised her daughter by coming to [[Walford]] for Jane's wedding to [[Ian Beale]]. Linda instantly caused controversy when she called Ian a bad father after she heard his daughter, [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]], talking to her friend, [[Lauren Branning]], about strippers. She also criticised [[Pat Evans]]'s earrings at Jane's hen-party, and berated Jane for wearing white when she was marrying for a second time. Linda revealed that Jane's birth name was Lesley, and continued to call her Lesley during her stay. When Jane's affair with [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] was revealed at the wedding ceremony, Linda left Walford and returned to Florida.

Linda returned on 10 November 2008, telling Ian and Jane that she and her husband [[Roger Clarke (EastEnders)|Roger]] had gone on separate holidays. Ian asked her to make a cake for [[Suzy Branning]] to beat [[Shirley Carter]] in a cake-baking competition. However, Linda got upset, started drinking, and made a sloppy effort. Later, in the Queen Vic pub, a very drunk Linda tried to come on to [[Charlie Slater]], offending his girlfriend, [[Brenda Boyle]], in the process. Explaining her actions, Linda admitted to Ian and Jane that she had split up with Roger and was moving in with them. 

Linda had not seen Christian for nearly 20 years before she returned to Walford. Initially, Christian intended to keep his distance from his mother but after learning how Lucy and Peter Beale had lost their mother, [[Cindy Beale|Cindy]], Christian attempted to rebuild his relationship with Linda and she briefly moved in with him. However, Christian announced that he was going to bring up [[Roxy Mitchell]]'s daughter, [[List of EastEnders characters (2008)#Amy Mitchell|Amy]], but Linda had doubts as to whether it was the right thing for her son. The following night, after Roxy changed her mind, Linda found that Christian had gone back to his old ways of bringing anyone home. Linda decided to leave him and tell Jane. She appreciated Ian for letting her move in with them and told him she would do whatever she could to help them. She continued to live with the Beales over Christmas.

On 26 January 2009, Linda received a letter from her husband, asking her to come back to him. Confused, Linda looked for solace at the Queen Vic pub, sharing a few drinks with [[Patrick Trueman]], (who was also drowning his sorrows). Later that day, Jane and [[Denise Wicks]] found Linda and Patrick kissing passionately. The next day, Patrick told Linda that he hoped for a reconciliation with his wife, [[Yolande Trueman|Yolande]]. Trying to put her marriage behind her, Linda decided to stay in Walford but Ian suggested that she move into sheltered accommodation. Later that day, Linda fell and hurt her leg, and Ian thought this was a ploy for her to stay. While Linda was asleep, Ian stole the letter from her husband, and then invited him to fetch her.
 
On 3 February 2009, Roger arrived at the Beales' house. He declared his affair was over, and asked Linda to return to Florida. While Jane and Ian were positive about this, Christian warned Linda that his father would only hurt her again. Christian suggested that Linda move in with him, but she declined and returned to Florida with Roger.

Since her departure she has been mentioned several times by her family. At Christmas 2009 Jane berated Ian for breaking her present from Linda. In April 2010 [[Masood Ahmed]], upon discovering Christian's affair with his married son [[Syed Masood|Syed]], paid for Christian to go visit his mother in Florida but he opted not to go. Jane then went to stay with her for three weeks from May to June 2010 for her birthday after Ian, panicking in case she discovered Lucy's abortion, contacted Linda to ask if Jane could stay with her for a while.
