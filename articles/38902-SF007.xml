'''Brown''' is a [[color term]], denoting a range of composite colors produced by a mixture of orange, red, rose, or yellow with black or gray. The term is from [[Old English]] ''brÃºn'', in origin for any dusky or dark shade of color.&lt;ref&gt;first attested in ''The [[Metres of Boethius]]'' 26. 58, ca. AD 1000: ''stunede sio brune yd wid odre'' &quot;One dark wave dashed against the other&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[Common Germanic]] adjective ''*brÃ»noz, *brÃ»nÃ¢'' meant both dark colors and a glistening or shining quality, whence ''[[burnish]]''. The current meaning developed in [[Middle English]] from the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;''His hare [was] like to the nute brun, quen it for ripnes fals dun'' &quot;his hair was like the nut brown, when for ripeness it falls down&quot;, Cursor M. 18833, ca. AD 1300, cited after [[OED]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The adjective is applied to naturally occurring colors, referring to animal fur, human [[brown hair|hair]],  human [[skin pigmentation]] (tans), partially charred or carbonized fiber as in toasted bread and other foods, [[peat]], withered leaves, etc.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;The burned and scorched superficies [of roast meat], the brown we call it.&quot; [[Robert Burton (scholar)|Robert Burton]], ''[[The anatomy of melancholy]]''(1651), p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the [[visible spectrum]], &quot;brown&quot; refers to high wavelength (low frequency) hues, [[yellow]], [[orange (colour)|orange]], or [[red]], in combination with low [[luminance]] or  [[Saturation (color theory)|saturation]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Some Experiments on Color&quot;, ''Nature'' '''111''', 1871, in {{cite book | title = Scientific Papers | author = [[John William Strutt]] (Lord Rayleigh) | year = 1899 | publisher = University Press | url = http://books.google.com/books?id=KWMSAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=date:0-1923+light+red+green+yellow-or-orange&amp;as_brr=1#PPA85,M1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Since ''brown'' may cover a wide range  of the visible spectrum, composite adjectives are used such as red brown, yellowish brown, dark brown or light brown.

As a color of low intensity, brown  is a [[tertiary color]]: a mix of the three subtractive [[primary color]]s is brown if the [[cyan]] content is low. Brown exists as a color perception only in the presence of a brighter color contrast:{{cn|date=September 2011}}  yellow, orange,  red, or rose objects are still perceived as such if the general illumination level is low, despite reflecting the same amount of red or orange light as a brown object would in normal lighting conditions. 

The first recorded use of ''brown'' as a color name in English was in 1000.&lt;ref&gt;Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 191&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[web color]] called &quot;brown&quot; is displayed at right. 

The historical and traditional name for this color is '''red-brown'''. 

The color shown above at the top right at the head of this article (color #964B00) is the color normally and traditionally regarded as ''brown''--a medium dark orange.  Its h (hue) code is 30, which signifies a shade of orange. The color to the immediate right (color #A52A2A) that was chosen as the web color &quot;brown&quot;--a medium dark redâis the color traditionally called ''red-brown''.

'''Russet''' is a  dark brown color with a reddish-orange tinge. 

The first recorded use of ''russet'' as a color name in [[English language|English]] was in 1562.&lt;ref&gt; Maerz and Paul ''A Dictionary of Color'' New York:1930 McGraw-Hill Page 203; Color Sample of Russet: Page 37 Plate 14 Color Sample I12&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the color derives from [[russet]], a coarse cloth made of wool and dyed with [[woad]] and [[madder]] to give it a subdued grey or reddish-brown shade.  By the statute of 1363, poor English people were required to wear russet.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Growth and decline in Colchester, 1300-1525 |author=R. H.

Russet, a color of [[Autumn|fall]], is often associated with sorrow or grave seriousness. Anticipating a lifetime of regret, [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s character Biron says: &quot;Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd / In russet yeas and honest kersey noes.&quot; (''[[Love's Labour's Lost]]'', Act V, Scene 1)
