'''Jetix''' was a children's television channel owned by [[Disney-ABC Television Group]] broadcast in [[Russia]], [[Romania]], [[Bulgaria]] and other countries. It was previously known as '''[[Fox Kids]]'''. It was broadcast simultaneously in four languages (using [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] audio technology): [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] , [[English language|English]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]. Advertising was shown in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Russian language|Russian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

Jetix was broadcast in [[Romania]] by all cable TV and DTH operators. The Romanian version of the channel was also included in the list of channels of various [[Moldova]]n cable operators as well as in the basic package of the digital platform ''[[Digi TV]]'' in [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]].

Jetix Russia and Jetix Romania were broadcast in 24/7 mode by all cable and satellite TV operators (such as [[NTV Plus]]), with the normal Jetix available till 21.00, and Jetix Max till the morning. 

Jetix Max was a night programming block featuring more teen-oriented shows such as: [[Naruto]], [[Shaman King]], [[H2O: Just Add Water]], [[Power Rangers: Operation Overdrive]] and [[Transformers Animated]].

This TV channel was also available in [[Slovenia]] from 06:00-19:00 from a cable operator Telemach and from [[IP TV]] provider SiOL. [[T-2]]([[IP TV]] provider) also provides this channel now 24/7.

Fox Kids, Jetix and later Disney Channel has been available in all cable operators in Bulgaria since around 1999 and was mostly broadcast with either the Russian or English language audio track. From October 2007 Jetix was available with a Bulgarian audio track for some of the shows. The Jetix brand was previously known in Bulgaria from [[Balkan News Corporation]]'s channel [[bTV (Bulgaria)|bTV]], which continued to air a Jetix block even after Fox Kids was sold to Disney. Currently, translation and distribution for the channel's Bulgarian version was handled by [[Media Link]]. It was expected that the channel would reach 100% translation of its shows in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jetixeurope.com/site/press_office/press_releases/bulgaria_localisation.html&lt;br/&gt;''Jetix begins localisation of its Bulgarian Channel'' - 31 October 2007 ''(retrieved on November 14, 2007)''&lt;/ref&gt; However, this was achieved only in early 2009, with many shows being withheld from broadcast after February [[2009]] until translation of their episodes was completed. In May and June many such programs would be returned to the channel, since translation has advanced a lot. [[Hannah Montana]] is was the only untranslated show, however it is available in Bulgarian on [[BNT 1]] since [[March 28]], [[2009]]. It is still not known when the station promos and announcements will start showing in Bulgarian (currently they remain in English).

On August 11, 2008 Jetix started broadcasting in Romania a block of &quot;Disney stars&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.telemaniac.com/jetix-bgro ''ÐÐ¶ÐµÑÐ¸ÐºÑ ÑÐµ ÑÐ²ÐµÐ»Ð¸ÑÐ¸ Ð¿ÑÐ¾Ð³ÑÐ°Ð¼Ð¸ÑÐµ Ð½Ð° ÐÐ¸ÑÐ½Ð¸ Ð² ÐÑÐ»Ð³Ð°ÑÐ¸Ñ Ð¸ Ð ÑÐ¼ÑÐ½Ð¸Ñ'' (translation: ''Jetix to air more Disney programming in Romania'') (in Bulgarian); retrieved August 20, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; featuring the series [[Kim Possible]], [[Phineas and Ferb]], [[American Dragon]] and [[Hannah Montana]]. [[High School Musical]] aired on August 22, 2008 and [[High School Musical 2]] aired on November 1, 2008. The Disney block was only available in Romania and Bulgaria. It was fully translated in Romanian, and an old Bulgarian translation of Kim Possible (once aired on [[BNT Channel 1]]) was made available on October 20, 2008. High School Musical 2 was also translated. Subsequently, Phineas and Ferb and American Dragon were also translated by Media Link using voice-over dubbing (unlike all pre-2005 Disney cartoon series, which were all dubbed with synchronized voices). This way of dubbing was very common in Bulgarian television, because it costs less and takes less time to produce (as the voices of actors are just placed directly over a quieted original voice track). Usually, only theatrically or home video-released animated films are dubbed with synchronized voices, and in the 1990s only Disney's animated series were dubbed this way for television. Only starting in 2008, Disney allowed Bulgarian broadcasters to dub films themselves, and currently all of them use voice-over dubbing.

Jetix Russia was based on this channel, but all things related to Disney were automatically replaced with Jetix promos. Certain shows which currently do not air on the regular Jetix CEE ([[W.I.T.C.H. (TV series)|W.I.T.C.H.]], [[Iggy Arbuckle]]) were part of the hour-and-a-half long programming block that replaces the Disney block.

This version of '''Jetix''' was available in other countries: [[Moldova]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]], [[Ukraine]], [[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Belarus]], [[Republic of Macedonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]] etc.
