'''Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel''' is a high-rise building in [[San Diego]] composed of two towers. The towers are the third and seventh tallest buildings in the city. Developed but no longer owned by the controversial San Diego developer, [[Doug Manchester]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Karger&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=Fred Karger  | title=First Anniversary of Boycott Against Doug Manchester | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/fred-karger/first-anniversary-of-boyc_b_239054.html | work=The Huffington Post | date=July 18, 2009 | accessdate=24 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tower is the tallest building on the waterfront on the West Coast, and with 1,625 rooms, it is [[Southern California]]'s largest hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronicle&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.californiachronicle.com/articles/view/109434 | title=Make a Grand Entrance - Rappel 33 Stories from the Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego | work=The California Chronicle | accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tallest&quot; /&gt; Because of its proximity to the waterfront, as well as its amenities, the Manchester Grand Hyatt is referred to as a spa and [[resort]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Bureau&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sandiego.org/listing/Visitors/2775|title=Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego | publisher=San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description==
The Manchester Grand Hyatt consists of two towers, the 40-story Harbor Tower built in 1992 and the 33-story Seaport Tower which was added in 2003, prompted by the positive response to the space already allocated for private meetings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Business&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-22087866_ITM |title=Expanded Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego now is hotel on Southern California coast| work=Los Angeles Business Journal|accessdate=2009-07-20 | date=2004-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four-story building with a rooftop pool connects the towers to each other. The hotel's 1,625 guest rooms each have partial water or city views, and many offer [[panorama|panoramic]] vistas of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. All rooms are equipped with [[Wi-Fi]] Internet access, and [[iPod]] docking stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;tallest&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.signonsandiego.com/places/manchester-grand-hyatt/ | title=Manchester Grand Hyatt |work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | accessdate=2009-07-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hotel has two bars: the Top of the Hyatt and the Grand Lobby Bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyatt&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://manchestergrand.hyatt.com/hyatt/hotels/entertainment/lounges/index.jsp| title=Lounges/Bars| publisher=Hyatt Corporation| accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third floor holds the hotel pool and the Kin Spa.
===Top of the Hyatt===
The 40th and top floor of the Manchester Grand Hyatt is known as the Top of the Hyatt. Instead of a traditional [[Penthouse apartment|penthouse suite]], former hotel owner Doug Manchester decided to create an upscale bar with panoramic views of [[San Diego]], [[Coronado Island]], and [[Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Union-Tribune&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/feature/495/nye/hotels.html | title=New Year's Eve| work=The Union-Tribune|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bar was awarded the title of &quot;Best Upscale Bar&quot; by ''SignOnSanDiego'', and is considered, &quot;an unparalleled spot from which to watch the sunset.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Convention&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sandiego.org/listing/Visitors/1585 | title=Top of the Hyatt - Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego | publisher=San Diego Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau | accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel.latimes.com/destinations/san-diego/nightlife-spots/top-of-the-hyatt/review |title=San Diego Nightlife Spots | work=The Los Angeles Times | accessdate=2009-07-20 |first=Christopher |last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kin Oasis===
Kin Oasis is the new adult-only pool (ages 21 above) located on the third floor of Harbor Tower. The rooftop pool, described as &quot;upscale&quot;, includes [[bottle service]], [[cabana]] rentals, and hosts large pool parties on holiday weekends in conjunction with [[Fortune Industries]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chinn&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://entertainment.signonsandiego.com/places/kin-lounge/|title=Kin Lounge| last=Chinn |first=Derrik | work=The San Diego Union-Tribune | accessdate=2009-07-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NapkinNights.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sd.napkinnights.com/vd/kin_lounge|title= Kin Lounge| work=NapkinNights|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Location==
The Manchester Grand Hyatt is located on the [[Gaslamp Quarter, San Diego|Gaslamp Quarter]]âs waterfront, a few blocks away from the Gaslamp Quarter, [[Seaport Village]], as well as the [[San Diego Convention Center]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Combined&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotelscombined.com/Hotel/Manchester_Grand_Hyatt_Hotel_San_Diego.htm |title=Manchester Grand Hyatt Hotel San Diego |publisher=Hotels Combined |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[San Diego Trolley]] stops near the hotel which connects to several lines to reach the majority of the San Diego metropolitan area. The hotel is located less than a mile from [[Petco Park]], an [[Amtrak]] train station, and [[Woodbury University]]'s San Diego campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoThere&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arestravel.com/372_hotel-location-info_h100.html |title=Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego |work=GoThere |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposition 8 controversy==
Doug Manchester, chairman of Manchester Financial Group,&lt;ref name=&quot;Doug&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dougmanchester.com/ |title=Papa Doug Manchester |k=Doug Manchester|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; sparked controversy in 2008 when he backed California's [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] with financial support in the amount of $125,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamb&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdcitybeat.com/cms/story/detail/bonnie_vs_the_manchester_hyatt/7772/ |title=Bonnie vs. the Manchester Hyatt |last=Lamb|first=John R. | work=San Diego CityBeat |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money was donated before Proposition 8 was a ballot [[initiative]]. Before a proposition can be officially placed on a ballot for voter consideration, 700,000 signatures need to be gathered. Supporters of the proposition used the $125,000 Manchester donated to pay professionals to acquire signatures in an effort to solidify the initiative's place on the [[ballot]]. When asked about his contribution, Manchester was quoted as saying, &quot;When they say that we cannot say that a marriage is between a man and a woman, that's where I draw the line.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ainsworth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/metro/20080315-9999-1m15samesex.html|title=Developer is foe of same-sex marriage|last=Ainsworth|first=Bill |work=The San Diego Union-Tribune |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Manchester has admitted that he &quot;supports&quot; his employees who are gay and lesbian, he cites the fact that he is [[Catholic]] as a motivation behind his actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot; /&gt; 

===Boycott===
The support caused an immediate response from [[List of LGBT rights organizations|gay-rights organizations]], including [[Gay &amp; Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation|GLAAD]], which canceled all events planned for the hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Doug&quot; /&gt; [[Trade union|Labor unions]], including Hotel Workers Union Local 30, publicly admonished Manchester for his actions, with one member describing Proposition 8 as &quot;pure and simple [[discrimination]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.10news.com/news/16848234/detail.html|title=Gay Rights Leaders Urge Boycott Of Manchester Grand Hyatt|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a [[Protests against Proposition 8 supporters|boycott from Proposition 8 protesters]] quickly followed.&lt;ref name=&quot;CBS8&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbs8.com/Global/story.asp?S=10747593|title=Protestors Plan New Year Of Manchester Boycott|publisher=CBS8|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[boycott]] was originally intended to last one year, but subsequent protests of other Hyatt locations continued after that duration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wockner&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfbaytimes.com/?sec=article&amp;article_id=10525|title=NY Governor Introduces Bill to Legalize Same-Sex Marriage |last=Wockner|first=Rex |work=The San Francisco Bay Times |accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in turn some gay and lesbian employees of the hotel resigned in protest. 

When Manchester was the owner of the Manchester Grand Hyatt, the [[Global Hyatt|Global Hyatt Corporation]] attempted to separate his views from that of the managing corporation. Global Hyatt contended that Manchester did not speak on its behalf and that the corporation has a proven history of supporting [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay and lesbian rights]]. In addition, the Global Hyatt Corporation issued a statement that asserts many Hyatt hotels, including the Manchester Grand Hyatt, offer benefits to [[Domestic partnership|domestic partners]] of employees,&lt;ref name=&quot;Association&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsba.org/conference/hotel/hyatt_update.cfm|title=San Diego Hyatt Update|publisher=National School Boards Association|accessdate=2009-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is optional for businesses. [[Californians Against Hate]], a gay-rights activist group, has estimated that the boycott resulted in a loss of over $7 million, despite Manchester's attempt to reach out to the gay community with room credits and donations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Michaelson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sandiego6.com/news/local/story/Manchester-Grand-Hyatt-Reaches-Out-to-Gay-Groups/yeveNOls6EejuVRdjLvgLg.cspx |title=Manchester Grand Hyatt Reaches Out to Gay Groups; Boycott Continues |last=Michaelson |first=Elex | work=San Diego 6 |accessdate=2009-07-20}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Marketing management|marketing manager]] for the hotel, Kelly Commerford, has confirmed that cancellations resulting directly from the protest cost the hotel $2.4 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sdbj.com/industry_article.asp?aID=77915344.420788.1719497.2939526.5791829.446&amp;aID2=132260 |title=Union Local Fears Loss of Jobs If Grand Hyatt Is Sold |last=Lewis |first=Connie | work=San Diego Business Journal |accessdate=2009-07-29}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This figure does not include estimates for those who choose other accommodations due to the boycott. The developer, Manchester, claimed that the boycotting unions are using gay marriage support as a screen &quot;to cover [their] real goal of organizing&quot; the hotel's workers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis&quot;/&gt;

The hotel was sold near the end of May 2011 to Host Hotels and Resorts, thus severing Manchester's financial ties to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/news/2011/03/24/host-hotels-resorts-closes-on.html | date=2011-03-24 | first=Tucker | last=Echols | title=Host Hotels &amp; Resorts closes on Manchester Grand Hyatt San Diego and New York Helmsley Hotel acquisitions}}&lt;/ref&gt;
