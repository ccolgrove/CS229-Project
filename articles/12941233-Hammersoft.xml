The '''Hawthorn Football Club''', nicknamed the '''Hawks''', is a professional [[Australian rules football]] club in the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL). The club, founded in 1902, is the youngest of the [[Victoria, Australia|Victorian]]-based teams in the [[Australian Football League|AFL]]. The team play in ''Brown &amp; Gold'' vertically striped [[guernsey (clothing)|guernseys]]. The club's motto is ''[[spectemur agendo]]'', loosely translating to &quot;let us be judged by our acts&quot;.

Statistically, Hawthorn is the most successful club in the modern era, having won a Premiership in each of the last five decades with a total of 10 Premierships in 50 years, including the 2008 Premiership and playing in seven consecutive [[AFL Grand Final]]s between 1983 and 1989, a VFL/AFL record. 

The Hawks' origins are in the inner-eastern Melbourne suburb of [[Hawthorn, Victoria|Hawthorn]] and also at [[Glenferrie Oval]], the club's former administrative and training base and social club. Matches, however, have not been played there since 1973. In 2006, Hawthorn's training and administration facilties were relocated to [[Waverley Park]] in the middle of the club's major supporter base in Melbourne's outer-eastern region. Since 2007 Hawthorn have played four games a year at their second ground of [[York Park]] in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]], Tasmania with the remaining games played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], the club's current playing [[home ground]]. Hawthorn's current [[Victorian Football League]] (VFL) affiliate team is the [[Box Hill Hawks Football Club]].

==Club history==
{{Ref improve section|date=July 2010}}

===Obscure and disputed origins===
The origins of the Hawthorn Football Club are obscure â very few records were kept and the early history is subject to interpretation, embellishment and [[Historical revisionism (negationism)|historical revisionism]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

The official club history books and many supporters strongly believe that the club's origins date back to its founding in 1873 at a meeting at the Hawthorne Hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;THW&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gordon|first=Harry|title=The Hard Way â Story of the Hawthorn Football Club|isbn=0949853429}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although a Hawthorn Football Club did indeed form at this time â and the region has since continuously been represented by a football team â it was not the Hawthorn which competes at AFL level today. It is likely that today's club is actually the third club to carry the name &quot;Hawthorn Football Club&quot;. In ''The Daily Telegraph'' of 12 May 1883 it is stated that &quot;The Hawthorn Club having disbanded, all engagements for the ensuing season have been cancelled.&quot;  In 1889 the Riversdale Football Club (formed in 1880) is reported to have changed its name to the Hawthorn Football Club.  This club also ceased in 1890. No Hawthorn club existed from 1890 to 1892.

A new representative club, called the &quot;Hawthorn Football Club&quot;, was formed in 1893.  It competed in the Victorian Jnr. Football Association until 1898. Without a ground to play on, however, the club was disbanded in 1899.

===Modern club founded===
In April 1902, Alf Kosky formed a club from the various district clubs under the banner of Hawthorn Football Club to compete in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Gordon| last=Harry| coauthor=Gordon, Michael| title=One For All-The Story of the Hawthorn Football Club| publisher=Wilkinson Publishing| location=Melbourne, Victoria| year=2009| isbn=978-1-921332-83-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club merged with Boroondara in 1905, and in 1912, Hawthorn merged with successful junior club the Hawthorn Rovers to form the Hawthorn City Football Club to become part of a successful council push to have a club in the prestigious [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA).

===VFA years: 1914â1924===
The first task for the club was to decide on club colours, their jumper of blue and gold was already taken by Williamstown so a change was required. At a Special General Meeting held on 17 February 1914, a Mr J. Brain proposed brown and gold as the new colours and the motion was carried.

The Mayblooms won three games and a draw in their first season in the VFA. The effect of World War I with players enlisting caused the club to finish last in 1915. The VFA then went into recess for the duration of the war.

When the competition resumed in 1919 the club was more competitive winning eight games and finishing sixth out of ten clubs.

Hawthorn dropped to eighth in 1920 and from then on won more games than they lost. 1921 they won 9 games and finished sixth.

In 1922 the club missed the finals by percentage and Hawthorn set a new record score in the VFA scoring 30.31.211 to Prahran 6.9.45.

In 1923 the club made the finals finishing in fourth place and then losing to Port Melbourne in the first semi-final.

1924 the club finished fifth, missing the finals by four points.

===Entry to the VFL===
Since 1919 the [[Australian Football League|VFL]] had nine clubs which caused one team to be idle every Saturday, the VFL was keen to do away with a bye each week. In 1924 a group calling itself the Hawthorn Citizens' League Campaign Committee began gathering support for the football club admittance to the VFL. Other representations came from Brighton, Brunswick, Footscray, North Melbourne, Prahran, Camberwell and Caulfield.

On the night of 9 January 1925 a committee meeting of the VFL, chaired by Reg Hunt of  [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], decided to expand the competition from nine clubs to twelve. It was decided in the meeting to admit the &quot;Hawthorn Football Club&quot;, along with [[Footscray Football Club|Footscray]] and [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]], all three coming from the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA). Hunt originally recommended Hawthorn, Footscray and Prahran but eventually North Melbourne was substituted for Prahran because of ground control matters.

The '''Mayblooms''', as they were known then became the perennial whipping boys of the competition. They had an almost casual attitude towards playing football and were not able to even pay their players the match payment then allowed by the Coulter Law. Despite the presence of a number players of true class such as [[Bert Hyde]], [[Bert Mills]], [[Stan Spinks]], [[Alec Albiston]] and [[Col Austen]], Hawthorn in the first seventeen years never won more than seven games in a season.

===Steady incline: 1940sâ50s===
[[Roy Cazaly]] was the non-playing coach of Hawthorn in 1942, he was reported to have given the club its nickname the '''&quot;Hawks&quot;''' on the suggestion of one of his daughters. Cazaly thought that it was tougher than their original nickname the '''&quot;Mayblooms&quot;''' and 1943 turned out to be the club's best season since joining the VFL in which the club missed the finals only by percentage. However, Hawthorn immediately returned to the bottom of the ladder, consistently competing with [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] for the wooden spoon. Between 1944 and 1953 the club finished last or second last in every year but one.

Half back franker [[Col Austen]] tied with [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne's]] [[Ron Clegg]] for the 1949 [[Brownlow Medal]] but was not awarded it based on the 'countback' system in place at that time.  The [[VFL/AFL|League]] later changed the system for tied results and, in 1989, he was awarded the medal retrospectively.

[[File:Col Austen.jpg|100px|thumb|left|Brownlow Medallist

[[File:Alec Albiston.jpg|150px|thumb|Captain coach 1947â1949, Albiston was one of the characters of the clubs most bitter internal fight]]

1950 started with the club in turmoil, The club appointed [[Bob McCaskill]] as coach and he wanted  [[Kevin Curran (footballer)|Kevin Curran]] to be captain. Outgoing captain-coach [[Alec Albiston]] was angry as he was told by a member of the board that he remain as captain. Brownlow Medallist [[Col Austen]] sided with Albiston and a split occurred. The board sided with the new coach and gave Albiston and Austen open clearances.

===1950s===
Losing the club's best two players 
the team did not win a match in 1950. New captain Kevin Curran was suspended for striking Austen on the first occasion Hawthorn and Austen's new club Richmond played.

The Club also decided to change it's player jumper to the Brown and gold vertical stripes. 

Two positives were the arrival of [[Roy Simmonds]] and [[John Kennedy, Sr.|John Kennedy]] . Over the next ten years, John Kennedy played 169 games for Hawthorn, serving as Captain from 1955 until his retirement, and winning the club's Best and Fairest award four times (in 1950, 51, 52 and 54). Simmonds would play 192 games and win the club's Best and Fairest award in 1955.

Failing health to [[Bob McCaskill]] meant that his assistant, [[Jack Hale]] took over as coach, it was the decisive step in the movement of Hawthorn away from the bottom of the ladder. He eliminated the casual attitude that prevailed at the club during its first thirty years in the VFL and made the club less accepting of defeat than before. Although Hawthorn finished last in 1953, from the following year improvement was steady.

Hawthorn had their first recruitment coup in 1954 by signing Clayton &quot;Candles&quot; Thompson from South Australia. Thompson was the glamour player from the 1953 National Football Championships, kicking ten goals against Western Australia. Fresh from school, teenagers [[John Peck (Australian rules footballer)|John Peck]], Alan Woodley, Noel Voigt and Brain Kann started at Hawthorn and the club won eight games. Gifted schoolboy from [[Sandhurst Football Club|Sandhurst]], [[Graham Arthur]], arrived in 1955 and became the second player to win the club's Best and Fairest in his first year, the other being [[John Kennedy, Sr.|John Kennedy]]. [[Brendan Edwards]] followed Arthur to Hawthorn in 1956 and, although the seniors showed a slight decline to seven wins and a draw, the reserve grade side gave them their first finals appearance in any grade.

====First finals appearance====
1957 the senior team broke through for their first finals appearance, defeating Carlton in the 1st Semi Final long remembered for the freak hailstorm after half-time. They were outclassed by Melbourne in the preliminary final in a year when [[Cyril Collard (footballer)|Cyril Collard]] became the first [[indigenous Australian]] to play for Hawthorn.

===Turnaround: 1961â1982===
{{Cquote|It was a great thing for people who had followed the club through all the bad years.

[[File:John Kennedy Sr. statue in front of Waverly Park.jpg|thumb|[[John Kennedy, Sr.]] is the Hawks' first premiership coach. His son, [[John Kennedy, Jr. (Australian rules footballer)|John Kennedy, Jr.]], would later be a multiple-premiership player with his father's club. [[Josh Kennedy (Hawthorn)|Josh Kennedy]], would be the club's first third-generation player. Hawthorn honoured their first premiership coach with a bronze statue in front of [[Waverly Park]]]]

After three seasons in mid-table Hawthorn appointed [[John Kennedy, Sr.|John Kennedy]] as coach in 1960. Kennedy and 1960 Club Champion [[Brendan Edwards]] believed that footballers were not fit enough so a training regime was implemented. [[John Winneke]], [[Phil Hay]], [[Malcolm Hill]], [[Morton Browne]], [[Ian Mort]] and [[Ian Law]] made their debuts in 1960.  Kennedy took the Hawks further than ever before in 1961, winning their first premiership by defeating [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]]. Brendan Edwards was acknowledged as the star of this win.

However, Hawthorn fell right back in 1962 winning only five games and finishing in ninth position on the ladder. In 1963 the club finished on top of the ladder only to lose the grand final to Geelong by 49 points. Kennedy accepted a position as Principal of Stawell High School so [[Graham Arthur]] became captain-coach in 1964. The Hawks lost the last game of the season and dropped to fifth, had they had won they would have finished on top of the ladder. They fell to be last in 1965 with only four wins. They rebuilt the team for the rest of the 1960s with [[Peter Hudson]] joining them in 1967 and immediately became the competition's best full-forward. In 1968 he kicked 125 goals the first centurion since John Coleman, and again in 1969 with 120 goals. Despite this, Hawthorn still failed to make the finals, but the acquisition of the powerful Mornington Peninsula [[zoning (Australian rules football)|recruiting zone]] gave the club a huge boost in its quest for success and permitted the club a much more powerful list then ever before. 1969 saw the recruitment of two teenagers [[Peter Knights]] and [[Leigh Matthews]].

Hawthorn started the 1970s missing the finals even though [[Peter Hudson]] kicked a home-and-away record of 146 goals in 1970. The team's spine was strengthened with the arrival of full back [[Kelvin Moore]] and centre half-forward [[Alan Martello]].

[[File:Leigh matthews statue.jpg|150px|thumb|left|Statue of former Hawthorn player, Leigh Matthews at the Melbourne Cricket Ground]]
In 1971 the Hawks finished on top of the ladder, the first time since 1963, [[Peter Hudson]] equalled [[Bob Pratt]]s record of 150 goals in a season and [[Leigh Matthews]] gain notoriety by shirtfronting [[Barry Cable]] in an Interstate Game in Perth.

The [[1971 VFL Grand Final|1971 Grand Final]] was between Hawthorn (coached by Hawthorn legend [[John Kennedy, Sr.|John Kennedy]]) and [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] coached by [[Allan Jeans]] who would later move to Hawthorn and enjoy success as the Hawks coach in the 1980s. The match was played before 118,192 people at the [[MCG]] on a fine and sunny Melbourne day. Hawthorn went into the match without inspirational centre half back [[Peter Knights]] who had suffered a severe knee injury two weeks earlier.  It was a hard and tough game was played out with the Saints leading the Hawks by 20 points going into the last quarter. Hawks 5.7 (37) to the Saints 8.9 (57).  For the Saints however, as coach [[Allan Jeans]] was to comment, &quot;The season was just 25 minutes too long&quot;.  &quot;Kennedy's Commando's&quot; (the term given to the team after the coach's tough physical training program and loudly proclaimed in the huge banners that swept around the [[MCG]] (now sadly replaced by advertising signs) came into force. The Hawks moved [[Peter Hudson]] out to centre half-forward and [[Bob Keddie]] into the goal square.  The Hawks slammed on seven goals to three in that final quarter, with Keddie kicking four, to run out winners (12.10.82) to the Saints (11.9.75).  The final term saw ten goals being scored.

A skinny lad from Berwick made his debut in 1972. [[Michael Tuck]] played the first of a record 426 games after Hawthorn lost champion full forward Peter Hudson to a knee injury in the first game of the year, who had kicked 8 goals before being injured before half-time. [[John Hendrie (footballer)|John Hendrie]] whose grandfather played in Hawthorn's the first VFL game played the first of 197 games for the club.

During the 1970s a strong rivalry grew with [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and they met in three grand finals with the Hawks prevailing twice. The [[1976 VFL Grand Final|1976 Grand Final]] team was inspired by the illness of former Captain [[Peter Crimmins]] who died 3 days after the victory from cancer, and by the humiliating defeat of the [[1975 VFL Grand Final|1975 Grand Final]] loss to the North Melbourne Kangaroos. The Hawks greats such as the prolific goal-kicker [[Michael Moncrieff]], rover [[Leigh Matthews]], ruck rover Michael Tuck, ruckman [[Don Scott (footballer)|Don Scott]], full back Kelvin Moore and centre half-back [[Peter Knights]] played through this era. The Hawthorn North Melbourne clash was a close encounter, but injuries to champions such as Keith Greig and Brent Crosswell made North's chances of winning difficult. However, when Hawthorn looked threatened, they replied quickly and kept their lead intact. The forward line won the day and as a result it was not surprising that [[John Hendrie (footballer)|John Hendrie]] was voted best on ground by radio and newspapers of the day.

After the disappointment of losing to North Melbourne in the 1977 Preliminary Final, the Hawks were back to play in the [[1978 VFL Grand Final|1978 Grand Final]], again against North Melbourne. It was the third time in four seasons that these two sides were to meet in a grand final. North Melbourne were competing in their fifth successive grand final and were the reigning premiers. At half-time North Melbourne led by four points but Hawthorn finished victors by three goals thanks largely to a strong third quarter which saw them kick 7.6. The turning point occurred when two North players spoiled each other in the goalsquare at the 6-minute mark, when a mark and a goal could have put them 17 points up. The Hawks went on to dominate play after this incident and never looked back. The finals scores were Hawthorn (18.13 (121) defeated North Melbourne (15.13 (103).

===Glory years: 1983â1991===
====7 straight: 1983â1989====
[[File:Stoppage in an AFL game.jpg|thumb|The Hawthorn-Essendon bitter rivalry started in the 1980s, when the two clubs met in three successive grand finals (2007)]]
Their greatest era was undoubtedly the 1980s, where the team won four premierships and played in the grand final seven years in succession, including three in a row against arch-enemy [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. The decade started poorly, with Hawthorn failing to finish in the top five (as it was then known) and seen by most critics as a spent force. Coach [[David Parkin]] left and agreed to coach [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] and captain [[Don Scott (footballer)|Don Scott]] would shortly retire after playing his 300th game. In a surprise apppointment Hawthorn persuaded former [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] premiership coach [[Allan Jeans]] to coach the team. Jeans had not coached in the VFL for five years.

1982 would mark the start of Hawthorn being in the finals for 13 years in a row. Hawthorn returned to finals football in 1982, finishing second after the home and away season, Hawthorn fans saw Subiaco champion [[Gary Buckenara]] for the first time and also a cameo appearance of [[Gary Ablett, Sr.|Gary Ablett]] in a Hawthorn jumper and [[Dermot Brereton]] who was a skinny kid from Frankston made his debut in the semi final against North Melbourne and kicked five goals. Hawthorn lost the Preliminary Final to Carlton by 31 points.

The first of four premierships for the decade was in the [[1983 VFL Grand Final|1983 Grand Final]], with Hawthorn 20.20 (140) defeating Essendon 8.9 (57) This was at that time a record margin in a grand final; signifying the juggernaut that Hawthorn was to become during the 1980s. Hawthorn competed in the next two grand finals against rival Essendon, losing in [[1984 VFL Grand Final|1984 Grand Final]] due to Essendon's famous final quarter charge, and losing again in [[1985 VFL Grand Final|1985 Grand Final]] by a far greater margin; souring the final game of club legend Leigh Matthews. Playing along side him was young [[Jason Dunstall]], from [[Coorparoo, Queensland|Coorparoo]], Queensland, he was recruited after winning the QAFL goalkicking in 1984.

The 1985 Grand Final marked the end of Essendon's success during the 1980s, but did not for Hawthorn. Their second premiership came the following year in the [[1986 VFL Grand Final|1986 Grand Final]], with Hawthorn 16.14 (110) defeating Carlton 9.14 (68) convincingly, with [[Gary Ayres]] winning his first of two Norm Smith Medals. 1987 saw Hawthorn finish second to a superior Carlton team. The fact that Hawthorn even made it to the grand final is still the centre of some controversy; with Garry Buckenara's after the siren kick in the 1987 Preliminary Final breaking the hearts of tens of thousands of [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] supporters. Ill health to coach [[Allan Jeans]] meant that Football Operations Manager [[Alan Joyce]] took the coaching position for 1988. The Hawks lost only 3 games for the year; [[Jason Dunstall]] kicked 132 goals and the team would win the [[1988 VFL Grand Final|1988 Premiership]] 22.20 (152) against Melbourne 6.20 (56); a then record margin in a Grand Final of 96 points. [[Gary Ayres]] won his second Norm Smith Medal.

The 1989 season was viewed as one of the most spectacular VFL/AFL seasons to date; with Dunstall again kicking a century of goals, the resurgence of [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] and dominating play of Geelong great [[Gary Ablett Sr.]], and  [[1989 VFL Grand Final|the greatest Grand Final]] of the modern era occurring in this year.

The Hawks defeated Geelong in the 1989 Grand Final. The match is now legendary for its amazing toughness, physicality, skill, massive scoring and tension. The Hawks jumped out to an enormous lead as Geelong attempted to unsettle the Hawks through rough physical play. However the physical toll on the Hawks began to show as the match wore on; with John Platten being concussed, Robert DiPierdomenico puncturing his lung, Dermott Brereton breaking his ribs and Michael Tuck splitting the webbing on his hand.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lovett|2010|p=837}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By midway through the final quarter the Cats were charging; with Hawthorn desperately trying to hold off the Cat's avalanche of goals while containing the brilliance of Ablett who ended the match with a grand final record of 9 goals. Hawthorn's experience and determination allowed them to hold off Geelong just long enough, scraping through to victory by one goal. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Whateley| first=Gerard| title=The sweet agony of brave, gallant, heroic defeat| publisher=ABC Sport |date=28 July 2006| url=http://www.abc.net.au/sport/features/2006/s1699513.htm?afl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Too old. Too slow. Too good: 1990â1991====

The fast-paced style of Hawthorn's play was copied by the [[West Coast Eagles]] who became the powerful club of the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}. Other clubs have had success since but none have matched the dominance of the Hawks in this period, who ended the 1980s having played in a record seven successive grand finals. Leading players of the 1980s included [[Dermott Brereton]], Gary Ayres, [[Chris Mew]], [[Michael Tuck]], [[Jason Dunstall]], [[Gary Buckenara]], [[John Platten]] and [[Chris Langford]].

The Hawks ended their era of dominance which included eight grand final appearances in nine seasons (1983â1991). Injuries to key personnel hampered Hawthorns 1990 campaign. [[Jason Dunstall]] and [[Dermott Brereton]] both missed many games, others like [[Robert DiPierdomenico]] carried injuries into the finals. The Hawks bowed out in the Elimination Final to Melbourne. [[Alan Joyce]] replaced [[Allan Jeans]] as coach for the 1991 season and the Hawks subsequently won the pre-season cup. The club recruited skillful South Australian [[Darren Jarman]] and with improvement from young players, such as [[Paul Hudson (Australian rules footballer)|Paul Hudson]], [[Ben Allan]] and [[Stephen Lawrence (footballer)|Stephen Lawrence]] the team made the 1991 Grand Final.

Grand Final Day 1991 was an historic occasion. It was the only grand final played at [[Waverley Park]] and featured the first ever appearance by a non-Victorian team. West Coast had dominated the home and away season but Hawthorn, written off by many early in the season, had slowly gathered momentum and had stunned the Eagles by winning the first grand final played outside the Melbourne Cricket Ground since 1945. West Coast began the match kicking with the aid of a strong wind blowing down to the main scoreboard end and kicked the opening four goals. However, from that point the Hawks began to gain the ascendancy and, if not for inaccuracy in front of goal in the second term, they would have had a significant half-time lead. Having maintained the half-time margin, against the wind, in the third term, the Hawks slammed on 8.4 (52) to 1.3 (9) in the final quarter, to win a fifth premiership in nine seasons. A feature of the Hawksâ performance was that its two best playersâPaul Dear and Stephen Lawrenceâwere from the teamâs younger brigade. It was to be Michael Tuckâs last game and he bowed out with the League record for games (426), finals (39), grand finals (11) and premierships (7). At the end of 1991, Hawthorn selected a young [[Shane Crawford]] with pick 13 in the National Draft, who eventually became the only surviving link between this era of success and its next triumph 17 seasons later. During the 1992 summer, the Hawthorn players' T-shirts had &quot;Too old. Too slow. Too good&quot; written on them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Cash|first=Damien|title=The Clubs|publisher=Penguin Books Australia Ltd|page=227|isbn=0-670-87858-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===End of an era: 1992â96===
In 1992 the club moved its home games to [[Waverley Park]] in [[Mulgrave, Victoria|Mulgrave]] in Melbourne's south-east after previously sharing [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]] with [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]]. To further strengthen their links with the area a second social club was established nearby at the Waverley Gardens shopping centre. The club, which operates as a gaming venue, has also been a lucrative source of revenue for the club.

The end of the 1993 season saw the first cracks in the Family Club facade; coach [[Alan Joyce]] was replaced by [[Peter Knights]] and club legends Gary Ayres and Dermott Brereton departed. [[Chris Mew]] injured his achilles tendon and retired. Loss of key players continued, [[Ben Allan]] was offered the captaincy of the new [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] and left at the end of 1994, as did [[Andrew Gowers]], who went to [[Brisbane Bears|Brisbane]].

After a promising start in 1995 the Hawks lost their last seven games to finish 15th and missed the finals for the first time since 1981. The board sacked the coaching staff and appointed [[Ken Judge]] who was an assistant to David Parkin at Carlton. Club Champion Darren Jarman told the club he wanted to return to Adelaide. 

====Proposed merger====
{{Main|Melbourne Hawks}}
Falling on-field and off-field fortune saw the club almost merge with [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in 1996. The resulting club was to be known as the &quot;[[Melbourne Hawks]]&quot; â a fusion with the Melbourne nickname of &quot;Demons&quot;. A groundswell of support led by former champion [[Don Scott (footballer)|Don Scott]] scuttled the proposal, with Hawthorn members voting strongly against it. Melbourne members supported the merger by a small margin. The failure of the merger led to the resignation of the board and its replacement, led by businessman Ian Dicker.

After fighting off the merger the new board launched the &quot;Proud, Passionate and Paid Up&quot; campaign in a bid to get more members. 27,450 memberships were bought by supporters, more than doubling the memberships from the previous year. Even in the successful days of the 1980s the club struggled to get 10,000 members. The team won the 1999 pre-season competition but missed out on the finals of the premiership season.

===1997â2003===
[[Peter Schwab]] was appointed coach of the Hawks for the 2000 season and the team played a more attacking style than the &quot;accountable football&quot; discipline of [[Ken Judge]]. The Hawks reached the semi-finals before losing to the reigning premiers, the [[North Melbourne Football Club]]. The team made steady progress all over the field. [[Daniel Chick]] and [[Nick Holland]] were the joint winners of the Peter Crimmins Medal. [[Chance Bateman]] became the second [[Indigenous Australian]] to play for Hawthorn.

In 2001 the Hawks again enjoyed a successful year, but it was to be their last for several seasons. The Hawks won eight games straight at the start of the season and, despite faltering in the middle part of the year, had a close win in a semi-final against [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]] and made it to the preliminary finals in when they narrowly lost to [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]]. In the off-season, Hawthorn traded [[Trent Croad]] and  [[Luke McPharlin]] for the Number 1 draft pick, [[Luke Hodge]], No. 20 (Daniel Elstone) and No. 36 ([[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]]). In retrospect, the Hawks are seen{{who|date=November 2010}} to have won this trade. [[Trent Croad]] would, ironically, return to Hawthorn two years later.

The Hawks missed the finals altogether in 2002, finishing 10th, which was considered to be a very disappointing result for the club. Shane Crawford won the [[Peter Crimmins Medal]] after another strong season. Players that made their debuts that year, [[Luke Hodge]], [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]], [[Campbell Brown (footballer)|Campbell Brown]], [[Robert Campbell (Australian rules footballer)|Robert Campbell]] and [[Mark L. Williams]] would all play in the 2008 premiership side. In the off-season, the Hawks again proved to be big players and gained the services of St Kilda ruckman [[Peter Everitt]].

After a poor start to the 2003 season, the Hawks went on to finish the second half of the year strongly and finished in 9th place, narrowly missing the finals. [[Sam Mitchell (footballer)|Sam Mitchell]] shone for the Hawks and won the [[AFL Rising Star]] award. This form had punters excited and the team were early favourites for a top four finish the next year. [[Shane Crawford]] once again won the Peter Crimmins Medal and also came second in the [[Brownlow Medal]] by a single vote.

During the 2004 pre-season Hawthorn coach Peter Schwab declared that the Hawks would &quot;win the premiership&quot; although this statement would be followed by a horrific season for Hawthorn as the Hawks managed just 4 wins and 18 losses. The club imploded, and by mid-season coach [[Peter Schwab]] was sacked, and Captain [[Shane Crawford]] broke his arm, and eventually relinquished the captaincy. Following the collapse of the club on the field, many players either left or were sacked from the club. [[Nathan Thompson]] left the club citing a fresh start following his admission that he suffered from depression. [[Rayden Tallis]], [[Mark Graham (footballer)|Mark Graham]], [[Kris Barlow]] and [[Lance Picioane]] were also released from the club. More than 700 games of experience left the club following the season.

===New coach, changing times: 2004âpresent===
{{Main|Hawthorn Football Club season 2007|l1=Hawthorn Football Club seasons 2007|Hawthorn Football Club season 2008|l2=2008|Hawthorn Football Club season 2009|l3=2009|Hawthorn Football Club season 2010|l4=2010|Hawthorn Football Club season 2011|15=2011}}

[[File:Hawthorn banner.jpg|thumb|Hawks players run through the banner in a 2007 Semi Final against the Kangaroos, led by then captain Richard Vandenberg in his final game.]]
[[Alastair Clarkson]] was appointed coach before the conclusion of the 2004 season and promptly delisted many players who were either underperforming or not fitting in with his youth policy which he embarked on to rebuild the club. The Hawks took [[Jarryd Roughead]], [[Lance Franklin]], [[Jordan Lewis]] at picks 2, 5 and 7 respectively in the [[AFL Draft]]. Former Hawk [[Trent Croad]] who had played for the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] for 2 years returned to his former side on exchange for draft selection No.10 Ryley Dunn before the 2004 season.

With Clarkson at the helm, the Hawks made solid progress, and instituted a culture of discipline at the club. The Hawks won only 5 games and played a widely criticised high-possession game plan and finished in 14th position. Hawks fans still deemed it to be a somewhat successful season. [[Lance Franklin]], [[Jarryd Roughead]] and [[Jordan Lewis]] all won [[AFL Rising Star|Rising Star]] Nominations. [[Shane Crawford]] also had a return to form after a terrible 2004 when he broke his arm, and finished 3rd in the [[Peter Crimmins Medal]] tally. The Hawks received [[Xavier Ellis]] with pick 3, and [[Beau Dowler]] with pick 6, from finishing 14th. List manager Chris Pelchen also traded the clubs 2001 All-Australian full-back Jonathan Hay to [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and Nathan Lonie to [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]]. In return the club got pick no. 14 [[Grant Birchall]] and pick 18 [[Max Bailey]]. The club had a record 5 picks inside 22 with [[Beau Muston]] rounding out the 5 players. Ellis and Birchall went on to play an integral part in the clubs 10th premiership in 2008.
[[File:J.kennett.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Jeff Kennett]] 2005-2011 President of the Hawks]]

The success story of the year was former no. 1 Draft Pick [[Luke Hodge]], who became a super-star off half-back, winning the [[Peter Crimmins Medal]], [[All-Australian team|All-Australian]] jumper and coming equal 4th in the [[Brownlow Medal]], collecting 15 votes. [[Peter Everitt]] and [[Trent Croad]] were also named in the All-Australian team.

After numerous years of planning, the club relocated its administrative headquarters from [[Glenferrie Oval]] to a [[State of the art|state-of-the-art]] redeveloped facility at [[Waverley Park]] in the early stages of 2006. Glenferrie Oval was to remain the spiritual home of the club.
[[File:AFL Grand Final 2008 Hawthorn Banner.jpg|thumb|The Hawks ran out onto the MCG on Grand Final Day in 2008, with the banner saying: ''Endurance'', ''Mateship'', ''Courage'', ''Sacrifice'']]

In 2006, after a flying start, with a win/loss ratio of 4â1  after the first 5 rounds, the Hawks faltered and fell to a 6-game losing streak before breaking the drought against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]] in round 12, when [[Lance Franklin]] booted 6 goals. A further 6 game losing streak ensued, before another 6 goal burst from &quot;Buddy&quot; in round 19 against [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] was the spark to a final 4 game winning streak, which helped the Hawks leap frog [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide]], the [[North Melbourne Football Club|Kangaroos]], and [[Brisbane Lions|Brisbane]] to finish the year in 11th place.

Hawthorn's progress up the ladder, developing youth, and attacking style of play saw coach Alastair Clarkson rewarded with a new 2-year contract after the mid-season break.

At the end of the 2006 season, the Hawks increased their commitment to the Tasmanian market â where they have developed a large support base â with 4 games to be played at [[York Park|Aurora Stadium]] in [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launcston]], involving the [[Government of Tasmania|Tasmanian Government]] becoming an official sponsor of the club, in one of the biggest sponsorship deals in Australian sporting history,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportal.com.au/football.asp?i=news&amp;id=87626]&lt;/ref&gt; worth $15â20&amp;nbsp;million dollars.

In 2007 the club spent most of the time in the top three during the home and away season, but late season losses to Port Adelaide and Sydney saw the Hawks finish in 5th position. A come from behind win against Adelaide in the Elimination Final in which Lance Franklin kicked his seventh goal seconds from the final siren overshadowed a disappointing loss the following week against the North Melbourne Football Club. The club recorded its 11th consecutive year-end profit at the close of the 2007 season, a record [[Australian dollar|A$]]3.6&amp;nbsp;million.

2008 saw Hawthorn play a brand of football described by many as &quot;unsociable&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Unsociable Hawks are now a pushover | publisher=Adelaide Now| date=2/5/10| url=http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/sport/afl/unsociable-hawks-are-now-a-pushover/story-e6freck3-1225861360215| accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they won of their first premiership since 1991, defeating [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]] 18.7 (115) to 11.23 (89) in the Grand Final. This took place on Saturday 27 September 2008 at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG). During the second quarter Trent Croad suffered a serious foot injury and was on crutches for the rest of the game. Luke Hodge won the Norm Smith Medal, overcoming a serious rib injury inflicted upon him during the Preliminary Final match against St Kilda. Mark Williams was the leading goalkicker on the day with 3 goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Hawks upset Cats 115â89 to claim flag |publisher=The Sydney Mornign Herald|date=27 September 2008|url=http://news.smh.com.au/sport/hawks-upset-cats-11589-to-claim-flag-20080927-4p2p.html|accessdate=23 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2008 Grand Final would become the last game for Trent Croad and Shane Crawford in their AFL careers. Croad's foot injury kept him out of the following season; and Crawford, after 305 games spanned over 15 years, announced his retirement in the few months after the premiership..

In 2009 Hawthorn had a bad season with injuries to several top players, who missed considerable number of games throughout the season. The club did not make the finals, however the club's chances of finals were not extinguished until the last few matches with a late season charge fading in the last couple of games.

The Hawks had a terrible start to season 2010, losing six of their first seven matches, before launching a mid-season revival sparked by their narrow Round 7 loss to eventual wooden spooners the [[West Coast Eagles]] in Perth. Only three losses and a draw followed, and it was enough for them to make the finals, finishing seventh and drawing an away final against the [[Fremantle Football Club|Fremantle Dockers]] in Perth. Inaccurate kicking cost them in a 30-point loss which ended their season. Hawthorn had beaten a second-string Fremantle by 116 points just the fortnight before, but when it came to the finals, their opposition were stronger and more refreshed.

2011 saw Hawthorn finish the home and away season in third spot. It lost to Collingwood by 3 points in a preliminary final. In a reasonably unheralded season Hawthorn won 18 games. Lance Franklin won the Coleman Medal and an All Australian guernsey. Josh Gibson, Sam Mitchell and Grant Birchall were all nominated for All Australian positions, with Sam Mitchell being selected as the Centre.

==Club symbols==
===Logo, crest and mascot===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}

The Hawthorn FC has had four VFL/AFL endorsed logos in its entirety. The first (1977), a flying Hawk, was an adaptation of a pre-existing unofficial logo that appeared on the club's official documentation throughout the 1960s and 1970s. The Hawks's Mascot Manor representative and club mascot is Hudson &quot;Hawka&quot; Knights, a caricature of a hawk dressed the same way as the Hawthorn players and slightly depicting club champion [[Dermott Brereton]].
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|- style=&quot;background:#bdb76b;&quot;
! style=&quot;width:750px;&quot;|Logo
|-
|[[File:Originalhfclogo.png|thumb|left|80px|Original logo]] Hawthorn's first logo was introduced in 1977. It was a predominantly gold shield featuring the 'Flying Hawk' emblazoned across the face, with a brown football with the letters &quot;HFC&quot; in its talons. The first edition of this shield, like all other VFL logos at the time, had a royal blue border around the text section, but it no longer became compulsory and in 1980 a full brown border was brought in.
|-
| [[File:Hawthorn80s.png|thumb|left|80px|1980s shield]] In 1982, however, on the back of large scale marketing drive, &quot;The new force of the 80s&quot;, the club adopted the famous &quot;Hawk Head&quot; created by a Swinburne Institute student. It is still closely linked to the club 10 years after being replaced. The Hawk Head was a popular choice amongst Hawthorn FC supporters as the club had five Premierships, eight Grand Finals and 14 finals appearances during its 15 years at the club.
|-
| [[File:2006 AFL Hawthorn.jpg|thumb|80px|left|1997â2007]] On the back of the failed 1996 proposed merger of Hawthorn with the [[Melbourne Football Club]], Hawthorn, under Ian Dicker, looked to a new banner for a change of fortunes in 1997. The &quot;New Hawks&quot; adopted a modernistic version of the pre-existing &quot;Flying Hawk&quot; and was launched with the infamous &quot;Proud, Passionate and Paid Up&quot; membership drive in 1997. The new logo was successful in drumming up support for the Hawks, as the club went from one of the lowest supported clubs to being the first club in Victoria to attract more than 30,000 members in the space of only two years. Since then the club has successfully retained a consistent level of support despite struggles on the field.
|-
| [[File:Hawthorn-football-club-brand.svg|thumb|80px|left|2008âpresent]] On Saturday, 6 October 2007, club President Jeff Kennett, launched the club's fourth logo in 30 years at a function at Crown Casino.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawthornfc.com.au/Season2007/News/NewsArticle/tabid/4742/Default.aspx?newsId=52230 Official AFL Website of the Hawthorn Football Club &gt; News Article &gt; President unveils new logo at awards dinner&lt;!--- Bot generated title ---&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The new logo, which has striking similarities to the Hawk Head of the '80s and '90s was a project of Cato Purnell Partners. In describing the logo, Cato has made reference to the eye and beak of the Hawk representing the &quot;determination, pride and focus&quot; of Hawthorn.

===Club guernsey===
The Hawthorn colours are ''Brown &amp; Gold'' vertical stripes. Hawthorn has worn this design since 1950. The current major sponsors of the team are [[Tasmania]], [[HSBC]], [[Bupa]] and [[Puma AG|Puma]]. The standard home [[Guernsey (clothing)|guernsey]] is used in all home and away games in Victoria, Sydney and Tasmania while the away guernsey is used in every away game in Adelaide, Perth and Brisbane.

The club's colours and designs have changed a few times during their history. From 1902 to 1904 they wore a blue guernsey with red shoulders and a red stripe down the front of the guernsey along with blue and white hooped socks. After they merged with Boroondara in 1905 they changed to a black guernsey with a red sash with black and red hooped socks. After the club had struggled for a few years it was decided to reform it and for seasons 1912â13 and they wore a yellow guernsey with a blue V. Upon entering the VFA they had to change their colours again as Williamstown already had that combination and adopted the colours brown and gold which have since remained to this day although the design has changed a few times, the main ones being:
* 1914â1924 â brown with a gold circle around the neck and the HFC monogram in the centre
* 1925â1932 â brown with a gold V and a smaller HFC monogram on the left breast
* 1933â1934 â gold with a brown V
* 1934â1949 â brown with a gold V and brown socks with gold tops
* 1950â1974 â brown and gold stripes front and back with black numbers on a white panel and brown and gold hooped socks
* 1975â1988 â brown and gold stripes with a plain gold back and brown numbers with brown and gold hooped socks
* 1989â1995 â brown and gold stripes with a plain gold back and brown numbers with plain gold socks
* 2006âpresent â brown and gold stripes front and back with black numbers on a white panel and brown and gold hooped socks

===Club song===
''We're a happy team at Hawthorn,''&lt;br /&gt;
''we're the Mighty Fighting Hawks.'' &lt;br /&gt;
''We love our club and we play to win,''&lt;br /&gt;
''riding the bumps with a grin at Hawthorn.''&lt;br /&gt;
''Come what may you'll find us striving,''&lt;br /&gt;
''team work is the thing that talks.''&lt;br /&gt;
''One for all and all for one's,''&lt;br /&gt;
''the way we are at Hawthorn.''&lt;br /&gt;
''We are the Mighty Fighting Hawks.''

It is sung to the tune of [[The Yankee Doodle Boy]].

==Corporate==
===Current issues===
The closure of [[Waverley Park]] in 1999 was a setback as Hawthorn could no longer play home games in the south-east region where they have developed a large support base. Home games were moved to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. Their relationship with the south-east was rekindled in 2006, when the Hawks returned to Waverley as a training and administration centre. The oval and a section of the Sir Kenneth Luke stand have been retained by developer [[Mirvac]] as part of their redevelopment of the Waverley site as a housing estate, largely as a result of a [[Government of Victoria|Victorian government]] commitment to keep football there. Mirvac leases the facility to Hawthorn for a peppercorn rent, until the club takes ownership of the facility within the next 20 years. Hawthorn will maintain their association with Glenferrie, by housing several coteries and conducting social activities at the club's spiritual home.

On 30 September 2008, the Hawthorn Football Club relationship with Glenferrie Oval was rekindled when the club hosted a Supporters Day at the clubs spiritual home celebrating the clubs 10th premiership, attended by an estimated 20,000 fans.

In August 2005, former Victorian State Premier [[Jeff Kennett]], a long time Hawthorn supporter and former number one membership ticket holder, was appointed to the board of the club with the intention of standing for president at the next coming [[Annual General Meeting]]. His rise to presidency was confirmed when on 14 December 2005, he was ushered in as president of the Hawthorn Football Club unopposed to the audience of a packed Hawthorn Town Hall.

====Relationship with Tasmania====
Since 2001 Hawthorn has successfully cultivated a following in Tasmania, where the membership base has increased from 1,000 to more than 9,000. Since 2006, Hawthorn has increased its presence in the state as part of an agreement with the tourism component of the Tasmanian government, whereby they are contracted to play four games in the state and the Tasmanian Government will be the major sponsor for the club. This relationship was renewed for a further period for five years (2012â16) in November 2011. Subject to AFL consent Hawthorn has offered to play an additional home game in Tasmania as part of the new deal, provided the number of rounds in the home/away season is increased by the AFL to accommodate an 18 team competition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/4742/newsid/105217/default.aspx From the President: Committed to Tassie â Official AFL Website of the Hawthorn Football Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Five 2 Fifty====
At their 2007 Annual General Meeting, Hawthorn embarked on a 5-year business plan titled &quot;five2fifty&quot;, the core idea being that in the next ''five'' years the club will target to win ''2'' premierships and have ''fifty'' thousand members.  As part of the plan, the football club wants to be seen as the most professional club in the AFL, and places great emphasis on the welfare of the people associated with the club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Hawks break all-time membership record | publisher=TalkinSport | date = 2 April 2008 | url = http://www.talkinsport.com.au/article866.html | accessdate = 1 October 2008 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====HANZ-UP====
In 2009 Hawthorn launched a community-based program called 'HANZ-UP! AFL Program' in New Zealand. The Hawks announced they had entered the New Zealand market, with an initial three-year deal with an option to extend the partnership until the end of 2018.

Hawthorn has joined with AFLNZ to promote HANZ-UP! through programs such as KiwiKick (a New Zealand version of Auskick), the Hawks Cup (a year-9 and year-10 schools competition) and the [[Trent Croad]] Scholarship Scheme (AFL international scholarships). Annual skills clinics will also be held throughout New Zealand featuring Hawthorn players. KiwiKick will see all participants receiving kits branded with the Hawks and HANZ-UP! logos, while Hawks Cup players will be given exclusive Hawthorn merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawthornfc.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/4742/newsid/87059/default.aspx HANZ-UP! for Hawks NZ program â Official AFL Website of the Hawthorn Football Club&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
[[File:Hawthorn Hawks supporters.jpg|thumb|Supporters came out in numbers to show the Hawks on at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]]]

Hawthorn boasts a large support base throughout Australia, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania. In accordance with a survey appearing in the 9/7/2008 edition of the Herald Sun, 11% of Victorian football supporters barrack for Hawthorn, behind only [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] (14%), [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] (12%) and [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] (12%).

According to club research, the club has well over 400,000 supporters across Australia{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. Notable supporters include former Victorian Premier and current club President [[Jeff Kennett]], cricketers [[Ian Healy]], [[Mark Taylor (cricketer)|Mark Taylor]], [[Terry Alderman]] and [[Damien Fleming]], Wimbledon champion [[Pat Cash]], Australian Olympic Rower [[James Tomkins (rower)|James Tomkins]], basketball legend [[Andrew Gaze]] and media personalities [[Stephen Quartermain]] and the late [[Graeme Strachan|Graeme &quot;Shirley&quot; Strachan]]. Hollywood personalities [[Ashton Kutcher]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Michael Chiklis]] and [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] have also been spotted at Hawthorn matches sporting ''Brown &amp; Gold'' scarves.

Most of this widespread support can be accredited to the club's success in the 1970s and 1980s as the club successfully nurtured talent in its home âzonesâ â primarily in the South and East of Victoria, as well as recruiting interstate talent from all over Australia. As a result the club has a very widespread membership with 7,000 Tasmanian members, 3,000 WA members and 3,000 QLD and NSW members complementing the clubs 35,000 Victorian members. In 2007 Hawthorn stated its ambitions were to grow their membership to beyond 50,000 by 2011 which was achieved in 2009.

In 2008 the Hawthorn Football Club drew 1,164,396 to all 25 completed games, a club record and 7th largest aggregate attendance for any club, of all time. In May 2009, the Hawthorn Football Club boasted the largest membership in the AFL, becoming the first Victorian club to break the 51,000 barrier for membership.

==Home grounds==
During the history of the Hawthorn Football Club, the club has had four mainstay home grounds (Glenferrie Oval, Princes Park, Waverley Park and the Melbourne Cricket Ground). Prior to adopting Glenferrie Oval as the club's traditional home the club had a nomadic history, playing home games at whatever the most suitable obtainable ground was for that season. Their first home ground, the Hawthorn C.G. (West Hawthorn Reserve) was abandoned after the first season due to conditions imposed by the Hawthorn Cricket Club and they played at John Wren's Richmond Racecourse in 1903 (which was off Bridge Road between Stawell Street and Westbank Terrace â where Tudor Street and 5 no through streets are now located) and moved to the Richmond Cricket Ground in 1904. Their merger with Boroondara in 1905 had them move to Boroondara's ground, which at the time was the East Melbourne Cricket Ground. Hawthorn dropped their colours of blue and red (similar to Melbourne's guernsey at the time) and adopted Boroondara's colours, which was a black guernsey with red sash but retained the name Hawthorn FC. When the Hawthorn council opened the Hawthorn City Sports Ground (Glenferrie Oval) in October 1905 they endeavored to get a senior club to represent the district to be the main tenant during the next football season. The Hawthorn FC, competing in the Metropolitan Junior Football Association (now known as the VAFA), and Hawthorn Rovers (a popular club in the Eastern Suburbs Association) merged to form the Hawthorn City Football Club and made Glenferrie their home ground (the word City was later dropped and the club was just known as the Hawthorn Football Club when it entered the VFA in 1914) .

===Glenferrie Oval: 1906â1973===
[[File:Glenferrieoval.jpg|thumb|Glenferrie Oval is the spiritual home the Hawks. However, the last VFL/AFL match was played back in 1973]]
Between 1906 and 1973, home games were played at the clubs traditional home, Glenferrie Oval, in the heart of the affluent suburb. The state of Glenferrie Oval and its location, close by the Glenferrie train station on the Melbourne East route, was a central reason why the club was firstly accepted into the VFA in 1914, and then the VFL in 1925. The club's onfield results had not reached any great heights in those early days but both the VFA and VFL had recognised the importance for representation in the suburbs east of the Yarra River. Glenferrie Oval was pivotal in these advancements of the Hawthorn Football Club as it was considered the most suitable at the time. 

In 1914, when Hawthorn entered the VFA, the council was required to build a new dressing shed to meet the standards of the VFA competition. These dressing sheds were erected in the north-west corner of the ground, where the Tuck Stand now resides, and were later moved to the Rathmines Road Reserve in Hawthorn where it still exists today. In 1922 the ground was widened by 30 yards and lengthened westward by 50 yards - taking in the previous outer reserve ground - to the dimensions that remain today. The 1922 ground improvements also resulted in Glenferrie Oval's first main stand, which was a wooden structure to be known as the Kennon-Owen Stand, and had been purchased from the East Melbourne Cricket Ground in late 1921 when that ground was closed due to expansion of the Jolimont railyards. The Kennon-Owen Stand was located where the Victorian Weightlifting Building is now situated. Glenferrie Oval is universally known for its famous art-deco Grandstand, built in 1937 and later named the Michael Tuck stand after the club great, and housed the new changerooms and administration of the club. It is now heritage protected as one of the most significant buildings of the era. The Kennon-Owen Stand was replaced by the Dr A S Ferguson Stand, a new brick stand opened in 1966 which was 185 feet long and could seat 1450, with 400 undercover. It was later to be home of the Past Players Association and the original Museum. The northern part of the Ferguson stand was demolished to make way for the Victorian Weightlifting Building. In 1963 the large scoreboard was erected at the eastern end of the ground. After the club won the 1961 premiership it was decided to buy some houses on the other side of Linda Crescent to build the Social Club which opened in 1962.

Glenferrie Oval was regarded as one of the better and picturesque suburban grounds, loved by opposition fans and Hawthorn fans alike. Whilst the ground was relatively small by VFL standards, the intimate nature of the ground (with the grandstands and train line surrounding the ground) made for a terridic atmosphere with the constant 'buzz' engulfing the Hawthorn suburb as the club rose from celler dwellers to league power during the franatic 1960s and 1970s, coinciding with the 1961 and 1971 pennants.

Whilst the club was forced to leave the ground in 1973 to cater for the clubs growing crowds and demands of VFL football, Glenferrie Oval still holds a special place in the hearts of all Hawthorn supporters. From 1974â2006 the club used the ground as a home and administration base, conducting training sessions and running a social club, across on Linda Crescent before the club made the move to Waverley Park to service the clubs growing supporter base in Melbourne's outer Eastern suburbs.

In the aftermath of Hawthorn's 2008 Premiership, Hawthorn took the premiership to Glenferrie Oval to celebrate with their adoring fans on the Sunday. The event was attended by an estimated 20,000+ supporters, packing the rust bucket venue and stretching across the road to Linda Crescent and along the Linda Crescent street, such was the turnout, the club had to close the gates to the ground hours before the team arrived at the ground. The massive turnout justified the longheld view that although the club has moved on from the halycon days at Glenferrie, the ground and suburb is still the club's spiritual home, after 35 years playing games away from the suburb of Hawthorn, the Hawthorn Football Club and suburb of Hawthorn share a unique bond.

===Princes Park: 1974â1991===
The decision to move away from Glenferrie Oval and subsequent move to [[Princes Park (stadium)|Princes Park]], was a difficult transition, alienating many supporters. Prior to moving to Princes Park, the club pushed to build a stadium in Box Hill and mooted a move to the MCG (1964) both were rejected. The move to Princes Park â the traditional home of the Carlton Football Club, coincided with the clubs golden era, hoisting the '76, '78, '83, '86, '88, '89 and '91 premiership flags at the ground. Combined with Carlton's '79, '81, '82 and '87 flags, Princes Park became a hub of success throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

Whilst the club had immense success at the ground, the ground wasn't a favourite with the majority of the Hawthorn membership. Located in Melbourne's Northern suburbs, the traditional home of the Carlton Football Club â one of the traditional powerhouses of the VFL, the move away from the clubs heartland caused many Hawks supporters to turn their back on the club.

Recognising this, as early as the mid 1980s the Hawthorn administration pushed to relocate from Princes Park to Waverley Park, however due to the nature of long term terms of tenancy at Princes Park and ruthlessness of the Carlton Football Club for Hawthorn to abide by this contract, a move away from Princes Park before the end of the long term agreement would result in financial ruin for the club.

===Waverley Park: 1992â1999===
In 1990, with the backing of the AFL, Hawthorn set the wheels in motion for a move to VFL Park, playing a series of home games at Waverley Park â located 20&amp;nbsp;km east of the Melbourne CBD and location of Hawthorn's 1991 Premiership success. Whilst the move to Waverley was met with a drop in on-field success, symbolising the birth of the barren period for the club on the field leading up until 2008, the club successfully harboured large increases in attendances and membership at the ground.

As a result of the AFL closing the venue and subsequently selling the property to Mirvac to finance the Docklands stadia, the club had the opportunity to move home games to either the lavish new Docklands percent (alongside Essendon, St Kilda, Western Bulldogs and North Melbourne) or join traditional tenants Melbourne and Richmond as well as Collingwood at the MCG. Highlighting the potential to push attendances and membership beyond 50,000, the club decided to push for a relocation to the MCG in line with the 'Family Club' mantra.

In January 2006, in the club's centennial year at Glenferrie Oval, the club's administration, museum and player base relocated to Waverley Park.

===Melbourne Cricket Ground: 2000âpresent===
On 13 March 2000, Hawthorn played its first home game as an MCG tenant against Collingwood, becoming one of four tenant clubs to play at the ground. Until 2008 the shift from to the MCG has been met with a barren period on the field for the Hawks, having played in five out of nine losing seasons at the ground. Unquestionably the lowest point as a tenant club at the ground occurred in Round 16, 2004, when bottom of the ladder Hawthorn drew just 11,682 to a game against Port Adelaide, drawing widespread ridicule.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Since 2000, Hawthorn has played between seven to nine home games at the MCG, with secondary home games being played at Docklands Stadium and York Park in Tasmania. In 2008, Hawthorn played seven home games at the MCG, drawing 369,614 (52,802) to seven games and a total of 773,089 (59,468) to 13 games at the venue for the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.afl.com.au/public/statistics/attendSBSsummary/9/2008/2000006/attendSBSsummary_9_2008_2000006.shtml?club_idIndex=8&amp;club_idValue=9&amp;season_idIndex=1&amp;venue_idIndex=56&amp;venue_idValue=2000006&amp;AFLstatisticMenu=1 AFL Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hawthorn v Western Bulldogs - 31st May 2008 181.jpg|thumb|York Park is Hawthorn's second home ground]]
Since 2001, Hawthorn's has played &quot;secondary&quot; home games at [[York Park]] (currently also known by the sponsorship name of Aurora Stadium) in Tasmania. The Hawks have a very successful record at the ground, with many{{who|date=November 2010}} in the media dubbing the venue &quot;Fortress Aurora&quot; for opposition sides. As a result of the agreement with the Tasmanian government, thousands of Melbourne-based Hawthorn supporters have travelled to Tasmania to watch the Hawks play, increasing activity within the local Launceston economy. By the same token, Hawthorn has successfully increased its following in the state, with an estimated 25% of young Tasmanian supporters now barracking for their &quot;local&quot; team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,24423232-19742,00.html | title=$5m profit makes Hawthorn new AFL powerhouse | first=Damian | last=Barrett | date=30 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
