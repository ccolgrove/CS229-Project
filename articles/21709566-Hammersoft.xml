The '''Providence Friars men's basketball team''' represents [[Providence College]] in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] competition, in which they are a founding member of the [[Big East Conference]]. They play their home games at the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center]] in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Since 2011, the head coach is [[Ed Cooley]].

The Friars have made two Final Four appearances in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], in 1973 and 1987. Three former players or coaches are enshrined in the [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]]: [[Dave Gavitt]], [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]], and [[Lenny Wilkens]]. In addition, two-time [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] champion, [[Florida Gators men's basketball]] head coach [[Billy Donovan]], helped lead the Friars (as a player) to the Final Four in 1987.

==History==
===Early years: 1921â1955===
Providence Friars basketball can be traced back to 1921, when the four-year old school fielded its first basketball team on an informal basis. This first team only lasted two years, however, and did not return until the 1926â27 season when [[Archie Golembeski]], the school's football coach, led to the team to a win over [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]] before devoting his time to football the next year. He was replaced by [[Al McClellan]], who coached the team to four New England championships â 1929, 1930, 1932, and 1935 â and had an overall winning percentage over .700. In 1938, McClellan left and was replaced by Ed Crotty, who led the team to a 15â5 record in 1942â43 before the team suspended play the next year after the outbreak of [[World War II]]. After the war, the NCAA divided its teams into two divisions, the University Division and the College Division; with a smaller enrollment and no home court (the team played in an on-campus auditorium and then local high school gyms), the Friars were placed into the College Division and no longer faced the opponents they once played.

===1955-1969: Mullaney era===
In 1949, Vin Cuddy was hired as the team's head coach, leading the team to a 14â9 record in his first season and qualified for the NAIB regional tournament in 1951, behind the school's first 1,000-point scorer, Jim Schlimm. By 1955, Cuddy's record fell to 9â12 and he was replaced by [[Joe Mullaney]]; at the same time, the school opened its first on-campus gym, [[Alumni Hall (Providence)|Alumni Hall]]. In 1959, Mullaney and the Friars defeated ranked [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] on the road, leading to their first-ever [[National Invitational Tournament]] bid.

The Friars reached the NIT Finals in 1960 before winning the tournament in 1961 behind future hall of famer [[Lenny Wilkens]]. Two years later, led by another future hall of famer, [[John Thompson (basketball)|John Thompson]], as well as future [[List of mayors of Boston|Boston Mayor]] [[Raymond Flynn|Ray Flynn]], the Friars won their second NIT title. With a 24â2 record in 1964â65, the number four ranked Friars reached the Elite Eight of the [[1965 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament]]. In 1966â67, [[Jimmy Walker (basketball)|Jimmy Walker]] led the nation in scoring and became the school's first 2,000-point scorer as well as the first [[New England]] player selected first overall in the [[1967 NBA Draft|NBA Draft]]. That season also marked the last in Mullaney's run of nine consecutive 20-win seasons. Two years later, Mullaney was hired as the head coach of the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] of the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].

===1969â1979: Gavitt era===
Following Mullaney's departure, [[Dave Gavitt]], an assistant under Mullaney who then became head coach at [[Dartmouth Big Green|Dartmouth]], took over as the Friars' head coach in 1969. In his second year, Gavitt began a string of eight consecutive 20-win seasons. For the 1972â73 season, the team began playing in downtown Providence at the brand-new 12,000-seat arena, the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center|Providence Civic Center]] (renamed the [[Dunkin' Donuts]] Center in 2001). That season was the Friars' best to date; led by [[Ernie DiGregorio]] and [[Marvin Barnes]], the team went on a 17-team game winning streak that ended in a [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament#Final Four|Final Four]] loss to [[Memphis Tigers men's basketball|Memphis State]]. The next year, the Friars posted a 28â4 record and made their second straight Sweet Sixteen appearance. The team continued its top-flight status with back-to-back 20-win seasons in 1976â77 and 1977â78, earning NCAA Tournament bids each year, one coming after defeating top-ranked [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] in 1976. After a 10â16 season in 1978â79, Gavitt left Providence to become the first commissioner of the Providence-based [[Big East Conference]]. He finished his 10-year career at Providence with a 209â84 (.713) record.

===1979â1985: Mullaney returns===
After spending the first six decades of their existence as an independent, the Friars joined the Big East in its inaugural season, 1979â80. The conference originally consisted of Providence, St. John's, [[Boston College Eagles men's basketball|Boston College]], [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]], [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]], [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall]], and [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]]. New head coach [[Gary Walters]] led the team to an 11â16 record in 1979â80, and was replaced by Mullaney in 1981. His next stint with the Friars would not be as successful, and consisted of only one winning season (1983â84, behind [[Otis Thorpe]]) against three losing.

===1985â1987: Pitino era===
In 1985, [[New York Knicks]] assistant coach [[Rick Pitino]] was hired as the latest Friars head coach. In his first season the Friars compiled a 17â14 record and made their fist NIT appearance in a decade. The next year, 1986â87, the Friars posted a 25â9 record behind [[Billy Donovan]] and made their second ever Final Four appearance in the [[1987 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. After losing to Syracuse, Pitino left the school and re-joined the Knicks as their head coach in 1987.

===1987â1998: Chiesa, Barnes, Gillen===
[[File:Providence College Syracuse.jpg|thumb|225px|[[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] vs. Providence game in February 2010 at the Dunkin' Donuts Center.]]
In 1987â88, the Friars posted a losing record under new head coach [[Gordon Chiesa|Gordie Chiesa]], who was replaced by [[Rick Barnes]] after the season. Behind Barnes and 2,000-point scorer [[Eric Murdock]], the Friars made back-to-back NCAA Tournament appearances in 1989 and 1990, as well as an NIT bid in 1991. Following Murdock's departure and a losing season in 1991â92, the team had an NIT semifinal appearance in 1993 and an NCAA tournament appearance in 1994, while also capturing the school's first Big East Tournament title. Following back-to-back 20-win seasons, Barnes left to become the head coach at [[Clemson Tigers men's basketball|Clemson]] in 1994. He was replaced by [[Pete Gillen]]. Led by [[Eric Williams (basketball, born 1972)|Eric Williams]], the Friars made consecutive NIT appearances in 1995 and 1996. In 1996â97, the Friars posted a 24â12 record, led by [[Austin Croshere]] and [[Jamel Thomas]]. After defeating [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] in the [[1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], the Friars reached the Elite Eight before losing to eventual champion [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]]. Following a losing season in 1997â98, Gillen departed to become the head coach at [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]].

===1998â2008: Welsh era===
Gillen was replaced by [[Iona Gaels|Iona]] head coach [[Tim Welsh]] in 1998. Led by Thomas, the Friars made an NIT bid in 1999. The team returned to the NCAA Tournament two years later, posting a 21â10 record behind [[John Linehan (basketball)|John Linehan]]. While the Friars posted a losing record in Linehan's senior season in 2001â02, the guard broke [[Allen Iverson]]'s single-season Big East steals record of 67 as well as Murdock's NCAA career steals record of 377. Led by [[Ryan Gomes]], the Friars returned to the NIT with an 18â14 record in 2002â03 and made another NCAA appearance in [[2003â04 Providence Friars men's basketball team|2003â04]] with a 20â9 record. However, Welsh's next four teams, without Gomes after 2004â05, recorded one winning season, and Welsh was fired following the 2007â08 season.

===2008â2011: Davis era===
In 2008, the Friars hired [[Drake Bulldogs men's basketball|Drake]] head coach [[Keno Davis]], who won the National Coach of the Year Award in his first and only season as Drake's head coach. Davis' team posted a 19â14 record, including a win at home over top-ranked [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh]], in [[2008â09 Providence Friars men's basketball team|2008â09]] en route to an NIT appearance. In [[2009â10 Providence Friars men's basketball team|2009â10]], Davis' team lost their final eleven games to finish 15th in the Big East. The Friars averaged 82 points per game, the fourth highest in Division I, while also surrendering 85 points per conference game, the worst statistical performance in Big East history. In Davis' third season, [[2010â11 Providence Friars men's basketball team|2010â11]], the Friars finished 14th in the conference despite having Division I's second-leading scorer in [[Marshon Brooks]]. Davis was fired after the 2010â11 season.

===2011âpresent: Cooley era===
In 2011, the Friars hired [[Fairfield Stags men's basketball|Fairfield]] head coach [[Ed Cooley]], a Providence native, as their next head coach.
