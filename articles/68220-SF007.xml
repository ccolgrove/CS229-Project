'''''Slash'EM''''' ('''''Super Lotsa Added Stuff Hack - Extended Magic''''') is a variant of the [[roguelike]] game ''[[NetHack]]'' that offers extra features, monsters, and items. Several of its novel features, such as the Monk class, &quot;conducts&quot; (voluntary challenges), and the [[Sokoban]] levels, have been reincorporated into ''NetHack''.

The main [[dungeon]] in ''Slash'EM'' is much larger than in ''NetHack'', introducing special levels such as the Sunless Sea, where a [[Aladdin's lamp|magic lamp]] lies, and the Guild of Disgruntled Adventurers, populated by &quot;player monsters&quot; ([[archaeologist]]s, [[barbarian]]s, and the like).

Compared to ''NetHack'', [[Gehennom]] comprises fewer levels, though it contains a special level for each [[demon]] lord and prince, including those who only appear when summoned in ''NetHack''. These alterations serve to reduce player tedium that results from trekking through repetitive maze levels.

==History==
Warren Cheung began ''Slash'EM'' development in 1997, basing it on a ''NetHack'' variant, ''Slash''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2003/06/12/slashem.html|title=Slash'EM: The Sum of All NetHacks|author=Howard Wen|date=June 12, 2003|accessdate=2008-11-13|publisher=O'Reilly|work=linuxdevcenter.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Compatible graphical interfaces==
Enhanced graphical options also exist, such as the [[Isometric projection|isometric perspective]] of ''[http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture Vulture]'', or the [[3D computer graphics|three-dimensional]] rendering that ''[http://www.darkarts.co.za/noegnud noegnud]'' offers. ''Vulture'' (previously ''Vulture's Claw'') is a [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of the now-defunct ''[[Falcon's Eye]]'' project. ''Vulture'' adds additional graphics, sounds, bugfixes and performance enhancements and is under active development.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.darkarts.co.za/vulture/news&lt;/ref&gt;
