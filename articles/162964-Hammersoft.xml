'''John Phillip Stamos''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|s|t|eÉª|m|oÊ|s}} {{respell|STAY|mohs}}; born August 19, 1963) is an American actor, singer and musician best known for his work in television, especially in his starring role as [[Jesse Katsopolis (Full House)|Jesse Katsopolis]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sitcom ''[[Full House]]''. Since the cancellation of that show in 1995, Stamos has appeared in numerous television films and series. From 2006 to 2009, Stamos had a starring role on the [[NBC]] medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' as [[Tony Gates|Dr. Tony Gates]]. In September 2009, he began playing the role of Albert in the Broadway revival of ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]''. In September 2010  Stamos began a multi-episode arc as Dr. Carl Howell on the second season of the hit Fox series ''[[Glee (TV series)|Glee]]''.

==Early life==
Stamos was born in [[Cypress, California]].  He is the oldest child and only son of Loretta ({{nÃ©e}} Phillips), a former swimsuit model who was raised in England and Bill Stamos, a [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant and restaurateur from [[Paraguay]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/8/John-Stamos.html |title=John Stamos Biography (1963â) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date= |accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.teentelevision.com/2007/01/08/stamos-uses-real-life-trauma-as-research&lt;/ref&gt; Stamos has two younger sisters, Jannen and Alaina, who are both teachers. His family's last name was originally Stamatopoulos ({{lang-el|Î£ÏÎ±Î¼Î±ÏÏÏÎ¿ÏÎ»Î¿Ï}}) but his grandparents shortened the name to Stamos after they moved to the United States from [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001764/bio&lt;/ref&gt; ('-poulos' is a common Greek suffix in surnames, meaning &quot;son of&quot;; 'Stamos' is the root.)

When Stamos was a child, he was told mistakenly by his family doctor that he had a [[hernia]]. He underwent surgery, but it turned out that there was no hernia present, but the embarrassing thing for Stamos is, the procedure left him with an odd-looking [[navel|belly-button]], which he showed on [[Late Night with Conan O'Brien]] after [[Conan O'Brien|O'Brien]] pressured him to do so.

==Early career==
Stamos began his acting career with a role on the television show ''[[General Hospital]]'' as Blackie Parrish, for which he received a [[Daytime Emmy Award]] nomination in 1984. Then ''General Hospital'' casting director [[Gary Price (casting director)|Gary Price]] noted that Stamos did not read for any particular parts.{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} His stint on ''General Hospital'' got him noticed with daytime viewers, but by 1984 Stamos decided to move on when he auditioned for, and got the lead role, in a short-lived [[CBS]] sitcom called ''[[Dreams (TV series)|Dreams]]'', in which he played an aspiring musician in a band of the same name.

Later on he played a role in the [[sitcom]] ''[[You Again?]]'' with [[Jack Klugman]].

==''Full House''==
[[File:John Stamos (1990).jpg|thumb|left|Stamos in February 1990]]
[[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Full House]]'' gradually became a hit, and the show solidified Stamos's career. In the first season, his character's full name was credited as Jesse Cochran. During the second season he then changed his character's last name to Katsopolis to highlight his Greek heritage, according to [[Jeff Franklin]]. He played one of the show's [[protagonists]], [[Jesse Katsopolis (Full House)|Jesse]], who lived with his brother in-law Danny (Bob Saget), whose deceased wife was Jesse's older sister. Danny's best friend Joey (Dave Coulier) also lived in the house with them. He helped raise his young nieces DJ, Stephanie, and Michelle. He was known to be the &quot;bad boy&quot; at first, until he fell in love with and married Rebecca Donaldson-Katsopolis and had twin boys Nicholas and Alexander, better known as Nicky and Alex.  Although the series was canceled after eight seasons, he still maintains a close relationship with his co-stars [[Bob Saget]], [[Dave Coulier]], [[Lori Loughlin]], [[Jodie Sweetin]], [[Mary-Kate]] and [[Ashley Olsen]], and [[Candace Cameron Bure]]. As of 2011, the show airs on [[ABC Family]] and [[TeenNick]] in re-runs.

==Post-''Full House''==
Since the show's cancellation, Stamos has appeared in numerous made-for-television films, stage productions, television series and commercials. He had starring roles in the television series ''Thieves'' (2001), and ''[[Jake in Progress]]'' (2005). Both shows ran for several episodes before cancellation.  In 2003, Stamos guest-starred in ''[[Friends]]'', appearing in the episode ''[[The One with the Donor]]'', playing a man who went to Chandler and Monica's apartment for dinner, not knowing he was actually being interviewed to be a sperm donor.

In the controversial [[A&amp;E Network|A&amp;E]] television movie ''[[Wedding Wars]]'' (2006), he starred as Shel, a gay wedding planner. He stated that his performance reflected his support for same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;Mackie, Drew. [http://www.afterelton.com/people/2006/12/stamos.html?page=0%2C1 John Stamos Plays Gay On &quot;Wedding Wars&quot;], ''After Elton'', December 11, 2006.

In 2006, Stamos guest starred in two episodes in season 12 of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' as paramedic-turned-intern [[Tony Gates]].
