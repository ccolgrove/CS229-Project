Ramy Fakhry,&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2&quot;/&gt; a 27-year-old electrical engineer, died as a result of bullet wounds received at an army checkpoint somewhere in the governorate of Damietta. The checkpointâs exact location is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/crime-a-accidents/family-of-man-killed-at-checkpoint-demands-investigation.html |title=Family of man killed at checkpoint demands investigation |publisher=www.thedailynewsegypt.com|date=2011-05-15 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one, unconfirmed, version of events, Fakhry stopped his car just short of the checkpoint when he saw a gunfight between the army and assailants ahead of him and was shot three times in the back as he attempted to drive away.&lt;ref name=&quot;thedailynewsegypt1&quot;/&gt; Another version of the story says he left the rig where he worked near Damietta on Friday 13 May to attend a wedding. On his way back later that night at 1 am â before the curfew imposed at the time â Fakhry was shot dead at an army checkpoint.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14715/Egypt/Politics-/Activists-and-friends-seek-answers-over-Ramy-Fakhr.aspx |title=Activists and friends seek answers over Ramy Fakhryâs death|publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date=2011-06-21 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; A candlelight vigil was organized by Ramy's family and friends on May 14, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arabawy.org/2011/05/17/tribute-to-ramy-fakhry-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%8A-%D9%81%D8%AE%D8%B1%D9%8A/ |title=Tribute to Ramy Fakhry 3|publisher=www.arabawy.org|date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Head of the Supreme Council for Armed Force (SCAF), Field Marshal Hussein Tantawi, ordered an investigation into the killing of Ramy Fakhry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/people/following-vigil-scaf-orders-investigation-into-army-shooting-of-engineer.html |title=Following vigil, SCAF orders investigation into army shooting of engineer |publisher=www.thedailynewsegypt.com|date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The statement has not been followed up with any updates concerning the investigation, prompting the call for action.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2&quot;/&gt; Whatever the circumstances activists believe that Fakhry&lt;ref name=&quot;ahram2&quot;/&gt; was killed by the army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/12289/Egypt/Politics-/Candlelight-vigil-for-Egyptian-shot-by-army-asks-W.aspx |title=Candlelight vigil for Egyptian shot by army asks 'Why was Ramy killed?' |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date=2011-05-17 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, Mohamed Mohsen, a protester and an activist, died at Nasser Hospital Institute, 12 days after he was hit with a rock that caused him brain hemorrhage. Mohsen had participated in a march on July 23 heading to the Ministry of Defense in denouncement of SCAF, which was stopped at the neighborhood of Abbasseya by military troops. Thereafter, the entire march was attacked by thugs, and allegedly by the residents of Abbasseya as well, who threw rocks and molotov cocktails at the protesters. One eyewitness said Mohsen was hit by a rock from a nearby rooftop, which made it likely that he was indeed hit by a resident of the area. Protesters were unable to have him hospitalized for over two hours, as ambulances couldn't reach the march, which was surrounded by military police, and he was not taken to the nearby Demerdash Hospital because of rumors that injured protesters were being arrested. After several other hospitals refused to take him in he was eventually admitted at the Nasser Hospital. The lag between his injury and hospitalization as well as apparently very poor health care eventually led to Mohsen's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shorouknews.com/contentdata.aspx?id=518916 |title=Ululations in farewell to the Abbasseya martyr |publisher=Shorouknews.com |language=[[Arabic]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protesters blamed SCAF for his death, as it was believed the attacks against the march came at the incitement and fear-mongering of the military, and specifically put the blame on Major General Hassan el-Ruweiny. A large funeral was held for him in his home city of [[Aswan]], and around 200 protesters held a funeral at a mosque near [[Tahrir Square]], after [[Friday Prayer]]s. It was blocked from entering the square by military police and [[Central Security Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/483566 |title=Protesters show solidarity with victim of Abbasseya attack &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=2011-07-23 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dostor.org/politics/egypt/11/august/5/50278 |title=Military Police block a march to Tahrir Square |publisher=Dostor.org |language=[[Arabic]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/483640 |title=Army and Police close Tahrir Square to Protesters for the first time after the Revolution |publisher=Almasryalyoum.com |language=[[Arabic]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later during the day, protesters had a Ramadan [[iftar]] in the square in a celebratory manner, but soon afterwards were attacked and dispersed by military police after claiming they were planning on renewing the sit-in in Tahrir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/483685 |title=Army forces disperse the &quot;Tahrir Iftar&quot; |publisher=Almasryalyoum.com |language=[[Arabic]] |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
