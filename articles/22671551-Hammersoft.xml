==Competition==
The competition was little known for the first 2 years of format with Queensland Roar booking under-rated overseas teams such as [[Supersport United]] with the game pulling only just over 12,000 fans into Suncorp Stadium. The competition got major media publicity in 2009 when talk of English [[Premier League]] clubs [[Fulham FC|Fulham]] or [[Everton FC|Everton]] would tour to Brisbane to play against Queensland Roar in the Translink Cup. But original plans for Queensland to play Fulham were scrapped after the team went into a financial crisis. The 2009 version was then locked in with [[Scottish Premier League]] club [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] for 12 July&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxsports.com.au/story/0,8659,25407071-5000940,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;.

Over 31,000 people from around the globe turned up to the match, with many of the 31,000  Celtic supporters.
