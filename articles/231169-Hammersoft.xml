'''USS ''Theodore Roosevelt'' (CVN-71)''' (also known by crewmembers as &quot;the Big Stick&quot; or within the navy simply as ''TR'') is the fourth [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz''-class supercarrier]].  Her radio [[call sign]] is Rough Rider, the name of President [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s [[Rough Riders|volunteer cavalry unit]] during the [[Spanish-American War]].  She was launched in 1984, saw her first action during [[Operation Desert Storm]] in 1991, and is currently homeported at [[Newport News Shipbuilding Company | Newport News Shipyard]], Virginia.

==Design and construction==
{{Main|Nimitz class aircraft carrier}}

''Roosevelt'' and those ''Nimitz''-class vessels completed after her have slight structural differences from the earlier carriers (''Nimitz'' and ''Eisenhower''), and improved protection for ordnance storage in her [[Magazine (artillery)|magazines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/costing-the-cvn21-a-did-primer-01624/ |title=Costing the CVN-21: A DID Primer |author= |date=19-December-2005 |work= |publisher=Defense Industry Daily |accessdate=27 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''TR's'' history began on 30 September 1980, when a contract was awarded for &quot;Hull 624D&quot; to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]].

Her keel was laid down on 31 October 1981, with Secretary of Defense [[Caspar Weinberger]] initiating the first weld.  On 3  November 1981, Secretary of the Navy [[John F. Lehman]] announced that the carrier would be named for the 26th President of the United States, Theodore Roosevelt.

''TR'' was the first aircraft carrier to be assembled using modular construction, wherein large modules are independently constructed in &quot;lay-down&quot; areas, prior to being hoisted into place and welded together.  Modular construction, made possible through the use of a huge gantry crane capable of lifting 900 tons, cut 16 months off ''TR's'' construction time, and the technique has been used on every aircraft carrier since.

The Navy's Pre Commissioning Unit (PCU) was formed in February 1984, with Captain Paul W. Parcells named the Commanding Officer.

On 27  October 1984 the ship was officially [[Ship naming and launching|christened]] by Mrs. Barbara Lehman, wife of Secretary Lehman.  On 25 October 1986, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was [[Ship commissioning|commissioned]] to active service at Newport News.

==Service history==
===Maiden Deployment===
[[Image:USS Theodor Roosevelt shock test.jpg|thumb|left|Shock test of ''TR'' during sea trials in 1987]]
After sea trials and pre-deployment work ups, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' started her [[maiden voyage|maiden deployment]] on 30 December 1988 with [[Carrier Air Wing Eight]] embarked.  The ship patrolled the Mediterranean Sea, Red Sea, and Persian Gulf prior to returning on 30 June 1989.

''Theodore Roosevelt'' was awarded the 1989 [[Battle &quot;E&quot;]] from [[Commander, Naval Air Force U.S. Atlantic Fleet]] on 20 March 1990.

===1990s===
====Gulf war====
On 28 December 1990, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' and CVW-8 deployed for [[Gulf_War#Operation_Desert_Shield|Operation Desert Shield]], arriving in the [[Persian Gulf]] on 16 January 1991.  With the commencement of [[Operation Desert Storm]] on 15 January 1991, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' began combat operations; eventually flying over 4,200 sorties (more than any other carrier) and dropping more than 4,800,000&amp;nbsp;pounds of ordnance before the cease-fire on 28 February.&lt;ref name=&quot;USS THEODORE ROOSEVELT - HISTORY&quot;/&gt;

When [[Iraq]]i forces turned on the [[Kurd]]s, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' and CVW-8 were among the first coalition forces in [[Operation Provide Comfort]], flying patrols over northern Iraq.  After a 189-day deployment, with 169 days at sea, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' returned to Norfolk on 28 June 1991.  On 14 February 1992, the ship won her second Battle &quot;E&quot;.  This was followed by the award of the [[Battenberg Cup]] for 1991 as the Atlantic Fleet's premier ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr.surfor.navy.mil&quot;&gt;http://www.tr.surfor.navy.mil/about%20tr/ship%20history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

====1993-1999====
''Theodore Roosevelt'' began her third deployment on 11 March 1993, again with CVW-8 embarked. Also embarked was a Special Purpose Marine Air Ground Task Force (SPMAGTF), in a test the concept of embarking a multi-purpose Marine force in a carrier.

While the ship was still in the [[Virginia Capes]] operating area, President [[Bill Clinton]] flew aboard for several hours for his first visit to a [[U.S. Navy]] ship.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr.surfor.navy.mil&quot;/&gt;

''TR'' operated in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] as CVW-8 planes enforced [[Operation Deny Flight]] in the U.S. no-fly zone over [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia]].  In June, on the way to only her second port visit, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was ordered instead to transit the [[Suez Canal]] en-route to the [[Red Sea]] to participate in [[Operation Southern Watch]], enforcing the no-fly zone over Iraq.

Deployed for 184 days, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' spent 169 days under way prior to return in September 1993.  For the accomplishments of her crew, the ship received her second [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]].

From November 1993 to April 1994, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' conducted  a Selected Restricted Availability (SRA) at [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] (NNSY), completing ahead of schedule.

On 10 March 1994, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' received its third Battle &quot;E&quot;. Then on 3 June, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was awarded her second [[Battenberg Cup]] as the best ship in the Atlantic Fleet.

''Theodore Roosevelt'' and CVW-8 began their fourth deployment in March 1995, operating in the [[Red Sea]] in support of Operation Southern Watch over Iraq, and Operations [[Operation Deny Flight|Deny Flight]] and [[Operation Sharp Guard|Sharp Guard]] over the skies of Bosnia and in the Adriatic operating areas.  Deny Flight evolved into [[Operation Deliberate Force]], as CVW-8 aircraft led [[NATO]] strikes against strategic Bosnian Serb targets in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]].  The ''Theodore Roosevelt'' Battle Group returned to Norfolk, Virginia in September 1995 and was awarded the [[Navy Unit Commendation]] for its Bosnia operations.&lt;ref name=&quot;tr.surfor.navy.mil&quot;/&gt;

''Theodore Roosevelt'' deployed for her fifth deployment on 25 November 1996, with [[Carrier Air Wing 3|CVW-3]] embarked, in support of Operation Southern Watch in the [[Mediterranean]] and [[Persian Gulf]]. The ship returned from deployment in May 1997.

On 8 July 1997, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' entered the [[Newport News Shipbuilding]] yard for a one-year Extended Drydock and Selected Restricted Availability (EDSRA) , her first major overhaul since commissioning.  ''Theodore Roosevelt'' returned to her homeport of [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Naval Station]] on 2 July 1998.

From 1 February to 4 March 1999 ''Theodore Roosevelt'' participated in a large navy exercise called JTFEX / TMDI99 along with the Brazilian navy and several ''NATO'' navies. During the exercise ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was 'sunk'&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.nl/books?id=Tqj9ZP8FsJEC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;lpg=PA22&amp;dq=JTFEX/TMDI+99+walrus&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BGZ5H7K5am&amp;sig=FMlvvBo-zj-rEcltDgVpZXpTO-U&amp;hl=nl&amp;ei=W7CfS6yrEY2t4Qbrvv2QDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CAYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=JTFEX%2FTMDI%2099%20walrus&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; by a Dutch submarine called the Walrus (2) along with 8 other US ships, many of which were part of ''Theodore Roosevelt''s escorts.

''Theodore Roosevelt'' began her sixth deployment on 26 March 1999 with CVW-8 embarked.  They were immediately called to duty in the [[Ionian Sea]] to support NATO's [[Operation Allied Force]]. ''Theodore Roosevelt'' and CVW-8 aircraft conducted air strikes for two months over the skies of [[Kosovo]] against the Serbians. TR and CVW-8 were then dispatched to support Operation Southern Watch, enforcing the &quot;no-fly&quot; zone over Southern [[Iraq]]. ''Theodore Roosevelt'' returned to her homeport of Norfolk, Va., on 24 September 1999.

On 10 January 2000, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' entered a Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) at the Norfolk Naval Naval Shipyard, [[Portsmouth, Virginia]] for a six month maintenance period.

===2000s===
After the [[11 September attacks]], ''Theodore Roosevelt'' began her seventh deployment earlier than planned on 19 September 2001 with [[Carrier Air Wing One]]. On the night of 4 October 2001, ''Theodore Roosevelt'' and CVW-1 launched the initial strikes of [[Operation Enduring Freedom]] against [[al-Qaeda]] in [[Afghanistan]] from the [[North Arabian Sea]].  ''Theodore Roosevelt'' spent 159 consecutive days at sea, breaking the record longest period underway since WWII.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-47099_ITM }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Theodore Roosevelt'' returned to her homeport 27 March 2002, and was awarded the [[Navy Unit Commendation]], 2001 [[Battenberg Cup]], and 2001 [[Battle E]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=1908&lt;/ref&gt;
From April to October 2002, ''TR'' conducted a Planned Incremental Availability maintenance period at Norfolk Naval Ship Yard.

[[File:USS Theodore Roosevelt - resplenishment.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Roosevelt receives cargo while pierside at the NATO Marathi Pier Facility.]]
''Theodore Roosevelt'' got underway on 6 January for a scheduled month-long training period in the Puerto Rican Operating Area.  Near the end of January, ''TR'' received orders to proceed across the Atlantic to the Mediterranean Sea.  [[VFA-201|Strike Fighter Squadron 201]], based at Naval Air Station [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base Fort Worth]], Texas, was ordered to active duty as a unit of Carrier Air Wing (CVW) 8, the first [[United States Navy Reserve|Naval Reserve]] squadron to deploy aboard an aircraft carrier since the [[Korean War]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=5302&lt;/ref&gt; ''TR'' arrived on station in the Eastern Mediterranean in February.  On 22 March 2003 ''Theodore Roosevelt'', along with [[USS Harry S. Truman (CVN-75)|USS ''Harry S. Truman'' (CVN-75)]], began launching air strikes into Iraq in support of [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=6471&lt;/ref&gt; ''TR'' returned home on 26 May, and was awarded the [[Meritorious Unit Commendation]], the [[Navy Unit Citation]], and the [[Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal]].

[[Image:Uss theodore roosevelt cvn-71.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''TR'' in the Elizabeth River in 2004]]
On 19 February 2004, ''TR'' entered a ten-month Docked Planned Incremental Availability (DPIA) at NNSY in Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=12404&lt;/ref&gt;  Major systems overhauled included AC systems, Steam and CHT (sewage) systems, 1MC (announcing) systems, communication, navigation, and detection suites, weapons elevator overhauls, propeller replacement, hull cleaning and painting, and sea valve replacement, to name a few. ''TR'' came out of dry-dock in August and completed the maintenance availability on 17 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=16350&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 September 2005, ''TR'' deployed with [[Carrier Air Wing Eight]] embarked for a routine six-month mission to the Persian Gulf in support of OIF.,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=19883&lt;/ref&gt; transiting the [[Suez Canal]] on 27  September&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=20463&lt;/ref&gt;  and launching OIF missions beginning 6  October.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=20517&lt;/ref&gt;  This deployment was the last cruise for the [[F-14 Tomcat]] before its retirement in 2006. The ''TR'' carried two Tomcat squadrons, [[VF-31]] (Tomcatters) and [[VF-213]] (Black Lions).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=24913&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Theodore Roosevelt'' returned to home port on 11 March 2006.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

Shortly after this cruise, the ''TR'' earned the [[&quot;Jig Dog&quot; Ramage Carrier and Carrier Air Wing Operational Excellence Award]], which is a Navy-wide award that is selected jointly by Type Commanders (TYCOM) and is presented to the Carrier/Air Wing team with the best performance as an integrated unit.

On 7 March 2007 ''Teddy Roosevelt'' began a nine month Planned Incremental Availability (PIA) in Norfolk, which saw the addition of [[RIM-116_Rolling_Airframe_Missile#Sea_RAM|RAM missiles]] among other upgrades.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=28222 Theodore Roosevelt Moves to Shipyard&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The ship returned to Naval Station Norfolk on 28 November 2007.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

CVW-8 and ''Theodore Roosevelt'' participated in Joint Task Force Exercise 08-4 Operation Brimstone off the coast of [[North Carolina]] between 21 July and 31 July 2008. The British carrier {{HMS|Ark Royal|R07|6}}, the amphibious assault ship {{USS|Iwo Jima|LHD-7|2}} with associated units and the [[Brazilian Navy]] frigate [[HMS Broadsword (F88)|''Greenhalgh'' (F-46)]] and the French submarine [[AmÃ©thyste (S 605)|''AmÃ©thyste'']] also participated in the event.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=38478 JTFEX 08-4 &quot;Operation Brimstone&quot; Flexes Allied Force Training]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Roosevelt'' left Norfolk on 8 September 2008 for a scheduled deployment to the Middle East with [[Carrier Air Wing Eight]] embarked.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.news.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=39754&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 October 2008 the ship stopped at [[Cape Town]], South Africa.  This was the first visit to Cape Town by a nuclear-powered vessel since the German cargo ship [[Otto Hahn (ship)|Otto Hahn]] in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;IOL, USS Theodore gets green light&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to poor weather, approximately half of the ship's crew was unable to go ashore on [[liberty]]. The ship made four subsequent port stops in [[Jebel Ali]], UAE, including one during the Christmas holiday. CVW-8 and CVN-71 supported Operation Enduring Freedom and flew more than 3,100 sorties and dropped more than 59,500 pounds of ordnance while providing [[Close Air Support]] for [[International Security Assistance Force|ISAF]]-forces in Afghanistan.

On 21 March 2009 ''Theodore Roosevelt'' was relieved by [[USS Dwight D. Eisenhower (CVN-69)|USS ''Dwight D. Eisenhower'']].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=43629 ''Eisenhower'' Launches OEF Sorties]&lt;/ref&gt;  The carrier arrived at Norfolk on 18 April.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Washington Times]]'', &quot;Carrier Returns To Navy Station&quot;, 19 April 2009, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 August 2009 defense contractor [[Northrop Grumman]] was awarded a 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion dollar contract for [[Refueling and Complex Overhaul]] (RCOH) of ''Theodore Roosevelt'' which is expected to completed by February 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenselink.mil/contracts/contract.aspx?contractid=4103 DefenseLink: Contracts for Wednesday, 26 August 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
