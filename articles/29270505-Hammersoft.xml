A preview of Lion was publicly unveiled at Apple's &quot;[[Apple Special Events|Back to the Mac]]&quot; event on October 20, 2010. It brings many developments made in Apple's [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], such as an easily navigable display of installed applications, to the Mac, and includes support for the [[Mac App Store]], as introduced in [[Mac OS X Snow Leopard]] version 10.6.6.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/products/2010-10-20-apple-macbook_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Jefferson | last=Graham | title=New Apple MacBook Air costs less, plus App Store is coming | date=October 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CNetVideo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20020208-56.html|title=Apple unveils new MacBook Airs, previews Lion | Beyond Binary â CNET News|work=[[CNET]]|accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On February 24, 2011, the first developer's preview of Lion (11A390) was released to subscribers of [[Apple Developer|Apple's developers]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ex |url=http://www.iphoneincanada.ca/apple-software/apple-seeds-first-mac-os-x-10-7-lion-build-11a390/ |title=Apple Seeds First Mac OS X 10.7 Lion Build 11A390 &amp;#124; iPhone in Canada Blog â Canada's No. 1 iPhone Resource |publisher=iPhoneinCanada.ca |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other developer previews were subsequently released, with Lion Preview 4 (11A480b) being released at WWDC 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple devs get iTunes 10.5 beta, Apple TV 2 beta, Xcode 4.2 Preview and Lion Preview 4|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/06/06/apple_says_devices_updated_to_ios_5_beta_cant_be_restored_to_earlier_versions.html|publisher=AppleInsider|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lion achieved [[golden master]] status on July 1, 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=OS X Lion Golden Master seeded to developers ahead of July launch|url=http://9to5mac.com/2011/07/01/os-x-lion-golden-master-seeded-to-developers/ |accessdate=July 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; followed by its final release via the Mac App Store on July 20, 2011.

==Release and distribution==

On June 6, 2011, at the [[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference]], it was announced that the official release for Lion would be in July 2011. The specific release date of July 20 was not confirmed until the day before, July 19, by Apple CFO, [[Peter Oppenheimer]], as part of Apple's 2011 third-quarter earnings announcement.&lt;ref name=&quot;apple-q3-2011&quot;&gt;[http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Desktops-and-Notebooks/Apples-OS-X-Lion-Launching-iPad-iPhone-Quarterly-Sales-Soar-163074/ Apple's OS X Lion Launching, iPad, iPhone Quarterly Sales Soar]&lt;/ref&gt;

Apple did not initially announce any physical media distribution for Lion, such as a set of [[CD-ROM]]s or a [[DVD-ROM]] as used for past releases. Instead, the operating system was said to be available exclusively as a download from the [[Mac App Store]] for US$29.99.&lt;ref name=&quot;howtobuy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=OS X Lion â Get Lion in July. Only from the Mac App Store.|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/how-to-buy/|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;macrumors1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macrumors.com/2011/06/06/mac-os-x-lion-set-for-july-debut-priced-at-29-99-mac-app-store-exclusive/ |title=Mac OS X Lion Set for July Debut Priced at $29.99, Mac App Store Exclusive |publisher=Mac Rumors |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only prior version of OS X that supports the Mac App Store is Snow Leopard, which implied that any machines that support Lion currently running [[Mac OS X 10.4|Tiger]] or [[Mac OS X 10.5|Leopard]] would first have to be upgraded to Snow Leopard, as opposed to allowing a direct upgrade to Lion.

Apple later announced two alternative distribution mechanisms for the benefit of users without broadband Internet access: in-store downloads at retail [[Apple Store]]s, and a [[USB flash drive]] containing the OS, priced at US$69, available through the [[Apple Store (online)|online Apple Store]] beginning in August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/07/20Mac-OS-X-Lion-Available-Today-From-the-Mac-App-Store.html|title=Mac OS X Lion Available Today From the Mac App Store|author=Apple|date=July 20, 2011|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether the USB distribution will support a direct upgrade to Lion from OS X versions prior to Snow Leopard. On August 4 2011, Apple started to take orders for Mac OS X Lion's USB installation flash drives for $69.99.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.howtoarena.com/mac-osx-lion-usb-stick-is-available-now-for-69-99-order-now/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Server portion of Lion is available as a separate download from the Mac App Store for US$49.99, which is in addition to the purchase price of Lion itself.&lt;ref name=&quot;lionserver&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lion Server â The server for everyone.|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/server/|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Yes, $49.99, not $29.99; that's what the reference says. --&gt;

==Hardware support==
The first developer preview of Lion added [[TRIM]] support for [[Solid-state drive|SSDs]] shipped with Macs, which is also included in the latest version of Snow Leopard (10.6.8) shipping with current MacBook Pros before July 20, 2011. As of yet, there is no [[TRIM]] support for other [[Solid-state drive|SSDs]].&lt;ref name=&quot;trim&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/25/apple_adds_ssd_trim_support_to_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_beta.html |title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: Apple adds SSD TRIM support |publisher=AppleInsider |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saved.|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/auto-save.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Emoji]] support''' â Apple has added a new Emoji font commonly used in chat to express [[ideograms]].&lt;ref name=&quot;250features-text&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;fontbook3-emoji&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/27/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_font_book_3_emoji_support.html |title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: Font Book 3, Emoji support |publisher=AppleInsider |date=February 27, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''[[Finder (software)|Finder]]''' improvements â Finder search allows multiple search criteria to be specified without creating a smart folder, Finder search offers suggestions, files can be grouped by various attributes, and one can now merge files under two folders with the same name â a prompt will appear asking whether one wants to replace or keep both files.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finder|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#finder|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleInsider: Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: New Finder search, item arrangement views&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/27/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_new_finder_search_item_arrangement_views.html |title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: New Finder search, item arrangement views |author=AppleInsider Staff |date=February 27, 2011 |work=[[AppleInsider]] |publisher=AppleInsider, Inc |accessdate=February 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Mission Control''' replaces the &quot;All windows&quot; [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]] feature. It gives an overview of all running applications just like &quot;All windows&quot; but groups windows from the same application. At the top of the screen it gives quick access to the [[Dashboard (Mac OS)|Dashboard]], [[Spaces (software)|Spaces]], and running full screen applications.&lt;ref name=CNetVideo /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission Control â A bird's eye view of everything.|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/mission-control.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Multi-User Screen Sharing'''âThe built-in Screen Sharing feature now allows remote users to log into a separate user account from the one that is currently logged in. That means that while one user is logged into a machine, a second user can login to the same machine remotely, seeing their own desktop and user environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Screen Sharing|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#screensharing|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/03/31/mac_os_x_10_7_lion_to_introduce_multi_user_screen_sharing.html |title=Mac OS X 10.7 Lion to introduce multi-user Screen Sharing |publisher=AppleInsider |date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This partition will allow the user to restore their computer to its original factory state. It also allows for a new copy of OS X Lion to be installed over the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Internet Restore and Utilities|url=http://www.apple.com/es/macosx/whats-new/features.html#internetrestore|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Martin |first=David W. |url=http://www.cultofmac.com/mac-os-x-lion-adds-recovery-partition-support-gallery/83737 |title=Mac OS X Lion Adds Recovery Partition Support [Gallery |publisher=Cult of Mac |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Resume''' â Applications resume in the same state when re-opened as already seen in iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resume|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#resume|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''System Information''' â This feature is a re-design of System Profiler, which has been completely altered with new views which display graphical information on displays, storage devices, memory usage along with other hardware information. The previous layout remains available by clicking &quot;System Report&quot;. Early builds of Lion also used System Information as a replacement for &quot;About This Mac&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/26/mac_os_x_lion_adds_new_ios_like_about_this_mac_app.html |title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: new iOS-like About this Mac app |publisher=AppleInsider |date=February 26, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the final release reinstated the version of this dialog box found in Snow Leopard.
* '''[[Apple Terminal|Terminal]]''' has extra features, including full screen mode.
* '''[[TextEdit]]''' gains a new graphical toolbar with font selection and text highlighting. The new TextEdit also supports Apple's new automatic file saving and versions technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TextEdit|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#textedit|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;appleinsider-textedit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: TextEdit adds vertical layout, graphical toolbar|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/04/08/inside_mac_os_x_10_7_lion_textedit_adds_vertical_layout_graphical_toolbar.html|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complete list from Apple can be found on Apple's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html |title=OS X Lion â Over 250 new features. Read about all of them |publisher=Apple |accessdate=June 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Server features===
{{Main|Mac OS X Server}}
* '''Wiki Server 3''' â Making it easier to collaborate, share, and exchange information. Users can quickly switch between a server's home page, My Page, Updates, Wikis, People, and Podcasts. File sharing is simpler, and a new Page Editor is added for easy customization.&lt;ref name=&quot;lionserver&quot;/&gt;
* '''[[WebDAV]] File Sharing''' â Lion Server delivers wireless file sharing for clients that support WebDAV. Enabling WebDAV in Lion Server gives iOS users the ability to access, copy, and share documents on the server from applications such as Keynote, Numbers, and Pages.&lt;ref name=&quot;lionserver&quot;/&gt;
* '''Profile Manager''' â Profile Manager delivers simple, profile-based setup and management for Mac OS X Lion, iPhone, iPad, and iPod touch devices. It also integrates with existing directory services and delivers automatic over-the-air profile updates using the Apple Push Notification service.&lt;ref name=&quot;lionserver&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Finley |first=Klint |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/enterprise/2011/02/is-osx-lion-server-more-eviden.php |title=Is OSX Lion Server More Evidence That Apple is Gunning for the Enterprise? |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=February 24, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===User interface changes===
* Redesigned [[Aqua (user interface)|Aqua user interface]] elements, including buttons and progress bars. The red, yellow, and green buttons in the [[window decoration]]s have also been made smaller.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt;
* Flexible window resizing from any corner or edge of the window,&lt;ref name=&quot;otherfeatures&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Other Features|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#other|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/02/25/inside_mac_os_x_lion_new_window_controlsgestures.html |title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: New window controls &amp; gestures |publisher=AppleInsider |date=February 25, 2011 |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to window resizing in [[Microsoft Windows]] and many [[X window manager|window managers for X11]].
* The metal finish has also been slightly altered. It is now a lighter shade of grey than before and features a speckled texture.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
* On demand scroll bars now disappear by default when they are not being used, similar to iOS.&lt;ref name=&quot;otherfeatures&quot;/&gt;
* Scrolling is reversed by default, to act more like a touch screen computer, so that content moves in the direction of finger movement on touch-pad or mouse, rather than the scrollbar moving in the direction of finger movement. Also, like in iOS, scrolling &quot;bounces&quot; when the scroll bar hits the top or bottom of the window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Preferences|url=http://www.apple.com/macosx/whats-new/features.html#systempreferences|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* When resizing a window by clicking on the green button (left-top), a transform-effect animates the enlargement.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
* New windows fly to the front (like opening an app in iOS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/3 Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: the Ars Technica review]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The dashboard is now its own space in Mission Control, rather than in previous versions of OS X where the widgets simply flew in and the background dimmed. The &quot;ripple effect&quot; that was seen previously when adding widgets is no longer there due to this change. Users have the option to return to the old dashboard configuration in System Preferences.
* Tabs, when selected, now appear as being pushed in and darkened as opposed to previous versions where selected tabs were highlighted in aqua blue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inside Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: Developer Preview 3 dials down animated tabs|url=http://forums.appleinsider.com/showthread.php?threadid=123512#other|publisher=AppleInsider |date=April 29, 2011 |accessdate=July 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Reception for OS X Lion has generally been positive. In an extensive review of the operating system, ''[[Ars Technica]]'' recommended Lion.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; They noted that it feels like it is the start of a new line of operating systems that will continue to be influenced by Apple's [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] platform.&lt;ref name=ars/&gt; The review also compared the introduction of Lion, along with its new conventions that change traditional ways of computing, to the original [[Mac OS X]] and when it replaced the classic [[Mac OS]].&lt;ref name=ars&gt;{{cite news|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2011/07/mac-os-x-10-7.ars/|title=Mac OS X 10.7 Lion: the Ars Technica review|last=Siracusa|first=John|date=July 20, 2011|work=[[Ars Technica]]|publisher=[[CondÃ© Nast Digital]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Macworld]]'' called Lion a &quot;radical revision&quot;, praising the changes made to the operating system to be more user friendly to new Mac users that are familiar with the iOS interface, while criticizing the limited utility of the interface. Ultimately, the magazine considered Lion an operating system worth getting, giving it 4.5 out of 5 stars.&lt;ref name=macworld&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/161026/2011/07/osx_lion_review.html |title=Apple OS X Lion |newspaper=Macworld |date=July 20, 2011 |last=Snell |first=Jason}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[guardian.co.uk]] called Lion a substantial improvement from its predecessors, and considered it a &quot;steal&quot; given its price.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=July 21, 2011 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/jul/20/mac-osx-lion-review |title=Mac OS X Lion: in-depth review with pictures |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=July 20, 2011 |last=Gemmell |first=Matt }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, ''[[Gizmodo]]'' stated that the new interface &quot;feels like a failure&quot; and concluded by saying that &quot;it doesn't feel like a must-have upgrade&quot;.&lt;ref name=gizmodo&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url=http://gizmodo.com/5819418/mac-os-x-lion-this-is-not-the-future-we-were-hoping-for |title=Mac OS X Lion: This Is Not the Future We Were Hoping For |publisher=[[Gizmodo]] |date=July 11, 2011 |last=Diaz |first=Jesus}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many portable Mac users have also been put off by the lower battery life they have experienced after upgrading to Lion.&lt;ref name=Apple&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=Nov 05, 2011 |url=https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3194235 |title=Lion - Horrible MacBook Pro Battery Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacBook Pro users have claimed battery life as low as 2.5 hours after the upgrade to Lion.&lt;ref name=Apple&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=Nov 05, 2011 |url=https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3194235 |title=Lion - Horrible MacBook Pro Battery Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; A temporary fix had been suggested by resetting the [[System Management Controller]] (SMC) and [[GPU switching|switching graphics]] manually.&lt;ref name=TPR&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=July 24, 2011 |url=http://www.thepunditreport.com/2011/08/revealed-mac-os-x-lion-battery-drain.html |title=Mac OS X Lion: Solution for OS X Lion battery problem  |date=August 04, 2011 |last=Anand |first=Dilin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has now unofficially promised to solve the battery problem&lt;ref name=Pundit&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=Nov 11, 2011 |url=http://www.thepunditreport.com/2011/11/apple-preparing-to-address-macbook-pro-battery-issues.html |title=Apple preparing to address MacBook Pro Battery Issues  |date=November 11, 2011 |last=Anand |first=Dilin}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and has reached out to MacBook Pro users at the Official Apple Discussion Forums&lt;ref name=Apple&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=Nov 05, 2011 |url=https://discussions.apple.com/message/16687574#16687574 |title=Lion - Horrible MacBook Pro Battery Life}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Due to Lion's enhanced security features, including application sandboxing, Dino Dai Zovi, principal of security consultancy Trail of Bits and the coauthor (with [[Charlie Miller (security researcher)|Charles Miller]]) of ''The Mac Hacker's Handbook'', characterized Lion's security as &quot;a significant improvement, and the best way that I've described the level of security in Lion is that it's Windows 7, plus, plus. I generally tell Mac users that if they care about security, they should upgrade to Lion sooner rather than later, and the same goes for Windows users, too.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;elreg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/07/21/mac_os_x_lion_security/ |title= Major overhaul makes OS X Lion king of security|newspaper=[[The Register]] |first=Dan |last=Goodin |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=July 23, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Software incompatibilities==

* Applications depending on Rosetta, such as [[Microsoft Office|Office for Mac 2004]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2586538 Known issues with Office for Mac on Mac OS 10.7 (Lion)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Quicken|Quicken for Mac 2007]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macworld.com/article/160497/2011/06/lions_nixrosetta.html Lion and the Rosetta dead-end]&lt;/ref&gt; are no longer supported. This affects applications listed as ''Classic'' or ''PowerPC'' in [[System Profiler]].
* Unix package managers for Mac OS X such as [[Fink]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://comments.gmane.org/gmane.os.apple.fink.core/2351 Plans for Lion]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MacPorts]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.macports.org/wiki/Migration Migrating a MacPorts install to a new major OS version or CPU architecture]&lt;/ref&gt; require reinstalling and then running [[Xcode]]. Many core packages have yet to be successfully ported to Lion.&lt;ref&gt;[https://trac.macports.org/wiki/LionProblems Lion Problems]&lt;/ref&gt;
