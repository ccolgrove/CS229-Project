'''Monty Hoyt''' (September 13, 1944 in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] â October 9, 1997 in [[Phoenix, Arizona]]) was an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]].  He was the [[United States Figure Skating Championships|1962 U.S. national champion]], the 1961 Junior national champion, and the 1959 Novice national champion. He represented the [[United States at the 1964 Winter Olympics]], where he placed 10th.

After winning the U.S. junior title in 1961, Hoyt had tickets to be on [[Sabena Flight 548]] to attend the [[World Figure Skating Championships]].  He cancelled at the last moment, and so was not on the flight when the plane crashed, killing everyone aboard.  

Hoyt graduated from the [[University of Denver]] and was a [[Marshall scholar]] at [[Oxford]]. Later in life, Hoyt was a member of the [[Presidential Commission on Olympic Sports]]. He died of [[melanoma]] at age 53.
