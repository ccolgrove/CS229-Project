'''Adobe Acrobat''' is a family of [[application software]] developed by [[Adobe Systems]] to view, create, manipulate, print and manage files in [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobat/
 |title=Adobe Acrobat family
 |year=2008
 |accessdate=2008-01-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; All members of the family, except '''Adobe Reader''' (formerly Acrobat Reader), are commercial software, while the latter is available as [[freeware]] and can be downloaded from Adobe's web site. Adobe Reader enables users to view and print PDF files but has negligible PDF creation capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.adobe.com/products/reader/
 |title=Adobe Reader
 |year=2008
 |accessdate=2008-01-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Acrobat and Reader are widely used as a way to present information with a fixed layout similar to a paper publication.

==History==
Since the early 1990s, the Acrobat product has had several competitors, some of which used their own document formats, such as:

* AnyView from Binar Graphics
* Common Ground from No Hands Software
* [[Envoy (WordPerfect)|Envoy]] from [[WordPerfect|WordPerfect Corporation]]
* Folio from [[Folio Corporation|NextPage]]
* Replica from [[Farallon Computing]]
* WorldView from [[Interleaf]]
* [[DjVu]] from [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]]/[http://www.djvu.org DjVu Project]/[[LizardTech]]/[http://finance.varolmak.com Varolmak]/[http://www.caminova.net Caminova]

By the late 1990s PDF had become the [[de facto]] standard, and the others had become largely historical footnotes. This in turn has led to many more competitors for Adobe Acrobat, providing both free and commercial programs that create or manipulate PDF, such as [[Ghostscript]], [[Foxit]], [[Nitro PDF]] and [[Nuance Communications]]. Adobe also allows Acrobat plug-ins to be developed by third parties, which can add extra functions within the Acrobat program.

===Product names===
[[File:Adobe Reader X logo.png|64px|thumb|Adobe Reader X [[computer icon]]]]
Adobe has changed the names of the products in the Acrobat family regularly, also splitting-up, joining, or discontinuing products. Initially, the name &quot;Acrobat&quot; was used as the parent name to a suite of products which included Acrobat Reader, Acrobat Exchange and Acrobat Distiller. Over time Acrobat Reader became Adobe Reader; and, Acrobat Exchange was simplified to Acrobat.
Between version 3 and 5, Standard and Professional versions were one product simply called Adobe Acrobat.

{{As of|December 2010}}, the current main members of the Adobe Acrobat family are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatstandard/faq.html Adobe Acrobat X Standard | FAQ]. Adobe.com (2009-07-14). Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Adobe Reader X (10.0.0)
* Adobe Acrobat X (10.0.0)
** Adobe Acrobat X Standard
** Adobe Acrobat X Pro
** Adobe Acrobat X Suite
* [[Acrobat.com]]

Unlike most other Adobe products, such as members of [[Adobe Creative Suite]], members of Adobe Acrobat family do not have icons that display two letters on a colored rectangular shape.

==Product history==
===Version 1.0===
'''Acrobat 1.0''' was originally released on 15 June 1993 for Macintosh. It was later for [[DOS]] and [[Windows 3.1]]. This was not available in single copies and was not initially free, with Acrobat Reader originally priced at $50 per user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |date= 
 |accessdate=2010-12-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a while, the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] purchased a right to distribute Reader 1.0, effectively making it seem free to those who obtained it that way.

Adobe Acrobat 1.0 included:
* Support for PDF version 1.0
* Acrobat Exchange 1.0 (included PDFWriter printer driver and Acrobat Exchange application){{clarify|post-text=What is Adobe Exchange?|date=March 2011}}
* Acrobat Distiller 1.0, a software application that creates a PDF file from a [[PostScript]] source

===Version 2.0===
'''Acrobat 2.0''' was first released in September 1994 for Windows and Macintosh. It included:

* Support for PDF version 1.1
* Acrobat Exchange 2.0{{clarify|post-text=What is Adobe Exchange?|date=March 2011}}
* Acrobat Catalog, which creates searchable indexes for PDF files. Searching required a special version of Acrobat Reader or Acrobat Exchange.

Acrobat Professional 2.0 was also released, which included Acrobat Exchange plus Distiller.  
&lt;br/&gt;Adobe also released the first Acrobat Plug-ins SDK; allowing third party developers to create plug-ins for the Acrobat Exchange application.

===Version 3.0===
'''Acrobat 3.0''' was released in November 1996. It was the first release to support [[Windows 95]], and the last to support Windows 3.1. It was also the first version to display PDF files inside web browsers, and the first to support form-filling. Later, an update to version 3.02 introduced extended forms capabilities and JavaScript. Adobe Acrobat 3.0 included:

* Support for PDF version 1.2
* A free Reader that allows searching (It was not part of the default download)
* Acrobat Catalog
* A Distiller printer driver.

===Version 4.0===
'''Acrobat 4.0''' was released in April 1999. It included:
* Support for PDF version 1.3
* Support for [[Public key infrastructure]] (PKI) and [[digital signature]]s via plug-ins

Adobe also released ''Distiller Server 4.0'', a version of Distiller for Windows, [[Linux]] and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] that is [[Volume licensing|licensed to multiple users]], as well as ''Acrobat Business Tools 4.0'', a limited version of Acrobat.

===Version 5.0===
'''Acrobat 5.0''' was released in May 2001. It included support for PDF version 1.4 and was the last version to support Windows 95. Acrobat 5.0.5 was the first to be able to run native in [[Mac OS X]], but also ran in [[Mac OS 9]].

This version did not include PDFWriter in Macintosh release.&lt;ref&gt;Adobe Systems Inc., Help file for Acrobat 5.0 wrote &quot;Note: PDFWriter is a custom install option and is supported for Windows only&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Acrobat Reader 5.1, the subsequent version of Acrobat reader supported the Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions for forms saving

Adobe also released ''Distiller Server 5.0'' and ''Acrobat Approval 5.0'', a limited version of Acrobat mainly sold to people who wanted to digitally sign PDF files or save fill-in forms.

===Version 6.0===
'''Acrobat 6.0''' was released in July 2003. This version introduced significant changes to the family of Adobe Acrobat:
* Adobe Acrobat Standard 6.0 was released. It is a limited version of Acrobat Professional that includes Distiller but lacks Adobe Catalog, form design features and pre-press support.
* Adobe Acrobat Elements 6.0 was introduced. It enabled PDF creation but was aimed at the corporate market and was only [[Volume licensing|volume-licensed]] for a minimum of 1000 licenses. It was available for Microsoft Windows only.
* Acrobat Elements Server 6.0, a server software version of Acrobat Elements, was introduced.
* Adobe Acrobat Reader was renamed Adobe Reader.
* ''Distiller'' printer driver was renamed ''Adobe PDF''.
* PDFWriter was discontinued. PDFWriter was a printer driver used to create PDF files. It was discontinued in favor of the Adobe PDF printer driver to Distiller.
* A new version of Adobe Catalog was included, which was not compatible with earlier products for searching.
* Support for many operating system was dropped. Mac OS 9 was no longer supported. No version of Adobe Acrobat for Linux or [[Unix]] was released. Adobe Acrobat Standard did not support Windows 95 and [[Windows 98]], although it supported [[Windows 98 SE]]. Adobe Acrobat Professional ceased to support Windows 95, Windows 98 and [[Windows Me]].

This version included:
* Support for PDF version 1.5
* Support for PKI (without a plug-in) via [[Microsoft CryptoAPI]]
* Support &quot;Reader enabling&quot;, allowing Adobe Reader to save, sign or annotate PDF files if the PDF file allowed

Version 6 of the application was criticized for its performance. Adobe Acrobat 6 is slow to load and use. The Acrobat 6 plug-ins for web browsers was also criticized for suffering from low performance and potentially rendering one's web browser non-responsive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Version 7.0===
'''Adobe Acrobat 7.0''' was released in January 2005:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |title=Press Room
 |publisher=Adobe Systems

 |accessdate=4 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first version to include a mandatory [[product activation]]. It included:

* Support for PDF version 1.6
* Support for Adobe Policy Server rights management
* Support for embed [[3D computer graphics|3D]] object information from the .u3d [[Universal 3D]] format

The Adobe Acrobat 7 family saw multiple changes. Adobe Acrobat 7 Professional for Windows now included [[Adobe LiveCycle Designer]] 7.0. Adobe Elements 7.0 was also released which was still only sold through volume licensing outlet but dropped the minimum licenses limit to 100 licenses. Finally, another edition of Adobe Acrobat, Acrobat 3D, was added to the family.

Adobe Acrobat 3D included all of the functionality of Acrobat Professional 7.0 as well as updated support for embedded 3D computer graphics, tools for capturing 3D content from [[OpenGL]] applications, and the Adobe Acrobat 3D Toolkit for converting CAD documents to PDF objects. Also included is a version of the capture tool for installation on Unix.

Acrobat 7 further dropped support for Windows 98 Second Edition and Windows Me. However, Adobe released editions of Adobe Reader for Linux, Solaris ([[SPARC]] only), [[HP-UX]] and [[IBM AIX]].

===Version 8.0===
[[File:acroread.png|thumb|Adobe Reader 8 running on [[Windows Vista]]]]
'''Adobe Acrobat 8.0''' was released in November 2006:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |month = September
 |accessdate=4 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; It included:
* Support for PDF version 1.7
* Acrobat 8 Elements, which was withdrawn before its expected release in mid-2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/products/acrobatpro/acrobatel_faq.html Adobe â Acrobat 7 Elements : FAQ]{{dead link|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But it is bundled with RoboHelp 7 as a Distiller prompting that the product had been finished.
* Acrobat Connect (formerly [[Macromedia Breeze]]), a support application and an online personal meeting rooms to collaborate in real time for up to 15 participants

A later update 8.1 on June 2007 was released in order to support [[Microsoft Office 2007]], [[Windows Vista]], and [[64-bit]] Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=4 December 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in September 2007, Adobe Reader 8.1.1 released for Linux and Solaris (SPARC) users.

Adobe Acrobat 8 family saw a handful of changes. Acrobat 3D was now able to produce embedded [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] file format, a highly compressed format for geometry and graphics which requires Reader 8.1 to display. It also supported [[Product Manufacturing Information]] and many different CAD formats.

Acrobat Connect Professional (formerly Macromedia Breeze) was also added to the family. It allowed scalable interactive web conferencing and multiple personal meeting rooms for everyone across an enterprise.

The Mac OS X version of Adobe Acrobat Pro saw a significant favor: Adobe Acrobat for Macintosh was in [[Universal binary]] and ran on both PPC and Intel.

===Version 9.0===
[[File:AdobeAcrobat9win.png|250px|thumb|Adobe Acrobat 9.0 Pro Extended showing the Wikipedia article for Adobe Acrobat in PDF format under Windows 7]]
'''Adobe Acrobat 9.0''' was released in July 2008:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

ClearScan uses these newly created custom fonts instead of system fonts or Type1-MM.

Adobe Acrobat 9 family includes a new member: Adobe Acrobat 9 Pro Extended for Microsoft Windows. This product includes Adobe Presenter as well as the features of Acrobat 3D.

Adobe Reader 9 drops support for Adobe Reader Extensions 5 and 6 which permit Adobe Reader client software to save changes to filled-in forms in PDFs. Adobe Reader Extensions 6.1 and newer are still supported. Legacy PDFs will still be viewable, however they will open with the following warning: {{cquote|This document enables Reader capabilities that are no longer enabled in this Reader version.&lt;ref&gt;Adobe LiveCycle Reader Extensions ES Update 1 Upgrade Center, see 'Previous generations' tab for information on the missing support [http://www.adobe.com/products/livecycle/upgrade/readerextensions.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Adobe Acrobat 9 family also dropped the [[multiple document interface]]. Previous versions of Adobe Acrobat opened multiple PDF files in the same window. Acrobat 9 however, only supports the [[single document interface]] scheme, wherein each PDF file is opened in an instance of Adobe Acrobat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Internationalization and localization==
===Language availability===
Adobe Acrobat is available in the following languages: Arabic, Chinese Simplified, Chinese Traditional, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hungarian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe Systems]]' [[internationalization and localization]] partner. Adobe Reader is also available in Catalan as of version 9.1.

===Specific features for Arabic and Hebrew languages===
The Arabic and Hebrew versions are specifically developed for these specific languages, which are normally written [[right-to-left]]. These versions come with special TouchUp properties to handle digits, ligatures option and paragraph direction in right-to-left Middle Eastern scripts such as Arabic, Hebrew, and Persian, as well as standard left-to-right Indian scripts such as Devanagari and Gujarati. The Web Capture feature can convert single web pages or entire web sites into PDF files, while preserving the content's original text encoding. Acrobat can also copy Arabic and Hebrew text to the system [[clipboard (software)|clipboard]] in its original encoding; if the target application also supports the text encoding, then the text will appear in the correct script.

==Security==
The latest security bulletins from Adobe are published on their ''Security bulletins and advisories'' page&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/support/security/]&lt;/ref&gt;

From Version 3.02 onwards, Acrobat Reader (now Adobe Reader) has included support for [[JavaScript]]. This functionality allows the document creator to include code which executes when the document is read. While JavaScript is designed without direct access to the file system to make it &quot;safe&quot;, vulnerabilities have been reported for abuses such as distributing malicious code through Acrobat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
