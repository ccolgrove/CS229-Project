'''Brisbane Magistrates Court''' is located at 363 George Street, [[Brisbane]] in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. 

The building is a modern, purpose-built facility which currently contains 26 courtrooms. These include a dedicated Murri Court, two Coroners courts and four Small Claims hearing rooms.&lt;ref name=beattie&gt;{{Cite news | edition = J - Generic Tabloid | page = 2 | last = Beattie | first = Peter |authorlink = Peter Beattie | title = Investment in law and order | work = [[The Courier-Mail]] | date = 2004-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=welford&gt;{{Cite news | edition = J - Generic Tabloid | page = 2 | last = Welford | first = Rod |authorlink = Rod Welford | title = Busy court is the place to be heard | work = [[The Courier-Mail]] | date = 2004-11-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;The building has the capacity to expand to 39 courtrooms.&lt;ref name=welford /&gt;

Construction started in September 2002 and the building was opened on 16 November 2004 by the Queensland Premier, Peter Beattie. The total budget for the project was $135.5m.

The building was designed to provide improved support for victims and their families, and to vulnerable witnesses.

It also contains a range of environmentally sustainable design initiatives including economy-cycle air conditioning, energy efficient lighting, rainwater tanks that hold 46 000 litres of water for use on external landscaping, motion sensors that lower air-conditioning and lighting when rooms are unoccupied, extensive use of passive sun control and low energy glass, solar hot water, and waste streaming systems.

==Public Art==
The Brisbane Magistrates Court is one of the largest infrastructure projects to incorporate the Queensland Government's Art Built-in policy, which requires two per cent of the capital works budget to be spent on art projects within the development.

The building features a range of public artworks including sculptures, murals and paintings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | edition = 2 - State - Main Country | page = 39 | last = Giles | first = Darrell | title = Legal eagles get thrown a curly one | work = [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)|The Sunday Mail]] | date = 2004-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
