'''Sylvia Robinson''' (March 6, 1936 â September 29, 2011) was an [[United States|American]] [[singer]], [[musician]], [[record producer]], and [[record label]] [[Senior management|executive]], most notably known for her work as founder/CEO of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] label [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]]. She is credited as the driving force behind two landmark singles in the genre. The first was &quot;[[Rapper's Delight]]&quot; by the [[Sugarhill Gang]], which was the first rap song to be released by a hip hop act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rapper's Delight'|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1116242|quote=The story goes that Big Bank Hank, Wonder Mike and Master Gee met Sylvia Robinson on a Friday and recorded &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot; the following Monday in just one take.|work=[[National Public Radio]]|date=December 29, 2000|accessdate=2010-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was [[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|&quot;The Message]]&quot; by Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five.

==Biography==
She was born as '''Sylvia Vanderpool''' (aka Vanterpool&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cashboxmagazine.com/news548.html|title=Sylvia Robinson|publisher=Cashbox Magazine News|accessdate=2011-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in 1936 in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/30/arts/music/sylvia-robinson-pioneering-producer-of-hip-hop-dies-at-75.html?_r=1 |title=Sylvia Robinson, Pioneering Producer of Hip-Hop, Is Dead at 75 |author=James C. McKinley Jr. |date=September 30, 2011 |work=The New York Times |publisher=The New York Times Company |accessdate=October 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began recording music in 1950 for [[Columbia Records]] under the billing, '''Little Sylvia'''. In 1954, she began teaming up with [[Kentucky]] guitarist [[Mickey Baker]], who then taught her how to play guitar. In 1956, the duo now known as [[Mickey &amp; Sylvia]], recorded the [[Bo Diddley]] and [[Jody Williams (blues musician)|Jody Williams]]-penned rock single, &quot;[[Love is Strange]]&quot;, which topped the R&amp;B charts and reached number eleven on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' pop charts in early 1957.  After several more releases including the modestly successful &quot;There Oughta Be a Law&quot;, Mickey &amp; Sylvia split up in 1959 with Sylvia later marrying Joe Robinson that same year. Sylvia re-started her solo career shortly after her initial split from Baker.  In 1961, the duo reunited and recorded more songs together for various labels.  They're most noted during this period for singing background on [[Ike &amp; Tina Turner]]'s hit single, &quot;[[It's Gonna Work Out Fine]]&quot;.  In 1964, frustrated with the music business, Baker moved to [[Paris]]. 

In 1966, the Robinsons moved to [[New Jersey]] where they formed a soul music label, [[All Platinum Records]], the following year, with artist Lezli Valentine, formerly of the Jaynettes, bringing the label its first hit with &quot;I Won't Do Anything&quot;. In 1968, the duo signed a [[Washington, D.C.]] act named [[The Moments]], who immediately found success with &quot;Not on the Outside&quot;. Within a couple of years and with a new lineup, the group scored their biggest hit with &quot;[[Love on a Two-Way Street]]&quot;, which Sylvia co-wrote and produced with Burt Keyes and (uncredited) lyrics by Lezli Valentine. Other hits the label and its subsidiaries, including Stang and Vibration, would have included [[Shirley &amp; Company]]'s &quot;[[Shame, Shame, Shame (Shirley &amp; Company song)|Shame, Shame, Shame]]&quot;, the Moments' &quot;Sexy Mama&quot; and &quot;Look at Me I'm in Love&quot; and the Whatnauts/Moments collaboration, &quot;Girls&quot;. In 1972, Robinson sent a demo of a song she had written called &quot;[[Pillow Talk (song)|Pillow Talk]]&quot; to [[Al Green]]. When Green passed on it due to his religious beliefs,&lt;ref name=&quot;The Book of Golden Discs&quot;/&gt; Robinson decided to record it herself, returning to her own musical career. Billed under simply ''Sylvia'', the record became an instant hit reaching number-one on the R&amp;B charts and crossing over to reach Billboard Hot 100 #3, plus also reaching #14 in the UK at the beginning of 1973.  She was awarded a [[music recording sales certification|gold disc]] by the [[R.I.A.A.]] in May 1973.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Book of Golden Discs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|first=Joseph|last=Murrells|year=1978|title=The Book of Golden Discs|edition=2nd|publisher=Barrie and Jenkins Ltd.|location=London|page=338|isbn=0-214-20512-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson would record four solo albums on the Vibration subsidiary&lt;ref&gt;Billboard Book of Top 40 Hits, 7th edition by Joel Whitburn; ISBN 0-8230-7690-3 (pg. 619)&lt;/ref&gt; and had other R&amp;B hits including &quot;Sweet Stuff&quot; and &quot;Pussycat&quot;. &quot;Pillow Talk&quot; has been called an early example of [[prototype|prototypical]] [[disco|disco music]] and went on to sell two million copies. The vocals are replete with moaning and heavy breathing, predating [[Donna Summer]]'s orgasmic moans on &quot;[[Love to Love You Baby (song)|Love to Love You Baby]]&quot;. The drumming rhythm would reappear in 1985 on [[Kate Bush]]'s &quot;[[Running Up that Hill]]&quot;, then again in 1987 on [[Fleetwood Mac]]'s &quot;[[Big Love (Fleetwood Mac song)|Big Love]]&quot;.

In the 1970s, the Robinsons founded [[Sugar Hill Records (rap)|Sugar Hill Records]]. The company was named after the culturally rich [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]] area of Harlem, an affluent African American neighborhood in Manhattan New York City, known as a hub for artists and performers in the early and mid 1900s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nymag.com/realestate/articles/neighborhoods/harlem.htm|title=Harlem - New York City Neighborhood - NYC|publisher=nymag.com|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ny.com/sights/neighborhoods/harlem.html|title=Harlem, Hamilton Heights, El Barrio, New York City|publisher=ny.com|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

She co-wrote and produced [[Grandmaster Flash &amp; the Furious Five]]'s most successful single, [[The Message (Grandmaster Flash and the Furious Five song)|&quot;The Message&quot;]], which is credited as the rap song that brought socially conscious lyrics into hip hop. She persuaded the group to record the song while it was still an estranged demo recording, surprisingly created by a studio percussionist for the Sugar Hill Gang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldschoolhiphop.com/artists/emcees/dukebootee.htm|title=Duke Bootee Biography|publisher=OldSchoolHipHop.com|date=2010-01-07|accessdate=2011-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; By commercializing the market for rap records, Robinson is credited as the mother of modern [[hip-hop]]. The song &quot;Rapper's Delight&quot; brought rap into the public music arena, and revolutionized the music industry as it introduced the idea of re-using existing compositions, a practice that later became known as &quot;[[Sampling (music)|sampling]]&quot;. {{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} . Sylvia's song, &quot;Sunday&quot;, was [[Sunday (The Day Before My Birthday)|sampled]] by [[Moby]] in his 2002 album ''[[18 (Moby album)|18]]''. Later acts signed to [[Sugar Hill Records]] included all-female rap/funk group [[The Sequence]], featuring a teenage [[Angie Stone]] (recording as &quot;Angie B&quot;), who had a million-selling hit in early 1980 with &quot;Funk U Up&quot;.

After Sugar Hill folded due to changes in the music industry and the presences of hip-hop labels [[Prelude Records|Prelude]] and [[Def Jam Records|Def Jam]] and due to financial pressures in 1985, Robinson, who had by now divorced Joe Robinson, continued her efforts as a music executive, forming Bon Ami Records in 1987. The label was noted for signing the act The New Style, who later left and found success as [[Naughty by Nature]].

Robinson died on the morning of September 29, 2011, aged 75, at Meadowlands Hospital in [[Secaucus, New Jersey]] from congestive [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name=&quot;The New York Times&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Tracy Scott|title='Sylvia Robinson, mother of Hip Hop, dead'|url=http://www.s2smagazine.com/stories/2011/09/sylvia-robinson-mother-hip-hop-dead|quote=Sylvia Vanterpool Robinson, 75, often credited as the Mother of Hip-Hop, died today at 6:28 a.m. EST from congestive heart failure.|work=s2smagazine.com|date=September 29, 2011|accessdate=2011-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
