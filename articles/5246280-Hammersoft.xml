The '''Universal Channel''' is a television channel owned by [[NBCUniversal]].

The channel mainly broadcasts [[United States]] imports including drama series and TV movies such as ''[[House (TV series)|House MD]]'' and ''[[Law &amp; Order]]''. However the channel also screens British dramas including ''[[Hustle (TV series)|Hustle]]'' and ''[[Spooks]]'', and Australian series like ''[[Sea Patrol (TV series)|Sea Patrol]]'' and ''[[McLeod's Daughters]]''. The channel specialises in programming that is appropriate for the whole family.

This channel is specific to audiences within the United Kingdom and the [[Republic of Ireland]].

==History==
[[File:Hallmark Channel.svg|thumb|left|The Hallmark Channel logo, used until 2010]]
The channel was previously owned by the privately-backed [[Sparrowhawk Media Group]], until late 2007 when the company was bought by NBC Universal. It was previously known as the Hallmark Entertainment Network and the Hallmark Channel.

Coinciding with the launch of Hallmark Channel HD, Hallmark Channel became [[16:9]] [[widescreen]] capable on 28 June 2010.

===2010 rebrand===
In June 2009, a memorandum leaked to the television trade newspaper ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' stated that NBC Universal planned to rebrand the Hallmark Channel as a [[Universal Channel]] in October 2009. The &quot;Hallmark Channel&quot; brand was licensed to NBC Universal from [[Crown Media]] (which operates the US [[Hallmark Channel]]) and was due to expire. An NBC Universal denied such a rebrand would happen.&lt;ref&gt;Shepherd, Robert (25 June 2009). &quot;[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/international/nbc-plans-to-ditch-hallmark-uk-brand/5002838.article NBC plans to ditch Hallmark UK brand]&quot;. ''Broadcast'' (Emap Media). Retrieved on 25 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 September 2010, Universal Networks International confirmed plans to rebrand the Hallmark Channel as the Universal Channel in the UK. On 18 October, the pay-TV channel and its timeshift and high definition variants became the Universal Channel, Universal Channel +1 and Universal Channel HD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/digitaltv/news/a271434/hallmark-channel-to-rebrand-as-universal.html|title=Hallmark Channel to rebrand as Universal|publisher=Digital Spy|date=2 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Universal Channel will give UK premieres to cop show ''[[Rookie Blue]]'' and legal drama ''[[Fairly Legal]]'' in early 2011. It will also air ''[[Shattered (2010 TV series)|Shattered]]'', which stars [[Callum Keith Rennie]] as a homicide detective suffering from multiple personality disorder.

On 1 December 2010, Universal Channel launched a specific feed which targets the [[Republic of Ireland]]. Universal Channel in Ireland airs localised advertising. The Irish feed does not include [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universalchannel.co.uk/forum/subtitles-ireland-1st-december|title=Subtitles in Ireland - From 1st December|publisher=Universal Channel|date=29 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[TV3 Ireland]] act as the Irish variation's advertising sales agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sbpost.ie/news/ireland/universal-ad-deal-secured-by-tv3-53596.html|title=Universal ad deal secured by TV3|publisher=The Irish Post|date=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hallmark 2===
In July 2005, there were rumours that Sparrowhawk were going to launch a sister channel to the Hallmark Channel, called Hallmark 2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media247.co.uk/skydigital/newsarchive/2006/03/second_hallmark.php]&lt;/ref&gt; This was denied by a spokesperson for Hallmark who said that &quot;a second channel from Hallmark will not be launching 'anytime soon'&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media247.co.uk/skydigital/newsarchive/2006/03/second_hallmark.php]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Movies 24]] was launched instead.
