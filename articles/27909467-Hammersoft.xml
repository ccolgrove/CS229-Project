Prayer: http://www.bhavanites.org/FILES/prayer.htm

=== Pledge ===
The Bhavanite pledge says:

''As the pupil of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Public School,I solemnly pledge myself to self-less service of my motherland and her culture. I shall consider no sacrifice is too great for the protection of my country and for the preservation of all that it stands for. Unto the greatness and glory of my land, I dedicate myself. It shall be my constant endeavour to realise the ideals of the Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, the basic principles of our ageless culture and to conform to the way of life prescribed by it.''

== Houses ==
The students are organised into houses, enabling growth of team-spirit by working together. The houses, named after characters from [[Hindu mythology|Hindu Mythology]], are:
* Students of Pre-Primary to UKG- '''[[Dhruva]]'''
* Students of I to V Std- '''Prahalada'''
* Students of VI to X Std, are organized into six houses:
** '''[[Abhimanyu]]'''{{pad|4em}}[[Azure (color)|Blue(Light)]]{{pad|1em}}{{Color box|#1E90FF}}
** '''[[Arjuna|Arjun]]'''{{pad|7em}}[[corn (color)|Yellow]]{{pad|2.8em}}{{color box|#FBEC5D}}
** '''[[Ashwatthama|Ashwathama]]''' {{pad|3em}}[[Orange (colour)|Orange]] {{pad|2.25em}}{{Color box|#FF4A00}}

** '''[[Vasishta]]'''{{pad|5.5em}}[[Gules|Red]] {{pad|3.55em}}{{Color box|#990000}}

Inter-house competitions are conducted in fields ranging from literary to music and dance. A Prefect is in charge of the activities of the house. The responsibility is given for a month thus giving opportunity to each student who are predominantly of class VI and above. The Captain and Vice-Captain (both girls and boys), usually elected democratically by the student pool, shoulder the responsibility of the success of the house for that academic year. They are typically students of class X who are really very dynamic leaders who take the house forward.  

Every house is assigned three teachers, a Co-Ordinator and two Wardens who over-see the functioning of the house and guide the students and their leaders. One teacher is the Overall House Co-Ordinator for that academic year.

The House Function's are held once every alternate years where students compete in Group Classical/Semi-classical singing and Performing Arts- Dramatics and Traditional Dance with Live music and singing. Students are encourage to make their own props and stage settings.

== Events ==
'''Annual day''' is celebrated in the month of March, that culminates that academic year. The principal presents the Annual Report and releases the annual school magazine. Gold-Medal awardees are congratulated by the Chief Guests for their achievements, in academics and sports.

The program culminates with cultural programs by the students.

* '''Foundation Day''' is celebrated in November. It marks the beginning of the academic year where the Prefectorial Body, comprising the Apex Body and House Captains, is sworn in.
