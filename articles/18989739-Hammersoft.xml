==Aircraft terminology==
Information on aircraft gives the type, and if available, the serial number of the operator in italics, the constructors number, also known as the manufacturer's serial number (c/n), exterior codes in apostrophes, nicknames (if any) in quotation marks, flight callsign in italics, and operating units.

==2000==
*8 April - A [[Bell-Boeing V-22 Osprey|Bell-Boeing MV-22B Osprey]] [[tiltrotor]] prototype, BuNo ''165436'', coded 'MX-04', of [[HMX-1]], rolls over and crashes during a rapid descent to land at [[Marana Northwest Regional Airport]], [[Marana, Arizona]], United States, killing all 19 [[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] on board. Cause of crash was pilot losing control due to high vertical rate of descent causing vortex ring state. MV-22B, BuNo ''165433'', (which was also taking part in the exercise) landed heavily when the resulting explosion blew out its ground cushion. It was struck off charge on 16 July 2001.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.targetlock.org.uk/osprey/development.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*19 April - A [[Rwandan Air Force]] [[Antonov An-8]], ''TL-ACM'', chartered from [[Central African Airlines]], crashes near [[Pepa, Democratic Republic of the Congo]] after engine failure caused by a suspected [[bird strike]].

*7 September - A [[Sikorsky Aircraft|Sikorsky]] [[MH-53 Pave Low|MH-53M Pave Low IV]], ''69-05794'', of the [[20th Special Operations Squadron]], [[Hurlburt Field]], crashes near [[Duke Field]], Eglin Auxiliary Field 3, just before midnight when it suffers tail rotor gear box failure while in a hover.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foia.af.mil/shared/media/document/AFD-090731-041.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The helicopter was practicing a rescue extraction near a landing zone surrounded by trees more than {{convert|90|ft|m}} tall and had just been brought into a hover at {{convert|150|ft|m}} and was beginning to lower the rescue apparatus when the aircrew felt a shudder. Aircraft commander Lt. Col. Eugene Becker realizes that the tail rotor gears are failing, takes control of the aircraft and prepares to land. Once out of hover, it takes about 45 seconds to return to the LZ, and due to the confined space, Becker drops the chopper vertically but the shuddering worsens. &quot;We knew something was very, very wrong&quot;, stated Becker. &quot;all of the gear boxes were surging up and down and making quite a bit of racket.&quot; When the MH-53 is {{convert|20|ft|m}} above the ground Becker pushes what is left of the rotor's power to the maximum in order to cushion the landing. As soon as the Pave Low hits the ground, the tail rotor fails and the chopper starts spinning and rolls to port, but the sponson fuel tanks keep it from rolling over. Of the seven crew, only two are injured: Col. William Nelson, a flight surgeon from the Air Force Special Operations Command Surgeon General's Office, receives a head injury but walks away from the accident; MH-53 aerial gunner A1C Bradley Jordan suffers a leg fracture. Both men are released from hospital the following day. Lt. Col. Becker is awarded the Koren Kolligian Jr. trophy, one of the Air Force's top safety awards, in July 2008. According to the award nomination, a landing any more forceful could have been fatal to the crew.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Mona, &quot;''Pilot of crash MH-53 receives safety award''&quot;, The Eglin Dispatch, Northwest Florida Daily News, Fort Walton Beach, Florida, Friday, 18 July 2008, Volume 2, Number 29, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt;
