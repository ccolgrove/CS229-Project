'''Helocasting''' is an airborne technique used by small unit, [[special operations forces]] to insert into a military [[area of operations]]. The small unit is flown, by [[helicopter]], to the insertion point.  Once there, the aircraft assumes an altitude just above the water's surface and an airspeed of {{convert|10|kn|km/h}} or less. Team members then exit the aircraft and enter the water.

In some cases, depending upon the mission parameters and the aircraft used, personnel may be inserted along with a [[inflatable boat]] for over-the-horizon operations. When a fully inflated boat is transported and inserted with personnel, this type of operation is known as a &quot;hard duck&quot;. In cases where a fully inflated boat cannot be accommodated by the aircraft, it can be partially deflated for transit and inflated at the insertion point by means of a foot pump. This type of operation is known as a &quot;soft duck&quot;. If inflation to any degree is not feasible, a &quot;rolled duck&quot; may be performed.

Once team members are in the water, they may swim to the objective or, in the case of a &quot;hard duck&quot;, &quot;soft duck&quot;, or &quot;rolled duck&quot;, conduct an over-the-horizon transit to the objective, via inflatable boat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.okinawa.usmc.mil/public%20affairs%20info/archive%20news%20pages/2006/060512-recon.html |first=W.
