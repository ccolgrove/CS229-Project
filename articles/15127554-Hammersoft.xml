==Rivalries==
===Active rivalries===
====Fresno State Bulldogs====
[[File:Techfresnofight.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Fresno St.âLA Tech pregame clash in 2004]]
{{main|Battle for the Bone}}
Since 2001, the teams have played annually as members of the [[Western Athletic Conference]], and Fresno State holds a 7â4 series lead in games played as WAC foes. The rivalry is nicknamed the [[Battle for the Bone]], a term coined because both universities are nicknamed the Bulldogs. Prior to the conference rivalry, the two Bulldog football teams played twice in Fresno with Fresno State defeating Louisiana Tech in 1986 and 1992.

Notable games include:
*In 2004, No. 17 Fresno State entered the game undefeated as the first ever ranked opponent to enter [[Joe Aillet Stadium]] in Ruston. Prior to the opening kickoff, a sideline clearing altercation occurred on the field with the coaches and security having to separate the two teams. Led by [[Ryan Moats]] who rushed for 236 yards and 4 touchdowns, LA Tech went on to notch their first ever victory over Fresno State 28â21. At the conclusion of the game, the LA Tech fans rushed the field and brought down the goalposts.
*In 2005, LA Tech jumped out to a 26-3 halftime lead to shock No. 23 Fresno State at [[Bulldog Stadium]] in Fresno. LA Tech went on to win 40-28 and denied Fresno State their first WAC Championship since 1999.

{{rquote|right|We look forward to renewing our series with Louisiana Tech, one of our oldest rivalries in terms of games, and a quality opponent in the [[Western Athletic Conference]].|Southern Miss Athletics Director Richard Giannini in 2008}}
LA Tech and [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]] first played in 1935 and played each season from 1946 until 1972. LA Tech and USM were conference foes in the [[Southern Intercollegiate Athletic Association]] from 1935 to 1941. In addition, LA Tech and USM were both founding members of the Gulf States Conference which began play in 1948. The Dawgs and Eagles have played 11 times between 1975 and 1992. In 2008, LA Tech AD/HC [[Derek Dooley (American football)|Derek Dooley]] and USM AD Richard Giannini signed a 4-game contract to renew the rivalry with the first game being played in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] on September 25, 2010. On a rainy Saturday night on September 3, 2011, the Golden Eagles took on the Bulldogs for both team's season opener on national television. The close matchup ended in Southern Miss' favor, 19-17, due to a late field goal by Southern Miss' Danny Hrapmann. The Dawgs and Eagles are scheduled to continue the series in Ruston 2013, and in [[Hattiesburg, Mississippi|Hattiesburg]] 2014.

===Inactive rivalries===
Historical rivalries that are no longer active include series with [[Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns football|Southwestern Louisiana]] (now Louisiana-Lafayette), [[ULM Warhawks|Northeast Louisiana]] (now Louisiana-Monroe), and [[Northwestern State Demons|Northwestern State]]. LA Tech sacrificed these rivalries to seek a more elite conference affiliation and greater national prominence for their programs.

====Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns====
LA Tech and [[Louisiana-Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns football|Southwestern Louisiana]] first played in 1910 and competed annually between 1924 and 2000. The Bulldogs and Cajuns have only played twice since LA Tech joined the WAC in 2001. LA Tech has won the last 6 games of the series outscoring ULL by a combined total of 287â106 in those 6 games from 1997-2004.

The Bulldogs and the Cajuns will play a home-and-home series in 2014 and 2015. The first game in the series will be played at Lafayette in October 2014, and the second game will be played at Joe Aillet Stadium in Ruston in October 2015.

==Home stadiums==
===Joe Aillet Stadium===
[[File:Joeailletstadium.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Joe Aillet Stadium]]
{{main|Joe Aillet Stadium}}
LA Tech plays home games in [[Joe Aillet Stadium]], which has garnered the nickname ''The Joe''. The stadium is located on the campus of [[Louisiana Tech University]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana]]. Led by quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]], the Bulldogs christened ''Louisiana Tech Stadium'' with a 35â7 victory over [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina]] on September 28, 1968. The stadium was given its current namesake in 1972 to honor Hall of Fame coach [[Joe Aillet]]. The stadium opened with a capacity of 23,000, and additional seating was added to increase capacity to 30,600 in 1989. The stadium was upgraded in 1985 with the addition of the luxury sky box. In 1997, the stadium's attendance record of 28,714 was set against [[ULM Warhawks football|Louisiana-Monroe]]. A new lighting system was installed in 2006. In 2008, LA Tech installed the stadium's current [[FieldTurf]]. Installed in 2009, Joe Aillet Stadium boasts the largest high definition video board in the [[Western Athletic Conference]] covering 1,485 digital square feet. On June 29, 2010, Louisiana Tech unveiled the plans for the ''Quest for Excellence'', a $20 million fundraising campaign geared towards the construction of a 90,000-plus square-foot multipurpose facility in the south end zone of Joe Aillet Stadium.

===Independence Stadium===
[[File:Independencestadium.png|thumb|right|350px|2008 Independence Bowl â LA Tech 17, NIU 10]]
{{main|Independence Stadium (United States)}}
LA Tech occasionally hosts games at [[Independence Stadium (United States)|Independence Stadium]] in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]]. The Bulldogs have played 71 games in Independence Stadium including 4 trips to the [[Independence Bowl]] and have produced an all-time record of 46â22â3 at Independence Stadium. LA Tech has hosted many teams in Independence Stadium during the regular season including [[Southern Miss Golden Eagles football|Southern Miss]], [[North Texas Mean Green football|North Texas]], [[Tulsa Golden Hurricane football|Tulsa]], [[Houston Cougars football|Houston]], [[Baylor Bears football|Baylor]], [[California Golden Bears football|California]], [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]], [[SMU Mustangs football|SMU]], [[Oklahoma State Cowboys football|Oklahoma State]], [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]], and [[UTEP Miners football|UTEP]]. Louisiana Tech's regular season home attendance record of 43,279 was set in 2003 against the [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami Hurricanes]] in a nationally televised game on [[ESPN]]. The [[1990 Independence Bowl]] featuring LA Tech and [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland]] drew 48,325 fans, the record attendance for a Louisiana Tech game in Independence Stadium. The stadium's capacity is 50,459. Louisiana Tech opened the [[2010 Louisiana Tech Bulldogs football team|2010 season]] at Independence Stadium against [[Grambling State Tigers football|Grambling State]] in the inaugural Port City Classic for the first ever meeting between the two football programs despite being located only {{convert|4|mi|km}} apart.

==Traditions==
{{main|Traditions of Louisiana Tech University}}

===Band of Pride===
{{main|Band of Pride}}
The Band of Pride is the official marching band of [[Louisiana Tech University]]. Since its inception in 1906, the band has grown to approximately 200 members. The Band of Pride performs at all home football games, select road games, pep rallies, and various university events throughout the year.

===Spirit of '88===
[[File:Spiritof88.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The Spirit of '88 Bulldog]]
At the south end of [[Joe Aillet Stadium]] stands a bronze Bulldog statue named the Spirit of '88. The statue commemorates the 1988 Bulldog football team which blazed the path into Division I-A football for [[Louisiana Tech University|Louisiana Tech]]. The 1988 team had to endure one of the most difficult schedules in school history while playing with only 65 scholarships - the allotted amount for Division I-AA teams. In what was the nation's 11th toughest schedule that year, the Bulldogs faced five I-A bowl teams including [[University of Houston|Houston]], [[Florida State University|Florida State]] and [[Texas A&amp;M University|Texas A&amp;M]]. The results were as expected: losses like 60-0, 56-17 and 66-3. Those experiences likely played a key role in LA Tech finishing 5-4-1 the following year, its first in Division I-A, and then 8-3-1 in 1990 and an [[Independence Bowl]] berth. The statue, which every Bulldog player touches as he walks down the ramp before every home game, has also brought good fortune to the Bulldogs at [[Joe Aillet Stadium]]. On October 14, 1989, when it was unveiled, LA Tech proceeded to pummel a highly respected [[Northern Illinois University|Northern Illinois]] team by the score of 42-21. The Bulldogs eventually reeled off 18 consecutive home victories, tying the all-time stadium record set by head coach [[Maxie Lambright]]'s great teams of the early 1970s.

===Fire Bell===
[[File:Latechfirebell.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Fire Bell and Tech XX]]
In [[1879]], the Fire Bell was cast by L.M. Rumsey &amp; Co. in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. Founded in [[1897]], the Ruston Fire Department was called to fires by ringing the Fire Bell that hung in a wooden tower behind Perkins Drug Store located at 116 N. Trenton Street. The Fire Bell was used for many years in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] to alert the town of burning fires. After [[Joe Aillet Stadium]] was built in [[1968]], the old Fire Bell was transported to the stadium atop the hill in the south end zone. The Fire Bell is rung before every football game to commemorate the bravery of the bulldog that perished saving the lives of the two Tech students in the burning house in [[1899]], and the Fire Bell calls the Bulldogs to battle before every home football game.

===Tech XX===
{{main|Tech (mascot)}}
Tech is the name of the fawn and white lineage of [[bulldog|English bulldogs]], which serves as the live mascot of [[Louisiana Tech University]]. Tech is owned by the LA Tech [[Students' union|Student Government Association]] and resides with either a faculty member or local alumnus selected by the SGA. After surviving a [[heat illness|heat stroke]] in September 2007, Tech XIX was soon retired in November. On January 22, 2008, Tech XX was officially installed as the new official mascot and debuted at [[Louisiana Tech Bulldogs basketball|LA Tech's men's basketball]] game against [[Nevada Wolf Pack men's basketball|Nevada]] on January 26, 2008. Tech XX was born in [[Licking, Missouri]], on October 9, 2007, and is the son of Kahuna Mighty Sampson and Abbie Jane Kofax. Tech XX is in the care of [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] [[veterinarian]] and Tech alumnus Dr. Patrick Sexton. Tech XX led Louisiana Tech to become [[2008 Independence Bowl|Independence Bowl]] champions in his inaugural season as mascot.

===GATA===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Gatagods.jpg|thumb|right|150px|GATA gods Terry Bradshaw and Fred Dean]] --&gt;
On August 30, 2008, [[Mississippi State University|Mississippi State]] became the first current member of the [[Southeastern Conference]] to play [[Louisiana Tech University|Louisiana Tech]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] at [[Joe Aillet Stadium]]. Prior to the game, four stadium banners were mounted on both the east and west sides honoring four Louisiana Tech Hall of Fame inductees including [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Fred Dean]], [[Willie Roaf]], and Coach [[Joe Aillet]]. After the team arrived to the stadium for their season opener, they saw the imposing banners for the first time. In the locker room, the team determined that the legends pictured on the banners were the bulldog football team's ultimate GATA gods. GATA was the acronym for defensive coordinator Tommy Spangler's defensive philosophy: Get After Their A__. The GATA gods helped the Louisiana Tech Bulldogs do just that by guiding LA Tech to a 22-14 victory over Mississippi State, LA Tech's first win over an SEC opponent since the Bulldogs beat No. 18 [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] in 1999. Throughout the season, the GATA gods helped the Bulldog football team form a special cohesiveness and camaraderie as Tech won their first five games under their watch. On defensive third downs, chants of ''GA-TA! GA-TA!'' echo throughout [[Joe Aillet Stadium]]. The success brought by the GATA gods rallied Louisiana Tech to their most wins since 1999 (8), first bowl appearance since 2001, and first bowl victory since 1977 becoming [[2008 Independence Bowl]] Champions.

===Louisiana Tech Football Day===
[[File:Louisianatechfootballday.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Dooley receiving Jindal's Louisiana Tech Football Day proclamation]]
After LA Tech accepted an invitation to play in the [[2008 Independence Bowl]], Louisiana Governor [[Bobby Jindal]] issued a proclamation declaring [[December 19]] as ''Louisiana Tech Football Day'' in the State of [[Louisiana]]. The proclamation was delivered to athletics director/head football coach [[Derek Dooley (American football coach)|Derek Dooley]] in [[Ruston, Louisiana|Ruston]] by Louisiana Representative [[Henry Burns]] and Louisiana Representative [[Robert Kostelka]] on December 19, 2008.

The proclamation states:

''WHEREAS, the Bulldogs will play in the [[Independence Bowl]] on December 28, 2008, in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], and&lt;br/&gt;

''WHEREAS, Louisiana understands the team's [[commitment]] and appreciates their hard work and [[dedication]], and&lt;br/&gt;

''NOW, THEREFORE, I, Bobby Jindal, Governor of the State of Louisiana, do hereby proclaim December 19, 2008, as '''Louisiana Tech Football Day''' in the State of Louisiana.''
