&quot;'''Gulliver'''&quot;, &quot;'''Hay-Chewed'''&quot; and &quot;'''Reprise'''&quot; are three songs medleyed into one by [[Elton John]] with lyrics by [[Bernie Taupin]]. &quot;Gulliver&quot; is a real song with lyrics, &quot;Hay-Chewed&quot; is a jazz instrumental while &quot;Reprise&quot; is [[Fade (audio engineering)|fade-ins and fade-out]]s of all songs on the album.

==Musical structure of &quot;Gulliver&quot;==
This song opens with an echoed guitar before going into a bluesy piano riff. The song is very sad in tune, fitting with the lyric, getting heavier for each line. The song fades out in a heavily distorted scream at 3:08.

==Lyrical meaning of &quot;Gulliver&quot;==
The song describes a sad death of a dog. A dog that was once loved at a farm suddenly went crazy in his later years and had to be [[Animal euthanasia|shot]].

'''Hay Chewed''' &lt;br&gt; ''(3:08-4:40)''
On the 1995 reissue, this song was erroneously credited as &quot;It's Hay Chewed&quot;. The song is instrumental, opening with a saxophone riff giving the sense of jazz. The title could be a pun on &quot;[[Hey Jude]]&quot;. It segues into a bluesy guitar solo before fading into a reprise of all songs on the album.

'''Reprise''' &lt;br&gt; ''(4:40-6:59)''
&quot;Reprise&quot; is not a song ''per se'', it is merely a medley of all the songs on the album, represented by 15â20 second each, faded in and faded out. It is a very unusual feature. The song then ends the same way as &quot;Gulliver&quot;, distorting the end scream even more with more noise before cutting off at seven minutes.

==Performances==
It was never performed in any form.
