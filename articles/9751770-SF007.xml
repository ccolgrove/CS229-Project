===The Count of Champignac===
'''PacÃ´me HÃ©gÃ©sippe AdÃ©lard Ladislas de Champignac''' is an old, castle-dwelling aristocrat, genius of a [[scientist]]. He works in many fields such as chemistry, biology, physics, but most frequently he creates chemical substances from various mushrooms found in his castle's park.  These experiments may have extraordinary effects such as softening metal, allowing the body to resist water pressure, speeding or reversing the body's ageing, giving people super-strength, or even turning people black.  Also a skilled engineer, he has constructed numerous incredible machines such as individual dolphin-like submarines, and other handy gadgets. He is also proven to be a paleontologist, an astronomer and an astrophysician.

Champignac is connected to several almost as eccentric scientists who frequently visit him at the castle, bringing new inventions and experiments that often bring about troublesome consequences. Due to his overall brilliance, he has several times been the victim of [[industrial espionage]].

A wife of some time in his past has been mentioned, but no explanation of her absence was ever given. He has no children, but would eventually have a near-identical looking nephew, AurÃ©lien de Champignac (''L'horloger de la comÃ¨te'').

'''CÃ©lestin Dupilon''' is a former [[veterinarian]] of Champignac-en-Cambrousse, who after retirement has assumed the role of town alcoholic.

===Gaston Lagaffe===
{{Main|Gaston Lagaffe}}
'''Gaston Lagaffe''' first made a discrete appearance in ''Le voyageur du MÃ©sozoÃ¯que'', a slightly more noticeable appearance in ''Vacances sans histoires'', and had an active role in ''La foire aux gangsters'', before appearing in Franquin's two final Spirou adventures. He is better known as the hero of his own series, where Spirou and Fantasio appear regularly as well. Because Franquin kept the rights to this character, he hasn't appeared in any ''Spirou et Fantasio'' adventures since Franquin abandoned the series.

===John Helena===
'''John Helena''' nicknamed &quot;The Moray&quot; is a criminal character encountered in Spirou's maritime adventures. Initially introduced in ''[[Le repaire de la murÃ¨ne]]'' as &quot;the good captain&quot; of the sunk vessel ''Le Discret'', he is eventually revealed to be a hardened antagonist of the worst sort. During this adventure, he elaborates on of his nickname, describing the moray as a fish with teeth that bothers no-one unless a fool comes by to disturb (i.e. Spirou). In his final appearance in the album &quot;Virus&quot; we find him after doing his time behind bars. He redeems himself by exposing an international gang of viral arms traders. At the end of the story he has started up a tourist organisation that shows people the abandoned base where the clandestine operation took place, a changed man who's earning his money the honest way.

===Ibn-Mah-Zoud===
'''Ibn-Mah-Zoud''' is a character who  makes a strong impression, despite appearing in a single ''Spirou'' adventure: ''Vacances sans histoires''. A wealthy [[sheikh]], he suffers from colour blindness and is notoriously the world's worst driver. This is proved during the course of ''Vacances'', once he has slipped away from his driver's guardianship and mistakes Spirou and Fantasio's blue ''Turbotraction:Turbot-Rhino I'' for his own red one. Surviving the catastrophic results of his joyride, he later proves himself to be a man of honour, replacing the destroyed car with a brand new prototype ''Turbot 2''.

====Appearances====
*11.  ''Vacances sans histoires'' (in ''[[Le gorille a bonne mine]]'') (Franquin)

===Marsupilami===
{{Main|Marsupilami}}
The '''Marsupilami''' is first encountered in the third act of ''Spirou et les hÃ©ritiers'', and from then on remained a near-constant character fixture in the following Franquin adventures. After this he featured in Fournier's first story, ''Le faiseur d'or'' under Franquin's supervision, and never appeared again, save for depictions as plush animal toys and in framed photos.  This is because Franquin kept the rights to the character to himself, while the other characters belonged to publisher [[Dupuis]].  Since 1987, the specimen from [[Le nid des Marsupilamis]] stars in [[Marsupilami#Marsupilami|his own comics]].

===The Mayor of Champignac===
'''Gustave Labarbe''' is usually referred to by the title of his office, the Mayor of Champignac. He is notable for his large ego, his pompous and nonsensical speeches, and his suspicion of all things from out-of-town, in particular Spirou and Fantasio themselves. A man who loves to hear himself speak, a simple conversation can turn into a speech in itself. He was first introduced in ''Il y a un sorcier Ã  Champignac'' (1951).

He was created for the 1958 [[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]] Christmas special issue.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NoÃ«l&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =franquin.com | title = NoÃ«l et L'Elaoin | url =http://www.franquin.com/univers/noel_univers.php }}{{fr_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; He would receive several small cameo appearances and become a good friend to Marsupilami during his stay near the village, the pair appearing in a few short stories together.

[[Jean-Claude Fournier|Fournier]], who was not interested in using Seccotine,  replaced her with this new female character, also a journalist, but more friendly with Fantasio.  His infatuation with Ororea contrasts with his frequent exasperation at Seccotine.

===Spip===
'''Spip''' is one of the central characters of the series, Spirou's domesticated, courageous and sharp, grouchy pet squirrel. As his companion in all his adventures. Spip cannot talk, but his thoughts, often witty or sarcastic, are displayed to the reader, reflecting his usually grouchy mood. He's not pleased to frequently find himself in danger, but will be helpful in any situation as much as he can. Over the several authorship periods the character has evolved:

====Rob-Vel and JijÃ© periods====
Spip is saved by Spirou in Rob-Vel's and JijÃ©'s first joint adventure ''L'HÃ©ritage de Bill Money'' (''The Inheritance of Bill Money'', 1938), and from then on he stands by his master's side.  Under Rob-vel his presence is just visual, occasionally serving to gnaw ropes that bind his master, or adding to a comical detail.  It is under JijÃ©'s authorship he gains the capacity to speak through &quot;thought balloons&quot; (similar to [[Snoopy]] and [[Garfield]]). From this point he is given to state his opinion on any situation, often in a comical manner, and his communications appear to be understood.

====Franquin period====
Under Franquin's authorship, Spirou and Fantasio lose the ability to understand Spip, and when the Marsupilami joins the family, he also loses a great deal of attention but gains the perspective to feel ignored and underappreciated. In the shadow of his extraordinary fellow pet, he is less influential, although there are exceptions. In ''La corne de rhinoceros'', he saves his friends from an angry elephant, earning him the title &quot;king of creation&quot;.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spip in ''La corne''&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Franquin | title =Excerpt from ''La corne de rhinoceros'' | publisher = Dupuis  | year =1953 | url =http://www.franquin.com/spirou_fantasio/album6_spirou.php | format =comic book}}{{fr_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; Near the end of this era, in ''QRN sur Bretzelburg'', he is allowed to shine.

====Fournier period====
Fournier's Spip continues where Franquin's left off, his sarcasms becoming more frequent and self-pitying. He occasionally breaks the [[fourth wall]], acknowledging that he is in a comic book and sometimes even complaining that Spirou and Fantasio are not exactly his idea of comic book heroes. Complaints aside, he was still an active (if often unwilling) participant in the stories, even saving the day on a few occasions, such as in  ''L'abbaye truquÃ©e''.

====Tome &amp; Janry period====
In the beginning, Tome and Janry continued Spip much as Fournier had, letting him make biting remarks about whatever situation he was in, providing comedy relief and occasionally contributing to the plots. Hopever, as the series evolved and grew more dramatic and mature, Spip's role was greatly reduced, his comments becoming less frequent until he stopped talking entirely. In later albums he's more or less a background character, still always by Spirou's side but seldom noticed by anyone. This was even parodied in ''Spirou Ã  Moscou'', where he after a kidnapping spends much of the story with a [[Adhesive bandage|Band-Aid]] covering his mouth, and Spirou and Fantasio don't notice it.

=== Sprtschk===
'''Sprtschk''' is an atomic scientist genius, whose mind is constantly fixed on physics formulas in pursuit of discovering the solution to create the ultimate bomb. Invited to [[#The Count of Champignac|The Count]]'s castle for reason's unknown during the hatching of the [[Mesozoic]] egg, the Count appears to quite dislike this scientist, and he spends most of the time by himself to ponder his scientific riddle. Sprtschk's appearance in the ''Spirou'' adventures is very brief, though memorable and ironic. Having presumably just discovered the great goal of his career with sinister satisfaction, he is suddenly eaten, accidentally, by a vegetarian dinosaur. The Count feigns some guilt about his part in Sprtschk's death, but is more distraught when his trees are destroyed.

====Appearances====
*13. ''[[Le voyageur du MÃ©sozoÃ¯que]]'' (Franquin)

===Marcelin Switch===
Marcelin Switch appeared in ''[[QRN sur Bretzelburg]]''.

Switch was a [[ham radio]] operator who got in touch with King Ladislas of Bretzelburg who was being kept a virtual prisoner in his palace by General Schmetterling. Ladislas wanted Switch to inform world opinion of his plight but the Bretzelburg secret police intercepted their communications and set out to kidnap Switch. By mistake however they captured Fantasio instead. Spirou resolved to go to Bretzelburg in order to rescue Fantasio and dragged the reluctant Switch along with him.

Switch was terrified from the start, and became even more so as they progressed through Bretzelburg, being convinced that they last hour had come at every minute. Disguised as [[window cleaner]]s he and Spirou managed to sneak into the Royal palace during which a nervous Switch wrote out his [[Will (law)|will]]. He even fainted when he overheard an outburst by the intimidating General Schmetterling.

Switch, Spirou, Fantasio and the local rebel movement opposed to Schmetterling eventually succeeded in overthrowing him and restoring the King to his authority. Ladislas subsequently introduced reforms to overcome the economic plight caused by the General who had been fraudulently [[embezzling]] the state's coffers. The King even awarded Switch the Bretzelburg Medal of Courage!

Switch had a sister whose children enjoyed comics. In a breach of the [[fourth wall]] Switch got the characters of ''[[Spirou magazine]]'' mixed up with those of rival publication ''[[Tintin magazine|Tintin]]''.

====Appearances====
*18. ''[[QRN sur Bretzelburg]]'' (Franquin)

===Zantafio===
{{Main|Zantafio}}
'''Zantafio''' is a recurring antagonist in the series. He was created by Franquin and first appeared in ''[[Spirou et les hÃ©ritiers]]'' (1952). Zantafio bears a strong resemblance to Fantasio, because they are cousins.
