A Dutch photographer, [[Hubert van Es]], working for [[United Press International|UPI]], captured the last chaotic days of the [[Vietnam War]], and most people believed that it showed desperate Americans crowding on to the roof of the [[United States Embassy, Saigon|United States Embassy]] to board a helicopter.&lt;ref name=photo&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/23/weekinreview/the-world-getting-it-wrong-in-a-photo.html?pagewanted=1 The World; getting it wrong in a photo], new York Times Archive&lt;/ref&gt; The building actually was then an apartment building for the employees of the [[United States Agency for International Development]] with its top floor reserved for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]'s [[deputy chief of station]]. 

The photo depicts an [[Air America (airline)|Air America]] Huey helicopter landing on the roof of the elevator shaft evacuating employees of the [[U. S. Government]] as [[North Vietnamese Army]] troops entered Saigon.&lt;ref name=photo/&gt;

The current address is 22 LÃ½ Tá»± Trá»ng Street, and visitors are not allowed access to the roof.
