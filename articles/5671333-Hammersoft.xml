}}
The original version of &quot;Walk On By&quot; was recorded at the same December 1963 session that yielded &quot;[[Anyone Who Had a Heart (song)|Anyone Who Had a Heart]]&quot;, which, in 1964, became Warwick's second Top Ten hit. Released in April of that year, &quot;Walk on By&quot; became a [[landmark]] single, reaching number six on the U.S. [[Billboard Hot 100]] and number one hit Cashbox's R&amp;B chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles: 1942-2004|last=Whitburn |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Whitburn |year=2004 |publisher=Record Research |page=609}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Billboard did not print rhythm and blues charts during 1964, the year of the song's peak performance.) The song also reached the top 10 in a brief run on Billboard's easy listening survey.

Warwick also recorded a German version of the song, entitled &quot;Geh Vorbei&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AnwtYxccwMw Geh Vorbei (Walk On By)] on [[YouTube]]&lt;/ref&gt;
