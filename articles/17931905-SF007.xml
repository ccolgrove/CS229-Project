'''Ultimate Boot CD for Windows''' or '''UBCD4Win''' is a bootable recovery CD ([[live CD]]) that contains software used for repairing, restoring, and diagnosing many computer problems.  It is based on [[BartPE]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ubcd4win.com&lt;/ref&gt;

All programs included in UBCDWin are [[freeware]] utilities for Windows. Bart's PE builds a Windows &quot;pre-install&quot; environment CD, which is basically like Windows booted from CD. With network support, the ability to modify [[NTFS]] volumes, recover deleted files, create new NTFS volumes, and scan hard drives for viruses. This project includes almost everything needed to repair system problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://download.cnet.com/UBCD4Win/3000-2086_4-10550208.html&lt;/ref&gt;
