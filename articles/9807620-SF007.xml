{{Computer programs, software and patent law}}
Opposition to [[software patents]] is widespread in the [[free software community]].  In response, various mechanisms have been tried to defuse the perceived problem.

==Positions from the community==

Community leaders such as [[Richard Stallman]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and companies such as Red Hat,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redhat.com/legal/patent_policy.html redhat.com | Red Hat Patent Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MySQL]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mysql.com/company/legal/patents.html MySQL AB :: MySQL Public Patent Policy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and community groups such as [[Free Software Foundation Europe|FSFE]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://fsfeurope.org/projects/swpat/ FSFE - Software Patents in Europe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Irish Free Software Organisation|IFSO]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ifso.ie/projects/swpats.html Software Patentability &amp; EU Directive COD/2002/0047&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; all believe that patents cause problems for free software.

==Patent licensing==

Leading open-source figures and companies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/66807]&lt;/ref&gt; have complained software patents are overly broad and the USPTO should reject most of them. Even Bill Gates has said &lt;ref&gt;[http://news.swpat.org/2010/06/late-comers-guide-what-is-bilski-anyway/]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;If people had understood how patents would be granted when most of todayâs ideas were invented, and had taken out patents, the industry would be at a complete standstill today&quot;.

==Benefits of free software==
US [[patent attorney]] [[Dan Ravicher]] argues that free software's distributed development model which leads to fewer concentrations of wealth, plus free software's public benefit create economic and legal protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20040901004705872
|title=Patents - Why Free/Open Source Software Might Have Less to Fear than Non-Free Software
|author=Dan Ravicher
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems for free software==
Free software projects cannot agree to patent licences that include any kind of per-copy fee.  No matter how low the fee is, there is no way for a free software distributor to know how many copies are being made. Also, adding any requirements to pay or to notify someone each time a copy is made would make the software no longer free software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.ifso.ie/documents/rms-2004-05-24.html#license
|title=The Dangers of Software Patents
|author=Richard Stallman
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A patent licence that is [[royalty-free]], or provides a one-time worldwide payment is acceptable.  Version 2 of the [[GNU General Public License]] does not allow software to be distributed if that software requires a patent licence that does not &quot;''permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html
|title=GNU General Public License version 2
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The 2004 OSRM study==
In 2004, [[Open Source Risk Management]] commissioned a patent study, carried out by [[Dan Ravicher]].  For this study, Ravicher performed patent searches to estimate the patent-risk of the [[Linux kernel]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.osriskmanagement.com/press_releases/press_release_080204.pdf
|title=OSRM PR: Results of First-Ever Linux Patent Review Announced
|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In conclusion, he found that no court-validated software patent is
infringed by the Linux kernel. However, Ravicher also found 283 issued but
not yet court-validated software patents that, if upheld as valid by the
courts, could potentially be used to support patent claims against Linux.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Techniques for opposing patents==
===Patent retaliation===
&quot;Patent retaliation&quot; clauses are included in several [[free software licences]]. The goal of these clauses is to create a penalty so as to discourage the licensee (the user/recipient of the software) from suing the licensor (the provider/author of the software) for [[patent infringement]] by terminating the licence upon the initiation of such a lawsuit.

The [[Free Software Foundation]] included a narrow patent retaliation clause in drafts 1 and 2 of version 3 of the GPL, however, this clause was removed in draft 3 as its enforceability and effectiveness was decided to be too dubious to be worth the added complexity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=Richard Stallman speaking about GPLv3 in April 2007
|url=http://fsfeurope.org/projects/gplv3/brussels-rms-transcript#retaliation
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of broader clauses are those of the [[Apache License]] and the [[Mozilla Public License]].

===Patent pools===
In 2005, [[IBM]], [[Novell]], [[Philips]], [[Red Hat]], and [[Sony]] founded the [[Open Invention Network]] (OIN).  OIN is a company that acquires patents and offers them royalty free &quot;to any company, institution or individual that agrees not to assert its patents against the [[Linux operating system]] or certain Linux-related applications&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = November 10, 2005 | url=http://www.openinventionnetwork.com/press_release11_05.php | title=Open Invention Network formed to promote Linux and spur innovation globally through access to key patents |publisher = [[Open Invention Network]] | accessdate = April 17, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novell donated the valuable [[Commerce One]] web services patents to OIN.  These potentially threaten anyone who uses web services.  OIN's founders intend for these patents to encourage others to join, and to discourage legal threats against Linux and Linux-related applications.  Along with several other projects, [[Mono (software)|Mono]] is listed as a covered project.

===Lobbying for legislative change===
Movements have formed to lobby against the existence and enforceability of software patents.  The earliest was the [[League for Programming Freedom]] in the USA.  Probably the most successful was the anti-software-patent campaign in Europe that resulted in the rejection by the [[European Parliament]] of the [[Proposed directive on the patentability of computer-implemented inventions]] which, the free software community argues, would have made software patents enforceable in the [[European Union]].  A fledgling movement also exists in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|title=Freedom to Innovate South Africa
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Promises from patent holders==
Some software companies who hold significant [[patent portfolio]]s have made non-aggression pledges to the free software community.  These have varied in scope and have received a variety of responses.  IBM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS9492990539.html
|title=Top patent awardee donates 500 patents to open source
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sun, and Nokia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS8236182857.html
|title=Nokia gives Linux bye on patents
}}&lt;/ref&gt; are three examples.  These have been described by Richard Stallman as &quot;significant&quot;, &quot;not really anything&quot;, and &quot;next to nothing&quot;, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/articles/AT4665245733.html
|title=Nokia's patent announcement next to nothing
|author=Richard Stallman
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft has pledged not to assert any claims against open source developers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/principles/osspatentpledge.mspx
|title=Microsoft Patent Pledge for Open Source Developers
|author=Microsoft
|accessdate=2009-12-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] called &quot;an important step and significant change in how we share information about our products and technologies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-12-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This pledge has been accepted with some skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=2009-12-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infringement claims==
[[Microsoft]] has claimed that [[free software]] such as [[OpenOffice.org]] and the [[Linux kernel]] violate 235 Microsoft patents and said that it will seek licence fees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2007/05/28/100033867/
|title=Microsoft takes on the free world
| publisher=[[CNN]]
|date=2007-05-14
|last=Parloff|first=Roger
}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has so far failed to disclose which patents they violate.  However, the [[Microsoft v. TomTom|2009 lawsuit]] against TomTom involved the use of Microsoft's patents for long filenames on FAT filesystems, the code for which is in the Linux kernel, not in any TomTom-developed software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10805_3-10173126-75.html

|date=2009-02-26
|last=Mills|first=Elinor
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2008, [[Trend Micro]] accused [[Barracuda Networks]] of patent infringement for distribution of the [[ClamAV]] anti-virus software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.linuxworld.com/news/2008/012908-barracuda.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Microsoft's patent deals==
{{See also|Novell#Agreement with Microsoft|l1=Novell's patent agreement with Microsoft}}
In November 2006, a highly controversial agreement was made between Novell and Microsoft that included patent licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.microsoft.com/interop/msnovellcollab/patent_agreement.mspx
|title=The MS-Novell patent deal
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This led to much criticism of Novell by the [[free software community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://techp.org/petition/show/1
|title=Bruce Perens's petition criticising Novell
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2007, [[Xandros]] announced a similar deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20070604183519938 | title=Groklaw article on Xandros' Microsoft deal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url = http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2007/jun07/06-04XandrosPR.mspx | title=Microsoft, Xandros Broad Collaboration Agreement Extends Bridge Between Commercial Open Source and Microsoft Software |  rl=http://forums.xandros.com/viewtopic.php?t=31406
|title=Xandros community forums, first thread on this topic
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 13, 2007, a deal was reached between Microsoft and [[Linspire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://desktoplinux.com/news/NS9642338710.html Linspire, Microsoft in Linux-related deal&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In return, Linspire would change its default search engine from Google to Live search.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linux.slashdot.org/linux/07/06/14/1227201.shtml Slashdot | Linspire Signs Patent Pact With MS&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] founder and director [[Mark Shuttleworth]] has said that Ubuntu will not be making any such deal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On October 2007, [http://www.ipinnovate.com/ IP Innovation LLC], a company specialized in patent-protection, filed a suit for patent infringement against [[Red Hat]] and Novell&lt;ref name=&quot;LLCsuitezdnet&quot;&gt;{{cite web
