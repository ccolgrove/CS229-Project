'''NRN''' is a [[television station]] originating in [[Coffs Harbour]], [[Australia]] as part of the [[Southern Cross Ten]] network. The station was formally a partnership between NRN-11 Coffs Harbour (launched 23 January 1965) and RTN-8 [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] (launched 12 May 1962).

==History==
===Origins===
NRN11 Coffs Harbour had merged with ECN8 Taree, but later demerged. Around 1971, RTN8 and NRN11 merged to form ''Northern Rivers Television'' ('''NRTV'''), but was known on-air originally as ''11-8''. The merged stations served the [[Mid North Coast]] and [[Northern Rivers]] areas of Northern New South Wales. During the mid 1970s, the station was known as ''Great Eastland Television'', when the partnership shared programming and advertising with [[NEN|NEN-9]] [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] and DDQ-10 [[Toowoomba, Queensland|Toowoomba]]/SDQ-4 [[Warwick, Queensland|Warwick]], but they soon reverted back to the ''NRTV'' brand.

In 1983, NRTV was relayed into the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] after a lobbying campaign from residents, although they could also watch the commercial television stations from [[Brisbane, Queensland|Brisbane]]. NRTV's Gold Coast studios and offices were constructed in [[Ashmore, Queensland|Ashmore]] on Southport Nerang Road. The Gold Coast facilities didn't contain a newsroom, although relayed local news from the [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]] studios. News crews from [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] travelled to the Gold Coast for stories of importance.

NRTV was at the forefront of local production during its heyday (1975 to 1990), each week pumping out five half hours of local news, three hours of live women's variety &quot;Round About&quot;, 5 half hours of live children's variety &quot;Get Set&quot; and &quot;Razzamataz&quot; weekly, holiday specials &quot;Summerthon&quot;, and a half hour daily exercise program &quot;Jazzacize&quot;. Live sports specials including the annual &quot;Grafton Cup&quot; Racing Carnival and the pre-taped Grafton to Inverell Cycling Classic were among the many sports telecast across Australia. Not bad for a regional TV network.

Live programs mainly originated from the Coffs Harbour Studios with programs being recorded at both the networks other studios located at Lismore and Gold Coast.

Some of the memorable names from that era were:
* Ron Lawrence - Ron passed away in 2008. He was the driving force behind the network's local production.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} He began his career as booth announcer at the Lismore Radio and TV Studios of Northern Star Holdings (RTN 8) and (Radio 2LM) after graduating from Jim Illife's AIR-TV College in Brisbane. He moved to Coffs Harbour TV studios in the early 70s after the merge between NRN11 and RTN 8 and became the station announcerânews reader. Later in his career he became Program Manager then later Station Manager and finally General Manager before retiring in the 90s
* Wayne Magee, also a diploma graduate from the Brisbane College AIR-TV (formally with Radio 4GY Gympie, BCV TV Victoria and National Nine News Adelaide) started with the network in 1976. During his time with the network he hosted ''Get Set'', network specials and telethons and read local TV news. He eventually moved into management before leaving the network to become a minister.
* Chris Wordsworth who hailed from Townsville QLD and who had worked previously in radio. Chris hosted the children's show for a period and read main bulletin news Monday to Friday. He later joined CH7 Sydney as late edition news reader â journalist, was briefly a Chief of Staff for a QLD Politician and later assumed the role of Director of ABC QLD/NT.
&gt; Greg Hughes who succeeded Wordsworth as News Reader and station announcer. He formally had worked for the Mike Walsh owned Penrith radio station. He left the network to work for the Army PR Dept.

===1990s to 2000s===
On 31 December 1991, Northern New South Wales became the third area to be aggregated, and NRTV, via links to Network Ten (it was part of [[Northern Star Holdings]], owned by [[Westfield Group]] chairman [[Frank Lowy]]), became its affiliate in the region. At one stage, NRTV was the subject of a bid from [[WIN Television]]. Nothing came of it, although if WIN had gone through with the bid, it would have made ''NRTV'' the [[Nine Network]]'s affiliate and left an unhappy [[NBN Television|NBN]] as Network Ten's affiliate instead.

NRTV was later sold to [[Telecasters Australia]], who also owned the [[Queensland]] affiliate of [[Network Ten]]. In 1994, the station was renamed ''Ten Northern NSW'', and its station identification was changed to that of Network Ten. The station stopped producing regional news for [[Coffs Harbour, New South Wales|Coffs Harbour]], [[Lismore, New South Wales|Lismore]] and [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]]. They had previously produced a licence-wide bulletin, but that too was axed due to poor ratings.
