Its products consist of software to back up and convert digital media, including [[CD]]s, [[DVD]]s, [[HD DVD]]s, and [[Blu-ray Disc]]s, as well as copy and back up optical media and render PC-based games playable without the disc.

==AACS and BD+==
SlySoft was the first to offer [[Advanced Access Content System|AACS]] circumvention that worked for any disc available; previous programs only cracked &quot;compatible&quot; discs using a database of known keys.

On November 8, 2007, SlySoft claimed to have completely cracked [[BD+]].  However, this turned out to be incorrect, as subsequent versions of BD+ security code have caused SlySoft to re-design its software.  On March 3, 2008, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD allowing the full decryption of BD+,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=14786 SlySoft Press Release]&lt;/ref&gt; allowing for not only the viewing of the film itself but also playing and copying disks with third-party software.  A third iteration of BD+ was released in November 2008, and was announced to be cracked by SlySoft with the release of AnyDVD HD 6.5.0.2 on December 29, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=24602 SlySoft defeats Blu-ray's BD+ DRM scheme again]&lt;/ref&gt;  A fourth version of BD+ security code was discovered with the movie [[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]] on February 17, 2009, thwarting the effectiveness of SlySoft's software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=27330 BD+ discs that may not work properly with AnyDVD HD]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afterdawn.com/news/archive/16313.cfm BD+ re-secured, SlySoft beaten]&lt;/ref&gt;

However on March 19, 2009, SlySoft updated AnyDVD HD to version 6.5.3.1 which allowed the decryption of the new version of BD+ used by the movie [[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slysoft.com/download/changes_anydvd.txt AnyDVD Version Change Log]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Licensing ==

On December 1, 2008 SlySoft announced it would for the first time begin charging its customers for updates to its software.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.slysoft.com/showthread.php?t=23279 Press release: SlySoft announces new update policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, SlySoft initially announced the discontinuation of the lifetime licensing option beginning January 2011. An e-mail&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediasmartserver.net/2010/11/26/slysoft-to-discontinue-lifetime-subscriptions-for-anydvd/ Original text of the announcement]&lt;/ref&gt; announcing the change ahead of time was sent to all registered customers allowing everyone the chance to purchase the lifetime option &quot;while it is still possible;&quot; and the notice was posted to their official forums. In January 2011, all announcements regarding the change were deleted without comment and a new structured licensing plan was put into place; including the lifetime licensing option at the highest priced tier. The new 'update service' will block free updates without the lifetime licence, but the current paid non-lifetime software licences will continue to work, sans-update, indefinitely.
