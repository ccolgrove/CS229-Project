===Week 10: The Finale===
''*Aired on June 5, 2011''

The top two crews performed for their last time in the final episode of the season. The finale also featured performances by the five past ''ABDC'' champions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Finale&quot;/&gt; In contrast to previous seasons of ''America's Best Dance Crew'', the finale was pre-recorded; each crew taped a faux winning and losing reaction, as well as their victory performance, and were unaware of the results until the final cut of the episode was aired prior to the [[2011 MTV Movie Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2011/06/americas-best-dance-crew-winner-i-am-me-defeats-the-iconic-boyz.html &quot;'America's Best Dance Crew' winner: I aM mE defeats the ICONic Boyz&quot;] Zap2it; June 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
