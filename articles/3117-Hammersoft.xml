Not neutral: Arrested in Pakistan in March 2002, he has been in US custody for more than eight years, four-and-a-half of them spent incommunicado in [[solitary confinement]] in undisclosed locations. He was subjected to the technique of [[waterboarding]] and has been subjected to numerous other interrogation techniques. These techniques, include forced nudity, [[sleep deprivation]], confinement in small dark boxes, deprivation of solid food, cold temperatures, [[stress positions]], and physical assaults. Videotapes of some of his interrogations are believed to be amongst those [[2005 CIA interrogation tapes destruction|destroyed by the CIA in 2005]].&lt;ref&gt;http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/TheLaw/story?id=4244423&amp;page=1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.andyworthington.co.uk/2010/03/15/abu-zubaydahs-torture-diary/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.democracynow.org/2009/3/30/headlines&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.propublica.org/article/do-cia-cables-show-doctors-monitoring-torture-528&lt;/ref&gt;

He is now in the Guantanamo Bay Detention Centre in Cuba. Sections of the Pakistani media had reported at that time that Abu Zubaidah, a Palestinian, had studied computer science in Pune before crossing over into Pakistan and joining Al Qaeda.

Elzahabi told the ''Globe and Mail'' that Abu Zubaydah had served under him when he was a squad commander during the war against the Soviets.  Elzahabi said that after the Soviet ouster Elzahabi worked as an instructor at Khalden.

==Early activities==
By 1999, the U.S. Government was attempting to run surveillance on Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;PressTrustIndia&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-4648752_ITM ''Pak leadership under Sharif offered to try to capture Osama'' The Press Trust of India Ltd. Through Asia Pulse. March 28, 2004] (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; By March 2000, United States officials were reporting that Abu Zubaydah was a &quot;senior bin Laden official&quot;, the &quot;former head of Egypt-based Islamic Jihad&quot;, a &quot;trusted aide&quot; to bin Laden with &quot;growing power,&quot; who had &quot;played a key role in the East Africa embassy attacks.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DavidVise&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-513940.html David A. Vise and Lorraine Adams, ''Bin Laden Weakened, Officials Say'' The Washington Post. March 11, 2000] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; None of these allegations have been corroborated at this point, however.

Internationally Abu Zubaydah was convicted in absentia and sentenced to death &lt;ref&gt;''Six Muslim militants sentenced to death for plotting to attack tourists in Jordan'' [[The Independent]] 19 September 2000&lt;/ref&gt; by a Jordanian court for his role in plots to bomb U.S. and Israeli targets in Jordan.&lt;ref name=&quot;JamalHalaby&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-26114220.html Jamal Halaby, ''Arabs of Terror Linked to bin Laden'' AP News Online] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; A senior Middle East security official stated Abu Zubaydah had directed the Jordanian cell and was part of âbin Ladenâs inner circle.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;TraineesInTerror&quot;&gt;[http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20000305&amp;slug=4008236 ''Trainees in Terror'' The Seattle Times, Sunday, March 5, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In August, 2001 a classified FBI report entitled âBin Laden determined to strike in U.S.â, which would not become public until much later, stated that the foiled millennium bomber, [[Ahmed Ressam]], had confessed that Abu Zubaydah had not only encouraged him to blow up the Los Angeles airport, but had facilitated his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;BinLadenReport&quot;&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/04/10/august6.memo/index.html ''Transcript: Bin Laden determined to Strike in US'' CNN.com, Saturday April 10, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; The report also claims Abu Zubaydah was planning his own attack on the U.S.&lt;ref name=BinLadenReport/&gt; An unclassified FBI report also stated that Ahmed Ressam attempted to buy a laptop for Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ElaineGanley&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-80592999.html Elaine Ganley, ''Terror Plot Took Typical Path'' AP Online, December 19, 2001] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; Despite all of these supposed connections, when Ahmed Ressam went to trial in December 2001 federal prosecutors did not attempt to link him to Abu Zubaydah, and did not use any of this supposed evidence in its case.&lt;ref name=ElaineGanley/&gt; He also recanted his confessions after the trial saying he was coerced into giving them.

==Capture==

It is unclear how the Government found Abu Zubaydah. U.S. officials claimed he was tracked down after making a phone call to al-Qaeda leaders in [[Yemen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;TedBridis&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-52457420.html Ted Bridis ''U.S. Will Seek Death Penalty In Spy Case'' The Columbian, April 20, 2002] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; However, this has been questioned by a CIA official who stated that the U.S. paid $10 million to the Pakistani government, who had in turn bribed the information on his whereabouts from a local driver in [[Faisalabad]].&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; Pakistani intelligence discovered that he was traveling in disguise as a [[burka]]-clad woman.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; Saudi Arabian officials claimed Abu Zubaydah was captured after intelligence gleaned during an interrogation by their GSS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowaf Obaid&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-404238.html Nowaf Obaid, ''The Saudisâ Fight Too: Weâre on the same side in the war on terror'' The Washington Post, December 26, 2002] (Highbeam News Database Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt; It was also reported in 2008 that [[Deuce Martinez]], a CIA analyst, had played an integral role in narrowing down Abu Zubaydahâs supposed hideouts to the 14 targeted by the joint raids.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottShaneInside9/11Mastermind&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/22/washington/22ksm.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1 Scott Shane, ''Inside a 9/11 mastermindâs interrogation'' New York Times, June 22, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[pocket litter]] supposedly contained two [[bank card]]s which showed he had access to Saudi and Kuwaiti bank accounts, which was considered rare since most al-Qaeda members used the preferred untraceable [[hawala]] banking.&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; According to [[James Risen]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;It is not clear whether an investigation of the cards simply fell through the cracks, or whether they were ignored because no one wanted to know the answers about connections between al Qaeda and important figures in the Middle East -- particularly in Saudi Arabia.&quot; One of Risen's sources chalks up the failure to investigate the cards to incompetence rather than foul play: &quot;The cards were sent back to Washington and were never fully exploited. I think nobody ever looked at them because of incompetence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; When American investigators finally did get around to looking into the cards, they worked with &quot;a Muslim financier with a questionable past, and with connections to the Afghan Taliban, al Qaeda, and Saudi intelligence.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt; He reported back that &quot;Saudi intelligence officials had seized all of the records related to the card from the Saudi financial institution in question; the records then disappeared. There was no longer any way to trace the money that had gone into the account.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;risen&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

A search of the safehouse turned up his personal 10,000 page diaries, in which he recorded his thoughts in seemingly [[split personalities]] of a young boy, old man, and himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;mayer&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah's treatment at the hands of the CIA has been called torture by [[Ali Soufan]], the FBI interrogator who witnessed part of Abu Zubaydah's CIA interrogation, multiple U.S. officials including President Obama, and by the International Committee of the Red Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/opinion/23soufan.html Ali Soufan ''My Tortured Decision'' New York Times, April 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/195089 Michael Isikoff '''We Could Have Done This the Right Way''' Newsweek, April 25, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanTestimony&quot;&gt;[http://judiciary.senate.gov/hearings/testimony.cfm?id=3842&amp;wit_id=7906 ''Congressional Testimony of Ali Soufan, May 13, 2009'' Congressional Testimony, May 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;&gt;[http://www.nybooks.com/icrc-report.pdf ''International Committee of the Red Cross Report on the Treatment of Fourteen &quot;High Value Detainees&quot; in CIA Custody'' International Committee of the Red Cross, February 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the interrogation techniques used against Abu Zubaydah, including waterboarding, cold cell, long-time standing, and sleep deprivation were previously considered illegal under U.S. and international law and treaties at the time of Abu Zubaydahâs capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterPincusWaterboarding&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100402005.html Walter Pincus, ''Waterboarding Historically Controversial'' The Washington Post, October 5, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the United States had prosecuted Japanese military officials after World War II and American soldiers after the Vietnam War for waterboarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterPincusWaterboarding&quot;/&gt; Since 1930, the United States had defined sleep deprivation as an illegal form of torture.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt; Many other techniques developed by the CIA constitute inhuman and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;

===International Committee of the Red Cross report===
The International Committee of the Red Cross concluded a report on the treatment of 14 high-value detainees in February 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; The report would be made public April 7, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;ACLUICRC&quot;&gt;[http://www.aclu.org/safefree/torture/39296prs20090407.html ''Full ICRC Report Further Underscores Extent of Torture And Abuse By U.S. Officials'' ACLU, April 4, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The report is composed of interviews with the detainees, although the ICRC stated &quot;[t]he ICRC wishes to underscore that the consistency of the detailed allegations provided separately by each of the fourteen [detainees] adds particular weight to the information provided.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; The ICRC outlined twelve interrogation techniques suffocation by water (waterboarding), prolonged stress standing position, beatings by use of a collar, beating and kicking, confinement in a box, prolonged nudity, sleep deprivation, exposure to cold temperature, prolonged shackling, threats of ill-treatment, forced shaving, and deprivation/restricted provision of solid food.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; Of the 12 interrogation techniques, only Abu Zubaydah was subjected to all of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah was the only one of the fourteen detainees to be put into close confinement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt; This would be corroborated, in part, by one of the Torture Memos written by the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel, which noted &quot;[i]n OMS's view, however, cramped confinement &quot;ha[s] not proved particularly effective&quot; because it provides &quot;a safehaven offering respite from interrogation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;&gt;[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05302005_bradbury.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memoradnum for John A.

===Waterboarding===
Abu Zubaydah was one of three high value detainees to be waterboarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesProfileZubaydah&quot;/&gt; Originally the Government's position was that Abu Zubaydah had only been waterboarded once.&lt;ref name=&quot;BrianRoss&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;JJGreen&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TanyaNolan&quot;&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2007/s2116703.htm Tanya Nolan ''Former CIA Agent Reveals Use of âWaterboardingâ in Interrogations'' The World Today, December 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RayMcGovern&quot;&gt;[http://www.alternet.org/story/70490/ Ray McGovern ''Destruction of CIA Tapes Canât Hide Barbaric U.S. Torture Methods'' AlterNet, December 13, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LauerStirsScandal&quot;&gt;[http://www.mediaresearch.org/cyberalerts/2007/cyb20071212.asp#1 ''Lauer Stirs Scandal Over How Water Boarding Saved Lives'' Media Research Center, December 12, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ExCIAAgent&quot;&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/12/11/agent.tapes/#cnnSTCText ''Ex-CIA Agent: Waterboarding âSaved Livesâ'' CNNPolitics.com, December 11, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, John Kiriakou, a CIA officer who had seen the cables regarding Abu Zubaydah's interrogation publicly stated Abu Zubaydah was waterboarded only once for 35 seconds before he started talking.&lt;ref name=&quot;WaterboardingEffective&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2009/0420/p99s01-duts.html Liam Stack ''Is waterboarding effective?

The May 10, 2005 torture memo stated that no more than 60 applications of water could be conducted in a 30 day period. However, that number applied only to those applications of &quot;ten seconds or more.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; A U.S. official with knowledge of the interrogation program reported to Fox News that many of the applications lasted &quot;a matter of seconds&quot; and it was these less than ten second applications &quot;that created the huge numbers.&quot; He further stated that &quot;[a]ll of those individual pours were scrupulously counted by the CIA, according to the memos, to abide by the procedures set up for the waterboardings.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;JosephAbrams&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/28/despite-reports-khalid-sheikh-mohammed-waterboarded-times Joseph Abrams ''Despite Reports, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Was Not Waterboarded 183 Times'' Fox News, April 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the May 10, 2005 torture memo reported that the Department of Justice, Inspector General report noted that &lt;blockquote&gt; [T]he waterboard techniqueâ¦ was different from the technique described in the DoJ opinion and used in the SERE training. The difference was in the manner in which the detaineeâs breathing was obstructed. At the SERE school and in the DoJ opinion the subjectâs airflow is disrupted by the firm application of a damp cloth over the air passage; the interrogator applies a small amount of water to the cloth in a controlled manner. By contrast, the Agency interrogatorâ¦ applied large volumes of water to a cloth that covered the detaineeâs mouth and nose. One of the psychologists/interrogators acknowledged that the Agencyâs use of the technique is different from that used in SERE training because it is âfor realâ and is âmore poignant and convincing.ââ The Inspector General further reported that âOMS contends that the expertise of the SERE psychologist/interrogator on the waterboard was probably misrepresented at the time, as the SERE waterboard experience is so different from the subsequent Agency usage as to make it almost irrelevant. Consequently, according to OMS, there was no a prior reason to believe that applying the waterboard with the frequency and intensity with which it was used by the psychologist/interrogators was either efficacious or medically safe.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Inspector General also noted that the use of waterboarding was discontinued in every armed services branch except the Navy SERE training &quot;because of its dramatic effect on the students who were subjects.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The CIA Office of Medical Services contradicted this conclusion, however, stating that â[w]hile SERE trainers believe that trainees are unable to maintain psychological resistance to the waterboard our experience was otherwise. Some subjects unquestionably can withstand a large number of applications, with no immediately discernible cumulative impact beyond their strong aversion to the experience.â&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The memo also noted that at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, Douglas Johnson, Executive Director of the Center for Victims of Torture, testified that some U.S. military personnel who have undergone waterboard training have apparently stated âthat itâs taken them 15 years of therapy to get over it&quot;, although his claim has not substantiated.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; Despite the conflicting information the Department of Justice Office of Legal Counsel approved all of the tactics listed above.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;

Several people who have subjected themselves to controlled waterboarding have stated that it is torture.&lt;ref name=&quot;JoshWhite&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/11/08/AR2007110802150.html Josh White ''Waterboarding Is Torture, Says Ex-Navy Instructor'' The Washington Post, November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardMezo&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/02/08/AR2008020803156.html?sub-AR Richard E.

It was instantaneous... and I don't want to say this: absolutely torture.&quot;&lt;ref name=RachelWeiner/&gt;

Malcolm Wrightson Nance, an instructor at the Navyâs SERE school in California testified before congress that waterboarding âis an overwhelming experience that induces horror and triggers frantic survival instincts. As the event unfolded, I was fully conscious of what was happening: I was being tortured.â&lt;ref name=&quot;JoshWhite&quot;/&gt; Nance further testified that waterboarding is â[N]ot simulated anything. Itâs slow motion suffocation with enough time to contemplate the inevitability of blackout and expiration.â&lt;ref name=&quot;JoshWhite&quot;/&gt; Richard E. Mezo, who was waterboarded during training to become a Navy flight crewmember described waterboarding as an act that is âindeed tortureâ which is âreal drowning that simulates death.â&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardMezo&quot;/&gt; The experience was so horrific, Mezo stated that âPulling out my fingernails or even cutting off a finger would have been preferable.â&lt;ref name=&quot;RichardMezo&quot;/&gt; Henri Alleg, who was waterboarded by the French during the Algerian War, wrote that âa terrible agony, that of death itself, took possession of me.â&lt;ref name=&quot;AlfredMcCoy&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah said of his experience:&lt;blockquote&gt; I struggled against the straps, trying to breathe, but it was hopeless. I thought I was going to die.&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; During his waterboarding Abu Zubaydah lost control of his bladder and would later admit to the ICRC that &quot;[s]ince then I still lose control of my urine when under stress.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ICRC&quot;/&gt;

Some politicians and administration officials, including Richard Armitage, the former Deputy Secretary of State, Mike McConnell, the former National Intelligence Directorate, Tom Ridge, the former Homeland Security Secretary, and former Republican Presidential Candidate John McCain, have also declared it unequivocal torture.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmyGoodman&quot;&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2008/7/18/the_dark_side_jane_mayer_on Amy Goodman ''The Dark Side: Jane Mayer on the Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals, Interview Transcript'' Democracy Now, July 18, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; Senator John McCain stated âIt is not a complicated procedure.

Sawyer]], a seminal case on the powers of the Executive in times of war.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJReportYoo&quot;/&gt; In addition, Jack Goldsmith, the former head of the Office of Legal Counsel who withdrew the torture memos before resigning, stated he was &quot;astonished&quot; by the &quot;deeply flawed&quot; and &quot;sloppily reasoned&quot; legal analysis in the memos.&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJReportYoo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DOJTortureReport&quot;&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/184801 Michael Isikoff ''A Torture Report Could Spell Big Trouble For Bush Lawyers'' Newsweek, February 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; David Luban, a law professor at Georgetown Law School, testified before Congress on May 13, 2009 that the memos were &quot;an ethical train wreck&quot; and had been drafted to &quot;reverse engineer&quot; a defense for illegal actions already committed.&lt;ref name=&quot;BobbyGhosh&quot;&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1898125,00.html Bobby Ghosh ''Partisan Passions Dominate Interrogation Hearings'' Time, May 13, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

The memo contemplated ten techniques the interrogators wanted to use: &quot;(1) attention grasp, (2) walling, (3) facial hold, (4) facial slap (insult slap), (5) cramped confinement, (6) wall standing, (7) stress positions, (8) sleep deprivation, (9) insects placed in a confinement box, and (10) the waterboard.â&lt;ref name=&quot;August2002BybeeMemo&quot;/&gt; Many of the techniques were, until then, generally considered illegal.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WalterPincusWaterboarding&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AmyGoodman&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkMazetti&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;August02TortureMemoReleased&quot;/&gt; Many other techniques developed by the CIA constituted inhumane and degrading treatment and torture under the United Nations Convention against Torture and Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights.&lt;ref name=&quot;EnforcedDisappearance&quot;/&gt;

According to a psychological evaluation conducted of Abu Zubaydah upon his capture, the memo alleges that Abu Zubaydah:

*Quickly rose from very low level mujahedin to third or fourth man in al Qaeda
*Served as Usama Bin Ladenâs senior lieutenant
*Managed a network of training camps
*Was instrumental in the training of operatives for al Qaeda, the Egyptian Islamic Jihad, and other terrorist elements inside Pakistan and Afghanistan
*Acted as the Deputy Camp Commander for al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan, personally approving entry and graduation of all trainees during 1999-2000
*Approved all individuals going in and out of Afghanistan to the training camps from 1996â1999
*No one went in and out of Peshawar, Pakistan without his knowledge and approval
*Acted as al Qaedaâs coordinator of external contacts and foreign communications
*Acted as al Qaedaâs counter-intelligence officer and had been trusted to find spies within the organization
*Was involved in every major terrorist operation carried out by al Qaeda
*Was a planner for the Millennium plot to attack U.S. and Israeli targets during the Millennium celebrations in Jordan
*Served as a planner for the Paris Embassy plot in 2001
*Was one of the planners of 9/11
*Engaged in planning future terrorist attacks against U.S. interests
*Wrote al Qaedaâs manual on resistance techniques&lt;ref name=&quot;August2002BybeeMemo&quot;/&gt;

====May 10, 2005 memo====
Another subsequent memo addressed the legality of additional interrogation techniques such as nudity, dietary manipulation, abdominal slap, water dousing, and water flicking.&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyMemo&quot;&gt;[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05102005_bradbury46pg.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memorandum for John A.

During that 30-day period the waterboard can be used no more than 5 days. In any given day that waterboarding occurs interrogators may use no more than two âsessionsâ, with a âsessionâ defined as the time that the detainee is strapped to the board, and that a session can last no more than 2 hours. During any session no more than six applications of water of 10 seconds or more can be used.

====May 10, 2005 memo (combined interrogation techniques)====
Another memo penned on May 10, 2005 authorized the use of the above outlined individual techniques in conjunction with one another, but stressed the importance of constant vigilance on the part of medical observers to ensure the techniques did not cause &quot;severe physical or mental pain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May102005BradburyCombinedMemo&quot;&gt;[http://luxmedia.vo.llnwd.net/o10/clients/aclu/olc_05102005_bradbury20pg.pdf Steven Bradbury ''Memorandum For John A.

====May 30, 2005 memo====
The final memo mentioned Abu Zubaydah several times and claimed that due to the increased interrogation techniques Zubaydah also &quot;provided significant information on two operatives, [including] Jose Padilla[,] who planned to build and detonate a '[[dirty bomb]]' in the Washington DC area.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; This claim is heavily disputed, however, by Ali Soufan the FBI interrogator who first interrogated Abu Zubaydah following his capture, and other intelligence officials.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanTestimony&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MazettiAndJohnston&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/09/washington/09zubaydah.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world&amp;oref=slogin Mark Mazzetti and David Johnston ''Inquiry Begins Into Destruction of Tapes'' New York Times, December 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Soufan, when asked by Senator Sheldon Whitehouse during a Congressional hearing if the memo was incorrect, testified that it was.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkBenjamin&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2009/05/14/torture/ Mark Benjamin ''Soufan: CIA torture actually hindered our intelligence gathering'' Salon, May 14, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the memo itself noted that not all of the waterboarding sessions were necessary for Abu Zubaydah, since the on-scene interrogation team determined he had stopped producing actionable intelligence.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The memo reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
This is not to say that the interrogation program has worked perfectly. According to the IG Report, the CIA, at least initially, could not always distinguish detainees who had information but were successfully resisting interrogation from those who did not actually have the information. See IG Report at 83-85. On at least one occasion, this may have resulted in what might be deemed in retrospect to have been the unnecessary use of enhanced techniques. On that occasion, although the on-scene interrogation team judged Abu Zubaydah to be compliant, elements within CIA Headquarters still believed he was withholding information. See id at 84. At the direction of CIA Headquarters interrogators therefore used the waterboard one more time on Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===U.S. officials defend interrogation techniques===
Dennis C. Blair, President Obama's new director of national intelligence wrote in a memo to his staff in April 2009 that &quot;high value information came from interrogations in which [enhanced interrogation] methods were used.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottShaneEffectiveness&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/23/us/politics/23detain.html?_r=1&amp;th&amp;emc=th Scott Shane ''Interrogations' Effectiveness May Prove Elusive'' New York Times, April 22, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Vice-President, Dick Cheney claims there are memos in existence which show the success of the enhanced interrogation techniques.&lt;ref name=&quot;CheneyCallsForRelease&quot;&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/04/20/cheney-calls-release-memos-showing-results-interrogation-efforts-1862515294/ ''Cheney Calls for Release of Memos Showing Results of Interrogation Efforts'' April 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Cheney stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I haven't talked about it, but I know specifically of reports that I read, that I saw, that lay out what we learned through the interrogation process and what the consequences were for the country I've now formally asked the CIA to take steps to declassify those memos so we can lay them out there and the American people have a chance to see what we obtained and what we learned and how good the intelligence was.&lt;ref name=CheneyCallsForRelease/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Additionally, four successive CIA directors echoed these sentiments, with the most recent, Michael V. Hayden, stating that he believed the methods &quot;got the maximum amount of information&quot; from prisoners, specifically Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;ScottShaneEffectiveness&quot;/&gt; As noted, however, the belief that enhanced interrogation techniques were necessary to get actionable intel from Abu Zubaydah has been heavily contested. John McLaughlin, former acting CIA director, stated in 2006 &quot;I totally disagree with the view that the capture of Abu Zubaydah was unimportant. Abu Zubaydah was woven through all of the intelligence prior to 9/11 that signaled a major attack was coming, and his capture yielded a great deal of important information.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindBlitzer&quot;&gt;[http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0606/20/sitroom.02.html ''Transcript for THE SITUATION ROOM with Wolf Blitzer'' CNN, June 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In his memoir, former [[Director of Central Intelligence|CIA Director]] [[George Tenet]] writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A published report in 2006 contended that Abu Zubaydah was mentally unstable and that the administration had overstated his importance. Baloney. Abu Zubaydah had been at the crossroads of many al-Qa'ida operations and was in position to - and did - share critical information with his interrogators. Apparently, the source of the rumor that Abu Zubaydah was unbalanced was his personal diary, in which he adopted various personas. From that shaky perch, some junior Freudians leapt to the conclusion that Zubaydah had multiple personalities. In fact, Agency psychiatrists eventually determined that in his diary he was using a sophisticated literary device to express himself. And, boy, did he express himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;GeorgeTenet&quot;&gt;George Tenet ''At the Center of the Storm: My years at the CIA'' HarperCollins, April 30, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The changing depiction of Abu Zubaydah==
When Abu Zubaydah was captured, the Bush Administration believed he was an unparalleled source of intelligence on al-Qaeda and terrorism plots. Abu Zubaydah was touted as the biggest catch of the War on Terror until the capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed.&lt;ref name=&quot;9/11MastermindNabbed&quot;&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2003/03/02/terror/main542459.shtml ''Alleged 9-11 Mastermind Nabbed'' CBS News, March 1, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after Abu Zubaydahâs capture the director of the FBI stated Abu Zubaydahâs capture would help deter future attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsSummary&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0DE5DB1E3AF937A35757C0A9649C8B63 ''NEWS SUMMARY: Arrest May Deter Attacks'' New York Times, April 4, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer stated Abu Zubaydah could provide a treasure-trove of information about al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;NewsRecap&quot;/&gt; Donald Rumsfeld echoed these sentiments claiming Abu Zubaydah was âa man who knows of additional attacksâ, who has âtrained people to do thisâ, and was a big fish who had a fountain of knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;RumsfeldTranscript040302&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=3390 Donald Rumsfeld ''News Transcript'' Department of Defense, April 3, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. government accounts of Abu Zubaydah's importance===
After Abu Zubaydah's capture, officials from the U.S. Government spoke out publicly about Abu Zubaydah's supposed role in al-Qaeda. However, as would later be reported in 2009, the U.S. Government's depiction of Abu Zubaydah was overly inflated and he was, as Justice Department Officials stated, &quot;[t]he above ground support...

While Abu Zubaydah would provide important intelligence on the War on Terror, his value as an intel source was greatly inflated, much like his role in the global terror network.

Despite all of these allegations the U.S. Government has not officially charged Abu Zubaydah with any crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html Department of Defense Military Commissions Cases Website, April 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exploitation of Abu Zubaydah's perceived value===
President Bush personally used Abu Zubaydahâs perceived âvalueâ as a detainee to justify the use of the CIA's harsher interrogation techniques&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/06/washington/06bush_transcript.html?pagewanted=all ''George W. Bush September 2006 Speech'' September 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Abu Zubaydahâs detention in secret CIA prisons around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;BushConcedesCIA&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5776107 ''Bush Concedes CIA Held Suspects in Secret Prisons'' NPR, September 6, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a speech in 2006, President Bush claimed that Abu Zubaydah initially revealed useful intelligence, including information that allegedly helped foil a terrorist attack on American soil, but that Abu Zubaydah became uncooperative.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; It was only then, he reported, that an âalternative set of proceduresâ was used on Abu Zubaydah in order to gain valuable intelligence and were âsafe and lawful.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; He also stated that Abu Zubaydah had received training in how to resist interrogation, and thus more aggressive techniques were mandated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bush092006Speech&quot;/&gt; These claims directly conflict with the reports of the original F.B.I. agents tasked with interrogating Abu Zubaydah who had been receiving crucial pieces of information from him without the use of harsher techniques,&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanOpEd&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SoufanNewsweek&quot;/&gt; as well as other government officials.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTimesProfileZubaydah&quot;&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/abu_zubaydah/index.html ''Abu Zubaydah'' New York Times, April 20, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Iraq War====
The U.S. Government used questionable intel from Abu Zubaydah in order to justify the invasion of Iraq. U.S. officials stated that the allegations that Iraq and al-Qaeda were linked in the training of people on chemical weapons came from Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;HutchesonAndKuhnhenn&quot;&gt;[http://www2.jsonline.com/news/nat/sep02/83149.asp Ron Hutcheson and James Kuhnhenn ''Iraq deal with Congress nears, Bush says'' Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, September 26, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushSaysIraq&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-7430560_ITM ''Bush Says He and Congress Will Band Together on Iraq; Capitol Hill Still Sour'' Knight Ridder/Tribune Business News, September 27, 2002] (Access My Library Link, requires free membership)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;TorturedLie&quot;&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/andrew_sullivan/article6168270.ece Andrew Sullivan ''One tortured lie: that's all it took for war'' The Sunday Times, April 26, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; The officials noted there was no independent verification of his claims.&lt;ref name=&quot;HutchesonAndKuhnhenn&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BushSaysIraq&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government included statements made by Abu Zubaydah in regards to al Qaedaâs ability to obtain a dirty bomb in its attempts to show a link between Iraq and al Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;FritzUmbach&quot;&gt;[http://www.salon.com/opinion/feature/2006/04/13/document_dump/ Fritz Umbach ''Bushâs bogus document dump'' The Salon, April 13, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Senate Intelligence Committee report Abu Zubaydah also âindicated that he had heard that an important al Qaeda associate, Abu Musab al Zarqawi, and others had good relationships with Iraqi intelligence.â&lt;ref name=&quot;StephenHayes&quot;&gt;[http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/004/803czhfn.asp?pg=2 Stephen F.

In the Senate Armed Services Committee report on the abuses of detainees, it was revealed that pressure from the Bush administration was applied to interrogators to find a link between Iraq and Al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/26/opinion/26rich.html Frank Rich ''The Banality of Bush White House Evil'' The New York Times, April 25, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, Major Paul Burney, a psychiatrist with the United States Army, reported that &quot;while we were [at Guantanamo] a large part of the time we were focused on trying to establish a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq and we were not being successful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;&gt;[http://armed-services.senate.gov/Publications/Detainee%20Report%20Final_April%2022%202009.pdf Senate Armed Services Committee ''Inquiry Into the Treatment of Detainees in U.S. Custody'' Senate Armed Services Committee, November 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that higher-ups for more &quot;frustrated&quot; and applied &quot;more and more pressure to resort to measures that might produce more immediate results.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;BanalityOfBush&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdBrayton&quot;&gt;[http://scienceblogs.com/dispatches/2009/05/the_lies_on_torture_just_keep.php Ed Brayton ''The Lies on Torture Just Keep Coming'' Science Blogs, May 4, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, Colonel Lawrence B. Wilkerson, the former chief of staff for former Secretary of State Colin Powell has stated that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Likewise, what I have learned is that as the administration authorized harsh interrogation in April and May of 2002--well before the Justice Department had rendered any legal opinion--its principal priority for intelligence was not aimed at pre-empting another terrorist attack on the U.S. but discovering a smoking gun linking Iraq and al-Qa'ida.

So furious was this effort that on one particular detainee, even when the interrogation team had reported to Cheney's office that their detainee &quot;was compliant&quot; (meaning the team recommended no more torture), the VP's office ordered them to continue the enhanced methods. The detainee had not revealed any al-Qa'ida-Baghdad contacts yet. This ceased only after Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, under waterboarding in Egypt, &quot;revealed&quot; such contacts. Of course later we learned that al-Libi revealed these contacts only to get the torture to stop.&lt;ref name=ArmedServicesDetaineeReport/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====The Military Commissions Act====
President Bush also asked Congress in a speech in September 2006 to formulate special rules in order to try Abu Zubaydah via military commission in Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;WarrenRichey&quot;&gt;[http://www.csmonitor.com/2006/0915/p01s02-usju.html?s=widep Warren Richey ''âAlternativeâ CIA tactics complicate Padilla case'' Christian Science Monitor, September 15, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, in late April 2002 less than one month after Abu Zubaydahâs capture, Justice Department officials stated Abu Zubaydah âis a near-ideal candidate for a tribunal trial.â&lt;ref name=&quot;NeilALewis&quot;&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D04E2DE103FF932A15757C0A9649C8B63 Neail A. Lewis ''A NATION CHALLENGED: THE DETAINEES; U.S. Is Seeking Basis to Charge War Detainees'' New York Times, April 21, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; However, only several months later US Officials acknowledged there was âno rushâ to try Abu Zubaydah via military commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;FrankDavies&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-8932707_ITM Frank Davies ''U.S. readies tribunals for terrorism trials'' The Miami Herald, December 26, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, President Bush stated in an interview that if Congress could pass a âgood billâ out of the Senate in regards to setting up a military commission system, then Abu Zubaydah âis going to go on trial.â&lt;ref name=&quot;BushCNNInterview&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-18409075_ITM Wolf Blitzer ''Interview of George W. Bush'' CNN, September 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government has yet to try Abu Zubaydah by military commission, article 3 court, or in any other capacity.

====The Bush Administration's domestic spying program====
In addition to justifying the use of presently illegal torture techniques, the Bush administration used Abu Zubaydahâs capture as justification to accelerate its domestic spying program to allow quick action on the phone numbers and addresses seized during Abu Zubaydahâs capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;RisenAndLichtblau&quot;&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/12/16/news/spy.php?page=2 James Risen and Eric Lichtblau ''Bush altered rules on spying'' International Herald Tribune, December 17, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Inexplicably the NSA expanded its surveillance beyond the numbers seized during Abu Zubaydahâs capture.&lt;ref name=&quot;AzizHug&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-26038899_ITM Aziz Huq ''Whoâs watching whom?'' League of Women Voters, October 1, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The spying program would later be revamped in order to make it theoretically legal.&lt;ref name=mayer/&gt;

===Growing concerns about Abu Zubaydah's indefinite CIA detention===
In 2004 media coverage of Abu Zubaydah began listing him as a âdisappearedâ prisoner claiming he had no access to the International Red Cross.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReedBrody&quot;&gt;[http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/10/11/opinion/edbrody.php Reed Brody ''Prisoners who disappear'' International Herald Tribune, October 12, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2005, U.S. officials claim the CIA was growing uncomfortable keeping Abu Zubaydah in indefinite custody.&lt;ref name=&quot;JehlAndJohnstonAndLewis&quot;&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P1-105455175.html Douglas Jehl, David Johnston, and Neil A. Lewis ''CIA called uncomfortable with role on war prisoners Holding terror suspects raises concerns'' International Herald Tribune, February 16, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; Less than 18 months later Abu Zubaydah and the other high value detainees who had been in secret CIA custody were transferred to Guantanamo Bay.&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/19/AR2006061901211.html Barton Gellman ''The Shadow War, In a Surprising New Light'' Washington Post, June 20, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his transfer the CIA denied access to Abu Zubaydah even to the Department of Justice's Inspector General who was investigating the United States' treatment of its detainees.&lt;ref name=&quot;EmmaSchwartz&quot;&gt;[http://www.usnews.com/articles/news/2008/05/20/justice-dept-inspector-general-claims-cia-hampered-its-investigation.html Emma Schwartz ''Justice Dept. Inspector General Claims CIA Hampered its Investigation'' US News &amp; World Report, May 20, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to U.S. officials quoted in Ron Suskindâs book, President Bush allegedly told CIA director George Tenet âI said [Abu Zubaydah] was important. Youâre not going to let me lose face on this, are you?â&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;/&gt; Tenet replied âNo sir, Mr. President.â&lt;ref name=&quot;BartonGellman&quot;/&gt;

===U.S. government admits Abu Zubaydah was never a member of al Qaeda===
Top officials in the U.S. government refused to believe Abu Zubaydah was not the operative they believed him to be.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The May 30, 2005 Department of Justice memo noted that while on-scene interrogators believed Abu Zubaydah no longer had any information to disclose, CIA Headquarters ordered additional waterboarding.&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; The interrogators believed the waterboarding was &quot;unnecessary.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;May302005BradburyMemo&quot;/&gt; Orders for the additional waterboarding likely came from Dick Cheney directly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArmedServicesDetaineeReport&quot;/&gt; Additionally, the Bush White House and CIA officials couldn't believe Abu Zubaydah didn't have additional information.&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt; One official stated the pressure from upper levels of government was &quot;tremendous,&quot; and that &quot;[t]hey couldn't stand the idea that there wasn't anything new.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt; The official said, &quot;[t]hey'd say, 'You aren't working hard enough.' There was both a disbelief in what he was saying and also a desire for retribution - a feeling that 'He's going to talk, and if he doesn't talk, we'll do whatever.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;FinnAndWarrick&quot;/&gt;

However, in September 2009, the United States Government finally admitted, during Abu Zubaydah's habeas corpus petition, that Abu Zubaydah had never been a member of al-Qaeda, nor involved in the attacks on the African embassies in 1998, or the attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=GovernmentWithdrawsCharges&gt;{{cite court

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Evidence indicating that Petitioner is not a member of al-Qaida or had ideological differences with al-Qaida is not inconsistent with the factual allegations made in the Government's factual return, because the Government has not contended in this proceeding that Petitioner was a member of al-Qaida or otherwise formally identified with al-Qaida.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Respondent [The United States Government] does not contend that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] was a &quot;member&quot; of al-Qaida in the sense of having sworn a &lt;u&gt;bayat&lt;/u&gt; (allegiance) or having otherwise satisfied any formal criteria that either Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] or al-Qaida may have considered necessary for inclusion in al-Qaida. Nor is the Government detaining Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] based on any allegation that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] views himself as part of al-Qaida as a matter of subjective personal conscience, ideology, or worldview.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
For example, for purposes of this proceeding the Government has not contended that Petitioner [Abu Zubaydah] had any personal involvement in planning or executing either the 1998 embassy bombings... or the attacks on September 11, 2001. Pg. 34
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Charge sheet discrepancies====
In 2005, the U.S. Government charged several detainees at Guantanamo Bay and ordered them to stand trial in Military Commission Tribunals.&lt;ref name=&quot;ArchivedChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsarchives.html ''Department of Defense Website: Archived Charge Sheets'' Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the ten detainees charged, four of them, Binyam Mohamed, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabrad Said bin Al-Qahtani referenced Abu Zubaydah in their charge sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104qahtani.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104sharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104barhoumi.pdf ''Sufyian Barhoumi 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2005ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Nov2005/d20051104muhammad.pdf ''Binyam Mohamed 2005 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Three of the four detainees, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani, had identical 2005 charge sheets and referenced Abu Zubaydah in six different paragraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt; The fourth detainee, Binyam Mohamed, referenced Abu Zubaydah five times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2005ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;

In 2006, before the U.S. Government could hold a trial of the four detainees in a Military Commission Tribunal, the Supreme Court struck down the Tribunals as unconstitutional in Hamdan v. Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;JosephMarguliesGuantanamo&quot;&gt;Joseph Margulies ''Guantanamo and the Abuse of Presidential Power'' Simon &amp; Schuster, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuzanneGoldberg&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2006/jun/30/usa.guantanamo Suzanne Goldenberg ''Supreme Court Rejects Bush Terror Powers'' The Guardian, June 30, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government responded by amending the tribunals, although they were forced to recharge Binyam Mohamed, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi, Sufyian Barhoumi, and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissions.html ''Department of Defense Military Commissions Website'' Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt;

The new 2008 charge sheets contained almost identical charges against each of the four detainees, as were found in their 2005 charge sheets.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Qahtani.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Sharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbiâs 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080529Sufyian.pdf ''Sufyian Barhoumiâs 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2008ChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Mohamed%20-%20sworn0603.pdf ''Binyam Mohamed 2008 Sworn Charges'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Abu Zubaydahâs name was entirely removed from each detaineeâs charge sheet.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtani2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbi2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Barhoumi2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Binyam2008ChargeSheet&quot;/&gt; On October 21, 2008, all charges were dropped against the four men.&lt;ref name=&quot;JaneSutton&quot;&gt;[http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUSTRE49K65120081021?sp=true Jane Sutton ''U.S. drops charges against 5 Guantanamo captives'' Reuters, October 21, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuantanamoJudgeDefies&quot;&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/jan/30/nation/na-guantanamo-judge30?pg=1 Carol J. Williams ''Guantanamo judge defies Obama'' Los Angeles Times, January 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Binyam Mohamed was released from Guantanamo Bay on February 20, 2009 despite his alleged connections to Abu Zubaydah, and thus has been removed from the Department of Defense Military Commissions Page.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCProfileBinyam&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7906381.stm ''Profile: Binyam Mohamed'' BBC News, February 23, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, the alleged emir of [[Khalden Camp]], [[Noor Uthman Muhammed]], was charged in 2008 with conspiring with Abu Zubaydah against the United States. However, the charges against Noor Uthman Muhammed were also completely dropped on October 21, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;JaneSutton&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;GuantanamoJudgeDefies&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government recharged Noor Uthman Muhammed on December 22, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoorUthmanCurrentCharges&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah's name is not found in any of the charges even though he was a facilitator for Noor Uthman Muhammed's Khalden Camp.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoorUthmanCurrentCharges&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydahâs name is also not mentioned in any other detaineeâs charge sheets, not even Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, the admitted mastermind of the 9/11 attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EdPilkington&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2007/mar/15/alqaida.september11 Ed Pilkington '''I was responsible for 9/11, from A to Z' - a confession from GuantÃ¡namo Bay'' The Guardian, March 15, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government has also failed to charge Abu Zubadyah, even though they have charged other high ranking al-Qaeda members, such as Khalid Sheikh Mohamed, who has been in custody less time than Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;CurrentChargeSheets&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KSMCharges&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/d20080509Mohammed.pdf ''Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the U.S. Government recharged two of the men, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi and Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbiCurrentChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/alSharbi.pdf ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi 2009 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtaniCurrentChargeSheet&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/alQahtanisworn.pdf ''Jabran Said bin Al-Qahtani 2009 Charge Sheet'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; Sufyian Barhoumi has not been recharged.&lt;ref name=&quot;BarhoumiChargesPage&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsBarhoumi.html ''Sufyian Barhoumi Military Commissions Page'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 charge sheet of al Sharbi reincorporates Abu Zubaydah in three paragraphs, while the 2009 charge sheet of Al-Qahtani reincorporated Abu Zubaydah in four paragraphs.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbiCurrentChargeSheet&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AlQahtaniCurrentChargeSheet&quot;/&gt; Unlike the 2005 charge sheets, which are archived on the Department of Defense website, Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi's 2008 Charge Sheet has been removed from his page.&lt;ref name=&quot;AlSharbiChargesPage&quot;&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/commissionsSharbi.html ''Ghassan Abdullah al Sharbi Military Commissions Page'' Department of Defense Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

====International cases involving Abu Zubaydah====
Several individuals being held or tried internationally, who have been connected by the U.S. Government to Abu Zubaydah, have had their charges dropped, been released, or received other relief from their handlers.

=====Abousofian Abdelrazik=====
[[Abousofian Abdelrazik]] was alleged by the State Department to be closely associated with Abu Zubaydah.&lt;ref name=&quot;BradFoss&quot;&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-16119183_ITM Brad Foss ''State Department moves against Sudanese-Canadian for alleged terror ties'' The Americaâs Intelligence Wire, July 26, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Canada asked the United Nations to remove Abousfian Abdelrazik from its terrorism watch-list.&lt;ref name=&quot;PaulKoringOttawa&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/LAC.20080502.SUDAN02/TPStory/Front&amp;ord=123654973&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true Paul Koring ''Ottawa wants terrorism suspect taken off watch list'' Globe and Mail, February 5, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; In June, 2009, Canada agreed to repatriate Abousfian Abdelrazik from Sudan where he has been stranded since 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;MichaelComte&quot;&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5hUaf3TZSzmnZORHAtaID8uB1DNnw Michael Comte ''Canada will repatriate man said linked to Al-Qaeda'' AFP, June 18, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Mohamed Harkat=====
Abu Zubaydah supposedly knew [[Mohamed Harkat]] âsince the early 90âsâ&lt;ref name=&quot;PeterCheney&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/ArticleNews/front/RTGAM/20021218/wxalge1218/Front/homeBN/breakingnews Peter Cheney ''Bin Laden lieutenant identified suspect in Canada'' The Globe and Mail, December 18, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt; and claimed Harkat ran a guest house in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaCourtUpholds&quot;&gt;''Court upholds Harkatâs security certificate'' CTV News, March 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Mohamed Harkatâs attorney sought access to Abu Zubaydah for testimony relating to Harkatâs trial, but the US refused to respond to his requests.&lt;ref name=&quot;HarkatLawyer&quot;&gt;[http://www.edmontonsun.com/News/Canada/2007/08/26/4448108.html ''Lawyer for accused terrorist seeks access to Guantanamo detainee'' Edmonton Sun, August 26, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally in Harkatâs Canadian trial, however, Abu Zubaydahâs claims were not part of the charges brought against Harkat.&lt;ref name=&quot;ColinFreeze&quot;&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080222.wcertificate0222/BNStory/National/?cid=al_gam_mostdiscuss Colin Freeze, Tu Thanh Ha, and Omar El Akkad ''Secret files against terror suspects revealed'' Globe and Mail, February 23, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; After CIA director Michael Haydenâs public admittance of Zubaydahâs waterboarding, Canadian officials deleted all references to Zubaydahâs statements in its public dossier.&lt;ref name=&quot;CanadaTakesAStand&quot;&gt;[http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=87975164 The Bryant Park Project ''Canada Takes a Stand Against Alleged U.S. Torture'' National Public Radio, March 7, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman for the Canadian Security Intelligence Service stated âThe CSIS director has stated publicly that torture is morally repugnant and not particularly reliable.

====Ahmed Ressam and the Millennium Plot====
In April 2001, Ahmed Ressam was convicted of plotting to detonate a bomb at the Los Angeles International Airport.&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSAhmedRessam&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/cron.html ''Amhed Ressamâs Millennium Plot'' PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamTestimony&quot;&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/trail/inside/testimony.html ''Ahmed Ressam's Testimony at Mokhtar Haouari's Trial'' PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; Ahmed Ressam had previously trained at the Khalden camp before coming to the United States to undertake his mission.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PBSAhmedRessam&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamTestimony&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah admits in his CSRT testimony that he recommended to the leader of Khalden Camp that Ahmed Ressam be allowed to train there.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah further testified that he facilitated Ahmed Ressamâs travel to the camp as well as to Algeria once Ressamâs training was complete.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government alleges, in Abu Zubaydahâs summary of evidence, that Ahmed Ressam identified Abu Zubaydah as the leader of the Khalden camp and an associate of Usama Bin Laden âequal to and not subordinate to UBL.â&lt;ref name=&quot;AbuZubaydahSummaryOfEvidence&quot;&gt;[http://www.dod.mil/pubs/foi/detainees/csrt_arb/000784-000819.pdf ''Abu Zubaydah Summary of Evidence'' Department of Defense]&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. Government further alleges that Ahmed Ressam stated that Abu Zubaydah had âknown of Ahmed Ressamâs operation, although not specifically the date and exact targetâ and that Abu Zubaydah wanted Ressam to acquire âfraudulently-obtained Canadian passportsâ for himself and five others, in order to facilitate their travel into the United States to âpossibly bomb several cities.â&lt;ref name=&quot;AbuZubaydahSummaryOfEvidence&quot;/&gt;

Abu Zubaydah admits he attempted to procure Canadian passports for Ahmed Ressam and other trainees, but not for &quot;terrorist-related activities.â.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah denies ever having participated in the planning of the Millennium Plot or encouraging Ahmed Ressam to attack American targets or civilians.&lt;ref name=&quot;CsrtAbuZubaydahVerbatimTranscript&quot;/&gt; The U.S. Government has not produced any further evidence of Abu Zubaydahâs alleged role in the Millennium Plot, nor was this connection even mentioned in Ahmed Ressam's criminal trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamCaseDocs&quot;&gt;Ressam Case Documents, Accessed via PACER, December 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Ressam's confessions were only brought up during his sentencing in an attempt to mitigate the sentence he would receive, and he later recanted them.&lt;ref name=&quot;RessamCaseDocs&quot;/&gt;

===Abu Zubaydah's mental health===
Some people contest Abu Zubaydah's mental health. Ron Suskind noted in his book, &lt;u&gt;The One Percent Doctrine&lt;/u&gt;, that Zubaydah turned out to be mentally ill, keeping a diary &quot;in the voice of three people: Hani 1, Hani 2, and Hani 3&quot; -- a boy, a young man and a middle-aged alter ego.&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah's diaries spanned ten years and recorded in numbing detail &quot;what he ate, or wore, or trifling things [people] said.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EggenPincusFBICIADebate&quot;/&gt; Dan Coleman, then the FBI's top al-Qaeda analyst, told a senior bureau official, &quot;This guy is insane, certifiable, split personality.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; According to Suskind, this judgment was &quot;echoed at the top of CIA and was briefed to the President and Vice President.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SuskindOnePercent&quot;/&gt; Dan Coleman, the FBI's senior expert on al Qaeda, echoed many of Suskind's sentiments in an interview with the Washington Post. Coleman stated Zubaydah was a &quot;safehouse keeper&quot; with mental problems, who &quot;claimed to know more about al-Qaeda and its inner workings than he really did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EggenPincusFBICIADebate&quot;/&gt; Abu Zubaydah's co-counsel, Joseph Margulies, wrote in an OpEd in the LA Times that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Partly as a result of injuries he suffered while he was fighting the communists in Afghanistan, partly as a result of how those injuries were exacerbated by the CIA and partly as a result of his extended isolation, Abu Zubaydah's mental grasp is slipping away. Today, he suffers blinding headaches and has permanent brain damage. He has an excruciating sensitivity to sounds, hearing what others do not. The slightest noise drives him nearly insane. In the last two years alone, he has experienced about 200 seizures. Already, he cannot picture his mother's face or recall his father's name. Gradually, his past, like his future, eludes him.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarguliesZubaydah&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-margulies30-2009apr30,0,3309097.story Joseph Margulies ''Abu Zubaydah's suffering'' Los Angeles Times, April 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Saudi and Pakistani connection allegations==
[[Gerald Posner]] in his book &quot;Why America Slept: The Failure to Prevent 9/11&quot; claimed that Abu Zubaydahwas duped by U.S. interrogators masquerading as Saudis and using painkillers and [[sodium pentathol]], sometimes called &quot;truth serum&quot;. Zubaydah, he writes, thought he was in a Saudi prison, when in fact he was in Afghanistan. Posner says Zubaydah, &quot;relieved&quot; to find he was being quizzed by people he thought were Saudis, provided them with phone numbers for a senior member of the Saudi royal family who would &quot;tell you what to do.&quot; He says the U.S. interrogators were stunned when the numbers were traced to Prince [[Ahmed bin Salman bin Abdul Aziz]], a nephew of [[Fahd of Saudi Arabia|King Fahd]]. 

When the agents accused Zubaydah of lying, he revealed more details of Saudi and Pakistani ties to bin Laden, the author says, and in the space of one week, three of the four persons named by him were dead. Prince Ahmed, 43, died of a heart attack on July 22, 2002. The next day, a car crash killed Saudi Prince [[Sultan bin Faisal bin Turki al-Saud]], 41. A week later, Prince [[Fahd bin Turki bin Saud al-Kabir]], 25, reportedly died &quot;of thirst&quot; while traveling east of [[Riyadh]]. Seven months later, a plane crash &quot;in clear weather,&quot; Posner says, killed Pakistani Air Marshal [[Mushaf Ali Mir]], his wife and several aides in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[Author: Did Saudis know of 9-11 plot? by RICHARD PYLE]&lt;/ref&gt;
