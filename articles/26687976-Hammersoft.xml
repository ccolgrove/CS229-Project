'''Charles &quot;Charlie&quot; Haynes''', played by [[George Costigan]], is an old friend of [[Rodney Blackstock]] ([[Patrick Mower]]). He made his first on-screen appearance on 8 March 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/spoilers/a204865/holly-breaks-up-with-aaron.html|title=Holly breaks up with Aaron|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi MÃ©dias|Hachette Filipacchi (UK) Ltd]]|first=Kris|last=Green|date=8 March 2010|accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charlie was first seen when Rodney was on a date with a glamorous woman, revealing that he and Rodney were friends years ago but lost contact. The next day, Charlie and Rodney were having a drink in the [[Woolpack]], and Diane realised that this was the 'famous' Charlie that Rodney used to talk about years ago. Charlie clearly fancies Diane, making [[Douglas Potts|Doug Potts]] dislike him, seeing him as a rival for Diane's affections.

Charlie returns from France with presents for Diane &amp; Doug. When Doug sees that his present is a box of cigars, he tells Charlie he doesn't smoke so Charlie buys the drinks to apologise. Later that week, Diane invites Charlie to dinner as Doug had to work late. After the meal, the pair kiss. A couple of weeks later, Diane and Charlie have become a couple and go to France on holiday to see where Charlie lives, taking Diane's stepdaughter, [[Victoria Sugden]]. Weeks on, Charlie tells Diane he is returning to France for good so when Diane has to decide whether to stay in Emmerdale or move to France. She decides to go to France with Charlie, despite his having an inoperable brain tumour.  

Charlie returned on 23 July while Diane and Val are searching for him. They go to his chateau  and ask to see Charlie, but no one appears to have heard of, let alone seen him. Diane and Val wonder what is going on. They then ask to see the owner (thinking this will get them further) but then meet the truthful owner who also has not heard of Charlie. Diane finally puts two and two together and she breaks down in Val's arms, devastated at Charlie's actions, leaving her practically penniless.  Charlie is seen later on in a restaurant with another woman returning a handbag which was seemingly stolen by a mugger, much similar to the scenario with Diane. This scene confirms the fact that Charlie is, in fact, a conman, and preys on lonely women for their cash.

On 18 March 2010, Sue wants to go to the Grange Restaurant in the village despite Rodney wanting to hide his cover as the restaurant is owned by [[Eric Pollard|Eric]] and [[Val Pollard]].

'''Rosalind &quot;Roz&quot; Fielding''' is a friend of [[Holly Barton]]'s from college. At first she appeared to be just a typical normal teenager but is later seen to be giving drugs to Holly. On Holly's 19th birthday Roz gives her some drugs in The Woolpack, when Holly's parents find out that Holly has been kicked out of college they confront her and tell Roz to leave.

Holly is later banned from seeing or calling Roz. When Holly's father, [[John Barton (Emmerdale)|John]], accuses Holly of stealing ketamine, Holly stays at Roz's house. Holly later swaps the ketamine with Roz for [[cocaine]]. Holly later runs away from home and John and Moira go and see Roz thinking that Holly is staying at her house again but Roz tells them that she has not heard from Holly.

When Holly later returns home, John calls Roz and asks her to come and see Holly to give her some emotional support to help her cure her drug addiction. Roz and Holly go for a walk in the fields and talk but Holly then begins asking Roz for more drugs and they argue. John and Holly's brother [[Adam Barton (Emmerdale)|Adam]] witness the argument and Roz tells them about Holly's request for drugs. In November Roz returns again to see Holly but is sent away by Moira and Adam. She returns the following week and John reluctantly lets her in to speak to Holly and this appears to make her feel better. Roz tells Moira that she believes Holly is doing better than she expected.

The following day Roz returns but Adam confronts her and they argue. Moira overhears the argument whilst tending to Holly. Adam orders Roz to leave. Roz hides in the barn and waits for Moira to leave. She then sneaks into the house to see Holly and attempts to speak to her. Holly is asleep and Roz realises that she has taken more heroin. Moira returns and tells Roz to leave. Roz tries to convince Moira that Holly has taken more drugs but Moira dismisses her claims. Adam enters the house and overhears their argument. Believing Roz, Adam tries to ring John to tell him about the situation but Moira tries to stop him. Adam and Roz both realise that Moira has been buying heroin for Holly and Roz leaves in shock.

Roz returns on 16 December to see how Holly is doing. Moira apologises to Roz for misjudging her and Roz accepts it. Holly comes downstairs and is pleased to see Roz. Roz remarks that Holly looks better than when she last saw her. Holly asks Moira if Roz can take her to the clinic to get her methadone but Roz and Moira both decline, thinking it is too soon for her. Roz offers to come with her and Moira so they can catch up with each other's news and Moira agrees. When they return home Roz and Holly sit on the sofa, and after Moira leaves the house, Roz asks Holly how she is getting on and Holly tells her that she still suffers from withdrawal symptoms but doesn't want to hurt her family any more than she already has. Roz tells Holly that she has also given up using drugs. After her father throws her out, Roz subsequently moves in with the Bartons at Butler's Farm and later secures a job at Sharma and Sharma sweet factory.

Roz later becomes disullusioned with her job and takes a strong dislike to her boss [[Nikhil Sharma]]. After feeling that Nikhil has been treating the factory workers badly Roz instigates a strike. Nikhil's brother [[Jai Sharma|Jai]] manages to convince Roz and the other employees to return to work. However, Roz reveals to Holly that a friend has offered her a job in Bradford at a textile factory, designing patterns for products and tells her that she has been offered a flat there from a friend. Roz later calls Nikhil and resigns from her job. She packs her belongings up and after bidding farewell to Holly and the Bartons, she leaves Butler's Farm and departs the village.

}}

'''Detective Constable Laura Prior''' is a police officer investigating the murder of [[Mark Wylde]] alongside [[Nick Henshall|DS Nick Henshall]] after Mark's body was discovered in the woods by [[Sam Dingle]]. After questioning all members of both the Wylde and Lamb families, the detectives arrest [[Nathan Wylde]] on suspicion of his father's murder but he is later released due to a lack of evidence. The detectives later arrest Nathan's half-brother [[Ryan Lamb]] after Nathan frames him by planting the murder weapon at the garage where he works and also stealing and planting a gold chain with Ryan's DNA on it at the murder scene. After questioning Ryan, Prior and Henshall charge him with Mark's murder. 

Prior returns on 14 January 2011 to investigate the arson attack in which [[Viv Hope]] and [[Terry Woods (Emmerdale)|Terry Woods]] are killed. Unbeknownst to the detective, her colleague Henshall, who has begun a relationship with [[Katie Sugden]], is actually the culprit responsible for the blaze. Henshall's frequent mood swings following the attack lead Prior to suspect he is overworked. Together, they question Katie and [[Chas Dingle]], and Katie airs her suspicion that the attacker may have been the same person who has recently been making prank telephone calls to them and broke into their home weeks earlier. Chas is unsure, as she believes that her ex-boyfriend [[Carl King]] could have started the fire. [[Gennie Walker]] later returns home and tells Prior that she believed [[Andy Sugden]] started the fire and that he was also responsible for the earlier harassment. After stating that both Carl and Andy will be interviewed, the detectives leave. They later return to question Gennie, and she states she remains convinced Andy was responsible. Henshall and Prior turn up at Butler's Farm later in the week and escort Andy to the police station to be questioned, where he protests his innocence. After the interview, Prior remarks to Henshall that they have no evidence against Andy and just hearsay and speculation. On 20 January, Prior attends Terry's funeral with Henshall. At the service, Prior notices Henshall's discomfort and asks him if he is alright but he brushes off her concerns.

On 1 February, Andy goes to the police station and makes a complaint to Prior about Henshall for harassing him. Initially Prior tells Andy that Henshall is just doing his job and has not broken any rules but Andy then tells her about Henshall's relationship with Katie and his suspicions that Henshall is trying to fit him up to ensure that he cannot spoil their relationship. Prior is surprised by Andy's revelation, having been previously unaware of the relationship. The following day, Prior confronts Henshall as he comes into work and he is forced to admit he is seeing Katie. Realising Henshall is jeopardizing the case by dating her, Prior reports him to senior officers. Henshall is taken off the case by their Detective Inspector and he angrily confronts Prior in the locker room, frightening her with his outburst of rage. Henshall accuses Prior of ruining his further promotion chances and thinks she is jealous of Katie. The following day, Prior turns up at Victoria Cottage to review Katie, Chas and Gennie's witness statements, only to find Henshall there. He mocks Prior, before she asks for privacy with Katie, who tells her that on the night of the attack she had been out for dinner with Henshall and after a confrontation with Andy, they had ended their relationship.

Prior later goes to visit Carl to go through his statement. She is surprised to discover a key piece of information missing from Carl's original statement in that he nearly crashed into a car (Henshall's) when he drove into the village and just before he spotted the fire. Carl tells her that he was not shown his statement to sign and Prior is surprised as that was police procedure. On 7 February, Prior confronts Henshall in The Woolpack and demands an explanation of why he omitted information from both Katie and Carl's statements, to which he tells her that he did not think the evidence was reliable. Prior warns Henshall that if she discovers the truth then she will not defend him. On 15 February, Henshall spots Prior speaking to a detective in the investigation room at the police station. He tells Henshall that Prior has discovered a CCTV camera across the road from the shop where the phone used to make the nuisance calls to Victoria Cottage was bought from.

On 16 February, DC Darren Foster shows Prior a section of the CCTV footage which reveals Henshall leaving the shop after buying the phone. Foster zooms in on his face and Prior is shocked to recognize her superior officer. She then mobilizes resources to track Henshall down and tells Foster to task officers to warn Katie. Prior goes to the village and questions Chas outside Victoria Cottage about Katie and Henshall's whereabouts and Chas tells her that they have gone. When Prior asks where, Chas tells her that they are packing their bags at Henshall's house and are going away for a while. Prior then gives her mobile number to Chas and tells her to call her if either Katie or Henshall contact her. She then gets into her car and leaves. Prior and Foster go to Henshall's house and knock on the door. Foster suggests breaking the door down to save Katie but Prior refuses, saying that they would make the situation worse. Prior sends Foster round the back of the house whilst she calls her Detective Inspector.

Prior waits by the police cordon as Andy and Gennie arrive. She reassures Andy that they have the situation under control. She then asks if either of them have a number for Katie's mobile and Gennie tells her that she does. Prior then calls Katie's mobile and speaks to Henshall and he mockingly asks her if they were unable to afford a proper negotiator. Prior jokes that she wants to use a personal touch. Prior tells Henshall that they found the CCTV footage and all it tells them is that he made the prank phone calls. Prior tells Henshall that he should tell them his side of the story but he refuses, telling her that it is too late. Henshall is about to hang up and Prior asks him if she can talk to Katie. Henshall refuses but when Prior tells him that she needs to know if Katie is OK, Henshall forces her over to the window. Andy tries to break through the police cordon and has to be dragged back.  

As night falls, Prior continues to call Henshall's phone with no luck. The Chief Inspector in charge of the siege tells her that as she cannot handle Henshall he will send a team in. Prior tells him that she is doing her best and Foster tells her that they should storm the place and she reminds him that Henshall is dangerous and has already killed two people and they should not risk Katie's life. She asks for Foster's mobile and he gives it to her, telling her that he has a low credit. Prior then goes up to the house and knocks on the door. She tries to speak to Henshall through the letterbox and asks him to let her in. Henshall does not respond so she puts Foster's mobile through the letterbox. Henshall continues to ignore her and she gives up. Prior tries to call the phone repeatedly but still gets no reply. Prior then gets a loudspeaker from the back of a patrol car and asks Henshall to answer his phone but he ignores her. The Chief Inspector tells Prior that she did her best and that they will send a team in. Andy tries to break through the cordon again and as he is dragged away, he tells Prior that he will hold her responsible if anything happens to Katie. Gennie asks what the next course of action will be and Prior tells her that she will carry on trying to talk to Henshall for as long and possible and reassures her that the armed response teams are trained for the type of situation they were in.

A shot later rings out and Prior is apprehensive, thinking Henshall has killed Katie but she emerges from the house unharmed. Katie tells Prior that Henshall has shot himself and she is overcome with shock.

===Storylines===
Alicia arrives in the village to tell Leyla not to attend their mother's funeral. Leyla ignores her and attends. Alicia is not happy and tells Leyla to forget about making up. Alicia comes back to the village after her marriage breaks down and she argues with Leyla in her shop in front of [[Eric Pollard]] ([[Christopher Chittell]]) and [[Douglas Potts|Doug Potts]] ([[Duncan Preston]]). It is revealed that Alicia's son, Jacob, is actually Leyla's son. Their mother had persuaded Leyla to give her baby to her sister, as Alicia suffers from fertility problems. Leyla asks Alicia and Jacob to stay with her and her boyfriend [[David Metcalfe]] ([[Matthew Wolfenden]]) when she discovers that they are homeless. Alicia gets a job as barmaid at The Woolpack and she and Leyla disagree over Jacob's upbringing. When Jacob eats a cake with nuts in it and suffers an allergic reaction at [[T.J. Woods]]'s (Connor Lee) birthday party, Alicia accuses Leyla of being neglectful. She later starts feuding with [[Chas Dingle]] ([[Lucy Pargeter]]) after Chas complains about the quality of a drink she serves. When Alicia attends [[Genesis Walker|Gennie Walker]]'s ([[Sian Reese-Williams]]) lingerie party, she samples some underwear that Chas had been going to buy and tells her that she is too old for sexy lingerie. Chas locks her in a wardrobe and steals her clothes in revenge. On Bonfire Night, Alicia argues with [[Eve Jenson]] ([[Suzanne Shaw]]) after Eve accuses Jacob of putting a toffee in her hat. Alicia lets [[Nathan Wylde]] ([[Lyndon Ogbourne]]) buy her a drink in the pub, which concerns both Leyla and David as they have both had prior dealings with Nathan when he attempted to blackmail them both. Leyla tells Alicia what Nathan is really like and Alicia later decides not to go home with Nathan after witnessing him fight with his half-brother [[Ryan Lamb]] ([[James Sutton (actor)|James Sutton]]). Alicia later flirts with businessman [[Declan Macey]] ([[Jason Merrells]]). Alicia asks Leyla to make Jacob a costume for his school nativity play, but when Leyla acts too maternal towards him, Alicia is forced to assert her authority as Jacob's mother.     

Declan invites Alicia to his housewarming party at Home Farm. Alicia and Declan flirt when he shows her around the house and he invites her upstairs, but they are interrupted by Declan's ex-wife [[Ella Hart]] ([[Corrinne Wicks]]) and their daughter [[Mia Macey|Mia]] ([[Sapphire Elia]]). Alicia leaves, despite Declan begging her to stay. Alicia's ex-husband Justin visits Jacob and he and Alicia argue. Alicia goes to The Woolpack and has a drink with Declan, she later goes home with him. Alicia spends the night at Home Farm and the following morning Ella offers to cook breakfast for them. Leyla becomes angry when Alicia does not pick Jacob up from school and that she asked [[Amy Wyatt]] (Chelsea Halfpenny) to babysit for her instead. After attending Jacob's play, which Justin did not attend, Leyla asks Alicia if she told Justin when the play was. Alicia tells her that she told Justin the play was on a different day to see where Justin's priorities are. Leyla is disgusted with Alicia's emotional blackmailing of Justin. Leyla and Alicia argue about Jacob and Alicia going out and getting Amy to babysit him. Jacob overhears their arguments. Alicia goes back to The Woolpack where Ryan offers to buy her a drink. She later goes back to his house. Alicia returns home and discovers that Jacob has gone. A search begins and Alicia blames Leyla as she was supposed to be looking after him. Justin blames Alicia for Jacob's disappearance. The police get involved and Alicia gives a press conference. During another argument, Justin reveals that he is Jacob's biological father. Alicia does not initially believe Justin and accuses him of lying, but Leyla admits the truth. Alicia accuses Leyla of being jealous of her and everything she had. David finds Jacob in an abandoned building and she comforts Jacob as he is carried to an ambulance.

Jacob is discharged from hospital and Alicia brings him back to Leyla's. Leyla tells Alicia that she gave her Jacob because she believed that she would be a better mother to him. Alicia accuses Leyla of betraying her and Leyla apologises. Alicia refuses to let Justin see Jacob and he tells her that he will fight her for custody. Leyla defends her sister when Justin accuses Alicia of being a bad mother. Alicia thanks Leyla for helping her and she tries to persuade David to take Leyla back. Alicia is furious when Justin picks Jacob up from school without informing her. Leyla tells her that Jacob is safe and David tells her that if she were to sort out a custody arrangement then Justin would not resort to taking Jacob. Justin later texts Alicia, telling her that he has taken Jacob bowling and Alicia reveals her fear that Jacob will start hating her as a result of Justin spoiling him. Alicia continues to refuse to an agreement with Justin about a custody agreement. 

Leyla realises that Alicia has confiscated Jacob's phone, so he cannot contact Justin. Alicia gives in and tells Jacob that he can call Justin on condition that he do his homework and go straight to bed. Leyla tells Alicia that she should not stop Justin from seeing Jacob and that Jacob misses his father. Alicia blames Justin for upsetting Jacob and tells Leyla she is doing what is best. Alicia later calls Justin and, with Leyla's help, agrees to let him have access to Jacob on condition that he drop the custody battle. Justin agrees and Leyla tells Alicia that she made the right decision. On Valentine's Day, [[Andy Sugden]] ([[Kelvin Fletcher]]) offers to treat Alicia to dinner at the B&amp;B as friends. Alicia soon realises that the reason Andy is there is to spy on Henshall who is having a meal with Andy's ex-wife [[Katie Sugden|Katie]] ([[Sammy Winward]]). Henshall then confronts Andy and despite Alicia insisting that they are there for a quiet meal and not to stir up trouble, she is unable to prevent an argument between the two men. Andy later apologises to her.

Andy asks Alicia to pick [[Sarah Dingle|Sarah]] up from school for him and she does so, also collecting Jacob and Sarah's uncle [[Noah Tate]] (Jack Downham) and takes them home. Sarah's mother [[Debbie Dingle]] ([[Charley Webb]]) is unhappy when Alicia brings Noah and Sarah home as she had asked Andy to pick them up. Debbie is dismissive when Alicia asks if she can look after Jacob. Alicia and Andy go on another date at the B&amp;B and a few days later he tells her he has tickets for a Take That tribute band. Alicia tells Andy that she is strapped for cash and Andy offers to loan her the money, but she refuses to take it. Andy asks [[Paddy Kirk]] ([[Dominic Brunt]]) and [[Rhona Goskirk]] ([[Zoe Henry]]) to give Alicia a job, without telling her. When Paddy and Rhona later inform Alicia in the pub that her services as receptionist will not be needed, she is surprised and confronts Andy.

In October 2011, Alicia's partner Andy and his former flame Debbie find out that something is wrong with their daughter Sarah and they find out by the hospital that she has got a bone marrow disease and needs another doner otherwise she may die, so they try and get the whole village to do a test but there is no sign of luck, so Debbie and Andy have to go through hospital treatments to try and get a good match, but it doesn't work, so Debbie comes up with a plan for her and Andy to have another child so that they baby can help Sarah, but Alicia is not happy about this, but Andy goes through with it anyway, so when they reveal to the hospital that they are a couple and are having another child, they ask if they are living together to make sure that the new baby will also be brought up well, so Debbie is forced to think again, but she comes up with an idea that her partner, [[Cameron Murray]] ([[Dominic Power]]) will move in with Alicia and Andy move back in with Debbie and then the reveal to the village that they are an item which leaves Alicia and Cameron livid, but they go along with it anyway for Sarah's sake.

During his time he becomes friends with many of the villagers. Towards the end of 2010 he forms a close relationship with [[Lisa Dingle]], it becomes apparent that he has feelings for her. Lisa's husband [[Zak Dingle|Zak]], is oblivious to this but forms a good friendship with Derek as he finds jobs for Zak for his delivery van business. On 6 January, Derek and Lisa are both working overtime in the factory together, while everyone else is out at the pub. During this time Derek attacks and rapes Lisa and calls her &quot;a cheap little hussey&quot; when she rejects him. He locks Lisa in the factory and tells her to keep it as their little secret, just after Jai and [[Charity Tate]], attempt to enter the factory and believe Derek and Lisa have gone home as the factory is locked. After Lisa demands to be allowed to go home, Derek lets her out just as Zak and their daughter [[Belle Dingle|Belle]] arrive but Lisa does not tell Zak about the rape. Zak offers Derek a drink at the pub but Lisa wishes to go home. Afterwards Derek goes to the pub and Jai confronts him and asks him why the factory was locked and Derek tells him that Lisa was a bit jumpy from being on her own so they locked the factory to feel secure. The following day, Lisa orders Derek to stay away from her and her family. Derek acts as if nothing has happened and Lisa is openly hostile towards him, noticed by her colleagues and friends. Derek attends a school play in which his nephew is a member of the cast. Lisa's step-grandson, [[Samson Dingle|Samson]] is also in the production and Lisa is forced to sit near Derek during the performance. Afterwards, Lisa repeats her demands that Derek stay away from her. In February, Lisa is concerned when Derek starts flirting with her colleague [[Lizzie Lakely]] and asks her out on a date. Lisa then discovers that both Derek and Lizzie have signed up for overtime and she fears that he could strike again. Lisa tells Derek to stay away from Lizzie but he defiantly tells her that she cannot tell him who he can and cannot speak to. Lisa tries to convince Lizzie to stay clear of Derek but she is unsuccessful and Lizzie accuses her of being jealous. The following day, Lisa begs Lizzie to give up her overtime and the women argue and Derek gets involved. Lisa then reveals to Lizzie that Derek raped her. Derek attempts to deny Lisa's accusation and claims that she made a pass at him and that he turned her down, not wanting to betray Zak, but the other factory workers are not convinced and believe Lisa. Jai and his brother [[Nikhil Sharma|Nikhil]] then suspend Derek from work and tell him to go home and he threatens to sue them. The following day Derek returns to the factory to the astonishment of the other workers and asks Jai and Nikhil if he can talk to them in their office but they refuse and tell Derek to go home. In frustration, Derek resigns from his job and leaves. On 14 March, the police reveal that there is not enough evidence to prosecute Derek for the rape. A furious Zak tracks Derek down to his home. He forces his way into the house and attacks Derek. Lisa follows Zak and manages to stop him from killing Derek. Zak then demands that Derek admits to raping Lisa but he refuses. Derek lies to Zak, claiming that Lisa was obsessed with him, which angers Lisa and she also demands that Derek admits to raping her. She then describes the details of the attack in front of Zak. Zak then tells Derek that he has not got away with his crime and that he will get his comeuppance one day. Zak and Lisa then leave and Derek is clearly shaken by their words. The following week, Lisa receives a letter from the Crown Prosecution Service telling her that Derek has raped another woman and has been arrested and charged and that her rape case was under review.

'''Dermot Macey''' is a character played by former ''[[Father Ted]]'' actor [[Frank Kelly]]. He arrived in Emmerdale on 21 December 2010. He departed on 31 August 2011.

On 28 April 2011, it was announced that Frank Kelly had quit Emmerdale, to work closer to his home in Ireland and that Dermot would leave in the summer. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s12/emmerdale/news/a316926/frank-kelly-announces-emmerdale-exit.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Dermot arrived in Emmerdale to spend Christmas with his family and to make amends with his son [[Declan Macey]]. He was first seen when he was standing in the bus shelter and was seen by Declan, who went up to him and gave him money to make up some reason why he can't stay for Christmas, although when Declan got back to Home Farm Dermot was sitting with Ella and Mia.

Since his arrival his eye has been caught by [[Pearl Ladderbanks]], who he takes quite a fancy to and Pearl agrees to let him buy a drink for her. The one person who has not taken to Dermot is [[Alan Turner (Emmerdale)|Alan Turner]] who thinks that Dermot is not the right sort of person Pearl should be going for and has made it quite clear that Turner has a soft spot for Pearl.

In February 2011 Dermot brought Pearl a drink in [[The Woolpack]] and said how nice she is and was flirting with her all night, but he made a comment which he did not mean to say about her weight, which made Pearl quite angry and decided to ignore him for the rest of that night.
