'''Coal Lake''' is a long, sinuous lake located approximately {{convert|60|km|abbr=on}} southeast of the city of [[Edmonton]], just northeast of the city of [[Wetaskiwin]]. The lake is glacial meltwater channel from the last [[ice age]]. 

The lake starts east of [[Kavanagh, Alberta]], and ends near [[Gwynne, Alberta]]. Coal Lake was named in [[1892]] by J.D.A. Fitzpatrick, a Dominion [[Surveying|Land Surveyor]], for the coal beds present in many places along the northeast shore.
