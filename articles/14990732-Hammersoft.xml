The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[New York Jets]] season''' was the 49th season for the club and the 39th season in the [[National Football League]]. The team succeeded in improving upon their 4â12 record from [[2007 New York Jets season|2007]], but did not make the playoffs.

==Offseason==
===Signings===
The Jets used a large amount of [[salary cap]] room to make several high-profile acquisitions in the offseason. On February 29, the team signed former [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] [[Guard (American football)|left guard]] [[Alan Faneca]] to a five-year, $40 million contract. The deal made Faneca the highest paid [[offensive lineman]] in the National Football League.&lt;ref name=Faneca&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3272497|title=Faneca agrees to five-year $40 million deal with Jets|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-03-02|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets then signed former [[Arizona Cardinals]] [[linebacker]] [[Calvin Pace]] to a six-year, $42 million deal.&lt;ref name=Pace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3275059|title=Pace to get $22M guaranteed in big deal with Jets|author=Pasquerelli, Len|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pace had 6 Â½ sacks in 2007, and was considered to fit well with the Jets' [[American football strategy|3â4 defense]].&lt;ref name=Pace/&gt;&lt;ref name=Battista&gt;{{cite web|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D06E3DC153EF937A35750C0A96E9C8B63&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=Calvin+Pace&amp;st=nyt|title=PRO FOOTBALL; Jets Add 2, And Giants Sign Safety|author=Battista, Judy|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=2008-03-04|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jets continued to attempt to improve the offensive line by signing [[Detroit Lions]] [[Offensive tackle|right tackle]] [[Damien Woody]] to a five-year $25.5 million contract.&lt;ref name=Woody&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3275142|title=Woody gives Jets four former first-round draft picks on O-line|author=Smith, Michael|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-03-03|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other notable free agent signings included [[Fullback (American football)|fullback]] [[Tony Richardson (American football)|Tony Richardson]], [[cornerbacks]] [[Andre Woolfolk]] &amp; [[Ty Law]], [[tight end]] [[Bubba Franks]], and [[running back]] [[Jesse Chatman]].

Perhaps the Jets most significant offseason acquisition was veteran and former [[Green Bay Packers]] quarterback [[Brett Favre]]. Favre, the NFL's all-time leader in touchdown passes, completions, passing yards, interceptions, wins and consecutive starts by a quarterback, was picked up in a trade during training camp. Favre finished the 2007 season second in MVP voting and was named starter of the [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Pro Bowl team.

==Schedule==
Matchups were determined at the end of the 2007 season based on the league's [[Regular season (NFL)|scheduling formula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newyorkjets.com/news/articles/show/1035-2008-opponents-are-set|title=2008 Opponents Are Set|publisher=newyorkjets.com|date=2007-12-26|accessdate=2008-04-15}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with home and away games against each of their traditional rivals in the [[American Football Conference East Division|AFC East]], the Jets played each of the teams from the [[American Football Conference West Division|AFC West]] and [[National Football Conference West Division|NFC West]] divisions, as per the NFL's annual rotation. The NFL revealed its schedule for all 256 regular season games on April 15, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d807c555e&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true|title=2008 NFL schedule|publisher=NFL.com|date=2008-04-15|accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; One notable game in the schedule was the Jets' first game televised on the [[NFL Network]], against the [[JetsâPatriots rivalry|division rival]] [[New England Patriots]]. Game times from weeks 12 through 17 were subject to change in accordance with the NFL's [[NFL on television#Flexible scheduling|flexible scheduling]] policy; two games were affected by this policy.

====Game summary====
The Jets started with quarterback [[Brett Favre]] against a [[Miami Dolphins]] team that was sporting new starting quarterback and former Jets starting quarterback [[Chad Pennington]]. Favre got the Jets on the scoreboard first in the first quarter with a play-action pass that found [[Jerricho Cotchery]] at the 10-yard line en route to a 56-yard touchdown. However, [[Mike Nugent]] sprained his thigh on the following kickoff, and when he attempted and missed a 32-yard field goal attempt, Nugent was brought out of the game. Miami then responded, with Chad Pennington marching the Dolphins down to the 6-yard line. From there, Pennington connected with [[Anthony Fasano]] for a 5-yard touchdown, tying the game. On the following drive for the Jets, coach [[Eric Mangini]], faced with the possibility of missing a 40-yard field goal if he allowed an uncertain Mike Nugent to kick the ball, opted for Favre to continue on 4th down and 13 yards. Favre, under pressure, threw up a high ball and rookie [[Chansi Stuckey]] jumped up for the catch in the end zone, giving the Jets a 13â7 lead. Rather than put Nugent out to the field for a PAT, Mangini opted to go for two points, but the option failed. 

In the 3rd quarter, Favre brought the Jets back to the [[Glossary_of_American_football#R|red zone]], moving them to the 6 yard line. From there, Favre handed off the ball to [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]], who ran in for the touchdown. Along with an extra point from Mike Nugent, the Jets now had a 20â7 lead. Due to miscommunication, Chad Pennington was forced to use two time-outs early in the 4th quarter. Late in the 4th quarter, Pennington moved Miami down the field, including connecting on a 14 yard pass from 4th-and-7 at midfield. Pennington completed an 11 yard touchdown pass to [[David Martin (American football)|David Martin]] with 3:27 remaining, cutting the Jets' lead to 6 points. The Jets, who ran the clock down to the two-minute warning, went three-and-out on their drive, giving the ball back to Miami at their 34-yard line with 1:53 remaining. Pennington moved the team down the field, getting to the 18-yard line with 18 seconds on the clock. On 3rd-and-10 from the 18-yard line, Pennington attempted a throw to [[Ted Ginn, Jr.]] in the back of the end zone, but it was intercepted by [[Darrelle Revis]], sealing the six-point win for the Jets.

With the win, the Jets began their 2008 season at 1â0.

Brett Favre, in his Jets debut, completed 15 of 22 passes for 194 yards and 2 touchdowns (with a passer rating of 125.9).

====Game summary====
Coming off their divisional road win over the Dolphins, the Jets played their Week 2 home opener against their AFC East foe, the [[New England Patriots]].  The Jets had the first opportunity to score in the first quarter, but a 31-yard field goal attempt by new kicker [[Jay Feely]] was wide right. New York then trailed as Patroits kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] got a 21-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Jets continued to trail as Gostkowski kicked a 37-yard field goal.  [[Brett Favre]] got the Jets down to the 3 yard line, but after three running plays resulting in 0 net yardage, the Jets settled for a 21-yard field goal to get on the board.  

In the third quarter, New England capitalized on an interception by [[Brandon Meriweather]] off a Brett Favre pass. The Patriots increased its lead 6 plays later as RB [[Sammy Morris]] got a 1-yard TD run and Gostkowski nailed a 28-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets tried to rally as QB Brett Favre completed a 2-yard TD pass to WR [[Chansi Stuckey]].  However, the Patriots pulled away with Gostkowski's 27-yard field goal.

With the loss, New York fell to 1â1.

====Game summary====
Hoping to rebound from a tough MNF road loss to the Chargers, the Jets went home, donned their New York Titans throwbacks, and played a Week 4 interconference duel with the [[Arizona Cardinals]].  After a scoreless first quarter, New York would begin their explosive second quarter.  It began with QB [[Brett Favre]] completing a 12-yard TD pass to WR [[Laveranues Coles]].  It continued with CB [[Darrelle Revis]] returning an interception 32 yards for a touchdown.  Afterwards, New York kept its domination going with Favre completing a 34-yard TD pass to Coles, kicker [[Jay Feely]] getting a 20-yard field goal, Favre and Coles hooking up with each other for a third time on a 2-yard TD pass, and Feely kicking a 30-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Cardinals started to rally as RB [[Edgerrin James]] got a 4-yard and a 2-yard TD run, while RB [[Tim Hightower]] got a 1-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets answered with Favre completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR [[Jerricho Cotchery]].  Arizona replied with QB [[Kurt Warner]] completing an 8-yard TD pass to WR [[Anquan Boldin]], yet New York continued its victory march as Favre completed a 40-yard TD pass to Cotchery.  The Cardinals tried to come back as Warner completing a 14-yard TD pass to WR [[Jerheme Urban]], yet the Jets were able to close out the game as Favre threw his career-best sixth touchdown pass to rookie TE [[Dustin Keller]] from 24 yards out. In the final minute, Anquan Boldin suffered fractured [[paranasal sinuses]] as a result of a helmet-to-helmet collision. After witnessing the injury, [[Kurt Warner]] considered retirement, but remained to lead the Cardinals to [[Super Bowl XLIII]]. 
 

With the amazing win, New York went into the bye week at 2â2.

The Jets' 34-second quarter points became a franchise record for the most points in any given quarter.  The defense was also impressive with 5 sacks and 7 turnovers.  Also, heading into the game, Favre was listed as questionable, due to an injury from MNF.  He improved to 6â1 in career games where he's listed an questionable.

Coming off their home win over the Bengals, the Jets flew to [[Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum]] for a Week 7 duel with the [[Oakland Raiders]], [[Brett Favre]]'s first trip to the stadium since a 2003 Monday night game played in the aftermath of his father's death.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as kicker [[Jay Feely]] got a 40-yard field goal.  The Raiders responded with kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] getting a 29-yard field goal.  After a scoreless second quarter, Oakland took the lead as QB [[JaMarcus Russell]] completed an 8-yard TD pass to WR [[Javon Walker]].  In the fourth quarter, the Jets answered with RB [[Leon Washington]] getting an 11-yard TD run.  The Raiders regained their lead as Janikowski got a 37-yard field goal. Favre orchestrated a remarkable{{Says who|date=July 2010}} final drive, culminating in a Feely 52-yard field goal with just 3 seconds left that sent the game into overtime. The Jets nearly won in regulation, but [[Jerricho Cotchery]] was tripped up by the last Oakland defender, preventing what would have been a game-winning touchdown. Oakland prevailed in overtime, as Janikowski nailed the game-ending 57-yard field goal.

With the loss, the Jets fell to 3â3.

Coming off their dominating home win over the Rams, the Jets flew to [[Gillette Stadium]] for a Week 11 AFC East rematch with the [[New England Patriots]] on Thursday Night Football.  In the first quarter, New York took flight as QB [[Brett Favre]] completed a 7-yard TD pass to RB [[Leon Washington]].

In the second quarter, New England would answer with Gostkowski making a 31-yard field goal, yet New York immediately replied as Washington returned the kickoff 92 yards for a touchdown.

The Patriots would get back into the game by closing out the half with a  QB [[Matt Cassel]] 19-yard TD pass to WR [[Jabar Gaffney]].

In the third quarter, New England hacked away at New York's lead as Cassel completed a 10-yard TD pass to TE [[Benjamin Watson]] (along with a 2-point conversion pass to Gaffney) on the final play of the 3rd quarter.

Hoping to snap a two-game losing streak, the Jets went home for a Week 15 AFC East rematch with the [[Buffalo Bills]].  Early in the first quarter, New York soared off to an early lead as running back [[Thomas Jones (American football)|Thomas Jones]] got a 2-yard touchdown run.  The Bills would answer with a 34-yard field goal from kicker [[Rian Lindell]], yet the Jets answered with quarterback [[Brett Favre]] completing an 11-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jerricho Cotchery]].  Buffalo would take the lead in the second quarter as quarterback [[J. P. Losman|J.P. Losman]] got an 8-yard touchdown run and completed a 2-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Steve Johnson (American football)|Steve Johnson]], but New York would get the halftime lead as running back [[Leon Washington]] got a 47-yard touchdown run.

In the third quarter, the Bills got within one as Lindell got a 48-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Jets added onto their lead as kicker [[Jay Feely]] nailed a 31-yard field goal.  Buffalo got the lead again as running back [[Fred Jackson (American football)|Fred Jackson]] dragged defenders for an 11-yard touchdown run. After a Jets punt, Buffalo took over with just over two minutes remaining. Rather than try to run out the clock and burn the Jets' timeouts, Losman dropped back for a pass on third down. Under pressure from safety [[Abram Elam]], Losman let go of the ball, allowing defensive end [[Shaun Ellis]] to return that fumble 11 yards for the game-winning touchdown. 

With the win, the Jets improved to 9â5, needing wins in their last 2 games to clinch the AFC East.
