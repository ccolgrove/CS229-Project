The '''Kermode bear''' (''Ursus americanus kermodei'', pron. kerr-MO-''dee''), also known as a &quot;'''spirit bear'''&quot; (particularly to the Native tribes of [[Alaska]]), is a subspecies of the [[American Black Bear]] living in the central and north coast of [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref name=Gov&gt;{{Cite web |title=Spirit Bear Facts |url=http://www.corporate.gov.bc.ca/bcspiritbear/more_about_spirit_bear.htm |publisher=Province of British Columbia |accessdate=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is noted for about 1/10 of their population having white or cream-coloured coats. This colour morph is due to a [[Dominance (genetics)#recessive trait|recessive allele]] common in the population. They are not [[albinism|albino]]s&lt;ref name=Gov/&gt; and not any more related to [[polar bear]]s or the &quot;blonde&quot; [[brown bear]]s of Alaska's &quot;[[ABC Islands (Alaska)|ABC Islands]]&quot; than other members of their species.

[[National Geographic]] estimates the spirit bear population at 400-1000 individuals, saying that &quot;the spirit bear may owe its survival to the protective traditions of the First Nations, who never hunted the animals or spoke of them to fur trappers&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Description==
Because of their ghost-like appearance, &quot;spirit bears&quot; hold a prominent place in the mythology of the Canadian [[First Nations]] and [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]] of the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = 2006 | publisher = National Geographic | title = Last Stand of the Great Bear | isbn = 0-7922-4110-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists have found that black bears are not as effective at catching fish as white bears, as the white bears are less visible from the perspective of the fish. While at night the two colors of bears have similar success rates at catching fish, such as [[salmon]], during the day the white bears are 30% more effective.&lt;ref name=invisible&gt;{{cite news|last=Bourton|first=Jody|title=Spirit bears become 'invisible'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8344000/8344367.stm|newspaper=BBC Earth News|date=November 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kermode bear was named after Francis Kermode, former director of the [[Royal B.C. Museum]],&lt;ref name=Gov/&gt; who researched the subspecies and a colleague of [[William Temple Hornaday|William Hornaday]], the zoologist who described it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = The Kermode Bear | author = Steve Warmack | url = http://users.aristotle.net/~swarmack/kermode.html | accessdate = 2008-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwf.org/News-and-Magazines/National-Wildlife/Animals/Archives/2010/Icon-for-an-Endangered-Ecosystem.aspx &quot;Kermode Bear: Icon for an Engangered Ecosystem&quot; from ''National Wildlife'' Magazine 1/15/2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Habitat==
The ''kermodei'' subspecies ranges from [[Princess Royal Island]] to [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia]] on the coast, and inland toward [[Hazelton, British Columbia]].  It is known to the Tsimshian people as ''Moksgm'ol''. In the February 2006 [[Speech from the Throne]] by the Government of British Columbia, the [[Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia|Lieutenant Governor]] announced her government's intention to designate the Kermode or spirit bear as [[British Columbia]]'s official animal. A male Kermode bear can reach 225&amp;nbsp;kg (500&amp;nbsp;lb) or more, females are much smaller with a maximum weight of 135&amp;nbsp;kg (300&amp;nbsp;lb). Straight up it stands 180&amp;nbsp;cm (6&amp;nbsp;ft) tall.

It is estimated that there are fewer than 400 Kermode bears in the coast area that stretches from the Alaska panhandle southwards to the northern tip of Vancouver Island. &lt;ref name=&quot;ThePacific&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = The Pacific Coast of BC is home to the world's only white coloured Black Bears |url=http://www.spiritbear.com/site/wildlife/spirit_bears.html |publisher=Spirit Bear Adventure LTD | accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; And approximately 120 Spirit Bears inhabit the large Princess Royal Island.&lt;ref name=&quot;ThePacific&quot; /&gt;

The bear's habitat is potentially under threat from the [[Enbridge Northern Gateway Pipelines]], whose planned route passes near the [[Great Bear Rainforest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kaufman|first=Rachel|title=Photos: Canadian Rain Forest Edges Oil Pipeline Path|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/photogalleries/101007-energy-enbridge-oil-pipeline-canadian-rain-forest-pictures/|accessdate=27 November 2011|newspaper=National Geographic News|date=October 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Save|first=Planet|title=Canada's 'Spirit Bears' Threatened by Proposed Oil Pipeline|url=http://uk.ibtimes.com/articles/20111104/canada-039039-spirit-bears-039-threatened-proposed-oil-pipeline.htm|accessdate=27 November 2011|newspaper=IBTimes UK - Green Energy|date=November 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Native groups including the [[Gitga'at]] have opposed the pipeline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Associated Press|first=via Zaman|title=Rare Spirit Bear Endangered in Canada|url=http://www.zamanusa.com/us-tr/newsDetail_getNewsById.action;jsessionid=9675BA414FB072795AAED8A7F0772E14.node1?pageNo=7&amp;category=164&amp;dt=2011&amp;newsId=44675&amp;columnistId=0|accessdate=27 November 2011|newspaper=Zaman Amerika|date=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
