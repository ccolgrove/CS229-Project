'''Liverpool Ladies Football Club''' is a semi&amp;ndash;professional [[women's association football|women's football]] club affiliated with [[Liverpool F.C.|Liverpool Football Club]] and playing in the [[FA WSL]]. After being relegated from the [[FA Women's Premier League National Division]] to the [[FA Women's Premier League Northern Division]] for 2009&amp;ndash;10, Liverpool won the league after losing only one game all season.

==History==
The club was founded in 1989 as '''Newton LFC'''. It changed its name to '''Knowsley United WFC''' two years later; becoming founder members of the National Premier Division organised by the [[Women's Football Association|WFA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/women/Historical/wt91.htm|title=1991-1992|publisher=The Owl Football Historian|accessdate=2010-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowsley United reached the final of the [[FA Women's Premier League Cup|Premier League Cup]] in 1993, but were beaten by Arsenal at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-diary-music-for-penalty-arias-1463952.html|title=Football diary: Music for penalty arias|publisher=The Independent|date=28-08-1993|accessdate=08-02-2011 | location=London|author=Henry Winter }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994 the club reached the final of the [[FA Women's Cup]], losing 1&amp;ndash;0 to [[Doncaster Rovers Belles|Doncaster Belles]] at [[Glanford Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/sport/football-belles-bring-class-to-bear-doncaster-dominate-womens-fa-cup-final-1372475.html|title=Football: Belles bring class to bear: Doncaster dominate women's FA Cup final|publisher=The Independent|date=25-04-1994|accessdate=14-10-2010 | location=London | first=Alyson | last=Rudd}}&lt;/ref&gt; That summer the club linked with [[Liverpool F.C.]] and took on its name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/women/Premier/defunct.htm|title=http://www.btinternet.com/~a.drake/women/Basics/changeN.htm|publisher=The Owl Football Historian|accessdate=2011-02-08|author=Andrew Drake}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For most of the 1990s they were [[FA Women's Premier League National Division|National Premier League]] mainstays but a lack of support and investment saw them relegated to the [[FA Women's Premier League Northern Division|Northern Division in 2000]]. In 2004 they won the Northern Division and earned promotion, but did not stay long as they were relegated again at the end of the season, having won only two games.

As in the men's game, their biggest rivalry is with [[Everton L.F.C.]], but their recent spells in the second tier have led them to develop rivalry with counterparts of lower-level male rivals, such as [[Tranmere Rovers L.F.C.|Tranmere Rovers]] and [[Lincoln Ladies F.C.|Lincoln Ladies]]. The Merseyside derby was rekindled in the 2007â08 season, after Liverpool won back promotion as 2006â07 [[FA Women's Premier League National Division|Northern Division]] champions.

Surviving their first season back in the FA Women's Premier League National Division, finishing third bottom, they sacked manager David Bradley at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.liverpoolfc.tv/news/drilldown/N160003080520-1721.htm|title=Ladies sack boss Bradley|publisher=Liverpoolfc.tv|date=2008-05-20|accessdate=2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The club were relegated into the [[FA Women's Premier League National Division|Northern Division]] for 2009â10, but won the league losing just one game all season. Liverpool also won the FA Fair Play Award after playing for the whole season without having a single player booked or sent-off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefa.com/GetIntoFootball/Players/PlayersPages/WomensAndGirls/NewsandFeatures/2010/FAWFA10|title=Key figures honoured at Women's awards|publisher=TheFA.com|accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was one of eight founding teams in the [[FA WSL]] in April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Lincoln Ladies FA Women's Super League bid success |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/women/8579715.stm |date=2010-03-22 |work=BBC |accessdate=2010-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
