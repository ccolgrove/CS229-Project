==History==
[[File:Fairbanks Hall Dome.jpg|thumb|Fairbanks Hall Dome]]
Indiana State University was established by the [[Indiana General Assembly]] on December 20, 1865, as the '''Indiana State Normal School''' in [[Terre Haute]]. As the State Normal School, its core mission was to educate elementary and high school teachers. The school awarded its first baccalaureate degrees in 1908 and the first master's degrees in 1928.  In 1929, the Indiana State Normal School was renamed the '''Indiana State Teachers College''', and in 1961, was renamed '''Indiana State College''' due to an expanding mission.  In 1965, the Indiana General Assembly renamed the college as '''Indiana State University''' in recognition of continued growth.

== Campus ==
[[File:Rankin Hall.jpg|thumb|Rankin Hall]]

The Indiana State University main campus is located on the north side of Terre Hauteâs downtown business district and covers more than {{convert|200|acre|km2}} in the heart of the city. Over 60 brick and limestone buildings and laboratories comprise the main campus. Starting in the 1960s and continuing through the 1990s, ISU lost many of its historic buildings, but efforts  to beautify the campus continue: a section of Seventh Street that runs by the university has been converted into a boulevard with flower beds and antique light posts; the old power plant was razed in 2002 and replaced with a modern facility;&lt;ref&gt;http://library.indstate.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/PowerPlant.htm&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stalker Hall]] reopened in fall 2005 after a complete renovation;&lt;ref&gt;http://library.indstate.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/StalkerHall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Normal Hall, a Neo-Classic building erected in 1909, originally served as the library, and is line for renovation in 2011-12.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.indstate.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/NormalHall.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the university dedicated a more than {{convert|109000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} Student Recreation Center, financed via private funding and student fees. Also in 2009, the College of Education was relocated to the newly renovated, historic University Hall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.indstate.edu/coe/universityhall/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 2012, the College of Business will relocate to the renovated Terre Haute Federal Building, a classic Art Deco building erected in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/business/magazine/spring2008/fedbldg.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Indiana State University field campus is an outdoor teaching, learning, and research area designed to accommodate educational programs and services. The field campus is located on {{convert|93|acre|m2}} approximately {{convert|18|mi|km}} east of Terre Haute near [[Brazil, Indiana]], and includes eight man-made lakes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/rcsm/fieldcampus.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==University traditions==
===Donaghy Day===
Named for Fred Donaghy, graduate of the Normal School (1912) and a professor of life sciences, this tradition was initiated in 1976 as a day set aside for the community to celebrate the season and to work to help beautify the campus and surrounding community; Donaghy Day is now conducted during the first week of the fall semester and is used to acquaint new students with the university's commitment to community engagement.&lt;ref name=ISU&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/whyisu/history_trad.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homecoming===
The term Homecoming was first used in print announcements for the Alumni-Varsity Basketball Game on December 9, 1916. By 1919, this event became known as Blue and White Day and featured dances and entertainment for alumni of the Normal School. In 1921 the events were organized around a football game scheduled earlier in the autumn. A bonfire and pep rally were added to the festivities in 1922; the Blue-and-White Parade in 1923; and in 1937, Bette Whitmore (Kappa Kappa) was elected ISUÂ¹s first Homecoming Queen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU&quot; /&gt;

===Founders Day===
Conducted in January or February of each year, this event commemorates the opening of the institution in 1870 when 23 students presented themselves to a faculty of three on the first day of classes at the Indiana State Normal School.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU&quot; /&gt;

===Mascots===
The school has had two mascots.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU&quot; /&gt;  Early on in the school's history, the athletes were referred to as the &quot;Fighting Teachers&quot;, until the students chose the name &quot;Sycamores&quot;, from the abundance of Sycamore trees in Indiana and especially in the [[Wabash River]] Valley; though it is believed that the students voted on 'Sycamores' on a lark, never thinking it would win.  During the 1950s and 60s, the sycamore tree itself was used as Indiana State's mascot. However, as a tree does not lend itself well to an athletic mascot, especially considering Indiana State's in-state rivalries with the Ball State Cardinals and Butler Bulldogs, the university created an Indian mascot named Chief Quabachi, and his Princess, in 1969.  This change paid homage to the fact that ISU was the &quot;State&quot; university of a state named after Indians (prior to statehood Indiana was primarily inhabited by Indians).  However, the university stopped using Chief Quabachi as a mascot in 1989.  For six years, Indiana State did not have a mascot, until 1995, a blue-and-white &quot;furry woodland creature&quot; named &quot;Sycamore Sam&quot; was developed to replace Chief Quabachi and continues to serve as Indiana State's mascot.

===Tandem===
[[File:Tandem race.jpg|thumb|Tandem race]]
This student-organized race was first run as part of Spring Week activities in 1970. Teams are coed mixed pairs, which compete on tandem bicycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU&quot; /&gt;

===Trike===
The '''Indiana State Tricycle Derby''' was first run in 1963 as a 10-lap race around the sidewalks of the Quadrangle on children's tricycles.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU&quot; /&gt; The races featured a men's and women's division (the Powder Puff Derby). The races now feature men's and women's teams racing on specially built tricycles at the new Recreation East complex at Ninth and Sycamore streets.  In October 2005, the Michael Simmons Student Activity Center opened at Rec East, featuring commemorative displays chronicling the history and the participants of trike and tandem, containing bleacher seating, an all-purpose room, restrooms, an observation deck, and storage.

===The Walk===
The unofficial tradition during homecoming is known as &quot;The Walk.&quot; A large number of students, typically reaching in the thousands, make the two mile (3&amp;nbsp;km) walk east on Wabash Avenue towards the Football Stadium stopping and having a drink at each bar along the way. In 2010, the university launched âSoberRideâ and âDesignated Walkerâ programs for homecoming.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=2417&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Walk can be traced back to the early 1980s when students walked from Saturday night football games back to campus, stopping for a beer at every establishment that served beer, including the Pizza Hut, on Wabash.

==Songs==
===Fight Song===
[[File:ISU marching band.jpg|thumb|Marching Sycamores]]
''March On (You Fighting Sycamores)'', the universityâs fight song, was authored and arranged by Joseph A. Gramelspacher, an ISU professor of music, as a pep song. It was first performed at a homecoming-eve pep rally on October 20, 1939.

Indiana State&lt;BR&gt;
&quot;March On! (You Fighting Sycamores)&quot;
:March on! March on, you fighting Sycamores, Sycamores!
:March on, you Statesmen tried and true!
:March on! March on to glorious victory
:Raise that flag of royal blue!
:March on! March on, you fighting Sycamores, Sycamores!
:Shout out that vict'ry song!
:Onward, ever onward to our goal!
:As we march on and on!
:''Go Big Blue! Fight Big Blue!''
:''GO! STATE! WIN!''

===Alma Mater===
Charles M. Curry, Professor of English and Literature authored ''The Alma Mater''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ISU&quot; /&gt; It was originally entitled, &quot;Indianaâs Normal&quot; and first printed in a June 1912 issue of the ''Normal Advance''.  Dr. Curry used the music of [[Annie Lisle]] for ''The Alma Mater''.

==Athletics==
{{Main|Indiana State Sycamores}}

[[Image:IndianaStateSycamores.png|thumb|right|Athletic Logo]]

The school's athletic teams are known as the ''[[Sycamores]]''. They participate in the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[Missouri Valley Conference]] and [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Football Championship Subdivision|FCS]] [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]].

Athletically, it is best known as the alma mater of basketball legend [[Larry Bird]]; World Champion gymnast [[Kurt Thomas (gymnast)|Kurt Thomas]]; and Olympic, World and Pan-American Champion free-style wrestler, [[Bruce Baumgartner]].  The legendary basketball coach [[John Wooden]] coached the Sycamores before accepting the Head Coaching position at UCLA.  The Men's Basketball team won the 1950 NAIB National Champions and were National Runner-Up in 1946 and 1948.  They were also the NCAA College Division (Div II) National Runner-Up in 1968 and the Division I National Runner-Up in 1979.  The 1950 team comprised the core of the 1951 Pan-American Gold Medal Team. In 1971, Coach Grete Treiber led the ISU Women's gymnastics team to a National Runner-up finish at the [[AIAW]] National Championships.  Kurt Thomas led the Men's Gymnastics Team to the 1977 NCAA National Championship.  Indiana State University Chess Captain, Taylor Pinnick, has led the Sycamores to 9 consecutive wins in the Missouri Valley Conference.

===Facilities===
[[Hulman Center]], originally named [[Hulman Center|Hulman Civic-University Center]], is a multi-use arena that opened in December 1973.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.indstate.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/HulmanCenter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It seats 10,200 people for basketball and is home to the Indiana State University Sycamores men's and women's basketball teams of the [[Missouri Valley Conference]]. It has hosted multiple concerts and the [[Missouri Valley Conference]] men's basketball tournament title game in 1979, the year legendary [[Larry Bird]] helped the undefeated [[Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball|Sycamores]] reach the championship game of the [[NCAA]] tournament.

The baseball field is located within a mile of the main campus along the scenic Wabash River. Bob Warn Field at Sycamore Stadium is home to the [[Terre Haute Rex]] team.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indstate.edu/news/news.php?newsid=2064&lt;/ref&gt; Memorial Stadium, the home field for Indiana State's NCAA Football Championship Subdivision football team of the [[Missouri Valley Football Conference]], and the women's soccer team is located on Wabash Avenue, two miles (3&amp;nbsp;km) east of the main campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.indstate.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/MemorialStadium.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Walter E. Marks Field for track and field and Ferne Price Field for softball are among the many athletic facilities located on campus.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.indstate.edu/archives/exhibits/architecture/MarksField.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

Indiana State University has hosted seven (2002, 2004â2009) NCAA Division I cross country championships at the spectacular [[LaVern Gibson Championship Cross Country Course]].  Indiana State will host the championships in 2010 and again in 2013.  

The school also hosted the 10th NCAA Wrestling Championships in 1937; remarkable considering the school had yet to establish a wrestling program.  The University also hosted the 1975 NCAA Gymnastics National Championships.
