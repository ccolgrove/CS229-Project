==History==
[[Image:JohnBuchtel.jpg|thumb|175px|left|[[John R. Buchtel]], in front of Buchtel Hall]]

===Buchtel College===
In 1867, at the annual Convention of the [[Universalist Church of America|Universalist Church]] of the state of Ohio, the Committee on Education expressed an interest in founding a college compatible with Universalist religious principles.  It was announced that the location would be given to those who could find an appropriate location and also supply $60,000 for the college.  [[John R. Buchtel]], a prominent Akron businessman and Universalist, promptly contributed $25,000 to the endowment fund and $6,000 to the building fund.  This led other Akronites to donate, setting the goal and securing Akron as the location for Buchtel College, named after its greatest supporter.  John R. Buchtel would continue to be the college's most significant contributor, giving $500,000 over his lifetime, approximately equivalent to $9 million today.  When the university opened for business in 1872 it was a single building campus, housed in what is now known as &quot;Old Buchtel.&quot; [[George W. Crouse|George Washington Crouse]] donated $10,000 of the $20,000 needed to build a new gymnasium, completed in 1888.  It was named Crouse Gymnasium in his honor, and was known as &quot;the finest gym west of the Alleghenies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohio.com/lifestyle/40059517.html Old Crouse gym served Akron campus] Ohio.com Retrieved September 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy struck the small college on December 20, 1899, when Old Buchtel burned to the ground.  Insurance only covered $65,000 of the estimated $100,000 in loss.  While new campus buildings were being constructed, the Crouse Gymnasium was divided into seven classrooms and served as the college until a new Buchtel Hall was opened in 1901. The new Buchtel Hall, which itself was gutted by fire in 1971, survives to this day but still has some blackening on the exterior.

===20th century===
In 1907, the college shed its Universalist affiliation and became a non-denominational institution, in order to be able to receive funds from the Carnegie Foundation, which would not give funds to religiously affiliated schools.  In 1913, Buchtel College trustees transferred the institution and its assets to the city of [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], and Buchtel College became the Municipal University of Akron.  At this time, the enrollment was 198 students.  Tax money levied for the school and Akron's growing population led to strong growth for the university.  Over the next several decades the university continued add new buildings to accommodate its growing student population, acquiring more land through purchases and donations.  In 1963, Ohio Governor [[Jim Rhodes]] approved the university as a state-assisted institution.  Enrollment in 1964 was 10,000 students. In 1967, it fully became a state university, giving it its current name of The University of Akron.

===Recent expansion===
[[Image:Uakron student union.jpg|right|thumb|200px| University of Akron's Student union at night]]
A $300 million [[construction]] program was completed in the fall of 2004. Called &quot;A New Landscape for Learning,&quot; the program included the construction of nine new buildings, the renovations or updating of 14 other buildings and structures, and numerous capital improvement projects. The New Landscape for Learning included a new College of Arts &amp; Sciences Building, Honors Residence Hall and classroom complex, a new Student Recreation and Wellness Center, and a new Student Union. Multiple new parking decks were constructed to address high demand for parking (placed on the outskirts of campus in accordance with the university's goal to be less of a commuter school), and several public streets were closed to consolidate the campus, provide a more friendly environment for pedestrians and to add 30 acres (120,000 mÂ²) of new greenspace.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uakron.edu/nll/ New Landscape for Learning&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The University opened on a satellite campus in neighboring [[Medina County, Ohio|Medina County]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mcuc.uakron.edu/dynamic/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and is shopping around ideas for workforce centers in the suburbs.

UA opened its on-campus [[InfoCision Stadium-Summa Field]] on Sept. 12, 2009, before a sellout crowd. The new football stadium replaced the Rubber Bowl, which was located 3 miles from campus and had been built in 1940.

The University purchased the [[Quaker Square|Quaker Square Crowne Plaza Hotel]] and shopping complex in downtown Akron, using half of the rooms as residence space and the other as a working hotel. The University did a land-swap with the city of Akron so that the city may find a new hotel for the Central Business District.

The University of Akron campus is made up of 82 buildings on {{convert|222|acre|km2}} near downtown Akron with a total property value of $1.84 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;dotquickfacts&quot;&gt;[http://www.uakron.edu/about_ua/quick_facts.dot Quick Facts: &quot;Brief History of the University&quot;] Retrieved September 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uakron.edu/ir/QuickFacts.php &quot;Quick Facts&quot; - uakron.edu] Retrieved September 22, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnership==
===Polymers===
The tire and rubber industry and the University of Akron share an intimate history. Historically, many of the world's leading corporations, such as [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]], [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]], and [[Goodrich Corporation|Goodrich]], were headquartered in Akron. In 1909, the worldâs first courses in rubber chemistry were offered at the University.  The University is also credited with having the worldâs first College of Polymer Science and Polymer Engineering, which was founded in 1988. The University of Akron's newest addition, the National Polymer Innovation Center, was unveiled at a groundbreaking ceremony on September 14, 2009. The {{convert|42750|sqft|m2|adj=on}} center, scheduled for June 2010 completion, will house 10 laboratories equipped with state-of-the-art research instruments and a multipurpose-processing high-bay area designed for the installation of prototype manufacturing apparatus. The $13.2 million building is fully funded with state dollars through the Ohio Third Frontier initiative.

&lt;!---When was the song written? Possible copyvio---&gt;
The Alma Mater of The University of Akron is a tribute to the university's past and the rise of the university from the fires that twice devastated Buchtel College.

Close beside Cuyahogaâs waters, Stream of amber hue,&lt;br&gt;
Oâer old Buchtel Summitâs glory, Waves the gold and blue.&lt;br&gt;
Hail we Akron! Sound her praises, Speed them on the gale,&lt;br&gt;
Ever stand our Alma Mater, Akron hail, all hail!

==Fight song==
&lt;!---When was the song written? Possible copyvio---&gt;
The Fight Song for the University is &quot;Akron Blue and Gold&quot;.  The lyrics for the song are:

(chorus)&lt;br&gt;
We cheer the Akron Blue and Gold,&lt;br&gt;
We cheer as the colors unfold.&lt;br&gt;
We pledge anew, we're all for you,&lt;br&gt;
As the team goes crashing through,&lt;br&gt;
Fight! Fight!&lt;br&gt;
We cheer the Akron warriors bold,&lt;br&gt;
For a fight that's a sight to behold,&lt;br&gt;
So we stand up, cheer and shout,&lt;br&gt;
For the Akron Blue and Gold.

(bridge)&lt;br&gt;
Zzzip! Zip go the Zippers!&lt;br&gt;
Zzzip! Zip go the Zippers!&lt;br&gt;
Akron true,&lt;br&gt;
Gold and Blue,&lt;br&gt;
All for you, and the Zippers too!&lt;br&gt;
(to chorus)
