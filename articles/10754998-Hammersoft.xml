'''Amanda Evora''' (born November 17, 1984) is an [[United States|American]] [[pair skater]]. She competes with [[Mark Ladwig]]. They are two-time (2010, 2011) [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. silver medalists]] and two-time (2007, 2009) U.S. pewter medalists.

==Personal life==
Evora was born in [[New York]]. Her family moved to [[Houston]] in 1995. Before that, they had lived in [[Bahrain]], [[Dallas, Texas]], and [[Virginia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;houstonchronicle&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = DAVID | last= BARRON  | url = http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/oly/6861469.html | title = Sugar Land skater took long journey to games | publisher = [[Houston Chronicle]] | date = February 11, 2010 | accessdate = February  11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is [[Filipino-American]].&lt;ref name=&quot;houstonchronicle&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://insidesports.ph/features/filipino-american-in-2010-winter-olympics | title = FILIPINO-AMERICAN IN 2010 WINTER OLYMPICS | publisher = Inside Sports | date = 21 January 2010 | accessdate = 28 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Evora discovered her sister's ice skates and, since they fit, decided to give them a try. When she was 18, she left her family's home in Texas to further her skating career. Now, she is studying business administration at the [[University of South Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcolympics.com/athletes/athlete=11776/bio/index.html accessed May 2, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Evora previously skated with Michael Adler. They won the bronze medal at the 2002 Eastern Sectional Championships on the junior level&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200102/east/jrpairs-free.htm | title =  2002 Eastern Sectional Championships Junior Pairs Final Standings | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and placed 8th on the junior level at the [[2002 United States Figure Skating Championships]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_related_details.asp?ri=/content/events/200102/so-atl/jrpairs.htm | title = 2002 South Atlantic Regional Championships Junior Pairs Final Standings | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Evora and Ladwig teamed up in 2002. The 2005/2006 season was their first on the [[Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]]. They placed 9th at the [[2005 Skate America]] and 8th at the [[2005 Skate Canada International]]. They were the bronze medalists at the 2007 Nebelhorn Trophy and finished as high as fourth in GP events.

2009â10 was a breakthrough season for Evora and Ladwig. They finished 2nd at the US National Championships, their best finish yet at the event, which led to their selection for the US Olympic team. At the [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics|2010 Vancouver Olympics]], they beat their previous personal best by a sizable margin, and finished tenth, making them the top US pair at the Olympics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/02/16/1482034/chinese-pair-in-front.html Figure skating gold goes to Chinese pair] accessed April 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; They later competed at [[2010 World Figure Skating Championships|2010 Worlds]] for the first time in their career, and finished in ninth place. 

Evora served on the 2008â09 Athletes Advisory Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/AthletesAdvisoryTree.pdf | title = U.S. Figure Skating Athletes Advisory Committee 2008â09 Permanent Committee |format= PDF | publisher = [[U.S. Figure Skating]] | accessdate = November 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2010â2011 season, the pair was assigned to compete at [[2010 Cup of China]] where they finished fifth (151.66 pts) and later earned their first Grand Prix medal, a bronze, at [[2010 Cup of Russia]], with a season's best of 110.27 and total score of 162.85.

Evora and Ladwig are noted for their longevity as a partnership, which is rare in U.S. pair skating.&lt;ref name=ic051811&gt;{{cite news | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110518&amp;content_id=19225270&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = Evora, Ladwig commit to skate next season | first = Amy | last = Rosewater |date = May 18, 2011 | publisher = IceNetwork | accessdate = June 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
