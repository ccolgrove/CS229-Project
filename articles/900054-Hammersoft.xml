'''Shere Hite''' (born November 2, 1942) is an [[United States|American]]-born [[Germany|German]]&lt;ref name=USATODAY&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2006-05-15-hite-report_x.htm &quot;Decades later, Hite reports back&quot;], ''USA Today'', May 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; [[sex education|sex educator]] and [[feminism|feminist]]. Her [[sexology|sexological]] work has focused primarily on [[Human female sexuality|female sexuality]]. Hite builds upon biological studies of sex by [[Masters and Johnson]] and by [[Alfred Kinsey]]. She also references theoretical, political and psychological works associated with the [[feminist movement]] of the 1970s, such as [[Anne Koedt]]'s ''The Myth of the Vaginal Orgasm''. She renounced her United States citizenship in 1995 to become German.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/200311170015 Why I became a German: so vicious were the attacks on the feminist Shere Hite that she decided to give up her American citizenship], The New Statesman, November 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life, education, and career==
Hite was born Shirley Diana Gregory in [[Saint Joseph, Missouri]] to Paul and Shirley Hurt Gregory. She later took the surname of her stepfather, Raymond Hite.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.novelguide.com/a/discover/aww_02/aww_02_00560.html Novelguide]&lt;/ref&gt; She graduated from [[Seabreeze High School]] in [[Daytona Beach, Florida]]. She received a [[masters degree]] in history from the [[University of Florida]] in 1967. She then moved to [[New York City]] and enrolled at [[Columbia University]] to work toward her Ph.D. in [[social history]]. Hite says that the reason for her not completing this degree was the conservative nature of Columbia at that time.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} In the 1970s, she did part of her research while at the [[National Organization for Women]], and also appeared nude in both ''[[Playboy]]'' and ''[[Oui magazine]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hite-research.com/ Hite's official website]&lt;/ref&gt; Hite teaches at [[Nihon University]] ([[Tokyo, Japan]]), [[Chongqing University]] in [[China]], and [[Maimonides University]], North [[Miami Beach, Florida]], USA.&lt;ref name=USATODAY/&gt;

==Research focus==
{{ref improve section|section|date=June 2011}}

Hite has focused on understanding how individuals regard sexual experience and the meaning it holds for them. Hite has criticised Masters and Johnson's work for uncritically incorporating cultural attitudes on sexual behaviour into their research. For example, Hite's work showed that 70% of women do not have [[orgasm]]s through in-out, thrusting [[Sexual intercourse|intercourse]] but are able to achieve orgasm easily by [[masturbation]] or other direct [[clitoris|clitoral]] stimulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shere Hite&quot;&gt;Shere Hite: &quot;I was making the point that clitoral stimulation wasn't happening during coitus. That's why women 'have difficulty having orgasms' - they don't have difficulty when they stimulate themselves.&lt;br&gt;Tracey Cox: &quot;It's disappointing that one of Hite's main messages - that 70 per cent of women don't have orgasms through penetration - is not completely accepted today. Plenty of women don't feel comfortable admitting it, even to themselves, for fear their partners will love them less. But women are far more experimental now.&quot; {{cite web|author=Shere Hite|title=Shere Hite: On female sexuality in the 21st century|publisher=''[[The Independent]]''|date=April 30, 2006|accessdate=April 10, 2011|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/shere-hite-on-female-sexuality-in-the-21st-century-475981.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 30% of the women in her study reported ever experiencing orgasm during thrusting intercourse. She has criticised Masters and Johnson's argument that enough clitoral stimulation to achieve orgasm should be provided by thrusting during intercourse, and the inference that the failure of this is a sign of female &quot;[[sexual dysfunction]].&quot; Whilst not denying that both Kinsey and Masters and Johnson have been a crucial step in sex research, she believes that we must understand the cultural and personal construction of sexual experience to make the research relevant to sexual behaviour outside the laboratory.  She offered the criticism that limiting test subjects to &quot;normal&quot; women who report orgasming during coitus was basing research on the faulty assumption that having an orgasm during coitus was typical, something that her own research strongly refuted.

==Methodology==
Hite uses an individualistic research method. Thousands of responses from anonymous questionnaires were used as a framework to develop a discourse on human responses to gender and sexuality. Her conclusions derived from these questionnaire data have met with methodological criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Janet|last=Jones|title=Understanding Psychological Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that her data are not [[random sample|probability samples]] raises concerns about whether the sample data can be generalised to relevant populations. As is common with surveys concerning sensitive subjects, such as sexual behaviour, the proportion of nonresponse is typically large. Thus the conclusions derived from the data may not represent the views of the population under study because of [[biased sample|bias]] due to nonresponse.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/users/stark/SticiGui/Text/ch16.htm Berkeley.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; Hite supporters defend her methodology by saying that it is more likely to get to the truth of women's sexuality than studying women engaged in prostitution as if they were exemplary of women in general, or to study in laboratory conditions women who claim to orgasm during coitus.

Hite has been praised for her theoretical fruitfulness in sociological research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alli.fi/nyri/young/1998-1/reviewEkerwald1-98.htm Alli.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; The suggestion of [[bias]] in some of Hite's studies is frequently used as a [[talking point]] in university courses where [[Sampling (statistics)|sampling methods]] are discussed, along with the ''[[Literary Digest]]'' poll of 1936.

One discussion of sampling bias is by Philip Zimbardo,&lt;ref&gt;Discovering Psychology with Philip Zimbardo (Episode 2: Understanding Research)&lt;/ref&gt; who explained that women in Hite's study were given a survey about marriage satisfaction, where 98% reported dissatisfaction, and 75% reported having had extra-marital affairs, but where only 4% of women given the survey responded. ABC News and The Washington Post later gave surveys on marriage satisfaction to women in random samples; 93% reported being satisfied with their relationships, and only 7% reported having had affairs. Zimbardo argued that the women who had dissatisfaction may have been more motivated to respond than women who were satisfied and that her research may just have been âscience-coded journalism.â On the other hand, [[social science]] [[Social_science#Theory_and_methods|methodological]] differences when questions are on publicly consequential subjects, e.g., immediacy vs. time for thoughtfulness when answering, can result in differences in honesty and promises of confidentiality are not all equally believed by prospective respondents, affecting respondents' openness and honesty. Some or all of her published surveys&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Hite Report on Female Sexuality'' (1976)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E.g., ''The Hite Report on the Family: Growing Up Under Patriarchy'' (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; depended on wide multi-channel questionnaire distribution, opportunity for many long answers on a respondent's own schedule, enforced respondent anonymity, and response by mail rather than polling by telephone.

==Personal life==
Hite has no children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/families/article6843074.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1151003209000 Why are older mothers still taboo?]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1985, she has been married to German concert pianist Friedrich Horicke, who is 19 years her junior.&lt;ref name=&quot;NZ_Herald_138312&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=138312 |title=The real Shere Hite report |author=Hewitson, Michele |date=May 27, 2000 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=November 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
