The [[source code]] for SQLite is in the [[public domain]]&lt;ref name=&quot;license&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqlite.org/ |title=The source code for SQLite is in the public domain |publisher=Sqlite.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implements most of the [[SQL]] standard. In contrast to other database management systems, SQLite is not a separate process that is accessed from the client application, but an integral part of it.

SQLite uses a dynamically and weakly typed SQL syntax that does not guarantee the [[integrity constraints|domain integrity]]. SQLite read operations can be multitasked. Writes can be done only one-at-a-time. It is a popular choice for local/client storage on [[web browser]]s. It has many bindings to programming languages. It is arguably the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used today by several widespread browsers, operating systems, embedded systems among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html |title=Most Widely Deployed SQL Database Estimates |publisher=Sqlite.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design==

Unlike [[clientâserver]] database management systems, the SQLite engine has no standalone [[process (computing)|process]]es with which the application program communicates. Instead, the SQLite [[library (computing)|library]] is [[Linker (computing)|linked in]] and thus becomes an integral part of the application program. The library can also be called dynamically. The application program uses SQLite's functionality through simple [[subroutine|function calls]], which reduce [[latency (engineering)|latency]] in database access: function calls within a single process are more efficient than [[inter-process communication]]. SQLite stores the entire database (definitions, tables, indices, and the data itself) as a single cross-platform [[Computer file|file]] on a host machine. It implements this simple design by [[lock (computer science)|locking]] the entire database file during writing.

==History==

[[D. Richard Hipp]] designed SQLite in the spring of 2000 while working for [[General Dynamics]] on contract with the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Owens06&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Owens |first=Michael |title=The Definitive Guide to SQLite |year=2006 |publisher=[[Apress]] |isbn=978-1-59059-673-9 |doi=10.1007/978-1-4302-0172-4_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hipp was designing software used on board [[guided missile destroyer]] ships, which were originally based on [[HP-UX]] with an [[IBM Informix]] database back-end. The design goals of SQLite were to allow the program to be operated without installing a database management system or [[Database administrator|administration]]. In August 2000, version 1.0 of SQLite was released, based on [[gdbm]] (GNU Database Manager). SQLite 2.0 replaced gdbm with a custom [[B-tree]] implementation, adding support for [[Database transaction|transactions]]. SQLite 3.0, partially funded by [[America Online]], added [[Internationalization and localization|internationalization]], [[manifest typing]], and other major improvements.

==Future plans==

In 2011 Richard Hipp announced his plans to add an [[UnQL]] interface to SQLite databases and to develop ''UnQLite'', an embeddable [[document-oriented database]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unql-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infoq.com/news/2011/08/UnQL|title=Interview: Richard Hipp on UnQL, a New Query Language for Document Databases|publisher=InfoQ|date=August 4, 2011|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==

SQLite implements most of the [[SQL-92]] standard for [[SQL]] but it lacks some features. For example it has partial support for [[database trigger|triggers]], and it can't write to [[view (database)|view]]s (however it supports INSTEAD OF triggers that provide this functionality). While it supports complex queries, it still has limited [[Data Definition Language#ALTER statements|ALTER TABLE]] support, as it can't modify or delete columns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqlite.org/omitted.html |date=January 1, 2009 |title=SQL Features That SQLite Does Not Implement |publisher=SQLite |accessdate=October 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQLite uses an unusual [[type system]] for a SQL-compatible DBMS. Instead of assigning a type to a column as in most SQL database systems, types are assigned to individual values; in language terms it is ''dynamically typed''. Moreover, it is ''weakly typed'' in some of the same ways that [[Perl programming language|Perl]] is: one can insert a [[string (computer science)|string]] into an [[integer]] column (although SQLite will try to convert the string to an integer first, if the column's preferred type is integer). This adds flexibility to columns, especially when bound to a dynamically typed scripting language. However, the technique is not portable to other SQL products. A common criticism is that SQLite's type system lacks the data integrity mechanism provided by statically typed columns in other products. The SQLite web site describes a &quot;strict affinity&quot; mode, but this feature has not yet been added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |date=January 26, 2009 |publisher=SQLite |accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it can be implemented with constraints like &lt;code&gt;CHECK(typeof(x)='integer')&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Owens06&quot; /&gt;

Several [[computer process]]es or [[thread (computer science)|threads]] may access the same database concurrently. Several read accesses can be satisfied in parallel. A write access can only be satisfied if no other accesses are currently being serviced. Otherwise, the write access fails with an [[error code]] (or can automatically be retried until a configurable timeout expires). This concurrent access situation would change when dealing with temporary tables. This restriction is relaxed in version 3.7 when [[Write-ahead logging|WAL]] is turned on enabling concurrent reads and writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqlite.org/wal.html| title=Write Ahead Logging in SQLite 3.7 |publisher=SQLite |accessdate=September 3, 2011 |quote=WAL provides more concurrency as readers do not block writers and a writer does not block readers. Reading and writing can proceed concurrently}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A standalone program called &lt;code&gt;sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; is provided that can be used to create a database, define tables within it, insert and change rows, run queries and manage a SQLite database file. This program is a single executable file on the host machine. It also serves as an example for writing applications that use the SQLite library.

SQLite is a popular choice for local/client SQL storage within a web browser and within a [[List of rich internet application frameworks|rich internet application framework]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w3.org/TR/webdatabase |title=Web SQL Database |publisher=[[World Wide Web Consortium]] |date=December 22, 2009 |accessdate=January 26, 2010 |quote=all interested implementors have used the same SQL backend (Sqlite)}}&lt;/ref&gt; most notably the leaders in this area ([[Gears (software)|Google Gears]],&lt;ref name=&quot;GearsDatabaseAPI&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://code.google.com/apis/gears/api_database.html |title= Gears API | work = Database API |publisher=Google |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Adobe AIR]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AdobeAirUsingSQLite&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/flex/articles/sqlite_db_api_in_air.html |title=Using the SQLite database access API in Adobe AIR |author= Coenraets, Christophe |date= January 19, 2010 |publisher=Adobe |accessdate=April 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Firefox]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/Storage | title=DOM Storage | accessdate=2010-02-09 | publisher=Mozilla Developer Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;) embed SQLite.

SQLite full [[Unicode]] support is optional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q18 |title= Case-insensitive matching of Unicode characters does not work | work = SQLite Frequently Asked Questions | publisher=Sqlite.org |date= |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQLite also has [[language binding|bindings]] for a large number of [[programming language]]s, including [[BASIC]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Clipper (programming language)|Clipper]]//[[Harbour (software)|Harbour]], [[Common Lisp]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], [[Curl (programming language)|Curl]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[Borland Delphi|Delphi]], [[Free Pascal]], [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]], [[newLisp]], [[Objective-C]] (on [[Mac OS X]] and [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]]), [[OCaml]], [[Perl]], [[PHP]], [[Pike (programming language)|Pike]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://trac.edgewall.org/wiki/PySqlite PySQLite]: Python bindings for SQLite&lt;/ref&gt; [[REBOL]], [[R (programming language)|R]], [[REALbasic]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rubyforge.org/projects/sqlite-ruby SQLite/Ruby]: Ruby bindings for SQLite&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scheme (programming language)|Scheme]], [[Smalltalk]], [[Tcl]], [[Visual Basic .NET|Visual Basic]], and [[JavaScript]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/v8-juice/wiki/JSPDO JSPDO] JavaScript database access abstraction API&lt;/ref&gt;. There is also a [[Component Object Model|COM]] ([[ActiveX]]) wrapper making SQLite accessible on Windows to scripted languages such as [[JScript]] and [[VBScript]]. This adds database capabilities to [[HTML Application]]s (HTA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=SqliteWrappers |title=sqlite&amp;nbsp;â Sqlite Wrappers |date=February 7, 2009 |publisher=SQLite |accessdate=February 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SQLite has automated [[regression testing]] prior to each release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sqlite.org/testing.html|title=How SQLite Is Tested|publisher=SQLite|accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 2 million tests are run as part of a release's verification. Starting with the August 10, 2009 release of SQLite 3.6.17, SQLite releases have 100% branch test coverage, one of the components of [[code coverage]].

==Development==

SQLite development stores revisions of its source code in [[Fossil (software)|Fossil]], a [[distributed version control system]] that is itself built upon a SQLite database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fossil-scm.org/index.html/doc/tip/www/stats.wiki |title=Fossil: Fossil Performance |publisher=Fossil-scm.org |date=2009-08-23 |accessdate=2009-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption==

* [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] store a variety of configuration data (bookmarks, cookies, contacts etc.) in internally managed SQLite databases, and even offer an add-on to manage SQLite databases.
* [[Skype]] is another widely deployed application that uses SQLite.&lt;ref name=&quot;skype&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mail-archive.com/sqlite-users%40sqlite.org/msg27326.html |title=Skype client using SQLite? |publisher=Mail-archive.com |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Adobe Systems]] uses SQLite as its file format in [[Adobe Photoshop Lightroom]], a standard database in [[Adobe AIR]], and internally within [[Adobe Reader]].&lt;ref name=&quot;adobe&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sqlite.org/famous.html |title=Well-Known Users of SQLite |publisher=Sqlite.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ruby on Rails]]' default database management system is also SQLite.
* [[Xmarks]], the bookmark sharing tool has also reported to use SQLite to manage the bookmarks for each user.&lt;ref name=&quot;xmarks&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://virusremoval.pro/showthread.php?tid=72&amp;pid=368#pid368 |title=Possible virus infection by Xmarks? |publisher=virusremoval.pro |date=2010-06-23 |accessdate=2010-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] Internet suite and browser uses SQLite 3.6.23 for managing WebSQL databases. This is noted in &lt;code&gt;opera:about&lt;/code&gt;, although without the mention of WebSQL (databases can be managed through &lt;code&gt;opera:webdatabases&lt;/code&gt;)
* The [[Service Management Facility]], used for service management within the [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[OpenSolaris]] operating systems, uses SQLite internally.
* Embedding SQLite in web browsers has resulted in adding SQLite to the HTML5 Web Storage standard and after discussion inside the W3C Web Applications Working Group&lt;ref name=&quot;webapps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.nabble.com/Web-Storage---SQL-td22960404.html|title=Web Storage &amp; SQL|publisher=W3C Web Applications Working Group mailing list|date= |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; the WebSimpleDB API proposal was developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;websimpledb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/WebSimpleDB/|title=W3C WebSimpleDB API|publisher=w3.org|date= |accessdate=2011-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to its small size, SQLite is well suited to embedded systems, and is also included in :
* Apple's [[Apple iOS|iOS]] (where it is used for the SMS/MMS, Calendar, Call history and Contacts storage)
* [[Symbian OS]]
* Nokia's [[Maemo]]
* Google's [[Android (operating system)|Android]]
* Google's [[Google Chrome|Chrome browser]]
* RIM's [[BlackBerry]]
* Linux Foundation's [[MeeGo]]
* Palm's [[webOS]]&lt;ref name=&quot;famous&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sqlite.org/famous.html |title=Well-known Users of SQLite |publisher=Sqlite.org |date= |accessdate=2010-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it is also suitable for desktop operating systems; Apple adopted it as an option in [[Mac OS X]]'s [[Core Data]] API from the original implementation in [[Mac OS X 10.4]] onwards, and also for administration of videos and songs on the [[iPhone]].
