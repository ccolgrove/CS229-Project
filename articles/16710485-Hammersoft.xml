{{1934 Big 6 football standings}}
The '''1934 Kansas State Wildcats football team''' represented [[Kansas State University]] in the [[1934 college football season]].  The 1934 team went undefeated in the Big 6 Conference, and won the second of three conference championships in school history.  It would be another 69 years until the Wildcats would win the third, when they won the [[Big 12]] title in 2003.

The Kansas State team was led by future [[College Football Hall of Fame|Hall-of-Fame]] coach Lynn &quot;Pappy&quot; Waldorf, who would depart from the school following his one championship season.  At the conclusion of the season, [[Defensive tackle|tackle]] George Maddox was named a first-team All-American player by several organizations (including the All-America Board), becoming the third player in team history to be so honored.
