'''''Person of the Year''''' (formerly '''Man of the Year''') is an annual issue of the United States [[newsmagazine]] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' that features and profiles a person, couple, group, idea, place, or machine that &quot;for better or for worse, ...has done the most to influence the events of the year.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Person of the Year: 75th Anniversary Celebration | edition=Special Collector's Edition | location=New York | publisher=Time Books | year=2002 | oclc=52817840}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The tradition of selecting a Man of the Year began in 1927, with ''Time'' editors contemplating newsworthy stories possible during a slow news week. The idea was also an attempt to remedy the editorial embarrassment earlier that year for not having aviator [[Charles Lindbergh]] on its cover following his historic [[trans-Atlantic flight]]. By the end of the year, it was decided that a cover story featuring Lindbergh as the Man of the Year would serve both purposes.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' (2002) p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, individual people, classes of people, the [[Personal Computer|computer]], and [[Planet Earth]] have all been selected for the special year-end issue. In 1999, the title was changed to ''Person of the Year''.&lt;ref&gt;First [http://www.time.com/time/coverspoy/ &quot;Person&quot; of the Year] (rather than &quot;Man&quot; of the Year) is [[Jeff Bezos]] of [[amazon.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, the only women to win the renamed recognition as an individual so far were those recognized as ''The Whistleblowers'' (2002) and [[Melinda Gates]] (jointly with [[Bill Gates]] and [[Bono]] in 2005). Before that, four women were granted the title as individuals, adapted as ''Woman of the Year'' â [[Wallis, Duchess of Windsor|Wallis Simpson]] in 1936, [[Soong May-ling]] (Madame Chiang Kai-shek) in 1937, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in 1952, and [[Corazon Aquino]] in 1986. Several classes of people comprise both men and women or women only, namely [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungarian Freedom Fighter]] in 1956, &quot;U.S. Scientists&quot; in 1960, [[Baby boomer|Twenty-Five and Under]] in 1966, [[Middle class|The Middle Americans]] in 1969, &quot;American Women&quot; in 1975, &quot;The American Soldier&quot; in 2003, and [[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]] in 2006.

Since the list began, every serving [[President of the United States]] has been a Person of the Year at least once with the exceptions of [[Calvin Coolidge]], in office at time of the first issue, [[Herbert Hoover]], the next U.S. president, and [[Gerald Ford]]. Most were named Person of the Year either the year they were elected or while they were in office- the only one to be given the title before being elected is [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], who won it in 1944 as Supreme Commander of the Allied Invasion Force, 8 years before his election. He subsequently won the title again in 1959, while in office.

The December 31, 1999 issue of ''Time'' named [[Albert Einstein]] the ''[[Person of the Century]]''. [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and [[Mahatma Gandhi]] were chosen as runners-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Golden | first=Frederic | title=Person of the Century: Albert Einstein | work=Time | url=http://www.time.com/time/time100/poc/magazine/albert_einstein5a.htm | date=3 January 2000 | accessdate=2008â02â13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] is the only person to have received the title 3 times - in 1932, 1934 and 1941.

Despite the magazine's frequent statements to the contrary, the designation is often regarded as an honor, and spoken of as an award or prize, simply based on many previous selections of admirable people.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' (2002) pp. 2, 79.&lt;/ref&gt; However ''Time'' magazine points out those such as [[Adolf Hitler]] in 1938, and [[Joseph Stalin]] in 1939 and again in 1942, and the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] in 1979, have also been granted the title.

As a result of the public backlash it received from the [[United States]] for naming the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] Man of the Year in 1979, ''Time'' has shied away from using figures that are controversial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;''Time'' (2002) p. 79.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'''s Person of the Year 2001âimmediately following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]âwas [[New York City]] mayor [[Rudolph Giuliani]], although the stated rules of selection, the individual or group of individuals who have had the biggest effect on the year's news, made [[Osama bin Laden]] a more likely choice. The issue that declared Giuliani the Person of the Year included an article that mentioned ''Time's'' earlier decision to elect the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] and the 1999 rejection of [[Hitler]] as [[Person of the Century]]. The article seemed to imply that [[Osama bin Laden]] ''was'' a stronger candidate than Giuliani, as [[Adolf Hitler]] was a stronger candidate than [[Albert Einstein]]. The selections were ultimately based on what the magazine describes as who they believed had a stronger influence on history.

Another criticized choice was the 2006 selection of &quot;[[You (Time Person of the Year)|You]]&quot;, representing most if not all people for advancing the [[information age]] by using the [[Internet]] (via e.g. [[blogs]], [[YouTube]], [[MySpace]] and [[Wikipedia]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/personoftheyear/2006/walkup/ | work=Time | title=TIME.com - Person of the Year 2006 - Who Will It Be? | date=2006â11â13 | accessdate=2010â05â25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
