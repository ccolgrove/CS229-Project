'''CorelDRAW''' is a [[vector graphics editor]] developed and marketed by [[Corel|Corel Corporation]] of [[Ottawa]], [[Canada]].  It is also the name of Corel's Graphics Suite. Its latest version, named X5 (actually version 15), was released in February 2010.

== History ==
In 1987, [[Corel]] hired software engineers Michel Bouillon and Pat Beirne to develop a vector-based illustration program to bundle with their desktop publishing systems. That program, CorelDRAW, was initially released in 1989. 
CorelDRAW 1.x and 2.x runs under Windows 2.x and 3.0. CorelDRAW 3.0 came into its own with Microsoft's release of Windows 3.1. The inclusion of [[TrueType]] in Windows 3.1 transformed CorelDRAW into a serious illustration program capable of using system-installed outline fonts without requiring third-party software such as [[Adobe Type Manager]]; paired with a photo editing program (PhotoPaint), a font manager and several other pieces of software, it was also part of the first all-in-one graphics suite.

The first book devoted to CorelDRAW was Mastering CorelDRAW by Chris Dickman, published by Peachpit Press in 1990, with a contribution by Rick Altman. Dickman also founded and published the independent Mastering CorelDRAW Journal publication, and created and ran the first site dedicated to CorelDRAW, CorelNET.com, from 1995 to 1997.

=== Features by version ===

== Features ==
=== Supported platforms ===
CorelDRAW was originally developed for Microsoft Windows 3 and currently runs on [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Vista]], and [[Windows 7]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corel.com/servlet/Satellite/us/en/Product/1206653595281#tabview=tab6 System Requirements&amp;nbsp;â CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The current version, X5, was released on 23 February 2010.

Versions for [[Mac OS]] and [[Mac OS X]] were at one time available, but due to poor sales these were discontinued. The last port for Linux was version 9 (released in 2000, it didn't run natively; instead, it used a modified version of [[Wine (software)|Wine]] to run) and the last version for OS X was version 11 (released in 2001). Also, up until version 5, CorelDRAW was developed for [[Windows 3.1x]], [[Convergent Technologies Operating System|CTOS]] and [[OS/2]].

Problems installing or running older versions of Corel Draw under Windows 7 may be overcome by using Microsoft's &quot;Troubleshoot Compatibility&quot;&amp;nbsp;â right-click on the setup.exe file on the installation disk to select this facility (tested on version 12 with Windows 7, where previous attempts without Microsoft &quot;Troubleshoot Compatibility&quot; failed).

=== Characteristic features ===
Several innovations to vector-based illustration originated with CorelDRAW: a node-edit tool that operates differently on different objects, fit text-to-path, stroke-before-fill, quick fill/stroke
color selection palettes, perspective projections, mesh fills and complex gradient fills.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

CorelDRAW differentiates itself from its competitors in a number of ways: 

The first is its positioning as a graphics suite, rather than just a vector graphics program. A full range of editing tools allow the user to adjust contrast, color balance, change the format from [[RGB]] to [[CMYK]], add special effects such as vignettes and special borders to bitmaps. Bitmaps can also be edited more extensively using [[Corel PhotoPaint]], opening the bitmap directly from CorelDRAW and returning to the program after saving. It also allows a laser to [[Laser Cutting|cut out]] any drawings.

CorelDRAW is capable of handling multiple pages along with multiple master layers.  Multipage documents are easy to create and edit and the Corel print engine allows for booklet and other imposition so even simple printers can be used for producing finished documents. One of the useful features for single and multi-page documents is the ability to create linked text boxes across documents that can be resized and moved while the text itself resets and flows through the boxes.  Useful for creating and editing multi-article newsletters etc. 

Smaller items, like business cards, invitations etc., can be designed to their final page size and imposed to the printer's sheet size for cost-effective printing.  An additional print-merge feature (using a spreadsheet or text merge file) allows full personalization for many things like numbered raffle tickets, individual invitations, membership cards and more.

CorelDRAW's competitors include [[Adobe Illustrator]] and [[Xara Photo &amp; Graphic Designer]]. Although all of these are vector-based illustration programs, the user experience differs greatly between them. While these programs will read their native file types and vice versa, the translation is rarely perfect. CorelDRAW can open [[Adobe PDF]] files: Adobe PageMaker, Microsoft Publisher and Word, and other programs can print documents to PDF using the Adobe PDFWriter printer driver, which CorelDRAW can then open and edit every aspect of the original layout and design. CorelDRAW can also open PowerPoint Presentations and other Microsoft Office formats with little or no problem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recipester.org/s:windows%20powerpoint%5Ethis%20is%20a%5Egraphics%20&amp;%20design recipester.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== CorelDRAW Graphics Suite ==
[[Image:CorelCapture.PNG|thumb|Corel Capture X4]]
Over time, additional components were developed or acquired and bundled with CorelDRAW. The list of bundled packages usually changes somewhat from one release to the next, though there are several mainstays that have remained in the package for many releases now, including PowerTRACE (a bitmap to vector graphic converter), [[Corel Photo-Paint|PHOTO-PAINT]] (a bitmap graphic editor), and CAPTURE (a screen capture utility).

The current version of CorelDRAW Graphics Suite X5 (version 15), contains the following packages:
* '''CorelDRAW:''' Vector graphics editing software
* '''[[Corel PHOTO-PAINT]]:''' Raster image creation and editing software
* '''[[Corel CONNECT]]:''' Content organizer
* '''Corel CAPTURE''': Enables several methods of image-capture
* '''Corel PowerTRACE''': Converts raster images to vector graphics (available inside the CorelDraw program).
* '''[[Bitstream Font Navigator]]'''
* '''SB Profiler'''

CDR file format is a [[proprietary format|proprietary]] [[file format]] developed by Corel Corporation and primarily used for vector graphic drawings. There is no publicly available CDR file format specification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Corel Draw file format |url=http://coreldraw.com/forums/p/2922/10354.aspx |author=Corel Corporation |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fileinfo.com/extension/cdr |title=.CDR File Extension |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other CorelDRAW file formats include CorelDRAW Compressed (CDX), CorelDRAW Template (CDT)&lt;ref name=&quot;x3formats&quot; /&gt; and Corel Presentation Exchange (CMX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://corel.custhelp.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/754156/~/corel%E2%AE-presentation-exchange-%28cmx%29-technical-notes |title=Corel Presentation Exchange (CMX) Technical Notes |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2006 the [[sK1 (program)|sK1]] [[open source]] project team started to [[reverse-engineer]] the CDR format.&lt;ref name=&quot;sk1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&amp;product=sk1 |title=sK1 illustration program - The history of sK1 |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results and the first working snapshot of the CDR importer were presented at the Libre Graphics Meeting 2007 conference taking place in May 2007 in Montreal (Canada).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.libregraphicsmeeting.org/2007/program.html |title=Libre Graphics Meeting 2007 - Friday May 4 |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on the team parsed the structure of other Corel formats with the help of the open source CDR Explorer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&amp;product=cdrexplorer |title=CDR explorer |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, the sK1 project claims to have the best import support for CorelDRAW file formats among open source software programs. The sK1 project developed also the UniConvertor, a command line open source tool which supports conversion from CorelDRAW ver.7-X3,X4 formats (CDR/CDT/CCX/CDRX/CMX) to other formats. UniConvertor is also used in [[Inkscape]] and [[Scribus]] open source projects as an external tool for CorelDraw files importing.&lt;ref name=&quot;inkscape&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/FAQ#Can_I_open.2Fimport_.2A.cdr_.28Corel_Draw_Vector_drawing_file.29_files_in_Inkscape.3F |title=Can I open/import *.cdr (Corel Draw Vector drawing file) files in Inkscape? |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/projects/uniconvertor/ |title=UniConvertor at Sourceforge.net |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;uniconvertor&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sk1project.org/modules.php?name=Products&amp;product=uniconvertor |title=sK1 - UniConvertor - universal vector graphics translator |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Microsoft]] blocked CDR file format in Microsoft Office 2003 with the release of Service Pack 3 for Office 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/938810/en-us |title=Information about certain file types that are blocked after you install Office 2003 Service Pack 3 |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://coreldraw.com/blogs/gerard/archive/2008/01/03/coreldraw-cdr-file-format-and-microsoft-office-2003-sp3.aspx |title=CorelDRAW .CDR file format and Microsoft Office 2003 SP3  |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft later apologized for inaccurately blaming the CDR file format and other formats for security problems in Microsoft Office and released some tools for solving this problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.betanews.com/article/Microsoft-admits-to-mistakes-in-Office-format-fracas/1199638950 |title=Microsoft admits to 'mistakes' in Office format fracas |accessdate=2010-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
