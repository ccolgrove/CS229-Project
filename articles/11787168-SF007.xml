Ceedo Personal works like a portable operating system by allowing users to carry applications on portable media such as [[USB flash drive]]s and [[pocket hard drive]]s, running them inside a virtual environment. Using a simple interface called the Easy Access Menu, which resembles the Windows Start Menu, users can install standard Windows applications and use them whenever they plug their storage device into a host computer. Since applications running under the Ceedo environment are separate from the host computer, there is no trace left behind once the user disconnects the device.

Ceedo Personal has a variety of popular software applications available to download from its Programs Directory. In addition, Ceedo sells an add-on product called Argo Application Installer that allows the user to install standard Windows application to their Ceedo device that are not available in the Programs Directory.

=== Technology ===

Ceedo Personal uses application virtualization to enable applications to run from a portable device while using resources from the host PC (screen, processing power, drives, internet connection, printers, etc.) The Ceedo client launches the applicationsâ in an independent environment, allowing them to run regardless of the specific settings of the host computer.

=== Portable Storage Devices ===

Ceedo Personal has been licensed by consumer storage vendors including Lexar&lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Flash Drive That Holds Your Computer&quot;, David Pogue, New York Times: http://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/15/technology/15pogue.html?pagewanted=all&lt;/ref&gt;, Seagate&lt;ref&gt;Seagate FreeAgent Go 160 GB - Review Tom's Hardware: http://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/external-hdd-spring-fever,1582-5.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Verbatim, Maxell, ExcelStor, Venzero and others to add value to their portable storage devices. The product has been pre-bundled on millions of devices and is sold worldwide.

=== Comparison to U3 ===

Ceedo Personal has often been compared to another product, [[U3]], that is similar in both appearance and functionality. However, a key difference between U3 and Ceedo is that Ceedo does not require Windows applications to be modified in order for them to be allowed to be carried on the portable device.

Introduced in 2008&lt;ref&gt;Ceedo Enterprise announcement: http://www.ceedo.com/company/jun-6-2008-ceedo-launches-an-application-virtualization-solution-for-the-enterprise.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Ceedo Enterprise is a version of Ceedo's virtual workspace that is designed for business use and includes remote management capabilities.

Unlike Ceedo Personal, Ceedo Enterprise is designed to be carried primarily on encrypted hardware and it can be customized and pre-configured for corporate customers. It is integrated with a back-end called Ceedo Client Management System (CCMS).

=== CCMS ===

Using CCMS, Ceedo Enterprise Client workspaces can be remotely managed. An IT administrator may want to change policies, update remove or install new software applications, apply patches or perform other operations. These client updates can be performed simultaneously and remotely and apply to the Ceedo Clients in the field.

Some of the capabilities of CCMS include:

* Updating Ceedo software
* Updating installed applications
* Installing new applications
* Removing applications
* Modifying client settings
* Adding or removing files and data

=== Ceedo and Citrix ===

Ceedo and Citrix partnered in 2008 to create a portable version of the [[Citrix]] [[XenApp]] client.&lt;ref&gt;Ceedo and Citrix announcement: http://www.ceedo.com/company/aug-05-2008-ceedo-announces-ceedo-enterprise-for-citrix-xenapp.html&lt;/ref&gt;
