'''Downtown Dubai''', previously known as '''Downtown Burj Dubai''', is a large-scale mixed-use complex under development in [[Dubai]], [[United Arab Emirates]]. It is the home of some of the city's most important landmarks including [[Burj Khalifa]], [[Dubai Mall]], and [[Dubai Fountain]]. It covers an area of {{convert|2|sqkm}}, and estimated to cost US$20 [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] (Dh73 billion) upon completion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dubaitraveldesk.com/what.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex is situated along [[Sheikh Zayed Road]] across from [[Al Wasl, Dubai|Al Wasl]] locality on the north-west. It is bounded to the south by [[Business Bay]] and to the north-east by Financial Centre Road, which separates it from [[Zabeel|Zabeel 2]] and [[Trade Centre 2]]. It is connected to the [[Dubai Metro]] via the Burj Khalifa/Dubai Mall Metro Station. The First Interchange, which is in the last phases of construction, will guarantee the free flow of traffic to and from the area.

The Old Town and The Old Town Island is mostly low-rise residential buildings, in addition to three hotels and Souq Al Bahar.
