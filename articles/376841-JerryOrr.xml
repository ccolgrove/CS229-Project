The '''Warsaw Uprising''' ({{lang-pl|powstanie warszawskie}}) was a major [[World War II]] operation by the [[Polish resistance movement in World War II|Polish resistance]] [[Armia Krajowa|Home Army]] ({{lang-pl|Armia Krajowa}}), to liberate [[Warsaw]] from [[Nazi Germany]]. The rebellion was timed to coincide with the Soviet Union's [[Red Army]] approaching the eastern suburbs of the city and the retreat of German forces.&lt;ref name=sb/&gt; Controversially, the Soviet advance stopped short, enabling the Germans to regroup and take the city back from the Polish resistance, which fought for 63 days with little outside support. 

The uprising began on 1 August 1944, as part of a nationwide plan, [[Operation Tempest]], when the Soviet Army [[Lublin-Brest Offensive Operation|approached Warsaw]]. The main Polish objectives were to drive the German occupiers from the city and help with the larger fight against Germany and the [[Axis powers]]. Secondary political objectives were to liberate Warsaw before the Soviets, to underscore Polish [[sovereignty]] by empowering the [[Polish Underground State]] before the Soviet-backed [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] could assume control. Also, short-term causes included the threat of a German round-up of able-bodied Poles, and Moscow radio calling for the Uprising to begin.

Initially, the Poles established control over most of central Warsaw, but the Soviets ignored Polish attempts to establish radio contact and did not advance beyond the city limits. Intense street fighting between the Germans and Poles continued. By 14 September, [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|Polish forces under Soviet high command]] occupied the east bank of the [[Vistula River]] opposite the insurgents' positions; but only 1,200 men made it across to the west bank, and they were not reinforced by the rump of the Red Army. This, and the lack of Soviet air support from a base 5 minutes flying time away, led to allegations that [[Joseph Stalin]] tactically halted his forces to make the operation fail.

[[Winston Churchill]] pleaded with Stalin and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] to help Britain's Polish allies, to no avail. Then, without Soviet [[clearance|air clearance]], Churchill sent over 200 low-level supply drops by the [[Royal Air Force]], the [[South African Air Force]] and the [[Polish Air Force]] under British High Command. Later, after gaining Soviet [[clearance|air clearance]], the [[US Army Air Force]] sent one high-level mass airdrop as part of [[Operation Frantic]].

Although the exact number of casualties remains unknown, it is estimated that about 16,000 members of the Polish resistance were killed and about 6,000 badly wounded. In addition, between 150,000 and 200,000 Polish civilians died, mostly from mass murders. [[Rescue of Jews by Poles during the Holocaust|Jews being harboured by Poles]] were exposed by German house-to-house clearances and mass evictions of entire neighbourhoods. German casualties totalled over 8,000 soldiers killed and missing, and 9,000 wounded. During the [[urban combat]] approximately 25% of Warsaw's buildings were destroyed. Following the surrender of Polish forces, German troops systematically leveled 35% of the city block by block. Together with earlier damage suffered in the [[invasion of Poland (1939)|1939 invasion of Poland]] and the [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]] in 1943, over 85% of the city was destroyed by January 1945, when the Soviets entered the city.

{{quote|&quot;We have one point from which every evil emanates. That point is Warsaw. If we didn't have Warsaw in the [[General Government]], we wouldn't have four-fifths of the difficulties with which we must contend.&quot; â German [[Governor-General]] [[Hans Frank]], [[KrakÃ³w]], 14 December 1943&lt;ref&gt;Frank's diary quoted in [[Norman Davies|Davies, Norman]] (2004). ''[[Rising '44. The Battle for Warsaw]]''. London: Pan Books. ISBN 0-330-48863-5. p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By July 1944, Poland had been occupied by the forces of Nazi Germany for almost five years. The underground [[Armia Krajowa|Polish Home Army]], which was loyal to the [[Polish government-in-exile]], had long planned some form of insurrection against the occupiers. Germany was fighting a coalition of [[Allies of World War II|Allied powers]], led by the United States, the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. The initial plan of the Home Army was to link up with the invading forces of the [[Western Allies]] as they liberated Europe from the Nazis. However, in 1943 it became apparent that the Soviets, rather than the Western Allies, would reach the pre-war borders of Poland before the Allied invasion of Europe made notable headway.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 204â206.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets and the Poles had a common enemyâNazi Germanyâbut other than that, they were working towards different post-war goals; the Home Army desired a pro-Western, democratic Poland, but the Soviet leader Stalin intended to establish a communist, pro-Soviet regime. It became obvious that the advancing Soviet [[Red Army]] might not come to Poland as an ally but rather only as &quot;the ally of an ally&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''sojusznik naszych sojusznikÃ³w'': Instytut Zachodni, ''PrzeglÄd zachodni'', v.&amp;nbsp;47 no.&amp;nbsp;3â4 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flaga PPP.svg|thumb|A [[Flag of Poland|Polish flag]] with an &quot;[[Kotwica|anchor]]&quot; device was used as an emblem by the Polish resistance.]]
The Soviets and the Poles distrusted each other, and [[Soviet partisans in Poland]] often clashed with Polish resistance increasingly united under the Home Army's front.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt; Stalin broke off [[PolandâRussia relations|Polish-Soviet relations]] on 25 April 1943 after the Germans revealed the [[Katyn massacre]], but Stalin refused to admit it and blamed the Germans for propaganda. Afterwards, Stalin created the Rudenko Commission, whose goal was to blame the Germans at all costs. The alliance took Stalin's words as truth to keep the Anti-Nazi alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 48, 115.&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October, the Polish government-in-exile issued an instruction to the effect that if diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union were not resumed before the Soviet entry into Poland, Home Army forces were to remain underground pending further decisions. However, the Home Army commander, [[Tadeusz BÃ³r-Komorowski]], took a different approach, and on 20 November, he outlined his own plan, which became known as &quot;[[Operation Tempest]]&quot;. On the approach of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]], local units of the Home Army were to harass the German ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' in the rear and co-operate with incoming Soviet units as much as possible. Although doubts existed about the military wisdom of a major uprising, planning continued.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 206â208.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eve of the battle==
[[File:Tadeusz Bor Komorowski.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Tadeusz BÃ³r-Komorowski]] commanded the Polish Home Army.]]
The situation came to a head on 13 July 1944 as the Soviet offensive crossed the old [[Polish border]]. At this point the Poles had to make a decision: either initiate the uprising in the current difficult political situation and risk problems with Soviet support, or fail to rebel and face [[Soviet propaganda]] describing the Home Army as impotent or worse, Nazi collaborators. They feared that if Poland was 'liberated' by the Red Army, then the Allies would ignore the [[Polish Government in exile|London-based Polish government]]  in the aftermath of the war. The urgency for a final decision on strategy increased as it became clear that after successful Polish-Soviet co-operation in the liberation of Polish territory (for example, in [[Operation Ostra Brama]]), [[NKVD|Soviet security forces]] behind the frontline shot or arrested Polish officers and forcibly conscripted lower ranks into the [[Polish Armed Forces in the East|Soviet-controlled forces]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/nkvd.htm The NKVD Against the Home Army (Armia Krajowa)], Warsaw Uprising, based on Andrzej Paczkowski. Poland, the &quot;Enemy Nation&quot;, pp. 372â375, in Black Book of Communism. Crimes, Terror, Repression. Harvard University Press, London, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 July, the High Command of the Home Army decided that the time to launch Operation Tempest in Warsaw was imminent.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; The plan was intended both as a political manifestation of Polish sovereignty and as a direct operation against the German occupiers.&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt; On 25 July, the Polish government-in-exile (without the knowledge and against the wishes of Polish Commander-in-Chief General [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 4 and Davies, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;) approved the plan for an uprising in Warsaw with the timing to be decided locally.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 210â211.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early summer of 1944, German plans required Warsaw to serve as the [[Festung Warschau|defensive center of the area]] and to be held at all costs. The Germans had fortifications constructed and built up their forces in the area. This process slowed after the failed [[20 July Plot]] to assassinate the Nazi leader [[Adolf Hitler]], and around that time, the Germans in Warsaw were weak and visibly demoralized.&lt;ref name=&quot;p1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&amp;id=12352&amp;se_id=12352 Warsaw Rising Museum: Before the Rising]&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the end of July, German forces in the area were reinforced.&lt;ref name=&quot;p1&quot;/&gt; On 27 July, the Governor of the Warsaw District, [[Ludwig Fischer (NSDAP)|Ludwig Fischer]], called for 100,000 Polish men and women to report for work as part of a plan which envisaged the Poles constructing fortifications around the city.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The inhabitants of Warsaw ignored his demand, and the Home Army command became worried about possible reprisals or mass round-ups, which would disable their ability to mobilize.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet forces were approaching Warsaw, and Soviet-controlled radio stations called for the Polish people to rise in arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;p1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 4 and Davies, pp. 164â165.&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 July, the [[Union of Polish Patriots]], in a broadcast from Moscow, stated: &quot;The Polish Army of Polish Patriots... calls on the thousands of brothers thirsting to fight, to smash the foe before he can recover from his defeat... Every Polish homestead must become a stronghold in the struggle against the invaders... Not a moment is to be lost.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Tragedy of Warsaw and its Documentation&quot;, By The Duchess of Atholl,. D.B.E., Hon. D.C.L., LL.D., F.R.C.M. 1945, London&lt;/ref&gt; On 29 July, the first Soviet armored units reached the outskirts of Warsaw, where they were counter-attacked by two German Panzer Corps: the 39th and 4th SS.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt;  On 29 July 1944 Radio Station Kosciuszko located in Moskow emitted few times His &quot;Appeal to Warsaw&quot; and called to &quot;Fight The Germans!&quot;: &quot;No doubt Warsaw already hears the guns of the battle which is soon to bring her liberation. [...] The Polish Army now entering Polish territory, trained in the Soviet Union, is now joined to the People's Army to form the Corps of the Polish Armed Forces, the armed arm of our nation in its struggle for independence. Its ranks will be joined tomorrow by the sons of Warsaw. They will all together, with the Allied Army pursue the enemy westwards, wipe out the Hitlerite vermin from Polish land and strike a mortal blow at the beast of Prussian Imperialism.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.warsawuprising.com/doc/kosciuszko.htm full text of broadcast]&lt;/ref&gt; BÃ³r-Komorowski and several high-ranking officers held a meeting on that day. [[Jan Nowak-JezioraÅski]], who had recently arrived from London, expressed the view that support from the Allies would be weak, but his points received little attention.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Warsaw Uprising of 1944&quot;/&gt; Believing that the time for action had arrived, on 31 July, the Polish commanders General [[Tadeusz BÃ³r-Komorowski]] and Colonel [[Antoni ChruÅciel]] ordered full mobilization of Home Army forces for 17:00 the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Home Army forces of the Warsaw District numbered between 20,000&lt;ref name=&quot;BW&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Arnold-Forster|Arnold-Forster, Mark]] (1973; repr. 1983). ''[[The World at War]]''. London: Collins/Thames Television repr. Thames Methuen. ISBN 0-423-00680-0. p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt; and 49,000&lt;ref name=&quot;AB1&quot;/&gt; soldiers. Other formations also contributed soldiers; estimates range from 2,000 in total&lt;ref&gt;Borkiewicz, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; to about 3,500 from the far-right [[Narodowe SiÅy Zbrojne|National Armed Forces]] and a few dozen from the communist [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Marek Chodakiewicz|Chodakiewicz, Marek]] (April 2002). &quot;Der Warschauer Aufstand 1944&quot;. ''[[The Sarmatian Review]]'' Issue 02/2002 pp.875â880.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of them had trained for several years in [[Partisan (military)|partisan]] and [[urban guerrilla]] warfare, but lacked experience in prolonged daylight fighting. The forces lacked equipment,&lt;ref name=&quot;WUmuseumcom&quot;/&gt; because the Home Army had shuttled weapons to the east of the country before the decision to include Warsaw in Operation Tempest.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Other partisan groups subordinated themselves to Home Army command, and many volunteers joined during the fighting, including [[Polish Jews|Jews]] freed from the [[GÄsiÃ³wka]] [[concentration camp]] in the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]].&lt;ref&gt;The exact number of Poles of Jewish ancestry and Jews to take part in the uprising is a matter of controversy. General [[Tadeusz BÃ³r-Komorowski]] estimated the number of Jewish Poles in Polish ranks at 1,000, other authors place it at between several hundred and 2,000.

Colonel [[Antoni ChruÅciel]] (codename &quot;Monter&quot;) commanded the Polish forces in Warsaw. Initially he divided his forces into eight areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;struktura&quot;/&gt;
On 20 September, they were reorganized to align with the three areas of the city held by Polish forces. The entire force, renamed the Warsaw Home Army Corps ({{lang-pl|Warszawski Korpus Armii Krajowej}}) and commanded by General Antoni ChruÅcielâpromoted from Colonel on 14 Septemberâformed into three [[infantry division]]s (ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie, Å»oliborz and MokotÃ³w).&lt;ref name=struktura/&gt;

In late July 1944 the German units stationed in and around Warsaw were divided into three categories. The first and the most numerous was the garrison of Warsaw. As of 31 July, it numbered some 11,000 troops under General [[Rainer Stahel]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Powstanie Warszawskie 1944&quot;/&gt;

These forces included:
* about 5,000 regular troops;
* 4,000 [[Luftwaffe]] personnel (1,000 at [[OkÄcie airport]],&lt;br&gt; 700 at [[Bielany]], 1,000 in [[Boernerowo]],&lt;br&gt; 300 at [[SÅuÅ¼ewiec]] and 1,000 in [[anti-air artillery]]&lt;br&gt; posts throughout the city);
* about 2,000 men of the Sentry Regiment Warsaw&lt;br&gt; ({{lang-de|Wachtregiment Warschau}}),&lt;br&gt; including four infantry battalions&lt;br&gt; (''Patz'', ''Baltz'', No. 996 and No. 997),&lt;br&gt; and an an [[SS]] reconnaissance squadron (ca. 350 men).&lt;br&gt;.

These well-equipped German forces prepared for the defence of the city's key positions for many months. Several hundred concrete bunkers and barbed wire lines protected the buildings and areas occupied by the Germans. Apart from the garrison itself, numerous army units were stationed on both banks of the Vistula and in the city. The second category was formed by police and SS under Col. Paul Otto Geibel, numbering initially 5,710 men,&lt;ref&gt;Borkiewicz, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; including ''[[Schutzpolizei]]'' and ''[[Waffen-SS]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The third category was formed by various auxiliary units, including detachments of the ''Bahnschutz'' (rail guard), ''Werkschutz'' (factory guard), ''Sonderdienst'' and ''Sonderabteilungen'' (military Nazi party units).&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the uprising the German side received reinforcements on a daily basis, and Stahel was replaced as overall commander by SS-General [[Erich von dem Bach]] in early August. As of 20 August 1944, the German units directly involved with fighting in Warsaw comprised 17,000 men arranged in two battle groups:&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 666â667.&lt;/ref&gt; Battle Group Rohr (commanded by Major General Rohr), which included [[Bronislav Kaminski]]'s brigade and Battle Group Reinefarth (commanded by SS-''GruppenfÃ¼hrer'' [[Heinz Reinefarth]]) consisted of [[Dirlewanger Brigade|Attack Group Dirlewanger]] (commanded by [[Oskar Dirlewanger]]), Attack Group Reck (commanded by Major Reck), Attack Group Schmidt (commanded by Colonel Schmidt) and various support and backup units.

After days of hesitation, at 17:00 on 31 July, the Polish headquarters scheduled &quot;W-hour&quot; (from the Polish ''wybuch'', &quot;explosion&quot;; also ''wolnoÅÄ'', ''freedom''), the moment of the start of the uprising, for 17:00 on the following day.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; The decision proved to be a costly strategic mistake because the under-equipped Polish forces were prepared for a series of coordinated surprise night attacks. Attacking during daylight exposed them to German machine gun fire. Although many partisan units were already mobilized and waiting at assembly points throughout the city, the mobilization of thousands of young men and women was hard to conceal. Sporadic fighting started in advance of &quot;W-hour&quot;, notably in [[Å»oliborz]],&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 79 and Davies, p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; and around [[Warsaw Uprising Square|Napoleon Square]] and DÄbrowski Square.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; The Germans had anticipated the possibility of an uprising, though they had not realised its size or strength.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 95â97.&lt;/ref&gt; At 16:30 Governor Fischer put the garrison on full alert.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 86â87 and Davies, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt;

That evening the insurgents captured a major German arsenal, the main post office and power station, Praga railway station and the tallest building in Warsaw, the [[Prudential building in Warsaw|Prudential building]]. However, Castle Square, the police district, and the airport remained in German hands.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 245â247.&lt;/ref&gt; The first two days were crucial in establishing the battlefield for the rest of the fight. The insurgents were most successful in the [[Warszawa-ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie|City Center]], [[Warsaw Old Town|Old Town]], and [[Wola]] districts. However, several major German strongholds remained, and in some areas of Wola the Poles sustained heavy losses that forced an early retreat. In other areas such as [[MokotÃ³w]], the attackers almost completely failed to secure any objectives and controlled only the residential areas. In [[Praga]], on the east bank of the Vistula, the Poles were sent back into hiding by a high concentration of German forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Praga&quot;/&gt; Most crucially, the fighters in different areas failed to link up, either with each other or with areas outside Warsaw, leaving each sector isolated from the others. After the first hours of fighting, many units adopted a more defensive strategy, while civilians began erecting barricades. Despite all the problems, by 4 August most of the city was in Polish hands.

The uprising was intended to last a few days until Soviet forces arrived;&lt;ref name=&quot;Powstanie Warszawskie 19441&quot;/&gt; however, this never happened, and the Polish forces had to fight with little outside assistance. The results of the first two days of fighting in different parts of the city were as follows:
* ''Area I'' (city centre and the Old Town): Units captured most of their assigned territory, but failed to capture areas with strong pockets of resistance from the Germans (the Warsaw University buildings, [[PAST]] skyscraper, the headquarters of the German garrison in the [[Saxon Palace]], the [[Nur fÃ¼r Deutsche|German-only]] area near Szucha Avenue, and the bridges over the Vistula). They thus failed to create a central stronghold, secure communication links to other areas, or a secure land connection with the northern area of [[Å»oliborz]] through the northern railway line and the [[Cytadela|Citadel]].

* ''Area II'' (Å»oliborz, [[Marymont]], [[Bielany]]): Units failed to secure the most important military targets near Å»oliborz. Many units retreated outside of the city, into the forests. Although they captured most of the area around Å»oliborz, the soldiers of Colonel MieczysÅaw Niedzielski (&quot;Å»ywiciel&quot;) failed to secure the Citadel area and break through German defences at [[Warszawa GdaÅska|Warsaw GdaÅsk]] railway station.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 89â90.&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Area III'' ([[Wola]]): Units initially secured most of the territory, but sustained heavy losses (up to 30%). Some units retreated into the forests, while others retreated to the eastern part of the area. In the northern part of Wola the soldiers of Colonel Jan Mazurkiewicz (&quot;RadosÅaw&quot;) managed to capture the German barracks, the German supply depot at Stawki Street, and the flanking position at the [[Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery]].

* ''Area IV'' ([[Ochota]]): The units mobilized in this area did not capture either the territory or the military targets (the [[GÄsiÃ³wka]] concentration camp, and the SS and [[Sicherheitspolizei|Sipo]] barracks on Narutowicz Square). After suffering heavy casualties most of the Home Army forces retreated to the forests west of Warsaw. Only two small units of approximately 200 to 300 men under Lieut. Andrzej Chyczewski (&quot;Gustaw&quot;) remained in the area and managed to create strong pockets of resistance. They were later reinforced by units from the city center. Elite units of the [[Kedyw]] managed to secure most of the northern part of the area and captured all of the military targets there. However, they were soon tied down by German tactical counter-attacks from the south and west.

* ''Area V'' ([[MokotÃ³w]]): The situation in this area was very serious from the start of hostilities. The partisans aimed to capture the heavily defended Police Area (''Dzielnica policyjna'') on [[Rakowiecka]] Street, and establish a connection with the city center through open terrain at the former airfield of [[Pole Mokotowskie]]. As both of the areas were heavily fortified and could be approached only through open terrain, the assaults failed. Some units retreated into the forests, while others managed to capture parts of Dolny MokotÃ³w, which was, however, severed from most communication routes to other areas.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last building held was on the corner of the Avenue of Independence and Rakowieczka Street under formidable assault by German Panzers.  This building was named by Second Lieutenant Andrzej Zwartynski â &quot;Zyndram&quot; â of Compania 02, &quot;Baszta&quot; saying, &quot;This is our Alcazar&quot;, in reference to the [[Siege of the AlcÃ¡zar]] in which the [[Francoist|nationalist]] forces held the castle [[AlcÃ¡zar of Toledo]] against overwhelming [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republican]] forces, in the Spanish Civil war.

* ''Area VI'' ([[Praga]]): The Uprising was also started on the right bank of the Vistula, where the main task was to seize the bridges on the river and secure the bridgeheads until the arrival of the Red Army. It was clear that, since the location was far worse than that of the other areas, there was no chance of any help from outside. After some minor initial successes, the forces of Lt.Col. Antoni Å»urowski (&quot;Andrzej&quot;) were badly outnumbered by the Germans. The fights were halted, and the Home Army forces were forced back underground.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;
* ''Area VII'' (''[[Powiat]] warszawski''): this area consisted of territories outside Warsaw city limits. Actions here mostly failed to capture their targets.

An additional area within the Polish command structure was formed by the units of the Directorate of Sabotage and Diversion or ''[[Kedyw]]'', an elite formation that was to guard the headquarters and was to be used as an &quot;armed ambulance&quot;, thrown into the battle in the most endangered areas. These units secured parts of ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie and Wola; along with the units of ''Area I'', they were the most successful during the first few hours.

Among the most notable primary targets that were not taken during the opening stages of the uprising were the airfields of [[OkÄcie]] and [[Pole Mokotowskie]], as well as the PAST skyscraper overlooking the city center and the [[Warszawa GdaÅska|GdaÅsk railway station]] guarding the passage between the center and the northern borough of Å»oliborz..

The Uprising reached its apogee on 4 August when the Home Army soldiers managed to establish front lines in the westernmost boroughs of [[Wola]] and [[Ochota]]. However, it was also the moment at which the German army stopped its retreat westwards and began receiving reinforcements. On the same day SS General [[Erich von dem Bach]] was appointed commander of all the forces employed against the Uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; German counter-attacks aimed to link up with the remaining German pockets and then cut off the Uprising from the Vistula river. Among the reinforcing units were forces under the command of [[Heinz Reinefarth]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;

On 5 August Reinefarth's three attack groups started their advance westward along ''Wolska'' and ''GÃ³rczewska'' streets toward the main East-West communication line of [[Aleje Jerozolimskie|Jerusalem Avenue]]. Their advance was halted, but the regiments began carrying out [[Heinrich Himmler]]'s orders: behind the lines, special SS, police and ''Wehrmacht'' groups went from house to house, shooting the inhabitants regardless of age or sex and burning their bodies.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; Estimates of civilians killed in Wola and Ochota range from 20,000 to 50,000,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 252.&lt;/ref&gt; 40,000 by 8 August in Wola alone,&lt;ref name=&quot;Muzeum Powstania otwarte&quot;/&gt; or as high as 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} {{Cite news | edition = Warsaw | author = Jerzy KÅoczowski | title = O Powstaniu Warszawskim opowiada prof.

The policy was designed to crush the Poles' will to fight and put the uprising to an end without having to commit to heavy city fighting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&amp;id=12449&amp;se_id=12452 The slaughter in Wola] at Warsaw Rising Museum&lt;/ref&gt; With time, the Germans realized that atrocities only stiffened resistance and that some political solution should be found, as the thousands of men at the disposal of the German commander were unable to effectively counter the insurgents in an urban guerilla setting.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 254â257.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--Should we mention Kaminski's death somewhere here?--&gt; They aimed to gain a significant victory to show the Home Army the futility of further fighting and induce them to surrender. This did not succeed. Until mid-September, the Germans shot all captured insurgents on the spot, but from the end of September, some of the captured Polish soldiers were treated as [[Prisoner of war|POWs]].&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the loss of Wola, the Polish resistance stiffened. ''ZoÅka'' and ''Wacek'' battalions managed to capture the ruins of the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and liberate the [[GÄsiÃ³wka]] concentration camp, freeing about 350 Jews.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; The area became one of the main communication links between the insurgents fighting in Wola and those defending the Old Town. On 7 August German forces were strengthened by the arrival of tanks using civilians as [[human shield]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; After two days of heavy fighting they managed to bisect Wola and reach [[Bankowy Square]]. However, by then the net of barricades, street fortifications and tank obstacles was already well-prepared and both sides reached a stalemate, with heavy house-to-house fighting.

Between 9 August and 18 August pitched battles raged around the Old Town and nearby Bankowy Square, with successful attacks by the Germans and counter-attacks from the Poles. German tactics hinged on bombardment through the use of [[heavy artillery]]&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[tactical bomber]]s, against which the Poles were unable to effectively defend, as they lacked anti-aircraft artillery weapons. Even clearly marked hospitals were dive-bombed by Stukas.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 333, 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Battle of Stalingrad]] had already shown the danger a city can pose to armies which fight within it and the importance of local support, the Warsaw Uprising was probably the first demonstration that in an urban terrain, a vastly under-equipped force supported by the civilian population can hold its own against better-equipped professional soldiersâthough at the cost of considerable sacrifice on the part of the city's residents.

The Poles held the Old Town until a decision to withdraw was made at the end of August. On successive nights until 2 September, the defenders of the Old Town withdrew through the sewers, which were a major means of communication between different parts of the Uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 132â133 and Davies, p. 354.&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of people were evacuated in this way. Those that remained were either shot or transported to concentration camps like Mauthausen and Sachsenhausen once the Germans regained control.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 355.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Berling's landings ===
&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION --&gt;
Soviet attacks on the 4th SS Panzer Corps east of Warsaw were renewed on 26 August, and the Germans were forced to retreat into Praga. The Soviet army under the command of [[Konstantin Rokossovsky]] captured Praga and arrived on the east bank of the Vistula in mid-September. By 13 September, the Germans had destroyed the remaining bridges over the Vistula, signalling that they were abandoning all their positions east of the river.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp.138â141 and Davies, p. 332.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Praga area Polish units under the command of General [[Zygmunt Berling]] (thus sometimes known as ''berlingowcy'' â &quot;the Berling men&quot;) fought on the Soviet side. Three patrols of his [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|1st Polish Army]] ({{lang-pl|1 Armia Wojska Polskiego}}) landed in the [[CzerniakÃ³w]] and [[PowiÅle]] areas and made contact with Home Army forces on the night of 14/15 September. The artillery cover and air support provided by the Soviets was unable to effectively counter enemy machine-gun fire as the Poles crossed the river, and the landing troops sustained heavy losses.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 358â359.&lt;/ref&gt; Only small elements of the main units made it ashore (I and III battalions of 9th infantry regiment, 3rd Infantry Division).&lt;ref name=&quot;Berling landings&quot;/&gt;
[[File:POL Warszawa Pomnik generala Berlinga.jpg|thumb|left|General Berling Monument in Warsaw. In the background, [[Åazienkowski Bridge]].]]
The limited landings by the 1st Polish Army represented the only external ground force which arrived to physically support the uprising; and even they were curtailed by the Soviet High Command.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berling landings&quot;/&gt;

The Germans intensified their attacks on the Home Army positions near the river to prevent any further landings, but were not able to make any significant advances for several days while Polish forces held those vital positions in preparation for a new expected wave of Soviet landings. Polish units from the eastern shore attempted several more landings, and from 15 to 23 September sustained heavy losses (including the destruction of all their landing boats and most of their other river crossing equipment).&lt;ref name=&quot;Berling landings&quot;/&gt; Red Army support was inadequate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Berling landings&quot;/&gt; After the failure of repeated attempts by the 1st Polish Army to link up with the insurgents, the Soviets limited their assistance to sporadic artillery and air support. Conditions that prevented the Germans from dislodging the insurgents also acted to prevent the Poles from dislodging the Germans. Plans for a river crossing were suspended &quot;for at least 4 months&quot;, since operations against the 9th Army's five [[panzer]] divisions were problematic at that point, and the commander of the 1st Polish Army, General Berling was relieved of his duties by his Soviet superiors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard J.

From this point on, the Warsaw Uprising can be seen as a one-sided war of attrition or, alternatively, as a fight for acceptable terms of surrender. The Poles were besieged in three areas of the city: ÅrÃ³dmieÅcie, Å»oliborz and MokotÃ³w.

In 1939 Warsaw had roughly 1,350,000 inhabitants. Over a million were still living in the city at the start of the Uprising. In Polish-controlled territory, during the first weeks of the Uprising, people tried to recreate the normal day-to-day life of their free country. Cultural life was vibrant, both among the soldiers and civilian population, with theatres, post offices, newspapers and similar activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} {{Cite book | edition = 1 | publisher = Czytelnik | page = 169 | last = Nawrocka-DoÅska | first = Barbara | title = Powszedni dzieÅ dramatu | location = Warsaw | year = 1961 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Boys and girls of the [[ZwiÄzek Harcerstwa Polskiego|Polish Scouts]] acted as couriers for an underground postal service, risking their lives daily to transmit any information that might help their people.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{pl icon}} {{Cite book | publisher = Muzeum Martyrologii i Walki JeÅcÃ³w Wojennych w Åambinowicach | page = 70 | last = Tomczyk | first = Damian | title = MÅodociani uczestnicy powstania warszawskiego | location = Åambinowice | year = 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of the Uprising, lack of food, medicine, overcrowding and indiscriminate German air and artillery assault on the city made the civilian situation more and more desperate.

=== Food shortages ===
&lt;!-- DO NOT ADD MORE PICTURES TO THIS SECTION --&gt;
[[File:Warsaw Uprising boyscouts.jpg|thumb|right|Tadeusz Rajszczak (&quot;Maszynka&quot;) (far left) and two other young soldiers from ''Batalion MiotÅa'', 2 September 1944]]
As the Uprising was supposed to be relieved by the Soviets in a matter of days, the Polish underground did not predict food shortages would be a problem. However, as the fighting dragged on, the inhabitants of the city faced hunger and starvation. A major break-through took place on 6 August, when Polish units recaptured the [[Haberbusch i Schiele]] brewery complex at Ceglana Street. From that time on the Varsovians lived mostly on barley from the brewery's warehouses. Every day up to several thousand people organized into cargo teams reported to the brewery for bags of barley and then distributed them in the city center. The barley was then ground in coffee grinders and boiled with water to form a so-called spit-soup ({{lang-pl|pluj-zupa}}). The &quot;SowiÅski&quot; Battalion managed to hold the brewery until the end of the fighting.

Another serious problem for civilians and soldiers alike was a shortage of water.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; By mid-August most of the water conduits were either out of order or filled with corpses. In addition, the main water pumping station remained in German hands.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt; To prevent the spread of epidemics and provide the people with water, the authorities ordered all janitors to supervise the construction of water wells in the backyards of every house. On 21 September the Germans blew up the remaining pumping stations at Koszykowa Street and after that the public wells were the only source of potable water in the besieged city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stacja FiltrÃ³w&quot;/&gt; By the end of September, the city center had more than 90 functioning wells.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Lack of outside support in the Warsaw Uprising}}
According to many historians, a major cause of the eventual failure of the uprising was the almost complete lack of outside support and the late arrival of that which did arrive.&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt;
The Polish government-in-exile carried out frantic diplomatic efforts to gain support from the Western Allies prior to the start of battle but the allies would not act without Soviet approval. The Polish government in London asked the British several times to send an allied mission to Poland,&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt; however, the British mission did not arrive until December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 450.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after their arrival, they met up with Soviet authorities, who arrested and imprisoned them.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 452.&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of the mission's deputy commander, it was &quot;a complete failure&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 453.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, from August 1943 to July 1944, over 200 British [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) flights dropped an estimated 146 Polish personnel trained in Great Britain, over 4000 containers of supplies, and $16 million in banknotes and gold to the Home Army.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 68â69.&lt;/ref&gt;

The only support operation which ran continuously for the duration of the Uprising were night supply drops by long-range planes of the RAF, other [[Commonwealth of Nations|British Commonwealth]] air forces, and units of the [[Polish Air Force]], which had to use distant airfields in Italy, reducing the amount of supplies they could carry. The RAF made 223 sorties and lost 34 aircraft. The effect of these airdrops was mostly psychologicalâthey delivered too few supplies for the needs of the insurgents, and many airdrops landed outside insurgent-controlled territory.

From 4 August the Western Allies began supporting the Uprising with airdrops of munitions and other supplies.&lt;ref name=&quot;WUairdrops&quot;/&gt; Initially the flights were carried out mostly by the ''1568th Polish Special Duties Flight'' of the [[Polish Air Force]] (later renamed [[No. 301 Polish Bomber Squadron]]) stationed in [[Bari]] and [[Brindisi]] in Italy, flying [[B-24 Liberator]], [[Handley Page Halifax]] and [[C-47 Skytrain|Douglas C-47 Dakota]] planes. Later on, at the insistence of the Polish government-in-exile{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, they were joined by the Liberators of 2 Wing âNo. 31 and No. 34 Squadrons of the [[South African Air Force]] based at [[Foggia]] in Southern Italy, and Halifaxes, flown by [[No. 148 Squadron RAF|No. 148]] and No. 178 RAF Squadrons. The drops by British, Polish and South African forces continued until 21 September. The total weight of allied drops varies according to source (104 tons,&lt;ref name=&quot;Airlift to Warsaw. The Rising of 19442&quot;/&gt; 230 tons&lt;ref name=&quot;WUairdrops&quot;/&gt; or 239 tons&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt;), over 200 flights were made.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1944.pl/index.php?a=site_text&amp;id=12440&amp;se_id=12448 ALLIED AIRMEN OVER WARSAW] at Warsaw Rising Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union did not allow the Western Allies to use its airports for the airdrops,&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt; so the planes had to use bases in the United Kingdom and Italy which reduced their carrying weight and number of sorties. The Allies' specific request for the use of landing strips made on 20 August was denied by Stalin on 22 August.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairly&quot;/&gt; Stalin referred to the insurgents as &quot;a handful of criminals&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Kamil Tchorek, [http://www.warsawuprising.com/paper/times_online.htm Escaped British Airman Was Hero of Warsaw Uprising]&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that the uprising was inspired by &quot;enemies of the Soviet Union&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WUairfields&quot;/&gt; Thus by denying landing rights to Allied aircraft on Soviet-controlled territory the Soviets vastly limited effectiveness of Allied assistance to the Uprising, and even fired at Allied airplanes which carried supplies from Italy and strayed into Soviet-controlled airspace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairly&quot;/&gt;

American support was also limited. After Stalin's objections to supporting the uprising, British Prime Minister [[Winston Churchill]] telegraphed U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] on 25 August and proposed sending planes in defiance of Stalin, to &quot;see what happens&quot;. Unwilling to upset Stalin before the [[Yalta Conference]], Roosevelt replied on 26 August: &quot;I do not consider it advantageous to the long-range general war prospect for me to join you&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fairly&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cnn.com/CNN/Programs/presents/shows/warsaw.rising/interactive/timeline.warsaw/frameset.exclude.html Warsaw Uprising CNN Special]'' â 26 August.

Finally on 18 September the Soviets allowed a [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]] flight of 107 [[B-17 Flying Fortress]]es of the 3 division [[Eighth Air Force]] to re-fuel and reload at Soviet airfields used in [[Operation Frantic]], but it was too little too late. The planes dropped 100 tons of supplies but only 20 were recovered by the insurgents due to the wide area over which they were spread.&lt;ref name=&quot;WUairfields&quot;/&gt; The vast majority of supplies fell into German-held areas.&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, p. 121 and Davies, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; The USAAF lost two B-17s&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 377.&lt;/ref&gt; with a further seven damaged. The planes landed at the Operation Frantic airbases in the Soviet Union. There they were rearmed and refuelled and the next day 100 B-17s and 61 P-51s left the USSR to bomb the marshalling yard at [[Szolnok]] in Hungary on their way back to bases in Italy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://paul.rutgers.edu/%7Emcgrew/wwii/usaf/html/Sep.44.html Combat Chronology of the US Army Air Forces September 1944: 17,18,19] copied from [http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/titleindex.htm USAF History Publications] &amp; [http://www.airforcehistory.hq.af.mil/Publications/fulltext/wwii_combat_chronology.pdf wwii combat chronology (pdf)])&lt;/ref&gt; Soviet intelligence reports show that Soviet commanders on the ground near Warsaw estimated that 96% of the supplies dropped by the Americans fell into German hands.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 392.&lt;/ref&gt; From the Soviet perspective, the Americans were supplying the Nazis instead of aiding the insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 391.&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviets refused permission for any further American flights until 30 September, by which time the weather was too poor to fly, and the insurgency was nearly over.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 381.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 14 September the Soviets began their own airdrops, dropping about 55 tons in total until 28 September. However, since the Soviet airmen did not equip the containers with [[parachute]]s, many of the packages were damaged.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although German air defence over the Warsaw area itself was almost non-existent, about 12% of the 296 planes taking part in the operations were lost because they had to fly 1,600&amp;nbsp;km out and the same distance back over heavily defended enemy territory (112 out of 637 Polish and 133 out of 735 British and South African airman were shot down).&lt;ref name=&quot;WUairfields&quot;/&gt; Most of the drops were made during night, at no more than 100â300 feet altitude, and poor accuracy left many parachuted packages stranded behind German-controlled territory (only about 50 tons of supplies, less than 50% delivered, was recovered by the insurgents).&lt;ref name=&quot;WUairdrops&quot;/&gt;

The role of the Red Army during the Warsaw Uprising remains controversial and is still disputed by historians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt; The Uprising started when the Red Army appeared on the city's doorstep, and the Poles in Warsaw were counting on Soviet aid coming in a matter of days. This basic scenario of an uprising against the Germans launched a few days before the arrival of Allied forces played out successfully in a number of European capitals, notably [[Liberation of Paris|Paris]]&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Prague uprising|Prague]]. However, despite retaining positions south-east of Warsaw barely 10&amp;nbsp;km from the city center for about 40 days, the Soviets did not extend effective aid to the desperate city. The sector was held by the understrength [[German 73rd Infantry Division]], destroyed many times on the Eastern Front and recently reconstituted.&lt;ref&gt;''SS: The Waffen-SS War in Russia 1941â45'' Relevant page viewable via [http://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&amp;hl=en&amp;id=HAMd81LJJs4C&amp;pg=PA157&amp;lpg=PA157&amp;dq=73rd+infantry+division&amp;prev=http://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D73rd%2Binfantry%2Bdivision%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&amp;sig=k-va3MBk58jCUKatCmNi6UU10BQ Google book search]&lt;/ref&gt; The division, though weak, did not experience significant Soviet pressure during that period. The Red Army was fighting intense battles to the south of Warsaw, to seize and maintain bridgeheads over the Vistula river, and to the north, to gain bridgeheads over the river Narew. The best German armored divisions were fighting on those sectors. Despite that, both of these objectives had been mostly secured by early September. The Soviet 47th army did not move into [[Praga]], on the right bank of the Vistula, until the 11th of September. In three days the Soviets gained control of the suburb, a few hundred meters from the main battle on the other side of the river, as the resistance by the German 73rd division collapsed quickly. If the Soviets had reached this stage in early August, the crossing of the river would have been easier, as the Poles then held considerable stretches of the riverfront. However, by mid-September a series of German attacks had reduced the Poles to holding one narrow stretch of the riverbank, in the district of [[CzerniakÃ³w]]. The Poles were counting on the Soviet forces to cross to the left bank where the main battle of the uprising was occurring. Though Berling's 1st Polish army did cross the river, their support from the Soviets was inadequate and the main Soviet force did not follow them.&lt;ref&gt;Borowiec, pp. 148â151.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the reasons given for the failure of the uprising was the reluctance of the Soviet Red Army to help the Resistance. On 1 August, only several hours prior to the outbreak of the uprising, the Soviet advance was halted by a direct order from the Kremlin.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowak&quot;/&gt; Soon afterwards the Soviet tank units stopped receiving any oil from their depots.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowak&quot;/&gt; By then the Soviets knew of the planned outbreak from their agents in Warsaw and, more importantly, from the Polish prime minister [[StanisÅaw MikoÅajczyk]], who informed them of the Polish plans a few hours before.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nowak&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;According to Polish documents, MikoÅajczyk informed the Soviet foreign minister Molotov at 9:00 p.m. on 31 July (Ciechanowski (1974), p.68)&lt;/ref&gt; The Red Army's halt and lack of support for the Polish resistance is seen as a calculated decision by Stalin to achieve certain post-war political objectives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt; Some sources say that had the Home Army triumphed, the Polish government-in-exile would have legitimacy to reinstate its own government, rather than accept a Soviet regime; and that the destruction of the Polish resistance by the Nazis was of long-term benefit to Stalin, since it weakened future Polish opposition to Soviet occupation, and enabled the Soviets to say they &quot;liberated&quot; Warsaw.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soviets_and_AK&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Warszawa Powstanie 1944-09-10.jpg|thumb|left|Polish-controlled area after the fall of the Old Town, around 10 September]]

One way or the other, the presence of Soviet tanks in nearby [[WoÅomin]] 15 kilometers to the east of Warsaw had sealed the decision of the Home Army leaders to launch the uprising. However, as a result of the initial [[Battle of Radzymin (1944)|battle of Radzymin]] in the final days of July, these advance units of the Soviet 2nd Tank Army were pushed out of WoÅomin and back about 10&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref&gt;''The Soviet Conduct of Tactical Maneuver: Spearhead of the Offensive by David M Glantz''.

The Soviet units which reached the outskirts of Warsaw in the final days of July 1944 had advanced from the [[1st Belorussian Front]] in Western Ukraine as part of the [[Lublin-Brest Offensive Operation]], between the [[Lvov-Sandomierz Operation]] on its left and [[Operation Bagration]] on its right.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt; These two flanking operations were colossal defeats for the German army and completely destroyed a large number of German formations.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt; As a consequence, the Germans at this time were desperately trying to put together a new force to hold the line of the Vistula, the last major river barrier between the Red Army and Germany proper, rushing in units in various stages of readiness from all over Europe. These included many infantry units of poor quality,&lt;ref name=&quot;DWS&quot;/&gt; and 4â5 high quality Panzer Divisions in the 39th Panzer Corps and 4th SS Panzer Corps&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt; pulled from their refits.&lt;ref name=&quot;DWS&quot;/&gt;

Other possible explanations for Soviet conduct are possible. The Red Army geared for a major thrust into the Balkans through Romania in mid-August and a large proportion of Soviet resources was sent in that direction, while the offensive in Poland was put on hold.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 320.&lt;/ref&gt; Stalin had made a strategic decision to concentrate on occupying Eastern Europe, rather than on making a thrust toward Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of Warsaw was not essential for the Soviets, as they had already seized a series of convenient bridgeheads to the south of Warsaw, and were concentrating on defending them against vigorous German counterattacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt; Finally, the Soviet High Command may not have developed a coherent or appropriate strategy with regard to Warsaw because they were badly misinformed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 418.&lt;/ref&gt; Propaganda from the [[Polish Committee of National Liberation]] minimized the strength of the Home Army and portrayed them as Nazi sympathizers.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 440â441.&lt;/ref&gt; Information submitted to Stalin by intelligence operatives or gathered from the frontline was often inaccurate or omitted key details.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Davies, pp. 154â155, 388â389.&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly because the operatives were unable, due to the harsh political climate, to express opinions or report facts honestly, so they &quot;deliberately resorted to writing nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[David Glantz]] (military historian and a retired US Army colonel, as well as a member of the Russian Federationâs Academy of Natural Sciences), the Red Army was simply unable to extend effective support to the uprising, which began too early, regardless of Stalin's political intentions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt;  German military capabilities in Augustâearly September were sufficient to halt any Soviet assistance to the Poles in Warsaw, were it intended.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt; In addition, Glantz argued that Warsaw would be a costly city to clear it of Germans and an unsuitable location as a start point for subsequent Red Army offensives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glantz&quot;/&gt;

By the first week of September both German and Polish commanders realized that the Soviet army was unlikely to act to break the stalemate. The Germans reasoned that a prolonged insurgency would damage their ability to hold Warsaw as the frontline; the Poles were concerned that continued resistance would result in further massive casualties. On 7 September, General Rohr proposed negotiations, which BÃ³r-Komorowski agreed to pursue the following day.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the 8, 9 and 10 September about 20,000 civilians were evacuated by agreement of both sides, and Rohr recognized the right of Home Army insurgents to be treated as combatants.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 332â334.&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles suspended talks on the 11th, as they received news that the Soviets were advancing slowly through Praga.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, the arrival of the 1st Polish army breathed new life into the resistance and the talks collapsed.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 358.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, by the morning of 27 September, the Germans had retaken MokotÃ³w.&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, p. 125 and Borowiec, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Talks restarted on 28 September.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt; In the evening of 30 September, Å»oliborz fell to the Germans.&lt;ref&gt;Borodziej, p. 126 and Borowiec, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; The Poles were being pushed back into fewer and fewer streets, and their situation was ever more desperate.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 401â402.&lt;/ref&gt; On the 30th, Hitler decorated von dem Bach, Dirlewanger and Reinefarth, while in London General Sosnkowski was dismissed as Polish commander-in-chief.

According to Soviet Marshal [[Georgy Zhukov]], who was by this time at the Vistula front, both he and Rokossovsky advised Stalin against an offensive because of heavy Soviet losses.&lt;ref&gt;''The Memoirs of Marshal Zhukov'' (London, 1971) pp.551â552, quoted in Davies, pp. 420â421.&lt;/ref&gt;

The capitulation order of the remaining Polish forces was finally signed on 2 October. All fighting ceased that evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--WUTIME says 18:00; Davies says 19:00--&gt; According to the agreement, the ''Wehrmacht'' promised to treat Home Army soldiers in accordance with the [[Geneva Convention]], and to treat the civilian population humanely.&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;

The next day the Germans began to disarm the Home Army soldiers. They later sent 15,000 of them to POW camps in various parts of Germany. Between 5,000 and 6,000 insurgents decided to blend into the civilian population hoping to continue the fight later. The entire civilian population of Warsaw was expelled from the city and sent to a transit camp ''Durchgangslager'' 121 in [[PruszkÃ³w]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaborski&quot;/&gt; Out of 350,000â550,000 civilians who passed through the camp, 90,000 were sent to labour camps in the Third Reich, 60,000 were shipped to death and concentration camps (including [[RavensbrÃ¼ck concentration camp|RavensbrÃ¼ck]], [[Auschwitz]], and [[Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp|Mauthausen]], among others), while the rest were transported to various locations in the [[General Government]] and released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Zaborski&quot;/&gt;

The Eastern Front remained static in the Vistula sector, with the Soviets making no attempt to push forward, until the [[Vistula-Oder Offensive]] began on 12 January 1945. Almost entirely destroyed, Warsaw was liberated from the Germans on 17 January 1945 by the Red Army and the [[First Polish Army (1944-1945)|1st Polish Army]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wutime&quot;/&gt;

The destruction of the Polish capital was planned before the start of World War II. On 20 June 1939 while [[Adolf Hitler]] was visiting an architectural bureau in [[WÃ¼rzburg]] am Main, his attention was captured by a project of a future German town â &quot;Neue deutsche Stadt Warschau&quot;. According to the [[Pabst Plan]] Warsaw was to be turned into a provincial German city. It was soon included as a part of the great [[germanization]] plan of the East; the genocidal [[Generalplan Ost]]. The failure of the Warsaw Uprising provided an opportunity for Hitler to begin the transformation.&lt;ref&gt;Niels Gutschow, Barbarta Klain: Vernichtung und Utopie. Stadtplanung Warschau 1939â1945, Hamburg 1994, ISBN 3-88506-223-2&lt;/ref&gt;

After the remaining population had been expelled, the Germans continued the destruction of the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt; Special groups of German engineers were dispatched to burn and demolish the remaining buildings. According to German plans, after the war Warsaw was to be turned into nothing more than a military transit station,&lt;ref name=&quot;WiTo&quot;/&gt; or even an [[artificial lake]]&lt;ref&gt;Peter K.

By January 1945 85% of the buildings were destroyed: 25% as a result of the Uprising, 35% as a result of systematic German actions after the uprising, and the rest as a result of the earlier [[Warsaw Ghetto Uprising]], and the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|September 1939 campaign]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt;
Material losses are estimated at 10,455 buildings, 923 historical buildings (94%), 25 churches, 14 libraries including the [[Polish National Library|National Library]], 81 primary schools, 64 high schools, [[University of Warsaw]] and [[Warsaw University of Technology]], and most of the historical monuments.&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt; Almost a million inhabitants lost all of their possessions.&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt; The exact amount of losses of private and public property as well as pieces of art, monuments of science and culture is unknown but considered enormous. Studies done in the late 1940s estimated total damage at about US$30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;Vanessa Gera ''Warsaw bloodbath still stirs emotions'', [[Chicago Sun-Times]], 1 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, [[President of Warsaw]] [[Lech KaczyÅski]], later [[President of Poland]], established a historical commission to estimate material losses that were inflicted upon the city by German authorities. The commission estimated the losses as at least US$31.5 billion at 2004 values.&lt;ref name=&quot;Warszawa szacuje straty wojenne&quot;/&gt; Those estimates were later raised to US$45 billion 2004 US dollars and in 2005, to $54.6 billion.&lt;ref&gt;See the following pages on the official site of Warsaw: [http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/ratusz/Raport_o_stratach_wojennych_Warszawy.pdf Raport o stratach wojennych Warszawy LISTOPAD 2004], [http://www.warszawa.um.gov.pl/v_syrenka/new/?dzial=aktualnosci&amp;ak_id=4969&amp;kat=3 Straty Warszawy w albumie] and [http://www.um.warszawa.pl/v_syrenka/new/index.php?dzial=aktualnosci&amp;strona=aktualnosci_archiwum&amp;poczatek=2004-11&amp;ak_id=1764&amp;kat=3 Straty wojenne Warszawy]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casualties===
The exact number of casualties on both sides is unknown. Estimates of casualties fall into roughly similar ranges. Polish civilian deaths are estimated at between 150,000 and 200,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;AB2&quot;/&gt; Both Polish and German military personnel losses are estimated separately at under 20,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;wufaq&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KirchCasualties&quot;/&gt;

{{Main|Cultural representations of the Warsaw Uprising}}
[[File:Warszawa Powstaniec.png|thumb|upright|''MaÅy Powstaniec'' (The Little Insurgent), raised just outside Warsaw's medieval city walls in 1981, commemorates the [[child soldier]]s that fought in the Warsaw Uprising.]]

{{quote|&quot;I would like to protest against mean and cowardly attitude of the British press towards the uprising in Warsaw [...]. In general an impression was created, that the Poles deserve to be beaten, even though they were doing exactly all of this, to which allies broadcasting stations were calling them for several years [â¦]. This is my message for leftist journalists and for intelligence â in general. Remember, that one always pays for his dishonesty and cowardice. Donât even think, that for years on end you will be shoes licking servants of the Soviet regime, and then suddenly you will return to the spiritual decency.&quot; â [[George Orwell]], 1 September 1944&lt;ref&gt;Orwell in Tribune: âAs I Pleaseâ and Other Writings 1943â7 by George Orwell (Compiled and edited by Paul Anderson) Politicos, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Due in part to the lack of Soviet cooperation the Warsaw Uprising and Operation Tempest failed in their primary goal: to free part of the Polish territories so that a government loyal to the Polish government-in-exile could be established there instead of a Soviet backed government. There is no consensus among historians as to whether that was ever possible, or whether those operations had any other lasting effect.

Most soldiers of the Home Army (including those who took part in the Warsaw Uprising) were persecuted after the war: captured by the [[NKVD]] or [[UrzÄd BezpieczeÅstwa|UB]] political police. They were interrogated and imprisoned on various charges like for example - &quot;fascism&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paczkowski&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MichaÅ ZajÄc, ''[http://www.polskieradio.pl/zagranica/dokument.aspx?iid=39960 Warsaw Uprising: 5 pm, 1 August 1944]'', Retrieved on 4 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them were sent to [[Gulag]]s, executed or &quot;disappeared&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paczkowski&quot;/&gt;  Between 1944 and 1956, all of the former members of [[Batalion ZoÅka]] were incarcerated in Soviet prisons.&lt;ref&gt;Å»oÅnierze Batalionu Armii Krajowej &quot;ZoÅka&quot; represjonowani w latach 1944â1956 &quot;, Instytut PamiÄci Narodowej,  Warszawa 2008, ISBN 978-83-60464-92-2&lt;/ref&gt; In March 1945 [[staged trial]] of 16 leaders of the [[Polish Underground State]] held by the [[Soviet Union]] took place in [[Moscow]] - ([[Trial of the Sixteen]]).&lt;ref&gt;Prazmowska, A.

(1946) ''Poland, Russia and Great Britain 1941-1945'' Hollis &amp; Carter  Pages 467-468&lt;/ref&gt;Many insurgents, captured by the Germans and sent to POW camps in Germany, were later liberated by British, American and Polish forces and remained in the West. Among those were the leaders of the uprising: [[Tadeusz BÃ³r-Komorowski]] and [[Antoni ChruÅciel]].

[[File:Uprising Grob.png|thumb|left|125px|Single grave of a victim of the fighting, intentionally left in place on a Warsaw street]]

The facts of the Warsaw Uprising were inconvenient to Stalin, and were twisted by propaganda of the [[People's Republic of Poland]], which stressed the failings of the Home Army and the Polish government-in-exile, and forbade all criticism of the Red Army or the political goals of Soviet strategy.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawicki&quot;/&gt; In the immediate post-war period, the very name of the Home Army was censored, and most films and novels covering the 1944 Uprising were either banned or modified so that the name of the Home Army did not appear.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawicki&quot;/&gt; From the 1950s on, Polish propaganda depicted the soldiers of the Uprising as brave, but the officers as treacherous, reactionary and characterized by disregard of the losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sawicki&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 521â522.&lt;/ref&gt; The first publications on the topic taken seriously in the West were not issued until the late 1980s. In Warsaw no monument to the Home Army was built until 1989. Instead, efforts of the Soviet-backed [[Armia Ludowa|People's Army]] were glorified and exaggerated.
[[File:Warsaw wwII.jpg|thumb|Warsaw monument to insurgents]]
By contrast, in the West the story of the Polish fight for Warsaw was told as a tale of valiant heroes fighting against a cruel and ruthless enemy. It was suggested that Stalin benefited from Soviet non-involvement, as opposition to eventual Russian control of Poland was effectively eliminated when the Nazis destroyed the partisans.&lt;ref&gt;[[Mark Arnold-Forster|Arnold-Forster, Mark]] (1973; repr. 1983). ''[[The World at War]]''. London: Collins/Thames Television repr. Thames Methuen. ISBN 0-423-00680-0. pp. 179â180.&lt;/ref&gt; The belief that the Uprising failed because of deliberate procrastination by the Soviet Union contributed to anti-Soviet sentiment in Poland. Memories of the Uprising helped to inspire the Polish labour movement [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], which led a peaceful opposition movement against the Communist government during the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, pp. 601â602.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 1990s, historical analysis of the events remained superficial because of official censorship and lack of academic interest.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Research into the Warsaw Uprising was boosted by the [[fall of communism]] in 1989, due to the abolition of censorship and increased access to state archives. As of 2004, however, access to some material in British, Polish and ex-Soviet archives was still restricted.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. xi.&lt;/ref&gt; Further complicating the matter is the British claim that the records of the Polish government-in-exile were destroyed,&lt;ref&gt;Davies, p. 528.&lt;/ref&gt; and material not transferred to British authorities after the war was burnt by the Poles in London in July 1945.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Alfred Peszke|Peszke, Michael Alfred]] (October 2006). &quot;An Introduction to English-Language Literature on the Polish Armed Forces in World War II&quot;.

In Poland, 1 August is now a celebrated anniversary. On 1 August 1994, Poland held a ceremony commemorating the 50th anniversary of the Uprising to which both the German and Russian presidents were invited.&lt;ref name=&quot;sb&quot;/&gt; Though the German President [[Roman Herzog]] attended, the Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] declined the invitation; other notable guests included the U.S. Vice President [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref name=sb/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wvoice&quot;/&gt; Herzog, on behalf of Germany, was the first German statesman to apologize for German atrocities committed against the Polish nation during the Uprising.&lt;ref name=wvoice/&gt; During the 60th anniversary of the Uprising in 2004, official delegations included: German Chancellor [[Gerhard SchrÃ¶der]], UK deputy Prime Minister [[John Prescott]] and US Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]]; [[Pope John Paul II]] sent a letter to the mayor of Warsaw, [[Lech KaczyÅski]] on this occasion.&lt;ref name=&quot;60an&quot;/&gt; Russia once again did not send a representative.&lt;ref name=60an/&gt; A day before, 31 July 2004, the [[Warsaw Uprising Museum]] opened in Warsaw.&lt;ref name=60an/&gt;

The left-wing British writer George Orwell in The Tribune criticized the apathy of Western Allies during Warsaw Uprising &quot;Do remember that dishonesty and cowardice always have to be paid for. Do not imagine that for years on end you can make yourself the boot-licking propagandist of the Soviet regime, or any other regime, and then suddenly return to honesty and reason. Once a whore, always a whore.&quot;
