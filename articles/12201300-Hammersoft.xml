'''University of California, Santa Barbara Gauchos men's soccer''' is an amateur, [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] [[college soccer]] team composed of students attending the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].  They are most famous for winning the [[2006 Division I Men's College Cup|2006 NCAA Championship]].  Like most of the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]], the men's soccer team competes in the [[Big West Conference]].  The Gauchos play their home matches at [[Harder Stadium]] on the campus of the University of California, Santa Barbara.

==History==
===Humble beginnings===
UC Santa Barbara fielded its first team in 1966, but it wasn't until 1983 until they first competed in the Big West Conference.  The Gauchos had mixed success, mixing good seasons (1983, 1988) with bad seasons (1991, 1992), yet never found prolonged success or failure.

The Big West Conference stopped sponsoring soccer in 1991, but re-instituted it in 2001.  Over this period, UCSB competed in a regional conference called the [[Mountain Pacific Sports Federation|MPSF]].  The return of soccer to the Big West Conference marked the beginning of the Gauchos' greatest success, starting from the very first season.  The Gauchos won the 2001 Big West Conference championship, but missed out on a trip to the NCAA Tournament since the Big West did not have an automatic bid.

Since 2001, the UCSB has won 5 Big West championships (2001, 02, 04, 06, 07) and have appeared in the NCAA Tournament in every year since 2002.

===2004 NCAA Championships===
The Gauchos burst on to the national scene in 2004 during their run at the [[2004 Division I Men's College Cup|2004 NCAA Championship]].  The showing in this tournament established UC Santa Barbara as a force in college soccer, with UCSB marching all the way to the finals before losing out on penalites to [[Indiana Hoosiers|Indiana]].

===2006 NCAA Championships===
[[File:UCSB men's soccer team at the White House 2007-06-18.jpg|left|thumb|200px|2006 [[White House]] visit with [[George W. Bush]].]]

The crowning achievement of the men's soccer program took place in 2006, where UCSB won the [[2006 Division I Men's College Cup|NCAA Division I Championship]] in a 2-1 decision over [[UCLA Bruins|UCLA]].  It marked the program's first championship and only the university's second athletics championship (1979 Men's Water Polo).

At one point during the season, UCSB's record stood at 7-6 with dim prospects for postseason glory.  However, a 5-1 stretch to close out the regular season raised morale.  The Gauchos made the NCAA Tournament as an unseeded team.  During their championship run, the unseeded Gauchos defeated [[San Diego State Aztecs|San Diego State]] at home, then #1 ranked/#3 seeded [[SMU Mustangs|SMU]] followed by [[Old Dominion University|Old Dominion]] on the road, and finally [[Northwestern Wildcats|Northwesterm]] before an NCAA season high 8,784 people at [[Harder Stadium]] in Santa Barbara.  This propelled the Gauchos into the Final Four and earned them a trip to the College Cup held at [[Hermann Stadium]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

UCSB needed extra time to defeat #2 seed [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons|Wake Forest]] 0-0 (4-3 on penalties) in their first match of the College Cup.  The final was a matchup between Southern California teams as UCLA advanced on a 4-0 win over [[Virginia Cavaliers|Virginia]].  The #8 ranked/#8 seeded Bruins served as the final team to fall to the Gauchos by a score of 2-1 to complete UCSB's magical season.

==Cal Poly San Luis Obispo Rivalry==

A rivalry between UC Santa Barbara and [[Cal Poly Mustangs men's soccer|Cal Poly San Luis Obispo]] (Cal Poly SLO) has always existed since Cal Poly SLO joined [[NCAA]] Division I, but this rivalry has escalated in recent years.  The two schools are both located on the [[Central Coast of California|Central Coast]] in [[California]] are just a mere 100 miles away from each other.  The two teams play at least twice a year in [[Big West]] Conference play, with one home game each.  When these two teams meet, attendance skyrockets setting records on the year for the most fans attending a regular season game.  In 2008, Cal Poly SLO hosted a sellout crowd of 11,075 fans that watched UCSB squeak by in overtime with a 1-0 win.  This was the 5th highest attendance for a regular season game in NCAA history, and the second highest attendance for a regular season game at a college stadium.  The largest attendance for a regular season game in over 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gopoly.com/index.php?p=sports&amp;tab=news&amp;id=29911&amp;article_id=66721&lt;/ref&gt;
