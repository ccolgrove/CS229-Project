'''''Yellow Canary''''' is a 1943 [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British]] [[drama film]] starring [[Anna Neagle]], [[Richard Greene]] and [[Albert Lieven]]. Neagle plays a British Nazi sympathiser who travels to [[City of Halifax|Halifax, Canada]] trailed by spies from both sides during the [[World War II|Second World War]].

==Plot==
Sally Maitland boards a ship bound from England for Canada during wartime. Two of the passengers seek her acquaintance, despite her well-known longtime admiration for [[Nazi Germany]], Jim Garrick and Polish officer Jan Orlock. It soon becomes common knowledge that Jim is in British intelligence. Jan rebuffs his advances, but welcomes Jan's attention. 

The ship is stopped in mid-ocean by a [[U-boat]], and a boarding party takes Jim prisoner. To the puzzlement of the ship's captain, the submarine allows him to continue on his way. It also turns out that the Germans have captured an imposter when Jim emerges from hiding.

When they reach the port of [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], Jan introduces Sally to his mother, an invalid. The two women disagree over their opinions of the Nazis. Later, when Sally tries to break off their relationship, Jan reveals that he is working for the Nazis. 

He recruits her into his spy ring on the night of the their greatest exploit. To Sally's surprise, the leader of the ring turns out to be Madame Orlock, who is not actually Jan's mother. She reveals that a ship of an incoming convoy has been secretly replaced by another filled with explosives. When the convoy reaches Halifax, the resulting explosion will wreck the vital port, inspired by the [[Halifax Explosion|devastating accident]] of the [[World War I|First World War]].

Madame Orlock orders Sally to telephone Jim and tell him that a sabotage attempt will be made on the ''Queen Mary'', scheduled to sail later that night, and that all available agents should be immediately sent to stop it. Sally shows her true colours when she divulges the actual plot. Canadian bombers are dispatched to blow up the ship. Meanwhile, Jan shoots Sally before Jim can rescue her; fortunately the bullet is stopped by a cigarette case given to her earlier by Jan. She and Jim get married.

==Production==
Although never identified as [[Unity Mitford]], the central character played by Dame Anna Neagle has some obvious similarities to the pro-Nazi British dilettante who had a great deal of notoriety in pre-war times. Neagle and director/producer Wilcox had collaborated on a number of previous film projects and made their professional relationship a personal one as well when they married on 9 August 1943.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdbbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0623554/bio &quot;Anna Neagle Biography.&quot;] ''IMDb''.

In production during 1943, while the United Kingdom was still fearful of  Nazi spies, the film was obviously made as wartime propaganda, with the aim not only of keeping up morale but also of warning the British public to be on their guard. &lt;ref name=&quot;britishpictures&quot;/&gt;

''The Yellow Canary'' co-stars Richard Greene and Margaret Rutherford went on to further success in other films. Rutherford was especially adept at scene-stealing in the film.&lt;ref name=&quot;britishpictures&quot;&gt;Absalom, David.

Retrieved: 5 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;Greene was in the armed forces at this time and had interrupted his successful acting career to serve in the [[World War II|Second World War]] in the [[27th Lancers]], where he distinguished himself. After three months, he went to [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst|Sandhurst]] and was commissioned. He was promoted to Captain in the 27th Lancers in May 1944.  He was relieved from duty in 1942 to appear in the British [[propaganda film]]s ''Flying Fortress'' and ''Unpublished Story''. In 1943, he appeared in ''The Yellow Canary'' while on furlough.&lt;ref&gt;Parish and  Leonard 1976, p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Van Neste, Dan.

Although set aboard a ship in the early scenes, the majority of the principal photography took place at the massive lots at [[Denham Film Studios]] (D&amp;P Studios), located near the village of [[Denham, Buckinghamshire|Denham]], [[Buckinghamshire]]. All of the location sequences of Halifax were strictly &quot;B&quot; roll, but did provide an realistic, &quot;atmospheric&quot; look at wartime conditions.  &lt;ref name=&quot;britishpictures&quot;/&gt;
