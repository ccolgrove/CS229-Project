A bloody clash occurred at the [[Durst Ranch]] in [[Wheatland, California]] on August 3, 1913, climaxing growing tensions brought about by the difficult conditions farm laborers at the ranch endured. The [[riot]] resulted in four deaths and many injuries. It focused public opinion for the first time on the plight of California's [[agricultural]] laborers, and resulted in new state [[legislation]] to regulate labor camp conditions. A new State Commission on [[Immigration]] and Housing was created to help improve working conditions. The Wheatland Hop Riot was also the first major farm labor confrontation in California and a harbinger of decades of attempts to organize or control agricultural labor.

Durst advertised for 3000 hop pickers and other seasonal agricultural workers, though he only needed half that number -- in order to drive wages down. Of a $1.50/ day wage, $0.78 - $1.00 was withheld from the workers' pay. If a worker didn't stay till the end of the season, Durst kept that withheld money. Durst then had the workers harassed, cheated, and abused to try to make them leave before the end of the season. The strikers demanded water twice a day, separate bathrooms for men and women, and higher pay. During a speech by Richard &quot;Blackie&quot; Ford, the [[Yuba County]] sheriff and a group of over 100 vigilantes fired into the crowd of workers, causing the riot. Two workers, a deputy, and the district attorney were killed. The National Guard was ordered into the area and 100 workers arrested.&lt;ref&gt;AcuÃ±a, Rodolfo.
