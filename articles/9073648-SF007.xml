'''Reference software''' is software which emulates and expands upon print reference forms including the [[dictionary]], [[translation dictionary]], [[encyclopedia]], [[thesaurus]], and [[atlas]]. Like print references, reference software can either be general or specific to a domain, and often includes [[map]]s and [[illustration]]s, as well as [[bibliography]] and [[statistics]]. Reference software may include [[multimedia]] content including animations, audio, and video, which further illustrate a concept. Well designed reference software improves upon the navigability of print references, through the use of search functionality and [[hyperlink]]s.

==Origins and development==
Many [[dictionaries]] and [[encyclopedias]] rushed into [[CD-ROM]] editions soon after the widespread introduction of the [[CD-ROM]] to home computers. A second major development occurred as the internet also became widely available in homes, with reference works becoming available online as well. The conversion of previously print-only reference materials to electronic format marked a major change to the marketing and accessibility of such works. A striking case study is that of the venerable [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]], which was previously only available at prices of USD 1500 and higher, restricting it to the better libraries and the wealthy. Today, the [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]] and [[World Book Encyclopedia]] retail in electronic format for around 50 USD, with cheaper [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] versions sometimes bundled with new computers. Such dramatic changes brought conventionally restricted knowledge repositories to the fingertips of an almost universal audience in a period of less than 11 years. The opportunities brought by new media enticed new competitors into the reference software market. One of the earliest and most well-known was Microsoft [[Encarta]], first introduced on CD-ROM and then also moving online along with other major reference works. In the dictionaries market, one of the more prolific brands was [[Merriam-Webster]], which released CD-ROM and then online versions of English dictionaries, [[thesauri]] and foreign language dictionaries. Since 2010, reference materials have begun to appear as apps on [[Smartphone]]s. In the field of [[English as a foreign or second language]], this is seen as an interesting pedagogical development and is the subject of much discussion[http://ltsig.org.uk/component/content/article/3-newsflash/203-call-review-spring-2011.html], as language learners increasingly abandon print dictionaries for online editions and apps like the one produced by [[Macmillan Education]][http://www.macmillandictionary.com/apps/]. A long list of online dictionaries is maintained under &quot;[[dictionary|dictionaries]]&quot;. [[Wikipedia]] and its offspins (such as [[Wiktionary]]) marked a new departure in educational reference software. Previous encyclopedias and dictionaries had compiled their contents on the basis of invited and closed teams of specialists. The [[Wiki]] concept allowed anyone and everyone to join in creating and editing an online set of reference works.
