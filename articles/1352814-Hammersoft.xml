In July 2008, the [[United States Figure Skating Association]] and ''Skating'' Magazine announced Weir as the winner of the ''2008 Reader's Choice Award for Skater of the Year'', an annual trophy voted upon by skating fans and awarded to the American skater or skating team whose achievements were of the highest merit in the previous season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnny Weir Wins SKATING Magazine 2008 Reader's Choice Skater of the Year Award |url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=41669 |publisher=US Figure Skating|date=24 July 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010,Weir won this award again&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfsa.org/Story.asp?id=44811&amp;type=media Johnny Weir Wins Skating Magazine 2010 Readers' Choice Skater of the Year Award]usfsa.org, 07/21/10&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2010 Olympics two Canadian broadcasters commented on Weir's flamboyant demeanor, made derogatory comments of his sexuality, and questioned his gender.&lt;ref name=&quot;nydaily&quot;&gt;{{citation |title=Figure skater Johnny Weir lashes back at broadcasters who suggests he 'sets a bad example' |periodical=[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]] |first=Joe |last=Dziemianowicz |date=26 February 2010 |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/gossip/2010/02/26/2010-02-26_figure_skater_johnny_weir_lashes_back_at_broadcasters_who_suggested_he_sets_a_ba.html#ixzz0jA8r3kKR |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weir's sexual orientation was long the subject of media speculation; however, when asked about his sexuality, Weir often responded along the lines of, &quot;...it's not part of my sport and it's private.

In 2010 a [[Asteroid belt|main-belt asteroid]], discovered in 1995 by T. V.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
As a boy, Weir was a successful competitor as an [[equestrianism|equestrian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2001/122401.shtml |title=Weir Jumps from Show Rink to Ice Rink |publisher=[[Golden Skate]] |date=24 December 2001 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became interested in figure skating at the age of eleven while watching [[Oksana Baiul]] win her [[Figure skating at the 1994 Winter Olympics|1994 Olympic gold medal]]. He taught himself how to jump on roller skates in his basement. His parents eventually bought him a pair of used figure skates, and he practiced on a frozen cornfield behind his family home.&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/06/AR2006020601832_pf.html |first=Amy |last=Shipley |title=Icebreaker and His Obstacles |publisher=Washington Post |date=7 February 2006 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents then purchased group lessons for him at the [[University of Delaware]], where coach [[Priscilla Hill]] soon noticed his talent and took him on as a private student.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldenskate&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goldenskate.com/articles/2001/122401.shtml |title=Weir Jumps from Show Rink to Ice Rink |publisher=Golden Skate |date=24 December 2001|accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he began skating at the relatively late age of 12, Weir progressed quickly through the ranks. He performed an [[Axel jump]] in his first week on skates.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldenskate&quot;/&gt; His parents could not afford to support both his figure skating and his equestrian pursuits, so Weir gave up his pony, My Blue Shadow, and turned his focus completely to figure skating. He competed in [[pair skating]] with Jodi Rudden on the juvenile and intermediate levels, but gave it up to concentrate on single skating.&lt;ref name=&quot;goldenskate&quot;/&gt;

Weir's first major victory came in 2001 when, at the age of 16, he skated three clean programs at the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|World Junior Championships]] and won the gold medal ahead of fellow American [[Evan Lysacek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.icecalc.com/events/wjc2001/results/ |title=World Junior Figure Skating Championships 2001 |publisher=IceCalc|date= |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first time since 1987 that the U.S. had placed first and second on the World Junior podium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2001/03/02/sports/plus-figure-skating-us-men-finish-first-and-second.html |periodical=[[New York Times]] |date=2 May 2001 |title=US Men Finish First and Second |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Weir also placed sixth that year in his debut at the senior [[2001 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt;

At the [[2003 United States Figure Skating Championships|2003 U.S. Championships]], he literally hit the wall during his long program. He restarted the program, but immediately injured his knee on a failed triple axel landing. This time he was too injured to restart, so he withdrew from the competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Vachon |first=Dana |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2005/03/16/weir/index.html |title=Iceboy Cometh |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |date=16 March 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after this competition, he switched club affiliation from the [[University of Delaware FSC]] to the [[Skating Club of New York]], which he still represents.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |periodical=[[Skating Club of New York]] |url=http://www.thescny.org/content.php?id=39 |title=History|accessdate=5 April 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003â2004 season===
[[File:Johnny Weir 2004.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Weir competing at the [[2004 NHK Trophy]]]]
The 2003â2004 season was the turning point for Weir. He qualified for the U.S. Nationals by winning his regional and sectional championships. He received the first 6.0 of his career during his long program at [[2004 United States Figure Skating Championships|2004 U.S. Championships]], winning the gold over [[Michael Weiss (figure skater)|Michael Weiss]] and [[Matthew Savoie]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnny Weir Collects a Perfect 6.0 and Claims Gold |url=http://www.usfsa.org/event_story.asp?id=21095 |publisher=US Figure Skating|date=10 January 2004 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then competed at the [[2004 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]] and placed fifth.&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt;

===2004â2005 season===
In the 2004â2005 season Weir won his first two [[ISU Grand Prix of Figure Skating|Grand Prix]] titles. He won the first at the [[2004 NHK Trophy]] in Japan and the second at [[2004 TrophÃ©e Eric Bompard]] in France.&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt; Only two Grand Prix events per season can count toward a skater's point totals under [[International Skating Union|ISU]] rules,&lt;ref name=&quot;isu.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportcentric.com/vsite/vfile/page/fileurl/0,11040,4844-191593-208816-140518-0-file,00.pdf |title=International Skating Union Special Regulations &amp; Technical Rules |publisher=sportcentric|accessdate=27 January 2010}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Weir also skated at the [[2004 Cup of Russia]] for no official points and took the silver medal behind reigning world champion [[Evgeni Plushenko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2004-11-27-cup-of-russia_x.htm |title=Plushenko, Slutskaya shine at Cup of Russia |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=27 November 2004 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2005 United States Figure Skating Championships|2005 U.S. Championships]], he earned five 6.0's for presentation with his free skate to ''Otonal'' and successfully defended his national title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Peterson |first=Anne M. |title=Weir Defends Men's Skating Title at U.S. Nationals |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2005-01-15-figure-skating_x.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=15 January 2005|accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He went on to compete at the [[2005 World Figure Skating Championships|2005 World Championships]] with a landing foot injury and placed fourth.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.usoc.org/11506_31483.htm |periodical=Official Site of the U.S. Olympic Team |date=17 March 2005 |title=Evan Lysacek Wins Bronze at Worlds}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005â2006 season===
The 2005â2006 Olympic season proved difficult for Weir. He came in seventh at [[2005 Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]] after spraining his ankle on a jump landing at the start of the free skate and struggling through the rest of the program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czisny has Golden Performance at Skate Canada |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2005-10-29-skate-canada-womens_x.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=30 October 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and third at [[2005 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt;

In December 2005 he won the men's competition at the 2005 Marshall's Figure Skating Challenge, in which results were determined live by call-in votes and texts from viewers, in the final round over [[Michael Weiss (figure skater)|Michael Weiss]] with 64% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.articleset.com/Music-and-Movies_articles_en_900-Number-and-Text-Message-Voting-Decide-Figure-Skating-Challenge.htm |title=900 Number and Text Message Voting Decide Figure Skating Challenge |publisher=Articleset.com |date=27 December 2005 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2006 United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Championships]], he won his third consecutive title and, as the national champion, was automatically named to the U.S. Olympics and World teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stlouis2006.usfigureskating.org/News/RecapNews/0114seniormenfree.aspx |title=Three Newcomers Head to Olympic Winter Games in the Men's Event |date=14 January 2006 |publisher=US Figure Skating|work=Stae Farm U.S. Figure Skating Championships 2006|accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Figure skating at the 2006 Winter Olympics|2006 Winter Olympics]], Weir skated a personal best short program and was in second place behind [[Evgeni Plushenko]] in that segment. However, Weir omitted some of his planned jumps in the free skate, and finished off of the podium in fifth place.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Weir to Defend Title |date=26 January 2007 |url=http://www.usolympicteam.com/11506_50992.htm |periodical=Official Site of the U.S. Olympic Team}}{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2006 World Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Championships]], Weir finished seventh, fighting a nagging back injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Figure Skating, Updated |publisher=USOC PressBox|date=23 June 2006 |url=http://www.usocpressbox.org/usoc/pressbox.nsf/d25622c850c2bda387256540007b1d12/7d2db2a2d3113c998525713b00120001?OpenDocument |accessdate=18 January 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2006â2007 season===
Weir began the 2006â2007 competitive season at [[2006 Skate Canada International|Skate Canada]], where he placed third, then went on to [[2006 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]] and won the silver medal, his third consecutive medal at that event.&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt; He placed second at the 2006 Marshall's Figure Skating Challenge with his performance to [[Le Cygne (Saint-SaÃ«ns)|The Swan]], an exhibition version of his Olympic program, and Weir's signature piece.&lt;ref&gt;Commentary from the 2006 Marshall's Figure Skating Challenge, broadcast on ABC, December 11, 2006, 1â3 pm EST at Agganis Arena at Boston University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Weir withdrew from the [[2006â2007 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2006â2007 Grand Prix Final]] before the free skate due to a hip injury he sustained in a freak fall during the short program.&lt;ref name=&quot;withdraws&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=37024 |title=Johnny Weir Withdraws from Grand Prix Final Due to Injury |publisher=US Figure Skating|date=16 December 2006 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]], Weir was in second place after the short program, less than a point behind Evan Lysacek. In the free program, he was unable to complete his triple axel combination, fell on a triple loop and doubled several of his planned combinations. He attempted a quadruple toe loop but it was heavily two-footed on the landing. Weir lost his national title and finished in third place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Figure skater Lysacek hits career pinnacle at nationals |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/winter/2007-01-28-us-figures-mens-final_x.htm |publisher=[[USA Today]] |date=28 January 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[2007 World Figure Skating Championships|2007 World Championships]], Weir placed eighth.&lt;ref name=&quot;usfigureskating.org&quot;/&gt;

After the disappointments of the 2006â2007 season, Weir made the decision to shake up his training regimen by leaving the only coach he had ever had, [[Priscilla Hill]], moving out of his family home and moving on his own to [[New Jersey]] to train with [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] coach [[Galina Zmievskaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifsmagazine.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=431&amp;pid=612&amp;st=0&amp; |title=New Coach For Johnny Weir: Three-Time U.S. Men's Champion to Train With Galina Zmievskaya |publisher=International Figure Skating|date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently had a great start to his 2007â2008 season at the [[2007 Cup of China|Cup of China]] where he skated two clean and strong programs, achieving new personal best scores for both his free skate and overall score and winning the gold medal over fellow American [[Evan Lysacek]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnny Weir Claims His First Cup of China Grand Prix Title |publisher=International Figure Skating|date=10 November 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2010 |url=http://www.ifsmagazine.com/forum/index.php?s=ee8b41d92b1172d34995b9a74aaccc91&amp;showtopic=480&amp;pid=693&amp;st=0&amp;#entry693}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to [[2007 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]] and took the gold medal there, as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;/&gt; The two first place finishes secured him a spot at the [[2007â2008 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2007â2008 Grand Prix Final]], where Weir competed with a recurring injury in his landing foot and stumbled in both his short and long programs but still managed to place 4th overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot; /&gt;

At the [[2008 United States Figure Skating Championships|2008 U.S. Championships]], Weir won the short program over [[Evan Lysacek]] by 1.35 points but Lysacek won the long program by exactly the same amount, resulting in a tie. Weir completed a slightly two-footed quadruple toe loop in his long program and scored more points on his jumps and in the program components than Lysacek but Lysacek scored more points for his spins and footwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=2008 United States Figure Skating Championships |format=PDF |url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/content/events/200708/uschamps/protocols/seniormen-protocols.pdf |accessdate=25 March 2010|publisher=US Figure Skating}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[International Skating Union|ISU]] rules, in the event of a tie the winner of the long program is awarded the gold medal,&lt;ref name=&quot;isu.org&quot;/&gt; so Weir received the silver.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifsmagazine.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=519&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/28/sports/othersports/28skate.html | work=The New York Times | first=Pat | last=Borzi | title=Tie Breaker Allows Lysacek to Defend Title | date=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/writers/em_swift/01/27/mens.skating/ | work=CNN | title=SI.com - Fit to be tied - Jan 27, 2008 | date=27 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/olympics/2008-01-27-skating-men-lysacek_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Gary | last=Mihoces | title=Tiebreaker brings Lysacek national title over rival Weir | date=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/22869171/&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[2008 World Figure Skating Championships|2008 World Championships]], the United States had failed to medal at all in every other discipline when the men took the ice last. Weir skated a brilliant short program and received a career-best score that put him in second place. In the free program, he skated steadily but tentatively, eliminating the second jump from his first planned combination and doubling a planned triple jump on another combination. However, the program was strong enough for Weir to win his first World medal â a bronze â and kept the United States from being shut out of the medals at a World Championship for the first time since 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nancy |last=Armour |date=23 March 2008 |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/news?slug=ap-worldchampionships&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=Worlds 2008: Weir salvages US medal hopes, titles to Japan's Asada and Canada's Buttle |publisher=Yahoo! Sports |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008â2009 season===
Weir began the 2008â2009 season by winning the silver medal at [[2008 Skate America|Skate America]] in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kozuka Leapfrogs Americans for Gold Medal |date=26 October 2008 |url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081026&amp;content_id=54247&amp;vkey=ice_news |publisher=Icenetwork.com |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then went on to the [[2008 NHK Trophy|NHK Trophy]] in late November, where he competed while suffering from a severe cold but still managed to win his second silver medal of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Icenetwork.com |date=30 November 2008 |url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081130&amp;content_id=56830&amp;vkey=ice_news |title=Oda continues comeback with NHK gold medal |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two finishes qualified him for the [[2008-2009 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2008-2009 Grand Prix Final]], where he won the bronze medal in December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Abbott wins men's Grand Prix Final |url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20081213&amp;content_id=57556&amp;vkey=ice_news |publisher=Icenetwork.com |date=13 December 2008 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 2008 [[Christmas]] holiday Weir traveled to [[South Korea]] to perform in a charity skating show. While there, he contracted a severe stomach virus that landed him in the hospital and caused him to lose eight pounds in a single day. He was unable to regain all of the weight or train at full capacity before the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]] in January 2009, where he singled the planned triple axel in both his short and long programs and also fell on the triple lutz in the long, resulting in a fifth-place finish. It was the first time since 2003 that he had been off the podium at Nationals.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/28844398/ns/sports-olympic_sports/ |date=25 January 2009 |title=Flu Knocks Weir Flat at National Championships |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was subsequently not named to the U.S. team for the [[2009 World Figure Skating Championships|World Championships]].

===2009â2010 season===
In preparation for the 2009â2010 season Weir went to top skating choreographer [[David Wilson (figure skater)|David Wilson]] to create his competitive programs. On September 26, 2009, he debuted his short program, which was set to music by RaÃºl di Blasio, at a benefit to commemorate [[September 11 attacks|9/11]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnny Weir debuts new short program for 2009â2010 season |publisher=Lifeskate|date=28 September 2009 |url=http://www.lifeskate.com/skate/2009/09/johnny-weir-short-program-stars-stripes-skates-video.html |accessdate=25 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2009 Grand Prix season Weir finished a disappointing fourth at [[2009 Cup of Russia|Cup of Russia]] after doubling several of the triple jumps in both his short and long programs, but two weeks later rallied to win silver at the [[2009 NHK Trophy|NHK Trophy]], while suffering from a cold and sinus infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091107&amp;content_id=7635316&amp;vkey=ice_pressrelease |title=Joubert, Ando top podiums at NHK Trophy |publisher=Icenetwork.com |date=7 November 2009 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This qualified Weir for the [[2009â2010 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2009-2010 Grand Prix Final]] in Tokyo, Japan, where he won the bronze medal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lysacek outpaces field for gold in Tokyo |publisher=Icenetwork.com |date=5 December 2009 |accessdate=25 March 2010 |url=http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20091205&amp;content_id=7761390&amp;vkey=ice_news}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weir won the bronze medal at the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Championships]] in Spokane, Washington and was subsequently named to the U.S. team for the Olympics. He became the center of an animal rights controversy by wearing fox fur on his skating costume at that event. He received protests from the animal rights groups [[Friends of Animals]] and [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Quarryville's Weir draws protest from animal group |date=27 January 2010 |url=http://www.nbcolympics.com/wgal/news/newsid=401760.html |work=NBCOlympics.com |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=29 January 2010 |date=28 January 2010 |url=http://sports.yahoo.com/olympics/vancouver/figure_skating/news?slug=ap-fig-johnnyweir-fur&amp;prov=ap&amp;type=lgns |title=Weir changes mind about wearing fur}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the protests escalated to threats of violence against him, Weir announced he would remove the fur from his costume, although he continued to defend wearing fur as a &quot;personal choice.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weir says he'll wear faux, not fox fur, after allegedly receiving 'threats' |date=28 January 2010 |work=[[Star Tribune]] |url=http://www.startribune.com/sports/olympics/82979982.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUg7Kk8P3iUiacyKUzyaP37D_MDua_eyD5PcOiUr |archiveurl=http://www.startribune.com/sports/olympics/82979982.html?elr=KArksi8cyaiUg7Kk8P3iUiacyKUzyaP37D_MDua_eyD5PcOiUr|archivedate=4 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Death threats from animal rights activists also forced Weir to alter his housing arrangements for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver Canada|Vancouver]]. He had intended to stay in a [[Vancouver Canada|Vancouver]] hotel, but for security reasons, chose to stay at the secure [[2010 Olympic Village|Olympic Village]], sharing a suite with fellow American figure skater [[Tanith Belbin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters21310&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=&quot;Crazy fur people&quot; force Weir's hand |last=Sarkar |first=Pritha |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE61C25P20100213 |date=13 February 2010 |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfchron21410&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Wary Weir says threats keeping him in village |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2010/02/13/SPBQ1C1F0T.DTL |date=14 February 2010 |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=17 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[Figure skating at the 2010 Winter Olympics - Men's singles|2010 Winter Olympics]], Weir finished sixth overall, with a new personal-best combined score of 238.87.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010olympics&quot;&gt;{{citation |periodical=[[New York Times]] |date=19 February 2010 |url=http://2010games.nytimes.com/events/figure-skating/mens-figure-skating/results.html |title=Men's Figure Skating |accessdate=19 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Weir did not compete during the [[2010â2011 figure skating season|2010â2011 season]] and confirmed in June 2011 that he would also miss the [[2011â2012 figure skating season|2011â2012 season]], while suggesting a competitive return was still possible.&lt;ref name=in061411&gt;{{cite news | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110614&amp;content_id=20465054&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = Weir won't compete in upcoming season | last =  | first =  | date = June 14, 2011 | publisher = IceNetwork | accessdate = June 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Coaching changes ==
[[File:Grand Prix Final 2008 Johnny Weir and Galina Zmievskaya.jpg|thumb|Weir and Zmievskaya during the [[2008-2009 Grand Prix of Figure Skating Final|2008 Grand Prix Final]]]]
From the beginning of his career at age twelve, Weir trained under coach [[Priscilla Hill]]. They worked together first at the [[University of Delaware]] in [[Newark, Delaware|Newark]] and after the 2002/2003 season moved to the Pond Ice Arena, also in Newark. Weir also spent part of each summer between 2003 and 2005 working with Russian coach [[Tatiana Tarasova]] at the International Skating Center of Connecticut in [[Simsbury, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Johnny Weir Prepares to Defend his U.S. Title |publisher=US Figure Skating|url=http://www.usfsa.org/Story.asp?id=28318&amp;type=news |date=27 December 2004 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He changed coaches in the summer of 2007 when he moved to the Ice Vault Arena in [[Wayne, New Jersey]] and began working with [[Galina Zmievskaya]], who previously coached Weir's idol [[Oksana Baiul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/AthleteBio.asp?id=2282 |publisher=US Figure Skating|title=Johnny Weir Bio|date=12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifsmagazine.com/forum/index.php?showtopic=431&amp;pid=612&amp;st=0&amp;#entry612 |title=New Coach For Johnny Weir Three-Time U.S. Men's Champion to Train With Galina Zmievskaya |publisher=International Figure Skating|date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=18 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zmievskaya's son-in-law and Olympic gold medallist [[Viktor Petrenko]] acts as Weir's assistant coach, and her daughter Nina Petrenko is one of his choreographers.&lt;ref name=&quot;biography&quot;/&gt;
