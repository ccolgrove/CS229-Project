In the [[X Window System]], '''xwd''' is a [[Computer program|program]] for capturing the content of the screen or of a [[window]] and saving it into a [[Computer file|file]]. 
xwd can be run in two ways: if user specifies the whole screen or the name or identifier of a window as an argument, the program captures the content of the window; otherwise, it changes the shape of the [[Cursor (computers)|cursor]] and waits for the user to click in a window, whose content is then captured.

At the [[X Window core protocol]] level, xwd uses the fact that any X client can request the content of an arbitrary window, including ones it did not create, using the &lt;code&gt;GetImage&lt;/code&gt; request (this is done by the &lt;code&gt;XGetImage&lt;/code&gt; function in the [[Xlib]] library). The content of the whole screen is obtained by requesting the content of the [[root window]].

The file generated by xwd can then be read by various other X utilities such as [[xwud]], [[xv]], and the [[GIMP]], or converted to other formats; the [[netpbm]] suite allows a useful [[Unix pipe|pipeline]] to be constructed:
 $ xwd | xwdtopnm | pnmtopng &gt; Screenshot.png

The dumps are larger in size than files in most [[image file format]]s â not only compressed formats such as [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], but also uncompressed bitmap formats like [[BMP file format|BMP]].
