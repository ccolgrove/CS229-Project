==Campus==
As a university in the downtown of a large urban centre, the University of Winnipeg is playing a significant role in the downtown renewal. Recent initiatives, for example, include the newly renovated Canwest Centre for Theatre and Film and a recreation complex. A new western campus with three LEED Silver buildings has added significant capacity to campus and includes the state-of-the-art Richardson College for the Environment and science complex, a student and community daycare facility and a new student residence. In 2008, the university announced that Raymond L. McFeetors, Chairman of [[Great West Life|The Great West Life Assurance Company]], had donated $2.67 Million for a dormitory to be built on newly acquired property west of the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/release-080502. |title = Ray McFeetors, Great West Life |author = University of Winnipeg |accessdate=2008-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The money came from his personal resources and from Great West Life. 

A new building - the Buhler Centre - has also been constructed to house the faculty of business and continuing education programs designed by PSA+DPA+DIN collective a collaborative effort between Peter Sampson Architecture Studio inc, David Petter Architect, and DIN Projects. . Wesley Hall, a stone-clad brick structure built in 1894-95, is on the Registry of Historic Places of Canada &lt;ref&gt;http://www.historicplaces.ca/visit-visite/affichage-display.aspx?id=8224 Wesley Hall Registry of Historic Places of Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Great Rock Climb==
[[File:UWboulder.JPG|right|thumb|300px|The granite boulder on the U of W's front lawn.]]
The brainchild of President Emeritus Dr. Henry E. Duckworth, a 25-ton &lt;!-- Which ton? --&gt;granite boulder was placed on the front lawn of The University of Winnipeg on October 7, 1971. The Rock of Remembrance commemorates the 100th anniversary of Manitoba College, a founding college of what is now The University of Winnipeg.

The University of Winnipegâs Great Rock Climb celebrates endurance and ingenuity. Teams of three students, faculty, staff, or alumni raced down the {{convert|50.3|m|ft}} from the steps of Wesley Hall to the top of the Great Rock in a test of physical stamina and defiance of earthly gravity.

The all-time record was set in 1979 by the Collegiate team when the trio reached the top in 9.8 seconds. Renovations during the summer of 2007 have significantly slowed the event, with a new record set in 2007 by The Caravaners, consisting of members Ian Scott, Drew Hawranik, and Alex Edye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author =  |title = The Caravaners Rock the Climb |publisher = University of Winnipeg |date =15 September 2007 |url = http://www.uwinnipeg.ca/index/release-070914-2 |accessdate=2010-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2008 and 2009 were repeat performances by The Caravaners, who become the only trio to win the competition in three consecutive years. They recorded a time of 15.19 seconds which becomes the current record for the event with a renovated front lawn. 

After flying in from Edmonton to battle in the Great Rock Climb, Drew Hawranik had to return to Alberta without competing due to rain on September 10, 2010. 2010 becomes the third consecutive year that the Great Rock Climb has been delayed by weather.
