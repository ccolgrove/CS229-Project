'''Springfield''' is the most populous city in Western [[New England]], and the seat of [[Hampden County, Massachusetts]], United States.{{Geographic reference|6}} Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the [[Connecticut River]] near its confluence with three rivers; the western [[Westfield River]], the eastern [[Chicopee River]], and the eastern [[Mill River (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mill River]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], the city's population was 153,060. &lt;ref name=&quot;2010census&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_PL_GCTPL2.ST16&amp;prodType=table |title=Population and Housing Occupancy Status: 2010 â State â County Subdivision, 2010 Census Redistricting Data (Public Law 94-171) Summary File|publisher=U.S. Census Bureau |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Springfield, Massachusetts metropolitan area|Metropolitan Springfield]] - one of two metropolitan areas in Massachusetts (the other being [[Greater Boston]]) â has an estimated population of 698,903 (2009.) &lt;ref name=&quot;2009popest&quot;&gt;July 1, 2009, estimated: {{cite web | url = http://www.census.gov/popest/metro/tables/2009/CBSA-EST2009-01.csv | title = Table 1.

The first Springfield in the New World, it is the largest city in Western New England, and the urban, economic, and cultural capital of Massachusetts' [[Connecticut River Valley]], (colloquially known as the [[Pioneer Valley]]). It is the third-largest city in Massachusetts and fourth-largest in [[New England]] ([[Boston]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], and [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]] are larger). Springfield has several nicknames â ''The City of Firsts'', because of its many innovations (see below for a partial list); ''The City of Homes'', due to its attractive Victorian residential architecture; and ''Hoop City'', because [[basketball]] â currently the world's second-most-popular sport â was invented in Springfield.

[[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], the State of [[Connecticut]]'s capital city, lies only {{convert|23.9|mi|km}} south of Springfield, on the western bank of the [[Connecticut River]]. Springfield and Hartford share [[Bradley International Airport]], which lies equidistant between them. The Hartford-Springfield region is known as the [[Knowledge Corridor]] because it hosts over 160,000 university students and over 32 [[universities]] and [[liberal arts colleges]] - the second-highest concentration of higher-learning institutions in the United States. &lt;ref name=&quot;sdplotkin.com&quot;&gt;http://sdplotkin.com/files/WMECO_Review2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The City of Springfield itself is home to [[Springfield College]]; [[Western New England College|Western New England University]]; [[Tufts University School of Medicine]]; [[American International College]]; the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]'s School of Urban Design; [[Cambridge College]]; and [[Springfield Technical Community College]], among other higher educational institutions.

The City of Springfield has played an important role throughout American history, due largely to its geography. Founded on New England's most fertile soil, at a natural crossroads of four rivers and ancient roads headed in all directions, it is located midway between [[Boston]] and [[Albany, New York|Albany]]; it is only slightly farther from [[New York City]], and is the closest major New England city to [[Montreal]]. In 1777, Springfield's location led [[George Washington]] and [[Henry Knox]] to found the fledgling United States' [[Springfield Armory|National Armory at Springfield]], which produced the first American musket in 1794, and later the famous [[Springfield rifle]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;&gt;[http://springfield375.org/?p=126 Firsts&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;Springfield 375]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1777 until its controversial closing during the Vietnam War, the Springfield Armory attracted skilled laborers to Springfield, making it the United States' longtime epicenter for precision manufacturing. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/news/view/375-new_museum_of_springfield_history_to_open_october_10 New Museum of Springfield History to Open October 10 â News Â» Springfield Museums]&lt;/ref&gt; Springfielders produced many of America's most significant innovations, including the first American-English dictionary (1805, [[Merriam Webster]]); the first use of [[interchangeable parts]] and the [[assembly line]] in manufacturing, (1819, [[Thomas Blanchard]];) the first American horseless car, (1825, [[Thomas Blanchard]];) the discovery and patent of [[vulcanized rubber]], (1844, [[Charles Goodyear]];) the first American, gasoline-powered car, (1893, [[Duryea Brothers]]); the first successful motorcycle company, (1901, &quot;[[Indian (motorcycle)|Indian]]&quot;); America's first commercial radio station, (1921, [[WBZA]] from the [[Hotel Kimball]]); and most famous for the world's second-most-popular sport, [[basketball]], (1891, [[Dr. James Naismith]]). &lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt;

[[File:First Church of Christ, Springfield MA.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The First Church of Christ in Springfield's [[Court Square]] was the 20th parish gathered in the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]], in 1637.]]

In 1635, the business-minded Puritan [[William Pynchon]] - an original settler of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]], magistrate, and then assistant treasurer of the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] - led a scouting expedition with John Cable and John Woodcock, either north up the [[Connecticut River]] or west across the inland &quot;Bay Path&quot; (present-day Boston Road) from the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] village of [[Roxbury, Massachusetts]]. Eventually, they reached what they believed to be the Connecticut River Valley's most advantageous spot for both farming and conducting trade: present-day Springfield. The site is located at the confluence of a major river (the [[Connecticut River|Connecticut]]) with two of its major tributaries: one to the west (the [[Westfield River]];) and one to the east, (the [[Chicopee River]];) and a confluence with the smaller, quick-running [[Mill River (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mill River]]. Its rivers and geological history have dictated that its soil is among the finest for farming in the Northeast. &lt;ref name=&quot;Swift 11&quot;&gt;Swift, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

At that time, on the western bank of the Connecticut River, the explorers found the [[Pocomtuc]] (or perhaps [[Nipmuck]]) Indian village of Agawam. The land near the river was clear of trees due to burns by the Indians, and covered in nutrient-rich river silt from floods.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Just south of the [[Westfield River]], the colonists constructed a pre-fabricated house in what is present-day [[Agawam, Massachusetts]]. Cable and Woodcock were supplied with food and goods to trade with the Natives over the winter, while Pynchon returned to Roxbury to spread news of fertile farmland and &quot;The Great River.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Swift 11&quot;&gt;Swift, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1636, Pynchon led a settlement expedition with a larger group, including Henry Smith (Pynchon's son-in-law), Jehu Burr, William Blake, Matthew Mitchell, Edmund Wood, Thomas Ufford, and John Cable.&lt;ref&gt;Swift, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Springfield's English founders came from both the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the [[Plymouth Colony]] - indeed, Springfield was Massachusetts' first settlement for non-religious reasons, although many of its settlers were very religious, as indicated by their first article of incorporation, &quot;Wee intend by God's grace, as soon as we can,  with all convenient speede to procure some Godly and faithfull minister we purpose to joyne in church covenant, to walk in all the ways of Christ&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;King 1885&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dutch and [[Plymouth Colonists]] had been leapfrogging their way up &quot;the Great River&quot; - to that point, as far north as [[Windsor, Connecticut]] - attempting to establish its northernmost village to gain the greatest access to the region's raw materials. Pynchon selected a spot just north of [[Enfield Falls]], the first spot on the Connecticut River where all travelers have to stop to negotiate a waterfall, {{convert|32|ft|m}} in height, and then transship their cargoes from ocean-going vessels to smaller shallops. By founding Springfield, Pynchon positioned himself as the northernmost trader on the Connecticut River. Near [[Enfield Falls]], he erected a warehouse to store goods awaiting transshipment, which to this day is still called &quot;Warehouse Point,&quot; located in the town now known as [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Swift, p. 16&quot;&gt;Swift, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Pynchon's party purchased land on both sides of Connecticut River from 18 tribesman who lived at a palisade fort at the current site of Springfield's Longhill Street. The price paid was 18 hoes, 18 fathoms of wampum, 18 coats, 18 hatchets and 18 knives.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/history/index.ssf/2011/05/springfields_375th_from_puritans_to_presidents.html#incart_hbx Springfield's 375th: From Puritans to presidents &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;http://www.chronos-historical.org/highway/maps/map07.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The Indians retained foraging and hunting rights, the rights to their existing farmlands, and were granted the right to compensation if the English cattle ruined their corn crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.registryofdeeds.co.hampden.ma.us/indian.pdf Deed of purchase (PDF)], 15 July 1636. {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, in 1636, the English settlement was named Agawam Plantation.

After warnings from the Natives about the Connecticut River's west side being prone to flooding,&lt;ref&gt;Swift, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; most Springfield settlers moved to the east side of the river, which was slightly less advantageous for farming because of its prominent bluffs and hills. The initial land grants to English families were made there in what is today Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]], along what is today Main Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot;&gt;name=&quot;King 1885&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Long, narrow plots of farmland were created, extending outward from the river. In addition, more distant forested &quot;wood lots&quot; were offered. The original, main profit-generating industry for Springfield was trade with the Indians for beaver skins, which were then exported around the colonial world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Swift, p. 16&quot;/&gt;

====Choosing to join Massachusetts====
In 1640 and 1641, two events took place that forever changed the political boundaries of the Connecticut River Valley. From its founding until that time, Springfield had been administered by Connecticut along with Connecticut's three other settlements - at [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], and [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]]. In the spring of 1640, grain was very scarce and cattle were dying of starvation. The nearby Connecticut River Valley settlements of [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]] (then called &quot;Matianuck&quot;) and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]] (then called &quot;Newtown&quot;) gave power to William Pynchon to buy corn for all three English settlements. If the natives would not sell their corn at market prices, then Pynchon was authorized to offer more money. The natives refused to sell their corn at market prices, and then later refused to sell it at &quot;reasonable&quot; prices. Pynchon refused to buy it, believing it best not to broadcast the English colonists' weaknesses, and also wanting to keep market values steady.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrows 1911&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leading citizens of what would become Hartford were furious with Pynchon for not purchasing any grain. With Windsor's and Wethersfield's consent, the three southerly settlements commissioned the famed Native American-conqueror [[John Mason (c.1600â1672)|Captain John Mason]] to travel to Springfield with &quot;money in one hand and a sword in the other.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;Barrows 1911&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; On reaching what would become Springfield, Mason threatened the local natives with war if they did not sell their corn at a &quot;reasonable price.&quot; The natives capitulated and ultimately sold the colonists corn; however, Mason's violent approach led to the natives' deepening distrust of the English colonists. Pynchon, an avowed &quot;man of peace,&quot; believed in negotiation with the natives (and thus, quickly made a fortune), whereas Mason â a hero of the [[Pequot Wars]] and conqueror of Connecticut â believed in subduing natives by force. This philosophical difference led to Mason using &quot;hard words&quot; against Pynchon. Pynchon's settlement, however, agreed with him and his philosophy, and that same year voted to separate from the Connecticut Colony and be annexed by the Massachusetts Bay Colony. As this local controversy was heating up the Massachusetts Bay Colony decided to reassert its jurisdiction over the land bordering the Connecticut River, realizing that it was its most valuable for farming. William Pynchon was named magistrate of Agawam by the Massachusetts Bay Colony and, in honor of him the settlement was renamed Springfield after [[Springfield, Essex|the village of Springfield]] near [[Chelmsford]], [[Essex]] in England, where William Pynchon was born and raised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrows 1911&quot;/&gt; For decades, Springfield - which, at the time, included modern-day Westfield - was the westernmost settlement in Massachusetts.

The philosophical differences between Springfield and Connecticut were exacerbated by one final confrontation in 1641. Hartford had been keeping a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut River at [[Saybrook Colony|Old Saybrook]], for protection against the natives and the [[New Netherland]] Colony. After Springfield sided with the Massachusetts Bay Colony over the Connecticut Colony, Connecticut demanded that Springfield's boats pay a toll when passing the Fort at Old Saybrook, (which, at the time, was not even administered by the Connecticut Colony, but the short-lived [[Saybrook Colony]].) Pynchon would have been agreeable to this if Springfield could have had representation at the fort, as Hartford, Wethersfield, and Windsor did. However, Pynchon did not agree with the idea of taxation without representation. Connecticut refused to allow Springfield representation at the Fort at Saybrook, so Pynchon instructed his boats to refuse to pay Connecticut's toll. When the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] heard of this, it took Pynchon's side and immediately drafted a resolution that required Connecticut ships to pay a toll when entering Boston Harbor. Connecticut, which was then dependent largely on trade with Boston, immediately dropped its tax on Springfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barrows 1911&quot;/&gt;

====Early &quot;firsts&quot;====
In 1645, 46 years before the [[Salem witch trials]], Springfield experienced America's first accusations of [[witchcraft]] when Mary Parsons accused a widow named Marshfield, who had moved from Windsor to Springfield, with witchcraft - an offense then punishable by death.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt; For this, Mary Parsons was found guilty of slander. In 1651, Mary Parsons was accused of witchcraft - to be specifical &quot;divers devilish practices by witchcraft, to the hurt of Martha and Rebeckah Moxon,&quot; two daughters of Springfield's first minister - and also of murdering her own child.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt; In turn, Mary Parsons then accused her own husband, Hugh Parsons, of witchcraft. At America's first [[witch trial]], both Mary and Hugh Parsons were found not guilty of witchcraft for want of satisfactory evidence; however, Mary was found guilty of murdering her own child. For this, she was sentenced to death, but died in prison in 1651, before receiving her death sentence.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt;

William Pynchon was the [[New World]]'s first commercial meat packer â in 1641, he began exporting barrels of salt-pork;&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt; however, in 1650 he became famous for writing the New World's first banned book.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt; In 1649, Pynchon found time to write a book, ''The Meritous Price of Our Redemption'', a theological study that was published in London in 1650. Several copies made it back to the Massachusetts Bay Colony and its capital, Boston, which, this time reacted with rage to Pynchon rather than with support. For his critical attitude toward Massachusetts' Calvinist [[Puritanism]], Pynchon was accused of [[heresy]], and his book was burned on the [[Boston Common]]. Only 4 copies survived.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfieldlibrary.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.springfieldlibrary.org/Pynchon/pynchon.html Springfield City Library]&lt;/ref&gt; By declaration of the [[Massachusetts General Court]], in 1650, ''The Meritous Price of Our Redemption'' became the first-ever [[banned book]] in the New World.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onlinesociologydegree.net/resources/banned-books/ Banned Books &amp;#124; Online Sociology Degree News and Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The first work ever to be officially &quot;[[banned in Boston]]&quot;, in 1651, Pynchon was accused of [[heresy]] in Boston â at exactly the same meeting of the Massachusetts General Court where Springfielder Mary Parsons was sentenced to death in America's first witch trial.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfieldlibrary.org&quot;/&gt; Standing to lose all of his land-holdings â the largest in the Connecticut River Valley â William Pynchon transferred ownership to his son, John, and then, in 1652, moved back to England with his friend, the Reverend Moxon.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfieldlibrary.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://josfamilyhistory.com/htm/nickel/griffin/sheldon/whiting/whiting-pynchon-wm.htm Pynchon Family]&lt;/ref&gt;

William's son, John Pynchon, and his brother-in-law, [[Elizur Holyoke]], quickly took on the settlement's leadership roles. They began moving Springfield away from the diminishing fur trade into agricultural pursuits. In 1655, John Pynchon launched America's first [[cattle drive]], prodding a herd from Springfield to Boston along the old Bay Path Trail.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt;

Purchases of large swaths of land from the Indians continued throughout the 17th century, enlarging Springfield's territory and forming other colonial towns elsewhere in the Connecticut River Valley. Westfield was the westernmost settlement of Massachusetts Bay Colony until 1725 - and Springfield was, as it remains today, the Colony's most populous and important western settlement.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; Over decades and centuries, portions of Springfield were partitioned off to form neighboring towns; however, throughout the centuries, Springfield has remained the region's most populous and most important city.

Due to imprecision in surveying colonial borders, Springfield became embroiled in a boundary dispute between the Massachusetts Bay Colony and the [[Connecticut Colony]], which was not resolved until 1803-4. (See the article on the [[History of Massachusetts#Connecticut border|History of Massachusetts-Connecticut Border]]). As a result, some lands originally administered by Springfield â including the William Pynchon's Warehouse Point - are now administered by Connecticut.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===King Phillip's War===
{{main|Attack on Springfield}}
[[File:Philip King of Mount Hope by Paul Revere.jpeg|thumb|200px|right|Portrait of King Philip, by [[Paul Revere]].]]
In 1675, Springfield became one of two major settlements burned to the ground during the [[New World]]'s first major Indian War, [[King Phillip's War]]. (The other major settlement burned was [[Providence, Rhode Island]]). King Phillip's War permanently ended the harmonious relations that had existed between the Natives and Springfield's settlers. Thousands of New England settlers and Native Americans died in King Phillip's War, which to this day remains the most violent war per capita in American history.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt; The carnage resulted in the clearing of the Native populations from southern New England and the unopposed expansion of the New England colonies. It also became the ruthless model on which the United States based its dealings with its native peoples.

After years of encroaching upon Indian land and decimating the native population with European diseases, the leader of the Eastern Massachusetts [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Indian tribe, [[Wamsutta]], died shortly after being questioned at gunpoint by Plymouth colonists. Wamsutta's brother, Chief [[Metacomet]] (known to Springfielders as &quot;Phillip,&quot;) who had long been friendly and helpful to European settlers, took revenge. Initially inciting his own tribe to rebel against English colonists in eastern Massachusetts, King Phillip himself visited the theretofore peaceful Agawam ([[Pocomtuc]]) Indians by Springfield, and incited them to rebel and burn Springfield to the ground.&lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt; Springfielders were given advance warning of the attack by a Native from [[Windsor, Connecticut]] named Toto, who history often records as &quot;The Windsor Indian.&quot; Despite the advance warning, during the [[Attack on Springfield]], 45 of Springfield's 60 houses were burned to the ground, as were the grist and saw mills belonging to village leader John Pynchon, which became smoldering ruins.&lt;ref name=&quot;massrealty.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.massrealty.com/hampden/springfield Homes For Sale in Springfield MA Real Estate]&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Attack on Springfield]], serious thought was given to abandoning the village of Springfield and defecting to nearby towns; however, wiser heads prevailed. The residents of Springfield endured the winter of 1675 under siege conditions. During that winter, Captain [[Miles Morgan]]'s block-house became Springfield's fortress â it held-out until messengers had been despatched to Hadley, after which thirty-six men (the standing army of the Massachusetts Bay Colony), under command of Captain Samuel Appleton, marched to Springfield and raised the siege. Both of Captain Miles Morgan's sons died defending Springfield in the conflict, and thus today, a large bronze statue of [[Miles Morgan]] - the hero of King Phillip's War - stands in Springfield's [[Court Square]], showing him in huntsman's dress with a rifle over his shoulder.

During King Phillip's War, over 800 settlers were killed and approximately 8000 Natives were killed, enslaved, or made refugees.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our Plural History&quot;&gt;[http://ourpluralhistory.stcc.edu/firstpeoples/King%20Philips%20War.html Springfield, MA - Our Plural History]&lt;/ref&gt; The war ended in the summer of 1676, when colonists shot Metacomet twice with a musket, leading to the Native Americans' surrender.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our Plural History&quot;/&gt; Following the war, Springfield's Natives, who had, before the war, frequently been seen around town, virtually disappeared. On the occasions that they were seen, they generally raided Springfield. Thereafter fighting between the Connecticut River Valley's originally peaceful First People (and their allies, the French), and the English colonists continued for over 100 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Our Plural History&quot;/&gt;

Today, the hilltop on which King Phillip incited the Agawam Indians to attack Springfield is known as King Phillip's Stockade. It is a Springfield city park offering excellent views of the Connecticut River, city skyline, picnic pavilions, and a statue depicting the famous Windsor Indian who tried to warn the residents of Springfield of impending danger.

===The Springfield Armory===
[[File:Springfield Armory.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Springfield Armory]], opened by George Washington in 1777, was controversially closed in 1968]]

Then as now, a major crossroads, during the 1770s, [[George Washington]] selected a high bluff in Springfield as the site of the [[Springfield Armory|U.S. National Armory]]. Washington selected Springfield for its centrality to important American cities and resources, its easy access to the Connecticut River and because, as today, the city served as the nexus for well-traveled roads. Washington's officer [[Henry Knox]] noted that Springfield was far enough upstream on the Connecticut River to guard against all but the most aggressive sea attacks. He concluded that âthe plain just above Springfield is perhaps one of the most proper spots on every accountâ for the location of a National Arsenal.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt; During the War of Independence, the arsenal at Springfield provided supplies and equipment for the American forces. At that time, the arsenal stored muskets, cannons, and other weapons; it also produced paper cartridges. Barracks, shops, storehouses, and a magazine were built, but no arms were manufactured. After the war the government retained the facility to store arms for future needs.

By the 1780s the Arsenal was the United States' largest ammunition and weapons depot, which made it the logical focal point for [[Shay's Rebellion]] (see below). &lt;ref&gt;[http://explorewmass.blogspot.com/2008/05/springfield-chronology-from-settlement.html Exploring Western Massachusetts: The Springfield Chronology: Settlement to City]&lt;/ref&gt; On the recommendations of then U.S. President George Washington, Congress formally established the Springfield Armory in 1794.  In 1795, the Springfield Armory produced the first American-made musket, and during that year, produced 245 muskets.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt; Until its closing in 1968, the Armory developed and produced a majority of the arms that served American soldiers in the nationâs successful wars. Its presence also set Springfield on the path of industrial innovation that would result in the city becoming known as the &quot;City of Progress&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;cardcow1&quot;&gt;[http://www.cardcow.com/12517/city-progress-new-library-merrick-park-state-street-springfield-massachusetts/ The City of Progress New City Library, Merrick Park, State Street Springfield, MA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cardcow2&quot;&gt;[http://www.cardcow.com/129088/city-progress-winchester-square-springfield-massachusetts/ The City Of Progress, Winchester Square Springfield, MA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebooksread1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/george-storrs-graves/progressive-springfield-massachusetts-var/1-progressive-springfield-massachusetts-var.shtml Progressive Springfield, Massachusetts by George Storrs [Graves]&lt;/ref&gt; and later as the &quot;City of Firsts.&quot;

The term [[Springfield Rifle]] may refer to any sort of arms produced by the Springfield Armory for the [[United States armed forces]]. Other famous arms invented in Springfield include the [[Garand Rifle]], the Repeating Pistol, and the Semi-automatic Rifle (the [[M-1 rifle]]). &lt;ref name=&quot;SFCH&quot;&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/Park/153.0.html Springfield Dept. of Parks &amp; Recreation: Firsts Things First]&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{convert|55|acre|m2}} within the Armory's famous ornamental cast-iron fence are now administered by [[Springfield Technical Community College]] and the [[National Park Service]]. Most of the buildings were erected during the 19th century, with the oldest dating from 1808. The complex reflects the Armory commandersâ goal of creating an institution with dignity and architectural integrity worthy of the increasing strength of the federal government.

===[[Shays' Rebellion]]===

Shays's Rebellion - the most crucial battle of which was fought at the Springfield Armory in 1787 - was the United States' first [[populism|populist]] revolt. It has also been called &quot;the last battle of the American Revolution.&quot; Concerns about Shay's Rebellion resulted in a complete change of the United States' governmental structureâfrom the original United States [[Articles of Confederation]] to the [[United States Constitution]], which greatly enhanced the U.S. Federal Government's power over the States. It prompted [[George Washington]] to come out of retirement, and catalyzed the U.S. Founding Fathers to craft the U.S. Constitution, which still guides the country today. On May 25, 1787, General [[Henry Knox]], the Secretary of War, addressed the [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in Philadelphia: âThe commotion of Massachusetts have wrought prodigious changes in the minds of men in the State respecting the Powers of Government... They must be strengthened, there is no security of liberty or property.â &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revolutionaryday.com/usroute20/springfield/default.htm Springfield, MA - A Site on a Revolutionary War Road Trip on US Route 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shay's Rebellion was led, in part, by [[Revolutionary War]] hero [[Daniel Shays]], and thus acquired the nickname &quot;Shay's Rebellion.&quot; In January 1787, Shays and the &quot;Regulators&quot; as they were then called, tried to seize the Arsenal at Springfield. At the time of Shay's Rebellion, the Arsenal at Springfield was not yet an Armory; however, it contained brass ordnance, [[howitzers]], traveling carriages, shot strapt, canisters filled, quilted grape, iron shot, shells, powder, [[Musket#Ammunition|musket ball]], cylinders, caps, paper cartridges, fuzes filled, [[muskets]], [[swords]], various military stores, and implements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Century of Lawmaking for a New Nation: U.S. Congressional Documents and Debates, 1774 - 1875|url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=llsp&amp;fileName=016/llsp016.db&amp;recNum=50|work=Library of Congress|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the Regulators had captured the Arsenal at Springfield, they would have had exponentially more firepower than their adversaries, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, led by former U.S. General [[Benjamin Lincoln]].

====Supreme Judicial Court at Springfield shutdown by angry mob====
[[File:Daniel Shays and Job Shattuck.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Engraving â there are no portraits â depicting [[Daniel Shays]] (left) and [[Job Shattuck]] of [[Shays' Rebellion]].]]

In July 1786, a diverse group of Western Massachusetts gentlemen, farmers, and war veterans - often mischaracterized as &quot;poor [[yeoman]] farmers&quot; by the Massachusetts and Federal governments, in attempt to belittle or explain participants' reasons for rebelling - convened in [[Southampton, Massachusetts]], to write-up a list of grievances with the 1780 Massachusetts State Constitution. Among the conventioneers was William Pynchon, the voice of Springfield's - and the Connecticut River Valley's - most powerful family. The convention produced twenty-one articles - 17 were grievances, necessitating radical changes to Massachusetts' State Constitution. They included moving the Massachusetts State Legislature out of Boston to a more central location, where Boston's mercantile elite could no longer control the state government for its own financial gain; abolishing the Massachusetts State Senate, which was dominated by Boston's merchants and was in essence a redundant given that Massachusetts already had a State Legislature that dealt with similar issues; and revising election rules so that State Legislators would be held accountable yearly via elections. Grievances were also voiced about Massachusetts' excessively complex, seemingly money-driven court system and the scarcity of paper money to pay state taxes.

Rather than address the Southampton Convention's grievances, both houses of the Massachusetts State Legislature went on vacation. After this, &quot;Regulators&quot; as they were then called, began gathering in mobs of thousands, forcing the closure of Massachusetts' county courts. The Regulators shut down court proceedings in Northampton, Worcester, Concord, Taunton, Great Barrington, and then finally, even the Supreme Judicial Court in Springfield.

Massachusetts' Governor Bowdoin - along with Boston's former patriots, like [[Samuel Adams]], who had, it seemed, lost touch with common people - were zealously unsympathetic to the Regulators' cause. Samuel Adams wanted the Regulators &quot;put to death immediately.&quot; In response, Governor Bowdoin dispatched a militia financed by Boston merchants led by former Revolutionary War General [[Benjamin Lincoln]], as well as a militia of 900 men led by General [[William Shepard]] to protect Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, 1995, 93.&lt;/ref&gt; The militia members, however, generally sympathized with the Regulators and more often than not, defected to the Regulators rather than remain with Massachusetts' militia. News of the Rebellion in Western Massachusetts reached the Continental Congress in late 1786. The Congress authorized troops to put down the rebellion; however, the government refused to give an honest reason for the authorization of troops, insisting that it was for fighting Indians in Ohio. In the Massachusetts State Legislature, [[Elbridge Gerry]] noted that the 'fighting Indians in Ohio' excuse was &quot;laughable.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Zinn, 1995, 98.&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Battle of the U.S. Arsenal at Springfield====

By January 1787, thousands of men from Western Massachusetts, Eastern New York, Vermont, and Connecticut had joined the Regulators; however, many were scattered across the expanse of Western Massachusetts. On January 25, 1787, three major Regulator armies were coalescing on Springfield in attempt to overtake the U.S. Federal [[Arsenal at Springfield]]. The armies were commanded by, respectively, Daniel Shays, whose army was camped in nearby [[Palmer, Massachusetts]]; Luke Day, whose army was camped across the Connecticut River in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]]; and Eli Parsons, whose army was camped just north of Springfield in [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]]. The plan for commandeering the Arsenal at Springfield was for a three-pronged attack on January 25, 1787; however, the day before the scheduled attack, General Luke Day unilaterally postponed the attack to January 26, 1787. Day sent a note postponing the attack to both Shays and Parsons; however, it never reached them

On January 25, 1787, Shays's and Parson's armies approached the Arsenal at Springfield expecting Day's army to back them up. General William Shepard's Massachusetts militia - which had been withered by defections to the Regulators - was already inside the Arsenal. General Shepard had requested permission from U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Henry Knox]] to use the weaponry in the Arsenal, because technically its firepower belonged to the United States, and not the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Secretary of War [[Henry Knox]] denied the request on the grounds that it required Congressional approval and that Congress was out of session; however, Shepard used the Arsenal's weapons anyway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Brinkley | first1 = Alan | authorlink1 = Alan Brinkley | title = The Unfinished Nation Sixth Edition | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2010 | location = New York, New York | accessdate = 2010-11-30 | isbn = 978-0-07-338552-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Shays, Parsons, and their forces neared the Arsenal, they found Shepard's militia waiting for them - and they were baffled by the location of Luke Day's army. Shepard ordered a warning shot. Two cannons were fired directly into Shays's men. Four of the Shaysites were killed, and thirty were immediately wounded. No musket fire took place. The rear of Shays's army ran, leaving his Captain James White &quot;casting a look of scorn before and behind,&quot; and then fled. Without reinforcements from Day, the rebels were unsuccessful in taking the Springfield Arsenal.

The militia captured many of the rebels on February 4 in [[Petersham, Massachusetts]]. Over the course of the next several weeks, the rebels were dispersed; however, skirmishes continued for approximately a year thereafter.

Governor Bowdoin declared that Americans would descend into &quot;a state of anarchy, confusion, and slavery&quot; unless the rule of the law was upheld.&lt;ref&gt;Zinn, Howard. 1995. ''A People's History of the United States''. New York: Harper. p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; Shays's Rebellion, however, was - like American Revolution - an armed uprising against a rule of law perceived to be unjust.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foner, Eric 2006&quot;&gt;Foner, Eric. &quot;Give Me Liberty! An American History.&quot; New York: W.W Norton &amp; Company, 2006. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, Shays's Rebellions' legacy is the United States Constitution.

The City of Springfield, and, in particular, the Springfield Armory played an important role in the early [[Industrial Revolution]]. As of 2011, Springfield is nicknamed ''The City of Firsts''; however, throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, its nickname was ''The City of Progress''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cardcow1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cardcow2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ebooksread1&quot;/&gt; Throughout its history, Springfield has been a center of commercial invention, ideological progress, and technological innovation. For example, in 1819, inventor [[Thomas Blanchard]] and his [[lathe]] led to the uses of [[interchangeable parts]] and [[assembly line]] [[mass production]], which went on to influence the entire world - while originally making arms production at The Springfield Armory faster and less expensive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.invent.org/hall_of_fame/248.html Invent Now &amp;#124; Hall of Fame &amp;#124; Search &amp;#124; Inventor Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Blanchard â and Springfield â are credited with the discovery of the assembly line manufacturing process.&lt;ref name=&quot;SFCH&quot;/&gt; Blanchard also invented the first modern car in Springfield, a &quot;horseless carriage&quot; powered by steam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springfield375.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The first American-English dictionary was produced in Springfield in 1806 by the company now known as [[Merriam Webster]].&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt; Merriam Webster continues to maintain its worldwide headquarters in Springfield, just north of the Springfield Armory.

In Springfield, &quot;The City of Progress,&quot; many products were invented that are still popular and necessary today. For example, in 1844, [[Charles Goodyear]] perfected and patented [[vulcanized rubber]] at his factory in Springfield. (The automobile had not yet been invented, so Goodyear patented his [[rubber stamp]] rather than tires, for which he later became known). In 1856, the world's first-ever adjustable [[monkey wrench]] was invented in Springfield. In 1873, America's first [[post card]] was invented in Springfield by the Morgan Envelope Factory.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt; Also, America's first [[horse show]] and [[Conformation show|dog show]] were both produced in Springfield â 1853 and 1875, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt;

Well known for it âfirsts,&quot; Springfield also has the distinction of being the last [[New England]] city to free another state's [[slave]]. In Massachusetts, the cruel institution was outlawed by 1783, in a court decision upholding the 1780 [[Massachusetts Constitution]]. In 1808, a man from [[New York]] â where slavery, at the time, was legal â came to Springfield demanding the return of his escaped slave: a woman named Jenny who had been living in Springfield for several years. In a show of support for [[abolitionism]], the citizens of Springfield raised enough money to buy Jenny's freedom from the New Yorker. Jenny lived a free woman in Springfield thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt;

[[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], the celebrated abolitionist and hero of [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]], became a national leader in the [[Abolitionism|abolitionist movement]] while living in Springfield. Indeed, Springfield's role in the abolitionist movement was far greater than the city's population at the time, (approximately 20,000 before the separation of Chicopee). In 1836, Springfield's American Colonization Society was its first radical abolitionist group. Nearly all Springfielders - from its wealthiest merchants to its influential newspaper publisher - supported abolitionism. In 1846, Brown moved into this progressive climate and set-up a wool commission. Brown began attending church services at the traditionally-black Sanford Street Church (now St. John's Congregational Church.) In Springfield, Brown spoke with [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Sojourner Truth]], while learning about the successes of Springfield's [[Underground Railroad]]. Also, in Springfield, Brown met many of the contacts he would need in later years to fund his work in [[Bleeding Kansas]].&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt; In 1850, in response to the passage of the [[Fugitive Slave Act]], John Brown formed his first militant anti-slavery organization in Springfield: ''The League of Gileadites.'' Brown founded the group by saying, &quot;Nothing so charms the American people as personal bravery. [Blacks] would have ten times the number [of whites friends than] they now have were they but half as much in earnest to secure their dearest rights as they are to ape the follies and extravagances of their white neighbors...&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.zikibay.com/brown/prelude.html&lt;/ref&gt; The League of Gileadites protected slaves who escaped to Springfield from slaver-catchers. It is worth noting that after the foundation of Brown's organization in 1850, a slave was never again &quot;captured&quot; in the city. As of 2011, St. John's Congregational Church - one of the Northeast's most prominent black congregations, now celebrating its 167th year in existence - still displays John Brown's Bible. &lt;ref&gt;http://sjkb.org/discover_stjohns/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1852, Springfield was chartered as a city; however, only after decades of debate, which, in 1848, resulted in the partitioning off of the northern part of Springfield into [[Chicopee, Massachusetts]] - in order to reduce Springfield's land and population. The partition of Chicopee from Springfield deprived Springfield of approximately half of its territory and approximately two-thirds of its population. To this day, the two cities of Springfield and Chicopee feature relatively small land areas and remain partitioned. &lt;ref name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;  Springfield's first mayor was [[Caleb Rice]], who was also the first President of [[MassMutual]] Life Insurance Company. As of 2011, the [[MassMutual]] Life Insurance Company, headquartered in Springfield, is the second wealthiest company from Massachusetts listed in the [[Fortune 100]].

[[Wason Manufacturing Company]] of Springfield â one of the United States' first makers of railway passenger coach equipment â produced America's first [[sleeping car]] in 1857, (also known as a [[Pullman Car]]). &lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt; On May 2, 1849 the Springfield Railroad was chartered to build from Springfield to the Connecticut state line. By the 1870s the endeavor had become the [[Springfield and New London Railroad]].

In 1855, the formation of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] was championed by [[Samuel Bowles (journalist)|Samuel Bowles III]], publisher of the influential Springfield daily newspaper, ''[[The Republican (Springfield)|The Republican]]''. The Republican Party took its name from Bowles' newspaper.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt; On Friday, Sept. 21, 1855, the headline in ''The Republican'' read: âThe Child is Born!â This marked the birth of the Republican Party. By 1858, the Republicans had taken control of many Northern States' governments. In 1860, Bowles was on the train to the Republican convention in Chicago where his friend, Springfield lawyer [[George Ashmun]], was elected chairman of the convention that would eventually nominate [[Abraham Lincoln]] for president.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com 2&quot;/&gt;

In 1856, [[Horace Smith (inventor)|Horace Smith]] and [[Daniel B. Wesson]] formed [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] to manufacture [[revolvers]]. Smith &amp; Wesson has gone on to become the largest and, it can be argued, the most famous gun manufacturer in the world. The company's headquarters remains in Springfield and as of 2011, employs over 1200 workers.

On September 20, 1893, Springfielders [[Charles Duryea|Charles]] and [[J. Frank Duryea|Frank Duryea]] built and then road-tested the first-ever American, [[gasoline]]-powered [[automobile|car]] in Springfield. &lt;ref name=&quot;inventors.about.com&quot;&gt;[http://inventors.about.com/od/dstartinventors/a/DuryeaBrothers.htm The Duryea Brothers - Automobile History]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Duryea Motor Wagon Company|Duryea Motor Wagon]] was built on the third floor of the [[Stacy Building]] in Springfield, and first publicly road-tested on Howard Bemis's farm. &lt;ref&gt;http://hampdendeedsnews.blogspot.com/2010_05_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.autoswalk.com/news/article/10/21.html Worlds Greatest Cars]. {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, the Duryea Motor Wagon won America's first-ever road race â a {{convert|54|mi|km|adj=on}} race from Chicago to Evanston, Illinois. In 1896, the Duryea Motor Wagon Company became the first company to manufacture and sell gasoline-powered automobiles. The company's motto was &quot;there is no better motorcar.&quot; Immediately, Duryeas were purchased by luminaries of the times, such as [[George Vanderbilt]].&lt;ref name=&quot;inventors.about.com&quot;/&gt; Two months after buying one of the world's first Duryeas, New York City motorist Henry Wells hit a bicyclist â the rider suffered a broken leg, Wells spent a night in jail - and that was Springfield's peripheral role in the first-ever automobile accident.&lt;ref name=&quot;inventors.about.com&quot;/&gt;

The Duryeas were joined in Springfield's automobile industry in 1900 by [[Skene (automobile)|Skene]], (which disappeared shortly after), and [[Knox Automobile]], which survived until 1927.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arcadiapublishing.com/mm5/merchant.mvc?Screen=PROD&amp;Product_Code=9780738504995&amp;Store_Code=arcadia&amp;search=MA&amp;offset=0&amp;filter_cat=&amp;PowerSearch_Begin_Only=&amp;sort=code.asc&amp;range_low=&amp;range_high=%20%26srch_state%3D1 Knox Automobile Company - Arcadia Publishing]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1905,  Knox famously produced America's first motorized [[fire engine]]s for Springfield's Fire Department â the first modern fire department in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt;

In 1901, [[Indian (motorcycle)|&quot;Indian&quot; motorcycles]] were the first successful motorcycle manufacturers in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt; Chief and Scout models were the company's best sellers from the 1920s to the 1950s. The Hendee Manufacturing Company, Indian's parent company, also manufactured other products such as [[aircraft engine]]s, [[bicycle]]s, boat motors, and [[air conditioner]]s.

During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Springfield was known worldwide for its precision manufacturing and as &quot;a beehive of diversified production.&quot; The American Civil War brought &quot;intense and concentrated prosperity&quot; to Springfield, which manufactured nearly all of the Union Army's small arms. &lt;ref name=&quot;uml.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.uml.edu/com/cita/05paperforrantmuckensturm.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; From this period until the mid-20th century, Springfield's housing stock became increasingly attractive and ornate â not only for the wealthy, but for the middle-classes â earning Springfield its nickname ''The City of Homes''. A 1910 publication notes that &quot;Springfield has the most beautiful homes in New England. It has the most attractive streets in New England.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/cityofnewengland00mass#page/n21/mode/2up The city of New England is Springfield]&lt;/ref&gt; To this day, Springfield's housing stock consists mostly of ornate, older homes, many of which would cost small fortunes to build today â [[Victorian architecture|Victorian &quot;Painted Lady&quot; mansions]], elegant [[Queen Anne architecture|Queen Anne's]], and [[Tudor architecture|Tudor style architecture]] dominate Springfield's housing stock; however, the city also features attractive condominiums, in particular in its urban, [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] neighborhood.

By the first decade of the 20th century, the City of Springfield featured over 10% of all manufacturing plants in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and a far greater percentage of its precision machinery manufacturing plants, (as opposed to textile manufacturing plants, which were more prevalent in eastern Massachusetts.) &lt;ref name=&quot;massrealty.com&quot;/&gt;

In the 1920s, the city's precision manufacturing base attracted England's [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], who concluded, âThe artisans of Springfield â from long experience in fine precision work â were found to possess the same pride in workmanship as the craftsmen of England.&quot; From 1921 until 1931, Rolls-Royce located its only manufacturing plant outside of England in Springfield. It assembled nearly 3000 [[Rolls-Royce Silver Ghost|Silver Ghosts]] and [[Rolls-Royce Phantom I|Phantoms]] before production was halted by the [[Great Depression]] and the decision by Rolls Royce not to retool the plant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20041209073336/http://www.rolls-royce.com/northamerica/history/default.htm Rolls-Royce History]. Retrieved 2010-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; The Rolls Royce factory is adjacent to the former Indian Motorcycle manufacturing plant, by [[American International College]].

[[Granville Brothers Aircraft]] manufactured aircraft at Springfield Airport from 1929 until their [[bankruptcy]] in 1934. They are best-known for the trophy and speed record holding Senior Sportster (&quot;GeeBee&quot;) series of racing aircraft.

During this time, Springfield pioneered developments in mass media. For example, the United States' first commercial radio station was founded in Springfield in 1921, [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]], broadcasting from Springfield's most luxurious hotel, the [[Hotel Kimball]].&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;hammondmuseumofradio.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.hammondmuseumofradio.org/wbz-dhalper.html WBZ and WBZA in the 20's and 30's]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the United States' first [[UHF]] television station was founded in Springfield in 1953, [[WWLP]], (which, today, is Springfield's ''Newscenter 22'').

During this period, then-U.S. Vice President [[Thomas R. Marshall]], who served under U.S. President [[Woodrow Wilson]], famously opined, &quot;Here is a center from which thought emanates. What is said in Springfield is heard around the world.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/stream/picturesquecitys00grav#page/n3/mode/2up The picturesque city, Springfield, Massachusetts; a series of forty views showing the picturesque side of this &quot;city of homes&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The birthplace of basketball===
[[File:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in Springfield.]]

Today, the city of Springfield is known worldwide as the birthplace of the sport of [[basketball]]. In 1891, [[James Naismith]], a theology graduate, invented the sport of basketball at the YMCA International Training School â now known as [[Springfield College]] â to fill-in the gap between the football and baseball seasons. The first game of basketball ever played took place in the Mason Square district of Springfield. (The game's score was 1 â 0). As of 2011, the exact spot where the first game took place is memorialized by an illuminated monument. The first building to serve as an indoor basketball court resides at [[Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy]] in suburban Wilbraham, and has since been converted into a dormitory (Smith Hall). In 1912, the first ever specifically crafted basketball was produced in Springfield by the Victor Sporting Goods Company.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield375.org&quot;/&gt; As of 2011, Springfield-based [[Spalding (sports equipment)|Spalding]] is the world's largest producer of basketballs, and produces the official basketball of the [[National Basketball Association]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.spalding.com/contact.php {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Basketball became an Olympic sport in 1936, and since its burst of popularity during the 1980s and 1990s, has gone on to become the world's second most popular sport (after [[soccer]]). &lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.answers.com/Q/What_are_the_most_popular_spectator_sports_in_the_world What are the most popular spectator sports in the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 17, 1968, The [[Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] was opened on the Springfield College campus. In 1985, it was replaced by a larger facility on the bank of the [[Connecticut River]]. In 2002, a new, architecturally significant Hall of Fame was constructed next to the existing site, (which was subsequently converted into restaurants and an [[LA Fitness]] club). Shaped like a giant [[Basketball (ball)|basketball]] and illuminated at night, the Basketball Hall of Fame is currently one of the most architecturally recognizable buildings recently constructed in Springfield.

Today, both amateur and professional basketball are an integral part of Springfield's culture. Springfield's professional basketball team, the [[NBA Development League]] [[Springfield Armor]] â the official affiliate of the [[New Jersey Nets]] â play in the [[MassMutual Center]], several blocks from the Basketball Hall of Fame and the site of the first-ever basketball game. Basketball-related events take place in Springfield year-round, including the Basketball Hall of Fame's annual enshrinement ceremony, the [[NCAA]]'s college basketball Tip-Off Tournament, the [[NCAA]] MAAC division tournament, and the high school Hoop Hall Classic, among numerous other basketball-related events. Many non-basketball-related events in Springfield also draw inspiration from the sport; for example, the annual ''Hoop City Jazz Festival'' brings jazz greats and tens of thousands of people to the &quot;Hoop City.&quot;

&quot;Art &amp; Soles&quot;, a 2010 [[public art]] installation in Springfield, featured {{convert|6|ft|m|adj=on}} painted [[Sneaker (footwear)|basketball shoes]] commemorating the city's history as birthplace of basketball and home of the Hall of Fame. Each of the nineteen shoes was painted by a local artist and displayed in a prominent location in the downtown area, with the overall goal of providing an artistic answer to the question âWhat Makes Springfield Great?â&lt;ref name=&quot;cityofspringfield&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Art &amp; Soles Giant Sneakers|url=http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/COS/20100708-sneakers.0.html|publisher=City of Springfield|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shoes were sold at auction in March 2011 with the proceeds going to support public art in Springfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;artandsoles&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Art &amp; Soles â Springfield, MA|url=http://www.artandsolesspringfield.com/index.php|publisher=Art &amp; Soles Public Art Project|accessdate=16 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mclaughlin-artandsoles&gt;{{cite web|last=McLaughlin|first=Suzanne|title=Auction of 6-foot fiberglass sneakers deemed a success for Springfield|url=http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/03/auction_of_6-foot_fiberglass_sneakers_springfield.html|work=The Republican|accessdate=5 March 2011|location=Springfield, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The great floods of 1936 and 1938 and their effects===
In 1936, at the height of America's [[Great Depression]], the City of Springfield suffered one of its most devastating natural disasters prior to the tornadoes of 2011. The Connecticut River flooded, reaching record heights, inundating the South End and the North End neighborhoods, where some of Springfield's finest mansions stood. Damages were estimated at [[United States dollar|$]]200,000,000 in 1936 dollars.

Much of the water damage was repaired after [[Works Progress Administration|WPA]] money was made available to Springfield. However, two years later, high flood waters hit Springfield again. The standing flood waters were exacerbated by the [[New England Hurricane of 1938]], which came up the east coast of the United States on September 21, 1938.

Due to Springfield's two Great Floods, large portions of the North End and South End neighborhoods no longer exist.

During the 1960s, [[I-91]] was constructed over the areas affected by the great floods. Several of Springfield's grandest houses, including the mansion of skating blade magnate Everett Hosmer Barney, were demolished  to construct the highway.&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonroads.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-91_MA/ Interstate 91-Massachusetts]&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, plans called for the highway to be routed along the west bank of the Connecticut River, through West Springfield; however, Springfield civic officials campaigned for it to cross the river through the North End, Metro Center, and South End neighborhoods. This decision effectively cut off the City of Springfield from the Connecticut River, its greatest natural resource.&lt;ref name=&quot;bostonroads.com&quot;/&gt; In 2010, plans were announced to finally reunite Springfield with the Connecticut River.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield-ma.gov&quot;&gt;http://www.springfield-ma.gov/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/1200_Hall_of_Fame_Building_Plans/Springfield_TAP_Presentation_FINAL_diagrams.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forty year decline and immigration trends===
[[File:Springfield-MA.jpg|thumb|200px|A portion of Springfield's skyline during the 1990s. Crime peaked in Springfield in 1997; however, the last 4 years of the 2000s decade saw Springfield's lowest crime rates since 1985.]]
In 1968, the theretofore stalwart [[Springfield Armory]] was shockingly and controversially closed-down amid the [[Vietnam War]]. From this point onward, precision manufacturing companies, which had long provided Springfield's economic base and were also the driving factor behind its famous creativity, left the city for places with lower taxes. (As of 2011, there are 36,300 manufacturing jobs in Metro Springfield). &lt;ref name=&quot;sdplotkin.com&quot;/&gt;  During this time of decline, unlike its Northeast American peer cities like [[Providence, Rhode Island]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut]], which hemorrhaged large portions of their populations, Springfield lost comparatively few residents. As of 2011, Springfield had only 20,000 fewer people than it did in its most populous Census year, 1960. (See population chart below). The exodus of its wealthy and middle-class - mostly Caucasians - to surrounding suburbs was compensated for by an influx of [[Hispanic]] immigrants, which changed the demographics of Springfield to a great extent by the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]]. Springfield, which had once been a primarily-Caucasian city, (featuring large populations of English, Irish, Italian, French Canadian, and Polish residents) with a steady 15% Black minority is now evenly split between Caucasians and Hispanics, primarily of [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] decent. Initially poor on arrival in Springfield, the Hispanic community's integration and subsequent increase in buying power set the stage for Springfield's resurgence in the first decade of the 21st century.

In addition to the influx of Latinos, as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], Springfield is one of the top five most populous East Coast cities for [[Vietnam]]ese immigrants â and one of the Top 3 East Coast cities for Vietnamese immigrants per capita, behind Boston and Washington, D.C. Also, the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] indicated a substantial increase in Springfield's [[LGBT]] population, likely catalyzed by Massachusetts' 2004 decision to legalize [[gay marriage]]. The 2010 Census indicates that Springfield now ranks tenth among all U.S. cities with 5.69 same-sex couples per thousand. (San Francisco, California ranked first). &lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress1&quot;&gt;[https://luxmillionaire.wordpress.com/2010/12/06/america%E2%80%99s-gay-friendly-cities/#comment-135 Americaâs Gay Friendly Cities Â« Lux Millionaire]&lt;/ref&gt; Since approximately 2005, Springfield's [[Club Quarter]] in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] has seen a large increase in LGBT bars and clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bobmeyers.com/gay_springfield.htm Gay Springfield]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;fhttp://glbtspringfield.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Interstate 91 is constructed, amputating Springfield from the river====

During the late 1950s, the elevated, 8-lane [[Interstate 91]] was constructed on Springfield's riverfront - effectively blocking Springfielders' access to &quot;The Great River.&quot; For generations, the land that became Interstate 91 was the city's most valuable land for both economic and recreational purposes. The I-91 construction also covered the mouth of the [[Mill River (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Mill River]]. Academics note that both rivers would present major economic opportunities if I-91 was altered. &lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=larp_ms_projects&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22miracle%20mile%20springfield%20mill%20river%22&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the Urban Land Institute proposed a plan for Springfield to reclaim its rivers. &lt;ref name=&quot;springfield-ma.gov&quot;/&gt;

The original plan for Interstate 91 - detailed in the ''1953 Master Highway Plan for the Springfield, Massachusetts, Metropolitan Area'' - called for I-91 to occupy [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]]'s Riverdale Road, (also known as [[U.S. Route 5]]), and which had been, historically, the highway used to reach Springfield from both the north and south. Indeed, between 1953 and 1958, to make way for Interstate 91, West Springfield's Riverdale Road was widened and added on to, and businesses were moved. The 1953 plan called for I-91 to connect with Springfield via several state-of-the-art bridges. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-91_MA/&lt;/ref&gt; In 1958, however, Springfield's city planners - believing that the river had become too polluted, and thus no longer useful - campaigned intensely for Interstate 91 to occupy Springfield's riverfront. They boasted that the construction of [[I-91]] on Springfield's riverfront would catalyze economic growth comparable to that experienced during the great railroad expansion of the mid-19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;chronos-historical.org&quot;&gt;http://www.chronos-historical.org/highway/06.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, the highway that blocks Springfield's (now clean) rivers became the city's most famous and disastrous attempt at [[urban renewal]]. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Although West Springfield had a right and legal claim to Interstate 91, State highway officials relented to Springfield's City Planners' pressures when confronted with a technicality - a short, existing section of US 5 through West Springfield that was built during the early 1950s failed to meet Interstate design standards. Thus, the plans for I-91 were shelved in West Springfield, and hastily moved to the eastern bank of the river.

From its construction until the present, Interstate 91's design flaws have contributed to logistical problems in Springfield. Due to I-91's close proximity to both Springfield's densely built downtown and the city's rail lines and riverfront, no more than a few businesses could be built to capitalize on highway traffic. Thus, Springfield never received the promised economic benefit from I-91 - indeed, the highway's construction coincided with the start of Springfield's four decades of economic decline. Also, throughout Springfield, I-91 was constructed as an elevated highway, which blocked all riverfront views in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|downtown]]. Beneath the elevated highway, the City of Springfield's largest parking garage was constructed at 1756 spaces, as were a series of stone walls and grassy knolls, which have made the riverfront difficult to access by foot. &lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=larp_grad_research&amp;sei-redir=1#search=&quot;91+north+end+umass+cut+off&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1007&amp;context=larp_ms_projects&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22miracle%20mile%20springfield%20mill%20river%22&lt;/ref&gt;

The highway construction sliced through three of Springfield's most (theretofore) most desirable neighborhoods and many historical landmarks - among them, [[Court Square]], [[Forest Park (Springfield)|Forest Park]], and the Everett Hosmer Barney Mansion. In addition, the loss of Springfield's riverfront and the ugliness of the elevated Interstate 91 contributed to [[white flight]] from the city to its suburbs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hartfordspringfieldnews.com/entity/profile/knowledge-corridor/&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, the word &quot;stupid&quot; has been used to describe Springfield's first, and most unfortunate attempt at urban renewal. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

In 2010, the Urban Land Institute released a plan that proposed several different options for re-configuring Interstate 91. Currently, many Springfielders are enthused at the prospect of finally being reunited with the Mill River, and especially the Connecticut River.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfield-ma.gov&quot;/&gt;

====History of Springfield's skyline====
[[File:IMG 0352.JPG|thumb|200px|right|A portion of Springfield's skyline, as seen from the west side of the Connecticut River.]]
''See: [[List of tallest buildings in Springfield, Massachusetts]]''

As of 2011, Springfield's skyline features relatively fewer skyscrapers than most of its peer cities. The reason for this has to do with the 1908 construction of Springfield's [[Neoclassical architecture|neo-classical]] 1200 Main Street building, also known as 101 State Street. The building stands at {{convert|125|ft|m}}, which, at the time of its construction, caused great controversy in both Springfield and Boston because of its &quot;extreme height.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;emporis.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=1200mainstreetbuilding-springfield-ma-usa&amp;lng=3 1200 Main Street, Springfield, U.S.A. &amp;#124; Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt; That year, the [[Massachusetts State Legislature]] set a maximum height for buildings in Springfield â at {{convert|125|ft|m}} â the height of 1200 Main Street, and also the height of [[Court Square]]'s Old First Church's steeple.&lt;ref name=&quot;emporis.com&quot;/&gt; The only exception to this law was made for the construction of Springfield's landmark, {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}}, Italianate, Campanile â part of the [[Springfield Municipal Group]], dedicated in 1913 by President [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=springfieldmunicipalgroupcampanile-springfield-ma-usa&amp;lng=3 Springfield Municipal Group Campanile, Springfield, U.S.A. &amp;#124; Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Springfield's building height law remained in effect until 1970, when the city's economy began to falter, and residents started to complain that Springfield looked &quot;old-fashioned.&quot; In response to this, the city's 62-year-old building height law was abolished, and renowned architect [[Pietro Belluschi]] designed Tower Square in the [[brutalist]], [[International style (architecture)|International style]], popular at the time. Tower Square stands at just over {{convert|370|ft|m}}. In 1987, the Monarch Life Insurance Company constructed Springfield's {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on}} tall), [[post-modern]] Monarch Place. During the building's construction, the Monarch Life Insurance Company filed for [[bankruptcy]]; however, the graceful, mirrored tower still bears the former company's name despite being owned by [[Peter Pan Bus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporis.com/application/?nav=building&amp;id=monarchplace-springfield-ma-usa&amp;lng=3 Monarch Place, Springfield, U.S.A. &amp;#124; Emporis.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2011, the {{convert|400|ft|m|adj=on}} Monarch Place remains Springfield's tallest skyscraper; however, the city's lack of numerous skyscrapers is now looked on as a positive trait by city advisors such as the [[Urban Land Institute]], who write that Springfield's &quot;Metro Center now stands out from its peers, most of which long ago demolished the human-scale architecture that made their downtowns livable.&quot; During Springfield's resurgence in the new millennium, prominent architects â like [[Moshe Safdie]], who built the $57 million, 2008 U.S. Federal Court Building; [[Gwathmey Siegel &amp; Associates]], who built the $47 million, 2004 Basketball Hall of Fame; and [[TRO Jung Brannen]], who are building the $110 million, 2012 adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School â adapted to Springfield's human-scale to a create monumental buildings rather than attempting to &quot;achieve monumentalism through over-scaling,&quot; as has happened in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldarchitecturenews.com/index.php?fuseaction=wanappln.projectview&amp;upload_id=10708 United States Federal Courthouse, Safdie Architects, world architecture news, architecture jobs]&lt;/ref&gt; With energy prices rising, Springfield's 1908 building height limit now seems like an idea that was far ahead of its time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thedailyrecord.com/2010/03/23/urban-development-author-skyscrapers-are-over/ Â» Urban development author: âSkyscrapers are overâ ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finance board: 2004â2009===

Springfield began experiencing fiscal trouble during the 1980s; however, the city's finances nearly collapsed in the first decade of the 21st century with budget shortfalls of approximately $40 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;uml.edu&quot;/&gt; City and state officials disagreed over the crisis' causes. The State blamed overspending relative to income by the City. City officials blamed inequities in the ways additional assistance appropriations were allocated to Springfield relative to other Massachusetts cities. Both sides were correct. Springfield was overspending relative to its income, as the Commonwealth claimed. However, Springfield officials were also correct â for every $287.66 per capita in additional assistance appropriations allocated to Boston, $176.37 per capita were allocated to Cambridge, $67.50 per capita were allocated to Worcester, and a mere $12.04 per capita were allocated to Springfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;springfieldcityhall.com&quot;&gt;http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/Springfieldpanel.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from overspending and gross inequities in State funding, other observers of Springfield's fiscal crisis noted a weak economy, years of incompetent management, and corruption in city government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usairwaysmag.com/profile_series/Springfield/02_SPR_Word_of_Mouth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's financial problems had already resulted in wage freezes for city workers, cuts in city services, layoffs, and various city fee increases; however, on June 30, 2004, the [[Massachusetts General Court]] granted control of the city (including financial, personnel, and real estate matters) to the Springfield Finance Control Board. The Board was composed of three appointees by the State Secretary of Administration and Finance, Springfield's Mayor, and the President of the City Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/COS/index.php?id=control_board City of Springfield, Mass.: Control Board].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/?pageID=sfcbhomepage&amp;L=1&amp;L0=Home&amp;sid=Asfcb Springfield Finance Control Board].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Financial Control Board (FCB) operated under the overall direction of the State Secretary of Finance and Administration. The FCB legislation included a state loan of $52 million to be paid back with future city tax receipts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/legis/laws/seslaw04/sl040169.htm Chapter 169 of the Acts of 2004, Massachusetts General Court].&lt;/ref&gt; A $20 million grant was originally included, but then-[[Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Thomas Finneran]] eliminated that section, fearing it would invite fiscal irresponsibility among other municipalities.

The original FCB bill filed by then-[[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] included a suspension of Massachusetts General Law Chapter 150E, the state law that defines the collective bargaining process for public employees. (State employees are not covered by federal labor laws). Opposition from unions eliminated that section.

During the first several years of the Financial Control Board, officials concentrated on &quot;controlling personnel costs,&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;uml.edu&quot;/&gt; However, in 2006 the FCB hired the [[Urban Land Institute]] to study Springfield and then conceive a viable plan for the city's revitalization. The ULI's study and subsequent 'Plan for Springfield' resulted in significant improvements throughout Springfield's Metro Center, a dramatic citywide drop-off in crime, and a viable course for the city's continued resurgence.

On June 30, 2009, the State of Massachusetts disbanded the Finance Control Board and returned financial control to the City of Springfield

===Resurgence: 2007âpresent===

From approximately 2007 until 2011, the City of Springfield has benefitted from large-scale investments and construction projects, which have begun to renew the city's traditionally robust civic pride. For example, as of 2011, there are over $1.3 billion in infrastructure, healthcare, and other private construction projects in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]], and over $300 million in medical construction in the [[North End, Springfield, Massachusetts|North End]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ctmirror.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.ctmirror.org/story/11451/lahood0209 LaHood: Obama's rail initiative could benefit New Haven-Springfield line &amp;#124; The Connecticut Mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs3springfield.com&quot;&gt;http://www.cbs3springfield.com/news/local/Baystate-gets-the-OK-for-new-Emergency-Department----115747084.html {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.massdevelopment.com/real-estate-development/development-projects/1550-main-street-springfield/ MassDevelopment Â» 1550 Main Street, Springfield]&lt;/ref&gt; Metro Center has seen the construction of numerous, new buildings, (e.g., architect [[Moshe Safdie]]'s $57 million new Federal Courthouse;) &lt;ref&gt;http://www.msafdie.com/#/projects/unitedstatesfederalcourthouse_springfield {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the adaptive re-use of several historic buildings, (e.g., the $110 million adaptive re-use of Springfield's original Technical High School into Massachusetts' new, high-tech Data Center;) &lt;ref&gt;[http://baystatehealth.com/AcademicAffairs/Main+Nav/About+Us/News/Springfield+Area+News/$110+Million+State-of-the-art+Springfield+Data+Center+Slated+to+Open+May+2012 $110 Million State-of-the-art Springfield Data Center Slated to Open May 2012 - Baystate Health]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/demolition_of_springfield_tech_high_school.html Demolition of former Springfield Tech High School under way (photos and video) &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; and renovations to numerous structures, (e.g., the $75 million renovation of Springfield's 1926 Union Station into an intermodal transportation center for buses and trains). &lt;ref name=&quot;wwlp.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampden/Union-Station-project-gets-75-million Union Station project gets $75 million &amp;#124; WWLP.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The North End continues to benefit from the construction of [[Baystate Health]]'s &quot;Hospital of the Future&quot; â a $300 million, private construction project that will add over 550 new doctors to the facility â expected to be complete in 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs3springfield.com&quot;/&gt;

====Sharp decrease in crime====
Since 1997, U.S. and local crime statistics indicate that Springfield has experienced a sharp decrease in both violent crime and property crime, with both falling over 50%. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/the_numbers_game.html&lt;/ref&gt; From its heights in the late 1990s, by 2007 Springfield's violent crime rate had fallen by 14%, and its property crime rate had fallen by 9%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/204.0.html Court Square Springfield, Mass.: City Information]&lt;/ref&gt; The years 2007, 2008, 2009, and 2010 were Springfield's four safest years since 1985, at the dawn of the crack cocaine outbreak in the 1980s. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/09/the_numbers_game.html&lt;/ref&gt; Independent sources also note Springfield's dramatic decrease in criminal activity, including

====Private economic revitalization====
Since 2007, Springfield has prospered economically relative to most cities - despite what the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' has called &quot;the worst American economic crisis since the [[Great Depression]]&quot; - because it features a diversified, &quot;mature&quot; economy, and also because it continues to see increasing private investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB122169431617549947.html | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jon | last=Hilsenrath | title=Worst Crisis Since '30s, With No End Yet in Sight | date=September 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Urban Land Institute]]'s 2006 &quot;Plan for Springfield,&quot; private investments have included [[Baystate Health]]'s $300 million &quot;Hospital of the Future,&quot; currently the most expensive construction project in [[New England]], (as of 2011). &lt;ref name=&quot;cbs3springfield.com&quot;/&gt; It has been reported that, on its completion in 2012, Baystate will hire 550 new doctors, approximately doubling the hospital's current capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/02/baystate_medical_center_buildi.html Baystate Medical Center building $251 million 'Hospital of the Future' in Springfield &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, [[Springfield College]] constructed a $45 million multi-purpose university center,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/220.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Springfield College Wellness Center / Field House]&lt;/ref&gt; while  [[Western New England College|Western New England University]] constructed a $40 million new [[pharmacy school]]. In 2008, the [[Performance Food Group]] constructed a $30 million facility in the [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] Park; and in 2011, [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] announced that it will increase its employee base in Springfield by 225, bringing its total over 1100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/12/smith_wesson_to_move_225_jobs_springfield_thompson_center.html Smith &amp; Wesson to move 225 jobs to Springfield from Rochester, N.H., operation &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2011, MassDevelopment and various private entities contributed approximately $11 million to renovate the former Federal Courthouse at 1550 Main Street into offices for Baystate Health, the Springfield School Board, and others. Across from the recently renovated [[MassMutual Center]], in 2011, [[Holiday Inn]] will, it has been reported, invest over $5 million in renovating a 100-year-old, architecturally significant [[Greek Revival]] tower on State Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/04/springfield_redevelopment_auth_1.html Springfield Redevelopment Authority OKs plans for Holiday Inn Express at former Epiphany Tower &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in the [[Club Quarter]] in north [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]], The [[Julia Sanderson Theater]] â most recently known as The Hippodrome, and originally named The Paramount â will once again be named The Paramount Theater after it receives a $1.725 million renovation to become a concert venue, coffee shop, and upscale Spanish restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2011/03/editorial_heriberto_flores_a_b.html Editorial: Heriberto Flores a big believer in Springfield &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, ''[[This Old House]]'' magazine named Springfield's Forest Park and Forest Park Heights the Northeast's best &quot;old house neighborhoods,&quot; citing their attractive, Victorian homes and relatively inexpensive prices.&lt;ref name=&quot;thisoldhouse.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.thisoldhouse.com/toh/photos/0,,20343297_20738500,00.html Forest Park Heights Historic District, Springfield, Massachusetts &amp;#124; Best Old House Neighborhoods 2010: the Northeast &amp;#124; Photos &amp;#124; Home &amp; Real Estate &amp;#124; This O...]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] moved its Urban Design graduate program to [[Court Square]] in Metro Center.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.masslive.com/breakingnews/print.html?entry=/2010/05/umass_design_center_at_springf.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, UMass-Amherst announced that it would move its popular radio station [[WFCR]] to Springfield's Main Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/business-news/index.ssf/2011/05/public_radio_station_wfcr_plans_move_to.html Public radio station WFCR-FM plans move from Amherst to Springfield &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the Urban Land Institute released its plan to develop Springfield's most economically and recreationally valuable real estate, the Connecticut Riverfront. The ULI's Plan includes recreational space, a fountain, an ice-skating rink, and mixed-use residential/commercial development aimed to compliment the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], which is located on the riverfront.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfield-ma.gov/planning/riverfront.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Riverfront]&lt;/ref&gt; The main obstacle to Springfield's riverfront development remains â as it has since the early 1970s â the inhibiting location, height, and additional developments surrounding [[Interstate 91]] - a jumble of elevated highways that cut off Springfield from the Connecticut River and the Basketball Hall of Fame, and economically inhibits development opportunities for both.&lt;ref&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1004&amp;context=larp_grad_research&amp;sei-redir=1#search=&quot;91+north+end+umass+cut+off&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Reconstructing I-91 in the upcoming years will, in the opinions of numerous academics and urban planners, catalyze development along Springfield's riverfront, as well as reunite the city with its &quot;great river;&quot; however, as of 2011, viable plans have yet to materialize.

====Transportation infrastructure boom====
The largest monetary investments in Springfield have occurred in transportation infrastructure, including a $1 billion investment &lt;ref name=&quot;ctmirror.org&quot;/&gt; shared with the State of Connecticut in the [[New Haven-Hartford-Springfield commuter rail line]]. According to NHHSRail, the project's oversight body, Springfield-New Haven high speed commuter rail will be fully functional by 2015, featuring a northern terminus at Springfield's Union Station and a southern terminus at New Haven's Union Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhhsrail.com/ New Haven - Hartford - Springfield Rail Project]&lt;/ref&gt; It is reported that trains will reach speeds of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, making the Springfield-New Haven intercity line the first truly &quot;high speed train&quot; in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctpost.com/news/article/State-could-have-first-high-speed-rail-line-in-463027.php State could have first high-speed rail line in the nation - Connecticut Post]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nhhsrail.com/stay_informed/press_releases.aspx {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, Springfield's Union Station will receive a $75 million renovation to become an &quot;intermodal transportation center&quot;, i.e., [[Peter Pan Bus]], [[Greyhound Bus]], and the [[PVTA]] will move to a new building constructed across the street from the current facility, directly adjacent to Union Station.&lt;ref name=&quot;wwlp.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/04/springfield_union_station_work.html Springfield Union Station work on track for summer 2012 &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in 2011, a $70 million construction will begin on the Knowledge Corridor intercity commuter line, with a southern terminus at Springfield's Union Station and a northern terminus in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]]. The Knowledge Corridor intercity commuter line will enable train commuting to and from northern [[Pioneer Valley]] cities like [[Northampton, Massachusetts]] and [[Greenfield, Massachusetts]] â ending the area's dependence on auto transportation. From Vermont, travelers will be able to access [[Montreal]], Canada. To aid in car and pedestrian transportation, $21 million renovations were made both to the State Street and Main Street Corridors â both [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] streets received new, ornate street lamps and artistic walkways.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/paving.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Main Street Improvement Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Springfield, as a whole, is considered to have &quot;above average&quot; [[walkability]]; however, according to Walkscore.com, Springfield's Metro Center neighborhood ranks among the most walkable in the United States. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Springfield&lt;/ref&gt; The Urban Land Institute, among other organizations, have noted that downtown Springfield's high walkability could catalyze even more urban gentrification. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfield-ma.gov/planning/riverfront.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Riverfront]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Springfield tornado of June 1, 2011===

{{Main|2011 New England tornado outbreak}}

On June 1, 2011, at approximately 4:45pm, the City of Springfield was directly hit by a tornado with wind speeds estimated at {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, (a high-end EF3 on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]), which, according to the [[National Weather Service]], was the 2nd largest ever to have hit New England â the 1953 tornado in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] was slightly larger.&lt;ref&gt;name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/national_weather_service_confi.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration]] called the Springfield Tornado &quot;very significant... Noted not only for its intensity but also for the length of its continuous damage path â approximately 39&amp;nbsp;miles. The tornado was also very wide at some points, reaching a maximum width of one-half mile.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;noaa1&quot;&gt;[http://www.erh.noaa.gov/box/sigevents/jun01_2011_summary.php Massachusetts Tornado Outbreak Summary - National Weather Service Forecast Office in Taunton, MA]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Massachusetts Governor [[Deval Patrick]], Springfielders were given only 10&amp;nbsp;minutes, warning that a tornado was approaching the densely populated city. CNN delayed warning of the impending tornado due to a live interview with New York Congressman [[Anthony Weiner]], who was discussing explicit photographs of himself that he had posted online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afterthepress.com/?p=509 wiener bumps springfield tornado on CNN 4 deaths &amp;#124; After the Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldweatherpost.com/2011/06/02/a-10-minute-warning-before-the-twister-hit/ {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Springfield Tornado disaster]] left four people dead, hundreds of people suffering in hospitals with injuries ranging from lightening strikes to trauma, and over 500 people homeless in the City of Springfield alone, most of whom stayed at the [[MassMutual Center]] arena and convention center.&lt;ref name=&quot;wggb1&quot;&gt;[http://www.wggb.com/story/14943481/helping-homeless-tornado-victims Helping Homeless Tornado Victims - WGGB abc40/FOX 6: News, Weather, Sports: Springfield, MA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive1&quot;&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/springfield_tornado_death_toll.html Springfield tornado death toll at 3; Massachusetts Congressional delegation appeals to President Obama for disaster declaration &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Over two weeks after the disaster, more than 250 people were still living at the [[MassMutual Center]], homeless.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwlp.com/dpp/news/local/hampden/hundreds-still-homeless-after-tornadoes Hundreds still homeless after tornadoes &amp;#124; WWLP.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Springfield Tornado crossed over the [[Connecticut River]] from [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] into the City of Springfield near the [[Springfield Memorial Bridge]].&lt;ref name=&quot;noaa1&quot;/&gt; First, the tornado caused extensive damage to Springfield's [[Connecticut River Walk Park]], deforesting much of the park's formerly lush tree canopy and removing large sections of its attractive wrought-iron fencing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://community.railstotrails.org/blogs/trailblog/archive/2011/06/03/tornado-damages-springfield-riverwalk-in-massachusetts.aspx Tornado Damages Connecticut River Walk in Springfield, Mass. - RTC TrailBlog - Rails-to-Trails Conservancy]&lt;/ref&gt; Next it damaged [[Court Square]] â Springfield's historic center â ripping off parts of the Old First Church (established in 1637), and uprooting approximately half of [[Court Square]]'s 200-year-old &quot;heritage trees.&quot; Then the tornado proceeded southward down Main Street, devastating Springfield's historically Italian [[South End, Springfield, Massachusetts|South End]]. In less two minutes, much of the South End's commercial district â built more than a century ago and consisting of mostly brick, commercial buildings â lay in complete ruins, while the South End's recent improvements, e.g. new ornate, street lamps, were either bent or flung far from their places of origin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gazettenet.com/2011/06/02/governor-patrick-sen-kerry-survey-destruction-in-western-massachusetts Governor Patrick, Sen.

After devastating the South End, the tornado moved east and headed up historic Maple Street, on and around which it caused significant damage. It seriously damaged the campus of [[MacDuffie School]]. Less than a mile eastward, large setions of [[Springfield College]] and the [[Old Hill, Springfield, Massachusetts|Old Hill]] neighborhood were completely destroyed, as were hundreds of homes in [[East Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|East Forest Park]], an upper-middle class neighborhood. East Forest Park's [[Cathedral High School (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Cathedral High School]] was completely ravaged by the tornado.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2011/06/after_tornado_springfield_diocese_searching.html Springfield Diocese searching for temporary home for Cathedral High School, St. Michael's middle school &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the experience with these tornadoes, Springfield College's twelfth (and incumbent) president [[Dr. Richard B.

However, Sixteen Acres' newer homes did not weather the tornado any better than did Springfield's famous Victorians. The East Forest Park and Sixteen Acres neighborhoods remained without power for days.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive1&quot;/&gt; In Springfield, the tornado completely destroyed over 100 homes, made countless others structurally unsound or uninhabitable, and caused other structures deemed hazardous to be quickly demolished.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/us/03tornado.html Massachusetts Tornado Survivors Describe Storm - NYTimes.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately following the Springfield tornado, Governor Deval Patrick declared a &quot;State of Emergency&quot; for the entire Commonwealth of Massachusetts. That day, United States Senator from Massachusetts [[John F. Kerry]] cited city damages as &quot;astronomical... well beyond tens of millions of dollars.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive1&quot;/&gt; As of June 18, 2011, there have been over $140 million in tornado-related insurance claims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/06/16/mass-tornado-claims-rise-more-funding-offered/ Mass.

==Geography==
[[File:Springfield ma from space.jpg|200px|thumb|The [[Knowledge Corridor]] surrounding Springfield from space.]]
Springfield is located at {{Coord|42|6|45|N|72|32|51|W|city}} (42.112411, â72.547455).{{Geographic reference|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|33.2|sqmi|km2}} of which {{convert|32.1|sqmi|km2}} is land and {{convert|1.1|sqmi|km2}} (3.31%) is water. Over 4 sq. mi of Springfield's land area is parkland, (over 12% of its total land area.) &lt;ref&gt;http://choosespringfieldmass.com/amenities.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Springfield sits on the eastern bank of the [[Connecticut River]], near confluence of two major tributary rivers: the western [[Westfield River]], which flows into the Connecticut across from Springfield's South End Bridge; and the eastern [[Chicopee River]], which flows into the Connecticut les than 0.5miles north of Springfield, in the bordering city of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]. Springfield lies just {{convert|4|mi|km}} north of the Connecticut state-line. It is located in the fertile [[Connecticut River Valley]], surrounded by mountains, bluffs, and rolling hills in all directions. Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] and Main Street, which follow the north-south trajectory of the Connecticut River, are fairly low and flat; however, they become hilly and feature prominent bluffs as one moves south and eastward.

Springfield's 2nd most prominent topographical feature is the city's {{convert|735|acre|km2}} [[Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|Forest Park]], designed by renowned landscape architect [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]. Forest Park lies in the southwestern corner of the city, surrounded by Springfield's attractive garden districts Forest Park and [[Forest Park Heights Historic District|Forest Park Heights]], which feature over 600 Victorian [[Painted ladies|Painted Lady]] mansions. Forest Park also borders Western Massachusetts' most affluent town, [[Longmeadow, Massachusetts]]. Springfield shares borders with other well-heeled suburbs such as [[East Longmeadow, Massachusetts|East Longmeadow]], [[Wilbraham, Massachusetts|Wilbraham]], [[Ludlow, Massachusetts|Ludlow]] and the de-industrializing city of [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee]]. The small cities of [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] and [[West Springfield, Massachusetts]] lie less than one miles (1.6 km) across the Connecticut River from Springfield's Metro Center.

Springfield owns Cobble Mountain Reservoir and its water supply - one of the United States' purest - located in the towns of [[Blandford, Massachusetts|Blandford]], [[Granville, Massachusetts|Granville]] and [[Russell, Massachusetts|Russell]], respectively, at the western edge of Hampden County. It also owns Franconia Golf Course, located partly in Springfield, but mostly in East Longmeadow.

===Climate===
Springfield, like other cities in southern New England, has a [[humid continental climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|KÃ¶ppen]]: ''Dfa'') with four distinct seasons and precipitation evenly distributed throughout the year. Weather conditions vary by season. Winters are cold with an average January high temperature of {{convert|36|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and an average low of {{convert|18|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}. During Winter, [[nor'easter]] storms can drop significant [[snowfall]]s on Springfield and the [[Connecticut River Valley]]. Temperatures below {{convert|0|Â°F|Â°C}} can occur each year; however, Springfield's geographic position in the [[Connecticut River Valley]], next to several bodies of water, protected by mountains and bluffs, in general moderates the city's weather so that, on average, Springfield's temperature is 1&amp;nbsp;Â°F warmer than the cities of [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut]], both of which are south Springfield.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather1&quot;&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/events/weddings/setthedate/average/compare?from=wed_setdate_compare&amp;clocid1=USMA0405&amp;clocid2=USCT0094 Wedding Planner - Set the Date, Climate Comparision for Springfield, MA and Hartford, CT]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/events/weddings/setthedate/average/compare?from=wed_setdate_compare&amp;clocid1=USMA0405&amp;clocid2=USCT0135 Wedding Planner - Set the Date, Climate Comparision for Springfield, MA and New Haven, CT]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Springfield does not experience the high snowfall amounts and blustery wind averages of nearby cities like [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] and [[Albany, New York]].

Springfield's summers are warm and sometimes humid. During summer, several times per month, on hot days afternoon [[thunderstorms]] will develop when unstable warm air collides with approaching [[cold front]]s. Springfield's average July high temperature is {{convert|85|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}} and its average low is {{convert|63|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;weather1&quot;/&gt; Usually several days during the summer exceed {{convert|90|Â°F|Â°C}}, constituting a &quot;[[heat wave]].&quot; Spring and fall temperatures are usually pleasant, with mild days and crisp, cool nights. Precipitation averages {{convert|42.3|in|mm}} annually and snowfall averages {{convert|49.7|in|cm}}, most of which falls from mid-December to early-March. Although not unheard of, extreme weather events like [[hurricanes]] and [[tornado]]es occur infrequently in Springfield compared with other areas in the United States and New England. On the occasions that hurricanes have hit New England, Springfield's inland, upriver location has caused its damages to be considerably less than shoreline cities like [[New Haven, Connecticut]] and [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. On June 1, 2011, Springfield was directly hit by the second largest tornado ever to hit Massachusetts.&lt;ref name=&quot;noaa1&quot;/&gt; With wind speeds exceeding {{convert|160|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}, the [[2011 Springfield tornado]] left 4 dead, hundreds injured, and over 500 homeless in the City of Springfield alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;wggb1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/four-dead-in-springfield-tornadoes Four dead in Springfield tornadoes &amp;#124; WTNH.com Connecticut]&lt;/ref&gt; The tornado caused hundreds of millions of dollars worth of damage to Springfield and destroyed nearly everything in a {{convert|39|mi|km|adj=on}} path from [[Westfield, Massachusetts]] to [[Charlton, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;noaa1&quot;/&gt; It was the first deadly tornado to strike Massachusetts since May 29, 1995.

==Economy==

[[File:Smith &amp; Wesson Mod.29.jpg|thumb|200px|Smith &amp; Wesson is headquartered in Springfield.]]

Springfield's Top Five Industries (in order, by number of workers) are: Trade and Transportation; Education and Health Services; Manufacturing; Tourism and Hospitality; and Government. Springfield is considered to have a &quot;mature economy,&quot; which protects the city to a degree during recessions and inhibits it somewhat during bubbles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jonathanmelleonpolitics.blogspot.com/2007/11/smitty-pignatelli-top-down-politics-of.html Jonathan Melle on Politics: Shitty Pignatelli - Top Down Politics of the BANAL! Also see Denis Guyer &amp; Andrea Nuciforo &amp; Carmen Massimiano]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, Springfield is considered to have one of America's top emerging multi-cultural markets â the city features a 33% Latino population with buying power that has increased over 295% from 1990â2006. More than 60% of Hispanic Springfielders have arrived during the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.davidsonmediagroup.com/Stations/MAPS/DMG%20Springfield%204-07.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

With 25 universities and colleges within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of Springfield, (both north and south), including several of America's most prestigious universities and [[liberal arts colleges]], and more than six institutions within the city itself, the [[Hartford-Springfield]] metropolitan area has been dubbed the [[Knowledge Corridor]] by regional educators, civic authorities, and businessmen â touting its 32 universities and [[liberal arts colleges]], numerous highly regarded hospitals, and nearly 120,000 students. The Knowledge Corridor universities and colleges provide the region with an educated workforce, which yields a yearly GDP of over $100 billion â more than at least 16 U.S. States. Recently, Hartford-Springfield has become home to a number of [[Biotechnology|biotech]] firms and high-speed computing centers. As of 2009 Springfield ranks as the 24th most important high-tech center in the United States with approximately 14,000 high-tech jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bizjournals.com/bizjournals/on-numbers/archive/americas-tech-centers.html | title=Americaâs top 100 high-tech centers | first=G.

As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], there were 153,060 people residing in the City of Springfield. This figure does not include many of the 17,000-plus undergraduate and graduate university students who reside in Springfield during the academic year.

According to the 2010 Census, there were 61,706 housing units in Springfield, of which 56,752 were occupied. This was the highest average of home occupancy among the four, distinct Western New England metropolises, (the other three being [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], and [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]].) Also, as of 2010, Springfield features the highest average home owner occupancy ratio among the four Western New England metropolises at 50% - 73,232 Springfielders live in owner-occupied units, versus 74,111 in rental units. By comparison, as of the 2010 Census, New Haven features an owner occupancy rate of 31%; Hartford of 26%; and Bridgeport of 43%. &lt;ref&gt;http://2010.census.gov/2010census/popmap/ipmtext.php#.TmHJRl3XahA&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Springfield had a population of 153,060, of which 72,573 (47.4%) were male and 80,487 (52.6%) were female. In terms of age, 73.0% were over 18 years old and 10.9% were over 65 years old; the median age is 32.2 years. The median age for males is 30.2 years and 34.1 years for females. 

In terms of race and ethnicity, Springfield is 51.8% White, 22.3% Black or African American, 0.6% American Indian and Alaska Native, 2.4% Asian (1.2% Vietnamese), 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 18.0% from Some Other Race, and 4.7% from Two or More Races (1.5% White and Black or African American; 1.0% White and Some Other Race). Hispanics and Latinos of any race made up 38.8% of the population (33.2% Puerto Rican). &lt;ref&gt;http://factfinder2.census.gov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=DEC_10_DP_DPDP1&amp;prodType=table&lt;/ref&gt; 


===Growing LGBT population: 2005âpresent===
In January 2010, the national [[LGBT]] magazine ''[[The Advocate]]'' rated Springfield #13 among its new &quot;15 Gayest ''Secondary'' Cities in America,&quot; ahead of [[San Diego, California]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advocate.com/Print_Issue/Travel/Gayest_Cities_in_America/ {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Springfield was the only Massachusetts city to make ''The Advocate's'' list.  Springfield's growing LGBT scene led ''The Rainbow Times'', the city's local gay newspaper, to declare Springfield &quot;suddenly and unexpectedly gay.&quot; ''The Advocate'' and ''The Rainbow Times'' cite a more accepting attitude from the younger generation, a bohemian arts scene and affordable Victorian architecture as reasons for the influx. Recently, ''The Rainbow Times'' noted that Springfield currently has as many LGBT exclusive nightlife establishments as the cities of Hartford and New Haven combined, (6). While a portion of Springfield's population remains politically moderate, its social climate is increasingly permissive. As of June 2011, the Springfield City Council seated its first openly LGBT city councilors in 2011 and the city hosted its first &quot;Gay Pride Week&quot; from June 8â16, 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive.com&quot;/&gt; In addition to praise from gay publications like ''The Advocate'' and ''The Rainbow Times'', in 2011, Springfield was rated one of the Top 10 secondary gay cities in America by [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]] statistics, which indicate that in the number of same-sex households per thousand. Springfield ranked #10, with 5.69 same-sex couples per thousand; Boston ranked #4 with 6.9 same-sex couples per thousand; and San Francisco ranked #1, with 12.4 same-sex couples per thousand â nearly double all other U.S. cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;wordpress1&quot;/&gt;

==Government==
===Courts and decline in crime: 2005âpresent===
Like every other municipality in Massachusetts, Springfield has no judicial branch itself. Rather, it uses the Springfield-based state courts, which include Springfield district court and Hampden County [[Massachusetts Superior Court|Superior Court]], both of which are based in Springfield. The [[United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts|Federal District Court]] also regularly hears cases in Springfield â now in an architecturally award-winning building on State Street, constructed in 2009.

During the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, Springfield experienced a wave of violent crime that negatively impacted the city's reputation, both regionally and nationally. At one point in the first decade of the 21st century, Springfield ranked as high as 18th in the United States' annual &quot;City Crime Rankings.&quot; Since approximately 2006, the City of Springfield has experienced a dramatic, (nearly 50%) drop-off in citywide crime. In 2010, Springfield ranked 35th in the United States' City Crime Rankings â its 2nd lowest ranking in recent years, (in 2009, it ranked 51st). Springfield's current crime rating of 142 is down approximately 50% from its heights in the late 1990s and first decade of the 21st century.&lt;ref name=&quot;cqpress1&quot;&gt;http://os.cqpress.com/citycrime/2010/City_crime_rate_2010-2011_hightolow.pdf {{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cities of  [[Hartford, Connecticut]] and [[New Haven, Connecticut]], both of which in 2007 were cited as &quot;resurgent&quot; cities that Springfield should seek to emulate by the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]], are now by nearly all statistical measures, significantly more dangerous than Springfield.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kansascityfed.org/eventinfo/community/kodrzycki-paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; (New Haven currently ranks 18th in the annual U.S. City Crime Rankings, and Hartford ranks 19th). &lt;ref name=&quot;cqpress1&quot;/&gt; The [[Urban Land Institute]] states that currently &quot;the perception of crime [in Springfield] appears to be worse than the reality.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.uli.org/~/media/Documents/ULIDifferentialContent/TAP_Report_Downtown_Springfd--FINAL11%206%2007%20pdf.ashx&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
{{See also|List of mayors of Springfield, Massachusetts}}
Springfield became a [[Government of Massachusetts#Form of government: city vs. town|city]] on May 25, 1852, by decree of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts Legislature]], after a decade-long internal dispute that resulted in the partition of Chicopee from Springfield, resulting in Springfield losing 2/5 of its population and - for a few short years - remaining a &quot;town&quot; as opposed to a &quot;city.&quot; Regardless of this internal debate, Springfield, like all municipalities in Massachusetts, enjoys limited [[home rule]]. The current [[charter|city charter]], in effect since 1959, uses a &quot;strong mayor&quot; government with most power concentrated in the [[mayor of Springfield, Massachusetts|mayor]], as in Boston and elsewhere. The mayor representing the city's executive branch presents the budget, appoints commissioners and department heads, and in general runs the city. The Mayor is former City Councilor Domenic Sarno, elected November 6, 2007 by a margin of 52.54% to 47.18% against incumbent Charles Ryan. He took office in January, 2008. In November 2009, Sarno won reelection.

The [[City Council]], consisting of nine members, is the city's legislative branch. Each of the members are elected at-large, along with the mayor, every odd numbered year. It passes the budget, authorizes bond sales, holds hearings, creates departments and commissions, and amends zoning laws. The city council appoints a president who becomes acting mayor should a vacancy occur in the office.

The mayor's office and city council chambers are in city hall â part of the [[Springfield Municipal Group|Municipal Group]] in downtown Springfield. The Finance Control Board met there as well.

===Switch to ward representation===
In the past, efforts have been made to provide each of the city's eight wards a seat in the city council, instead of the current at-large format. There would still be some at-large seats under this format. The primary argument for this has been that City Councilors currently live in only four of the city's wards. An initiative to change the composition failed to pass the City Council twice. In 2007 Mayor Charles V. Ryan and City Councilor Jose Tosedo proposed a home-rule amendment that would expand the council to thirteen members adding four seats to the existing nine member at large system, but allocated between eight ward and five at large seats. This home-rule petition was adopted by the City Council 8â1, and was later passed by the State Senate and House and signed by the Governor. On election day, November 6, 2007, city residents voted overwhelmingly in favor of changing the City Council and School Committee. The ballot initiative that established a new council with five at-large seats and eight ward seats passed 3â1. On November 3, 2009, Springfield held first-in-a-generation ward elections.

The results of the 2009 election were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/elections/2009-elections.html Springfield 2009 Election Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

Westfield was the first university in America to admit students without regard to sex, race, or economic status.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsc.ma.edu/prospective-students/undergraduate-admissions/after-you-apply/ After You Apply : Undergraduate Admissions : Prospective Students : Westfield State University]&lt;/ref&gt; Its current enrollment is approximately 6,000 students.

Just outside of Springfield's northern city limits is [[Elms College]], a fine [[Catholic]] university that for many years educated only women. Now Elms College is co-educational. Likewise, just {{convert|2|mi|km}} below Springfield's southern city limit in [[Longmeadow]] is the park-like campus of [[Bay Path College]], which once also admitted only women. Within the past decade, Bay Path has eased its restriction and started to admit men to certain programs.

===Community colleges===
In 1968, following the Pentagon's controversial closing of the [[Springfield Armory]], Springfielders founded [[Springfield Technical Community College]] on {{convert|35|acre|m2}} behind the Springfield Armory National Park. Springfield Technical Community College is the only &quot;technical&quot; community college in Massachusetts, and was founded to continue Springfield's traditional of technical innovation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shaysrebellion.stcc.edu/shaysapp/about/project.jsp Shays' Rebellion - About This Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Holyoke Community College]], {{convert|8|mi|km}} north of Springfield, is Greater Springfield's more traditional community college.

===Public schools (K-12)===
Springfield has the second largest school district in Massachusetts and in New England. It operates 38 elementary schools, six high schools, six middle schools (6â8) and seven specialized schools. The main high schools in the city include the High School of Commerce, [[Springfield Central High School]], [[Roger L Putnam Vocational-Technical High School]], and the [[Springfield High School of Science and Technology]], better known as Sci-Tech. There are also two charter secondary schools in the City of Springfield: SABIS International, which ranks among the top 5% of high schools nationally in academic quality, and the Hampden Charter School of Science The city School Committee recently {{When|date=October 2009}} passed a new neighborhood school program to improve schools and reduce the growing busing costs associated with the current plan. The plan faces stiff opposition from parents and minority groups who claim that the schools are still unequal. The city is required under a 1970s court order to balance schools racially, which had necessitated busing. However, since then, the city and the school's population has shifted and many of the neighborhoods are more [[Racial integration|integrated]], calling into question the need for busing at all. Though the plan is likely to be challenged in court, the state [[Board of Education]] decided it did not have authority to review it, sidestepping the volatile issue while effectively blessing it.

=== Private elementary===
The [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield in Massachusetts|Roman Catholic Diocese of Springfield]] operated five [[Catholic]] elementary schools in the city, all of which were consolidated into a single entity, St. Michael's Academy, in the autumn of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/metrowest/republican/index.ssf?/base/news-17/1232787365176350.xml&amp;coll=1 Catholic grade schools remade], ''The Republican'', Jan. 24, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The non-denominational Pioneer Valley Christian School is located in the suburban [[Sixteen Acres, Springfield, Massachusetts|Sixteen Acres]] neighborhood, educating K-12. Non-sectarian elementary schools within the City of Springfield include the Pioneer Valley Montessori School in Springfield's Sixteen Acres neighborhood and Orchard Children's Corner in suburban [[Indian Orchard, Springfield, Massachusetts|Indian Orchard]], a Pre-Kindergarten, among others.

===Private secondary===
The Diocese runs [[Cathedral High School (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Cathedral High School]], which is the largest [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] high school in Western Massachusetts. A non-denominational Christian school, the Pioneer Valley Christian School, is located in the suburban Sixteen Acres neighborhood of the city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pvcs.org/ Pioneer Valley Christian School]. Retrieved 2010-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Two [[nonsectarian]] private schools are also located in Springfield: The [[MacDuffie School]], which was founded in 1890, teaches grades six through twelve, and the Academy Hill School,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.academyhill.org/ Academy Hill]. Retrieved 2010-04-22.&lt;/ref&gt; which teaches [[kindergarten]] through grade eight.

Within {{convert|15|mi|km}} of Springfield are many private prep schools, which can serve as day schools for Springfield students; they include: the [[Williston Northampton School]] in Easthampton, Massachusetts; [[Wilbraham &amp; Monson Academy]] in Wilbraham, Massachusetts; and [[Suffield Academy]] in [[Suffield, Connecticut]].

[[File:Batmansixflags ne14.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Six Flags New England sits on the Connecticut River across from Springfield's South End]]

===Amusement parks and fairs===
Within two miles (3 km) of Springfield are New England's largest and most popular amusement park, [[Six Flags New England]], and its largest and most popular fair, [[The Big E]]. Six Flags New England, located across Springfield's South End Bridge in [[Agawam, Massachusetts|Agawam]] currently features 10 roller-coasters, including the #1 roller-coaster in the world since 2004, &quot;Bizarro.&quot; Six Flags New England also features a large water park, kid's rides, and an outdoor concert stadium, among numerous other attractions. It opens in mid-April and closes at the end of October.

The [[Eastern States Exposition]] (&quot;The Big E&quot;) is located across Springfield's Memorial Bridge in [[West Springfield, Massachusetts|West Springfield]]. The Big E serves as the New England states' collective state fair. The Big E is currently the sixth largest agricultural fair in America and brings in thousands of tourists each SeptemberâOctober. The Big E features rides, carnival food, music, and replicas of each of the six New England state houses, each of which is owned by its respective New England state. During the Big E, these state houses serve as consulates for the six New England states, and also serve food for which the states are known.

===Architecture===
In addition to its nickname ''The City of Firsts'', Springfield is known as ''The City of Homes'' for its attractive architecture, which differentiates it from most medium-size, Northeastern American cities. Most of Springfield's housing stock consists of Victorian &quot;[[Painted Ladies]]&quot; (similar to those found in [[San Francisco, California]];) however, Springfield also features [[Gilded Age]] mansions, urban condominiums buildings, brick apartment blocks, and more suburban post-World War II architecture (in the Sixteen Acres and Pine Point neighborhoods). While Springfield's architecture is attractive, much of its built-environment stems from from the 19th and early 20th centuries when the city experienced a period of &quot;intense and concentrated prosperity&quot; â today, its Victorian architecture can be found in various states of rehabilitation and disrepair. As of 2011, Springfield's housing prices are considerably lower than nearby New England cities that do not feature renowned residential architecture.

[[File:UnityChurch.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Unity Church (built 1866-1869), the first commission of noted architect [[Henry Hobson Richardson|H.H. Richardson]], was demolished in 1961.]]In Metro Center, some of Springfield's former hotels, factories, and other institutions have been converted into apartment buildings and luxury condominiums. For example, Springfield's ornate Classical High School (235 State Street), with its immense Victorian atrium - where Dr. Seuss, Timothy Leary, and Taj Mahal all went to high school - is now a luxury condominium building. The [[Hotel Kimball]], (140 Chestnut Street), which hosted several U.S. Presidents as guests and once featured the United States' first commercial radio station (WBZ), has been converted into The [[Kimball Towers Condominiums]].&lt;ref name=&quot;hammondmuseumofradio.org&quot;/&gt; The former McIntosh Shoe Company (158 Chestnut Street), one of Springfield's finest examples of the [[Chicago School of Architecture]], has been converted into industrial-style condominiums; and the red-brick, former Milton Bradley toy factory is now Stockbridge Court Apartments (45 Willow Street). In the Ridgewood Historic District, the 1950s-futurist Mulberry House (101 Mulberry Street), is now a condominium building that features some of the finest views of Springfield.

[[Forest Park, Springfield, Massachusetts|Forest Park (and Forest Park Heights)]], surrounding [[Frederick Law Olmsted]]'s beautiful {{convert|735|acre|km2}} [[Forest Park (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Forest Park]], is a New England Garden District that features over 600 [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[Painted Ladies]]. The [[McKnight, Springfield, Massachusetts (and Mason Square)|McKnight National Historic District]], America's first planned residential neighborhood, (1881), features over 900 Victorian Painted Ladies, many of which have been rehabilitated by Springfield's growing [[LGBT]] community. The Old Hill, Upper Hill, and Bay neighborhoods also feature this type of architecture.

Maple High, which is architecturally (and geographically) distinct from, but often included with Springfield's economically depressed [[Six Corners]] neighborhood, was Springfield's first &quot;Gold Coast.&quot; Many mansions from the early 19th century and later [[gilded age]] stand atop a bluff on Maple Street, overlooking the Connecticut River. The Ridgewood Historic district on Ridgewood and Mulberry Streets also feature historic mansions from the 19th and early 20th centuries.

Springfield â like many mid-size Northeastern cities, e.g.  [[Hartford]], [[Albany, New York|Albany]], and [[New Haven]] â from the 1950sâ1970s, razed a significant number of historic commercial buildings in the name of [[urban renewal]]. In 1961, this included Unity Church, the first building designed by the young [[Henry Hobson Richardson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ochsner |first1=Jeffrey Karl |authorlink1=Jeffrey  Karl Ochsner |title=H.H. Richardson: Complete Architectural Works |year=1982 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |isbn=978-0-262-65015-1 |pages=25-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Springfield's Metro Center remains more aesthetically cohesive than many its peer cities; however, as elsewhere, the city currently features a patchwork of parking-lots and grand old buildings. Current efforts are underway to improve the cohesion of Springfield's Metro Center, including the completed Main Street and State Street Corridor improvement projects, the upcoming $70 million renovation to Springfield's 1926 Union Station and the renovation of the Epiphany Tower on State Street into a new hotel. New constructions include the architecturally award-winning, $57 million [[Moshe Safdie]]-designed Federal Building on State Street.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/248.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Alphabetical Project Update List]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===

Springfield is home to 5 distinct museums at [[The Quadrangle]], along with the ornate Springfield Public Library â an architecturally significant example of the [[City Beautiful]] movement championed by [[Daniel Burnham]]. The Quadrangle's 5 distinct collections include the United States' first [[planetarium]] and the Dr Seuss National Memorial Sculpture Garden, an homage to one of Springfield's favorite native sons.

The Quadrangle's museums include the ''Museum of Fine Arts'', which features a large [[Impressionist]] collection; The ''George Walter Vincent Smith Art Museum'', a bizarre collection of Asian curiosities; the ''Springfield Science Museum'', which features a life-size Tyrannosaurus Rex, and as noted, the United States' first [[planetarium]]; the ''Connecticut Valley Historical Museum'', which, as visitors find out, is inextricably linked with American History; and the ''Museum of Springfield History'', a museum about the multi-faceted city.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldmuseums.org/the_museums/ The Museums Â» Springfield Museums]&lt;/ref&gt;

Springfield's Indian Orchard neighborhood is home to the RMS Titanic Historical Society's [[Titanic Historical Society|Titanic Museum]]. Unlike Springfield's urban Quadrangle museums, the setting for Indian Orchard's Titanic Museum looks like 1950s suburbia. Inside 208 Main Street, there is a small museum with an interesting collection about the ill-fated ocean liner. Rare artifacts tell stories about the Titanic's passengers and crew.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.titanic1.org/museum/index.asp Titanic Historical Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
Classical music aficionados hold the progressive [[Springfield Symphony Orchestra]] in high esteem. The Springfield Symphony Orchestra performs in [[Symphony Hall, Springfield|Springfield Symphony Hall]], a venue known for its ornate, Greek Revival architecture and &quot;perfect acoustics.&quot; The SSO's current conductor is Kevin Rhodes.

Famous musicians from Springfield include blues legend [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]]; the band [[Staind]] and its frontman [[Aaron Lewis]]; [[Linda Perry]], former leader singer of [[4 Non Blondes]] and now famous songwriter and producer; Taj Mahal's sister, [[Carole Fredericks]], a soul singer very popular in France; numerous jazz musicians, including [[Joe Morello]], drummer for the [[Dave Brubeck Quartet]]; [[Phil Woods]], saxophonist for [[Quincy Jones]]; [[Tony MacAlpine]], keyboardist and guitarist with [[Steve Vai]]; and [[Paul Weston]], composer for [[Frank Sinatra]], among many others.

As of 2011, Springfield's music scene is eclectic. It features a notable heavy rock scene, from which the bands [[Staind]] and [[All That Remains (band)|All That Remains]] rose to national prominence. Jazz and blues rival rock in popularity. Indeed, each summer, the Springfield-headquartered [[Hampden Bank]] sponsors the annual Hoops City Jazz &amp; Art Festival, a three-day event that draws approximately 30,000 people to Metro Center to hear varieties of different jazz music - from smooth jazz, to hard bop, to New Orleans-style jazz. In previous years, headliners have included Springfield great [[Taj Mahal (musician)|Taj Mahal]], the [[Average White Band]], and [[Poncho Sanchez]].

Only 15 miles north in the [[college town]]s of [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]] and [[Amherst, Massachusetts|Amherst]], there is an active independent and alternative rock scene. Many of these bands perform regularly in Springfield's [[Club Quarter]], at venues such as ''Fat Cats Bar &amp; Grille'', ''Theodore's'', and soon - as in the past - the restored [[Julia Sanderson Theater|Paramount Theater]]. In the [[Club Quarter]], there are venues for nearly every type of music. Centered around Stearns Square, nightly offerings include blues, college rock, jazz, indie, hip-hop, jam band, Latin, hard rock, pop, metal, karaoke, piano bars and DJs.

Each Thursday during the summer, a free concert is held at Stearns Square to coincide with ''Bike Night'', a happening that in general attracts thousands of motorcyclists to the Quarter and thousands more spectators to hear live music.

Larger rock and hip-hop acts play at the 7,000-seat [[MassMutual Center]]. In the past, the arena has played host to artists such as [[Marilyn Manson]], [[Alice Cooper]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[David Bowie]], [[David Lee Roth]], [[Poison]], [[Pearl Jam]], and [[Bob Dylan]].

===Newspapers===

===Nightlife===
''For a more complete description, see the article on: [[Club Quarter|Springfield's Club Quarter]]''

The City of Springfield' [[Club Quarter]] is the nightlife capital of the [[Pioneer Valley]] and the [[Knowledge Corridor]], featuring approximately 60 dance clubs, bars, music venues, LGBT venues, and after-hours establishments. In general, most clubs, bars, music venues, and other nightspots are located on or near upper Worthington Street, on and around Stearns Square, or on Chestnut Street.

Springfield's ''[[Club Quarter]]'' features a large (and growing) [[LGBT]] nightlife scene at establishments like ''Oz'' (397 Dwight Street), ''Pure'' (324 Chestnut Street),, ''The Pub Lounge'' (382 Dwight Street), and ''Club Xtatic'' (240 Chesnut Street, featuring dancers). In 2011, [[LGBT]] magazine ''[[The Advocate]]'' ranked Springfield #13 among its &quot;New Gay American Cities,&quot; ahead of [[San Diego, California]] and [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. There has been a notable increase in Springfield's LGBT nightlife since Massachusetts legalized gay marriage in 2004.

However, this park is separated from Springfield by the badly designed, 8-lane [[Interstate 91]] highway, which cuts through three Springfield riverfront neighborhoods, and thus presents a major obstacle to accessing this riverfront park. In 2010, the [[Urban Land Institute]] released a plan for Springfield's riverfront, which has given Springfielders cause for hope that Interstate 91 will either be moved or made more easily passable via new design features that would allow people to access the River Walk and the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref name=&quot;scholarworks.umass.edu&quot;&gt;http://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1000&amp;context=larp_honors&amp;sei-redir=1#search=&quot;springfield+divided+by+91&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/05/study_by_urban_land_institute.html Study by Urban Land Institute envisions revitalized Springfield waterfront &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/riverfront-proj.0.html City of Springfield, Mass.: Riverfront]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sports===
Besides Springfield's historic connection with basketball, the city has a rich sporting history. [[Volleyball]] was invented in the adjacent city of Holyoke, and the first exhibition match was held in 1896 at the [[Springfield College|International YMCA Training School]], now known as [[Springfield College]].
[[File:MassMutualCenter22March2008.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The MassMutual Center before a Springfield Falcons game]]
[[Ice hockey]] has been played professionally in Springfield since the 1920s, and Springfield is home to the league headquarters of the [[American Hockey League]]. The [[Springfield Indians]] of the [[American Hockey League]] (now located in [[Peoria, Illinois]]) was the oldest minor league hockey franchise in existence.  In [[1994â95 AHL season|1994]] the team relocated to Worcester and was replaced by the current [[Springfield Falcons]], who play at the [[MassMutual Center]]. For parts of two seasons (1978â80) the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] [[Hartford Whalers]] played in Springfield while their arena was undergoing repairs after a roof collapse. On the amateur level, the Junior A Springfield Olympics played for many years at the Olympia, while [[American International College]]'s Yellow Jackets compete in [[NCAA]] Division I hockey.

Basketball remains the most popular sport in Springfield's sporting landscape. Springfield is home to the [[Springfield Armor]] of the [[NBA Development League]], which began play in 2009 at the MassMutual Center. As of the 2011â2012 season, the Armor is now the exclusive affiliate of the [[New Jersey Nets]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/dleague/springfield/name_logo_090630.html Springfield's NBA Development League Team Unveils Name and Logo]&lt;/ref&gt; For many years, the Hall of Fame Tip-Off Classic has been the semi-official start to the college basketball season, and the NCAA Division II championships are usually held in Springfield. The [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] will play its championships in Springfield from 2012â2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maacsports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=17400&amp;ATCLID=204861913 &quot;MAAC Names MassMutual Center in Springfield Site for 2012â2014 MAAC Basketball Championships&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New England Blizzard]] of the [[American Basketball League (1996â1998)|ABL]] played its first game in Springfield, and several minor pro men's and women's teams have called the city home, including the [[Springfield Fame]] of the [[United States Basketball League]] (the league's inaugural champion in 1985) and the Springfield Hall of Famers of the [[Eastern Professional Basketball League]].

Springfield has had professional baseball in the past, and according to its current mayor, remains intent on pursuing it in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive2&quot;&gt;[http://www.masslive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/09/springfields_pynchon_park_rare.html Springfield's Pynchon Park, rarely accessible since 1976, reopens after renovations &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Springfield Giants]] of the Singleâ and Double-A [[Eastern League (baseball)|Eastern League]] played between 1957 and 1965. The team was quite successful, winning consecutive championships in 1959, 1960 and 1961, by startling coincidence the same seasons in which the Springfield Indians won three straight [[Calder Cup]] championships in hockey. The Giants played at Pynchon Park by the waterfront, and were forced to move when Pynchon Park's grandstands were destroyed by fire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.projectballpark.org/history/na/alt/pynchon.html Pynchon Park]&lt;/ref&gt; Before that time, the [[Springfield Cubs]] played in the minor league [[New England League]] from 1946 until 1949, after which the league folded; they then played in the [[International League]] until 1953. For many years before the Giants, Springfield was also a member of the Eastern League, between 1893 and 1943. In general, the team was named the [[Springfield Ponies|Ponies]], but it also carried the nicknames of &quot;Maroons&quot; (1895), &quot;Green Sox&quot; (1917), &quot;Hampdens&quot; (1920â21), &quot;Rifles (1932, 1942â43) and &quot;Nationals&quot; (1939â41).

===Springfield's Parks===

In 2010, Springfield was cited as the 4th &quot;Greenest City&quot; in the United States â the largest city cited in the Top 10. The recognition noted Springfield's numerous parks, the purity of its drinking water, its regional recycling center, and organizations like ReStore Home Improvement Center, which salvages building materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestplaces.net/docs/studies/greencities.aspx Green Cities]&lt;/ref&gt; Springfield features over {{convert|2,400|acre|km2}} of parkland distributed among 35 urban parks, including the grand, {{convert|735|acre|km2}} [[Forest Park (Springfield)|Forest Park]]. Well-known parks include the following, among others:
* '''[[Apremont Triangle Historic District|Apremont Triangle Park]]''' is a triangular, pocket park in front of Springfield's historic [[Kimball Towers]] in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Named for Springfield's [[104th Infantry Regiment (United States)|104th Infantry Regiment]], which following the [[World War I]] Battle of [[Apremont, Ardennes|Apremont]], became the first-ever U.S. military unit awarded for heroism by a foreign power, receiving France's highest military honor: the [[croix de guerre]] for bravery in combat. The same Springfield unit received the same honor again in [[World War II]]. Apremont Triangle Park, steps from both the bohemian [[Kimball Towers]] and upper-class [[Quadrangle-Mattoon Street Historic District]] offers a place to sit amidst the restaurants on the northern fringe of the [[Club Quarter]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://photos.masslive.com/republican/2011/05/springfields_monuments_and_memorials_46.html Springfield's monuments and memorials &amp;#124; masslive.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning near the [[Basketball Hall of Fame]], it features jogging trails, benches, boat docks, and plazas â all of which afford scenic vistas of the [[Connecticut River]] and [[Connecticut River Valley]]. However, Interstate 91's position, height, and ancillary structures â including a 1756-car, below-grade parking lot, (the largest in the city,) and {{convert|20|ft|m|adj=on}} stone walls block all views of the Connecticut River, and all but three passages to the park from [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Despite Springfield's rating as one of the most walkable cities in the U.S., due to the poor planning of I-91, this park can be difficult to reach on foot. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkscore.com/MA/Springfield&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Court Square]]''' has been Springfield's one topographical constant since colonial days â it is located in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]].

* '''King Phillip's Stockade''' is an historic park, famous as the site where Native Americans organized the 1675 Sack of Springfield; The Stockade features numerous picnic pavilions, excellent views of the [[Connecticut River Valley]], and a sculpture of ''The Windsor Indian'', who tried in vain to warn the residents of Springfield of coming danger.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barneycarriagehouse.com/bch/ Barney Carriage House: Weddings and Corporate Events at the Carriage House at the Barney Estate, Forest Park, Springfield, MA 01108]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Leonardo da Vinci Park''' is a small greenspace (0.4&amp;nbsp;acres), located in the historically Italian [[South End, Springfield, Massachusetts|South End]] of Springfield. It features ornamental perimeter fencing surrounding a playground. Leonardo Da Vinci Park was renovated in 2009 and now features new picnic tables and playground equipment.
* '''Pynchon Park''' is an architecturally interesting [[brutalist]]-style city park, which was dedicated in 1977. It links Springfield's [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] with [[The Quadrangle]] cultural grouping, (the museums and sculptures sit atop a steep bluff). Mostly made of poured concrete, but featuring a waterfall, lush greenery, and fountains, Pynchon Park received numerous accolades from the American Institute of Architecture for âenhancing the quality of the urban environment in the core of the city.â It features two levels and a distinctive elevator.&lt;ref name=&quot;masslive2&quot;/&gt;
* '''[[Stearns Square]]''' is a rectangular park between Worthington Street and Bridge Street in Springfield's [[Club Quarter]], located in [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]]. Designed by the creative 'dream-team' of [[Stanford White]] and [[August St. Gaudens]]. It was there that St. Gaudens' most famous work, ''[[The Puritan (Springfield)|The Puritan]]'', originally stood. ''The Puritan'' has since been moved to [[The Quadrangle]], at the corner of State and Chestnut Streets; however, White's and St. Gaudens' original fountain, bench, and turtle sculptures, all meant to compliment ''The Puritan'', remain in Stearns Square.
* '''[[Van Horn Park]]''' is a large park in the Hungry Hill section of [[Liberty Heights, Springfield, Massachusetts|Liberty Heights]] in Springfield. It features two ponds and a reservoir. The Reservoir and lower dam are not generally accessible to the public. The Main Entrance is on Armory Street near Chapin Terrace.

While WWLP is licensed to Springfield, they moved their studios to nearby Chicopee from their old studios atop [[Provin Mountain]]. WWLP is the oldest TV station to air regularly scheduled programming in the market, launching its schedule on March 17, 1953, on Channel 61. WWLP also operated WRLP (UHF 32), a UHF station licensed to [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], whose transmitter was in [[Winchester, New Hampshire]] as well as W69AQ (UHF 69), a low power station that transmitted from the WWLP tower on Provin Mountain.

WGGB's studios are on Liberty Street near the Chicopee line. WGGB (originally WHYN) signed on on April 1, 1953 on Channel 55. In 1958, WHYN switched to UHF 40. Guy Gannett Broadcasting bought the station in 1979 and changed its call sign to the current WGGB-TV effective at the start of the following year. In 2008, WGGB launched a secondary service called &quot;Fox 6&quot;, named after its channel position on the local [[Comcast]] [[cable TV]] lineup. FOX6 also appears on WGGB's [[Digital Television|DTV]] sub-channel 40.2. WGGB is the only locally owned station, owned by businessman John G. Gormally. WGGB's analog television signal signed off permanently in late November 2008, due to a transmitter failure.

==Transportation==

[[File:Florida 148.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Bradley International Airport, 12 miles south of Springfield.]]

===Ground===
Springfield is called the ''Crossroads of New England'' because it is the major shipping nexus from [[New York City]], [[Boston]], [[Montreal]] and the [[Great Lakes]] (via [[Albany, New York]]). Much of the cargo heading from one of these places to another crosses through the City of Springfield. As a geographical trade center, Springfield has more advantages than just being equidistant to these other large trade centers â it sits beside the [[Connecticut River]], on some of the most fertile farmland in the Northeast, served by numerous rails and [[Interstate Highways]], including [[I-90]] ([[Massachusetts Turnpike|Mass Pike]]) and [[I-91]], which connect [[New Haven]], Hartford, Holyoke, [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], and [[Vermont]] to Springfield. One of the few spurs of I-91 in Massachusetts, [[Interstate 291 (Massachusetts)|I-291]], runs through Springfield, and provides a secondary connection between I-90 and I-91. (There is an unnumbered connector in West Springfield).

===Rail===
Springfield has an [[Amtrak]] [[Springfield, Massachusetts (Amtrak station)|station]] served by trains destined for New York City, Washington, D.C., [[Philadelphia]], Boston, Vermont, [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], [[Montreal]], [[Albany, New York]], [[Buffalo, New York]], [[Cleveland, Ohio]], and [[Chicago]]. Currently, Amtrak operates out of a self-built platform following the 1973 close of Springfield's grand 1926 &quot;Union Station.&quot; In 2011, Springfield's Union Station will receive a $70 million renovation, becoming an &quot;intermodal transportation facility,&quot; allowing [[Peter Pan Bus]], [[Greyhound Bus]], and the [[PVTA]] to occupy a modernist space next door the re-built, 1926 Union Station.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springfield-ma.gov/planning/union_station.0.html City of Springfield].&lt;/ref&gt; The renovated Union Station will serve as a nexus for Amtrak's re-tooled ''Vermonter'', which in 2012, will begin to follow the tracks of the more direct, former ''Montrealer'' route. This will allow Springfield to become the hub of an intercity commuter line headed north, with two stops in Springfield, 2 stops in Chicopee, one (or perhaps two) stops in Holyoke, and one stop each in [[Northampton, Massachusetts|Northampton]], [[South Deerfield, Massachusetts|South Deerfield]], [[Greenfield, Massachusetts|Greenfield]], and [[Brattleboro, Vermont]]. Check schedules from 2011â2012 as there promise to be many changes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eot.state.ma.us/downloads/90_DayReport/kc_intro_ppt20100323.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Springfield's intercity commuter rail line headed north, Springfield also stands to benefit from a high-speed intercity commuter/freight rail from the south. The [[New Haven-Hartford-Springfield Commuter Rail Line]] has received complete funding from Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and of April 2010, is nearing complete funding from the Federal Government and the State of  Connecticut. The trains on ''The Knowledge Corridor Route'' between New Haven and Springfield will, it has been reported, reach speeds of {{convert|110|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The project is scheduled to begin in 2012 and be completed by 2015.

Springfield-area freight yards stand to profit tremendously from the city's increased rail traffic. There are no major freight yards in Springfield proper, but CSOR and CSX serve the West Springfield Yard across the Connecticut River.

===Bus===
Local transit buses running into and out of the city use a facility owned and operated by [[Peter Pan Bus]] Lines, which is headquartered in Springfield at the corner of Main and Liberty Streets, next to the [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] arch that denotes entrance into [[Metro Center, Springfield, Massachusetts|Metro Center]] Springfield. As of 2011, Peter Pan's Bus Terminal is need of a major aesthetic overhaul â the opportunity for Peter Pan, Greyhound, and the PVTA to move across the street to Springfield's Unions Station intermodal facility should render the point moot.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.springfieldcityhall.com/planning/fileadmin/Planning_files/rfqs/Union_Station_In_the_News/UStation_PressRelease.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Plans call for a bus station to be built on the plot adjacent to Union Station â the site of the former Hotel Charles â with a 23-bay bus terminal on lower levels and a 400-space public parking lot on upper levels.

Currently, the PVTA, headquartered at the dilapidated Peter Pan Terminal, provides services to the cities of Springfield, Chicopee, West Springfield, Westfield, and Holyoke. In September 2010, the City of Holyoke opened a new state-of-the-art bus station across the street from its centrally located Veterans Park. That bus station acts as the PVTA's main point of transfer between Hampden County in the south, and Hampshire county in the north.

===Air===
* [[Bradley International Airport]], in [[Windsor Locks, Connecticut]] is {{convert|12|mi|km}} south of Metro Center Springfield, and {{convert|12|mi|km}} north of [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]]. It features over 100 daily departures to 30 destinations on nine airlines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bradleyairport.com/Flights/destinations.aspx Destinations]&lt;/ref&gt;
'''Other airports serving the Springfield include:'''
* [[Westover Metropolitan Airport]] is {{convert|5|mi|km}} from downtown Springfield. It is {{convert|3|mi|km}} from the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]].
* [[Logan International Airport]] is served by most, prominent international airlines.  Boston is approximately {{convert|80|mi|km}} northeast of Springfield.
