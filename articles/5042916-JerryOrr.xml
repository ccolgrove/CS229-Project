'''Canada''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|k|Ã¦|n|É|d|É}}) is a [[North America]]n country consisting of [[Provinces and territories of Canada|ten provinces and three territories]]. Located in the northern part of the continent, it extends from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] in the east to the [[Pacific Ocean]] in the west, and northward into the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Spanning over 9.9 million square kilometres, Canada is [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|the world's second-largest country by total area]], and its [[Canada â United States border|common border]] with the [[United States]] is the longest land border in the world.

The land that is now Canada was inhabited for millennia by various groups of [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]]. Beginning in the late 15th century, [[British colonization of the Americas|British]] and [[French colonization of the Americas|French]] expeditions explored, and later settled, along the region's Atlantic coast. France ceded nearly all of [[New France|its colonies in North America]] in 1763 after the [[Seven Years' War]]. In 1867, with the union of three [[British North America]]n colonies through [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]], Canada was formed as a [[federalism|federal]] [[dominion]] of four provinces. This began an [[Territorial evolution of Canada|accretion of provinces and territories]] and a process of increasing autonomy from the [[United Kingdom]]. This widening autonomy was highlighted by the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and culminated in the [[Canada Act 1982]], which severed the vestiges of legal dependence on the [[British parliament]].

Canada is a federal state that is governed as a [[parliamentary democracy]] and a [[constitutional monarchy]] with Queen [[Elizabeth II]] as its [[head of state]]. It is a [[Official bilingualism in Canada|bilingual]] nation with both [[Canadian English|English]] and [[Canadian French|French]] as official languages at the federal level. One of the world's most highly-[[developed countries]], Canada has a diversified economy that is reliant upon its abundant natural resources and upon trade &amp;ndash; particularly with the United States, with which Canada has had a [[Canada â United States relations|long and complex relationship]]. It is a member of the [[G7]], [[G8]], [[G20]], [[NATO]], [[OECD]], [[WTO]], [[Commonwealth of Nations]], [[Organisation internationale de la Francophonie|Francophonie]], [[Organisation of American States|OAS]], [[APEC]], and [[UN]]. With the [[List of countries by Human Development Index|sixth-highest]] [[Human Development Index]] globally, Canada has one of the highest [[standards of living]] in the world.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Name of Canada}}&lt;!--Please see the talk page before editing this to specify which languages produced the word Canada. There are differences of opinion, which may be best discussed at Name of Canada--&gt;
The name ''Canada'' comes from the [[St. Lawrence Iroquoians|St. Lawrence Iroquoian]] word ''kanata'', meaning &quot;village&quot; or &quot;settlement&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Origin of the Name, Canada|url=http://www.pch.gc.ca/pgm/ceem-cced/symbl/o5-eng.cfm|publisher=Canadian Heritage|year=2008|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1535, indigenous inhabitants of the present-day [[Quebec City]] region used the word to direct French explorer [[Jacques Cartier]] to the village of [[Stadacona]].&lt;ref name=&quot;maura&quot;/&gt; Cartier later used the word ''Canada'' to refer not only to that particular village, but also the entire area subject to [[Donnacona]] (the chief at Stadacona); by 1545, European books and maps had begun referring to this region as ''Canada''.&lt;ref name=&quot;maura&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maura|first=Juan Francisco|year=2009|title=Nuevas aportaciones al estudio de la toponimia ibÃ©rica en la AmÃ©rica Septentrional en el siglo XVI|journal=Bulletin of Spanish Studies|volume=86|issue=5|pages=577â603|doi=10.1080/14753820902969345}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th and early 18th century, &quot;[[Canada (New France)|Canada]]&quot; referred to the part of [[New France]] that lay along the [[Saint Lawrence River]] and the northern shores of the [[Great Lakes]]. The area was later split into two British colonies, [[Upper Canada]] and [[Lower Canada]]. They were re-unified as the [[Province of Canada]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt;
Upon [[Canadian Confederation|Confederation]] in 1867, ''Canada'' was adopted as the legal name for the new country, and the word ''Dominion'' was conferred as the country's title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Toole|first=Roger|title=Holy nations and global identities : civil religion, nationalism, and globalisation|year=2009|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004178281|editor=Hvithamar, Annika; Warburg, Margit; Jacobsen, Brian Arly|page=137|chapter=Dominion of the Gods: Religious continuity and change in a Canadian context}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as Canada asserted its political autonomy from the United Kingdom, the federal government increasingly used simply ''Canada'' on state documents and treaties, a change that was reflected in the renaming of the national holiday from [[Dominion Day]] to [[Canada Day]] in 1982.&lt;ref name=&quot;buckner&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Canada and the British Empire|editor= Buckner, Philip|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2008|pages=37â40, 56â59, 114, 124â125|isbn=019927164X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Canadas]] were the main front in the [[War of 1812]] between the United States and Britain.

Canada is a federation composed of ten [[province]]s and three [[territory (administrative division)|territories]]. In turn, these may be [[List of regions of Canada|grouped into regions]]: [[Western Canada]], [[Central Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]], and [[Northern Canada]] ([[Eastern Canada]] refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together). Provinces have more autonomy than territories. The provinces are responsible for most of Canada's social programs (such as [[Health care in Canada|health care]], [[Education in Canada|education]], and [[welfare]]) and together collect more revenue than the federal government, an almost unique structure among federations in the world. Using its spending powers, the federal government can initiate national policies in provincial areas, such as the [[Canada Health Act]]; the provinces can opt out of these, but rarely do so in practice. [[Equalization payments]] are made by the federal government to ensure that reasonably uniform standards of services and taxation are kept between the richer and poorer provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/11-516-x/sectionh/4057752-eng.htm|title=Government Finance|last=Bird|first=Richard M|date=October 22, 2008|work=Historical Statistics of Canada|publisher=Statistics Canada|accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past century, the growth of Canada's manufacturing, mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural economy to an advanced, urbanized, industrial one. Like many other [[First World]] nations, the Canadian economy is dominated by the [[Tertiary sector of the economy|service industry]], which employs about three-quarters of the country's workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www40.statcan.gc.ca/l01/cst01/econ40-eng.htm|publisher=Statistics Canada|title=Employment by Industry|date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2011-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Canada is unusual among developed countries in the importance of its [[primary sector of the economy|primary sector]], in which the [[logging]] and [[petroleum industry|petroleum industries]] are two of the most prominent elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Easterbrook|first=WT|date=March 1995|title=Recent Contributions to Economic History: Canada|journal=Journal of Economic History|volume=19|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's economic integration with the United States has increased significantly since World War II. The [[Automotive Products Trade Agreement]] of 1965 opened the country's borders to trade in the automobile manufacturing industry. In the 1970s, concerns over energy self-sufficiency and foreign ownership in the manufacturing sectors prompted Prime Minister [[Pierre Trudeau]]'s Liberal government to enact the [[National Energy Program]] (NEP) and the [[Investment Canada|Foreign Investment Review Agency]] (FIRA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morck|first=Randall|coauthors=Tian, Gloria; Yeung, Bernard|title=Governance, multinationals, and growth|editor=Eden, Lorraine; Dobson, Wendy|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing|year=2005|page=50|chapter=Who owns whom?

Canada's official national sports are [[ice hockey]] and [[lacrosse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wieting|first=Stephen G|title=Sport and memory in North America|publisher=Frank Cass|year=2001|page=4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=dvWqyW9lmXsC&amp;pg=PA4|isbn=0714682055}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hockey is a [[national sport|national pastime]] and the most popular spectator sport in the country. It is also the sport most played by Canadians, with 1.65&amp;nbsp;million participants in 2004. Seven of Canada's eight largest metropolitan areas â Toronto, Montreal, Vancouver, Ottawa, Calgary, Edmonton and Winnipeg â have franchises in the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and there are more Canadian players in the NHL than from all other countries combined. Other popular spectator sports include [[curling]] and [[Canadian football|football]]; the latter is played professionally in the [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL). [[Golf]], [[baseball]], [[skiing]], [[Soccer in Canada|soccer]], [[cricket]], [[volleyball]], and [[basketball]] are widely played at youth and amateur levels, but professional leagues and franchises are not widespread.&lt;ref name = &quot;sports&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Conference Board of Canada]] | year = 2004 | month = December | url = http://www.pch.gc.ca/progs/sc/pubs/socio-eco/tab2_tab_e.cfm | title = Survey: Most Popular Sports, by Type of Participation, Adult Population | publisher = Sport Canada | work = Strengthening Canada: The Socio-economic Benefits of Sport Participation in Canada â Report August 2005 | accessdate=2006-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada has hosted several high-profile international sporting events, including the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in Montreal, the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] in Calgary, and the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. Canada was the host nation for the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] in [[Vancouver]] and [[Whistler, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher =The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the 2010 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games | url = http://www.vancouver2010.com/ | title = Vancouver 2010 | year = 2009 | accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada's national symbols are influenced by natural, historical, and Aboriginal sources. The use of the [[maple leaf]] as a Canadian symbol dates to the early 18th century. The maple leaf is depicted on Canada's [[Flag of Canada|current]] and [[Canadian Red Ensign|previous flags]], on the [[penny (Canadian coin)|penny]], and on the [[Arms of Canada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;symbol1&quot;&gt;{{cite book | author=Canadian Heritage | title=Symbols of Canada | year=2002 | isbn=0660186152 | publisher=Canadian Government Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent symbols include the [[beaver]], [[Canada Goose]], [[Great Northern Loon|Common Loon]], the Crown, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,&lt;ref name=&quot;symbol1&quot;/&gt; and more recently, the [[totem pole]] and [[Inuksuk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruhl|first=Jeffrey|date=January 2008|title=Inukshuk Rising|journal=Canadian Journal of Globalization|volume=1|issue=1|pages=25â30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
