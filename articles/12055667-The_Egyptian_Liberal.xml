'''Ahmed Ezz''' (born in 1959) is a [[Egypt]]ian businessman and one-time politician, the owner of [[Ezz Steel]] and the former chairman of Egypt's national assembly's budget committee.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also a former senior member of the ruling [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party of Egypt]] (NDP) and has been described as &quot;a confidant of the presidentâs son [[Gamal Mubarak]], and two other former ministers.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/world/middleeast/11egypt.html Egyptâs Army Signals Transfer of Power], nyt.com, February 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Ezz graduated from [[Cairo University]] with a degree in Civil Engineering.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=25304598#ref492562659 Zoominfo]&lt;/ref&gt; He has been elected twice as the head of the [[Iron and Steel Arab Union]].  Prior to his work in organized labor, Ezz was a parliamentary member representing the districts of Sadat-Monouf-Sers al-Liyan from Monofuyia from the year 2000 to 2011, and also the Chairman of the Planning and Budget Committee of the [[People's Assembly of Egypt]] as a member of the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]]. (According to [[Al Jazeera]], he resigned from the NDP on 29 January 2011.) 

Prior to the revolution, opposition parties, other parliamentarians, and groups accused Ezz of monopolizing the steel industry in Egypt by holding more than 60 percent of the market share, describing it as an act that is backed up by the government when the dominant share of monopoly was raised from 35 percent to 65 percent, an act that was described by the active parliamentarian Aboul Ezz Al Hariri as &quot;enhancing the proliferation of monopolies rather than fighting them&quot;. The groups mentioned are even blaming him of increasing the steel prices of as much as 70 percent. In response Ezz has told reporters that a competition law &quot;would at least provide a legal framework preventing everyone from making accusations&quot;.

After the resignation of Hosni Mubarak due to the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], on 17 February 2011 Ahmed Ezz was arrested, along with former interior minister [[Habib el-Adly]], former minister of housing [[Ahmed Maghrabi]] and former tourism minister [[Zuheir Garana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12500968 |title=BBC News - Egypt after Mubarak: Three ex-ministers arrested |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-02-15 |accessdate=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  News of the arrests spread quickly in the local Egyptian press.  As a result, many fear that Ahmed Ezz will not receive a fair trial under a 1981 provision of Egyptian emergency law.  Amr Bargisi, a senior partner with the Egyptian Union of Liberal Youth, told the'' Washington Times''  &quot;I am afraid the divorce of wealth from power will probably not only lead to the unfair treatment of many businessmen and former politicians, but might also take Egypt in a direction that will be devastating for the economy and the prospects of democracy. Every businessman at the moment is a suspect of the revolutionary regime and the public. If this trend continues, we will see major capital flight from Egypt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets]&lt;/ref&gt;  Joe Stork, the deputy director of Human Rights Watch's Middle East and North Africa division, told the ''Washington Times'' of Mr. Ezz:  &quot;Certainly he, like anyone else, has his right to a fair trial. The judicial proceedings he is subjected to should meet fair-trial standards; he should know the accusations against him; he should be able to confront those who are accusing him.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets/print/]&lt;/ref&gt;  

In a March 11 letter from prison that was published on the Bikyamas website, Mr. Ezz refuted the charges against him and warned that &quot;In this unprecedented time for the country, it is important to remember what our youth are calling for: freedom, fairness and democracy. My hope is that this commitment to a bright future for Egypt is not undermined at its first hurdle through a desire to find scapegoats. I truly hope I can at least depend on a full representation of the facts, due legal process and a fair trial.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2011/mar/15/mubaraks-allies-fear-theyre-targets/print/]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ahmed Ezz was born to Muslim parents.
