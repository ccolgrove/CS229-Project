'''Oneworld''' ([[Computer reservations system|CRS]]: '''*O'''), branded as '''one'''world, is one of the world's three largest global [[airline alliance]]s with its central management team, oneworld Management Company, based in [[New York City]], [[New York]], [[USA]]. Oneworld was founded in 1999 by [[American Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Canadian Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Qantas]]. The alliance slogan is &quot;''Oneworld revolves around you''&quot;.

The alliance had the biggest expansion in its history in 2007 when [[Japan Airlines]], [[MalÃ©v Hungarian Airlines|MalÃ©v]] and [[Royal Jordanian]] joined as full members, while Cathay Pacific's [[subsidiary]] [[Dragonair]], five subsidiaries of Japan Airlines and two subsidiaries of [[LAN Airlines|LAN]] joined as affiliate members. In 2009, Oneworld celebrated its 10th [[anniversary]] with the introduction of a new standard Oneworld [[livery]] that all of its member airlines adopted on a proportion of their fleets and a special version of its [[logo]].

By July 2011, Oneworld and its members-elect reached over 870 destinations in 146 countries, including announced destinations but not yet commenced. It operates over 9,300 daily flights, carrying 335 million passengers on a combined fleet of over 2,400 aircraft. Since late 2002, Oneworld member airlines have developed common specifications across their engineering and maintenance activities, reducing costs through [[bulk buying]] and [[spare part|parts]] sharing. It was also the first airline alliance to introduce [[interlining|interline]] [[electronic ticket|e-ticketing]] across all member airlines' network.

Oneworld was voted the world's ''Best Airline Alliance'' in the 2002, 2004 and 2005 Business Traveller Awards. The alliance was also named the ''World's Leading Airline Alliance'' for the eighth consecutive year in the 2010 World Travel Awards and the world's ''Best Airline Alliance'' in both the World Airline Awards 2010 by [[Skytrax]] and in the GT Tested Reader Survey 2010 Awards by [[Global Traveler]].

The alliance is the most highest rated airline, with an average star rating of 3.73, based on all the alliances airlines. This beats both [[Skyteam]] and [[Star Alliance]], with average ratings of 3.19 and 3.29, respectively.

==Management==
[[File:Vancouver Marine Building.jpg|thumb|alt=The Marine Building, Vancouver|The [[Marine Building]], prior home of the Oneworld Management Company]]
Oneworld announced the formation of a central management team, Oneworld Management Company (oMC), to mark the alliance's first anniversary. The oMC was established in May 2000 in Vancouver and in June 2011 relocated to [[New York City]], [[New York]], USA. It is responsible for driving future growth and the launch of new customer services and benefits. The oMC was first led by Managing Partner Peter Buecking, previously Director of Sales and Marketing at [[Cathay Pacific]]; followed by John McCulloch, previously the alliance's Vice-President Marketing; and since December, 2011 by Bruce Ashby, who previously held roles of CEO of Saudi Arabia's SAMA Airlines, CEO of India's IndiGo, and Executive Vice-President for US Airways. Reporting to the Managing Partner are [[Vice-President]]s for Commercial; Membership and Customer Experience; and Corporate Communications.&lt;ref name=oMC&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld marks first anniversary by establishing central alliance team|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1276|publisher=Oneworld|date=1 February 2000|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=intro&gt;{{cite web|title=An introduction to Oneworld - The alliance that revolves around you|publisher=Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/content/factsheet/W2_2009-02-03%20introduction%20to%20oneworld.pdf|format=PDF|date=1 February 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=privacy&gt;{{cite web|title=Privacy Policy|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/privacy-policy|publisher=Oneworld|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Managing Partner reports to the alliance board, Oneworld Governing Board, which is made up of the [[chief executive]]s of each of the member airlines. The Governing Board meets regularly to set strategic direction and review progress. [[Chairman]] of the board rotates on an annual basis among the alliance members' chief executives. [[American Airlines]] Chairman and Chief Executive [[Gerard Arpey]] was nominated on 20 November 2008 and is the present Chairman of the oGB.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=Arpey&gt;{{cite press release|title=American Airlines CEO Gerard Arpey to chair Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=15929|publisher=Oneworld|date=20 November 2008|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Headquarters===
In 2010 the alliance announced that, in June 2011, the alliance headquarters would relocate to 2 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in [[New York City]], which also houses offices of other Oneworld members including [[American Airlines]] and [[British Airways]].&lt;ref&gt;Reed, Ted. &quot;[http://www.thestreet.com/story/10944330/1/veteran-airline-exec-to-lead-oneworld.html Veteran Airline Exec to Lead OneWorld].&quot; ''[[The Street]]''.

===Alliance initiatives and performance===
Since late 2002, Oneworld member airlines have developed common specifications across their engineering and maintenance (E&amp;M) activities, reducing costs through bulk buying and parts sharing. In addition, increased efficiency by aligning their policies and procedures and to share best practice. 

{{As of|2010|7|27}}, Oneworld and its members-elect, reached 871 destinations in 146 countries, including announced destinations but not yet commenced; it generated 697.03 billion revenue passenger kilometres (RPK). It operates 9,366 daily flights, carrying 335.53 million passengers with a passenger load factor of 77.8 percent, on a combined fleet of 2,470 aircraft.&lt;ref name=Stats&gt;{{cite web|title=Oneworld at a Glance Statistics|url=http://www.oneworld.com/content/factsheet/W2_W1_2010-07-27%20at%20a%20glance%20with%20AB_IT_S7.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Oneworld|date=27 July 2010|accessdate=4 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===A new global alliance===
Five [[airline]]s from four [[continent]]s â [[American Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Canadian Airlines]], [[Cathay Pacific]] and [[Qantas]] â gathered in a ceremony in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], on 21 September 1998 to officially unveil a new global [[airline alliance]], named ''Oneworld''. Oneworld was officially launched and became operational on 1 February 1999. The alliance [[slogan]] is &quot;Oneworld revolves around you&quot; and all the member airlines share one [[strategic planning|vision]]: &quot;To generate more value for [[customer]]s, [[shareholder]]s and [[employee]]s than any airline can achieve by itself. &quot; The alliance's [[customer service|service]]s and benefits include smoother transfers for [[passenger]]s travelling across all member airlines; greater support to passengers regardless of which member airline they are travelling with; greater range of [[Round-the-world ticket|round-the-world]] products; and enhanced co-operation in the member airline's [[frequent-flyer program|frequent flyer programme]]s to provide more rewards, wider recognition and access to more [[airport lounge]]s. Prior to the official launch, the alliance embarked on one of the world's biggest employee communications and [[training]] programmes, involving virtually all of the 220,000 staff employed by the five member airlines. The training would ensure all the staff could deliver what the alliance [[brand]] promises. The member airlines, with their [[franchising|franchise]] and partner airlines covered in the alliance [[contract|agreement]], have networks that served 648 destinations in 139 [[country|countries]]. In 1997, the five member airlines carried 181 [[million]] passengers and 2.6 million [[tonne]]s of [[cargo]] with a fleet of 1,577 [[aircraft]].&lt;ref name=founder&gt;{{cite press release|title=Five leading airlines to launch Oneworld global alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1271|publisher=Oneworld|date=21 September 1998|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fact98&gt;{{cite press release|title=Key facts and figures about Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1554|publisher=Oneworld|date=21 September 1998|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld: The alliance to serve the world takes off on February 1|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1273|publisher=Oneworld|date=25 January 1999|accessdate=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First additional members===
[[File:Finnair.a321-200.oh-lzb.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Finnair]] became Oneworld's first recruit following the alliance's foundation]]
[[Finnair]], [[Finland]]'s largest airline and [[flag carrier]] with services to 60 destinations worldwide and a fleet of 58 aircraft, was announced as the alliance first new recruit on 9 December 1998.&lt;ref name=AY&gt;{{cite press release|title=Finnair to fly on board Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1552|publisher=Oneworld|date=9 December 1998|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the alliance also welcomed [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], [[Spain]]'s flag carrier, as its second recruit on 15 February 1999.&lt;ref name=IB&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld welcomes Iberia on board|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1272|publisher=Oneworld|date=15 February 1999|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both airlines, together with Iberia's franchisee, [[Air Nostrum|Iberia Regional Air Nostrum]], joined the alliance on 1 September 1999; added more than 50 destinations to the Oneworld network.&lt;ref name=AYIB&gt;{{cite press release|title=Finnair and Iberia board Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1556|publisher=Oneworld|date=31 August 1999|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 May 1999, LanChile (now known as [[LAN Airlines|LAN]]) became a member-elect; the first from [[South America]]. The airline was formed in 1929 and operated some 120 flights a day to 17 destinations in [[Chile]] and 22 destinations worldwide. LanChile's two subsidiaries, [[LAN Express]] and [[LAN PerÃº]], would also join the alliance.&lt;ref name=LA&gt;{{cite press release|title=LanChile welcomed as newest member of Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1274|publisher=Oneworld|date=19 May 1999|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Irish carrier [[Aer Lingus]] was formally elected on board and confirmed as the ninth member of the alliance on 2 December 1999. The airline was established in 1936 and is one of the ten biggest companies in [[Ireland]].&lt;ref name=EI&gt;{{cite press release|title=AerLingus to join Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1275|publisher=Oneworld|date=2 December 1999|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, faced with years of financial losses, Oneworld founding member [[Canadian Airlines]] announced in summer 1999 that it had only enough funds to operate for one more year. After a four months [[takeover]] war between [[Onex Corporation]] and [[Air Canada]], Canadian Airlines was acquired by Air Canada on 21 December 1999 and as a consequence, it would leave the alliance.&lt;ref name=CP&gt;{{cite web|last=Christopher|first=John|coauthors=Dion, Joseph P.|title=The Canadian Airline Industry|url=http://dsp-psd.pwgsc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/CIR/892-e.htm#1consolidationtxt|publisher=[[Government of Canada]]|date=14 November 2002|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CPleave&gt;{{cite press release|title=Canadian to withdraw from Oneworld on June 1|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1558|publisher=Oneworld|date=14 March 2000|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 June 2000, Aer Lingus, LanChile and its two subsidiaries joined Oneworld, while Canadian Airlines ceased to be a member on the same day.&lt;ref name=LAEI&gt;{{cite press release|title=LanChile and Aer Lingus board the &quot;alliance that revolves around you&quot;|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1561|publisher=Oneworld|date=31 May 2000|accessdate=6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidiaries and franchises â part 1===
[[Air LibertÃ©]], a British Airways subsidiary, was sold to [[France|French]] investment group Taitbout for [[pound sterling|Â£]]47 [[million]] in May 2000 and ceased to be an Oneworld [[affiliate (commerce)|affiliate]] member. British Airways said it had not been able to receive adequate returns on its investment since the purchase of about 86 percent of the French carrier. The airline was suffering from heavy losses, expected to Â£250 million, due to increased competition in the French domestic market in 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=BA sells Air Liberte|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/736703.stm|publisher=BBC|date=5 May 2000|accessdate=7 August2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the alliance hailed the arrival of a new affiliate member when [[Kenya]]n-based [[Regional Air]] joined the alliance on 1 July 2001, following its franchising agreement with British Airways. It is the alliance's third affiliate in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld extends its international lead with addition of new African affiliate|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1572|publisher=Oneworld|date=8 June 2001|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Trans World Airlines|TWA]]'s [[regional airline|regional carriers]], which operated under the [[Trans World Express]] brand, became American Airlines and Oneworld affiliate members, as their name changed to [[AmericanConnection]] on 2 December 2001. The three airlines operating under the AmericanConnection brand are [[Chautauqua Airlines]], [[Corporate Airlines]] and [[Trans States Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=TWA network joins Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1575|publisher=Oneworld|date=4 December 2001|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swiss International Air Lines===
[[Swiss International Air Lines]] (Swiss) accepted an invitation to join the alliance, after signing a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MOU) on 23 September 2003 to establish a wide-ranging commercial agreement with British Airways. The two airlines planned joint operations between [[Switzerland]] and the [[United Kingdom]] with [[codeshare agreement|codesharing]] on Swiss' [[London Heathrow Airport|London Heathrow]] routes. The Swiss Travel Club, Swiss' frequent flyer programme, would be integrated into British Airways' [[Executive Club]]. British Airways would support a [[Swiss franc|CHF]]50 million [[line of credit|credit facility]] to Swiss, secured against London Heathrow's slots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Swiss International to join Oneworld airline alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=1282|publisher=Oneworld|date=23 September 2003|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BA and Swiss Agree Commercial Pact|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/media/press_releases/2003/Pages/pr_20030923.aspx|publisher=[[Swiss International Air Lines]]|date=23 September 2003|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; One month later, both airlines formally signed a new bilateral cooperation agreement on 22 October and began with shared operations between London Heathrow and three Swiss cities, included [[Basel]], [[Geneva]] and [[Zurich]]. It was later extended to all flights between Geneva and London, included [[London City Airport|London City]], [[London Gatwick Airport|London Gatwick]] and London Heathrow airports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=British Airways and Swiss Formally Seal Collaboration|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/media/press_releases/2003/Pages/pr_20031023.aspx|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=23 September 2003|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BA Collaboration Extended to Geneva-London Services|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/media/press_releases/2004/Pages/pr_20040212.aspx|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=12 February 2004|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Swiss announced on 3 June 2004 that it had decided not to proceed with the integration of Swiss Travel Club into British Airway's Executive Club under the present conditions. The airline stated the costs involved with the integration and drawbacks outweigh the projected mid- to long-term benefits. The termination of the proposed frequent flyer programme integration meant that the bilateral commercial agreement between the two airlines could not be continued, the latter being a fundamental condition of it becoming an alliance member. Hence, Swiss was released from its commitment to join the alliance. The decision, however, did not affect Swiss' exchange of slots and the CHF50 million credit facility with British Airways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Swiss Elects Not to Join Oneworld|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/media/press_releases/2004/Pages/pr_20040603.aspx|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=3 June 2004|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld releases Swiss International Air Lines from its commitment to join the global alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=2066|publisher=Oneworld|date=3 June 2004|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The airline was later taken over by [[Lufthansa]] in 2005 due to heavy losses and joined [[Star Alliance]] in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Results for the 2003 business year|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/financial_information/financial_reports/Documents/2003/0323_mme_jahresergebnis.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=23 March 2004|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=SWISS improves EBIT by CHF 376 million|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/financial_information/financial_reports/Documents/2004/20050311_media_release_e_final.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=11 March 2005|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=SWISS takes off into a new future with Lufthansa|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/media/press_releases/2005/Pages/pr_20050322.aspx|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=22 March 2005|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Swiss is the 17th Member of Star Alliance|url=http://www.swiss.com/web/EN/about_swiss/media/press_releases/2006/Pages/pr_20060407.aspx|publisher=Swiss International Air Lines|date=7 April 2006|accessdate=27 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2005â2006 new recruits===
[[British Airways]] terminated its franchise agreement with Regional Air, the trading name for Airkenya Aviation Ltd, following Regional Air's suspension on flights operated as part of the franchise agreement in mid April 2005. This also meant the airline would no longer be a Oneworld affiliate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Regional Air no longer a Oneworld affiliate as BA terminates its franchise agreement|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=4782|publisher=Oneworld|date=19 April 2005|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the alliance pressed ahead and embarked on one of the biggest expansions in its young history. On 17 October 2005, the alliance welcomed [[Royal Jordanian]], its first airline from the [[Levant]], [[Middle East]] and [[Persian Gulf|Gulf]] region. It is also the first airline to accept an invitation to join the alliance for more than five years.&lt;ref name=RJ&gt;{{cite press release|title=Royal Jordanian to join Oneworld airline alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=6017|publisher=Oneworld|date=17 October 2005|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asia]]'s largest airline group, [[Japan Airlines]] (JAL) announced their decision to apply to join the alliance on 25 October 2005. The airline stated their decision was in line with its corporate policy to always think and act from the customer's point of view. Since both parties share the same purpose and objectives, the Oneworld membership would be in the best interests of the airline's plans to further develop the airline and its strong commitment to provide the very best to its customers.&lt;ref name=JL&gt;{{cite press release|title=JAL Decision to Seek Oneworld Membership|url=http://press.jal.co.jp/en/release/200510/000611.html|publisher=[[Japan Airlines]]|date=25 October 2005|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The year was rounded off with [[Hungary|Hungarian]] flag carrier, [[MalÃ©v]] accepted a formal invitation to join the alliance on 22 November 2005. It followed a [[Memorandum of Understanding|MOU]] reached between the airline and the alliance in May 2005.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{cite press release|title=MalÃ©v invited to join Oneworld alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=6289|publisher=Oneworld|date=22 November 2005|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

JAL and Oneworld exchanged a MOU on 8 February 2006, three months after JAL first indicated its intention to join the alliance. The MOU set out a [[framework]] for the remaining steps to be taken before the airline could be formally invited to join. On 5 June 2006, JAL accepted a formal letter of invitation to join the alliance and would offer Oneworld services and benefits in early 2007. Five members of the JAL Group would also join the alliance as affiliate members, these included [[J-Air]], [[JAL Express]], [[JALways]], [[Japan Asia Airways]] and [[Japan Transocean Air]].&lt;ref name=JL2&gt;{{cite press release|title=Japan Airlines completes first step to Oneworld membership|url=http://press.jal.co.jp/en/release/200602/000521.html|publisher=Japan Airlines|date=8 February 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JL3&gt;{{cite press release|title=Japan Airlines to join Oneworld alliance early next year|url=http://press.jal.co.jp/en/release/200606/000555.html|publisher=Japan Airlines|date=5 June 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidiaries and franchises â part 2===
The alliance would further strengthen its network in [[Latin America]] when [[LAN Airlines|LAN]]'s two subsidiaries, [[LAN Argentina]] and [[LAN Ecuador]], were announced as the alliance's newest affiliate members on 31 October 2006. [[LAN Argentina]] launched passenger and cargo services in June 2005 from its home base in [[Buenos Aires]], while [[LAN Ecuador]] launched its services in April 2003 from its home base in [[Guayaquil]]. Both airlines would officially join their sister airlines and offer alliance's services and benefits on 1 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=LAN Argentina and LAN Ecuador to join Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=8856|publisher=Oneworld|date=31 October 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=LAN Argentina and LAN Ecuador to join Oneworld on 1 April|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=9728|publisher=Oneworld|date=1 March 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Cathay Pacific]] newly acquired wholly owned subsidiary, [[Dragonair]], would become an affiliate member of the alliance. Dragonair [[CEO]] Kenny Tang said: &quot;Becoming an affiliate member of Oneworld is an exciting development for Dragonair and is another benefit to result from us joining the Cathay Pacific Group.&quot; It would officially be on board the alliance on 1 November 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Dragonair to Join Oneworld Global Alliance|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=4b107709f8510110VgnVCM10000021d21c39____|publisher=[[Dragonair]]|date=13 December 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Dragonair to Join Oneworld Alliance on November 1|url=http://www.dragonair.com/da/en_HK/aboutus/pressroomdetails?refID=ea6e1ac93f885110VgnVCM10000010d21c39____|publisher=Dragonair|date=3 September 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, on 5 March 2007, the alliance bid farewell to one of its affiliate members and British Airways subsidiary, [[BA Connect]]. BA Connect's [[United Kingdom|UK]] regional operations were sold to [[Flybe]] on 3 November 2006, in return for a 15 percent stake in the latter. Approximately 50 UK regional routes are affected by the sale, however, [[Belfast City]] and [[Southampton]] would remain linked to the alliance network through other British Airways and alliance members. BA Connect's operations from London City Airport and between [[Manchester]] and [[New York City|New York]] would be retained and operated by another British Airways subsidiary [[BA CityFlyer]] and the airline itself, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Proposed sale of BA Connect to Flybe|url=http://bapress.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bapress.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=7274&amp;p_created=1162537804&amp;p_sid=2K8boMEj&amp;p_accessibility=0&amp;p_redirect=&amp;p_lva=7392&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9Nyw3JnBfcHJvZHM9JnBfY2F0cz0wJnBfcHY9JnBfY3Y9JnBfcGFnZT0xJnBfc2VhcmNoX3RleHQ9Rmx5YmU*&amp;p_li=&amp;p_topview=1|publisher=[[British Airways]]|date=3 November 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BA Connect UK regional network no longer part of Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=9782|publisher=Oneworld|date=5 March 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2007 expansion===
Oneworld completed the biggest expansion in its young history with Japan Airlines, MalÃ©v and Royal Jordanian joined as full members and offered alliance's services and benefits on 1 April 2007. Furthermore, Japan Airlines' subsidiaries J-Air, JAL Express, JALways, Japan Asia Airways and Japan Transocean Air, and LAN's subsidiaries LAN Argentina and LAN Ecuador joined the alliance as affiliate members on the same day. Together with the alliance existing members and their affiliates, Oneworld served almost 700 [[airport]]s in nearly 150 countries with 9,000 daily departures; and carried around 315 million passengers with a fleet of almost 2,500 aircraft. Premium status frequent flyers from JAL Global Club, MalÃ©v Duna Club and Royal Jordanian Plus could have access to the 400 [[airport lounge]]s worldwide belonging to all the member airlines.&lt;ref name=JLMARJ&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld becomes ten of the world's biggest and best airlines as Japan Airlines, MalÃ©v and Royal Jordanian board|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=9869|publisher=Oneworld|date=1 April 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the same day, [[Aer Lingus]] voluntarily exited the alliance due to a fundamental change to its business strategy and repositioned itself as a low fares point-to-point carrier; while the alliance's strategy is the multi-sector, premium, frequent international travellers' market. However, the airline would maintain frequent flyer programme partnerships with some of the alliance members. Moreover, the airline would continue to participate in the alliance's Global Explorer round-the-world fare product.&lt;ref name=EIleave&gt;{{cite press release|title=Aer Lingus plans to leave Oneworld|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=7471|publisher=Oneworld|date=30 May 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EIleave2&gt;{{cite press release|title=Aer Lingus' withdrawal date set as 1 April 2007|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=8613|publisher=Oneworld|date=29 September 2006|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Subsidiaries and franchises â part 3===
The alliance said farewell to its affiliate member and British Airways' franchisee [[BMED]] on 27 October 2007, following the purchase of the airline by one of British Airways UK archrival [[BMI (airline)|BMI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=McWhirter|first=Alex|title=Bmi takes over Bmed|url=http://www.businesstraveller.com/news/bmi-takes-over-bmed|publisher=[[Business Traveller]]|date=2 February 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=BMED to cease being Oneworld affiliate|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=9936|publisher=Oneworld|date=26 March 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Oneworld greeted its latest affiliate member and Cathay Pacific wholly owned subsidiary [[Dragonair]] on board the alliance on 1 November 2007. Dragonair had the biggest network into mainland China for a non-China based carrier, with about 400 departures a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=China's best airline Dragonair now part of Oneworld alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=11166|publisher=Oneworld|date=1 November 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the alliance said goodbye to another two affiliate members as British Airways continued the strategy of reducing its UK franchises. British Airways [[Chief Executive Officer]] [[Willie Walsh (Irish businessman)|Willie Walsh]] said: &quot;UK franchises have outlived their purpose.&quot; The first franchisee [[GB Airways]] exited the alliance on 30 March 2008, following its purchase by [[EasyJet]]. British Airways intended to start services on London Heathrow to [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and [[MÃ¡laga]] and from London Gatwick to Faro, [[Gibraltar]], [[Ibiza]], MÃ¡laga, [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]] and [[Tunis]], which were operated under the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=British Airways ends UK franchises|url=http://bapress.custhelp.com/cgi-bin/bapress.cfg/php/enduser/std_adp.php?p_faqid=7392&amp;p_created=1193293370&amp;p_sid=5IljPdBj&amp;p_accessibility=0&amp;p_redirect=&amp;p_lva=&amp;p_sp=cF9zcmNoPTEmcF9zb3J0X2J5PSZwX2dyaWRzb3J0PSZwX3Jvd19jbnQ9MiwyJnBfcHJvZHM9JnBfY2F0cz0mcF9wdj0mcF9jdj0mcF9wYWdlPTEmcF9zZWFyY2hfdGV4dD1CTUVE&amp;p_li=&amp;p_topview=1|publisher=British Airways|date=25 October 2007|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=GBLogan&gt;{{cite press release|title=GB Airways and Loganair to cease being Oneworld affiliates|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=11853|publisher=Oneworld|date=25 October 2007|accessdate=7 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance bid farewell to one of its affiliate member [[Japan Asia Airways]] on 31 March 2008, following the airline's consolidation into its parent, Japan Airlines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=æ¥æ¬ã¢ã¸ã¢èªç©ºããæ¥æ¬èªç©ºãã¨ã¢ã¼ãããã³ããå¨æ¥ç©ºã¸ããã³ã¿ãã|url=http://www.taiwanembassy.org/JP/ct.asp?xItem=54009&amp;ctNode=3522&amp;mp=202&amp;nowPage=7&amp;pagesize=50|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Taipei Economic and Cultural Representative Office]]|date=1 April 2008|accessdate=13 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second British Airways franchisee [[Loganair]] left the alliance on 25 October 2008, following the ending of its franchise agreement with the airline.

===Tenth anniversary===

In February 2009, Oneworld celebrated its 10th anniversary with its 10 member airlines â [[American Airlines]], [[British Airways]], [[Cathay Pacific]], [[Finnair]], [[Iberia Airlines|Iberia]], [[Japan Airlines]], [[LAN Airlines|LAN]], [[MalÃ©v]], [[Qantas]] and [[Royal Jordanian]]. In the past [[decade]], membership has doubled from an initial five members to ten members now; its member airlines carried a total of 2.5 billion passengers and generated almost [[US$]]500 [[1,000,000,000 (number)|billion]], â¬450 million in revenue from passenger activities. Alliance fares and sales products generated US$5 billion, â¬2.5 billion in revenue alone, with two-thirds or almost US$3 billion, â¬1.5 billion would not have been generated if the alliance did not exist.&lt;ref name=10thA&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld airlines renew their commitment to build on the value the alliance offers customers worldwide - including a standard Oneworld livery|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=16589|publisher=Oneworld|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld airlines benefit by US$5 billion from alliance fares and sales activities alone in its first ten years|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=16588|publisher=Oneworld|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the celebration and to increase awareness of the 10-member alliance, all the alliance member airlines decorated a proportion of their aircraft fleets in a new standard Oneworld livery â around 40 aircraft in total, mainly types that fly on international routes. The alliance also unveiled a special version of its logo, featuring the text &quot;10 years&quot; printed behind the word Oneworld as a watermark on its round blue orb. In addition, a &quot;10 percent off for 10 weeks to mark its 10th birthday&quot; offer on all the alliance fare products and a competition to win two [[Business Class]] round-the-world tickets for telling what other services and benefits they would like to see the alliance offering.&lt;ref name=10thA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=10 per cent off for 10 weeks to mark its 10th birthday - Oneworld cuts prices of all its alliance fares|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=16587|publisher=Oneworld|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Tell us what you'd like Oneworld to do for you - and you could win a round-the-world Business Class trip for two|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=16584|publisher=Oneworld|date=3 February 2009|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009â2011 new recruits and expansion ===
On 26 May 2009, [[Russia]]n airline [[S7 Airlines]] was unanimously elected to the alliance by the ten existing members and became a full member on 15 November 2010. The airline has one of the most extensive networks covering Russia and the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS) and will add 54 cities to the alliance map, with 35 of them in Russia. The airline's charter subsidiary [[Globus Airlines]] is not included in the alliance agreement. As a first step, S7 Airlines' network was added to the alliance's Global Explorer round-the-world fare product, offered by all the alliance and selected non-alliance members.&lt;ref name=S7&gt;{{cite press release|title=Russia's S7 Airlines to join Oneworld alliance|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=18020|publisher=Oneworld|date=26 May 2009|accessdate=7 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, the airline group suspended all operations from 28 August 2010 until further notice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=CMA files for Chapter 15|url=http://mexicanainforma.com/press-releases/2010/8/3/press-release-04-cma-files-for-chapter-15.html|publisher=[[Mexicana de AviaciÃ³n|Mexicana]]|date=3 August 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MXsuspension&gt;{{cite press release|title=Mexicana group suspends operations|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=22709|publisher=Oneworld|date=31 August 2010|accessdate=31 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 February 2010, [[India]]'s [[Kingfisher Airlines]] was lined up to join the alliance after signing a [[memorandum of understanding]] by its Chairman [[Vijay Mallya]] and Chief Executives from the alliance's 11 existing member airlines, subject to Indian regulatory approval. The airline applied to India's Ministry of Civil Aviation for authority to proceed with its membership of Oneworld. A target date for the airline to join will be confirmed once this approval is gained, which expected to start flying as part of the alliance during 2011. However, the airline decided to delay its entry date by a year. It is now expected to join in early 2012. Kingfisher Airlines will add 58 Indian cities to the alliance map, it is already a participating airline in the alliance's Global Explorer round-the-world fare product.&lt;ref name=IT&gt;{{cite press release|title=Indiaâs Kingfisher Airlines set to join  Oneworld alliance|url=http://www.flykingfisher.com/media-center/press-releases/india%E2%80%99s-kingfisher-airlines-set-to-join-oneworld-alliance.aspx|publisher=[[Kingfisher Airlines]]|date=23 February 2010|accessdate=23 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits and services==
===Premium status===
Oneworld has three premium status levels â Ruby, Sapphire and Emerald â based on the customer's tier status in the member airline's [[frequent flyer programme]]. Emerald status is the highest level in each member's programme and all of the statuses are recognised by each of the member airlines. The premium statuses have no specific requirements of their own; membership is based solely on the frequent flyer programmes of the individual member airline. Alliance benefits are only available to passengers on scheduled flights that are both operated and marketed by a member airline.&lt;ref name=OWTier&gt;{{cite web|title=Oneworld Tier Status|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/ffp/oneworld-status|publisher=Oneworld|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 4 or more members - &gt;75% located in 1 terminal/concourse/area, excluding exclusive use terminals/concourses/areas. --&gt;

===Customer service initiatives===
====Interline electronic ticket====
On 21 April 2005, Oneworld became the first [[airline alliance]] to enable its customers to fly throughout its members' network on [[electronic ticket]]s (E-Tickets) only, with the completion of [[interlining|interline]] e-ticketing (IET) links between all its member airlines. E-Ticket made checking-in quicker and smoother as all the information is stored electronically, it cannot be lost or risk being stolen like a traditional paper ticket. In addition, E-Ticket enabled customers to access new automated features, like self-service, mobile or internet check-in.&lt;ref name=IET&gt;{{cite press release|title=Oneworld is first alliance to complete interline e-ticketing with links now in place between all partner airlines|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=4799|publisher=Oneworld|date=21 April 2005|accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan Airlines â 2007 special Oneworld livery===
In 2007, [[Japan Airlines]] (JAL) painted two of its [[Boeing 777]] aircraft, a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-200ER]] (JA704J) and a [[Boeing 777|Boeing 777-300]] (JA8941), in a special Oneworld livery to mark its entrance into the alliance. The first aircraft (JA704J) took off from JAL's main international hub [[Narita International Airport|Tokyo Narita International Airport]] as Japan Airlines Flight 441 bound for [[Moscow]] on 16 April 2007. The design featured &quot;a huge globe in the distinctive horizon blue of Oneworld, painted on the centre of the aircraft, with a stylised motif to symbolise the convenience, comfort, value and choice available to passengers throughout the alliance's comprehensive global network&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=First JAL aircraft with special Oneworld livery makes debut flight|url=http://www.oneworld.com/ow/news/details?objectID=10054|publisher=Oneworld|date=16 April 2007|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan Airlines (JA704J) Pictures &amp; Photos|url=http://www.airliners.net/search/photo.search?regsearch=JA704J|publisher=Airliners.net|accessdate=8 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standard oneworld livery===
The new (optional) standard oneworld livery was introduced as part of the alliance's 10th anniversary celebration in February 2009. It features the alliance name in large letters that are almost {{convert|2|m|ft}} tall and the alliance logo along the side of their [[fuselage]], against a white or a polished metal background. The name of the operating member airline will be placed in smaller lettering in a standard position at the front of the aircraft below the alliance name and logo. Each member airline will also retain its regular [[vertical stabilizer|tailfin]] design.&lt;ref name=10thA/&gt;
