'''Yucca Mountain Johnny''' is a [[cartoon]] [[miner]] created by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) to present information to children on [[nuclear waste]] disposal and the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository|Yucca Mountain Project]]. Serving as the virtual guide for the DOE's '''Youth Zone''' web site and appearing &quot;[[live-action]]&quot; in [[Nevada]] schools, Yucca Mountain Johnny has drawn harsh criticism as a [[propaganda]] tool.

[[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Shelley Berkley]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-NV) has called Yucca Mountain Johnny &quot;the Department of Energy's [[Joe Camel]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=friess&gt;{{cite journal

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to a cartoon [[mascot]] for the tobacco industry which drew criticism for targeting children. Representative [[Jon Porter]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-NV) stated that &quot;to sell the Yucca Mountain Project to our children through the use of a cartoon character is an irresponsible and desperate act.&quot;&lt;ref name=tetreault&gt;{{cite journal

DOE spokesperson Craig Stevens, however, defended Yucca Mountain Johnny, arguing that it &quot;teaches hydrology, geology, and earth science&quot;, and that it is &quot;part of our duty to explain to the public what we're doing.&quot;&lt;ref name=friess /&gt; Support for Yucca Mountain Johnny was present in the House of Representatives, with Representative [[Joe Barton]] (R-[[Texas|TX]]) stating that &quot;nobody questions the accuracy or truth of what's on the Web site&quot;, and Representative [[Dave Hobson|David Hobson]] (R-[[Ohio|OH]]) stating that it &quot;may have a place in teaching kids.&quot;&lt;ref name=ap&gt;{{cite news

Berkley, who is a vocal opponent of a Yucca Mountain waste repository, attempted to add an amendment to an energy spending bill that would have prevented the funds from being used for the DOE '''Youth Zone''' web site.&lt;ref name=ap /&gt; The amendment was defeated, 271-147.

The Youth Zone now appears to have been removed from the DOE's website, although copies of the site can be found via the [[Wayback machine]]&lt;ref name=waybackm&gt;{{cite
