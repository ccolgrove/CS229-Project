Hoping to rebound from their road loss to the Panthers, the Saints flew to [[Wembley Stadium]] for the 2008 International Series game with quarterback [[Drew Brees]]' former team, the [[San Diego Chargers]].  For the game, New Orleans was registered as the home team.

In the first quarter, the Saints drew first blood as rookie kicker [[Taylor Mehlhaff]] got a 23-yard field goal.  The Chargers responded with kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] getting a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, New Orleans got a huge lead as Brees completed a 12-yard TD pass to WR [[Devery Henderson]] (with a failed PAT), along with RB [[Deuce McAllister]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  San Diego would answer with QB [[Philip Rivers]] completing a 12-yard TD pass to RB [[LaDainian Tomlinson]], yet the Saints increased their lead as Brees completed a 30-yard TD pass to WR [[Lance Moore]].  The Chargers closed out the half as Rivers completed a 12-yard TD pass to TE [[Antonio Gates]].

In the third quarter, New Orleans added on to their lead as Brees completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE [[Mark Campbell]], yet San Diego continued to hang around as Kaeding got a 24-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Saints continued its scoring with FB [[Mike Karney]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  The Chargers tried to rally as Kaeding nailed a 31-yard field goal, Rivers completed a 14-yard TD run to WR [[Vincent Jackson]], and Brees giving San Diego a safety by throwing an incomplete pass into the back of his own end zone.  Fortunately, New Orleans' defense held on for the victory.

With the win, the Saints went into their bye week at 4-4.

Coming off a heartbreaking loss to Tampa Bay, the [[New Orleans Saints]] returned home to host the [[Atlanta Falcons]]. The Falcons appeared to be on the move on their first drive, but they came up empty after Saints cornerback [[Jason David]] intercepted Falcons rookie quarterback [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] at the Saints' 26-yard line. From there, it took New Orleans only three plays to get into the end zone as  [[Reggie Bush]] ran for 43 yards and then caught a 5-yard touchdown pass from [[Drew Brees]] for the only score of the quarter.

In the second quarter, the Saints added to their lead with a 26-yard field goal from [[Garrett Hartley]]. The Atlanta offense finally woke up from there as Ryan completed a 59-yard pass to [[Roddy White]], leading to an eventual 5-yard touchdown run by [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]], cutting the deficit to 10-7. New Orleans would respond with a 10-play, 3:39 drive that culminated in a 46-yard field goal by Hartley, extending the Saints' lead to 13-7. Ryan then completed five of six passes on the Falcons' next drive, the last of which was a 2-yard touchdown pass to [[Brian Finneran]], giving the Falcons a 14-13 lead. The Saints would then use the final 2:13 of the half to drive to the Falcons' 7-yard line, and closed out the half on a 25-yard field goal by Hartley to give New Orleans a 16-14 haltime lead.

After an exchange of punts to begin the second half, Atlanta drove down to the Saints' 5-yard line by virtue of a long 18-play, 9:15 drive, only to settle for a 23-yard field goal by [[Jason Elam]], which nevertheless gave the Falcons a 17-16 lead. New Orleans responded with an 11-play drive bridging the third and fourth quarters, which ended with Brees' 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Pierre Thomas (American football)|Pierre Thomas]], with a failed two-point conversion. The Falcons then marched 73 yards in 11 plays, the last being a 12-yard touchdown scramble by Ryan, plus a successful two-point conversion to [[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]]. But thanks to an 88-yard return by Thomas on the ensuing kickoff, the Saints' drive started off at the Falcons' 16-yard line. With the Saints facing 4th-and 1 at the 7 yard line, New Orleans coach [[Sean Payton]] elected to go for it rather than attempt a game-tying 25-yard field goal. Fullback [[Mike Karney]] came through for the Saints, getting a first down, and then Thomas gave the Saints a 29-25 lead with a 5-yard touchdown run. The Falcons could not get past their own 35-yard line on the ensuing drive, and they chose to punt the ball back to the Saints' offense, which ran out the clock.

With the win, the Saints kept their slim playoff hopes alive at 7-6. Pierre Thomas piled up 197 all-purpose yards, including 109 yards from scrimmage, 102 of it rushing. This was also the second time in a row that the Saints followed a heartbreaking loss to the Buccaneers with a win over the Falcons.
