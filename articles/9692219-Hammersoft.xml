<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="9692219" ns="0" title="Parable of the empty jar"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''Parable of the Empty Jar''' (also known as the ''Parable of the Woman With a Jar''),  is a [[parable]] attributed to [[Jesus]].  However, it appears in none of the [[Canonical gospels]] of the [[New Testament]] but only in the non-canonical [[Gospel of Thomas]]. According to the [[Gospel of Thomas]] 97 Jesus said:
:''&quot;The kingdom of the father is like a certain woman who was carrying a jar full of meal. While she was walking on the road, still some distance from home, the handle of the jar broke and the meal emptied out behind her on the road. She did not realize it; she had noticed no accident. When she reached her house, she set the jar down and found it empty.&quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html G. Thomas 97&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Authenticity==
The scholars of the [[Jesus Seminar]] gave the Parable of the Empty Jar a &quot;pink&quot; rating, indicating 
that it is in their opinion probably, but not certainly, an authentic saying of Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Funk |first=Robert Walter |title=The Five Gospels: What Did Jesus Really Say? the Search for the Authentic Words of Jesus|url=http://books.google.com/?id=SRI-c0Pf3soC&amp;pg=RA1-PA525&amp;lpg=RA1-PA525&amp;dq=the+five+gospels+assassin|edition=first HarperCollins paperback|year=1997 |publisher=HarperCollins |location= |isbn=006063040X |pages=552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholars of the Seminar noted parallels with the [[The Leaven|parable of the leaven]], which immediately precedes the parable of the empty jar in the [[Gospel of Thomas]] and the [[parable of the mustard seed]]: in all three the kingdom starts with something &quot;unnoticed or unexpected or modest&quot;. However, the work of the Jesus Seminar has been criticized by other scholars.&lt;ref&gt;[[Birger A. Pearson]], ''[http://www.veritas-ucsb.org/library/pearson/seminar/index.html The Gospel According to the Jesus Seminar]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[N.T. Wright]], ''[http://www.ntwrightpage.com/Wright_Five_Gospels.pdf Five Gospels but No Gospel]'', originally published in ''Authenticating the Activities of Jesus'', ed. Bruce Chilton and Craig A. Evans. Leiden: Brill, 1999, 83â120.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
This parable has been given a wide variety of interpretations.  It may be a warning against letting the &quot;Kingdom&quot;, which according to ''Thomas 3'' is &quot;inside of you and outside of you&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gnosis.org/naghamm/gthlamb.html Gospel of Thomas (Lambdin Translation) - The Nag Hammadi Library&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; slip away like the lost flour:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The emptiness of the jar may represent an empty life:  &quot;people who live their lives in the world [...] carry jars they think are full, but discover, even after much activity, that they are empty&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Another interpretation is that the parable refers to &quot;the imperceptible coming of the Kingdom&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

One commentator recasts the emptiness of the jar in a positive light by highlighting the contrast of the image of the empty jar with the expected ending of the woman finding a full jar: such a &quot;happy ending&quot; would be &quot;fairy tale religiosity&quot; whereas &quot;emptiness in the world is what is critical to eventual spiritual fullness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
