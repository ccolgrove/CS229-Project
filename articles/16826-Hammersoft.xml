It is also the capital of the [[Kabul Province]], located in the eastern section of [[Afghanistan]]. According to the 2011 official estimates, the population of Kabul [[metropolitan area]] is 3.9 million people.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO&quot;&gt;&quot;Afghanistan Statistical Yearbook 2008/09&quot;, Central Statistics Office&lt;/ref&gt;

It is an economic and cultural centre, situated 5,900&amp;nbsp;ft (1,800&amp;nbsp;m) above sea level in a narrow valley, wedged between the [[Hindu Kush]] mountains along the [[Kabul River]]. The city is linked with [[Kandahar]], [[Herat]] and [[Mazar-e Sharif]] via a circular highway that stretches across the country. It is also the start of the main road to [[Jalalabad]] and further to [[Peshawar]], Pakistan.

Kabul's main products include [[fruit|fresh]] and [[dried fruit]], [[nut (fruit)|nuts]], [[Afghan rug]]s, [[leather]] and sheep skin products, domestic clothes and furniture, and [[antique]] [[replica]]s, but the wars since 1978 have limited the economic productivity of the city. Economic productivity has improved since the establishment of the [[Presidency of Hamid Karzai|Karzai administration]] in late 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Kabul_-_Reconstruction/id/594323 |title=Kabul: Encyclopedia II - Kabul - Reconstruction |publisher=Experiencefestival.com |date= |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[Saur Revolution|Marxist revolution]] in 1978, the city has been a target of anti-Afghanistan forces such as the [[Haqqani network]], [[Quetta Shura]], [[Hezb-e-Islami Gulbuddin|Hezbi Islami]], [[al-Qaida]] and other terrorist groups. While the Afghan government tries to rebuild the war-torn city, these anti-Afghanistan forces are planning more attacks in which majority of their victims are ordinary poor Afghan civilians.

The Kabul Turks and Hindus built a huge defensive wall around the city to protect it from future invaders. This wall has survived until today and is also considered a historical site.

Over the centuries to come, the city was successively controlled by the [[Samanids]], [[Ghaznavids]], [[Ghurids]], and [[Kartids]].

In the 14th century, Kabul rose again as a trading centre under the kingdom of [[Timur]] (''Tamerlane''). In 1504, the city fell to [[Babur]] from the north and made into his headquarters, which became one of the principal cities of his later [[Mughal Empire]]. In 1525, Babur described [[Kabulistan]] in [[baburnama|his memoirs]] by writing that:{{Quote|''In the [[Kabulistan|country of KÄbul]] there are many and various tribes.

[[Mirza Muhammad Haidar Dughlat]], a poet from [[Hindustan]] who visited at the time wrote: ''&quot;Dine and drink in Kabul: it is mountain, desert, city, river and all else.&quot;'' It was from here that Babur began his 1526 conquest of Hindustan, which began east of the [[Indus River]] that was ruled by the [[Pashtun people|Afghan]] [[Lodi dynasty]] at the time. Babur wished to be buried in Kabul whenever he died, a city he had always loved, but at first he was buried in [[Agra]], Hindustan (now India). Roughly nine years later his remains were dug back up and re-buried at the [[Bagh-e Babur|Gardens of Babur]] in Kabul by the order of one of Babur's wives. The inscription on his tomb contains Persian words penned which state: Ø§Ú¯Ø±ÙØ±Ø¯ÙØ³ Ø±ÙÛ Ø²ÙÛÙ Ø§Ø³Øª ÙÙÛÙ Ø§Ø³Øª Ù ÙÙÛÙ Ø§Ø³Øª Ù ÙÙÛÙ Ø§Ø³Øª (If there is a paradise on earth, it is this, it is this, it is this!)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Studies in Mughal History |last=Agrawal |first=Ashvini |isbn=81-208-2326-5 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publisher |date=1983-12-01 |accessdate=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

In 1537, [[Humayun]] was elsewhere on an expedition, when [[Sher Khan]], a governor under Babur turned against his new master and overran the state of [[Bengal]] to established the [[Sur dynasty|Sur Empire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Columbia&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ce6/people/A0844870.html |title=Sher Khan|work=|publisher=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]]|year=2010|accessdate=2010-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst Humayun fled to persia to seek the alliance of [[Shah Tahmasp I]] and recaptured Kabul from his brother [[Kamran Mirza]] with Persian military assistance and then against the Sur Dynasty and his own rebellious family members. By 1555, he had regained his throne.&lt;ref&gt;Nahavandi and Bomati pp.286â287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Savory pp.66â67&lt;/ref&gt;

====Durrani Empire====

[[File:Shuja Shah Durrani of Afghanistan in 1839.jpg|thumb|[[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]], the last [[Durrani Empire|Durrani King]], sitting at his court inside the [[Bala Hissar]] before it was destroyed by the [[British Empire|British Army]]]]
[[Nader Shah|Nader Shah Afshar]] invaded and occupied the city briefly in 1738 but was assassinated nine years later. [[Ahmad Shah Durrani]], who commanded 4,000 [[Durrani|Abdali]] [[Afghan (name)|Afghans]] under Nader Shah, asserted [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]] rule in 1747 and further expanded his new ''Afghan Empire''. His ascension to power marked the beginning of Afghanistan.
His son [[Timur Shah Durrani]], after inheriting power, transferred the capital of Afghanistan from [[Kandahar]] to Kabul in 1776.&lt;ref name=&quot;Brit-Kabul&quot;/&gt; Timur Shah died in 1793 and was succeeded by his son [[Zaman Shah Durrani]]. The first European to visit Kabul was the 18th century English traveller [[George Foster]], who described it as &quot;the best and cleanest city in Asia&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Kabul&quot;/&gt;

In 1826, the kingdom was claimed by [[Dost Mohammad Khan]] and taken from him by the [[First Anglo-Afghan War|British Indian Army]] in 1839, who installed the unpopular [[Shuja Shah Durrani|Shah Shuja]]. An 1841 local uprising resulted in the loss of the British mission and the subsequent [[Massacre of Elphinstone's Army]] of approximately 16,000 foreign forces, which included civilians and [[camp follower]]s on their retreat from Kabul to [[Jalalabad]]. In 1842 the British returned, plundering [[Bala Hissar]] in revenge before fleeing back to [[British Raj|British India]] (now Pakistan). Dost Mohammed returned to the throne.

The [[Second Anglo-Afghan War|British and Indian forces]] invaded in 1878 as Kabul was under [[Sher Ali Khan]]'s rule, but the British residents were again massacred. The invaders again came in 1879 under [[Frederick Roberts, 1st Earl Roberts|General Roberts]], partially destroying Bala Hissar before retreating to British India (Pakistan). [[Emir|Amir]] [[Abdur Rahman Khan]] was left in control of the country.

In the early 20th century King [[Amanullah Khan]] rose to power. His reforms included electricity for the city and schooling for girls. He drove a [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]], and lived in the famous [[Darul Aman Palace]]. In 1919, after the [[Third Anglo-Afghan War]], Amanullah announced Afghanistan's independence from [[International relations|foreign affairs]] at [[Id Gah Mosque|Eidgah Mosque]]. In 1929 Ammanullah Khan left Kabul due to a local uprising orchestrated by [[HabibullÄh KalakÄni|Habibullah Kalakani]] and Ammanullah's brother, [[Mohammed Nadir Shah|Nader Khan]], took control over the nation. King Nader Khan was assassinated in 1933 and the throne was left to his 19-year-old son, [[Mohammad Zahir Shah|Zahir Shah]], who became the long lasting [[King of Afghanistan]].
[[File:1950s Afghanistan - Public transport in Kabul.jpg|thumb|Life of Kabul's people in the 1950s.]]

During this period between the two World Wars France and Germany worked to help develop the country in both the technical and educational spheres. Both countries maintained high schools and lycees in the capital and provided an education for the children of elite families.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Hyman, &quot;Nationalism in Afghanistan&quot; in ''International Journal of Middle East Studies'', 34:2 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002) 305.&lt;/ref&gt; Kabul University opened in 1932 and soon was linked to both European and American universities, as well as universities in other Muslim countries in the field of Islamic studies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman, 305&quot;&gt;Hyman, 305.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s the majority of instructors at the university had degrees from Western universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hyman, 305&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Aerial view of Kabul in 1969.jpg|left|thumb|Aerial view of Kabul in 1969]]

When Zahir Shah took power in 1933 Kabul had the only 6 miles of rail in the country, few internal telegraph or phone lines and few roads. He turned to the Japanese, Germans and Italians for help developing a modern network of communications and roads.&lt;ref&gt;Nick Cullather, &quot;Damming Afghanistan: Modernization in a Buffer State&quot; in ''The Journal of American History'' 89:2 (Indiana: Organization of American Historians, 2002) 518.&lt;/ref&gt; A radio tower built by the Germans in 1937 in Kabul allowed instant communication with outlying villages.&lt;ref&gt;Cullather, 518.&lt;/ref&gt; A national bank and state cartels were organized to allow for economic modernization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cullather, 519&quot;&gt;Cullather, 519.&lt;/ref&gt;  Textile mills, power plants and carpet and furniture factories were also built in Kabul, providing much needed manufacturing and infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cullather, 519&quot;/&gt;

In 1955, the Soviet Union forwarded $100 million in credit to Afghanistan, which financed public transportation, airports, a cement factory, mechanized bakery, a five-lane highway from Kabul to the Soviet border and dams.&lt;ref&gt;Cullather, 530.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1960s, Kabul developed a [[World citizen|cosmopolitan]] mood. The first [[Marks &amp; Spencer]] store in [[Central Asia]] was built there. [[Kabul Zoo]] was inaugurated in 1967, which was maintained with the help of visiting German [[Zoology|zoologists]]. Many foreigners began flocking to Kabul with the increase in global air travels around that time. The nation's tourism industry was starting to pick up rapidly for the first time. Kabul experimented with liberalization, dropping laws requiring women to wear the burka, restrictions on speech and assembly loosened which led to student politics in the capital.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cullather, 534&quot;&gt;Cullather, 534.&lt;/ref&gt;  Socialist, Maoist and liberal factions demonstrated daily in Kabul while more traditional Islamic leaders spoke out against the failure to aid the Afghan countryside.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cullather, 534&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Day after Saur revolution in Kabul (773).jpg|thumb|The day after the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]]]]

In 1969 a religious uprising at the [[Pul-e Khishti Mosque]] protested the Soviet Union's increasing influence over Afghan politics and [[Islam|religion]]. This protest ended in the arrest of many of its organizers, including [[Muhammad Atta-ullah Faizani|Mawlana Faizani]], a popular Islamic scholar. In the early 1970s Radio Kabul began to broadcast in other languages besides Pashtun which helped to unify those minorities that often felt marginalized, however this was put to a stop with Daoud's revolution in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Hyman, &quot;Nationalism in Afghanistan&quot;, 307.&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1973, Zahir Shah was ousted in a nonviolent coup and Kabul became the capital of a republic under [[Mohammed Daoud Khan]], the new President. Daoud's revolution was actually supported by the communist party in the city, the PDP. The support of the PDP helped to prevent a violent clash in his coup in 1973. He named himself President of this new democracy and planned to institute reforms. Daoud was the long standing prime minister, and while he instituted a republic he had Soviet leanings in terms of political allies.&lt;ref&gt;John E. Haynes, &quot;Keeping Cool About Kabul&quot; in World Affairs, 145:4 (Washington, D.C.: Heldref Publications, 1983), 371.&lt;/ref&gt; He had welcomed Soviet military aid and advisors in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;Cullather, &quot;Damming Afghanistan&quot;, 528.&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, some of the people of Kabul who lived under King Zahir Shah describe the period before the April 1978 [[Saur Revolution]] as a sort of [[Golden Age|golden age]]. All the different ethnic groups or tribes of Afghanistan lived together harmoniously and thought of themselves first and foremost as Afghans. They intermarried and mixed socially.&lt;ref name=&quot;BBC-Kabul&quot;/&gt;

In the later years of his leadership, Daoud began to shift favour from the Soviet Union to Islamic nations, expressing admiration for their wealth from oil and expecting economic aid from them to quickly surpass that of the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, &quot;Keeping Cool About Kabul&quot;, 371.
&lt;/ref&gt; The slow speed of reforms however frustrated both the Western educated elite and the Russian trained army officers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes, 372&quot;&gt;Haynes, 372.&lt;/ref&gt; Daoud forced many communists out of his government, which unified the various communist factions within the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes, 372&quot;/&gt;

====Communist revolution and Soviet invasion====
{{See|Soviet war in Afghanistan|Civil war in Afghanistan}}
[[File:Evstafiev-40th army HQ-Amin-palace-Kabul.jpg|thumb|[[Tajbeg Palace]] in Kabul was used as the headquarters of the [[40th Army (Soviet Union)|Soviet 40th Army]]]]

On April 27, 1978, in the so-called Saur revolution, the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan (PDPA), seized power in a bloody military coup killing Daoud and his family along with many of his supporters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes, 372&quot;/&gt; The new communist regime  moved quickly to institute reforms. Private businesses were nationalized in the Soviet manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes, 373&quot;&gt;Haynes, 373.&lt;/ref&gt; Education was modified into the Soviet model, with lessons focusing on teaching Russian, Leninism-Marxism and learning of other countries belonging to the Soviet bloc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes, 373&quot;/&gt; Rural guerrillas and disaffected army deserters took up arms in the name of Islam, due to the communist regime's increasing rejection of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Haynes, 373&quot;/&gt; This rebellion would eventually lead to the invasion of Afghanistan by Russian forces.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, 374.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Soviet war in Afghanistan|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], on December 24, 1979, the [[Red Army]] occupied the capital. They turned the city into their command centre during the 10-year conflict between the Soviet-allied government and the [[Mujahideen]] rebels. Kabul remained relatively calm during that period as fighting was mostly in the countryside and in other major cities. The American [[Embassy]] in Kabul closed on January 30, 1989.

====Foreign interference and war civil====

After the fall of Najibullah's regime in 1992, the Afghan political parties agreed on a peace and power-sharing agreement (the Peshawar Accords). The Peshawar Accords created the Islamic State of Afghanistan and appointed an interim government for a transitional period. Human Rights Watch writes:
:&quot;The sovereignty of Afghanistan was vested formally in &quot;The Islamic State of Afghanistan&quot;, an entity created in April 1992, after the fall of the Soviet-backed Najibullah government. ... With the exception of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]'s [[Hezb-e Islami]], all of the parties ... were ostensibly unified under this government in April 1992. ... Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami, for its part, refused to recognize the government for most of the period discussed in this report and launched attacks against government forces and Kabul generally. ... Hekmatyar continued to refuse to join the government. Hekmatyar's Hezb-e Islami forces increased their rocket and shell attacks on the city. Shells and rockets fell everywhere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date= |url =http://www.hrw.org/en/reports/2005/07/06/blood-stained-hands|title = Blood-Stained Hands, Past Atrocities in Kabul and Afghanistan's Legacy of Impunity | publisher = [[Human Rights Watch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islamabad could not possibly expect the new Islamic government leaders, especially [Ahmad Shah] Massoud (who had always maintained his independence from Pakistan), to subordinate their own nationalist objectives in order to help Pakistan realize its regional ambitions. ...

In December, the last of the 86 city trolley buses came to a halt because of the conflict. A system of 800 public buses continued to provide transportation services to the city. By 1993 electricity and water in the city was completely out. Initially the factions in the city aligned to fight off Hekmatyar but diplomacy inside the capital quickly broke down.&lt;ref&gt;Nazif M Shahrani, &quot;War, Factionalism and the State in Afghanistan&quot; in American Anthropologist 104:3 (Arlington, Virginia: American Anthropological Association, 2008), 719.&lt;/ref&gt;
Saudi Arabia and Iran also armed and directed Afghan militias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; A publication with the George Washington University describes:
:&quot;[O]utside forces saw instability in Afghanistan as an opportunity to press their own security and political agendas.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The National Security Archive&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2003|url =http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB97/ |title =The September 11 Sourcebooks Volume VII: The Taliban File| publisher = [[gwu.edu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Human Rights Watch, numerous Iranian agents were assisting the Shia [[Hezb-i Wahdat]] forces of [[Abdul Ali Mazari]], as Iran was attempting to maximize Wahdat's military power and influence in the new government.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Roy Gutman&quot;&gt;GUTMAN, Roy (2008): How We Missed the Story: Osama Bin Laden, the Taliban and the Hijacking of Afghanistan, Endowment of the United States Institute of Peace, 1st ed., Washington D.C.&lt;/ref&gt; Saudi agents of some sort, private or governmental, were trying to strengthen the Wahhabi [[Abdul Rasul Sayyaf]] and his [[Ittihad-i Islami]] faction to the same end.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Amin Saikal&quot;/&gt; Due to the groups being mainly divided by regional loyalties and/or ethnic origins the fighting quickly took on aspects of &quot;ethnic cleansing&quot; between the Shia Hazara Hezb-i Wahdat and the Wahhabi Pashtun Ittihad-i Islami forces. The goal of these two militias was to &quot;purposefully eliminate people of a different identity ... by means of large-scale slaughter, coercive relocation, extortion and other modes of intimidation, such as rape and torture.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Sidky, &quot;War, Changing Patterns of Warfare, State Collapse, and Transnational Violence in Afghanistan: 1978â2001&quot;, 870.&lt;/ref&gt; Horrific crimes were committed by individuals of different factions as described in reports by Human Rights Watch and the Afghanistan Justice Project. Tens of thousands of Kabul citizens were killed and many more fled as [[Afghan refugees|refugees]]. The [[United Nations]] estimated that 90% of the buildings in Kabul were destroyed during these years.
:&quot;Rare ceasefires, usually negotiated by representatives of [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]], [[Sibghatullah Mojaddedi]] or [[Burhanuddin Rabbani]] (the interim government), or officials from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), commonly collapsed within days,&quot; writes Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name=&quot;Human Rights Watch (4)&quot;/&gt;

In late 1994/early 1995, most of the militia factions (Hezb-i Islami, Junbish-i Milli and Hezb-i Wahdat) which had been fighting in the battle for control of Kabul were defeated militarily by forces of the Islamic State's [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Ahmad Shah Massoud]].

====Karzai administration and NATO presence====
{{See|War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)}}
[[File:Military terminal at Kabul International Airport.jpg|thumb|[[NATO]]'s military terminal at [[Kabul International Airport]]]]
In October 2001, the [[United States armed forces]] assisted by [[British Armed Forces]] provided massive air support to [[United Islamic Front for the Salvation of Afghanistan|United Front]] (Northern Alliance) ground forces during [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Operation Enduring Freedom]]. The Taliban abandoned Kabul and the United Front came to take control of the city. In December 2001, Kabul became the capital of the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]], which transformed to the present [[Karzai administration|Government of Afghanistan]] that is led by President [[Hamid Karzai]]. 

In early 2002 a [[NATO]]-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) was deployed in Kabul and from there they began taking over other parts of the country. The war-torn city began to see some positive development as millions of ex-pats returned to the country. Its population has grown from about 500,000 in 2001 to over 3 million by 2007. Many foreign embassies re-opened, especially the biggest [[U.S. Embassy, Kabul|U.S. Embassy]]. Afghan government institutions were also re-developed and modernized. Since 2008 the newly trained [[Afghan National Police]] (ANP) and the [[Afghan National Army]] (ANA) are in charge of security in the area, while NATO also has a heavy presence but are not patrolling the streets anymore.

While the city is being developed, it is also the scene of occasional deadly suicide bombings and explosions carried out by the [[Haqqani network]], Taliban's [[Quetta Shura]], [[Hezb-i Islami]], [[Al Qaeda]], and other anti-government elements who are allegedly supported and guided by Pakistan's [[Inter-Services Intelligence]] (ISI) spy network.&lt;ref name=US-blames-Pakistan&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.yahoo.com/pakistan-isi-urged-attacks-u-targets-officials-002201562.html |title=U.S. blames Pakistan agency in Kabul attack |publisher=Reuters |date=September 22, 2011 |accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
Kabul has a [[semi-arid climate]] ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification]] ''[[Semi-arid climate#Cold Semi-arid climates|BSk]]'') with precipitation concentrated in the winter (sometimes falling as snow) and spring months. Temperatures are relatively cool compared to much of Southwest Asia, mainly due to the high altitude of the city. Summer has very low [[humidity]], providing relief from the heat. Autumn features warm afternoons and sharply cooler evenings. Winters are cold, with a January daily average of {{convert|â2.3|Â°C|1}}. Spring is the wettest time of the year, though temperatures are generally amiable. Sunny conditions dominate year-round. The annual mean temperature is {{convert|12.1|Â°C|1}}.

==Demographics==

[[File:2011 SCF Kabul-3.jpg|thumb|Young men and women at a rock music festival inside the [[Bagh-e Babur|gardens of Babur]].]]
The population of Kabul has fluctuated since the early 1980s to the present period. It was believed to be around 500,000 in 2001 but since then many [[Afghan diaspora|Afghan expats]] began returning from [[Afghans in Pakistan|Pakistan]] and [[Afghans in Iran|Iran]] where they had taken refuge from the wars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.institute-for-afghan-studies.org/Contributions/Projects/Dr-Ittig/UrbanDev.htm#_ftn2 Urban Development In Kabul: An Overview Of Challenges And Strategies] by Dr. Annette Ittig&lt;/ref&gt; The Kabul [[metropolitan area]] has a population of about 2.8 million inhabitants these days.&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO&quot; /&gt; The wider [[Kabul Province|Kabul province]], which also includes [[rural area]]s, has a population of around 3.5 million people,&lt;ref name=&quot;CSO&quot; /&gt; while the Kabul city's population makes almost 80 percent of the total provincial population.&lt;ref name=demography&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mrrd-nabdp.org/Provincial%20Profiles/Kabul%20PDP%20Provincial%20profile.pdf |title=B.

The population of the city reflects the general [[multiethnic society|multi-ethnic]], [[multiculturalism|multi-cultural]], and [[multilingualism|multi-lingual]] characteristics of Afghanistan. There is no official government report on the exact ethnic make-over but a map appeared in the November 2003 issue of the [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] magazine showing [[Tajik people|Tajiks]] 45%, [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] 25%, [[Pashtun people|Pashtuns]] 25%, [[Uzbeks]] 2%, [[Baloch people|Baloch]] 1%, [[Turkmen people|Turkmen]] 1%, and [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Hindu]] 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/ngm/0311/feature2/images/mp_download.2.pdf |title=2003 National Geographic Population Map |format=PDF |work=Thomas Gouttierre, Center For Afghanistan Studies, [[University of Nebraska]] at Omaha; Matthew S.

Nearly all the people of Kabul are [[Muslim]], which includes the majority [[Sunni Islam|Sunnis]] and minority [[Shia Islam in Afghanistan|Shias]]. A small number of [[Sikhism in Afghanistan|Sikhs]], [[Hinduism in Afghanistan|Hindus]], and [[Christianity in Afghanistan|Christians]] are also found in the city. For example, [[Bollywood]] actress [[Celina Jaitley]] is [[Hindu]] who was born in Kabul. There is only one [[History of the Jews in Afghanistan|Jew]] in Kabul, whose name is [[Zablon Simintov]], in addition to sometime visitor Bradford Rohmer.

==Transport==
{{See|Transport in Afghanistan}}
[[File:New terminal at Kabul International Airport in 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Kabul International Airport]]]]
[[Kabul International Airport]], located {{convert|25|km}} from the centre of Kabul, is the country's main airport. It is a hub to [[Ariana Afghan Airlines]], the national airlines carrier of Afghanistan, as well as private airlines such as [[Kam Air]], [[Pamir Airways]], and [[Safi Airways]]. Regional airlines such as [[Turkish Airlines]], [[Gulf Air]], [[Indian (airline)|Indian Airlines]], [[Pakistan International Airlines]] (PIA), [[Iranian Airlines]], and others also make frequent stops at Kabul International Airport. A new international terminal was built by the government of Japan and began operation since 2008, which is the first of three terminals to be opened so far. The other two will open once air traffic to the city increases. Passengers coming from most foreign nations use mostly [[Dubai]] for flights to Kabul. Kabul Airport also has a military terminal and a section of airport is used by the [[United States armed forces]] and the [[Afghan National Air Force]]. [[NATO]] also uses the Kabul Airport, but most military traffic is based at [[Bagram Airfield]], situated north of Kabul. The [[Afghan Border Police]] and the [[Afghan National Police]] are in charge of the airport security.
[[File:Millie Bus of Kabul.jpg|left|thumb|[[Milli Bus]], which was established in the 1960s.]]

Kabul has no train service yet but the government plans to build [[Rail transport in Afghanistan|rail lines]] to connect the city with [[Mazar-i-Sharif]] in the north and [[Jalalabad]]-[[Torkham]] in the east. It also plans to build a metro rail in the future.

Long distant road journeys are made by private [[Mercedes-Benz buses|Mercedes-Benz coach buses]] or various types of vans, trucks and cars. Although nation wide bus service is available from Kabul, flying is more safer especially for foreigners. The city's public buse service ([[Milli Bus]] / &quot;National Bus&quot;) was established in the 1960s to take [[commuters]] on daily routes to many destinations. The service currently has approximately 800 buses but is gradually expanding and upgrading with more buses being added. The Kabul bus system has recently discovered a new source of revenue in whole-bus advertising from [[MTN]] similar to &quot;bus wrap&quot; advertising on public transit in more developed nations. There is also an express bus that runs from the city centre to Kabul International Airport for Safi Airways passengers. There are also white and yellow older model [[Toyota Corolla]] [[taxicab]]s just about every where in the city.

Private vehicles are on the rise in Kabul, with [[Toyota]], [[Nissan]], and other dealerships in the city. People are buying new cars as the roads and highways are being improved. Most drivers in Kabul prefer owning a Toyota Corolla, one of Afghanistan's most popular car. It has even been reported that up to 90% of cars in Kabul are Corollas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/08/26/AR2010082606430_2.html?g=0 |work=The Washington Post |title=In Afghanistan, a car for the masses |first=David |last=Nakamura |date=2010-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], [http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/05/09/2565599.htm Dodgy cars clogging Kabul's roads]&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of motorcycles many vehicles in the city operate on [[LPG]]. Gas stations are mainly private-owned and the fuel comes from Pakistan, Iran and [[Kazakhstan]]. Bicycles on the road are a common sight in the city.

==Economy==
{{See|Economy of Afghanistan}}
There are approximately 16 licensed banks in Kabul: including [[Da Afghanistan Bank]], [[Afghanistan International Bank]], [[Kabul Bank]], [[Azizi Bank]], [[Pashtany Bank]], Afghan United Bank, [[Standard Chartered Bank]], [[Punjab National Bank]], [[HBL Pakistan|Habib Bank]] and others. [[Western Union]] offices are also found in many locations throughout the city.

About {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} from downtown Kabul, in [[Bagrami District|Bagrami]], a {{convert|22|acre|ha|0|sing=on}} wide industrial complex has completed with modern facilities, which will allow companies to operate businesses there. The park has professional management for the daily maintenance of public roads, internal streets, common areas, parking areas, 24 hours perimeter security, access control for vehicles and persons.&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan Industrial Parks Development Authority...[http://www.aisa.org.af/IPD/Bagrami.htm Kabul (Bagrami)]&lt;/ref&gt; A number of factories operate there, including the $25 million Coca-Cola bottling plant and the Omaid Bahar juice factory.

A small sized indoor shopping mall ([[Kabul City Center]]) with the 4-star [[Safi Landmark Hotel]] on the top six floors opened in 2005. The [[Aga Khan Development Network]] (AKDN) opened a 5-star [[Serena Hotel]] in the same year, while the landmark [[Hotel Inter-Continental Kabul|Inter-Continental]] has been refurbished. The AKDN was also involved in the restoration work of the [[Bagh-e Babur]] (Babur Gardens). Another 5-star [[Marriott International|Marriott Hotel]] is under construction next to the [[U.S. Embassy, Kabul|U.S. Embassy]].

==Communications==
{{See|Communications in Afghanistan}}
[[GSM]]/[[GPRS]] mobile phone services in the city are provided by [[Afghan Wireless]], [[Etisalat]], [[Roshan (Telecom)|Roshan]] and [[MTN]]. In November 2006, the [[Afghan Ministry of Communications]] signed a [[US Dollar|US]] 64.5 million dollar agreement with a company (ZTE Corporation) on the establishment of a countrywide fibre optical cable network. This will improve telephone, internet, television and radio broadcast services not just in Kabul but throughout the country.&lt;ref&gt;Pajhwok Afghan News â ''Ministry signs contract with Chinese company''...[http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&amp;id=26882 Link]&lt;/ref&gt; Internet was introduced in the city in 2002 and has been expanding rapidly.

There are a number of post offices throughout the city. Package delivery services like [[FedEx]], [[TNT N.V.]], and [[DHL]] are also available.

The city has many local-language radio stations, including [[Pashto]] and [[Dari (Eastern Persian)|Dari]], as well as some programs in the English language. The Afghan government has become increasingly intolerant of Indian channels and the un-Islamic culture they bring, and has threatened to ban them.

==Education==
{{See|Education in Afghanistan|List of schools in Afghanistan}}
Public and private schools in the city have reopened since 2002 after they were shut down or destroyed during fighting in the 1980s to the late 1990s. Boys and girls are strongly encouraged to attend school under the [[Karzai administration]] but many more schools are needed not only in Kabul but throughout the country. The [[Ministry of Education (Afghanistan)|Afghan Ministry of Education]] has plans to build more schools in the coming years so that education is provided to all citizens of the country. The most well known high schools in Kabul include:
* [[Habibia High School]], a British-Afghan school founded in 1903 by King [[Habibullah Khan]].
* [[LycÃ©e Esteqlal]], a Franco-Afghan school founded in 1922.
* [[Amani High School]], a German-Afghan school for boys founded in 1924.
* [[Aisha-i-Durani School]], a German-Afghan school for girls.
* Rahman Baba High School, an American-Afghan school for boys.
[[File:Kabul Medical University in 2006.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kabul Medical University]]]]
The city's colleges and universities were renovated after 2002. Some of them have been developed recently, while others have existed since the early 1900s.

==Development projects==
[[File:Office building in Kabul.jpg|thumb|New office building]]
In late 2007 the government announced that all the residential houses situated on mountains would be removed within a year so that trees and other plants can be grown on the hills. The plan calls for a greener city and to provide residents with a more suitable place to live, on a flat surface. Once implemented it will provide water supply and electricity to each house. All the city roads will also be paved under the plan, which is to solve transportation problems.&lt;ref&gt;Pajhwok Afghan News, [http://www.pajhwok.com/viewstory.asp?lng=eng&amp;id=47260 Kabul beautification plan announced (December 17, 2007)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Afghan capital Kabul, symbolizing the spirits of all Afghans and international cooperation, sets at the heart of this highly resourceful region, with great potential to turn into a business hub for all. After 2002, the new geo-political dynamics and its subsequent business opportunities, rapid urban population growth and emergence of high unemployment, triggered the planning of urban extension towards the immediate north of Kabul, in the form of a new city.
[[File:Kabul New City.jpg|400px|thumb|left|The $35 billion ''New Kabul'' master plan, in which the city is expected to expand north towards [[Bagram Airfield]].]]

In 2006, President Hamid Karzai established an Independent Board for the Development of Kabul New City. The Board brings together key stakeholders, including relevant government agencies, as well as representation from private sector and urban specialists and economists, with cooperation from the government of [[Japan]] and French Private sector, the board prepared a master plan for the city in the context of Greater Kabul. The master plan and its implementation strategy for 2025 were endorsed by the Afghan Cabinet in early 2009. Soon, as a top priority, the initiative turned into one of the biggest commercially viable national development project of the country, expected to be led by the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dcda.gov.af/&lt;/ref&gt; A number of high rise buildings are being planned and constructed across Kabul, as part of the attempt to modernize the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://onyx.af/developmenteam.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial concept design called the [[City of Light Development]], envisioned by Dr. [[Hisham N. Ashkouri]], for the development and the implementation of a privately based investment enterprise has been proposed for multi-function commercial, historic and cultural development within the limits of the Old City of Kabul, along the southern side of the Kabul River and along Jade Meywand Avenue,&lt;ref&gt;Kabul - City of Light Project...[http://www.cityoflight-kabul.com/p11.htm link]&lt;/ref&gt; revitalizing some of the most commercial and historic districts in the City. Also incorporated in the design is a new complex for the [[National Museum of Afghanistan]]. A [[Memorandum of understanding]] has been signed between Dr. Ashkouri and [[Said Tayeb Jawad]] to undertake the project and to develop it for actual implementation over the next 20 years. Dr. Ashkouri has also presented the plan to President Karzai and has received a letter of support from the president and the Minister of Urban Development.

===NGOs===
Numerous [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), both national and international, are based in Kabul, conducting various activities to assist development in Afghanistan and provide humanitarian relief to the many victims which 30 years of war have produced.

[[Afghanistan Information Management Services]] (AIMS) provides software development, capacity development, information management, and project management services to the Afghan Government and other NGOs, thereby supporting their on-the-ground activities.

The We Are the Future (WAF) Center is a child care centre whose aim is to give children a chance to live their childhoods and develop a sense of hope. The centre is managed under the direction of the mayor's office and the international NGO. [[Glocal Forum]] serves as the fundraiser, program planner and coordinator for the WAF centre. Launched in 2004, the program is the result of a strategic partnership between the Glocal Forum, the [[Quincy Jones]] Listen Up Foundation and Mr. Hani Masri, with the support of the [[World Bank]], [[United Nations|UN]] agencies and major companies.
