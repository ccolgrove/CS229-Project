== Traditions ==
===Rivals===
*[[Old Dominion University]] - VCU's arch rival, mainly because of the similarities between the two schools. Both schools were founded by [[The College of William and Mary]] and both are urban research universities located just 90 miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.caahoops.com/2011/01/vcuodu-the-rivalry-is-just-different/ VCU/ODU: The Rivalry Is Just Differentâ¦&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often called the best college basketball rivalry in the state of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;http://fdhub.net/odu-at-vcu-sold-out/&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[University of Richmond]] - Called the [[Black &amp; Blue Classic]] in reference to the colors of each team. This rivalry consists of two schools separated by 7 miles and often has a public school vs private school mentality. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.richmond.com/lifestyles/2010/dec/10/vcu-vs-ur-ar-705330/ VCU vs. UR | Richmond.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[George Mason University]] - GMU has become more and more of rival with the recent success of both basketball teams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.topix.net/content/wapo/2011/02/rivalry-title-at-stake-as-mason-visits-vcu Rivalry, title at stake as Mason visits VCU&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rowdy Rams.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;Rowdy Ram&quot; student fans cheer on the men's basketball team.]]

The Virginia Commonwealth University men's basketball team is widely regarded as one of the most popular and successful sports programs at the university. The first varsity basketball team was fielded in 1968, and coached by [[Benny Dees]]. The present head coach is [[Shaka Smart]], who led the team to their first [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament#Final Four|Final Four]] in the 2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.

In the 2011 NCAA tournament, VCU qualified as an at-large bid, having to play in the newly formatted tournament's &quot;First Four&quot; against [[University of Southern California|USC]]. The decision to allow VCU to participate in the tournament was widely criticized among pundits and the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fogarty|first=Dan|title=Bracket Outrage!

VCU then went on to upset [[Georgetown University]] 74-56 in the round of 64. The 11th-seeded VCU Rams then upset 3rd-seeded [[Purdue University]] 94-76 to advance to the [[Sweet 16]] for the first time in school history. In the sweet sixteen, VCU defeated 10th-seeded [[Florida State University]] 72-71 on a last second bucket in overtime to advance to the [[Elite 8]] for the first time in school history. VCU beat the #1 seeded [[University of Kansas]] in the Southwest Regional final by a score of 71-61. It was the Rams' first trip to the [[Final Four]]. Against [[Butler University]] in the [[Final 4]], VCU lost 70-62, ending one of the greatest Cinderella stories of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henderson|first=Mike|title=NCAA Tournament Final Four: Is VCU the Greatest Cinderella Story of All Time?|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/646793-march-madness-is-vcu-the-greatest-cinderella-of-all-time|publisher=Bleacher Report|accessdate=August 17, 2011|date=March 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The VCU Rams finished 6th in the ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll at the end of the season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 NCAA Men's Basketball Rankings - ESPN/USA Today Coaches Poll Postseason (Mar. 29)|url=http://espn.go.com/mens-college-basketball/rankings/_/poll/2|work=National Collegiate Athletic Association|publisher=ESPN.com|accessdate=August 17, 2011|date=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the highest ranking in VCU's history and the highest ranking of any team from the [[Colonial Athletic Association|CAA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rams finish the season ranked sixth in the USA Today/ESPN Top 25 Poll|url=http://www.vcuathletics.com/sports/mbkb/2010-11/releases/20110405bzx9gm|publisher=VCUAthletics.com|accessdate=August 17, 2011|date=April 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In [[1985 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], VCU received an invitation to the NCAA men's basketball tournament as a #2 seed in its region, the highest seeding that the team has ever earned. However, it was upset in the second round of the tournament by #7 seed [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]].

[[File:VCU basketball fans 2011.jpeg|thumb|left|Students celebrate the men's basketball team's defeat against Kansas in the Elite Eight.]]

Until 2006 the team was coached by [[Jeff Capel III|Jeff Capel]], who at the time of his promotion to head coach in 2002 was the youngest coach in Division I NCAA basketball at 27 years old.  During his time with VCU, Capel compiled a 79-41 record (.658), and in his first year earned VCU 18 wins, the most ever for a first-year coach at the school.  In April 2006, Capel announced his decision to coach the [[University of Oklahoma]] [[Oklahoma Sooners|basketball team]]. He was replaced by [[Anthony Grant (basketball)|Anthony Grant]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/news/story?id=2412409 ESPN - VCU hires Gators assistant Grant as new coach - Men's College Basketball&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; formerly an assistant head coach with the 2006 NCAA champions, the [[University of Florida]].

Regular season conference champs and first-seed VCU defeated sixth-seed George Mason in the CAA championship game on March 5, 2007 to receive an automatic bid to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The Rams defeated the Patriots in a close fought game 65-59 to set a school record for wins in a season, finishing 27-6. The Rams also set a mark for the most conference wins in the regular season by any team ever in the CAA, finishing their CAA campaign 16-2 in the regular season and 3-0 in the tournament. In the first round of the 2007 NCAA tourney the 11 seeded Rams upset 6 seeded [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] by [[Eric Maynor]]'s game-winning buzzer-beater. VCU then lost in the second round to 3-seed [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pitt]] in overtime.

Notably the team was a perfect 16-0 at home. After finishing second in their conference the team headed to their first ever NCAA tournament game as the 10th seed, where the #7 seeded Rutgers eliminated them 57-51 on their home court.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vcuathletics.com/wbb/0809stats/teamcume.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009-2010 season Cunningham led the Rams to the NIT Sweet Sixteen where they were eliminated by the Syracuse.

Baseball has been played on the varsity level at Virginia Commonwealth University since 1971. The Rams play in [[The Diamond (Richmond, Virginia)|The Diamond]], located in central [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].

===Soccer===
==== Men's soccer ====
{{main|VCU Rams men's soccer}}

In 1995, Virginia Commonwealth University fielded its first varsity men's soccer team, under the helm of [[Tim Hudson]], who would manage the varsity team for the next 15 seasons. During Hudson's coaching career at VCU, he led the team to three Colonial Athletic Association tournament titles, and two CAA regular season titles. Presently, the team is coached by [[Dave Giffard]] who formerly worked as an assistant coach for the [[University of Akron]] [[Akron Zips men's soccer|Zips]]. Giffard has coached the team since 2010.&lt;ref name=giffard&gt;{{cite web|title=Bio: Dave Giffard|url=http://www.vcuathletics.com/information/directory/bios/Giffard_Dave|publisher=VCUAthletics.com|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The team's most successful run in the [[NCAA Men's Division I Soccer Championship|College Cup]], the men's NCAA Division I Soccer Tournament, came in [[2004 Division I Men's College Cup|2004]], where the Rams entered the tournament as ranked 16th in the nation, earning a bye to the second round proper. In the second round, the Rams defeated [[George Washington Colonials|George Washington]], before upsetting the number-one seeded, [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's soccer|Wake Forest Demon Deacons]] in penalty kicks. Reaching the regional finals, or quarterfinals in the entire tournament, VCU lost to eventual national finalists, the [[UC Santa Barbara Gauchos men's soccer|UC Santa Barbara Gauchos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;college cup 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=2004 College Cup|url=http://wn.com/2004_Division_I_Men's_College_Cup|publisher=World News Network|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following a string of three consecutive seasons without a berth in the CAA tournament, Hudson was fired to be subsequently replaced by Giffard. Giffard, who is the second head coach in team history, led the team to regular season runners-up in the CAA before falling in the semifinals of the playoffs.
