The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Atlanta Falcons]] season''' was the 43rd season for the team in the [[National Football League]]. Overcoming a disappointing 4-12 record, quarterback [[Michael Vick]]'s [[Bad Newz Kennels dog fighting investigation|dog fighting scandal]] and head coach [[Bobby Petrino]]'s abrupt resignation in [[2007 Atlanta Falcons season|2007]], the Falcons, who were expected to be in a rebuilding phase,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/kickoff/story?id=09000d5d80a447a7&amp;template=with-video&amp;confirm=true Falcons preview: Beginning massive rebuilding project]&lt;/ref&gt; completed the regular season with a surprising 11-5 record and earned the #5 seed in the NFC Playoffs under first-year head coach Mike Smith; however, the team would fall to the eventual NFC champion Arizona Cardinals in the wild-card round of the playoffs.

Mike Smith was named 2008 [[National Football League Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]], and quarterback [[Matt Ryan]] earned the [[National Football League Rookie of the Year Award|Offensive Rookie of the Year Award]].

[[File:Matt Ryan at Falcons at Raiders 11-2-08.JPG|thumb|Matt Ryan was the Falcons first round pick in 2008 NFL Draft.]]

On February 22, prior the start of the [[NFL Combine]], the Falcons won a coin toss that gave them the 3rd overall pick in the [[2008 NFL Draft]] in a gathering with the [[Oakland Raiders]] and the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] to break a three-way-tie. Each team finished 2007 with a 4-12 record.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/02/2129/Falcons_learn_draft_position_through_coin_toss.aspx Falcons win coin toss, will pick third in Draft]&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts said that the Falcons should have used this selection to pick LSU Defensive Tackle [[Glenn Dorsey]], but the Falcons used their 1st round pick to draft [[Boston College]] quarterback [[Matt Ryan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=ufCwBzskI0I Matt Ryan Draft Preview Feature]&lt;/ref&gt; The Falcons also traded two of their second-round picks (No. 34 and No. 48) and a fourth round pick (No. 103) with [[Washington Redskins]] to move to No. 21 overall and select USC tackle [[Sam Baker (offensive tackle)|Sam Baker]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=WP7lXHx7N1I Sam Baker Highlights]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/04/NFL_Draft/Draftday_trade_opens_door_for_Baker_selection.aspx Draft-day trade opens door for Baker selection]&lt;/ref&gt;

==2008 schedule==
===Minicamp===
The Falcons opened the first mini camp of 2008 on Monday, April 14. The team had multiple &quot;mini camp&quot; sessions under new Head Coach Mike Smith before the start of training camp in late July. The team worked for three days before the NFL Draft and came back to Flowery Branch for another workout May 10â12.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/04/1120/Energy_key_at_Falcons_first_mini_camp_practice.aspx Energy key at Falcons first mini camp practice]&lt;/ref&gt; During the minicamp, the Falcons signed tender offers to punter [[Michael Koenen]] and defensive end [[Chauncey Davis]].

===Training camp===
For the fourth consecutive year, the Falcons held Russell Falcons Training Camp at the teamâs Flowery Branch headquarters.  Atlantaâs 43rd training camp was held from July 25-August 15, with select morning and afternoon practices open to the public. The Falcons held 30 practices, which included 13 two-a-day sessions. Atlanta traveled to Jacksonville on August 9 for its first preseason contest followed by two home preseason games against Indianapolis the day after training camp breaks (August 16) and [[Tennessee Titans]] on August 22 . The Falcons concluded the 2008 preseason schedule with a meeting against the Baltimore Ravens on August 28 at [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]] . In 2007, Russell Athletic and the Atlanta Falcons announced an agreement that includes title sponsorship of the teamâs three-week preseason training camp at its in-season training facility in Flowery Branch, Ga. The four-year agreement designates Russell Athletic as an official sponsor of the Falcons.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/07/22-31/First-year_players_energetic_on_first_day_of_camp.aspx First-year players energetic on first day of camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/07/22-31/Taylor_Falcons_ready_to_put_on_the_pads.aspx Taylor, Falcons ready to put on the pads]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/07/22-31/Coleman_patrolling_defensive_backfield_in_camp.aspx Coleman patrolling defensive backfield in camp]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Emmitt Thomas Inducted to the Hall Of Fame===
Falcons' Assistant Head Coach [[Emmitt Thomas]] was elected to the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame]] on February 2 during [[Super Bowl]] festivities in Phoenix. He was formally inducted into the Hall on August 2. Thomas was selected as a finalist for enshrinement by the Seniors Committee. He was selected to the Hall's Class of 2008 off a list of 17 players. He thus becomes the first Falcons player or coach to be placed in the Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/People/Alumni/Thomas_Hall_of_Fame_Induction.aspx Thomas Hall of Fame Induction]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Falcons began their 2008 campaign at home against the [[Detroit Lions]].  In the first quarter, Atlanta immediately took flight at rookie QB [[Matt Ryan]] throws his first career NFL pass to WR [[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]] for a 62-yard TD pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/Schedule/Games/Season_2008/Season/Game_1.aspx Falcons-Lions Gameday wrap]&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] (acquired from the Chargers) made an immediate impact as he got a 66-yard TD run and a 5-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Lions would respond with RB [[Kevin Smith (running back)|Kevin Smith]] getting a 5-yard TD run, while QB [[Jon Kitna]] completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR [[Roy Williams (wide receiver)|Roy Williams]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/09/Week_1/Falcons_Lions_Game_Story.aspx Turner leads Falcons to the victory against Detroit]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the third quarter, the Falcons went back to work as kicker [[Jason Elam]] got a 50-yard field goal, while RB [[Jerious Norwood]] got a 10-yard TD run.  Detroit would try to rally as Kitna completed a 1-yard TD pass to TE [[Casey FitzSimmons]].  Fortunately, Atlanta closed out their rout in the fourth quarter with Elam nailing a 25-yard field goal.

With the impressive win, the Falcons began their season at 1-0.

QB Matt Ryan would have a good rookie debut completing 9 of 13 passes for 161 yards and a touchdown.  RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] had an outstanding Falcon debut, setting a single-game franchise record with 220 rushing yards. Ryan, who became the first rookie to start a season for the Falcons since [[Steve Bartkowski]] in 1975, finished with a solid 161 passing yards and 137.0 quarterback rating. Turner led a ground game that picked up a franchise-record 318 rushing yards 7.6 yards per carry.
Game Notes.

*With a 34-21 victory, Mike Smith earned his first win as a Head Coach in the NFL
*Following a 44-41 victory over the [[Seattle Seahawks]]  in the 2007 season finale, the Falcons opened the 2008 campaign with 34 points en route to a victory, posting back-to-back games with over 30 points.
*The win over Detroit gave the Falcons their first season opening win since 2006 (20-6 vs. Carolina), their first season opening win at the Georgia Dome since 2005 (vs. Philadelphia, 14-10) and their first win against the Lions at home since 2002 (36-15).
*By opening the game as a starter, LB [[Keith Brooking]]  extended his consecutive games starting streak to 113 games, dating back to 2000, which moves him past long-time C [[Jeff Van Note]] into second place all-time in Falcons history. Former T [[Bob Whitfield]] holds the record with 123 consecutive starts (from Wk 1, 1993 â Wk 11, 2000).
*Center [[Todd McClure]]  also extended his consecutive games starting streak to 97-straight games to move past DE [[Patrick Kerney]]  and WR [[Terance Mathis]]  into fifth place all-time in that category.
* The Falcons had 10 players earn opening day starts for the first time in their NFL careers. The players lining up as starters for the first time today included: QB [[Matt Ryan]], LT [[Sam Baker (offensive tackle)|Sam Baker]], RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]], TE [[Ben Hartsock]], RG [[Harvey Dahl]], RT [[Tyson Clabo]], DT [[Jonathan Babineaux]], MLB [[Curtis Lofton]], CB [[Brent Grimes]] and CB [[Chris Houston (American football)|Chris Houston]].
*[[Curtis Lofton]]  became the first rookie to man the middle of the Falcons defense on opening day since linebacker [[Buddy Curry]]  in 1980. Ironically, it was exactly 28 years ago to this date, September 7, 1980, that Curry (the teamâs second round draft pick) started in the middle of the Falcons defense (at Minnesota, 8 tackles, 0.5 sack).

*The Falcons broke a team rushing record with 318 yards and 7.4 avg. against Detroit. The previous record was set on September 17, 2006 against Tampa Bay with 306 yards. Atlantaâs 318 yards marked the first game Atlanta totaled over 200 rushing yards since December 3, 2006 against Washington getting 256 yards.

*On Atlantaâs first offensive possession of the 2008 season, the Falcons recorded a three-play 74-yard drive that was capped off by WR [[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]] 62-yard touchdown reception from rookie QB Matt Ryan, his first career NFL pass.
*[[Matt Ryan]] became the first quarterback to throw a touchdown on his first career NFL pass since October 8, 2000 when [[Michael Bishop (football player)|Michael Bishop]] completed the feat as member of the [[New England Patriots]].
*[[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]] 62-yard touchdown reception was the longest of his career and the longest touchdown pass recorded by the Falcons since December 23, 2007 when [[Chris Redman]]  completed a 74-touchdown against Arizona.
*Atlantaâs 62-yard touchdown to WR [[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]] on the first offensive possession of the game was the longest touchdown pass for the Falcons on opening day since September 3, 2000, when [[Chris Chandler]] completed a 48-yard touchdown in a 36-28 win.
*The last time the Falcons scored a touchdown on their opening offensive possession of a game came against the [[Carolina Panthers]]  on November 11, 2007. Atlanta won the game 20-13.
*On Atlantaâs second possession of the game, RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] rushed for a 66-yard touchdown to give the Falcons a 14-0 lead. The 66-yard scamper is the fourth-longest rush in Turnerâs career and the seventh-longest rush in Falcons history.
*Michael Turnerâs 117 rushing yards in the first quarter are the most in an opening quarter of a game for the Falcons in at least two decades.
*Atlantaâs 216 yards of total offense in the first quarter is also the highest total in over two decades. The previous high for the Falcons came on October 13, 1991 with 172 yards against San Francisco.
*[[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] ran for 220 yards in his debut with the Falcons. This marks the highest single-game rushing record for the Falcons, formerly held by [[Gerald Riggs]], who set the previous record of 202 rushing yards on September 2, 1984.
The Lions would eventually finish the season 0-16

Following their outstanding home win over the Lions, the Falcons flew to [[Raymond James Stadium]] for a Week 2 NFC South duel with the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/Schedule/Games/Season_2008/Season/Game_2.aspx Falcons-Bucs Gameday wrap]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed as Bucs QB [[Brian Griese]] completed a 5-yard TD pass to TE [[John Gilmore (American football)|John Gilmore]].  In the second quarter, the Falcons continued to trail as former Falcons RB [[Warrick Dunn]] gave Tampa Bay a 17-yard TD run, along with kicker [[Matt Bryant]] getting a 33-yard field goal.  Atlanta would close out the half with kicker [[Jason Elam]] getting a 32-yard field goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/09/Week_2/Falcons_Bucs_Game_Story.aspx Birds stumble against NFC South rival]&lt;/ref&gt;
In the third quarter, the Falcons crept closer as Elam kicked a 27-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta tried to rally as Elam nailed a 24-yard field goal.  However, the Buccaneers pulled away as RB [[Earnest Graham]] got a 68-yard TD run.
With the loss, the Falcons fell to 1-1. With [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] running for a franchise-record 220 yards in his Falcons debut, Ryan only threw the ball 13 times against Detroit. Sunday, he had more attempts than that in the first half alone. The Bucs limited Turner to 42 yards on 14 carries. WR [[Joey Galloway]], who did not play in the preseason because of a sore groin, sprained an ankle in the fourth quarter. Falcons rookie LT [[Sam Baker (offensive tackle)|Sam Baker]] was hit in the head in the first half and did not return. A week after beating Detroit in his pro debut, [[Matt Ryan]] threw incompletions on his first nine passes before settling down to keep Atlanta in the game with three field goal drives that trimmed a 17-point deficit to eight with five minutes to go.

*The Falcons defense allowed Tampa Bay to rush for only two yards in the first quarter on six attempts. The Buccaneers two yards is the lowest total for a Falcons opponent in the first quarter of a game since December 14, 2003 when the [[Indianapolis Colts]]  posted two rushing yards on seven carries. At the end of the first half, Tampaâs rushing total was 36 yards, the lowest total for a Falcons opponent in the first half of play since December 31, 2006 when Philadelphia only managed 34 yards in the first two quarters.
*Matt Ryan led the Falcons on a 13-play, 75-yard scoring drive in the third quarter, which was capped by a Jason Elam 27-yard field goal. Ryan completed six of seven passes on the drive for 62 yards.
*On his second career carry, wide receiver [[Harry Douglas]] took an end-around and rushed for 33 yards to give the Falcons their third first down of the game. The 33-yard scamper is the second longest rush for Atlanta in two games this season.
*With two minutes remaining in the second quarter, wide receiver/punt returner [[Adam Jennings (American football)|Adam Jennings]] set a career-high with a 37-yard punt return topping his old mark of 23 yards set in 2007. The return was also the longest for the Falcons since Allen Rossum returned a punt 37 yards against Cleveland on November 12, 2006. Jenningsâ punt return led to a Falcons 32-yard field goal by Elam, the first points of the game for Atlanta.
*Elam notched three field goals of 32, 27 and 25 yards to extend his streak of splitting the uprights to 20 consecutive kicks.
*Atlanta defensive tackle [[Jonathan Babineaux]] dropped Buccaneers quarterback [[Brian Griese]] in the third quarter for his 5.5th career sack. The sack led to a Tampa Bay punt on its first offensive possession of the second half. Three of Babineauxâs 5.5 career sacks have come in the first two games of a season (2.0 in 2007, 1.0 in 2008).
*Falcons defensive end [[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] posted his fourth sack of the season and his sixth in three consecutive games when he dropped Griese in the fourth quarter to stall a Buccaneers drive in the red zone. On the sack, Abraham forced a fumble which was recovered by defensive tackle [[Jason Jefferson]]. The sack was Abrahamâs 14th in the last 17 games and the 71.5th of his career. The fumble recovery by Jefferson was the first of his career.
*Following Abraham's fourth quarter sack, the Falcons have now recorded three consecutive games with at least two sacks dating back to the 2007 season finale against the  [[Seattle Seahawks]].
*Head Coach Mike Smith is one for one in challenges after challenging the spot of the ball on a [[Roddy White]] reception in the third quarter. After the review the officials determined White had reached the first down marker, which kept the Atlanta drive alive.

[[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] ran for three touchdowns and the [[Atlanta Falcons]] scored the first 24 points to beat Kansas City 38-14, giving the Chiefs their 12th straight loss.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/Schedule/Games/Season_2008/Season/Game_3.aspx Falcons-Chiefs Gameday wrap]&lt;/ref&gt;

Turner had scoring runs of 4, 1 and 2 yards, his first career game with three rushing touchdowns, while leading the Falcons with 104 yards rushing. [[Jerious Norwood]] added 75 yards rushing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/09/Week_3/Falcons_Chiefs_Game_Story.aspx Falcons-Chiefs Game recap]&lt;/ref&gt;
Turner dragged Chiefs linebacker [[Pat Thomas (linebacker)|Pat Thomas]] for a few steps before breaking free and running through other defenders for a 38-yard run from the Falcons 8. A 30-yard pass from Ryan to Norwood helped set up Turner first touchdown run. Turner 1-yard scoring run in the second quarter gave Atlanta a 24-0 lead. Turner determined run helped to soften the Kansas City defense. Ryan found [[Roddy White]] for a 70-yard touchdown pass on Atlanta's next possession, and the Falcons were on their way to a big early lead, ( Ryan 70-yard touchdown pass to White is the longest pass completion for the Falcons since 12/23/07 when wide receiver [[Laurent Robinson]] caught a 74-yard touchdown pass from quarterback [[Chris Redman]] against the [[Arizona Cardinals]] in a Week 16 meeting) .

On Kansas City first offensive possession of the game, defensive end [[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] logged his fifth sack of the season, which led to a Chiefs punt. Abraham tallied his second sack of the game at the end of the third quarter, which included a forced fumble. The two sacks gave Abraham eight in his last four games, 16 in his last 18 games and 73.5 for his career. Entering the Kansas City game, he led the NFL with four sacks after three games, the forced fumble was the 29th of his career, which ranks fourth in the NFL from 2000-2008. Turner sparked an Atlanta scoring drive when he posted a 38-yard rush in the first quarter, he capped the drive with a four-yard touchdown, his third of the season. The Falcons drove 92 yards in six plays and also received help from running back [[Jerious Norwood]] on the drive who contributed with 45 combined yards (two rushes for 15 yards and one 30-yard reception).
Atlanta  92-yard scoring drive, the first of the game, is the longest scoring drive since 12/3/06 at Washington when the Falcons drove 98 yards on six plays capped by a Norwood touchdown run.  [[Placekicker|Kicker]] [[Jason Elam]] was successful on his long field goal attempt of 27 yards against Kansas City, improving his streak of consecutive field goals to 27. Elam also added five extra points for an eight-point day.

[[Tyler Thigpen]], the third starting quarterback in three weeks for Kansas City, threw three interceptions in his first career start. The third interception, by cornerback [[Chris Houston (American football)|Chris Houston]], was returned 10 yards for a touchdown with 1:01 left in the game.

Chiefs coach [[Herman Edwards]] said during the week he would turn to veteran [[Damon Huard]] if Thigpen struggled. Thigpen played the full game and was 14-for-36 passing for 128 yards with one touchdown. Down 24-0, Thigpen led a 13-play scoring drive capped by his 15-yard touchdown pass to [[Dwayne Bowe]]  with three seconds left in the first half.

The Chiefs' 12th straight loss came 11 months to the day after their last win. They lost their last nine games in 2007 after a 12-10 win at Oakland on Oct. 21, 2007. The Chiefs comeback continued when [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson's]] 48-yard run set up his 1-yard scoring plunge to open the second half, cutting Atlanta lead to 24-14. It was Johnson first rushing touchdown of the season.Johnson, who had 96 yards rushing in his first two games, had 24 carries for 121 yards and a touchdown. Johnson has 4,981 yards rushing for his career to pass  [[Christian Okoye]] (4,897) for second place on the Chiefs all-time list.

The Falcons had a quick answer to Johnson touchdown. Ryan, making his third start, had a 15-yard run and a 17-yard pass to White to set up Turner third touchdown, a 2-yard run. The Chiefs were forced to punt on their first five possessions. Their next two drives ended with interceptions by  [[Erik Coleman]] and  [[Brent Grimes]], Coleman intercepted his first career pass in a Falcons uniform, which also gave him the eighth of his career, it was Coleman first interception since 11/12/06 against the [[New England Patriots]] . Coleman pieced together a stellar performance against the Chiefs which included 10 tackles to lead the team and one forced fumble, and Grimes  intercepted his first career pass when he stepped in front of a Tyler Thigpen pass in the second quarter. Grimes returned the interception 25 yards, which led to a Falcons touchdown. The Falcons defense allowed only 14 rushing yards in the first quarter against the Kansas City Chiefs, continuing their trend of holding opponents to under 15 rushing yards over the first three contests of the season. Against Tampa Bay in Week 2, Atlanta held the Bucs to two rushing yards in the opening 15 minutes of play, which was the lowest total in the first quarter of a game since for a Falcons opponent since 12/14/03 (vs. Colts, two rushing yards). Below is a look at Atlanta  opponent rushing totals in the first quarter of each game this season.

The Falcons moved to 2-0 at the [[Georgia Dome]] on the season and gave Head Coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] his second career win as a head coach.

[[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] became only the fifth Falcons running back in team history to register three or more touchdowns in a game, with the win over the Chiefs improved its record to 5-1 in its last six meetings against AFC West opponents.

Coming off their home win over the Chiefs, the Falcons flew to [[Bank of America Stadium]] for a Week 4 NFC South duel with the [[Carolina Panthers]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/09/Week_4/Falcons_Panthers_Game_Story.aspx  Birds &quot;drop&quot; division game at Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Falcons found a way to stick around for three quarters in Sunday game at [[Bank of America Stadium]]  but injuries, dropped passes and untimely penalties filled the afternoon. Atlanta lost starting strong safety [[Lawyer Milloy]] in the first half after he took a shot to the ribs and played the entire game without starting left tackle [[Sam Baker (offensive tackle)|Sam Baker]].  In the first quarter, Atlanta trailed early as Panthers RB [[Jonathan Stewart]] getting an 8-yard TD run.  The Falcons responded with kicker [[Jason Elam]] getting a 33-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Falcons crept closer as Elam kicked a 44-yard field goal.
However, Carolina answered with QB [[Jake Delhomme]] completing a 56-yard TD pass to WR [[Steve Smith (Carolina Panthers)|Steve Smith]].  Atlanta closed out the half with Elam getting a 44-yard field goal. The Panthers (3-1, 1-0) lost starting offensive tackles [[Jordan Gross]] and [[Jeff Otah]] in the game to injury and also went several series without starting cornerback [[Ken Lucas (American football)|Ken Lucas]]. But that didn't stop the [[NFC South]] leaders from imposing their will on both sides of the ball and put up more than 400 yards of total offense. For the fourth consecutive game this season, the Falcons defense held their opponent to 16 rushing yards or less in the first quarter of play after the Panthers managed only 16 yards on six carries. [[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] blocked his first career punt in the second quarter, which led to Elam second field goal of the day. The blocked punt was the first for Atlanta since the 2004 season finale when [[Demorrio Williams]] blocked Seattle first kick of the game at  [[Qwest Field]].  [[Running back]] [[Jerious Norwood]]  posted his second longest rush of the season with a 40-yard scamper in the second quarter. The rush was four yards shy of his season high (44), which he set against Kansas City in Week 3.
Norwood has now posted five rushes of 40 yards or more in this three-year career, punter [[Michael Koenen]] booted his longest punt of the season with a 60-yard kick in the second quarter. The punt is the longest for Koenen since December 16, 2007  when he nailed a 63-yard punt against the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], running back [[Jason Snelling]] earned his first career start while [[tight end]] [[Justin Peelle]] started his first game in a Falcons uniform. [[Brian Finneran]] caught his first pass of the 2008 campaign on a five-yard reception in the second quarter. The catch was the first for Finneran since the 2005 season finale when he caught four passes for 45 yards against the [[Carolina Panthers]]. Roddy White led the Falcons in receiving with seven catches for 90 yards. He continues to remain on pace for a 1,000-yard season.  In his fourth career start, rookie quarterback [[Matt Ryan]] completed passes to eight different receivers, a season-high for the [[Boston College]] graduate, Ryan finished the game having completed 21 of 41 passes for 158 yards and a 60.8 passer rating

In the third quarter, the Panthers increased their lead with kicker [[John Kasay]] nailing a 44-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, Carolina sealed the win with Delhomme completing a 36-yard TD pass to WR [[Muhsin Muhammad]]. The first-year head coach [[Mike Smith (American football coach)|Mike Smith]] made a concise list in explaining the problems that plagued his offense in Charlotte.

*Third down conversions (the Falcons were 2-of-13)

*Red zone penalties (two knocked the Birds outside the 10)

*six dropped passes(three on third down)

With the loss, the Falcons fell to 2-2.

The catch was his sixth of the day giving White 115 yards in the first half at that point.White contributed with 67 first quarter receiving yards, falling three yards short of his career-high in the first 15 minutes of play (70), which he set on September 21, 2008 against Kansas City. White also finished the first half with 132 yards, which is the most in two quarters of play for the four-year veteran in his career and the second highest total since [[Terance Mathis]] posted 136 on November 19, 1995.
On Atlanta first play of the game, Quarterback Matt Ryan completed a 37-yard pass to White crossing into Packers territory. Ryan completed two more receptions to White on the drive for a total of 64 yards,the three completions led to an Atlanta touchdown, which marked the second occasion this season the Falcons scored on their first drive of the game (Week 1 vs. Detroit) and the first time they scored on their first possession of the game on the road, Ryan started the game having completed six of six passes for 72 yards and one touchdown pass, also compiled the best half of football in his rookie career thus far when he completed 13 of 18 passes for 154 yards, two touchdowns and no interceptions for a 135.0 passer rating. Ryan finished the game with a season-high 194 passing yards.  The Falcons posted a touchdown on their first offensive possession of the game when Ryan led the team 81 yards on 10 plays and completed a one-yard touchdown strike to tight end Justin Peelle, his first as an Atlanta Falcon and the eighth of his career. Center [[Ben Wilkerson]] saw his first action of the season at the center position when he briefly replaced [[Todd McClure]] on Atlanta first offensive drive of the game. Wilkerson was at center when the Falcons scored their first touchdown in the first quarter.  Defensive tackle [[Grady Jackson]] logged his first sack of the season and the 34.5th of his career when he dropped Packers quarterback [[Aaron Rodgers]] on Green Bay first offensive play of the game, the sack led to a Green Bay punt. Following the first quarter of play the Falcons recorded eight first downs opposed to the Packers who finished the opening 15 minutes of play with zero. Atlanta also racked-up 147 net yards to Green Bayâs 10 in the quarter.

At the 6:02 mark in the second quarter, Ryan tallied his second touchdown pass of the day when he found White in the end zone for a 22-yard strike to give the Falcons a 17-7 advantage. The catch was his sixth of the day giving White 115 yards in the first half at that point.	White pieced together his second 100-yard receiving game of the season and the ninth of his career after catching eight passes for 132 yards and one touchdown. Following the two-minute mark in the second quarter, defensive end [[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] notched his seventh sack of the season, dropping Rodgers. The sack is the ninth in his last six games, the 17th in his last 20 contests and the 74.5th of his career. The sack forced a Packers field goal attempt and following an offensive holding call on a converted attempt, Green Bay missed a re-kick.

In the third quarter, Green Bay answered with kicker [[Mason Crosby]] getting a 50-yard field goal. In the fourth quarter, the Packers tied the game with Rodgers completing a 25-yard TD pass to WR [[Greg Jennings]], [[Michael Boley]] intercepted his first pass of the season and the fifth of his career when he stepped in from of an Aaron Rodgers pass late in the fourth quarter. The INT led to the game-sealing touchdown by Turner, yet Atlanta replied with Elam nailing a 41-yard field goal and RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] getting a 2-yard TD run.	Fullback [[Ovie Mughelli]] carried the ball nine yards on his first rush of the season in the fourth quarter.  Following a Packers touchdown to tie the game at 17, running back/kick returner [[Jerious Norwood]] returned the ensuing kickoff 54 yards into Green Bay territory, marking the second-longest kickoff return of his career, Norwood return set up a Falcons game-sealing touchdown.  Green Bay tried to rally as Rodgers completed a 4-yard TD pass to TE [[Donald Lee (American football)|Donald Lee]], yet the Falcons' defense stiffened for the win.

With the win, Atlanta improved to 3-2.

*An Atlanta 27-24 victory gave the Falcons their first win on the road this season and their first victory at [[Lambeau Field]] since the [[NFL playoffs, 2002â03#NFC: Atlanta Falcons 27, Green Bay Packers 7|2002 NFC Wild Card playoff]].

Coming off their road win over the Packers, the Falcons went home for a Week 6 duel with the [[Chicago Bears]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/Schedule/Games/Season_2008/Season/Game_6.aspx Falcons-Bears Gameday wrap]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the first quarter, Atlanta took flight as kicker [[Jason Elam]] got a 29-yard and a 48-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Falcons increased their lead as Elam kicked a 32-yard field goal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/10/Week_6/Falcons_Bears_Game_Story.aspx Last-second field goal gives Falcons victory]&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bears would respond with kicker [[Robbie Gould]] getting a 36-yard field goal.
Entering Sunday game with the Bears, the Falcons led the NFL in first quarter scoring with 48 points. After posting two field goals for a 6-0 lead following the first 15 minutes of play against Chicago, Atlanta has now outscored its opponent in the first quarter by a 54-14 margin.

A chance at a touchdown came with 9:16 remaining in the first half after a curious turn of events near the goal line. A third-down run by [[Jerious Norwood]] came up short and ended with a fumble. Bears defensive tackle [[Tommie Harris]] recovered but lost the ball before he was touched down. [[Jason Snelling]] recovered the ball for the Falcons, who got a fresh set of downs. Following the first half of play, the Falcons defense held the Bears to 20 first half rushing yards. The 20 yards are the fewest given up in the first half of a game by Atlantaâs defense since October 1, 2006 against Arizona (two yards).

In the third quarter, the Falcons continued to add on to their lead as Elam got a 41-yard field goal, yet Chicago answered with RB [[Matt FortÃ©]] getting a 3-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta replied with rookie QB [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] completing a 3-yard TD pass to WR [[Roddy White]]. Defensive end  [[Jamaal Anderson]] paced a defense that fed off the crowd's energy. He finished with four tackles (two for loss) and the first sack of his two-year career. Anderson also had two pass deflections on the Bears' first drive of the second quarter.
The Falcons offense started the second half with a no-huddle offense and added another Elam field goal to take a 12-3 lead. Chicago stuck with the running game and added a touchdown from Forte with 2:24 remaining in the third quarter. Chicago drove within inches of the end zone, but [[Matt Forte]] was stuffed on fourth down as he attempted to leap across the line. [[Michael Boley]] came in low to trip up the runner, then [[Lawyer Milloy]] and [[Keith Brooking]] finished him off.
The Bears took the lead with Gould getting a 32-yard field goal, along with QB [[Kyle Orton]] completing a 17-yard TD pass to WR [[Rashied Davis]].  Fortunately, the Falcons got the last laugh as Elam nailed the game-winning 48-yard field goal.The 16-year veteran's celebration was interrupted by a swarm of teammates near midfield. It was his fifth successful kick of the day but just moments before he missed a kick that could have iced the game. Chicago came off the miscue with a 77-yard touchdown drive to take a 20-19 lead with 11 seconds to play. But a 9-yard return off a short kickoff by [[Harry Douglas]] and a 26-yard strike from rookie quarterback [[Matt Ryan]] to [[Michael Jenkins (American football)|Michael Jenkins]] set Elam up for the game-winner with 1 second left.

&quot;I'm really happy that one went through,&quot; Elam said. &quot;Our guys have been fighting so hard for so long. I hate to even mention what happened last year but to hear some of the stories I know the guys are really hungry to get some wins on the board and show our fans what we're all about.&quot; With time to throw Ryan thrived. The rookie found five different receivers and performed regular Houdini-like acts to find open players down the field for third-down conversions. Fellow rookie Douglas caught five passes for 96 yards including a 47-yard strike on third down that set up a 3-yard scoring toss to White with 13:25 remaining.
Ryan opened the game 8-of-8 for 107 yards and captained nearly identical scoring drives in the first quarter, leading the team on 48- and 49-yard marches that ended with field goals.
âI think everybody is excited with the win,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;I thought we played a very good Chicago Bears team today. They played an entire 60 minutes and we did the same thing. We just had the last punch. We were able to make a couple big plays at the end of the game with Elam clutch kick being the biggest one. This win is a great story heading into the bye week.â
Bears CB [[Nathan Vasher]] (wrist) missed his second straight game, and the other starting corner, [[Charles Tillman]], went out in the first half with a shoulder injury. Backup FS [[Danieal Manning]] left, too, with an injured hamstring., White went over 100 yards receiving for the second week in a row, Forte led the Bears with 76 yards rushing.

With the win, Atlanta entered their bye week at 4-2.

Not only did Matt Ryan (22/30 for 301 yards and a touchdown) pick up his first-ever 300-yard day, but he acquired the best record for a rookie quarterback in his first six games as a starter since 1998 (4-2), besting Kyle Orton in '05 and [[Kyle Boller]] in '03 (both with 3-3).

Coming off their bye week, the Falcons flew to [[Lincoln Financial Field]] for a Week 8 duel with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/Schedule/Games/Season_2008/Season/Game_7.aspx  Falcons-Eagles Gameday wrap]&lt;/ref&gt; as rookie QB [[Matt Ryan]] (a native of the Philly suburb of [[Exton, Pennsylvania]]) took on his hometown team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/10/Week_8/Falcons_Eagles_Game_Story.aspx  First-half flashes fade in road loss]&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan threw for 277 yards in his seventh career start but also had a pair of interceptions. The defense held the Eagles after the first turnover but Ryan's second mistake came in the end zone, eliminating a red-zone scoring chance.

After a scoreless first quarter, Atlanta finally took flight in the second quarter as Ryan completed a 55-yard TD pass to WR [[Roddy White]] with 8:56 remaining in the first half when he threaded a pass between two Eagles defenders . White scampered toward the end zone for a 55-yard score and a 7-0 lead.âWe had worked on that fade pass all week in practice and Matt threw it up there and really I should have batted the ball down,&quot; said White, who had 113 receiving yards. &quot;I think on that play, I had the responsibility to help him out. We thought we were going to put some points on the board and we let it get away from us. I put that play on myself, because I really should have knocked that down.â White tallied his third consecutive 100-yard game after catching eight passes for 113 yards and two touchdowns. White has now posted four 100-yard games this season and 11 for his career, the 55-yard strike is the third longest pass for the rookie quarterback this season. The second score came on an eight-yard pass in the fourth quarter, Ryan returned to the sight of first collegiate touchdown pass at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] against the [[Temple Owls]] on November 20, 2004 .

But Philadelphia responded with 20 unanswered points, including scoring drives of 60, 70 and 69 yards. Twice McNabb scrambled for key first downs. The Falcons did not record a sack in the second half. The Falcons run game sputtered and suffered from untimely penalties. Starting left tackle [[Sam Baker (offensive tackle)|Sam Baker]] missed the game with a hip injury and was replaced by [[Todd Weiner]]. Weiner would leave with an injury and was replaced by [[Quinn Ojinnaka]]. [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] rushed for 58 yards on 17 carries. The Eagles took the lead with QB [[Donovan McNabb]] getting a 3-yard TD run, along with kicker [[David Akers]] getting a 36-yard field goal. McNabb turned from prolific passer to game-manager as the afternoon progressed, finding openings in the Falcons zone defense for short to medium gains and handing the ball off to Westbrook, the All-Pro rushed for 63 yards on 10 carries in the first half and finished with 22 carries for 167 yards. He also had six catches for 42 yards, one of six Eagles receivers with two or more catches. The Falcons spent much of the first half keeping McNabb and the Eagles high-flying offense on the ground. Atlanta didn't allow a first-quarter point for the fifth time this season and picked up two sacks, a forced fumble and a turnover in the first 30 minutes  In the third quarter, the Falcons continued to trail as RB [[Brian Westbrook]] got a 16-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Philadelphia increased its lead with Akers nailing an 18-yard field goal.[[Brian Finneran]] tied his season-high in receptions (three) and contributed with two catches on third down to convert a new set a downs for the Falcons on both occasions in the first half. [[Jerious Norwood]] posted his second-highest receiving total when he caught five passes for 55 yards, he set his career-high of 57 yards against the Saints last season Atlanta tried to rally as Ryan hooked up with White again on an 8-yard TD pass, but the Eagles flew away as Westbrook got a 39-yard TD run. A late goal-line stand held the Eagles to a field goal and kept it a two-possession game with 7:57 remaining. Ryan led a no-huddle offense into the red zone on the next series and found White with a second touchdown with less than four minutes to play. Trailing 20-14, the Falcons defense stepped up with a key three-and-out but an odd turn of events kept the Birds offense from getting a shot at the win. Return man [[Adam Jennings (American football)|Adam Jennings]] decided at the last second not to field the punt after the Eagles' three-and-out drive. Officials ruled Jennings touched the ball and the muffed punt was recovered by the Eagles. The Falcons did not have a timeout left and, by rule, could not challenge the play. Replays in the press box showed Jennings did not touch the ball. Three plays later Westbrook rushed over the left side for a 39-yard, game-clinching  touchdown. Defensive end [[Jamaal Anderson]] posted his second sack of the season when he dropped Eagles quarterback [[Donovan McNabb]] for a six-yard loss in the first quarter, the sack stalled an Eagles drive, forcing a punt. Anderson has now totaled one sack in two consecutive games. Rookie [[Curtis Lofton]] earned his first career sack when he dropped McNabb for an eight-yard loss in the second quarter while forcing a fumble. The ball was recovered by defensive end [[Chauncey Davis]].
&quot;It never felt like we were out of the game, even when we didnât get that touchdown when we needed it, it still felt like we stopped them to get a chance to put some more points on the board and thatâs what we did,&quot; defensive end [[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] said. &quot;Like I said, itâs part of the game and everybody played well, it was a tough fought game. I think everybody got a lot of bumps and bruises from the game, but it definitely was a good game.â
With the loss, the Falcons fell to 4-3.

[[File:Falcons vs panthers.jpg|thumb|Falcons offense against the Panthers in Georgia Dome]]
Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Broncos, the Falcons stayed at home, donned their alternate uniforms, and played a Week 12 NFC South rematch with the [[Carolina Panthers]].  In the first quarter, Atlanta took flight as kicker [[Jason Elam]] got a 23-yard field goal, while rookie WR [[Harry Douglas]] got a 7-yard TD run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/Schedule/Games/Season_2008/Season/Game_11.aspx  Falcons-Panthers Gameday wrap]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second quarter, the Falcons increased their lead as RB [[Michael Turner (American football)|Michael Turner]] got a 1-yard TD run.  The Panthers closed out the half as kicker [[John Kasay]] got a 23-yard field goal. On his third carry of the game, Turner rushed for a six-yard gain and eclipsed the 1,000-yard rushing plateau this season. He became the first Falcons running back to reach 1,000 yards in a campaign since 2006 when [[Warrick Dunn]] had 1,140 and the 20th running back in franchise history to reach 1,000 yards in a season. Turner's career day continued after he tied a team record with four rushing touchdowns of [[T.J. Duckett]] posted on December 12, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://es.youtube.com/watch?v=Pu2Vbl99zvs Atlanta vs carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the second career three-score game and the fourth multiple-touchdown game of his career. Turner first found the end zone on a one-yard rush in the second quarter, scored for the second occasion on a four-yard run in the fourth quarter, logged his third TD on a one-yard run with 7:13 remaining and tallied his last on a 16-yard scamper in the fourth quarter to seal a Falcons 45â28 victory. With four scores, Turner became the third player in Falcons history to post 13 or more rushing touchdowns in a season. Turner finished the game with 24 carries for 117 yards and four touchdowns, which marked his eighth career 100-yard game. He currently{{When|date=April 2011}} has rushed for 1,088 yards this season and is on a pace for 1,583 yards, which would rank third in a season in Falcons annals; following the first half of play, Turner tallied 12 carries for 56 yards. This season, when the fifth-year running back rushes for 50 yards or more in the first half, the Falcons are 5â0. [[Matt Ryan]] and the offense faced a quick third down on the next possession, but the quarterback found rookie wide receiver [[Harry Douglas]] on a 69-yard pass play to the Panthers 6. Four plays later Turner got his key, fourth-down touchdown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atlantafalcons.com/News/Articles/2008/11/Week_12/Falcons_Panthers_Game_Story.aspx  Birds use big plays to get win over Panthers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Panthers faced an energized defense and a raucous crowd on the next possession. [[Chauncey Davis]] recorded his second sack of the day and back-to-back false start penalties backed Carolina into the shadow of its own goal line. The Panthers punted from the end zone, giving Douglas a chance for a big return. The rookie brought the kick back up the middle 61 yards for a touchdown. Delhomme found [[Muhsin Muhammad]] for a touchdown on the next series but the Falcons had already done plenty of damage. Still, Turner found the end zone for a final time with just 54 seconds to play. [[Eric Weems]] caught his first career pass in the first quarter for a four-yard gain. The reception led to a Falcons touchdown. Douglas scored his first two career touchdowns; he first found the end zone on a seven-yard end around in the first quarter to give the Falcons a 10â0 lead; Douglas then became the 10th player in Falcons history to return a punt for a touchdown and the first since 2004 when [[Allen Rossum]] returned a kick 61 yards in the fourth quarter. Douglas's return was the longest in his career, topping the previous mark of 33 yards against New Orleans in Week 10; along with a 61-yard punt return, Douglas totaled career-highs in offensive touches with six (two rushing, four receiving and all purpose yards 188, which included 3 rushing, 92 receiving and 93 yards on punt returns), he also became the Falcons' third rookie this season to account for a touchdown; along with Douglas's run and punt return, quarterback Matt Ryan has thrown 11 touchdown passes and cornerback [[Chevis Jackson]] returned an interception 95 yards for a score against New Orleans in Week 10, Douglas posted a career-long reception with a 69-yard catch in the fourth quarter. He finished the game with 92 receiving yards, which led the team and fell four yards short of his career high ( 96 yards vs. Chicago, October 12 ). Roddy White caught Ryan first pass of the game for a 30-yard gain, marking the 11th reception of 20-plus yards, White finished the game with four receptions for 70 yards and is 27 yards shy of a 1,000-yard season. Atlanta outscored Carolina in the first quarter by a 10-0 margin, marking the seventh time this season a Falcons opponent was held scoreless in the opening 15 minutes of play. Atlanta has now{{When|date=April 2011}} outscored its opponents in the first quarter by a 88-24 mark and led the NFL in first quarter scoring entering Sunday's game. Following the first quarter of play, the Falcons offense posted 162 net yards of offense compared to zero by the Panthers . [[Brian Finneran]] caught one pass for nine yards on a third down in the second quarter, giving the Falcons a new set of downs. In his career, the nine-year veteran has caught 127 of 187 receptions that have gone for a first down or touchdown (67.9 percent).

[[John Abraham (American football)|John Abraham]] logged his 12th sack of the season and stalled a Carolina two-minute drive at the end of the second quarter; the sack is the 14th in his last 12 games, his 22nd in his last 26 contests and has now recorded 79.5 for his career. In his tenure with the Falcons, Abraham has posted 26 sacks in 34 games played. Abrahamâs 12 sacks through 11 games this season already ranks tied for the fifth most in a single season in Falcons history. Atlanta defense held Carolina to three-consecutive three and outs to start the game while allowing only eight net yards; entering Sundayâs game, the Falcons ranked fourth in the NFC and eighth in the NFL in opponent three and out drives. [[Jason Snelling]] caught a 27-yard pass in the first quarter and broke a tackle to take the ball into Carolina territory, the reception is a career-long for the second-year running back, topping his old mark of 18 yards, which he set earlier in the season at Philadelphia.

In the third quarter, Carolina began to claw their way back into the game as RB [[DeAngelo Williams]] got a 5-yard TD run, while Kasay nailed a 21-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, Atlanta answered with Turner getting a 4-yard TD run.  The Panthers would reply with QB [[Jake Delhomme]] getting a 12-yard TD run (along with Williams' 2-point conversion run), yet the Falcons struck right back with Turner getting a 1-yard TD run, while Douglas returned a punt 61-yard field goal.  Carolina tried to rally as Delhomme completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR [[Muhsin Muhammad]], yet Atlanta flew away as Turner got a 16-yard TD run. âIt was great to get off to a good start and score 17 points,&quot; said Ryan, who managed the game with 259 passing yards on a 94.5 passer rating. &quot;For the most part, we were able to maintain our ebb and flow on the offensive side of the ball. Our defense stepped up and did a heck of a job keeping Carolina from making big plays. I didnât think we would score 45 points, but Iâll take that any day.â

With the win, the Falcons improved to 7â4.
