The '''2012 Africa Cup of Nations''' will be the 28th edition of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]], the [[association football|football]] championship of Africa organized by the [[Confederation of African Football]] (CAF).  It will be co-hosted by [[Gabon]] and [[Equatorial Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Angola to host 2010 Nations Cup |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/football/africa/5314036.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=2006-09-04 |accessdate=2006-09-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070313192320/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/football/africa/5314036.stm  |archivedate = 2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The two countries won the right to host the tournament after defeating a [[Nigeria]]n bid along with two other bid winning nations, [[Angola]] and [[Libya]]. Bids from [[Mozambique]], [[Namibia]], [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Senegal]] were rejected.  For the first time in CAF history, the hosts of three successive tournaments were chosen at the same time; Angola was chosen to host in 2010, Gabon/Equatorial Guinea were chosen as hosts for the 2012 cup and Libya for the 2013 edition. Nigeria was chosen as a stand-by host in the event that one of the chosen nations were to become unsuitable.

==Bids shortlist==
Five countries were put on the shortlist to host the tournament including one joint bid.

==Qualification==
{{Main|2012 Africa Cup of Nations qualification}}
The qualification process involves ten groups of four, one of which was reduced to a group of three after the withdrawal of [[Mauritania national football team|Mauritania]], and one group of five. The top team from each group goes through, as well as the second placed team from the group of five. The two best second place teams also qualify. At the end of the qualification process, fourteen teams would have qualified, as well as the two host nations. The first qualifiers were held on 1 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arogeraldes.blogspot.com/2010/02/coupe-africaine-des-nations-2012.html |title= Full schedule of qualifiers matches for CAN 2012 |date=2010-02-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National team banishments==
===Togo===
[[Togo national football team|Togo]] were initially banned from the 2012 and [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations|2013]] Africa Cup of Nations tournaments by [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] after they withdrew from the [[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010]] tournament following a [[Togo national football team attack|deadly attack on their team bus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8450529.stm|title=Togo officially disqualified from Africa Cup of Nations|date=11 January 2010|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Togo appealed to the [[Court of Arbitration for Sport]], with [[FIFA]] president [[Sepp Blatter]] stepping in to mediate. The ban was subsequently lifted with immediate effect on 14 May 2010, after a meeting of the [[Confederation of African Football|CAF]] Executive Committee. [[Togo national football team|Togo]] are therefore free to play in the 2012 and [[2013 Africa Cup of Nations|2013]] qualifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/africa/8682511.stm|title=Togo's African Cup ban is lifted|date=14 May 2010|work=[[BBC Sport]]|publisher=[[BBC]]|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===

On June 30, after [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]'s exit from the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], Nigerian President [[Goodluck Jonathan]] punished the team for a poor campaign by imposing a 2-year ban from international competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703426004575338881245120688.html|title=Nigeria's President Suspends Soccer Team|date=30 June 2010|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|accessdate=8 July 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; This would have resulted in the Nigerians missing out on both the 2012 qualifying phase and the 2012 African Cup of Nations. However, on July 5, the Nigerian government dropped the ban after FIFA threatened to impose harsher international sanctions as a result of the government interference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/world-cup/story/_/id/5355645/ce/us/nigeria-president-goodluck-jonathan-dropping-plan-suspend-tea?cc=5901&amp;ver=us|title=Nigeria backs down on soccer ban|date=6 July 2010|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=[[ESPN]]|accessdate=8 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nigeria competed in qualifying for the 2012 Africa Cup of Nations as scheduled.

==Venues==
The opening match, one semi-final and the third place match will be held in Equatorial Guinea while the other semi-final and the final will be held in Gabon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gaboneco.com/show_article.php?IDActu=16437 |title=Gabon : Libreville et Malabo s'accordent pour la CAN 2012 |work=[[Gaboneco]] |language=French|trans_title=Gabon: Libreville and Malabo agree for the 2012 ACN |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Draw==
The draw for the final tournament took place on 29 October 2011 at the Sipopo Conference Palace in [[Malabo]], [[Equatorial Guinea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Official Draw for the Orange CAN 2012 fixed for October 29, 2011 |url=http://www.cafonline.com/competition/african-cup-of-nations_2012/news/10250-official-draw-for-the-orange-can-2012-fixed-for-october-29-2011.html |work=cafonline.com |publisher=[[Confederation of African Football]] |date=26 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The draw ceremony was attended by the two presidents from the host countries, President [[Ali Bongo Ondimba|Ali Bongo]] of Gabon and President [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo|Teodoro Obiang Nguema]] of Equatorial Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=2012 Africa Cup of Nations draw conducted |url=http://www.cafonline.com/competition/african-cup-of-nations_2012/news/11854-orange-can-2012-final-fixtures-released-today.html |work=cafonline.com |publisher=[[Confederation of African Football]] |date=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The draw saw the 16 qualified teams being pitted into four groups of four teams each. The two top teams from each group will qualify for the quarter finals with the winners progressing to the semi finals and final eventually.

The two hosts were automatically seeded into pot 1. The other 14 qualified teams were ranked based on their performances during the last three Africa Cup of Nations, i.e. the 2006, 2008 and 2010 editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Orange CAN 2012 Official Draw 29 Oct 2011 â Procedures |url=http://www.cafonline.com/userfiles/file/Comp/Orange%20CAN%202012%20Official%20Draw%2029_Oct%202011%20-%20Procedures%20(English)%5B1%5D.pdf |work=cafonline.com |publisher=[[Confederation of African Football]] |date=12 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For each of the last three African Cup of Nations final tournaments, the following system of points is adopted for the qualified countries:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Classification
!Points awarded
|-
!Winner
|7
|-
!Runner-up
|5
|-
!Losing semi-finalists
|3
|-
!Losing quarter-finalists
|2
|-
!Eliminated in 1st round
|1
|}

Moreover, a weighted coefficient on points was given to each of the last three editions of the Africa Cup of Nations as follows:
*[[2010 Africa Cup of Nations|2010 edition]]: points to be multiplied by 3
*[[2008 Africa Cup of Nations|2008 edition]]: points to be multiplied by 2
*[[2006 Africa Cup of Nations|2006 edition]]: points to be multiplied by 1

The teams were then divided into four pots based on the ranking. Each group contained one team from each pot.
