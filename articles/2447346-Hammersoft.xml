==History==
Southern Arkansas University was established by an Act of the Arkansas Legislature in 1909 as a district agricultural high school for southwest Arkansas and was originally named '''Third District Agricultural School''', often called by students and faculty &quot;TDAS.&quot; Its first term began in January 1911, with its curriculum including only subjects at the secondary school level. In 1925, the State Legislature authorized the school to add two years of college work and to change its name to '''Agricultural and Mechanical College, Third District''' (Magnolia A&amp;M). The school continued to offer both high school and junior college courses until 1937, at which time the high school courses were discontinued.

In the fall of 1949, the Board of Trustees, exercising authority vested in it by the State Legislature, decided to develop the college at a four-year, degree-granting institution. The Board authorized the addition of third-year college level courses to being with the fall semester of 1950. Fourth-year courses were added in the fall semester of 1951. By Act Eleven (January 24, 1951), the State Legislature changed the name of the institution to '''Southern State College'''. In 1975, the institution was approved and accredited to offer a Master of Education Degree in selected areas. Following approval of the Board of Trustees, the name of the institution was changed to '''Southern Arkansas University''' by the Board of Higher Education on July 9, 1976, in accordance with Act 343 of the General Assembly of 1975.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.saumag.edu/library/home/southern-arkansas-university-archives/a-historical-sketch-of-the-school/ ]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
