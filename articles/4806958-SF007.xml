'''CPU-Z''' is a [[freeware]] [[system profiler]] ([[system monitor]]) [[application software|application]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] (for all versions from XP on) that detects the [[central processing unit]], [[Random access memory|RAM]], [[motherboard]] chipset, and other hardware features of a modern [[personal computer]], and presents the information in one window.

CPU-Z is more in-depth in almost all areas than the tools provided in the Windows OS to identify various hardware components, and thus assists in identifying certain components without opening the case; particularly the core revision and RAM [[clock rate]]. Most recently, a [[Graphics]] tab has been added.  It has an unusual ability to directly detect hardware features, such as the ability to access, read, and display the [[Serial Presence Detect|SPD]] data from memory modules.  The ability to document clock speed makes it an important tool for motherboard [[overclockers]], as a way of proving the CPU speeds achieved by various experiments.
