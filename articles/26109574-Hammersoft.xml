The '''2003â04 Providence Friars men's basketball team''' represented [[Providence College]] in the [[2008â09 Big East Conference men's basketball season|Big East Conference]]. The team finished with a 11â5 conference record and a 20â9 record overall.

Coming off an 18â14 record and a second-round [[2003 National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] loss in 2002â03, the team returned all five starters for coach [[Tim Welsh]]'s sixth season with the Friars. However, forward Romuald Augustin transferred to [[Bryant Bulldogs men's basketball|Bryant College]] for his fifth year of eligibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecowl.com/2.7829/mills-transfers-to-university-of-omaha-nebraska-1.1103724|title=Mills transfers to University of Omaha-Nebraska|work=The Cowl|first=Kevin|last=O'Brien|date=2004-09-23|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[walk-on (sports)|walk-on]] guard Chris Burns also transferred to Bryant for his sophomore season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bryantbulldogs.com/sports/mbkb/2004/news/2004Dec30BloomTwo|title=Burns Makes Good On Comeback (Post Tourney Notes)|work=[[Bryant University|Bryant College]]|date=2004-12-30|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team also lost two departing seniors, guard Kareem Hayletts and forward Stephen Traugott. On February 24, after playing in 12 games for the Friars, senior forward [[MÄris Ä»aksa]] left the team to play professional basketball in [[Slovenia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/022404aaa.html|title=Maris Laksa Leaves Providence Men's Basketball Team To Pursue Professional Career|work=Friars.com|date=2004-02-24|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friars began the season receiving votes in both polls, but not ranked in either. Following an 8â1 start that included a win over #14 [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]], the Friars earned a #25 ranking in the [[AP Poll]] in time for their January 5 matchup with #18 [[Texas Longhorns men's basketball|Texas]]. The Friars took the Longhorns to overtime, but as time expired in the overtime period, Texas forward [[P. J. Tucker]] released a layup to give the Longhorns a two-point win. The controversial shot was reviewed for more than five minutes by the officials, who determined that the clock read &quot;0.00&quot; but the red backboard light had not yet gone off when the ball was released, which at the time overruled the clock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=240052507|title=Officials have to check replay on shot|work=[[Associated Press]]|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=2004-01-05|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the close loss, the Friars re-emerged in the top 25 three weeks later, following a road win over #4 [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|Connecticut]]. A six-game winning streak that began with a win over #18 [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] propelled the Friars to a #12 ranking in the AP Poll on March 1. This was followed by two home losses to close out the regular season, and a #3 seed in the [[2004 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]]. Following a first-round bye, the Friars dropped a three-point game to [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]] in the quarterfinals, leading to a #5 seed in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. In the first round, the Friars were defeated 66â58 by the #12 seed, [[Pacific Tigers men's basketball|Pacific]]. The Friars ended the season with a #21 ranking in the AP Poll.

The Friars were led in scoring (18.9 ppg) and rebounding (9.4 rpg) by junior forward [[Ryan Gomes]]. He became the fourth Friar to be named a [[2004 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|First Team All-American]] by the [[Associated Press]].
