'''Google Books''' (previously known as '''Google Book Search''' and '''Google Print''') is a service from [[Google]] that searches the full text of books that Google has scanned, converted to text using [[optical character recognition]], and stored in its digital database. The service was formerly known as Google Print when it was introduced at the [[Frankfurt Book Fair]] in October 2004. Google's Library Project, also now known as Google Book Search, was announced in December 2004.

Results from Google Book Search show up in both general web search at google.com and through the dedicated Google Books site (books.google.com). Up to three results from the Google Books index may be displayed, if relevant, above other search results in the Google Web search service (google.com).

Subscribing users can click on a result from Google Books that opens an interface in which the user may view pages from the book, if out of copyright or if the copyright owner has given permission. Books in the public domain are available in &quot;full view&quot; and free for download. For in-print books, Google limits the number of viewable pages through a variety of access limitations and security measures, some based on user-tracking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Greg Duffy | title= Google's Cookie and Hacking Google Print | month= March | year= 2005 | url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2005/3/7/95844/59875| work= [[Kuro5hin]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For books that may be covered by copyright and where the owner has not been identified, only &quot;snippets&quot; (two to three lines of text) are shown, though the full text of the book is searchable.

Most scanned works are no longer in print or commercially available.&lt;ref name=pcworldscan&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=In Google Book Settlement, Business Trumps Ideals|url=http://www.pcworld.com/businesscenter/article/153085/in_google_book_settlement_business_trumps_ideals.html |quote=Of the seven&amp;nbsp;million books Google has scanned, one&amp;nbsp;million are in full preview mode as part of formal publisher agreements.

The Google Books database continues to grow. For users outside the [[United States]], though, Google must be sure that the work in question is indeed out of copyright under local laws. According to a member of the Google Books Support Team, &quot;Since whether a book is in the public domain can often be a tricky legal question, we err on the side of caution and display at most a few snippets until we have determined that the book has entered the public domain.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | author= Ryan Sands | title= From the mail bag: Public domain books and downloads | work= Inside Google Book Search |format=[[blog]]| date= November 9, 2006 | url=http://booksearch.blogspot.com/2006/11/from-mail-bag-public-domain-books-and.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users outside the United States can however access a large number of public domain books scanned by Google using copies stored on the [[Internet Archive]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archive.org/details/googlebooks Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004===
'''December 2004''' Google signaled an extension to its Google Print initiative known as the Google Print Library Project.&lt;ref name=&quot;gblp1&quot;&gt;O'Sullivan, Joseph and Adam Smith.
[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2004/12/all-booked-up.html &quot;All booked up,&quot;] ''Googleblog.'' December 14, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Google announced partnerships with several high-profile university and public libraries, including the [[University of Michigan]], [[Harvard University|Harvard]] ([[Harvard University Library]]), [[Stanford]] ([[Green Library]]), [[Oxford University|Oxford]] ([[Bodleian Library]]), and the [[New York Public Library]]. According to press releases and university librarians, Google plans to digitize and make available through its Google Books service approximately 15&amp;nbsp;million volumes within a decade. The announcement soon triggered controversy, as publisher and author associations challenged Google's plans to digitize, not just books in the public domain, but also titles still under copyright.

===2005===
'''September&amp;ndash;October 2005''' Two lawsuits against Google charge that the company has not respected [[copyright]]s and has failed to properly compensate authors and publishers. One is a class action suit on behalf of authors (Authors Guild v. Google, Sept. 20 2005) and the other is a civil lawsuit brought by five large publishers and the [[Association of American Publishers]]. ([[McGraw Hill v. Google]], Oct. 19 2005)&lt;ref name=LAWSUITS&gt;

==Google Books Library Project participants==
{{Main|Google Books Library Project}}
The number of participating institutions has grown since the inception of the [[Google Books Library Project]];&lt;ref name=&quot;gblp1&quot;/&gt; The University of Mysore has been mentioned in many media reports as being a library partner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20070522-google-to-scan-800000-manuscripts-books-from-indian-university.html Ars Technica]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindustantimes.com/StoryPage/Print.aspx?Id=4e4d6d35-ef7f-4e42-808c-589ea4540202 Hindustani Times &quot;Google to digitise 800,000 books at Mysore varsity&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; They are not, however, listed as a partner by Google.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/googlebooks/partners.html Google Library Partners]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement, fair use and related issues==
The publishing industry and writers' groups have criticized the project's inclusion of snippets of copyrighted works as infringement. In late 2005 the [[Authors Guild]] of America and [[Association of American Publishers]] separately sued [[Google]], citing &quot;massive [[copyright infringement]].&quot; Google countered that its project represented a [[fair use]] and is the digital age equivalent of a [[card catalog]] with every word in the publication indexed.&lt;ref name=LAWSUITS/&gt; Despite Google taking measures to provide full text of only works in public domain, and providing only a searchable summary online for books still under copyright protection, publishers maintain that Google has no right to copy full text of books with copyrights and save them, in large amounts, into its own database.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= People's Daily Online | title= Google's digital library suspended | date= August 15, 2005 | url=http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/200508/15/eng20050815_202595.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other lawsuits followed but in 2006 a German lawsuit was withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Book Search Wins Victory In German Challenge |author=Danny Sullivan |url=http://blog.searchenginewatch.com/blog/060628-152950 |date=2006-06-28 |work=[[Search Engine Watch]] | format=blog |accessdate=2006-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2006, HervÃ© de la MartiniÃ¨re,&lt;ref name=Sage&gt;{{cite news|author=Sage, Adam|title=French publishers toast triumph over Google|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article6962221.ece|date=December 19, 2009|publisher=The Times of London|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; a French publisher known as La MartiniÃ¨re and [[Ãditions du Seuil]],&lt;ref name=Smith&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, Heather|title=Google's French Book Scanning Project Halted by Court |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=apZ3UG9CPLo8|publisher=Bloomberg|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; announced its intention to sue Google France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= John Oates | title= French publisher sues Google | work= The Register | date= June 7, 2006 | url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/06/07/france_sues_google/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the Paris Civil Court awarded [[euro|â¬]]300,000 (approximately {{dollarsign|USD}}430,000) in damages and interest and ordered Google to pay â¬10,000 a day until it removes the publisher's books from its database.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fine for Google over French books |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8420876.stm|publisher=BBC News|date=December 18, 2009|accessdate=2009-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court wrote, &quot;Google violated author copyright laws by fully reproducing and making accessible&quot; books that Seuil owns without its permission&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; and that Google &quot;committed acts of breach of copyright, which are of harm to the publishers&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sage /&gt; Google said it will appeal.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt; Syndicat National de l'Edition, which joined the lawsuit, said Google has scanned about 100,000 French works under copyright.&lt;ref name=Smith /&gt;

In December 2009, Chinese author [[Mian Mian]] filed a civil lawsuit for $8,900 against Google for scanning her novel, ''Acid Lovers''. This is the first such lawsuit to be filed against Google in China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/1803332/google_faces_chinese_lawsuit_over_digital_book_project/index.html?source=r_technology Redorbit.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2007, Thomas Rubin, associate general counsel for copyright, trademark, and trade secrets at Microsoft, accused Google of violating copyright law with their book search service. Rubin specifically criticized Google's policy of freely copying any work until notified by the copyright holder to stop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= Thomas Claburn | title= Microsoft Attorney Accuses Google Of Copyright Violations | work= InformationWeek | date= March 6, 2007 | url=http://www.informationweek.com/internet/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=197800578}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Siva Vaidhyanathan]], associate professor of Media Studies and Law at the [[University of Virginia]] has argued&lt;ref&gt;Siva Vaidhyanathan. &quot;The Googlization of Everything and the Future of Copyright,&quot; ''University of California Davis Law Review'' volume 40 (March 2007), pp. 1207â1231, [http://lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu/issues/Vol40/Issue3/DavisVol40No3_Vaidhyanathan.pdf Lawreview.law.ucdavis.edu] (pdf)&lt;/ref&gt; that the project poses a danger for the doctrine of [[fair use]], because the fair use claims are arguably so excessive that it may cause judicial limitation of that right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.firstmonday.org/podcasts/transcripts/transcripts_siva07.html First Monday] Transcript September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be said that, because rights are almost always inherently limited in some way, judicial consideration ''per se'', including limitation, of the principle poses no &quot;threat&quot; at all (and might produce benefit through articulated consideration and delineation - that would have not otherwise occurred - of the principle).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Because ''Author's Guild v. Google'' did not go to court, the fair use dispute is left unresolved.

Google licensing of public domain works is also an area of concern due to using of [[digital watermarking]] techniques with the books. Some published works that are in the public domain, such as all [[Copyright status of work by the U.S. government|works created by the U.S. Federal government]], are still treated like other works under copyright, and therefore locked after 1922.&lt;ref&gt;Robert B. Townsend, [http://www.historians.org/Perspectives/issues/2007/0709/0709vie1.cfm Google Books: Is It Good for History?], ''Perspectives'' (September 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Settlement agreement===
{{Main|Google Book Search Settlement Agreement}}
The [[Authors Guild]], the publishing industry and Google entered into a [[Google Book Search Settlement Agreement|settlement agreement]] October 28, 2008, with Google agreeing to pay a total of $125&amp;nbsp;million to rights-holders of books they had scanned, to cover the plaintiffs' court costs, and to create a [[Book Rights Registry]]. The settlement has to be approved by the court, which could occur some time after October 2009.&lt;ref name=LAWSUITS/&gt; Reaction to the settlement has been mixed, with Harvard Library, one of the original contributing libraries to Google Library, choosing to withdraw its partnership with Google if &quot;more reasonable terms&quot; cannot be found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Google Online Book Deal at Risk |url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=524989}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the $125&amp;nbsp;million settlement signed in October 2008, Google created a Google Book Settlement web site that went active on February 11, 2009. This site allows authors and other rights holders of out-of-print (but copyright) books to submit a claim by June 5, 2010.&lt;ref name=schonfeld&gt;[http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/02/11/google-book-settlement-site-is-up-paying-authors-60-per-scanned-book/ &quot;Google Book Settlement Site Is Up; Paying Authors $60 Per Scanned Book&quot;], by Erick Schonfeld on February 11, 2009, at [[TechCrunch]]&lt;/ref&gt; In return they will receive $60 per full book, or $5 to $15 for partial works.&lt;ref name=schonfeld/&gt; In return, Google will be able to index the books and display snippets in search results, as well as up to 20% of each book in preview mode.&lt;ref name=schonfeld/&gt; Google will also be able to show ads on these pages and make available for sale digital versions of each book.&lt;ref name=schonfeld/&gt; Authors and copyright holders will receive 63 percent of all advertising and e-commerce revenues associated with their works.&lt;ref name=schonfeld/&gt;

In the US, several organizations who took no part of the settlement, like the [[American Society of Journalists and Authors]], criticized the settlement fundamentally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asja.org/google/ American Society of Journalists and Authors]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the New York book settlement is not restricted to US authors, but relevant to authors of the whole world. This led to objections even on the level of some European governments and critical voices in many European newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.faz.net/s/RubBE163169B4324E24BA92AAEB5BDEF0DA/Doc~E74446D08BF584F8D8725EB2BD5BDF90B~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html Es wird Zeit, dass die Bundesregierung eingreift]&lt;/ref&gt; American author [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] has launched a petition against the settlement, which was signed by almost 300 authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2010/jan/22/ursula-le-guin-revolt-google-digital | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Alison | last=Flood | title=Ursula Le Guin leads revolt against Google digital book settlement | date=January 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In October 2009, Google countered ongoing critics by stating that its scanning of books and putting them online would protect the world's cultural heritage; Google co-founder [[Sergey Brin]] stated, &quot;The famous [[Library of Alexandria]] burned three times, in 48&amp;nbsp;BC, AD&amp;nbsp;273 and AD&amp;nbsp;640, as did the [[Library of Congress]], where a fire in 1851 destroyed two-thirds of the collection. I hope such destruction never happens again, but history would suggest otherwise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/8298674.stm BBC: Google hits back at book critics]&lt;/ref&gt;  This characterization was rebuked by Pam Samuelson, UC Berkeley Professor of Law&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openbookalliance.org/2009/10/pam-samuelson-on-google-books-its-not-a-library/ Openbookalliance.org]&lt;/ref&gt; saying &quot;Libraries everywhere are terrified that Google will engage in price-gouging when setting prices for institutional subscriptions to GBS contents ... Brin forgot to mention another significant difference between GBS and traditional libraries: their policies on patron privacy. ... Google has been unwilling to make meaningful commitments to protect user privacy. Traditional libraries, by contrast, have been important guardians of patron privacy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/pamela-samuelson/google-books-is-not-a-lib_b_317518.html Google Books Is Not a Library]&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have denounced the settlement for neglecting to protect [[Privacy laws of the United States|reader privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Case for Book Privacy Parity: Google Books and the Shift from Offline to Online Reading |url=http://hlpronline.com/2010/05/the-case-for-book-privacy-parity-google-books-and-the-shift-from-offline-to-online-reading/ |publisher=Harvard Law and Policy Review|accessdate=September 8, 2010|date=May 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 22, 2011, U.S. Circuit Judge Denny Chin issued a ruling on the amended settlement agreement, rejecting it.  From the ruling: &quot;While the digitization of books and the creation of a universal digital library would benefit many, the ASA would simply go too far. It would permit this class action - - which was brought against defendant Google Inc. (&quot;Google&quot;) to challenge
its scanning of books and display of &quot;snippets&quot; for on-line searching - - to implement a forward-looking business arrangement that would grant Google significant rights to exploit entire
books, without permission of the copyright owners. Indeed, the ASA would give Google a significant advantage over competitors, rewarding it for engaging in wholesale copying of copyrighted works without permission, while releasing claims well beyond those presented in the case.  Accordingly, and for the reasons more fully discussed below, the motion for final approval of the ASA is denied.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;[http://1.usa.gov/elvHew Full text of Judge Chin's ruling.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' commented on the practical impact of this ruling saying that: &quot;Judge Chin's ruling changes little for Google users. About two million books that are in the public domain, such as works of William Shakespeare, currently can be viewed free on the Google Books site. [...] Google Books users currently can view long previews of another two million books that are in copyright and in print, thanks to agreements between Google and tens of thousands of publishers that were separate from the legal settlement. Millions more books that are in copyright but out of print are currently available in Google Books in a shorter 'snippet view.' Had the settlement been approved, users would have been able to see longer previews and potentially buy those books.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Amir Efrati and Jeffrey A. Trachtenberg |date=March 23, 2011 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704461304576216923562033348.html |title=Judge Rejects Google Books Settlement |publisher= [[Wall Street Journal]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language issues==
Some European politicians and intellectuals have criticized Google's effort on &quot;language-imperialism&quot; grounds, arguing that because the vast majority of books proposed to be scanned are in English, it will result in disproportionate representation of natural languages in the digital world. German, Russian, and French, for instance, are popular languages in scholarship; the disproportionate online emphasis on English could shape access to historical scholarship, and, ultimately, the growth and direction of future scholarship. Among these critics is [[Jean-NoÃ«l Jeanneney]], the former president of the ''[[BibliothÃ¨que nationale de France]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | isbn=0-226-39577-4 |author=[[Jean-NoÃ«l Jeanneney]] |title=Google and the Myth of Universal Knowledge: A View from Europe |format=book abstract; Foreword by Ian Wilson |date=2006-10-23 |accessdate=2007-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Google Books versus Google Scholar==
While Google Books has digitized large numbers of journal back issues, its scans do not include the [[metadata]] required for identifying specific articles in specific issues. This has led the makers of [[Google Scholar]] to start their own program to digitize and host older journal articles (in agreement with their publishers).&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Quint, [http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/nbReader.asp?ArticleId=37309 &quot;Changes at Google Scholar: A Conversation With Anurag Acharya&quot;], ''Information Today'', August 27, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
