The '''[[University of South Florida|South Florida]] Bulls''' are a [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Bowl Subdivision|Division I FBS]] [[college football]] program that plays its home games in [[Tampa, Florida]]. The team began playing in 1997, holding its first team meeting under a shade tree as the school had no proper football facilities on campus.&lt;ref name=DrivingForce&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collegefootball.rivals.com/content.asp?CID=722502 |title=Meet the driving force behind South Florida |first=Matt |last=Hayes |publisher=''Rivals.com'' |date=2007-10-05 |accessdate=2005-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jim Leavitt]], previously the [[defensive coordinator]] at [[Kansas State Wildcats|Kansas State]], was hired as the team's first head coach.

After competing their first four years as a [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I-AA]] (now Division I FCS) independent, the Bulls moved to Division I-A, now Division I FBS, in 2001 but remained independent. They joined [[Conference USA]] in 2003 until becoming a member of the [[Big East Conference|Big East]] in 2005.

The Bulls' starting quarterback for the [[2007 South Florida Bulls football team]] was sophomore [[Matt Grothe]], who was awarded the Big East Rookie of the Year award in 2006 after being the most productive freshman in total offense with 258.5 yards per game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bigeast.org/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/120606aac.html Official Big East website]&lt;/ref&gt; South Florida is also home to senior [[defensive end]] [[George Selvie]], who was named the school's first Consensus [[All-American]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gousfbulls.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=7700&amp;ATCLID=1350327 GoUSFBulls.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

South Florida received increased press coverage for their upsets of Top 25 ranked teams such as [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]] (in [[2006 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|2006]] and [[2007 West Virginia Mountaineers football team|2007]]), [[2005 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]] (in 2005) and [[2007 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn]] (in 2007) and the Florida State Seminoles (2009). The 2007 football season marked their first ascent into the [[AP Poll]], first placing at #23, rising to #18 in Week 4, jumping to #6 after the win against West Virginia, rising one more spot to #5 in week 6 after a victory over [[2007 Florida Atlantic Owls football team|Florida Atlantic University]], and jumping 3 more spots to #2 with 11 first place votes after beating the [[2007 UCF Knights football team|University of Central Florida]].  The Bulls' high ranking was short lived, as South Florida lost its next 3 games and tumbled out of the rankings.  However, the Bulls rebounded towards the end of the season, finishing the regular season ranked #21 in the BCS standings and #23 in the AP poll. Following their final regular season game, they faced the unranked [[2007 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon Ducks]] in the [[Brut Sun Bowl]].  Oregon defeated the Bulls by the score of 56-21, in which USF set a Sun Bowl record for most points allowed to an opponent.  USF was dropped from the national rankings in both the AP Top 25 and USA Today polls following the loss in this bowl game.

USF won its first bowl game in its second bowl appearance with a victory over former [[Conference USA]] rivals, the [[East Carolina Pirates football|East Carolina Pirates]] on December 23, 2006 in the [[Papajohns.com Bowl]]. The previous year, USF lost to the [[North Carolina State Wolfpack|NC State Wolfpack]] in the Bulls' first-ever bowl appearance, the [[2005 Meineke Car Care Bowl]].

Leavitt remained as the team's head coach throughout this period.  He was fired on January 8, 2010 after an investigation revealed that during halftime of a game against Louisville, he grabbed a player by the shoulder pads and struck him across the face two times.  The investigation also claimed that Leavitt interfered with the investigation by telling several coaches and players to change their stories [http://www.usf.edu/pdf/Enclosure-1-Leavitt-Review-Final.pdf].  Leavitt maintains he never struck the player, but was merely trying to console him, and is currently suing USF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/sports/college/article1079972.ece|title=Ex-coach Jim Leavitt sues USF|publisher=tampabay.com|accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 14, 2010, [[Skip Holtz]] was named head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ncaafootball.fanhouse.com/2010/01/14/south-florida-hires-skip-holtz/|title=South Florida Hires Skip Holtz|publisher=ncaafootball.fanhouse.com|accessdate=2010-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadium==
[[Image:USF football game vs UCF.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Halftime show in a 2007 USF Bulls game played at Raymond James Stadium]]
[[Raymond James Stadium]] is a $168.5 million facility which opened September 20, 1998 with a Tampa Bay Buccaneers game against the Chicago Bears. Two weeks later, the Bulls debuted in their new home with a 45-6 win over Citadel in front of 32,598 fans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmnathletics.com//pdf4/40222.pdf University of South Florida Bulls 2006 Football Media Guide (pdf file) page 12]&lt;/ref&gt; From 1998 to 2007, only the lower half of the stadium has been typically opened for USF games, allowing for a capacity of 41,441,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmnathletics.com//pdf4/40222.pdf University of South Florida Bulls 2006 Football Media Guide (pdf file) page 10, sixth paragraph.]&lt;/ref&gt; (although the upper deck has been opened numerous times to accommodate crowds in excess of what the lower bowl can handle). However, as of 2008, USF has opened the upper deck for every home game and is selling season tickets in the upper deck as well. The largest crowd to see the Bulls play a home game came on September 28, 2007 against then #5 ranked West Virginia, when 67,012 saw the #18 Bulls win.&lt;ref&gt;67,018&lt;/ref&gt;  The Bulls played at [[Houlihan's Stadium]] in 1997.

The Bulls have continued to enjoy a winning edge in Raymond James, building a 43-11 record since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmnathletics.com//pdf4/40222.pdf University of South Florida Bulls 2006 Football Media Guide. Includes the 2006 results]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Bulls football games currently air on the radio in Tampa on 970 [[WFLA-AM]]. Play-by-play man [[Jim Louk]] is teamed with color analyst and former Tampa Bay Buccaneer [[Mark Robinson (American football)|Mark Robinson]] in the booth for the broadcasts. Many of the televised games air locally on [[ESPN Plus]] outlet [[WFTS-TV]]. Some replays of the games can be seen on [[Bright House Sports Network]]. Due to USF's affiliation in the Big East Conference, most games can be seen on one of the many channels [[ESPN]] owns.

==Rivals==
Due to the youth of the program and the aggressive growth that it has experienced, establishing a permanent rival has posed somewhat of a challenge. Rapidly changing conference affiliations and a quick ascension through the NCAA football ranks have made an annual rivalry difficult. On the heels of upsets that have garnered national attention, the seeds of rivalry have been planted with powers such as Louisville and West Virginia. Additionally, due to the close geographic proximity of the two schools, the [[University of Central Florida]] has expressed interest in extending their four game series with the Bulls' by establishing an annual home-and-home series. However, according to the Tampa Tribune report released on 7 July 2007, USF does not plan on renewing the game with [[UCF]] after 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbo.com/sports/bulls/MGBNB9NBT3F.html Bulls Series With UCF Likely Over&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Likely candidates for a future rivalry game include [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville]], another former member of [[Conference USA]] before its move to the Big East; [[West Virginia Mountaineers football|West Virginia]]; [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights football|Rutgers]]; and [[Miami Hurricanes football|Miami]], with whom USF has announced a 6-year series to be played on [[Thanksgiving]] weekend. The last 4 games of the USF/UM series (2010&amp;ndash;2013) will be televised by one of the ESPN networks on Thanksgiving weekend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2007/06/01/Sports/USF_adds_statement_se.shtml Sports: USF adds statement series with Hurricanes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; With UM locked up for 6 years, USF appears very unlikely to continue the series with UCF, but instead seems focused on potentially establishing a rivalry with Miami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbo.com/sports/bulls/MGBQX2WKD2F.html USF-UM Series Extended, Moved To Thanksgiving Weekend&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; After the 2009 win against #18 Florida State University (USF-17 FSU-7), FSU is another potential candidate for a huge in-state rival.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} 

Recently the Big East Conference plans to create a 12 team model that includes the UCF Knights. While the conference expansion landscape of college football is fluid, the addition of UCF to the Big East would indeed jump start the &quot;The War on I-4&quot; again. A rivalry between South Florida and UCF will easily reform, especially if UCF is able to knock off the Bulls in their first few seasons in the league. 

To date the most likely rivalries grow in the future for South Florida include West Virginia, Rutgers, Miami, and UCF.
