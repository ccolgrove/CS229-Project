The '''United States U-20 women's national soccer team''' is a youth [[association football|soccer]] team operated under the auspices of [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]].  Its primary role is the development of players in preparation for the full [[United States women's national soccer team|Women's National Team]].  The team's most recent major tournament was the [[2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], in which the United States team won 2-1 over [[Korea DPR U-20 women's national football team|North Korea]].  The team competes in a variety of competitions, including the biennial [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], which is the top competition for this age group.  The current head coach is [[Steve Swanson (soccer)|Steve Swanson]].

==History==
===Beginnings as a U-18 program===
The United States U-20 team has been active since 1998; however, it was run as a U-18 team from its inception until 2001.&lt;ref&gt;2009 WNT U.S. Soccer Media Guide&lt;/ref&gt;  It was led by [[Shannon Higgins-Cirovski]], the first coach in the team's history, through the middle of 1999 before she left for the [[Maryland Terrapins]] soccer team.  [[Jay Hoffman (soccer)|Jay Hoffman]], who served as Higgins-Cirovski's assistant, took charge of the team and led them to a gold medal for the [[1999 Pan American Games]], the first time the tournament was opened to women's teams. Among the U-18 women playing at the 1999 Pan American Games were future [[United States women's national soccer team|senior national team]] members [[Cat Reddick]] and [[Hope Solo]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Articles/1999/08/U-S-Under-18-Women-Defeat-Mexico-1-0-Take-Home-Inaugural-Pan-Am-Championship.aspx U.S. Under-18 Women Defeat Mexico 1-0, Take Home Inaugural Pan Am Championship], US Soccer, 5 August 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The switch to U-19===
====2001 through 2003====
In 2001, the [[United States Soccer Federation]] decided to change the age limit from the U-18 team to U-19.  The move was in preparation for [[FIFA]]'s introduction of the first ever [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup|FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]] (which has since changed).  The new U-19 squad won the inaugural [[2002 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]] in [[Canada]], where they beat [[Canada U-19 women's national soccer team|the hosts]] on a [[golden goal]] by captain and future [[United States women's national soccer team|United States Women's National Team]] mainstay [[Lindsay Tarpley]]. Five other members of that same team would join Tarpley as teammates on the senior international team: [[Rachel Buehler]], [[Lori Chalupny]], [[Heather O'Reilly]], [[Leslie Osborne]], and [[Angie Woznuk]].  Other notable 2002 team members were [[Kelly Wilson]], the all-time leading goal scorer in the history of the U-20 team, as well as two-time [[Hermann Trophy]] winner [[Kerri Hanks]], who would go on to become one of the most decorated players in women's collegiate soccer.

====2004====
In 2004, the U-19 team placed third at the [[2004 FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]] in [[Thailand]], after having been defeated by [[Germany U-19 women's national football team|Germany]] in the semifinals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/News/U-20-WNT/2004/11/U-S-Women-Fall-To-Germany-3-1-At-U-19-World-Championship.aspx U.S. Women Fall to Germany, 3-1, at U-19 World Championship], US Soccer, 24 November 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  The tournament marked the world championship debut of future [[United States women's national soccer team|senior national team]] members [[Yael Averbuch]], [[Stephanie Lopez]], [[Amy Rodriguez]], and [[Megan Rapinoe]].  However in 2006, [[FIFA]] increased the age limit of the [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup|FIFA U-19 Women's World Championship]] to 20. 2004 also saw the first loss to a similar-aged team in the history of the program when the squad lost to [[Japan women's national football team|Japan]].

===Competing as a U-20 team===
====2005 &amp; 2006====
As the [[United States Soccer Federation]] did in 2001 prior to the introduction of the U-19 tournament, they raised the age of the squad from U-19 to U-20 in 2005.  The move was, again, in response to FIFA's altering of the competition from U-19 to U-20.  The actual team's play in 2005 was quiet due to a transition in coaches.

In 2006, the United States U-20 team played in a whopping 50 matches prior to the [[2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship]] in [[Russia]]; however, the team finished in fourth place.  The U.S. lost to [[China U-20 women's national football team|China]] in [[Penalty shootout (association football)|penalties]] in the semifinal and followed up the loss with another to [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] in the third-place match, also on penalties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/News/U-20-WNT/2006/09/USA-Falls-To-Brazil-In-Penalties-To-Finish-Fourth-At-U-20-Womens-World-Championship.aspx USA Falls to Brazil in Penalties to Finish Fourth at U-20 Women's World Championship], US Soccer, 3 September 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  Seven members of that 2006 team: [[Lauren Cheney]], [[Christina DiMartino]], [[Tobin Heath]], [[Stephanie Lopez]], [[Casey Nogueira]], [[Kelley O'Hara]], and [[Amy Rodriguez]], have made appearances for the [[United States women's national soccer team|Senior National Team]].  Lopez played in the [[2007 FIFA Women's World Cup]], and, joined by Cheney, Heath, and Rodriguez, also represented the United States at the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].  Nogueira and O'Hara helped the 2008 U-20 team to qualify for the [[2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]] that same year.

====2007 &amp; 2008====
2007 saw the squad sent to the [[2007 Pan American Games]], just as they had done prior in the [[1999 Pan American Games]].  This time around, the United States sent along two &quot;over-aged players&quot; in [[Lauren Cheney]] and [[Brittany Taylor (footballer)|Brittany Taylor]].  The decision proved costly as the supplemented U-20 team were dismantled in the finals, 5-0, to a full-strength [[Brazil women's national football team|Brazil]] squad.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/News/U-20-WNT/2007/07/U-20-WNT-Fall-In-Pan-Am-Final-To-Full-Brazilian-National-Team.aspx U-20 WNT Fall in Pan-Am Final to Full Brazilian National Team], US Soccer, 26 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, two years removed from the disastrous fourth-place finish at the [[2006 FIFA U-20 Women's World Championship|2006 U-20 World Championship]], the United States U-20 women finally reclaimed the World Cup title at the [[2008 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]] in [[Chile]], with [[Sydney Leroux]] winning the [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup#Awards|Golden Ball]] and [[FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup#Awards|Golden Shoe]] for being named the best player of the tournament as well as scoring the most goals.  To date, [[Alex Morgan]], [[Sydney Leroux]], [[Christine Nairn]] are the only members of the 2008 squad to be capped by the [[United States women's national soccer team|senior national team]].

====2009 &amp; 2010====
In 2009, [[Tony DiCicco]] handed the coaching reins back to [[Jillian Ellis]], who had coached the 2007 Pan American Games squad. 2009 also saw the influx of players who took part in the inaugural [[FIFA U-17 Women's World Cup]] into the U-20s, including [[Kristen Mewis]], [[US Soccer]]'s 2008 Young Female Player of the Year, and [[Vicki DiMartino]], younger sister of U-20 alumni [[Christina DiMartino|Christina]] (2006) and [[Gina DiMartino|Gina]] (2007â2008). Two members of the 2008 squad, [[Sydney Leroux]] and [[Christine Nairn]], returned to captain the team through the next World Cup cycle.

The team won the [[2010 CONCACAF Under-20 Women's Championship]] title the next year and secured a berth to the [[2010 FIFA U-20 Women's World Cup]], to be held in [[Germany]]. [[Sydney Leroux]] was the leading scorer at the tournament with six goals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ussoccer.com/News/U-20-WNT/2010/01/US-U20-WNT-Claim-CONCACAF-Crown-with-1-0-Defeat-of-Mexico.aspx U.S. U-20 WNT Claim CONCACAF Crown with 1-0 Defeat of Mexico], US Soccer, 30 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In the World Cup, they won their group, but lost on penalty kicks to [[Nigeria U-20 women's national soccer team|Nigeria]] in the quarterfinals. Leroux was again their leading scorer, tallying five goals in their four matches.
