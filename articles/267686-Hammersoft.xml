The '''University of Saskatchewan''' ('''U of S''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[public university|public]] [[research university]], founded in 1907, and located on the east side of the [[South Saskatchewan River]] in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada. An &quot;Act to establish and incorporate a University for the Province of Saskatchewan&quot; was passed by the provincial legislature in 1907. It established the provincial university on April 3, 1907 &quot;for the purpose of providing facilities for [[higher education]] in all its branches and enabling all persons without regard to race, creed or religion to take the fullest advantage&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;1907act&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Since its origins as an agricultural college, [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Graduate Studies and Research|research]] has played an important role at the university. Discoveries made at the U of S include sulphate-resistant cement and the [[cobalt-60 (isotope)|cobalt-60]] cancer therapy unit. The university currently offers over [[University of Saskatchewan Academics|200 academic programs]]. Duncan P. McColl was appointed as the first registrar, establishing the first convocation from which Chief Justice [[Edward Ludlow Wetmore|Edward L. Wetmore]] was elected as the first chancellor. [[Walter Charles Murray]] became the first president of the university's board of governors.&lt;ref name=SK-history&gt;{{cite book |

===Beginnings===
[[Image:Health Sciences Building.JPG|thumb|right|The eastern faÃ§ade of the Academic Health Sciences Building prior to the construction of the E-Wing.]]

&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Saskatchewan, at Saskatoon, was granted a provincial charter on April 3, 1907. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates' |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A provincial statute known as the ''University Act''. It provided for a publicly funded, yet independent institution to be created for the citizens of the whole province.

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The scope of the new institution was to include colleges of arts and science, including art, music and commerce, agriculture with forestry, domestic science, education, engineering, law, medicine, pharmacy, veterinary science and dentistry.

Saskatoon was chosen as the site for the University on April 7, 1909 by the board of governors. On October 12, 1912 the first building opened its doors for student admission. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates' |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It awarded its first degrees in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; In the early part of this century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

[[Battleford, Saskatchewan|Battleford]], [[Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan|Moose Jaw]], [[Prince Albert, Saskatchewan|Prince Albert]], [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], and [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|Saskatoon]] all lobbied to be the location of the new university. Walter Murray preferred the provincial capital, [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]]. In a politically influenced vote, Saskatoon was chosen on April 7, 1909.&lt;ref name=&quot;SK-history&quot;/&gt;

===Campus===
[[List of National Historic Sites of Canada|National Historic Site]] located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan

A location next to the [[South Saskatchewan River]], across from the [[Central Business District, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan|city centre]] of Saskatoon, was selected for the [[campus]]. David Roberston Brown (architect) of Brown &amp; Vallance were the initial architects constructing a campus plan and the first university buildings in [[Gothic Revival architecture in Canada|Collegiate Gothic style]]: The [[Prime Minister of Canada]], [[Sir Wilfrid Laurier]], laid the cornerstone of the first building, the [[College Building (Saskatchewan)|College Building]], on July 29, 1910. The first building to be started on the new campus, the [[College Building (Saskatchewan)|College Building]], built 1910-1912 opened in 1913; in 2001, it was declared a National Historic Site of Canada &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Administration Building (1910-12); Saskatchewan Hall Student Residence (1910-12). Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Engineering Building (1910-12) as well as additions 1913 in 1920and rebuilt the building after it burned in 1925. Brown &amp; Vallance designed the Barn and Stock Pavilion (1910-12) and Emmanuel College (1910-12). Brown &amp; Vallance built the Faculty Club (1911-12) and rebuilt it after it burned in 1964. Brown &amp; Vallance constructed the President's Residence (1911-13) Qu'Appelle Hall Student Residence (1914-16) Physics Building (1919-21); Chemistry Building (1922-23); St. Andrew's Presbyterian College (1922-23); Memorial Gates (1927-28) and the Field Husbandry Building (1929). &lt;ref&gt;http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1672 David Roberston Brown&lt;/ref&gt;

The original buildings were built using native [[limestone]] â greystone â which was mined just north of campus. Over the years, the greystone was to become one of the most recognizable campus signatures. When the local supply of limestone was exhausted, the University turned to Tyndall Stone, so called because it is quarried at Tyndall, Manitoba.

The Old Stone School, built in 1887, was declared a National Historic Site of Canada &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The original architectural plan called for the university buildings to be constructed around a green space known as ''the bowl''. Currently, the original university buildings are being connected by skywalks and tunnels. Clockwise, from the north; Thorvaldson Building (August 22, 1924) (Spinks addition); Geology, W.P. Thompson Biology (1960) adjoined to Physics Building (1921); College Building (May 1, 1913) (Administration addition); Saskatchewan cojoined with Athabasca Hall (1964); Qu'Appelle Hall (1916); Marquis Hall adjoined to Place Riel â Qu'Appelle Addition; Murray Memorial Main Library (1956); Arts (1960) cojoined with Law and adjoined to Commerce building complete the initial circle around the perimeter of the bowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Establishment of colleges===
[[Image:Thorvaldson.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to Thorvaldson Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan]]

Roughly adhering to the original plan of 1909, numerous colleges were established: [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Arts and Science|Arts &amp; Science]] (1909), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Agriculture and Bioresources College|Agriculture]] now called Agriculture and Bioresource (1912), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Engineering|Engineering]] (1912), [[University of Saskatchewan College of Law|Law]] (1913), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Pharmacy and Nutrition|Pharmacy now called Pharmacy &amp; Nutrition]] (1914), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#CITEREFU of S Â» Prospective Students Â» Programs Â» Direct Entry Programs Â»Commerce1994-2006|Commerce]] now the N. Murray Edwards School of Business (1917), [[College of Medicine - University of Saskatchewan|Medicine]] (1926), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Education|Education]] (1927), Home Economics (1928), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Nursing|Nursing]] (1938), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Graduate Studies and Research|Graduate Studies and Research]] (1946), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Kinesiology|Physical Education]] now called Kinesiology (1958), [[Veterinary Medicine - University of Saskatchewan|Veterinary Medicine]] (1964), [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Dentistry|Dentistry]](1965), and [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#Medicine (School of Physical Therapy|School of Physical Therapy]] (1976).

The U of S also has several graduate programs amongst these colleges, which give rise to a masters or doctorate degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

[[Image:Archaeology-UofS.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Field Husbandry &gt; Crop Science &gt; Anthropology &amp; Archaeology Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan]]
Theological Colleges, affiliated with the university, were also established: [[University of Saskatchewan Academics#College of Emmanuel and St. Chad|Emmanuel College]] â (Anglican denomination) (1909), St. Andrew's College (as ''[[Presbyterian Church in Canada|Presbyterian]] College, Saskatoon'') then [[United Church of Canada]] (1913), [[Lutheran Theological Seminary, Saskatoon|Lutheran Theological Seminary]] (1920), [[St. Thomas More College]] (1936), and [[Central Pentecostal College]] (1983).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008258 University of Saskatchewan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regina College was saved from bankruptcy and became part of the university in 1934, and was given degree-granting privileges in 1959, making it a second University of Saskatchewan campus. By another act of legislation in 1974, Regina College was made an independent institution known as the [[University of Regina]].

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

Correspondence courses were established in 1929.

Other federated and affiliated colleges include [[Briercrest Bible College]] and Biblical Seminary in [[Caronport, Saskatchewan]]; [[Gabriel Dumont Institute|Gabriel Dumont College]] and St. Peter's Historic Junior College in [[Muenster, Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

===Later development===
[[Image:Engineering-UofS.jpg|thumb|right|Entrance to the Engineering Building located on the Main campus of the University of Saskatchewan]]

In the late 1990s, the U of S launched a major revitalisation program, comprising new capital projects such as an expansion to the [[Veterinary Medicine - University of Saskatchewan|Western College of Veterinary Medicine]], the building of a new parkade, and a revision of its internal road layout (which has already seen the East Road access being realigned). The Thorvaldson Building, which currently is home to the departments of chemistry and computer science, hosts a new expansion known as the Spinks addition. The College of Pharmacy and Nutrition has also seen a number of renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The University of Saskatchewan 1999â2000 Annual Report |url=http://www.usask.ca/uofs/annual-report2000/bricks.html |work=usask.ca |accessdate=2007-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Land holdings===
Up until the late 1980s, the University of Saskatchewan held an extensive area of land in the northeast quadrant of Saskatoon, stretching far beyond the core campus, east of Preston Avenue and north of the [[Sutherland, Saskatoon|Sutherland]] and [[Forest Grove, Saskatoon|Forest Grove]] subdivisions. Much of this land was used for farming, though some areas were intended for future campus and facility development. In the late 1980s, most U of S land beyond Circle Drive was earmarked for residential development; [[Silverspring, Saskatoon|Silverspring]] was the first of these neighbourhoods to be developed.

[[File:CobaltTeletherapyUnit.jpg|thumb|right|U of S Cobalt Therapy Unit]]
Another section of land, west of the Preston Avenue/Circle Drive interchange and north of the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|CPR]] line, was zoned for commercial use, and led to &quot;big box&quot; retail development in the early 2000s called [[Preston Crossing (Saskatoon)|Preston Crossing]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

The U of S now maintains a large tract of land immediately east of the Saskatoon city limits that it obtained after the city annexed the northeastern section of U of S land. The U of S leased a site to the [[Correctional Service of Canada]] north of Attridge Drive on Central Avenue for the Regional Psychiatric Centre. It has an additional undeveloped parcel of land at Central Avenue and Fedoruk Drive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

In the 1970s and again in the 1980s, the U of S considered opening up some of its land holdings south of College Drive and north of 14th Street for residential development, but opposition from nearby neighbourhoods that appreciated the &quot;green belt&quot; offered by the university led to these plans being dropped. {{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}

A handful of University alumni were invited to a reception for Canadians at [[Buckingham Palace]] ahead of that visit to Saskatoon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usask.ca/alumni/alumnisite/publications/green_white/issues/fall2005/alumnews.php University of Saskatchewan (2005).

Saskatchewan's [[Lieutenant Governor of Saskatchewan|Lieutenant Governors]] have filled the office of '''Visitor to the University of Saskatchewan''' since its establishment.&lt;ref name=&quot;1995act&quot;&gt;[http://www.qp.gov.sk.ca/documents/English/Statutes/Statutes/U6-1.pdf Government of Saskatchewan (2006). The University of Saskatchewan Act, 1995. Regina: The Queen's Printer.]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Lieutenant Governor Sir Richard Lake was famously called upon to assume the visitor's role in the so-called ''Crisis of 1919''. Four senior members of the Board of Governors had been dismissed after three among them abstained from a vote of confidence in university president [[Walter Charles Murray|Walter Murray]]. Murray was under scrutiny for his maintenance of University finances. The public and press clamoured for an explanation, and, in accordance with provincial law, Lake held a series of hearings through the office of the [[Kingâs Bench]]. His findings, delivered in April 1920, vindicated the dismissals, saying they were âregular, proper and in the best interest of the university.â In other words, their acts of disloyalty were enough to cost them their jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scaa.usask.ca/gallery/uofs_events/articles/1919.php University of Saskatchewan Archives. 1919: Crisis.

Certain vice-regal representatives have held teaching and governance positions on campus. Before becoming Lieutenant Governor, [[Gordon Barnhart]] was university secretary and professor in Canadian politics. [[Sylvia Fedoruk]] was university chancellor, professor in oncology and associate member in physics. [[Grant MacEwan]], before becoming Lieutenant Governor of Alberta, was director of the School of Agriculture and professor of animal husbandry at the University of Saskatchewan. Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degrees have been conferred by the university on vice-regal representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usask.ca/archives/history/hondegrees.php University of Saskatchewan Archives (2007).

==University administration==
There are three separate areas of governance at the University of Saskatchewan. Financial, management, as well as administration affairs are handled by the Board of Governors, which comprises 11 members. The University of Saskatchewan liaison between the public and professional sector is dealt with by the university Senate, a body of 100 representatives. Finally, the General Academic Assembly is the university's advisory body wherein, all the faculty members and elected students combine to determine academic policies and direction. In 1995, the General Academic Assembly is represented by elected members to the University of Saskatchewan Council which is made up of a combination of 116 faculty and students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
