{{nihongo|'''Digimon'''|ãã¸ã¢ã³|Dejimon}}, short for {{nihongo|&quot;Digital Monsters&quot;|ãã¸ã¿ã«ã¢ã³ã¹ã¿ã¼|Dejitaru MonsutÄ}}, is a [[Japan]]ese [[media franchise]] encompassing digital toys, [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[video game]]s. The franchise's [[Digimon (creature)|eponymous creatures]] are monsters of various forms living in a &quot;[[Digital World]]&quot;, a [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel universe]] that originated from Earth's various [[Telecommunications network|communication networks]]. 

==History==
{{Expand section|date=May 2010}}

===Conception and creation===
[[Akiyoshi Hongo]] is credited the creator of the ''Digimon'' concept, but he is a mysterious figure and his exact role remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Digimon RPG|url=http://www.gamershell.com/pc/digimon_rpg/|publisher=[[Gamers Hell]]|accessdate=July 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eponymous creatures==
{{Main|Digimon (creature)}}
Digimon hatch from eggs called Digi-Eggs or Digitama. In the [[English language|English]] [[iteration]]s of the franchise there is another type of [[Digi-Eggs|Digi-Egg]] that can be used to digivolve, or transform, Digimon. This second type of Digi-Egg is called a &quot;Digimental&quot; in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. They age via a process called &quot;Digivolution&quot; which changes their appearance and increases their powers. The effect of Digivolution, however, is not permanent in the partner Digimon of the main characters in the anime, and Digimon who have digivolved will most of the time revert back to their previous form after a battle or if they are too weak to continue. Some Digimon act feral. Most, however, possess large amounts of [[intelligence]] and human speech. They are able to digivolve by the use of Digivices that their human partners have. In some cases, as in the first series, the DigiDestined (known as the 'Chosen Children' in the original Japanese) had to find some special items such as crests and tags so the Digimon could digivolve into further stages of evolution known as Ultimate and Mega in the dub.

The first Digimon anime introduces the Digimon [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]]: They age in a similar fashion to real organisms, but do not die under normal circumstances because they are made of reconfigurable data. Any Digimon that receives a fatal wound will dissolve into [[infinitesimal]] bits of data. The data then recomposes itself as a Digi-Egg, which will hatch when rubbed gently, and the Digimon goes through its life cycle again. Digimon who are reincarnated in this way will sometimes retain some or all their memories of their previous life. However, if a Digimon's data is completely destroyed, they will die.

==Virtual pet toy==
{{Main|Digimon virtual pet}}
Digimon started out as a [[digital pet]] called &quot;[[Digimon virtual pet|Digital Monster]]&quot;, similar in style and concept to the [[Tamagotchi]]. It was planned by [[Wiz (company)|Wiz]] and released by [[Bandai]] on June 26, 1997&lt;!--The earliest sources point to this as the date of release in Japan--&gt;. The toy began as the simple concept of a [[Tamagotchi]] mainly for boys. The V-Pet is similar to its predecessors, with the exceptions of being much harder and being able to connect to fight other Digimon v-pets. Every owner would start with a Baby Digimon, train it, evolve it, take care of it, and then have battles with other Digimon owners to see who was stronger. The Digimon pet had several evolution capabilities and abilities too, so many owners had many different Digimon. In December, the second generation of Digital Monster was released, followed by a third edition in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = What Is Digimon?|accessdate = September 5, 2006|url = http://shiningevo.ultmatedigimon.com/wit.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animated series==
On March 6, 1999, the franchise was given an anime as the first of the ''Digimon'' [[Film|movies]] aired in [[theaters]] in Japan. Originally, the ''Digimon Adventure'' movie was supposed to be a short film, but after the storyboard was finished, a request for ''Digimon'' becoming a children's television show was made. On March 7, 1999, they began airing a television counterpart titled ''[[Digimon Adventure]]''.

Further seasons would follow, most of them with their own tie-in movies, and the series was dubbed for release in western markets in the fall of the same year. The show spawned card games, with ''Hyper Colosseum'' in Japan and later ''Digi-Battle'' in America, and more video games. The animated series is easily the best-known segment of the Digimon universe and responsible for the majority of its popularity.

&quot;Digimon&quot; are &quot;[[Digital]] [[Monster]]s&quot;. According to the stories, they are inhabitants of the &quot;[[Digital World]]&quot;, a manifestation of Earth's communication network. The stories tell of a group of mostly pre-[[teen]]s,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tv.com/shows/digimon-digital-monsters/&lt;/ref&gt; the &quot;Chosen Children&quot; ''([[DigiDestined]] in the English version)'', who accompany special Digimon born to defend their world (and ours) from various evil forces. To help them surmount the most difficult obstacles found within both realms, the Digimon have the ability to evolve ''([[Digivolution|Digivolve]])''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/1999/08/29/tv/cover-story-masters-of-the-universe-youth-division.html&lt;/ref&gt; In this process, the Digimon change appearance and become much stronger,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Anime Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=California|isbn=1-933330-10-4|coauthors=McCarthy, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; often changing in personality as well. The group of [[child]]ren who come in contact with the Digital World changes from series to series.

As of 2011, there have been seven series and eight overall seasonsâ ''Digimon Adventure'', the follow-up sequel ''Digimon Adventure 02'', ''Digimon Tamers'', ''Digimon Frontier'', ''Digimon Savers,'' ''Digimon Xros Wars'' and its sequel, ''Digimon Xros Wars: Time Traveling Hunter Boys''. The first two series take place in the same fictional universe, but the third, fourth, fifth and sixth each occupy their own unique world (in the case of ''Digimon Tamers'', the ''Adventure'' universe is referred to as a television and commercial enterprise, as well as the appearance of [[Ryo Akiyama|one character]] hailing from the ''Adventure'' universe). In addition, each series has spawned assorted feature films. Digimon still shows popularity, as new card series, video games, and movies are still being produced and released: new card series include Eternal Courage, Hybrid Warriors, Generations, and Operation X; the video game, [[Digimon Rumble Arena 2]]; and the previously unreleased movies ''[[Digimon Adventure 02#Revenge of Diaboromon|Revenge of Diablomon]]'', ''[[Digimon Tamers#Runaway Locomon|Runaway Locomon]]'', ''[[Digimon Tamers#Battle of Adventurers|Battle of Adventurers]]'', and ''[[Digimon_Frontier#Island of Lost Digimon|Island of Lost Digimon]]''. In Japan, ''[[Digital Monster X-Evolution]]'', the eighth TV movie, was {{when|date=April 2011}} released, and on December 23, 2005 at [[Jump Festa]] 2006, the fifth series, ''[[Digimon Savers]]'' was announced for Japan to begin airing after a three-year [[hiatus (television)|hiatus]] of the show. A sixth television series, ''Digimon Xros Wars'', began airing in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-02/new-digital-monsters/digimon-tv-anime-listed New Digital Monsters/Digimon TV Anime Listed - Anime News Network]&lt;/ref&gt; and a seventh television series, which started on October 2, 2011 as a direct sequel to ''Digimon Xros Wars''.

''Digimon'' was produced by [[Toei Animation]] and Bandai of Japan. The series were broadcast in Japan by [[Fuji Television]]. The first four series were called ''Digimon: Digital Monsters'' in international markets, while ''Savers'' was released as ''Digimon Data Squad''.

===''Digimon Adventure'' (Series One)===
{{Main|Digimon Adventure}}
The first Digimon television series, which began airing on March 7, 1999 in Japan on [[Fuji Television|Fuji TV]] and [[Kids Station]] and on August 14, 1999 in the United States on [[Fox Kids]] dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] for the North American English version. Its premise is a group of seven kids who, while at summer camp, travel to the Digital World,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Anime Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=California|isbn=1-933330-10-4|coauthors=McCarthy, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt; inhabited by creatures known as Digimon, where they become the DigiDestined and are forced to save both the Digital and Real World from evil. Each Kid was given a Digivice which selected them to be transported to the Digital World and was destined to be paired up with a [[Chosen Digimon|Digimon Partner]], such as Tai being paired up with [[Agumon]] and Matt with [[Gabumon]]. The children are helped by a mysterious man/digimon named Gennai, who helps them via hologram. The Digivices help their Digimon allies to Digivolve into stronger creatures in times of peril. The Digimon usually reached higher forms when their human partners are placed in dangerous situations, such as fighting the evil forces of Devimon, Etemon and Myotismon in their Champion forms. Later, each character discovered a crest that each belonged to a person; Tai the Crest of Courage, Matt the Crest of Friendship, Sora the Crest of Love, Izzy the Crest of Knowledge, Mimi the Crest of Sincerity, Joe the Crest of Reliability, T.K. the Crest of Hope, and later Kari the Crest of Light which allowed their digimon the digivolve into their Ultimate form. The group consisted of seven original characters: [[Taichi &quot;Tai&quot; Kamiya]], [[Yamato &quot;Matt&quot; Ishida]], [[Sora Takenouchi]], [[Koushiro &quot;Izzy&quot; Izumi]], [[Mimi Tachikawa]], [[Joe Kido]], and [[Takeru &quot;T.K.&quot; Takaishi]]. Later on in the series, an eighth character was introduced: [[Hikari &quot;Kari&quot; Kamiya]] (who is Taichi's younger sister).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Clements|first=Jonathan|title=The Anime Encyclopedia|year=2006|publisher=Stone Bridge Press|location=California|isbn=1-933330-10-4|coauthors=McCarthy, Helen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Digimon Adventure 02'' (Series Two)===
{{Main|Digimon Adventure 02}}
The second Digimon series is direct continuation of the first one, and began airing on April 2, 2000. Three years later, with most of the original DigiDestined now in high school at age fourteen, the Digital World was supposedly secure and peaceful. However, a new evil has appeared in the form of the Digimon Emperor (Digimon Kaiser) who as opposed to previous enemies is a human just like the DigiDestined. The Digimon Emperor has been enslaving Digimon with Black Rings and Control Spires and has somehow made regular Digivolution impossible. However, five set Digi-Eggs with engraved emblems had been appointed to three new DigiDestined along with T.K. and Kari, two of the DigiDestined from the previous series. This new evolutionary process, dubbed Armor Digivolution, helps the new DigiDestined to defeat evil lurking in the Digital World. Eventually, the DigiDestined defeat the Digimon Emperor, more commonly known as [[Ken Ichijouji]] on Earth, (who is more or less a rival to Davis) only with the great sacrifice of Ken's own Digimon, Wormmon. Just when things were thought to be settled, new Digimon enemies made from the deactivated Control Spires start to appear and cause trouble in the Digital World. To atone for his past mistakes, Ken joins the DigiDestined, being a DigiDestined himself, with his Partner [[Wormmon]] revived to fight against them. They soon save countries including France and Australia from control spires and defeat MaloMyotismon (BelialVamdemon), the digivolved form of Myotismon (Vamdemon) from the previous series.

===''Digimon Tamers'' (Series Three)===
{{Main|Digimon Tamers}}
The third Digimon series, which began airing on April 1, 2001, is set largely in a &quot;real world&quot; where the ''Adventure'' and ''Adventure 02'' series are television shows, and where Digimon game merchandise (based on actual items) become key to provide power boosts to real Digimon which appeared in that world. The plot revolves around three Tamers, [[Takato Matsuki]], [[Rika Nonaka]], and [[Henry Wong]]. It began with Takato making his very own Digimon by sliding a mysterious blue card on his card reader, which then became a [[Digivice|D-Power]]. [[Guilmon]] took form from Takatoâs sketchings of a new Digimon. (''Tamers''â only human connection to the ''Adventure'' series is [[Ryo Akiyama]], a character featured in some of the Digimon video games and who made an appearance in some occasions of the ''Adventure'' story-line.) Some of the changes in this series include the way the Digimon digivolve, and the way their &quot;Digivices&quot; work. In this series, the Tamers can slide cards through their &quot;Digivices&quot;, which give their digimon certain advantages, such as in a card game. This act is called &quot;Digi-modify&quot; (Card Slash in the Japanese version). The same process was often used to Digivolve the Digimon, but as usual feelings play a big part in the digivolving process. Unlike most Digimon series where the tone is set mostly in a way to appeal to young children, Tamers took a darker tone in nature.

===''Digimon Frontier'' (Series Four)===
{{Main|Digimon Frontier}}
The fourth Digimon series, which began airing on April 7, 2002, radically departs from the previous three by focusing on a new and very different kind of evolution, Spirit Digivolution, in which the human characters use their D-Tectors (this series' Digivice) to transform themselves into special Digimon called [[Legendary Warriors]]. After receiving unusual phone messages, the five main characters go to a subway station and take a train to the Digital World. They end up fighting [[Cherubimon]] and his group of Legendary Warrior servants, hoping to foil his effort to dominate the Digital World. Later on, they face an even greater challenge as they try to stop the [[Royal Knights#Digimon Frontier|Royal Knights]]â[[Dynasmon]] and [[Crusadermon]]âfrom destroying the Digital World and using its data to revive the original ruler of the Digital World: the tyrannical [[Lucemon]]. In general, ''Frontier'' has a much lighter tone than that of ''Tamers'', reverting back to the style of ''Adventure'' and ''Adventure 02''.

===''Digimon Savers / Data Squad'' (Series Five)===
{{Main|Digimon Data Squad}}
After a three year hiatus, a fifth Digimon series began airing on April 2, 2006. Like ''Frontier'', ''Savers'' has no connection with the previous installments, and also marks a new start for the Digimon franchise, with a drastic change in character designs and story-line, in order to reach a broader audience. The story focus on the challenges faced by the members of D.A.T.S. (&quot;Digital Accident Tactics Squad&quot;), an organization created to conceal the existence of the Digital World and Digimon from the rest of mankind, and solve any Digimon related incidents occurred on Earth in secret. Later the D.A.T.S. team is dragged between a massive conflict between Earth and the Digital World triggered by an ambitious human scientist determined to make use of the Digimon to his own personal gains. The English version was dubbed by [[Studiopolis]] and it premiered on the [[Jetix]] block on [[Toon Disney]] on October 1, 2007. Digivolution in ''Data Squad'' requires the human partner's '''DNA''' (&quot;Digisoul&quot; in the Japanese version) to activate, a strong empathy with their Digimon and a will to succeed. Like previously in Tamers, this plot takes on a dark tone throughout the story.  Because of that, and due to the designs, Studiopolis dubbed the anime on Jetix with far more edits, changes, censorship, and cut footage. This included giving the Japanese characters full Americanized names and American surnames as well as applying far more Americanization, cultural streamlining and more edits to their version similar to the changes 4Kids often made (such as removal of Japanese text for the purpose of cultural streamlining in which there are more being translated and removed). Despite all that, the setting of the country was still in Japan and the characters were Japanese in the dub. This series was the first to show any Japanese cultural concepts that were unfamiliar with American audiences (such as the manju), which left out unedited and used in the English dub.  Well Go USA  released it on DVD instead of Disney.

===''Digimon Xros Wars'' (Series Six)===
{{Main|Digimon Xros Wars}}
Three and a quarter years after the end of the fifth season, a new sixth series was confirmed by [[Bandai]] for the Digimon anime, its official name of the series revealed in the June issue of Shueisha's V Jump magazine. It began airing in Japan on TV Asahi from July 6, 2010 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-02/new-digital-monsters/digimon-tv-anime-listed|title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon Anime TV Listed|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-04-02|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-05/new-digital-monsters/digimon-tv-anime-image-posted|title=New Digital Monsters/Digimon TV Anime's Image Posted|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=2010-04-05|accessdate=2010-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reverting back to a style in character designs similar to the first four seasons as well as the plot taking on the younger, lighter tone present in series one, two and four throughout the story, and the anime being targeted at young chidren aged six to ten years, the story follows a boy named [[Taiki Kudou]] who, along with his friends, ends up in the Digital World where they meet Shoutmon and his digimon friends. Wielding a digivice known as a Xros Loader, Taiki is able to combine multiple digimon into a more powerful one using a technique known as 'DigiXros'. Forming Team Xros Heart, Taiki, Shoutmon and their friends travel through the Digital World to liberate it from the evil Bagra Army, led by Bagramon.

The second arc of the sixth series was titled {{nihongo|''The Evil Death Generals and the Seven Kingdoms''|æªã®ãã¹ã¸ã§ãã©ã«ã¨ä¸ã¤ã®çå½|Aku no Desu Jeneraru to Nanatsu no Åkoku}}. It saw the main cast reshuffled with a new wardrobe, as Akari and Zenjiro stayed behind in the Human World; as a result, Taiki, Kiriha and Nene became the lead protagonists as they set off to face the 7 Death Generals of the Bagura Army. A new evolution known as ''Chou Shinka'' (also known as Super Digivolution) was introduced at the end of the first arc.

On August 17, 2011, [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[V-Jump]]'' magazine announced a sequel set one year later, a second season entitled {{nihongo|''Digimon Xros Wars: Time Traveling Hunter Boys''|ãã¸ã¢ã³ã¯ã­ã¹ã¦ã©ã¼ãº æãé§ããå°å¹´ãã³ã¿ã¼ãã¡|Dejimon Kurosu WÅzu: Toki o Kakeru ShÅnen Hanta-tachi}} which began airing from October 2, 2011, following on from the previous arc. It focuses on a new protagonist, Tagiru Akashi and his partner Gumdramon who embark on a new journey with an older Taiki, his Shoutmon, an older Yuu and his Damemon, along with other new comrades as they deal with a hidden dimension that appears between the human and Digital worlds called DigiQuartz.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2011-08-17/digimon-xros-wars-anime-to-get-2nd-year-this-october&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movies===
There have been nine Digimon movies released in Japan. The first seven were directly connected to their respective anime series; ''[[Digital Monster X-Evolution]]'' originated from the [[Digimon Chronicle]] merchandise line. All movies except ''X-Evolution'' and ''[[Digimon Data Squad#Film|Ultimate Power! Activate Burst Mode]]'' have been released and distributed internationally. &lt;!--The Savers movie is not considered canon to the fifth show's plotline.--&gt; ''[[Digimon: The Movie]]'', released in the U.S. and Canada territory by Fox Kids on October 6, 2000, consists of the union of the first three Japanese movies.

===Versions outside Japan===
In the United States, the series premiered in August 1999 on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Television Network]]. It was dubbed by [[Saban Entertainment]] (later [[Sensation Animation]]), and was initially broadcasted through Fox Network's [[Fox Kids]] and [[ABC Family|Fox Family]]. The first four series were collectively retitled '''''Digimon: Digital Monsters'''''. Some scenes from the original version were omitted from the Saban dub, or were modified, in order to comply with Fox's [[Standards and practices]] which considered several scenes to be inappropriate for the target age group. Often dialogue was changed, and the show became less &quot;Serious&quot; in tone compared to the Japanese version, instead featuring more jokes and added dialogue, along with a completely different musical score (usually orchestral music) and completely different sound effects, due to licensing issues. Another noticeable change in the dub is using different voice actors for different forms of a certain Digimon, whereas in Japan, the voice actor merely changes the tone of his/her voice, sometimes being altered for effect. The latter often results in a high-pitched childish voice for an otherwise monstrous or masculine form.

After [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] acquired Saban during the third series, the first three series moved to the [[cable network]] [[ABC Family]], while the fourth (''Frontier'') premiered on [[UPN]]. This was due to a deal between Disney and UPN which concluded with ''Digimon Frontier''. ''Frontier'' was syndicated on [[ABC Family]] shortly after that. ''Digimon'' continues to run in syndication on the new channel after Toon Disney, [[Disney XD (United States)|Disney XD]]. [[Digimon Savers|Digimon Data Squad]] has now started to air on Disney XD.

In Canada, the Saban version was broadcast on [[YTV (Canadian television)|YTV]]. In the U.S. [[insular area]] of [[Puerto Rico]], the show was redubbed in Spanish, and in Quebec (where ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' aired on [[TQS]], and ''[[Digimon 02]]'' on [[TÃLÃTOON (Canada)|TÃLÃTOON]]), the show was redubbed in French. A French version of ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'' was aired in France, but not in North America.

After the overwhelming popularity of [[PokÃ©mon (anime)|PokÃ©mon]] in [[India]] and [[Pakistan]], [[Cartoon Network (India)|Cartoon Network]] started to air Digimon in 2004. Later, all 3 seasons aired(except Xros Wars)The 3rd Season was ended in 2009 .

In the United Kingdom, ''Digimon'' aired on [[Disney XD (UK &amp; Ireland)|Fox Kids]] cable/satellite channel and on [[ITV]]. However, ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' (the fourth series) has not been shown in the UK but the picture in the promo, and the show, including series 1, 2 and 3, has not been seen on UK television since late 2005, when Jetix took it off the air. However [[Digimon Data Squad]] has recently{{when|date=April 2011}} begun airing in the UK on [[Kix (TV channel)|Kix]]. It also aired in countries such as Ireland, South Africa, [[Malaysia]], Australia, [[Mexico]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]] and others.

The [[Latin American]], [[Brazil]]ian, [[Spain|Spanish]], [[Germany|German]] and [[Italy|Italian]] versions of Digimon are completely uncensored and uncut from the original Japanese edition. In [[Latin America]], the first four seasons were aired on ''[[Disney XD (Latin America)|Fox Kids]]'' and later on ''[[Disney XD (Latin America)|Jetix]]'', which also aired the fifth season, ''[[Digimon Data Squad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://anmtvla.com ANIME, MANGA Y TV]&lt;/ref&gt;

This show also aired in the [[Philippines]] in the middle of 2000 on [[ABS-CBN]]. It would air Friday nights at 7:30PM. ABS-CBN hired [[Filipino people|Filipino]] voice actors to dub the show in English. This dubbing is mostly true to the original. Though they used the original Japanese show as the medium for the dub, some of the voices seem to sound like the U.S. version (e.g., Taichi having an adolescent's voice instead of a kid's) or completely original to the dubbing crew (e.g., Gabumon's deep, grumbly voice). The entire first series of ''[[Digimon Adventure]]'' was dubbed in English (in order to compete with the [[4Kids Entertainment|4Kids]] version of ''[[PokÃ©mon (anime)|PokÃ©mon]]'' which aired on the rival network [[GMA 7]] on the same day and time), along with ''[[Digimon Adventure 02]]''. The second series aired on a new Saturday morning block at 10 A.M. two weeks after the first series finale. This series was dubbed in both English and [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], so that it would be compatible with the other shows in the block. [[Cartoon Network Philippines]] began airing ''[[Digimon Tamers]]'' around 2003, then ''[[Digimon Frontier]]'' late in 2004. This time, the show, along with some of the other [[anime]] that aired with it, was dubbed by [[Singapore]]an voice actors. Tamers and Frontier were dubbed in Filipino when both series aired on ABS-CBN on its weekday morning line-up of animated shows (Tamers first followed by Frontier after a few months). ''[[Digimon Savers]]'' began airing in the country on September 8, 2008 and has currently ended. However, in January 2008, [[Hero (TV channel)|Hero]] started to broadcast the Digimon series with [[Digimon Adventure]]. The series which is currently shown on Hero is [[Digimon Savers]] (January 2011)

===Panini===
The European publishing company, [[Panini Comics|Panini]], approached Digimon in different ways in different countries. While Germany created their own adaptations of episodes, the [[United Kingdom|United Kingdom (UK)]] reprinted the Dark Horse titles, then translated some of the German adaptations of ''Adventure 02'' episodes. Eventually the UK comics were given their own original stories, which appeared in both the UK's official ''Digimon Magazine'' and the official UK Fox Kids companion magazine, ''Wickid''. These original stories only roughly followed the [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] of ''Adventure 02''. When the comic switched to the ''Tamers'' series the storylines adhered to continuity more strictly; sometimes it would expand on subject matter not covered by the original Japanese anime (such as [[Mitsuo Yamaki]]'s past) or the English adaptations of the television shows and movies (such as Ryo's story or the movies that remained undubbed until 2005). In a money saving venture, the original stories were later removed from ''Digimon Magazine'', which returned to printing translated German adaptations of ''Tamers'' episodes. Eventually, both magazines were cancelled.
