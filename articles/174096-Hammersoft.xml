'''Windows Messenger''' is a [[client (computing)|client]] by [[Microsoft]] that is included in the [[Windows XP]] [[operating system]]. Designed for use by corporate users as well as home users, it was originally created as a streamlined and integrated version of [[Windows Live Messenger#MSN Messenger|MSN Messenger]]. After its initial release in 2001, it was later upgraded in 2004, when it was made available for [[Windows 2000]] and [[Windows Server 2003]].

Since then, development on Windows Messenger has stopped, with the exception of security updates. It has been superseded by Microsoft's similarly named but separate and newer client, [[Windows Live Messenger]], for connections to the [[.NET Messenger Service]], and by [[Microsoft Lync|Microsoft Lync]] (formerly Microsoft Office Communicator) in corporate environments.

The client is not related to the [[Windows NT]] [[Messenger service]], which was designed for [[local area network]]s.

==Overview==
Windows Messenger was introduced with the release of Windows XP in October 2001, and it is installed and enabled by default. It has a variety of features, such as [[instant messaging]], presence awareness, support for [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP), file transfer, application sharing and [[whiteboarding]]. Later versions added &quot;ink&quot; support and integration with  [[Microsoft Lync Server|Microsoft Lync Server]] (formerly Microsoft Office Communications Server). These features are also exposed for applications to be used through a COM API called the ''Real Time Communications (RTC) Client API''.

The Windows Messenger user interface was devoid of a lot of the clutter seen in its consumer-focused counterparts, [[Windows Live Messenger#MSN Messenger|MSN Messenger]] and [[Windows Live Messenger]]. Winks, nudges, and custom emoticons are all unsupported, and the main user interface is more closely based on the standard Windows XP [[Luna (theme)|Luna]] style.

The software integrates with [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]], [[Microsoft Outlook]], [[Outlook Express]], and the [[Remote Assistance]] feature of Windows XP. Windows Messenger also integrates with [[Windows Media Center|Media Center]] in [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]]. Windows Messenger can communicate with the [[Exchange Server]] 2000 Instant Messaging Service and the [[.NET Messenger Service]].

Development of Windows Messenger was halted after version 5.1 in favor of [[Windows Live Messenger]] and [[Microsoft Lync]]. Plug-ins for Windows Messenger, such as accessing the inbox of a Hotmail account, are no longer available; users are instead encouraged to download Windows Live Messenger or Lync, depending on their needs.
