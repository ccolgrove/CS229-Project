Cliffjumper's bio indicates he compensates for his small size by being the first to rush into any dangerous situation, desiring only to beat up &quot;Decepti-creeps.&quot; Although this trait of his has his fellow Autobots' respect, occasionally it ensnares him into situations he cannot handle. His motto is &quot;Let me at 'em!&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seibertron.com/database/character.php?view=&amp;char_id=18 Cliffjumper (Autobot Mini-Bots, Transformers G1)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper's weapon is his glass gas gun, which fires a gas that turns metal as brittle as glass for a short time. In the episode &quot;Fire In the Sky,&quot; he mentions his gun has a &quot;defrost cycle&quot; to melt ice.

According to original tech spec notes written by [[Bob Budiansky]] found at [[Iacon One]] in 2006 the original name for Cliffjumper was [[Blow-Out]], a name later used for a ''Generation 2'' Autobot.

Hasbro registered the name Cliffjumper for U.S. [[Trademark]] in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seibertron.com/transformers/news/hasbro-registers-names/1668/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marvel Comics ===
Events specific to the Marvel U.K. Transformers comics are in ''italics''.

Cliffjumper appears in the Marvel Transformers comic, where his role is much the same as in the animated series. The earlier comic stories feature Cliffjumper prominently, deploying his 'glass gas' gun against unfortunate Decepticons.

''Cliffjumper works with [[Windcharger]] and [[Gears (Transformers)|Gears]] on the ''Dinobot Hunt'', charged with bringing in the [[Mental illness|mentally incapacitated]] Dinobot [[Sludge (Transformers)|Sludge]]. Unfortunately the party were victims of an ambush set up by [[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]].''

Cliffjumper returns in &quot;Totaled!&quot; to fight alongside hundreds of Autobots and Decepticons against the Underbase-empowered [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]], and was one of the many casualties of his rampage.

=== Animated series ===
Cliffjumper was part of the original Autobot crew of the Ark. When the Autobots and Decepticons were reawakened, Cliffjumper was given the alternate mode of an Earth car. Cliffjumper and [[Hound (Transformers)|Hound]] were sent to scout out the location of the Decepticons. Although ordered not to engage the Decepticons, Cliffjumper took the opportunity to try to shoot [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]], revealing their existence to the Decepticons. Because of this, Hound was blown off the road by [[Laserbeak]] - something that made Cliffjumper regret his impulsiveness. Hound, however, did not blame him, quipping that he was only sorry he missed. 

Cliffjumper's bravery was often a boon to the Autobots - as well as a problem. In the episode &quot;[[Changing Gears]]&quot;, Cliffjumper's rash actions helped the Autobots get past a Decepticon force field and stop their Solar Needle device from destroying the sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/230787/The-Transformers-Changing-Gears/overview | work=The New York Times | title=Error - - New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper's most prominent appearance came in the second season episode &quot;Traitor&quot;, where he developed the belief that [[Mirage (Transformers)|Mirage]] had sold them out to the Decepticons after missing a Decepticon power plant while on patrol. Mirage then devised a scheme to prove he was not a traitor, setting the Decepticons and [[Insecticons]] against each other. However, Cliffjumper had followed him, and misinterpreted his actions. Reporting back to base, Cliffjumper took Prime to see for himself - only to run into an ambush, as Mirage betrayed them. The reason soon became apparent - Mirage had been implanted by one of [[Bombshell (Transformers)|Bombshell]]'s cerebro shells. After the Decepticon plant's destruction, Cliffjumper apologised to Mirage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anime.com/Transformers/ Transformers Season Two Box Set, Part 1 by Brian Cirulnick, February 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] broke off from [[Megatron (Transformers)|Megatron]] and created the [[Combaticons]] in &quot;[[Starscream's Brigade]]&quot;, his first act was to capture the Autobots Cliffjumper and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] during the unveiling of a statue of Optimus Prime. 

During ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]'', Cliffjumper is stationed on Moonbase 1, from which he and [[Jazz (Transformers)|Jazz]] try unsuccessfully to escape when attacked by [[Unicron]]. After their apparent consumption by the planet-eater, they are ultimately saved by [[Witwicky family#Daniel Witwicky|Daniel Witwicky]].

By season 3, Cliffjumper was reduced to a background character, a result of voice actor [[Casey Kasem]]'s objection to the portrayal of Arab characters as stereotypical villains &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ameu.org/page.asp?iid=108&amp;aid=152&amp;pg=6&lt;/ref&gt; and departure from the show.

His last appearance in the original U.S. cartoon was the season 4 episode &quot;The Rebirth - Part 1&quot;.

=== Books ===
Cliffjumper appeared in the following books:
*The 1984 sticker and story book ''[[Return to Cybertron]]'' written by [[Suzanne Weyn]] and published by [[Marvel Books]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~sstoneb/tf/books/sticker/return/return.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1984 sticker and story book ''[[The Revenge of the Decepticons]]'' written by [[Suzanne Weyn]] and published by [[Marvel Books]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~sstoneb/tf/books/sticker/revenge/revenge.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 1985 audio adventure ''[[Laserbeak's Fury]]''. In this story's accompanying book Cliffjumper was depicted in his yellow variant, not his usual red one.
*He was a main character in the 1985 story ''[[Sun Raid]]'', where he was described as a &quot;red truck.&quot;

===Video games===
Cliffjumper is one of eight playable characters in the 1986 [[Commodore 64]] video game ''[[Transformers: The Battle to Save the Earth]]''.

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
When civil war broke out on the planet Cybertron between the Autobots and Decepticons, Cliffjumper joined the Autobot cause. 
When Decepticon Military Operations Commander [[Shockwave (Transformers)|Shockwave]] led a force of Decepticons against the Autobot capitol of Iacon, Cliffjumper was among the Autobots who defended the capitol (Transformers: War Within #3). 

When Decepticon leader Megatron and Autobot leader Optimus Prime disappeared in an accident with a space bridge, the Autobot and Decepticon forces splintered into smaller factions. Cliffjumper stayed with the Autobots under the leadership of [[Prowl (Transformers)|Prowl]]. Learning that the Decepticons were testing a new mobile command base at the Praetorus Wharf, Prowl led Cliffjumper, [[Gears (Transformers)|Gears]], Jazz, [[Skids (Transformers)|Skids]] and [[Sideswipe (Transformers)|Sideswipe]] to investigate. What they discovered was [[Trypticon]]. The giant Decepticon easily routed them, and Prowl's team were only saved by Shockwave's calling him away to battle against the [[Fallen (Transformers)|Fallen]] and [[Chaos Trinity]]. (Transformers: The War Within - The Dark Ages #3). 

Six million years ago, [[Ultra Magnus]] united the Autobot factions and lead them to victory over Decepticons and [[Ultracons]]. Megatron returned to Cybertron in command of the clone forces of the Aerospace Extermination Squadron and took over Cybertron. Cliffjumper was among the Autobots enslaved and forced to labor tunneling into Cybertron's core (Transformers: War Within - The Age of Wrath #2). Eventually Optimus Prime returned to Cybertron and helped free the enslaved Autobots. 

Cliffjumper was among the Autobots who followed Optimus Prime on his mission on board the Ark and crash landed on Earth.
In 1984, when the Ark's computer re-activated, it reformatted Cliffjumper as in the form of an Earth car. Eventually the combined forces of the Autobots on Earth, and their human allies were able to capture the Decepticons. A ship called the Ark II was built to take the Cybertronians back to Cybertron, along with some human companions, but the ship exploded shortly after takeoff. The human allies were killed, but the Cybertronians were lost in the ocean, again in stasis lock. 

Cliffjumper traveled to Cybertron along with Optimus Prime and a number of Autobots when arrested by Ultra Magnus. 

Bumblebee was placed in command of the Autobot supply shuttle Orion, with [[Powerglide (Transformers)|Powerglide]], [[Warpath (Transformers)|Warpath]], [[Seaspray (Transformers)|Seaspray]], [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]], Cliffjumper, Bumper and the [[Powerdashers]] assigned to him. Their mission was to aid the Autobots on Earth. Upon arriving in the Earth system from transwarp space, they witnessed the arrival of [[Sunstorm (Transformers)|Sunstorm]] (Transformers: Generation One III #1). After [[Omega Supreme]] was damaged in the fight with Sunstorm, Cliffjumper was reluctantly assigned the duty of protecting him until he recovered. Dreamwave would go out of business at this point, preventing any further tales of Cliffjumper from being told.

=== Devil's Due Publishing ===
Cliffjumper reappeared in the third G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers crossover series from [[Devil's Due Publishing]] as part of the combined Autobot/G.I. Joe force trying to rescue Optimus Prime.

=== Fun Publications ===
The ''Classics'' storyline by [[Fun Publications]] is set in a sequel to the Marvel Comics story, ignoring the events of the U.K. and ''Generation 2'' comics. It is revealed that Cliffjumper had been in stasis since the attack by the Underbase powered Starscream in the Marvel Comics story, and was only recently revitalized on Cybertron. [[Optimus Prime]] then returns to Earth commanding a small groups of Autobots including Cliffjumper when they learn Megatron has returned. 

In ''[[Crossing Over (Transformers)|Crossing Over]]'' the mysterious [[Skyfall (Transformers)|Skyfall]] allies himself with the Autobots as they investigate a strange energy reading in South America. Cliffjumper is assigned to watch over Skyfall by Optimus Prime. Skyfall, Cliffjumper and the Decepticon Landquake arrive in an underground energon pool together and meet the Autobot [[Breakaway (Transformers)|Breakaway]], who is guarding the pool, but has little memory of why. Together Breakaway, Landquake and Skyfall feel they are somehow connected. Cliffjumper refuses to leave Skyfall as they are sent through a dimensional portal by Breakaway's Caretaker computer to find their &quot;fourth&quot;.

In the ''Transformers: Timelines'' story &quot;[[Shattered Glass (Transformers)|Shattered Glass]]&quot; Cliffjumper is separated in dimensional transit and ends up by himself on a mirror universe Cybertron where the tyrant Optimus Prime and his evil Autobots are opposed by Megatron and the heroic Decepticons. After being shot by Optimus Prime for being a traitor, he is recovered by the Decepticons and joins their cause. He and his glass gas is key to the destruction of the launch pad to the Ark - a space ship the Autobots plan to use to conquer Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic |colorist=Espen Grundetjern |date=Botcon 2008 |editor=Pete Sinclair &amp; Brian Savage |inker=[[Don Figueroa]] |issue=3 |letterer=Jesse Wittenrich |penciller=Don Figueroa |publisher=Fun Publications |story=Shattered Glass |title=Transformers Timelines |volume=2 |writer=Pete Sinclair &amp; Benson Yee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper appears in the fiction ''[[Dungeons &amp; Dinobots]]'', a text based story. He defends the [[Arch-Ayr]] fuel dump with the Decepticons from an Autobot attack. He later captures the Dinobots [[Slugfest (Transformers)|Slugfest]] and [[Goryu]] for the Decepticons to reprogram as Dinocons. Cliffjumper, Sideswipe, Blurr and Rodimus then track Grimlock through a maze of traps and discover the [[Omega Terminus]]. A trap separates him with Sideswipe, leaving him to survive with Rodimus. Cliffjumper refuses to be part of Rodimus' plan to use the Terminus to create an army to take over Cybertron. After a run-in with Grimlock and zombified versions of Cliffjumper's evil counterpart and Sideswipe's old commander Drench, they escape the maze. 

Cliffjumper appears in the story ''[[Do Over (Transformers)|Do Over]]''. When Megatron is captured by the Autobot Targetmasters led by Ricochet, it is Cliffjumper who warns Starscream not to send a large force to rescue him, but instead send a small group of [[Micromasters]]. He is among the crew of the [[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]], which follows the Autobot's [[Ark (Transformers)|Ark]] to Earth before being shot down by human defenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[S. Trent Troop]] and [[Greg Sepelak]]|title=Do Over |publisher=[[Fun Publications]]|others= Illustrator [[Yuki Oshima]]|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliffjumper appears in ''[[Eye in the Sky]]''. After meeting the Decepticons new human allies Cliffjumper warns that the Autobots probably survived the crash to Earth. He helps recover the stasis pod of Crasher and gets her back online. Cliffjumper, Crasher, Frenzy, Heatwave, Ravage and Soundwave are sent on a mission to [[Burpleson Air Force Base]] to stop the Autobots from controlling the Global Orbital Defense System. Heatwave uses his powers to convince the GODS transmitter to fire the weapon on itself and stop the Autobots from taking control.

Cliffjumper appears in ''Reunification'' having returned to Cybertron where he was reunited with Landquake, Skyfall and Breakaway just before [[Cyclonus]] attempts to kill Megatron at the command of [[Alpha Trion]].

=== IDW Publishing ===
Cliffjumper made his first [[IDW Publishing]] appearance in issue #3 of ''[[The Transformers: Megatron Origin]]'', mourning [[Bumper (Transformers)|Bumper]] alongside Bumblebee and [[Hubcap (Transformers)|Hubcap]]. 

When he next appears in Spotlight: Cliffjumper, he successfully engages an entire platoon of Decepticons single handed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Transformers Spotlight: Cliffjumper|publisher= Comic Bulletin|date=|url= http://www.comicsbulletin.com/reviews/124538492022808.htm|accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Toys ===
*'''''Generation 1'' Mini-Car Cliffjumper''' (1984)
:One of the retroactively-called 'Pre-Transformer' toys, the Cliffjumper mold was originally designed and released in 1983 in Japan by [[Takara]] as part of the [[Micro Change]] subset of their [[Microman]] line.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Totally Tubular '80s | last=Bellomo | first=Mark | year=2010 | publisher=Krause Publications| ISBN=1440212821 | pages=112, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt; The toy was designated simply `1981 'Porsche 924' (MC-01). Its &quot;stubby&quot; vehicle mode proportions were designed to resemble Takara's [[Choro-Q]] toyline ([[Penny Racer]]s in the US). Following Hasbro's licencing of Takara toys for sale in the US, 'Cliffjumper' was released with the first wave of Transformers in 1984. A second side effect of the use of Takara overstock was that of a similar MicroChange mold (MC-02 Mazda Familia 1500 XG in yellow) being placed on Cliffjumper packaging. This toy was sometimes also found on [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]] cards, leading to fans referring to the character as [[Bumblejumper]] (BUMBLEbee + cliffJUMPER). The name was later officially shortened by Transformer fiction to simply [[Bumper (Transformers)|Bumper]]. Cliffjumper was later remolded into the Series 3 mini-bot [[Hubcap (Transformers)|Hubcap]].
:In 1985 a special ''Listen 'N Fun'' edition of Cliffjumper was sold that included a cassette with the audio story ''Sun Raid''.
:Cliffjumper was released under a number of names in different countries ('''Carrera''' in [[Mexico]], '''Cliff''' in [[Japan]], '''Matamore''' in [[Canada]], '''Grillo''' in [[Italy]], etc) and was available in a variety of additional colors including blue, green, orange, white, gold, and silver.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tfu.info/1985/Autobot/Carerra/carerra.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The name '''Cliffjumper''' was given to a female [[Mini-Con]] in ''[[Transformers: Armada]]''. She does not appear in any cartoon or comic-book series, although she did receive a biography in the [[Dreamwave Productions|Dreamwave]] ''More Than Meets The Eye'' comics.

Cliffjumper's bio described her as almost the polar opposite of the Generation 1 Cliffjumper - where he was brash and always ready to fight, she is quiet and reserved, seeking an end to the war so she can return to her scientific career. Sadly for her she was stuck with [[Cheetor#Transformers: Armada|Cheetor]], her polar opposite, as a partner. A cocky type always seeking adventure, he often teased her about her name, unaware of the damage it did to her self-esteem. After he was taken as one of [[Unicron#Unicron Trilogy|Unicron]]'s four horsemen, she felt slightly relieved - almost immediately feeling guilty at the mere thought of it.

The name Cliffjumper (Overdrive in Japan) was used again in the ''[[Transformers: Energon]]'' line.

In the ''Transformers: Energon'' animated series, Cliffjumper's name was frequently swapped with fellow Autobot [[Downshift]], as they were originally mistaken for one another when they first appeared. His vehicle mode was a dune racer.

This Cliffjumper is more reminiscent of the original, as he is described as loving high-risk situations, although not the battle fervour of the original. Cliffjumper loves stunt driving, with the more risk and speed involved the better. While he is a skilled warrior, his unnecessary risk-taking has earned him more than one reprimand from [[optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]].&lt;ref&gt;Figure King Magazine #74, June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animated series ===
Cliffjumper appeared in the ''Transformers: Energon'' series as one of the inexperienced soldiers under the command of [[Bulkhead (Transformers)#Transformers: Energon|Bulkhead]] sent into the rift caused by the collision of [[Unicron]]'s head with his body. They eventually succeeded in bringing [[Optimus Prime (Unicron Trilogy)|Optimus Prime]]'s team back to the normal universe. In the final battle, he gave his [[Spark (Transformers)|spark]] energy to empower Optimus Supreme against the Unicron-possessed [[Galvatron#Unicron Trilogy|Galvatron]].

=== Dreamwave Productions ===
Cliffjumper also appeared in the accompanying ''Energon'' comics by [[Dreamwave Productions]]. He originally came to Earth to battle the [[Terrorcon]]s, and became part of the Autobot forces permanently stationed there.

Later, he was knocked out by a surprise attack from [[Tidal Wave (Transformers)|Tidal Wave]], who further threatened his life to get [[Ironhide#Transformers: Energon|Ironhide]] to do what he wanted.

He was part of the Autobot forces in [[Los Angeles]], battling against the horde of [[Insecticons|Insecticon]] clones - until they were surprisingly bailed out by [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]]. Dreamwave's closure prevented this story from ever being completed.

Cliffjumper is the name of a character from the 2007 ''[[Transformers (film)|Transformers]]'' movie [[Transformers: The Movie toy line|toy line]]. 

Cliffjumper is impatient and is considered the opposite of the composed Autobot [[Bumblebee (other incarnations)#Transformers|Bumblebee]]. He'd rather take down a Decepticon by force and then try to get information from their smoldering wreckage than spy on them.&lt;ref&gt;The Reign of Starscream, Page 133 by Chris Mowry, Chris Ryall, Alex Milne, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The Legends 2-pack with Cliffjumper and Recon [[Barricade (Transformers)#Transformers|Barricade]] says that Cliffjumper and Barricade are old rivals. Cliffjumper often taunts Barricade into making mistakes. Most of the time his taunts often lead to victory.

=== IDW Publishing ===
In ''[[Transformers: Defiance]]'' #1 by [[IDW Publishing]], back on ancient Cybertron, Bumblebee and Cliffjumper were tasked to watch over the [[AllSpark#Transformers|All Spark]] at the temple at Simfur. In issue #3, [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers|Megatron]] learns that [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers|Optimus Prime]] has broken into his room so he sends Bumblebee, [[Camshaft (Transformers)#Transformers|Camshaft]], Cliffjumper, [[Jazz (Transformers)#Transformers|Jazz]], [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers|Prowl]] and [[Smokescreen (Transformers)#Transformers|Smokescreen]] to arrest Optimus for treason. Optimus demands to speak directly to Megatron, but when the group is traveling to Megatron's location, they are ambushed by [[Barricade (Transformers)#Transformers|Barricade]], [[Brawl (Transformers)#Transformers|Brawl]], [[Crankcase (Transformers)#Transformers|Crankcase]], [[Frenzy (Transformers)#Transformers|Frenzy]], [[Starscream (other incarnations)#Transformers|Starscream]], [[Skywarp#Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen|Skywarp]] and [[Thundercracker#Transformers|Thundercracker]] - who have orders to kill the lot of them. Smokescreen is able to cover Optimus and his group's retreat in the confusion of an explosion. In issue #4 Arcee, Bumbelbee, Cliffjumper, Jazz and Smokescreen ambush Ironhide, who they believed works for Megatron, but Ironhide instead joins Optimus Prime's Autobots.

Cliffjumper is among the Autobot forces who witness the launching of the Decepticon ship Nemesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = [[John Barber]] | penciller = [[Andrew Griffith]] | inker = [[Priscilla Tramontano]] | title = Transformers: Foundation| volume = 1| issue = 3| date = April 2011| publisher = [[IDW Publishing]] | page = 14| panel = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Transformers: The Reign of Starscream]]'', the Decepticon Starscream barely makes it to the ''[[Nemesis (Transformers)|Nemesis]]'' on Mars before he runs out of power. His return is noted by the Autobot [[Cosmos (Transformers)#Transformers|Cosmos]], who alerts [[Arcee#Transformers|Arcee]], Cliffjumper, Smokescreen, Camshaft and [[Air Raid (Transformers)#Transformers|Air Raid]]. Aided by Thundercracker on the ''Nemesis'', Starscream recovers and sends the information on the Allspark Frenzy had gathered back to Cybertron just as Hardtop spots the Autobots closing on the ''Nemesis''. In issue #3, Cliffjumper is shot in the back by Starscream.

*'''''Transformers'' 3D Battle Card Game Cliffjumper''' (2007)
:Cliffjumper is among the characters which appeared in the 1st wave of [[Transformers 3D Battle Card Game]] by [[Wizards of the Coast]]. Unlike most versions of Cliffjumper for the movie, where he is a red repaint of movie 2007 bumblebee. the Cliffjumper card looks nearly identical to Alternators Swerve, with the addition of 2007 movie style exposed facial robotics and joints. His vehicle mode is a [[Chevrolet Corvette C6]]. Oddly, a Swerve card was released, which was a red redeco of Bumblebee - leading some to think their cards were swapped.

:A red repaint of Legends Bumblebee, which transforms into a Classic Camaro. Available in a 2-pack with Movie Legends Recon Barricade.

*'''''Transformers'' Cyber Slammers Cliffjumper''' (2007)
:A red repaint of movie Concept Camaro Bumblebee.

*'''''Transformers'' Deluxe Class Cliffjumper''' (2008)
:A red repaint of Concept Camaro Bumblebee. This Deluxe toy features Automorph technology and a complex transformation. Comes with a laser cannon that opens to become a clear blue blade. This toy is about 14 centimeters long in vehicle mode. With a real Concept Camaro being 473 centimeters long this toy has a scale of about 1/34. With the toy standing 16 centimeters tall in robot mode, the real robot would stand about 18 feet tall. Curiously, the toy has been misprinted on promotional images: it depicts Cliffjumper with splodges of All Spark blue on his thighs, when there is none there. Also, it has something similar to Bumblebee: the front end of his feet are black; however, there is no black. Like Megatron, the promo images have errors overall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=News/Item&amp;newsid=5D9D9C04-D56F-E112-439E9813AA28B47F transformers-fr_FR - default&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his temper, Cliffjumper has never been much of a spy. Even though he works in Intelligence, he does not interact much with the enemy. Instead, he collects information from field agents and finds the important bits for his superiors. Of course, knowing everything there is to know about the Decepticons makes him a little tense, which is why he's always ready for a fight.

=== Animated series ===
In the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' episode &quot;Autoboot Camp&quot;, an Autobot similar in appearance to [[Bumblebee (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Bumblebee]], but taller, and with longer horns and a red and gray color scheme, is featured. Although not named, series artist [[Derrick J. Wyatt]] confirmed that the character is Cliffjumper.

He makes a reappearance in the season 3 opener, &quot;Transwarped&quot;, where he gets to speak.  He speaks when telling [[Longarm (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Longarm Prime]]/[[Shockwave (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Shockwave]] that, per Ultra Magnus's orders, the Space Bridge Nexus is to be shut down due to the Decepticons trying to transwarp to Cybertron. He then appears outside Longarm/Shockwave's office, told by Longarm to dispose of a cube that was once [[Blurr#Transformers Animated|Blurr]], being told it was &quot;sensitive materials.&quot;

Cliffjumper appeared again in &quot;Five Servos of Doom&quot; where he is contacted by [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Optimus Prime]], [[Sentinel Prime#Transformers Animated|Sentinel Prime]], [[Jetfire#Transformers Animated|Jetfire]], and [[Jetstorm#Transformers Animated|Jetstorm]]. He told the Earth bound Autobots that about &quot;50 megacycles ago, [[Ultra Magnus (other incarnations)#Transformers Animated|Ultra Magnus]] was attacked by  the Decepticon traitor Shockwave.&quot; He then goes on to say that Ultra Magnus is &quot;... in recovery, but Shockwave got away with his Magnus hammer and did a number on the communications systems.&quot; He then gets told that [[Prowl (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Prowl]] has captured many of [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers Animated|Megatron's]] top soldiers.  He later appears alongside Alpha Trion and Preceptor in a transmission to Sentinel Prime concerning the laters return to Cybertron.  Cliffjumper taunts Sentinel by saying that &quot;he thought it was Prowl&quot; when Sentinel attempts to take credit for capturing Megatron's soldiers. He was also seen in &quot;Endgame Part 2&quot; when Optimus Prime and his team captured Megatron, Shockwave, and Lugnut.

===Animated series===

Cliffjumper first appears in the first two episodes of the 5-part mini-series ''Darkness Rising.'' Outside of Jasper, Nevada, Cliffjumper tells [[Arcee#Transformers: Prime|Arcee]] how he got a [[Wheel clamp|boot]] from human police officers for being parked illegally, and scared the officers by kicking it off and driving by. He soon discovers a deposit of Energon and is attacked by Vehicons, destroying the Energon during the one-sided fight before being captured. He is taken before [[Starscream (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Starscream]], who fatally stabs the Autobot in the chest when Cliffjumper asks where Starscream's master is. Cliffjumper's lifeless body is later used by [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers: Prime|Megatron]] to test the Dark Energon he obtained, reanimating the Autobot into a mindless beast before being sliced in half and later falling to his death.&lt;ref&gt;Transformers Prime episodes #1 and 2 &quot;Darkness Rising Parts 1 and 2&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Predatory'', Airachnid mentoined to Arcee the deaths of Cliffjumper and Tailgate, whom were both her partners and suggested Arcee was the reason they died. Also Cliffjumper is seen in one of the flashback's rescuing Arcee with Bumblebee as they saved her from Airachnid on Cybertron. In ''Partners'', Arcee discovers that it was Starscream who killed Cliffjumper, and attempts to take revenge by forcing Starscream into a fight despite his surrender. In ''Stronger, Faster'', Cliffjumper was mentioned by Ratchet, as he blamed Optimus's beliefs in protecting humanity for causing Cliffjumper's demise, infuriating Arcee.
