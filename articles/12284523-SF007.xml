'''BadVista''' was a campaign by the [[Free Software Foundation]] to oppose adoption of [[Microsoft]] [[Windows Vista]] and promote [[free software]] alternatives. A follow-up to the [[Defective by Design]] campaign against [[digital rights management]] technologies, it aimed to encourage the media to make free software part of their agenda.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linux Journal&quot;&gt;{{cite news

BadVista activists teamed up with [[Defective by Design]] members on a Vista launch party on January 30, 2007 at the [[Times Square]]. Protesters in hazmat suits held their signs explaining the restrictions Vista may impose on computer users.&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.boingboing.net/2007/01/29/defective-by-design-.html | title = Defective by Design pickets Vista launch in NYC | date = January 29, 2007 | publisher = boingboing.net | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;New York Vista launch party&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://badvista.fsf.org/blog/a-badvista-at-microsofts-new-york-launch-parties | title = A BadVista at Microsoft's New York launch parties | author = John Sullivan | date = January 30, 2007 | publisher = BadVista.org | accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://zedomax.com/blog/2008/05/25/are-you-being-naughty-microsoft-bad-vista-accounting/ | title = Are you being naughty Microsoft? - Bad Vista Accounting | date = Sunday, May 25, 2008 | publisher = zedomax.com | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://linmagazine.co.il/node/view/34012 | title = ×××©×§× '×××¡××'. ××××. | date = 2007-01-30 | publisher = linmagazine.co.il | accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The campaign ended on January 8, 2009, when &quot;victory&quot; was declared after Microsoft released its [[Windows 7]] [[Beta software|Beta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This victory claim was based on the tepid adoption of Vista, compared to those sticking with the less-[[Digital Rights Management|DRM]] infused [[Windows XP]] or moving to the FSF-defined less restrictive [[Mac OS X]] or entirely free [[GNU/Linux]] or [[FreeBSD]].

===Windows 7 Sins===
A new campaign, this time targeted towards [[Windows 7]], has been launched under the name &quot;Windows 7 Sins&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9137119/Free_software_group_attacks_Windows_7_sins_ Free software group attacks Windows 7 'sins'] ''COMPUTERWORLD'', August 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The site uses graphics from the [[open source video game|free software video game]] [[XBill]].
