[[Dell|Dell's]] '''Studio''' [[brand]] is a range of [[laptop]]s and [[Desktop computer|desktop]]s targeted at the mainstream consumer market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gadgetvenue.com/dell-studio-laptop-launched-06302234/ Dell Studio Laptop Launched&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The computers sit above Dell's [[Dell Inspiron|Inspiron]] and below the [[Dell XPS|XPS]] consumer lines in price and specifications. They differ from Dell's lower-end Inspiron models by offering [[slot-loading]] [[optical drive]]s, media keys, more cover design options, faster processor options, HDMI and eSATA ports, LED-backlit screens, and backlit keyboards. 

At launch, the Studio was offered in three models: the Studio 15 and the Studio 17 named after their respective screen size in inches, and the Studio Hybrid, named for its usage of laptop components in the form of an ultra small form factor desktop. If purchased online, many customizable colors, designs and features are available, including a finger print scanner in some countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dell.com/content/topics/global.aspx/corp/pressoffice/en/2008/2008_06_26_rr_000?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=corp Dellâs New âStudioâ Brand: Designed for the Creative Spark in All of Us&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 29, 2008, Dell introduced the desktop counterpart to the Dell Studio Laptops, the Dell Studio Hybrid PC. A compact desktop PC using laptop components, it contains the same [[slot-loading]] optical drive as the laptops with the range of connectivity (e.g., number of [[USB]] ports) expected of a desktop PC.

On September 24, 2009, Dell released Studio laptops with the options for a mobile [[Core i7]] processor, although [[Pentium Dual-Core]] and [[Core 2 Duo]] options were still available as lower-end options.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/us/en/home/core_i7_systems/fs.aspx?refid=core_i7_systems&amp;s=dhs&amp;cs=19&lt;/ref&gt;

At midnight on June 18, 2010 Dell's website stopped selling the Studio Hybrid.

As of May 2011, Dell has discontinued the Studio line of notebooks (XPS and desktops continue on). &lt;ref&gt;http://search.dell.com/results.aspx?c=us&amp;l=en&amp;s=dhs&amp;cat=prod&amp;cs=19&amp;k=studio+laptop&amp;rpp=12&amp;p=1&amp;rf=all&amp;nk=f&amp;sort=K&amp;ira=False&amp;~srd=False&amp;ipsys=False&amp;advsrch=False&amp;~ck=related&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studio XPS 13===
{{See also|Dell_XPS#Studio_XPS_13_.28M1340.29|l1=Dell XPS}}
A 13.3&quot; laptop that offers a Studio-XPS crossover. Runs on DDR3 memory and uses Intel Core 2 Duo processors &lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/us/en/home/notebooks/laptop-studio-xps-13/pd.aspx?refid=laptop-studio-xps-13&amp;cs=19&amp;s=dhs&lt;/ref&gt;. When launched, the Studio XPS 13 was widely acclaimed as a the ultimate notebook, offering an irresistible combination of technology, cutting-edge design, performance and luxury style in the increasingly popular market for lighter notebooks. All of its attributes, and its wide success, made it all the more astonishing, if not suspicious, when Dell abruptly discontinued the Studio XPS 13 model, less than a year after its launch, leaving many would-be owners holding their credit cards, and many current owners on guard watching their prized possessions. The wait wasn't long &lt;ref&gt;http://forum.notebookreview.com/dell-xps-studio-xps/348918-dell-studio-xps-13-horror-thread.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The latent technical problems, stemming from the notebook's relatively small shell packing a lot of sophisticated hardware, were numerous. Dell's designers simply attempted to pack too much punch into the 13&amp;nbsp;inch model. In the arena of the lightweight notebooks even one inch can make a difference and sacrifices must be made.&lt;ref&gt;http://pcworld.about.com/od/thinandlightnotebooks/ThinandLight_Notebooks.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Among the widely reported issues is the overheating in the area of the vent and the video card, whereby the heat spreads to the palm rests and the bottom of the screen &lt;ref&gt;http://forum.notebookreview.com/dell-xps-studio-xps/430026-xps16-hard-drive-failure-dell-design-defect-excess-heat-vulnerable-hd-destroy-hard-drive.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The more serious issue is with the slot loading optical drive. The device simply does not fit properly into the 13&amp;nbsp;inch shell. Yet as a result of the model's abrupt discontinuance, users who were in the market for a light-weight Studio XPS 13 model are left with few alternatives, if any. In fact, the only suitable replacement currently on the market is the Studio XPS 16.

===Studio XPS 16===
A larger version of the Studio XPS 13 (16&quot;). It offers an optional [[Blu-Ray]] optical drive, and has an RGBLED 1080p full HD display (1920Ã1080p) which was widely considered the best display on any laptop in the market&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anandtech.com/mobile/showdoc.aspx?i=3540&lt;/ref&gt; and comes with a 1&amp;nbsp;GB Mobility Radeon HD 4670, and is now available with an Intel Core i7 processor or an optional 1&amp;nbsp;GB Mobility Radeon HD 5730.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dell.com/us/en/home/notebooks/laptop-studio-xps-16/pd.aspx?refid=laptop-studio-xps-16&amp;cs=19&amp;s=dhs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Desktops==
===Studio Hybrid===
A miniature desktop similar to the [[HP Pavilion (computer)#Current_Desktop_Models|HP Pavilion Slimline]] series of desktops and Apple's [[Mac Mini]]. It is Dell's most energy-efficient desktop. The desktop is named Studio Hybrid because it uses Intel processors made for laptops while offering desktop features.

===Studio and Studio Slim===
Using the same case style as Dell's Inspiron 530 and 530s desktops but with a black color, the Studio and Studio Slim desktops are targeted towards consumers looking for a multimedia entertainment desktop.

===Studio XPS Desktop===
Combining the Studio's design with the XPS' performance, the Studio XPS desktop is a full-fledged multimedia center.

===Studio One 1909 (Studio One 19)===
Released in the [[USA]] on April 28, 2009, the Studio One 19 is a 19&amp;nbsp;inch all-in-one desktop computer. It is a lower-end alternative to Dell's XPS One 20 and 24. The chassis design highly resembles that of Dell's SX2210 21.5&amp;nbsp;in LCD monitor. The chassis can be customized with five different colors. There is also a touch-screen option.

==Issues==
The Studio 15 (older 1535-1537 models) and 17 (1735-1737 models) suffer from problems with the touch sensitive controls where either the eject button or start button for Dell MediaDirect would stay lit for a few minutes after the unit was powered on rendering the rest of the buttons useless.&lt;ref&gt;http://en.community.dell.com/forums/t/19280349.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; However, a firmware update for this media panel posted on the Dell Community forums has been reported to fix this issue.  Another solution for this issue is to power down the laptop and remove the battery, then holding the power button for thirty seconds to fully discharge all remaining electrical power in the system, draining any residual flea power.

Some users have reported graphical problems with the studio 1555 and studio 1557, later found to be a driver mishap.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.notebookforums.com/thread226138.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.techenclave.com/laptops/please-help-dell-studio-1555-problem-145509.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Some users have had problems with the optical drive. This consists of some of the laptops not being able to detect a blank disc or write properly. Nothing currently posted is fixing this issue.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fixya.com/support/t4268356-dvd_writer_not_detecting_disc_not&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://en.community.dell.com/support-forums/laptop/f/3518/p/19304913/19591050.aspx#19591050&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://forum.notebookreview.com/dell-inspiron-dell-studio/432943-dell-studio-1537-dvd-drive-issue.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1557 model is known to have problems with overheating, which is generally linked to 3D video graphics related gaming or other 3D applications. Downloading the latest ATI catalyst drivers and BIOS updates does help reduce the risk of these problems. 
There are also several reports of 1557 models freezing up during booting, or having inaccessible hard drives. No clear cause or fix has been put forward by DELL, but it is also likely linked to overheating related to the built in video card, or software-hardware malfunction related to the built in ST Microelectronics Accelerometer which is supposed to protect the HDD incase the laptop is dropped. One proven method to avoid this problem is to remove the ST Microelectronics drivers, and thus disable the HDD protection function, whilst keeping the BIOS (currently version 9 as of Sept.2011) up to date is said to also reduce the risk. Frozen hard disks however can usually not be fixed by updating the BIOS or removing the ST Microelectronics driver, in these cases usually the HDD has to be replaced. DELL has been criticized by some consumers not to take the overheating and freezing issue seriously, whilst others complain that the repair takes too long (2 weeks) and that the usually adopted fixing method is to remove the old HDD and put in a new one (probably with a factory install image of the operating system) and returning the &quot;fixed&quot; laptop and the original but damaged HDD to the owner.
