'''''The Simpsons''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; sixth season''' originally aired on the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] network between September 4, 1994 and May 21, 1995 and consists of 25 episodes. ''[[The Simpsons]]'' is an animated series about a working class [[Simpson family|family]], which consists of [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], [[Marge Simpson|Marge]], [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]], and [[Maggie Simpson|Maggie]]. The show is set in the fictional city of [[Springfield (The Simpsons)|Springfield]], and lampoons [[Culture of the United States|American culture]], society, television and many aspects of the [[human condition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Simpsons: Culture, Class and Popular TV|author=Flew, Terry|work=Metro|issue=97|date=1994-03-03|url=http://www.metromagazine.com.au/magazine/backisues.asp?keywords=cultu&amp;whichpage=12&amp;pagesize=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The showrunner for the sixth production season was [[David Mirkin]] who executive-produced 23 episodes. Former showrunners [[Al Jean]] and [[Mike Reiss]] produced the remaining two; they produced the two episodes with the staff of ''[[The Critic]]'', the show they left ''The Simpsons'' to create. This was done in order to relieve some of the stress ''The Simpsons''{{'}} writing staff endured, as the felt that producing 25 in one season was too much. The episode &quot;[[A Star Is Burns]]&quot; caused some controversy amongst the staff with [[Matt Groening]] removing his name from the episode's credits as he saw it as blatant advertising for ''[[The Critic]]'', which was airing at the time. Fox moved ''[[The Simpsons]]'' back to its original Sunday night time, having aired on Thursdays for the previous three seasons. It has remained in this slot ever since. The sixth season won one [[Primetime Emmy Award]], and received three additional nominations. It also won the [[Annie Award]] for Best Animated Television Production.

The Complete Sixth Season [[DVD]] was released in the United States on August 16, 2005, September 28, 2005 in Australia, and October 17, 2005 in the United Kingdom. The set featured a plastic &quot;clam-shell&quot; Homer-head design and received many complaints. In the United States, the set contained a slip of paper informing purchasers how to request alternate packaging â which consisted of a case-sleeve in a similar style to the standard box design â for only a shipping &amp; handling fee.
