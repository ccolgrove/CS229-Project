'''Kanotix''', also referred to as '''KANOTIX''', is an [[operating system]] [[Live CD]] based on [[Debian]], with advanced hardware detection.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kanotix.org/index.html Kanotix Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/19794 Thorhammer Beta-Review on tuxmachines.org, July 2007 (author: eco2geek)]&lt;/ref&gt; It can run from an [[optical disc drive]] or other media i.e. [[USB]]-stick without using a [[hard disk drive]].

Kanotix used [[K Desktop Environment 3]] as the default [[desktop environment]]; the current release uses [[KDE4]]. Other [[window manager]]s can be downloaded using [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]]. The name &quot;Kanotix&quot; is derived from the founder's [[nickname]] &quot;Kano&quot;. Kanotix's mascot is a [[fangtooth]].

==Content==
Kanotix is based on the newest Debian stable (the last published version is Kanotix 2011-05 &quot;Hellfire,&quot; based on Debian 6 &quot;Squeeze&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/module-News.html Kanotix &quot;News&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;). It also provides its own packages and scripts and many [[backport]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/files/hellfire/ Kanotix repository]&lt;/ref&gt;
Kanotix also provides an optimized kernel (using [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-recompiled) with additional patches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux-community.de/Internal/Artikel/Print-Artikel/LinuxUser/2010/08/Kanotix-Excalibur-2010-LinuxUser-Edition New article in &quot;LinuxUser&quot; by Kano (German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kanotix includes about 1,000 software packages, including:

* [[KDE Software Compilation 4]], the default desktop environment
* [[Amarok (software)|Amarok]], [[Video Disk Recorder]]
* Internet access software, including KDE [[Network Manager]] replaced [[Wicd]], KPPP dialer, [[Wireless LAN]]-driver (with patched Ubuntu-Kernel) and [[NdisWrapper]]
* [[Iceweasel]]-web browser, [[Icedove]] Mail/News Client, [[Pidgin]] instant messenger
* [[K3b]], for CD (and DVD) authoring and backup
* [[GIMP]], an image-manipulation program
* [[Gparted]] and other tools for data rescue and system repair
* Network analysis and administration tools
* [[LibreOffice]], an office suite
* Programming and development tools
* [[NTFS-3G]] used by default
* Automatic installation of graphic-drivers with [[nvidia]] and [[fglrx]]-scripts with dkms support.
* Scripts for additional multimedia support (current mplayer-versions)
* [[Wine]] (Software) updated to newest versions

==Usage==
Kanotix is designed for multiple-purpose usage so that it can be used in live mode on different types of media ([[CD]] (older versions), [[DVD]], [[hard disk]], and [[USB Flash Drive|USB-stick]]) and includes an installation tool for installing Kanotix to the hard drive. With an improved hardware detection system, Kanotix is an ideal tool for testing, data rescue, or for working and safe surfing and mailing on different machines e.g. in an Internet cafe.

===Live mode===
The live mode allows it to work without any installation. As Kanotix comes with [[unionfs]] and [[aufs]]-support one can &quot;install&quot; additional packages by using APT (via an Internet connection). So a customized live-mode can be used for working. With Kanotix it is also possible to set up a &quot;persistent home directory&quot;, where documents or settings are written to the user's home directory. The data file (kanotix.img) on the hard drive or removable medium, such as a [[USB flash drive]], can be automatically mounted on bootup.
The Kanotix-Thorhammer.iso can be booted with the cheatcode &quot;fromiso=/(path)/&quot; from harddisk, Excalibur by extracting and copying the &quot;live&quot; folder to HD. Using USB flash drive (when supported by BIOS), is of course much faster than booting from CD or DVD.

===Installation===
Kanotix can be installed to the hard disk using the (graphical) acritoxinstaller,&lt;ref&gt;[http://acritox.de/repository acritoxinstaller]&lt;/ref&gt; which, depending on optical drive, hard disk and processor speed, can take around 10 â 20 minutes.
The acritoxinstaller is a KDE/Qt frontend and a bash backend and comes with a user-friendly interface and several advanced features: e.g. LVM support, dmraid support, automatic partitioning (including ntfsresize-support), installation to USB-HDDs.

==Versions==
===History (2003-2006)===
In 2003 JÃ¶rg Schirottke was known with the nickname &quot;Kano&quot; in the former [[Knoppix]]-Forum (no longer available). The distribution derived from &quot;Kano's Scriptpage for Knoppix&quot;. He wrote about Knoppix: &quot;I like it much, but I had to improve it :)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/files/kanotix/ Kano about &quot;Knoppix&quot;]&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main differences from Knoppix was the support of hard disk installation.
The first &quot;Kanotix&quot;-preview was released at 24 December 2003 &quot;KANOTIX XMAS 2003 PREVIEW&quot;.
In 2004 and 2005 KANOTIX was a popular distribution ranking in the top 20 of distrowatch.com.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/index.php?dataspan=2005 Popularity: Ranking in distrowatch year 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=review-kanotix Review &quot;KANOTIX - Putting the Pizzazz on Debian&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 the releases were named &quot;Bug Hunter&quot; (Bug Hunter-01-2004 - X-2004).

After problems with the stability in 2006 JÃ¶rg &quot;Kano&quot; Schirottke decided to move from Debian Sid to a less volatile basis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxmachines.org/node/11481 The KANOTIX distro implodes]&lt;/ref&gt;
The co-developer and other of the Kanotix-Team wanted to stay with Debian-Sid and left the project, to start [[sidux]], a new distribution based on [[Debian#Development versions|Debian sid]]. The last Kanotix release based on Debian Sid was 2006-01-RC4.

===Versions based on Debian stable (2007-current)===
====Kanotix-Thorhammer-Release 2007====
The first Release based on Debian-stable was the Kanotix-Thorhammer in 2007. After the Debian-[[Etch]]-Release in April 2007 Kanotix was no longer compatible with Debian Sid. So a Howto was given, &quot;Steps to update right&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/FAQ-id_cat-146.html Steps to update right (after Thorhammer-Release outdated)]&lt;/ref&gt; to move a KANOTIX-installation to the new base by dist-upgrade.

After 3 months of development and several beta Releases the new ''Kanotix-2007-Thorhammer-RC6''&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/Article229.html Kanotix-2007-ThorhammerRC6 2007-09-15]&lt;/ref&gt; was publicly available for download.
The last published version was ''Kanotix-2007-Thorhammer-RC7''.
The ''development in 2008'' featured continuously kernel-updates and a lot of backports in the Thorhammer-repository.
Some of the additional packages were adaptations for [[netbook]]s and [[notebook computer|notebook]]s. A highlighted additional backport was OpenOffice.org 3.2.x

====Kanotix-Excalibur-2010====

The (old) stable Release 2010 ''Kanotix-Excalibur'' was based on Debian 5 (&quot;Lenny&quot;) and had compared to Thorhammer some basic changes (based on Debian-Live, bootloader [[Grub2]]). Furthermore Kanotix-Excalibur was available for 32-Bit and 64-Bit architecture and a 2in1 iso with both. Additionally there are Kanotix Excalibur 2010 KDE4 (KDE SC 4.3.2) versions available and a &quot;all-in-one&quot;-DVD.iso. Kanotix-Excalibur contains the more up-to-date Ubuntu-kernels 2.6.32-BFS with special patches. During the development most of the Kanotix-Excalibur-test.iso were not published but accessible to the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/PNphpBB2-viewtopic-t-25895.html Hints to Kanotix-Excalibur]&lt;/ref&gt; A first &quot;Preview&quot;-Version was published on December,27 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/Article240.html News about Kanotix-Excalibur Preview]&lt;/ref&gt; The final ''Kanotix-Excalibur-2010'' was released on 8 June 2010, just in time for [[LinuxTag]] 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=06128 Kanotix-Excalibur-Release 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lwn.net/Articles/394186/ Kanotix 2010 review by Susan Linton]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtag.org/2010/en.html Linuxtag 2010, Berlin]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kanotix-Hellfire-2011====

The current version, code-name ''Kanotix-Hellfire'' is based on Debian 6 (&quot;Squeeze&quot;). It ships with [[KDE Software Compilation 4]] for 32-Bit and 64-Bit architecture and a complete new branding stuff, new kernel (2.6.38), LibreOffice 3.3.2 and more.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=06547 Release announcement on &quot;Distrowatch&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
An updated version ''Kanotix-Hellfire 2011-05'' is released with the project's presentation at LinuxTag 2011 in Berlin. &lt;ref&gt;[http://kanotix.com/Article246.html Kanotix-Hellfire 2011-05 release]&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtag.org/2011/en.html LinuxTag 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;
