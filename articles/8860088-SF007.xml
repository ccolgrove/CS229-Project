==Songs==
===Arabian Nights===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aladdin (1992 film)]] --&gt;
&quot;Arabian Nights&quot;, performed by The Peddler ([[Bruce Adler]]), opens the film. Initially a longer composition, Howard Ashman and Alan Menken's 1990 score treatment incorporated several reprises allowing The Peddler to comment on plot developments.

The original lyric ''&quot;Where they cut off your ear/if they don't like your face&quot;'' received complaints from the [[American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee]] (ADC) and other groups upon the film and soundtrack's initial release. A new lyric, ''&quot;Where it's flat and immense/and the heat is intense&quot;'', was recorded for subsequent soundtrack pressings and home video releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1202224,00.html|title=The 25 Most Controversial Movies Ever|publisher=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent line, &quot;''It's barbaric, but hey, it's home,''&quot; was left intact.

An alternate version of the song utilizing lyrics from the original demo was later featured in ''[[The Return of Jafar]]'', performed by [[Brian Hannan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aladdincentral.org/music/englishanroj.html|title=Arabian Nights lyrics from The Return of Jafar|publisher=[http://www.aladdincentral.org Aladdin Central]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was also used as the main titles theme for the [[Aladdin (TV series)|''Aladdin'' television series]].

''[[Aladdin and the King of Thieves]]'' features a reprise performed by Adler originally recorded for the first film.

&quot;Arabian Nights&quot; pops up in the movie's underscore quite often, primarily used as a theme for Jafar.

===One Jump Ahead===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aladdin (1992 film)]] --&gt;
&quot;One Jump Ahead&quot; is sung by [[Aladdin (Disney character)|Aladdin]] ([[Brad Kane]]) while he escapes from the guards carrying a stolen loaf of bread, explaining that this is the life he lives, he has no choice but to steal, much as he does not wish to. It replaced &quot;You Can Count On Me&quot;, a song that would be used to introduce Aladdin but was considered too pokey&lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,312563,00.html |title=Unsettled Score |author=Daly, Steve |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=1992-12-04 |accessdate=2008-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Tim Rice and Alan Menken's biggest inspiration for &quot;One Jump Ahead&quot; was another cut song, &quot;Babkak, Omar, Aladdin, Kassim&quot;, that would feature Aladdin and three friends removed from the film. During the writing, Rice and Menken also came to a [[ballad]] in the same vein, used in a later scene as &quot;One Jump Ahead (Reprise)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Aladdin Platinum Edition'', Disc 2: ''Diamond in the Rough: The Making of Aladdin - The Music''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The reprise, titled, &quot;One Jump Ahead (Reprise)&quot;, is also used in the score as the theme for Aladdin.

A slow version of the song (the reprise, specifically) is heard in the underscore frequently as a theme for Aladdin.

===Friend Like Me===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aladdin (1992 film)]] --&gt;
&quot;Friend Like Me&quot; is sung by the [[Genie (Aladdin)|Genie]] ([[Robin Williams]]) while he shows off his powers to Aladdin in a [[Cab Calloway]]-like musical, telling him that he is a friend unlike any other. It was the first scene in ''Aladdin'' to have its animation finished, and features some differences in character design.&lt;ref&gt;[[Andreas Deja]], [[Will Finn]], [[Eric Goldberg (film director)|Eric Goldberg]] and [[Glen Keane]].''Aladdin'' [[audio commentary]] - ''The Animator's''&lt;/ref&gt; This song was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]]; it was Ashman's last nomination.

During the movie's end credits, an instrumental reprise of the song is featured.

[[Alvin and the Chipmunks]] covered &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; for their 1995 Disney-themed album ''[[When You Wish Upon a Chipmunk]]''.

===Prince Ali===
&quot;Prince Ali&quot; is another flamboyant number sung by the Genie ([[Robin Williams]]) as he introduces Agrabah to Aladdin's royal alter ego, Prince Ali Ababwa with a giant caravan. During the song, Robin Williams imitates a Thanksgiving Parade commentor (&quot;Don't they look lovely, [[June Lockhart|June?]]&quot;), [[Walter Brennan]], and [[Ethel Merman]]. The film version cut a conceived intro for the song and two extra verses in the middle.&lt;ref name=&quot;comm2&quot;&gt;[[Ron Clements]], [[John Musker]], [[Amy Pell]].''Aladdin'' commentary track - ''The Filmmaker's''&lt;/ref&gt;

===A Whole New World===
{{main|A Whole New World}}

===Prince Ali (Reprise)===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Aladdin (1992 film)]] --&gt;
A parody of &quot;Prince Ali&quot; sung by [[Jafar (Aladdin)|Jafar]] ([[Jonathan Freeman (actor)|Jonathan Freeman]]), while the villain uses his newly gained powers to reveal Ali is only a street rat, and sending him to the ends of the earth. The filmmakers liked Jonathan Freeman's singing, and wanted to give Jafar a song of his own, but they rejected Menken and Ashman's original composition for the scene (&quot;Humiliate the Boy&quot;) and a new piece composed by Tim Rice (&quot;Why Me&quot;), as they were too long. Instead, they used a reprise of &quot;Prince Ali.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ew&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;comm2&quot; /&gt;

==Cut Songs==
Howard Ashman and Alan Menken composed several songs for an initial story treatment of Aladdin prior to beginning work on ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]''&lt;ref name=&quot;hochman&quot;&gt;Hochman, Steve (1994). ''The Music Behind the Magic: The Musical Artistry of Alan Menken, Howard Ashman &amp; Tim Rice''. Burbank: Walt Disney Records.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Culhane, John (1992). ''Disney's Aladdin: The Making of an Animated Film'' (1st ed.). New York: Hyperion. ISBN 1-56282-757-X&lt;/ref&gt;. This story treatment incorporated several plot elements from the original folk tale and additional characters that were eliminated during later story development. Three songs from this score - &quot;Arabian Nights,&quot; &quot;Friend Like Me&quot; and &quot;Prince Ali&quot; - survive in the final film.

Menken composed several additional songs for the subsequent story revisions following Ashman's 1991 death, prior to Tim Rice's involvement with the project&lt;ref name=&quot;hochman&quot; /&gt;.

Work tape, demo and master recordings of cut songs have been released in several formats, notably on the 1994 ''[[The Music Behind the Magic]]'' box set&lt;ref name=&quot;hochman&quot; /&gt;, the 2004 special edition soundtrack and the 2004 DVD release of the film&lt;ref name=&quot;ign&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dvd.ign.com/articles/549/549036p1.html|title=Aladdin: Ultimate DVD review|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2004-09-17|accessdate=2007-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==The Score==
Alan Menken's score for ''Aladdin'' follows the compositional method also used in ''[[The Little Mermaid (1989 film)|The Little Mermaid]]'' and ''[[Beauty and the Beast (1991 film)|Beauty and the Beast]]'', with specific cues and motifs derived from the songs' melodies.

*'''Aladdin''''s theme echoes the melody of &quot;One Jump Ahead.&quot; It prominently appears in the score cues &quot;Street Urchins,&quot; &quot;To Be Free&quot; and &quot;Aladdin's Word.&quot;

*'''Jasmine''''s theme is soft and sweet, but also sad-sounding, because she feels trapped. It is introduced in her first scene at the palace.

*The '''Sultan''''s Theme is a royal fanfare, though it sounds fairly goofy, because the Sultan is a silly king to begin with.

*'''Jafar''''s Theme is dark, like he is, an instrumental of &quot;Arabian Nights.&quot;

*'''Genie''''s Theme is &quot;To Be Free.&quot;  It is surprisingly sweet for a comic character, to show that he truly means well and just wants freedom, similar to Jasmine. Although it is associated with Genie in the film, the tune was combined with Jasmine's theme and rewritten for [[Disney's Aladdin: A Musical Spectacular]] as &quot;To Be Free,&quot; Jasmine's song.

When Aladdin and Jasmine are together, it is usually accompanied by &quot;A Whole New World.&quot;
