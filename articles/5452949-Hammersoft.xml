[[File:Dan Ahlquist et al.jpg|thumb|upright=1|right|In 1971 [[hot pants]] and bell-bottomed trousers were popular fashion trends]]

'''1970s fashion''', which began with a continuation of the mini skirts, [[bell-bottoms]] and the [[androgynous]] [[hippie]] look from the late 1960s, was soon sharply characterized by several distinct fashion trends that have left an indelible image of the decade                                                                          commemorated in [[popular culture]]. These include [[platform shoes]] which appeared on the fashion scene in 1971 and often had soles two to four inches thick. These were worn by both men and women. Wide-legged, flared jeans and trousers were another fashion mainstay for both sexes throughout most of the decade, and this style has been                                   immortalised in the 1977 film ''[[Saturday Night Fever]]'', which starred [[John Travolta]]. The &quot;disco look&quot;, complete with three-piece suits for men and [[rayon]] or [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]] [[wrap dress]]es for women, which the film further popularized, lasted until it was gradually replaced by [[punk fashion]] and straight, cigarette-legged jeans. Platform shoes gave way to [[Mule (footwear)|mules]] and ankle-strapped shoes, both reminiscent of the 1940s, at the very end of the decade.

==Early to Mid 1970s==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Skirt and dress]] --&gt;
[[Image:A girl in Kensington.JPG|thumb|upright=1|right|By the early 1970s, [[miniskirts]] had reached an all-time popularity. This young English woman is wearing a fringed suede miniskirt]]
The decade began with a continuation of the hippie look from the [[1960s in fashion|1960s]]. [[Jeans]] remained frayed, and the [[Tie dye]] shirts and Mexican peasant blouses were still popular. In addition to the mini skirt, mid-calf-length dresses called &quot;midis&quot; and ankle-length dresses called &quot;maxis&quot; were also worn in 1970 and 1971, thus offering women three different skirt lengths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www/paperpast.com/html/1970_fashion.html ''Paperpast Yearbook'']&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1971, extremely brief, tight-fitting shorts, called [[hot pants]], were a fashion craze for girls and young women. Throughout the period, trousers for both sexes, though flared at leg bottoms, were very tight and revealing from the lower thighs up. 
[[Image:1974 glam girl.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|This photo taken in 1974, shows a girl inspired by the British [[glam rock]] craze which had a brief influence on fashion. Her [[glitter]]-adorned dress comes from [[Granny Takes a Trip]] boutique]] 

In Britain and the urban United States, from 1972â1974, fashions were inspired by extravagantly-dressed glam rock stars such as [[David Bowie]], [[Roxy Music]], and [[Marc Bolan]].&lt;ref&gt;The Ziggy Stardust Companion: ''Glam Rock'' by Michael Collins, The Independent, 4 May 1997, retrieved on 9 March 2009, [http://www.5years.com/glam.htm 5years.com]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Glitter]] was in vogue. Women wore high-waisted, flared satin trousers or denims, the latter usually decorated with rhinestones, tight lurex halter tops, metallic-coloured lamÃ© and antique velvet dresses, satin hot pants, sequined bra tops, and occasionally they wore ostrich- feather boas draped over their shoulders or turbans on their heads. The 1930s and 1940s look was also popular, and many women bought their clothes at second-hand shops. The short, imitation rabbit-fur jacket was a hot fashion item during this period. Make-up was garish and glittery, with eyebrows thinly plucked. [[Bianca Jagger]], who often used an ebony  walking stick, wore peacock-feathers in her cloche hats, green sequined shoes, transparent blouses, and carried an ivory cigarette- holder, was a fashion icon.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Andersen, ''Jagger Unauthorized'', pgs. 247, 255, 284&lt;/ref&gt; The men often wore lamÃ© suits, silver astronaut-style outfits, satin quilted jackets, wide-legged denims or velvet trousers, and rhinestone-studded shirts. Their hair was long and softly layered, or spiky, multi-coloured [[mullet (hairstyle)|mullets]].
Clothing shops which became associated with glam rock-inspired fashion were [[Biba]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.Vintage-a-Peel.co.uk/dresses/silverbiba.htm Vintage-a-peel.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; in London's [[Kensington High Street]], and [[Granny Takes a Trip]] in [[Kings Road]], which also had a branch in [[West Hollywood]], California. Both shops had opened in the 1960s.
[[Image:Teenage couple 1975.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|Teenage couple in California, 1975. The girl is wearing a [[crop top]] and high-waisted trousers. The boy is dressed in the classic [[t-shirt]] and jeans, popular male attire in the 1970s]]
[[Platform shoes]] with soles two to four inches thick became the style for both men and women. Men's ties broadened and became more colourful, as did dress shirt collars and suit jacket lapels.

Another trend for both sexes was the fitted blazer, which flared slightly at the hip. It came in a variety of fabrics, including wool, velvet, suede, and leather. The buttons were covered and the lapels wide.

The jersey [[wrap dress]], first designed by [[Diane von FÃ¼rstenberg]] in 1972, became an extremely popular item, as it flattered a number of different body types and sizes, and could be worn both to the office, as well as to nightclubs and discos.

For teenage girls and young women the [[crop top]] was often worn, sometimes with a halter neck or else tied in a knot above the midriff.

By the mid-1970s hip-huggers were gone, replaced by the high-waisted jeans and trousers with wide, flared legs. In Britain, they were often referred to as &quot;Loon pants&quot;. These lasted until the end of the decade when the straight, cigarette-leg jeans came into vogue.

In Britain and Ireland, in the early to mid-1970s, there was the [[bootboy]] subculture which influenced youthful male attire with the &quot;parallel jeans&quot;, which were flared jeans that stopped at mid-calf. These were worn with heavy workman's &quot;bovver&quot; boots, braces, (US [[suspenders]]), and denim jackets. Their hair was usually worn longish by the middle of the decade. 

The wrinkled look for women enjoyed a brief vogue in 1975, as did flared denim skirts which ended just below the knee. Trendy colours were dusty rose, Prussian blue, bottle green, rust, and brown.
[[Image:Redhead Beach Bell Bottoms.jpg|thumb|upright=1|left|Flared jeans were worn with [[platform shoes]] in the mid-1970s]] 

Fashion influences were peasant clothing, such as blouses with laces or off-the-shoulder necklines, inspired by those worn in the 17th century. [[Yves Saint-Laurent (designer)|Yves St Laurent]] introduced the peasant look in 1976, and it became very influential. Skirts were gathered into tiers and shoulder lines dropped. Camisoles were worn. Clothing became very unstructured and fluid at this point. Embroidered clothing, either self-made or imported from Mexico or India also enjoyed favour. Floral-patterned prints were in fashion. Fake-flower chokers and hair combs were often worn with the peasant skirts. In 1977, the ruffled [[sundress]] coupled with a tight t-shirt worn underneath enjoyed a brief popularity.&lt;ref name=&quot;paperpast.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.paperpast.com/html/1970_fashion.html ''Paperpast Yearbook'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 1970s==

With the popularization of disco and the increasing availability and diversity man-made fabrics, a drastic change occurred in mainstream fashion, the likes of which had not been seen since the 1920s. All styles of clothing were affected by the disco style, especially those of men. Men began to wear stylish three-piece suits (which became available in a bewildering variety of colours) which were characterized by wide lapels, wide legged or [[bell-bottoms|flared]] trousers, and high-rise waistcoats (US vests). Neckties became wider and bolder, and shirt collars became long and pointed in a style reminiscent of the &quot;Barrymore&quot; collar that had been popular in the 1920s. The zippered [[jumpsuit]] was popular with both men and women, and clothing inspired by modern dance ([[wrap (clothing)|wrap]] skirts and [[wrap dress|dresses]] of rayon or [[jersey (fabric)|jersey]]) also became common. Neck-scarves were also used. Polyester, double knitting, skin-tight [[Spandex]] trousers, [[tube top]]s, and slit skirts were popular for a while at the very end of the decade. In 1978, there was a brief craze for transparent plastic trousers worn with [[leotard]]s underneath. [[Silk]] blouses, [[spaghetti-strapped]] [[tank tops]] and shirt-waist dresses were also worn.  Women's shoes began to echo the 1940s, with high-heeled lower-platform [[Mule (footwear)|mules]]--&quot;Candies&quot; made of molded plastic with a single leather strap over the ball of the foot or &quot;BareTraps&quot; made of wood becoming very popular. With the brief decline of disco late in 1979, these styles (which were by then being criticized as flamboyant) quickly went out of fashion. Designer jeans with straight, cigarette-legs, and painters' pants then started to come into style. 

The top fashion models of the 1970s were [[Lauren Hutton]], [[Margaux Hemingway]], [[Gia Carangi]], [[Janice Dickinson]], [[Cheryl Tiegs]], and [[Jerry Hall]]

==Custom T-Shirts / Baseball Jerseys==
Short-sleeved t-shirts of various colors personalized with [[iron-on]] decal illustrations or appliquÃ©d letters spelling a name or message were very popular among teen and pre-teen boys in the U.S. during the late 70s. It was also the trend for teenagers and young men to carry a pack of cigarettes under the sleeve.    
Also popular were baseball jerseys or &quot;baseball sleeves&quot; (white shirts with colored sleeves worn under baseball uniform shirts). These were worn plain or with appliquÃ©d pictures or words, as described above.

==Leotards==
The dancer's [[leotard]] became an important feminine fashion accessory in 1974, and remained in style throughout the decade. The traditional long-sleeve leotard was popular as the &quot;layered style&quot; of the mid-1970s took hold, where it served less as clothing than as a way to add color and texture to the body. In the late 1970s the leotard had become a standard fashion icon of the disco scene, where flexibility and ease of movement were important. It was helped by an extensive advertising campaign in the late 1970s by [[Danskin]] which promoted their leotards and tights as &quot;not just for dancing&quot;. Celebrities of the 1970s also appeared regularly wearing leotards, including [[Joni Mitchell]], [[Cher]], and even [[Rod Stewart]]. The leotards popularity was still climbing at the end of the decade, and exploded with the arrival of the aerobics craze in the early 1980s.

==One-Piece Swimsuits==
American actress [[Farrah Fawcett]], who starred in the 1970s programme [[Charlie's Angels]], was a [[sex symbol]] for that time period. Her poster which was released in 1976 and sold 12 million copies, featured the actress with her long mane of streaked-blonde hair, perfect white teeth, and wearing a one-piece [[swimsuit]] that launched the trend for the [[maillot]]. This was, when it resurged in the 1970s, a sexy, tight swimsuit, with deep neckline and high-cut legs, worn by young women and girls in lieu of the bikini, although it did not entirely replace the latter.

==Three-Piece Suits==
The 1970s saw a return to three-piece suits (suits with matching vests), worn with the wide-collar shirts carried over fre were worn without ties as dance-club wear, or even in just a vest and jacket combination as depicted in the film [[Saturday Night Fever]]. As formal wear, however, the three-piece slowly died out in the early 1980s, by which time the outfit had come to be associated with lawyers. {{citation needed|date=April 2008}}
[[Image:Jeanne Griffin 1974.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|right|In the 1970s, women's hair was usually worn [[long hair|long]] with a centre parting]]

== Hairstyles ==
Throughout much of the decade, women and teenage girls wore their hair long, with a centre or side parting, which was a style carried over from the late 1960s. Other hairstyles of the early to mid 1970s included the wavy &quot;gypsy&quot; cut, the layered [[shag (hairstyle)|shag]],  and the &quot;flicked&quot; style, popularly referred to as &quot;wings&quot;, in which the hair was flicked into resembling small wings at the temples. This look was popularised by the stars of the television series [[Charlie's Angels]]. Blonde-streaked or &quot;frosted&quot; hair was also popular. In 1977, punk singer [[Debbie Harry]] of [[Blondie (band)|Blondie]] sparked a new trend with her shoulder-length, dyed [[platinum blonde]] hair worn with a long [[fringe (hair)|fringe]] (bangs). Young men's hair was worn long until well past the mid-1970s. Unlike the unkempt 1960s, it was often worn styled in soft layers. In California, the tousled blond, [[surfer hair]] was  fashionable for teenage boys and young men. In the early part of the decade [[sideburns]] were popular.  For [[black people|Blacks]] in the United States and elsewhere, the [[afro]] was worn by both sexes throughout the decade. It was occasionally sported by [[white people|whites]] as an alternative to the uniform long, straight hair which was a fashion mainstay until the arrival of punk and the &quot;disco look&quot; when hair became shorter and centre partings were no longer the mode.

==Punk==
{{main|Punk fashion}}

[[Punk fashion|Punk]] as a style originated from London from the designer [[Vivienne Westwood]] and her partner [[Malcolm McLaren]]. Before the Modern world a punk was a person who attacked someone's cherished beliefs, traditional institutions, etc., based on error or superstition. Due to the harsh economic realities of Europe and Britain in the early to mid '70s, this movement was a direct reaction to the economic situation during the economic depression of the period. Punk had at its heart a manifesto of creation through disorder. Safety pins became nose and ear jewellery, rubber fetishwear was subverted to become daywear, and images of mass murderers, rapists, and criminals were elevated to iconographic status.

[[Punk fashion]] can be traced to the ripped jeans, torn t-shirts, scrappy haircuts, and worn and torn leather jackets sported by members of the [[Sex Pistols]]. When they released ''[[Anarchy in the UK]]'' in 1976,The Sex Pistols were dressed by [[Malcolm McLaren]], their manager, whose partner Vivienne Westwood owned a clothes store called &quot;Let It Rock&quot; in the Kings Road, [[Chelsea, London|Chelsea]] area of London. These styles can be traced back further to New York artists at the [[Andy Warhol]] Factory or bands such as the [[Velvet Underground]], [[Patti Smith|Patti Smith Group]] or [[New York Dolls]]. By the 1980s, punk fashion and punk bands had shown up in cities across the world. There was a Do It Yourself quality to the fashion. Some small elements that spoke of a person's punk roots were safety pins, black PVC or [[tartan]] [[bondage trousers]], leopard-print t-shirts, [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]], spikes or harshly dyed hair, filthy tennis-shoes, or pointy [[Beatle]] boots. There is an element of a makeshift, thrown together look and a sense of poverty.

==Cosmetics==
{{main|Cosmetics in the 1970s}}
[[Cosmetics]] in the 1970s reflected the contradictory roles ascribed for the modern woman.&lt;ref name=p147-48&gt;De Castelbajac, p.147â48.&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time since 1900, make-up was chosen situationally, rather than in response to monolithic trends.&lt;ref name=p147-48/&gt; The era's two primary visions were the daytime &quot;natural look&quot; presented by American designers and ''[[Cosmopolitan (magazine)|Cosmopolitan]]'' magazine, and the evening aesthetic of sexualized glamour presented by European designers and fashion photographers.&lt;ref name=p147-48/&gt; In the periphery, punk and glam were also influential.  The struggling cosmetics industry attempted to make a comeback, using new marketing and manufacturing practices.
