'''Spoon''' (formerly '''Xenocode'''&lt;ref name=&quot;x-2-s&quot; /&gt;) is a set of [[application virtualization]] and  [[portable application creators|portable application creation]] software products developed by Code Systems Corporation. It includes '''Spoon Studio''' and '''Spoon Server'''. They can package conventional software applications for Microsoft Windows to become [[portable application]]s.

==Spoon Studio==
'''Spoon Studio''' (formerly '''Xenocode Virtual Studio''') is an application virtualization tool that runs on Microsoft Windows. It packages software applications into ''portable applications'', single executable files that can be run instantly on any Windows computer. It emulates only the [[operation system]] features that are necessary for applications to run. Virtualized portable applications run independently from other software, so there are no conflicts (such the [[DLL hell]] phenomenon) between them and other programs.

==Spoon.net==
The official website of Spoon, &lt;tt&gt;spoon.net&lt;/tt&gt;, also hosts virtualized applications including but not limited to productivity tools, games and different versions of famous web browsers such as [[Google Chrome]], [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]]. These different versions of web browsers may be used by [[web developer]]s to test compatibility with older web browsers. The site formerly hosted previous versions of [[Internet Explorer]] as well, but removed them on Microsoft's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
