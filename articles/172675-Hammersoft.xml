== History ==
{{main|History of Virginia Commonwealth University}}
Though officially created with the merger of the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] (RPI) and [[Medical College of Virginia]] (MCV) in 1968, VCU's history stretches back to 1838 when the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College opened in Richmond. In 1854, the Richmond Department of Medicine broke away from [[Hampden-Sydney College]] and became an independent institution known as the Medical College of Virginia. Richmond Professional Institute traces its roots back to 1917, when it began as the Richmond School of Social Work. VCU claims 1838 as its founding date on its official seal and on promotional materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.vcu.edu/about/history.php|publisher=Virginia Commonwealth University|accessdate=July 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838, the Medical Department of [[Hampden-Sydney College]] opened in Richmond. In 1844, it moved into its first permanent home, the [[Egyptian Building]]. In 1854, the Medical Department of Hampden-Sydney College received an independent charter from the [[Virginia General Assembly]] and became the ''[[Medical College of Virginia]]'' (MCV). A few years later in 1860, MCV conveyed all its property to the Commonwealth of Virginia and becomes a state institution in exchange for $30,000.

In 1893, the College of Physicians and Surgeons, later University College of Medicine, was established by [[Hunter Holmes McGuire]] just three blocks away from MCV. In 1912, McGuire Hall opened as the new home of the University College of Medicine. The following year, MCV and UCM merged through the efforts of George Ben Johnston and Stuart McGuire. MCV acquired the Memorial Hospital as a result of the merger. In 1917, the Richmond School of Social Work and Public Health was established, and in 1925, it became the Richmond division of the [[College of William and Mary]]. In 1939, this division became the [[Richmond Professional Institute]] of the College of William and Mary&quot; (RPI). In 1947, the MCV Foundation was incorporated, and in 1962 RPI separated from William and Mary to become an independent state institution. Then in 1968, state legislation (Wayne Commission Report) merged MCV and RPI to become Virginia Commonwealth University. At the time, MCV retained the right to use its name.

By 2006, VCU grew to become the most populated university in Virginia and the state's first to have 30,000 students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.news.vcu.edu/news/VCU_states_largest_fouryear_public_institution VCU stateâs largest four-year public institution â VCU News Center&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, a controversy ensued after an anonymous email led to an investigation that discovered VCU &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/search.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-08-18-0167.html Richmond, VA - VCU Basketball, News, Business, Virginia Politics, Sports, Entertainment and Weather Reports | Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.styleweekly.com/article.asp?idarticle=17461&lt;/ref&gt; awarded an undergraduate degree to former Richmond Police Chief Rodney Monroe (currently serving as Police Chief in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]) improperly after he enrolled to receive just 6 credits from the University, with the bulk of his credits taken through the online University of Phoenix and the FBI Academy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/search.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-06-28-0118.html Richmond, VA - VCU Basketball, News, Business, Virginia Politics, Sports, Entertainment and Weather Reports | Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/search.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-08-01-0186.html Richmond, VA - VCU Basketball, News, Business, Virginia Politics, Sports, Entertainment and Weather Reports | Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inrich.com/cva/ric/search.apx.-content-articles-RTD-2008-06-02-0202.html Richmond, VA - VCU Basketball, News, Business, Virginia Politics, Sports, Entertainment and Weather Reports | Richmond Times-Dispatch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Named after cigarett magnate Major [[Lewis Ginter]], a developer of the city's Ginter Park neighborhood, the The Ginter House is also part of the Monroe Park campus. VCU's well-renowned [[VCU School of the Arts|School of the Arts]] is situated on the campus, housed in the Pollak Building, named after [[Theresa Pollak]], whom founded the School of the Arts, while it was the Richmond Professional Institute.
