'''Timothy Richard Goebel''' (born September 10, 1980 in [[Evanston, Illinois]]) is an [[United States|American]] retired [[figure skater]]. He is the [[2002 Winter Olympic Games|2002 Olympic bronze medalist]]. He was the first person to land a [[salchow jump|quadruple salchow]] in competition and the first person to land three quadruple jumps in one program. He landed 76 career quadruple jumps before his retirement in 2006.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Biography==
Goebel was adopted through [[Catholic Charities]] by Ginny and Richard Goebel as an infant. 

Goebel was sometimes referred to as the &quot;Quad King&quot;&lt;ref name=usatthrow/&gt;&lt;ref name=radno/&gt; because of his ability to land quadruple jumps. On March 7, 1998, in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]], at the [[Junior Grand Prix Final]], Goebel became the first skater in the world to land a [[salchow jump|quadruple Salchow]], and the first American skater to land a quadruple jump of any kind in competition. It was videotaped by another skater's father.&lt;ref name=boundaries/&gt;

At the [[1999 Skate America]] in [[Colorado Springs]] on October 31, 1999, Goebel became the first skater to land three [[Quad (figure skating)|quadruple jumps]] in one program. In the long program, he landed a quad [[Salchow jump|salchow]], a quad [[Toe loop jump|toe loop]] in combination, and a quad toe as a solo jump.&lt;ref name=quadevo991202/&gt;

Goebel also made history at the 2002 Olympics by becoming the first skater to successfully land a quad [[salchow jump]] in combination in Olympic competition. Goebel's repertoire of quadruple jumps made him one of the most competitive skaters in the world during the peak of his career. 

Goebel was heavily criticized early in his career for focusing exclusively on jumping to the detriment of choreography and presentation, but in later years he improved in those areas.

However, after 2003, Goebel began increasingly to struggle with his jumps due to injuries. At the [[2006 United States Figure Skating Championships|2006 U.S. Championships]], in what he had previously announced would be his last competitive season, he was unable to land either a quadruple jump or triple [[axel jump|axel]] cleanly, and dropped to a seventh-place finish which left him far short of qualifying for the [[2006 Winter Olympics]].&lt;ref name=06nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbc1098/&gt;

Goebel represented the Winterhurst Figure Skating Club. He was coached by [[Audrey Weisiger]] in [[Fairfax, Virginia]], after having been previously coached by [[Carol Heiss Jenkins]], [[Glyn Watts]], and [[Frank Carroll]].

==Retirement==

On April 25, 2006, Goebel announced his retirement from competitive skating.  

On July 27, 2006, he announced that he will finish his undergraduate education at [[Columbia University]] beginning in the fall of 2006. In May 2010, he graduated with a bachelor's degree in mathematics from [[Columbia University]]'s School of General Studies. He previously attended [[Loyola Marymount University]]. 

He plans to continue to contribute to the sport as a technical specialist, having received certification for competitions sanctioned by the [[United States Figure Skating Association]]. He works as a technical specialist at the Aviator Figure Skating Academy in New York.
