The '''impact of the Arab Spring''' concerns protests or attempts to organise growing protest movements that were inspired by or similar to the [[Arab Spring]] in the [[Arab world|Arab-majority]] states of North Africa and the Middle East, according to commentators, organisers, and critics. These demonstrations and protest efforts have all been critical of the government in their respective countries, though they have ranged from calls for the incumbent government to make certain policy changes to attempts to bring down the current political system in its entirety. In some countries, protests have become large or widespread enough to effect change at the national level, as in [[2011 Armenian protests|Armenia]], while in others, such as [[2011 Djiboutian protests|Djibouti]], were swiftly suppressed.

Protests considered to be inspired by the Arab Spring have taken place on every inhabited continent, with varying degrees of success and prominence. On October 15, 2011, the subsidiary [[Occupy Wall Street|&quot;Occupy&quot;]] and [[2011 Spanish protests|Indignants]] movements inspired [[15 October 2011 global protests|protests in 951 cities in 82 countries]].

==Background==
A number of popular protests by citizens against their governments occurred in nations around the world, both following and concurrently with the Arab Spring, and many of these were reported to have been inspired by events in the Arab World starting at the end of 2010, creating a network of diffusion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofheinz&quot;&gt;Hofheinz,  Albrecht, [http://www.fes.de/ipg/IPG3_2005/07HOFHEINZ.PDF The Internet in the Arab World: Playground for Political Liberalization], International Politics and Society, 2005-03-00.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zhukov&quot;&gt;Zhukov, Yuri and Stewart, Brandon, [http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/5142122/neighbors_isq_preprint.pdf?sequence=1 Choosing your neighbors: Networks of diffusion in international relations], Forthcoming, International Studies Quarterly (Harvard), p. 1-, 19 et seq..&lt;/ref&gt;

Some potentially vulnerable states that have not yet seen such protests have taken a variety of preemptive measures to avoid such displays occurring in their own countries; some of these states and others have experienced political fallout as a result of their own governmental actions and reactions to events which their own citizens are seeing reported from abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hofheinz&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hroub&quot;&gt;Hroub, Khaled, [http://www.abc.net.au/religion/articles/2011/10/20/3344402.htm Al Jazeera: the source of Arab springs], Australian Broadcasting Corporation, 2011-10-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;barnett&quot;&gt;Barnett, Clive, [http://oro.open.ac.uk/29008/2/Theory_and_events.pdf Theory and events], Geoforum, 42(3), pp. 263â265, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dunn&quot;&gt;Dunn, Alexandra, The Arab Spring: Revolution and Shifting Geopolitics: Unplugging a Nation: State Media Strategy During Egypt's January 25 Uprising, 35 Fletcher F.

==Protests==
===Sub-Saharan Africa===
====Angola====
A local radio station in Angola said the police arrested about 20 demonstrators who gathered in the country's capital to protest against Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos, who has been in power for 32 years.
Radio Ecclesia reported Monday that a small number of demonstrators gathered at midnight in response to internet calls for an anti-government demonstration. Media reports say police also arrested three local journalists covering the demonstration, but released them later Monday.
President dos Santos' party rallied more than 20,000 pro-government protesters Saturday to march in Luanda in response to rumors of Monday's demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/feedarticle/9533081 | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=World news | date=23 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Burkina Faso====
{{main|2011 BurkinabÃ¨ protests}}

Longtime President [[Blaise CompaorÃ©]] faced the strongest protests against his regime starting in February 2011, with tens of thousands protesting on 14 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110415-shots-fired-inside-burkina-faso-presidential-compound |title=Shots fired inside Burkina Faso presidential compound |publisher=FRANCE 24 |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soldiers soon joined the protests, prompting CompaorÃ© to dissolve his cabinet, appoint a new prime minister, replace his army chief, and name himself defense minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13116774|agency=BBC News|date=18 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=Burkina Faso army mutiny spreads to fourth city}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/04/22/burkina.faso.government/|agency=CNN International|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=Ministers fired, smaller government created in Africa's Burkina Faso|first=Ouezen Louis|last=Oulon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southafricafocus.com/2011/04/22/burkina-faso-president-blaise-compaore-takes-charge-of-defense-rtt-news/|agency=RTT News|date=22 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore Takes Charge Of Defense}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students joined protests in [[Ouagadougou]] on 19 April as well, [[BBC News]] reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/africa/students-join-burkina-faso-protests-1.1058743|agency=IOL News|date=19 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=Students join Burkina Faso protests}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 April, a coalition of 34 BurkinabÃ© opposition parties called for a rally on 30 April to demand CompaorÃ©'s resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailystar.net/newDesign/news-details.php?nid=182823|agency=The Daily Star|date=23 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011|title=Burkina opposition calls anti-president demo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cameroon====
Opposition groups, trade unions and Diaspora groups had prepared &quot;Egypt-like&quot; protests in [[Cameroon]] to call for President [[Paul Biya]] to step down. However, the protest movement was poorly organised and coordinated,&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol_cam_egyptlike&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/37405|title=Cameroon plans &quot;Egypt-like&quot; protests|date=22 February 2011|publisher=afrol News|accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and protesters in [[Douala]] and [[YaoundÃ©]] were outnumbered by police, resulting in protesters being dispersed by the police before being able to organise a large crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;afrol_cam_crushed&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/37416|title=Police easily cracks down Cameroon protests|date=23 February 2011|publisher=afrol News|accessdate=26 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Djibouti====
{{main|2011 Djiboutian protests}}
On 3 February, demonstrations began when about three hundred people protested peacefully against President [[Ismail Omar Guelleh]] in [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti City]], urging him to not run for another term; the protesters further asked for more liberty as well as for political and social reform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=People in Djibouti protest against President Gelleh|author=|newspaper=Somalilandpress|year=|url=http://somalilandpress.com/people-in-djibouti-protest-againts-president-gelleh-19925|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests soon increased, however, as thousands rallied against the president, many vowing to remain at the site until their demands were met. On 18 February, an estimated 30,000 Dijiboutians protested in central Djibouti City against the president, maintaining that the constitutional change of the previous year, which allowed him a third term, was illegal. The demonstration escalated into clashes with the police, and at least two persons were killed and many injured when police used live ammunition and teargas against the protesters.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afrol.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afrol.com/articles/37449 |title=Mass arrests stopped further Djibouti protests |publisher=Afrol.com |date=27 February 2011 |accessdate=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 and 24 February, protest leaders were arrested and after they failed to turn up on the 24th, opposition leader Bourhan Mohammed Ali stated he feared the protests had lost momentum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Afrol.com&quot;/&gt; The last protest was planned for 11 March, but security forces stopped the protest and detained 4 opposition leaders. No protests or planned protests have occurred since.

====Ivory Coast====
In [[CÃ´te d'Ivoire]] (Ivory Coast), peace activist [[Aya Virginie Toure]] organized thousands of women&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Women in Ivory Coast lead the revolution against Gbagbo | url = http://newscastmedia.com/blog/2011/03/09/women-in-ivory-coast-lead-the-revolution-against-gbagbo/ | date = March 9, 2011 | work = Newscast Media | format = article | accessdate = 2011-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in numerous peaceful protests across the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = The Ivory Coast Effect

Nigerian Foreign Minister [[Henry Odein Ajumogobia]] accused the [[international community]] of &quot;contradictions&quot; by imposing a no-fly zone over Libya and focusing on the civil war in Libya, but failing to take action to protect civilians in the Ivory Coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Nigeria: Ignoring Ivory Coast is hypocritical | url = http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503543_162-20045674-503543.html | date = March 21, 2011 | work = CBS News/World | format = article | accessdate = 2011-03-21 | first=Joshua | last=Norman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil production in Libya is seen as a more strategic commodity than cocoa in the Ivory Coast,

====Gabon====
On 29 January, riot police in [[Gabon]] fired tear gas to break up a protest by around 5,000 opposition supporters, where according to witnesses, up to 20 people were wounded. It was the second such protest since opposition leader [[Andre Mba Obame]] declared himself president on January 25 and urged people to take inspiration from Tunisia's uprising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Police use tear gas to break up Gabon protest

The UN is accusing Gabon's police of invading and beating students within the university. Although initial protests overwhelmingly consisted of opposition loyalists, the unrest appears to be developing into a wider social conflict, with students leading the protests.&lt;ref name=&quot;csmonitor1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Now that Egypt's Mubarak is out, could Gabon's Bongo be next?

====Malawi====
{{main|2011 Malawi protests}}
On 21 July protesters in [[Mzuzu]], [[Blantyre]] and [[Lilongwe]] took out a march against President [[Bingu wa Mutharika]] because of anger of corruption and a fuel shortage. The ensuing tear gas firing by security forces was then followed up with riots that led to the deaths of 10 people.

====Mozambique====
An elite police unit crushed a workers' protest on 6 April, detaining a number of demonstrators and leaving several injured. At least one protester died as a result of the crackdown. The Mozambican Human Rights League called for an investigation and demanded the commander of the unit step down. [[Al Jazeera]] connected the incident to a broader wave of unrest sparked by the events in North Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A continent's discontent|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/04/201141014942125983.html|agency=Al Jazeera English|date=12 April 2011|accessdate=24 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Swaziland====
Thousands of people protested in [[Swaziland]] against the absolute monarch [[Mswati III]], who is known for his lavish spending; the government's reaction was a swift crackdown, with tear gas and water cannons used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=April 13, 2011 1:16AM |url=http://www.news.com.au/breaking-news/swazi-police-use-tear-gas-on-protest/story-e6frfku0-1226038184313 |title=Swazi police use tear gas on protest |publisher=News.com.au |date=2011-04-13 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Uganda====
[[Ugandan]] President [[Yoweri Museveni]] was [[Ugandan general election, 2011|declared the winner of Uganda's 2011 general election]] on 11 February amidst opposition denunciations. [[Kizza Besigye]], the chairman of the opposition coalition finished second with 26.01% of the vote. Besigye warned that Uganda was ripe for an Egypt-style revolt after Museveni's more than two decades in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/uganda/8336879/Ugandan-president-comfortably-wins-re-election.html|location=London|work=The Daily Telegraph|title=Ugandan president comfortably wins re-election|date=2011-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protesters failed to amass in large numbers because, as the ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' suggested, a failure to tally its own results through its own [[SMS]] system was disrupted by the government, who also arrested hundreds of opposition [[field agent]]s. They also suggested that Besigye did not believe his own claim of sparking a revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0222/Why-Uganda-s-Besigye-failed-to-deliver-Egypt-style-protests-after-election-defeat|title=Why Uganda's Besigye failed to deliver Egypt-style protests after election defeat|publisher=CSMonitor.com|year=|accessdate=2011-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; With unrest growing at the rising prices of food and fuel, the arrest of Kizza Besigye on 28 April was the catalyst for protests and riots across the Ugandan capital, [[Kampala]], in which two were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=David|accessdate=2011-04-29|date=2011-04-29|title=Uganda riots reach capital as anger against President Museveni grows|work=[[The Guardian]]|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/apr/29/uganda-riots-kampala-museveni|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Zimbabwe====
Munyaradzi Gwisai, a former opposition member of parliament, organised a meeting to discuss the uprisings in North Africa on 21 February. He, along with 45 others, were arrested and allegedly tortured and face a charge of [[treason]] that carries the death penalty. Many Zimbwabwean migrants to South Africa, who number in the hundreds of thousands, are free to talk of the events. However, past violence in elections and many of the youth and educated middle classes having fled the country there were questions about the pool of protesters to carry out such actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/02/21/zimbabwe.unrest.arrests/index.html|work=CNN|title=46 arrested for plotting Egyptian-style coup in Zimbabwe|date=2011-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;alj_zimb_gwisai&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/asia/2011/03/20113151258342215.html |title=Violence deters Zimbabwe activists - Asia |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regional unrest reached [[Armenia]] in January as merchants protested a ban on street trading in [[Yerevan]], the former [[Soviet socialist republic]]'s capital.

===Europe===
{{main|Anti-austerity protests}}

As 2011 progressed, a number of protest movements waxed and waned, all claiming a connection with the Arab Spring and the austerity measures taken by the European Union and it's individual constituent states. The most persistent of these were in Greece, Spain and the United Kingdom, the last of which suffered violent riots in the summer. The so-called [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement called for worldwide demonstrations on October 15, and there were protests in every single [[European Union]] capital, not to mention smaller cities.

====Albania====
{{Main|2011 Albanian opposition demonstrations}}
Although located in the [[Balkans]] region of Europe, the influence of the Tunisian uprising{{Citation needed|year=February 2011|date=February 2011}} has spread to [[Albania]], by some measures a Muslim-majority country. After a television broadcast showing Deputy Prime Minister [[Ilir Meta]] trying to influence the decision for awarding a contract to build a power station, [[2011 Albanian Demonstrations|protests against]] [[Sali Berisha]]'s government, organised by the country's [[Socialist Party of Albania|socialist party]] and attended by some 20,000 people in [[Tirana]], turned violent and resulted in three deaths. The country's opposition parties vowed to continue the anti-government protests.

[[Edi Rama]], the mayor of Albania's capital, Tirana, and leader of the Socialist party, blamed Berisha for the deaths and said a day of [[mourning]] would be observed. &quot;After we honour the dead in a show of freedom and justice, we assure Berisha that we will confront him with all the historical and civil responsibility we feel for getting rid of this intolerable regime of thieves.&quot; Berisha responded by calling for his supporters to organise a mass protest against the violence. &quot;I call on Albanians to gather on [26 January] in Tirana to protest against the violence. It will be a big demonstration against violence. I warn Edi Rama and his followers, and violent groups of their supporters, that they will face the full force of the law if they dare touch the [government] institutions.&quot; He had earlier said that &quot;Albania is not in a state of emergency and will not pass into a state of emergency. But scenarios of violence will not be tolerated.&quot; He also accused Rama of trying to foment an uprising like that of Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/01/2011122134433502716.html|title=Albania opposition vows protests|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=2011-01-22|accessdate=2011-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following a [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|presidential election]] on 2010 protesters continued to maintain their stance against the government. On March 25, police attacked hundreds of opposition activists who tried to hold an anti-government rally. Dozens of the demonstrators were beaten in Minsk, and the rights group [[Vyasna]] says at least 50 were detained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/mar/25/eu-belarus-opposition-rally/Protests ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests had been going on since it was alleged that President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] had stolen the [[Belarusian presidential election, 2010|presidential election of Dec. 2010]].

On 25 February 2011, several hundred protestors rallied in Berlin urging defense minister [[Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg]] to step down after being stripped of his doctorate because of plagiarism. The protestors waved shoes in reference of the Egypt protests. The evidence of the plagiarism as well as the protests spread on the internet.

The reasons for the demonstrations across Greece were the harsh austerity measures the country was forced to take as part of an [[International Monetary Fund]]&amp;ndash;[[European Union]] bailout plan in 2010 that were ineffective, the people's belief that the politicians are corrupt and do not serve the people but international interests, the country's continuously renewed two-party system, high numbers of unemployment, especially for the youth, the government's proposal for new austerity measures, the presence of the [[International Monetary Fund]] in the country, and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Real Democracy Now! demands&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://real-democracy.gr/el/%CF%83%CF%84%CF%8C%CF%87%CE%BF%CE%B9-%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%85-%CE%BA%CE%B9%CE%BD%CE%AE%CE%BC%CE%B1%CF%84%CE%BF%CF%82%CF%83%CF%85%CE%B6%CE%B7%CF%84%CE%AE%CF%83%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%82 |title=Î£ÏÏÏÎ¿Î¹ ÏÎ¿Ï ÎºÎ¹Î½Î®Î¼Î±ÏÎ¿Ï/Î£ÏÎ¶Î·ÏÎ®ÏÎµÎ¹Ï |date=27 May 2011 |publisher=www.real-democracy.gr |accessdate=30 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 January, [[Turkish Cypriot]] protesters, some of which carried [[flag of Cyprus|flags of The Republic of Cyprus]] gathered in [[Northern Cyprus|Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]] to protest the economic reforms and the Turkish government.

Rumours suggested that the protesters would include university students, lorry drivers, and gold merchants from across the country, who were protesting under the umbrella opposition known as the [[2009â2010 Iranian election protests|Green movement]], the emergence of which had been inspired by the recent events in Egypt and Tunisia.

As they had in the 2009 protests, opposition protesters chanted '[[Allahu Akbar]]' and 'Death to the dictator' into the early morning hours.

{{main|Timeline of the 2011 Israeli housing protests}}
[[File:Israel Housing Protests Tel Aviv August 6 2011b.jpg|thumb|250px|Israeli protests, July 2011]]
The 2011 Israeli housing protests ([[Hebrew]]: ××××ª ×××××¨ or ××××ª ×× ××&quot;× or ××××ª ×××××××) are a series of ongoing street demonstrations taking place throughout [[Israel]] from 14 July 2011 onwards. The protests began as a result of a [[Facebook]] protest group that initially led hundreds of people to camp in tents in the center of [[Tel Aviv]] on [[Rothschild Boulevard]], an act which soon gained momentum, media attention and began a public discourse in Israel regarding the [[Israel's housing bubble|high cost of housing]] and living expenses. Soon afterwards, the protests spread to many other [[cities in Israel]] as thousands of Israeli protesters began camping in tents in the middle of central streets in major Israeli cities as a means of protest. The protesters object to increasing housing prices in Israel, and especially in the country's major cities, which they claim prevents [[affordable housing]].

It has been suggested in the media that the protests might have been inspired by the ongoing [[Arab Spring]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ISRAEL: Is the Arab Spring spreading to the Jewish state?|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/babylonbeyond/2011/07/israel-protests-spread-demanding-social-justice.html|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|work=Los Angeles Times|author=Batsheva Sobelman}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Has the Arab Spring arrived in Israel?|url=http://www.globalpost.com/dispatches/news/regions/middle-east/israel-and-palestine/has-the-arab-spring-arrived-israel|date=26 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=globalpost|author=Peter Gelling}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Israeli protests have generally been [[non-violent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Arab Spring spirit inspires Israel tent cities|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2015675754_israelprotests21.html|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=27 July 2011|publisher=The Seattle Times|author=Ethan Bronner}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still Israeli protesters took some of the Arab revolutions slogans like the word &quot;Erhal&quot; which means &quot;Leave.&quot;

On July 9, 2011, between 20,000 and 50,000 protesters took to the streets of the capital city of [[Kuala Lumpur]] to demand electoral reform.

Despite a heavy police cordon of Kuala Lumpur, tens of thousands of protesters managed to make their way into the capital city.

Nazarbayev supported the Constitutional Council's ruling that such a referendum would be unconstitutional and called an [[Kazakhstani presidential election, 2011|early election]] to be held on 3 April 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/01/us-kazakhstan-referendum-usa-idUSTRE7101VI20110201 |title=U.S. praises Kazakh leader for skipping referendum |publisher=Reuters |date=2011-02-01 |accessdate=2011-02-14 |first=Dmitry |last=Solovyov}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also planned to offer the citizens of Kazakhstan discounted shares in some key national companies as part of a series of &quot;People's [[IPO]]s&quot; saying that &quot;This is an event of paramount importance to the state...The whole world is earning money on stock markets and citizens of Kazakhstan should also learn how to do this.&quot; However, some critics suggested this was &quot;window dressing&quot;, saying Nazarbayev merely was trying to deflect claims that too much wealth was controlled by a &quot;corrupt, ruling elite.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/03/01/kazakhstan-shares-for-votes/ |title=Kazakhstan: shares for votes &amp;#124; beyondbrics &amp;#124; News and views on emerging markets from the Financial Times â FT.com |publisher=Blogs.ft.com |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; News media in [[South Africa]] have warned of a possible &quot;Egypt effect&quot; in Russia and the [[Post-Soviet states|former Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;donmino&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mg.co.za/article/2011-02-11-egyptian-aftershock-felt-most-by-israel/ |title=Egyptian aftershock felt most by Israel |publisher=[[Mail &amp; Guardian Online]] |date=2011-02-11  |publisher=Mg.co.za |accessdate=2011-02-13 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wb82X8iv |archivedate=2011-02-18 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nigeria===
The [[media in Nigeria]] speculated that similar events could take place there as the [[Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta]] in the south or [[Boko Haram]] in the north could exploit the &quot;distortions within the Nigerian system, and the anger of an aggrieved segment of the populace.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.osundefender.org/?p=11806 |title=Egypt/Tunisia: It could happen here |publisher=[[Osun Defender]] |date= |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first week of February Boko Haram also threatened the Nigerian government that it would carry out a &quot;full scale war.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alex Thurston |url=http://thinkafricapress.com/article/resurgent-islamists-threaten-war-nigeria |title=Resurgent Islamists Threaten War in Nigeria &amp;#124; Nigeria News &amp; Opinion |publisher=[[Think Africa Press]] |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2011-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkmenistan===
At least one well-regarded political analyst (published by ''[[Foreign Policy (magazine)|Foreign Policy]]'' and [[Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty]]) said that conditions in the Central Asian republic of [[Turkmenistan]] were similar enough to those in countries currently experiencing protests and revolts that the autocratic government of President [[Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov]] appears worried by the precedent of revolutions in North Africa and major political concessions in several [[Western Asia]]n states. Berdimuhamedov's regime has censored all news of the protests and governmental changes. There have also been some credible reports of Turkmenistani authorities attempting to keep tabs on all citizens both inside and outside the country, with Turkmenistanis whom the government judges to have spent too much time abroad allegedly warned they could be barred either from returning to their home country, or from leaving again once they do return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://oilandglory.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/04/21/the_arab_spring_the_turkmen_case|agency=Foreign Policy|date=21 April 2011|accessdate=26 April 2011|first=Muhammad|last=Tahir|title=The Arab Spring: The Turkmen case}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Uzbekistan===
The [[Uzbekistan]]i government embraced a set of parliamentary reforms in late March that will grant the [[Legislative Chamber of Uzbekistan|Legislative Chamber]] of the [[Supreme Assembly of Uzbekistan|Supreme Assembly]], a democratically elected body, a stronger ability to check the power of the [[Prime Minister of Uzbekistan|prime minister]] by allowing it to call a [[motion of no confidence]], as well as empowering both houses of the Supreme Assembly to &quot;demand information&quot; from the executive branch, according to one Uzbekistani senator involved with the reform initiative. At least one prominent political analyst at an Interior Ministry-affiliated university in [[Tashkent]] said the reforms were inspired by recent revolutionary events in the Middle East and [[2010 Kyrgyzstani uprising|Kyrgyzstan]], asserting that democratization and government accountability and not violence are the means to forestalling popular upheaval.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://centralasiaonline.com/cocoon/caii/xhtml/en_GB/features/caii/features/main/2011/04/14/feature-01|agency=Central Asia Online|title=Uzbekistan strengthens parliament|date=14 April 2011|accessdate=21 April 2011|first=Shakar|last=Saadi}}&lt;/ref&gt;
