'''Zelma O'Neal''' (May 29, 1903 - November 3, 1989) was an actress, singer, and dancer in the 1920s and 1930s. She appeared on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and in early [[sound film]]s, including the [[Paramount Pictures]] films ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' and ''[[Follow Thru]]'' (both 1930).&lt;ref name=imdboneal&gt;{{IMDb name|641952|Zelma O'Neal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She was married to actor [[Anthony Bushell]] from 1928-1935. He said in the 1990s that he ended the marriage because he wanted a joint career but she wanted to be a society hostess. He also claimed to have been married three times, which does not seem to have been the case.
