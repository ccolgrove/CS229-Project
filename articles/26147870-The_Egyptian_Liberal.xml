The '''Liberal Party''' is [[democratic]] [[Liberalism|liberal]] [[secular]] political party in Egypt. '''Liberal Egyptian Party''' ([[Egyptian Arabic]]: Ø§ÙØ­Ø²Ø¨ Ø§ÙÙØµØ±Ù Ø§ÙÙÙØ¨Ø±Ø§ÙÙ, ''el Hizb el Masri el Liberali''), formerly '''Mother Egypt Party''', is a grassroots movement and a [[secular]],[[conservative liberal]]political party in [[Egypt]]. The party builds on previous attempts by native anti-colonial activists in the early 20th century to re-assert ethnic Egyptian identity, based in part on national independence from the [[British Empire|British]] and the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]], the establishment of a secular and democratic national government, and the formalization of the local [[Masri language]]. It also seeks to revive the indigenous [[Egyptian language]] and to disassociate Egypt from the [[Arab nationalist]] policies introduced by [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. The Liberal Egyptian Party calls for separating religion from politics and most civil affairs. The party also calls for capitalism and reducing the influence of the public sector in the economy. It also calls for full normalization with Israel and strong relations with the West.
The founder of the Liberal Egyptian party is Mahmoud Elphraouni, from the Assiut Governorate.
