'''Michael Kelvin Norris''' (born March 19, 1955 in [[San Francisco, California]]) is a former [[Major League Baseball]] right-handed [[starting pitcher]] who played with the [[Oakland Athletics]] ({{By|1975}}-{{By|1983}}, {{By|1990}}).

Norris is best remembered for his spectacular {{By|1980}} season. He went 22-9 with 24 [[complete game]]s and a 2.53 [[earned run average]], while also earning the [[Gold Glove Award]]. However, he was not awarded the [[American League]] [[Cy Young Award]]; [[Steve Stone (baseball player)|Steve Stone]] of the [[Baltimore Orioles]], who had a record of 25-7, was given the honor. Norris also placed 15th in the MVP voting.

In {{By|1981}}, Norris posted a modest 12-9 record, again earning the Gold Glove Award and also earning an All-Star berth he was denied in 1980. Norris spun a complete game shutout in the first round of the playoffs against the [[Kansas City Royals]] and pitched well in the [[1981 American League Championship Series|AL Championship Series]] against the [[New York Yankees]] despite getting hit with a loss there.

Many believe that [[Billy Martin]] inflicted a heavy workload on Norris, which threw out his arm. He was never able to return to his former stature, and after the 1983 season, he played for the independent [[San Jose Bees]]. He made a brief comeback as a [[relief pitcher]] in 1990, posting an ERA of 3.00 in 27 innings.

An [[Substance dependence|addiction]] to [[cocaine]] shortened Norris's playing career. In 1999 he was diagnosed with [[cervical myelopathy]], and he had surgery in January 2000 at the [[California Pacific Medical Center]]. After recovering, Norris took up [[golf]] as a hobby.

Norris was well-known for his distinctive green fielding glove.
