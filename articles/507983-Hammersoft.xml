'''Michel Camdessus''' (born [[1 May]] [[1933]]) is a French applied economist and administrator who was Managing Director of the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) from 16 January 1987 to 14 February 2000. To date, he is the longest serving Managing Director of the IMF.

Among the most important events of his tenure was the [[1997 Asian Financial Crisis|East Asian financial crisis]]. His role has been criticized for not paying attention to the unique circumstances of the East Asian countries and blindly imposing the measures that were followed in Mexico leading to considerable turmoil and rioting in countries such as Indonesia.&lt;ref name=&quot;gaid&quot;&gt;{{Citation |last=Stiglitz |first=Joseph E. |authorlink=Joseph Stiglitz |title=Globalization and its Discontents |year=2002 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Co. |location=New York |isbn=0393051242 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Previously, he was Deputy Governor and [[Governor]] of the [[Bank of France]] from November 1984 until his move to [[Washington DC]]. 

Born in [[Bayonne]], France, Mr. Camdessus was educated at the [[University of Paris]] and earned postgraduate degrees in economics at ''[[Paris Institute of Political Studies|Institut d'Etudes Politiques de Paris]] (Sciences Po)'' in Paris and the ''[[Ãcole nationale d'administration]]''.

He is currently president of the [[:fr:Semaines sociales de France|Semaines Sociales de France]] and is a member of the Commission for Africa established by [[Tony Blair]]. He is also a member of the pontifical Commission for Justice and Peace.

Camdessus is a member of the [[Africa Progress Panel]] (APP), an independent authority on Africa launched in April 2007 to focus world leadersâ attention on delivering their commitments to the continent. The Panel launched a major report in London on Monday 16 June 2008 entitled ''Africa's Development: Promises and Prospects''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |work=APP |title=Press Release: Africa Progress Panel demands action on global food crisis âreversing decades of economic progressâ |date=16 June 2008 |url=http://www.africaprogresspanel.org/english/newsreleases.php }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
