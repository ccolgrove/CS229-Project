Denison died at the age of 64 when he fell under a train at [[Wimborne]]. He had arrived at  [[Wimborne railway station]] to change trains for Bournemouth, and while waiting went for a walk. He was walking beside the track on the way back to the station when a strong wind blew his hat off and he fell almost immediately under the train. His body was cut to pieces and carried some 56 feet.&lt;ref name=LR2/&gt;  

Denison married the Hon. Helen Duncombe, daughter of [[William Duncombe, 2nd Baron Feversham]] in 1855.&lt;ref name=Debrett/&gt; They were the parents of [[Sir Gervase Beckett, 1st Baronet]]. Following his death a Mrs Gertrude Beatrice Brinkworth alleged she was his mistress and mother of his adopted children and sued his executors. Some money was paid but the case came before court and the jury declared Mrs Brinkworth's case to be a 'swindle' and rejected her claims even before the evidence in the case had been completed.&lt;ref name=LR2/&gt;
