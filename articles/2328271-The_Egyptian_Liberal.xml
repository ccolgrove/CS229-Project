She had been an editor at large and columnist for ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' and a contributor to ''[[Slate (magazine)| Slate]]''.

==Biography==
McLean grew up in Hibbing and received her [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in English and mathematics at [[Williams College]] in 1992. After college and prior to joining ''Fortune'', she worked as an investment banker for [[Goldman Sachs]].

McLean married Chris Wilford in 2000.  They divorced in 2006.  In May 2008, McLean married [[Sean Berkowitz]], a partner with [[Latham &amp; Watkins]]. Berkowitz is the former Director of the [[Enron Task Force]]; they met through their mutual connection to that case.

==Writing==
McLean is the co-[[author]], with ''Fortune'' colleague Peter Elkind, of ''[[The Smartest Guys in the Room (book)|The Smartest Guys in the Room]]'' (ISBN 1591840082), exposing the corrupt business practices of [[Enron]] officials. The book was the result of her reporting on Enron for the magazine and she first wrote about Enron with her article in the March 5, 2001 issue of ''Fortune'' entitled, &quot;Is Enron Overpriced?&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/2006/01/13/news/companies/enronoriginal_fortune/index.htm Fortune archive: Is Enron Overpriced? - Jan. 19, 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The book was later made into the [[Academy Award]] nominated documentary ''[[Enron: The Smartest Guys in the Room]]''. Her column, &quot;The Bulldog&quot;, appeared regularly in ''Fortune''. 

She co-authored a book with ''New York Times'' columnist [[Joe Nocera]] on the 2008 financial crisis titled ''[[All the Devils Are Here]],'' (November 2010). It details what happened and concludes it was not an accident, that banks understood the big picture before the crisis happened but continued with bad practices.

McLean joined ''Vanity Fair'' as a contributing editor in 2008. She joined ''Slate'' as a contributor to the Moneybox column in 2010.

McLean made appearances on ''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'', as an observer of the trials of [[Ken Lay]] and [[Jeffrey Skilling]]. McLean was a guest on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' on October 13, 2008, a guest on ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'' on January 15, 2009 and again on November 16, 2010, and was interviewed on the [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] program ''[[NOW (PBS)|NOW]]'' with [[David Brancaccio]] on January 30, 2009. She appeared on the Charlie Rose show on November 18, 2010.
