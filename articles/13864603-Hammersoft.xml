==Early life and education==
Epstein was born February 4, 1977 and grew up in the ethnically-diverse neighborhood of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]], [[Queens]], [[New York City|New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | title = Mr. Greg Epstein, Humanist Chaplaincy | work = Harvard Chaplains | publisher = The President and Fellows of Harvard College | year = 2009 | url = http://chaplains.harvard.edu/chaplains/profile.php?id=45 | accessdate = 23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents, though [[Judaism|Jewish]], were not very religious, and he attended services with them only occasionally, usually during [[Jewish holiday|Jewish holidays or festivals]]. He describes this experience as one of the foundations for his later interest in [[Humanistic Judaism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title = Repossessing virtue: Greg Epstein on human solutions and not divine ones | url = http://blog.speakingoffaith.org/post/73565275/repossessing-virtue-greg-epstein-on-human | series = Speaking of Faith | serieslink = http://speakingoffaith.publicradio.org/ | credits = Krista Tippett | network = National Public Radio | publisher = American Public Media | location = St. Paul, Minnesota | airdate = January 27, 2009 | minutes = 11:47 | accessdate = 23 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

While attending the [[Stuyvesant High School]] in [[Manhattan]], Epstein studied [[Buddhism]] and [[Taoism]]. After graduating from high school, he enrolled in the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor]]. As part of his undergraduate studies in the University of Michigan's [[University of Michigan College of Literature, Science, and the Arts|College of Literature, Science, and the Arts]], he spent a year in [[Taiwan]] in an effort to further his knowledge of [[Zen Buddhism]] through readings in Chinese and direct contact with Zen practitioners. Becoming disenchanted with Eastern religions during this experience, Epstein returned to the U.S. and completed his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Religious studies|Religion]] and [[Sinology|Chinese]] from the University of Michigan. He then went on to complete a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] in [[Jewish studies#Michigan, University of|Judaic Studies]], also from the University of Michigan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot; /&gt;

==New Humanism==
Upon matriculation, Epstein spent about a year singing and recording as a professional [[Rock music]]ian. It was during this time that he became interested in the philosophy of [[Humanism]]. Deciding to return to school, he entered the [[International Institute for Secular Humanistic Judaism]], studying at the Institute's [[Jerusalem]] and [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]] campuses. In 2005 he was ordained through this organization as a [[Humanistic Judaism|Humanist]] [[Rabbi]], whereupon he entered the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Harvard&quot; /&gt; In 2007, Greg Epstein received his [[Master of Theological Studies]] from the [[Harvard Divinity School]], and accepted the position as the Humanist Chaplain at Harvard University.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDT&quot; /&gt; 

Epstein became one of the major supporters for the movement that is known as [[New Humanism]]. Although this label had been around since 1900, it had gone into disuse until Epstein and others repopularized it.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} In April 2007, Epstein organized an international conference entitled &quot;The New Humanism&quot;, which commemorated the 30th anniversary of the creation of the Humanist Chaplaincy of Harvard.&lt;ref name=&quot;HDT&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Class Notes | journal = Harvard Divinity Today | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 14 | publisher = Harvard Divinity School | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | date = Fall 2007 | url = http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news/HDT/2007v3n3.pdf | oclc = 154952368 | accessdate = 24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Brunsman IV | first = August E. | authorlink = http://www.secularstudents.org/staff | title = The New Humanism: Humanist Leadership Education | journal = Secular Student eMpirical | volume = 20 | publisher = Secular Student Alliance | location = Columbus, Ohio | date = 28 June 2007 | url = http://www.secularstudents.org/node/1437 | accessdate = 24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Epstein expressed concern on overemphasis of inflammatory [[anti-clericism]] by some prominent proponents of [[New Atheism]], which he says is what drove him to revitalize the &quot;New Humanism&quot; label in response.

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The New Humanism'' is produced by the Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard University and is named after the 30th anniversary conference our organization held in April 2007. At that event, the title was chosen to contrast with &quot;The New Atheism,&quot; as the media have dubbed the work of writers such as [[Oxford]] scientist [[Richard Dawkins]], [[Stanford]] doctoral student [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]], and journalist [[Christopher Hitchens]], each of whom had recently published a bestselling book promoting atheism. The intention was to use our conference to draw attention to the idea that Humanism, like atheism, is [[nontheistic]] and not traditionally religious, but unlike some popular atheism, Humanism is not necessarily an [[antireligious]] ideology. We also hoped our conference could serve as an exploration of the best ways in which Humanism can be more positive and constructive than what the general public had been seeing in the New Atheism. Our speakers, topics, and other conference events were chosen in order to highlight these distinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Epstein  | first = Greg | authorlink = http://www.thenewhumanism.org/authors/greg-epstein | title = Why The New Humanism | journal = The New Humanism | publisher = The Humanist Chaplaincy at Harvard | location = Cambridge, Massachusetts | url = http://www.thenewhumanism.org/authors/greg-epstein/articles/why-the-new-humanism | accessdate = 24 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
