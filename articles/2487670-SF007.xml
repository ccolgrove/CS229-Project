<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="2487670" ns="0" title="Application bundle"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">In [[NEXTSTEP]], [[OPENSTEP]], their lineal descendants [[Mac OS X]], [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]], and in [[GNUstep]], a bundle is a [[directory (file systems)|directory]] that allows related resources such as an application's executable and its graphics to be grouped together, appearing as a single file to the user.

Examples include [[Application software|applications]], [[Application framework|frameworks]], and [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]]. They are accessed with the &lt;tt&gt;NSBundle&lt;/tt&gt; class in [[Cocoa (API)|Cocoa]], [[NEXTSTEP]] and [[GNUstep]]'s [[Foundation_Kit|Foundation]] frameworks, and with &lt;tt&gt;CFBundle&lt;/tt&gt; in [[Core Foundation]].

A bundle usually contains one file representing executable code, and files that represent resources such as [[Interface Builder#Nib files|nibs]], images, sounds, and other media. On some other systems, such as [[Microsoft Windows]], these resources are usually included directly in the executable file itself at compile time. On older Macintoshes, a similar technique is used, where additional [[metadata]] can be added to a file's [[resource fork]]. The [[Finder (software)|Finder]] treats bundles, which can also be referred to as [[Package (Mac OS X)|packages]], as opaque files with no underlying structure.

The [[Uniform Type Identifier]] (UTI) for an Apple bundle is &lt;tt&gt;com.apple.bundle&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System-Declared Uniform Type Identifiers|work=Uniform Type Identifiers Reference|url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Miscellaneous/Reference/UTIRef/Articles/System-DeclaredUniformTypeIdentifiers.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009259-SW1|publisher=[[Apple Inc.]]|accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar in concept are the [[Application Directory|application directories]] used in [[RISC OS]] and on the [[ROX Desktop]], and the [[RUNZ]] bundles in [[Super OS]].

==Mac OS X application bundles==
Application bundles are directory hierarchies, with the top-level directory having a name that ends with a &lt;tt&gt;.app&lt;/tt&gt; extension. In an application bundle, the first directory in the bundle underneath the top-level directory is usually named &lt;tt&gt;Contents&lt;/tt&gt;. Within &lt;tt&gt;Contents&lt;/tt&gt; there is usually another directory (called &lt;tt&gt;MacOS&lt;/tt&gt; on Macs, or using the application's name on [[GNUstep]]), which contains the application's executable code. Within the &lt;tt&gt;Contents&lt;/tt&gt; folder there is usually also a directory called &lt;tt&gt;Resources&lt;/tt&gt;, which contains the resources of the application.

Among other things, the &lt;tt&gt;Resources&lt;/tt&gt; folder contains localized versions of the application's [[Interface Builder|nib file]]s.

Other common subdirectories include &lt;tt&gt;Plugins&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;Frameworks&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;Shared Frameworks&lt;/tt&gt;. The &lt;tt&gt;Frameworks&lt;/tt&gt; directory contains frameworks used by the application, and are used even if another version of the framework exists on the system. The &lt;tt&gt;Shared Frameworks&lt;/tt&gt; directory contains frameworks that can be used both by the application that contains them, and other applications; they are used only if a newer version does not exist elsewhere on the system. &lt;tt&gt;Plugins&lt;/tt&gt; contains extensible code used by the application.

==Mac OS X framework bundles==
Mac OS X frameworks are also stored as bundles; the top-level directory of a framework bundle has a name that is the name of the framework followed by the extension &lt;tt&gt;.framework&lt;/tt&gt;.  In the top-level directory is a &lt;tt&gt;Versions&lt;/tt&gt; directory, with subdirectories for one or more versions of the framework, each subdirectory containing the dynamic library code for the framework, in a file whose name is the same as the name of the framework, possibly with a &lt;tt&gt;Headers&lt;/tt&gt; folder containing [[header file]]s for the framework, and other subfolders such as &lt;tt&gt;Resources&lt;/tt&gt;.  The &lt;tt&gt;Versions&lt;/tt&gt; directory also contains a symbolic link &lt;tt&gt;Current&lt;/tt&gt; to the directory for the current version of the framework. In the top-level directory are symbolic links to the contents of &lt;tt&gt;Versions/Current&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anatomy of Framework Bundles|url=http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/MacOSX/Conceptual/BPFrameworks/Concepts/FrameworkAnatomy.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=2011-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Mac OS X loadable bundles==
Loadable bundles are bundles which contain code that can be loaded at runtime.&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.apple.com/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingCode/Concepts/AboutLoadableBundles.html Code Loading Programming Topics for Cocoa: About Loadable Bundles&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Loadable bundles usually have the extension &lt;tt&gt;.bundle&lt;/tt&gt; and are most often used as [[plug-in (computing)|plug-ins]]. An example of an application that traditionally supports bundles is [[Apple Mail]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tikouka.net/mailapp/ Apple Mail plug-ins and tools&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://hawkwings.net/plugins.htm Hawk Wings &amp;mdash; Plug-ins for Apple Mail&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On Mac OS X there is a way to load bundles even into applications that don't support them allowing for third party hacks for popular applications such as [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://pimpmysafari.com/plugins/ Pimp My Safari: plugins&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other bundle formats==
There are many third-party Mac OS X applications which utilize their own custom bundle format (e.g. [[CandyBar]]'s &lt;tt&gt;.iContainer&lt;/tt&gt; bundles).

==.lproj==
&lt;!-- Merged from [[.lproj]] --&gt;
An '''.lproj''' file is a bundle that contains [[software localization|localization]] files for [[Mac OS X]] software. It typically contains the [[.nib]] files for a given language along with string files and images if need be (for example, [[ReadMe]] or license files). These localized files are used by install makers to customize install packages. They are also included into an application bundle.
