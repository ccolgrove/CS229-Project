'''Experiments involving non-human primates''' (NHPs) include [[toxicity]] testing for medical and non-medical substances; studies of [[infectious disease]], such as [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis]]; neurological studies; behavior and cognition; reproduction; [[genetics]]; and [[xenotransplantation]]. Around 65,000â70,000 are used every year in the United States and European Union. Most are purpose-bred, while some are caught in the wild.&lt;ref name=USEUnumbers&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/ac/awreports/awreport2004.pdf &quot;Animals used in research&quot;], U.S. Department of Agriculture, p. 10; [http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/basicfacts.html &quot;Primates, Basic facts&quot;], [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Their use is controversial. According to the [[Nuffield Council on Bioethics]], NHPs are used because their brains share structural and functional features with human brains, but &quot;[w]hile this similarity has scientific advantages, it poses some difficult ethical problems, because of an increased likelihood that primates experience pain and suffering in ways that are similar to humans.&quot;&lt;ref name=Nuffield&gt;{{cite book|title=The ethics of research involving animals|publisher=Nuffield Council on Bioethics|url=http://www.nuffieldbioethics.org/go/browseablepublications/ethicsofresearchanimals/report_230.html|accessdate=2008-07-16|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the most publicized attacks on animal research facilities by animal rights groups have occurred because of primate research. Some primate researchers have abandoned their studies because of threats or attacks.

In December 2006, an inquiry chaired by Sir [[David Weatherall]], emeritus professor of medicine at [[Oxford University]], concluded that there is a &quot;strong scientific and moral case&quot; for using primates in some research.&lt;ref name=Morelle&gt;Morelle, Rebecca. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6161317.stm &quot;UK experts back primate research&quot;], BBC News, December 12, 2006. &lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] argues that the Weatherall report failed to address &quot;the welfare needs and moral case for subjecting these sensitive, intelligent creatures to a lifetime of suffering in UK labs.&quot;&lt;ref name=Morelle/&gt;

==Legal status==
Human beings are recognized as [[person]]s and protected in law by the [[United Nations]] [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref name=UN&gt;[http://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html UN Declaration of Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt; and by all governments to varying degrees. Non-human primates are not classified as persons, which largely means their individual interests have no formal recognition or protection. The status of non-human primates has generated much debate, particularly through the [[Great Ape Project]] (GAP), which argues that great apes (gorillas, orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos) be given limited legal status and the protection of three basic interests: the right to live, the protection of individual liberty, and the prohibition of torture.&lt;ref name=GA&gt;[http://www.greatapeproject.org/declaration.php &quot;Declaration on Great Apes&quot;], Great Ape Project.&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 25, 2008, Spain became the first country to announce that it will extend rights to the [[great ape]]s in accordance with GAP's proposals. An all-party parliamentary group advised the government to write legislation giving chimpanzees, bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans the right to life, to liberty, and the right not to be used in experiments. ''The New York Times'' reported that the legislation will make it illegal to kill apes, except in self-defense. &quot;Torture,&quot; which will include medical experiments, will be not allowed, as will arbitrary imprisonment, such as for circuses or films.&lt;ref&gt;McNeil, Donald G.

In December 2005, Austria outlawed experiments on any apes, unless it is conducted in the interests of the individual animal. In 2002, Belgium announced that it was working toward a ban on all primate use, and in the UK, 103 MPs signed an [[Early Day Motion]] calling for an end to primate experiments, arguing that they cause suffering and are unreliable.&lt;ref name=Langley12&gt;[[Gill Langley|Langley, Gill]]. &quot;The Use of Primates in Experiments&quot;, British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, June 2006, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; No licenses have been issued in the UK since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;Testing on apes 'might be needed'&quot;&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/5043328.stm &quot;Testing on apes 'might be needed'&quot;], BBC News, June 3, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boyd Group]], a British group comprising animal researchers, philosophers, primatologists, and animal advocates, has recommended a global prohibition on the use of great apes.&lt;ref name=Boyd&gt;&quot;The Boyd Group Papers on the use of Non-Human Primates in research and testing&quot;, The Boyd Group, British Psychological Society, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, the British [[Animal Procedures Committee]] recommended new measures for dealing with NHPs. The use of wild-caught primates was banned, except where &quot;exceptional and specific justification can be established&quot;; specific justification must be made for the use of old world primates (but not for the use of new world primates); approval for the acquisition of primates from overseas is conditional upon their breeding or supply center being acceptable to the Home Office; and each batch of primates acquired from overseas must be separately authorized.&lt;ref name=GB87&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm67/6713/6713.pdf &quot;Statistics of Scientific Procedures on Living Animals&quot;], Great Britain, 2004, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Prevalence===
There are indications that NHP use is on the rise,&lt;ref name=Conlee2004/&gt; in part because biomedical research funds in the U.S. have more than doubled since the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aaas.org/spp/rd/hhs03s.pdf &quot;Senate completes NIH doubling in 2003&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the NIH published a report&lt;ref&gt;Full Scale Evaluation of the Regional Primate Research Centers ProgramâFinal Report (Office of Science Policy and Public Liaison, National Center for Research Resources/NIH. 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; recommending that the Regional Primate Research Center System be renamed the National Primate Research Center System and calling for an increase in the number of NHPs available to researchers, and stated that &quot;nonhuman primates are crucial for certain types of biomedical and behavioral research.&quot; This assertion has been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.curedisease.com/Pathways/PathwaysFall03.pdf &quot;Is Primate-Modeled Research ''Crucial''?

The American Society of Primatologists writes that most NHPs in laboratories in the United States are bred domestically. Between 12,000â15,000 are imported each year, specifically rhesus macaque monkeys, cynomolgus (crab-eating) macaque monkeys, squirrel monkeys, owl monkeys, and baboons. Monkeys are imported from the China, Mauritius, Israel, the Philippines, and Peru.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asp.org/research/faq.html#q4 &quot;Where do primates used for research purposes come from?&quot;], American Society of Primatologists.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10774.html International Perspectives: The Future of Nonhuman Primate Resources, Proceedings of the Workshop Held April 17â19]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, an estimated 70% of research primates are imported, and the rest are purpose-bred in Europe. Around 74% of these imports come from China, with most of the rest coming from Mauritius and Israel. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog/10774.html International Perspectives: The Future of Nonhuman Primate Resources, Proceedings of the Workshop Held April 17â19, pp. 63â68].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use==
===General===
NHPs are used in research into HIV, neurology, behavior, cognition, reproduction, Parkinson's disease, stroke, malaria, respiratory viruses, infectious disease, genetics, xenotransplantation, drug abuse, and also in vaccine and drug testing. According to The Humane Society of the United States, chimpanzees are most often used in hepatitis research, and monkeys in [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] research. Animals used in hepatitis and SIV studies are often caged alone.&lt;ref name=Conlee2004/&gt;

Eighty-two percent of primate procedures in the UK in 2006 were in applied studies, which the Home Office defines as research conducted for the purpose of developing or testing commercial products.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/spanimals06.pdf Home Office Statistics 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Toxicology testing is the largest use, which includes legislatively required testing of drugs.&lt;ref name=Langley33&gt;Langley, Gill. [http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/report.html &quot;Next of Kin: A Report on the Use of Primates in Experiments&quot;], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, June 2006, p.33-34.&lt;/ref&gt; The second largest category of research using primates is &quot;protection of man, animals, or environment&quot;, accounting for 8.9% of all procedures in 2006. The third largest category is &quot;fundamental biological research,&quot;, accounting for 4.9% of all UK primate procedures in 2006. This includes neuroscientific study of the visual system, cognition, and diseases such as Parkinson's,&lt;ref name=Langley37&gt;Langley, Gill. [http://www.buav.org/campaigns/primates/report.html &quot;Next of Kin: A Report on the Use of Primates in Experiments&quot;], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, June 2006, p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; involving techniques such as inserting electrodes to record from or stimulate the brain, and temporary or permanent inactivation of areas of tissue.

Primates are the species most likely to be re-used in experiments. The Research Defence Society writes that re-use is allowed if the animals have been used in mild procedures with no lasting side-effects. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/news.asp?i_ToolbarID=6&amp;i_PageID=1784 &quot;Scientific study of primate research â call for evidence], Research Defence Society, March 24, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; This is contradicted by Dr. [[Gill Langley]] of the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]], who gives as an example of re-use the licence granted to Cambridge University to conduct [[neuroscience|brain experiments]] on [[marmoset]]s. The protocol sheet stated that the animals would receive &quot;multiple interventions as part of the whole lesion/graft repair procedure.&quot; Under the protocol, a marmoset could be given acute brain lesions under general anaesthetic, followed by tissue implantation under a second general anaesthetic, followed again central cannula implantation under a third. The re-use is allowable when required to meet scientific goals, such as this case in which some procedures are required as preparatory for others. &lt;ref name=Langley32&gt;[[Gill Langley|Langley, Gill]]. &quot;Next of Kin: A Report on the Use of Primates in Experiments,&quot; British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, June 2006, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methods of restraint===
[[Image:Primate-in-cage-restraint.jpeg|left|thumb|150px|A primate trained to place his head and hands in holes in the front of his cage. The holes are placed in such a way as to allow the primate to reach for food while presenting his head for the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;Reinhardt, Viktor and Cowley, Doug. [http://www.brown.edu/Research/Primate/lpn29-4.html Training Stumptailed Monkeys (Macaca arctoides) to Cooperate during In-Homecage Treatment], Laboratory Primate Newsletter, Volume 29, number 4, October 4, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
One of the disadvantages of using NHPs is that they can be difficult to handle, and various methods of physical restraint have to be used. Viktor Reinhardt of the Wisconsin Regional Primate Research Center writes that scientists may be unaware of the way in which their research animals are handled, and therefore fail to take into account the effect the handling may have had on the animals' health, and thereby on any data collected. Reinhardt writes that primatologists have long recognized that restraint methods may introduce an &quot;uncontrolled methodological variable&quot;, by producing resistance and fear in the animal. &quot;Numerous reports have been published demonstrating that non-human primates can readily be trained to cooperate rather than resist during common handling procedures such as capture, venipuncture, injection and veterinary examination. Cooperative animals fail to show behavioural and physiological signs of distress.&quot; &lt;ref name=Reinhardt&gt;Reinhardt, V. et al. [http://www.awionline.org/Lab_animals/biblio/aw6metho.htm &quot;Restraint methods of laboratory non-human primates: a critical review&quot;], ''Animal Welfare'' 1995, 4: 221â238.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reinhardt lists common restraint methods as: squeeze-back cages, manual restraint, restraint boards, restraint chairs, restraint chutes, tethering, and nets.&lt;ref name=Reinhardt/&gt; Alternatives include:
*chemical restraint; for example, ketamine, a sedative, may be given to the animal before a restraint procedure, reducing stress-hormone production;
*psychological support, in which an animal under restraint has visual and auditory contact with the animal's cage-mate. Blood pressure and heart rate responses to restraint have been measurably reduced using psychological support.
*training animals to cooperate with restraint. Such methods have been used and resulted in unmeasurable stress hormone responses to venipuncture, and no notable distress to being captured in a transport box. &lt;ref name=Reinhardt/&gt;

===Chimpanzees in the U.S.===
[[Image:NASAchimp.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Enos (chimpanzee)|Enos the space chimp]] before being inserted into the [[Mercury-Atlas 5]] capsule in 1961.]]
There are around 1133 [[chimpanzees]] in research laboratories in the United States as of October 2006, and this number has been monotonically decreasing since the breeding ban of 1996.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt; Many have been used in hepatitis research, often caged alone because of the design of the research protocol. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/monkeys_and_apes_in_research/an_introduction_to_primate_issues.html &quot;An Introduction to Primate Issues&quot;], The Humane Society of the United States.

Chimps routinely live 30 years in captivity, and can reach 60 years of age.&lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;

Most of the labs either conduct or make the chimps available for invasive research,&lt;ref name=HSUSmap&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/research/chimpanzee-lab-and-sanctuary-map.html Chimpanzee lab and sanctuary map], Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; defined as &quot;inoculation with an infectious agent, surgery or biopsy conducted for the sake of research and not for the sake of the chimpanzee, and/or drug testing.&quot;&lt;ref name=HSUSresearch&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/research/overview_of_research_uses_and.html Chimpanzee Research: Overview of Research Uses and Costs], Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; Two federally funded laboratories use chimps: [[Yerkes National Primate Research Center]] at [[Emory University]] in Atlanta, Georgia, and the [[Southwest National Primate Center]] in San Antonio, Texas.&lt;ref name=Lovgren&gt;Lovgren, Stefan. [http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2005/09/0906_050906_chimplabs.html Should Labs Treat Chimps More Like Humans?], ''National Geographic News'', September 6, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Five hundred chimps have been retired from laboratory use in the U.S. and live in sanctuaries in the U.S. or Canada.&lt;ref name=HSUSmap/&gt;

Their importation from the wild was banned in 1973. From then until 1996, chimpanzees in U.S. facilities were bred domestically. Some others were transferred from the entertainment industry to animal testing facilities as recently as 1983, although it is not known if any animals that were transferred from the entertainment industry are still in testing centers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.neavs.org/programs/brochures/brochures_chimp.htm See Sue Ellen (#440) and Billy Jo (#447)]&lt;/ref&gt; Animal sanctuaries were not an option until the first North American sanctuary that would accept chimps opened in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildlifewaystation.org/wws/about/item.php?id=3 Wildlife Waystation Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, to prepare for research on AIDS, the U.S. bred them aggressively, with 315 breeding chimpanzees used to produce 400 offspring. By 1996, it was clear that SIV/HIV-2/SHIV in macaque monkeys was a preferred scientific AIDS model to the chimps, which meant there was a surplus. A five-year moratorium on breeding was therefore imposed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) that year, and it has been extended annually since 2001. As of October 2006, the chimp population in US laboratories had declined to 1133 from a peak of 1500 in 1996. &lt;ref name=sciencemag/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt;

Chimpanzees tend to be used repeatedly over decades, rather than used and killed as with most laboratory animals. Some individual chimps currently in U.S. laboratories have been used in experiments for over 40 years.&lt;ref name=HSUSbetter&gt;[http://www.hsus.org/animals_in_research/chimps_deserve_better/ Chimps Deserve Better], Humane Society of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest known chimp in a U.S. lab is Wenka, who was born in a laboratory in Florida on May 21, 1954. She was removed from her mother on the day of birth to be used in a vision experiment that lasted 17 months, then sold as a pet to a family in North Carolina. She was returned to the Yerkes National Primate Research Center in 1957 when she became too big to handle. Since then, she has given birth six times, and has been used in research into alcohol use, oral contraceptives, aging, and cognitive studies.&lt;ref name=R&amp;RWenka&gt;[http://www.releasechimps.org/chimpanzees/their-stories/wenka/ Wenka], Project R&amp;R, New England Anti-Vivisection Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the publication of the [[chimpanzee genome]], there are reportedly plans to increase the use of chimps in labs, with scientists arguing that the federal moratorium on breeding chimps for research should be lifted.&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt;&lt;ref name=Langley15&gt;[[Gill Langley|Langley, Gill]]. [http://www.eceae.org/english/documents/NoKReport.pdf Next of Kin: A Report on the Use of Primates in Experiments], British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection, p. 15, citing VandeBerg, JL et al. &quot;A unique biomedical resource at risk,&quot; Nature 437:30â32.&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers argue that chimps are unique animals and should either not be used in research, or should be treated differently. Pascal Gagneux, an evolutionary biologist and primate expert at the [[University of California, San Diego]], argues that, given chimpanzees' sense of self, tool use, and genetic similarity to human beings, studies using chimps should follow the ethical guidelines that are used for human subjects unable to give consent.&lt;ref name=Lovgren/&gt; Stuart Zola, director of the Yerkes National Primate Research Laboratory, disagrees.

==Notable studies==
===Polio===
In the 1940s, [[Jonas Salk]] used Rhesus monkey cross-contamination studies to isolate the three forms of the [[polio]] virus that crippled hundreds of thousands of people yearly across the world at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[www.post-gazette.com/pg/05093/481117.stm Virus-typing of polio by Salk].&lt;/ref&gt; Salk's team created a vaccine against the strains of polio in cell cultures of [[Green monkey]] kidney cells. The vaccine was made publicly available in 1955, and reduced the incidence of polio 15-fold in the USA over the following five years. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05094/482468.stm Salk polio virus]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Sabin]] made a superior &quot;live&quot; vaccine by passing the polio virus through animal hosts, including monkeys. The vaccine was produced for mass consumption in 1963 and is still in use today. It had virtually eradicated polio in the USA by 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/polio/virusvaccine/vacraces2.htm History of polio vaccine]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Split-brain experiments===
In the 1950s, [[Roger Sperry]] developed split-brain preparations in non-human primates that emphasized the importance of information transfer that occurred in these neocortical connections. For example, learning on simple tasks, if restricted in sensory input and motor output to one hemisphere of a split-brain animal, would not transfer to the other hemisphere. The right brain has no idea what the left brain is up to, if these specific connections are cut. Those experiments were followed by tests on human beings with [[epilepsy]] who had undergone split-brain surgery, which established that the neocortical connections between hemispheres are the principal route for cognition to transfer from one side of the brain to another. These experiments also formed the modern basis for lateralization of function in the human brain.

===Vision experiments===
In the 1960s, [[David Hubel]] and [[Torsten Wiesel]] demonstrated the macrocolumnar organization of visual areas in cats and monkeys, and provided physiological evidence for the [[critical period]] for the development of disparity sensitivity in vision (i.e., the main cue for depth perception). They were awarded a Nobel Prize for their work.

===Deep-brain stimulation===
In 1983, designer drug users took MPTP, which created a Parkinsonian syndrome. Later that same year, researchers reproduced the effect in non-human primates. Over the next seven years, the brain areas that were over- and under-active in Parkinson's were mapped out in normal and MPTP-treated macaque monkeys using metabolic labelling and microelectrode studies. In 1990, deep brain lesions were shown to treat Parkinsonian symptoms in macaque monkeys treated with MPTP, and these were followed by pallidotomy operations in humans with similar efficacy. By 1993, it was shown that deep brain stimulation could effect the same treatment without causing a permanent lesion of the same magnitude. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parkinsonsappeal.com/pdfs/The%20History%20of%20Deep%20Brain%20Stimulation.pdf &quot;The History of Deep Brain Simulation&quot;] (Overview of development of DBS in Parkinson's) at &quot;The Parkinson's Appeal for Deep Brain Simulation.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Deep brain stimulation]] has largely replaced pallidotomy for treatment of Parkinson's patients that require neurosurgical intervention. Current estimates are that 20,000 Parkinson's patients have received this treatment.

===AIDS===
The non-human primate models of AIDS, using HIV-2, SHIV, and SIV in macaques, have been used as a complement to ongoing research efforts against the virus. The drug [[tenofovir]] has had its efficacy and toxicology evaluated in macaques, and found longterm-highdose treatments had adverse effects not found using shortterm-highdose treatment followed by longterm-lowdose treatment. This finding in macaques was translated into human dosing regimens. Prophylactic treatment with anti-virals has been evaluated in macaques, because introduction of the virus can only be controlled in an animal model. The finding that prophylaxis can be effective at blocking infection has altered the treatment for occupational exposures, such as needle exposures. Such exposures are now followed rapidly with anti-HIV drugs, and this practice has resulted in measurable transient virus infection similar to the NHP model. Similarly, the mother-to-fetus transmission, and its fetal prophylaxis with antivirals such as tenofovir and AZT, has been evaluated in controlled testing in macaques not possible in humans, and this knowledge has guided antiviral treatment in pregnant mothers with HIV. &quot;The comparison and correlation of results obtained in monkey and human studies is leading to a growing validation and recognition of the relevance of the animal model. Although each animal model has its limitations, carefully designed drug studies in nonhuman primates can continue to advance our scientific knowledge and guide future clinical trials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aidsreviews.com/files/2005_7_2_67_83.pdf AIDS Reviews 2005;7:67â83 Antiretroviral Drug Studies in Nonhuman Primates: a Valid Animal Model for Innovative Drug Efficacy and Pathogenesis Experiments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/cdc/tb165.html PMPA blocks SIV in monkeys]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thebody.com/bp/dec99/medical.html PMPA is tenofovir]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations==
Many of the best-known allegations of abuse made by animal protection or animal rights groups against animal-testing facilities involve NHPs.

===University of WisconsinâMadison===
{{main|Pit of despair}}
The so-called &quot;pit of despair&quot; was used in experiments conducted on [[rhesus macaque]] monkeys during the 1970s by American [[Comparative psychology|comparative psychologist]] [[Harry Harlow]] at the [[University of WisconsinâMadison]]. &lt;ref name=Blum1994/95&gt;Blum, Deborah. ''The Monkey Wars''. Oxford University Press, 1994, p.&amp;nbsp;95.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the research was to produce [[clinical depression]]. The vertical chamber was a stainless-steel bin with slippery sides that sloped to a rounded bottom. A 3/8 in. wire mesh floor 1 in. above the bottom of the chamber allowed waste material to drop out of holes. The chamber had a food box and a water-bottle holder, and was covered with a pyramid top so that the monkeys were unable to escape. &lt;ref name=Suomi1971/33&gt;Suomi, Stephen John. ''Experimental Production of Depressive Behavior in Young Rhesus Monkeys: A thesis submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy (Psychology) at the University of WisconsinâMadison''.  University of WisconsinâMadison, 1971, p.&amp;nbsp;33.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; Harlow placed baby monkeys in the chamber alone for up to six weeks. Within a few days, they stopped moving about and remained huddled in a corner.  The monkeys generally exhibited marked social impairment and peer hostility when removed from the chamber; most did not recover.

===University of California, Riverside===
[[Image:Eyesewn.jpg|right|thumb|120px|[[Britches (monkey)|Britches]], as the [[Animal Liberation Front|ALF]] say they found him in [[University of California, Riverside|UC Riverside]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cjonline.org/animalsDissection2Britches.htm&lt;/ref&gt; ]]
{{main|Britches (monkey)}}
On April 21, 1985, activists of the Animal Liberation Front (ALF) broke into the UC Riverside laboratories and removed hundreds of animals. According to Vicky Miller of PETA, who reported the raid to newswire services, UC-Riverside &quot;has been using animals in experiments on sight deprivation and isolation for the last two years and has recently received a grant, paid for with our tax dollars, to continue torturing and killing animals.&quot;  According to UCR officials, the ALF claims of animal mistreatment were &quot;absolutely false,&quot; and the raid would  result in long-term damage to some of the research projects, including those aimed at developing devices and treatment for blindness. UCR officials also reported  the raid also included smashing equipment and resulted in several hundred thousand dollars of damage.

===Covance===
{{main|Covance}}
[[Image:600-restraint-tube4.jpg|left|thumb|180px|A monkey in a restraint tube filmed by [[PETA]] in Covance, [[Vienna, Virginia]], 2004â2005. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.covancecruelty.com/photos.asp&lt;/ref&gt;]]
In Germany in 2004, journalist Friedrich MÃ¼lln took undercover footage of staff in [[Covance]] in MÃ¼nster, Europe's largest primate-testing center. Staff were filmed handling monkeys roughly, screaming at them, and making them dance to blaring music. The monkeys were shown isolated in small wire cages with little or no natural light, no environmental enrichment, and subjected to high noise levels from staff shouting and playing the radio. &lt;ref name=Munstervideo&gt;[http://www.petatv.com/tvpopup/Prefs.asp?video=covance Undercover footage of staff in Covance screaming at and mocking monkeys], video.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Primatology|Primatologist]] [[Jane Goodall]] described their living conditions as &quot;horrendous.&quot;

A veterinary toxicologist employed as a study director at Covance in [[Vienna, Virginia]], from 2002 to 2004, told city officials in [[Chandler, Arizona]], that Covance was dissecting monkeys while the animals were still alive and able to feel pain. The employee approached the city with her concerns when she learned that Covance planned to build a new laboratory in Chandler.&lt;ref name=studydirector&gt;[http://www.peta.org/Automation/NewsItem.asp?id=9261 &quot;Former Study Director Reports Hideous, Systematic Cruelty at Covance; PETA Calls For Federal Investigation of Alleged Atrocities&quot;], People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, November 28, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

She alleged that three monkeys in the Vienna laboratory had pushed themselves up on their elbows and had gasped for breath after their eyes had been removed, and while their intestines were being removed during [[Necropsy|necropsies]] (autopsy). When she expressed concern at the next study directors' meeting, she says she was told that it was just a reflex. She told city officials that she believed such movements were not reflexes but suggested &quot;botched [[euthanasia]] performed by inadequately trained personnel.&quot;&lt;ref name=studydirector/&gt; She alleged that she was ridiculed and subjected to thinly veiled threats when she contacted her supervisors about the issue.

===University of Cambridge===
[[Image:BUAVCambridge2.jpg|left|thumb|120px|[[BUAV]] alleges that monkeys were left unattended for up to 15 hours after having parts of their brains removed to induce strokes.&lt;ref name=Laville&gt;Laville, Sandra. [http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1407818,00.html &quot;Lab monkeys 'scream with fear' in tests&quot;] ''The Guardian'', February 8, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

{{main|Primate experiments at Cambridge University}}
In the UK, after an undercover investigation in 1998, the [[British Union for the Abolition of Vivisection]] (BUAV), a lobby group, reported that researchers in [[Primate experiments at Cambridge University|Cambridge University's primate-testing labs]] were sawing the tops off marmosets' heads, inducing strokes, then leaving them overnight without veterinarian care, because staff worked only nine to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,1407818,00.html | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Lab monkeys 'scream with fear' in tests | first=Sandra | last=Laville | date=February 8, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The experiments used marmosets that were first trained to perform certain [[behavior]]al and [[Cognition|cognitive]] tasks, then re-tested after brain damage to determine how the damage had affected their skills. The monkeys were deprived of food and water to encourage them to perform the tasks, with water being withheld for 22 out of every 24 hours.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buav.org/undercover/cambridge.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.buav.org/zerooption/video/lessi.mpg&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Research Defence Society]] defended Cambridge's research. The RDS wrote that the monkeys were fully anaesthetised, and appropriate pain killers were given after the surgery. &quot;On recovery from the anaesthesia, the monkeys were kept in an incubator, offered food and water and monitored at regular intervals until the early evening. They were then allowed to sleep in the incubators until the next morning. No monkeys died unattended during the night after stroke surgery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rds-online.org.uk/pages/news.asp?i_ToolbarID=6&amp;i_PageID=1816&lt;/ref&gt; A court rejected BUAV's application for a judicial review. BUAV appealed.&lt;ref&gt;http://scienceandresearch.homeoffice.gov.uk/animal-research/publications/publications/reports-and-reviews/chief_insp_animals_review.pdf?view=Standard&amp;pubID=236685&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/530.html&amp;query=buav&amp;method=all&lt;/ref&gt;{{Update after|2011|8|11}}

===Columbia University===
{{main|Primate experiments at Columbia University}}
In 2003, CNN reported that a post-doctoral [[veterinarian]] at [[Columbia University]] complained to the university's Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee about experiments being conducted on baboons by E. Sander Connolly, an assistant professor of [[neurosurgery]].&lt;ref&gt; Sander Connolly [http://www.columbianeurosurgery.org/doctors/e-sander-connolly-jr/]&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment involved a left transorbital craniectomy to expose the left internal carotid artery to occlude the blood supply to the brain.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahajournals2000&quot;&gt; &quot;A Modified Transorbital Baboon Model of Reperfused Stroke&quot; Huang (2000)[http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/31/12/3054] &lt;/ref&gt; A clamp was placed on this blood vessel until the stroke was induced, after which Connolly would test a potential neuroprotective drug which if effective, would be used to treat humans suffering from stroke.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;Collaboration may be the cure for what ails drug development&quot; Erickson (2003)[http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v10/n6/full/nm0604-558b.html] &lt;/ref&gt; Connolly developed this methodology to make more consistent stroke infarcts in primates, which would improve the detection of differences in stroke treatment groups, and  &quot;provide important information not obtainable in rodent models.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;A Modified Transorbital Baboon Model of Reperfused Stroke&quot; Huang (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; The baboons were kept alive after the surgery for observation for three to ten days in a state of &quot;profound disability&quot; which would  have been &quot;terrifying,&quot; according to neurologist Robert Hoffman.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman (2003)[http://www.columbiacruelty.com/letters/hoffman.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; Connolly's published animal model states that animals were kept alive for three days, and that animals that were successfully self-caring were kept alive for 10 days.&lt;ref name=&quot;ahajournals2000&quot;/&gt; [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]] has expressed strong opposition to this experiment and has written multiple letters to the NIH and other federal agencies to halt further mistreatment of baboons and other animals at Columbia.&lt;ref&gt; Letter to the Office of Laboratory Animal Welfare [http://www.columbiacruelty.com/letters/OLAW.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Letter to the USDA [http://www.columbiacruelty.com/letters/USDA0924.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found &quot;no indication that the experiments...violated federal guidelines.&quot; The Dean of Research at Columbia's School of Medicine said that Connolly had stopped the experiments because of threats from animal rights activists, but still believed his work was humane and potentially valuable.

===Attacks on researchers===
In 2006, activists forced a primate researcher at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] to shut down the experiments in his lab. His name, phone number, and address were posted on the website of the UCLA [[Primate Freedom Project]], along with a description of his research, which stated that he had &quot;received a grant to kill 30 [[macaque]] monkeys for vision experiments. Each monkey is first paralyzed, then used for a single session that lasts up to 120 hours, and finally killed.&quot; [http://www.uclaprimatefreedom.com/] Demonstrations were held outside his home. A [[Molotov cocktail]] was placed on the porch of what was believed to be the home of another UCLA primate researcher. Instead, it was accidentally left on the porch of an elderly woman unrelated to the university. The [[Animal Liberation Front]] claimed responsibility for the attack. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.kxmb.com/getARticle.asp?ArticleId=36447&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/08/22/animal&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of the campaign, the researcher sent an email to the Primate Freedom Project stating &quot;you win,&quot; and &quot;please donât bother my family anymore.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.investors.com/editorial/editorialcontent.asp?secid=1501&amp;status=article&amp;id=241311597601024&lt;/ref&gt; In another incident at UCLA in June 2007, the [[Revolutionary Cells (RCALB)|Animal Liberation Brigade]] placed a bomb under the car of a UCLA children's [[ophthalmologist]], who performs experiments on cats and rhesus monkeys; the bomb had a faulty fuse and did not detonate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laweekly.com/news/news/monkey-madness-at-ucla/16986/] UCLA Monkey Madness&lt;/ref&gt; UCLA is now refusing [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests for animal medical records.

The house of UCLA researcher Edythe London was intentionally flooded on October 20, 2007, in an attack claimed by the Animal Liberation Front. London conducts research on addiction using non-human primates, although no claims were made by the ALF of any violation of any rules or regulations regarding the use of animals in research. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailybruin.ucla.edu/news/2007/nov/01/faculty-attack-case-goes/] Daily Bruin, UCLA Paper, on London incident&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.animalliberationpressoffice.org/communiques/2007-10-25_uclalondon.htm] ALF Communique on London incident&lt;/ref&gt; London responded by writing an [[op-ed]] column in the ''LA Times'' titled &quot;Why I use laboratory animals.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/asection/la-oe-london1nov01,1,4783367.story?coll=la-news-a_section] Why I use Animals, LA Times Op-Ed by Dr. London&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a UCLA neurobiologist had his car firebombed, for the second time. http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2009/03/the-fbi-federal.html
