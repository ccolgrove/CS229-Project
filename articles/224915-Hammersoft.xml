{{See|Geography of North America}}
The '''Great Basin''' is the largest area of [[:wiktionary:contiguous|contiguous]] [[Endorheic basin|endorheic watersheds]] in [[North America]] and is noted for its arid conditions and [[Basin and Range]] topography that varies from the North American low point at [[Badwater Basin]] to the highest point of the [[contiguous United States]], less than {{convert|100|mi|km}} away at the summit of [[Mount Whitney]]. The region spans several [[physical geography|physiographic]] divisions, [[biome]]s/[[ecoregion]]s, and [[desert]]s, and is the ancestral homeland of the [[Great Basin tribes]].

==Geography==
[[File:GB-Definition-Map.jpg|thumb|The Great Basin (magenta outline) differs from the [[Great Basin Province]], the [[Great Basin tribes]] area, the [[Basin and Range Province]], and the [[Basin and Range]] area.]]
{{For|the subdivisions of the Great Basin|List of Great Basin watersheds}}
The Great Basin includes [[Basin and Range Province|valleys, basins, lakes, and mountain ranges]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2004 |title=Basin and Range Province |url=http://geomaps.wr.usgs.gov/parks/province/basinrange.html  |work=Geologic Provinces of the United States |publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]] |accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Basin and Range topography. The Great Basin almost entirely contains the smaller [[Great Basin section|Great Basin physiographic section]], which extends about {{convert|10000|sqmi|abbr=on}} into the [[Colorado River]] watershed (including the [[Las Vegas metropolitan area]] and northwest corner of [[Arizona]]). Geographic features near the Great Basin include the [[Continental Divide of the Americas]], the [[Great Divide Basin]], and the [[Gulf of California]].

The Great Basin's two most populous metropolitan areas are [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]] to the west and [[Salt Lake City]] on the east side. The area between these two cities is sparsely populated, but includes the smaller cities of [[Delta, Utah|Delta]], [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]], [[Ely, Nevada|Ely]], [[Tonopah, Nevada|Tonopah]], [[Wendover, Utah|Wendover]], [[West Wendover, Nevada|West Wendover]], and [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]]. The southern area of the basin has the communities of [[Palmdale]], [[Victorville]], and [[Palm Springs]]. Major roadways traversing the Great Basin include [[Interstate 80]], [[Interstate 15]], [[U.S. Route 6]], [[U.S. Route 50]], [[U.S. Route 93]], [[U.S. Route 95]] and [[U.S. Route 395]], with the Nevada section of U.S. Route 50 nicknamed &quot;The Loneliest Road in America&quot;.&lt;ref name=ncot&gt;{{cite web |url = http://travelnevada.com/documents/guides/survival_guide.pdf |title = The Official Hwy 50 Survival Guide&amp;nbsp;â The Loneliest Road in America |accessdate = 2007-12-15 |publisher = Nevada Commission on Tourism |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Railroad transportation routes also pass through Reno and Salt Lake City.{{Dubious|Not notable relative to Great Basin--railroads pass through lots of Great Basin communities|date=October 2011}}

===Hydrology===
[[File:WahWah.JPG|thumb|left|[[Wah Wah Valley]], [[Utah]], thunderstorm{{Dubious|Why is an image of a thunderstorm notable?|date=October 2011}}]]
[[Image:WheelerSnow.JPG|thumb|left|Great Basin snowstorm in the [[Snake Valley (Great Basin)|Snake Valley]] of Utah and Nevada]]
The [[Great Basin Divide]] separates the Great Basin from the watersheds draining to the Pacific Ocean. The southernmost portion of the Great Basin is the watershed area of the [[Laguna Salada (Mexico)|Laguna Salada]]. The Great Basin's longest and largest river is the [[Bear River (Utah)|Bear River]] of {{convert|350|mi|km|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=Bear&gt;{{cite web |title=Bear River Watershed Description |url=http://www.bearriverinfo.org/description/ |publisher=[[Bear River (Utah)|Bear River]] Watershed Information System |accessdate=2010-04-28}} (an additional ~1% is in the SW corner of WY)&lt;/ref&gt; and the largest single watershed is the [[Humboldt River]] drainage of roughly {{convert|17000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}. Most Great Basin precipitation is snow, and the precipitation that neither evaporates nor is taken for human use will sink into [[groundwater]] [[aquifer]]s, while evaporation of collected water occurs from [[sink (geography)|geographic sinks]].&lt;ref name=NPS&gt;{{cite web |title=Great Basin |url=http://www.nature.nps.gov/Geology/usgsnps/province/brgrbas.html |work=Geologic Provinces of the United States: Basin and Range Province |location=nature.nps.gov |publisher=[[National Park Service]] |accessdate=2009-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lake Tahoe]], North America's largest [[alpine lake]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Amazing Lake Tahoe |url=http://www.bluelaketahoe.com/page.php?p=amaz&amp;l=1 |publisher=Lake Tahoe Visitors Authority |accessdate=2008-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; is part of the Great Basin's central [[Lake Lahontan|Lahontan]] subregion.  Great Basin named deserts include the [[Black Rock Desert]], the [[Great Salt Lake Desert]], the [[Sevier Lake|Sevier Desert]], the [[Smoke Creek Desert]], [[Nevada salt deserts]] in the [[Great Basin Province]], the [[Mojave Desert]], and part of the [[Sonoran Desert]].

[[File:TuleHorses.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Tule Valley, Utah|Tule Valley watershed]] and the [[House Range]] ([[Notch Peak]]) are part of the Great Basin's Great Salt Lake [[Hydrological code#United States|hydrologic unit]]]]

==Ecology==
Although mostly within the [[North American Desert]] ecoregion, portions of the Great Basin extend into the [[List of ecoregions in the United States (EPA)|Forested Mountain and Mediterranean California]] ecoregions.  The [[semi-arid climate|semi-arid areas]] of the [[List of ecoregions in North America (CEC)|Forested Mountain ecoregion]] include the [[White Mountains (California)|White Mountains]] and [[Inyo Mountains]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} Extending north of the [[42nd parallel north]], the [[Northern Basin and Range (ecoregion)]] has its southern border at the highest shoreline of the [[Pleistocene]] [[Lake Bonneville]]. The south edge of the Central Basin and Range ecoregion is in Nevada, north of the south edge of the [[Great Basin section]].

===Fauna===
Great Basin wildlife includes [[Pronghorn]], [[Mule Deer]], [[Mountain Lion]], and [[Lagomorph]]s such as [[Black-tailed Jackrabbit]] and [[Desert Cottontail]] and the [[coyote]]s that prey on them. [[Packrat]]s, [[Kangaroo rat]]s and other small rodents are also common, but these are predominantly nocturnal. [[Elk]] and [[Bighorn Sheep]] are present but uncommon. Small [[lizards]] such as the [[Great Basin fence lizard]], [[Longnose Leopard Lizard]] and [[Horned Lizard]] are common, especially in lower elevations. [[Rattlesnake]]s and [[Gopher snake]]s are also present. The [[Inyo Mountains Salamander]] is endangered. Shorebirds such as [[Phalarope]]s and [[Curlew]]s can be found in wet areas. [[American White Pelican]]s are common at [[Pyramid Lake (Nevada)|Pyramid Lake]]. [[Golden Eagle]]s are perhaps more common in the Great Basin than anywhere else in the US.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} [[Mourning Dove]], [[Western Meadowlark]], [[Black-billed Magpie]], and [[Common Raven]] are other common bird species.

Two [[endangered species]] of fish are found in Pyramid Lake: the [[Cui-ui]] [[Catostomidae|sucker fish]] and the [[Lahontan cutthroat trout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hogan |first=C.Michael |coauthor=Papineau, Marc, et al |year=1987 |title=Development of a dynamic water quality simulation model for the [[Truckee River]] |publisher=Earth Metrics Inc. |series=[[Environmental Protection Agency]] Technology Series |location=Washington D.C.|page=}}{{Verify source|Does this book actually have any of the facts in this wikiarticle|date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large [[invertebrates]] include [[tarantula]]s ([[Aphonopelma]] genus) and [[Mormon cricket]]s. Exotic species, including [[Chukar]], [[Grey Partridge]], and [[Himalayan Snowcock]], have been successfully introduced to the Great Basin, although the latter has only thrived in the [[Ruby Mountains]]. [[Drooping Brome|Cheatgrass]], an [[invasive species]] which was unintentionally introduced, forms a critical portion of their diets. [[Feral]] [[horse]]s ([[Mustang (horse)|Mustangs]]) and wild [[burro]]s are other highly reproductive, and ecosystem controversial, alien species. Most of the Great Basin is [[Rangeland|open range]] and domestic [[cattle]] and [[sheep]] are widespread.

===Flora===
[[Utah Juniper]]/[[Single-leaf Pinyon]] (southern regions) and [[Mountain Mahogany]] (northern regions) form open [[Pinyon-juniper woodland]] on the slopes of most ranges. Stands of [[Limber Pine]] and Great Basin Bristlecone Pine ([[Pinus longaeva]]) can be found in some of the higher ranges (the [[Methuselah (tree)|Methuselah tree]] is nearly 5000 years old).  In [[riparian]] areas with dependable water cottonwoods ([[Populus fremontii]]) and Quaking Aspen ([[Populus tremuloides]]) groves exist. Grasslands contain the native [[Great Basin wildrye]].

==History==
[[File:Fillmorevolcano.jpg|thumb|400px|The [[Sevier Lake|Black Rock Desert Volcanic Field]] of Utah (pictured) differs from the [[Black Rock Desert]] of Nevada, and both are in the Great Basin.]]
Sediment build-up over thousands of years between undersea ranges created relatively flat [[lacustrine plain]]s in underwater portions of the prehistoric area that would be named the Great Basin after they drained.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Jackson |first1=Richard H. |last2=Stevens |first2=Dale J. |year=1981 |title=Physical and Cultural Environment of Utah Lake and Adjacent Areas |url=https://ojs.lib.byu.edu/ojs/index.php/gbnmem/article/view/2941/3289 |journal=Great Basin Naturalist Memoirs | issue= 5: Utah Lake Monograph |page=5 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, after forming about 32,000 [[Before Present|years ago]], [[Lake Bonneville]] overflowed about 14,500 years ago in the [[Bonneville Flood]] through [[Red Rock Pass]] and lowered to the &quot;Provo Lake&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gilbert |first=Grove Karl |year=1890 |title=Lake Bonneville |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=NY0sAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA127 |format=[[Google Books]] |page=127|accessdate=2010-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; level (the [[Great Salt Lake]], [[Utah Lake]], [[Sevier Lake]], [[Rush Lake (Utah)|Rush Lake]], and [[Little Salt Lake]] remain).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=Dale L |year=1947 |title=The Great Salt Lake |location=Salt Lake City |publisher=University of Utah Press |isbn=0-87480-478-7 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Lake Lahontan]], [[Lake Manly]], and [[Lake Mojave]] were similar [[Pleistocene]] lakes.

[[Paleo-Indians|Paleo-Indian habitation]] by the [[Great Basin tribes]] began as early as 10,000 B.C. (the Numic-speaking Shoshonean peoples arrived as late as 1000 A.D.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Archaeology, Cultural Transmission, and the Indigenous Native American Indians of the Great Basin Region of North America |url=http://www.bauuinstitute.com/Articles/ArchaeologyCultureGreatBasin.html |publisher=Bauu Institute |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] evidence of habitation sites along the shore of [[Lake Lahontan]] date from the end of the ice age when its shoreline was approximately {{convert|500|ft|m}} higher along the sides of the surrounding mountains. The Great Basin was inhabited for at least several thousand years by [[Uto-Aztecan]] language group-speaking [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] Great Basin tribes, including the [[Shoshone]], [[Ute Tribe|Ute]], [[Mono tribe|Mono]], and [[Paiute|Northern Paiute]].

Exploration of the Great Basin occurred during the 18th century [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]].  The first American to cross the Great Basin from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] was [[Jedediah Strong Smith]] in 1827. &lt;ref&gt;Morgan (1953, 1964), ''Jedediah Smith and the Opening of the West'', p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter Skene Ogden]] of the British [[Hudson's Bay Company]] explored the Great Salt Lake and Humboldt River regions in the late 1820s, following the eastern side of the Sierra Nevada to the Gulf of California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?&amp;id_nbr=4109 Ogden, Peter Skene], Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online&lt;/ref&gt; [[Benjamin Bonneville]] explored the northeast portion during an [[American Fur Company|1832 expedition]]. The United States had acquired control of the area north of the [[42nd parallel north|42nd parallel]] via the 1819 [[AdamsâOnÃ­s Treaty]] with Spain and 1846 [[Oregon Treaty]] with Britain. The US gained control of most of the rest of the Great Basin via the 1848 [[Mexican Cession]]. The first non-indigenous settlements{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}} were connected with the eastern regions of the 1848 [[California Gold Rush]], with its immigrants crossing the Great Basin on the [[California Trail]] along Nevada's [[Humboldt River]] to [[Carson Pass]] in the Sierras. The first American religious settlement effort was the [[Mormonism|Mormon]] provisional [[State of Deseret]] in 1849 in present day Utah and northern Nevada.  The [[Oregon Territory]] was established in 1848 and the [[Utah Territory]] in 1850.

In 1869 the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] was completed at [[Promontory Summit]] in the Great Basin. Around 1902, the [[Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad|San Pedro, Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad]] was constructed in the lower basin and Mojave Desert for [[History of Las Vegas#1829â1905: origins|California-Nevada rail service]] to Las Vegas, Nevada.

To close a 1951 Indian Claims Commission case, the [[Western Shoshone Claims Distribution Act of 2004]] established the United States payment of $117 million to the Great Basin tribe [[eminent domain|for the acquisition]] of {{convert|39000|sqmi|km2}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Action Alert! |url=http://www.shundahai.org/claims_action_alert_0501.htm |publisher=Shundahai Network |accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dixie Valley, Nevada]], earthquake (6.6-7.1) in the Great Basin was in 1954. The [[Mojave and Colorado Deserts Biosphere Reserve]] (4 conserved areas) was designated in 1984, and in 1986, and 1994, the [[Great Basin National Park]] and the [[Mojave National Preserve]] were established. In 2009, the [[American Land Conservancy]]'s Great Basin Program reserved the Green Gulch mule deer migration corridor as part of &quot;''over 80,000 acres ''[conserved]'' in Nevada and the Eastern Sierras''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Great Basin |url=http://www.alcnet.org/projects/overview/basin |work=Programs |publisher=[[American Land Conservancy]] |accessdate=2010-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
