A '''Mix Tape''' or Mixed Tape is a compilation of [[songs]] recorded in a specific order, traditionally onto an audio [[Compact Cassette]].

A Mix Tape, which usually reflects the musical tastes of its compiler, can range from a casually selected list of favorite songs, to a [[conceptual]] mix of songs linked by a [[Theme (literature)|theme]] or mood, to a highly personal statement tailored to the tape's intended recipient. Essayist [[Geoffrey O'Brien]] has called the personal mix tape &quot;the most widely practiced [[United States of America|American]] art form&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pooter&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.events-in-music.com/burnlist-mix-tapes.html| title=BurnLists: The Digital &quot;Mix Tape&quot; Comes Of Age| first=Michael| last=Resnick| year=2006| accessdate=2007-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many{{Who|date=June 2010}} mix tape enthusiasts believe that by carefully selecting and ordering the tracks in a mix, an [[art]]istic statement can be created that is greater than the sum of its individual songs.

With the advent of affordable, consumer-level [[digital audio]], creating and distributing mixes in the form of [[compact disc]] or [[MP3]] [[playlist]]s has become the contemporary method of choice, but the term ''mix tape'' is still commonly used, even for mixes in different media (for example, [[CD]], [[MP3]], [[MiniDisc]], [[audio cassette]] [[8-track tape|8 track]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} [[Video mixtape]]s have emerged as well.

==History==
{{Globalize/US|date=December 2010}}
The most common early mix tapes were [[Bootleg recording|bootleg]] [[8-track tape|8 track]] tapes that were sold at flea markets and truck stops in the late 60's through the early 80's, with names like &quot;Super 73&quot;, &quot;Country Chart Toppers&quot; or &quot;Top Pops 1977&quot;.

Homemade mix tapes became common in the 1980s.  Although the [[Compact Cassette|compact audio cassette]] by [[Philips]] appeared at the 1963 [[Berlin Radio Show]],&lt;ref&gt;John Shepherd, ''Continuum encyclopedia of popular music of the world''. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2003, p.506&lt;/ref&gt; the sound quality of cassettes was not good enough to be seriously considered for music recording until further advances in tape formulations, including the advent of chrome and metal tape. Before the introduction of the audio cassette, the creation of a pop music compilation required specialized or cumbersome equipment, such as a [[reel-to-reel]] or [[8-track tape|8 track]] recorder, that was often inaccessible to the casual music [[fan (aficionado)|fan]]. As cassette tapes and recorders grew in popularity and portability, these technological hurdles were lowered to the point where the only resources required to create a mix were a handful of cassettes and a cassette recorder connected to a source of prerecorded music, such as a radio or [[vinyl record|LP]] player. The [[8-track tape]] cartridge was more popular for music recording during much of the 1960s, as the cassette was originally only mono and intended for vocal recordings only, such as in office dictation machines.  But improvements in fidelity finally allowed the cassette to become a major player.  The ready availability of the cassette and higher quality home recording decks to serve the home casual user  allowed the cassette to become the dominant tape format, to the point that the [[8-track tape|8 track]] tape nearly disappeared shortly after the turn of the 1980s.  The growth of the mixtape was also encouraged by improved quality and increased popularity of audio cassette players in [[car audio|car entertainment system]]s, and by the introduction of the [[Sony Walkman]] in 1979.

A distinction should be drawn between a private mixtape, which is usually intended for a specific listener or private social event, and a public mixtape, or &quot;party tape&quot;, usually consisting of a recording of a club performance by a [[DJ]] and intended to be sold to multiple individuals. In the 1970s, such DJs as [[Grandmaster Flash]] and the [[Furious Five]], [[Afrika Bambaataa]] and the Soulsonic Force, [[Kool DJ Herc|Kool Herc and the Herculoids]], [[DJ Breakout]], the [[Funky Four]], and [[DJ Hollywood]] would often distribute recordings of their club performances via audio cassette, as well as customized recordings (often prepared at exorbitant prices) for individual tape purchasers. These recordings tended to be of higher technical ability than home-made mixtapes and incorporated techniques such as [[beatmatching]] and [[scratching]]. One 12 October 1974 article in ''[[Billboard Magazine]]'' reported, &quot;Tapes were originally [[Dubbing (music)|dub]]bed by jockeys to serve as standbys for times when they did not have disco [[phonograph|turntable]]s to hand. The tapes represent each jockey's concept of programming, placing, and sequencing of record sides. The music is heard without interruption. One- to three-hour programs bring anywhere from $30 to $75 per tape, mostly reel-to-reel, but increasingly on cartridge and cassette.&quot; Club proprietors, as well as DJs, would often prepare such tapes for sale.
[[File:CD-R.jpg|right|thumb|The [[CD-R]] disc is currently the most common medium for homemade mixes]]
Throughout the 1980s, mixtapes were a highly visible element of [[youth culture]]. However, the increased availability of [[CD recorder|CD burner]]s and MP3 players and the gradual disappearance of cassette players in cars and households have led to a decline in the popularity of the compact audio cassette as a medium for homemade mixes. The high point of traditional mixtape culture was arguably the publication of [[Nick Hornby|Nick Hornby's]] novel ''[[High Fidelity (novel)|High Fidelity]]'' in 1995. Since then, mixtapes have largely been replaced by mix CDs and shared MP3 playlists, which are more durable, can hold more songs, and require minutes (rather than hours) to prepare. While some mixtape enthusiasts bemoan the obsolescence of the cassette tape, others concede that the greater convenience offered by the mix CD has expanded the possibilities and accessibility of the medium, as indicated by the recent resurgence of mix-swapping clubs that trade mix CDs by regular mail. Some mix enthusiasts also appreciate the potential of the mix CD for extended, continuous mixes and creative album art.

Today, websites concerned with electronic music provide mixes in a digital format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dnb-sets.de/ Drum &amp; Bass mix search engine - crawling for D&amp;B mixes and sets&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mix-tapes.de/ (X) Free Music Downloads Mp3 Blog Free DJ-Sets Mixe Mixtapes Live Sets DJ-Mixe&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hypaculture.com/dnbsets.php DNB mixes archive&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These usually consist of recorded DJ sets of live, beat-matched mixes of songs, which are used by DJs seeking to demonstrate their mixing skills to an online audience. Some radio shows worldwide specialize in mix series, including ''[[The Breezeblock]]'' on [[BBC Radio 1]], ''[[Solid Steel|The Solid Steel Show]]'' (formerly on [[KISS-FM]]), and ''[[The BTTB Show]]''.

Additionally, DJs such as [[Grandmaster Flash]], [[DJ QBert]], [[DJ Spooky]], [[DJ Z-Trip]] or [[DJ Shadow]], [[The Avalanches]], and [[Rjd2]] have gained fame for creating new songs by combining fragments of existing songs (which need not necessarily belong to the same genre). The resulting [[remix]] or [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] can be seen as an evolution of the mixtape, in that it appropriates existing songs to give them new meanings through their juxtaposition, but does so in a quicker, more integrated style. This practice is heavily derived from the use of song loops as musical backdrops for an MC's rhymes in [[hip hop music]], which is also related to [[turntablism]].

==Mixtapes vs. compilations==

{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
Many commercially available compilations of [[pop music]] initially seem to share certain important characteristics with mixtapes. Like many private mixes, a significant number of the earliest pop LPs were essentially collections of popular [[Single (music)|singles]], and such [[compilation albums]] have often taken cues from underground mixes of the same era. One example is ''Disco Par-r-r-ty'', the first nonstop dancing LP record, which was released by Spring Records in October 1974. Consisting of a continuous mix of songs by such artists as [[James Brown (musician)|James Brown]], [[Mandrill (band)|Mandrill]], and [[Barry White]], it was clearly inspired by the bootleg DJ mixes that were becoming popular at the same time. However, the relative [[anonymity]] of the compilers of such albums is arguably inconsistent with the rationale behind most mixtapes, which typically reflect the musical tastes of a single compiler. While the editors of such compilations do exercise a certain amount of discretion over song order and selection, the term ''mixtape'' is generally restricted to a compilation where the identity of the compiler is clearly associated with the album itself. For example, [[Starbucks]], the coffee chain, sells a compilation CD series called Artist's Choice, which consists of mixes based on selections by such artists as [[Johnny Cash]], [[Tony Bennett]], and [[Sheryl Crow]]. Similarly, [[Apple Computer]]'s [[iTunes Store]] features Celebrity Playlists, downloadable mixtapes in AAC-compatible form, selected by such artists as [[Moby]], [[Barry Manilow]], and [[Andrew W.K.]] The ''[[Late Night Tales]]'' series has seen artists such as Four Tet and Turin Brakes make their own compilations that are distributed in mainstream record shops such as HMV.

The presence of an identifiable compiler whose tastes are reflected in song selection and arrangement allow retail mix CDs to be distinguished from other types of compilations. The distinction can be rather subtle. For example, while most &quot;greatest hits&quot; compilations of individual recording artists consist of a collection of singles in chronological order, others include album tracks, new songs, or obscure selections in addition to established hits, and sometimes reorder the songs for optimal listening. As such, these compilations can be seen as &quot;artist-specific&quot; mixes selected and arranged by the artists themselves.

One could also argue that the modern movie [[soundtrack]], which often consists of selected pop music tracks (rather than the traditional orchestral score) is a mixtape with songs selected by the film's director or music supervisor.

==Legal issues in the United States==
An important distinction between homemade mixes and retail compilations of pop music is that the latter generally obtain permissions for the use of copyrighted songs, while the former do not. As a result, mixtapes, such as those produced and sold by club DJs in the 1970s, are illegal. Most{{Who|date=June 2010}} mixtape enthusiasts assume that private mixtapes are inoffensive from a fair use standpoint, but this is far from clear. Frank Creighton, a director of anti-copyright infringement efforts for the [[Recording Industry Association of America]], was quoted in ''[[New York Times]]'' as saying that &quot;money did not have to be involved for copying to be illegal.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE7DC1F39F933A05752C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all| title=For the Mix Tape, A Digital Upgrade And Notoriety| first=David| last=Gallagher| month=January| year= 2003| accessdate=2008-05-23 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; While mixes on cassette tapes may not have inspired the wrath of the record industry in the past, Mr. Creighton said, &quot;digital mixes have better sound quality&quot;. And given the proliferation of CD burning for friends and relatives, &quot;it would be naÃ¯ve of us to say that we should allow that type of activity&quot;.

==Aesthetics==
While the process of recording a mix onto an audio cassette from LPs or compact discs is technically straightforward, many music fans who create more than one mixtape are eventually compelled to confront some of the practical and aesthetic challenges involved in the mixtape format. From a practical standpoint, such issues as avoiding an excessive amount of blank tape at the end of one side (which requires careful planning of the length of each side of the mix) and reducing the audible click between songs (which requires mastery of the pause button on the cassette recorder) have been identified as part of the shared experience of mixtape aficionados. From an [[aesthetic]] point of view, many enthusiasts believe that because a tape player, unlike a CD player, lacks the ability to skip from song to song, the mixtape needs to be considered in its entirety. This requires the mixtape creator to consider the transitions between songs, the effects caused by [[Juxtaposition (literary)|juxtaposing]] a soft song with a loud song, and the overall &quot;[[narrative|narrative arc]]&quot; of the entire tape. One notable listing of such aesthetic &quot;rules&quot; can be found in a paragraph from [[Nick Hornby]]'s ''[[High Fidelity (novel)|High Fidelity]]'':
{{cquote|To me, making a tape is like writing a letter&amp;nbsp;â there's a lot of erasing and rethinking and starting again. A good compilation tape, like breaking up, is hard to do. You've got to kick off with a corker, to hold the attention (I started with &quot;Got to Get You Off My Mind&quot;, but then realized that she might not get any further than track one, side one if I delivered what she wanted straightaway, so I buried it in the middle of side two), and then you've got to up it a notch, or cool it a notch, and you can't have white music and black music together, unless the white music sounds like black music, and you can't have two tracks by the same artist side by side, unless you've done the whole thing in pairs and...oh, there are loads of rules.}}

Many enthusiasts also devote substantial attention to the packaging of a mix tape intended as a gift, sometimes going so far as to create cover art and customized liner notes. The cover of the original [[McSweeney's]] edition of ''[[31 Songs]]'', a 2003 essay collection by [[Nick Hornby]], was intended to suggest the packaging of a homemade mix CD. It also came with an actual CD featuring ten of the songs discussed in the text. Indeed, the look of mix tapes, featuring hand-written notes on the recording medium manufacturer's supplied labels, has become one of the aesthetic conventions of modern design, a distinct style that designers may attempt to copy or cite.  Many have been so widely distributed that the [[CDDB]] has logged and can identify [[ID3]] tags when a disc mix tape is inserted into a PC.

From an artistic point of view, many creators of mix tapes seem to regard them as a form of emotional self-expression, although whether a mix tape retains the same web of emotional associations when passed from its creator to the recipient is, at best, debatable. Some argue that in selecting, juxtaposing, or even editing originally unrelated tracks of pop music into a new work of art, the &quot;author&quot; of a mix tape moves from passive listener to [[archivist]], [[editing|editor]], and finally active [[wikt:participation|participant]] in the process of musical creation. (Some legitimacy for this viewpoint was provided by ''Cassette Stories'', a 2003 exhibition at the Museum of Communication in [[Hamburg, Germany]], which featured stories and submissions from eighty mix tape enthusiasts.) However, this perception of the mix tape as a work of art has been criticized as resulting in a sort of elitism, with creators becoming more concerned with finding arcane and surprising combinations of tracks than with creating a tape that is listenable, enjoyable, or appropriate to its intended recipient. (In ''High Fidelity'', for example, the narrator's girlfriend complains that his mix tapes are too [[didactic]].) On a very basic level, the creation of a mix tape can be seen as an expression of the individual compiler's taste in music, often put forward for the implicit approval of the tape's recipient, and in many cases as a tentative step towards building the compiler's personal [[wiktionary:canon|canon]] of pop music.

==Types of Mix Tapes==

Although a &quot;comprehensive&quot; list of the different genres or categories of mixtapes could be extended indefinitely, creating a taxonomy of mix tapes is a project that many mix tape enthusiasts have intuitively attempted.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} The different types of mix tapes identified on community sites, such as [http://www.FoundTrack.com/ FoundTrack] and [http://www.artofthemix.org/ Art of the Mix] (which lists over two hundred genres), indicate the variety of potential categories. Beyond basic genres as the simple taping of an entire album, the collection of favorite songs, and the &quot;snapshot&quot;{{Clarify|date=June 2010}}&lt;!-- &quot;Snapshot&quot; meaning? Thanks, Davtra --&gt; mix of recent favorites, some of the more commonly cited categories include the driving mix, the workout mix, the party mix, the krazy mix (eclectic selections of obscure, rare or otherwise unconventional tracks), the didactic mix (intended to educate the recipient as to the essential works of a particular artist or genre), the concept / theme mix (a mix of [[Christmas]] songs, songs about cars, or covers of songs by a particular artist or similar), and the mood mix (simply a mix of songs intended to sustain a specific mood, stated or unstated&amp;nbsp;â notable sub genres include the romantic mix and the break-up mix). Mixtapes eventually made their way onto television screens by video mix DJs (i.e., Jordan Laws 'Fit to Fill Video Mixtape' [[DJ SWB]]{{Full}}).

==Mixtapes in hip hop==
In [[Hip hop music|hip hop]]'s earliest days, the music only existed in live form, and the music was spread via tapes of parties and shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot;&gt;Shapiro, Peter (2005) ''The Rough Guide to Hip-Hop'', Rough Guides, ISBN 1-84353-263-8, p.332-333&lt;/ref&gt; Hip hop mixtapes first appeared in the mid-1970s in [[New York City]], featuring artists such as [[Kool Herc]] and [[Afrika Bambaata]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot; /&gt; As more tapes became available, they began to be collected and traded by [[Fan (person)|fans]]. In the mid-1980s, DJs, such as Brucie B, began recording their live music and selling their own mixtapes, which was soon followed by other DJs such as [[Kid Capri]] and Doo Wop.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot; /&gt; Ron G moved the mixtape forward in the early 1990s by blending R&amp;B ''a cappellas'' with hip hop beats (known as &quot;blends&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;Shapiro&quot; /&gt; Blend tapes became increasingly popular by the mid-1990s{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}, and fans increasingly looked for exclusive tracks and [[Freestyle rapping|freestyles]] on the tapes. In the hip hop scene, mix tape is often displayed as a single term ''mixtape''.

==Mix Tapes in global culture==
All of the references to mixtapes cited above come from media sources in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], the [[United Kingdom]], or continental Europe. The use of mixtapes in other countries is less documented. However, it seems reasonable to believe that mixes exist wherever access to music is combined with a convenient means of recording homemade compilations (although mixtapes may not have been a significant element of the [[youth culture]] in such countries). For example, Sarah Erdman's 2003 book ''Nine Hills to Nambonkaha'' includes a description of the tape collection of a middle-class African in [[CÃ´te d'Ivoire]]:
{{cquote|I click through his box of tapes, finding African musicians I've never heard of, old [[Phil Collins]], [[Rod Stewart]] with a long earring before his &quot;Some Guys Have All the Luck&quot; days. But I also discover [[Van Morrison]], a [[Rolling Stones]] bootleg, [[Peter Tosh]], [[Dire Straits]], [[Pink Floyd]], [[Tracy Chapman]], [[Sting (musician)|Sting]]. His mixed tapes flit from [[Donna Summer]] to [[Joe Cocker]] to [[Bonnie Raitt]].}}
