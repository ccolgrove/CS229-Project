'''Address Resolution Protocol''' ('''ARP''') is a [[telecommunication]]s protocol used for resolution of [[network layer]] addresses into [[link layer]] addresses, a critical function in multiple-access networks. ARP was defined by RFC 826 in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[Internet Standard]] STD 37.  It is also the name of the program for manipulating these addresses in most operating systems.

ARP has been implemented in many combinations of network and overlaying internetwork technologies, such as [[IPv4]], [[Chaosnet]], [[DECnet]] and Xerox [[PARC Universal Packet]] (PUP) using [[IEEE 802]] standards, [[FDDI]], [[X.25]], [[Frame Relay]] and [[Asynchronous Transfer Mode]] (ATM), IPv4 over [[IEEE 802.3]] and [[IEEE 802.11]] being the most common cases.

In [[IPv6|Internet Protocol Version 6]] (IPv6) networks, the functionality of ARP is provided by the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP).

==Operating scope==
The Address Resolution Protocol is a request and reply protocol that runs encapsulated by the line protocol. It is communicated within the boundaries of a single network, never routed across internetwork nodes. This property places ARP into the [[Link Layer]] of the [[Internet Protocol Suite]], while in the [[Open Systems Interconnect]](OSI) model, it is often described as residing between Layers 2 and 3, being encapsulated by Layer 2 protocols. However, ARP was not developed in the OSI framework.

==Packet structure==
The Address Resolution Protocol uses a simple message format that contains one address resolution request or response. The size of the ARP message depends on the upper layer and lower layer address sizes, which are given by the type of networking protocol (usually [[IPv4]]) in use and the type of hardware or virtual link layer that the upper layer protocol is running on. The message header specifies these types, as well as the size of addresses of each. The message header is completed with the operation code for request (1) and reply (2). The payload of the packet consists of four addresses, the hardware and protocol address of the sender and receiver hosts.

The principal packet structure of ARP packets is shown in the following table which illustrates the case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet. In this scenario, the packet has 48-bit fields for the sender hardware address (SHA) and target hardware address (THA), and 32-bit fields for the corresponding sender and target protocol addresses (SPA and TPA). Thus, the ARP packet size in this case is 28 bytes. The EtherType for ARP is 0x806.

==Example==
For example, the computers ''Matterhorn'' and ''Washington'' are in an office, connected to each other on the office [[local area network]] by [[Ethernet]] cables and [[network switches]], with no intervening [[Gateway (telecommunications)|gateways]] or [[Router (computing)|routers]].  Matterhorn wants to send a packet to Washington. Through other means, it determines that Washington's IP address is 192.168.0.55. In order to send the message, it also needs to know Washington's MAC address.  First, Matterhorn uses a cached ARP table to look up 192.168.0.55 for any existing records of Washington's MAC address (00:eb:24:b2:05:ac). If the MAC address is found, it sends the IP packet on the link layer to address 00:eb:24:b2:05:ac via the local network cabling. If the cache did not produce a result for 192.168.0.55, Matterhorn has to send a broadcast ARP message (destination FF:FF:FF:FF:FF:FF) requesting an answer for 192.168.0.55.  Washington responds with its MAC address (00:eb:24:b2:05:ac). Washington may insert an entry for Matterhorn into its own ARP table for future use. The response information is cached in Matterhorn's ARP table and the message can now be sent.

==ARP probe==
An '''ARP probe''' is an ARP request constructed with an all-zero ''sender IP address''. The term is used in the ''IPv4 Address Conflict Detection'' specification (RFC 5227). Before beginning to use an IPv4 address (whether received from manual configuration, DHCP, or some other means), a host implementing this specification must test to see if the address is already in use, by broadcasting ARP probe packets.

==ARP announcements==
ARP may also be used as a simple announcement protocol. This is useful for updating other hosts' mapping of a hardware address when the sender's IP address or MAC address has changed. Such an announcement, also called a ''gratuitous ARP'' message, is usually broadcast as an ARP request containing the sender's protocol address (SPA) in the target field (TPA=SPA), with the target hardware address (THA) set to zero. An alternative is to broadcast an ARP reply with the sender's hardware and protocol addresses (SHA and SPA) duplicated in the target fields (TPA=SPA, THA=SHA).

An ARP announcement is not intended to solicit a reply; instead it updates any cached entries in the ARP tables of other hosts that receive the packet. The operation code may indicate a request or a reply because the ARP standard specifies that the opcode is only processed after the ARP table has been updated from the address fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dhcwg/current/msg03797.html Gratuitous ARP in DHCP vs. IPv4 ACD Draft]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2002#section-4.6 RFC 2002 Section 4.6]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2131#section-4.4.1 RFC 2131 DHCP â Last lines of Section 4.4.1]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many operating systems perform gratuitous ARP during startup. That helps to resolve problems which would otherwise occur if, for example, a [[Network interface controller|network card]] was recently changed (changing the IP-address-to-MAC-address mapping) and other hosts still have the old mapping in their ARP caches.

Gratuitous ARP is also used by some interface drivers to provide load balancing for incoming traffic. In a team of network cards, it is used to announce a different MAC address within the team that should receive incoming packets.

ARP announcements can be used to defend [[link-local address|link-local IP addresses]] in the [[Zeroconf]] protocol (RFC 3927), and for IP address takeover within [[high-availability cluster]]s.

==ARP mediation==
{{expand section|date=May 2011}}
'''ARP mediation''' refers to the process of resolving Layer 2 addresses when different resolution protocols are used on multiple connected circuits, e.g., ATM on one end and Ethernet on the others. A proposed standard for ARP mediation is currently in draft status under the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-l2vpn-arp-mediation-16 | author = Himanshu Shah, et. al. | title = ARP Mediation for IP Interworking of Layer 2 VPN | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = 2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inverse ARP and Reverse ARP==
'''Inverse Address Resolution Protocol''' (Inverse ARP or InARP) is used to obtain [[Network Layer]] addresses (for example, [[IP address]]es) of other nodes from [[Data Link Layer]] (Layer 2) addresses. It is primarily used in [[Frame Relay]] ([[DLCI]]) and ATM networks, in which Layer 2 addresses of [[virtual circuit]]s are sometimes obtained from Layer 2 signaling, and the corresponding Layer 3 addresses must be available before those virtual circuits can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2390 | author = T. Bradley, et. al. | title = RFC 2390 - Inverse Address Resolution Protocol | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = 1998-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ARP translates Layer 3 addresses to Layer 2 addresses, InARP may be described as its inverse. In addition, InARP is implemented as a protocol extension to ARP: it uses the same packet format as ARP, but different operation codes.

The [[Reverse Address Resolution Protocol]] (Reverse ARP or RARP), like InARP, translates Layer 2 addresses to Layer 3 addresses. However, in InARP the requesting station queries the Layer 3 address of another node, whereas RARP is used to obtain the Layer 3 address of the requesting station itself for address configuration purposes. RARP is obsolete; it was replaced by [[BOOTP]], which was later superseded by the [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol]] (DHCP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc903 | author = Finlayson, Mann, Mogul, Theimer | title = RFC 903 - A Reverse Address Resolution Protocol | publisher = Internet Engineering Task Force | date = 1984-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ARP spoofing and Proxy ARP==
[[Image:ARP Spoofing.svg|right|thumb|200px|A successful [[ARP spoofing]] attack allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.]]
{{main|ARP spoofing}}{{main|Proxy ARP}}
Because ARP does not provide methods for authenticating ARP replies on a network, ARP replies can come from systems other than the one with the required Layer 2 address.  An ARP ''proxy'' is a system which answers the ARP request on behalf of another system for which it will forward traffic, normally as part of network design such as dialup internet service. By contrast in ARP ''spoofing'', where the spoofer answers the ARP requests with the aim of interception. A malicious user may leverage ARP spoofing to perform a [[man-in-the-middle]] or [[denial-of-service]] attack on other users on the network. Various software exists to both detect and perform ARP spoofing attacks, though ARP itself does not provide any methods of protection from such attacks.&lt;ref name=&quot;grc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.grc.com/nat/arp.htm | author = Steve Gibson | title = ARP Cache Poisoning | publisher = [[Gibson Research Corporation|GRC]] | date = 2005-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives to ARP==

Each computer maintains its own table of the mapping from [[Layer 3]] addresses (e.g. [[IP addresses]]) to [[Layer 2]] addresses (e.g. [[ethernet]] [[MAC addresses]]).  In a modern computer this is maintained almost entirely by ARP packets on the local network and it thus often called the 'ARP cache' as opposed to 'Layer 2 address table'.  In older computers, where broadcast packets were considered an expensive resource, other methods were used to maintain this table, such as static configuration files&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This is a solution to an issue in network management of consumer devices, specifically the allocation of IP addresses of ethernet devices where 1) the user doesn't have the ability to control [[DHCP]] or similar address allocation protocols, 2) the device doesn't have a user interface to configure it, and 3) the user's computer can't communicate with it because it has no suitable IP address.

The solution adopted is as follows: the user's computer has an IP address ''stuffed'' manually into its address table (normally with the ''arp'' command with the MAC address taken from a label on the device) and then sends special packets to the device, typically a [[ping]] packet with a non-default size.  The device then adopts this IP address, and the user then communicates with it by [[telnet]] or [[http|web]] protocols to complete the configuration.  Such devices typically have a method to disable this process once the device is operating normally, as it is open to [[Denial of Service]] attack.
