The '''''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica''''' ([[Latin]] for &quot;British Encyclopaedia&quot;), published by [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]], is a general knowledge English-language [[encyclopedia|encyclopaedia]] that is available in print, as a [[DVD]], and on the [[Internet]]. It is written and continuously updated by about 100&amp;nbsp;full-time editors and more than 4,000&amp;nbsp;expert contributors. It is regarded as one of the most scholarly of encyclopaedias.

The ''Britannica'' is the oldest English-language encyclopaedia still in print. It was first published between 1768 and 1771 in [[Edinburgh]], Scotland as three volumes. The encyclopaedia grew in size, and by its fourth edition (1801â1809) it had expanded to a well known 20-volume set. Its rising stature helped recruit eminent contributors, and the 9th edition (1875â1889) and the [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition|11th edition]] (1911) are landmark encyclopaedias for scholarship and literary style. Beginning with the 11th edition, the ''Britannica'' shortened and simplified articles to broaden its North American market. In 1933, the ''Britannica'' became the first encyclopaedia to adopt &quot;continuous revision&quot;, in which the encyclopaedia is continually reprinted and every article updated on a schedule.

The current 15th edition has a unique three-part structure: a 12-volume ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'' of short articles (generally fewer than 750&amp;nbsp;words), a 17-volume ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]'' of long articles (two to 310&amp;nbsp;pages) and a single ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]'' volume to give a [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] outline of knowledge. The ''MicropÃ¦dia'' is meant for quick fact-checking and as a guide to the ''MacropÃ¦dia''; readers are advised to study the ''PropÃ¦dia'' outline to understand a subject's context and to find more detailed articles. The size of the ''Britannica'' has remained roughly constant over 70&amp;nbsp;years, with about 40&amp;nbsp;million words on half a million topics. Although publication has been based in the United States since 1901, the ''Britannica'' has maintained [[American and British English spelling differences|British spelling]].

The ''Britannica'' has had difficulty remaining profitable. Some articles in earlier editions have been criticised for inaccuracy, bias, or unqualified contributors. The accuracy in parts of the present edition has likewise been questioned, although criticisms have been challenged by ''Britannica's'' management.

==History==
{{Main|History of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica}}
Ownership has changed many times, past owners including the Scottish publisher [[A &amp; C Black]], [[Horace Everett Hooper]], [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] and [[William Benton (senator)|William Benton]]. The present owner of EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Inc. is [[Jacqui Safra]], a Swiss billionaire and actor. Recent advances in [[information technology]] and the rise of electronic encyclopedias such as ''[[Encarta]]'' and [[Wikipedia]] have reduced the demand for print encyclopedias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/40033.stm | title = Encyclopaedia Britannica changes to survive | last = Day | first = Peter | date = 17 December 1997 | publisher = BBC News | quote = Sales plummeted from 100,000 a year to just 20,000. | accessdate = 27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; To remain competitive, EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc. has stressed the reputation of the ''Britannica'', reduced its price and production costs, and developed electronic versions on [[CD-ROM]], DVD, and the [[World Wide Web]]. Since the early 1930s, the company has promoted spin-off reference works.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia_1954&quot;/&gt;

===Editions===
[[File:EB1 titlepage.gif|thumb|right|Title page of the first edition of the ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'']]
The ''Britannica'' has been issued in 15 editions, with multi-volume supplements to the 3rd and 5th editions (see the [[#Edition summary|Table]] below). The 10th edition was only a supplement to the 9th, just as the 12th and 13th editions were supplements to the 11th. The 15th underwent massive re-organisation in 1985, but the updated, current version is still known as the 15th.

Throughout history, the ''Britannica'' has had two aims: to be an excellent reference book and to provide educational material.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_encyclopedia&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Encyclopedias and Dictionaries | encyclopedia = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 18 | pages = 257â286}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the 15th edition adopted a third goal: to systematise all human knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''| pages = 5â8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The history of the ''Britannica'' can be divided into five eras, punctuated by changes in management or re-organisation of the dictionary.

====1768â1826====
In the first era (1stâ6th editions, 1768â1826), the ''Britannica'' was managed and published by its founders, [[Colin Macfarquhar]] and [[Andrew Bell (engraver)|Andrew Bell]], by [[Archibald Constable]], and by others. The ''Britannica'' was first published between 1768 and 1771 in [[Edinburgh]] as the ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, or, A Dictionary of Arts and Sciences, compiled upon a New Plan''. In part, it was conceived in reaction to the French ''[[EncyclopÃ©die]]'' of [[Denis Diderot]] and [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]] (published 1751â1772), which had been inspired by [[Cyclopaedia, or an Universal Dictionary of Arts and Sciences|Chambers's ''Cyclopaedia'']] (first edition 1728). The ''Britannica'' was primarily a Scottish enterprise; it is one of the most enduring legacies of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Herman | first = Arthur | year = 2002 | title = [[How the Scots Invented the Modern World]] | publisher = Three Rivers Press | isbn = 978-0-609-80999-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this era, the ''Britannica'' moved from being a three-volume set (1st edition) compiled by one young editorâ[[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Krapp |first=Philip |coauthors=Balou, Patricia K. |year=1992 |title=Collier's Encyclopedia |volume=9 |pages=135 |publisher=Macmillan Educational Company |location=New York |id= {{LCCN|91|0|61165}}}} The ''Britannica's'' 1st edition is described as &quot;deplorably inaccurate and unscientific&quot; in places.&lt;/ref&gt;âto a well known&lt;ref&gt;Frank A. Kafker and Jeff Loveland, eds., ''The Early Britannica: The Growth of an Outstanding Encyclopedia'' (Oxford: Voltaire Foundation, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; 20-volume set written by numerous authorities. Several other encyclopaedias competed throughout this period, among them editions of [[Abraham Rees]]'s ''Cyclopaedia'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopaedia Metropolitana]]''.&lt;ref&gt;On editions of the ''Britannica'' through 1803 see Kafker and Loveland, eds., ''Early Britannica'',&lt;/ref&gt; and [[David Brewster|David Brewster's]] ''[[Edinburgh Encyclopedia]]''.

[[File:Rosetta Stone.jpg|thumb|left|175px|The early 19th-century editions of ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' included [[Wiktionary:seminal#English|seminal]] research such as [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young's]] article on Egypt, which included the translation of the [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] on the [[Rosetta Stone]] (pictured).]]

====1827â1901====
During the second era (7thâ9th editions, 1827â1901), the ''Britannica'' was managed by the Edinburgh publishing firm, [[A &amp; C Black]]. Although some contributors were again recruited through friendships of the chief editors, notably [[Macvey Napier]], others were attracted by the ''Britannica's'' reputation. The contributors often came from other countries and included the world's most respected authorities in their fields. A general index of all articles was included for the first time in the 7th edition, a practice maintained until 1974. The first English-born editor-in-chief was [[Thomas Spencer Baynes]], who oversaw the production of the 9th edition; dubbed the &quot;Scholar's Edition&quot;, the 9th is the most scholarly ''Britannica''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Kogan | first = Herman | year = 1958 | title = The Great EB: The Story of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | publisher = The [[University of Chicago Press]] | location = Chicago | id = {{LCCN|58|00|8379}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1880, Baynes was assisted by [[William Robertson Smith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite SBDEL|Baynes, Thomas Spencer}}&lt;/ref&gt; No biographies of living persons were included.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|Editor's Advertisement|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] and [[Thomas Huxley]] were special advisors on science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite EB9|Prefatory Notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, by the close of the 19th century, the 9th edition was outdated and the ''Britannica'' faced financial difficulties.

====1901â1973====
In the third era (10thâ14th editions, 1901â73), the ''Britannica'' was managed by American businessmen who introduced [[direct marketing]] and [[door-to-door]] sales. The American owners gradually simplified articles, making them less scholarly for a mass market. The 10th edition was a nine-volume supplement to the 9th, but the 11th edition was a completely new work, and is still praised for excellence; its owner, [[Horace Everett Hooper|Horace Hooper]], lavished enormous effort on its perfection.&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt; When Hooper fell into financial difficulties, the ''Britannica'' was managed by [[Sears|Sears Roebuck]] for 18 years (1920â23, 1928â43). In 1932, the vice-president of Sears, [[Elkan Harrison Powell]], assumed presidency of the ''Britannica''; in 1936, he began the policy of continuous revision. This was a departure from earlier practice, in which the articles were not changed until a new edition was produced, at roughly 25-year intervals, some articles unchanged from earlier editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia_1954&quot; /&gt; Powell developed new educational products that built upon the ''Britannica's'' reputation. In 1943, ownership passed to William Benton, who managed the ''Britannica'' until his death in 1973. Benton set up the [[Benton Foundation]], which managed the ''Britannica'' until 1996. In 1968, near the end of this era, the ''Britannica'' celebrated [[Bicentennial of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|its bicentennial]].

====1974â1994====
In the fourth era (15th edition, 1974â94), the ''Britannica'' introduced its 15th edition, which was re-organised into three parts: the ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'', the ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]'', and the ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''. Under [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (member of the Board of Editors of EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica since its inception in 1949, and its chair from 1974; director of editorial planning for the 15th edition of ''Britannica'' from 1965),&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, ''A Guidebook to Learning: for the lifelong pursuit of wisdom''. MacMillan Publishing Company, New York, 1986. p.88&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Britannica'' sought not only to be a good reference work and educational tool but to systematise all human knowledge. The absence of a separate index and the grouping of articles into parallel encyclopaedias (the ''Micro-'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia'') provoked a &quot;firestorm of criticism&quot; of the initial 15th edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;15th_criticism&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Baker | first = John F. | title = A New Britannica Is Born | publisher = [[Publishers Weekly]] | date = 14 January 1974 | pages = 64â65}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite news | last = Wolff | first = Geoffrey | title = Britannica 3, History of | publisher = [[The Atlantic Monthly|The Atlantic]] |date = June 1974| pages = 37â47}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite news | last = Cole | first = Dorothy Ethlyn | title = Britannica 3 as a Reference Tool: A Review | publisher = Wilson Library Bulletin |date = June 1974| pages = 821â825 | quote = ''Britannica 3'' is difficult to use&amp;nbsp;... the division of content between ''MicropÃ¦dia'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia'' makes it necessary to consult another volume in the majority of cases; indeed, it was our experience that even simple searches might involve eight or nine volumes.}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite news | last = Davi

It has proved to be grotesquely inadequate as an index, radically constricting the utility of the ''MacropÃ¦dia''.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the 15th edition was completely re-organised and indexed for a re-release in 1985. This second version of the 15th edition continues to be published and revised; the latest version is the 2010 print version. The official title of the 15th edition is the ''New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', although it has also been promoted as ''Britannica 3''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;

====1994âpresent====
In the fifth era (1994âpresent), digital versions have been developed and released on [[Optical disc|optical media]] and online. In 1996, the ''Britannica'' was bought by [[Jacqui Safra]] at well below its estimated value, owing to the company's financial difficulties. [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc]] split in 1999. One part retained the company name and developed the print version, and the other, [[Britannica.com Inc.]], developed digital versions. Since 2001, the two companies shared a [[Chief executive officer|CEO]], originally [[Ilan Yeshua]], who has continued [[Elkan Harrison Powell|Powell's]] strategy of introducing new products with the ''Britannica'' name.

===Dedications===
The ''Britannica'' was [[Dedication (publishing)|dedicated]] to the reigning [[British monarchy|British monarch]] from 1788 to 1901 and then, upon its sale to an American partnership, to the British monarch and the President of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; Thus, the 11th edition is &quot;dedicated by Permission to His Majesty [[George V of the United Kingdom|George the Fifth]], [[King of Great Britain and Ireland]] and of the British Dominions beyond the Seas, [[Emperor of India]], and to [[William Howard Taft]], [[President of the United States of America]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_1911&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1910 | title = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition = 11th | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The order of the dedications has changed with the relative power of the United States and Britain, and with relative sales; the 1954 version of the 14th edition is &quot;Dedicated by Permission to the Heads of the Two English-Speaking Peoples, [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Dwight David Eisenhower]], President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty, [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth the Second]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_1954&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1954 | title = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition = 14th | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with this tradition, the 2007 version of the current 15th edition was &quot;dedicated by permission to the current President of the United States of America, [[George W. Bush]], and Her Majesty, [[Queen Elizabeth II]],&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_3&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition = 15th edition, ''PropÃ¦dia'' | page = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the 2010 version of the current 15th edition is &quot;dedicated by permission to [[Barack Obama]], President of the United States of America, and Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II.&quot;&lt;ref name=propedia2010&gt;''The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', ''PropÃ¦dia: Outline of Knowledge and Guide to the Brittanica'', 15th edition, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale was highlighted by the [[Lord Mayor of London]], Gilbert Inglefield, at the [[Bicentennial of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica|bicentennial of the ''Britannica'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_bicentennial&quot; /&gt;

The ''Britannica'' has a reputation for summarising knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas_1992&quot; /&gt; To further their education, many have devoted themselves to reading the entire ''Britannica'', taking anywhere from three to 22 years to do so.&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt; When [[Fatâ²h Ali Shah Qajar|Fat'h Ali]] became the [[Qajar dynasty|Shah of Persia]] in 1797, he was given a set of the ''Britannica's'' 3rd edition, which he read completely; after this feat, he extended his royal title to include &quot;Most Formidable Lord and Master of the ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_bicentennial&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1968 | title = Banquet at Guildhall in the City of London, Tuesday 15 October 1968: Celebrating the 200th Anniversary of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica and the 25th Anniversary of the Honorable William Benton as its Chair and Publisher | publisher = [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.|EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica International, Ltd.]] | location = United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[George Bernard Shaw]] claimed to have read the complete 9th editionâexcept for the science articles&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt;âand [[Richard Evelyn Byrd]] took the ''Britannica'' as reading material for his five-month stay at the [[South Pole]] in 1934, while [[Philip Beaver]] read it during a sailing expedition. More recently, [[A.J. Jacobs]], an editor at ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine, read the entire 2002 version of the 15th edition, describing his experiences in the well-received 2004 book, ''[[The Know-It-All: One Man's Humble Quest to Become the Smartest Person in the World]]''. Only two people are known to have read two independent editions: the author [[C. S. Forester]]&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt; and [[Amos Urban Shirk]], an American businessman, who read the 11th and 14th editions, devoting roughly three hours per night for four and a half years to read the 11th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Reader | publisher = The New Yorker | volume = 9 | date = 3 March 1934 | page = 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several editors-in-chief of the ''Britannica'' are likely to have read their editions completely, such as [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]] (1st edition), [[William Robertson Smith]] (9th edition), and [[Walter Yust]] (14th edition).

Topics are chosen in part by reference to the ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]'' &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; The bulk of the ''Britannica'' is devoted to geography (26% of the ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]''), biography (14%), biology and medicine (11%), literature (7%), physics and astronomy (6%), religion (5%), art (4%), Western philosophy (4%), and law (3%).&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; A complementary study of the ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'' found that geography accounted for 25% of articles, science 18%, social sciences 17%, biography 17%, and all other humanities 25%.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; Writing in 1992, one reviewer judged that the &quot;range, depth, and [[wikt:catholicity|catholicity]] of coverage [of the ''Britannica''] are unsurpassed by any other general encyclopedia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lang | first = JP | year = 1992 | title = Reference Sources for Small and Medium-Sized Libraries | edition = 5th | publisher = American Library Association | location = Chicago | page = 34 | isbn = 0-8389-3406-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Britannica'' does not cover topics in equivalent detail; for example, the whole of [[Buddhism]] and most other religions is covered in a single ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]'' article, whereas 14 articles are devoted to Christianity, comprising nearly half of all religion articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;macropaedia_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the ''Britannica'' has been lauded as the ''least'' biased of general encyclopedias marketed to Western readers&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; and praised for its biographies of important women of all eras.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;

===Criticisms===
The ''Britannica'' has received criticism, especially as editions become outdated. It is expensive to produce a completely new edition of the ''Britannica,''&lt;ref&gt;According to Kister (1994, reference 1 above), the initial 15th edition (1974) required over $32 million dollars to produce.&lt;/ref&gt; and its editors delay for as long as fiscally sensible (usually about 25 years).&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia_1954&quot;&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | year = 1954 | title = EncyclopÃ¦dia | encyclopedia = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 14th}} Aside from providing an excellent summary of the ''Britannica's'' history and early spin-off products, this article also describes the life-cycle of a typical ''Britannica'' edition. A new edition typically begins with strong sales that decay as the encyclopaedia becomes outdated. When work on a new edition is begun, sales of the old edition stop, just when fiscal needs are greatest: a new editorial staff must be assembled, articles commissioned. [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] identified this fluctuation of income as a danger to any encyclopaedia, one he hoped to overcome with continuous revision.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, despite continuous revision, the 14th edition had become outdated after 35 years (1929â1964). When American physicist [[Harvey Einbinder]] detailed its failings in his 1964 book, ''The Myth of the Britannica'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Einbinder | first = Harvey | authorlink = Harvey Einbinder | year = 1964 | title = The Myth of the Britannica | publisher = Grove Press | location = New York | isbn = 978-0-384-14050-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; the encyclopaedia was provoked to produce the 15th edition, which required 10 years of work.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; It is still difficult to keep the ''Britannica'' current; one recent critic writes, &quot;it is not difficult to find articles that are out-of-date or in need of revision&quot;, noting that the longer ''MacropÃ¦dia'' articles are more likely to be outdated than the shorter ''MicropÃ¦dia'' articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; Information in the ''MicropÃ¦dia'' is sometimes inconsistent with the corresponding ''MacropÃ¦dia'' article(s), mainly because of the failure to update one or the other.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt; The bibliographies of the ''MacropÃ¦dia'' articles have been criticised for being more out-of-date than the articles themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt;

While ''Britannica'''s authors have included authorities such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Marie Curie]], and [[Leon Trotsky]], some have been criticised for lack of expertise:&lt;ref name=&quot;burr_1911&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Burr | first = George L. | authorlink = George Lincoln Burr | year = 1911 | title = The EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica: A Dictionary of Arts, Sciences, Literature and General Information | journal = American Historical Review | volume = 17 | pages = 103â109 | doi = 10.2307/1832843 | issue = 1 | publisher = American Historical Association | jstor = 1832843}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|With a temerity almost appalling, [the ''Britannica'' contributor, Mr. Philips] ranges over nearly the whole field of European history, political, social, ecclesiastical... The grievance is that &amp;#91;this work&amp;#93; lacks authority.

Burr]]|in the ''American Historical Review'' (1911)}}

====Bias====
Authorities ranging from [[Virginia Woolf]] to professors criticised the 11th edition for having [[bourgeois]] and old-fashioned opinions on art, literature, and social sciences.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas_1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Thomas | first = Gillian | authorlink = Gillian Thomas | year = 1992 | title = A Position to Command Respect: Women and the Eleventh Britannica | publisher = [[Rowman &amp; Littlefield|Scarecrow Press]] | isbn = 0-8108-2567-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A contemporary [[Cornell University|Cornell]] professor, [[Edward B. Titchener]], wrote in 1912, &quot;the new ''Britannica'' does not reproduce the psychological atmosphere of its day and generation... Despite the halo of authority, and despite the scrutiny of the staff, the great bulk of the secondary articles in general psychology&amp;nbsp;... are not adapted to the requirements of the intelligent reader.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Titchener | first = EB | authorlink = Edward B.

====Editorial choices====
The ''Britannica'' is occasionally criticised for its editorial choices. Given its roughly constant size, the encyclopaedia has needed to reduce or eliminate some topics to accommodate others, resulting in controversial decisions. The initial 15th edition (1974â1985) was faulted for having reduced or eliminated coverage of [[children's literature]], [[military decoration]]s, and the French poet [[Joachim du Bellay]]; editorial mistakes were also alleged, such as inconsistent sorting of Japanese biographies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek_1974&quot; /&gt; Its elimination of the index was condemned, as was the apparently arbitrary division of articles into the ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'' and ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;15th_criticism&quot; /&gt; Summing up, one critic called the initial 15th edition a &quot;qualified failure...&amp;#91;that&amp;#93; cares more for juggling its format than for preserving information.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Newsweek_1974&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last = Prescott | first = Peter S. | title = The Fifteenth Britannica | journal = Newsweek | date = 8 July 1974 | pages = 71â72}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, reviewers from the [[American Library Association]] were surprised to find that most educational articles had been eliminated from the 1992 ''MacropÃ¦dia'', along with the article on [[psychology]].&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1992&quot; /&gt;

''Britannica''-appointed contributors are occasionally mistaken or unscientific. A notorious instance from the ''Britannica's'' early years is the rejection of [[Newtonian gravity]] by [[George Gleig]], the chief editor of the 3rd edition (1788â1797), who wrote that gravity was caused by the [[fire (classical element)|classical element of fire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt; However, the ''Britannica'' has also staunchly defended a scientific approach to emotional topics, as it did with [[William Robertson Smith]]'s articles on religion in the 9th edition, particularly his article stating that the [[Bible]] was not historically accurate (1875).&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt;

[[Wendy Doniger]], who is on the editorial board of Britannica,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nicholas Carr |url=http://corporate.britannica.com/board/carr.html |title=EncyclopÄdia Britannica Board of Editors |publisher=Corporate.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been criticized for her negative portrayal of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramaswamy, Krishnan ed.

====Racism and sexism====
Critics have charged past editions with racism and sexism.&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas_1992&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.2307/1320895| title = The Origins of Racism in the Public School Art Curriculum | author=F.

====Inaccuracy====
In 1912 mathematician [[L. C. Karpinski]] criticised the ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]'' for inaccuracies in articles on the [[history of mathematics]], none of which had been written by specialists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=L.

In 1917, art critic [[S. S. Van Dine|Willard Huntington Wright]] published ''Misinforming a Nation'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = WH (pen-name S. S. Van Dine) | authorlink = S. S.

Many of Wright's criticisms were addressed in later editions. However, his book was denounced as a polemic one by some contemporary reviewers; for example, the ''New York Times'' wrote that a &quot;spiteful and shallow temper...pervades the book&quot;, while ''[[The New Republic]]'' opined, &quot;it is unfortunate for Mr Wright's remorseless purpose that he has proceeded in an unscientific spirit and given so little objective justification of his criticism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;kogan_1958&quot; /&gt;

English writer and former priest [[Joseph McCabe]] claimed in ''Lies and Fallacies of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' (1947) that ''Britannica'' was censored under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church after the 11th edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McCabe | first = J | authorlink = Joseph McCabe | year = 1947 | title = Lies and Fallacies of the EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | url = http://www.infidels.org/library/historical/joseph_mccabe/lies_of_britannica.html | publisher = Haldeman-Julius | id = ASIN B0007FFJF4 | accessdate = 2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American physicist [[Harvey Einbinder]] detailed failings of the 14th edition in his 1964 book, ''The Myth of the Britannica''.

An [[Ireland|Irish]] newspaper, ''[[Evening Herald|The Evening Herald]]'', based in [[Dublin]], said in February 2010 that Britannica offers a &quot;farcically inaccurate version&quot; of the country's history. An opposition [[Seanad Ãireann|Senator]] said: &quot;This screwy version of events is a gross insult to our people and our history. That it is being used to educate our children is even more ridiculous.&quot; The [[Department of Education and Science (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]], which paid [[â¬]]450,000 to give children in school online access to the Encyclopaedia, said it was &quot;disappointed&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/britannica-errors-spark-unholy-row-2045150.html |title=Britannica errors spark unholy row â National News, Frontpage |publisher=[[Irish Independent]] |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clodagh Sheehy [http://www.herald.ie/national-news/are-they-taking-the-mick-its-the-encyclopedia-that-thinks-the-civil-war-was-between-the-north-and-south-2048016.html Are they taking the Mick?

The ''Britannica'' has always conceded that errors are inevitable. Speaking of the 3rd edition (1788â1797), its chief editor [[George Gleig]] wrote that &quot;perfection seems to be incompatible with the nature of works constructed on such a plan, and embracing such a variety of subjects.&quot; More recently (March 2006), the ''Britannica'' wrote that &quot;we in no way mean to imply that ''Britannica'' is error-free; we have never made such a claim.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;fatally_flawed&quot; /&gt; The sentiment is expressed by its original editor, [[William Smellie (encyclopedist)|William Smellie]]:

==Present status==
[[File:Encyclopaedia Britannica 15 with 2002.jpg|thumb|15th edition of the ''Britannica''. The initial volume with the green spine is the ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''; the red-spined and black-spined volumes are the ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'' and the ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]'', respectively. The last three volumes are the 2002 Book of the Year (black spine) and the two-volume index (cyan spine).]]

===Print version===
Since 1985, the ''Britannica'' has had four parts: the ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]],'' the ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]],'' the ''[[PropÃ¦dia]],'' and a two-volume index. The ''Britannica'''s articles are found in the ''Micro-'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia,'' which encompass 12 and 17 volumes, respectively, each volume having roughly one thousand pages. The 2007 ''MacropÃ¦dia'' has 699 in-depth articles, ranging in length from 2 to 310 pages and having references and named contributors. In contrast, the 2007 ''MicropÃ¦dia'' has roughly 65,000 articles, the vast majority (about 97%) of which contain fewer than 750 words, no references, and no named contributors.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt; The ''MicropÃ¦dia'' articles are intended for quick fact-checking and to help in finding more thorough information in the ''MacropÃ¦dia''. The ''MacropÃ¦dia'' articles are meant both as authoritative, well-written articles on their subjects and as storehouses of information not covered elsewhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt; The longest article (310 pages) is on the United States, and resulted from the merger of the articles on the individual [[U.S. state|states]].

Information can be found in the ''Britannica'' by following the cross-references in the ''MicropÃ¦dia'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia''; however, these are sparse, averaging one cross-reference per page.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; Hence, readers are recommended to consult instead the alphabetical index or the ''PropÃ¦dia,'' which organises the ''Britannica'''s contents by topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;index_preface&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''Index'' preface}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the ''PropÃ¦dia'' is its &quot;Outline of Knowledge&quot;, which aims to provide a logical framework for all human knowledge.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; Accordingly, the Outline is consulted by the ''Britannica'''s editors to decide which articles should be included in the ''Micro-'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; The Outline is also intended to be a study guide, to put subjects in their proper perspective, and to suggest a series of ''Britannica'' articles for the student wishing to learn a topic in depth.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_preface&quot; /&gt; However, libraries have found that it is scarcely used, and reviewers have recommended that it be dropped from the encyclopedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1992&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 1992 | title = Purchasing an Encyclopedia: 12 Points to Consider | edition = 4th | publisher = [[Booklist]] Publications, [[American Library Association]] | isbn = 0-8389-5754-4 | author = reviews by the Editorial Board of Reference Books Bulletin ; revised introduction by Sandy Whiteley.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''PropÃ¦dia'' also has color transparencies of human anatomy and several appendices listing the staff members, advisors, and contributors to all three parts of the Britannica.

Taken together, the ''MicropÃ¦dia'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia'' comprise roughly 40 million words and 24,000 images.&lt;ref name=&quot;index_preface&quot; /&gt; The two-volume index has 2,350 pages, listing the 228,274 topics covered in the ''Britannica,'' together with 474,675 subentries under those topics.&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; The ''Britannica'' generally prefers [[British English|British spelling]] over [[American English|American]];&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; for example, it uses ''colour'' (not ''color''), ''centre'' (not ''center''), and ''encyclopaedia'' (not ''encyclopedia''). However, there are exceptions to this rule, such as ''defense'' rather than ''defence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title = Defense mechanism | encyclopedia = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th | publisher = [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]] | year = 2007 | volume = 3 | pages = 957}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common alternative spellings are provided with cross-references such as &quot;Color: ''see'' Colour.&quot;

Since 1936, the articles of the ''Britannica'' have been revised on a regular schedule, with at least 10% of them considered for revision each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;encyclopedia_1954&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; According to one Britannica website, 46% of its articles were revised over the past three years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eb.com/library/print/eb.html | title = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica: School &amp; Library Site, promotional materials for the 2007 ''Britannica'' | accessdate = 11 April 2007}}{{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, according to another Britannica web-site, only 35% of the articles were revised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.britannica.com.au/product.asp?prod=HLMPKG07 | title = Australian EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, promotional materials for the 2007 ''Britannica'' | accessdate = 10 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alphabetisation of articles in the ''MicropÃ¦dia'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia'' follows strict rules.&lt;ref name=&quot;micropedia_preface&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''MicropÃ¦dia'' preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diacritic|Diacritical marks]] and non-English letters are ignored, while numerical entries such as &quot;[[War of 1812|1812, War of]]&quot; are alphabetised as if the number had been written out (&quot;Eighteen-twelve, War of&quot;). Articles with identical names are ordered first by persons, then by places, then by things. Rulers with identical names are organised first alphabetically by country and then by chronology; thus, [[Charles the Simple|Charles III]] of France precedes [[Charles I of England]], listed in ''Britannica'' as the ruler of Great Britain and Ireland. (That is, they are alphabetised as if their titles were &quot;Charles, France, 3&quot; and &quot;Charles, Great Britain and Ireland, 1&quot;.) Similarly, places that share names are organised alphabetically by country, then by ever-smaller political divisions.

In 1961 a 16 volume ''Young Children's Encyclopaedia'' was issued for children just learning to read.&lt;ref name=&quot;EB1988&quot; /&gt;

''My First Britannica'' is aimed at children ages six to twelve, and the ''Britannica Discovery Library'' is for children aged three to six (issued 1974 to 1991).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://britannicashop.britannica.co.uk/epages/Store.sf/?ObjectPath=/Shops/Britannicashop/Products/CHLD_PRNT_0551 | title = Britannica Discovery Library (issued 1974â1991) | publisher = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica (UK) Ltd. | accessdate = 11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contributors===
The 2007 print version of the ''Britannica'' boasts 4,411 contributors, many eminent in their fields, such as Nobel Laureate economist [[Milton Friedman]], astronomer [[Carl Sagan]], and surgeon [[Michael DeBakey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;macropaedia_contributors&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''| pages = 531â674}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly a quarter of the contributors are deceased, some as long ago as 1947 ([[Alfred North Whitehead]]), while another quarter are retired or [[emeritus]]. Most (approximately 98%) contribute to only a single article; however, 64 contributed to three articles, 23 contributed to four articles, 10 contributed to five articles, and 8 contributed to more than five articles. An exceptionally prolific contributor is Dr. [[Christine Sutton]] of the University of Oxford, who contributed 24 articles on [[particle physics]].

===Editorial advisors===
The ''Britannica'' has an Editorial Board of Advisors, which includes 12 distinguished scholars:&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_editorial advisors&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''| page = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.britannica.com/board/ |title=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Board of Editors |publisher=Corporate.britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; author [[Nicholas G.

The ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]'' and its ''Outline of Knowledge'' were produced by dozens of editorial advisors under the direction of [[Mortimer J. Adler]].&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_other_editorial_advisors&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''| pages = 524â530}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roughly half of these advisors have since died, including some of the Outline's chief architects: [[Rene Dubos]] (d. 1982), [[Loren Eiseley]] (d. 1977), [[Harold D. Lasswell]] (d. 1978), [[Mark Van Doren]] (d. 1972), [[Peter Ritchie Calder]] (d. 1982) and [[Mortimer J. Adler]] (d. 2001). The ''PropÃ¦dia'' also lists just under 4,000 advisors who were consulted for the unsigned ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'' articles.&lt;ref name=&quot;micropaedia_consultants&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''| pages = 675â744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate structure===
In January 1996, the ''Britannica'' was purchased from the [[Benton Foundation]] by billionaire Swiss financier [[Jacqui Safra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://chronicle.uchicago.edu/960104/britannica.shtml | title = Britannica sold by Benton Foundation | publisher = University of Chicago Chronicle | date = 4 January 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; who serves as its current Chair of the Board. In 1997, [[Don Yannias]], a long-time associate and investment advisor of Safra, became [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url = http://corporate.britannica.com/press/releases/yannias.html | title = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Announces Appointment Of Don Yannias As Chief Executive Officer | publisher = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc. | date = 4 March 1997 | accessdate = 11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new company, [[Britannica.com Inc.]] was [[corporate spin-off|spun off]] in 1999 to develop the digital versions of the ''Britannica''; Yannias assumed the role of CEO in the new company, while that of EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc. remained vacant for two years. Yannias' tenure at [[Britannica.com Inc.]] was marked by missteps, large lay-offs and financial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Abramson | first = Ronna | date = 9 April 2001 | title = Look Under &quot;M&quot; for MessâCompany Business and Marketing | journal = The Industry Standard | url = http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0HWW/is_14_4/ai_73746980 | accessdate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Yannias was replaced by [[Ilan Yeshua]], who reunited the leadership of the two companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = Ilan Yeshua Named Britannica CEO. Veteran Executive to Consolidate Operations of Encyclopaedia Britannica and Britannica.com | publisher = EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc. | date = 16 May 2001 | accessdate = 26 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yannias later returned to investment management, but remains on the ''Britannica's'' [[Board of Directors]].

In 2003, former management consultant [[Jorge Aguilar-Cauz]] was appointed President of [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]] Cauz is the senior executive and reports directly to the ''Britannica's'' Board of Directors. Cauz has been pursuing alliances with other companies and extending the ''Britannica'' brand to new educational and reference products, continuing the strategy pioneered by former CEO [[Elkan Harrison Powell]] in the mid-1930s.&lt;ref name=&quot;propedia_Chair_President&quot;&gt;{{cite book | year = 2007 | title = The New EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica | edition= 15th edition, ''[[PropÃ¦dia]]''| page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Safra's ownership, the company has experienced financial difficulties, and has responded by reducing the price of its products and implementing drastic cost cuts. According to a 2003 report in the ''[[New York Post]]'', the ''Britannica'' management has eliminated employee [[401(k)]] accounts and encouraged the use of free images. These changes have had negative impacts, as freelance contributors have waited up to six months for checks and the ''Britannica'' staff have gone years without pay rises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Cash-shy Britannica | page = 6 | publisher = [[New York Post]] | date = 11 September 2003 | url = http://www.pagesix.com/story/cash-shy+britannica | accessdate = 26 March 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.]] now owns registered [[trademark]]s on the words ''Britannica'', ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', ''MacropÃ¦dia'', ''MicropÃ¦dia'', and ''PropÃ¦dia'', as well as on its [[thistle]] logo.

==Competition==
As the ''Britannica'' is a general encyclopaedia, it does not seek to compete with specialised encyclopaedias such as the ''[[Encyclopaedia of Mathematics]]'' or the ''[[Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]'', which can devote much more space to their chosen topics. In its first years, the ''Britannica'''s main competitor was the general encyclopaedia of [[Ephraim Chambers]] and, soon thereafter, ''[[Rees's Cyclopaedia]]'' and [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge's]] ''[[Encyclopaedia Metropolitana]]''. In the 20th century, successful competitors included ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]],'' the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]],'' and the ''[[World Book Encyclopedia]]''. Nevertheless, from the 9th edition onwards, the ''Britannica'' was widely considered to have the greatest authority of any general English language encyclopaedia,&lt;ref name=&quot;thomas_1992&quot; /&gt; especially because of its broad coverage and eminent authors.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt; The print version of the ''Britannica'' is significantly more expensive than its competitors.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the ''Britannica'' has faced new challenges from digital information sources. The Internet, facilitated by the development of [[Web search engine|search engine]]s, has grown into a common source of information for many people, and provides easy access to reliable original sources and expert opinions, thanks in part to initiatives such as [[Google Book Search|Google Books]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]]'s [[MIT OpenCourseWare|release of its educational materials]] and the open [[PubMed Central]] library of the [[National Library of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title=Accessibility of information on the web |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v400/n6740/abs/400107a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=107 |issue=6740 |page=107 |year=1999 |doi=10.1038/21987 |pmid=10428673|bibcode = 1999Natur.400..107L }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lawrence S., Giles C. |title= Searching the Web: general and scientific information access | url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=739314 |journal=Communications Magazine, [[IEEE]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=116â122 |year=1999 |doi=10.1109/35.739314}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the Internet tends to provide more current coverage than print media, due to the ease with which material on the Internet can be updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Electronic publishing takes journals into a new realm |publisher=American Chemical Society | url=http://pubs.acs.org/hotartcl/cenear/980518/elec.html |accessdate=11 April 2007}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; In rapidly changing fields such as science, technology, politics, culture and modern history, the ''Britannica'' has struggled to stay up-to-date, a problem first analysed systematically by its former editor [[Walter Yust]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EB_1954&quot; /&gt; Although the ''Britannica'' is now available both in multimedia form and over the Internet, its preeminence is being challenged by other online encyclopaedias, such as [[Wikipedia]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Print encyclopaedias===
The ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' has been compared with other print encyclopaedias, both qualitatively and quantitatively.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sader_1995&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;library_association_1996&quot; /&gt; A well-known comparison is that of [[Kenneth Kister]], who gave a qualitative and quantitative comparison of the ''Britannica'' with two comparable encyclopaedias, ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia]]'' and the ''[[Encyclopedia Americana]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;kister_1994&quot;/&gt; For the quantitative analysis, ten articles were selected at random â [[circumcision]], [[Charles Drew]], [[Galileo]], [[Philip Glass]], [[heart disease]], [[IQ]], [[panda bear]], [[sexual harassment]], [[Shroud of Turin]] and [[Uzbekistan]] â and letter grades of AâD or F were awarded in four categories: coverage, accuracy, clarity, and recency. In all four categories and for all three encyclopaedias, the four average grades fell between [[grade conversion|Bâ and B+]], chiefly because none of the encyclopaedias had an article on sexual harassment in 1994. In the accuracy category, the ''Britannica'' received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s, ''Encyclopedia Americana'' received eight &quot;A&quot;s, and ''Collier's'' received one &quot;D&quot; and seven &quot;A&quot;s; thus, ''Britannica'' received an average score of 92% for accuracy to ''Americana''â²s 95% and ''Collier's'' 92%. The 1994 ''Britannica'' was faulted for publishing an inflammatory story about Charles Drew that had long been discredited. In the timeliness category, ''Britannica'' averaged an 86% to ''Americana''â²s 90% and ''Collier's'' 85%. After a more thorough qualitative comparison of all three encyclopedias, Kister recommended ''Collier's Encyclopedia'' as the superior encyclopaedia, primarily on the strength of its excellent writing, balanced presentation and easy navigation.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

''Collier's'' has not been in print since 1998. The ''Encyclopedia Americana'' was last published in 2006. ''Britannica'' was last published in 2010.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The most notable competitor of the ''Britannica'' among CD/DVD-ROM digital encyclopedias was ''[[Encarta]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;seymour_2006&quot; /&gt; now discontinued, a modern, multimedia encyclopedia that incorporated three print encyclopedias: ''[[Funk &amp; Wagnalls]]'', ''[[Collier's Encyclopedia|Collier's]]'' and the ''[[New Merit Scholar's Encyclopedia|New Merit Scholar]]''. ''Encarta'' was the top-selling multimedia encyclopaedia, based on total US retail sales from January 2000 to February 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = [[Microsoft]] | title = Microsoft EncartaâPremium 2007: Overview | url = http://www.microsoft.com/products/encarta/ProductDetails.aspx?pid=002 | accessdate = 6 April 2007}} Sales figures for January 2000 â February 2006 as provided by the [[NPD Group]].&lt;/ref&gt; Both occupied the same price range, with the ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Ultimate Reference Suite|2007 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Ultimate]]'' CD or DVD costing US$50&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Store&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://store.britannica.com/shopping/product/detailmain.jsp?itemID=765&amp;itemType=PRODUCT&amp;iMainCat=4&amp;iSubCat=14&amp;iProductID=765&amp;show=all|title= The Britannica Store| publisher = britannica.com | accessdate = 21 November 2006}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007 DVD costing US$45.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta Store&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.amazon.com/Microsoft-FB7-00442-Encarta-Premium-2007/dp/B000FL2DQS|title= Amazon.com: Microsoft Encarta Premium 2007: Software|accessdate=21 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Britannica'' contains 100,000 articles and ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster's Dictionary and Thesaurus]]'' (US only), and offers Primary and Secondary School editions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Britannica Store&quot;/&gt; ''Encarta'' contained 66,000 articles, a user-friendly Visual Browser, interactive maps, math, language and homework tools, a US and UK dictionary, and a youth edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encarta Store&quot;/&gt; Like ''Encarta'', the ''Britannica'' has been criticised for being biased towards United States audiences; the United Kingdom-related articles are updated less often, maps of the United States are more detailed than those of other countries, and it lacks a UK dictionary.&lt;ref name=&quot;seymour_2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pcadvisor.co.uk/reviews/index.cfm?reviewid=502|title= Encyclopedia face-off: Encarta vs Britannica|accessdate= 21 November 2006|last= Seymour|first= Ursula|date= 9 November 2006|work= PC Advisor|publisher= IDG}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the ''Britannica'', ''Encarta'' was available online by subscription, although some content could be accessed for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | url = http://encarta.msn.com/artcenter_0/Encyclopedia_Articles.html | title = Encarta's Encyclopedia Article Center | accessdate=11 April 2007|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kwbm2bZC|archivedate=31 October 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Internet encyclopedias===
Online alternatives to the ''Britannica'' include [[Wikipedia]], a freely available [[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[free-content]] encyclopedia. A key difference between the two encyclopaedias lies in article authorship. The 699 ''[[MacropÃ¦dia]]'' articles are generally written by identified contributors, and the roughly 65,000 ''[[MicropÃ¦dia]]'' articles are the work of the editorial staff and identified outside consultants. Thus, a ''Britannica'' article either has known authorship &lt;!--&quot;...identified authors&quot; can parse as verb--&gt; or a set of possible authors (the editorial staff). With the exception of the editorial staff, most of the ''Britannica'''s contributors are experts in their fieldâsome are Nobel laureates.&lt;ref name=&quot;macropaedia_contributors&quot; /&gt; By contrast, the articles of Wikipedia are written by a community of editors with varying levels of expertise: most editors do not claim any particular expertise; of those who do, many are [[anonymity|anonymous]] and have no verifiable credentials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics | title = Total number of users of the English-language Wikipedia | accessdate = 11 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Giles, Jim (15 December 2005). &quot;[http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051212/box/438900a_BX1.html Challenges of being a Wikipedian]&quot; In: &quot;[http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051212/full/438900a.html Internet encyclopaedias go head to head]&quot;. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 438: 900â901. {{doi|10.1038/438900a}}. Retrieved on 11 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Another difference is the pace of article change: the ''Britannica'' is published in print every few years, while Wikipedia's articles are likely to update frequently. Robert McHenry stated that Wikipedia cannot hope to rival the ''Britannica'' in [[accuracy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;FBE&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Robert | last=McHenry | title=The Faith-Based Encyclopedia | work=TCS Daily | date=15 November 2004 | url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=111504A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2005, in a study, the journal ''Nature'' chose articles from both sites in a wide range of topics and sent them to what it called &quot;relevant&quot; field experts for peer review. The experts then compared the competing articlesâone from each site on a given topicâside by side, but were not told which article came from which site. ''Nature'' got back 42 usable reviews from its field of experts.

In the end, the journal found just eight serious errors, such as general misunderstandings of vital concepts, in the articles. Of those, four came from each site. They did, however, discover a series of factual errors, omissions or misleading statements. All told, Wikipedia had 162 such problems, while Britannica had 123.

That averages out to 2.92 mistakes per article for ''Britannica'' and 3.86 for Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giles_Nature_study_2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and called for a &quot;prompt&quot; retraction. It noted that two of the articles in the study were taken from a ''Britannica'' year book, and not the encyclopedia; another two were from ''Compton's Encyclopedia'' (called the ''Britannica Student Encyclopedia'' on the company's web site). The rebuttal went on to mention that some of the articles presented to reviewers were combinations of several articles, and that other articles were merely excerpts but were penalised for factual omissions. The company also noted that several facts classified as errors by ''Nature'' were minor spelling variations, and that several of its alleged errors were matters of interpretation. ''Nature'' defended its story and declined to retract, stating that, as it was comparing Wikipedia with the web version of Britannica, it used whatever relevant material was available on Britannica's website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Interviewed in February 2009, the managing director of Britannica UK said: {{quote|Wikipedia is a fun site to use and has a lot of interesting entries on there, but their approach wouldn't work for ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica''. My job is to create more awareness of our very different approaches to publishing in the public mind. They're a chisel, we're a drill, and you need to have the correct tool for the job.&lt;ref name=&quot;econsultancy_20090210&quot;/&gt;}}

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote1&quot;&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''Supplement to the fourth, fifth, and sixth editions of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. With preliminary dissertations on the history of the sciences.''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote2&quot;&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; The 8th to 14th editions included a separate index volume.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote3&quot;&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; The 9th edition featured articles by notables of the day, such as [[James Clerk Maxwell|James Maxwell]] on electricity and magnetism, and [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] (who became Lord Kelvin) on heat.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote4&quot;&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; The 10th edition included a maps volume and a cumulative index volume for the 9th and 10th edition volumes: ''the new volumes, constituting, in combination with the existing volumes of the 9th ed., the 10th ed.&amp;nbsp;... and also supplying a new, distinctive, and independent library of reference dealing with recent events and developments''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote5&quot;&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; ''Vols. 30â32&amp;nbsp;... the New volumes constituting, in combination with the twenty-nine volumes of the eleventh edition, the twelfth edition''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote6&quot;&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; This supplement replaced the previous supplement: ''The three new supplementary volumes constituting, with the volumes of the latest standard edition, the thirteenth edition.''

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote7&quot;&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; This edition was the first to be kept up to date by continual (usually annual) revision.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote8&quot;&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; The 15th edition (introduced as &quot;Britannica 3&quot;) was published in three parts: a 10-volume ''MicropÃ¦dia'' (which contained short articles and served as an index), a 19-volume ''MacropÃ¦dia'', plus the ''PropÃ¦dia'' (see text). It was reorganised in 1985 to have 12 and 17 volumes in the ''Micro-'' and ''MacropÃ¦dia''.

&lt;sup id=&quot;editionnote9&quot;&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; In 1985, the system was modified by adding a separate two-volume index; the ''MacropÃ¦dia'' articles were further consolidated into fewer, larger ones (for example, the previously separate articles about the 50 U.S. states were all included into the &quot;United States of America&quot; article), with some medium-length articles moved to the ''MicropÃ¦dia''.

The first CD-ROM edition was issued in 1994. At that time also an online version was offered for paid subscription. In 1999 this was offered for free, and no revised print versions appeared. The experiment was ended in 2001 and a new printed set was issued in 2001.
