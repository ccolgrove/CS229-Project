==Botany==
[[File:Mentha-piperita.JPG|thumb|right|Peppermint flowers]]
Peppermint was first described in 1753 by [[Carolus Linnaeus]] from specimens that had been collected in England; he treated it as a [[species]],&lt;ref name=cl&gt;Linnaeus, C. (1753). ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' 2: 576â577.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is now universally agreed to be a hybrid.&lt;ref name=harley&gt;Harley, R. M. (1975). ''Mentha'' L. In: Stace, C. A., ed. ''Hybridization and the flora of the British Isles'' page 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a [[herbaceous]] rhizomatous [[perennial plant]] growing to {{convert|30|-|90|cm|in|abbr=on}} tall, with smooth stems, square in cross section. The [[rhizome]]s are wide-spreading, fleshy, and bare fibrous [[root]]s. The [[leaf|leaves]] are from {{convert|4|-|9|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and {{convert|1.5|-|4|cm|in|abbr=on}} cm broad, dark green with reddish veins, and with an acute apex and coarsely toothed margins. The leaves and stems are usually slightly hairy. The [[flower]]s are purple, {{convert|6|-|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} long, with a four-lobed corolla about {{convert|5|mm|in|abbr=on}} diameter; they are produced in whorls (verticillasters) around the stem, forming thick, blunt spikes. Flowering is from mid to late summer. The [[chromosome]] number is variable, with 2n counts of 66, 72, 84, and 120 recorded.&lt;ref name=fnwe/&gt;&lt;ref name=rhs&gt;Huxley, A., ed. (1992). ''New RHS Dictionary of Gardening''. Macmillan ISBN 0-333-47494-5.{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=blamey&gt;Blamey, M. &amp; Grey-Wilson, C. (1989). ''Flora of Britain and Northern Europe''. ISBN 0-340-40170-2{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ecology==
Peppermint typically occurs in moist habitats, including stream sides and drainage ditches. Being a hybrid, it is usually [[infertility|sterile]], producing no [[seed]]s and reproducing only [[vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]], spreading by its [[rhizomes]]. If placed, it can grow anywhere, with a few exceptions.&lt;ref name=fnwe/&gt;&lt;ref name=blamey/&gt;

Outside of its native range, areas where peppermint was formerly grown for oil often have an abundance of feral plants, and it is considered [[invasive species|invasive]] in [[Australia]], the [[GalÃ¡pagos Islands]], [[New Zealand]],&lt;ref name=pier&gt;Pacific Island Ecosystems at Risk: [http://www.hear.org/pier/species/mentha_x_piperita.htm ''Mentha x piperita'']&lt;/ref&gt; and in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=usda&gt;USDA Plants Profile: [http://plants.usda.gov/java/profile?symbol=MEPI ''Mentha x piperita'']&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Great Lakes]] region, noted since 1843.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= List of invasive species in the Great Lakes Great Lakes United / Union Saint-Laurent Grands Lacs |url= http://www.glu.org/en/node/199 |accessdate=2009-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultivation==
Peppermint generally grows best in moist, shaded locations, and expands by underground [[stolons]]. Young shoots are taken from from old stocks and dibbled into the ground about 1.5 feet apart.  They grow quickly and cover the ground with runners if it is permanently moist.  For the home gardener, it is often grown in containers to restrict rapid spreading. It grows best with a good supply of water, without being water-logged, and planted in areas with part-sun to shade.

The leaves and flowering tops are used; they are collected as soon as the flowers begin to open and can be dried. The wild form of the plant is less suitable for this purpose, with cultivated plants having been selected for more and better oil content. They may be allowed to lie and wilt a little before distillation, or they may be taken directly to the still.

==Uses==
[[File:Koeh-095.jpg|thumb|right|1887 illustration]]
Peppermint has a long tradition of medicinal use, with archaeological evidence placing its use at least as far back as ten thousand years ago.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

Peppermint has a high [[menthol]] content, and is often used as [[Peppermint tea|tea]] and for flavouring [[ice cream]], [[confectionery]], [[chewing gum]], and [[toothpaste]]. The oil also contains [[menthone]] and menthyl esters, particularly [[menthyl acetate]].&lt;ref&gt;''PDR for Herbal Medicines'', 4th Edition, Thomson Healthcare, page 640.  ISBN 978-1563636783&lt;/ref&gt; Dried peppermint typically has 0.3-0.4% of volatile oil containing menthol (29-48%), [[menthone]] (20-31%), menthyl acetate (3-10%), menthofuran (1-7%) and many trace constituents including [[limonene]], [[pulegone]], [[eucalyptol]], and [[pinene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Common Natural Ingredients used in food, drugs and cosmetics |first=A. Y. |last=Leung |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |location=New York |year=1980 |page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the oldest and most popular flavour of mint-flavoured confectionery. Peppermint can also be found in some shampoos and soaps, which give the hair a minty scent and produce a cooling sensation on the skin. Used in this way, it has been known to help with insomnia.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Peppermint has promising radioprotective effects for cancer patients undergoing cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Baliga |first=M. S. |last2=Rao |first2=S. |title=Radioprotective potential of mint: A brief review |journal=[[Journal of Cancer Research and Therapeutics|J Cancer Res Ther.]] |year=2010 |volume=6 |issue=3 |pages=255â262 |doi= |url=http://www.doaj.org/doaj?func=abstract&amp;id=701298 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aroma of peppermint has been found to enhance [[memory]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss M, Hewitt S, Moss L, Wesnes K.&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moss |first1=Mark |last2=Hewitt |first2=Steven |last3=Moss |first3=Lucy |last4=Wesnes |first4=Kieth |title=Modulation of cognitive performance and mood by aromas of peppermint and ylang-ylang |journal=The International journal of neuroscience |volume=118 |issue=1 |pages=59â77 |year=2008 |pmid=18041606 |doi=10.1080/00207450601042094 |quote=Peppermint was found to enhance memory whereas ylang-ylang impaired it, and lengthened processing speed. In terms of subjective mood peppermint increased alertness and ylang-ylang decreased it, but significantly increased calmness}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such, it can be administered by instructors to their students before [[examinations]], to aid recall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moss M, Hewitt S, Moss L, Wesnes K.&quot;/&gt;

Peppermint flowers are large nectar producers and [[honey bee]]s as well as other nectar harvesting organisms forage them heavily. A mild, pleasant varietal [[honey]] can be produced if there is a sufficient area of plants.

===Peppermint oil===
Peppermint oil has a high concentration of natural pesticides, mainly menthone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Krieger2001&quot;&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Irving Krieger|title=Handbook of Pesticide Toxicology: Principles|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ib8Qhju9EQEC&amp;pg=PA823|accessdate=11 October 2010|year=2001|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780124262607|pages=823}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Italian investigators reported that 75% of the patients in their study who took peppermint  oil capsules for four weeks had a major reduction in [[irritable bowel syndrome]] (IBS) symptoms, compared with just 38% of those who took a [[placebo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last1=Cappello |first1=G |last2=Spezzaferro |first2=M |last3=Grossi |first3=L |last4=Manzoli |first4=L |last5=Marzio |first5=L |title=Peppermint oil (MintoilÂ®) in the treatment of irritable bowel syndrome: A prospective double blind placebo-controlled randomized trial |journal=Digestive and Liver Disease |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=530â6 |year=2007 |pmid=17420159 |doi=10.1016/j.dld.2007.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second study in 2010, conducted in Iran, found similar results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Shahin |last1=Merat |first2=Shadi |last2=Khalili |first3=Pardise |last3=Mostajabi |first4=Anahita |last4=Ghorbani |first5=Reza |last5=Ansari |first6=Reza |last6=Malekzadeh |title=The effect of enteric-coated, delayed-release peppermint oil on irritable bowel syndrome |journal=Digestive diseases and sciences |volume=55 |issue=5 |pages=1385â90 |year=2010 |pmid=19507027 |doi=10.1007/s10620-009-0854-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;  2011 research showed that peppermint acts through a specific anti-pain channel called TRPM8 to reduce pain sensing fibres.  The authors feel that this study provides information that  is potentially the first step in determining a new type of mainstream clinical treatment for Irritable Bowel Syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/04/110419101234.htm |title=How Peppermint Helps to Relieve Irritable Bowel Syndrome |date=April 20, 2011 |work=ScienceDaily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, some poorly designed earlier trials found that peppermint oil has the ability to reduce colicky abdominal pain due to IBS with an [[number needed to treat|NNT]] (number needed to treat) around 3.1,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicine.ox.ac.uk/bandolier/booth/alternat/AT022.html |title=Peppermint oil for irritable bowel syndrome |work=[[Bandolier (journal)|Bandolier]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the oil is an irritant to the stomach in the quantity required and therefore needs wrapping for delayed release in the intestine.  This could also be achieved by using the whole herb or leaves rather than the volatile components alone.  Peppermint relaxes the gastro-esophageal sphincter, thus promoting belching.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Peppermint oil is also used in some Chinese medicines, such as the medicated oil [[Po Sum On]].

== Toxicology ==
The toxicity studies of the plant have received controversial results.  Some authors reported that the plant may induce hepatic diseases (liver disease), while others found that it protects against liver damage that is caused by heavy metals.&lt;ref name=ibhe1&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1191/0960327104ht412oa |last1=Akdogan |first1=M |last2=Ozguner |first2=M |last3=Aydin |first3=G |last4=Gokalp |first4=O |title=Investigation of biochemical and histopathological effects of Mentha piperita Labiatae and Mentha spicata Labiatae on liver tissue in rats |journal=Human &amp; experimental toxicology |volume=23 |issue=1 |pages=21â8 |year=2004 |pmid=15027812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pemp&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sharma |first1=A |last2=Sharma |first2=MK |last3=Kumar |first3=M |title=Protective effect of Mentha piperita against arsenic-induced toxicity in liver of Swiss albino mice. |journal=Basic &amp; clinical pharmacology &amp; toxicology |volume=100 |issue=4 |pages=249â57 |year=2007 |pmid=17371529 |doi=10.1111/j.1742-7843.2006.00030.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to that, the toxicities of the plant seem to vary from one cultivar to another&lt;ref name=ibhe&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1191/0960327103ht332oa |last1=Akdogan |first1=M |last2=KilinÃ§ |first2=I |last3=Oncu |first3=M |last4=Karaoz |first4=E |last5=Delibas |first5=N |title=Investigation of biochemical and histopathological effects of Mentha piperita L. and Mentha spicata L. on kidney tissue in rats |journal=Human &amp; experimental toxicology |volume=22 |issue=4 |pages=213â9 |year=2003 |pmid=12755472}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are dose dependent.&lt;ref name=ibhe1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=empm&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1191/0748233704th206oa |last1=Akdogan |first1=M |last2=Gultekin |first2=F |last3=Yontem |first3=M |title=Effect of Mentha piperita (Labiatae) and Mentha spicata (Labiatae) on iron absorption in rats |journal=Toxicology and industrial health |volume=20 |issue=6â10 |pages=119â22 |year=2004 |pmid=15941008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is probably attributed from the content level of [[pulegone]].&lt;ref name=nvpc&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farley |first1=Derek R. |last2=Howland |first2=Valerie |title=The natural variation of the pulegone content in various oils of peppermint |journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture |volume=31 |pages=1143â51 |year=1980 |doi=10.1002/jsfa.2740311104 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
