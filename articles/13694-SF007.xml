In 1983, [[Microsoft]] announced the development of [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) for its own [[operating system]] ([[MS-DOS]]), which had shipped for [[IBM PC]] and compatible computers since 1981. The product line has changed from a GUI product to a modern [[operating system]] over two families of design, each with its own [[codebase]] and default file system.

The 3.x and 4.x family includes [[Windows 3.11]], [[Windows 95]], [[Windows 98]], and [[Windows Me]]. [[Windows for Workgroups|Windows for Workgroups 3.11]] achieved the breakthrough from 16- to 32-bit networking and 32-bit disk access. [[Windows 95]] completed the migration to 32-bit code and started an entirely new user interface, most of which is still used today.

[[Windows NT]] family started with NT 3.1 in 1993. Modern Windows operating system versions are based on the newer [[Windows NT]] kernel that was originally intended for [[OS/2]]. Windows runs on [[IA-32]], [[x86-64]], and [[Itanium]] processors. Microsoft is also working to bring Windows NT onto ARM in the next release of Windows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2011/jan11/01-05socsupport.mspx Microsoft Announces Support of System on a Chip Architectures From Intel, AMD, and ARM for Next Version of Windows: January 5, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier versions also ran on the [[Intel i860|i860]], [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]], [[Fairchild Semiconductor|Fairchild]] [[Clipper architecture|Clipper]], and [[PowerPC]] architectures. Some work was done to port it to the [[SPARC]] architecture.

The NT kernel borrows many techniques from [[OpenVMS|VMS]]. With Windows NT 4.0 in 1996, the [[shell (computing)|shell]] changed from Program Manager to Explorer.

==Windows 1.0 and Windows 2.0==
{{Main|Windows 1.0|Windows 2.0|Windows 2.1x}}
The first independent version of Microsoft Windows, version 1.0, released on 20 November 1985, achieved little popularity. It was originally going to be called &quot;Interface Manager&quot; but [[Rowland Hanson]], the head of marketing at Microsoft, convinced the company that the name ''Windows'' would be more appealing to consumers.
Windows 1.0 was not a complete operating system, but rather an &quot;operating environment&quot; that extended [[MS-DOS]], and shared the latter's inherent flaws and problems.

The first version of Microsoft Windows included a simple graphics painting program called [[Windows Paint]]; [[Windows Write]], a simple [[word processor]]; an appointment &quot;calendar&quot;; a &quot;cardfiler&quot;; a &quot;[[Notepad (Windows)|notepad]]&quot;; a &quot;clock&quot;; a &quot;[[control panel (computer)|control panel]]&quot;; a &quot;[[computer terminal]]&quot;; &quot;[[Clipboard (software)|Clipboard]]&quot;; and [[RAM]] driver. It also included the [[MS-DOS Executive]] and a game called [[Reversi]].

Microsoft had worked with [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] to develop several [[Desk Accessory|Desk Accessories]] and other minor pieces of software that were included with early [[Macintosh]] system software.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}
As part of the related business negotiations, Microsoft had licensed certain aspects of the Macintosh user interface from Apple; in later litigation, a district court summarized these aspects as &quot;screen displays&quot;.
In the development of Windows 1.0, Microsoft intentionally limited its borrowing of certain GUI elements from the Macintosh user interface, to comply with its license.

For example, windows were only displayed &quot;tiled&quot; on the screen; that is, they could not overlap or overlie one another.  There was no trash can icon with which to delete files, since Apple claimed ownership of the rights to that paradigm.

Microsoft Windows version 2 came out on 9 December 1987, and proved slightly more popular than its predecessor.
Much of the popularity for [[Windows 2.0]] came by way of its inclusion as a &quot;run-time version&quot; with Microsoft's new graphical applications, [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] and [[Microsoft Word|Word for Windows]]. They could be run from MS-DOS, executing Windows for the duration of their activity, and closing down Windows upon exit.

Microsoft Windows received a major boost around this time when [[Aldus]] [[Adobe PageMaker|PageMaker]] appeared in a Windows version, having previously run only on [[Apple Macintosh|Macintosh]].
Some computer historians{{Who|date=February 2010}} date this, the first appearance of a significant ''and'' non-Microsoft application for Windows, as the start of the success of Windows.

Versions 2.0x used the [[real mode|real-mode]] [[computer storage|memory]] model, which confined it to a maximum of 1 [[megabyte]] of memory.
In such a configuration, it could run under another multitasker like [[DESQview]], which used the [[Intel 80286|286]] [[protected mode]].


Later, two new versions were released: [[Windows/286]] 2.1 and [[Windows/386]] 2.1. Like prior versions of Windows, Windows/286 2.1 used the real-mode memory model, but was the first version to support the [[High Memory Area]]. Windows/386 2.1 had a protected mode kernel with [[LIM EMS|LIM-standard EMS]] [[Hardware emulation|emulation]], the predecessor to [[Extended memory|XMS]] which would finally change the topology of [[IBM]] PC computing. All Windows and DOS-based applications at the time were real mode, running over the protected mode kernel by using the virtual [[Intel 8086|8086]] mode, which was new with the 80386 processor.

Version 2.03, and later 3.0, faced [[Apple v. Microsoft|challenges from Apple]] over its overlapping windows and other features Apple charged mimicked the ostensibly copyrighted &quot;look and feel&quot; of its operating system and &quot;embodie[d] and generated a copy of the Macintosh&quot; in its OS. Judge [[William Schwarzer]] dropped all but 10 of Apple's 189 claims of copyright infringement, and ruled that most of the remaining 10 were over uncopyrightable ideas.

==Success with Windows 3.0==
{{Main|Windows 3.0}}
Microsoft Windows scored a significant success with Windows 3.0, released in 1990. In addition to improved capabilities given to native applications, Windows also allowed users to better [[Computer multitasking|multitask]] older MS-DOS based software compared to Windows/386, thanks to the introduction of [[virtual memory]].

Windows 3.0's user interface was finally a serious competitor to the user interface of the [[Macintosh]] computer.  PCs had improved graphics by this time, due to [[VGA]] video cards, and the protected/enhanced mode allowed Windows applications to use more memory in a more painless manner than their DOS counterparts could.  [[Windows 3.0]] could run in real, standard, or 386 enhanced modes, and was compatible with any Intel processor from the [[Intel 8086|8086]]/[[Intel 8088|8088]] up to the [[Intel 80286|80286]] and [[Intel 80386|80386]].  This was the first version to run Windows programs in protected mode, although the 386 enhanced mode [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] was an enhanced version of the protected mode kernel in Windows/386.

A &quot;multimedia&quot; version, Windows 3.0 with Multimedia Extensions 1.0, was released in October 1991. This was bundled with &quot;multimedia upgrade kits&quot;, comprising a [[CD-ROM drive]] and a [[sound card]], such as the [[Creative Labs]] [[Sound Blaster Pro]]. This version was the precursor to the multimedia features available in [[Windows 3.1]] and later, and was part of Microsoft's specification for the [[Multimedia PC]].

The features listed above and growing market support from application software developers made Windows 3.0 wildly successful, selling around 10 million copies in the two years before the release of version 3.1. Windows 3.0 became a major source of income for Microsoft, and led the company to revise some of its earlier plans. It was discontinued on 31 December 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The end of an era - Windows 3.x |author=Mark Ward |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7707016.stm |publisher=BBC News |date=5 November 2008 |accessdate=22 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==A step sideways: OS/2==
[[File:Os2logo.svg||thumb|OS/2 logo]]

{{Main|OS/2}}

During the mid to late 1980s, Microsoft and [[IBM]] had cooperatively been developing [[OS/2]] as a successor to DOS. OS/2 would take full advantage of the aforementioned protected mode of the [[Intel 80286]] processor and up to 16&amp;nbsp;MB of memory. OS/2 1.0, released in 1987, supported swapping and multitasking and allowed running of [[DOS]] executables.

A [[graphical user interface|GUI]], called the Presentation Manager (PM), was not available with OS/2 until version 1.1, released in 1988. Its [[application programming interface|API]] was incompatible with Windows. (Among other things, Presentation Manager placed X,Y coordinate 0,0 at the ''bottom'' left of the screen like [[Cartesian coordinates]], while Windows put 0,0 at the ''top'' left of the screen like most other computer window systems.) Version 1.2, released in 1989, introduced a new [[file system]], [[High Performance File System|HPFS]], to replace the [[File Allocation Table|FAT]] file system.

By the early 1990s, conflicts developed in the Microsoft/IBM relationship. They cooperated with each other in developing their PC operating systems, and had access to each others' code. Microsoft wanted to further develop Windows, while IBM desired for future work to be based on OS/2. In an attempt to resolve this tension, IBM and Microsoft agreed that IBM would develop OS/2 2.0, to replace OS/2 1.3 and Windows 3.0, while Microsoft would develop a new operating system, OS/2 3.0, to later succeed OS/2 2.0.

This agreement soon however fell apart, and the Microsoft/IBM relationship was terminated. IBM continued to develop OS/2, while Microsoft changed the name of its (as yet unreleased) OS/2 3.0 to [[Windows NT]]. Both retained the rights to use OS/2 and Windows technology developed up to the termination of the agreement; Windows NT, however, was to be written anew, mostly independently (see below).

After an interim 1.3 version to fix up many remaining problems with the 1.x series, IBM released OS/2 version 2.0 in 1992. This was a major improvement: it featured a new, object-oriented GUI, the Workplace Shell (WPS), that included a desktop and was considered by many to be OS/2's best feature. Microsoft would later imitate much of it in Windows 95. Version 2.0 also provided a full 32-bit API, offered smooth multitasking and could take advantage of the 4&amp;nbsp;gigabytes of address space provided by the [[Intel 80386]]. Still, much of the system had 16-bit code internally which required, among other things, device drivers to be 16-bit code also. This was one of the reasons for the chronic shortage of OS/2 drivers for the latest devices. Version 2.0 could also run DOS and Windows 3.0 programs, since IBM had retained the right to use the DOS and Windows code as a result of the breakup.

==Windows 3.1 and NT 3.x==
{{Main|Windows 3.1x|Windows NT|Windows NT 3.1|Windows NT 3.5|Windows NT 3.51}}
In response to the impending release of OS/2 2.0, Microsoft developed [[Windows 3.1x#Windows 3.1|Windows 3.1]], which included several minor improvements to Windows 3.0 (such as display of [[TrueType]] scalable fonts, developed jointly with Apple), but primarily consisted of bugfixes and multimedia support. It also excluded support for Real mode, and only ran on an [[80286]] or better processor. Later Microsoft also released Windows 3.11, a touch-up to Windows 3.1 which included all of the patches and updates that followed the release of Windows 3.1 in 1992. Around the same time, Microsoft released Windows for Workgroups (WfW), which was available both as an add-on for existing Windows 3.1 installations and in a version that included the base Windows environment and the networking extensions all in one package. Windows for Workgroups included improved network drivers and protocol stacks, and support for peer-to-peer networking. One optional download for WfW was the &quot;Wolverine&quot; TCP/IP protocol stack, which allowed for easy access to the Internet through corporate networks. There were two versions of Windows for Workgroups, WfW 3.1 and WfW 3.11. Unlike prior versions, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 ran in 386 enhanced mode only, and needs at least an [[80386]]SX processor.

All these versions continued version 3.0's impressive sales pace. Even though the 3.1x series still lacked most of the important features of OS/2, such as long file names, a desktop, or protection of the system against misbehaving applications, Microsoft quickly took over the OS and GUI markets for the [[IBM PC]]. The [[Windows API]] became the de-facto standard for consumer software.

Meanwhile, Microsoft continued to develop Windows NT. The main architect of the system was [[Dave Cutler]], one of the chief architects of [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] at [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (later acquired by [[Compaq]], now part of [[Hewlett-Packard]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ntvmsrussinovich&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft hired him in August 1988 to create a successor to OS/2, but Cutler created a completely new system instead. Cutler had been developing a follow-on to [[Virtual Memory System|VMS]] at [[Digital Equipment Corporation|DEC]] called Mica, and when DEC dropped the project he brought the expertise and around 20 engineers with him to Microsoft. DEC also believed he brought Mica's code to Microsoft and sued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft eventually paid US$150 million and agreed to support DEC's [[DEC Alpha|Alpha]] CPU chip in NT.

Windows NT 3.1 (Microsoft marketing wanted Windows NT to appear to be a continuation of Windows 3.1) arrived in Beta form to developers at the July 1992 [[Professional Developers Conference]] in [[San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft announced at the conference its intentions to develop a successor to both Windows NT and Windows 3.1's replacement ([[Windows 95]], codenamed Chicago), which would unify the two into one operating system. This successor was codenamed [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]]. In hindsight, Cairo was a much more difficult project than Microsoft had anticipated and, as a result, NT and Chicago would not be unified until [[Windows XP]]âalbeit [[Windows 2000]], oriented to business, had already unified most of the systemâs bolts and gears, it was XP that was sold to home consumers like Windows 95 and came to be viewed as the final unified OS. Parts of Cairo have still not made it into Windows as of 2009 - specifically, the [[WinFS]] file system, which was the much touted Object File System of Cairo. Microsoft announced that they have discontinued the separate release of WinFS for Windows XP and Windows Vista&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and will gradually incorporate the technologies developed for WinFS in other products and technologies, notably [[Microsoft SQL Server]].

Driver support was lacking due to the increased programming difficulty in dealing with NT's superior hardware abstraction model. This problem plagued the NT line all the way through Windows 2000. Programmers complained that it was too hard to write drivers for NT, and hardware developers were not going to go through the trouble of developing drivers for a small segment of the market. Additionally, although allowing for good performance and fuller exploitation of system resources, it was also resource-intensive on limited hardware, and thus was only suitable for larger, more expensive machines.

However, these same features made Windows NT perfect for the [[local area network|LAN]] server market (which in 1993 was experiencing a rapid boom, as office networking was becoming common).  NT also had advanced network connectivity options and [[NTFS]], an efficient file system. Windows NT version 3.51 was Microsoft's entry into this field, and took away market share from Novell (the dominant player) in the following years.

One of Microsoft's biggest advances initially developed for Windows NT was a new 32-bit API, to replace the legacy 16-bit [[Windows API]]. This API was called [[Win32]], and from then on Microsoft referred to the older 16-bit API as [[Win16]].  The Win32 API had three main implementations: one for Windows NT, one for [[Win32s]] (which was a subset of Win32 which could be used on Windows 3.1 systems), and one for Chicago. Thus Microsoft sought to ensure some degree of compatibility between the Chicago design and Windows NT, even though the two systems had radically different internal architectures. Windows NT was the first Windows operating system based on a hybrid kernel.

==Windows 95==
{{Main|Windows 95}}

After [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.11]], Microsoft began to develop a new consumer oriented version of the operating system codenamed Chicago. Chicago was designed to have support for 32-bit preemptive multitasking like OS/2 and Windows NT, although a 16-bit kernel would remain for the sake of backward compatibility. The Win32 [[Application programming interface|API]] first introduced with Windows NT was adopted as the standard 32-bit programming interface, with Win16 compatibility being preserved through a technique known as &quot;[[thunk (compatibility mapping)|thunking]]&quot;. A new GUI was not originally planned as part of the release, although elements of the Cairo user interface were borrowed and added as other aspects of the release (notably Plug and Play) slipped.

Microsoft did not change all of the Windows code to 32-bit; parts of it remained 16-bit (albeit not directly using [[real mode]]) for reasons of compatibility, performance, and development time. Additionally it was necessary to carry over design decisions from earlier versions of Windows for reasons of backwards compatibility, even if these design decisions no longer matched a more modern computing environment. These factors eventually began to impact the operating system's efficiency and stability.

Microsoft marketing adopted [[Windows 95]] as the product name for Chicago when it was released on 24 August 1995. Microsoft had a double gain from its release: first, it made it impossible for consumers to run Windows 95 on a cheaper, non-Microsoft DOS; secondly, although traces of DOS were never completely removed from the system and MS DOS 7 would be loaded briefly as a part of the [[booting]] process, Windows 95 applications ran solely in 386 enhanced mode, with a flat 32-bit address space and [[virtual memory]]. These features make it possible for Win32 applications to address up to 2 [[gigabyte]]s of virtual RAM (with another 2&amp;nbsp;GB reserved for the operating system), and in theory prevented them from inadvertently corrupting the memory space of other Win32 applications. In this respect the functionality of Windows 95 moved closer to [[Windows NT]], although Windows 95/98/ME did not support more than 512 [[megabyte]]s of physical RAM without obscure system tweaks.

[[IBM]] continued to market OS/2, producing later versions in OS/2 3.0 and 4.0 (also called Warp). Responding to complaints about OS/2 2.0's high demands on computer hardware, version 3.0 was significantly optimized both for speed and size. Before Windows 95 was released, OS/2 Warp 3.0 was even shipped preinstalled with several large German hardware vendor chains. However, with the release of Windows 95, OS/2 began to lose market share.

It is probably impossible to choose one specific reason why OS/2 failed to gain much market share. While OS/2 continued to run Windows 3.1 applications, it lacked support for anything but the [[Win32s]] subset of Win32 API (see above). Unlike with Windows 3.1, IBM did not have access to the source code for Windows 95 and was unwilling to commit the time and resources to emulate the moving target of the Win32 API. IBM later introduced OS/2 into the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case, blaming unfair marketing tactics on Microsoft's part.

Microsoft went on to release five different versions of Windows 95:
* Windows 95 - original release
* Windows 95 A - included Windows 95 OSR1 [[Slipstream (computing)|slipstreamed]] into the installation.
* Windows 95 B - (OSR2) included several major enhancements, [[Internet Explorer]] (IE) 3.0 and full [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] file system support.
* Windows 95 B USB - (OSR2.1) included basic [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] support.
* Windows 95&amp;nbsp;C - (OSR2.5) included all the above features, plus IE 4.0. This was the last 95 version produced.

OSR2, OSR2.1, and OSR2.5 were not released to the general public; rather, they were available only to [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEMs]] that would preload the OS onto computers. Some companies sold new hard drives with OSR2 preinstalled (officially justifying this as needed due to the hard drive's capacity).

The first [[Microsoft Plus!]] add-on pack was sold for Windows 95.

==Windows NT 4.0==


{{Main|Windows NT 4.0}}

[[Windows NT 4.0]] was the successor of [[Windows NT 3.51|3.51]] (1995) and [[Windows NT 3.5|3.5]] (1994). Microsoft released Windows NT 4.0 to manufacturing in July 1996, one year after the release of Windows 95. Major new features included the new Explorer shell from Windows 95, scalability and feature improvements to the core [[Architecture of Windows NT|architecture]], kernel, [[Windows USER|USER32]], [[Component Object Model|COM]] and [[MSRPC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NT4UndertheHood&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/archive/S413.aspx |title=Poking Around Under the Hood: A Programmer's View of Windows NT 4.0 |publisher=Microsoft.com |date= |accessdate=20 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows NT 4.0 came in four versions:
* Windows NT 4.0 Workstation
* Windows NT 4.0 Server
* Windows NT 4.0 Server, Enterprise Edition (includes support for 8-way [[Symmetric multiprocessing|SMP]] and [[cluster (computing)|clustering]])
* Windows NT 4.0 Terminal Server

==Windows 98==
{{Main|Windows 98}}

On 25 June 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98 (codenamed Memphis). It included new hardware drivers and better support for the [[File Allocation Table|FAT32]] file system which allows support for disk partitions larger than the 2&amp;nbsp;GB maximum accepted by Windows 95. The [[USB]] support in Windows 98 is far superior to the token, unreliable support provided by the [[Original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] editions of Windows 95. It also controversially integrated the [[Internet Explorer]] browser into the Windows GUI and Windows Explorer file manager, prompting the opening of the [[United States v. Microsoft]] case, dealing with the question of whether Microsoft was abusing its hold on the PC operating system market to unfairly compete with companies such as [[Netscape]].

In 1999, Microsoft released Windows 98&amp;nbsp;Second Edition, an interim release. One of the more notable new features was the addition of [[Internet Connection Sharing]], which was a form of [[network address translation]], allowing several machines on a LAN (Local Area Network) to share a single [[Internet connection]]. Second Edition was also much easier to use and much smoother than the first edition of Windows 98. Hardware support through device drivers was increased. Many minor problems present in the original Windows 98 were found and fixed which make it, according to many, the most stable release of [[Windows 9x]] familyâto the extent that commentators used to say that Windows 98's [[beta version]] was more stable than Windows 95's final (gamma) version.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aroundcny.com/Technofile/texts/tec032998.html Windows 98: Stable and fast, as well as 'new and improved']&lt;/ref&gt;
{{-}}

==Windows 2000==
{{Main|Windows 2000}}

Microsoft released Windows 2000 in February 2000. It has the version number Windows NT 5.0. It was successfully deployed both on the server and the workstation markets. Amongst Windows 2000's most significant new features was [[Active Directory]], a near-complete replacement of the NT 4.0 [[Windows Server domain]] model, which built on industry-standard technologies like [[Domain Name System|DNS]], [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], and [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]] to connect machines to one another. [[Terminal Services]], previously only available as a separate edition of NT 4, was expanded to all server versions. A number of features from Windows 98 were incorporated also, such as an improved Device Manager, [[Windows Media Player]], and a revised [[DirectX]] that made it possible for the first time for many modern games to work on the NT kernel. Windows 2000 is also the last NT-kernel Windows operating system to lack [[Microsoft Product Activation|product activation]].

While Windows 2000 upgrades were available for Windows 95 and Windows 98, it was not intended for home users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/2000_old.asp|title=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows: Windows 2000 FAQ|first=Paul|last=Thurrott|publisher=SuperSite for Windows|accessdate=12 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Windows 2000 was available in six editions:
* Windows 2000 Professional
* Windows 2000 Server
* Windows 2000 Advanced Server
* Windows 2000 Datacenter Server
* Windows 2000 Advanced Server Limited Edition
* Windows 2000 Datacenter Server Limited Edition

==Windows Millennium Edition (Me)==
{{Main|Windows Me}}

In September 2000, Microsoft introduced Windows Me (Millennium Edition), which upgraded Windows 98 with enhanced multimedia and Internet features from Windows 2000. It also introduced the first version of ''System Restore'', which allowed users to revert their system state to a prior &quot;known-good&quot; point in the case of system failure. System Restore was a notable feature that made its way into Windows XP. The first version of [[Windows Movie Maker]] was introduced also.

Windows Me was conceived as a quick one-year project that served as a stopgap release between Windows 98 and Windows XP. Many of the new features were available from the [[Windows Update|Windows Update site]] as updates for older Windows versions, (''System Restore'' and ''Windows Movie Maker'' were exceptions). Windows Me was criticised for stability issues, and for lacking [[real mode]] DOS support, to the point of being referred to as the &quot;Mistake Edition&quot;&lt;ref name=WorstTechProducts25&gt;{{cite news| title=The 25 Worst Tech Products of All Time (Page 2)|author=Dan Tynan|url= http://www.pcworld.com/article/125772-2/the_25_worst_tech_products_of_all_time.html| publisher=PCWorld|date=26 May 2006 |accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;Many Errors.&quot; Windows Me was the last operating system to be based on the Windows 9x ([[monolithic kernel|monolithic]]) kernel and [[MS-DOS]].

==Windows XP==
{{Main|Windows XP|Features new to Windows XP}}

In 2001, Microsoft released Windows XP (code named &quot;[[List of Microsoft codenames|Whistler]]&quot;). The merging of the Windows NT/2000 and Windows 95/98/Me lines was finally achieved with Windows XP. Windows XP uses the Windows NT 5.1 [[kernel (computers)|kernel]], marking the entrance of the Windows NT core to the consumer market, to replace the aging 16/32-bit branch. The initial release met with considerable [[Criticism of Windows XP|criticism]], particularly in the area of [[Information Security|security]], leading to the release of three major [[Service Pack]]s. Windows XP SP1 was released in September 2002, SP2 came out in August 2004 and SP3 came out in April 2008. Service Pack 2 provided significant improvements and encouraged widespread adoption of XP among both home and business users. Windows XP lasted longer as Microsoft's flagship operating system than any other version of Windows, from October 25, 2001 to January 30, 2007 when it was succeeded by Windows Vista.

Windows XP is available in a number of versions:
* [[Windows XP Home Edition]], for home desktops and [[laptop]]s - lacked features such as joining [[Active Directory]] Domain, [[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]] Server and [[Internet Information Services]] Server.
** Windows XP Home Edition N, as above, but without a default installation of [[Windows Media Player]], as mandated by a [[European Union]] ruling
* [[Windows XP Professional]], for business and power users contained all features in Home Edition.
** Windows XP Professional N, as above, but without a default installation of Windows Media Player, as mandated by a European Union ruling
* [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] (MCE), released in October 2002 for desktops and notebooks with an emphasis on home entertainment. Contained all features offered in Windows XP Professional and the Windows Media Center. Subsequent versions are the same but have an updated Windows Media Center.
** Windows XP Media Center Edition 2003
** Windows XP Media Center Edition 2004
** Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005, released on 12 October 2004. Included Windows XP Service Pack 2, the Royale Windows Theme and joining a Windows Active Directory Domain is disabled.
* [[Windows XP Tablet PC Edition]], for [[Microsoft Tablet PC|tablet PCs]]
** Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005

Vista also features new graphics features, the [[Windows Aero]] [[GUI]], new applications (such as [[Windows Calendar]], Windows DVD Maker and some new games including [[Chess]], [[Mahjong]], and [[Purble Place]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windows-vista/features/games-explorer.aspx?tabid=2&amp;catid=1|title=Explore the features: Games Explorer}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Internet Explorer 7]], [[Windows Media Player 11]], and a large number of underlying architectural changes.
