'''BeatrIX''' was a [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] [[operating system]], in development up to 2005. A [[live CD]] based [[Linux distribution]] started by Steven Watsky in Prague, Czech Republic, it was designed to look very simple, in order to be as accessible as possible to new users. The reason for development was for schools, internet cafes, and others to have access to a computer that would not hold any information, or carry any viruses. A simple operating system that could fit on a Live USB. &lt;ref&gt;Aaron Watsky &quot;Son to Steven Watsky&quot; &lt;/Ref&gt; The BeatrIX desktop had just four icons (e-mail, instant messaging, word processing and web browser). The project was halted in 2005 when Steven Watsky had to fly back to the United States, because he became ill due to Diabetes.

BeatrIX was a small operating system, taking up only 200MB. The live CD fit into 80&amp;nbsp;mm discs (this form factor has also been called &quot;[[CD]]3&quot;, since it is about three inches across).

BeatrIX used Linux 2.6.7 and [[GNOME]] 2.28 as its [[GUI]] desktop. It came equipped with productivity tools such as [[OpenOffice.org]] 1.1.2, Mozilla [[Firefox]] (version 1.0) web browser, [[Gaim]] (version 1.0), etc.

== Successor projects: BeaFanatIX and Debris ==
Following BeatrIX's final release in 2005, a community release named BeaFanatIX (linking the project more closely to [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] repositories) continued up until September 2007&lt;ref&gt;http://bea.cabarel.com/index.php?module=News&amp;id=cntnt01&amp;cntnt01action=detail&amp;cntnt01articleid=14&amp;cntnt01returnid=15&lt;/ref&gt;, when the project was renamed Debris Linux. The most recent stable release of Debris, numbered  2.0, was released on 29 November 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Debris Linux homepage [http://debris.moonmind.net/], accessed 22 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
