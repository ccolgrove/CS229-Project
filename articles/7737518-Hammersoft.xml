She's more modern and not the classic villain. She also said that Jinx is fashionable. She's fashion-forward, very sexy and takes fashion risks, and I love her for that.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scene where she emerges from the ocean in a bikini paid homage to the character of [[Honey Ryder]] ([[Ursula Andress]]) from the first Bond film, ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]''. Despite the bikini and location of [[Cuba]] in the film, the footage of the water and bar scene was shot in [[Cadiz]] and far from the warmth implied in the film; The location was reportedly very cold and windy, and footage has been released of Berry wrapped in thick towels in between takes to avoid catching a chill.&lt;ref&gt;''Die Another Day'' Special Edition DVD 2002, Retrieved on March 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Speculation arose in 2003 of a spin-off film concentrating on the character which was scheduled for a [[November 2004|November]]/December 2004 release. It was originally reported that [[MGM]] was keen to set up a franchise and to be a &quot;[[winter olympics]]&quot; alternative to 'James Bond,'. As early as the late 1990s, MGM had originally considered developing a spin-off film based on [[Michelle Yeoh]]'s character, [[Wai Lin]], in 1997's ''[[Tomorrow Never Dies]]''. However, despite much speculation of an imminent movie, on October 26, 2003 , ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' reported that MGM had completely pulled the plug on this project, to the dismay of [[Barbara Broccoli]] and [[Michael G. Wilson|Michael Wilson]] of [[Eon Entertainment]], who were reported to be &quot;clearly furious&quot; about the decision &lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808475849 Movies.yahoo.com], Retrieved on March 28, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;. MGM were keen to move on with the next film instead. Jinx was also the first [[Black people|black]] [[Bond Girl]], hero or villain, in more than 17 years, since [[List of James Bond henchmen in A View to a Kill#May Day|May Day]] ([[Grace Jones]]) in ''[[A View to a Kill]]'', and the first black Bond Girl ever to play the heroine (principal Bond &quot;good girl&quot;).

On Graves' giant plane, while he and his officers are having a conversation with Graves, Graves tries to convince the him that the General himself is his father by saying the General's personal memorized tactics. Now the General learns that Graves is actually the new identity of his still living son, Colonel Moon, hiding behind a new face thanks to [[gene therapy]]. Graves hoped his demonstration of power to break the [[Korean Demilitarized Zone]] in order to invade [[South Korea]] would impress his father, but instead Moon realizes that his son is insane and Bond was right about him all along and threatens to kill him with one of the officers' [[Makarov PM|Makarov]], saying that the plan will instead destroy themselves and his real son died long ago. Graves disarms his father and, stating his disappointment in him, shoots him in the chest, killing him as other officers seeing their comrade getting murdered by his own son. Graves then coldly removed his Medal of Honor, provoking Bond, who's enraged at seeing the death of the general who spared his life back in North Korea, to try and kill Graves on the spot.
