The Victorian '''Head of the River''' regatta is contested between the eleven [[Associated Public Schools of Victoria|Associated Public Schools of Victoria (APS)]].

The race is usually the last race of the official APS rowing season and has recently been rowed on [[Lake Nagambie]] which is a full buoyed international standard course allowing six boat finals. 

==History==
In 1868, John C. Field, on behalf of Mr Morrison's pupils at Scotch College, challenged Dr Bromby's pupils at Melbourne Grammar School to a &quot;friendly four oar gig race to be rowed from the Botanical Bridge to Edward's Boathouse (Princes Bridge)&quot;.&lt;ref name=BoysAPS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/school-rowing/vic/aps-head-of-river/boys-summary.php|title= APS Head of the River - Boys Summary|accessdate= 2008-04-11|last= Guerin |first= Andrew |year= 2004 |work= APS Head of the River |publisher= Guerin-Foster History of Australian Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 June 1868 Scotch won the race and since then the &quot;Head of the River&quot; race, as it is now known, has been contested every year. 

The first cup for competition was presented in 1875 by the Hon. TJ Sumner, to become the property of the school which should first win it three times. Scotch College won it in 1875, 1876 and 1879 and have retained it since that date.

In 1911 Mr C Fairbairn presented the Challenge Cup and the winners of this handsome trophy and previous &quot;Winners of the Race&quot;, as it was known then, are listed in this programme.

===Location===
The first Head of the River was rowed on the [[Yarra River|Yarra]] in 1868. The race was first rowed on the [[Barwon River (Victoria)|Barwon]] in 1879 and then every fifth or sixth year until 1916. Between 1921â1943 the Barwon saw it every fourth year, and since 1948 the only use of the Yarra was in 1957 when Geelong College won. 

During the [[Second World War]], the Geelong Schools rowed a heat on the Barwon and the four Melbourne Schools rowed heats on the Yarra. These races were held after school, the winners met on the Yarra to decide the title except in 1943 when restrictions on travel were in force. 

===Participants===
Scotch College has been represented every year, gradually other schools have joined in, the most recent being [[Haileybury College, Melbourne|Haileybury College]] who entered the Boys First Eight event for the first time in 1991.

===Boats===
From 1868 to 1897 racing was in fixed seat, four oared gigs, from 1889 to 1900 in sliding seat single streak outrigger fours and from 1901 to 1918 in sliding seat clinker built eights. Shells have been used since.

===Difficulties===
The Head of the River races have weathered such difficulties as flooded rivers, disputes over ages, dead heats, disqualifications, and even the inability of a school to round up enough rowers to crew a boat.

Before World War 2, only the first crew of each school took part in the Head of the River Regatta, but there was a race for second crews and sometimes third crews raced on the Saturday prior to the Head of the River race.

In the early part of the century the race was held in 1 October, but later it was moved to 24 May and after World War 2 to 29 April. When the race was in October it was possible for a boy to represent his school in Football, Cricket, Rowing and Athletics in the one year, as the latter were held in May after the Cricket season had ended.

==Head of the Schoolgirls' Regatta==
{{main|Head of the Schoolgirls (Victoria)}}

The first girl to row within the A.P.S. was a lone sculler from [[Geelong Grammar School]] in 1972. There were 32 girls rowing by 1975, and in 1981, girls began competing at the Senior Regatta with Geelong Grammar School, [[The Geelong College]], [[Melbourne Girls Grammar School]], Morongo Girls' School and [[Lauriston Girls School]] racing in 1st and 2nd Fours over 800m. [[Methodist Ladies' College, Melbourne|Methodist Ladies' College]] and [[Carey Baptist Grammar School]] joined in 1982, with Carey boating a First Four in 1983.&lt;ref name=Introofgirls&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/school-rowing/vic/aps-head-of-river/index.php|title= The Introduction of the Girls Events|accessdate= 2008-03-31|last= Guerin |first= Andrew |year= 2004 |work= APS Head of the River |publisher= Guerin-Foster History of Australian Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1984 was the final year school girls participated in the APS Head of the River, with seven girls' crews rowing in the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Four events. The following year saw the regatta revert to an all APS event, with only Geelong Grammar and Geelong College boating a First Four. Carey reappeared in the First Fours in 1986, the same year that [[Wesley College, Melbourne|Wesley College]] joined, and with Caulfield joining in 1987, all five [[co-educational]] schools were boating a first four over 1500m.&lt;ref name=Introofgirls/&gt; Around this time, the [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of the now defunct Morongo Girls' School initiated a meeting that established the [[Head of the Schoolgirls (Victoria)|Head of School Girls' Regatta]] (HOSG).

In 2007, the girls' field increased from five to six schools, with Hailebury embracing [[Parallel education]] and boating a girls' VIII.&lt;ref name=GirlsAPS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.rowinghistory-aus.info/school-rowing/vic/aps-head-of-river/girls-summary.php|title= APS Head of the River - Girls Summary|accessdate= 2008-04-11|last= Guerin |first= Andrew |year= 2004 |work= APS Head of the River |publisher= Guerin-Foster History of Australian Rowing}}&lt;/ref&gt;
