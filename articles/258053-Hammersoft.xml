==History==
The land in Barrington was originally granted by the King of England to members of the ''Mayflower'' party.  Some parts of the town retain names from this land grant, including Prince's Hill, named for Thomas Prince.

Barrington was part of [[Swansea, Massachusetts]] from its incorporation in 1667 (part of the [[Plymouth Colony]] until the merger with Massachusetts in 1691).&lt;ref name=&quot;town history&quot;&gt;[http://www.ci.barrington.ri.us/town/history.html Official town history]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baptist residents petitioned for separation from Swansea in 1711, and Barrington was incorporated as an independent town in 1717.  It was named after [[Barrington, Somerset]], where many of the English settlers came from.

In 1747, Barrington was [[History of Massachusetts#Rhode Island eastern border|ceded to Rhode Island]] but made a part of [[Warren, Rhode Island]].  In 1770, its independence was restored by the Rhode Island legislature.&lt;ref name=&quot;town history&quot; /&gt;
