'''Dudley &quot;Dud&quot; Shaw Richards''' (February 4, 1932 - February 15, 1961) was an [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]] who competed in men's singles and pairs.  In singles, he won the bronze medal at the 1953 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] and finished sixth at that year's [[World Figure Skating Championships]]. In pairs, he once skated with future Olympic gold medalist [[Tenley Albright]], before later teaming up with [[Maribel Owen]]. After winning the bronze medal at Nationals in 1958 and 1959, the pair captured the silver in 1960 and finished tenth at that year's [[1960 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympic Games]]. In 1961, Owen and Richards won the gold medal at the U.S. Championships and finished second at the [[North American Figure Skating Championships]].

Away from the ice, Richards was a graduate of [[Harvard University]] and had spent time in the Army. He was also a real estate executive and a longtime friend (and college roommate) of future Senator [[Ted Kennedy]].

Richards was en route to the World Championships in 1961 when his plane, [[Sabena Flight 548]], crashed near [[Brussels, Belgium]], killing all on board. He was 29 at the time of his death.
