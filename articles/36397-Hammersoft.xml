The decade began amidst a [[Financial crisis (2007âpresent)|global financial crisis]] that started in the late 2000s, after approximately three decades of prosperity, economic growth as well as income inequality, and increased globalization.&lt;ref&gt;Rana Foroohar [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2088040,00.html], ''The End of Europe'', Time Magazine, 11 August 2011. Accessed 2011-08-26.&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the ongoing Eurozone debt crisis, which stemmed from these economic problems, first became pronounced in May 2010 and continues to threaten the possibility of a global recovery. Other economic issues such as inflation, and an increase in [[commodity]] prices, sparked immense unrest in many lower-income countries. In some countries this unrest evolved into [[socioeconomics|socio-economic]] crises which set off numerous revolutions, such as in [[Kyrgyz Revolution of 2010|Kyrgyzstan]] in 2010, and [[Tunisian revolution|Tunisia]], [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Egypt]], and [[2011 Libyan civil war|Libya]] in 2011. This trend continues at present, and is known as the [[Arab Spring]]. The [[revolutions of 2011]] also include the [[2011 Spanish protests|Spanish &quot;Indignants&quot;]], inspired by the Arab Spring, and the [[Occupy movement]] protests in North America and Europe, influenced by both Spanish demonstrations and the Arab Spring.

==Politics and wars==
===Wars===
{{Main|List of wars 2003â2010|List of wars 2011âpresent}}
The prominent wars of the decade so far include:

==== International wars ====
* [[War on Terrorism]] (2001âpresent) â refers to several [[Ideology|ideological]], military, and diplomatic campaigns ostensibly aimed at putting an end to [[international terrorism]] by preventing groups defined by the US and its allies as [[terrorist groups|&quot;terrorist&quot;]] (largely [[Islamism|Islamist]] groups such as [[al-Qaeda]], [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]]) from posing a threat to the US and its allies, and by putting an end to [[state-sponsored terrorism|state sponsorship of terrorism]]. The campaigns were launched by the United States, with support from [[NATO]] and other allies, immediately following the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] which were carried out by [[al-Qaeda]]. Today the term has become mostly associated with US/UK-led wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].
:*[[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)]] â In 2001, the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia and Canada invaded [[Afghanistan]] seeking to oust the [[Taliban]] and find [[Al-Qaeda]] mastermind [[Osama bin Laden]].
:* [[Iraq War]] (2003â2011) â On 19 August 2010, the last American combat brigade was moved out of Iraq after more than 7 years of warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/wireStory?id=11432471|title=Goodbye Iraq: Last US Combat Brigade Heads Home|author=Rebecca Santana|publisher=ABC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though about 50,000 troops remained there throughout 2011, being designated as &quot;advise and assist brigades&quot; assigned to non-combat operations while retaining the ability to revert to combat operations as necessary. They are expected to completely leave Iraq by the end of 2011.

* [[ArabâIsraeli conflict]] (Early 20th centuryâpresent)
:*[[IsraeliâPalestinian conflict]] (Early 20th centuryâpresent) â an ongoing armed conflict in [[Israel]] and the [[Palestinian territories]]. The conflict is centered between [[the state of Israel]] and the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]. One side is composed mainly of [[Israeli Defence Forces|Israel's military forces]] and the other side is composed mostly of [[Palestinian political violence|Palestinian militant or paramilitary forces]] such as [[Hamas]], the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine|Islamic Jihad Movement]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and the [[Popular Resistance Committees]] (which have all been designated by the United States&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/s/ct/rls/fs/37191.htm &quot;Foreign Terrorist Organizations (FTOs)&quot;] â U.S. Department of State&lt;/ref&gt; and [[European Union]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:32004E0500:EN:HTML &quot;Council Common Position 2004/500/CFSP of 17 May 2004&quot;] â EU list of &quot;persons, groups and entities involved in terrorist acts&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Israel and many other [[western countries]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Japan's Diplomatic Bluebook 2005&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/2005/ch3-a.pdf|format=PDF| title=Japan's Diplomatic Bluebook 2005|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3100518.stm |title=EU blacklists Hamas political wing |publisher=BBC News  |date=2003-09-11 |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; as [[terrorist organisation]]s). The conflict has escalated since the [[Second Intifada]] (September 2000) broke out, a period of intensified Palestinian-Israeli violence which has been taking place until the present day. The Second Intifada has caused thousands of victims on both sides, both among [[combatants]] and among civilians.

* [[2011 Libyan Civil War]] (15 February â 23 October 2011) â a series of demonstrations and riots held against [[Muammar Gaddafi]]'s [[History of Libya under Gaddafi|42-year rule]]. The widespread demonstrations, which erupted in response to the high unemployment rate in Libya and the lack of development in the country, rapidly escalated into a civil war as Gaddafi used his military force against the Libyan rebels. As a result, fifty thousand Libyans have died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-14715518 |work=BBC News  | title=Libya interim leaders give ultimatum to Gaddafi forces | date=30 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising came to an end when Gaddafi was killed during the liberation of Sirte on 20 October 2011.

* [[Mexican Drug War]] (2006âpresent) â an armed conflict fought between rival [[drug cartels]] and [[Military of Mexico|government force]]s in Mexico. Although Mexican drug cartels, or drug trafficking organizations, have existed for quite some time, they have become more powerful since the demise of Colombia's [[Cali Cartel|Cali]] and [[MedellÃ­n cartel|MedellÃ­n]] cartels in the 1990s. Mexican drug cartels now dominate the wholesale [[War on Drugs|illicit drug market]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=Cook7 &gt;{{Citation| contribution=Mexico's Drug Cartels| title=CRS Report for Congress| editor-first=Colleen W.| editor-last=Cook| coeditors=| publisher=Congressional Research Service| place=| page=7| date=16 October| year=2007| id= | contribution-url=http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/row/RL34215.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=2009-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Arrests of key cartel leaders, particularly in the Tijuana and Gulf cartels, have led to increasing drug violence as cartels fight for control of the trafficking routes into the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=TRACI CARL | title=Progress in Mexico drug war is drenched in blood | date=10 March 2009 | agency=Associated Press | url =http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5ilIZ5du3hOOeN7yatYIRIhFY-MJAD96RBGO00 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink= | title=High U.S. cocaine cost shows drug war working: Mexico | date=14 September 2007 | publisher=Reuters | url =http://www.reuters.com/article/domesticNews/idUSN1422771920070914 | accessdate = 2009-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| contribution=CRS Report for Congress| title=Mexico â U.S. Relations: Issues for Congress| editor-first=Mark P.| editor-last=Sullivan| coeditors=Junew S.

* [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (2004âpresent) â an armed conflict between the [[Pakistani Armed Forces]] and [[Islamic militants]] made up of local tribesmen, the [[Taliban]], and foreign [[Mujahideen]] (Holy Warriors). It began in 2004 when tensions rooted in the Pakistani Army's search for [[al-Qaeda]] members in [[Pakistan]]'s mountainous [[Waziristan]] area (in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas, Pakistan|Federally Administered Tribal Areas]]) escalated into armed resistance by local tribesmen. The violence has displaced 3.44 million civilians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/05/31/pakistan.red.cross/index.html |title=Red Cross 'gravely concerned' about conditions in Swat Valley |publisher=CNN  |date= 2009-05-31|accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to more than 7,000 civilians being killed.&lt;ref name=&quot;satp.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satp.org/satporgtp/countries/pakistan/index.htm |title=SATP.org |publisher=SATP.org |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Sa'dah insurgency]] (2004â2010) â a civil war in the [[Sa'dah Governorate]] of [[Yemen]]. It began after the [[Shia Islam|ShÄ«âa]] [[Zaidiyyah]] sect launched an uprising against the Yemeni government. The Yemeni government has accused [[Iran]] of directing and financing the insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jamestown.org/terrorism/news/uploads/tf_004_002.pdf Yemen Accuses Iran of Meddling in its Internal Affairs]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of rebels and civilians have been killed during the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ploughshares.ca/libraries/ACRText/ACR-Yemen.htm#Status |title=Armed Conflicts Report â Yemen |publisher=Ploughshares.ca |accessdate=2010-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/World/Yemeni-military-battles-Shiite-rebels/2007/03/20/1174153010354.html |title=Yemeni military battles Shi'ite rebels |work=The Age |location=Australia |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-06-21 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[War in Somalia (2009â)|War in Somalia (2009âpresent)]] â involved largely the forces of the Somali [[Somalia|Somali]] [[Transitional Federal Parliament|Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) assisted by [[African Union]] peacekeeping troops, whom fought against various militant Islamist factions for control of the country. The violence has displaced thousands of people residing in [[Mogadishu]], the nation's capital. 1,739 people in total were killed between 1 January 2009 until 1 January 2010.&lt;ref name=casualties&gt;[[allafrica]] [http://allafrica.com/stories/201001010001.html More Than 1,700 Killed in Clashes in 2009], 1 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Conflict in the Niger Delta]] (2004âpresent) â an ongoing conflict in the [[Niger Delta]] region of [[Nigeria]]. The conflict was caused due to the tensions between the [[multinational corporation|foreign]] [[oil industry|oil corporations]] and a number of the [[Niger Delta]]'s minority ethnic groups who felt they were being exploited, particularly the [[Ogoni people|Ogoni]] and the [[Ijaw people|Ijaw]]. The competition for oil wealth has led to an endless violence cycle between innumerable [[ethnic groups]], causing the [[militarization]] of nearly the entire region which was occupied by militia  groups as well as [[Military of Nigeria|Nigerian military]] and the forces of the Nigerian Police.

* [[Civil war in Chad (2005âpresent)]] involved [[Chad]]ian government forces and several Chadian rebel groups. The government of Chad estimated in January 2006 that 614 Chadian citizens had been killed in cross-border raids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Al Jazeera|title=Chad wants Sudan to disarm rebels|date=2006-01-12|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/English/archive/archive?ArchiveId=17880}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fighting still continues despite several attempts to reach agreements.

* [[Insurgency in the Maghreb (2002âpresent)]] â [[Algeria]] has been the subject of an Islamic insurgency since 2002 waged by the Sunni Islamic [[Jihad]]ist militant group [[Salafist Group for Preaching and Combat]] (GSPC). GSPC allied itself with the [[Al-Qaeda Organization in the Islamic Maghreb]] against the [[Algeria|Algerian government]]. The conflict has since spread to other neighboring countries.

* [[Colombian Armed Conflict]] (1964âpresent) has changed substantially after the government of [[Alvaro Uribe]]. President [[Juan Manuel Santos]] took office in 2010 and seeks to continue Uribe's policy about terrorism. The [[FARC]] and [[ELN]] guerrillas are weaker than ever and divided, with the latter calling for peace talks with the government. Meanwhile, paramilitary forces have demobilized, but irregular drug-trafficking forces called &quot;Bacrim&quot; have gained control over much of the areas that the [[United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia|AUC]] paramilitaries previously held. The &quot;Bacrim&quot; gangs have allied with guerrillas in some regions of the country like [[ChocÃ³]] and [[Antioquia]].

=== Coups ===

===Nuclear weapons controversies===
* Since 2005, [[Nuclear program of Iran|Iran's nuclear program]] has become the subject of contention with the Western world due to suspicions that Iran could divert the civilian nuclear technology to a weapons program. This has led the [[UN Security Council]] to impose [[sanctions against Iran]] on select companies linked to this program, thus furthering its economic isolation on the international scene. The [[U.S. Director of National Intelligence]] said in February 2009 that Iran would not realistically be able to a get a nuclear weapon until 2013, if it chose to develop one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN25158068 |title=RPT-EXCLUSIVE-Iran would need 18 months for atom bomb-diplomats |publisher=Reuters |date= 2009-10-26|accessdate=2010-06-21 | first=Louis | last=Charbonneau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The United States and Russia sign a treaty to cut nuclear weapons in either nation in Prague in April 2010, a week later U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] hosts a [[2010 Nuclear Security Summit|Nuclear Security Summit]] where the attending nations decides to lock onto their nuclear arms, to make sure no terrorists get hands on these weapons of mass destruction, also South Korea was selected to hold the second [[2012 Nuclear Security Summit|Nuclear Security Summit]] in 2012.

'''WikiLeaks'''
* The international new-media non-profit organization [[WikiLeaks]] published three massive sets of documents pertaining to the [[Iraq War]], the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|Afghanistan War]], and [[United States diplomatic cables leak|US diplomacy]], which, respectively, were released in April, July, and November 2010. Each of these releases was accompanied by heavy and extensive weeks-long coverage in news media all over the world, and had a strong impact on the global political landscape, with strong reactions from leaders within many major countries.

'''Americas'''
[[File:Obama and Medvedev sign Prague Treaty 2010.jpeg|thumb|Obama signing the [[New START]] treaty in Prague.]]
* January 2010 â A trial determining the [[constitutionality]] of [[same-sex marriage in the United States]] is held in California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20100127/ap_on_re_us/us_gay_marriage_trial_15 California gay marriage trial moves to a close]{{Dead link|date=June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Obama administration]]'s efforts to implement [[health care reform in the United States]] lead eventually to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] voting in favor of enacting the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] in March 2010.  Republicans are currently making efforts to repeal the bill, debating its [[constitutionality]].
* The late 2000s and early 2010s has seen the rise of the [[Tea Party movement]], with figureheads like [[Glenn Beck]] and [[Sarah Palin]], which has acquired a large following in the United States. The movement has become a dominant factor in the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and has provided a strong political polarization, promoting activism and [[Tea Party protests|protests]] with the goal to reduce federal spending, bailouts, taxes, and regulation.
* The [[New START]], a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the [[Russian Federation]] entered into force.

'''Europe'''

* The [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom election]] resulted in the first &quot;[[hung parliament]]&quot; since [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|1974]]. [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]], under Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] lost its overall majority in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]]. The [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] led by [[David Cameron]] became the largest party. For five days, both major parties held negotiations with the [[Nick Clegg]]'s [[Liberal Democrats]], resulting in the first peace-time [[coalition government]] since the [[Fourth National Ministry|1930s]]. leading to talks for over a week between the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] and the [[Liberal Democrats]]. Cameron became Prime Minister upon Brown's resignation on 11 May. Clegg also became [[Deputy Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Deputy Prime Minister]].

* A [[2010 eruption of EyjafjallajÃ¶kull|series of major volcanic events occur at EyjafjallajÃ¶kull in Iceland]] in April 2010.

This caused a knock-on effect to many events around the world. Scientists began recording volcanic activity there in 2009 which increased through March 2010 culminating in the second phase eruption in April 2010. It is considered the largest air traffic shut-down since World War II.&lt;ref name=SMH2&gt;{{Cite news | title= Qantas cancels flights for a third day |work=The Sydney Morning Herald| date= 18 April 2010 | url= http://www.smh.com.au/travel/travel-news/qantas-cancels-flights-for-a-third-day-20100418-slv5.html| accessdate= 18 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Air Transport Association]] (IATA) estimated that the airline industry worldwide would lose {{â¬|148 million}} or {{GBP|130 million}} a day during the disruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Wearden, Graeme |title= Ash cloud costing airlines Â£130m a day |url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2010/apr/16/iceland-volcano-airline-industry-iata |work=The Guardian |location=London |date= 16 April 2010 |accessdate= 17 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|2010s in music}}

The early 2010s have musically been dominated by a variety of styles and artists. Globalization and the internet have erased political borders providing musicians to have their material to be heard all over the globe. The shrinking of the music industry due to the internet has also [[localized]] music, as there are fewer artists who become big enough to be internationally famous. Musical paradigm shifts in the [[2000s in music|previous decade]] regarding how people obtain and listen to music including the rise of the [[MP3|MP3 format]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Grandoni |first=Dino |url=http://news.yahoo.com/ipod-die-210520713.html |title=The iPod Is About to Die â Yahoo!

In terms of [[popular music]], the heavy use of [[Auto-Tune]] has dramatically changed the landscape of the Top-40 charts.  At the same time, [[electronic dance music]] and [[electropop]] have gained significant popularity; electronic in general became widespread in the early-2010s mixing elements of [[Chiptune]], [[Second Wave synthpop]] mixed with rap and other various [[electronic music]], into a sound that differentiates 2010s music from the popular music styles of the early 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Name * |url=http://www.digitalphotocity.com/2281/producing-electronic-music-in-2010-is-the-digital-revolution |title=Producing Electronic Music In 2010 Is The Digital Revolution |publisher=Digitalphotocity.com |date=17 December 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfdubreport.com/2010/12/09/why-electronic-music-rules/ |title=Blog Archive Â» Why Electronic Music Rules |publisher=dfDubReport |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United Kingdom, [[Dubstep]] is rising in popularity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.starobserver.com.au/play/reviews-play/2010/12/16/dubstep-invasion-kid-kenobi-glovecats/40226 |title=Dubstep Invasion â Kid Kenobi &amp; Glovecats &amp;#124; Star Online |publisher=Starobserver.com.au |accessdate=10 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a style that mirrors the electronic-leaning musical trends elsewhere.

===Fashion===

At the same time new fashions such as color burn shirts and &quot;boot sandal hybrids&quot; emerged in Europe and the USA. Plaid and arguile shirts are also popular, especially in vivid colors.   

In Britain there has been a resurgence of [[Edwardian]] fashions among indie kids, [[sloane ranger]]s, and college students, including suits with contrasting piping, boots based on [[US Civil War]] era [[Jeff Davis boots]], [[J.
