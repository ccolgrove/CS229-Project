The international Kingfisher First has full flat-bed seats with a 180 degree recline, with a seat pitch of 78&amp;nbsp;inches, and a seat width of 20-24.54&amp;nbsp;inches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Skytrax News |url=http://www.airlinequality.com/news/140708_KINGFISHER.htm |title=Kingfisher Airlines unveil new Airbus A330-200 designed to take the customer experience to the highest quality level |publisher=Airlinequality.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers are given [[Merino]] wool blankets, a Salvatore Ferragamo toiletry kit, a pyjama to change into, five-course meals and alcoholic beverages. Also available are in-seat massagers, chargers and USB connectors.

Every Kingfisher First seat has a 17&amp;nbsp;inch widescreen [[personal television]] with [[AVOD]] touchscreen controls and offers 357 hours of programming content spread over 36 channels, including [[Hollywood]] and [[Bollywood]] movies along with 16 channels of live TV, so passengers can watch their favorite TV programmes live. There is also a collection of interactive games, a jukebox with customisable playlists and Kingfisher Radio. Passengers are given [[BOSE]] noise cancellation headphones.

The service on board the Kingfisher First cabins includes a social area comprising a full-fledged bar staffed with a bartender, a break-out seating area just nearby fitted with two couches and bar stools, a full-fledged chef on board the aircraft and any-time dining. A turn-down service includes the conversion of the seat into a fully flat bed and an air-hostess making the bed when the passenger is ready to sleep.

Both Kingfisher First and Kingfisher classes feature [[mood lighting]] on the [[Airbus A330#A330-200|Airbus A330-200]] with light schemes corresponding to the time of day and flight position.

=====Kingfisher Class=====
The international Kingfisher Class seats offer a seat pitch of 34&amp;nbsp;inches, a seat width of 18&amp;nbsp;inches and a seat recline of 25 degrees (6&amp;nbsp;inches). Passengers get full length [[modacrylic]] blankets, full size pillows and meals.

Each Kingfisher Class seat has a 10.6&amp;nbsp;inch widescreen personal television with [[AVOD]] touchscreen controls. The IFE is similar to that of the international Kingfisher First class. It can also be controlled by a detachable remote-control console fitted in the armrest. This device can be used to control the IFE, reading-lights, play games and even has a credit-card swipe for shopping on Kingfisher's 'Air Boutique'. It also has a facility for sending text-messages, though the service isn't provided by Kingfisher.

===In-flight entertainment===
Kingfisher's IFE system is the Thales TopSeries i3000/i4000 on-board the Airbus A320 family aircraft, and Thales TopSeries i5000 on-board the Airbus A330 family aircraft provided by the [[France]]-based [[Thales Group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ravi Teja Sharma / New Delhi&amp;nbsp;October 05, 2006 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/airborne-again/260624/ |title=Airborne again: IFE systems |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=2006-10-05 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kingfisher was the first Indian airline to have [[in-flight entertainment]] (IFE) systems on every seat even on domestic flights. All passengers were given a &quot;welcome kit&quot; consisting of goodies such as a pen, facial tissue and headphones to use with the IFE system. Now, passengers of kingfisher class are not given &quot;welcome kits&quot; but as mentioned earlier, a complimentary bottle of lemonade and earphones for use with the IFE are still given. Initially, passengers were able to watch only recorded TV programming on the IFE system, but later an alliance was formed with [[Dish TV]] to provide live TV in-flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techtree.com/India/News/Kingfisher_Partners_with_Dish_TV/551-77748-547.html |title=Kingfisher partners with Dish TV |publisher=Techtree.com |date=2006-12-09 |accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; And in a marked departure from tradition, Kingfisher Airlines decided to have an on-screen [[safety video|safety demonstration]] using the IFE system, however the conventional safety briefing by the [[flight attendants]] still exists on many flights.
