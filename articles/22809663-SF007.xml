They are usually the base of a [[package management system]], with ports handling package creation and additional tools managing package removal, upgrade, and other tasks.  In addition to the BSDs, a few [[Linux distribution]]s have implemented similar [[infrastructure]], including [[Gentoo_Linux|Gentoo]]'s [[Portage (software)|Portage]], [[Arch Linux|Arch]]'s [[Arch Build System|Arch Build System (ABS)]] and [[CRUX]]'s Ports.

== NetBSD's pkgsrc ==
{{main|Pkgsrc}}

NetBSD's ''pkgsrc'' ports collection is distinctive in that it aims to be portable and is usable on a number of operating systems aside from NetBSD itself, including the other BSDs, [[Linux]] and other [[Unix-like]]s.  ''pkgsrc'' was created in August 1997 based on the existing FreeBSD ports system. It follows a quarterly release schedule and as of July 2006 contains over 6000 packages. With their 1.4 release, [[DragonFly BSD]] announced that they would be adopting ''pkgsrc'' as their official package management system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Matthew|last=Dillon|title=PKGSRC will be officially supported as of the next release|url=http://leaf.dragonflybsd.org/mailarchive/users/2005-08/msg00347.html|accessdate=2008-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== OpenBSD ports ==
In contrast to [[FreeBSD Ports]], on which it was originally based, the OpenBSD ports system is intended as a source used to create the end product, [[Software package (installation)|packages]]: installing a port first creates a package and then installs it. Packages are made up of a makefile, [[text file]]s with descriptions and installation messages, any patches required to adjust the program to work on OpenBSD and a packing list listing the files to be included in the packages. The ports tree uses a set of standard makefiles, some of which are shared with the [[Source_code|source]] tree, to provide the bulk of its functionality; this shared infrastructure includes many utility functions for port developers and means that ports can often be made very simply. As a security precaution or an aid when developing new ports, port builds may be run using [[systrace]] and a default policy is provided. In late October 2007 OpenBSD developer Nikolay Sturm announced that -stable ports tree should be considered unmaintained due to the lack of resources. This effectively forces users to run -current ports/base tree in order to keep up with security updates. In 2009 it was decided to revive the -stable ports tree under supervision of Robert Nagy and Jasper Lievisse Adriaanse. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=William|last=Yodlowsky|title=4.6-stable ports|url=http://kerneltrap.org/mailarchive/openbsd-announce/2009/10/22/6515363|accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
