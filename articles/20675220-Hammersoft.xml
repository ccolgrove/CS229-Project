The '''2003 [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies]] football team''' represented [[Texas A&amp;M University]] in the [[college football]] [[2003 NCAA Division I-A football season|season of 2003.]]  The team's head football coach was [[Dennis Franchione]]. 2003 was the first year for Franchione who resigned from [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] in late [[2002]]. Franchione, known for his history of turning struggling football programs around, replaced [[R.C. Slocum]] who was fired after a mediocre 6-6 season in 2002.

Franchione brought the majority of his coaching staff with him to [[College Station, Texas|College Station]]. Strength and Conditioning Coach Ben Pollard declined an offer to go to College Station and elected to remain at Alabama. Franchione signed a contract that was set to pay him a yearly salary of [[USD|$]]1.7 million through 2010.&lt;ref name=BCSE&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theeagle.com/local/CoachFrantimelineatTexasA_M|title=Coach Fran timeline at Texas A&amp;M|publisher=''[[The Eagle (newspaper)|Bryan-College Station Eagle]]''|accessdate=2007-11-24|date=2007-11-24|author=Eagle Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aggies finished the 2003 season with a 4â8 record, including a nationally televised 77-0 loss to [[2003 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], the worst loss in A&amp;M's history. The season also marked the first losing season for the Aggies in 21 years.&lt;ref name=FranSA2&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/big12/stories/MYSA110807.FranchioneFails.en.31e6446.html|title=Big 12 Football: Where did Fran fail?|publisher=''San Antonio Express-News''|accessdate=2007-11-08|date=2007-11-08|author=Zwerneman, Brent |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080216033936/http://www.mysanantonio.com/sports/big12/stories/MYSA110807.FranchioneFails.en.31e6446.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
