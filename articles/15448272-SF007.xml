'''''World of Goo''''' is a [[physics]]-based [[puzzle video game|puzzle game]] by [[2D Boy]], an [[independent video game development|independent game developer]] consisting of Kyle Gabler and Ron Carmel, both former [[Electronic Arts]] employees,&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EuroGamer&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/article.php?article_id=90750 |title= World of Goo First Impressions |work=EuroGamer |publisher=Eurogamer Network |author=Gillen, Kieron |date=2008-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Linux]], [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], [[Android_(operating_system)|Android]] and [[WiiWare]].&lt;ref&gt;http://2dboy.com/forum/index.php?topic=1432.0&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for the [[Seumas McNally]] grand prize, Design Innovation Award, and Technical Excellence at the [[Independent Games Festival]],&lt;ref name=&quot;igf&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.igf.com/02finalists.html |title=2008 Independent Games Festival Winners |work=Independent Games Festival |publisher=Think Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has gone on to win several other gaming awards since its release.

==Gameplay==
===Overview===

[[Image:WorldOfGooBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|Placing a goo ball to construct a bridge.]]
The game is built around the idea of creating large structures using balls of [[wiktionary:goo|goo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;EGP&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.joystiq.com/2007/03/05/tower-of-goo-evolves-into-world-of-goo-2d-boy-is-born/ |title=Tower of Goo evolves into World of Goo, 2D Boy is born |work=Joystiq |publisher=Weblogs, Inc |date=2007-03-05 |author=Bardinelli, John}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game is divided into five chapters, each containing several levels. Each level has its own graphic and musical theme, giving it unique atmosphere. There is also a bonus meta-game called ''World of Goo Corporation'', where the objective is to build the highest tower using goo balls which the player collected through the course of the game. Players from all over the world can compete, as the height of the tower and number of goo balls used are being constantly uploaded to the 2D Boy server.

===Objective===

The main objective of the game is to get a requisite number of goo balls to a pipe representing the exit. In order to do so, the player must use the goo balls to construct bridges, towers, and other structures to overcome gravity and various terrain difficulties such as chasms, hills, spikes, or cliffs. There are several types of goo balls in the game, each of which has unique properties. The player must exploit combinations of these goo balls in order to complete each level. Extra goos recovered in the pipe are pumped through to the World of Goo Corporation, a sandbox area where the objective is to compete with other players worldwide by building the tallest tower possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;IGN&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pc.ign.com/articles/846/846912p1.html |title=World of Goo Preview |work=IGN PC |publisher=IGN Entertainment |date=2008-01-22 |author=Shea, Cam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can also try to achieve the &quot;Obsessive Completion Distinction Flag&quot; for each level by completing the level under more stringent criteria,&lt;ref name=&quot;2D Boy Blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2dboy.com/2008/08/14/leipzig-and-some-mini-goo-updates |first=Kyle |last=Gabler |title=Leipzig! And some mini-goo updates |work=2D Boy Blog |publisher=2D Boy |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2009-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as collecting a larger number of Goo balls, finishing under a set amount of time or using as few moves as possible.

Levels and chapters in the game are interspersed with [[cut scene]]s.

The WiiWare version includes multiplayer with up to four people on the same Wii. This facility is also available, albeit unsupported, in the Linux port.&lt;ref name=&quot;multimouse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goofans.com/faq/world-goo/technical-questions/how-do-i-use-more-one-mouse|title=How do I use more than one mouse?|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Levels===

''World of Goo'' is split up into five chapters, each containing a number of levels. The chapters are set over the course of one year in the ''World of Goo''. Each chapter takes place over one season, beginning in the start of summer, and ending at the end of spring the next year.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;The last winter level, Product Launcher, has &quot;happy new year&quot; as its tagline. This is similar to [[Northern Hemisphere]] seasons.&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th chapter is seasonless, and is set in a virtual world.

An additional 'chapter' selectable from the main menu is the World Of Goo Corporation. Goos collected above and beyond the required amount to pass a level are piped out of each of the played levels to here. Starting from just a single triangle of Goo, the aim is to build the highest possible tower. The Goos in the World of Goo Corporation are unique in that they can be repositioned like Ivy Goos but are black and can only form two connections at once like Common Goos.

In the World of Goo Corporation, towers built by other players of the game are represented by clouds bearing the player's name, nationality and height of the tower, including details on the total number of balls collected by the player and how many were used in constructing their tower. The altitude of each cloud represents the height of that player's tower. An online leaderboard charts the heights of the top 50 towers, as well as the top 10 players for each level of the game.

There are a total of 48 levels in the game, including World of Goo Corporation.

In an interview the developers stated that the retail version released in Europe would receive an additional sixth chapter, set on the Moon.&lt;ref name=&quot;WiiWare World&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wiiware-world.com/news/2008/08/2d_boy_interview_world_of_goo |title=2D Boy Interview - World Of Goo |work=WiiWare World |first=Darrent |last=Calvert}}&lt;/ref&gt; Few details were disclosed, but reportedly this chapter would have featured a freeform sandbox mode, similar to that of the World of Goo Corporation. This addition was, however, canceled for Wii when 2D Boy announced they were releasing the game on WiiWare in Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;2D Boy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2dboy.com/2008/11/11/world-of-goo-coming-to-wiiware-in-europe |title=world of goo coming to wiiware in europe! |work=2D Boy Blog |publisher=2D Boy |date=2008-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
{{Plot|date=May 2011}}
The story is told primarily through the aforementioned cut scenes and signs encountered throughout the game, which were left by an [[unseen character]] known as the Sign Painter.

Initially, pipes appear throughout the land, waking up many sleeping Goo Balls who have gone undisturbed until this, as they are filled with a childlike sense of curiosity and naivety they build themselves towards the pipes. Upon reaching the pipe entrance, the Goo Balls are sucked by the pipe system into the &quot;World of Goo Corporation&quot; main building where they are processed into many products, for example an [[energy drink]]. The excess Goo Balls are left outside the Corporation headquarters where they together begin to build a giant tower. At the end of the first chapter, some Goo Balls escape from a Corporation building by attaching themselves to eyeballs which have the ability to fly. The chapter ends with the Goo Balls &quot;seeing far away new lands&quot;.

In the second chapter, more pipes appear in an impossibly windy desert where World of Goo Corporation turns out to be searching for a new power source due to wind power not being sufficient anymore. However, the location and appearance of the power source was forgotten, because in the past, it stopped producing electricity.&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&quot;Lately, its output has been less than satisfactory.&quot; -- Fly Away Little Ones, Little Miss World of Goo, World of Goo&lt;/ref&gt; A new Goo Ball is introduced, which is ground up by the Corporation into a [[Cosmetics|facial cream]]. Near the end of the chapter, the power plant, which looks like a giant woman, is discovered. It is revealed that for many years, its tremendous &quot;beauty juice&quot; powered the world. Unfortunately, as the years went by, its energy started to die. Thanks to the Goo Balls' actions, however, it becomes operational again, causing the world to fill up with energy again. This energy, among other things, opens up a factory in the south.

During the third chapter it is said that the Corporation is developing a mysterious &quot;Product Z&quot;. It eventually turns out that the mysterious Product Z is actually the third dimension (Product Z is the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Z axis]] in [[mathematics]]). This causes much commotion amongst the general population who cannot see where anything is now. World of Goo Corporation tells them to contact tech support in the Information Superhighway after mankind, all animal and plant life becomes rendered &quot;incompatible with the world&quot;.

In the fourth chapter the Goo Balls set out to find the mysterious &quot;MOM&quot; program amongst a vector style environment. Shortly after the beginning the Goo Balls find the object responsible for rendering all the graphics. After pumping many of their own kind into the object, the graphics rendering improves, creating a more realistic environment (and the Pixel Goo Balls). Near the end they encounter the MOM program, during a somewhat disturbing conversation with, turns out to be a [[spam bot]]. The Goo Balls try to overload Product Z by sending every message in the history of spam to everyone at the World of Goo Corporation. After venturing to the Recycle Bin and un-deleting everything, World of Goo Corporation receives the mail and, unable to deal with so much spam and mail, explodes, shutting down Product Z while creating a massive layer of [[smog]], [[dust]], [[smoke]] and [[debris]] that envelops the entire world.

In the final chapter, it is revealed that all Goo Balls, except &quot;scientifically pure&quot; have been sucked away to the shattered pieces of the Corporation's Headquarters. The remaining Goo Balls decide to work their way up the island to reach a site where a [[telescope]] is located. The final level of the game reveals that the Goo Balls are now completely [[extinct]], all the remaining having been sucked away to the shattered remains of the World of Goo Corporation and added to the tower, and the gigantic telescope at the site has been rendered useless as it cannot see past the layer of smog. The Sign Painter reveals that in his final sign he has now become the Telescope Operator. Some balloon-like [[Puffer fish|fish]] in the sea connect to the telescope and lift it out of the ground, where it breaks through the layer of smog and sees the tower of goo that has been built at the former World of Goo Corporation Headquarters, which can also see past the smog. The telescope falls back to earth before it could see what the Goo Balls were building towards. However, a final and last cutscene reveals their goal; the camera pans up into space to reveal that the Goo Balls that escaped at the end of Chapter 1 have managed to reach a far-off planet populated entirely by Goo Balls.

An additional chapter, located on the Moon, was initially planned for the European retail version of the game. This idea was put on hold as the developer felt they were rushing to finish extra content to justify the price, &quot;If we release any additional content, we will make it available on all platforms, to all people, at the same time. No more of this âregionâ nonsense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2008/11/12/world-of-good-news-euro-release-imminent/ |title=World Of Goo(d News): Euro Release Imminent |accessdate=2011-07-10 |work= |publisher=Rock, Paper, Shotgun  |date=2008-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
[[File:Ron Carmel and Kyle Gabler.jpg|thumb|Ron Carmel and Kyle Gabler, founders of [[2D Boy]] and creators of ''World of Goo'']]
''World of Goo'' was developed by [[2D Boy]], a team based in [[San Francisco]] consisting only of former [[Electronic Arts]] employees Kyle Gabler and Ron Carmel.&lt;ref name=&quot;2DBoy about&quot;/&gt; Carmel and Gabler estimated that development on ''World of Goo'' lasted two years and cost USD $10,000 of their personal savings, which included equipment, food, and rent.&lt;ref name=&quot;venturebeat&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=How the World of Goo became one of the indie video game hits of 2008 |url=http://venturebeat.com/2009/01/02/the-world-of-goo-became-one-of-the-indie-hits-of-2008/ |publisher=Venture Beat |accessdate=2009-01-10 |date=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actual development was usually carried out in [[coffeehouse]]s equipped with [[Hotspot (Wi-Fi)|Wi-Fi hotspot]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;2DBoy about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2dboy.com/about.php |title=Who are you, 2D Boy? |publisher = [[2D Boy]] |accessdate = 2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''World of Goo'' was programmed using available [[open-source]] technologies, including [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]], [[Open Dynamics Engine]] for [[Game physics|physics]] [[Physics engine|simulation]], [[TinyXML]] for configuration files, [[Subversion (software)|Subversion]], [[Mantis Bug Tracker]], and [[PopCap Games Framework]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gamasutra&quot;/&gt; Allan Blomquist, a friend of Gabler and Carmel, was responsible for [[porting]] and optimizing the game for [[WiiWare]].&lt;ref name=&quot;eurogamer interview1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=2D Boy's Ron Carmel and Kyle Gabler - Interview |date=2009-01-15 |author=Walker, John |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2d-boys-ron-carmel-and-kyle-gabler-interview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Release===
''World of Goo'' was first released both for [[Windows]] and [[WiiWare]] in [[North America]] on October 13, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two WiiWare Games and Two Virtual Console Games Added to Wii Shop Channel |url=http://www.nintendo.com/whatsnew/detail/fvAWxg18x4_UYTIcsfyyt8d9vwa6KuSo |publisher=Nintendo |date=2008-10-13 |accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mac OS X]] version was released on November 2.&lt;ref name=&quot;blog Mac&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2dboy.com/2008/11/02/world-of-goo-for-mac-is-ready/ |title= World of Goo for Mac is READY |date=2008-11-02 |publisher=[[2D Boy]] |work=2D Boy blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Linux]] version was released February 13, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World of Goo for Linux Is Here |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/World-of-Goo-for-Linux-Is-Here-104513.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the initial release 2D Boy announced a bonus [[Patch (computing)|patch]] called &quot;Profanity Pack&quot;, which would &quot;[replace] the normal voices in the game with naughty words.&quot; The patch would be made available to users who pre-ordered the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;arstechnica&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2008/03/world-of-goo-preorders-give-you-taste-of-game-profanity-pack.ars |title=World of Goo preorders give you taste of game, &quot;profanity pack&quot; |publisher=[[arsTechnica]] |accessdate=2010-08-08 |date=2010-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2011, the patch has not been released.&lt;ref name=&quot;goofans faq&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goofans.com/faq/world-goo/getting-world-goo |title=Frequently Asked Questions - Getting World of Goo |accessdate = 2011-09-03 |work = goofans!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

2D Boy decided against placing [[Digital rights management|DRM]] protection on the PC versions, stating that &quot;DRM is a futile attempt to prevent [[software piracy|piracy]], and it's expensive.  Every game for which there is demand will be [[Software cracking|cracked]] and find its way onto the scene, so why waste time and money trying to prevent the inevitable?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;destructoid&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.destructoid.com/destructoid-interview-ron-carmel-and-kyle-gabler-creators-of-world-of-goo-110671.phtml |title=Destructoid interview: Ron Carmel and Kyle Gabler, creators of World of Goo |author=Burch, Anthony |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |date=2008-11-07 |accessdate=2011-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2D Boy later reported that between one in five and one in ten copies of the PC versions had been legitimately purchased.&lt;ref name=&quot;piracy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2dboy.com/2008/11/13/90/ |title=90% |work=2D Boy Blog |publisher=2D Boy |date=2008-11-13 |accessdate=2009-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

For the game's [[Europe]]an release in December, 2D Boy depended upon the community to translate and localize ''World of Goo'' into the appropriate languages, including [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Spanish language|Spanish]].{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} During the 2009 [[D.I.C.E.

===Sequel===
2D Boy initially stated that they will not be producing a sequel.&lt;ref name=&quot;WiiFanboy&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nintendo.joystiq.com/2008/11/12/wii-fanboy-interviews-2d-boy-world-of-goo/|title=Wii Fanboy interviews 2D Boy (World of Goo)|work=Joystiq |publisher=Weblogs, Inc |date=2008-11-12 |author=Hinkle, David}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a November 2010 entry on the World of Goo blog Kyle Gabler stated that &quot;a second World of Goo is a possibility, and something we would enjoy working on.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Official World of Goo Blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://2dboy.com/2010/11/21/world-of-goo-on-ipad-releasing-soon/|title=World of Goo on iPad Releasing Soon |work=2DBoy |publisher=2DBoy |date=2010-11-21 |author=Gabler, Kyle}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the community has already developed tools to expand the game, with a number of new levels and modules released on GooFans.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;goofans&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=GooFans: Levels and mods for World of Goo|url=http://goofans.com/|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The ''World of Goo'' soundtrack was created by Kyle Gabler, who also designed, wrote and illustrated the game. It was released as a free download on 20 January 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Music from World of Goo |url=http://kylegabler.com/WorldOfGooSoundtrack/ |publisher=[[Kyle Gabler]] |accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The song &quot;World of Goo Beginning&quot; was created with the intention of resembling [[Libertango]] by [[Ãstor Piazzolla]]. &quot;Regurgitation Pumping Station&quot; was originally written for a friend's short film about going on a date with the [[devil]]. &quot;Threadcutter&quot; was originally written for a game called ''Blow'' which Gabler made available on his site. &quot;Rain Rain Windy Windy&quot; was originally written for the soundtrack for a short children's film, commenting that writing children's music is difficult. &quot;Jelly&quot; was originally written for a short film about a virtual reality world. &quot;Burning Man&quot; was written for a friend's drama/mystery series. He made it by recording two friends singing single notes, and then using a keyboard to make it sound like a choir. &quot;Cog in the Machine&quot; was originally written for another game of his called ''Robot and the Cities who Built Him''.&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack&quot;/&gt;
