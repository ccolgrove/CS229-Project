'''Red Hat, Inc.''' ({{NYSE|RHT}}) is an [[S&amp;P 500]] company in the [[free and open source software]] sector, and a major [[Linux distribution]] vendor. Founded in 1993, Red Hat has its corporate headquarters in [[Raleigh, North Carolina]] with satellite offices worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redhat.com/about/companyprofile/facts/ | title = Corporate Facts | publisher = redhat.com | accessdate = 2006-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Red Hat has become associated to a large extent with its enterprise operating system [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] and with the acquisition of open-source enterprise middleware vendor [[JBoss (company)|JBoss]]. Red Hat provides operating-system platforms along with [[middleware]], applications, and management products, as well as support, training, and consulting services.

Red Hat creates, maintains, and contributes to many free software projects and has also acquired several [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] software packages and released their [[source code]] under mostly [[GNU GPL]] while holding copyright under single commercial entity and selling looser licenses.  {{as of|2009|2}}, Red Hat was the largest corporate contributor to the [[Linux kernel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/sites/main/files/publications/whowriteslinux.pdf | title = Linux Kernel Development: How Fast it is Going, Who is Doing It, What They are Doing, and Who is Sponsoring It | publisher = Linux Foundation | accessdate = 2010-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1993 [[Bob Young (businessman)|Bob Young]] incorporated the ACC Corporation, a [[mail order|catalog]] [[business]] that sold Linux and [[UNIX]] software accessories. In 1994 [[Marc Ewing]] created his own Linux distribution, which he named [[Red Hat Linux]]&lt;ref name=history/&gt; (Ewing had worn his grandfather's red [[lacrosse]] hat while attending [[Carnegie Mellon University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redhat.com/magazine/002dec04/features/name|title=How Red Hat Got Its Name|last=Young|first=Bob|publisher=Red Hat Magazine|date=Dec. 2004|accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/how-red-hat-got-its-name.html|title=How Red Hat Got Its Name|last=Gite|first=Vivek|publisher=nixCRAFT|date=2006-12-19|accessdate=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Ewing released the software in October, and it became known as the Halloween release. Young bought Ewing's business&lt;!-- did it have a name? --&gt; in 1995, and the two merged to become Red Hat Software, with Young serving as [[chief executive officer]] (CEO).

Red Hat [[Initial public offering|went public]] on August 11, 1999, achieving the eighth-biggest first-day gain in the history of [[Wall Street]].&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-10-29|url=http://www.redhat.com/about/corporate/timeline.html|title=Red Hat History |publisher=Red Hat }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew Szulik]] succeeded Bob Young as CEO in December of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/4abf87fc-28db-11da-8a5e-00000e2511c8.html FT.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 15, 1999, Red Hat acquired [[Cygnus Solutions]]. Cygnus provided commercial support for [[free software]] and housed maintainers of [[GNU]] software products such as the [[GNU Debugger]] and [[GNU Binutils]]. One of the founders of Cygnus, [[Michael Tiemann]], became the [[chief technical officer]] of Red Hat and {{As of|2008|alt= by 2008}} the vice president of open source affairs. Later Red Hat acquired WireSpeed, [[C2Net]] and Hell's Kitchen Systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crn.com/it-channel/18806277|title=Red Hat Buys Hell's Kitchen|publisher=ChannelWeb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2000, ''[[InfoWorld]]'' awarded Red Hat its fourth consecutive&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_2000_Feb_7/ai_59207539|title=Red Hat Linux Wins InfoWorld Product of Year Four Years Running|publisher=InfoWorld | date=2000-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Operating System Product of the Year&quot; award for Red Hat Linux 6.1. Red Hat acquired Planning Technologies, Inc in 2001 and in 2004 [[AOL]]'s [[iPlanet]] directory and certificate-server software.

In December 2005 ''CIO Insight'' magazine conducted its annual &quot;Vendor Value Survey&quot;, in which Red Hat ranked #1 in value for the second year in a row.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|format=PDF|url=http://www.redhat.com/f/pdf/sec/CIO_research5_1205.pdf|title=Vendor Value|publisher=CIO Insight}}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Hat stock became part of the [[NASDAQ-100]] on December 19, 2005.

Red Hat acquired open-source middleware provider [[JBoss (company)|JBoss]] on June 5, 2006 and JBoss became a division of Red Hat.

==Fedora Project==

{{Main|Fedora Project}}

Red Hat sponsors the Fedora Project, a community-supported open-source project which aims to promote the rapid progress of free and open-source software and content. Fedora aims for rapid innovation using open processes and public forums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Overview|title=Overview of Fedora Project|publisher=Fedora Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fedora Project Board, which comprises [[community leader]]s and representatives of Red Hat, [[leadership|lead]]s the project and steers the direction of the project and of [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], the [[Linux distribution]] it develops. Red Hat employees work with the code alongside community members, and many innovations within the Fedora Project make their way into new releases of Red Hat Enterprise Linux.

==Business model==
Red Hat partly operates on a [[professional open-source]] [[business model]] based on [[open source code|open code]], development within a community, professional [[quality assurance]], and subscription-based [[customer support]]. They produce open-source code, so more programmers can make further adaptations and improvements.

Red Hat sells subscriptions for the support, training, and integration services that help customers in using open-source software. Customers pay one set price for unlimited access to services such as [[Red Hat Network]] and up to [[24/7]] support.

==Programs and projects==
===One Laptop per Child===
Red Hat engineers work with the [[One Laptop per Child]] initiative (a [[non-profit organization]] established by members of the [[MIT Media Lab]]) to design and produce an inexpensive laptop and provide every child in the world with access to open communication, open knowledge, and [[open learning]]. The [[OLPC XO-1|XO-1.5]] laptop, the {{As of|2008|alt= latest}} machine of this project, runs a slimmed-down version of [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] as its operating system.

===Mugshot===
{{Main|Mugshot (website)}}
Red Hat sponsors [[Mugshot (website)|Mugshot]], an open project building &quot;a live social experience&quot; based on entertainment. It refocuses technological thinking from objects (files, folders, etc.) to activities, like web browsing or music sharing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mugshot.org/faq|title=Mugshot FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; These topics form the focus of the first two features in [[Mugshot (website)|Mugshot]], Web Swarm and Music Radar. These had already started before the announcement of the project at the 2006 Red Hat Summit. The original Mugshot instance hosted by Red Hat has been removed, and mugshot.org redirects to Red Hat's website.

===Dogtail===
[[Dogtail]], an open-source automated [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) test framework initially developed by Red Hat, consists of free software released under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL) and is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]]. It allows developers to build and test their applications. Red Hat announced the release of Dogtail at the 2006 Red Hat Summit.

===MRG===
Red Hat Enterprise MRG (Messaging, Real-time, and Grid) replaces the [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux|RHEL]] kernel in order to provide extra support for [[real-time computing]], together with middleware support for [[message broker]]age and scheduling workload to local or remote [[virtual machine]]s, [[grid computing|grid]], and [[cloud computing|cloud]] infrastructures.&lt;ref&gt;

The ''Under the Brim'' newsletter and ''Wide Open'' magazine merged in November 2004 to become ''Red Hat Magazine''. ''Red Hat Magazine'' later became ''opensource.com''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=The editorial team|title=Now showing: opensource.com|url=http://magazine.redhat.com/2010/01/29/now-showing-opensource-com/|work=Red Hat Magazine|publisher=Red Hat Magazine|accessdate=22 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Red Hat Exchange===
In 2007 Red Hat announced that it had reached an agreement with some [[free software]] and [[open-source software|open source]] (FOSS) companies that allowed it to make a distribution portal called Red Hat Exchange, reselling FOSS software with the original branding intact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://techiqmag.com/2007/03/14/red-hat-launches-business-application-stacks/ Red Hat Prepares Business Application Stacks]{{Dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/mar2007/tc20070314_617979.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_businessweek+exclusives|title=Red Hat Launches Open-Source Exchange|publisher=BusinessWeek}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, Red Hat had abandoned the Exchange program by 2010 to focus their efforts more on their Open Source Channel Alliance which began in April, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kerner|first=Sean Michael|title=What Happened to Red Hat Exchange?|url=http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/reports/6975/1/|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=Linux Planet|date=5 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OpenShift is currently in developer beta, and is free of charge.  

===Other Projects===
Red Hat has some employees working full time on [[free and open source]] software projects, such as two full-time employees working on the free software ''[[Graphics hardware and FOSS#ATI/AMD|radeon]]'' (David Airlie and Jerome Glisse&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=ODg5Nw AMD's Hiring Another Open-Source Driver Developer] [[Phoronix]], December 11, 2010 (Article by [[Michael Larabel]])&lt;/ref&gt;) and one full-time employee working on the free software ''[[nouveau (graphics)|nouveau]]'' graphic drivers.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

==Utilities and tools==
Over and above Red Hat's major products and acquisitions, Red Hat programmers have produced software programming-tools and [[utility software|utilities]] to supplement standard Unix and Linux software. Some of these Red Hat &quot;products&quot; have found their way from specifically Red Hat operating environments via open-source channels to a wider community. Such utilities include:

* Disk Druid (for disk partitioning)
* [[RPM Package Manager|rpm]] (for package management)
* sosreport (gathers system hardware and configuration details)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.die.net/man/1/sosreport|title=sosreport(1) - Linux man page}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|reason=wider community|date=July 2010}}
* [[systemtap]] (tracing tool for Linux kernels, developed in collaboration with IBM, Hitachi, Oracle&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://sourceware.org/systemtap/|title=SystemTap home page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Intel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sourceware.org/systemtap/archpaper.pdf |title=Architecture of systemtap: a Linux trace/probe tool}}&lt;/ref&gt;

| quote = Javed Tapia, President, Red Hat Indian Subcontinent, said, &quot;With open source software, we can modernize the education system far more rapidly than we can with proprietary software. Open source gives schools flexibility and control over their IT infrastructure and freedom from expensive licensing schemes. Open source also helps in building a participative community of educationists and technologists. It is therefore, the way forward, for India's education system and we are pleased to partner with a progressive organization like Lotus Learning Systems Society to take this initiative forward.&quot;

==Mergers and acquisitions==
Red Hat's first major acquisition was Delix Computer GmbH-Linux Div, the [[Linux]] based operating system division of Delix Computer, a [[Germany|German]] computer company, on July 30, 1999. Red Hat acquired [[Cygnus Solutions]], a company that provided commercial support for [[free software]], on January 11, 2000. [[Michael Tiemann]], co-founder of Cygnus, served as the [[chief technical officer]] of Red Hat after the acquisition. On June 5, 2006, Red Hat acquired [[open source]] [[middleware]] provider [[JBoss (company)|JBoss]] for $420&amp;nbsp;million and integrated it as its own division of Red Hat.

On December 14, 1998, Red Hat made its first divestment, in which parts of the company are sold to another company, when [[Intel]] and [[Netscape]] acquired an undisclosed minority stake. The next year, on March 9, 1999, [[Compaq]], [[IBM]], [[Dell]] and [[Novell]] each acquired undisclosed minority stakes in Red Hat. The company's largest acquisition was Cygnus Solutions in January 2000 for $674&amp;nbsp;million. Red Hat made the most acquisitions in 2000 with five: Cygnus Solutions, [[Bluecurve]], Wirespeed Communications, Hell's Kitchen Systems, and [[C2Net]].
