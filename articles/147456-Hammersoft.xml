'''Clemson University''' ({{IPA-en|ËklÉmsÉn|pron}}&lt;ref&gt;The pronunciation of ''Clemson'' varies. The consonant written â¹sâº may be either {{IPA-en|z|}} or {{IPA-en|s|}}, in which case many insert a {{IPAblink|p}} between the two syllables.

==History==
[[Thomas Green Clemson]], the university's founder, came to the foothills of South Carolina in 1838, when he married [[Anna Maria Calhoun]], daughter of [[John C. Calhoun]], a South Carolina statesman and seventh [[Vice President of the United States|U.S. Vice President]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Clemson&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Clemson University|url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history/|work=History of Clemson University|publisher=Clemson University|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Clemson died on April 6, 1888, he left most of his estate, which he inherited from his wife, in his will to be used to establish a college that would teach scientific agriculture and the mechanical arts to South Carolinians.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.clemson.edu/TGC200/the-will.htm Thomas Green Clemson 200 - The Will].&quot; Clemson University. Retrieved 17 September 2011. &lt;/ref&gt; His decision was largely influenced by [[Governor of South Carolina|South Carolina Governor]] [[Benjamin Tillman]]. Tillman strongly lobbied the [[South Carolina General Assembly]] to create the school as an agricultural institution for the state and in the end, the resolution to accept Clemson's gift and create the institution passed by only one vote.

In November 1889, South Carolina Governor [[John Peter Richardson III]] signed the bill, thus establishing the '''Clemson Agricultural College of South Carolina'''. As a result, federal funds for agricultural education were transferred from [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina College]] to Clemson.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of Clemson&quot;/&gt;  ''(See [[Hatch Act of 1887]] and [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act]].)''

'''Clemson Agricultural College''' formally opened in July 1893 with an initial enrollment of 446. From its beginning, the college was an all-white male [[Military academy|military school]]. The school remained this way until 1955 when it changed to &quot;civilian&quot; status for students and became a coeducational institution.

In 1963, the school admitted its first African-American student, future [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], mayor [[Harvey Gantt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.clemson.edu/oir/factBook/Historical%20Enrollment/Integration.htm | title=Harvey Gantt and the Desegregation of Clemson University; an Online version of an exhibit presented by the Library in conjunction with &quot;Integration With Dignity: A Celebration of 40 Years&quot; on January 28, 2003 | accessdate=January 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1964, the college was renamed '''Clemson University''' as the state legislature formally recognized the school's expanded academic offerings and research pursuits.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= The History of Clemson University | url=http://www.clemson.edu/about/history.html | accessdate=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Admissions===
The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]] classifies the university as ''more selective'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Carnegie Classifications of Clemson University | url=http://www.carnegiefoundation.org/classifications/sub.asp?key=748&amp;subkey=16150&amp;start=782 |publisher=[[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching]]| accessdate=June 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; since the university admitted less than fifty-five percent of those who applied to be [[First year|freshmen]] in 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;sc rank&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= U.S. News Rankings Top National Schools | url=http://www.usnews.com/usnews/edu/college/rankings/brief/t1natudoc_brief.php | accessdate=August 17, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clemson.edu/oir/factBook/student/appliedAcceptedEnrolled1.htm &quot;Clemson Freshman Admissions Data&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt; When admitting freshmen, the university places emphasis on the rigor of high-school study and scores on standardized tests, [[SAT]] or [[ACT (examination)|ACT]]. The university also considers class rank, extracurricular activities, and an optional personal statement. The average incoming freshman had a combined SAT score of 1220 and a high-school weighted [[grade-point average]] (GPA) of 3.99 in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clemson.edu/oirweb1/FB/factBook/CUfactbook.cgi?conf_file_name=FBFTF_SAT_College&amp;tabbness=2&amp;colapp=1|title=University Fact Book |publisher=Clemson.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, admission was the most competitive in university history.

It had over 15,000 applications for its freshman class of approximately 2,800 students. It was especially competitive for out-of-state students in that it is a state-supported institution. Of those 15,000+ applications, over 10,000 were from outside of South Carolina; however, a little over 1,000 freshmen from other states gained admission.&lt;ref&gt;{http://www.clemson.edu/newsroom/articles/2008/april/RecordApplications2008.php5}&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has undertaken an endeavor to become a &quot;Top 20&quot; public institution, undergoing a process of enhancing its graduate programs while continuing to emphasize the quality of the undergraduate experience. It has steadily moved up the rankings for public universities from 34,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = U.S. News &amp; World Report | pages = 111â115 | date = August 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 30,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = U.S. News &amp; World Report | pages = 80â84 | date = August 29, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to 27,&lt;ref name=&quot;national rank&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = U.S. News &amp; World Report | date = August 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to 22&lt;ref name=&quot;national rank&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = U.S. News &amp; World Report | date = August 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2008 respectively: according to the ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]''. For 2011, US News &amp; World Report ranked Clemson as the 23rd best public national university in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;national rank&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal | title = U.S. News &amp; World Report }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the year 2012, Clemson ranks number 25th for top public schools in the country according to [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/rankings/national-universities/top-public |title=Top Public Schools &amp;#124; Rankings &amp;#124; Top National Universities &amp;#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its push to enhance graduate-level education, several new [[Ph.D.]] programs have been created including interdisciplinary doctoral programs in Rhetoric and Planning, Design, and the Built Environment (formerly Environmental Design and Planning). Also noteworthy is a new master's degree in historic preservation, jointly offered in collaboration with the [[College of Charleston]].

The university's currently most ambitious academic and research endeavor is the Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR).&lt;ref name=&quot;ICAR&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Clemson University International Center for Automotive Research (CU-ICAR) | url=http://www.clemson.edu/autoresearch/ | accessdate=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The CU-ICAR is a {{convert|250|acre|ha|0|adj=on}} automotive and motorsports research campus located in nearby [[Greenville, South Carolina]]. ICAR will include a graduate school offering master's and doctoral degrees in automotive engineering, and offering programs focused on systems integration. The campus also includes an Information Technology Research Center being developed by [[BMW]]. BMW, [[Microsoft]], [[IBM]], [[Robert Bosch GmbH|Bosch]], [[The Timken Company]] and [[Michelin]] are all major corporate partners of the CU-ICAR. Private-sector companies that have committed so far to establishing offices and/or facilities on the campus include the [[Society of Automotive Engineers]] and Timken. Plans for the campus also include a full-scale, four-vehicle capacity rolling-road model [[wind tunnel]].

In 2004 the Restoration Institute was founded. Its mission is to &quot;advance knowledge in integrative approaches to the restoration of historic, ecological, and urban infrastructure resources.&quot; The institute is located in North Charleston and subsume the Hunley Commission that is currently undertaking the stabilization of the [[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|''H.L. Hunley'']], the world's first [[submarine]] to sink a ship.

In 2011, The Princeton Review ranked Clemson #1 for town-gown relations are great, #2 for happiest students, #2 for jock schools, #3 for everyone plays intramural sports, #8 for students pack the stadiums, and #9 for best career services.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.princetonreview.com/schools/college/CollegeRankings.aspx?iid=1022889 Clemson University].&quot; 2011.

{{main|Clemson Tigers}}

The university offers club, intramural, and varsity sports. Its nineteen varsity men's and women's sports teams compete in the Atlantic Division of the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]]'s [[NCAA Division I|Division I]] as the [[Clemson Tigers]]. The most-prominent athletics facilities on campus are [[Memorial Stadium, Clemson|Memorial Stadium]], [[Littlejohn Coliseum]], [[Doug Kingsmore Stadium]], Historic [[Riggs Field]], and [[Fike Recreation Center]]. Clemson has won four national championships including football (1981), two in men's soccer (1984 and 1987), and men's golf (2003).

====Two-dollar bills====
It has been a university tradition dating from September 24, 1977, for the school's fans to spend [[United States two-dollar bill|two-dollar bills]] on away-game trips. This began when the school played Georgia Tech &quot;for the last time&quot; as Tech refused to travel to Clemson. Of the seventeen games played between Tech and Clemson between 1953 and 1977, only once, in 1974, did the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] deign to come to Death Valley (Memorial Stadium). To show the Atlanta business community how much money Clemson fans contributed to the local economy which would not be coming to town anymore, Tiger fans spent vast quantities of two-dollar bills, many of them stamped with &quot;Tiger Paws&quot;. This was the start of Clemson's two-dollar bill tradition, which was very popular in the 1980s and 1990s, but has waned since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clemsonwiki.com/wiki/1977 |title=1977 |publisher=ClemsonWiki |date= |accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=January 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Blackman, Sam; Bradley, Bob; and Kriese, Chuck (2001).

===Fraternity and sorority life===
{{main|Clemson University Greeklife}}

The university's [[fraternities and sororities]] system (or Greek system) is somewhat different from other large universities in the southern U.S. in that there are no Greek houses on campus as interfraternity activity did not begin until 1970 following the abolishing of the military cadre requirements at the university. There are residence halls designated for fraternities and sororities, but there are no traditional Greek houses on campus. However, there are a few fraternity houses off campus not too far from the college.The Fraternity Quad on campus (consisting of seven fraternity and sorority halls) is certified by the U.S. [[Green Building Council]]'s [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program. The remaining sorority's on-campus housing is located on the other end of campus in what is commonly referred to as &quot;the horseshoe&quot; in Smith and Barnett Halls.

The College Panhellenic Council Chapters at Clemson University include [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Sigma Kappa]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clemsongreeklife.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2&amp;Itemid=4 |title=Chapters |publisher=Clemsongreeklife.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Interfraternity Council Chapters include [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Kappa Lambda]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Chi Psi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], and [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clemsonifc.theginsystem.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17&amp;Itemid=31 |title=Clemson IFC - Fraternities |publisher=Clemsonifc.theginsystem.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the 2010-2011 school year there are twenty IFC Fraternities, eleven NPC Sororities, and nine NPHC Chapters, which make up approximately 20 percent of the undergraduate student body.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fraternity And Sorority Life&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Clemson Greek Life | url=http://www.clemson.edu/campus-life/fraternity-sorority-life/ |accessdate=January 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Spring of 2011, there were 3,370 students involved in greek life, which is about 23% of the 14,531 undergraduate students. Also, the mean GPA of each sorority was above the all university mean.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Clemson University Fraternity and Sorority Life.&quot; Clemson Greek Life. Clemson University, 2011.

[[File:Clemson ROTC cannon.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Clemson's rich military history is very conspicuous on campus]]
===Military heritage===
Although the university became a coeducational civilian institution in 1955, it still maintains an active military presence. The university is home to detachments for [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] and [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) as well as a host school for the [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine Corps]] [[Officer Candidates School (United States Marine Corps)#Platoon Leaders Class|PLC]] program adjacent to the Semper Fi Society.

In addition to students from the university, these organizations also serve students from [[Anderson University (South Carolina)|Anderson University]], [[Southern Wesleyan University]], and [[Tri-County Technical College]]. The following organizations are present among the military personnel at Clemson:&lt;ref name=&quot;student Organizations&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= List of Student Organizations | url=http://dcit.clemson.edu/resources/student_organizations/all.php | accessdate=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* K-7 [[Scabbard and Blade]]
* Maj. [[Rudolf Anderson, Jr]] Squadron [[Arnold Air Society]]
* Maj. Dennis H. Satler Chapter Silver Wings
* Clemson Rangers
* Tiger Platoon

The university's AAS squadron was selected to be home of Arnold Air Society's National Headquarters for the 2005â2006 year, and again for the 2006â2007 year. This is the first time is AAS's history that any university has served as national headquarters two years in a row.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold Air Society&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Student Achievements | url=http://business.clemson.edu/news/bragging/news_brag_students.htm | accessdate=June 20, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The C-4 Pershing Rifles have won the national society's drill meet eight times: 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2008, 2009 and 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arnold Air Society&quot; /&gt; Company C-4 also performs colorguards, twenty-one-gun salutes, exhibition-drill performances, and POW/MIA ceremonies. Company C-4 performs colorguard performance at the university's home football games. In addition to the C-4 drill company, the university is the former home of the 4th Regimental Headquarters (4RHQ), the National Headquarters for the Junior ROTC level of Pershing Rifles (BlackJacks) and the Co-ed Auxiliary for Pershing Rifles (CAPeRs).

Its Air Force ROTC Detachment 770 &quot;Flyin' Tigers&quot; was selected as the #1 &quot;medium-sized&quot; Air Force ROTC detachment in the nation for 2006 (the &quot;High Flight&quot; and &quot;Right of Line&quot; awards), #1 Detachment in the &quot;Southeast&quot; in 2006 (&quot;medium-sized&quot;) and 2007 (&quot;large-sized&quot;), and #1 in the state of South Carolina (out of three â University of South Carolina and The Citadel) three consecutive years (2005, 2006 and 2007).

The university has also developed a group of Marines and Marine Officer Candidates within an organization called the Semper Fi Society. The society is not associated with the ROTC, but can lead to a commission into the U.S. Marine Corps via the Platoon Leaders Course program.
