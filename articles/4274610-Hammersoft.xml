'''Hawar Mulla Mohammed Taher Zebari''' ({{lang-ar|ÙÙØ§Ø± ÙÙØ§ ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø·Ø§ÙØ± Ø²ÙØ¨Ø§Ø±Ù}}, {{lang-ku|ÙÛÙØ§Ø± ÙÛÙØ§ÙØ­ÛÙÛØ¯ ØªØ§ÙØ± Ø²ÛØ¨Ø§Ø±Ù}}, born in 1 June 1981 in [[Mosul]], [[Iraq]]) is an [[Iraq]]i [[Kurdish people|Kurdish]] [[football (soccer)|football]] player, who plays as  [[Midfielder#Winger|Winger]] and [[Defender (association football)#Wingback|Wingback]] positions for [[Zob Ahan Isfahan FC|Zob Ahan]] in [[Iran]]. Hawar is known to be one of the best players in [[Iraq national football team|Iraqi national team]] and was a key figure in Iraq [[2007 Asian Cup]] glory. His younger brother [[Halgurd Mulla Mohammed]] is also a National team player.

==Career==
Having earned a reputation as a regular goalscorer for Iraqi national team and clubs such as Al Ain and Al Ansar, Hawar Mulla Mohammed made a high-profile move to Cypriot champions Anorthosis Famagusta FC in August 2008. 

In a little over a month, the 27-year-old entered the history books as the first Iraqi player to feature in the UEFA Champions League, coming off the bench to help Anorthosis hold Werder Bremen to a goalless draw. A fortnight later, he scored in the second half to seal a memorable 3-1 win for the Cypriots over Greek giants Panathinaikos. 

In doing so, Mohammed demonstrated that he is more than capable of competing at the highest level, and the experience he has gained at club level will be invaluable to Iraq when they rub shoulders with the world's best at the FIFA Confederations Cup South Africa 2009. 

Born in June 1981 in Mosul, Mohammed was recruited by his local club, Mosul FC, at the age of 17. After spending three years with the club, he was signed by Baghdad-based Al Quwa Al Jawiya in 2000.

There, his superb scoring flair and speedy surges down the left flank not only won the hearts of the club's faithful, but also earned him a call-up to the national youth team that had qualified for the FIFA U-20 World Cup Argentina 2001. After flourishing in this fiery baptism on the international stage, he was all but assured of a place with both the Iraq's Olympic team and the nation's senior side. 

He certainly played his part at the Olympic Football Tournament Athens 2004, scoring twice as Iraq finished in fourth place. Mohammed opened his account in the Iraqis' 4-2 win over Portugal and was on target again in their 2-0 victory against Costa Rica, results crucial to earning Iraq a spot in the last eight. 

His career reached a high point in the AFC Asian Cup 2007, when he started in all six of Iraq's matches en route to their first continental title. Mohammed performed well too, and scored the second goal in Iraq's sensational 3-1 win over Australia in the group stage. 

He was also on target against China in Asia's third qualifying round for the 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa, only to see his goal cancelled out by a late header by midfielder Zheng Zhi. Mohammed went on to start in Iraq's next five qualifiers, but the team's lack of consistency took its toll and they failed to progress to Asia's final qualifying round. 

With the FIFA Confederations Cup South Africa 2009 drawing closer, Iraq have a chance to make amends at global level. With Mohammed leading their attack from the left, the Asian hopefuls will certainly pose a threat. 

Hawar was criticized by some Kurdish nationalists for wrapping himself with the [[Flag of Iraq|Iraqi national flag]] during a tournament. At that time, the Iraqi flag was still the same one used by the [[Arab Socialist Ba'th Party|Arab Ba'th party]]'s rule over Iraq, and was viewed by Kurds as a sign of oppression.

In December 2007 Hawar signed 6 months contract with the Qatari Club [[Al-Khor]].

In June 2008 he signed with [[Al-Ansar FC|Al-Ansar]] for his second spell with the club before signing with [[Anorthosis Famagusta]].

Hawar refused to play for Kurdistan football team in [[VIVA World Cup]]. There was no main reason for his refusal and the Kurdish media did not go further into the case. Hawar was not the only Kurdish player who refused to play for Kurdistan football team, however his younger brother [[Halgurd Mulla Mohammed]] played for Kurdistan and scored three goals in VIVA World Cup.

On the 12th August 2008, Hawar signed a one year contract with Cypriot Champions [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]].

Hawar made history on the 17 September 2008 by becoming the first ever Iraqi player to play in the [[UEFA Champions League 2008-09|UEFA Champions League]], after coming on as a substitute in Anorthosis' 0-0 draw with [[Werder Bremen]]; and bettered his record on 1 October 2008 by scoring Anorthosis' third goal against [[Panathinaikos F.C.|Panathinaikos]] In the Champions League.
He joined [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] in July 2009, moving to Iran in August 2009 for first time.&lt;ref&gt;http://fc-perspolis.com/592/ÙÙØ§Ø±_ÙÙØ§_ÙØ­ÙØ¯_Ø¯Ø±_Ø¨Ø§Ø´Ú¯Ø§Ù_Ø­Ø§Ø¶Ø±_Ø´Ø¯&lt;/ref&gt;
He was very undisciplined during his time in [[Persepolis F.C.|Persepolis]] and returned late from the international matches all the time but except that he was a successful player and also influential.On the 22nd of October Hawar signed a 1 year contract with Arbil FC and will be playing for free as respect for the club and the fans. There was one clause included in his contract, that if an offer from a foreign club came in for him, he would be free to move without a transfer fee. 

On 11 July 2011, it was confirmed on his official fan site that he has been linked to [[Zob Ahan Isfahan FC|Zob Ahan]] for a two-year contract.
