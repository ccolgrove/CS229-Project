On November 1, 1966, ([[All Saints Day]]), NFL owners awarded its 16th team franchise to the city of [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.profootballhof.com/history/team.jsp?franchise_id=20|title=Team History: New Orleans Saints|work=Pro Football Hall of Fame website|accessdate=2008-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The expansion draft included future [[Pro Football Hall of Fame|Hall of Famer]] running back [[Paul Hornung]], who set an NFL record by scoring 176 points in only 12 games in [[1960 NFL season|1960]] for the [[Green Bay Packers]], but did not play in [[Super Bowl I]]. Hornung never played a down for the Saints and retired in the preseason due to a neck injury.

Following the expansion draft, the Saints signed Hornung's backfield mate with the Packers, [[Jim Taylor (American football)|Jim Taylor]] to a 10-year, $400,000 contract. Taylor played just one season in his home state (Taylor was a native of [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana|Baton Rouge]] and was an All-American at [[LSU Tigers football|LSU]]) and retired in September 1968.
