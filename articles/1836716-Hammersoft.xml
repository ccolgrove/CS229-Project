'''Area code 516''' is used for [[Long Island]]'s [[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]], located directly east of the [[New York City]] borough of [[Queens]] and west of [[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]].

Upon nationwide adoption of area codes in October 1947, Nassau was part of the [[area code 914|914]] area code along with Suffolk County and about half a dozen counties to the north of New York City.  Soon after, in 1951, Long Island (Nassau and Suffolk) was split from 914 to receive the 516 area code exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://areacode-info.com/!history/1940s50s.htm 1940-50s Area code], areacode.info&lt;/ref&gt;

This area code used to serve both Nassau and Suffolk counties until November 1, 1999, when Suffolk County received the [[area code 631|631]] area code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://areacode-info.com/!history/1999.htm 1999 Area code], areacode.info&lt;/ref&gt;
