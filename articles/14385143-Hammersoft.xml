The '''War on I-4''' is an intercollegiate [[American football]] rivalry game between the [[South Florida Bulls football|University of South Florida Bulls]] and the [[UCF Knights|University of Central Florida Knights]]. It was played from 2005-2008, and the future of the series remains unresolved.

The name of the series is derived from the fact that both universities are located near [[Interstate 4]] (I-4) in [[Central Florida]] and are separated by less than 80 miles. All four of the series games were won by [[South Florida]]. This nickname originally belonged to the [[Arena Football]] [[The War on I-4 (arena football)|rivalry]] between the [[Tampa Bay Storm]] and the [[Orlando Predators]].

In April 2011, UCF head coach [[George O'Leary]] remarked that the series would resume in the future, perhaps as soon as 2014 or 2015, however South Florida officials denied that any form of agreement had been reached.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/bulls/content/report-oleary-says-usf-ucf-rivalry-rekindled&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tboblogs.com/index.php/sports/comments/usf-ucf-football-rivalry-returns/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/bulls/content/usf-says-no-contracts-proposed-football-ucf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebullrush.com/2011/04/well-we-couldnt-just-drive-over-to.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebullrush.com/2011/07/this-ucf-business-has-gone-far-enough.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thebullrush.com/2011/05/thats-enough-oleary.html&lt;/ref&gt;

South Florida is a member of the [[Big East Conference]]. In response to member departures, the Big East has invited UCF among other schools. If UCF accepts, the rivalry could resume in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-11-07/sports/os-ucf-big-east-expansion-1108-20111107_1_temple-and-memphis-bronco-mendenhall-byu]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andre Hall]] ran for 155 yards and scored two touchdowns Saturday night to help South Florida beat Central Florida 31-14. 

A crowd of 45,139, second-largest (until that time) in South Florida's relatively brief football history, watched the Bulls build a 21-0 halftime lead on the strength of a relentless running attack that finished with 326 yards.

UCF was held to 45 yards rushing and was shut out until Joe Burnett returned a third-quarter punt 60 yards to the South Florida 4, setting up Steven Moffett's touchdown run on the next play. 

Moffett also threw a 9-yard TD pass to Brandon Marshall late in the fourth quarter. 

One play after Hall nearly scored on a 17-yard run, [[Pat Julmiste]] added South Florida's last TD on 1-yard quarterback sneak late in the third quarter. Kyle Bronson added a fourth-quarter field goal to make it 31-7.

The Bulls held the Knights to just 145 total yards and [[Kevin Smith (American football running back)|Kevin Smith]], who came in as the nation's leading rusher at 172 yards per game, to just 55 yards in one half of play, the only time during the season that a defense held Smith to under 100 yards.
