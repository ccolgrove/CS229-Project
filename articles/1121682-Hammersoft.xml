{{otherships|USS Honolulu}}
'''USS ''Honolulu'' (SSN-718)''', was a [[Los Angeles class submarine|''Los Angeles''-class submarine]], was the third ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for [[Honolulu, Hawaii]]. The contract to build her was awarded to [[Northrop Grumman Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company]] in [[Newport News, Virginia]] on 15 September 1977 and her keel was laid down on 10 November 1981. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 24 September 1983 sponsored by Mrs. Joan B. Clark, and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 6 July 1985, with Commander Robert M. Mitchell in command.

[[Image:Polar bears near north pole.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Three [[polar bear]]s approach ''Honolulu''{{'}}s [[starboard]] [[Bow (ship)|bow]] while she is on the surface 280 nautical miles (519 kilometers) from the [[North Pole]].]]''Honolulu'' featured unique split stern planes that operated from independent hydraulic systems. With this redundant configuration, the inboard and outboard planes could be operated independently, preventing a failure of one or the other from causing an uncontrolled dive.

''Honolulu''âs patrols are commemorated by ten [[surfboard]]s signed by the crews aboard her at the time.  The latest three are kept on board the submarine; the other seven are stored at [[Pearl Harbor]].

''Honolulu'' held a farewell ceremony in Pearl Harbor on 15 April, 2006, that included remarks by Senator [[Daniel K. Inouye]], Lieutenant Governor [[James Aiona]], U.S. Pacific Fleet commander Admiral [[Gary Roughead]] and former ''Honolulu'' commanding officer Vice Admiral [[Jonathan Greenert]].  ''Honolulu'' put to sea in early May 2006 for her final patrol. Her last patrol ended at [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] in October 2006 where she was placed on stand down, on her way to decommissioning. 

==Final Deposition==
''Honolulu'' was [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioned]] and stricken from the [[Naval Vessel Register]] on 2 November 2007. Ex-''Honolulu'' entered the [[Nuclear Powered Ship and Submarine Recycling Program]] in [[Bremerton, Washington]].

The forward section of ex-''Honolulu'' was transferred to [[USS San Francisco (SSN-711)|USS ''San Francisco'' (SSN-711)]], repairing extensive damage caused by a severe grounding ''San Francisco'' experienced in 2005. The &quot;challenging, one-of-a-kind project&quot; was completed on 20 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=40390 |title=USS San Francisco Undocks With New Bow |date=2008-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
