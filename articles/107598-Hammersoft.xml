'''Arcadia''' is an affluent city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States, and located approximately {{convert|13|mi|km}} northeast of downtown Los Angeles in the [[San Gabriel Valley]] and at the base of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]].

Arcadia is part of a cluster of cities, along with [[Temple City, California|Temple City]], [[Rosemead]], [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]], [[San Marino, California|San Marino]], and [[San Gabriel]], in the west [[San Gabriel Valley]] with a growing Asian population. It is the site of the [[Santa Anita Park]] racetrack and home to the [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]].  The city had a population of 56,364 at the 2010 census, up from 53,248 at the 2000 census. The city is named after [[Arcadia]], Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thanasis.com/modern/places.htm |title=Places Named From Greek Mythology |publisher=Thanasis.com |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Bloomberg Businessweek]] named Arcadia as one of the &quot;Best Places to Raise Your Kids: 2010,&quot; for the second year in a row. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.businessweek.com/ss/09/11/1117_best_places_to_raise_kids/6.htm | title=Best Places to Raise Your Kids: 2010 - from Bloomberg Businessweek |date=November 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Arcadia's beginnings go back over 3,000 years to the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] (&quot;Gabrielino&quot;) Indian tribe, whose inhabitants lived in what is today [[Los Angeles County]].  Their fluid borders stretched from the San Gabriel Mountains in the north to Long Beach in the south, and from the island of Pimu (Catalina) in the west into today's San Bernardino County to the east. These people were also known as the Gabrielinos, a name taken from the Spanish [[Mission San Gabriel Arcangel|San Gabriel Mission]] (in present-day [[San Gabriel, California]]), and under whose control these people worked during the mission period in California. One of Arcadia's settlements of these Native Americans was known as Aleupkigna (or âAluupkenga) (McCawley, William.  ''The First Angelinos:  The Gabrielino Indians of Los Angeles''.  Malki Museum/Ballena Press, 1996) on what later became the [[Rancho Santa Anita]], one of many land grants created during Mexican rule of California (1821â1848). The Tongva are still alive and well today, living in the Los Angeles area and other neighboring communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.arcadia.ca.us/home/index.asp?page=1102 |title=City of Arcadia, CA â History Of Arcadia |publisher=Ci.arcadia.ca.us |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rancho period ===

Originally part of &quot;Rancho Santa Anita&quot;, and owned by San Gabriel Mission, Mayor-Domo, Claudio Lopez. It was named after a family relation named &quot;Anita Cota&quot;, on his wife's side.
In 1839, a large area of land that included the present-day borders of Arcadia was sold to a Scottish immigrant, [[Hugo Reid]].  Reid documented the Native Americans in a series of letters written in 1852 (Reid, Hugo.  ''The Indians of Los Angeles County: Hugo Reid's Letters of 1853''. Southwest Museum, 1968) and served as a delegate to the [[1849 California Constitutional Convention]].
[[Image:BaldwinMansion-Arcadia-1915.jpg|thumb|250px|right|&quot;Anoakia&quot;: Mansion of Anita Baldwin, daughter of &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin, 1915.]]
The land holding changed owners several times before being acquired by the real estate speculator and notorious womanizer [[Lucky Baldwin|Elias Jackson &quot;Lucky&quot; Baldwin]] in 1875.  Baldwin purchased {{convert|8,000|acre|km2}} of Santa Anita for $200,000.  Upon seeing the area, Baldwin gasped âBy Gads! This is paradise!â. Upon buying the land, Lucky chose to make the area his home and immediately started erecting buildings and cultivating the land for farming, orchards and ranches.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;  In 1885, the main line of the [[Santa Fe Railroad]], in which Baldwin was a stockholder, was opened through the ranch, making subdivision of part of the land into a town site practical. In 1889, on a site just north of the corner of First Avenue and St. Joseph Street, adjacent to the Santa Fe tracks, Baldwin opened the 35 room Hotel Oakwood to be the centerpiece of his new town.

=== Incorporation ===

By the turn of the 20th century, Arcadia had a population nearing 500, and a economy that was becoming based on entertainment, sporting, hospitality and gambling opportunities; the latter including an early version of the Santa Anita race track.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt; Baldwin went on to oversee Arcadia's incorporation in 1903 and became the city's first mayor.  His daughter, [[Anita Baldwin]], built a stately mansion named Anoakia in 1914 on {{convert|19|acre|m2}} of land. Anita converted the home into &quot;The Anoakia School for Girls&quot;.   The school later became coeducational but moved out of Arcadia in 1990 after the Anoakia building was declared a fire trap and earthquake danger.  The old estate became overgrown with weeds, and after an extended local debate and efforts to preserve the historic home, the Anoakia mansion, the oldest remaining private property in the city, was finally bulldozed to clear space for 31 luxury homes in 2000.  The old estate featured numerous one-of-a-kind architectural features and a structure whose facade was a replica of Thomas Jefferson's Monticello.  Only the perimeter wall and a guardhouse located at the south-east corner of the property remain to surround the &quot;Anoakia Estates&quot; housing development which occupies the land today. Murals and artifacts from the home are preserved in museums throughout California.
[[Image:ArcadiaBalloonhangers-1922.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Hangars from the U.S. Army's Ross Field Balloon School, 1922.]]
During [[World War I]], Arcadia was home to the U.S. Army's Ross Field Balloon School in what is now Los Angeles County Park.  Here observers were trained to watch enemy activity from hot air balloons.  After World War I, Arcadia's population grew and local businesses included many chicken ranches and other agricultural activities.  During the 1920s and 1930s, Arcadia began its transition to the fine residential city that it is today as small farms and chicken ranches gave way to homes and numerous civic improvements, including a City Library and a City Hall.  Scenes of many of Arcadia's interesting historic sites can be viewed in a series of historic watercolors painted by local artists Edna Lenz and Justine Wishek.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.ci.arcadia.ca.us/dbtw-wpd/queries/arcPAINTquery.htm |title=Edna Lenz and Justine Wishek Paintings |publisher=Library.ci.arcadia.ca.us |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thoroughbred horse racing, which had flourished briefly under Lucky Baldwin until it was outlawed by the state of California in 1909, returned to Arcadia with the opening of the beautiful Santa Anita Park in December 1934 when racing was legalized again.
[[Image:Arrivals.gif|right|thumb|250px|Japanese Americans arrive at the Internment Camp at the Santa Anita Park racetrack.]]

During [[World War II]], Arcadia's [[Santa Anita Park]] racetrack became the site of the Santa Anita Assembly Center for the Japanese, where Japanese Americans were interned under President Franklin Roosevelt's [[Executive Order 9066]] (''See: [[Japanese internment in the United States]]'').  At one point, the assembly center at the racetrack was the largest [[Japanese American]] assembly center in the United States. 400 temporary barracks were constructed in the racetrack parking lot to house the prisoners. Internees lived three families to a barrack (or horse-stable in some cases), took group showers, lacked private bathrooms, and lived under 24-hour armed surveillance. Conditions were extremely difficult with each resident being given an âArmy manufacture bed, one blanket and one straw tickâ (McAdam, Pat and Snider, Sandy.  ''Arcadia: Where Ranch and City Meet'', p.&amp;nbsp;147)  The Assembly Center, which opened in April 1942, ran until the end of October 1943, when the internees were relocated inland to more permanent internment camps in [[Owens Valley]], [[Utah]], and [[Wyoming]]. In March 1943, Camp Santa Anita was established for 20,000 Army Ordnance troops. At the time, Arcadia's civic leaders were very vocal in their support of the internment policies of the Federal Government. (''See: [[Japanese internment in the United States]]'')

=== Postwar period ===
Arcadia largely grew up as the well-to-do suburb of neighboring [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], with many early residents being the sons and daughters of long established Southern California families.  A large tract of estate homes was developed by Harry Chandler, the scion of the Los Angeles Times, who lived in adjacent [[Sierra Madre, California]]. The city also became the residence of choice for many corporate chief executives, including those in aerospace, the horse racing industry, and finance.

The postwar boom saw Arcadia grow rapidly into a suburban residential community, with many of the chicken ranches being subdivided into home lots.  Between 1940 and 1950, the population grew by more than two and a half times.  The housing boom continued through the 1950s and 1960s and along with that growth came the necessary infrastructure of schools, commercial buildings, and expanded city services.

During the postwar boom, a modern commercial district developed along Baldwin Avenue south of Huntington Drive in west Arcadia. In 1951 this strip, called the West Arcadia Hub, was anchored by a new, locally owned department store called [[Hinshaw's Department Stores|Hinshaw's]]. This was the first large department store to be built in Arcadia, and the largest in the western [[San Gabriel Valley]] outside the city of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. This development marked the beginning of Arcadia's gradual transformation into one of the leading shopping districts of the San Gabriel Valley.

In 1947, {{convert|111|acre|km2}} that comprised the heart of the Baldwin Ranch were deeded to the State of California and the County of Los Angeles, and developed into [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]].

Until a [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in 1965, every property sale contract within the borders of Arcadia had to include a provision that the new owner could only sell the property to a white Protestant, though many non-Protestant families did, in fact, own homes and live in Arcadia long before that ruling.

In October 1975, the Santa Anita Fashion Park was opened to the public on the corner of Baldwin Avenue and Huntington Drive. The center court featured a gigantic blue head by [[Roy Lichtenstein]], later removed.  Now known as [[Westfield Santa Anita]], the mall was expanded in 2004. The mall was affected by the recession in the late 2000s, but continues  to do a relatively brisk business.  This mall has been embroiled in a battle against Caruso Affiliated, a real estate development company which has proposed the building of a large outdoor entertainment, shopping, and dining complex in the parking lot of the adjacent Santa Anita Park racetrack. The proposed project, called the &quot;Shops at Santa Anita&quot;, would be roughly the same size as the existing Westfield mall.

[[James Dobson]], a previous Arcadia resident, founded the nonprofit [[Christianity|Christian]] ministry [[Focus on the Family]] in the city in 1977. Its original office still stands on the south side of [[Foothill Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Foothill Blvd]]. Focus grew to larger quarters in the city, and in intervening years expanded to [[Monrovia, California|Monrovia]] for warehouse space before moving out of Arcadia completely in 1990. Focus of the Family is now based in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]]; but still has thousands of members in Arcadia.

In the late 1990s, [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] activists threatened to sue [[Arcadia High School (Arcadia, California)|Arcadia High School]] over its use of the &quot;[[Apache]]&quot; mascot. The high school's use of Native American symbols, including an &quot;Apache Joe&quot; mascot, the ''Pow Wow'' school newspaper, the &quot;Apache News&quot; television program, the &quot;Smoke Signals&quot; news bulletin boards, the school's auxiliary team's marching &quot;Apache Princesses&quot; and opposing football team fans' &quot;Scalp the Apaches&quot; signs were viewed by these Native American activists and many Arcadia community members as being offensive. The school consulted with Native American groups and made some concessions but didn't change the mascot. Some residents of Arcadia, who are former students at the school and have Native American ancestry, do not take offense to the school's use of these symbols. Arcadia High School has established good relations with the Apache community with their yearly charity drive to aid them.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

== Economy ==
Arcadia's economy is driven by wholesale trade, retail trade, manufacturing, health care and social assistance, arts, entertainment, and recreation. Revenue from the [[Santa Anita Racetrack]] has long supported capital improvements for the City of Arcadia, resulting in the City having very little bonded indebtedness.

The [[Westfield Santa Anita]] mall (formerly the Santa Anita Fashion Park) is a major shopping center in the city.  In 2005, the Westfield Santa Anita completed its first phase of expansion featuring a new food court, [[Sport Chalet]], [[Borders Books and Music]], [[Dave &amp; Busters]], numerous smaller retailers, various full-service eateries in an area known as Restaurant Square, and a 16-screen [[AMC Theatres]]. In 2008, expansion of the mall continued as the Promenade outdoor structure was completed, with new high-end retailers such as [[Coach, Inc.|Coach]] and [[Talbots]].

The  proposal by [[Caruso Affiliated]] and Magna Entertainment to build a second large shopping mall adjacent to Westfield Santa Anita on the grounds of the Santa Anita Park racetrack will be coming into fruition in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;SSA&quot;&gt;[http://www.shopsatsantaanita.com/about.html &quot;About: Shops at Santa Anita&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The controversial project, known as &quot;The Shops at Santa Anita&quot;, has prompted heated debate among some residents in the community and enormous spending by corporate interests in favor and against the project.  If the second mall is built, the combined size of the two malls will make Arcadia the largest retail shopping district in Los Angeles county.  &quot;The Shops at Santa Anita&quot;, which required City Council approval, will, according to early plans, include signature retail, restaurants, and landscaping featuring a large decorative water display, all situated in what is the race track's southern parking area.&lt;ref&gt;Daunt, Tina, [http://arcadia.patch.com/articles/caruso-pushes-to-build-the-shops-at-santa-anita &quot;Caruso Pushes to Build the Shops at Santa Anita&quot;], ''Arcadia Patch'', December 13, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hospital ==

Located at 300 W. Huntington Drive, Methodist Hospital&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://methodisthospital.org |title=Methodist Hospital |publisher=Methodist Hospital |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; sits on {{convert|22|acre|m2}} of land. The 460-bed hospital opened in Arcadia in 1957, after moving from downtown Los Angeles.  Methodist was the state's first community hospital to have a psychiatric unit. Its nursery school was one of the first corporate daycare facilities in the U.S. It was an ''Official Hospital of the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Olympic Games]]''.

To keep up with the changing needs of the community, several upgrades have been made to the original facility. In 1998, the Berger Tower was completed, adding 169 beds. Methodist underwent a major renovation and expansion in 2006, and in the fall of 2011, a new five-story patient tower and new emergency department are scheduled for completion.

===The Methodist Hospital School of Nursing===
A School of Nursing opened at the hospital in 1915, with a class of 30 students. Ten years later, a residence was built to accommodate 150 graduate and student nurses. This four-story brick building, known as Philomena Hall, was connected to the hospital by an underground corridor and provided accommodations, classrooms and a gymnasium for the nurses. Beginning in 1944 (after a nine-year school closure), additional housing for nurses was provided in a refurbished residential house adjacent to Philomena Hall. After more than 40 years of operation and the graduation of hundreds of talented young nurses, the School of Nursing closed. Times had changed, and the practice of nursing education had moved into the domain of the formal education system. The school was phased out in 1958 with the graduation of the last nursing class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.methodisthospital.org/AboutUs/Pages/SchoolofNursing.aspx |title=School of Nursing |publisher=Methodisthospital.org |date= |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Popular culture ==
The famous [[U.S. Route 66]], immortalized in song and literature, passes through Arcadia, on Huntington Drive in Downtown Arcadia, before turning off onto Colorado Place and then Colorado Street. After intersecting the 210 freeway, Route 66 runs parallel to and south of the freeway, cutting across the middle section of Arcadia.

The city is mentioned by [[Jack Kerouac]] in his novel ''[[On the Road]]'': Sal, the protagonist, is put off by &quot;[[preppy]]&quot; teens when he stops for food at a local drive-in restaurant with a young Mexican woman. The vignette demonstrates the culture clash between the &quot;[[Beatnik]]&quot; way of life and that of 1950s conservative America.

In a motel located in Arcadia across the street north-east from Santa Anita Racetrack, author [[Hunter S. Thompson]] wrote much of his novel, ''[[Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas]]'' in the 1970s. In Michael Cunningham's novel ''[[The Hours (novel)|The Hours]]'', Laura Brown mentions that she heard of a man who died in nearby Arcadia.

The McDonald brothers, who later began the [[McDonald's]] hamburger restaurant chain, opened their first restaurant, The Airdrome, near Monrovia Airport, on the Arcadia/Monrovia border in 1937. &lt;ref&gt;http://members.tripod.com/airfields_freeman/CA/Airfields_CA_LA_E.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://thelongestlistofthelongeststuffatthelongestdomainnameatlonglast.com/first49.html&lt;/ref&gt; The restaurant was located on historic route 66, now Huntington Drive, but later moved to San Bernardino, California in 1940.

In the comic strip ''[[Pearls Before Swine (comic strip)|Pearls Before Swine]]'', Pastis`s mother lives in Arcadia.

The city is mentioned in the twenty-first episode of ABC's ''[[FlashFoward]]'', which is set in Los Angeles.

''[[The X-Files]]'' episode [http://x-files.wikia.com/wiki/Arcadia Arcadia] demonstrates the downfalls of fascist conformity in the upper-middle class planned communities in the town.

== Sights ==

The [[Los Angeles County Arboretum and Botanic Garden]] is located in Arcadia across from the Santa Anita mall and racetrack.  It is a popular attraction, especially for the flock of [[peafowl]] that inhabit the grounds and neighborhood near the arboretum.  The peafowl are a remainder of the former Baldwin ranch.  The peafowl were originally introduced to help Baldwin control the snakes and snails on his farm but they have since gone wild. They are considered an attraction to some residents and a nuisance to others due to their loud cries and the droppings they leave on residents' properties.&lt;ref name=&quot;images.businessweek.com&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Bell | first = Alison | title = Peacock's tale reaches back to Baldwin | newspaper = Los Angeles Times | location = Los Angeles, CA | pages = A38 | date = May 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ci.arcadia.ca.us/docs/peacock_pamphlet_for_website._pdf.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Arcadia Festival of Bands is a popular local yearly event.
