'''Southern Illinois''' (most of which is known as &quot;'''Little Egypt'''&quot; or &quot;'''Egypt'''&quot;) is the southern third of the state of [[Illinois]]. With the [[area code 618]], the southern part of Illinois is geographically, culturally, and economically distinct from the rest of the state. The region is surrounded on three out of four sides by the most voluminous rivers in the United States, the [[Wabash River|Wabash]] and [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers to the east and south, and the [[Mississippi River]] and its connecting [[Missouri River]] to the west. 

Southern Illinois' most populated city is currently [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]] at 44,478. Other principal cities include [[Collinsville, Illinois|Collinsville]], [[Edwardsville, Illinois|Edwardsville]], [[Mount Vernon, Illinois|Mt. Vernon]], [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]],  and [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], where [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|the main campus]] of [[Southern Illinois University]] is located.  Residents also travel to amenities in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] and [[Cape Girardeau, Missouri]]; [[Evansville, Indiana]]; and [[Paducah, Kentucky]]. 

The area has a population of 1.2 million people{{GR|6}}, who live mostly in rural towns and [[city|cities]] separated by extensive farmland and the [[Shawnee National Forest]]. The two most dense areas of population are [[Metro-East]], which is the partly industrialized Illinois portion of the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis Metropolitan Area]] and the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area centered on [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]] and [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], a two-county area that is home to 123,272 residents.

Settled by European-American migrants from the [[Upland South]] who traveled by the Ohio River, in its early decades it was more affiliated with the southern agricultural economy and rural culture. Many areas were based on a strictly [[coal mining]] economy. With the exception of the counties in the [[Greater St. Louis|St. Louis MSA]], much of Southern Illinois is culturally affiliated with [[western Kentucky]], [[southwestern Indiana]], and southeast [[Missouri]]. Southern Illinois, the oldest and once the wealthiest part of Illinois, is known for its rich history, and plethora of [[antebellum architecture]] in its small towns and cities. 

Southern Illinois is slowly gaining a cultural identity apart from its neighbors as dispersed rural populations become more centralized around the cities of [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]] and [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]]. Marion grew by more than 45% from 1970 to 2010 and in the process has been selected for Illinois' first STAR Bonds District for the Millennium Development, a project originally designed for a city ten times its size.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyrepublicannews.com&quot;&gt;http://www.dailyrepublicannews.com/features/x1696237327/State-certifies-Marion-STAR-bond-district&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Early history===
The earliest inhabitants of Illinois were thought to have arrived about 12,000 B.C. They were [[hunter-gatherer]]s, but developed a primitive system of agriculture. After 1000 AD, their agricultural surpluses enabled them to develop complex, hierarchical societies.  With the rise of the [[Mississippian culture]] in the Mississippi and Ohio valleys, the leaders organized thousands of workers to build complex urban areas with numerous large [[Earthworks (archaeology)|earthworks]], pyramidal, ridgetop and conical [[mound]]s, used for religious, political and ceremonial purposes. [[Cahokia]], located in present-day Collinsville, Illinois, was the major regional center of this culture. It contains the largest prehistoric earthworks in the Americas, and is designated a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]]. Their culture seems to have died out around 1400-1500 AD and the Mississippians abandoned Cahokia centuries before the Europeans arrived.&lt;ref name=History&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Southern Illinois: Narrative Account of Its Historical Progress, Its People and Its Principal Interests|first=George|last=Smith|publisher=Higginson Book Company|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Img kask.jpg|thumb|left| Menard Academy, the first Visitation Academy in the midwest at Kaskaskia, Illinois, was founded in 1833.]]
The Illini Indian tribes, after whom the state is named, and other Indian tribes arrived in Illinois around 1500 AD. Archeologists do not know if these Indians are were related to the previous inhabitants. The Illini left behind all manner of artifacts, including burial sites, burned-out campfires along the bases of bluffs, pottery, flints, implements, and weapons. Structures built by Indian tribes include stone forts or &quot;pounds&quot;. Visitors can see a stone fort built in [[Giant City State Park]] near [[Makanda, Illinois|Makanda]]. At least eight other structures are known in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; 
[[File:Jm18078.JPG|thumb|right|Jarrot Mansion, in [[Cahokia, Illinois|Cahokia]], is the oldest brick structure in the state of Illinois, built in 1807.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cnycentral.com/news/story.aspx?id=438535&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[French people|French]] were the first Europeans to reach Illinois, in about 1673. When they arrived, the Indians welcomed them. French explorers named [[Illinois]] as the land where the Illini Indians lived. They explored the Mississippi River, establishing outposts and seeking a route to the Pacific Ocean and the Orient. Because of increasing Indian unrest and warfare in [[Northern Illinois]], the French concentrated on building outposts in the southern part. The earliest European settlers in Southern Illinois were concentrated along the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]], [[Ohio River|Ohio]], and [[Wabash River|Wabash]] rivers, which provided routes for travel and trade.  Their settlements became important French way stations and supply depots between Canada and their ports on the lower Mississippi River. Other important early outposts in Southern Illinois were located at [[Old Shawneetown, Illinois|Old Shawneetown]] and [[Fort Massac]] on the Ohio River.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

After defeating the French in the [[French and Indian War]] and with the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, the [[England|English]] ruled the [[Lower Great Lakes]] region. Their rule of this area was short lived.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

===Arrival of European settlers===
[[Image:Fort de Chartres powder magazine 1-02Aug07.jpg|thumb|right|The French [[Fort de Chartres]]' powder magazine, restored, is thought to be the oldest standing building in Illinois. Constructed out of limestone in 1756.]]
[[Image:Shawneetown bank.jpg|right|thumb|The Bank of Illinois in [[Shawneetown, Illinois|Shawneetown]], built in 1839-1841, shown in 1937]]
European-American settlers were initially slow to arrive in Illinois; in 1800 fewer than 2,000 non-Native Americans lived in Illinois.  Soon more settlers came from the backwoods areas of [[Kentucky]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[the Carolinas]]. These early settlers were mostly of [[English people|English]], [[Germans|German]], and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; 

In 1787, the federal government included Illinois in the [[Northwest Ordinance]], a territory including present-day Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin. Illinois became a part of the [[Indiana Territory]] in 1800. Illinois settlers wanted more control over their own affairs and Illinois became a separate territory in 1809. In late 1811 and early 1812 the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|New Madrid earthquakes]] struck the region as one of the largest successions of [[earthquake]]s, including the most intensive ever indirectly inferred (not recorded) in the [[contiguous United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; 

The first bank to be chartered in Illinois was located at [[Old Shawneetown, Illinois|Old Shawneetown]] in 1816. The first building used solely to house a bank in Illinois was built in 1840 in Old Shawneetown and was used until the 1920s. The [[Shawneetown Bank State Historic Site|Old Shawneetown State Bank]] has been restored as an historical site. Crops of [[cotton]] and [[tobacco]] were grown in the extreme southern region of Illinois. Cotton was grown mostly for the home weaver, but during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], cotton was also grown for export, since the regular supply of cotton from the South was not available. Enough tobacco was grown to make it a profitable crop for export. Both crops have been succeeded by other agricultural commodities.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

===19th century turbulence===
[[File:Timthumbbelle.jpg|thumb|[[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]] around the turn of the 20th century.]]
In 1858, [[Abraham Lincoln]] ran for the U.S. Senate against [[Stephen A. Douglas]]. A debate was held in seven towns in Illinois, one being near [[Jonesboro, Illinois|Jonesboro]]. Many of the people living in Southern Illinois were first or second-generation Southerners, and the [[American Civil War]] caused mixed loyalties in this region. [[Cairo, Illinois]], at the southern tip where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi, was of strategic importance. On either side of the rivers were states which, despite remaining in the Union, had numerous residents who were sympathetic to the South and even enlisted in the [[Confederate States Army]]. Cairo served as a staging area for [[Union Army]] expeditions into the border states of Missouri and Kentucky, and also the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] states of Tennessee and Mississippi. 

A feud between families in [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson County]], called the [[Bloody Vendetta]], lasted nearly ten years and took many lives. In all, 495 assaults with a deadly weapon were committed and 285 murders took place in Williamson County between 1839 and 1876. This was very unusual, as crime was almost non-existent in Illinois during its frontier years prior to this period of lawlessness.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

===Rise and fall during the 20th century===

[[Coal mining]] became an important industry in Southern Illinois at the turn of the century, with cities such as [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]] prospering, having a population of 16,000 people during the 1920s.&lt;ref name=RAILROAD&gt;{{cite book|title=When the railroad leaves town: American communities in the age of rail line abandonment|first=Joseph|last=Schwieterman|publisher=Truman State University|page=59|year=2002|isbn=0943549981}}&lt;/ref&gt; Union miners all over the nation went on strike in 1922; during this phase, 20 people were killed during a riot in [[Herrin, Illinois|Herrin]], in Williamson County.  It was called the [[Herrin Massacre]] and the county was known as [[Bloody Williamson]] for years to come.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Shelton Brothers Gang]] and [[Charles Birger]] gangs operated in Southern Illinois in the 1920s. Shoot-outs between these and other rival gangsters and between law enforcement officers were common. After being convicted of ordering the murder of the mayor of [[West City, Illinois|West City]], the leader of the Birger gang, Charlie Birger, was hanged in 1928. In 1925 the [[Tri-State Tornado]] was the deadliest on record, devastating the city of [[Murphysboro, Illinois|Murphysboro]] killing 234, the most in a single city in [[History of the United States|U.S. history]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; 

The [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s caused coal miners to lose their jobs when mine after mine closed. Farmers could not sell their crops and lost their land; families defaulted on their home mortgage loans; and young people from the region began leaving for the cities to find work and a better life. After [[World War II]], job growth rose within the region, but unemployment continued to impact the region for decades afterward.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  When the [[Clean Air Act (1990)|Clean Air Act of 1990]] forced many utility companies in the United States to switch to low-sulfur coal, the Southern Illinois region lost markets for its coal, and the economy suffered.&lt;ref name=&quot;IllinoisIssue&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lib.niu.edu/1993/ii931119.html |title=Coal is a dirty word |work=Harrisburg Illinois Library |accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture has become the main economic drive for the Southern Illinois region since.

Southern Illinois is slowly gaining a cultural identity apart from its neighbors as dispersed rural populations become more centralized around the cities of [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]] and [[Belleville, Illinois|Belleville]]. Marion has grown tremendously since 1970 and is in the process has been selected for Illinois' first STAR Bonds District for the Millennium Development, a project originally designed for a city ten times its size.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailyrepublicannews.com&quot;/&gt;

The smaller cities in the region have seen significant population drops as they struggle to compete with the Carbondale-Herrin-Marion combined statistical area and the [[Metro East]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.census.gov/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of &quot;Little Egypt&quot; name===
[[Image:Littleegyptmap.PNG|thumb|upright|Southern Illinois is also known as &quot;Little Egypt&quot;.]]
[[Image:Viennail11.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Johnson County, Illinois|Johnson County]] Courthouse Finished in 1871 for $80,000 in Vienna.]]
The nickname &quot;Egypt&quot; may have arisen in the 1830s, when poor harvests in the north of the state drove people to Southern Illinois to buy grain. Others say it was because the land of the great Mississippi and [[Ohio River]] valleys were like that of Egyptâs [[Nile]] delta.  According to Hubbs, the nickname may date back to 1818, when a huge tract of land was purchased at the confluence of the rivers and its developers named it [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] ({{IPA-en|ËkÉÉroÊ|pron}}) Today, the town of Cairo still stands on the peninsula where the Ohio River joins the Mississippi.  
[[Image:SlaveHouse666.jpg|thumb|right|[[Crenshaw House (Gallatin County, Illinois)|The Crenshaw House]], better known as the &quot;Old Slave House&quot;. In 2004, the [[National Park Service]] named the mansion as a &quot;station&quot; on the [[Reverse Underground Railroad]] to acknowledge Crenshaw's illegal practice of kidnapping free African Americans in Illinois and selling them as slaves in the neighboring [[Slave State]]s.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Old Slave House.&quot; National Park Service Network to Freedom Database. National Park Service. Accessed online May 23, 2010. [http://www.nps.gov/ugrr/TEMPLATE/FrontEnd/Site3.CFM?SiteTerritoryID=94&amp;ElementID=427&amp;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Musgrave, Jon. 2005. ''Slaves, Salt, Sex &amp; Mr. Crenshaw: The Real Story of the Old Slave House and America's Reverse Underground R.R.'' Published by Illinoishistory.com. 608 pages.&lt;/ref&gt;
]]
Other settlements in that area were also given names with Egyptian, [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Middle East]]ern origins: The [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]] [[Saluki]]s [[Southern Illinois Salukis|sports teams]] and towns like [[Thebes, Illinois|Thebes]], [[Dongola, Illinois|Dongola]], [[Palestine, Illinois|Palestine]], [[Lebanon, Illinois|Lebanon]], [[New Athens, Illinois|New Athens]] ({{IPA-en|njuË ËeÉªÎ¸Énz|pron}}), [[Sparta, Illinois|Sparta]], and [[Karnak, Illinois|Karnak]] show the influence of classical culture as towns were founded. (Greek names were also related to the contemporary national pride in the new republic of the early 19th century, and were given to towns throughout the Midwest.) Egyptian names were concentrated in towns of Little Egypt but also appeared in towns further south. For instance, about {{convert|100|mi|km|sigfig=1}} south of Cairo, along the Mississippi, lies [[Memphis, Tennessee]], named after the [[Memphis, Egypt|Egyptian city]] on the Nile. 

Although Illinois was a free state prior to the [[American Civil War]], in Little Egypt some residents still owned slaves. Illinois law generally forbade bringing [[slave]]s into Illinois, but a special exemption was given to the salt works near [[Equality, Illinois|Equality]], Illinois.  In addition, an exception was made for slaveholders who held long-term indentured servants or descendants of slaves in the area before statehood.

The nicknames for this region also arose from the settlement factors that brought political tensions prior to and during the [[American Civil War]], as regions of the state allied differently with North and South.  Because southern Illinois was settled by southerners, they maintained a sympathy for many issues of their former states. They supported the continuation of slavery. They voted Democratic, when the northern part of the state was supporting Republicans.  The meaning comes across in this quote from the 1858 campaign of Douglas and Abraham Lincoln:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;In 1858, debating in northern Illinois, Douglas had threatened Lincoln by asserting that he would 'trot him down to Egypt' and there challenge him to repeat his antislavery views before a hostile crowd. The audience understood Douglas: overwhelming proslavery sentiment and Democratic unanimity in Egypt had led to the nickname.&quot;&lt;ref name=springhouse&gt;{{cite web| last=Simon |first= John Y.| title=Judge Andrew D. Duff of Egypt|url= http://www.springhousemagazine.com/egypt.htm |publisher=Springhouse Magazine Online| date=2006-04-07|accessdate=2008-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

In the fall of 1861, Democrats surprisingly took a majority of seats in the state legislature.  They worked to pass provisions of a new constitution, an initiative begun in 1860.  They proposed reapportionment so the southern region's less populous counties would have representation equal to those in the north, which was growing more rapidly.  Northern Illinois residents worried about the state coming under the political will of the southern minority.  &quot;Shall the manufacturing, agricultural and commercial interests of northern Illinois be put into Egyptian bondage?&quot; wondered the ''Aurora Beacon''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dig.lib.niu.edu&quot;&gt;[http://dig.lib.niu.edu/civilwar/politics.html Drew E. VandeCreek, &quot;Politics in Illinois and the Union During the Civil War&quot;], ''Illinois During the Civil War'', 2002, Northern Illinois University Library, accessed 3 Jul 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Lincoln gave a commission as brigadier general to Southern Illinois Democrat, [[John Alexander McClernand]] telling him to &quot;keep Egypt right side up&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=qywOAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA421&amp;lpg=PA421&amp;dq=%22keep+Egypt+right+side+up%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=HFqx_G5yHW&amp;sig=YY-PHuX74L_LLv0pz155x5P4KCg&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0ABXTLOlCI7rnQe9yfneAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CBQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22keep%20Egypt%20right%20side%20up%22&amp;f=false Life obn the Circuit with Lincoln], [[Henry Clay Whitney]], 1892&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, southern Illinois became the center of the [[Knights of the Golden Circle]], a secret group devoted to supporting the Confederacy.  With concern rising about armed southern sympathizers, in August 1862, U.S. Marshal David Phillips arrested several Democrats who allegedly belonged to the Knights, including men in respectable positions: Congressmen, state representatives, and judges.  One was Circuit Judge Andrew Duff.  They were sent to Washington, DC, where they were held for 68 days before release, but they were never charged. Democrats won across the state in the fall election.&lt;ref name=springhouse/&gt;   
[[File:CairoIllPerspectiveMap1885.jpg|right|thumb|[[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] panoramic map, 1885. The city sits between two rivers, reminding early settlers of the [[Nile Delta|Egyptian Delta]].]]
After the war, other reasons were proposed for the nickname.  Political divisions continued in the state. In the later 19th century, the central and southern agricultural areas joined the Populist Movement. Chicago and the industrial North aligned with similar areas and continued Republican.&lt;ref name=&quot;dig.lib.niu.edu&quot;/&gt;   

In 1871 Judge Andrew Duff wrote an article in which he ignored the war years and preceding political divisions.  He claimed the name of Egypt related to Southern Illinoisâ role in supplying [[cereal|grain]] to northern and central Illinois following the &quot;Winter of the Deep Snow&quot; in 1830â31.  Following a long winter and late spring, Upper Illinois lost much of its harvest in an early September [[frost]].  Southern Illinois's weather gave it good crops, so it could ship grain and corn north.  The nickname supposedly arose from similarities of the events to the well-known [[Bible]] story of [[Jacob]]âs sons going to [[Egypt]] for grain to survive a famine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.springhousemagazine.com/egypt2.htm Judge Andrew D. Duff, &quot;Egypt&quot; (23 Nov 1871 article from ''The Golconda Weekly'')], ''Springhouse Magazine Online'', April 2006, accessed 3 Jul 2008&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Belly dance]]r [[Farida Mazar Spyropoulos]]' appearance as &quot;Little Egypt&quot; at the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]] in [[Chicago]] brought notoriety to the name, but she had no connection to the Illinois region. Other dancers took up the stage which popularized it further in the early 20th Century.

One of the earliest uses of the phrase &quot;Little Egypt&quot; is found in the ''Troy Weekly Call'' of Troy, Illinois, in 1912. A state news brief was headlined, &quot;Two New Little Egypt Pastors.&quot; about two new Presbyterian pastors about to be installed at [[Brookport, Illinois|Brookport]] and [[Salem, Illinois|Salem]], Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Feb. 23, 1912. &quot;Illinois News: Two New Little Egypt Pastors.&quot; ''Troy Weekly Call'' (Troy, Ill.). 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chicago Tribune'' appears to have first used the phrase &quot;Little Egypt&quot; in reference to Southern Illinois on 25 April 1920 in an article about fruit grown in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Ridgway. April 25, 1920. &quot;Farm and Garden.&quot; ''Chicago Tribune''. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The title character in the comic strip &quot;[[Moon Mullins]]&quot; had a girlfriend named Little Egypt. The strip's creator Frank Willard, was a native of [[Anna, Illinois|Anna]] and Southern Illinois.&lt;ref&gt;Oct. 12, 1923. &quot;Moon Mullins-Little Egypt Was There.&quot; ''Chicago Daily Tribune'' (Chicago, Ill.). 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern boundary===
&quot;Southern Illinois&quot; is not a formal geographic designation and definitions of what constitutes Southern Illinois vary. For most Southern Illinois residents, an area between [[Interstate 70]] and [[Interstate 64]] is the dividing line between the Central and Southern parts of the state. The geography of Illinois becomes gradually hillier as one travels farther South. One can see this driving south along [[Interstate 57]]. The [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]]/[[Charleston, Illinois|Charleston]] area is fairly flat. Terrain becomes noticeably less flat as one gets to [[Effingham, Illinois|Effingham]], but it is still level enough to support the vast corn and soybean fields that are so common in the rest of Central Illinois. South of Effingham on the interstate, one sees more trees and terrain that is too hilly even for most large farms.

Located within the western reaches of the [[Cypress Creek National Wildlife Refuge|Cache River]], Southwest Illinois is the second most populated region. The region's most notable institution is the main campus of [[Southern Illinois University Carbondale|Southern Illinois University]] in [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], winner of the 1971 [[All-America City Award]], finalist in the 2009 contest,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.org/aac/2009/2009AACFinalists.html National Civic League]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncl.org/aac/past_winners/past_winners_number.html All-America City: Past Winners]&lt;/ref&gt; and the fastest growing city in Southern Illinois outside the [[Metro-East]], [[Marion, Illinois]]. Both cities are centered in the Carbondale-Marion-Herrin, Illinois Combined Statistical Area, home to 123,272 residents. In the southern reaches of the region [[Alto Pass, Illinois|Alto Pass]] and [[Bald Knob Cross]] are located near the orchards. The large [[Crab Orchard National Wildlife Refuge|Crab Orchard lake]] is the largest in the region. Historic [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]] sits to at the far southern end near the confluence of the [[Ohio River|Ohio]] and [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]] Rivers.

The least populated region, Southeastern Illinois is marked by being within the [[Shawnee Hills]] and the [[Shawnee National Forest]]. The area includes many state parks such as [[Garden of the Gods]]. The historic town of [[Old Shawneetown, Illinois|Shawneetown]] is located on the [[Ohio River]] which is the eastern border of the region. The northern reaches of Southeastern Illinois include the Harrisburg Coal field, which are roughly {{convert|200|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} of abandoned coal mines dating to the turn of the 20th century near [[Harrisburg, Illinois]], the largest city in the Southeastern Illinois area.

==Geography==
Illinois has been partially covered at times by continental ice sheets.  Specifically, Southern Illinois was only partially covered by continental ice sheet during the [[Illinoian (stage)|Illinoian Stage]] and not at all during the [[Last glacial period|Wisconsin Stage]].  Thus, the geography of Southern Illinois is considerably more hilly and rocky than central or northern Illinois.  Areas of Southern Illinois are more similar to [[the Ozarks]] than to central or northern Illinois.

[[File:Garden of the Gods.jpg|thumb|left|[[Garden of the Gods Wilderness|Garden of the Gods]], south of [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]], rests in the [[Shawnee Hills]] and has an elevation of nearly 800 feet 244(m).]]
Additionally, the rich farm land of northern and central Illinois is generally not found in Southern Illinois.  Significant exceptions are the [[American Bottom]] along the Mississippi River and the alluvial soils of the [[Gulf Coastal Plain]] or [[Mississippi River Delta|Delta]], a large region which has its northernmost extent in the two river valleys of Southern Illinois. The [[Mississippi Delta]] reaches north from the Gulf Coast of [[Louisiana]] and ends near Thebes in [[Alexander County, Illinois|Alexander County]]. 

The region's other major river, the [[Ohio River]], winds generally southwest, past [[Shawneetown, Illinois|Shawneetown]], [[Cave-In-Rock, Illinois|Cave-in-Rock]], [[Elizabethtown, Illinois|Elizabethtown]], and [[Golconda, Illinois|Golconda]]. Its waters join the Mississippi at [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]. In ancient times, the Ohio is thought to have flowed a more northerly course through Pope and Pulaski counties. It carved a broad valley there, fit for a major river. But today the underfit Bay Creek and [[Cache River (Illinois)|Cache River]] occupy those valleys.

The hills of Little Egypt can be divided into two areas. The western area, more closely related to the Ozarks of [[Missouri]], is chiefly in southern [[Jackson County, Illinois|Jackson]], [[Union, Illinois|Union]], northern [[Alexander County, Illinois|Alexander]] and [[Johnson County, Illinois|Johnson]] counties. The eastern area, more closely related to the [[Wabash Valley Seismic Zone]], is mostly in northern [[Pope County, Illinois|Pope]], southern [[Saline County, Illinois|Saline]], [[Gallatin County, Illinois|Gallatin]], eastern Johnson and southern [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson]] counties. The [[Shawnee National Forest]] covers a large territory, including seven wilderness areas: [[Garden of the Gods]], [[Bay Creek Wilderness|Bay Creek]], [[Clear Springs Wilderness|Clear Springs]], [[Bald Knob]], [[Burden Falls Wilderness|Burden Falls]], [[Lusk Creek]], and [[Panther Den Wilderness|Panthers Den]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/shawnee/recreation/wilderness/ Shawnee National Forest], U.S. Forest Service&lt;/ref&gt;

Of southern Illinois' rivers, only the Mississippi and the Ohio are navigable for modern commerce. The [[Big Muddy River]], [[Marys River (Illinois)|Marys River]], [[Saline River (Illinois)|Saline River]] and [[Cache River (Illinois)|Cache River]] run their courses in deep southern Illinois. The [[Kaskaskia River]] and [[Wabash River]] are nearby.

===Shawnee National Forest===
More than 270,000 acres (1100&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of [[Shawnee National Forest]] lie to the south of its gateway city [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]]. The Shawnee National Forest offers much to see and do. The national forest has {{convert|1250|mi|km}} of roadways, some {{convert|150|mi|km}} of streams and frequent waterfalls, numerous ponds and lakes as large as 2,700 acres (11&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) (some with swimming beaches), 13 campgrounds, many picnicking sites, and seven wilderness areas where trails are designed for hiking and horseback riding.&lt;ref name=BALANCING &gt;{{cite news | url =http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G1-13687824.html | title =Balancing act on the Shawnee | work =American Forests | date =January 1, 1993 | accessdate =April 8, 2009 | last = Selbert| first = Pamela}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant life is extremely diverse and ranges from sun-loving species to those that grow in dense shade. Tree cover dominates the publicly owned land, and is a significant component on privately owned lands. Oak-hickory is the predominant timber type, however, many other commercially important timber species also occupy significant land. More than 500 wildlife species can be found in the Forest, including 48 mammals, 237 birds, 52 reptiles, 57 amphibians, and 109 species of fish. There are seven federally listed threatened and endangered species that inhabit the Forest, as well as 33 species which are considered regionally sensitive, and 114 Forest-listed species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Shawnee National Forest | work = | publisher =U.S. Forest Service | date = | url =http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/forests/shawnee/ | accessdate =April 8, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Climate===
Southern Illinois lies on the border between [[humid continental climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Dfa'') and [[humid subtropical climate]] ([[Koppen climate classification]] ''Cfa''). The region has neither large mountains nor large bodies of water to moderate its temperature and, thus, it is subject to both cold Arctic air and hot, humid tropical air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and, along with the rest of the midwestern United States, is home to some of the largest temperature extremes in the world. The region has four distinct [[seasons]]. Spring is the wettest season and produces erratic severe weather ranging from [[tornado]]es to [[winter storm]]s. Summers are hot and humid with only occasional and brief respite, and the humidity often makes the [[heat index]] rise to temperatures feeling well above {{convert|100|Â°F|Â°C|abbr=on}}. Fall is mild with lower humidity and can produce intermittent bouts of heavy rainfall with the first [[snow flurry|snow flurries]] usually forming in late November. Winters are cold with periodic snow and temperatures often below freezing, however thaws are usually frequent. Winter storm systems, such as [[Alberta Clipper]]s and [[Panhandle hook]]s, can bring days of heavy [[freezing rain]], [[ice pellets]], and [[snowfall]].

The normal high temperature in July is 90 Â°F (32 Â°C), and the normal low temperature in January is 21 Â°F (â6 Â°C), although this varies from year to year. Both {{convert|100|Â°F|1}} and {{convert|0|Â°F|1}} temperatures can be seen on an average 2 or 3 days per year. The official record low is {{convert|-23|Â°F}} on February 2, 1884 in [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]], and the record high is {{convert|117|Â°F|0}} on July 14, 1954 in [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]].

Southern Illinois experiences [[thunderstorm]]s about 50 days a year on average. Thunderstorms contribute over half of the annual precipitation. Especially in the spring, these storms can often be severe, with high winds, large [[hail]] and tornadoes. Southern Illinois has been affected on more than one occasion by [[Southern Illinois tornado history|particularly damaging tornadoes]].

A period of warm weather late in autumn known as [[Indian summer]] can occur&amp;nbsp;â [[rose]]s will still be in bloom as late as November or early December in some years.

===Seismic zones===
[[Image:New Madrid Erdbeben.jpg|thumb|upright|Contemporary [[woodcut]] of the 1812 New Madrid Earthquake.]]
[[Image:New Madrid and Wabash seizmic zones-USGS.png|thumb|upright|Quakes in the New Madrid and Wabash Valley seismic zones over several decades.]]
Southern Illinois sits upon the verging point of two major fault systems, the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone]] and the [[Wabash Valley Seismic Zone]]. In the 1970s after the 5.5 [[Richter magnitude scale]] [[1968 Illinois earthquake]], scientists realized that there was an unknown fault under Saline County, just north of [[Eldorado, Illinois]]. This fault is called the Cottage Grove Fault, a small tear in the Earth's rock, in the Southern Illinois Basin. Seismographic mapping completed by geologists reveal that [[monocline]]s, [[anticline]]s, and [[syncline]]s are present within the region; these signs suggest deformation during the [[Paleozoic]], coincident to [[Geological fault#Strike-slip faults|strike-slip faulting]] nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2002NC/finalprogram/abstract_31987.htm
|title=Seismic Reflection Investigation of the Cottage Grove Fault System, Southern Illinois Basin|publisher=Geological Society of America|date=2002-04-04|accessdate=2008-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[fault (geology)|fault plane]] solution of the earthquake confirmed two nodal planes both striking north-south and dipping approximately 45 degrees to the east and to the west. This faulting suggests [[Geologic fault#Dip=slip faults|dip slip reverse motion]], and to a horizontal east-west axis of confining stress. Although there are no confirmed faults in the immediate epicentral region, the motion indicated corresponds to that along the [[Wabash Valley Seismic Zone]] roughly {{convert|10|mi|km|sigfig=1}} east of the region, responsible for the [[2008 Illinois earthquake]].&lt;ref name=BSSA&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stauder |first=William |coauthors=Nuttli, Otto W. |year=1970 |month=June |title=Seismic studies: South central Illinois earthquake of November 9, 1968|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Association of America |volume=60 |issue=2 |pages=973â981  |url=http://www.bssaonline.org/cgi/content/abstract/60/3/973 |accessdate=2008-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rupture also occurred partially on the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone|New Madrid Fault]], responsible for the great [[1812 New Madrid earthquake|New Madrid earthquakes]] in 1812, consisting of the most powerful earthquakes to hit the [[contiguous United States]].&lt;ref name=Dispatch&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eas.slu.edu/Earthquake_Center/1968EQ/post.html|title=Quake Damage Minor; Felt Over Wide Area in Midwest and East|publisher=St. Louis Post Dispatch|author=Staff|date=1968-11-09|accessdate=2008-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transportation==
===Passenger rail===
{{See also|Carbondale (Amtrak station)}}
Southern Illinois at one time had an extensive network of railroads. Now only [[Amtrak]], the U.S. passenger rail system, provides service to Carbondale with three trains daily to and from Chicago, and one train daily to and from Memphis and New Orleans.

Saluki Express provides another mass transit options. SIUC students, faculty and staff, as well as the Carbondale community, are encouraged to get on board. This convenient system offers eleven routes operating seven days a week while school is in session, and a &quot;break route&quot; operating while school is not in session.

[[Image:MetroLink map Oct2008.svg|thumb|260px|right]]
The [[St. Louis MetroLink]] is the [[light rail]] transit system in the [[Greater St. Louis]] area of [[Missouri]] and [[Illinois]] connecting the [[Metro-East]] to [[Downtown St. Louis]]. The entire system currently consists of two lines (Red Line and Blue Line) connecting [[Lambert-St. Louis International Airport]] and [[Shrewsbury, Missouri]] with [[Scott Air Force Base]] near [[Shiloh, Illinois]] through downtown [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. The system features 37 stations and carries an average of 61,573 people each weekday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metrostlouis.org/InsideMetro/CAFRs/FY2008ComprehensiveAnnualFinancialReport.pdf |title=Comprehensive Annual Financial Report (FY 2008) |year=2008 |publisher=Metro |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate freeways===
The [[Metro-East]] area near St. Louis has these additional freeways:
* [[File:I-55.svg|20px]] [[I-55]]
* [[File:I-70.svg|20px]] [[I-70]]
* [[File:I-255.svg|20px]] [[I-255]]
* [[File:I-270.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 270 (Illinois-Missouri)|I-270]]

Southern Illinois has 4 major interstate freeways that connect with [[Missouri]], [[Indiana]], and [[Kentucky]]. Depending on the definition of Little Egypt's boundaries, there are four interstates in the region. [[I-57]] is the main north-south freeway through Southern Illinois. It runs through the center of the area. South of Marion is the western terminus of [[I-24]]. It runs southeast, crossing into [[Paducah, Kentucky]] near [[Metropolis, Illinois|Metropolis]].  South of its junction with I-24, I-57 bends to the southwest and crosses into Missouri near Illinois' southernmost point by Cairo. [[I-70]] runs east-west from [[St. Louis]] to central Indiana. [[I-64]] runs east-west from [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] to southern [[Indiana]]. It is cosigned with I-57 for a short stretch at [[Mount Vernon, Illinois|Mt. Vernon]]. I-57 is responsible for much of the growth found around the city of [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]].

===U.S. highways===
*[[U.S. Route 40]]
*[[U.S. Route 45]] runs from the bridge across the Ohio River east of [[Paducah, Kentucky]], and through [[Shawnee National Forest]]. [[Saline County, Illinois]] is its most populated stretch in Southern Illinois, connecting the towns of [[Stonefort, Illinois|Stonefort]], [[Carrier Mills, Illinois|Carrier Mills]], [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]], and [[Eldorado, Illinois|Eldorado]] all within the county. A total population of nearly 25,000 people. The highway continues north through the [[Chicago metropolitan area]] and to the Wisconsin border east of [[Antioch, Illinois]]. With a length of {{convert|428.99|mi|km|2}} in Illinois,&lt;ref name=t2&gt;{{cite web |author=Illinois Technology Transfer Center |url=http://www.dot.state.il.us/gist2/select.html |title=T2 GIS Data |accessdate=2007-11-08 |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. 45 is the longest numbered route in Illinois.
*[[U.S. Route 50]]
*[[U.S. Route 51]]
*[[U.S. Route 66]] (Historical Route Designation)
*[[U.S. Route 67]]
*[[U.S. Route 51]] roughly follows the [[Illinois Central Railroad]] line north-south through the middle of the entire state. Illinois Route 1 runs north-south along the eastern edge of Little Egypt; Illinois Route 3 parallels the Mississippi River along the western edge of the area.

==Historical politics==
Southern Illinois has historically been a conservative Democratic region.  Even as the political parties have changed, Southern Illinois has consistently voted for Democratic candidates more times than not since 1818. Democratic roots in Southern Illinois relate to the region's shared culture with the South, where the Democratic Party before the [[American Civil War]] and after [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] was dominant until the 1960s.  Democratic affiliations were strengthened during the Great Depression and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]'s administration.&lt;ref&gt;http://almostchosenpeople.wordpress.com/2011/03/14/illinois-politics-during-the-civil-war/&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the early months of the Civil War, some residents in [[Williamson County, Illinois|Williamson County]] voted for secession from the Union.  On April 15, 1861 the citizens of [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]] passed a resolution calling for the division of Illinois and the secession of Southern Illinois.  The resolution was soon repealed, but General [[Benjamin Prentiss]] left a company of men near Marion for defense as he passed by on his way to a [[garrison]] in [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]].  Despite some southern sympathizers, most young men in the region joined the Union Army,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptianaaa.org/SI-History2.htm &quot;The Civil War and Late 19th Century&quot;], ''The History of Southern Illinois'', Egyptian Area on Aging, Inc., 1996-2009, accessed 15 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2008}}
There are two main centers of commerce for Southern Illinois.  They consist of the of [[St. Louis, Missouri]] metropolitan area (home to approximately 2.8 million people), and the [[Carbondale, Illinois|Carbondale]], [[Marion, Illinois|Marion]], [[Herrin, Illinois|Herrin]], [[Harrisburg, Illinois|Harrisburg]] area (home to approximately 245,000 people).

The main agricultural products of Southern Illinois are crops such as [[Maize|corn]] and [[soybean]]s. [[Apple]]s, peaches, grapes, are commonly found throughout Southern Illinois as well as the occasional sunflower, cotton, wheat, hay, and milo fields.  In recent years there has been development of [[winery|wineries]] in the [[Shawnee Hills]] region. Additional growth has occurred with the local foods movement as Southern Illinois' climate allows for fruit and vegetable production. Southern Illinois is also the home to aquaculture, beef, swine, equine, sheep, goats, and other livestock production. Agricultural efforts in the region are greatly aided by a small University of Illinois Extension research station near Dixon Springs and extensive research from Southern Illinois University - Carbondale's College of Agricultural Sciences. SIUC is home to the state's only non-land grant research-focused university with an agricultural college which provides practical research to the scientific and agricultural communities both in Southern Illinois as well as the rest of the state and the broader region.

Southern Illinois also has significant [[coal]] deposits; however, since the late 1980s, the coal industry has suffered significant decline due to the decreased demand for high sulfur coal, which causes more pollution.  The collapse of the coal industry has had profound and lasting impact on the region's economy.

The [[Illinois oil basin]] is located mostly in Little Egypt.  During the early 1940s and 1950s, Little Egypt had a modest oil boom in towns such as Carmi, McLeansboro, and Lawrenceville.  Oil production reached more than {{convert|140000000|oilbbl}} per year in the 1940s, but dropped to {{convert|10000000|oilbbl}} per year by 1995.  Oil wells in the region have relatively low yield and produce oil with a high sulfur content, making it expensive to process.  There has been no significant drilling activity in the basin since the late 1970s.

Manufacturing in Southern Illinois is typically clustered in the largest towns of each county, with the people of smaller towns and villages often commuting to work in the factories. Many of these towns have a number of light factories  and other industrial facilities in their [[industrial park]]s.  Products include industrial electronics, minor electrical items, [[automobile]] parts, and packaging materials.  Related services include large-scale printing as well as transportation and distribution of warehoused materials and goods. A high percentage of local jobs are in these light industries.

==Culture==
Culturally, Southern Illinois draws influences from the rest of Illinois but also from neighbouring [[Missouri]] and Upper Southern states like [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].  The immigration route from the east coast ran along the Ohio River, which joined settlements on both sides. In addition, the [[Cumberland River]] flowed northwest through Kentucky and Tennessee before joining the Ohio near [[Paducah, Kentucky]], affording a migration route from the interior of those states. Thus, settlers who came to Southern Illinois were from Virginia, Kentucky, and Tennessee, with most of these being of northern English and Scots-Irish descent, who formed the last major migration from the [[British Isles]] to the colonies before the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], and settled mostly in the backcountry. Some migrated further west into [[Missouri]]. A road between [[Golconda, Illinois|Golconda]] and [[Jonesboro, Illinois|Jonesboro]] carried settlers and commerce across Southern Illinois, as well as the [[Cherokee]] on the [[Trail of Tears]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.illinoishistory.com/trailoftears.html &quot;Trail of Tears&quot;], Illinois History&lt;/ref&gt;

Little Egypt exists at the confluence of the North Midland and South Midland dialects of [[American English]]. South Midland becomes more prominent as one approaches the [[Ohio River]].  The dialect change is not a continuum, but rather occurs in pockets, with certain towns and regions notably favoring one dialect over the other.  This difference can be found between lifelong residents of the same town. No stigma is associated to either dialect within southern Illinois. According to [[David Hackett Fischer]] in his book ''Albion's Seed: Four British Folkways to America'', the dialect of this region is Southern Highland.  It was derived from the linguistics of the people of the Southern Appalachian region. This is consistent with the majority of the early settlers of this region migrating from the Upper South.  The older term for this type of dialect was &quot;Scotch-Irish&quot; speech (the correct term today is Scots-Irish.)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jstor.org/pss/486480&lt;/ref&gt;

===Entertainment and performing arts===
===Tourism===
Southern Illinois has as of late been priding itself in tourism as a rural quaint area. There are many [[state park]]s in the area, benefiting from the scenery of the [[Shawnee National Forest]]. Also Southern Illinois is the oldest part of the state so there are many historical landmarks to be seen in the area, with countless historical markers dotting the counties.&lt;ref name=&quot;southernmostillinois.com&quot;&gt;http://www.southernmostillinois.com/attract.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.waymarking.com/cat/details.aspx?f=1&amp;guid=bbd7a0fa-34ca-4a51-9b9d-084963bbcbab Waymarkers&lt;/ref&gt;
