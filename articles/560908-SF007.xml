'''TightVNC''' is a [[cross-platform]] [[open source]] [[remote desktop software]] application that uses and extends [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]]'s [[RFB protocol]] to control another computer's screen remotely. It was created by Constantin Kaplinsky. His extensions provide for 'tight encoding', which improves performance over low bandwidth connections.&lt;ref&gt;Fedora Project [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TightVNC TightVNC]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;TightVNC: [http://www.tightvnc.org/compare.html Comparison Results]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Encodings==
TightVNC uses so-called &quot;tight encoding&quot; of areas, which is effectively a combination of [[JPEG]] compression and other types of encoding. It is possible to watch videos and play DirectX games through TightVNC over a broadband connection, albeit at a low frame rate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} TightVNC includes many other common features of VNC derivatives, such as file transfer capability.

== Compatibility ==
TightVNC is cross-compatible with other client and server implementations of VNC; however, tight encoding is not supported by most other implementations, so it is necessary to use TightVNC at both ends to gain the full advantage of its enhancements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tightvnc.com/intro.html Introduction to TightVNC]&lt;/ref&gt;

Among notable enhancements are file transfers, support for Windows DFMirage mirror driver to detect screen updates (saves CPU time, DFMirage isn't supported in 2.x versions&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tightvnc.com/download-old.php#addons] TightVNC Recommended Add-ons&lt;/ref&gt;, but really it dramatically increase the performance of TightVnc, at least for tightVNC V 2.0.4), ability to zoom the picture and automatic SSH tunneling on Unix.

The 2.0 beta now supports auto scaling, which resizes the viewer window to the remote users desktop size, regardless of the resolution of the host computer.

==Derived software==
===RemoteVNC===
RemoteVNC [http://sourceforge.net/projects/remotevnc/] is a fork of the TightVNC project and adds automatic traversal of [[Network Address Translation|NAT]] and [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] using [[Jingle (protocol)|Jingle]].

===TightVNC Portable Edition===
The developers have also produced a [[Portable application|portable]] version of the software,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tightvnc.com/portable/ TightVNC Portable Edition]&lt;/ref&gt; available as both [[U3]] and standalone downloads. However this is a licensed product, and after 30 days use a license must be purchased.

===TurboVNC===
[[VirtualGL#TurboVNC|TurboVNC]] is based on the TightVNC 1.3.x code base and includes numerous performance enhancements and features targeted at 3D and video workloads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtualgl.org/vgldoc/0_6final/ User's Guide for TurboVNC 0.6]&lt;/ref&gt;
