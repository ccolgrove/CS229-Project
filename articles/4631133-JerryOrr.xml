An '''overtime ban''' is a form of [[industrial action]] where [[employee]]s limit their [[working time]] to the hours specified in their [[Employment contract|contracts]], refusing to work any [[overtime]].  Overtime bans are less disruptive than [[strike action]], and since there is no breach of contract by the employees there is less chance of disciplinary action by the employer than there is with strikes.  However, an overtime ban can have a significant impact on industries which normally operate outside of regular office hours, such as [[emergency services]], [[public transport]], or [[retail]].

An overtime ban is similar to a [[work-to-rule]], in that both involve employees refusing to do more than is strictly required of them.  However, and in contrast with a work-to-rule, when an overtime ban is in place workers may still perform duties not required of them, providing they do not go outside their contracted hours.
