The team's captain was [[Horace Greely Prettyman]],&lt;ref name=team/&gt; from [[Bryan, Ohio]].&lt;ref name=Roster&gt;{{cite web|title=1886 Michigan Football Team Roster|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://141.211.39.65/allroster/FMPro?-DB=allrost.fp5&amp;-Format=fbresult.htm&amp;-SortField=name&amp;-SortOrder=Ascend&amp;year=1886&amp;-max=170&amp;-Find}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Prettyman played eight years for the Michigan football team and was captain of the Michigan team three straight years from 1884 to 1886.&lt;ref name=team/&gt;&lt;ref name=team1884&gt;{{cite web|title=1884 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1884fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=team1885&gt;{{cite web|title=1885 Football Team|publisher=University of Michigan, Bentley Historical Library|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbteam/1885fbt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No other player in the history of Michigan football has been selected as captain three times.&lt;ref name=Madej&gt;{{cite book|author=Madej, Bruce|title=Michigan: Champions of the West|publisher=Sport Publishing|date=1997|isbn=1-57167-115-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of Michigan Football Team Captains|publisher=University of Michigan|url=http://bentley.umich.edu/athdept/football/fbcapt/fbcapt.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Prettyman's three years as captain, Michigan never lost a game, winning seven games and outscoring opponents 192 to 10.&lt;ref name=team/&gt;&lt;ref name=team1884/&gt;&lt;ref name=team1885/&gt;

==Game notes==
===Game one: Michigan 50, Albion 0===
The first game was played on October 16, 1886, at Albion, with Michigan winning by a score of 50â0.&lt;ref name=team/&gt; ''[[The Michigan Argonaut]]'' described the game as &quot;a walk-over for our team.&quot;&lt;ref name=Argo/&gt; The score was already 37 to 0 when time was called for the half, and the ''Argonaut'' singled out Wright, Prettyman and Frank Higgins for their fine play. The writer noted that the Albion team was &quot;not in fine trim&quot; and failed to get the ball near the Michigan goal.&lt;ref name=Argo/&gt;  Perhaps trying to find something favorable to say about the opponent, the ''Argonaut'' reporter observed that &quot;the Albion team did their best work in tackling.&quot;&lt;ref name=Argo&gt;{{cite news|title=Rugby at Albion|publisher=''[[The Michigan Argonaut]]''|date=October 23, 1886}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Game two: Michigan 24, Albion 0===
[[File:John Duffy.jpg|left|thumb|170px|Team manager and goalkeeper John Duffy.]]
The second game was played at the [[Ann Arbor Fairgrounds]] on October 30, 1886, as part of a &quot;field day&quot; that included various athletic events.  Michigan won the football game against Albion 24 to 0.&lt;ref name=team/&gt; The ''Michigan Argonaut'' noted, &quot;The most striking difference between the elevens was that of weight, U. of M. presenting a much heavier team. It was evident, however, that Albion had come to play ball, and what they lacked in avoirdupois was in great measure made up by neat and rapid playing.&quot;&lt;ref name=argo2/&gt; The teams agreed to play &quot;two innings of thirty minutes each,&quot; and the &quot;rugby game&quot; started at 3:35 with referee George W. Whyte calling, &quot;Play.&quot;&lt;ref name=argo2/&gt; Michigan lost the toss, and Jaycox kicked off for Michigan, sending the ball near Albion's goal line. Michigan scored its first touchdown seven minutes into the game to take the lead 6 to 0.&lt;ref name=argo2/&gt; Jaycox and [[James E. Duffy (American football)|Jim Duffy]] made several fine runs, and &quot;Prettyman's play was characterized by his usual heavy rushing.&quot;&lt;ref name=argo2/&gt; Michigan scored a second touchdown &quot;just before the inning was called,&quot; and led 12 to 0 at the intermission. The second inning began at 4:40 p.m., and the ''Argonaut'' reported that &quot;Albion played a much better game in this inning that did Michigan, and several times it looked as though they would score.&quot;&lt;ref name=argo2/&gt; Jaycox and Jim Duffy made several bad fumbles in the second inning, and Morrow, &quot;who had been serving in first-class style one-fourth back, made several poor throws to the half backs and lost ground for Michigan.&quot; Jim Duffy made two brilliant runs in the inning, and Jaycox ran for a touchdown shortly before the game ended.&lt;ref name=argo2/&gt; Albion objected that the field was &quot;overrun with spectators,&quot; and also claimed that Jaycox had run out of bounds on his touchdown run, but the claim was overruled. The ''Argonaut'' concluded its report on the game by noting, &quot;The Albion boys were gentlemen, and played a square game.&quot;&lt;ref name=argo2&gt;{{cite news|title=Rugby Game|publisher=''The Michigan Argonaut''|date=1886-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
