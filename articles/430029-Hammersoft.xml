==History==
===1841&amp;ndash;1900===
[[File:College 1846.jpg|thumb|left|St. John's College, 1846.]]
Fordham University was originally founded as St. John's College in 1841 by the [[Ireland|Irish]]-born [[coadjutor bishop]] (later [[archbishop]]) of the Diocese of New York, the Most Reverend [[John Hughes (archbishop)|John Joseph Hughes]]. The college was the first Catholic institution of [[higher education]] in the [[northeastern United States]]. [[Bishop]] Hughes purchased most of Rose Hill Manor and Estate in [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]], the Bronx, at a little less than $30,000 for the purpose of establishing [[St. Joseph's Seminary, Dunwoodie|St. Joseph's Seminary]] in September 1840. &quot;Rose Hill&quot; was the name originally given to the site in 1787 by its owner, [[Robert Watts]], a wealthy New York merchant, in honor of his family's ancestral home in [[Scotland]]. The seminary was paired with St. John's College, which opened at Rose Hill with a student body of six on June 21, 1841. The Reverend [[John McCloskey]] (later Archbishop of New York and eventually the first American [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]) was its first president, and the [[faculty (teaching staff)|faculty]] were [[Secular clergy|secular priests]] and [[Laity|lay]] instructors.  The college went through a succession of four [[diocesan priest]]s in five years as presidents, including [[James Roosevelt Bayley|Fr. James Roosevelt Bayley]], a distant cousin of [[Theodore Roosevelt|Theodore]] and [[Franklin Roosevelt]] and nephew of [[Saint Elizabeth Seton|St. Elizabeth Seton]]. In 1845, the seminary church, Our Lady of Mercy, was built. The same year, Bishop Hughes convinced [[Jesuits]] from St. Mary's College in [[Maryland]] and [[St. Mary's College (Kentucky)|St. Mary's College]] in [[Kentucky]] to staff the new school.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;Schroth, SJ, Raymond. ''Fordham: A History and Memoir''. Revised ed. New York: Fordham UP, 2008. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, St. John's College received its [[charter]] from the [[New York Legislature|New York state legislature]], and about three months later, the first Jesuits began to arrive.  Bishop Hughes deeded the college over but retained title to the seminary property of about nine acres. In 1847, Fordham's first school in [[Manhattan]] opened. The school became the independently chartered College of St. Francis Xavier in 1861. It was also in 1847 that the American poet [[Edgar Allan Poe]] arrived in the village of Fordham and began a friendship with the Jesuits that would last throughout his lifetime.  In 1849, he published &quot;[[The Bells]],&quot; to which some traditions credit the college's church bells as the inspiration.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Collins Before Ren.jpg|thumb|right|Collins Auditorium before renovation.]]
The college's early curriculum consisted of a junior division (i.e. the [[University-preparatory school|prep school]]), requiring four years of study in Latin, Greek, grammar, literature, history, geography, mathematics, and religion, and a senior division (i.e. the college), requiring three years study in &quot;poetry&quot; ([[humanities]]), rhetoric, and philosophy.  Colonel [[Robert Gould Shaw]], famed commander of the all-[[Black (race)|Black]] [[54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry]] American Civil War regiment, attended the junior division.  An ''[[Artium Baccalaureus]]'' degree was earned for completion of both curricula, and an additional year of philosophy would earn a ''[[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Magister Artium]]'' degree. There was also a &quot;commercial&quot; track similar to a modern college of [[business]], which was an alternative to the [[Classical education movement|Classical]], Latin-based curriculum and resulted in a certificate instead of a degree. In 1855, the first student stage production, [[Henry IV, Part 1|''Henry IV'']], was presented.  The seminary was closed in 1859, and the property was sold to the Jesuits in 1860 for $40,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

A [[Act of Congress|Congressional act]] creating instruction in military science and tactics at the college level resulted in St. John's College bringing a cadet [[corps]] to the campus. From 1885-1890, a veteran of the [[7th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|7th U.S. Cavalry]], Lt. Herbert C. Squires, built a cadet battalion to a strength of 200, which would provide the foundation for the modern [[ROTC]] unit at Fordham. The college built a science building in 1886, lending more legitimacy to science in the curriculum.  In addition, a three-year Bachelor of Science degree was created. In 1897, [[academic regalia]] for students at [[Graduation|Commencement]] was first adopted. The process of consolidating the [[Westchester, New York|Westchester]] towns that eventually comprised the borough of the Bronx began in 1874, bringing St. John's College within the official limits of New York City.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

===1901&amp;ndash;1950===
[[File:Admin 1930s.jpg|thumb|left|The Administration Building, c. 1935.]]
With the addition of a law school and medical school in 1905, St. John's College became Fordham University in 1907. The name ''Fordham'' (&quot;[[ford (crossing)|ford]] by the [[hamlet (place)|hamlet]]&quot;) refers to the [[Fordham, Bronx|Fordham]] neighborhood of [[the Bronx]] in which the Rose Hill campus is located. This neighborhood was named either as a reference to its location near a shallow crossing of the [[Bronx River]] or as a reference to Rev. John Fordham, an [[Anglican]] priest.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

In 1908, [[Fordham University Press]] was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

In 1912, the University opened the College of Pharmacy, which offered a three-year program in [[pharmacy]] and did not require its students to obtain bachelor's degrees until the late 1930s. The college had a mainly Jewish student body, and in recognition of that, students were exempt from the then-required course in Catholic theology. The school's longtime dean, Jacob Diner, was also Jewish.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

The College of St. Francis Xavier was closed in 1913, and various Fordham colleges were opened at the [[Woolworth Building]] in Manhattan to fill the void. They were later moved to 302 [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

The University closed its medical school in 1919, citing a lack of endowment for the school and reduced University funds overall due to the First World War.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

The Gabelli School of Business began in 1920 in Manhattan as the School of Accounting.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;  

In 1944, the School of Professional and Continuing Studies was established.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

===1951&amp;ndash;2000===
[[File:Lowenstein 1965.jpg|thumb|right|The Leon Lowenstein Building following completion.]]
In 1961, the Lincoln Center campus opened as part of the [[Lincoln Square, New York|Lincoln Square]] Renewal Project. The campus originally housed only [[Fordham Law School]], but the colleges at 302 Broadway were moved to the campus in 1969. At the Rose Hill campus, the all-female Thomas More College began instruction in 1964.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

In 1967, Bensalem College, an experimental college with no set curriculum or requirements and no grades, was created by University President Leo McLaughlin, S.J.  It was conceived of and led by poet Elizabeth Sewell. The college was studied by a wide array of educators and reported on by such large-circulation publications of the day as ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'', ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'', and the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review]]''.  The school closed in 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

In 1969, the [[board of trustees]] was reorganized to include a majority of non-[[clergy]] members, which officially made the University an independent institution.  The College of Pharmacy closed due to declining enrollment in 1972. Fordham College at Rose Hill merged with Thomas More College in 1974, becoming [[coeducational]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

In 1993, a twenty-story [[residence hall]] was added to the Lincoln Center campus to house 850 graduate and undergraduate students. In 1996, the undergraduate college at Lincoln Center changed its name to &quot;Fordham College at Lincoln Center,&quot; having been called &quot;The Liberal Arts College&quot; and subsequently &quot;The College at Lincoln Center&quot; since its creation in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;

===2001&amp;ndash;present===
[[File:Assumption-hall.jpg|thumb|left|Assumption Hall, Marymount College.]]
[[Marymount College, Tarrytown|Marymount College]], an independent [[women's college]] founded by the [[Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary]] (R.S.H.M.) in 1907, was consolidated into Fordham University in July 2002. The college had been steeped in financial hardship since the 1970s.  Located {{convert|25|mi|km|0}} north of New York City in Tarrytown, New York, the school remained open, and its campus received a branch of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies as well as extensions of the Graduate Schools of Education, Social Service, and Business Administration.

In 2005, Fordham announced that Marymount would be phased out; it awarded degrees to its final undergraduate class in May 2007. University administrators announced that the campus would remain open for Fordham graduate programs in several disciplines.

In the autumn of 2007, however, the University announced its intention to seek buyers for the Marymount campus. Administrators stated that the expenses required to support the programs on the campus far exceeded their demand. University officials estimated that the revenue gained from the proposed sale would not be greater than the expenses Fordham incurred maintaining and improving the campus since its merger with Marymount. President Father McShane nonetheless stated that the University's decision was a &quot;painful&quot; one. Fordham then announced its intention to move the remaining programs from the Marymount campus to a new location in [[Harrison, New York]] by the autumn of 2008. On February 17, 2008, Fordham announced the sale of the campus for $27 million to [[EF Education|EF Schools]], a chain of private language-instruction schools.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marymount&quot;&gt;http://chronicle.com/article/Fordham-U-Sells-Marymount/40481&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Fordham announced the creation of the Toward 2016 Integrated Strategic Plan, to be implemented by the University's sesquicentennial in 2016. The $500-million plan aims to enhance the University's profile, increase research among faculty members, make capital improvements to both the Rose Hill and Lincoln Center campuses, increase the competitiveness of varsity athletic programs, and enlarge the University's endowment, among other things.&lt;ref name=&quot;Progress Report&quot;&gt;Strategic Plan Review Committee. ''Progress Report on Integrated Strategic Plan &quot;Toward 2016&quot;'' Rep. Fordham University, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2010, Fordham is expected to meet almost all of the plan's objectives on time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Progress Report&quot;/&gt;

In 2009, Fordham was approached by [[New York Medical College]] about a possible merger of the two schools. The University declined the offer due to NYMC's financial difficulties, a decision that has sparked controversy among administrators, students, and alumni.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYMC&quot;&gt;http://fordhamfans.smfforfree.com/index.php?topic=320.0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Fordham University's academic ideals are drawn from its Jesuit influences. The University promotes the Jesuit principles of ''[[cura personalis]]'', which fosters a faculty and administrative respect for the individual student and his or her uniqueness; ''[[magis]]'', which encourages students to strive for excellence in all aspects of life, not simply the academic; and &quot;men and women for others,&quot; which intends to inspire service among members of the Fordham community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jesuit Tradition&quot;/&gt;

===Core Curriculum===
[[File:togninohall.jpg|thumb|right|150 px|Tognino Hall, a common guest lecture venue.]]
All undergraduates at Fordham are required to complete the [[Core Curriculum]], a distribution of 17â20 courses (depending on foreign language proficiency) in nine disciplines. Based on the curriculum established by the [[Society of Jesus]] in the sixteenth century, the Core is shared by Jesuit schools all over the world and is intended to provide a sound [[liberal arts]] education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ratio&quot;&gt;http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12654a.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It is distributed as follows:

*One course in English [[Composition studies|composition/rhetoric]] and two in [[literature]]
*Two courses each in [[philosophy]] and [[theology]]
*Two courses each in [[history]], [[social science]], and [[natural science]]
*One course each in [[mathematics]] and [[fine arts]]
*[[Foreign language]] through an advanced level (1 to 4 courses)
*A senior seminar in [[values]]

Most of these requirements can be fulfilled by a wide array of courses. In addition to these requirements, there are several distributive requirements that can be met in tandem with the requirements above. A student is expected to complete most of the Core by the end of his or her sophomore year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Core&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_r/academics/core_curriculum/&lt;/ref&gt; Students pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree take a modified version of the Core.&lt;ref name=&quot;Business Core&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/college_of_business_/academics/curriculum/arts_sciences/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Libraries===
[[File:duanelib.jpg|thumb|right|Duane Library.]]
The Fordham University Library System contains over 2.4 million volumes, subscribes to over 50,000 serials and electronic journals, and is a depository for [[United States Government]] documents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Library Gen&quot;&gt;http://www.library.fordham.edu/information/about.html&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the Interlibrary Loan office provides students and faculty with virtually unlimited access to the over 20 million volumes in the New York Public Library System as well as access to media from libraries around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;ILLiad&quot;&gt;http://www.library.fordham.edu/services/illservices.html&lt;/ref&gt; The system consists of the [[Walsh Family Library|William D. Walsh Family Library]], ranked in 2004 as the fifth best collegiate library in the country,&lt;ref name=&quot;Princeton Lib&quot;&gt;Franek, Robert, and Princeton Review. ''The Best 351 Colleges''. 2004 ed. Princeton Review, 2003. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Science Library at the Rose Hill campus, the Gerald M. Quinn and the Leo T. Kissam Memorial Law Libraries at the Lincoln Center campus, and the Reading Room at the Westchester campus. In addition to the University's formal library system, several academic departments and research institutes maintain their own collections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Medieval&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/mvst/&lt;/ref&gt; The Rose Hill campus's Duane Library, despite its name, is no longer a library, though it still contains reading and study space for students.

===Research===
The [[Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching|Carnegie Foundation]] classifies Fordham as a high-research doctoral university (RU/H),&lt;ref name=&quot;Carnegie&quot;/&gt; with approximately $7 million in research expenditures in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wat Month&quot;&gt;http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2011/national_university_rank.php&lt;/ref&gt; Major facilities on campus for scientific research include the Louis Calder Center, a biological field station in [[Armonk]], NY, and the William Spain Seismic Observatory. In addition, Fordham collaborates with several institutions in New York City and around the world, such as the [[New York Botanical Garden]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYBG&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1133.asp&lt;/ref&gt; the [[American Museum of Natural History]],&lt;ref name=&quot;AMNH&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/biological_sciences/faculty/j_alan_clark_28346.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and the Albert Einstein College of Medicine,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pre-Med&quot;/&gt; for the purposes of conducting research.

The Fordham Museum of Greek, Etruscan, and Roman Art is located at the Rose Hill campus and contains more than 200 artifacts from Classical antiquity. A gift from alumnus William D. Walsh, it is the largest collection of its kind in the [[New York metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Museum&quot;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/06/arts/design/06muse.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the University maintains a sizable collection of medieval manuscripts and other rare literary works in the O'Hare Special Collections Room at the Walsh Family Library.

[[Fordham University Press]], an affiliate of [[Oxford University Press]], is the University's official publishing house.&lt;ref name=&quot;OUP&quot;&gt;http://aboutupso.com/2011/03/10/oxford-university-press-announces-the-launch-of-fordham-scholarship-online/&lt;/ref&gt; It publishes primarily in philosophy and theology, the humanities, and the social sciences.

===Honor societies and programs===
Fordham's undergraduate schools all offer honors programs for their students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;&gt;''Undergraduate Bulletin 2010-2012''. Fordham University, 2009.

==Campuses==
Fordham University has three main campuses in and around New York City: Rose Hill in the Bronx, Lincoln Center in Manhattan, and Westchester in West Harrison. In addition, it maintains facilities throughout New York State and around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham Facts&quot;/&gt;

===Rose Hill===
[[File:queenscourt.jpg|thumb|right|Queen's Court Residential College with St. John's Quadrangle in the foreground.]]
The Rose Hill campus, established in 1841, is home to Fordham College at Rose Hill, the Gabelli School of Business, and a division of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, as well as the Graduate School of Arts and Sciences and the Graduate School of Religion and Religious Education. Situated on 85 acres (340,000 m2) in North Bronx,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham Facts&quot;/&gt; the campus is among the largest privately owned green spaces in New York City. It is located next to the New York Botanical Garden and the Bronx Zoo, with which Fordham is affiliated,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYBG&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Zoo&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_856.asp&lt;/ref&gt; and the Belmont neighborhood of the Bronx, also known as the &quot;Real Little Italy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Little Italy&quot;&gt;http://www.arthuravenuebronx.com/&lt;/ref&gt; Rose Hill's [[Collegiate Gothic]] architecture, expansive lawns, ivy-covered buildings, and cobblestone streets were featured in MSNBC's 2008 edition of America's Prettiest College Campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;&gt;http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26658838/ns/travel-destination_travel/t/pretty-college-campuses/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the campus has been the setting of a number of films throughout the years.

Rose Hill is home to the University Church, which was built in 1845 as a seminary chapel and parish church for the surrounding community. The Gothic-style church is an official New York City landmark; it contains the original altar from the old [[St. Patrick's Old Cathedral|St. Patrick's Cathedral]] and stained glass windows intended for the cathedral from King [[Louis-Philippe of France]]. The windows are also notable for their connection to a workshop in SÃ¨vres, France, where the earliest stages of the [[Gothic Revival]] took place.&lt;ref name=&quot;Church&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/medny/venturi.html&lt;/ref&gt; There are 10 residence halls on campus, including four [[residential colleges]] and six Integrated Learning Communities for such disciplines as science, business, and leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;Housing&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/student_affairs/residential_life/rose_hill/&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the campus contains three Jesuit residences; Murray-Weigel Hall, the infirmary for the New York Province of the Society of Jesus; and Ciszek Hall, one of only three Jesuit [[scholastic]] residences in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ciszek&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/ciszek/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The William Spain Seismic Observatory, located at Rose Hill, was the first seismic station in the United States to record ground waves from the atomic bombings in Hiroshima and Nagasaki. It is part of a national network of seismic stations that report data to the U.S. Geological Survey in Boulder, Colorado.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seismic&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/audience/tours/rh_map/38_Seismic_Station.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:fordhamchurch.jpg|thumb|left|The University Church.]]
The campus is served by the [[Fordham (Metro-North station)|Fordham station]] of the [[Metro-North Railroad]] (the tracks run along the boundary fence), which ends at [[Grand Central Terminal]] in Manhattan. Public transit buses stop adjacent to campus exits, and New York City Subway stations are within walking distance. The University also provides a shuttle service between the three main campuses, which is known as the &quot;Ram Van.&quot; About 7,000 undergraduates and graduates take classes at Rose Hill.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham Facts&quot;/&gt;

As part of the Toward 2016 Integrated Strategic Plan, Fordham recently added two new residence halls to the Rose Hill campus. In addition, it is currently working on renovations to the Gabelli School of Business, and it intends to add a new student union, recreation center, and science building to Rose Hill in the coming years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Progress Report&quot;/&gt;

Located near the Rose Hill campus is the Riverdale neighborhood of the Bronx, noted for the large number of Fordham faculty and staff who live there.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham&quot;&gt;www.fordham.edu&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lincoln Center===
[[File:Fisherman-Fordham.jpg|thumb|right|The ''Peter, Fisher of Men'' statue.]]
The Lincoln Center campus, created as part of the Lincoln Square Renewal Project in 1961, is home to Fordham College at Lincoln Center and a division of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies, as well as the [[Fordham University School of Law|School of Law]], the [[Fordham Graduate School of Business|Graduate School of Business Administration]], the Graduate School of Education, and the Graduate School of Social Service. The {{convert|8|acre|m2|adj=on}} campus occupies the area from West 60th Street to West 62nd Street between [[Columbus Avenue (Manhattan)|Columbus]] and [[Amsterdam Avenue|Amsterdam]] Avenues,&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham Facts&quot;/&gt; placing it in the cultural heart of Manhattan. Across the street from the campus is one of the world's great cultural centers, [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]; nearby are [[Central Park]], [[Carnegie Hall]], [[Rockefeller Center]] and [[Radio City Music Hall]], [[Fifth Avenue]], [[Broadway (New York City)|Broadway]], and [[Columbus Circle]]. The campus is served by public transit buses; the A,B,C,D, and 1 trains of the New York City Subway; and the University's &quot;Ram Van&quot; shuttle.

Approximately 8,000 undergraduate and graduate students take classes at the Lincoln Center campus, of which about 1000 live in University housing either on campus or in Midtown, Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham Facts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Grad Housing&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/Student_Affairs/Residential_Life/Lincoln_Center/Our_Residential_Offe/Graduate_Housing/&lt;/ref&gt; The campus currently consists of the Leon Lowenstein Building, McMahon Hall, the Gerald M. Quinn Library, and the Doyle Building and has two outdoor basketball and tennis courts.

The Lincoln Center campus has two grassy plazas, built one level up from the street over the Quinn Library. The larger plaza was once a barren cement landscape known as &quot;Robert Moses Plaza;&quot; the smaller plaza is known as &quot;St. Peter's Garden.&quot; A memorial to Fordham students and alumni who died in the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]] stands in St. Peter's Garden.

The Toward 2016 Strategic Plan calls for the complete reconfiguration of the Lincoln Center campus in order to make room for a new Law School building, designed by the noted architectural firm Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners,&lt;ref name=&quot;Pei&quot;&gt;http://www.pcf-p.com/a/p/0712/s.html&lt;/ref&gt; as well as additional residence halls, classrooms, and offices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Progress Report&quot;/&gt; Ground was broken on the project at the beginning of the Spring 2011 academic semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;Groundbreaking&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/inside_fordham/february_14_2011/news/groundbreaking_begin_78199.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Westchester===
The Westchester campus is home to divisions of the School of Professional and Continuing Studies and the Graduate Schools of Business, Education, and Social Service. It consists of a three-story, {{convert|62500|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building on {{convert|32|acre|m2}} landscaped with a stream and pond. Fordham signed a 20-year lease for the facility, which includes 26 &quot;smart&quot; classrooms, faculty and administrative offices, a reading room, a food service facility, and indoor and outdoor meeting areas. In 2008, the University spent over $8 million renovating the building to increase its sustainability.&lt;ref name=&quot;Westchester&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/westchester/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The campus is served by the [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains station]] of the [[Metro-North Railroad]], approximately {{convert|4|mi|km|0}} away in [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]. The White Plains station and the campus are both served by the Westchester County Bus System (&quot;[[Bee-Line Bus System|The Bee-Line]]&quot;). The University's &quot;Ram Van&quot; shuttle also stops on campus.

===Other facilities===
Fordham maintains a biological field station {{convert|30|mi|km|-1}} north of New York City in Armonk, NY. The [[Louis Calder Center]] consists of {{convert|114|acre|km2}} forested, a {{convert|10|acre|m2|sing=on}} lake, and 19 buildings, which house laboratories and offices, educational programs, equipment storage, a research library, and residences. The station is the middle site along a {{convert|130|km|mi|sing=on}} urban-forest transect, the Urban-Rural Gradient Experiment (URGE), and supports the longest running ecological field study of Lyme Disease in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Calder&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/Academics/Office_of_Research/Research_Centers__In/The_Louis_Calder_Cen/&lt;/ref&gt;

The Fordham University London Centre is located on the campus of [[Heythrop College]], the Jesuit philosophy and theology school of the University of London. It is home to several undergraduate business and liberal arts programs as well as Fordham College at Lincoln Center's London Dramatic Academy.&lt;ref name=&quot;London Centre&quot;/&gt;

Several of Fordham's graduate schools maintain satellite facilities for easy access by commuting students and faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;GSRRE&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/graduate__profession/graduate_school_of_r/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Town and gown relations===
Relations between Fordham and the neighborhoods that surround it vary according to campus. At Rose Hill, the University actively recruits students from disadvantaged backgrounds through the Higher Education Opportunity Program.&lt;ref name=&quot;HEOP&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/special_programs/heop/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, about 80% of students participate in community service.&lt;ref name=&quot;RHS Handbook&quot;&gt;''Rose Hill Society Ambassador Handbook''. Fordham University, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The surrounding neighborhood seems to respond positively to these initiatives.

The relationship between the Lincoln Center campus and the Upper West Side, however, is significantly cooler. Recently, the New York State Supreme Court dismissed a lawsuit against Fordham brought by the Alfred Condominium Complex. The suit was filed in response to the Universityâs expansion plans at Lincoln Center and their expected visual and auditory impact on the surrounding community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alfred&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/eNewsroom/topstories_1924.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student activities==
Fordham University sponsors over 135 clubs and organizations for its undergraduate and graduate students, some of which are described below:&lt;ref name=&quot;OSL&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/student_affairs/student_leadership__/index.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Athletics===
{{Main|Fordham Rams}}
[[File:rosehillgym5.jpg|thumb|left|The Rose Hill Gymnasium.]]
The University supports 23 men's and women's varsity teams and various club teams and has an extensive [[intramural]] sports program. Fordham athletic teams are known as the &quot;[[Bighorn sheep|Rams]],&quot; and their colors are [[Maroon (color)|maroon]] and white. The Fordham Rams compete in the [[NCAA Division I]] [[Atlantic 10 Conference]] in most sports. A notable exception is [[college football|football]], in which they are an associate member of the [[Patriot League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Fordham Facts&quot;/&gt;

The Rams football program boasts a National Championship title (1929), two bowl game appearances (1941 and 1942), two divisional championships (2002 and 2007), two FCS playoff appearances (2002 and 2007), and the 15th most wins of all college football programs. It is probably most known, however, for the &quot;[[Seven Blocks of Granite]],&quot; a name given to the team's 1928 and 1936 offensive lines. The 1936 team was coached by &quot;Sleepy&quot; Jim Crowley, one of the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s legendary &quot;Four Horsemen,&quot; and included [[Vince Lombardi]], arguably the most famous professional football coach in history. This team is credited with inspiring the term &quot;[[Ivy League]]&quot; after ''[[New York Tribune]]'' sportswriter Caswell Adams compared it to the [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and [[Columbia University]] football teams, two powerhouses of the day. Adams remarked disparagingly of Princeton and Columbia, saying that they were &quot;only Ivy League.&quot; There are currently four Rams in the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Athletics&quot;&gt;http://www.fordhamsports.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/072711aab.html&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[St. Louis Rams]] NFL franchise was named in honor of Fordham's football heritage.&lt;ref name=&quot;St. Louis&quot;&gt;http://www.stlouisrams.com/team/history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Fordham's men's basketball program also has an impressive heritage, boasting four NCAA tournament and 16 NIT appearances. During the 1970 season, the team was coached by [[Digger Phelps]], who subsequently rose to national prominence as the head coach of the [[University of Notre Dame]]'s men's basketball program. Fordham basketball plays in the [[Rose Hill Gymnasium]] (also known as &quot;the Prairie&quot;), the oldest on-campus venue currently in use by an NCAA Division I basketball team. The team has fared poorly of late, with just two wins in the 2009 season, but it defeated St. John's University and the University of Massachusetts along with five other teams this past season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Athletics&quot;/&gt;

The Rams have had great success in other sports as well. They have launched the careers of dozens of [[major league baseball|professional baseball]] players, including [[National Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] inductee [[Frankie Frisch]] (also known as &quot;The Fordham Flash&quot;). They also claim among their ranks [[Tom Courtney]], an Olympic gold medalist in the 800m and a member of Fordham's world record-setting two-mile relay team. Fordham Crew has won several national championships during its almost 100 years in existence. Rowing out of the Peter Jay Sharp boathouse on the Harlem River, it makes regular appearances at such prestigious regattas as the Henley Royal Regatta in the United Kingdom and the San Diego Crew Classic. The Fordham sailing team, headquartered at the Morris Yacht and Beach Club on City Island, and the Fordham golf team, which plays out of the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck, NY, also have notable successes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Athletics&quot;/&gt;

Most of Fordham's athletic programs are housed at the Rose Hill campus; however, some maintain additional facilities elsewhere, including, in addition to those previously mentioned, the hockey, tennis, and track and field teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Athletics&quot;/&gt;

The '''Fordham Debate Society (FDS)''' is based at the Rose Hill campus and is the oldest existing club at the University, having been founded in 1854.&lt;ref name=&quot;Debate&quot;&gt;http://www.nytimes.com/2002/05/05/nyregion/neighborhood-report-fordham-fordham-debate-team-from-patsy-to-powerhouse.html&lt;/ref&gt; The club competes in the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association]] (APDA), which was founded at Fordham's annual tournament in 1982. FDS regularly places among the top teams in the country, and it ranks well in the [[World Universities Debating Championship]] standings. The club hosts several tournaments throughout the year, including the Fordham Fandango tournament and a tournament for novice debaters in New York City. Additional competitions, such as an Intervarsity Tournament in the [[British Parliamentary Style|British Parliamentary]] style, a public policy forum for high school students, and a round robin for students at Fordham, are in the works. The club holds practice debates and chamber discussions on Monday and Thursday nights, in which anyone at Fordham can participate.

===Campus Ministry===
[[File:bluechapel19.jpg|thumb|right|The Blue Chapel.]]
The purpose of Campus Ministry at Fordham is to provide âopportunities and resources for spiritual growth to members of [the University] community.â It currently offers programming for more than 15 faith traditions in such areas as worship, music ministry, and social ministry. One of its most popular initiatives is its retreats, which are held at Fordham's McGrath House of Prayer in Goshen, NY and other retreat houses in the Greater New York area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus Ministry&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/mission/mission_and_ministry/campus_ministry/&lt;/ref&gt; 

Global Outreach! (Â¡GO!) is a student-run organization that leads service projects to various locations around the country and the world, with the goal of promoting social justice and fostering a sense of individual responsibility among the student body. Â¡GO! currently sponsors 27 annual projects over the winter, spring, and summer breaks that deal with such issues as HIV/AIDS, affordable housing, migrant labor, and environmental justice.&lt;ref name=&quot;GO&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/mission/mission_and_ministry/global_outreach/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Military education===
The Fordham Military Science program is available to all undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of their chosen course of study.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROTC Rank&quot;&gt;http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/rotc_nyc_boycott_1G1btBhCWGVhQWKaarJWGJ#ixzz1OheDBuf1&lt;/ref&gt; It is also available to students at over 50 other New York area colleges and universities. The program consists of membership and training in the Ram Battalion of the Army [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] (ROTC) and a sequence of military science classes taught on campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROTC&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/special_programs/army_rotc_ram_battal/&lt;/ref&gt; Participants in the program are also eligible to enroll in the [[Air Force ROTC]] program at [[Manhattan College]] and the [[Navy ROTC]] program at [[State University of New York Maritime College|SUNY Maritime College]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ROTC&quot;/&gt; In 2011, Fordham Military Science began offering a combat nursing program in conjunction with [[Regis University]] and the [[University of Colorado at Denver]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Nursing&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/special_programs/army_rotc_ram_battal/army_rotc_scholarshi/nursing_scholarships_29947.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

The Military Science program has several notable alumni, including former [[Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]], four-star General John M. Keane, and at least four recipients of the [[Medal of Honor]]. The program has been distinguished as being in the top fifteen percent of military science programs in the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROTC&quot;/&gt;

In addition to the Military Science program, Fordham contributes to military education through the FordhamVets initiative, which provides financial assistance to veterans looking to attend the University to complete a degree. The initiative was one of the primary reasons that Fordham ranked 34th on the ''Military Times EDGE'' list of &quot;veteran-friendly&quot; universities in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vets&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/eNewsroom/topstories_2220.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fraternities and sororities===
Like many Jesuit institutions, Fordham does not have any [[Greek Letter Organizations|Greek letter fraternities or sororities]] on campus. Nevertheless, it does have a number of organizations that are similar to fraternities and sororities in both structure and function. The University has an informal system of Houses off campus, which performs many of the same social functions as a traditional Greek system (though in a milder context). Most of the houses are independent, but some are affiliated with specific clubs and athletic teams on campus. In addition, Campus Ministry oversees a number of Christian Life Communities, co-ed, faith-based social organizations that meet weekly to discuss spirituality, build friendships, and âput the Gospel values into action.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Campus Ministry&quot;/&gt; Finally, the University supports a chapter of [[Pershing Rifles]], the national military fraternity.&lt;ref name=&quot;ROTC&quot;/&gt;

The Jack Coffey College Council is Fordham's chapter of the [[Knights of Columbus]], the national Catholic service fraternity and secret society for men. Committed to the advancement of charity, unity, fraternity, and patriotism, the council meets weekly for various social, service, and spiritual activities and operates a sister organization on campus, the St. Elizabeth Ann Seton Society.

The Fordham Club is a senior society that serves as an advisory board to the President of the University. Composed of about 30 students who are generally at or near the top of the senior class, the club meets every month to discuss various issues surrounding the student experience at Fordham and make recommendations to the president regarding these issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;FClub&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_at_r/about_us/people/fordham_club_22880.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
Fordham University has many traditions, some of which are listed below:

*'''The President's Ball:''' The President's Ball takes place every autumn on the night before the [[Homecoming]] football game. It is a semi-formal event held underneath a tent at the Rose Hill campus on Edward's Parade Ground, the University's largest quadrangle. The event is hosted by the Office of the President, which is from where it gets its name.
*'''Under the Tent:''' The &quot;Under the Tent&quot; Dance is a semi-formal event that is held the weekend before final exams. It takes place underneath a tent on Martyrs' Lawn, the University's second-largest quadrangle, and has a different theme each year. The dance is part of the Spring Weekend Festival, which also includes two concerts, a celebrity Q&amp;A, a race around the Rose Hill campus, and a comedy show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spring Wknd&quot;&gt;http://www.hercampus.com/fordham-spring-weekend&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Festival of Lessons and Carols:''' The Fordham University Choir presents a concert of [[Nine Lessons and Carols|Lessons and Carols]] every year during the [[Christmas]] season. The choir performs one afternoon concert at the University Church on the Rose Hill campus and one evening concert at the Church of Saint Paul the Apostle next to the Lincoln Center campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lessons&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/Campus_Resources/eNewsroom/topstories_2001.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Midnight Breakfast:''' Each semester, the official beginning of the final exam period is marked by a &quot;midnight breakfast,&quot; in which professors cook students their favorite breakfast items so as to prepare them for the long night of studying ahead.
*'''The Liberty Cup:''' The [[Liberty Cup]] is awarded annually to the winner of the football game between Fordham and Columbia Universities, the only two NCAA Division I football teams in New York City. The tradition began in 2002, a year after the Fordham-Columbia game was postponed due to the [[September 11th attacks]] (hence the name).&lt;ref name=&quot;Liberty Cup&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_969.asp&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Encaenia:''' Fordham College at Rose Hill hosts an [[Encaenia]] in early May each year. Faculty, administrators, and students process in [[academic regalia]], and candidates for degrees at the current year's Commencement receive various awards and honors. The ceremony includes a sentimental speech by the year's [[valedictorian]] as well as a generally more humorous yet equally endearing speech by the honorary Lord or Lady of the Manor selected for the evening.&lt;ref name=&quot;Encaenia&quot;&gt;http://www.fordham.edu/campus_resources/enewsroom/archives/archive_1254.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==
There are several symbols associated with Fordham University, some of which are listed below:

*'''Maroon:''' Fordham's official color was originally [[magenta]], but magenta was also used by Fordham's archrival, Harvard University. Since it was improper for the two schools to be wearing the same color in athletic competitions, the matter was to be settled by a series of baseball games. The winning team could lay claim to magenta; the losing team would have to find a new color. Fordham won, but Harvard reneged on its promise. Later, in 1874, at a meeting of the student body, one of the matters dicussed was that of choosing an official college color that would belong to Fordham and Fordham alone. Stephen Wall ('75), suggested maroon, a color not widely used at the time. He explained that it looked &quot;something like claret wine with the sun shining through it.&quot; The committee charged with determining the official color unanimously agreed, and maroon has been the official color ever since. Ironically, Harvard also stopped using magenta in favor of crimson.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colors&quot;&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/Inauguration/Fordham_at_a_Glance/University_Colors_11816.asp University Colors&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Ram:''' The [[bighorn sheep|Ram]] became Fordham's mascot as a result of a slightly vulgar cheer that Fordham fans sang during an 1893 football game against the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. The students began cheering &quot;One-damn, two-damn, three-damn ... Fordham!&quot; It was an instant hit, but &quot;[[Damn#Profane language|damn]]&quot; was later sanitized to &quot;ram&quot; to conform to the University's image.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;
*'''The Victory Bell:''' Presented to Fordham by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, LL.D. ('44), the Victory Bell was the ship's bell of the Japanese warship ''Junyo''. It currently stands in front of the gymnasium at the Rose Hill campus. On May 11, 1946, the Charter Centenary of the University, President Harry S. Truman became the first to ring the Victory Bell on campus. Today, it peals following Ram athletic victories, and its ringing signals the beginning of Commencement each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colors&quot;/&gt;
*'''The Great Seal:''' The Great Seal of Fordham University was designed to acknowledge the presence of the members of the [[Society of Jesus]], hence the [[Coat of Arms]] of the Society in the center of the seal. Around this central fact is grouped the name of the University, the date of its founding, its motto, and its various schools. The Coat of Arms of the Society of Jesus bears the Greek letters of the lapidary form of the name of Jesus (''IHS'') with the cross resting on the crossed line of the H, the three nails beneath, all in gold in a field framed in maroon, the color of the University, with silver fleur-de-lis on the edge of the maroon frame, in remembrance of the French Jesuits who arrived in 1846. Immediately above the central shield rests the laurel crown enclosing the tiles of the areas of learning of the college when it was first granted University status in 1907: arts, science, [[philosophy]], [[medicine]], and [[law]]. Below the central shield is a blue scroll with the motto of the University, ''Sapientia et Doctrina''.  The scroll rests on a gold field emblematic of learning (doctrina); scattered over the field are fiery tongues emblematic of the [[Holy Spirit]] of Wisdom (sapientia), as evinced on the first [[Pentecost]]. In a circular maroon field edged with laurel-colored beads is the title of the University, ''Universitas Fordhamensis''. At the lower edge of the circular field is the date of the founding of the University, 1841. Finally, surrounding the entire seal, is a heraldic belt. The belt is used as a stylistic decoration to the seal; however, [[Oxford University]], one of the few schools that uses the belt in its seal, maintains that without the belt, the seal is not official.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bulletin&quot;/&gt;
*'''The mace:''' The [[Ceremonial mace|mace]] of Fordham University is traditionally carried at Commencement by the President of the Faculty Senate, who serves as the Grand Marshal of the academic procession. The device, four feet in length, bears a regal [[Crown (heraldry)|crown]] at the summit to denote the delegated sovereignty of the [[University of the State of New York]] to grant academic degrees. Above the crown is a [[cross]] composed of four [[windmill]] [[sails]] to signify the faith and the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] founding fathers of [[New Amsterdam]]. The center of the cross displays a heraldic [[rose]] for Rose Hill. Immediately beneath the crown is a support with the Fordham seal emblazoned. The upper node of the staff is decorated with three heraldic roses, the Fordham seal, the ram's head, and a silhouette of Fordham's Lincoln Center campus. The names of Fordham's schools are engraved above the node, and the names of Fordham's presidents from 1841 to 1966 are engraved below the node. The mace was a gift to the University from the Fordham University Alumni Federation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colors&quot;/&gt;
*'''The Terrace of the Presidents:''' Robert Gannon, S.J., President of Fordham University from 1936 to 1949, initiated the custom of engraving the granite steps leading up to Keating Hall with the names of heads of state who have received honorary doctorates from Fordham. Among the first names included were President Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1940) and President Harry S. Truman (1946). More recently, the names of President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines (1986), President Mary Robinson of Ireland (1995), and President Mary McAleese of Ireland (2010) have been added to the Terrace.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colors&quot;/&gt;
*'''School songs:''' Fordham's official school song is &quot;Alma Mater Fordham,&quot; and its [[fight song]] is &quot;Fordham Ram&quot; by J. Ignatius Coveney. &quot;The Marching Song&quot; is typically played during parades and after athletic games (particularly after a Fordham victory).&lt;ref name=&quot;Songs&quot;&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/audience/sheetmusic.shtml Fordham Ram sheet music]&lt;/ref&gt;
