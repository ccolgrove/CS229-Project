The '''2009 Tonga earthquake''' was a 7.6 [[moment magnitude scale|magnitude]] [[earthquake]] that occurred off the coast of [[Tonga]] on March 19, 2009 [[UTC]].&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt;&lt;ref name=BBCa&gt; {{cite web |title=South Vulcan spared quake damage |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2009-03-20 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/7953858.stm |accessdate=2009-03-20}} &lt;/ref&gt; It occurred at 18:17:41 UTC and had a depth of around {{convert|34|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; A [[tsunami]] warning was not issued in the aftermath of the earthquake, and people got angry, although this was later cancelled.&lt;ref name=CNN&gt; {{cite web |title=Major quake strikes off Tonga |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=2008-03-19 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/asiapcf/03/19/tonga.quake/index.html |accessdate=2009-03-19}} &lt;/ref&gt; It was followed a short while later by an [[aftershock]] earthquake that had a magnitude of 5.3.&lt;ref name=BBCa/&gt; Two more aftershocks followed on March 20 (UTC), with magnitudes of 5.4 and 5.0 M&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, then another magnitude 5.0 aftershock on March 21, totalling four aftershocks above magnitude 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthquake.usgs.gov/eqcenter/recenteqsww/Quakes/quakes_big.php|title=Latest Earthquakes M5.0+ in World|date=March 22, 2009|work=Earthquake Hazards Program|publisher=United States Geological Survey|accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quake occurred approximately {{convert|220|km|mi}} to the southeast of [[Nuku'alofa]], the capital of Tonga,&lt;ref name=USGS/&gt; and initial reports suggest that there have been no injuries or significant damage. The earthquake was felt as far away as [[New Zealand]]'s [[North Island]], over {{convert|3000|km|mi}} away.&lt;ref name=BBCa/&gt;

The earthquake occurred four days after the beginning of a major [[undersea volcano|undersea]] [[2009 Tonga undersea volcanic eruption|volcanic eruption]] near to [[Hunga Tonga]]. As of yet there has been no confirmation of a direct link between the volcanic eruption and earthquake, but Ken Hudnut, a [[geophysicist]] for  the [[United States Geological Survey]], stated that &quot;it seems suggestive at this point&quot;.&lt;ref name=CNN/&gt; Keleti Mafi, the Tongan government's chief [[seismologist]], has suggested that the earthquake is likely to have a direct impact on the volcanic eruption, stating that the &quot;strength of the earthquake could crack the volcano's (undersea) vent and allow more [[magma]] to be ejected&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |title=Strong quake near Tonga prompts tsunami warning |publisher=[[Yahoo News]] |date=2009-03-20 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090320/ap_on_re_au_an/as_tonga_earthquake |accessdate=2009-03-21}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}} &lt;/ref&gt;
