The '''Penguin Liberation Front''' (PLF) is a project to provide packages of so-called &quot;endangered software&quot; - [[free software]] which may not be legally distributable in some countries - for [[Linux]] users and developers. This software cannot be included in [[Linux distribution]]s for various reasons, such as:

* [[Software patent]]s, prohibiting the use of [[abstract algorithm]]s regardless of implementation
* Other [[intellectual property]] laws, such as [[DMCA]] in the [[United States]], and [[EU Copyright Directive|EUCD]] in the [[European Union]]
* Security laws, such as strong [[Cryptography#Prohibitions|cryptography prohibition]] in many countries

Much free software is affected by these issues, and is therefore illegal in some parts of the world. This makes use of these packages difficult even for those in countries where no such laws are broken, since these packages are generally not carried in standard [[Package management system#Repositories|package repositories]].

The PLF focused on [[Mandriva Linux]] and used [[urpmi]] for distribution. An effort to provide packages for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] was started, but later shut down due to lack of time to maintain it.  A free packages repository for Ubuntu similar to PLF is instead maintained by the [[Medibuntu]] project.
