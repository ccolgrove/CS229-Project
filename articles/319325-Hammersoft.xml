==Early life and career==
O'Toole was born '''Annette Toole''' in [[Houston, Texas]], the daughter of Dorothy Geraldine ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] Niland) and William West Toole, Jr.  Her mother taught dance, something O'Toole learned at the age of 3.&lt;ref name=&quot;starlog&quot;/&gt;  She started taking acting lessons after family moved to [[Los Angeles]] when she was 13; her first role was on ''[[The Danny Kaye Show]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;starlog&quot;/&gt;  She also had guest appearances in shows such as ''[[My Three Sons]]'' (1960), ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Hawaii Five-O]]'', and ''[[The Partridge Family]]''.

===1970sâ1980s===
O'Toole's first major film role was as a jaded beauty pageant contestant in the 1975 satire ''[[Smile (1975 film)|''Smile'']]''; she got the role after doing an impression of a &quot;dead cockroach&quot; at the audition.&lt;ref name=&quot;starlog&quot;/&gt;  She also appeared as [[Robby Benson]]'s tutor/girlfriend in the college basketball story ''[[One on One (film)|''One on One'']]'' in 1977.

On January 19, 2010, it was announced that O'Toole would be returning to ''Smallville'' for at least one episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/OToole-Returning-Smallville-1013986.aspx| title=Annette O'Toole Returning to ''Smallville''| publisher=TVGuide.com| accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 22, 2010, Annette O'Toole played the role of Veronica; a middle aged woman suffering from severe case of Alzheimer's, in season 3 episode 7 of the TV series ''[[Lie to Me]]''.

===Musical career===
In retrospect, O'Toole can date the beginning of her songwriting career to events during a car ride after the [[September 11 attacks]]; as her husband [[Michael McKean]] describes it, &quot;On September 11, 2001, Annette found herself without an airline to carry her back down to Los Angeles from Vancouver, where she films ''Smallville''.  So she drove a rental car down.  The two of us drove it back up together, and on the long drive up there, somewhere between Portland and Seattle, she told me she had a tune in her head.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack&quot;/&gt; The &quot;tune in her head&quot; became &quot;Potato's in the Paddy Wagon&quot;, one of three songs the couple wrote for ''[[A Mighty Wind]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack&quot;/&gt; including the [[Academy Award for Best Song|Oscar-nominated song]] &quot;[[A Kiss at the End of the Rainbow]].&quot;

O'Toole sang &quot;What Could Be Better?&quot; &amp;mdash; a song she and her husband co-wrote &amp;mdash; for the 2004 [[Buena Vista Records|Disney]] children's album ''[[A World of Happiness]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;soundtrack&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= A World of Happiness Roster:  Annette O'Toole| url= http://aworldofhappiness.com/roster_annetteotoole.html | publisher= HyLo Productions | accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In MayâJune 2005, the couple did a [[cabaret]] act for &quot;[[Michael Feinstein|Feinstein's]] at the Regency&quot; in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/92826-Michael-McKean-and-Annette-OToole-Promise-an-Evening-of-No-Standards-at-Feinsteins |title= Michael McKean and Annette O'Toole Promise an Evening of No Standards at Feinstein's | date= 9 May 2005 | publisher= [[Playbill]]| accessdate=2010-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On July 7, 2007, O'Toole appeared as a backing singer for her husband's fictional band [[Spinal Tap (band)|Spinal Tap]] at the [[London]] leg of the [[Live Earth]] concerts. She has also performed on the band's 2009 ''Unwigged and Unplugged'' tour.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Personal life==
O'Toole married actor Bill Geisslinger on April 8, 1983;&lt;ref name=&quot;starlog&quot;&gt;[http://www.supermancinema.co.uk/superman3/general/media/starlog72_1983_otoole/index.shtml 1983 Annette O'Toole Interview] from ''[[Starlog]] 72'' via supermancinema.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; the couple had two sons, Nell and Anna Geisslinger.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}
