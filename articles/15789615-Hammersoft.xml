The hijackers demanded the release of Commando Jihad members imprisoned in Indonesia, and US $ 1.5 million, as well as a plane to take those prisoners to an unspecified destination. The [[Kopassus]] commandos who took part in this mission trained for only three days with totally unfamiliar weapons, brilliantly executed this fast-paced operation.
