'''Ntfsprogs''' is a collection of [[Free software|free]] [[Unix]] utilities for managing the [[NTFS]] [[filesystem]] used by [[Windows XP]], [[Windows Server 2003]], [[Windows 2000]], [[Windows NT 4.0]], [[Windows Vista]], [[Windows Server 2008]] and [[Windows 7]] on a [[Partition (computing)|harddisk partition]]. 'ntfsprogs' was the first stable method of writing to NTFS partitions in Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

All NTFS versions are supported, used by 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. ntfsprogs remains a popular way of interacting with NTFS partitions and is included by most [[Linux]] distributions&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Live CD]]s. There are also versions that have been compiled for Windows.

On April 12, 2011 it was announced that Ntfsprogs project was merged with [[NTFS-3G]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuxera.com/open-source/release-ntfs-3g-ntfsprogs-2011-4-12/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Included programs==
* &lt;tt&gt;[[ntfsresize]]&lt;/tt&gt;, used for non-destructively resizing a NTFS Partition
* &lt;tt&gt;[[ntfsclone]]&lt;/tt&gt;, used for making uncompressed, but space-efficient [[disk cloning|clones]] of NTFS Partitions.  It does not support image verification{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}.
* &lt;tt&gt;mkntfs&lt;/tt&gt;, used for creating NTFS partitions
* &lt;tt&gt;ntfsmount&lt;/tt&gt;, for [[mount (computing)|mounting]] using [[Filesystem in Userspace|FUSE]]
* &lt;tt&gt;ntfsfix&lt;/tt&gt;, schedules a Windows check of a file system on the next boot
* &lt;tt&gt;ntfsundelete&lt;/tt&gt;, undeletes a file
* &lt;tt&gt;ntfsdecrypt&lt;/tt&gt;, decrypts [[Encrypting File System|EFS]]
* &lt;tt&gt;ntfsck&lt;/tt&gt;, performs a consistency check on the specified volume.  (Note that development appears to be suspended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Other programs are included, but are very basic in functionality, and/or intended for developers.
