The '''University of Puerto Rico at MayagÃ¼ez''' ('''UPRM''') or '''Recinto Universitario de MayagÃ¼ez''' ('''RUM''') in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] (also referred to as '''Colegio''' and '''CAAM''' in allusion to its former name), is a [[Land-grant university|land-grant]], [[sea-grant]], [[space-grant]] [[State university system|state university]] located in the city of [[MayagÃ¼ez, Puerto Rico|MayagÃ¼ez]], [[Puerto Rico]]. UPRM is the second-largest university [[campus]] of the [[University of Puerto Rico]] system and the premier [[engineering]] and [[science]] institution of the [[Caribbean]] and [[Latin America]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}.

UPRM has been accredited by the [[Middle States Commission on Higher Education]] (MSCHE) since 1946. Also, the engineering undergraduate program is accredited by the [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET), the nursing undergraduate program is accredited by the [[National League for Nursing]] (NLN) and the Chemistry Department is recognized by the [[American Chemical Society]] (ACS). The College of Business Administration is going through the process of the [[AACSB]] accreditation. The MayagÃ¼ez campus of the University of Puerto Rico has been a member of [[Oak Ridge Associated Universities]] (ORAU) since 1966.

UPRM continues its development in the best tradition of a land-grant institution. It is a co-educational, bilingual, and non-sectarian school comprising the [[UPRM College of Agricultural Sciences|Colleges of Agricultural Sciences]], [[UPRM College of Arts and Sciences|Arts and Sciences]], [[UPRM College of Business Administration|Business Administration]], [[UPRM College of Engineering|Engineering]] and the Division of Continuing Education and Professional Studies. The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the Agricultural Experiment Station and the Agricultural Extension Service. In 2009, the campus population was composed of 12,108 students, 1,924 regular staff members and 1,037 members of the education staff.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uprm.edu/catalog/UndergradCatalog2009-2010.pdf |title=pag 1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[University of Puerto Rico]] was created by an act of the Legislative Assembly on March 12, 1903 emerging as an outgrowth of the Normal School, which had been established three years earlier to train teachers for the Puerto Rican school system. In 1908, the benefits of the Morill-Nelson Act declared applicable to the island, fostered the rapid growth of the university. Eloquent evidence of that growth was the establishment of the College of Liberal Arts at [[RÃ­o Piedras]] in 1910 and the College of Agriculture at MayagÃ¼ez in 1911 as a [[land-grant university]].&lt;ref name=Huellas&gt;{{cite book| title=El mÃ¡s viejo del RUM| author=MÃ³nica HechevarrÃ­a| publisher=El Nuevo DÃ­a| location=Puerto Rico| chapter=Huellas| date=2008-02-24| page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The founding of the institution is credited to D.W. May (Director of the Federal Experiment Station), [[JosÃ© de Diego]] and Carmelo Alemar. In 1912 the name of the institution was changed to the College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts or ''Colegio de Agricultura y Artes MecÃ¡nicas'' (CAAM).

In 1918, an earthquake and a fire caused significant damage to the institution. The ruins of the entrance of one of the buildings, Degetau Hall â which not only withstood the earthquake, but proved to be almost indestructible after the rebuilt hall was torn down in the late 1940s â would later become the emblem of the institution. In 1988, the archway ruins (the [[portico]]) was moved, landcaped and turned into a monument.

The campus rectory was located at the [[Edificio Jose de Diego|JosÃ© de Diego building]], the oldest standing edification within the campus, built in 1911.&lt;ref name=Huellas/&gt; The building was inscribed in the National Historic Building Registry as an architectural patrimony.&lt;ref name=Huellas/&gt; In 1940, a clock tower was built into the main building.&lt;ref name=Huellas/&gt; In 1993, the building underwent a restoration.&lt;ref name=Huellas/&gt;

In 1929, the [[Liga AtlÃ©tica Interuniversitaria]] was created at the MayagÃ¼ez campus. The LAI is an athletic organization, similar to the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], created with the purpose of promoting and regulating sports activities. It originally consisted of a three event competition: basketball, baseball and track and field. Currently the competition consists of more than 25 sports.

[[File:Portico1.jpg|thumb|left|UPRM's [[portico]].]]

In 1942 as a result of university reform, the campus was organized with a considerable degree of autonomy into the Colleges of [[Agriculture]], [[Engineering]], and [[Science]] under the direction of a [[Chancellor (education)|vice-chancellor]]. In the 1950s the institution saw more programs added when the College of Arts and Sciences, and the Nuclear Center were established.

The [[Puerto Rican Legislative Assembly]] reorganized the University of Puerto Rico's system in 1966. This reorganization of the system lead to the controversial change of its name to University of Puerto Rico â MayagÃ¼ez Campus, which is used in the present day as the official name of the institution.&lt;ref name=Huellas/&gt;

In 2007, 35.4% of all [[Engineering]] degrees were granted to women at UPRM, one of the largest percentages in US universities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The University of Puerto Rico at MayagÃ¼ez is the second largest [[Hispanic-serving institution]] in the United States.

To this day, as a matter pride, students and alumni alike still refer to the institution as El Colegio (The College) in reference to its former CAAM name. Such school spirit is evident still in sporting events with the student battle cry and motto of &quot;Â¡Antes, Ahora y Siempre, Colegio!&quot; (&quot;Before, Now and Forever, Colegio!&quot;). The university is unique in Puerto Rico for creating a strong bond between students and the institution itself.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Alumni proudly declare themselves &quot;colegiales&quot; even decades after graduating. Being a &quot;colegial&quot; becomes part of a student's identity. Some students say that, given the shared challenges of academic life there, all alumni share a sense of belonging and trust. &quot;Colegiales&quot; are deeply prized by employers in Puerto Rico, the Caribbean and many parts of the United States.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}

==Organization==
===Administrative Board===
 The Administrative Board of the MayagÃ¼ez Campus consists of the [[Chancellor (education)|Chancellor]] as presiding officer, the [[Dean (education)|deans]], two academic senators elected among those faculty members of the Senate who are not ex-officio, senators, and an elected student representative. The President of the University serves as an ex-officio member. The Board acts as an advisory body to the Chancellor, prepares the development plan of the Campus, approves the proposed budget prepared by the Chancellor, and grants tenure, promotions and leaves of absence.

{{Main|UPRM General Library}}
The MayagÃ¼ez Campus General Library serves the local campus community as well as residents of MayagÃ¼ez and nearby towns. It fully supports UPRM education and research mission and objectives by providing adequate library and information resources, facilities and services.

==Academics==
{{Expand section|date=August 2010}}

The University of Puerto Rico at MayagÃ¼ez consists of four major colleges:
* [[UPRM College of Agricultural Sciences|College of Agricultural Sciences]]
* [[UPRM College of Arts and Sciences|College of Arts and Sciences]]
* [[UPRM College of Business Administration|College of Business Administration]]
* [[UPRM College of Engineering|College of Engineering]]

UPRM offers 52 bachelor's programs, 28 master's programs and five doctoral programs.

UPRM offers undergraduate and graduate education in all of their four colleges. Doctoral programs are offered in the College of Arts and Sciences and the College of Engineering.

The College of Agricultural Sciences includes the [[Agricultural Experiment Station]] and the Agricultural Extension Service.

UPRM College of Engineering graduation rates are higher than the University of Wisconsin, Texas A &amp; M, University of Washington and the University of Minnesota. It has increased the percentage of its faculty with doctorates from 66.5% in the 1999-00 academic year to 79.4% in 2007.

The MayagÃ¼ez campus is one of two land-grant universities in the tropics and the only one where Spanish is the native language (although English is also used extensively). The campus provides a unique setting and, to some extent, it is in a privileged position to serve as an international center for studies, training, and research in the fields of agricultural sciences.

The academic calendar has two semesters: fall (early August to mid-December) and spring (early January to mid-May). While textbooks and research materials used at the [[University of Puerto Rico]] are often in English, Spanish is the language of instruction in most courses at UPRM, and students are required to have a working knowledge of the English language. The individual professor decides the language used in class lectures and in student evaluation activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asee.org/publications/profiles/upload/2007ProfileEng.pdf |title=2_07ProfileFRONT_11-50.indd |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UPRM Office of Institutional Research and Planning reported a total enrollment of 12,380 students for the 2006 fall semester.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oiip.uprm.edu/docs/fact_sheet/Resumen%20de%20Datos%20Estudiantiles%202006-2007.pdf |title=Resumen de Datos Estudiantiles 2006-2007 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the institution had an acceptance rate of 62%.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.uprm.edu/filmcertificate/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greek life===
The University of Puerto Rico at MayagÃ¼ez has a number of [[fraternities and sororities]]. Until the early 1990s most of the established fraternities owned a house in the nearby Bosque Street in downtown Mayaguez, yet a law was passed in Puerto Rico that no fraternity houses may be in residential areas. Now only Alpha Beta Chi and Phi Sigma Alpha have houses; no brothers live in them.
