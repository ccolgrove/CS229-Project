'''WIBG''' (1020 [[AM broadcasting|AM]], &quot;Talk Radio 1020&quot;) is a talk [[radio station]] from [[Ocean City, New Jersey]].  These call letters were previously used in [[Philadelphia]] for a pioneering [[rock 'n' roll]] station now called [[WNTP]].

WIBG broadcasts on an AM frequency of 1020 khz, which is the same frequency used by Pittsburgh's [[KDKA (AM)|KDKA]], a clear channel station that is also America's oldest radio station.  As such, WIBG broadcasts only during the daytime to avoid interfering with KDKA.

During the daytime WIBG's signal reaches from [[Toms River, New Jersey|Toms River]] to [[Cape May, New Jersey]], and west into the Philadelphia suburbs.

On November 19, 2008, WIBG joined [[Radiolicious]] and began streaming on the [[iPhone]] and [[iPod Touch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Careless |work=Radio World |title=Radiolicious Brings AM FM Radio to iPhones |url=http://www.rwonline.com/article/70486 |date=November 28, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The station began operations in the mid-1960s as '''WSLT''' on 1520 kHz. The call sign was changed to WIBG in 1978 after the call went out of use in Philadelphia. The station broadcast with various formats over the years including MOR, Top 40, oldies and country. In the early 1980s WIBG lost the lease on its transmitter site in Somers Point and went off the air for a time. A replacement site in Cape May County was eventually located and the station built a new tower site and returned to the air, changing its frequency to 1020 kHz in the process. The revived WIBG aired Spanish-language programming and tourist information before adopting a religious format.
