It has a significant user base and has received strong ratings and reviews on major independent download sites.&lt;ref name=cnet&gt;{{cite web |url=http://download.cnet.com/The-KMPlayer/3000-13632_4-10659939.html |title=The KMPlayer 2.9.4.1437 CNET editors' review |date=2008-11-06 |publisher=[[CNET]] [[Download.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=softpedia&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.softpedia.com/reviews/windows/KMPlayer--Review-77374.shtml |title=Uber Configurable Video Player |date=2008-01-28 |publisher=[[Softpedia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=majorgeeks&gt;{{cite web |url=http://majorgeeks.com/KMPlayer_d5484.html |title=KMPlayer 3.0.0.1438 Final |date=2010-09-15 |publisher=[[MajorGeeks.com]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
The player handles a wide range of audio, video and [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitles]] formats and allows one to capture audio, video, and [[screenshot]]s. It provides both internal and external filters with a fully controlled environment in terms of connections to other splitters, [[Codec|decoders]], audio/video transform filters and [[Rendering (computer graphics)|renderers]] without grappling with the [[DirectShow]] merit system (a system of selecting and prioritizing codecs across the entire Windows operating system&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url = http://msmvps.com/blogs/chrisl/articles/40395.aspx merit system

}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Internal filters are not registered into the system's registry to prevent the operating system from confusing system filters with K-Multimedia Player's filters

The player can set many [[Audio signal processing|audio]] and [[Image processing|video]] effects, slow down or increase  [[Audio timescale-pitch modification|playback speed]], select parts of a [[video]] as favorites, do various A-B repeats, remap the keys of remote interface for HTPC including overlay screen controls, and change a skin dynamically depending on a media type playing. KMP is completely customizable thanks to a wide selection of skins  and color schemes, as well extensive the configuration options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Skins|url=http://www.kmplayer.com/forums/downloads.php?do=cat&amp;id=2|work=The KMPlayer's Forums|publisher=Pandora TV|accessdate=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alleged license violations ===
Gabest, original author of [[Media Player Classic]] claimed that KMP was violating the [[GNU General Public License | GNU General Public License (GPL)]] by using GPLed code written by both him and others in a closed-source program. The development team has denied this allegation; they maintain that player did not actually include the mentioned GPL code in the executable, and thus was not breaking any GPL rules.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?thread_id=1387859&amp;forum_id=462894 GPL violation post] in SourceForge, posted 23 Apr 2005 by Gabest.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?t=141 Do not believe bad rumors spread in networks.] in KMP Forum, posted 19 Nov 2005 by Z.&lt;/ref&gt; Controversially, player was bundled with a GPL component, although when the authors were notified they deleted the GPL breaching part bundled with the program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kmplayer.com/forums/showthread.php?p=481#post481 RadGTSplitter.ax being removed from the player bundle, including the GPL license.]&lt;/ref&gt;
