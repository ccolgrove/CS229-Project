[[Mark Sanchez]] became the first USC quarterback to throw five touchdown passes in a half as the Trojans dominated.

USC's defense, ranked first in the nation coming in by allowing just 9.4 points per game, held the Cougars scoreless for the first time since 1984, ending a stretch of 280 straight games in which the Cougs had not been shutout. That was the nation's second-longest active streak behind [[Michigan Wolverines football|Michigan]]'s 306. For Washington State, it's also the largest shutout loss and largest margin of defeat in school history.

&quot;Our guys had a ball playing football today, from the locker room on out,&quot; USC coach [[Pete Carroll]] said. &quot;Right from the start, we wanted to find that focus that we really hadn't had yet.&quot;

It was the largest shutout victory for USC (5-1, 3-1 Pac-10) since a 69-0 win over [[University of Montana|Montana]] in 1931.

&quot;Our intention wasn't to come out and beat these guys by 80 points. Our intention was to come out and play a great football game,&quot; star linebacker [[Rey Maualuga]] said.

The Cougars have now allowed at least 60 points in four games this year, becoming the first BCS team to allow 60-plus points four times in a season.  Beset by injuries, Washington State has allowed 66, 63, 66 and now 69 in four of their conference losses. The Cougars, whose only win is against [[Portland State University|Portland State]] of the Championship Subdivision, have been outscored 385-111 this season. That's on track to break the Pac-10 record for most points allowed in a season, 469 by Oregon State in 1981.

&quot;It's unfortunate for those guys. They are trying to build a program,&quot; Carroll said. &quot;It's tough. I don't know what else we could have done.

&quot;It was a little bit uncomfortable to see what was going to happen.&quot;

The Trojans outgained Washington State 408-17 in the first half and 625-116 for the game. They led 21-0 less than 11 minutes in. Patrick Turner and Ronald Johnson each caught two of Sanchez's scoring throws, freshman Broderick Green rushed for 121 yards and two touchdowns and C.J. Gable ran for 109 yards and three more scores. Stafon Johnson must have had an off game. He ran for 112 yards but didn't score.

It was the first time USC had three 100-yard rushers in a game since 1977.&lt;ref name=&quot;USC records largest shutout victory since 1931&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/recap?gameId=282920265|title=USC records largest shutout victory since 1931|date=2008-10-18|publisher=ESPN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
