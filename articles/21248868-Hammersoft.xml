The '''Battle of Mullaitivu''' was a land battle fought between the [[Military of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan Military]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]] (LTTE) for the control of the town of [[Mullaitivu]] in the [[Northern Theater of Eelam War IV|Northern Theater]] of [[Eelam War IV]] during the [[Sri Lankan civil war]]. The town of Mullaitivu was the last stronghold of the LTTE. The government declared on 25 January 2009 that its troops had entered the town and were consolidating their positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;MOD announcement&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defence.lk/new.asp?fname=20090125_03|title=Troops enter Mullaittivu; LTTE main garrison town falls|date=25 January 2009|work=Ministry of Defence of Sri Lanka|publisher=Defence.lk|accessdate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Independent aid agencies report about 230,000 civilians were inside the war zone around the northern city.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops capture last big rebel town -army&quot; /&gt;

==Background==
The LTTE captured the Mullaitivu military base and town in 1996, following a [[Battle of Mullaitivu (1996)|battle]] which resulted in at least 1639 soldiers being killed or missing.&lt;ref name=&quot;1996 battle&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sundaytimes.lk/961013/sitrep.html|title=Censorship out: then events unfurled|last=Athas|first=Iqbal|date=13 October 1996|work=The Sunday Times|accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LTTE used the town as their main military base since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sindhtoday.net/south-asia/55915.htm|title= LTTEâs last stronghold Mullaitivu captured: Lankan army chief (Roundup) |date=25 January 2009|work=Sindh Today|accessdate=27 January 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large base of the [[Sea Tigers]] was also located in Mullaitivu.&lt;ref name=&quot;satp&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/detailed_news.asp?date1=1/26/2009#1|title=Troops capture Mullaitivu Town|date=26 January 2009|publisher=South Asia Terrorism Portal|accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mullaitivu had been a main target of the Sri Lankan military [[2008â2009 SLA Northern offensive|offensive]] in the [[Northern Theater of Eelam War IV|Northern Theatre]] of [[Eelam War IV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;main target&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.island.lk/2009/01/04/defence2.html|title=The Army wins the Day|last=Ferdinando|first=Shamindra |date=4 January 2009|work=The Island|accessdate=27 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle==
Prior to the battle, public offices in Mullaittivu were closed for the weekend and government employees had moved out of the city ahead of the impending military action on 25 January. Civilians from Mullaittivu were also observed moving towards the north into the jungle areas where the LTTE guerrillas had retreated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops seize last Tiger town&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g8ZfqunvM_5RDOx2JWk4FS-aLo7A|title=Sri Lankan troops seize last Tiger town|date=25 January 2009|publisher=AFP|accessdate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 January 2009, the LTTE had blown up a dam near the town which flooded the surrounding areas. LTTE fighters also built earth barriers, which made it difficult for the army to approach with heavy tanks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops seize last Tiger town&quot; /&gt;

Infantrymen of the Sri Lankan army's 7th Gemunu Watch first entered the town after facing fierce resistance from the LTTE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops enter Mullaitivu, LTTE's last bastion&quot; /&gt; The ground forces were backed by [[Attack helicopter|helicopter gunships]] of the Sri Lankan Air Force. Sri Lankan troops also moved in with a small group of boats from the western side of Mullaittivu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops seize last Tiger town&quot; /&gt; Later, the 59th Division was involved in the consolidating the captured town.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops enter Mullaitivu, LTTE's last bastion&quot; /&gt; Some LTTE fighters are now reported to be hiding in a small area between [[Vishwamadhu]] and [[Puthukkudiyiruppu (Mullaitivu)|Puthukkudiyiruppu]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sri Lankan troops enter Mullaitivu, LTTE's last bastion&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/holnus/000200901251621.htm|title=Sri Lankan troops enter Mullaitivu, LTTE's last bastion|date=25 January 2009|publisher=The Hindu|accessdate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LTTE chief [[Velupillai Prabhakaran]] is said to be hiding in the last jungle areas held. However, the [[Government of Sri Lanka|Sri Lankan government]] is still not certain of the exact location.{{Update after|2010|11}}&lt;ref name=&quot;Cornered, Prabhakaran may end life&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/World/Cornered_Prabhakaran_may_end_life/articleshow/4031444.cms|title=Cornered, Prabhakaran may end life|date=26 Jan 2009|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=25 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; India and [[Malaysia]] have stepped up efforts to prevent Prabhakaran from entering their territories.
