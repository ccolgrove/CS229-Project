'''Alfred Unser, Jr.''' (born April 19, 1962), nicknamed &quot;'''Little Al'''&quot;, &quot;'''Al Junior'''&quot; or simply &quot;'''Junior'''&quot; is a retired [[United States|American]] [[race car]] driver and two-time [[Indianapolis 500]] winner.

==History==
Al Unser, Jr. was born into a racing family in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]]. He is the son of [[Al Unser]] and the nephew of [[Bobby Unser]], who both won the [[Indianapolis 500]] themselves.

===Early career===
By the age of 11, Al Junior was racing [[sprint car]]s. After high school, he was already in the [[World of Outlaws]] series of sprint car racing. He soon moved into road racing, winning the [[Super Vee]] title in 1981 and the [[Can-Am]] title in 1982.

===Rising CART star===
In [[1982 IndyCar season|1982]], Unser made his debut on the [[Champ Car|CART]] circuit. [[1983 IndyCar season|A year later]], he competed in [[1983 Indianapolis 500|his first Indianapolis 500]], finishing tenth. Unser continued racing on the [[American Championship Car Racing|CART circuit]], becoming one of the series' rising stars. He finished second in the CART championship point standings in [[1985 IndyCar season|1985]], losing to [[Al Unser|his father]] by just one point. He began competing in the [[International Race of Champions|IROC]] championship in 1986, winning that championship with two victories in four races. At the age of 24, Unser was the youngest IROC champion ever. Unser won the 1988 and 1986 IROC championships. Unser won the [[24 Hours of Daytona]], also at age 24 for the first time in 1986 and again in 1987.

Unser continued to improve on the CART circuit, finishing fourth in the points standings in [[1986 IndyCar season|1986]], third in [[1987 IndyCar season|1987]], second in [[1988 IndyCar season|1988]] and finally winning the series for the first time in [[1990 IndyCar season|1990]]. In [[1989 Indianapolis 500|1989]], Unser was on the verge of winning his first Indianapolis 500, but while battling with [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] for the lead, the two touched wheels and Unser spun out, hitting the wall and ending his chances. Unser would have [[1992 Indianapolis 500|his day at Indy in 1992]], however, defeating [[Scott Goodyear]] by 0.043 of a second, the closest finish in Indianapolis 500 history. During the off-season he drove in the [[1993 NASCAR Winston Cup Series|1993]] [[Daytona 500]] for [[Hendrick Motorsports]] finishing 36th in what would be his only [[NASCAR]] start. He ran well in [[1993 Daytona 500|the race]], running with the lead pack all day, until a late race crash with [[Kyle Petty]] and [[Bobby Hillin Jr.]] During an intreview with [[Mike Joy]] after the accident, Joy asked him if he would be back. Unser Jr. said that he wanted to come back, but it would never happen. Unser, Jr. also tested a [[Williams F1]] car but never competed in the series.

===Penske years===
[[Image:PenskePC23.jpg|thumb|right|[[Penske PC-23]] driven by Al Unser, Jr. in 1994.]]In [[1994 IndyCar season|1994]], Unser again won [[1994 Indianapolis 500|at Indy]], this time with [[Penske Racing]]. His teammate was [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], the man whom he battled with five years before. Unser turned in a dominant season-long performance, winning eight of 16 races on his way to his second CART championship, as well as being named [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s [[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]] Athlete of the Year that year. In [[1995 IndyCar season|1995]] he shockingly failed to qualify at [[1995 Indianapolis 500|Indianapolis]], and he would later point to this as the trigger event for his descent into alcoholism and the breakup of his marriage. He would finish second to [[Jacques Villeneuve]] in CART championship points in 1995, but after finishing fourth in [[1996 IndyCar season|1996]], 13th in [[1997 CART season|1997]], 11th in [[1998 CART season|1998]] and 21st in [[1999 CART Championship Series season|1999]], (not helped by the fact that he had to sit out two races after breaking his leg in the season-opener at [[GAINSCO Auto Insurance Indy 300|Miami]] in a first-lap accident with [[Japan]]ese driver [[Naoki Hattori]]) Unser would eventually leave CART to join the budding [[Indy Racing League]] for the [[2000 in IRL|2000 campaign]]. Unser won a total of 31 races during his 17 seasons in CART.

===Indy Racing League===
He won his first IRL race that same season at [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]]. Unser would go on to win a total of three races in his IRL career, but after [[broken pelvis|breaking his pelvis]] in an [[all-terrain vehicle]] accident in October [[2003 IndyCar Series season|2003]], Unser had difficulty securing a ride for the [[2004 IndyCar Series season|2004 season]]. He finally signed with [[Patrick Racing]] three races into the season, but after a 22nd-place finish in [[Richmond International Raceway|Richmond]], Al Unser, Jr. finally announced his retirement from racing on June 30, 2004. Unser continued to remain involved in racing, however, outside of a driving capacity.  He served as an adviser for Patrick Racing and worked as a mentor for his son, [[Alfred Unser]], who is currently working his way through the lower ranks in open-wheel racing.

===Post-retirement racing and personal issues===

[[Image:AlUnserJrMay2007Cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Unser, Jr. before the 2007 Indianapolis 500.]]
In [[2006 IndyCar Series season|2006]] Unser announced that he would come back to racing again and he would run the [[2006 Indianapolis 500]], teamed with fellow former winner [[Buddy Lazier]] for [[Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing]]. This came just days after [[Michael Andretti]] also came out of retirement to run the 500. Unser qualified 27th in the 33-car field, and consistently ran in the upper half until a crash ended his day.

In late August, Unser took part in an [[A1 Grand Prix]] test session at [[Silverstone Circuit|Silverstone]].

On 25 January 2007, Unser was arrested and charged with [[driving under the influence]], misdemeanor hit and run, failure to render aid in an accident and failure to report an accident near [[Henderson, Nevada]], USA.

On 2 May 2007, it was announced that Unser would drive a car for racing legend [[A. J. Foyt]] in the [[2007 Indianapolis 500]], carrying the No. 50 on his car in recognition of A.J.'s 50 years at [[Indianapolis 500|the storied race]]. Unser qualified in the 25th starting position after being bumped from the lineup on the second day of qualifying.

On 18 May 2007, Unser spoke publicly for the first time about his battle with [[alcoholism]] when he joined forces with ''[[LIVE outside the Bottle]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.LiveOutsideTheBottle.com LiveOutsideTheBottle.com], Retrieved 2011-09-29&lt;/ref&gt; a national educational campaign to help the public understand the need for addressing and treating alcoholism.

During [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach|the race weekend]] of the [[2009 Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach]], Little Al confirmed that his [[American Championship Car Racing|IndyCar career]] was in fact over.&lt;ref&gt;Cain, Holly. [http://auto-racing.speedtv.com/article/indycar-al-unser-jr-done/ Al Unser Jr. âDoneâ], ''Speed'', April 15, 2009, Retrieved 2009-09-29&lt;/ref&gt; During the weekend he won the [[Toyota Pro/Celebrity Race]]; his second in the event and his eighth Long Beach victory overall.

In 2010, Unser started the Race Clinic for Paralysis charity. 

Unser is on the board of Baltimore Racing Development and helped announce plans for the 2011 Baltimore Grand Prix on Monday, August 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Stan. [http://insidecharmcity.com/2009/08/13/al-unser-jr-to-help-announce-baltimore-grand-prix-plans/ Al Unser Jr. to help announce Baltimore Grand Prix plans], ''Inside Charm City'', August 13, 2009, Retrieved 2011-09-29&lt;/ref&gt;

Unser was inducted into the [[Motorsports Hall of Fame of America]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = The Class of 2009 | journal = [[AutoWeek]] | volume = 59 | issue = 17 | page = 62 | publisher = [[Crain Communications]] | location = [[Detroit, Michigan]] | date = August 24, 2009 | issn = 0192-9674}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 2011 Unser was arrested in Albuquerque, New Mexico on charges of reckless driving and aggravated driving while intoxicated. Charges stemmed from an incident where Unser reportedly drag raced is his [[Chevrolet Suburban]] SUV at speeds of over 100 mph. He was placed on indefinite suspension from his role with IndyCar.&lt;ref&gt;Contreras, Russell. [http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jbi-hqFsVnZpgIWS2jVYH_PYRDCg?docId=0fb451a5f90147069d1fd4da508e6b8e Indy 500 winner Al Unser Jr. arrested for DWI], ''Associated Press'', September 29, 2011, Retrieved 2011-09-29&lt;/ref&gt;
