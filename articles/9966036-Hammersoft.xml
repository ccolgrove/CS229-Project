'''''Chuck''''' is an action-comedy/spy-drama television program from the United States created by [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Chris Fedak]]. The series is about an &quot;average computer-whiz-next-door&quot; named [[Chuck Bartowski|Chuck]], played by [[Zachary Levi]], who receives an encoded e-mail from an old college friend now working for the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA); the message embeds the only remaining copy of the United States' greatest spy secrets into Chuck's brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nbc.com/Chuck/about/index.shtml | title = About ''Chuck'' | publisher=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nbc.com/Fall_Preview/Chuck/ | title = ''Chuck'' | publisher=[[NBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Produced by College Hill Pictures, [[Fake Empire Productions|Fake Empire]], [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]] and [[Warner Bros. Television]], the series premiered on September 24, 2007, on [[NBC]], airing on Monday nights at 8/7c.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=All related listing for ''Chuck'' | url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/showatch.aspx?id=chuck&amp;view=listings | work=The Futon Critic | accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;timeslot1&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=NBC showcases fall primetime entertainment series beginning week of September 24 |url=http://www.nbcumv.com/entertainment/release_detail.nbc/entertainment-20070716000000-nbcshowcasesfallp.html |publisher=NBC |date=July 16, 2007 |accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the second season closed, flagging ratings put ''Chuck'' in danger of cancellation, but fans mounted a successful campaign to encourage NBC to renew the show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Variety-2009may17&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Littleton |first=Cynthia | title='Chuck' back, but on tighter budget | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118003850.html | work=Variety |date=May 17, 2009 | accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was unique in that fans specifically targeted a sponsor of the show, the [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurant chain]], and the chain struck a major sponsorship deal with NBC to help cover costs of the third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title='Chuck' Returns To NBC On Sunday, January 10 | url=http://www.nbc.com/news/2009/11/19/chuck-returns-to-nbc-on-sunday-january-10/ | work=[[NBC]] |date=November 19, 2009 | accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The series' renewal has been uncertain in each subsequent season.

==Plot==
{{Main|List of Chuck episodes}}
[[Chuck Bartowski]] ([[Zachary Levi]]) is in his late twenties, working at a dead end job as a computer service expert at the [[Burbank, California]] [[Buy More]] (a large retail consumer-electronics chain comparable to [[Best Buy]]) with his best friend, [[Morgan Grimes]] ([[Joshua Gomez]]). Chuck is intelligent, but lacks ambition. His sister [[Ellie Woodcomb|Ellie]] ([[Sarah Lancaster]]) and her boyfriend [[Devon Woodcomb|Devon &quot;Captain Awesome&quot; Woodcomb]] ([[Ryan McPartlin]]) are doctors who are constantly encouraging Chuck to make progress in his professional and romantic life.

[[Bryce Larkin]] ([[Matthew Bomer]]), Chuck's former [[Stanford University]] roommate and now Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) agent, steals [[the Intersect]], the entire merged database of the CIA and [[National Security Agency]] (NSA), and destroys the computer storing it. The sole surviving copy becomes subliminally embedded in Chuck's brain via encoded images when he opens an email from Bryce. The NSA's Major [[John Casey (Chuck)|John Casey]] ([[Adam Baldwin]]) and CIA Agent [[Sarah Walker (Chuck)|Sarah Walker]] ([[Yvonne Strahovski]]) are dispatched to investigate.

Chuck is recruited to use the knowledge he now possesses to help thwart assassins and international terrorists, upending his previously mundane life. The Intersect causes Chuck to receive involuntary [[List of Chuck gadgets#&quot;Flashes&quot;|&quot;flashes&quot;]] of information from the database, activated by triggers such as faces, voices, objects, and keywords. In order to protect his family and friends, Chuck must keep his second occupation a secret. Casey and Walker are assigned to watch over Chuck. They are forced to establish an uneasy alliance and cover identities; Walker poses as Chuck's girlfriend and takes a job at a fast food restaurant near the Buy More, while Casey reluctantly becomes part of the Buy More sales team.

The main antagonists driving the plot are a series of rogue spy cabals, first internal to the United States intelligence community and then global in scope, and a core part of the threat is the danger of the Intersect being either '''captured''', making Chuck as much a liability as an asset to the government, or '''replicated''', making Chuck obsolete or outmatched by less scrupulous spies.

Chuck, Sarah and Casey all face professional conflicts as they grow to respect each other, and a genuine romantic interest develops between Chuck and Sarah. Chuck's desire to maintain his close relationships and eventually return to a normal life is challenged by the dangers and growing responsibilities of his secret life, and he gradually becomes a more competent, confident and willing spy.

In the course of events, Chuck unravels mysteries from his life before the series, often dealing with the Intersect: why his parents left, why Bryce got him kicked out of Stanford, and why he's unusually suited for the Intersect.  Meanwhile, Casey and Sarah confront unresolved issues from their lives before the series, including their families, Sarah's history with Bryce, and the spies they previously worked with.  And as Chuck grows more comfortable with his own role, those closest to him are gradually drawn into his spy life.

==Production==
===Conception===
[[Josh Schwartz]] and Chris Fedak wrote the script for the first episode which was initially given a [[put pilot]] commitment by [[NBC]] before a pilot order was green lit by the network in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Development Update: Wednesday, January 3 | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7256 | work=The Futon Critic | date = January 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schwartz and Fedak both attended the [[University of Southern California]] and the latter pitched the idea to Schwartz who agreed to develop the project with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popinterview&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.popgurls.com/article_show.php3?id=670 |first=Amy |title=PopGurls Interview: Josh Schwartz |work=PopGurls |date=July 18, 2007 |accessdate=July 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph McGinty Nichol]], Schwartz's fellow executive producer on ''[[The O.C.]]'', directed the first hour of the series and consequently became an executive producer via his production company, [[Wonderland Sound and Vision]]. Fedak, Peter Johnson, Scott Rosenbaum, Matthew Miller and [[Allison Adler]] also serve as co-executive producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Development Update: Thursday, January 25 | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7276 | work=The Futon Critic | date = January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; NBC gave the series an early pick-up and a thirteen-episode order on May 10, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sullivan|first=Brian Ford |title=NBC to Keep 'Lights' on for Second Season, Adds Newcomers |url=http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7379 |date=May 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2007 |work=The Futon Critic}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 26, 2007, ''[[TV Guide]]'' reported that NBC had picked up the series for a full, 22 episode season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Exclusive: NBC Extends Chuck, Life for Full Season! | url = http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Exclusive-Chuck-Life/800028281 | archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080118013032/http://community.tvguide.com/blog-entry/TVGuide-Editors-Blog/Ausiello-Report/Exclusive-Chuck-Life/800028281 | archivedate = January 18, 2008 | first = Michael | last = Ausiello | date = November 26, 2007 | work=Ausiello Report}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Casting===
[[Zachary Levi]] and [[Adam Baldwin]] were the first two to be cast in February 2007 in the roles of Chuck Bartowski and veteran NSA agent Major John Casey, respectively. Fedak always had Baldwin in mind for the role of John Casey and the producers found that the actor was a &quot;perfect fit&quot; for the character during the first casting session.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popinterview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Development Update: Thursday, February 8 | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7292 | work=The Futon Critic | date = February 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relative newcomer [[Yvonne Strahovski]] was chosen for the female lead role of what was then [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] officer Sarah Kent in the same month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Development Update: Monday, February 12 | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7294 | work=The Futon Critic | date = February 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Casting continued throughout March with [[Sarah Lancaster]], [[Joshua Gomez]], and [[Natalie Martinez]] landing the parts of Dr. Ellie Bartowski (Chuck's older sister), Morgan Pace (Chuck's best friend), and Kayla Hart (Chuck's neighbor and love interest), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Development Update: Friday, March 16 | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=7327 | work=The Futon Critic | date = March 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kayla Hart character was dropped before filming because creators [[Chris Fedak]] and [[Josh Schwartz]] found it unlikely and too complicated to the storyline that two women would be pining over Chuck. Morgan's surname was later changed to &quot;Grimes&quot; and Sarah's surname was changed to &quot;Walker&quot;.

===Filming locations===

Although Chuck's apartment is set in [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], the pilot was shot in [[El Cabrillo]] in Hollywood.  After the series was picked up, the apartment and the building's courtyard were re-created on a [[Warner Bros.]] soundstage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = NBC star &quot;Chuck&quot; lives it up in old Hollywood | url = http://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/09/television-chuck-dc-idUSN0863317120071112 | work=Reuters/Hollywood Reporter | date = November 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aerial views throughout the show combine shots of Echo Park and El Cabrillo.

==Reception==
===Ratings===
[[File:Chuck U.S. viewers.png|thumb|right|upright=2.0|U.S. viewers for each episode in the series, broken down into its four seasons.]]
Despite heavy promotion from NBC and positive critical reviews, ''Chuck'' has suffered in domestic ratings due to stiff competition of established hits from ABC (''[[Dancing with the Stars]]''), FOX (''[[House (TV series)|House]]''), and CBS (''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'', ''[[Rules of Engagement (TV series)|Rules of Engagement]]'') in the Monday 8:00â9:00&amp;nbsp;pm ET timeslot. Its ratings have also been affected by the [[2007â2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] in the first season and President [[Barack Obama]]'s prime time news conference that led to the show being preempted for a week in the second season, shortly after NBC had done heavy promotion for the show around the Super Bowl. In May 2010, it was reported that ''Chuck'' ranked in the top 20 TV shows in the SocialSenseTV ratings report of social media interactions, measuring posts and reads on forums, blogs, and other social media over a three-month period.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialmedia&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Szalai | first = Georg | date = May 18, 2010 | url = http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i6478fc41cf5464a54648a57b4cf28e6f | title = 'Lost' tops social media interactions chart | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | accessdate = May 18, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
Early reviews for ''Chuck'' were strong.  ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine included the show on its fall 2007 &quot;We Like to Watch&quot; list, saying the show &quot;wipes the floor with the other fall debuts.&quot;&lt;ref name=Sheffield&gt;Sheffield, Rob (September 20, 2007), &quot;We Like to Watch&quot;. ''Rolling Stone'' (1035):44&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Chuck'' landed on ''USA Today'''s list of the &quot;10 Picks for 2007&quot;, and they called Levi's performance &quot;incredibly winning&quot;, giving the comedy three-out-of-four stars.&lt;ref name=Bianco&gt;Bianco, Robert (September 7, 2007) &quot;10 picks for 2007&quot;. ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bianco, Robert  (September 24, 2007), &quot;'Chuck' comes to fall season's rescue&quot;. ''USA Today''.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Chuck'' drew numerous comparisons to another critically acclaimed comedy that debuted in Fall 2007â''[[Reaper (TV show)|Reaper]]''âwhich also starred a twenty-something underachiever who works in a large retail, &quot;[[big-box store|big-box]]&quot; store (Work Bench) and is drawn into heroism against his will.&lt;ref name=Sheffield/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bianco/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Flynn, Gillian (September 28, 2007). &quot;Geek Squad&quot;.

The ''Chicago Tribune'''s Maureen Ryan wrote that &quot;the show pays attention to the mechanics of storytelling and doesn't just try to coast on the comedy.&quot;  She continued, &quot;[Given] the level of attention paid to all those other thingsâemotion, suspense, plotting, characterâ''Chuck'' ends up being one of the TV scene's greatest pleasures at the moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ct090223&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first = Maureen | last = Ryan | url = http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2009/02/chuck-nbc-zachary-levi.html | title = Please, think of the children!

Going into 2010, Aaron Barnhart of the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' described the show's premise as &quot;fresh, appealing and limited&quot;, expressing concern that &quot;a lot of TV shows overstay their welcome&quot; and fearing that in its third season the show is &quot;about to run out of new, workable ideas&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Aaron |last=Barnhart |work=Kansas City Star |title=We saved 'Chuck'; Now what? |url=http://www.kansascity.com/entertainment/columnists/aaron_barnhart/story/1672315.html |date=January 8, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[USA Today]]'' called the show NBC's &quot;best scripted hour.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Bianco | first = Robert | date = January 8, 2010 | title = Critic's Corner Weekend: 'Simpsons' gala, 'Chuck' |work=USA Today | url = http://www.usatoday.com/life/columnist/criticscorner/2010-01-07-critics-corner_N.htm | accessdate = January 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[SLANT Magazine]]'' bemoaned Season 3's reinstatement of Chuck and Sarah's relationship, saying &quot;as it stands the situation with Chuck and Sarah is worn down, tired, and typical,&quot; though he added &quot;with a show as genuinely enjoyable as Chuck, status quo is far from a death sentence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = King | first = Kris | date = January 10, 2010 | url = http://www.slantmagazine.com/tv/tv_review.asp?ID=138 | title = Chuck: Season Three | work=[[Slant Magazine]] | accessdate = January 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Campaign for series renewal, 2009===
Despite being one of the first series to be renewed by NBC for the 2008â2009 television season, ''Chuck'' was classified as a show &quot;on the bubble&quot; between renewal and cancellation in April 2009 after NBC decided to delay its decision on its renewal for a third season until early May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Heroes, Chuck and Life Renewed by NBC | url=http://au.tv.ign.com/articles/852/852011p1.html | date=February 13, 2008 | work=IGN | accessdate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfc-2009apr20&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Goodman | first=Tim | title=Networks to burst bubbles after dreadful season | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2009/04/19/DDKU174TKF.DTL | date=April 20, 2009 | work=San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Wagner | first=Curt | title=NBC rep says 'Chuck' decision coming in May | url=http://weblogs.redeyechicago.com/showpatrol/2009/04/nbc-rep-says-chuck-decision-coming-in-may.html | date=April 24, 2009 | work=RedEye | accessdate=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's second season did not improve on or maintain the audience numbers received in the first season and has consistently obtained low ratings, making it one of the least-watched shows in its Monday 8:00&amp;nbsp;pm ET timeslot.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfc-2009apr20&quot;/&gt; Concerned that the show would not be renewed for a third season, fans launched a &quot;Save Chuck&quot; campaign that gained momentum with the use of social-networking websites like Twitter and Facebook.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-2009apr30&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=France | first=Lisa Respers | title='Save Chuck' latest in campaigns to rescue favorite shows | url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/04/30/save.chuck.show/ | date=April 30, 2009 |publisher=CNN | accessdate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fansite ChuckTV.net launched the first organized fan effort, the Watch/Buy/Share campaign (an idea thought up by &quot;Chuck, vs the podcast&quot; founder [http://chuck-nbc.wikia.com/wiki/Gray_Jones Gray Jones]), on March 18, 2009; a letter writing campaign was later added to the effort.&lt;ref name=&quot;chucktv-2009mar18&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=ChuckTV.net | title=Chuck Campaign: Watch/Buy/Share | url=http://chucktv.net/about-2/chuck-campaign-watchbuyshare/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The week of April 6, 2009, television blogger Kath Skerry changed the name of her website GiveMeMyRemote.com to GiveMeMyChuck.com and used Twitter to notify her readers to support the show, prompting television columnists Alan Sepinwall of ''[[The Star-Ledger]]'', Maureen Ryan of ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' and Josef Adalian of ''[[TelevisionWeek]]'' to write ''Chuck''-related news on their websites and Twitter feeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Adalian | first=Josef | title=Adalian Column: Can Twittersphere Save 'Chuck'? | url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2009/04/adalian_column_can_twittersphe.php | date=April 10, 2009 | work=TelevisionWeek | accessdate=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sepinwall also wrote an open letter to NBC on reasons for renewal, while Ryan encouraged fan support by listing the various ways in which they could contribute to the campaign to save ''Chuck''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Sepinwall | first=Alan | title=Chuck: An open letter to NBC to save it â Sepinwall on TV | url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/04/chuck_an_open_letter_to_nbc_to.html | date=April 20, 2009 | work=The Star-Ledger | accessdate=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Ryan | first=Maureen | title=Nerd Herd and fans, it's time to rescue 'Chuck' | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-tc-tvcolumn-chuck-0419-0420_apr20,0,257525.story | date=April 20, 2009 | work=Chicago Tribune | accessdate=April 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One fan, Wendy Farrington, was inspired by a product placement in second season episodes to organize a campaign to purchase &quot;Footlong&quot; [[submarine sandwich]]es from [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] on the air date of the second season finale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=York | first=Emily bryson | title=Subway Caught Up in Fan Effort to Save NBC Series 'Chuck' | url=http://adage.com/madisonandvine/article?article_id=136301 | date=April 27, 2009 | work=Advertising Age | accessdate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This movement gained support from various cast and crew members, with actor [[Zachary Levi]] seen leading hundreds of fans to a Subway restaurant in [[Birmingham]], England.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-2009apr30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Bahar | first=Narin | title=Chuck flashmob hits Birmingham | url=http://www.sfx.co.uk/page/sfx?entry=blog_chuck_flashmob_hits_birmingham | date=April 27, 2009 | work=SFX | accessdate=April 28, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the show's cast and crew participated in a special &quot;rally cry&quot; episode of Chuck vs the Podcast on April 24, 2009, just before the season finale, to encourage fans to keep the campaign going and thank them for their support.&lt;ref name=&quot;chuckpodcast-2009apr24&quot;&gt;{{cite web | work=Chuck vs the Podcast | title=Episode 020 â Itâs Rally Time | url=http://www.chuckpodcast.com/episode-020-its-rally-time/}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the campaign, co-creator [[Josh Schwartz]] remarked that it &quot;has been one of the most amazing experiences of [his] life to witnessâand certainly the most creatively gratifying&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Mitovich | first=Matt | title=Will Chuck's Mad New Skills Save the Show? | url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Chuck-interview-Schwartz-1005538.aspx | date=April 28, 2009 | work=TV Guide | accessdate=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fan efforts include the &quot;Have a Heart, Renew ''Chuck''&quot; campaign, involving ''Chuck'' fans donating money to the [[American Heart Association]] on behalf of NBC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Have a Heart, Renew Chuck | url = http://zachary-levi.com/2009/05/06/%E2%80%9Chave-a-heart-renew-chuck%E2%80%9D-campaign/ | work=zachari-levi.com | date = May 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Have a Heart, Renew Chuck Campaign | url = http://chucktv.net/2009/05/05/have-a-heart-renew-chuck-campaign/ | work=ChuckTV.net | date = May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the NBC [[upfront]] on May 19, 2009 over $17,000 was raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://weheartchuck.blogspot.com  | title = We Heart Chuck}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | date = May 6, 2009 | url = http://remote.lohudblogs.com/2009/05/06/chuck-fans-have-a-heart/ | title = Chuck fans 'Have a heart,' take Save Chuck campaign to another level | work=Remote Access | first = Brian | last = Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign also prompted press and media coverage, with ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' calling ''Chuck'' the &quot;most discussed bubble show online&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Andreeva | first=Nellie | title=Crunch time for bubble series | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9adb8751e5603b1d298a709ac8c6d7d1 | date=April 19, 2009 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | accessdate=April 30, 2009 }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linda Holmes, writing for [[National Public Radio|NPR]], noted the support the campaign has received from both fans and critics, and comments: &quot;It's very common for chasms to open between critics and viewers...

===Series renewal, 2010===
{{Confusing|section|date=April 2010}}
Questions about the series' continued viability began before the third season aired.  Just hours before the third season premiere, when asked whether NBC suddenly moving [[Jay Leno]] out of primetime lowered the bar for ''Chuck'', NBC chairman Jeff Gaspin replied, &quot;I wouldn't say the bar's lower, but we obviously have less choice at the moment, so he's got a better shot.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Sepinwall-2010jan10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |first=Alan |last=Sepinwall |title=Press tour: NBC moving Jay Leno out of primetime, wants to keep Conan and Fallon |url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2010/01/press_tour_nbc_moving_jay_leno.html |work=TV with Alan Sepinwall |publisher=The Star-Ledger |date=January 10, 2010 |accessdate=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked about the series' chances of being renewed for a fourth season and whether fans would have to step in again, Angela Bromstad replied, &quot;Well, it's got to maintain, and it depends on development,&quot; but said that the show is a &quot;pleasant surprise, and they're doing great work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thrfeed.com/2010/03/qa-nbcs-angela-bromstad.html | title = NBC's Bromstad on fall pilots, 'Chuck,' 'Heroes | work=The Live Feed | date = March 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ratings for ''Chuck'' slipped, falling to a series-low 1.9 demo for two weeks running as of the 11th episode of the season, &quot;[[Chuck Versus the Final Exam]].&quot;  The &quot;TV By The Numbers&quot; website reported on March 23, 2010 that this was &quot;below the ratings level that would indicate likely renewal now&quot; despite the overall ratings difficulties that NBC was facing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/03/23/chuck-hit-the-panic-button/45746 | title = ''Chuck'': Hit The Panic Button | work=TV By The Numbers | date = March 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on March 30, 2010, the season's 12th episode, &quot;[[Chuck Versus the American Hero]]&quot; saw an increase to a 2.1 share and a 0.2&amp;nbsp;million viewer rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvbythenumbers.com/2010/04/27/chucks-return-pleases-fans-will-its-ratings/49752 | title = ''Chuck's''; Return Pleases Fans, Will Its Ratings? | work=TV By The Numbers | date = May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chuck'' was also a contestant in E!'s online Save One Show contest for the second year running, where it won with 52% of the vote. The runner up was [[One Tree Hill (TV series)|''One Tree Hill'']], which garnered 20% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b175535_save_one_show_we_have_winner.html | title = Save One Show: We have a Winner | work=E!

On May 13, 2010, it was announced that ''Chuck'' had been renewed by NBC for a fourth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://chucktv.net/2010/05/14/friday-five-ways-to-celebrate-season-4/ | title = Five ways to celebrate Chuck season 4 | work=ChuckTV | date = May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season received a 13-episode order with an option of an additional nine episodes.

Speculating on the possibility of a fifth season, [[Yvonne Strahovski]] (Sarah Walker), commented that she felt &quot;...[the chances] are pretty good, I will be surprised if we don't get a season five.&quot; Her co-star Adam Baldwin (John Casey) concurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/watch_with_kristin/b229773_spoiler_chat_which_true_blood_twosome.html|title=Spoiler Chat: Which True Blood Twosome Can Expect Major Angst This Season?|last=Team WWK|date=Mar. 7, 2011|publisher=EOnline|accessdate=April 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcast history===
{{Main|List of Chuck episodes}}
The first showing of the pilot occurred on July 27, 2007 at [[Comic-Con International]] in San Diego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Full Comic-Con Schedule Online! |url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=21812 |publisher=ComingSoon.net |date=July 9, 2007 |accessdate=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series was originally slated to air on Tuesday nights at 9/8c as announced at the 2007 [[Upfronts]] but this was later changed to Monday nights at 8/7c as announced during the 2007 [[Television Critics Association]] summer press tour. The season premiere aired on September 24, 2007 on [[NBC]].&lt;ref name=&quot;timeslot1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = NBC delivers the quality once again this fall, introducing five ambitious new dramas, an inventive comedy and a variety of innovative unscripted programs for its 2007â08 primetime schedule | url = http://www.thefutoncritic.com/news.aspx?id=20070514nbc01 | work=The Futon Critic | date = May 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pilot was leaked onto [[BitTorrent (protocol)|torrent]] websites on July 22, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/massive-leak-of-pre-air-tv-shows-piracy-or-promotion/ |publisher=TorrentFreak |title=Massive Leak of Pre-Air TV Shows: Piracy or Promotion? |date=July 24, 2007 |accessdate=July 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; All thirteen episodes produced before the [[2007 Writers Guild of America strike]] have aired. The last two episodes of the original thirteen aired on January 24, 2008, with episode 12 airing at 8/7c and episode 13 at 10/9c, three days after they aired in Canada.

Despite receiving a full season pickup, the first season contained only thirteen episodes; production was stalled due to the [[2007â2008 Writers Guild of America strike]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Schneider |first=Michael | title=NBC orders full seasons up | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117976563.html | work=Variety |date=November 26, 2007 | accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Kissell |first=Rick | title=Will audiences return post-strike? | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117981006.html | work=Variety |date=February 15, 2008 | accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season Two premiered on September 29, 2008. While the series originally had a 13 episode order, NBC ordered another nine, ensuring the series would get the full 22-episode treatment.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvweek-2008aug27&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Adalian |first=Josef | title=NBC Goes All the Way With 'Chuck' | url=http://www.tvweek.com/news/2008/08/nbc_goes_all_the_way_with_chuc.php | work=TVWeek.com |date=August 27, 2008 | accessdate=May 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theme song is &quot;[[Short Skirt/Long Jacket]]&quot; by [[Cake (band)|Cake]].

On February 2, 2009, ''Chuck'' broadcast a full-length [[3D television]] episode.  The episode was broadcast using the [[ColorCode 3D]] stereoscopy system, and could be viewed by wearing a pair of glasses distributed as part of a national promotion for the movie &quot;[[Monsters Vs.

Season 3 episodes (with commercials) are available the morning after US broadcast at the [[NBC]], [[Hulu]], [[IMDb]] (low definition Hulu), and Fancast web sites. In an aggressive marketing campaign by NBC, the pilot episode was released across a broad range of media from [[satellite broadcasting]] to popular [[social networking]] websites such as Facebook, shown on [[United Airlines]] flights, freely distributed on [[video on demand]] on about 30 cable and satellite systems including [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cox Communications]] and [[Dish Network]], on [[Yahoo]], and from [[Amazon Unbox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Schiller|first=Gail |title=New media, new ideas tout shows for fall |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i3183b40c3b46a9387051a4bbf46641a8 |publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=August 27, 2007 |accessdate=August 27, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070902225952/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3i3183b40c3b46a9387051a4bbf46641a8 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = September 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
