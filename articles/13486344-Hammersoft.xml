The '''Spain women's national basketball team''' represents Spain in international basketball competitions for women. The team has participated in the [[FIBA World Championship for Women]] since 1994.

==History==
After winning the [[EuroBasket 1993 Women]], in 1994 the female selection of the Spanish team qualified for the [[FIBA World Championship for Women]] for the first time. Since then, the team qualified for every World Championship. Overall, Spain finished 8th in [[1994 FIBA World Championship for Women|Australia]], and two consecutive 5th in [[1998 FIBA World Championship for Women|Germany]] and [[2002 FIBA World Championship for Women|China]], and 8th in [[2006 FIBA World Championship for Women|Brazil]] 2006. These results are quite commendable, considering that Spain has only competed with the world elite for 12 years. The female section of the Spanish team is ranked No. 5 in the ranking of FIBA. 

At the [[EuroBasket Women]], besides the gold in [[EuroBasket 1993 Women|1993]], the Spanish selection won silver in [[EuroBasket Women|2007]] and three consecutive bronze medals in [[EuroBasket 2001 Women|2001]], [[EuroBasket 2003 Women|2003]] and [[EuroBasket 2005 Women|2005]]. 

At the [[Basketball at the Mediterranean Games|Mediterranean Games]], Spain won gold in [[1991 Mediterranean Games|1991]], and bronze in [[1993 Mediterranean Games|1993]], [[2001 Mediterranean Games|2001]] and [[Basketball at the 2005 Mediterranean Games|2005]].
