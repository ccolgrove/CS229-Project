'''Flavio Roma''' (born 21 June 1974) is an [[Italians|Italian]] [[Association football|footballer]] who plays as a [[Goalkeeper (association football)|goalkeeper]] for [[Serie A]] club [[A.C. Milan|Milan]].

==Club career==
Roma started his career in the youth teams of [[S.S. Lazio]]. He was the 3rd goalkeeper behind [[Luca Marchegiani]] and [[Fernando Orsi]] before leaving the club to play for clubs in [[Serie B]] and [[Serie C1]]. In 1999 he was signed by the [[Serie A]] side [[Piacenza Calcio|Piacenza]] as part of [[Simone Inzaghi]]'s deal, replacing [[Valerio Fiori]] as the first choice in his role, but the team got relegated at the end of season.

===Monaco===
In 2001 he was signed by [[AS Monaco FC]], then coached by [[Didier Deschamps]], where he constantly was the first choice goalkeeper ahead of [[Tony Sylva]] and [[StÃ©phane Porato]] until the 2008â09 season, when he lost his place to [[StÃ©phane Ruffier]]. He was also in the squad that played the [[2004 UEFA Champions League Final]]. During his stay at Monaco, he only missed 3 months in the 2005â06 season due to injuries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/uefacup/news/kind=1/newsid=337502.html|title=More Roma therapy for Monaco|date=2005-09-09|accessdate=2009-08-13|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a shoulder injury ruled him out of the second half of the 2001â02 season in February 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/footballeurope/news/kind=2/newsid=16840.html|title=Monaco wait on Roma results|date=2002-02-04|accessdate=2009-08-13|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milan===
On 12 August 2009, he signed a 1-year contract with [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] to replace [[Å½eljko Kalac]] who was released by the club on mutual consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/ucl/news/kind=1/newsid=872413.html|title=Roma boosts Milan options|date=2009-08-13|accessdate=2009-08-13|publisher=UEFA.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roma was expected to compete for the starting position with [[Marco Storari]] while [[Christian Abbiati]] and [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]] were recovering from injury, but the manager [[Leonardo AraÃºjo|Leonardo]] preferred Storari and after Storari injury preferred [[Dida (goalkeeper)|Dida]]. In January 2010, Storari left for Sampdoria and Abbiati was recovered from injury, making Roma the third goalkeeper. After the season, his contract was extended to undisclosed length and will complete the first choice with [[Marco Amelia]] and Abbiati.
In 2011, Roma started in two matches in [[Coppa Italia]] against [[A.S. Bari|Bari]] and [[Sampdoria]], getting a clean sheet against Bari, and conceding only 1 goal in an away game against Sampdoria

On 17 May 2011, Milan announced that Roma extended his contract for 1 more year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.acmilan.com/it/news/breaking_news_show/10367|title=A.C. MILAN COMUNICATO UFFICIALE|date=17 May 2011|accessdate=18 May 2011|work=AC Milan|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International career==
Roma received his first call-up for [[Italy national football team|Italy]] on 17 November 2004 for a friendly game as [[Marcello Lippi]] was trying to identify a backup goalkeeper for [[Gianluigi Buffon]]. He made his debut on 30 March 2005 in a friendly match (that ended with a 0â0 draw) with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] replacing [[Morgan De Sanctis]] at half-time. He played his first full match on 11 June 2005 against [[Ecuador national football team|Ecuador]]. Due to injuries, Roma was not called up for warm-up friendlies ahead of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]]. Roma received his last call-up to date on 16 August 2006, Italy's first game after the 2006 FIFA World Cup.
