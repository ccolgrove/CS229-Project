'''WSAZ-DT2''' is the primary [[MyNetworkTV]] and secondary [[This TV]] [[television station]] for [[Huntington, West Virginia|Huntington]] and [[Charleston, West Virginia]], the second-largest [[media market|market]] in terms of area east of the [[Mississippi River]]. It is a second [[digital subchannel]] of [[NBC]] affiliate [[WSAZ-TV]] which is owned by [[Gray Television]]. Over-the-air, the station broadcasts a [[standard definition]] digital signal on [[UHF]] channel 23.2 (or [[virtual channel]] 3.2 via [[PSIP]]) from a transmitter on Barkers Ridge Road in [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] Northeastern [[Cabell County, West Virginia]]. WSAZ-DT2 can also be seen on [[Suddenlink Communications|Suddenlink]] channel 2 as well as [[Time Warner Cable]] and [[Comcast]] channel 17. 

Its parent has studios on Fifth Avenue/[[U.S. Route 60|US 60]] in Downtown Huntington and operates secondary facilities on Columbia Avenue in Charleston along [[Interstate 64 in West Virginia|I-64]]/[[U.S. Route 119|US 119]] and U.S. 60. [[television syndication|Syndicated]] programming on the station includes ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[TMZ on TV]]'', ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]'', and ''[[Cash Cab (U.S. game show)|Cash Cab]]'' among others. The origin of WSAZ-DT2 was back on January 24, 2006 when [[The WB]] and [[UPN]] announced the two networks would end broadcasting and merge. The new combined service would be called [[The CW]]. The letters would represent the first initial of corporate parents [[CBS|&quot;C&quot;BS]] (the parent company of UPN) and the [[Warner Bros.|&quot;W&quot;arner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]]. 

On February 22, [[News Corporation]] announced it would start up another new network called MyNetworkTV. This new service, which would be a sister network to [[Fox Network|Fox]], would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]]. MyNetworkTV was created in order to give UPN and WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming [[Independent station (North America)|Independent]]. It was also created to compete against The CW. On March 9, UPN affiliate WHCP (now [[WQCW]]) agreed to become part of The CW. 

MyNetworkTV launched on September 5 and WSAZ created this second digital subchannel to be the area's affiliate. WQCW officially joined The CW when it launched on September 18. From its launch until some point in time, WSAZ-DT2 was been affiliated [[The Sportsman Channel]] until the network was dropped and This TV was added as a replacement. Over time, the station also began airing more syndicated programming.

===Newscasts===
[[Image:Wzaz dt2 open.png|thumb|right|Nightly news open.]]

WSAZ produces a nightly prime time newscast on this station called ''MyZTV Ten O'clock News''. The show competes with the area's only sixty minute news on Fox affiliate [[WVAH-TV]] (produced by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] affiliate [[WCHS-TV]]). On weeknights, the news segment of WSAZ-DT2's show originates from the Charleston studios. At one point in time, there was also a one hour weekday morning show on the station. Known as ''Your Day on MyZTV'', this newscast competed with WVAH's sixty minute broadcast airing at the same time. 

It was dropped after the show's news anchor resigned from the station. WSAZ-DT2 currently repeats the second hour of WSAZ's weekday morning newscast (called ''WSAZ NewsChannel 3 Today'') at 7 and its noon broadcast (known as ''WSAZ NewsChannel 3 Midday'') at 12:30. Although its parent station upgraded local newscasts to high definition on June 26, 2011, broadcasts remain in pillar-boxed [[4:3]] standard definition because WSAZ-DT2 only airs in that digital format.
