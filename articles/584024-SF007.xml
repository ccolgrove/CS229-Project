'''GStreamer''' is a [[Pipeline (computing)|pipeline]]-based [[multimedia framework]] written in the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]] with the [[type system]] based on [[GObject]].

GStreamer allows a programmer to create a variety of media-handling components, including simple [[Audio frequency|audio]] playback, audio and video playback, [[recording]], [[Streaming media|streaming]] and editing. The pipeline design serves as a base to create many types of  [[multimedia]] applications such as [[Video editing|video editors]], streaming media broadcasters, and [[Media player (application software)|media players]].

Designed to be [[cross-platform]], it is known to work on [[Linux]] ([[x86]], [[PowerPC]] and [[ARM architecture|ARM]]), [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] (Intel and [[SPARC]]) and [[OpenSolaris]], [[FreeBSD]], [[OpenBSD]], [[NetBSD]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[OS/400]]. GStreamer has [[Language binding|bindings]] for programming-languages like [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]], [[C++]], [[Perl]], [[GNU Guile]] and [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]]. GStreamer is licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/documentation/licensing.html |title=

==Distribution==
The [[GNOME]] [[desktop environment]], the primary user of GStreamer technology, has included GStreamer since GNOME version 2.2 and encourages GNOME and [[GTK+]] applications to use it. Other projects also use or support it, such as the [[Chameleo (software)|Chameleo]] media platform, the [[Phonon (KDE)|Phonon]] media framework and the [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]] media player.

GStreamer also operates in embedded devices like the [[Palm Pre]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Nokia 770]], [[Nokia N800|N800]], [[Nokia N810|N810]] and [[Nokia N900|N900]] Internet Tablets running the [[Maemo]] operating system.

==History and development==

Erik Walthinsen founded the GStreamer project in 1999. Many of its core design ideas came from a research project at the [[Oregon Graduate Institute]]. [[Wim Taymans]] joined the project soon thereafter and greatly expanded on many aspects of the system. Many others around the world have contributed to various degrees since then.

The first major release was 0.1.0 which was announced on 11 January 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;0.1.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?thread_name=Pine.LNX.4.21.0101101700180.17206-100000%40alpha.temple-baptist.com&amp;forum_name=gstreamer-announce |title=GStreamer &quot;Slipstream&quot; 0.1.0 released |date=11-01-2001 |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Not long after, GStreamer picked up its first commercial backer, an [[embedded Linux]] company called RidgeRun. Towards the end of January 2001, they hired Erik Walthinsen to develop methods for embedding GStreamer in smaller ([[cell phone]]-class) devices. Another RidgeRun employee, Brock A. Frazier, designed the GStreamer logo. RidgeRun later ran into financial trouble and had to let its staff go, including Erik Walthinsen. GStreamer progress was mostly unaffected.

The project released a series of major releases with 0.2.0 coming out in July 2001, 0.4.0 in September 2002, and 0.8.0 in March 2004. During that period the project also changed its versioning strategy and while the first releases were simply new versions, later on the middle number started signifying release series. This meant the project did release a string of 0.6.x and 0.8.x releases which was meant to stay [[binary compatible]] within those release series. Erik Walthinsen more or less left GStreamer development behind during this time as he went on to focus on other ventures.

During the 0.8.x release series, the project faced some difficulties. The 0.8.x series was not very popular in the Linux community mostly because of stability issues and a serious lack of features compared to competing projects like [[Xine]], [[MPlayer]] or [[VLC]]. The project also suffered a bit in terms of lack of leadership as Wim Taymans, who had been the project lead since Erik Walthinsen had left, had also mostly ceased active participation.

In 2004, a new company was founded, [[Fluendo]], which wanted to use GStreamer to write a streaming server [[Flumotion]] and also provide multimedia solutions for GStreamer.  During this time, Fluendo hired most of the core developers including Wim Taymans and attracted the support of companies such as [[Nokia]] and [[Intel]] to bring GStreamer to a professional level and drive community adoption. With Wim Taymans back at the helm, the core of GStreamer was redesigned and became what is the current 0.10.x series, which had its first release in December 2005.

With a new stable core in place, GStreamer gained in popularity in 2006, being used by media players including [[Totem (media player)|Totem]], [[Rhythmbox]] and [[Banshee (music player)|Banshee]] with many more to follow.

In 2007, most of the core GStreamer developers left Fluendo, including GStreamer maintainer Wim Taymans who went on to co-found [[Collabora|Collabora Multimedia]] together with other GStreamer veterans, while others joined [[Sun Microsystems]], [[Oblong (company)|Oblong]] and [[Songbird (software)|Songbird]].

GStreamer has also continued seeing both open source and commercial success and adoption by many different corporations ([[Nokia]], [[Motorola]], [[Texas Instruments]], [[Freescale Semiconductor|Freescale]], [[Tandberg]], [[Intel]] and many more) and has become a very powerful cross platform multimedia framework.

[[freedesktop.org]] hosts the GStreamer project, which accordingly aims to improve interoperability and to share technology between free desktops. Since 2005 Wim Taymans has maintained GStreamer.

The stable release series began with the 0.10.0 release in December 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;release0.10&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/news/#2005-12-05T18:59:00Z |title=GStreamer 0.10.0 stable release - Announcement of the first release in 0.10 stable series |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has maintained [[API]] and [[Application binary interface|ABI]] compatibility since.

The GStreamer community is currently deciding on when to fork for a new development series and aim to release GStreamer 1.0.&lt;ref name=&quot;GStreamer 1.0&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Technical overview==
[[Image:GStreamer Technical Overview.svg|right]]
GStreamer processes media by connecting a number of processing ''elements'' into a ''pipeline''. Each element is provided by a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]]. Elements can be grouped into ''bins'', which can be further aggregated, thus forming a hierarchical graph. This is an example of a [[filter graph]].

Elements communicate by means of ''pads''. A ''source pad'' on one element can be connected to a ''sink pad'' on another. When the pipeline is in the ''playing'' state, data ''buffers'' flow from the source pad to the sink pad. Pads negotiate the kind of data that will be sent using ''capabilities''.

The diagram to the above-right could exemplify playing an [[MP3]] file using GStreamer. The file source reads an MP3 file from a computer's hard-drive and sends it to the MP3 decoder. The decoder decodes the file data and converts it into [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]] samples which then pass to the [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]] sound-driver. The ALSA sound-driver sends the PCM sound samples to the computer's speakers.

GStreamer uses a [[Plug-in (computing)|plug-in]] architecture which makes the most of GStreamer's functionality implemented as [[Library (computer science)|shared libraries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/ |title=GStreamer â Overview of the modules |accessdate=6 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GStreamer's base functionality contains functions for registering and loading plug-ins and for providing the fundamentals of all classes in the form of [[base class]]es. Plug-in libraries get dynamically loaded to support a wide spectrum of [[codec]]s, [[container format]]s, [[Device driver|input/output drivers]] and effects.

Plug-ins can be installed semi-automatically when they are first needed. For that purpose distributions can register a backend that resolves feature-descriptions to package-names.

Since version 0.10, the plug-ins come grouped into three sets (named after the film ''[[The Good, the Bad and the Ugly]]''),

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Plug-in set name
! Description
|-
| Good
| This package contains the GStreamer plug-ins from the &quot;good&quot; set, a set of high quality plug-ins under the LGPL license,&lt;ref&gt;gstreamer0.10-plugins-good package description (Ubuntu 10.04)&lt;/ref&gt; or according to Gstreamer, &quot;contains a set of well-supported plug-ins under our preferred license&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/gst-plugins-base/0.10.0.html |title=Release notes for GStreamer Base Plug-ins 0.10.0 |accessdate=3 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Bad
| GStreamer Bad Plug-ins comprises a set of plug-ins not up-to-par compared to the rest. They might closely approach good-quality plug-ins, but they lack something: perhaps a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.&lt;ref&gt;gstreamer0.10-plugins-bad package description (Ubuntu 10.04)&lt;/ref&gt;
|-
| Ugly
| This package contains plug-ins from the &quot;ugly&quot; set, a set of good-quality plug-ins that might pose distribution problems.&lt;ref&gt;gstreamer0.10-plugins-ugly package description (Ubuntu 10.04)&lt;/ref&gt;
|}

Individual distributions may further sub-classify these plug-ins: for example [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] groups the &quot;bad&quot; and &quot;ugly&quot; sets into the &quot;Universe&quot; or the [[Ubuntu (operating system)#Package classification and support|&quot;Multiverse&quot;]] components.

There's also a separate '''GStreamer FFmpeg plug-in''', which is a [[FFmpeg]]-based plug-in that supports many media formats such as [[MPEG-1]], [[MPEG-2]], [[MPEG-4]], [[H.261]], [[H.263]], [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]], [[RealVideo]], [[MP3]], [[Windows Media Video|WMV]], [[Flash Video|FLV]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/modules/gst-ffmpeg.html GStreamer FFmpeg plug-in]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cgit.freedesktop.org/gstreamer/gst-ffmpeg/tree/ext/ffmpeg/gstffmpegcodecmap.c ext/ffmpeg/gstffmpegcodecmap.c]&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released on 26 February 2004, with version number 0.7.1.&lt;ref name=&quot;news&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gstreamer.freedesktop.org/releases/gst-ffmpeg/0.7.1.html Release notes for GStreamer FFmpeg plugin 0.7.1 &quot;True Colors&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;
