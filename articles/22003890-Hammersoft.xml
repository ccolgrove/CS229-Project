'''16 (Regina) Field Ambulance''' is a [[Canadian Forces]] [[Primary Reserve]] medical unit in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]].

== History ==

This unit has a long and distinguished history that lives up to the medical corps tradition of being faithful in adversity. It is the latest in a line of Saskatchewan army medical units dating back to [[21 Field Ambulance]] of [[World War I]] and [[10 Field Ambulance]] of [[World War II]].

===World War II===
From 1940 to 1941, the unit trained at [[Camp Dundurn]], in preparation for deployment to [[England]].

Once deployed, the unit provided medical services, as well as successfully evacuating thousands of Canadian and Allied units.

===Post-World War II to 1990===

In the early 1970s, the unit was disbanded along with all militia medical units across Canada, but was reformed as a Medical Company, as part of [[16 Service Battalion]], a combat service support unit, based out of [[Regina Garrison]] in [[Regina, Saskatchewan]].

=== 1990 - Present ===

In the early 1990s, the unit received official detachment status for its detachment operating in [[Saskatoon, Saskatchewan]], out of [[Sgt. Hugh Cairns VC Armoury]].

In 2004, the [[Canadian Forces Medical Service]] underwent a reorganization, and 16 Medical Company became its own unit again, and was renamed 16 (Regina) Field Ambulance.

==Royal Canadian Army Cadets==
16 (Regina) Field Ambulance is affiliated with [[328 Royal Canadian Army Medical Cadet Corps]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Saskatoon 328 Army Cadets |url=http://www.328cadets.ca|work=|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jY7jXNl7|archivedate=2009-09-04|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; based in Saskatoon.
