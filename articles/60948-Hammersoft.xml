'''Airdrie''' ({{lang-gd|An t-Ãrd Ruigh}}) is a town within [[North Lanarkshire]], [[Scotland]]. It lies on a [[plateau]] roughly 400&amp;nbsp;ft (130 m) above [[sea level]], and is approximately 12 miles (19&amp;nbsp;km) east of [[Glasgow]] city centre. Airdrie forms part of a conurbation with its neighbour [[Coatbridge]], in the former district known as the [[Monklands (district)|Monklands]]. As of 2006, the town had a population of 36,853.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.northlan.gov.uk/Your+Council/parliaments/scottish+parliament/airdrie+and+shotts+population+profile.html] North Lanarkshire Population Estimates&lt;/ref&gt; [[Airdriehill]], [[Chapelhall]], [[Calderbank]], [[Caldercruix]], [[Glenmavis]], [[Greengairs]], [[Longriggend]], [[Plains, North Lanarkshire|Plains]], Stand, [[Upperton, North Lanarkshire|Upperton]] and [[Wattston]] are generally considered satellite villages of Airdrie.

==Name==
The origin of Airdrie's name is not known for certain; however, given the topography of the area, the most likely interpretation is that it derives from the Gaelic ''An Ãrd Ruigh'' meaning a level height or high pasture land. Another possibility is that it was taken from the Gaelic ''An Ãrd Ãirighe'' meaning a sheiling or wayside town.

==History==
===Early history===
The history of Airdrie might be dated back to AD 577, which was the year of the [[Battle of Arderyth]]&lt;ref&gt;Begg, Ean. &amp; Rich, Deike (1991). ''On the Trail of Merlin''. ISBN 0-85030-939-5&lt;/ref&gt; However, the historicity and location of the battle are the subject of debate and shrouded in myth. The battle was believed to have been between the [[Gododdin]], [[Riderch I of Alt Clut|Rydderych]] ''The Bountiful'', [[King of Strathclyde]], and Aeddam ''The Perfidious'', the [[Scoti]] King of [[Kintyre]]. While few might have heard of the main protagonists, amongst Aeddam's contingent was the legendary [[Celts|Celtic]] [[bard]], [[Merlin]]. The history of Airdrie between the Battle of Arderyth and AD 1162 is unclear, due to the scarcity of written historical records.

===1162 to 1850===
[[File:Pontmap2b.jpg|thumb|right|205px|[[Timothy Pont|Pont's]] &quot;Nether Warde of Clyds-dail&quot; map c.1654 depicting Ardry (Airdrie), Burnfyd (Burnfoot), Carnhil (Cairnhill), Gartly (Gartlea), and Ruchsols (Rochsoles) amongst others.]] Airdrie owes its existence to its location on the 'Hogs Back' - a ridge of land running from east to west. One very important aspect of the townâs history were the [[Cistercian]] monks of [[Newbattle Abbey]], hence a name for the wider area; Monklands. The monks were farmers and most of the land they used is known today as 'The Four Isles' (a housing estate named after four Scottish islands): [[Isle of Mull|Mull]], [[Islay]], [[Iona]] and [[Luing]] in the Petersburn area of modern Airdrie).  The [[monk]]s of Newbattle had numerous establishments throughout the area including a [[farm]] grange at Drumpellier, Coatbridge, a court house at [[Kipps]], a [[chapel]] in the area of Chapelhall and a number of [[maize|corn]] [[Mill (grinding)|mills]]. The Monks were also expert in the [[construction]] of [[road]]s. In the 12th century they established the original Glasgow to [[Edinburgh]] road via Airdrie and [[Bathgate]], to link up with their lands in Newbattle in [[East Lothian]].

In those days travelling was often dangerous. Horses were still very rare and could only be afforded by the rich. Low lying ground was usually extremely difficult to navigate because of the numerous [[bog]]s, forests and [[Burn (topography)|burns]] - not to mention the possibility of [[ambush]] by a [[footpad]] or robber. Hence, it became much more practical to travel on the high ground (the 'High Way') where one could avoid the mud and the robbers. These roads (or rather tracks) became known as the King's Highway.

Definitive evidence of the existence of Airdrie as a tenantry was only made clear in 1503. The old monks' road was via Cliftonhill (an area now in neighbouring Coatbridge), Airdrie House (now the site of [[Monklands Hospital]]), Aitchison Street, High Street, Hallcraig Street, Flowerhill Street and Colliertree Road.  It was along this road that the first houses in Airdrie were built.  Development was slow and it was only around 1650 that evidence of the number of [[population|inhabitants]] was known at around 500 for the Airdrie area. A large contingent of Airdrieonians fought at the [[Battle of Bothwell Brig]] during the Covenanter Rebellion of 1679; their banner can still be viewed at the local library.

A significant event in Airdrie's history was the [[1695]] passing of a special Act of Parliament in the Scottish Parliament allowing Robert Hamilton of Airdrie to hold four fairs yearly and a weekly market in the town of 'Airdry'. This helped develop Airdrie from a 'farm town' into a thriving 'market town'.

However, Airdrie really came to prominence through its [[weaving]] industry. Airdrie Weavers Society was founded in 1781 and [[flax]] was being grown in sixteen farms in and around the [[burgh]]. In the last decade of the eighteenth century, [[coal mining]] was in progress and around thirty [[Coal mining|colliers]] were employed. Weaving continued to flourish making up a substantial part of the population of over 2,500 around the turn of the 19th century. Given its large number of weavers, its geographic location, and a large number of unemployed soldiers following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]], Airdrie became a major centre of support for the [[Radical War]] of 1820. The rapid pace of population growth continued and by 1821 there were 4,862 inhabitants.  At this time the number of houses being built increased dramatically and in 1821, by a private [[Act of Parliament]], Airdrie became a free and independent [[Burgh of Barony]]. Due to the fact it was 'independent', it had all the powers of a [[Royal burgh|Royal Burgh]].

[[Voting]] in the early part of the nineteenth century was rather hit or miss as not only locals but residents outside the burgh were allowed to vote. In 1821 the first election of a town council took place and by August it had appointed an assessor, [[Procurator Fiscal|procurator fiscal]], master of police and a [[town crier]].

In 1824 it was decided to build the Town House, which was originally designed by Alexander Baird and is now a local landmark known as the 'town clock'. In 1832 the Town House was used as a hospital due to the [[cholera]] outbreak of this year.

By 1850, the population had grown to 12,418.

===1850 to 1920===
The enormous growth in population was not due to high birthrate, but instead due to an influx of residents from the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]] and predominantly [[Ireland]]. This followed the [[Highland Potato Famine|Highland potato famine]] of the mid 1840s and also reflected the change from cottage industry to [[heavy industry]] in the area. Most of the Irish immigrant population were involved with [[mining]] and labouring.
This led to an increase in ironwork [[Foundry|foundries]] around the area. Because of this explosion in industry, [[Rail transport|railway]] links were soon established (circa 1830) and by 1862, the Airdrie and Bathgate Junction Railway provided a direct link to Edinburgh with Airdrie South Station providing the starting point for trains to Glasgow.

In August the [[Public Libraries Act 1850|Public Libraries Act (Scotland) 1853]] was passed, and in November [[Airdrie Public Library]] became the first in Scotland.

The dramatic rise in population and industry prompted the need for more accessible water supplies. Until the mid 1800s, various wells were put in place feeding from surrounding streams in the area. These served to provide many houses with private wells. By 1846 Airdrie and Coatbridge Water Company was founded to construct (along with Forth and Clyde Canal Company) the reservoir at Roughrigg.

Around the mid 1800s, several local [[newspaper]]s began appearing and notably the [[Airdrie &amp; Coatbridge Advertiser]], which is still the most popular local paper today. Also at this time, [[association football|football]] and [[cricket]] began to emerge as popular sports. Following the codification of association football rules a local team called Excelsior was formed in 1878 which would later be renamed [[Airdrieonians F.C.]] Horse race meetings were also held in the town (1851â1870) but this land became the golf course for the newly formed Airdrie Golf Club in 1877.

[[Education]] posed a major problem with severe overcrowding in the few schools available, therefore three new school boards were established. Fees were routinely charged within the schools with the belief they should be self-supporting until a parliamentary act of 1889 relieved some of the infant classes in schools of this burden. [[Airdrie Academy]] was built in 1895 and by 1919 all school boards were dissolved and Lanarkshire Education Authority took over responsibility for education throughout [[Lanarkshire]].

[[Airdrie Public Observatory]], one of only four public observatories in the UK (Second Oldest and Smallest)- all in Scotland, was founded in the first library building in 1896, and is still operated in the present building by the Airdrie Astronomical Association a Scottish [[space exploration|astronautic]] and [[astronomy]] society and registered charity.

By the turn of the century [[variety show]]s were becoming popular in the area and by 1911 the Pavilion in Graham Street was built which after initially being used as a music hall started showing cinematographic pictures. Unfortunately it was destroyed by fire in 1917 but was rebuilt in 1919 and finally closed in 1970. The New Cinema was opened in 1920 in Broomknoll Street but too has since closed. The town had no suitable venue for larger functions so in 1912 the Sir John Wilson Town Hall was opened (following a generous offer from Sir John Wilson covering the total cost of Â£13,500). This still stands and is used for major events in the town.

===1920 onwards===
At the end of the [[World War I|First World War]], Airdrie was hard hit with many casualties from the war. Many inhabitants also chose to emigrate around this time. Consequently the population only rose by 3% to around 26,000 by 1931. The [[Great Depression|depression]] years had made a great impact on the town and several well known manufacturers ceased to exist and few replaced them. It was reported that 50% of the registered population were [[Unemployment|unemployed]]. Church groups tried to provide some comfort for the poor folk in the area and set up educational and work experience projects to help and by 1936 the Airdrie Churches Council had attracted national interest through their work culminating in a building in Graham Street being provided for them (the Mutual Service Club). This is now Airdrie Community Centre.

The current Airdrie Public Library building was eventually constructed on its present site in 1925 after years of moving from one site to another.  [[Image:ASTRA - Airdrie Library Building Anderson Street.JPG|thumb| right| The first Airdrie Public Library building, a [[Carnegie library]] opened 1894.]]

Conditions in the town did not really improve until well after the [[World War II|Second World War]] but in 1949 the [[Boots Group|Boots]] [[Pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical company]] and Banner Textiles Ltd were attracted to the town (between them employing 1200). With this impetus, new companies began to consider Airdrie as a viable option for business and in 1958 [[Pye Ltd.|Pye]] opened employing over 1000 people. The emergence of industrial estates was also prevalent around this time (Newhouse, Chapelhall, and Brownsburn). The Airdrie Arts Centre opened in 1967 in the former Airdrie Library building and remains a popular venue for concerts and plays.

The 1970s saw the opening of [[Monklands Hospital]], which replaced an older hospital on the Airdrie House estate that had been closed in 1962 and demolished in 1964.

===Modern Airdrie===
Airdrie town centre has changed much in the last ten years with a new road scheme and a shift in emphasis with the type of shopping it offers. Graham Street, the main [[pedestrianised]] street, has recently been refurbished and has had the pedestrian precinct area upgraded. New housing complexes are being built around this suitably situated [[commuter town]], notably in Chapelhall, Rochsoles and Glenmavis, the former Boots factory site in Rawyards and the former Imperial Tube Works in Cairnhill.

Airdrie also has signage in the Scots Gaelic language around the town centre, (alongside English) this was first introduced for the 1993 [[Royal National Mod]]. The signs were originally erected by Monklands District Council, but have been maintained by North Lanarkshire Council.

For the purposes of the [[Scottish Parliament]], Airdrie forms part of the [[Airdrie and Shotts (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Airdrie and Shotts]] constituency.  This has slightly different boundaries than that of the UK Parliament constituency of the same name.  The current member of the [[Scottish Parliament]] for [[Airdrie and Shotts (Scottish Parliament constituency)|Airdrie and Shotts]] is [[Alex Neil MSP]] ([[Scottish National Party]]), who won this seat in the 2011 Scottish Parliament from the LAbour Party who had  held the seat since the instatement of the Scottish Parliament in 1999.

In addition to this Airdrie is represented by seven [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|regional MSPs]] from the [[Central Scotland (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Central Scotland electoral region]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottish.parliament.uk/msp/map/central.html|publisher=scottish.parliament.uk|title=Central Scotland Regional MSPs|accessdate=2008-05-28|date=}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are: [[Linda Fabiani]] ([[Scottish National Party]], SNP), [[Jamie Hepburn]] (SNP), [[Christina McKelvie]] (SNP), [[Margaret Mitchell]] ([[Scottish Conservative Party]]), [[Alex Neil MSP|Alex Neil]] (SNP), [[Hugh O'Donnell (politician)|Hugh O'Donnell]] ([[Scottish Liberal Democrats]]), and [[John Wilson (Scottish politician)|John Wilson]] (SNP).

===Local government===
Up until 1975, Airdrie had its own [[Burgh Council]]. Between 1975 and 1996, Airdrie came under [[Monklands (district)|Monklands District Council]] operating in conjunction with [[Strathclyde|Strathclyde Regional Council]]. Monklands District Council was headquartered in the Coatbridge Municipal Building. Many Airdrieonians felt short-changed by MDC's actions and a significant political scandal known as [[Monklandsgate]] greatly tarnished the Council's reputation. After 1996, it came under the authority of the unitary [[North Lanarkshire|North Lanarkshire Council]]. Currently, the council is in control of the Labour group and the leader of the council is [[Jim McCabe]], councillor for Thorniewood.

==Economy==
===Overview===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Airdriesavingsbank.jpg|thumb|right|Airdrie Savings Bank]] --&gt;
As outlined in the history section Airdrie's traditional economic activities of weaving, coal mining, and heavy industry have ceased to exist. Whilst the [[Glenflagler]] Distillery is now closed the town still retains a strong involvement in the [[whisky]] industry. It is fair to say that, given its location near to Glasgow and other commercial or industrial areas, Airdrie might now be considered something of a commuter town. In fact housing construction in Airdrie has been very prominent in recent years with builders developing a number of [[brownfield]] sites following the closure of various factories such as Boots whom closed their factory in 2004. Nonetheless it does retain significant economic activity.
