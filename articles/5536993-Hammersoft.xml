'''Northwest Community College''' ('''NWCC''') is a [[Post-secondary education|post-secondary]] educational institution that serves the residents of northwest [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nwcc.bc.ca/About/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; NWCC was first established in [[Terrace, British Columbia|Terrace]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;planner&quot;&gt;http://www.educationplanner.ca/nwcc.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;.
