The '''humanitarian response by non-governmental organizations to the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]''' included many [[non-governmental organization]]s, such as international, religious and regionally based NGOs, that immediately pledged support in the aftermath of the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. Besides a large multi-contingency contribution by national governments, NGOs contributed a significant deal to both on-the-ground rescue efforts and external solicitation of aid for those rescue efforts.

==International==

* [[Oxfam International]] - International relief and development agency Oxfam International swung into action to raise emergency funds to assist relief and rehabilitation efforts on the ground. Oxfam is committed to assisting in the rebuilding efforts in Haiti, and the agency will be on the ground for the long haul. This along with the immediate response of providing clean water, shelter, and sanitation means that the level of need continues to be great.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.oxfam.org/en/emergencies/haiti-earthquake |title=Major earthquake in Haiti|accessdate=2010-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Food For The Poor]] - Food For The Poor has been able to provide relief to Haiti through the acquisition and delivery of more than 7,100 tons of food, medical supplies, pharmaceuticals, building materials and other goods. The 359 containers have provided lifesaving goods to those suffering from the effects of the earthquake. The people of Haiti have been provided with more than 20 million meals from the rice, beans, canned goods and water shipped into Haiti.

* [[World Vision International]] - World Vision had relief items stored in Haiti in preparation for hurricane season and began distributing those immediately, but the medical supplies, blankets, tents and other supplies from the [[PÃ©tionville]] office quickly ran low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wvi.org/wvi/wviweb.nsf/updates/F2D16C2A8138D7F9882576AC00211028?opendocument |title=Haiti: World Vision facing obstacles, 'running marathon' to provide relief}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first flight with 18 metric tonnes of World Vision relief supplies left the organization's Denver, Colorado, USA warehouse on 14 Jan, and arrived in Port-au-Prince the following night, providing emergency goods for more than 1,000 families, including tarps for temporary shelter; blankets, collapsible water containers, cooking sets and hygiene kits that contain a monthâs supply of soap, toilet paper, toothbrushes and more for a family of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wvi.org/wvi/wviweb.nsf/updates/271D5437B59D596D882576AD002D4009?opendocument |title=Haiti: Distributions continue, new aid arriving|accessdate=2010-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization's facility in Haiti was damaged, but none of the staff were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://edition.cnn.com/2010/WORLD/americas/01/12/haiti.earthquake/index.html |title=7.0 quake hits Haiti; 'Serious loss of life' expected | work=CNN | accessdate=2010-05-04 | date=2010-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the gravity of the situation World Vision subsequently coordinated additional relief flights from their warehouses in Dubai, Panama, Germany, Canada and Denver, carrying the following supplies: tarps, collapsible water containers, shovels, hygiene kits, kitchen sets, blankets, radio equipment, and mosquito nets. World Vision then signed an agreement with [[Air Serv International]] to provide one light aircraft to transport people and cargo (14,000&amp;nbsp;lbs capacity) between Santo Domingo and Port-au-Prince. The first flights began 19 Jan, making two rotations per day. According to relief staff, these flights will radically improve transports of staff and goods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.wvi.org/wvi/wviweb.nsf/updates/418DB0A42FFA0FDC882576B0006FF4DC?opendocument |title=Haiti: Additional details on World Vision's response}}&lt;/ref&gt;
