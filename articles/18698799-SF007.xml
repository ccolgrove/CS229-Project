The '''HTC Dream''' (also marketed as the '''T-Mobile G1''' in the US and parts of [[Europe]] and as the '''Era G1''' in [[Poland]]) is an [[Internet]]-enabled  [[smartphone]] with an operating system designed by [[Google]] and hardware designed by [[HTC Corporation|HTC]]. It was the first phone on the market to use the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] mobile device platform.&lt;ref name=HTC&gt;{{cite news|publisher=HTC|url=http://www.htc.com/www/press.aspx?id=66338&amp;lang=1033|accessdate=2009-05-19|title=T-Mobile Unveils the T-Mobile G1 â the First Phone Powered by Android}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT200808&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = Holson | first = Laura | coauthors = Helft, Miguel | title = Smartphone Is Expected via Google | publisher = New York Times | date = 2008-08-14 | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2008/08/15/technology/15google.html?_r=1&amp;ref=technology&amp;oref=slogin | accessdate = 2008-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release history==

The HTC Dream was released in the [[United States|U.S.]] on 22 October 2008; in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] on 30 October 2008;
&lt;ref name=&quot;UK release of T-Mobile G1&quot;&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.opt-development.co.uk/press-office/release.php?id=242 |title=T-Mobile G1 Hits the UK|publisher=[[T-Mobile]] UK |date=2008-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and became available in other European countries including Austria, Netherlands, and the Czech Republic in early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.talkandroid.com/tmobile-g1/ |title=Android G1 - T-Mobile Google Phone}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was released in Germany in February 2009 with a [[QWERTZ]]&lt;!--CORRECT spelling! - follow the link!--&gt; keyboard&lt;ref name=&quot;Germany release of T-Mobile G1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-mobile.de/g1/ | title=T-Mobile G1 - Das Internet-Handy|publisher=T Mobile Germany | accessdate = 2009-02-28}} {{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in France in March 2009 with an [[AZERTY]] keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phandroid.com/2009/03/04/orange-france-getting-htc-dream/ Orange France Getting HTC Dream! | Android Phone Fans&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 10 March 2009, it became available in Poland as '''Era G1''' under a local mobile brand affiliated with T-Mobile.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | language=Polish | url=http://www.era.pl/pl/indywidualni/telefony/erag1/oferta |title=Era G1 | accessdate = 2009-02-15 | publisher=[[Era GSM]] online offer}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2008}}, in the U.S., it was priced starting at $129.99 for new and existing T-Mobile customers if purchased with a two-year [[T-Mobile]] voice and data plan, and $399 without a contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Topolsky| first=Joshua| title= T-Mobile's CTO on G1 unlocking and tethering -- plus a few details you might have missed | url= http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/23/t-mobiles-cto-on-g1-unlocking-and-tethering-plus-a-few-detai/ | date= 2008-09-23| accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congruent with claims made by T-Mobile representatives, the handset does need the data plan to fully function as a smartphone, but can be used as a regular phone (with some smartphone capabilities available when connected to a WiFi network) without a data plan. The Dream comes in black, bronze (formerly called &quot;brown&quot;; except in the UK), or white.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.t-mobileg1.com/g1-learn-features-details.aspx|title=Feature details on the T-Mobile G1 with Google phone}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 April 2009, [[T-Mobile USA]] announced it had sold one million G1s since the device's launch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationweek.com/blog/main/archives/2009/04/tmobile_usa_and_1.html The Information Week: T-Mobile USA And HTC Have Sold 1 Million G1 Android Phones]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 February 2009, the phone was released through [[Optus]] in [[Australia]], as the HTC Dream.&lt;ref&gt;[http://personal.optus.com.au/web/ocaportal.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=Template_wRHS&amp;FP=/personal/mobile/mobilephones/htcdream&amp;site=personal Optus.com.au]&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 February 2009, [[Singapore]] became the first country in Asia to introduce the phone. It was sold by [[SingTel]] between [[Singapore dollar|$]]38 â $238 under various contracts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.singtel.com/news_centre/news_releases/2009_02_20.asp Singtel.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 2, 2009 it was released through [[Rogers Wireless]] in [[Canada]] as the HTC Dream. This variant, DREA210, supports the UMTS 850/1900 bands and [[HSDPA]] up to 7.2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s for use on Rogers' 3G network.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.htc.com/ca/product/rogersdream/specification.html HTC Dream (Rogers) Specification]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 27, 2010 the T-Mobile G1 was officially discontinued.

==Hardware==
* '''Display''': 3.2 in (8.1&amp;nbsp;cm) [[Thin Film Transistor|TFT]]-[[Liquid Crystal Display|LCD]] flat glass touch-sensitive [[HVGA]] screen with 480Ã320 pixel resolution and [[capacitive touchscreen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;engadget-review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/t-mobile-g1-review-part-2-software-and-wrap-up/|title=T-Mobile G1 review, part 2: software and wrap-up|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=[[Engadget]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the touchscreen hardware is capable of multitouch gestures, official releases of the Android OS (versions 1.0 to 1.6) have this functionality disabled for the phone at the kernel level. Users can patch the supplied version of Android, download a hacked version or update to Android 2.0 or later to make use of the multitouch screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;mobilecrunch-post&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobilecrunch.com/2008/11/17/g1-capable-of-multi-touch-input-looks-like-it/|title=G1 capable of multitouch input? Looks like it.|date=November 17, 2008|publisher=[[MobileCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''CPU''': The [[MSM7201A]] is an [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based, dual-core&lt;ref&gt;Note that the cores are not for SMP, only one of them is used to run applications&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central processing unit|CPU]]/[[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] from [[Qualcomm]] and contains many built-in features, including 3G and a GPU capable of up to 4 million triangles/sec. It has hardware acceleration for Java,&lt;ref name=&quot;Qualcomm&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qctconnect.com/products/msm_7201.html|title=MSM7201 Chipset Solution|accessdate=2008-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this does not accelerate execution of Android applications, as they are targeted to the [[Dalvik virtual machine|Dalvik VM]], not the [[Java vm|Java VM]].
* '''Keyboard''': The HTC Dream has a sliding full 5 row [[QWERTY]] keyboard. It also comes with a set of 6 navigation buttons:
** phone (green, white/black in Germany, UK &amp; France) â make outbound calls, receive incoming calls, or open the dialer.
** home (white/black) â displays home screen with shortcut icons for some applications and a drawer containing all applications on the phone.
** trackball â navigate among items on the screen or scroll in text fields. May also be pressed to select items.
** back (white/black) â return to the previous screen.
** phone (red, white/black in Germany, UK &amp; France) â end currently active call or put phone into sleep mode.
** menu (white/black) â display the contextual menu for the current screen. Also unlocks the phone in early versions of Android.
** a touchscreen keyboard is available as of Android 1.5. Note: this feature does not work on phones sold to be used on the Rogers Wireless network.&lt;ref name=&quot;smartphonenation&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://smartphonenation.com/2009/06/rogers-htc-dream-in-depth-review/|title=Rogers HTC Dream in Depth Review|date=2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Side controls''': A pair of volume buttons is located on the left side of the phone, and a camera button on the right side.
* '''Audio''': In place of a headphone jack, the Dream (like many HTC smartphones) has a mini-USB-compatible [[ExtUSB]] jack &lt;ref name=&quot;htc-specs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.htc.com/www/product/g1/specification.html|title=T-Mobile G1: Specification|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=HTC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;engadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/09/24/t-mobile-g1-impressions-what-we-love-what-we-dont/|title=T-Mobile G1 impressions: what we love, what we don't|date=2008-09-24|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=2008-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; that carries audio signals alongside the regular USB signals, and can be converted with a [[dongle]] (now shipped with the phone) to support any standard 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm headphone. The standard headset includes a clip-on microphone and call answer/hangup button. The Dream supports audio files in MP3, AAC, AAC+, WMA, MPEG4, WAV, MIDI, and Ogg formats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Android for Dummies&quot;/&gt;
* '''Camera''': The HTC Dream has a 3.2 megapixel camera with autofocus functionality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://t-mobileg1.com/g1-learn-features-details.aspx Feature details on the T-Mobile G1 with Google phone]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no light (&quot;[[Flash (photography)|flash]]&quot;) for the camera in low light conditions.
* '''Video''': The Dream can play H.264, streaming, 3GPP, MPEG4, and 3GP files.&lt;ref name=&quot;Android for Dummies&quot;/&gt; Video recording and uploading to YouTube is available as of Android 1.5. Recording resolution 352x288 H.263 3GP Mono sound @ 8&amp;nbsp;kHz.
* '''Storage''': The HTC Dream has a [[microSD]] card slot and comes with a 1&amp;nbsp;GB memory card (2&amp;nbsp;GB in the UK, Germany and Canada). It has been confirmed to work with capacities up to 16&amp;nbsp;GB, and may work with even larger cards.&lt;ref name=&quot;Engadget hardware review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/10/16/t-mobile-g1-review-part-1-hardware/|title=T-Mobile G1 review, part 1: hardware - Engadget|date=October 16, 2008|publisher=Engadget}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the USB cable is connected to a computer, this computer can access the card without removing it from the HTC Dream. The phone can access media files arranged in folders, but the folders have to be created from a third-party file management application or from a computer or a third-party file-manager program on the phone.
* '''Battery''': The HTC Dream has a user-replaceable, 3.7&amp;nbsp;V, 1150&amp;nbsp;mAh (4.25&amp;nbsp;Whr) rechargeable lithium ion battery, which is advertised to offer up to 130 hours of standby power.
* '''Orientation and location''': The HTC Dream provides an [[accelerometer#Electronic devices|accelerometer]] for detecting movement and determining which direction is 'Up'. It also has a digital [[compass]], giving it complete orientation data. The Dream includes a [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] receiver for fine-grained positioning, and can use cellular or Wi-Fi networks for coarse-grained positioning.
* '''Case''': Three different colors are available: black, bronze, white.
* '''Connectivity''': [[Wi-Fi]] ([[802.11b/g]]) using a [[Texas Instruments]] WL1251B chipset; [[Bluetooth#Bluetooth v2.0 + EDR|Bluetooth 2.0+EDR]] via Texas Instruments BRF6300; [[ExtUSB#Proprietary connectors and formats|ExtUSB]] with an [[SMSC]] USB3316 chipset; standalone [[GPS]] and [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]]; [[Quad band]] [[GSM frequency bands|GSM 850/900/1800/1900]] MHz and [[General Packet Radio Service|GPRS]]/[[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]], plus [[Dual band]] [[UMTS frequency bands|UMTS Bands I and IV]] (1700 &amp; 2100&amp;nbsp;MHz) and [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]]/[[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access|HSUPA]] (in US/Europe) at 7.2/2 Mbit/s using the [[Qualcomm]] RTR6285 chipset

==Software==
The HTC Dream runs the [[Android (operating system)|Android Operating System]]. Most of the code is [[open source]] with some exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trac.osuosl.org/trac/replicant/wiki/HTCDreamProprietaryDrivers List of proprietary components] Replicant Wiki&lt;/ref&gt;

Several applications that come installed with this device are:

* Full HTML web browser powered by the [[WebKit]] rendering engine; it allows a maximum of 8 windows (but not multiple windows in the same screen, except in reduced size for the purpose of selecting one)
* [[Gmail]]
* [[Google Calendar]]
* [[Google Maps]] (with [[Google Latitude|Latitude]])
* [[Google Talk]]
* [[YouTube]] video player&lt;ref name=&quot;Android for Dummies&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techpluto.com/what-is-android/|title=Android for Dummies|date=September 18, 2008|publisher=TechPluto}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the United States, the carrier-subsidized firmware for the G1 also comes with an application for accessing the [[Amazon MP3]] music store, which allows users to browse and legally purchase DRM-free songs; however, in developer firmwares this application is not included.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amazon-mp3-download&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://phx.corporate-ir.net/phoenix.zhtml?c=97664&amp;p=irol-newsArticle&amp;ID=1199842&amp;highlight=|title=Customers Get Quick and Easy Access to Over 6 Million DRM-Free Songs from Amazon MP3 On New T-Mobile G1 Powered by Android Software|date=September 23, 2008|publisher=Amazon.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; More applications can be obtained through the [[Android Market]] application or directly through developers. Documents in [[Google Docs]] can be viewed, but not edited. However, spreadsheets in Google Docs (including the texts in them) ''can'' be edited.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.google.com/support/mobile/bin/answer.py?hl=en&amp;answer=77428 Accessing Google Docs on your mobile phone]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.google.com/support/forum/p/Google+Mobile/thread?tid=1057ea1066963b9e&amp;hl=en Editing Google Docs on my G1 phone]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Updating===
The Dream [[firmware]] can be updated by [[Flash memory|flashing]] from an image stored on the [[microSD]] card as an update.zip or with a custom recovery as any name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://androidcommunity.com/forums/f28/learn-how-to-update-using-your-microsd-card-5784/|title=Learn how to update using your microSD card}}&lt;/ref&gt; These images are [[Public-key cryptography|cryptographically signed]] by either the phone manufacturer or network carrier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oblomovka.com/wp/2008/11/01/confirmed-by-android-team-g1-only-accepts-firmware-signed-by-manufacturer/#comments|title=confirmed by Android team: G1 only accepts firmware signed by manufacturer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with other features, support for third-party widgets was introduced through updates.&lt;ref name=&quot;robostripping&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080819-robotripping-hands-on-with-the-android-sdk-beta.html|title=Robotripping: hands on with the Android SDK beta|date=August 19, 2008|publisher=Ars Technica}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of Friday, December 18, 2009, [http://www.htc.com/ HTC] and [http://www.rogers.com/ Rogers Wireless] have both stated that they will not support Non-Google branded HTC Magic and HTC Dream phones past Android Version 1.5.  HTC changed the content of its website to reflect this ([http://www.htc.com/ca/support/magic-rogers/help/system-and-upgrade Magic]), ([http://www.htc.com/ca/support/dream-rogers/help/system-and-upgrade Dream]), and Rogers Wireless notified the Android community by a [http://androidforums.com/rogers/10647-rogers-dream-1-6-update-11.html#post197520 post] in AndroidForums.

==Developer edition==
On December 5, 2008, Google announced the [[Android Dev Phone#Android Dev Phone 1|Android Dev Phone 1]], a hardware unlocked version of the HTC Dream. With this version, the user is not only able to use any GSM/UMTS carrier, but also has complete [[superuser]] access to the device which is not found in the retail version. The advantages to this version is that it gives full access to the internal files of the phone, in particular changing and re-flashing the bootloader and operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;devphone1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/12/google-introduces-developer-g1-phones.ars|title=Google introduces developer G1 phones|date=December 7, 2008|publisher=arstechnica}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version also has pre-installed utilities to aid in the development of Android apps. This version is sold for US$399 and is only available to registered members of the Android community which is open to all developers for a US$25 fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;cravedevphone1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-10116531-1.html|title=Google unleashes unlocked G1 on developers|date=December 6, 2008|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the country, the additional shipping charges (which include tariff and tax) may amount to a substantial fraction of the base price; for example, shipping charges to United Kingdom are $128.25, to Germany are US$134.31 and to Poland is US$162.

==Rooting==
Upon the launch of the T-Mobile G1, one concern among developers was that the retail build of Android installed on it lacked certain features (such as the &quot;su&quot; command) that were available on the Developer Phone version that allowed you to obtain superuser access to the phone. This had a number of implications, the most important being that it prevented you from changing large parts of the firmware (since they were mounted read-only on boot, and only the superuser could remount them read-write). However, a severe vulnerability was soon discovered in early versions of the firmware â everything typed into the phone's keyboard was being interpreted as commands in a root shell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.zdnet.com/Burnette/?p=680 Zdnet.com]&lt;/ref&gt; By using [[telnet]]d to exploit this, users could flash a modified image with root access. This process, dubbed &quot;[[Rooting (Android OS)|rooting]]&quot; by the community,&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=442480 XDA-developers.com]&lt;/ref&gt; allows users to gain superuser access and perform actions previously impossible without root access, such as installing custom builds of Android, running Debian,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saurik.com/id/10 Saurik.com]&lt;/ref&gt; installing custom themes, and enabling ad-hoc Wi-Fi [[tethering]]. Although Google and T-Mobile were quick to patch this vulnerability with update RC30, a ROM from HTC was later leaked allowing users to downgrade to an older firmware with the bug.&lt;ref&gt;[http://andblogs.net/2009/01/rc30-downgrade-merry-christmas-everyone/ Andblogs.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The Android Dev Phone 1 comes with superuser access officially integrated into its firmware, allowing native code and custom kernels to be run without any special hacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://android.brightstarcorp.com/ Brightstarcorp.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although slightly more difficult, the Rogers Wireless version of the phone can also be rooted, even if fully updated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.cyanogenmod.com/wiki/Rogers_Dream:_Rooting_(Post-911_Patch)&lt;/ref&gt;.

Rooting also allows the use of modified images to run on the G1 through the original vulnerability. For example, a leaked [[HTC Magic]] (Android 1.5) OS was modified to run on the device before the official Android 1.5 build for the HTC Dream was released. This enabled functionality such as video recording, stereo [[Bluetooth]] and an on-screen keyboard.

One popular unofficial firmware release for the Dream/G1 is [[CyanogenMod]], the latest official version of which is at version 6.1.0.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyanogenmod.com/home/cyanogenmod-6-1-stable-has-landed CyanogenMod-6.1 Stable Has Landed! | CyanogenMod&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; (CyanogenMod is at version 7 as of 9-24-2011, but is only available via an unofficial port.) It is almost a full port of Android 2.2.1 to the Dream/G1.

Following the disclosure of a root exploit, Jay Freeman released details of how to run Android and [[ARM architecture|ARM]] [[Debian Linux]] together on the Dream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saurik.com/id/10|title=Debian &amp; Android Together on G1|author=Jay Freeman}}&lt;/ref&gt;
