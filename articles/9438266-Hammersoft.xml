{{original research|date=January 2011}}
The following is a complete '''list of creatures''' from the universe of [[ITV]] [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series  '''''[[Primeval]]''''' and also any spin-off merchandise. The series includes various imaginary species which are not native to the series setting, with some being prehistoric and others being futuristic. Various creatures were designed with some [[artistic license]], for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Framestore&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Milne|first=Mike|url=http://www.framestore-cfc.com/television/primeval/index.html|title=Primeval sees Framestore CFC's Creatures Leap into the 21st Century}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of creatures from the ''[[Walking with...]]'' series were also reimagined for dramatic effect.

In 2007 [[Character_Options#Primeval|Character Options]] announced they would create ''Primeval'' action figures, including both a flying [[#Coelurosauravus|Rex]] and a large plush toy Rex, [[#Future Predator|Future Predators]], [[#Hesperornis|''Hesperornis'']] and [[#Dodo|Dodos]]).

[[Ammonite]]s are a group of marine animals of the subclass [[Ammonoidea]] in the class [[Cephalopoda]], phylum Mollusca. Ammonites' closest living relative is probably not the modern [[Nautilus]] (which they outwardly resemble), but rather the subclass Coleoidea ([[octopus]], [[squid]], and [[cuttlefish]]). Their fossil shells usually take the form of planispirals, although there were some helically spiralled and non-spiralled forms (known as &quot;heteromorphs&quot;). Many Ammonites lived in the open water of ancient seas, rather than at the sea bottom. Many of them are thought to have been good swimmers with flattened, discus-shaped, streamlined shells. Ammonites preyed on fish, crustaceans and other small creatures; while they themselves were preyed upon by marine reptiles.

[[Helen Cutter]] leaves Ammonites as [[Visiting card|calling card]]s on [[Nick Cutter|Nick's]] desk, and on [[Stephen Hart (Primeval)|Stephen's]] [[grave (burial)|grave]] in episode 2.7.

In ''Extinction Event'', the first large dinosaurs the kidnapped team spot are ''[[Anatotitan]]'', which are described as large [[hadrosaur]]s that move in large herds, stampeding whenever they are threatened by a predator such as the ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''. They were said to be a yellow-brown color with dark brown camouflage stripes down their back, similar to the Iguanodon in ''The Lost Island''.

In ''Extinction Event'', [[Ankylosaur]]s are seen a couple of times, at first one plods harmlessly through the team's campsite, and prove to be resistant to gunfire, and later Jenny and the soldiers accomponying her are almost killed after an angered ''Ankylosaurus'' hits the car they are in with its tail club. A mother and baby are also seen in the Cretaceous.

''[[Anurognathus]]'' was a tiny [[pterosaur]] that had a short head with pin-like teeth for catching insects, and although it traditionally is ascribed to the long tailed pterosaur group, its tail was comparatively short, allowing it more maneuverability for hunting in woodland.
&lt;ref name=&quot;Unwin2005&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pterosuars|last=Unwin|first=David|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anurognathus'' lived in the Late Jurassic period, 130 million years ago and had a wingspan of {{Convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} and a {{Convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on|adj=on}} long body (skull included), it could not have weighed more than a few grams. Despite this they prove to be creatures of devastating violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;epFive&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 1.5|series=Primeval|serieslink=Primeval|network=[[ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=2007-03-17|season=1|number=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Anurognathus'' live like a flying piranha fish, with an amazingly keen sense of smell able to detect blood from hundreds of feet away. A [[swarm]] can strip flesh from bones in minutes. They also swarm in huge flocks and overcome prey through weight in numbers.&lt;ref name=&quot;epFive&quot; /&gt;

This fictional species of ''Anurognathus'' evolved from the Jurassic species ''Anurognathus ammoni'' which lived about 150 million years ago and had small needle like teeth for hunting insects. This evolved form has slicing teeth for taking lumps of flesh off large dinosaurs. This behavior may be slightly based on the theory that a similar anurognathid pterosaur, ''[[Jeholopterus]]'', was a hematophagous creature, like the modern vampire bat.&lt;ref name=&quot;herebemonsters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Henshall|first=Douglas|url=http://www.douglashenshall.com/Primevalpressherebethemonsters.html|title=Here be Monsters}}&lt;/ref&gt; The creatures seen here were re-imagined from the ones in ''[[Walking with Dinosaurs]]'' by the producers for dramatic effect.&lt;ref name=&quot;Framestore&quot; /&gt;

In episode 5.5 a flock appears at the New Dawn power station. They attack Matt and Emily and later kill two Prospero guards. They later attack and kill April. What happened to them is unknown.

===''Arthropleura''===

''[[Arthropleura]]'' was a {{Convert|2|â|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on|adj=on}} long (about {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long in the series) relative of [[centipede]]s and [[millipede]]s, native to the Upper [[Carboniferous]] of [[Great Britain|Britain]] and the [[United States]]. It was the largest known land [[invertebrate]] of all time and grew so large because of the high percentage of [[oxygen]] in the [[Earth]]'s [[atmosphere]] at that time. A burrower, they have poor eyesight but have excellent sense of smell and touch. One appears in the second episode. Although not a carnivore, they have powerful pincers and venomous bite and can easily be provoked into attacking.&lt;ref name=&quot;epTwo&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 1.2|series=Primeval|serieslink=Primeval|network=[[ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=2007-03-17|season=1|number=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; For dramatic effect, the ''Arthropleura'' in episode 1.2 was heavily re-imagined as it was venomous, larger than the real animal and highly aggressive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Framestore&quot; /&gt;

Symptoms of the ''Arthropleura'' poisoning include uncontrolled shaking, [[anaphylaxis]] and short term memory loss in recovered patients.

Once bitten the venom then begins to slowly attack the [[central nervous system]], not so far removed from modern [[biochemistry]] as to be totally ineffective, and any enzyme inhibitor would be detrimental to an extent. However, as the ''Arthropleura'' are [[detritus]] eaters they make no attempt to eat their victims. Fortunately the hospital staff discovered that the venom has a modern day equivalent, thus producing an [[anti-venom]].&lt;ref name=&quot;epTwo&quot; /&gt;

An ''Arthropleura'' also reappeared in the series finale of Series 2 as one of the many creatures captured by Leek. When the security system holding it failed, it ran amok, although how it had survived thus far without the carboniferous atmosphere that it needed to live, remains a mystery.

''Arthropleura'' also featured in the advertising campaign for the show, appearing in The London Paper on the 16 February 2007. The ''Arthropleura'' portrayed here is different from the creatures seen in the fossil record, in addition to the ''Arthropleura'' in ''[[Walking with Monsters]]'' as well as in ''[[Prehistoric Park]]'', re-imagined by the producers to make it scarier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Framestore&quot; /&gt;

''[[Australopithecus]]'' are believed to be the ancestors of modern-day ''[[Homo sapiens|humans]]''. 

[[Helen Cutter]] believed the only way to stop the destruction of life on earth was to stop humans from evolving, so she attempted to wipe out our ancestors. She began by poisoning the members of the &quot;[[AL 333|First Family]]&quot; in episode 3.10, but is killed herself before she can complete her plan. Danny Quinn later found several more living in the Rift Valley as he attempted to find his way back to the anomaly.

In ''The Lost Island'', the team are marooned in the [[Cretaceous]], when they run into a mammal described as being similar to a badger. It briefly snarls at the team, and then runs off. It turns out to have been later feasting on a dead ''[[Iguanodon]]'' calf.

This creature is from the future, and has been encountered by Matt Anderson before, allowing him knowledge of their behaviour. Adults are {{Convert|2|-|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length. They have armoured shells, however their underbelly is softer. Their anomaly must have opened some years before and they had dug tunnels stretching all across London. 

In episode 5.1, one attacked a roadworker who fell into one of its tunnels, and returned when Matt, Becker and Abby arrived, attempting to attack them as they fired their EMDs, which did not affect it. It then attacked a man at a barbecue, which alerted the team who tried to use lethal weapons to bring it down, only for the creature to drag Connor into its tunnel. As the team located its nest, it succumbed to the damage done to it and died, leaving Connor to find dozens more inside the building. Connor filled the building with gas and escaped with Matt as the building was blown up in order to exterminate them.

===Camouflage Beast (Gremlin)===
{{Infobox Primeval creature

| period        = Future
| appeared      = Episode 3.2
| humans_killed = 2
| returned      = Fell back through the anomaly after being shot by Danny Quinn
}}
In episode 3.2, the Camouflage Beast (it is never given a name on screen) is the major, and only, creature. It has been shown on the ITV website that this creature is based heavily on the Madagascan [[Aye-aye|Aye-Aye]] which is seen as a symbol of death in its homeland. The creature may speak some kind of language, as it makes a kind of hissing, whispering noise when it is alone. 

It was responsible for the disappearance of two boys 14 years before the present, including Patrick Quinn, and leaving Ryan Mason the only survivor. In the present day it was being fed raw meat by a girl in order to keep it from eating neighbouring pets. When the team arrived at the now abandoned house they could not find the creature due to its camouflage ability, and later it attacked Abby when she was alone. Abby later followed it and discovered the girl feeding it. She and Ryan were in the house when it attacked again, however when the others arrived it killed a real estate agent. It attacked Danny Quinn, and it went through its anomaly when it reopened, however it came back, only to be shot several times by Danny as it fell back through, possibly dead.

In episode 4.7 Patrick Quinn, who in fact survived and went through the anomaly, stated that the Camouflage beasts kept coming for him and was forced to kill them to survive. The trauma caused him to also see humans as animals, and became convinced that killing humans is not any different from killing animals.

=== ''Coelurosauravus'' ===
{{Infobox Primeval creature

| image          = Coelurosauravus BW.jpg
| caption        = Rex
| first_appeared = Episode 1.1
| period         = [[Permian]]
| returned       = No, kept as a pet
| number         = 1
}}
A male ''[[Coelurosauravus]]'', later named &quot;Rex&quot;, entered the present in the series' premiere, and despite attempts to send it back to the [[Permian]], was adopted by Abby and quickly became a mascot for the team. ''Coelurosauravus'' is incorrectly shown to be capable of powered flight rather than simple gliding, and shown to be far larger than its real size of {{Convert|30|cm|in|abbr=on}}. Its head crest is also entirely speculative.

In episode 1.1, Rex was kept by Ben Trent after he came through the Permian anomaly, and was assumed to be the flying lizard [[Draco volans]] until Abby Maitland arrived and said he wasn't. After encountering a ''[[Scutosaurus]]'' and a group of others, Rex was taken to the Home Office to be examined. He escaped the lab and flew around the building, and Abby kept him from leaving. He was returned through the Permian anomaly by Nick Cutter, but came back to the present and was taken back to Abby's flat in secret. Abby had to adjust the temperature of her flat so that it was similar to his own environment, and Connor Temple discovered him, but agreed to not reveal Rex's pressence. Rex escaped from the flat in episode 1.5, and was accidentally transported to a golf course where Connor tried to catch him. Rex ran off as they were attacked by a ''Pteranodon'', and Abby pleaded to Cutter to let her keep him. Rex was later found and returned to the flat.

In episode 2.2, Rex took an instant dislike to Connor's new girlfriend Caroline Steel, attempting to bite her. In episode 2.4 he was left in the freezer by Caroline, and was found by Abby before he completely froze. By the next day he had recovered. In episode 2.5 Caroline attempted to capture Rex by leaving food out for him, and he flew around the flat trying to avoid her but was knocked down by a tennis racket. Caroline took Rex to Oliver Leek, who kept him in his creature prison. In episode 2.7 he was released along with the other creatures, and found a shaft to the surface which was used by the team to escape. Rex was shot by a guard, and Caroline asked to redeem herself by getting Rex out.

Rex was shown to still be living with Abby and Connor in episode 3.1, and in episode 3.6 Abby's brother Jack bet Rex during a game of poker with a friend and lost. He was put on E-Bay for sale which allowed Connor to notice what Jack had done. They attempted to get Rex back, and finally did so when Connor had Captain Becker threaten the seller. Abby brought Rex over to James Lester's flat where Connor was staying in episode 3.9, and Rex played with Connor's two ''[[Diictodon]]'', Sid and Nancy.

During Abby and Connor's disappearance, Rex was relocated to the new ARC inside the menagerie, living alongside other creatures that hadn't been returned to their own eras. Abby reunited with Rex in episode 4.2 after she had returned and been placed in charge of the creatures. In episode 4.3 Rex escaped the menagerie and caused the ARC to go into lockdown when he was scanned by Phillip Burton's bio-scanner. The room was drained of oxygen, and Connor managed to cancel the lockdown in time to be able to resuscitate Rex. In episode 5.4 he was in Abby's lab when the ARC was invaded by Future Beetles and flew around the ARC. Abby searched for him to rescue him before a gamma ray was released, and later returned to the menagerie.

===Columbian Mammoth===

}}
The Columbian Mammoth was one of the largest of the [[Mammoth]] species and also one of the largest [[elephant]]s to have ever lived, measuring {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}}, at the shoulder and weighing {{Convert|10|t|LT|abbr=on}} with tusks {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long. It was a [[herbivore]], with a diet consisting of varied plant life ranging from grasses to [[conifer]]s. It has been estimated that a large male would have eaten approximately {{Convert|300|kg|lb|abbr=on}}, of plant material daily.

The remains of Columbian Mammoths were discovered in the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in [[California]] and this mammoth also lived in [[Mexico]], where its remains are very common. It was one of the last members of the Megafauna to become extinct, with several specimens dating only about 7,800 years ago.

The Mammoth appears in series two holding up traffic on the [[M25 motorway]]. As it desperately tries to make its way to the nearby trees, it completely destroys all the nearby cars. Using female elephant urine, the team manage to lead it into a lorry trailer and trap it, taking it back to the ARC where it was kept in a large garage.

After being chased through the ARC by a [[Future Predator]], [[James Peregrine Lester|Lester]] releases the Mammoth which impales the predator on its tusks. Lester then jokes that his children have been wanting him to get a pet. The Mammoth was seen in the new ARC's menagerie in episode 4.2 and episode 4.4.

In episode 5.5, the anomaly on the M25 reopened and another Mammoth (possibly more) entered it.

In ''Extinction Event'', in an area where live specimens of Cretaceous life forms have been collected, Cutter stops to look at a tiny crested bird in a wire cage that was captured by the Russian team.

In ''Fire and Water'', ''[[Deinosuchus]]'' are described as &quot;Giant Crocodiles&quot; and that females were more dominant than males. Connor and Abby lure the ''Deinosuchus'' using Aerosols while Captain Becker and his men dart it with tranquillisers. They never do get them back to the past and remain in Leek's old bunker where he kept all his army of creatures.

[[Diictodon]] are small burrowing mammal-like reptiles. 

A group of over fifteen individuals appear to be traversing air vents in a hospital, chewing through the electricity that the team will need to remove them. Abby catches one which sends of a distress signal calling them all back through the anomaly but one drops from the roof (Sid) and lands inside a trolley Connor is pushing. A single ''[[Diictodon]]'' tried to escape through an anomaly, which disappears. It later becomes apparent that Abby and Conner adopt two to keep Rex company. In episode 3.5 they are called Sid and Nancy and are living with Connor while Abby's brother is staying.&lt;ref name=&quot;showreel&quot;&gt;[http://www.newseasonnewhorizons.com/ ITV Winter Spring Showreel]&lt;/ref&gt; When Connor was staying with Lester, the two caused him much grief.

In ''Extinction Event'', ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' are encountered by Helen, Jenny and the group of men assigned to help them. They are described as being as big as alligators, basking in groups like iguanas or sea lions and also have a crippling amount of bacteria in their mouth, similar to a [[Komodo dragon]]. The group of ''Dimetrodon'' are disturbed by the team and one man is badly bitten. He never recovers from the ensuing infection, but is later killed in the Cretaceous by a pack of ''Troodon''.

''[[Dodo]]s'' are flightless birds from the late [[Holocene]]. The ''Dodo'' was found only on the islands of Mauritius.

The sternum is insufficient to support flight; these ground-bound birds evolved to take advantage of an island ecosystem with no predators. They live on fallen fruit and in the Primeval Universe they exist in a symbiotic relationship with the Ambalacoque tree.

The name came from the Portuguese word ''doudo'' or ''doido'', itself a loanword from [[Old English]] (cf. English &quot;dolt&quot;).&lt;ref name=Staub1996&gt;'''Staub''', France (1996): Dodo and solitaires, myths and reality. ''Proceedings of the Royal Society of Arts &amp; Sciences of Mauritius'' '''6''': 89-122 [http://www.potomitan.info/dodo/c32.php HTML fulltext]&lt;/ref&gt;  The name was given because the ''Dodo'' apparently never tried to run or escape when hunted - hence, they were traditionally regarded as stupid. The species was hunted to extinction by the late 17th century, shortly after the first arrival of people on the Dodo's native [[Mauritius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tim Cocks|title=Natural disaster may have killed dodos|publisher=Reuters|date=4 June 2006|url=http://www.abc.net.au/science/news/ancient/AncientRepublish_1678225.htm|accessdate=30 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dracorex]]'' is a [[Cretaceous]] dinosaur. A promotional picture for that episode shows that it has sharp teeth, which is unlikely for a probably herbivorous creature, and two, small, wing-like sails on its back in the manner of ''[[Amargasaurus]]''. The picture shows a very long but not forked tongue. The dinosaur also has grasping talons on its hind legs, shown in the image lashing out at the knight.

A female appears in episode 3.7, having lived in Medieval times before being chased through an anomaly to the present by a knight who assumed it to be a dragon. The Dracorex had been injured after having a wooden stake driven into its side, and Abby and Becker cornered it in a strawberry patch where it collapsed of its own accord. Abby removed the stake with Becker and cared for it with Connor as she helped to patch it up. It was later moved to the ARC. It escaped from the new ARC's menagerie in episode 4.1 due to an error caused by Jess. It knocked Matt down in a corridor before it arrived in the hub where Jess was. Becker and soldiers arrived to contain it, but it was lead into Lester's office by Matt, who left it some water. Some time later Becker tranquilised it and it was moved back to the menagerie,

The ''[[Embolotherium]]'' are prehistoric rhinoceros, but larger and have more brittle horns which are used for display during mating seasons. These beasts able to scare off big predators like ''[[Andrewsarchus]]''. The males have a heart shaped horn on top of their noses which is about {{Convert|70|cm|in|abbr=on}} and the females have a some sort of stump. 

A herd of ''Embolotherium'' appeared from an anomaly and caused damage in a campsite. There is one male and several females, accompanied by a baby. The male killed a quad-bike rider after he disturbed the infant. The females were gathered around a tent, trapping another man, and Connor distracted the male by having it chase him in a go-cart. The baby was also trapped inside the tent, so Abby and Sarah saved it after making their way through the herd. Later the team attempted to force them through the anomaly, only for it to close as Connor lead the bull to the females and caused them all to stampede. They charged towards the campsite, however Eve managed to open an anomaly to send them all back through.

In ''[[List of Primeval books and novelisations|Shadow of the Jaguar]]'', a creature from the future, theorised to be a future evolution of predatory birds by Cutter, is found controlling a pack of [[#Thylacosmilus|''Thylacosmilus'']] with pheromones. It has a certain resemblance to the [[Incan]] god, [[Pacha Kamaq]]. The team track it down to its lair in the ruins of an Incan temple in the Peruvian jungle. After they disrupt its control over the ''Thylacosmilus'', the creature retreats through the anomaly with them seconds before it closes. Cutter later theorises to Lester the creature may have been seen later in history by the Incas and incorporated into their mythology. The creature had several unusual abilities, such as the ability to control other creatures through the use of pheromones (like a queen bee controls a beehive), and a tongue with a tip covered in many tiny teeth that can burrow into flesh.

}}
The fungus is parasitic, extremely aggressive and eats through the flesh of anything that touches it. As soon as someone touches it, it instantly begins converting them into a shell that is loosely human shaped, but has lost all human features and intelligence, relying on instinct. In other words, the fungus effectively kills the host once it has transformed. The ARC team thought that heating the creatures would kill them, but it only advanced their reproduction. In the end, freezing them was the solution. The fungus creature's life cycle is as follows:
*Spores are inhaled into the host's lungs.
*The spores become moist and convert into fungus
*Once consumed the fungus shell turns into a fungus creature which spread the fungus by touch.
*The fungus creature finally roots itself into the ground and waits to spread spores to new hosts.

The fungus is probably the evolved form of the contemporary ''[[Cordyceps]]'' fungus of south-east Asia for its lifecycle bears a strong resemblance to the fungus.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}} ''Cordyceps'' grows inside a host (usually an ant), replacing the surrounding tissue with its own, avoiding the vital organs. It then alters the host's behaviour to make it go to an area of suitable conditions. ''Cordyceps'' then grows throughout the host's body, killing it, before becoming completely rooted in the ground or stem the host found itself on. ''Cordyceps'' then sporulates, infecting more hosts, by either inhaling the spores through the windpipe or spores falling through pores in the exoskleteton or skin.  The Cordyceps fungus probably evolved into the future fungus to attack bigger prey, such as the Megopteran.

The fungus was found by Sir Richard Bentley's assistant after he went through an anomaly in a flat, and accidentally transferred it to the present where Bentley was infected by it. As he slowly took over him, a sample of Connor's at the ARC affected another man, and more quickly turned him into a Fungus Creature. Connor and Sarah's belief that overheating it would kill it was thought to have worked only to learn it actually spread the spores even more, leading the flamethrower-wielding team to capture it instead. After freezing the fungus instead, they found it worked and prepared the ARC to freeze their captured creature, only for it to escape and attack Jenny before it succumbed to the cold.

Vicious creatures referred to as &quot;Future Predators&quot; are ''Primeval'''s most recurring creatures, besides Rex. They are descendants of [[bat]]s, and like bats use echolocation to hunt and locate prey, with the ears having moved to the front of the face. They are extremely agile, however it comes at a cost as they are easily stunned by powerful blows. The Future Predators are known to have caused the most deaths out of any creature in the series, both on-screen deaths, and total (if what [[List of Primeval characters#Helen Cutter|Helen Cutter]] said about them wiping out humanity in the future was true). TV critic Walt Belcher of the Tampa Tribune described the Future Predator as &quot;an apelike and skull-headed thing that sort of represents the ultimate dumbing down of the human race&quot;&lt;ref&gt;WALT BELCHER. (2008, August 7). [http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/tampatribune/access/1529629631.html?dids=1529629631:1529629631&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Aug+07%2C+2008&amp;author=WALT+BELCHER&amp;pub=Tampa+Tribune&amp;desc=Time+Portal+Drama+In+London+Rips+Open+A+Whole+Batch+Of+Zoological+Adventures&amp;pqatl=google Time Portal Drama In London Rips Open A Whole Batch Of Zoological Adventures].

Their first appearance is in episode 1.6. A mating pair lived in the Permian era after going through an anomaly, and Helen realised they were from the future. When an anomaly lead to the present they went through, and proceeded to kill a lion and four innocent people, including Abby Maitland's boss. Helen, believing there was only one, warned the team about it, and they failed in their attempt to kill it initially. Connor Temple came up with an idea to track its echolocation, but was attacked in a car before he was saved by Abby and Stephen Hart. Nick Cutter lead the team to its lair, where they discovered it had given birth to five infants before they were attacked by the male. Nick managed to kill it, and he and Helen planned to use the infants to locate the future anomaly in the Permian to try prevent more from going though into that era. However the female Predator followed and attacked them, killing Tom Ryan and his men before a Gorgonopsid arrived and knocked it down. Three of the infants were killed before the mother fought back, and though it managed to inflict heavy wounds on the Gorgonopsid it was crushed and killed. Nick and Helen unknowingly left the remaining two infants in the Permian.

In episode 2.6, Oliver Leek had control of a Predator using a &quot;neural clamp&quot;, which he had taken to the ARC and kill some of the staff discreetly before going after James Lester. Lester made several attempts to fight back, turning on Connor's I-Pod speakers on loud and using a machinegun from the armoury before being cornered in the main room. Leek had the Predator leap to deliver the final blow, only for it to become impaled on the tusk of a Columbian Mammoth that Lester had just let loose. In episode 2.7 it is revealed Leek has successfully captured a pack of Predators, and using neural clamps to maintain control over them, referring to them as his &quot;Praetorian Guard&quot;. Nick was pursued by one through the facility until he managed to draw it in close with his blood before ripping the neural clamp from its head, killing it. Leek threatened to use the rest of his controlled Predators to tear Nick apart, however Nick freed them of their mind control devices by forcing the one he had into a fuse box, disabling the rest. They then turned on Leek and killed him before they were locked in a feeding chamber along with all of the other creatures that Leek, Helen and their soldiers had locked kept. They were among the creatures that killed Stephen as he sacrificed himself to keep the creatures locked up to have them kill one another. 

In episode 3.1 Future Predators appear in their own environment in an old city. They were the inadvertent guards for a mysterious artefact. Soldiers sent by Christine Johnson to recover the artefact killed a young Predator before an adult kills all but one of the soldiers. In episode 3.4, Christine was shown to have been operating on one in an attempt to learn how to recreate its echolocation. It woke up, and Christine had it killed. In episode 3.8, a pack of Future Predators stalked the team when they arrived in the future. Captain Becker killed one while accidentally alerting several others to their pressence due to the noise from his gun. An infant leaped out of a car to attack Danny Quinn, scarring his neck before he stomped on it. More approached as the team were rescuing Jack Maitland, and Becker lead them away. The team were trapped in an abandoned bus by the Predators before several Megopterans arrived and the two species fought amongst themselves, and the still alive Becker killed another as it came towards the team. In episode 3.9, a Predator kills Christine after she was pushed through an anomaly leading to the future by Helen. In episode 3.10 one stalked Danny, Connor and Abby as they searched for Helen, but was locked away from them. It soon broke into the room along with several others, narrowly missing their quarry as they escaped into the Cretaceous through an anomaly which was closed to prevent them following.

In episode 5.6, the Future Predators are shown differently, having evolved to survive in the harsh landscape caused by Philip Burton. They are much quicker then before, have more sun-damaged skin, and with food so scarce they attack each other to claim prey for themselves. One prepared to attack Connor before a storm came up, and it fought with another before the victor was brought down by Abby. A group attacked as Connor, Abby and Matt Anderson made their way back to the anomaly, though they fought amongst themselves. A pair went through an anomaly created by Connor into the ARC, and attacked Lester and Jess Parker. They severely injured Lester, and when the team arrived Abby came up with a plan to paralyse them by using ultra-sonic noise. The first had Abby pinned before Becker killed it with his EMD, and the other froze as Abby initiated her plan, and Becker was able to use his EMD to kill it with only a few close range blows.

The &quot;Future Predators&quot; also appear on the Watch YouTube Game. They attack your computer screen and it takes five hits to kill them.

The ''Future Shark'' is the future evolution of a modern-day shark. It looks similar to some deep-sea sharks, but has a special adaptation: a very long tongue armed with spikes that can be fired from the jaw like a harpoon. Modern day sharks such as the [[tiger shark]] have been found with litter in their stomachs, including plastic bags, tins and car registration plates: the basketball and the shoe found in the Future Shark's stomach could be a reference to this.

In episode 2.4 this creature prepared to attack Jenny Lewis in the water before it was shot by Stephen Hart and then captured by the team who suspected it of killing a boy. After examining the creature in their ARC, Nick Cutter concluded it was probably the descendant of the shark. Since no remains of the boy were found in the creature's stomach, and sharks typically take days to digest their prey, it did not kill the missing boy.

A ''future worm'' attacks Jack Maitland in the underground in the future. They are similar to the worms from episode 2.2 in that they shoot a foul liquid at their prey, but they more resemble maggots in appearance. It is not clear if the worms are larvae of the Mega-Optera or if they are a completely different species. They probably are not the larvae of the Mega-Optera as its young were seen in the present not long after they came out of a dead human body and are miniature versions of the adult animal.

The Giant Spiders are, despite appearances, not true spiders (order [[Araneae]]), but a species of [[Solifugae]], a distinct [[arachnid]] order. The name derives from Latin, and means ''those that flee from the sun''. The adults are up to {{Convert|1|m|in|abbr=on}} wide, by 1 m long, because the lush [[rainforest]] of the Carboniferous saturates the atmosphere with oxygen, allowing them to grow larger than modern [[arthropod]]s. They have pincers instead of fangs - like the modern day [[Solifugae|camel spider]], only much bigger. They also  have long [[pedipalps]], which function as sense organs similar to insects' antennae and give the appearance of the two extra legs. Pedipalps terminate in reversible adhesive organs. They do not appear to make webs or produce venom but they nest in large groups and are very defensive of their offspring.&lt;ref name=&quot;epTwo&quot; /&gt;

A nest of them appears in the second episode. Ryan and the other special forces enter the tunnel, and they are attacked by a whole group of them, killing one of the soldiers. They find out that the spiders did not kill the pest controller, because the bite looked different. Eventually it is discovered that they avoid light, and by using torches, all the Giant Spiders were driven back through the anomaly by the end of episode 1.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;epTwo&quot; /&gt;

These creatures are based on fragmentary fossils which scientists thought was a 1&amp;nbsp;m wide spider but this has just recently been reclassified as a type of scorpion.&lt;ref name=&quot;herebemonsters&quot; /&gt; The Giant Spiders also featured in the advertising campaign for the show.

''[[Giganotosaurus]]'' is one of the largest species of carnivorous dinosaurs. It is shown to be able to run at high speed for a surprisingly long distance, considering its huge size and weight. It is dubbed a &quot;G-Rex&quot; by the characters throughout the episode because it is pictured just like a T-Rex just slightly bigger.

In episode 3.4, one appears at an airport and starts attacking a news crew investigating the anomaly. It ate [[Nigel Marven]], then went back through before it returned and ran out onto the runway, attacking an aeroplane. Connor Temple lured it away with a luggage carrier before it tripped over the small vehicle and pinned Connor down on the runway. Then a helicopter piloted by Danny Quinn lured it back through the anomaly. Danny came back in time to reveal that there was a large pack on the other side of the anomaly, and Connor only just manages to lock the anomaly in time.

[[Gorgonops]]ia are a group of creatures that were at one time called  &quot;[[mammal-like reptiles]]&quot;, though in most current classification systems, they are not classed as  [[reptiles]] as they are more closely related to [[mammals]]. Their mammalian specializations include differentiated tooth shape, the fully developed temporal fenestra, pillar-like rear legs and even ear bones, as well as other traits associated with its [[mammal]]ian descendants. Arguments have even been made for synapsids of its time being [[endothermy|endothermic]].

Whatâs really special about Gorgonopsids is their patience and implacability. Once they have smelt blood they have a tendency to pursue their prey at all costs. In fact it was this keen sense of smell that originally tempted it into the cold present, lured by the smell of humans and waste from a supermarket.&lt;ref name=&quot;herebemonsters&quot; /&gt; They then store their kills in trees like [[leopard]]s.

They also appear to be resilient and long lived as one male Gorgonopsid was still defending the territory around the anomaly for at least eight years, even after suffering horrible injuries after a fight with a Future Predator which it killed by rearing up on its hind legs and crushing it under its weight.&lt;ref name=&quot;epSix&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 1.6|series=Primeval|serieslink=Primeval|network=[[ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=2007-03-17|season=1|number=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to the thick armour on their back, the only way to combat them with regular fire arms is to aim for their underside.&lt;ref name=&quot;epOne&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Episode 1 (Primeval)|Episode 1.1]]|series=Primeval|serieslink=Primeval|network=[[ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=2007-03-17|season=1|number=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hesperornis]]'' is an extinct genus of flightless aquatic birds that lived during the Late [[Cretaceous]]. ''Hesperornis'' were fairly large birds, reaching up to {{Convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} in length. They had virtually no wings, swimming with powerful hind legs. Their toes were probably lobed rather than being webbed, as in today's [[grebe]]s; like in these, the toes could rotate well, which is necessary to decrease drag in lobed feet but not in webbed ones such as in [[loon]]s, where the toes are simply folded together. Like many other [[Mesozoic]] birds such as ''[[Ichthyornis]]'', ''Hesperornis'' had [[teeth]] in its [[beak]] which were used to hold prey (most likely [[fish]]). In the hesperornithiform lineage they were of a different arrangement than in any other known bird (or in non-avian [[theropod]] dinosaurs), with the teeth sitting in a longitudinal groove rather than in individual sockets.&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in detail by Marsh (1880) and Gregory (1952)&lt;/ref&gt;

They hunted in the waters of the North American Inland Sea which then were [[tropical]] waters, much warmer than today. They probably fed mainly on fish, their teeth were helpful in dealing with slippery or hard-shelled prey. Later as Nick Cutter swims through the anomaly he finds himself in a tropical sea with a flock of ''Hesperornis'' swimming around him. He later finds a ''Hesperornis'' rookery amongst the rocky shoreline. Two ''Hesperornis'' investigate, but Helen Cutter shoos them off by throwing small stones, and says that they ''&quot;tend to be more dumb than violent, only attacking when they're in a panic or disturbed.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;epThree&quot;&gt;{{cite episode|title=Episode 1.3|series=Primeval|serieslink=Primeval|network=[[ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|airdate=2007-03-17|season=1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Hesperornis'' is shown as being covered in scales when in real life, ''Hesperornis'' was likely covered in feathers. Also they were not able to stand upright or walk as the legs attached far at the back and sideways, with even the lower leg being tightly attached to the body. Thus, they were limited to sliding on their belly or [[galumphing]].&lt;ref&gt;Discussed in detail by Gregory (1952).&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Hyaenodon]]'' is an extinct genus of Hyaenodonts, a group of carnivorous creodonts of the family Hyaenodontidae. Some species of this genus were amongst the largest terrestrial carnivorous mammals of their time, others were only of the size of a [[marten]]. They had very massive skulls but only small brains. It had a long skull with a narrow snout - much larger in relation to the length of the skull than in canine carnivores, for instance. Its neck was shorter than its skull, while its body was long and robust and terminated in a long tail. Despite the name, these creatures are not related to hyenas.

A total of two adults and three cub Hyaenodons came through an anomaly in the wine cellar of a stately mansion, where Jenny Lewis is getting married, in episode 4.6, making a den. An adult killed a wedding planner in the cellar where the pups were. Connor stunned one male Hyaenodon and it was sent back through the anomaly. He was trapped in the cellar because of the female, and gave some wine to two cubs to knock them out and returned them to the anomaly before trying to get the third through as well, only to allow the male back through. The two adults attacked the wedding party and were fought off with medieval weapons. All the Hyaenodons were returned.

Like many crocodiles of the Cretaceous period, ''Kaprosuchus'' was not restricted to river ecosystems; judged by its long legs and impressive dentition, this four-legged reptile roamed the plains of Africa much in the style of a big cat. In fact, with its big tusks, powerful jaws and {{Convert|6.1|m|ft|adj=on}} span, ''Kaprosuchus'' may have been capable of taking down comparably sized herbivorous (or even carnivorous) dinosaurs. 

A ''Kaprosuchus''  appeared in episode 4.2, having grown from a  hatchling flushed into the sewer 5 years previously into an adult preying on the homeless living by the Thames. It's presence was discovered by Connor, Abby and Duncan, who alerted the ARC with Matt after he saved them from its initial attack when its home was set on fire by construction workers. Though it was brought down by an EMD and contained, it woke up and escaped, chasing Duncan into a maze of containers, killing an soldier. After forcing it out of a maze of containers, the team inadvertently killed it with EMDs since the firepower was too much for it.

Another appears in Episode 5.5, coming through a new anomaly during the anomaly convergance, and attacking Connor and Philip's car. Philip left Connor on his own, and Connor called Abby for help, who arrived and brought it down with an EMD while driving. Wthere or not it survived and was returned, or whether it was killed is unknown. 

The ''Kaprosuchus'' also appears on the Watch YouTube Game. It would take two hits to kill the ''Kaprosuchus''.

''[[Labyrinthodontia|Labyrinthodonts]]'' were generally amphibian-like in build. They were short-legged and mostly large headed, with moderately short to long tails. Many groups, and all the early forms, were large animals. Primitive members of all labyrinthodont groups were probably true water predators, and various degrees of amphibious, semi-aquatic and semi terrestrial modes of living arose independently in different groups. Some lineages remained or became secondarily fully aquatic with reduced limbs and elongated, eel-like bodies.

A  large (several metres long) Labyrinthodont with a very long tail, and a juvenile, appeared in a seaside cave in episode 4.5.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itv.com/drama/primeval/creatures/labyrinthodont/ Primeval creatures -Labyrinthodont]&lt;/ref&gt; The adult had been causing many people and animal stock to go missing over the ten years since the anomaly had previously been open. It killed someone camping out to investigate the 'Witchfield Worm', and Matt Anderson saved a fisherman from been devoured too. Abby Maitland pursued the creature to a campsite where she lured it on top of a caravan and drove it part way to the anomaly site. Connor Temle discovered the infant in the cave, and its cries of pain caused by acid drew the adult back. It killed two people, one of whom had known about the creature and attempted to contain it, before being driven back through the anomaly by Connor and Abby.

''Lioplaurodon'' are a species of [[Pliosaur]], an extinct type of marine reptiles.

In the ''The Lost Island'' novel, a ''Liopleurodon'' sinks a trawler boat in the Atlantic south of Ireland, at Guns Island, and it later encountered by the team in the water. It seems heavily resistant to bullets, but when the team discover it, it is dying from the cold of the Atlantic winter. 

In episode 5.2 a Liopleurodon comes through an anomaly in the North Sea, and attacks a naval submarine with the team aboard, disabling it. The submarine is drawn into the anomaly to the Jurassic and the Liopleurodon follows it back. A pod of them swim around the submarine, banging against it to see if it was food. When a swimming theropod was ejected from the vessel, all of the creatures went after the distraction as one of the Liopleurodons ate it.

ITV launched a competition for a viewer to design a creature, which was judged by the creators and will appear in Series 3. The winner was 16-year-old Carim Nahaboo from [[Essex]],&lt;ref name=winnerrevaled&gt;[http://www.itv.com/Drama/cult/Primeval/Series3/Winnerrevealed/default.html Cult|Primeval|Series 3|Winner revealed - ITV Drama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; whose creature is a large predatory insect from the future which, as Carim described, &quot;evolved from carnivorous beetles, such as the [[tiger beetle]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=insect&gt;[http://www.itv.com/Drama/cult/Primeval/Series3/Competition/default.html Cult|Primeval|Series 3|Competition - ITV Drama&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; However, the series described it as evolving from either wasps or ants. The creature can fly and run fast over long distances, and lives in future jungles.&lt;ref name=insect /&gt; It is known as Megopteran. 

In episode 3.8 a group of them are gassed out by Danny and become the team's distraction when they are surrounded in a bus by [[Future Predator]]s - a vicious fight ensures that the team escapes. As they do, a larger Megopteran appears and heads in their direction, but is not seen afterwards. They are shown to have an [[ovipositor]], with which they can lay eggs into a host. Three creatures re-appear in the Series 3 finale and are seen rampaging around in Christine Johnson's base. Two are killed by Becker using electrical wires and the third one is presumably dead.

The ''Mer'' first appear in episode 2.4. They are aquatic predators from the future, using the sewer network to hunt and trap prey. They successfully capture and drag Abby into their timezone, where the team later ventures to retrieve her. They have thin skulls, and can be rendered unconscious by having heavy objects, such as stones, thrown on their heads. Nick Cutter speculated that the Mer may be descendants of humans.

There appear to be two types of Mer;
* The ''Mer Queen'' who is red in colour, and much larger than her subordinates. She has tusks on her lower jaw, where as the others do not. When Abby attempts to escape from the future, the Mer Queen reacts violently, to the point that she crushes any other Mer in her path.
* The remaining Mer are blueish in colour, and work at capturing food. They do not immediately kill their prey, instead dragging it back to their home, where presumably it is later consumed.

In episode 2.6 and 2.7, it is revealed Leek has managed to acquire a Mer for his collection. The creature eventually escapes the feeding chamber, and attempts to break down a door to leave the bunker, before returning to the feeding room in an attempt by Cutter, Stephen and Helen to trap the creatures there, so that they kill each other.

The [[Silurian period]] is shown as being home to not only [[#Silurian Scorpion|giant scorpions]], but also [[Eoarthropleura|millipedes]] which roam in groups across the sand. They prefer to hide in the sand but may emerge if frightened by a predator. These millipedes are likely to be the staple food source for the giant scorpions.

In episode 2.5, Nick Cutter and Stephen Hart noticed a large group of them travelling on the sand, which they failed to realise were fleeing from the scorpions. One entered the present era briefly but was captured by Abby in a ball pool before it was returned back into the past.

''[[Mosasaur]]s'' were serpentine marine reptiles and ferocious predators. Mosasaurs were not dinosaurs but evolved from semi-aquatic [[squamates]] known as the [[aigialosaur]]s, close relatives of modern-day monitor lizards.&lt;ref name=&quot;palaeos&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.palaeos.com/Vertebrates/Units/Unit260/260.100.html|title=Palaeos Vertebrates 260.100 Pythonomorpha: Pythonomorpha|publisher=Palaeos.com|date=|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceansofkansas.com/Greatrep.html|title=Mosasaurs: Last of the Great Marine Reptiles|publisher=Oceansofkansas.com|date=18 July 2009|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosasaurs breathed air and were powerful swimmers that were well-adapted to living in the warm, shallow epicontinental seas prevalent during the Late Cretaceous Period. Mosasaurs are intensely territorial and cannibals, and the only meetings between them that do not end in violence occur when the Mosasaurs in question are of opposite sexes, and there is the possibility of mating.&lt;ref name=&quot;epThree&quot; /&gt;

The skull was more robustly built than other Mosasaurs, as the [[mandible]]s articulated very tightly with the skull. It had a deep, barrel-shaped body, and with its fairly large eyes, poor binocular vision, and poorly developed olfactory bulbs, experts believe that ''Mosasaurs'' lived near the ocean surface, where it preyed on fish, turtles, ammonites as well as smaller ''Mosasaurs''. Because of its robust skull and tightly articulating jaws, mosasaurs was unable to swallow prey-items whole in the manner of earlier mosasaurs, such as ''[[Tylosaurus]]''. Instead, with the aid of its curved, knife-like teeth, mosasaurs was able to tear its prey into more manageable pieces that could be more easily swallowed.

The Mosasaur was shown to have an armored crocodile-like body, but in reality it would have been smooth-skinned and streamlined, and covered in more lizard- or snake-like scales. Also it swallowed the lifeguard whole even though its jaw and enlarged neck muscles were evolved to tear and rip prey apart. The ''Mosasaur'' depicted also has a more tapering, snake-like body than its real life counterpart, and a pair of short horns over the head, like a theropod dinosaur.

They feed off the nutrients in the bloodstream of its host, destroying the internal organs in the process. It then burrows into the brain of the carrier and manipulates it for the benefit of the ''Parasite''. The ''Parasite'' causes the host to become aggressive and photophobic. The bite of the host serves to spread the ''Parasite's'' eggs, which are released into the saliva, to a new host.&lt;ref name=&quot;epFour&quot; /&gt; It is hinted that the parasites could be responsible for the Vampire myth.

The mature ''Parasites'' eventually kill the host and themselves as part of their reproductive cycle. Each individual has male and female reproductive structures in its [[proglottid]] and can reproduce independently. Any warm-blooded creature is an acceptable host, even humans.

''[[Phorusrhacidae|Phorusrhacids]]'' or &quot;Terror Birds&quot; are large carnivorous flightless birds that were the dominant predators in South America shortly during the Cenozoic period, 62-2.5 million years ago. They were roughly {{Convert|1|â|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} tall. ''Titanis walleri'', one of the largest species, is known from North America, marking one of the comparatively rare examples where animals that evolved in South America managed to spread north after the Isthmus of Panama land bridge formed. Their wings evolved into meat hook-like structures that likely could be outstretched like arms to perform a hacking motion to help bring down prey. Like the armour-plated ostriches they resemble, Terror Birds are also very fast runners.

They first appear in episode 3.6. They first came through the anomaly in the 1950s, and attacked and killed scientists that were studying the anomaly. When the anomaly reopened in the present day, they came through again, and one was drawn to a cabin the team were hiding it due to a distress call they had accidentally played. It chased the team in their car, and Danny Quinn fought it off with a pipe before tey crashed. Abby Maitland and Sarah Page fled while Danny used Connor Temple as bait to draw in the bird, trapping it by hooking its leg into the car's tow cable. Abby and Sarah were chased by several more and chased to a minefield along with Danny and Connor, and Danny lured on onto a mine, killing it. Another attacked and killed one of Captain Ross's soldiers and was killed as the car exploded on a mine and the shrapnel cut through the bird's neck. The rest of the flock attack the cabin, and Connor distracted them so that Danny could play the distress call recording to lure them back to the anomaly.

A single terror bird attacked in a prison in episode 4.7, coming through a &quot;satellite anomaly&quot; and killing a tourist. It returned through the main anomaly and was driven back by the team, however it appeared through another satellite anomaly Abby and Becker found. It was allowed to go through the main anomaly, but it returned again to distract the team as they were attempting to capture Ethan Dobrowski. Connor and Abby chased after it, and Danny arrived to help knock it through a satellite anomaly. Again the terror bird returned, this time being brought down by Matt Anderson's EMD. Abby contained it in a storage closet, but it was set free by Ethan/Patrick to menace Emily merchant, but luckily used a club to bring it down again. It was presumably returned back to its own time after that.

A ''Pristichampsus'' came through an anomaly in episode 3.1. It killed the caretaker Marianne but left her body, possibly as a warning to competitors. It attacked Sarah Page but escaped from the museum at its first opportunity through the docking door. It went on to kill a traffic warden and then swam across the Thames to a restaurant, attracted by the scent of hot food. It escaped to the top floor in a lift and attacked a cleaning woman. Cutter saved her by luring it out a window. The Pristichampsus fell, injuring its leg. It then started to return to the museum and the anomaly, its instinct to survive outweighing its instinct to hunt. Cutter, Becker and an armed escort met the creature there, but taking Sarah and Abby's advice, bowed to show there were not a threat. The ''Pristichampsus'' passed them without attacking and climbed through the anomaly just before it closed.

Throughout the episode, several other ''Pristichampsus'' almost came through the anomaly. It was revealed in the episode that ''Pristichampsus'' was the inspiration for the Egyptian goddess Amut. Cutter used this as an example that some of the anomalies and the creatures that came through them were the inspiration for myths and legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newseasonnewhorizons.com|title=newseasonnewhorizons.com|publisher=newseasonnewhorizons.com|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Pteranodon]]'' was a large [[Pterosaur]], notable for its skull crest. These may have been used as [[mating display]]s, or it might have acted as a [[rudder]], or perhaps both; also, it may have acted as a counterweight to the large beak. Despite its huge size, at {{convert|9|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} ''Pteranodon'' is not the biggest of the pterosaurs; creatures such as ''[[Quetzalcoatlus]]'' could reach {{Convert|13|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;herebemonsters&quot; /&gt;

It could, like the modern-day [[albatross]], glide by navigating through thermals because the ''Pteranodon'' had a high [[aspect ratio]] (wingspan to [[chord (aircraft)|chord]] length) similar to that of the albatross â 9:1 for ''Pteranodon'', compared to 8:1 for an albatross, but was also fully capable of powered flight.&lt;ref name=PW96&gt;{{cite book|last=Wellnhofer|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Wellnhofer|title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Pterosaurs|origyear=1991|year=1996|publisher=Barnes and Noble Books|location=New York|isbn=0-7607-0154-7|page=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Identified as ''P. ingens'' in Wellnhofer, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

In episode 1.5, a ''Pteranodon'' appears from an anomaly above a [[golf course]], where it apparently attacks Connor and Rex.

More recently they were listed as ''[[Dromaeosaurus]]''.

The parents appear to invest little care in their young and are likely to forget the offspring is theirs if separated for too long, often resulting in [[cannibalism]], although it was not confirmed that the cannibal Raptor was a parent and may have just been a rogue, or that if raptors were like lions, then Rogue was killing the defeated male's offspring. Raptors are shown as being covered in scales with a small crest of protofeathers that can be raised up like hackles when attacking.

In episode 2.1 two adults and an infant ''Deinonychus'' came through a shopping mall anomaly; one adult was decapitated by the closing anomaly, the other was returned and the infant was canabilised by one of the adults. They appear again in ''The Lost Island'' novel, hunting and killing three people marooned with the team in the Early Cretaceous. They are described as being Dromaeosaurs, but are also said to bear a resemblance to the Raptors in the earlier shopping mall episode. In episode 2.6 and episode 2.7 at least two fully grown Deinonychus were seen in Leeks creature prison. They were killed in a fight with other creatures at the end of the episode 2.7.

Episode 3.4 shows Mick Harper and [[Nigel Marven]] approaching a juvenile ''Velociraptor'' in an aircraft hangar, before Nigel was killed by the ''Giganotosaurus'' that followed it. ''Velociraptor'' also feature in Fire and Water. 

''Dromaeosaurus'' made an in episode 3.10, attacking Danny Quin, Conner Temple and Abby Maitland. Three are seen feasting on another raptor's carcass in a forest and they then proceed to attack the three members of the team before they were knocked out by a stun grenade. Another raptor later followed Danny through an anomaly into Pliocene Africa and charged at Helen and knocks her off a cliff, killing them both.

In episode 4.1 in the Cretaceous a male Dromaeosaurus takes Abby's blanket to decorate its bower so as to impress a mate. It was later lured by Abby with her blanket to provide a distraction for a Spinosaurus standing near an anomaly, and after a brief fight the raptor was killed.

In episode 5.3, a ''Deinonychus'' was responsible for several murders in the Victorian era. Matt and Emily encounter it and have a small battle with it. It later kills Henry Merchant before being shot by Becker.

The ''Deinonychus'' also appears on the Watch YouTube game. It takes one shot to kill it.

''[[Sarcopterygian]]s'' are a group of prehistoric fish which are traditionally classed as [[lobe-finned fish]], which in the real world include the modern day [[lungfish]] and the [[coelacanth]], ''[[Latimeria]]''. These are bony fish with paired rounded fins. The fin-limbs of ''Sarcopterygiians'' are so like the expected ancestral form of [[Tetrapod|tetrapod limbs]] that they have been universally considered the direct ancestors of land vertebrates.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nelson&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Fishes of the World]]|last=Nelson|first=Joseph S.|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]], Inc|year=2006|isbn=0-471-25031-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarcopterygians have modified cosmoid scales, which are thinner than true cosmoid scales, which can only be found on extinct fish. Coelacanths also have a special electroreceptive device called a rostral organ in the front of the skull, which probably helps in prey detection.

One fossilised member of this group appears in the first episode, Cutter explaining that this specimen appears in the fossil record at a time when it should have been extinct for 70 million years, and the fact that a live one appeared in the [[Indian Ocean]]. This suggests that there has been at least one anomaly in the distant past, and one outside of Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;epOne&quot; /&gt; This was later confirmed in the ''Primeval'' spin-off novel ''Shadow of the Jaguar''.

''[[Scutosaurus]]'' was a genus of armour-covered Permian period [[pareiasaur]], loosely related to the turtles. Its genus name refers to large plates of bony [[scute]]s ([[osteoderm]]s) set in the skin, as a defence against predators. But the most unusual thing about them were the heavy [[skull]]s ornamented with strange knobs and ridges. It was of a very heavy build, almost [[rhinoceros]]-like. Unlike most reptiles, held its legs underneath its body with stubby toes to support its great weight.

They have an important role in episode 1.1 and in episode 1.6 a herd if briefly seen on a hillside, in episode 2.6 they are seen locked up at the rear of Leek's animal containment facility and in episode 2.7 they play a more important role, being used by the team to kill two of Leek's men.

These fearsome-looking animals were in fact inoffensive [[herbivore]]s, which were well adapted to the dry conditions which covered much of [[Pangaea]] at that time. A social animal, they migrated in large groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;herebemonsters&quot; /&gt; The leaf-shaped multi-cusped teeth resemble those of [[iguana]]s, [[Caseidae|caseids]], and other reptilian herbivores. This dentition, together with the deep capacious body which would have housed an extensive [[digestive tract]]. When in the past, they see several more ''Scutosaurus'' roaming a desert.&lt;ref name=&quot;epOne&quot; /&gt;

Although initially described correctly as a [[pareiasaur]], this species is from then on called a [[dinosaur]] throughout the episode in which it appears. Although based on the heavily armoured species called ''Scutosaurus kapinski'' that lived about 250 million years ago in Russia, the size of the ''Scutosaurus'' in the series is exaggerated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Framestore&quot; /&gt; It is described as at least &quot;five or six tons&quot; in weight, about as big as an elephant. In fact the actual ''Scutosaurus'' was much smaller, no more than {{Convert|3|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length. They appear locked up at the end of episode 2.7.

The Silurian Scorpion is a prehistoric creature from the Silurian that grows to immense sizes, and is a variety of animal similar to ''[[Brontoscorpio]]''. They have a long whip-like tail, spikes on the foreclaws and a flattened body, similar to modern day [[Uropygid|whip scorpion]]s. The scorpions never come through the anomaly in their first appearance, but did in the second season finale, along with many other creatures. They are probably reimagined from the ones in ''Walking with Monsters'' by the producers to make them bigger and more frightening. They hunt by sensing surface vibrations and burrowing underground, similar to the giant worms from the film ''[[Tremors (film)|Tremors]]''. Their main food source appears to be the Silurian millipedes. In reality, scorpions of this size would not be able to breathe, let alone move about.

The scorpions made a reappearance in episode 2.7. One of them was released onto a crowded beach by [[Oliver Leek]] to show his power, where it promptly ate two tourists and scared everyone else away. [[Stephen Hart (Primeval)|Stephen Hart]] set out to deal with it on his own, and harpooned it below a bridge. The still alive creature was left to be collected at leisure. Its fate was unknown, but presumably it was killed.

They appear in a flashback in episode 3.2, when Cutter recognizes the Cleaner and thought he was killed by the scorpions. They are referred to as &quot;Silurian Scorpions&quot; in the episode, but they are listed as &quot;Giant scorpion&quot; on the ''Primeval'' official websites.

''[[Smilodon]]'' is a vicious carnivorous sabre-toothed cat that lived in the [[Pleistocene]] in both [[North America|North]] and [[South America]]. They are commonly and incorrectly called &quot;sabre toothed tigers&quot; where, in truth, all modern day tigers evolved from a different line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/mammal/carnivora/sabretooth.html|title=What Is a Sabertooth?|publisher=Ucmp.berkeley.edu|date=|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fully-grown ''Smilodon'' weighed approximately {{Convert|200|kg|lb|-1|abbr=on}} and had a short tail, powerful legs, and a large head. The cats have two huge canine teeth, about {{Convert|17|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} long, that are used to kill prey by suffocation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/news/article.html?in_article_id=68431&amp;in_page_id=34|title=Sabre-toothed cat 'bit of a pussy'|publisher=Metro.co.uk|date=2 October 2007|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jaws could open to about 120 [[degree (angle)|degree]]s in order to use these fangs to deadly effect. They eventually died out due to climate change.

''Smilodon'' was mentioned in episode 1.4 by [[Helen Cutter]] as &quot;sabre-toothed killers&quot;. However, she apparently lied when she claimed they would come through at that point, and escaped through the Spaghetti Junction. They are also seen, in skeleton form, in Cutter's office. The cat made a proper appearance in the second series, rampaging through a local park. It was being looked after by a ranger named Valerie, who apparently had cared for it since it first came through, as a cub. She was later killed by it (though the casualty is not shown). The cat was apparently killed by a heart attack after being tranquillised. When [[Nick Cutter|Cutter]] hears of this he is puzzled since it was healthy, pointing towards other involvement. In fact, the sabre-tooth was really smuggled along with several other creatures. It reappears in episode 2.6 and episode 2.7.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.douglashenshall.com/2PrimevalThorpeParkreport.html/ Primeval filming in Thorpe Park]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' is the largest carnivorous dinosaur, weighing {{Convert|4|-|8|t|LT|0|abbr=on}} and {{Convert|18|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} in length. It lived in Africa in the late [[Cretaceous]]. It is bipedal has a large &quot;sail&quot; on its back, though the one in the show included an additional mini sail on its tail.

In episode 4.1, a Spinosaurus is stalking Connor and Abby in the Cretaceous when the pair open an [[Anomaly]] to the present using Helen's anomaly device. Abby lures a raptor towards the territorial Spinosaurus to distract it, and the larger dinosaur wins the fight while the two slip through the anomaly. When the anomaly was accidentally unlocked it came through and rampaged through the city, and was lured into an arena to be contained. Connor attempted to open another anomaly as Abby distracted it with lights and music and Becker and his men brought it down with their new EMDs. However it got back up and tried to attack Connor and Matt who were hanging from the ceiling, and it swallows the anomaly device and disappears into the anomaly created by it inside the Spinosaurus' stomach.

Spinosaurus was seen again in Episode 5.5, though this was stock from 4.1.

A row of plates along its back, its most recognizable feature, may have been used as a cooling system in hot weather or to flash colour that could be used to entice mates or threaten enemies and predators.

[[Therocephalia]]ns are an extinct suborder of carnivorous eutheriodont therapsids that lived from the middle and late Permian into the Triassic. Therocephalians (&quot;beast-heads&quot;) are named after their large skulls, which, along with the structure of their teeth, suggest that they were successful carnivores. Like other non-mammalian synapsids, therocephalians are described as mammal-like reptiles, although in fact, Therocephalia is the group most closely related to the cynodonts, which gave rise to the mammals. The earlier therocephalians were in many respects as primitive as the gorgonopsids, but they did show certain advanced features. The discovery of maxilloturbinal ridges in some specimens suggests that at least some therocephalians may have been warm-blooded.

A species of Therocephalian appears in episode 4.4. Numerous creatures the size of a large dog come through an anomaly at a school, and kill a teacher and a female student. Matt, Becker, and Connor deal with the venomous creatures, and Becker was bitten by one of the venomous creatures to paralyse him, but later recovered.

''[[Thylacosmilus]]'' was a [[marsupial|pouched]] carnivore, resembling a sabre-toothed cat, that lived in [[South America]] 2 million years ago. It had a long, curving chin and a large pair of sabre teeth used for killing its prey. ''Thylacosmilus'' eventually went extinct due to being outcompeted by true sabre-tooth cats such as ''Smilodon''.

In ''Shadow of the Jaguar'', the first known anomaly to open overseas is in a biological reserve in the [[Peru]]vian [[rainforest]] and allows a pack of ''[[Thylacosmilus]]'' access to the modern world. They proceed to go on the rampage, wiping out several small villages, killing one of the sons of a senior man to [[Sir James Lester]] (Sir Charles), killing a [[sloth]] and killing several members of the SAS. A second pride of six ''Thylacosmilus'' are followed and some are killed by the SAS. It turns out that the ''Thylacosmilus'' are under the control of a [[#Future Bird|creature from the future]], which is using pheromones to control the pack's instinct and use them like hunting hounds. After the team disrupt the bird's control, the ''Thylacosmilus'' flee in terror back through the anomaly, just before it closes.

''[[Troodon]]'' are small carnivorous dinosaurs from the Late Cretaceous. They had the largest brain of any dinosaur.

Several  are encountered in ''Extinction Event'', where they are described as being ruthless predators. They were first encountered feasting on the carcass of a dead ''Anatotitan'', which had apparently been killed by shock, as a result of a meteor strike. Later, Jenny and Helen Cutter are in the Cretaceous period, and one of the mercenary soldiers assigned to help them, Tim Jenkins, was dragged away by the Troodons, who ate him alive due to his crippling caused by a Dimetrodon. The rest of the team too late to save him. Later in the present, a pack of Troodon showed up at the overturned car Jenny and Hemple were in. Jenny attempted to keep them at bay by using a large metal rod that she had found in the truck's wreck. However, one of the Troodon then knocked her down to the ground, and pinned her down, with its foot. Just as it was about to kill her, the car's ruptured fuel tank caught on fire, scaring the Troodons away.

''[[Tyrannosaurus]]'' is the most well known carnivorous dinosaur despite not being the largest. 

In ''Extinction Event'', a pair of Tyrannosaurus stalk the forests of Siberia, referred to many as [[Baba Yaga]] after a figure in Russian folklore. The female does most of the damage, killing a ''Torosaurus'' calf and several men before it encounters the male ''Tyrannosaurus'', which has just arrived from the Cretaceous having killed a ''Pachycephalosaurus''. The male and female fight, and the female kills her smaller rival. Surprisingly, the female ''Tyrannosaurus'' is not stopped, and merely returns to the dank, Russian forests, having killed her competitor.

In Episode 5.5 one rampaged through the streets of London, killing a few people until shot multiple times by Matt with an EMD it is unknown if it survived. This creature was the initial cause of the public's realisation of the anomalies.

Although many invertebrates are commonly called worms, the Primeval worms are very large carnivorous worms from some time before the [[oxygen catastrophe]], 2.7 billion years ago. In reality such a creature is impossible - for any lifeform to grow that big it would need an atmosphere more energy-rich than the fog they live in and they would not be able to breathe let alone move in it. The worms have long retractable mouthparts, large enough to engulf a man, for feeding. These creatures were based on marine [[ragworm]]s. The worms need movement to see their prey, and can be fooled if a person stands still and throws an inanimate object&lt;ref name=&quot;epEight&quot; /&gt;

In the episode, the worms cannot survive outside the &quot;fog&quot;, which is first shown when Nick and Stephen trap the mouthparts in a door separating the fog: if separated from their natural atmosphere, oxygen, highly poisonous to them, kills them. The fog is the Pre-Cambrian atmosphere, which presumably comes through the [[Anomaly (Primeval)|anomaly]]. When they are faced with an increase of heat, they explode to spawn their young which then attempt to burrow into a living host. They can also spit a brown-coloured slime, which might be used to track or even attack their prey&lt;ref name=&quot;epEight&quot; /&gt; This life cycle is not dissimilar to the [[#Parasite|parasite]]. 

It also reappears in a classroom during the convergence of the anomalies in Series 5.
