'''Tatra T 163 Jamal''' is a heavy truck made by Czech company [[Tatra (company)|Tatra]]. It uses the traditional [[Tatra_%28company%29#Tatra_concept|tatra concept]] of rigid backbone tube and [[Swing axle|swinging half-axles]] giving independent suspension. The vehicles are available primarily in [[6x6]] and alternatively also [[4x4]] variants. It is marketed either as road-legal heavy truck (tipper or semi-trailer truck) or as working machine (to be used i.e. in mines). The T163 is continuation of tradition started with [[Tatra T111|Tatra T 111]], which played crucial role in effort to rebuild [[Central Europe|Central]] and [[Eastern Europe]] after the WW2 as well as in conquering the [[Russian far east]].

==History==
At the beginning of the 1980s both conventional [[Tatra T148|Tatra T 148]] and [[Cab over|COE]] [[Tatra T813|Tatra T 813s]] were succeeded by the single line of COE [[Tatra T815|Tatra T 815s]]. However Tatra aimed to develop a conventional heavy [[dump truck]] for use in the hardest of conditions (i.e. mines). This led to the [[Tatra T 162]] prototype, which wasn't introduced into serial production. Later in 1995 the first prototype of the upcoming T 163 line was constructed, though it was designated as T-815-24BSK8. The traditional design offers higher safety for the driver and easier access to the engine. The bonnet is made from a light laminate and it folds forward.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatra page&quot;&gt;{{cs icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.tatra-page.kx.cz/Description/T-163.htm|title=:Tatrapage:Tatra 163|accessdate=2010-08-23|work=tatra-page.kx.cz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A truck with conventional setting of cabin was demanded especially by Tatra's customers from Russian Siberia (where Tatra's air-cooled engines require less maintenance compared to water-cooled ones). The main reason, why the conventional cab is preferred, is that the driver may warm up in the cabin even during a potential on-road engine repair (the cabin has independent heating).&lt;ref name=&quot;svet motoru&quot;&gt;{{cs icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.tatraportal.com/clanky/jamal/ds2005_01-2.jpg|title=SvÄt motorÅ¯: Tatra Jamal a spol.|accessdate=2010-08-23|work=SvÄt motorÅ¯ 45/2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1995-1998 a number of prototypes were manufactured. Since 1997 a prototype was tested in the most demanding environment of Arctic Siberia, later to be handed over to a gas drilling company.&lt;ref name=&quot;automobil&quot;&gt;{{cs icon}} {{Cite web|url=http://www.tatraportal.com/clanky/t163jamal/a1999_08-1.jpg|title=Automobil:NÃ¡vrat kapotovÃ½ch vozÅ¯ - T163 Jamal|accessdate=2010-08-23|work=Automobil 8/1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 the bonnet is shortened by 295&amp;nbsp;mm to comply to directives concerning maximum length of truck and trailer. In 1999 the truck is certified for use on the roads of the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Russia and later the same year the full production began.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tatra page&quot; /&gt;
