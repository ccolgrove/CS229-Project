{{History of Bahrain}}
The '''2011 Bahraini uprising''', sometimes called the '''February 14 Revolution''' ({{lang-ar|Ø«ÙØ±Ø© 14 ÙØ¨Ø±Ø§ÙØ± }}) is a series of demonstrations, amounting to a sustained campaign of [[civil resistance]], in the [[Persian Gulf]] country of [[Bahrain]]. As part of the [[revolutionary wave]] of protests in the [[Arab Spring|Middle East and North Africa]] following the self-immolation of [[Mohammed Bouazizi]] in Tunisia, the Bahraini protests were initially aimed at achieving greater [[political freedom]] and equality for the majority [[Shia]] population,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/wikileaks-files/bahrain-wikileaks-cables/8334600/BAHRAINS-SHIA-POLITICAL-LEADERS-VISIT-IRAQ.html &quot;Bahrain Shi Leaders Visit Iraq&quot;].

Protesters in Manama camped out for days at the Pearl Roundabout, which functioned as the centre point of protests there. After a month, the government requested [[Peninsula Shield Force#2011|troops]] and police from the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]], which arrived on 14 March, and a day later, the king of Bahrain declared [[martial law]] and a three-month [[state of emergency]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCBahr15Mar&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title = Bahrain King Declares State of Emergency after Protests | author=[[Staff writer]] | url = http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12745608 |publisher=BBC News  | date=15 March 2011 | accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Cloud, David S.; Banerjee, Neela | url = http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-bahrain-flashpoint-20110316,0,1785627.story | title = Bahrain Protests: In Bahrain, Forces Move Against Protesters in Capital&amp;nbsp;â Military Units and Police Push into Pearl Square Early Wednesday; Shooting Is Heard, But There Is No Word on Casualties&amp;nbsp;â A Day Earlier, Bahrain's King Imposed a Three-Month State of Emergency and Ordered the Military To Battle the Unrest |work=Los Angeles Times | date=16 March 2011 | accessdate=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[BBC News]] on 14 March, most of the opposition protesters had said they did not want to overthrow the monarchy but want the ruling family to give up most of its powers to the elected parliament.

The Shia citizens also demand an end to the mass [[naturalisation]] of Sunni foreigners, primarily from Pakistan, which is seen as an attempt to shift the demographics in the population.

However the Bahraini government claimed in a confidential report to the UN in April 2011 that Lebanese political organisation [[Hezbollah]], considered a terrorist group by the US, is present in Bahrain and is actively involved in the organisation of the unrest.&lt;ref&gt; Elise Labott [http://articles.cnn.com/2011-04-25/world/bahrain.hezbollah_1_wefaq-hezbollah-camps-hassan-nasrallah?_s=PM:WORLD &quot;Bahrain government accuses Hezbollah of aiding opposition groups&quot;], ''CNN World'', 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; JAY SOLOMON [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703907004576279121469543918.html &quot;Bahrain Sees Hezbollah Plot in ProtestBahrain Sees Hezbollah Plot in Protest&quot;], ''The Wall Street Journal'', 25 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Incarcerations===
Amongst the more prominent opposition figures, the Al-Khawaja family has been intermittently in and out of prison, even before the uprising began. Since the start of the uprising, [[Abdulhadi Alkhawaja]], the former president of the Bahrain Center for Human Rights, was placed on trial for his part in the uprising. On 22 June, he was sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jun/22/bahrain-activist-zainab-al-khwaja | title= Bahraini activist's father jailed for life | author=Peter Walker | date= 22 June 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK| accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His daughters and sons-in-law have also been intermittently in and out of prison since the counter-revolutionary crackdown by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/06/22/bahrain-sentences-activists-to-life-in-jail/ | title= Bahrain Sentences Activists to Life in Jail | author=Robert Mackey | date= 22 June 2011|work=The Guardian |location=UK| accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ayat Al-Qurmozi]] was also found guilty of organising protests and assembling at the Pearl Roundabout and reading a poem critical of government policy. Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Mubarak, her spokesman, said that the poem &quot;caused incitement and hatred to his majesty the king and to the prime minister&quot; with lines such as &quot;we are people who kill humiliation&quot; and &quot;assassinate misery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/06/12/bahrain.unrest/ | title= Bahrain tries ex-lawmakers, imprisons poet | author=[[Nic Robertson]] | date= 12 June 2011| publisher=CNN| accessdate=12 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Torture claims===
In the period following the 2011 uprising numerous allegations of government-sponsored torture were reported in the media by human rights groups. The government has also alleged that protestors abducted and tortured members of the security forces,&lt;ref&gt;Andy Sambidge [http://www.arabianbusiness.com/bahrain-minister-says-24-people-dead-in-uprisings-390813.html &quot;Bahrain minister says 24 people dead in uprisings&quot;], ''Arabian Business'', 29 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and there is evidence that Asian migrant workers were also subjected to attacks by groups of  protestors.&lt;ref&gt;MANDEEP SINGH [http://www.gulf-daily-news.com/NewsDetails.aspx?storyid=302163 &quot;34 Asians are injured&quot;], ''Gulf Daily News'', 20 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Independent Investigation Commission|Bahrain Independent Commission of Inquiry]] is tasked with investigating all allegations of torture and is due to report its findings by the end of October 2011.&lt;ref&gt;BICI  [http://www.bici.org.bh/index.php/legal-framework/ âLegal Framework&quot;], ''BICI'', 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The police first claimed to not know of Jawad's whereabouts, then stated Jawad was on a special mission and could not talk on the phone, and finally stated that Jawad had entered a brawl with the army and they were detaining him until the morning.  A female family member placed a call later in the evening to Jawad's mobile phone.  The person who answered claimed to have killed Jawad and then made sexual threats towards her.  The family continued receiving calls from Jawad's mobile phone, including one call impersonating Jawad.&lt;ref name=&quot;bici&quot; /&gt;{{rp|page=256}}  The Commission also cites a government investigation that that the [[Bahrain Defence Force]] fired a .50 calibre Browning bullet at Jawad's car after it rammed into a barricade at the checkpoint.  The government investigation states that the bullet entered Jawad's body above the knee, and exited from his lower abdomen after being deflected off of the body of the vehicle and the tyres.&lt;ref name=&quot;bici&quot; /&gt;{{rp|pages=256-7}}  Amateur video of Jawad's corpse shows injuries to the front of his left knee and the front of his lower abdomen on the left side&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=22 March 2011 |title=Martyr of Al Hajaar Village &quot;Jawad Shamlan&quot; |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aoe7iYu-Tk4}}&lt;/ref&gt;, as well as injuries to his back.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=22 March 2011 |title=Martyr of Al hajaar village of &quot;Jawad Shamlan&quot; |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RYUbgDN1IR8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jawad's family has not been able to recover his car or his two mobile phones.&lt;ref name=&quot;bici&quot; /&gt;{{rp|pages=256}}
