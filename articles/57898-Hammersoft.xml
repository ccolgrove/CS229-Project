'''Norfolk''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|n|Ér|f|i-|k}} {{respell|NOR|fÉk}}) is an [[independent city]] in the [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] in the [[United States of America|United States]]. With a population of 242,803 as of the 2010 Census&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coopercenter.org/demographics]. Weldon Cooper Center 2010 Census Count Retrieved January 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;, it is Virginia's second-largest city behind neighboring [[Virginia Beach]].

Norfolk is located at the core of the [[Hampton Roads]] metropolitan area, named for the large [[harbor|natural harbor]] of the same name located at the mouth of [[Chesapeake Bay]]. It is one of nine cities and seven counties that constitute the Hampton Roads metro area, officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]. The city is bordered to the west by the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] and to the north by the [[Chesapeake Bay]]. It also shares land borders with the independent cities of [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]] to its south and [[Virginia Beach]] to its east. One of the oldest of the cities in [[Hampton Roads]], Norfolk is considered to be the historic, urban, financial, and cultural center of the region.

The city has a long history as a strategic military and transportation point. [[Naval Station Norfolk|Norfolk Naval Base]] is the world's largest such base, and the world's largest military alliance, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] has its defense headquarters here.  The city also has the corporate headquarters of [[Norfolk Southern Railway]], one of North America's principal [[Class I railroad]]s, and [[A. P. Moller-Maersk Group#Maersk Line, Limited|Maersk Line, Limited]], who manages the world's largest fleet of [[Flag State|US-flag vessels]]. As the city is bordered by multiple bodies of water, Norfolk has many miles of riverfront and bayfront property. It is linked to its neighbors by an extensive network of [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate highways]], [[bridge]]s, [[tunnel]]s, and [[bridge-tunnel]] complexes.

==History==
{{Main|History of Norfolk, Virginia}}
In 1619, the Governor for the [[Virginia Colony]], [[George Yeardley|Sir George Yeardley]] established four incorporations, termed citties, for the developed portion of the colony. These formed the basis for colonial representative government in the newly minted [[House of Burgesses]]. What would become Norfolk was put under the [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] incorporation.

In 1622, [[Adam Thoroughgood]] (1604â1640) of [[King's Lynn]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]], came to Virginia as an [[indentured servant]]. At the end of his contracted servitude, he earned his freedom and became a leading citizen of the fledgling colony.

In 1634 [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] reorganized the colony into a system of [[shires of Virginia|shires]]. The former [[Elizabeth City (Virginia Company)|Elizabeth Cittie]] became [[Elizabeth City Shire]]. After persuading 105 people to settle in the colony, Thoroughgood was granted a large land holding along the [[Lynnhaven River]] in 1636.

When the [[South Hampton Roads]] portion of the shire was partitioned off, Thoroughgood suggested the name of his birthplace for the newly formed [[New Norfolk County, Virginia|New Norfolk County]]. One year later, it split into two counties, [[Upper Norfolk County]] and [[Lower Norfolk County, Virginia|Lower Norfolk County]] (present day Norfolk), chiefly on Thoroughgoodâs recommendation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk History Chapter 4&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/04.html| title = The Origins of Norfolk's Name| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Joseph Jenkins Roberts.jpg|thumb|left|[[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], born and raised in Norfolk, became the first President of [[Liberia]].]]Norfolk grew in the late 17th century as a &quot;Half Moone&quot; fort was constructed and {{convert|50|acre|m2}} were acquired in exchange for 10,000 pounds of tobacco. The House of Burgesses established &quot;Towne of Lower Norfolk County&quot; in 1680.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk History Chapter 6&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/06.html| title = The &quot;Half Moone&quot; Fort| accessdate = 2008-02-19| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk History Chapter 7&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/07.html| title = The Birth of &quot;Norfolk Towne&quot;| accessdate = 2008-02-19| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1691, a final county subdivision took place when Lower Norfolk County split to form [[Norfolk County, Virginia|Norfolk County]] (present day Norfolk, Chesapeake, and parts of Portsmouth) and [[Princess Anne County]] (present day Virginia Beach). Norfolk was incorporated in 1705 and in 1736, [[George II of Great Britain|George II]] granted Norfolk a royal charter as a borough.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk History Chapter 9&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/09.html| title = Norfolk Becomes a Borough| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1775, Norfolk developed into what contemporary observers argued was the most prosperous city in Virginia. It was an important port for exporting goods to the British Isles and beyond. In part because of its merchants' numerous trading ties with other parts of the British Empire, Norfolk served as a strong base of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] support during the early part of the [[American Revolution]]. After fleeing the colonial capitol of [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], [[Earl of Dunmore|Lord Dunmore]], the Royal Governor of Virginia, tried to reestablish control of the colony from Norfolk. Dunmore secured small victories at Norfolk but was forced into exile by the American rebels, commanded by [[William Woodford|Colonel Woodford]]. His departure brought an end to more than 168 years of British colonial rule in Virginia.&lt;ref name=&quot;History from Colonial Williamsburg&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.history.org/Almanack/resources/dateline/polcron.cfm#seeds| title = Cultural &amp; Political Chronology (1750-1783)| accessdate = 2007-09-30| publisher = Colonial Williamsburg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On New Year's Day, 1776, Lord Dunmore's fleet of three ships shelled the city of Norfolk for over eight hours. The damage from the shells, and fires started by the British and spread by the patriots, destroyed over 800 buildings, almost two-thirds of the city.  The patriots destroyed the remaining buildings for strategic reasons in February.&lt;ref&gt;Guy, Louis L. jr.[http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/insights/2001_spring/nightmare.html Norfolk's Worst Nightmare], Norfolk Historical Society ''Courier'' (Spring 2001)- accessed 2008-01-03&lt;/ref&gt; Only the walls of [[Saint Paul's Episcopal Church (Norfolk, Virginia)|Saint Paul's Episcopal Church]] survived the bombardment and subsequent fires. A cannonball from the bombardment (fired by the ''[[HMS Liverpool (1758)|Liverpool]]'') remains within the wall of Saint Paul's.&lt;ref name=&quot;HMS Otter&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.virginiastatenavy.com/HMS_OTTER.html| title = HMS Otter| accessdate = 2007-09-30| publisher = Virginia State Navy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following recovery from the Revolutionary War's burning, the 19th century began inauspiciously for Norfolk and her citizens.  In 1804, another serious fire along the cityâs waterfront destroyed some 300 buildings and the city experienced a serious economic setback.

During the 1820s, agrarian communities across the [[Southern United States|American South]] suffered a prolonged recession, which caused many families to migrate to other areas. Many moved west into the [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]], or into [[Kentucky]] and [[Tennessee]].  Such migration also followed the exhaustion of soil due to [[tobacco]] cultivation in the Tidewater.  Virginia made various attempts to phase out [[slavery]], either through law (see [[Thomas Jefferson Randolph]]'s 1832 resolution) or through &quot;[[Back-to-Africa movement|repatriation]]&quot; of blacks to Africa.  Many emigrants to Africa from Virginia and [[North Carolina]] embarked from the port of Norfolk.  [[Joseph Jenkins Roberts]], a native of Norfolk, was an emigrant who became the first president of [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Roberts&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President| title =  Joseph Roberts, Liberia's first President!| accessdate = 2008-02-19| publisher = The African-American Registry |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071123023225/http://www.aaregistry.com/african_american_history/754/Joseph_Roberts_Liberias_first_President &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1861, Norfolk voters instructed their delegate to vote for ratification of the ordinance of secession. Virginia voted to secede from the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]]. In the spring of 1862, the [[Battle of Hampton Roads]] took place off the northwest shore of the city's [[Sewell's Point|Sewell's Point Peninsula]], marking the first fight between two [[ironclad warship|ironclads]], the [[USS Monitor|USS ''Monitor'']] and the [[CSS Virginia|CSS ''Virginia'']]. The battle ended in a stalemate, but forever changed the course of naval warfare; from then on, [[warship]]s were fortified with metal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Monitor-Merrimac&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://americancivilwar.com/monitor.html| title = Battle of the Monitor and the Merrimac| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Americancivilwar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 1862, Norfolk Mayor William Lamb surrendered the city to [[General (United States)|General]] [[John E. Wool]] and [[Union Army|Union forces]].  They held the city under [[martial law]] for the duration of the Civil War.  Thousands of slaves escaped to Union lines to gain their freedom and set up schools in Norfolk so they could start learning before the end of the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk History Chapter 46&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolkhistorical.org/highlights/46.html| title = Lincoln Plans the Recapture of Norfolk| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = Norfolk Historical Society }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1907 brought both the [[Virginian Railway]] and the [[Jamestown Exposition]] to [[Sewell's Point]]. The large [[Naval Review]] at the Exposition demonstrated the peninsula's favorable location and laid the groundwork for the world's largest naval base. Commemorating the 300th anniversary of the founding of Jamestown, the exposition featured many prominent officials, including President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[Member of Congress|members of Congress]], and [[Diplomacy|diplomat]]s from 21 countries. [[Image:Jamestown logo 1907.jpg|thumb|right|170px|Logo for Jamestown Exposition in 1907]]
By 1917, as the US built up to enter [[World War I]], the Naval Air Station Hampton Roads had been constructed on the former exposition grounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jamestown Exposition&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.twainquotes.com/TwainRogersVA.html| title = Mark Twain and Henry Huttleston Rogers in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = http://www.twainquotes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 20th century, Norfolk expanded its borders through annexation. In 1906, the City annexed the [[incorporated town]] of [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], which stretched the city limits across the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk: 1906 Annexation&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1906.asp| title = Norfolk: 1906 Annexation| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = City of Norfolk |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127123719/http://norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1906.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the city expanded to include Sewell's Point, [[Willoughby Spit]], the town of Campostella, and the [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] area. The City included the Navy Base and miles of beach property fronting on [[Hampton Roads]] and [[Chesapeake Bay]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk: 1923 Annexation&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1923.asp| title = Norfolk: 1923 Annexation| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = City of Norfolk |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127131146/http://norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1923.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a smaller annexation in 1959, and a 1988 land swap with [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], the city assumed its current boundaries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Norfolk: 1955 Annexation&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1955.asp| title = Norfolk: 1955 Annexation| accessdate = 2007-10-09| publisher = City of Norfolk |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071127140029/http://norfolk.gov/Neighborhoods/Services/histories_1955.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the dawn of the [[Interstate Highway System]], new highways opened in the region. A series of bridges and tunnels constructed during fifteen years linked Norfolk with [[Virginia Peninsula|the Peninsula]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], and [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]]. In 1952, the [[Downtown Tunnel]] opened to connect Norfolk with the city of Portsmouth. In 1991, the new [[Downtown Tunnel]]/[[Berkley Bridge (Virginia)|Berkley Bridge]] complex opened a new system of multiple lanes of highway and interchanges connecting Downtown Norfolk and [[Interstate 464]] with the Downtown Tunnel tubes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Downtown Tunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/HR_Interstates_Freeways.html| title = Hampton Roads Area Interstates and Freeways| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional bridges and tunnels included the [[Hampton Roads Bridge-Tunnel]] in 1957,&lt;ref name=&quot;Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I64_VA_HRBT.html| title = Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Midtown Tunnel (Virginia)|Midtown Tunnel]] in 1962,&lt;ref name=&quot;Midtown Tunnel&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/Mid_Tunn_Port_Norf_MLK.html| title = Midtown Tunnel Parallel Tube Project| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image:Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel.jpg|left|thumb|Hampton Roads Bridge Tunnel]]
and the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk Expressway]] ([[Interstate 264 (Virginia)|Interstate 264]] and [[State Route 44 (Virginia 1980s)|State Route 44]]) in 1967.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interstate 264&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.roadstothefuture.com/I264_VA_Desc.html| title = Interstate 264 in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-10-02| publisher = Roads to the Future}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruling in the 1954 ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]]'' case which held that [[Racial segregation|segregated]] schools were [[unconstitutional]] and order [[racial integration|integration]], Virginia pursued a policy of &quot;[[massive resistance]]&quot;.  The [[Virginia General Assembly]] prohibited state funding for integrated public schools. Norfolk's [[private school]]s had voluntarily integrated by choosing to comply with the ''Brown'' decision. In 1958, [[United States district court]]s in Virginia ordered schools to open for the first time on a racially-integrated basis. In response, [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] [[James Lindsay Almond, Jr.]] ordered the schools closed.

Six Norfolk public schools serving over 10,000 Norfolk children were closed. The [[Virginia Supreme Court of Appeals]] declared the [[state law]] to be in conflict with the [[Constitution of Virginia|state constitution]] and ordered all public schools to be funded, whether integrated or not. About 10 days later, Almond capitulated and asked the General Assembly to rescind several &quot;massive resistance&quot; laws.&lt;ref name=&quot;Massive Resistance&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.vahistorical.org/civilrights/massiveresistance.htm| title = Massive Resistance - The Civil Rights Movement in Virginia| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = Virginia Historical Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1959, 17 black children entered six previously segregated Norfolk public schools. ''[[The Virginian-Pilot|Virginian-Pilot]]'' editor [[Lenoir Chambers]] editorialized against massive resistance and earned the [[Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Writing]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lenoir Chambers&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.landmarkcom.com/about/history.php| title = Landmark Communications Company History| accessdate = 2007-10-11| publisher = Landmark Communications}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:NorfolkWaterside2010.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Waterside]]
After desegregation, and with new [[suburb]]an developments beckoning, many white middle-class residents [[White flight|moved out of the city]] along new highway routes, and Norfolk's population fell. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, the advent of newer suburban shopping destinations along with freeways spelled demise for the fortunes of downtown's [[Granby Street]] commercial corridor, located just a few blocks inland from the waterfront. The opening of malls and large shopping centers drew off retail business from Granby Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;JANAF History&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.janafshopping.com/aboutjanaf.php| title = History of JANAF Shopping Center| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = JANAF Shopping Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norfolk's city leaders began a long push to [[Urban renewal|revive its urban core]]. While Granby Street underwent decline, Norfolk city leaders focused on the waterfront and its collection of decaying piers and warehouses. Many obsolete shipping and warehousing facilities were demolished. In their place, planners created a new boulevard, Waterside Drive, along which many of the high-rise buildings in Norfolk's [[skyline]] were erected.

The City and [[The Rouse Company]] developed the [[Waterside (Norfolk, Virginia)|Waterside]] festival marketplace in 1983 to attract people to the waterfront and catalyze further downtown redevelopment.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterside&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.watersidemarketplace.com/| title = Waterside Marketplace| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = Waterside}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other facilities opened in the ensuing years, including the [[Harbor Park]] baseball stadium, home of the [[Norfolk Tides]] Triple-A [[minor league baseball]] team.  In 1995, the Park was named the finest facility in minor league baseball by ''[[Baseball America]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Harbor Park&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolktides.com/ballpark/| title = Harbor Park| accessdate = 2007-10-10| publisher = Harbor Park}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norfolk's efforts to revitalize its downtown have attracted acclaim from economic development and urban planning circles throughout the country. Downtown's rising fortunes helped to expand the city's revenues and allowed the city to direct attention to other neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=&quot;About Norfolk&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.norfolk.gov/About/| title = About Norfolk| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = City of Norfolk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norfolk is located in the upper right quadrant, and east is at the top.]]
According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|96.3|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|53.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|42.6|sqmi|km2}} of it (44.22%) is water. Norfolk is located at {{Coord|37|54|36|N|76|12|25|W|city}} (36.885747Â° N, 76.2599Â° W)

The city is located at the southeastern corner of [[Virginia]] at the junction of the Elizabeth River and [[Chesapeake Bay]]. The Hampton Roads [[United States metropolitan area|Metropolitan Statistical Area]] (officially known as the [[Virginia Beach-Norfolk-Newport News, VA-NC MSA]]) is the [[Table of United States Metropolitan Statistical Areas|34th largest]] in the United States, with a total population of 1,576,370. The area includes the Virginia cities of Norfolk, [[Virginia Beach, Virginia|Virginia Beach]], [[Chesapeake, Virginia|Chesapeake]], [[Hampton, Virginia|Hampton]], [[Newport News, Virginia|Newport News]], [[Poquoson, Virginia|Poquoson]], [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]], [[Suffolk, Virginia|Suffolk]], [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]], and the counties of [[Gloucester County, Virginia|Gloucester]], [[Isle of Wight County, Virginia|Isle of Wight]], [[James City County, Virginia|James City]], [[Mathews County, Virginia|Mathews]], [[Surry County, Virginia|Surry]], and [[York County, Virginia|York]], as well as the [[North Carolina]] county of [[Currituck County, North Carolina|Currituck]]. The city of Norfolk is recognized as the central business district, while the Virginia Beach oceanside resort district and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] are primarily centers of tourism. Virginia Beach is the most populated city within the MSA though it functions more as a suburb.

In addition to extensive riverfront property, Norfolk has miles of bayfront resort property and beaches in the [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]] communities.

===Climate===
Norfolk has a [[humid subtropical climate]] with moderate changes of seasons. Spring arrives in March with mild days and cool nights, and by late May, the temperature has warmed up considerably to herald warm summer days. Summer temperatures can be unpleasantly hot, often topping 90 Â°F (32 Â°C) with high humidity. On average, July is the warmest month of the year, with the maximum average precipitation. Hurricanes and tropical storms usually brush Norfolk and only occasionally  make landfalls in the area. [[Autumn|Fall]] is marked by mild to warm days and cooler nights.

When Norfolk was first settled, homes were made of wood and [[Framing (construction)|frame]] construction, similar to most medieval English-style homes. These homes had wide [[chimney]]s and [[Thatching|thatch roofs]]. Some decades after the town was first laid out in 1682, the [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[architectural style]], which was popular in the [[Southern United States|South]] at the time, was used. [[Brick]] was considered more substantial construction; patterns were made by brick laid and Flemish bond. This style evolved to include projecting center pavilions, [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] windows, [[Baluster|balustraded]] roof decks, and two-story [[portico]]es.  By 1740, homes, warehouses, stores, workshops, and taverns began to dot Norfolk's streets.

Norfolk was burned down during the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]]. After the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Norfolk was rebuilt in [[Federal architecture|Federal]] style, based on Roman ideals. Federal-style homes kept Georgian symmetry, though they had more refined decorations to look like [[New World]] homes. Federal homes had features such as narrow sidelights with an embracing [[fanlight]] around the doorway, giant porticoes, gable or flat roofs, and projecting bays on exterior walls. Rooms were oval, elliptical or octagonal. Few of these federal [[rowhouse]]s remain standing today. A majority of buildings were made of wood and had simple construction.

In the early 19th century, [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] architectural elements began to appear in the federal style row homes, such as iconic [[Classical order|columns]] in the porticoes and classic motifs over doorways and windows. Many Federal-style row houses were modernized by placing a Greek-style porch at the front. Greek and Roman elements were integrated into public buildings such as the old City Hall, the old Norfolk Academy, and the Customs House.[[File:Whittle House Norfolk.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Taylor-Whittle House (ca. 1790), now occupied by the Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach and the Norfolk Historical Society&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jlnvb.org/?nd=house Junior League of Norfolk-Virginia Beach]&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Greek-style homes gave way to [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]] in the 1830s, which emphasized [[Ogive#Architecture|pointed arches]], steep [[gable]] roofs, towers and tracer-lead windows. The Freemason Baptist Church and St. Mary's Catholic Church are examples of Gothic Revival. [[Italianate architecture|Italianate]] elements emerged in the 1840s including [[cupola]]s, [[veranda]]s, ornamental [[brickwork]], or [[Quoin (architecture)|corner quoins]]. Norfolk still had simple wooden structures among its more ornate buildings.

[[High-rise]] buildings were first built in the late 19th century when structures such as the current Commodore Maury Hotel and the Royster Building were constructed to form the initial Norfolk skyline. Past styles were revived during the early years of the 20th century. Bungalows and apartment buildings became popular for those living in the city.

As the [[Great Depression]] wore on, [[Art Deco]] emerged as a popular building style, as evidenced by the Post Office building downtown. [[Art Deco]] consisted of streamlined [[concrete]] faced appearance with smooth [[rock (geology)|stone]] or metal, with [[terracotta]], and trimming consisting of [[glass]] and colored [[tile]]s.

===Neighborhoods===
{{See also|List of neighborhoods in Norfolk}}
Norfolk has a variety of historic neighborhoods.  Some neighborhoods, such as [[Berkley, Virginia|Berkley]], were formerly cities and towns.  Others, such as [[Willoughby Spit]] and [[Ocean View, Virginia|Ocean View]], have a long history tied to the [[Chesapeake Bay]].  Today neighborhoods such as [[Downtown Norfolk, Virginia|Downtown]] and [[Ghent district|Ghent]] have transformed with the revitalization that the city has undergone.

As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2010, there were 242,803 people, 86,210 households, and 51,898 families residing in the city. The [[population density]] was 4,362.8 people per square mile (1,684.4/kmÂ²). There were 94,416 housing units at an average density of 1,757.3 per square mile (678.5/kmÂ²).

==Economy==
{{Main|Economy of Norfolk, Virginia}}

Since Norfolk serves as the commercial and cultural center for the unusual geographical region of Hampton Roads (and in its political structure of independent cities), it can be difficult to separate the economic characteristics of Norfolk from that of the region as a whole.

The waterways which almost completely surround the Hampton Roads region play an important part in the local economy. As a strategic location at the mouth of the [[Chesapeake Bay]], its protected [[List of deep-water ports|deep-water channels]] serve as a major trade artery for the [[import]] and [[export]] of goods from across the [[Mid-Atlantic States|Mid-Atlantic]], [[Midwestern United States|Mid-West]], and internationally.&lt;ref name=&quot;Global Security&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| title = Norfolk Naval Base
| accessdate = 2008-02-21
| publisher = Globalsecurity.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to commercial activities, Hampton Roads is a major military center, particularly for the [[United States Navy]], and Norfolk serves as the home for the most important of these regional installations, [[Naval Station Norfolk]], the world's largest naval station. Located on [[Sewell's Point|Sewell's Point Peninsula]], in the northwest corner of the city, the installation is the current headquarters of the [[United States Fleet Forces Command]] (formerly known as the Atlantic Fleet), as well as being home port for the [[United States Second Fleet|Second Fleet]], which compromises approximately 62,000 active duty personnel, 75 ships, and 132 aircrafts. The base also serves as the headquarters to the [[Allied Command Transformation]] ([[NATO]]) and the [[United States Joint Forces Command]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO Official Information&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.globalSecurity.org| title = NATO official information via GlobalSecurity.org| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region also plays an important role in defense contracting, with particular emphasis in the shipbuilding and ship repair businesses for the city of Norfolk. Major private shipyards located in Norfolk or the [[Hampton Roads]] area include: [[Huntington Ingalls Industries]] (formerly Northrop Grumman Newport News) in Newport News, [[BAE Systems Ship Repair|BAE Systems Norfolk Ship Repair]], Metro Machine Corporation, and Colonna's Shipyard Inc., while the US Navy's [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]] is just across the [[Downtown Tunnel]] in [[Portsmouth, Virginia|Portsmouth]]. Most contracts fulfilled by these shipyards are issued by the Navy, though some private commercial repair also takes place. Over 35% of Gross Regional Product (which includes the entire Norfolk-Newport News-Virginia Beach MSA), is attributable to defense spending, and that 75% of all regional growth since 2001 is attributable to increases in defense spending.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hampton Roads Statistics&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://bpa.odu.edu/forecasting/sor/sor2004.shtml| title = State of the Region 2004| accessdate = 2008-02-21| publisher = Old Dominion University}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Norfolk, VA.jpg|right|thumb|A view of Norfolk from Portsmouth]]
After the military, the second largest and most important industry for Hampton Roads and Norfolk based on economic impact are the region's cargo ports. Headquartered in Norfolk, the [[Virginia Port Authority]] (VPA) is a [[Virginia|Commonwealth of Virginia]] owned-entity that, in turn, owns and operates three major port facilities in Hampton Roads for break-bulk and container type cargo. In Norfolk, [[Virginia Port Authority#Norfolk International Terminals|Norfolk International Terminals]] (NIT) represents one of those three facilities and is home to the world's largest and fastest container cranes.&lt;ref name=&quot;NIT Facilities&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.vaports.com/Facilities/FAC-term-nit.htm| title = Norfolk International Terminals| accessdate = 2007-08-06| publisher = Virginia Port Authority |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070803150402/http://www.vaports.com/Facilities/FAC-term-nit.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together, the three terminals of the VPA handled a total of over 2 million [[containerization|TEUs]] and 475,000 tons of breakbulk cargo in 2006, making it the second busiest port on the east coast of North America by total cargo volume after the Port of New York and New Jersey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hampton Roads Ports&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://hreda.com/publicImages/downloadFiles/The%20Port%20of%20Hampton%20Roads.pdf|format=PDF| title = The Port of Hampton Roads| accessdate = 2007-08-06| publisher = Hampton Roads Economic Development Authority}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to NIT, Norfolk is home to Lambert's Point Docks, the largest coal trans-shipment point in the Northern Hemisphere, with annual throughput of approximately 48 million tons.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lamberts Point&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/facility/lamberts-point.htm| title = Lamberts Point| accessdate = 2007-08-06| publisher = Globalsecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bituminous coal]] is primarily sourced from the Appalachian mountains in western Virginia, [[West Virginia]], and [[Kentucky]]. The coal is loaded onto trains and sent to the port where it is unloaded onto large breakbulk cargo ships and destined for New England, Europe, and Asia.

Between 1925 and 2007, [[Ford Motor Company]] operated [[Norfolk Assembly]], a manufacturing plant located on the [[Elizabeth River (Virginia)|Elizabeth River]] that had produced the Model T, sedans and station wagons before building F-150 pick-up trucks.&lt;ref name=&quot;vp1&quot;&gt;{{cite web| title = Despite Fordâs troubles, Norfolk plant is likely to keep on truckin'| publisher = Jeremiah McWilliams, The Virginian-Pilot November 11, 2005 | url = http://content.hamptonroads.com/story.cfm?story=95163&amp;ran=106860}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Before it closed, the plant employed more than 2,600 people at the {{convert|2800000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility.&lt;ref name=&quot;vp1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vp1&quot;/&gt;

Most major shipping lines have a permanent presence in the region with some combination of sales, distribution, and/or logistical offices, many of which are located in Norfolk. In addition, many of the largest international shipping companies have chosen Norfolk as their North American headquarters. These companies are either located at the Norfolk World Trade Center building or have constructed buildings in the Lake Wright Executive Center [[office park]].

Though [[Virginia Beach]] and [[Williamsburg, Virginia|Williamsburg]] have traditionally been the centers of tourism for the region, the rebirth of downtown Norfolk and the construction of a cruise ship pier at the foot of [[Nauticus]] in downtown has driven tourism to become an increasingly important part of the city's economy. The number of cruise ship passengers who visited Norfolk increased from 50,000 in 2003, to 107,000 in 2004 and 2005. Also in April 2007, the city completed construction on a $36 million state-of-the-art cruise ship terminal alongside the pier.&lt;ref name=&quot;Half Moone Terminal&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Richards|first=Gregory|title=Sleek new cruise terminal set to welcome travelers|url=http://hamptonroads.com/node/247981|accessdate=29 September 2010|newspaper=Virginian Pilot|date=7 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly due to this construction, passenger counts dropped to 70,000 in 2006, but is expected to rebound to 90,000 in 2007, and higher in later years. Unlike most cruise ship terminals which are located in industrial areas, the downtown location of Norfolk's terminal has received favorable reviews from both tourists and the cruise lines who enjoy its proximity to the city's hotels, restaurants, shopping, and cultural amenities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cruise Norfolk&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.cruisenorfolk.org/| title = Cruise Norfolk| accessdate = 2007-08-09| publisher = Norfolk Cruise Terminal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
