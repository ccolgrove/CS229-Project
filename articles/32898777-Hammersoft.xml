'''Waterloo''' is a [[Charleroi Metro]] station, located at the northern end of [[Charleroi]] downtown, in fare zone 1.

The station has 3 street entrances (two on each side of the ''Jules HÃ©nin Avenue'', one on the ''Jules HiÃ©rnaux Square''), leading to the lowest level. Platforms are located on the upper level and are accessible through escalators and stairs.

The station has one lateral platform which is currently not used (and not connected to any tram tracks). Trams of lines 54, 55 and 88 all use the central platform. Waterloo is also the starting point of the built but unused ''Centenaire'' line.

Trams of line 55 enter and exit the station in the same direction, requiring a U-turn which is executed using a loop track located north of the station. Starting from the middle of the loop is a short track section running to the North and surfacing north of the ''Jules HiÃ©rnaux Square'', which would have been the starting point of pre-metro lines to [[Lodelinsart]] and [[Gosselies]] on one side, and [[Ransart]] and [[Heppignies]] on the other side.

On the initial project plan for the Charleroi Pre-metro, the Waterloo station was called ''Nord'' (French for North).
