[[Image:Salt-and-Vinegar.JPG|thumb|A pack of Walkers &quot;Salt and Vinegar&quot; crisps]]
'''Walkers''' is a British [[snack food]] manufacturer operating mainly in the United Kingdom and [[Republic of Ireland]] and to a lesser extent on the European continent. They are best known for manufacturing [[potato chips|crisps]]. They hold 47 per cent of the British crisp market.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.packaging-gateway.com/projects/walkerscrisps/&lt;/ref&gt; The Walkers site in Leicester is one of the largest crisp production plants in the world, producing over 11 million bags of crisps per day and using about 800t of potatoes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.packaging-gateway.com/projects/walkerscrisps/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In the 1880s Henry Walker moved from [[Mansfield]] to [[Leicester]] to take over an established [[butcher]]'s shop in the high street. Meat [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing after World War II]] saw the factory output drop dramatically and the company looked at alternatives to make use of the wasted capacity. With potato crisps being increasingly popular with the public, managing director R.E. Gerrard helped the company shift focus and began hand-slicing and frying potatoes.

==Present day==
Walkers is now owned by [[Frito-Lay]], which in turn is a subsidiary of [[PepsiCo]], with the current logo a derivative of the North American [[Lay's]] logo. The company is still a significant presence in Leicester.  [[Gary Lineker]], formerly a Leicester City footballer, is now the face of the company, starring in most of their [[advertising]] campaigns. The official website states that an estimated &quot;11 million people will eat a Walkers product every day&quot;. The company employs over 4,000 people in fifteen locations.

In 2000, Walkers' 1995 advertisement starring [[Gary Lineker]] was named the ninth best television commercial of all time, in a poll conducted by ''[[The Sunday Times (UK)|The Sunday Times]]'' and [[Channel 4]].

In February 2006 Walkers changed their brand label and [[typeset]]. They also announced they were to reduce the [[saturated fat]] in their crisps by 70%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walkers-eathappy.co.uk/less_fat.html Walkers Crisps - Better for you | less saturated fat]&lt;/ref&gt; They started frying their crisps in SunSeed oil, a variety of sunflower oil, claiming the oil's higher monounsaturated fat content made it healthier than the sunflower oil which they used previously.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlWalkers crisps&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.walkers-crisps.co.uk/sunseed_oil.html |title=All about SUNSEED oil |work= |accessdate=August 11, 2009|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071009192048/http://www.walkers-crisps.co.uk/sunseed_oil.html|archivedate=October 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They once again changed their packaging style in June 2007, rather similar to the logo used from 1998â2006.

Many of Walkers brands were formerly branded under the [[Smiths Crisps]] name. This comes from the time when Walkers, Smiths and [[Tudor Crisps]] were the three main brands of [[Nabisco|Nabisco's]] UK snack division with Tudor being marketed mainly in the north of England and Walkers in the south. After the takeover by Pepsico the Tudor name was dropped and the Smiths brand has gradually been phased out in favour of Walkers. The only products currently retaining the Smiths brand are Salt &amp; Vinegar and Ready Salted [[Chipsticks]], [[Frazzles]] and the &quot;Savoury Selection&quot;, which includes Bacon Flavour Fries, Scampi Flavour Fries and [[Cheese Flavoured Moments]].

[[Image:do-us-a-flavour.JPG|thumb|The six finalists of the &quot;Do Us A Flavour&quot; campaign]]

In 1997, Walkers became the brand name of the [[Quavers]] and [[Monster Munch]] snacks. In August 2000 Walkers launched Max, a brand with a range of crisps. More Max flavours were introduced in 2001. In the same year Walkers bought [[Squares (snack)|Squares]], a range of [[snacks]] from [[Smiths]].

In 2002 Walkers bought [[Wotsits]] from [[Golden Wonder]]. In May 2002 Walkers launched Sensations, a range of crisps in the UK. Walkers introduced the Quavers flavours Salt &amp; Vinegar and Prawn Cocktail in July 2002.

In 2003 Walkers bought [[Salt &amp; Shake]], [[Scampi Fries]] and [[Bacon Fries]] from [[Smiths]]. In 2005 Walkers launched [[Wotsits Twisted]], a range of [[cheese puffs]] in the UK. Nutrition information has appeared on the front of Walkers crisps packets since 2006.

In 2007 Walkers launched Sunbites, a range of crisps made using wholegrains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunbites.co.uk Sunbites website]&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008 Walkers launched its &quot;Do Us A Flavour&quot; campaign, challenging members of the public to think up a unique flavour of crisp. In January 2009 six flavours were picked and released as special editions, available until May 2009. During this period, consumers could vote on their favourite and the winner would become a permanent flavour.&lt;ref name=metro&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.metro.co.uk/weird/article.html?Squirrel-flavoured_crisps_go_on_sale_in_UK&amp;in_article_id=468192&amp;in_page_id=2 | title=Squirrel-flavoured crisps go on sale in UK | publisher=Metro.co.uk | date=2008-01-09 | accessdate=2009-01-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The winner of the competition was Builder's Breakfast by Emma Rushin from [[Belper]] in [[Derbyshire]]. This flavour was itself discontinued a year later in May of 2010 in order for Walkers to focus on the upcoming 'Flavour Cup'(see below)

In summer 2009 Walkers launched its premium [[Red Sky snacks|Red Sky]] brand of &quot;all natural&quot; potato crisps and snacks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkingretail.com/products/product-news/red-sky-potato-chips-from-walkers Red Sky Potato Chips from Walkers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010 the company launched a promotional campaign entitled the 'Walkers Flavour Cup' to find the world's favourite flavour.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.walkers.co.uk/flavourcup/faqs.html#/help/faqs&lt;/ref&gt; The flavour with the most fans at the end of the tournament would be declared the winner. Walkers encouraged people to engage in the social media activity and upload Photos &amp; Videos to their website proving people's Superfan status of Walkers Crisps. The best fan from each of the 15 flavours won Â£10,000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.brandown.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=164:walkers-flavour-cup&amp;catid=49:supermarket&amp;Itemid=23&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, English Roast Beef &amp; Yorkshire Pudding won the flavour cup.

For the 2011 [[Comic Relief]] four celebrities; [[Jimmy Carr]], [[Stephen Fry]], [[Al Murray]] and [[Frank Skinner]] each represented four new flavours and the three whose crisps sell the least amount would be [[Waxing|waxed]] by [[Denise Van Outen]] on the 18 March 2011 on Red Nose Day (see below).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.dailystar.co.uk/news/view/175100/Comedians-battle-for-Denise-Van-Outen/ |title=Comedians battle for Denise van Outen |last=Dunkerley |first=Jennifer |date=4 February 2011 |publisher=''[[Daily Star (United Kingdom)|Daily Star]]'' |accessdate=5 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
