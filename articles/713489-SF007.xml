'''Ad-Aware''' is an anti-spyware and anti-[[Computer virus|virus]] program developed by [[Lavasoft]] that detects and removes malware, [[spyware]] and [[adware]] on a user's computer. According to Lavasoft, Ad-Aware detects spyware, computer viruses, [[dialer]]s, [[Trojan horse (computing)|Trojans]], bots, [[rootkit]]s, [[data-mining|data miners]], aggressive advertising, parasites, [[browser hijacker]]s, and tracking components.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lavasoft.com/support/supportcenter/manuals/ad_aware/ad_aware_manual.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Ad-Aware was originally developed in 1999 to highlight [[web beacons]] inside of Internet Explorer.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} On many websites, users would see a tiny pixelated square next to each web beacon, warning the user that the computer's IP address and other non-essential information was being tracked by this website. Over time, Ad-Aware added the ability to block those beacons, or ads. Ad-Aware no longer makes the user aware of the ads on the screen, instead the program fights spyware, adware, viruses and other malware.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

In the 2008 Edition, Lavasoft bundled Ad-Aware Pro and Plus for the first time with an [[antivirus]] scanner,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hopkins |first=John A |url=http://download.cnet.com/Ad-Aware-2008/3000-8022_4-10844457.html |title=Ad-Aware 2008 7.1.0.8 - Free software downloads and software reviews - CNET Download.com |publisher=Download.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses the [[Avira]] engine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/computing/smb-security/reviews/26025.aspx?p=3 |title=Page 3 - Ad-Aware Pro Anniversary Edition Review: Computer Security Articles at |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=2010-05-04 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
and this practice continued in the subsequent releases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brighthub.com/computing/smb-security/reviews/52810.aspx |title=Ad-Aware v8.1, Powered by People Anti-Malware Protection |publisher=Brighthub.com |date=2010-07-19 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
{{as of | 2011}}, Lavasoft makes Ad-Aware version 9.6 available in three core versions:&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

# Ad-Aware Free Internet Security
# Ad-Aware Pro Internet Security
# Ad-Aware Total Security

Lavasoft also offers an Ad-Aware version for [[business]]es, named Ad-Aware Business Edition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lavasoft.com/products/ad_aware_business_edition.php |title=Ad-Aware Business Edition - Enterprise security software for endpoint protection against virus and malware |publisher=Lavasoft |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is designed for use over networks. It has a central server console interface with licences for installing Ad-Aware Pro Internet Security on the networked machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavasoft.com/mylavasoft/support/faqs/what-is-adaware-business-edition |title=What is Ad-Aware Business Edition? |publisher=Lavasoft |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lavasoft also makes available an Ad-Aware spin-off product aimed at online gamers and entertainment fans, called Ad-Aware Game Edition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lavasoft.com/company/press/archive/20091103.php |title=Ad-Aware Caters to Gamers and Entertainment Fans with New Security Solution |publisher=Lavasoft |date=2009-11-03 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each version includes anti-spyware and anti-rootkit protection, as well as integrated protection against real-time threats. As of July 7th the Ad-Aware Free Internet Security version also include antivirus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=by WillfromSF on November 1, 2010 |url=http://download.cnet.com/Ad-Aware-Free-Internet-Security/3000-8022_4-10045910.html?tag=contentMain;contentAux |title=Ad-Aware Free Internet Security - Free software downloads and software reviews - CNET Download.com |publisher=Download.cnet.com |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Lavasoft, Ad-Aware allows computer users to combat malicious spyware, viruses, and malware; it protects users from malware that takes control of a computer and can result in aggressive advertising [[Pop-up ad|pop-ups]], in sluggish computer activity and in the stealing of private information.  The vendors says that Ad-Aware detects hazardous content on a user's computer, identifies the threat level, and then gives the user the ability to block or remove unwanted content.

According to [[PC World (magazine)|PC World magazine]], an older version of Ad-Aware, the Anniversary Edition, could locate only 83.6% of malware in a comparative test carried out by the security firm av-test.org.&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcworld.com/downloads/file/fid,71309-order,2-c,antispywaretools/description.html|title=Editorial Review of Ad-Aware Pro|date=2009-10-13|accessdate=2009-10-31|publisher=[[PC World (magazine)]]}}
&lt;/ref&gt; However, as the article states, no such tests have been run on the newest version. Neil J. Rubenking at [[Pcmag|PCMag]] has performed a lab test on the latest version, 8.3, where Ad-Aware scored 9.2 points, beating the previous top score of 9.1.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2366085,00.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

Ad-Aware installs [[Google Chrome]], which will be done automatically unless the user de-selects the tick-box in the Ad-Aware installation program.

==Market share==
Ad-Aware Anniversary Edition, which has now been replaced with Ad-Aware 8.1, is listed as having been downloaded over 339 million times {{as of|2009|11|lc=on}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://download.cnet.com/Ad-Aware-Anniversary-Edition/3000-8022_4-10045910.html|title = Ad-Aware AE |date = undated |author = CNet |accessdate = 2009-11-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, since its primary competition is not downloadable from the same location, a comparison of relative market-share is not possible with these figures.   

The paid versions of the product are under threat from more functional and lower cost, even free, competition such as [[Microsoft Security Essentials]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pcworld&quot;/&gt;
