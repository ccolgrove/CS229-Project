'''New Norway''' is a small rural village located in the central [[prairie]]s of [[Alberta]], [[Canada]]. Named in 1895 and properly established in 1909, it is located on [[Alberta Highway 21|Hwy 21]], approximately 100 kilometres (60&amp;nbsp;mi) SSE of [[Edmonton, Alberta|Edmonton]] and 22 kilometres (14&amp;nbsp;mi) SW of [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], the closest major trading center.

With a population of over 300, New Norway is home to a number of small businesses, and provides its inhabitants with an elementary and secondary school, local fire protection, and municipal services.

==Early history==
In 1892, travelling first on the newly constructed [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] (CPR) line, the Ole M. Olstad family disembarked in [[Wetaskiwin, Alberta|Wetaskiwin]] and made their way to the [[Duhamel, Alberta|Duhamel]] settlement, which had been established for some years. The family quickly filed [[Homesteading|homestead]]s a few miles south for themselves and several relatives and friends in the United States. In addition they purchased available CPR land for $3.00&amp;nbsp;per&amp;nbsp;[[acre]] ($7.41/[[hectare|ha]]).

For a time the area was known as the &quot;Olstead District&quot;. However, as other [[Norway|Norwegian]] families (along with those of other nationalities) settled in the area, the name changed to '''New Norway''' around 1895. By 1903 the fledgling community had a school, general store, and a [[blacksmith]] shop to its credit.

In the fall of 1909, in anticipation of the new [[Grand Trunk Pacific]] rail line being built nearby, the town was moved (by the use of skids and seven [[oxen]]) to its present location NW-11-45-21-W4 (see [[Dominion Land Survey]]). According to the ''[[Camrose Canadian]]'', the townsite of New Norway was put on sale October 14, 1909, with 14 businesses filing intent to establish within the first month. Commercial lots sold from $100 to $250, and residential lots were priced from $50 to $150.

The first village council was elected on May 9, 1910 with Norman M. Smith, James F. Willows and Evan O. Olstad serving.

==Demographics==
In 2006, New Norway had a population of 323 living in 121 [[house|dwellings]], a 10.6% increase from 2001. The village has a land area of {{convert|1.12|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} and a [[population density]] of {{convert|289.7|/km2|/sqmi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=statcan2006&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=4810008&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=48&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=New%20Norway&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=&amp;GeoCode=4810008 | title= New Norway - Community Profile | author= Statistics Canada| authorlink= Statistics Canada| year= [[Canada 2006 Census|Census 2006]] | accessdate= 2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
