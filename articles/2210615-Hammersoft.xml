== Student life ==

GardnerâWebb University is home to many school-wide events.  At the beginning of the school year, returning students come back a week early and act as big brothers and big sisters for the upcoming freshmen.  During orientation week, students gather in their orientation groups and complete activities together.  Later, these orientation groups become the freshmen student's University 111 class, a class intended to introduce students to the University and how it works.

Homecoming is a time of celebration at GWU. Central to Homecoming Weekend is the parade down Main Street in Boiling Springs. The weekend is full of special meals for alumni and students.  One of the most popular traditions at Gardner-Webb is centered around the Friday night before the big Homecoming game. Students virtually &quot;destroy&quot; campus with rolls of toilet paper.  The activity that is now condoned by administration is a major part of Gardner-Webb tradition. Although some students believe that it is a waste of time and toilet paper, most enjoy and partake in this tried-and-true Homecoming event.  Others question the logic of toilet papering one's own campus.

Other popular activities include the spring formal, occasional movies on the quad (the grassy area in the center of campus), Earth Day activities, ski trips, Midterm Munchies, Beep Ball Baseball, Open-Mic Night at the coffee shop, participation in discount nights at Chick-fil-a, IHOP, Pizza Hut and Octoberfest (an event where the community and college students come together as an alternative for trick-or-treating).

=== Housing ===
The majority of full-time students at Gardner-Webb live in either the traditional residence halls or on-campus apartments. Costs for living on campus vary, depending on what a student choses: residence hall living, single-room residence hall living, suite living, or apartment living. Single accommodations for residence halls and group apartment living are subject to request of the Gardner-Webb Housing and Residence Education department based on room availability.

'''Decker''' is a female-only residence hall. This building's construction was completed in 1949 and originally was slated to be for men.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Residence Halls: Decker Hall.&quot; Gardner-Webb University. Web. 9 Feb 2010. [http://gardner-webb.edu/student-life/services/residence-education/Residence-Halls/decker/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Dover Memorial Library is across the small Decker parking lot in addition to the Suttle Wellness Center. Decker is rumored to be haunted by the ghost of a girl who committed suicide in 1955 and was the subject of the 2006 film, ''The Legacy: A Ghost Story'', which  won the Gold Award at the 2006 Aurora Film and Video Festival.

Decker Hall is a multilevel building, containing a ground floor, first, second and third &quot;loft-style&quot; floor. Located on the central &quot;Quad&quot; area, Decker Hall has single, double, and triple rooms. All floors in this building are equipped with community-style bathrooms.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Residence Halls: Decker Hall.&quot; Gardner-Webb University. Web. 9 Feb 2010.

'''H.A.P.Y.''', an acronym for the building's founders, '''H'''oey, '''A'''nthony, '''P'''adgett, and '''Y'''oung, was built in 1946. H.A.P.Y is located in the central location of campus. H.A.P.Y is the only residence hall that is coed. However, Males and females are opposite wings Divided by the lobby. The main building sports suite-style bathrooms (where four students share one bathroom), while the wing has one community bathroom.  H.A.P.Y. is a recently renovated building with nice carpet and furniture.

'''Honors House''' is a newer addition to the residence halls on Gardner-Webb's Campus.  The old white home served as overflow housing at one time but now houses students in single and double rooms with private and suite-style bathrooms.  It is farther from the campus and is the only coed residence hall. The house is split in two parts by sex.  The two sides are connected by a main lobby, kitchen, and laundry room.  Honors House was originally set up as a residence hall for honors students.

'''Royster''', formally a hospital in Boiling Springs, is a men's residence hall located across College Avenue and off the main campus.  The building is one story with a main hall and several wings.  Young men enjoy community style and private baths along with large rooms and high ceilings. As a former hospital, Royster has the singular distinction of being the only residence hall with an unused morgue in its basement.

'''Stroup''' (pronounced &quot;strap&quot;) is another residence hall for the female students. The building has community baths and in each room there are sinks. The building is in line for some well-needed renovations.

'''Mauney Hall''' is one of the largest places for on-campus students to live. Mauney has four floors with two-person rooms and a communal bathroom shared by the floor. Mauney residents may use the three washing and drying machines and snack and drink machines. The students who occupy Mauney Hall enjoy community style living that involves meeting your hall mates and learning the campus together. Flag Football at Garnder-Webb University offers a time for residence hall competitions which largely involve Mauney and Lutz-Yelton Halls. Mauney is one of the most-sought places to live on campus, third to the University Apartments and to Lutz-Yelton.

'''Myers-Spangler''' halls are mostly female residence halls with the exception of the first floor of Myers, which houses some of the overflow males. At the beginning of the 2009-2010 school year, Myers and Spangler will return to being all-female residence halls.  They are located further off the main quad area connected by an outdoor corridor.  The buildings have community style baths. Myers and Spangler were newly renovated this summer{{When|date=February 2011}} before the incoming freshman arrived.

'''Nanney''' is a two-story women's residence hall. (Over the last few years it has housed young men but was converted back to a women's residence hall in August 2008.)  The building has carpet and long rooms with built-in closets.  Bathtubs can still be found in the residence hall's bathrooms.

Focus is another club supported by campus ministries.  Students are placed with two leaders, usually placed on a team of ten or twelve.  Each team meets weekly and prays about their week or struggles they might be having and reads scripture.

Games, food, praise and worship music, skits, and scripture passages and teachings are crucial to Focus.  Focus builds friendships among team members.

Alpha Chi is a special invitation academic organization that promotes and recognizes scholarship and elements of character which make scholarship effective.  Another popular club is The Dawg Pound â the students involved go to sporting events, sit in the student section, sport red and black club T-shirts and painted faces to support their Runnin' Bulldogs. It was founded in 2001 by Lutz-Yelton residents Matt Hudler and Nic Watson.

Gardner-Webb provides the students involved in SNA the opportunity to be involved at the national level.

All clubs are chartered by the GardnerâWebb University Student Government Association (SGA). The purpose of the SGA is to represent the rights and opinions of the undergraduate student body in a manner consistent with its mission and constitution.  SGA also works to promote positive relationships among the students, the faculty, and the administration.

=== The Verge ===
The Verge is a contemporary worship service, held in Dover Theatre, on every Tuesday night. It is one of the most popular extracurricular activities on Gardner-Webb's campus.

The Gardner-Webb Bulldog cheer-leading team has been around for many years. As of today,{{When|date=June 2011}} the cheerleading team has a coach by the name of Andrew Day. He has been coaching for a little over a few years at Gardner-Webb but is also an alumnus and alumni cheerleader of GardnerâWebb University. When Coach Drew first cheered here, chairs were the stunts to do. Now, toss ball up cupie, and heel stretch full down and many more have become standard. The history of the cheerleading program has changed so much in the past 11 years. It went from not being competitive at all, to being one of the forefront teams in college cheerleading. The past 11 years they have been competing with NCA. They started in Division II and now have changed to Small Co-ed (4 guys or less). That means they compete against any Division I, II, or III teams. Our school officially became a Division IAA in 2002. In their first appearance in the Small Coed Division they placed 5th in the Nation and 1st in the Southeast. The team is fortunate to have a lot of returns to place hopefully even higher this year.{{When|date=June 2011}} The talent here has continued to get stronger and stronger. We{{Who|date=June 2011}} are building a tradition of having great cheerleading.

Gardner-Webb sports requires dedication from not only the athletes and coaches, but also a committed strength staff. The athletics facilities for weight lifting and strength training are used on a daily basis to maximize athletes performance and to prevent injuries. The Gardner-Webb strength staff currently trains approximately 400 student-athletes. Teams are required to attend mandatory lifts and speed training while participating in a sport. The weight-training facilities are located in the GWU Football Center next to Spangler Stadium ([http://www.gardner-webb.edu/admissions/campusmap/index.html Campus map]). &quot;In order to keep the athlete from adapting to the same training stimulus, causing a plateau effect, the program is changed every 4-6 weeks&quot; ([http://www.gwusports.com/ViewArticle.dbml?DB_OEM_ID=10300&amp;ATCLID=1148123 Bulldog Strength]). The importance of strength training to [prevent injuries]is also a major part for a strength training staff. This includes instructing athletes on how to properly perform correct lifting techniques, prevention methods: such as stretching, warming up correctly and altering programs for athletes who are recovering from an injury to ensure proper rehabilitation and a speedy recovery.&lt;ref&gt;Sibley, Tracy. Personal Interview. 15 Apr. 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Basketball scandal ===
The Gardner-Webb community was rocked by scandal in the fall of 2002 when ordained minister and Gardner-Webb president of 16 years, Dr. Christopher White', admitted to writing a memo two years before ordering a star basketball player's grade-point average to be calculated without the &quot;F&quot; he received for cheating in his religion class; thereby allowing the athlete to play.  Without the change, Carlos Webb would have been ineligible in 2000â01, the season Gardner-Webb won the National Christian College Athletic Association championship. Carlos Webb was also named most valuable player that day. Two years later Gardner-Webb became NCAA Division I school. Under the university's honor code, a &quot;cheating F&quot; can never be removed from a student's transcript because it is a direct violation of the Gardner-Webb honor code. By removing the &quot;F&quot;, some{{Who|date=June 2011}} believed president White destroyed the power of the honor code and the integrity of GardnerâWebb University.

After eight days of students protesting, the school's trustees affirmed Christopher White's presidency after a 10-hour meeting on September 27, 2002 though they demoted a pair of administrators, one the vice president of academic affairs and the other his assistant, who had criticized White's actions.  Initially three faculty members also resigned as a result of the scandal.  In the end, eight faculty members and administrators (later called &quot;The Group of 8&quot;) suffered professional hardship due to demotion, resignation, or firing. The group of eight which led the faculty revolt against White included Blackburn, Williams, and Price.

Opponents said White's action and the trustees' failure to punish him violates the spirit of Gardner-Webb's honor code, while the president's backers, including the chairman of the board of trustees, said they were convinced White did not violate the letter of any school rules and that he acted in a spirit of fairness toward Carlos Webb, who had been incorrectly advised he could get the &quot;F&quot; removed from his GPA by retaking the class.  Trustees chairman Thomas Hardin said his board concluded that, while White's action was wrong, the president should not have been removed for a mistake made two years before. He said the demoted administrators were punished not for speaking out, but because in doing so they violated a student's right to privacy.

White states in ''The New York Times'' about why he made the decision to change Carlos Webb's grade. White said &quot;In trying to make a decision, there are two guiding principles: One is the university's word. When we tell a student this is what he needs to do, we need to stand by that. The Second thing is, I'm very concerned with student rights. They are our customers. They are our clients. We don't exist for ourselves. We exist for them. They deserve to be treated fairly.&quot; Webb was incorrectly advised that if he took the course again and passed it, his F would be replaced.

For nearly two weeks students picketed on the corner of College Avenue and Main Street with signs calling for the president's resignation and questioning his integrity.  Students were seen with copies of the Honor Code in their black frames taken from classrooms and the glass front busted and black tape over the poster.  The scandal tore the Gardner-Webb community apart.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In early October 2002, Dr. Christopher White resigned as GardnerâWebb Universityâs president and the grade remained on the student athleteâs transcript.  Gardner-Webb was put on NCAA probation for a five-year period that ended in early 2007.

== University Police ==
GardnerâWebb University has a police force on campus at all times. University Police makes hourly rounds of the campus. Parking is mandated by the University Police in addition to an array of other services provided to GardnerâWebb University. Services include assisting with common car problems such as flat tires, dead batteries, and car-entry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardner-webb.edu/student-life/services/up/index.html &quot;University Police.&quot; Gardner-Webb University. Web. 9 Feb. 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bulldog Escort program is also provided by University Police. The service is available from dusk to dawn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardner-webb.edu/student-life/services/up/escort/index.html &quot;Bull Dog Escort Program.&quot; Gardner-Webb University. Web. 9 Feb 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; Should a student feel uncomfortable walking across campus, for any reason, the student can utilize this program to have a police officer from University Police escort them back to their dorm or car.

== Renovations and expansion ==
Every summer Gardner-Webb strives to make the campus and its facilities better for its students. Recent renovations include carpet and furniture in Lutz-Yelton and Mauney halls, suite style bathrooms in H.A.P.Y., and improvements to apartment complexes.

One major renovation occurred over the 2006-2007 Christmas break in which Gardner-Webb completely renovated the cafeteria, called &quot;The Caf&quot;, by students. The room is now home to a food court type serving area, numerous plasma screen televisions around the lower level seating area, and private TVs for each table in the upper level seating area.  During the summer of 2007 Gardner-Webb renovated the snack bar area in the downstairs of the Dover Campus Center. The new area looks like a sports bar and coffee shop restaurant. It is a place where students can use their meal plan or cash to purchase prepared foods and snack foods.  The new area was given the name &quot;The Kennel&quot; in reference to the Bulldog mascot.  The Kennel has television sets like the ones that are found in the &quot;Caf.&quot; In the summer of 2010 the &quot;Kennel&quot; was closed and renovations began to turn it into a Chick-fila express. Finally in the fall of 2010 the restaurant opened and now serves some Chick-fila items such as the classic chicken sandwich.

The fall of 2007 will boast the revealing of Gardner-Webbâs biggest capital campaign and expansion plan in history. The new plan is three phases and includes the building of a new Student Center (that will include a movie theater, food court, recreation area, prayer room, ballroom, and offices for major student clubs and organizations), a new science and math facility, and a new fine and performing arts building. The capital campaign will need to raise an initial $16 million for the first phase that will include the building of the new Student Center.

In the spring of 2010, GardnerâWebb University was honored with its largest financial gift to date. The University was awarded $5 million by the Tucker Family to assist in funding the construction of the Tucker Student Center. The new student center is slated to be built on Garnder-Webb's main campus, on the Lake Hollifield complex. In the fall of 2010, the University will officially break ground for this new facility.
