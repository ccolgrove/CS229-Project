'''Jenna''' is Balto's mate and mother of Aleu, Kodi, Dingo, Saba, Nunivat and Yukon. She was voiced by [[Bridget Fonda]] in the first movie, and [[Jodi Benson]] in the two sequels.

====Physical Appearance====
Jenna has dark red fur, which most of her puppies received, and usually wears an orange bandanna around her neck. She also has very pale, almost white fur on her underbelly, legs, face, chest and tail. Jenna's character design was based on movie actress, [[Audrey Hepburn]].

====Personality====
Jenna has loved Balto since they met. When Balto, along with Muk, Luk and Boris left to save ''[[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]'', she, followed their scent. She saved Balto from a wild bear, and just before she and all of Balto's companion's left (due to Jenna's injured paw), Jenna gave Balto her bandanna.  When Balto returned with medicine, they officially became mates.

Jenna usually stays behind on Balto's adventures, despite asking to help. Jenna also cared a lot for her puppies, but was willing to find them homes after six months. Jenna also disliked Steele for his remarks about Balto, and his arrogant attitude, and always stuck up for Balto whenever she was there, even scolding Steele and calling him a &quot;glory-hound.&quot; Though she never said anything about the flirtatious remarks that Steele tried on her,  she always turned him down. &quot;I don't know Steele, suddenly I lost my appetite&quot; [After Steele asked her out]

Jenna is very kind and gentle, and is very protective not only of her pups, but also of her owner, Rosy. When Rosy's hat fell out of her hand and into the path of Steele and his team, as Rosy tried to reach for it, Jenna grabbed her coat from behind; Balto later got the hat. She is kindhearted but also rather intelligent, as she was the only one in Nome that Steele was unable to fool.

Unbeknownst to Rosy, Jenna is also very cunning (tricking Steele into burning his tail by using his infatuation of her against him), and even has fight instincts in her; she helped fight off a wild bear that was menacing Balto and the others, although her right paw ended up hurt.

====Biography====
Jenna was sold to Rosie when she was only 6 months old.&lt;ref&gt;Jenna mentioned this in ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Jenna first met Balto, to our knowledge, when he saved her master's hat (there is some doubt of this, as they already knew one another by name), with this, she had befriended Balto, and after he saved Rosy, she decided to spend the rest of her life with him and in the second movie she gave birth to a litter of pups.

When Aleu ran away Jenna attempted to follow Balto but he insisted that she stay behind, and that it was a father/daughter thing. When Balto was chosen to help Kodi save his job a few years later, she encouraged Balto to help. Balto was worried that he would let the team down, and that he was not a hero, Jenna reassured him that if he could save a whole town, then he could help save Kodi's job. After Balto left to save Duke by himself, Jenna scolded Kodi for letting Balto go by himself and convinced Kodi to follow him.

===Boris===
{{Infobox character

| name = Boris
| nickname = &quot;Uncle Boris&quot;, &quot;Mr. Optimisim&quot;
| image =  
| caption = Boris Goosinov.
| species = Goose
| gender = Male
| family = Balto (adoptive son), Stella (girlfriend)
| portrayer =[[Bob Hoskins]]&lt;br /&gt;[[Charles Fleischer]]}}

'''Boris Goosinov''' (called '''Uncle Boris''' by Muk, Luk, Aleu, and sometimes Balto) is a Russian snow goose who raised Balto from a pup. He speaks with a heavy Russian accent (but in the close captions for Balto II: Wolf Quest, it says that Boris has a Yiddish accent). He is voiced by [[Bob Hoskins]] in the first film, and [[Charles Fleischer]] in the direct-to-video movies. (Hoskins and Fleischer respectively portrayed Eddie Valiant and the voice of Roger Rabbit in ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit?]]''.) In the 1st film, Boris mentions his last name is &quot;Goosinov&quot; (&quot;Heal, boy! Boris Goosinov is no spring chicken!&quot;).

====Physical Appearance====
Boris has the appearance of the average snow goose. White feathers with black tipped wings and headdress. Boris is afraid of heights.

====Personality====
Boris in the first film, had great faith in Balto when he left to save Nome, telling him: &quot;A dog cannot make the journey alone, but maybe a wolf can&quot;. Boris also was afraid of the local bully Steele. In the 2nd film, Boris told Balto that even though he didn't want to believe it, Aleu would be half-wolf. Boris was also revealed to be superstitious and believed in mystical stuff. In the 3rd film he developed a crush on a goose named Stella, but lied about flying with her to hide his fear of heights.

====Biography====
Boris was born in Russia. It is unknown how he ended up in Nome since he has a fear of heights. Sometime in Boris' life he discovered a young Balto and raised him as his adoptive son. When Balto left to save Nome several years later, Boris waited for Balto's return. Boris became the pups' babysitter in the 2nd film. When Balto left to find Aleu, Boris once again waited for Balto's return with Jenna.

Two years later, he fell in love with a migrating snow goose named Stella. After Stella became mad with him, she chased him onto a plane which then crashed. Balto, Stella, Muk, and Luk eventually found Boris in the wreck-site and carried him back to Nome. Boris then made up with Stella and confessed to her his fear of heights. Later they became a couple.

===Muk &amp; Luk===
{{Infobox character
| colour = Blue
| colour text = white
| first = Balto (film)
| name = Muk and Luk
| image =  
| caption = Muk and Luk
| species = Polar bear
| gender = Male
| family = Each other (brothers)
| portrayer = [[Phil Collins]] &lt;br /&gt; [[Kevin Schon]]
| ages= unknown}}

'''Muk and Luk''', two polar bears who usually like to play pranks on Boris. They are presumably brothers. Most about Muk and Luk's origin is unknown. Muk and Luk live in the forests of Alaska. They are often seen visiting Boris and Balto.

====Physical Appearance====
Muk and Luk resemble the Polar Bears indigenous to the Arctic Circle. Muk has a solid black nose while Luk's is red, and both have thick white fur coats. Muk is the smaller of the two while Luk maintains a large physical, yet glutton size.

====Personality====
Both Muk and Luk show very peculiar personalities and traits for their own species. Both are fun loving and care free. Seemingly the only thing they take serious in their lives is the well being of their friends in family. Particularly their &quot;Uncle&quot; Boris and Balto. Muk has shown to be the more intelligent of the two, but Luk also contributes mumbling words of wisdom on the given occasion. Unlike the average Polar Bears, Muk and Luk show no solid traits that usually pertain to the largest bears in America (possibly because they are still young). They always seem to find the best in every situation, no matter how grim it might be.

====Biography====
Very little is told about the past lives of Muk and Luk before the events in ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''. During the film both are known to the goose Boris and Balto. They seem to have been separated from their family at a young age, and were taken in by a probably reluctant Boris. They now refer to him as their Uncle and only remaining family. During the events of ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'', they continue to share a strong familial bond with Boris, as well as Balto's family. They remain behind in Balto's quest to find his daughter.

Later on during ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]'', they continue to reside in the wilderness around Nome. They also aid Balto in his quest to rescue the stranded pilot Duke from the Alaskan Wilderness, telling him the exact location of his downed bush plane. After aiding Balto in a confrontation with two wild Bull Moose, they return to a life of little cares and pestering of their Uncle and closest friends.

===Aleu===
{{Infobox character
| colour = Blue
| colour text = white
| first = Balto II: Wolf Quest
| name = Aleu
| image =  
| caption = Aleu.
| species =Wolf/Canine
| gender = Female
| family = Kodi (brother), Dingo (brother), Saba (sister), several unknown brothers and sisters, Boris (uncle), Balto (father), Jenna (mother), Aniu (deceased grandmother), (unknown grandfather), unknown maternal grandparents
| portrayer = [[Lacey Chabert]]
}}

'''Aleu''', is a [[wolf-dog hybrid]] and the daughter of Balto and Jenna. Aleu appeared in ''Wolf Quest'' (where she is the real protagonist) and made a second appearance as a puppy during Balto's flashback in the song &quot;You Don't Have To Be A Hero&quot; during ''Wings of Change''. Her name might come from the ''[[Aleutian Islands]]'', off the coast of Alaska.

====Appearance====
Aleu has [[sandy]]-grey fur, with a lighter underbelly. While mostly looking like her father she shares some similarities to her mother.

====Personality====
She is very stubborn and brave, prone to not listening to her father. She was also disdainful of her wolf [[blood]] (though she eventually learns to accept it). Although she never realized it, Aleu acted more like a wolf than a dog; she had a [[reputation]] for being aggressive and had a high [[prey drive]] and stronger predatory instincts than a common dog. It is unknown how she developed her prey drive, as neither Balto nor Jenna possessed a prey drive.

Despite a very emotional blow at the hands of her father, the two reconcile at the end of her journey, and she remains very closely tied to Balto despite leaving him perhaps forever. In most peoples hopes of Universal Studios is that they will make another movie about her returning home. She also has a friendship tied to Muk and Luk as well as her mother and family. She has a good vocabulary and enjoys correcting folks grammar when ever she has the chance.

====Biography====
Aleu was born to Balto and Jenna within the same litter as her brother Kodiak. She is believed to be the youngest in the litter, but might actually be the oldest. She bore great resemblance to a wolf more so than her siblings, and also acted more like a wolf unlike her more canine siblings. As a result, she was never adopted. Aleu spent a year with Balto and Jenna, one day believing that a human would adopt her for who she was.and she has a brother named Tinko as well.

After a nearly costly encounter with a local Inuit Hunter, Balto was forced to reveal to his daughter that she bore the physical appearances and characteristics of a wolf. Even more so then Balto himself. This caused Aleu a great deal of distress and emotional turmoil. She chose to run far from Nome, her father naturally giving chase alone despite Jenna's wishes. Aleu would eventually come into contact with a wolf pack led by Nava, which also included the extremely vicious wolf Niju.

Balto did manage to catch his daughter, but she refused to return to the life offered with her family at Nome. Through a series of spiritual events, Balto, Nava, and eventually Aleu herself come to realize with the aid of her spirit guide Maru, that she is destined to lead the pack towards a better future. At the end of the events in ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'', she bids her father a very emotional farewell, informing him to deliver her best love to Jenna. She then disappears with a confident howl across the ''[[Bering Sea]]''. Her future and whereabouts are now unknown. It is unknown if she already has a mate (alpha male) in her clan. She has a strange supernatural power that allows her to have visions of the past or future, as well as read minds. This is shown by her eyes lighting up a bright yellow.

===Kodi===
{{Infobox character

| name = Kodiak (Kodi)

| caption = Kodiak (Kodi).
| species = Wolf/Canine
| gender = Male
| family = Aleu (sister), Dingo (brother), Saba (sister), several unknown brothers and sisters, Boris (uncle), Balto (father), Jenna (mother), Aniu (deceased grandmother), unknown grandfather , unknown maternal grandparents
| portrayer = [[Sean Astin]]
}}

'''Kodiak (Kodi)''' is the son of Balto, and plays a major part in ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change]]'', where he has a job as a local mail-dog. Kodi also had a cameo in ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'' as one of the puppies that is adopted. His name may be in reference to the ''[[Kodiak Islands]]'', off the coast of Alaska. Unlike Aleu, he and all of the other pups have no knowledge of their wolf ancestry.

====Appearance====
Unlike his sister, Kodi mainly takes after his mother. His fur is rusty red with a sandy underbelly. He has a white stripe that goes from between his eyes to the tip of his nose.

====Personality====
Kodi has appeared to display a similar personality to Balto. Kodi has a strong sense of duty and responsibility, but also has his faults (such as allowing Balto to attempt a rescue mission into the Alaskan frontier alone for the sake of keeping his job). He remains fiercely loyal to his friends. Going to such heights such as forsaking his family's wishes to keep them content. He is also laid-back and cool-headed.

He has a strong drive and passion for sled racing and wishes to push himself to the limits due to events in his childhood, where he was physically the weakest of the entire litter (obviously the runt of the litter). Shares a strong bond with his father due again to his childhood experiences and is extremely proud to be his son.

====Biography====
Kodiak was born to Balto and Jenna within the same litter as his sister's Aleu and Saba. It is unknown where he resides in the order of age but many fans consider him to be the youngest of the group although he is the oldest due to his larger size and mature voice.He is as younger than ralph and kirby but is still older than dusty. As a pup, Kodi was always ready to engage in activities with his brothers and sisters, but found himself unable to keep up with running activities. Although this left Kodi dismayed, never believing himself capable, this allowed him to build a closer relationship with his father Balto, who would run with his son constantly until the day he would finally outrun him.

Sometime between the events of ''Wolf Quest'' and ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]'', or even before, Kodi attained a very high interest in the local mail team, specifically in becoming lead dog. Most likely due to his father's past with sled dog racing. Sometime during that period he attained a position on the mail team and displayed superb skills with his job.

During the events of ''Wings of Change'', Kodi displayed a wide variety of traits that showed how easily swayed he was by his friends. Such as valuing their position on the team and overall welfare over that of a human being's life. This trait colliding roughly with both his parents. Later on his true personality revealed itself when he chose to pursue and aid his father in rescuing the pilot Duke, over the initial wishes of his comrades. Kodi's future remains unknown, but it can be said that he continues with his mail duties and remains close to his parents in Nome.

==Other Characters &amp; Allies==
===Nikki, Kaltag, &amp; Star===
{{Infobox character

| name = Nikki, Kaltag, and Star
| image =  
| caption = Nikki (middle), Kaltag (right), and Star (left).
| species = Canine
| gender = Male
| portrayer = [[Jack Angel]] ''(Nikki)''&lt;br /&gt;[[Danny Mann]] ''(Kaltag)''&lt;br /&gt;[[Robbie Rist]] ''(Star)'' }}

Nikki, Kaltag, and Star aided Balto in the run for the serum. Nikki is the oldest of the three being in his late 30s, Kaltag is in his mid 30s, and Star is in his early 30s (he's older than kirby). The three were made very famous by their constant rags about Steele and other characters behind their backs (mainly between Nikki and Kaltag). Star joins in with a very random and straight to the point reply, resulting in a hit to the head by Kaltag, though once he saw it was coming and hit himself instead. Later on during the events of the relay, Balto would gain the trust and admiration of all three when he successfully leads them across the dangerous Alaskan wilderness and also by retrieving the medicine from the bottom of a deep ravine.

Star would make the infamous ''&quot;They should build a statue of him!&quot;'' comment at the conclusion of the film, which Kaltag agreed with instead of smacking him on the head. It is unknown what has become of the trio after the events in ''Balto'', for there is no mention or appearance of them in either ''Wolf Quest'' or ''Wings of Change'' (although there are brief appearances of Nikki and Kaltag in &quot;Wings of Change&quot;: during the E.D.A.S where Kaltag barks from a window and Nikki barks from the far right corner of the street next to JOHN'S BAR). Kaltag is still golden, but Star is brown in the preview of the movie.

They were voiced respectively by [[Jack Angel]] (Nikki), [[Danny Mann]] (Kaltag), and [[Robbie Rist]] (Star).

===Nava===
{{Infobox character

| first = Balto II: Wolf Quest
| name = Nava
| image =
| caption =
| species = Wolf
| gender = Male
| family = Unknown(although Refers other pack members as&quot;brothers&quot;)
| portrayer = [[David Carradine]]
}}

Nava is an elderly wolf who was the wise leader of the wolf pack encountered by Balto and Aleu in ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]''.

====Physical Appearance====
Being very old among his pack (Around 9â11 years possibly), Nava's fur was a very dull Grey with his underbelly being pure white. Nava was also fairly larger than some of the others of his pack. He does not appear to bear any permanent markings.

====Personality====
Nava was firm with his beliefs in the spiritual ways and laws of the pack, his more peaceful views coming into conflict with those of the younger and more militant wolf known as Niju. Nava also was shown to willingly hear everyone's opinion on something, including Niju's. He was instrumental in showing Aleu what she truly wanted in life, and discovered that it was she, not Balto, who was meant to lead the pack onwards.

====Biography====
Nava first appeared as the shaman and Leader of a Wolf Pack. He tells his pack as well as Balto and Aleu that one day soon, they will be led by a new leader, &quot;the one who is wolf but does not know.&quot;During the climax of the film, Nava was attacked by Niju and shoved into the ice cold waters beneath the ice. Although rescued by Balto and Aleu, he chose to remain behind on the Alaskan mainland with Balto; giving control of the pack's future and well being to Aleu.

After discussing the future with Balto, Nava informed him that he would find the also stranded Niju. Stating that they were still a pack and that they needed each other. The two bid a fond farewell, Nava disappearing into the wilderness. His current whereabouts are unknown. He has a supernatural power that allows him to fuse with the elements.

He was voiced by the late [[David Carradine]].

===Stella===
A female snow goose that Boris has a crush on in ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]''. Stella was migrating when she met Boris. Boris instantly fell in love with her, but he was unwilling to reveal to her his fear of heights. She later heard him talking to Balto about how he lied to her. Enraged, she forced Boris into [[List of Balto characters#Duke|Duke]]'s plane. Duke's plane, later, crashed with Boris in it. Stella, along Balto and Muk and Luk, set out to find Boris. Stella later confronted Boris about why he lied to her, and he admitted his fear of heights and they reconcile with a moonlight swim.

She was voiced by the popular actress [[Jean Smart]].

===Dusty, Kirby, &amp; Ralph===
{{Infobox character
| colour = Blue
| colour text = white
| first = Balto III: Wings of Change
| name = Dusty, Kirby, &amp; Ralph
| image = 
| caption = 
| species = Canine
| gender = Two Males, One Female
| family = Kodi (friend)
| portrayer =[[Charity James]] ''(Dusty)''&lt;br /&gt;[[Carl Weathers]] ''(Kirby)''&lt;br /&gt;[[Bill Fagerbakke]] ''(Ralph)'' }}

Three huskies who reside in the Alaskan town of Nome and serve as the traditional threesome that was evident in the two previous installments. All three dogs play a backup role in the third film ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change]]'' as friends and fellow mail team members to Balto and Jenna's son Kodiak. Kirby appears to be the oldest of the group being in his early 30s (he's younger than Star), Ralph being late 20s, and Dusty the youngest being in her early 20s. All three are highly committed and proud of their jobs, a trait that plays a heavy impact upon Kodi throughout the course of the film.

Kirby is the cocky member of the trio and the lead dog on the sled team. He also insists that, as the lead dog, they need to defeat Duke and his bush plane in the race, but is easily passed up in favor of Balto. Ralph is the husky and more laid back of the trio, usually serving as the blunt of pranks yet voice of quiet reason and complaints (like Fagerbakke's other character from ''[[SpongeBob SquarePants]]'', Patrick Star). Dusty is the only female in this group. She is apparently very close to Kodi. This has led some fans to suggest that Dusty might potentially become a love interest for Kodi.

All three dogs eventually supported Kodi's decision to help the human Duke, despite the fact he threatened to take their jobs away. They proceeded to aid Kodi and Balto in Duke's rescue. It is unknown what has become of them after ''Wings of Change'', but it can be assumed they all continue to run alongside Kodi on the mail team.

They are voiced respectively by [[Charity James]], [[Carl Weathers]], and [[Bill Fagerbakke]].

===Duke===
Duke was pilot who appeared in ''Balto III: Wings of Change''. Although friendly and very kind towards Balto and his friends, he pushed for a race between himself and the local mail team; as to determine which could carry the mail quicker. Although Duke had the advantage at the midway point of the race, a build up of ice on his plane's wings caused him to crash land deep in the Alaskan wilderness. Unknown to him, Boris had mistakenly boarded the plan after a run-in with Stella. He was injured in the crash, but was discovered by Balto who proceeded to return him to Nome. Without aid, Balto carried Duke as far as he was able, and nearly fell prey to the deep bowels of an ice canyon had it not been for the sudden arrival of his son Kodi and his fellow mail team dogs Dusty, Kirby, and Ralph.

Once returned to Nome, Duke decided to build another plane, and in honor of the canine who saved his life, he named it the ''&quot;Balto Flyer&quot;''. His final gift to Balto was the thrill of a flight high above the Alaskan landscape, something Balto truly wanted to experience.

He was voiced by veteran actor [[Keith Carradine]].

===Rosy===
Rosy is an elderly lady and the previous owner of Jenna. In 1925, during a dog-sled race, Rosy's hat blew away into the racing track. Balto would retrieve the hat and return it to her; managing to show off in the process. Later, Rosy caught [[Diphtheria]], along with the rest of the children in the town of Nome. Rosy was cured after Balto arrived with the medicine. She was possibly the only human being in the town to have accepted Balto; the rest, including Rosy's own parents, hated and feared him, and just after Balto returned the hat, Rosy's father pulled her away from him and told her that he was part wolf.

70 years later, Rosy was a grandmother and told her granddaughter about the story of Balto. She was voiced by Juliette Brewer as child, and played by [[Miriam Margolyes]] as an adult. Rosy was mentioned several times during ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'', but was an off-screen character. Rosy had a cameo during the opening credits in ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]''.

====Rosy's parents====
Although Rosy liked Balto, her parents feared him. When Balto returned Rosy's hat, her father pulled her away from Balto and told her that Balto is part wolf and therefore unpredictable. However, at the end of the first movie, the whole town rejoices when Balto returns with the medicine, and the townspeople, including Rosy's parents, now see who he really is and lets him see Rosy after receiving her treatment.

It can be said that they continue to allow the previously untrustworthy Balto into their lives and home; seeing as how he fathered a litter of puppies with the family's prized husky Jenna.

Her father was voiced by William Roberts (III) and her mother was voiced by Sandra Dickinson.

===Aniu===
{{main|Aniu}}

Balto's apparently deceased mother. Balto was separated from Aniu at an early age and never saw her again. Aniu made an appearance in ''[[Balto II : Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'', where she revealed herself as the black raven who had been guiding Balto the entire time in spirit and Balto when Balto fell off a cliff, trying to save the antitoxin. A topic of hot debate among Balto fans is that of the white wolf's appearance in the first Balto film; where she appeared to help him accept who he truly was. It is as of yet unknown if this wolf was meant to also be Balto's mother or simply a representative of the dormant heritage Balto continues to ignore up until that point of the film. Though it is finally revealed in Wolf Quest that she is indeed Balto's mother, himself calling her the latter.
She makes no appearance in ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]''.

She was voiced by [[Monnae Michaell]].

===Muru===
Muru is Aleu's spirit guide and the son of Kahu and Quillaq. He has the appearance of a mouse in the ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'', and performs the song, &quot;Who Are You&quot;. At the end of ''Wolf Quest'', he is seen sitting next to Aleu, and howling alongside her, forever ready to guide her in future endeavors.

He was voiced by actor [[Peter MacNicol]].

===Dixie &amp; Sylvie===
Dixie and Sylvie are a pair of female dog gossipers in ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''. Dixie is a [[Pomeranian]] and Sylvie is an [[Afghan Hound]]. Both appear to be good friends of Jenna and both also having a crush on Steele. They and the other dogs soon  discovered Steele's true nature and turned their backs on him. In Wings of Change, Sylvie makes a cameo in the ally way with several other dogs.
Dixie and Sylvie are both voiced by [[Sandra Dickinson]].

===Mel &amp; Dipsy===
Mel and Dipsy are 2 dogs who replaced Dixie and Slyvie in ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]''. Mel is a paranoid [[Airdale Terrier]] while Dipsy is an obese and carefree [[Basset Hound]]. Much like the original gossipers, both appear to be friends with Jenna. Mel and Dipsy are voiced by [[David Paymer]] and [[Kathy Najimy]].

===Doc===
Doc is an old [[Saint Bernard (dog)|Saint Bernard]] who appears in the first film. He first appears while telling the other dogs of Nome that Steele and his team had missed their second checkpoint and had become lost. Later when the other dogs learned that Steele that lied to them about Balto and the team being frozen to death in the storm, he turned his back on him. Doc later appears in the third film during the E.D.A.S. He is voiced by [[Donald Sinden]].

===Terrier===
The Terrier is a [[Scottish Terrier]] who appears in ''Balto: Wolf Quest'' who tells Balto that Jenna gave birth to some puppies. The Terrier is hyper-active and barks continuously which Boris gets annoyed by. He later appears during the E.D.A.S scene in Wings of Change. He is voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]].

| family = Unknown
| portrayer = [[Jim Cummings]]

}}

'''Steele''' is a handsome male [[Siberian Husky]] who served as the primary antagonist in ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]''. He was voiced by [[Jim Cummings]].

====Physical Traits &amp; Appearance====
Despite remarks by his musher and others that Steele might be &quot;losing his edge&quot; (after losing to Balto at the beginning of the film), Steele still has remarkable strength and speed close to that of Balto's. He was able to survive a fall down a cliffside, knocked down a dead tree, burned by a furnace (thanks to Jenna), and smashed through a closed door while pinning both Balto and Jenna. Steele is an image of physical perfectness among the local dogs. He is covered in jet black fur with a pure white underbelly and face. It is hinted that he is also a pure-bred, pedigree [[Siberian Husky]].

====Personality====

Steele is arrogant, egotistical, cruel, ruthless and selfish, representing all of which Balto despises. His hatred for Balto is made out of pure jealousy (as Balto beat him to the finish line). He also likes Jenna, but she sees through his lies and loves Balto instead, which further strengthens Steele's hatred and jealousy towards Balto. He is also a crafty liar, claiming that Balto and the rest of the team had died, and at the end of the film the undoing of his lies causes him to be shunned and hated by those who used to respect him.

====Biography====
Steele was the lead dog on the best dog racing team in Nome, he first encountered Balto (in the movie Steele's behavior towards Balto is an obvious indication that they have met on prior occasions) after being defeated by the latter in a race while rescuing Rosy's hat. Out of jealousy, Steele insulted and harassed Balto for being half-wolf. When the town became sick, there was a relay race to choose who would be on the sled dog team that would relay the medicine. Despite being deliberately kicked off the course by a competitor, Balto was the rightful winner of the race (by taking a special &amp; longer route to catch up), but right after the race ended, Steele gets into another confrontation with Balto, after which Jenna scolds Steele for being a glory-hound. Shortly after that, Steele stomped on Balto's paw as a musher reached to pet him, forcing Balto to growl in pain and bare his teeth, making the humans believe that the wolf-dog to be aggressive and dangerous, especially with his teeth. This causes Balto to be disqualified from the race despite being the victor.

Steele became the leader of the sled team to return the medicine to ''[[Nome, Alaska|Nome]]'', managing to lead the team successfully to ''[[Nenana, Alaska|Nenana]]'' and halfway back to Nome before becoming mentally disoriented during a blizzard. Balto discovered the mentally deranged Steele and his team at the edge of a large ravine. Despite Balto's pleas for Steele to let him help them back to Nome (knowing that the children would die if the medicine does not get there in time), Steele attacks Balto, making obvious his intentions to kill him. Balto refused to fight back, but still managed to trick Steele into tumbling off the nearby cliff in his unstable mindset when Steele grabbed for the orange bandana around Balto's neck that Jenna gave to Balto. Having demonstrated his good nature and noble intention to bring the serum back to Nome at all costs, Balto gains the unconditional support of the other dogs on the team. They pick up the trail and head back without Steele.

Despite his state, Steele managed to follow Balto's trail back to Nome, along the way marking all of the trees to disorient him. On his return to Nome he claimed that Balto and the rest of the team had frozen to death and that Balto had fallen off of a cliff, and also stating that Balto made Steele promise to take care of Jenna. Jenna realizes that Balto would have never told Steele such a thing and tells all the other dogs who believe Steele's story that he's lying. Steele's strategy initially managed to catch Balto off his guard, resulting in him becoming disoriented and lost as well. Despite this, Balto manages to believe in who he truly is, catches on to Steele's trick, and follows the trail he himself had marked (using only his smell) back to Nome. Balto's return results in him being accepted as a beloved hero and the undoing of Steele's lies cause the other dogs of Nome to consider Steele as an outcast, leaving him behind alone in the boiler room at the climax of the movie. This is a complete reversal of their roles in the beginning of the movie where Steele was the town's most popular dog and Balto was the hated outcast.

It is unknown what became of Steele after the events in ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]'', for he is never seen or mentioned in the sequels ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest|Wolf Quest]]'' or ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change|Wings of Change]]''. However Phil Weinstein explained that in the original script for Wings of Change, Steele would be one of the volunteers who would help Balto on his search for Duke.

'''Niju''' was a young and vicious wolf who served as the antagonist in ''[[Balto II: Wolf Quest]]''.

====Physical Traits &amp; Appearance====
Niju was impressively built, being the second largest (Nuk being larger due to his massive appetite) and almost certainly being the strongest member of the wolf pack which allowed him to intimidate and defeat other wolves, easily tackling and overpowering Aleu and throwing off Nava. His fur was darkish brown with a greyish blue underbelly. His only markings were dark patches around his eyes. In the film, his whiskers were purposely made more noticeable.

====Personality====
Unlike the elderly leader Nava, Niju was a very militant and arrogant wolf, fully willing to break the rules of the land and steal for what he desired, though seemingly doing so because of the desire to live. He was also shown to suffer from a fear of change (cainotophobia) which probably caused his cruel actions as Nava claimed that Niju would willingly starve or die than leave his homeland. Though he acts as the antagonist of the film, he is not considered evil by fans since Niju was influenced by fear rather than greed, which Steele was driven by in the first film. Many fans also think that Niju may have suffered a traumatic life which led to his fear.

====Biography====
Niju planned to take over the wolf pack with the aid of his followers, Nuk, Yak, and Sumac. Eventually the wolf pack started to turn towards Niju and started to follow him, but when the ice bridge that led to the caribou formed, the entire pack including Nuk, Yak, and Sumac turned back to Nava, Balto, Aleu. Niju also attempted to kill the pack leader Nava as well as Aleu, but his plans were foiled by Balto. When Niju was given the opportunity to lead the pack, his &quot;fear Of change&quot; got the better of him and he fled into the forest. Nava claimed to Balto after they were off the ice that he would go and find Niju and that &quot;one would not be whole without the other.&quot;

Niju was voiced by veteran voice actor [[Mark Hamill]].

===Nuk, Yak, &amp; Sumac===
Nuk, Yak, and Sumac were three wolves who served as the replacement for the original trio and Niju's followers in &quot;[[Balto II: Wolf Quest]]&quot;.

Nuk, who while is the largest, is also the least intelligent member, personally claiming he'd rather just eat than use his brain. Yak seems to be the most intelligent, but seems to have an increasing difficulty with fleas. Sumac appears to be the smallest and most skittish individual, as well as laughing frequently.
Nuk, Yak, and Sumac refused to continue forth with Niju's evil plan when they finally realized the truth of the situation around them. The three aided Aleu in her return to the ice flow, resulting in her takeover of the pack's future. They disappeared across the ocean with Aleu and the rest of the wolves.

Nuk, Yak, and Sumac were voiced by [[Joe Alaskey]], [[Jeff Bennett (voice actor)|Jeff Bennett]], and [[Rob Paulsen]] respectively.

===Grizzly Bear===
A giant black Grizzly Bear appears in the original film ''[[Balto (film)|Balto]]'' during the wolf-dog's journey to find the missing relay anti-toxin team. The bear appeared to be stalking the group consisting of Balto, Boris, and Muk and Luk for several moments before Balto finally caught scent of the danger. A fierce confrontation erupted between the crazed giant and Balto.

Although small and more agile, the wolf-dog was unable to avoid the behemoth; becoming trapped and nearly crushed beneath its paw. Had it not been for the swift arrival of Jenna, Balto would have easily been killed. Still relentless, the Grizzly injured Jenna and managed to engage Balto once more. Having learned a strategy, Balto lured the heavy creature onto the frozen ice; managing to dispose of the giant in the icy depths of the lake at nearly the cost of his own life.

===Bull Moose===
During the events of ''[[Balto III: Wings of Change]]'', Balto, along with Muk and Luk, descend deep into the territory of the very dangerous and crazed  Moose. Despite warnings from Muk and Luk, Balto insisted that they press on in order to rescue the downed bush pilot Duke, as well as Boris. The group encounters one very unintelligent, yet formidable Bull Moose, and only upon the arrival of yet another territorial Moose do they manage to escape from the obsessed duo. The bull moose served as the replacement for the original crazed grizzly bear that appeared in the previous two films.

Both Moose take on a very Italian like personality in heavy reference to the mob genre (&quot;You talkin' to me?&quot;). They are both voiced by experienced voice actor [[Maurice LaMarche]].
