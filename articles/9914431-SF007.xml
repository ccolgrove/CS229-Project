== Background ==
Linux gaming refers to all game titles that can run on Linux based operating systems. This can refer to [[free software|free]] / [[open source]] games, which may also be commercial,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.avaneya.com/faq.html#commercial Avaneya FAQ] [[Free &amp; Commercial]], September 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; that run natively on Linux, or proprietary games that have Linux ports. Linux gaming can also refer to Linux based gaming devices such as the [[Pandora (console)|Pandora]] gaming console, or gaming oriented distributions such as [[SuperGamer]]. Linux gaming can also be considered to be related to [[Android (operating system)#Mobile gaming|gaming]] on the [[Android (operating system)|Android]] platform, although there are distinct differences between the two systems and industries. In recent years Linux gaming has also become more closely related to gaming on other alternative platforms, such as [[Mac gaming#Linux gaming and free software games|Mac gaming]].

As far as development is concerned, library support for Linux gaming is provided by [[OpenGL]],  [[Advanced Linux Sound Architecture|ALSA]], [[OpenAL]] and [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], a cross-platform multimedia wrapper around system-dependent libraries, as well as [[Pygame]].  The [[Direct Rendering Infrastructure|DRI]] project provides [[Graphics hardware and FOSS|open source video card drivers]], and [[NVIDIA]] and [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] also release binary kernel modules for their video cards. Linux also runs on several game consoles, including the [[Xbox]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xbox-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page |title=Xbox Linux Wiki |publisher=Xbox-linux.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PS2 Linux|PlayStation 2]], [[PS3|PlayStation 3]], [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gc-linux.org/wiki/Main_Page |title=Gamecube Linux Wiki |publisher=Gc-linux.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Wii]] which allows game developers without an expensive game development kit to access console hardware. Several gaming peripherals also work with Linux, such as gaming mice from [[Roccat]] which have official Linux drivers and even a [[free software]] user-space utility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=ODY1Mw A Gaming Mouse Vendor That Has Linux Drivers] [[Phoronix]], October 05, 2010 (Article by [[Michael Larabel]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTg3NA Roccat Linux Support Keeps Coming] [[Phoronix]], September 05, 2011 (Article by Michael Larabel)&lt;/ref&gt; Several game development tools also run on Linux, including [[Game Editor]] and [[GtkRadiant]].

== History ==
{{See also|Open source video game#History}}
[[File:Doom ingame 2.png|thumb|250px|right|''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' was one of the first major commercial games to be released for Linux.]]
Linux gaming started largely as an extension of the already present [[Unix]] gaming scene, with both systems sharing many similar titles. These games were either mostly original or clones of arcade games and text adventures. A notable example of this is [[Berkley Software Distribution|BSD]] Games, a collection of [[interactive fiction]] titles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4169 Ghost of Fun Time's Past] - [[Linux Journal]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[free software]] and [[open source]] methodologies which spawned the development of the operating system in general also spawned the creation of various early free games. Popular early titles included ''[[NetHack]], [[Netrek]], [[XBill]], [[XEvil]], [[xbattle]], [[Xconq]]'' and ''[[XPilot]]''. As the operating system itself grew and expanded, the amount of free and open source games also increased in scale and complexity.

The beginning of commercial gaming on Linux is often credited to have begun in 1994 when [[Dave D. Taylor]] ported the game ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' in his spare time to Linux as well as many other systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/1 | title = DOOM | publisher = Linux Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3180 Getting Started with Quake] [[Linux Journal]], January 1, 1999  (Article by Bob Zimbinski)&lt;/ref&gt; From there he would also help found the development studio ''[[Crack dot Com]]'', which released the video game'' [[Abuse (video game)|Abuse]]'', a game of which a Linux port was published by Linux vendor [[Red Hat]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Partnership with Crack dot Com Brings Games to Linux |url=http://www.redhat.com/about/news/prarchive/1997/press_crackdotcom.html |publisher=[[Red Hat]] |date=1997-10-07 |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loonygames.com/content/1.10/guest/|title=So Long, Crack.com|publisher=loonygames |accessdate=2011-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[id Software]], the original developers of ''Doom'', also continued to release their products for Linux. Their game ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'' was ported to Linux in 1996, once again by an employee working in his free time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=11261 How To Install Quake 1] Linux.com, November 15, 2000 (Article by Jeff Mrochuk)&lt;/ref&gt; Later id products continued to be ported by [[David Kirsch]] and [[Timothee Besset]] respectively. Other early commercial Linux games included ''[[Hopkins FBI]]'', an adventure game released in 1998 by [[MP Entertainment]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://linux.omnipotent.net/article.php?article_id=6937 Hopkins FBI] Linux.com, February 9, 2000 (article by Jeremy Kuhnash)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.org/docs//ldp/howto/Linux-Gamers-HOWTO/x981.html Websites And Resources - The Linux Gamers' HOWTO] Linux Online&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Inner Worlds (video game)|Inner Worlds]]'' in 1996, which was released for and mostly developed on Linux.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sleepless.com/iw/article.html Internet Based Software Development] Sleepless Software Inc, edited September 19, 2001 (article by Joe Hitchens)&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ryan-Gordon-SELF-2009.png|thumb|right|200px|[[Ryan C. Gordon]] remains an influential figure in the industry.]]
In 1998, a new software firm called [[Loki Software]] was founded by [[Scott Draeker]], a former lawyer who became interested in porting games to Linux after being introduced to the system through his work as a software licensing attorney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/3521 Interview: Scott Draeker and Sam Latinga, Loki Entertainment] ''[[Linux Journal]]'', August 1, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Loki, although a commercial failure, is credited with the birth of the modern Linux game industry. Loki developed several [[free software]] tools, such as the Loki installer (also known as Loki Setup),&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20050309061407/www.macologist.org/viewtopic.php?t=607 Interview with Ryan Gordon: Postal2, Unreal &amp; Mac Gaming - Macologist]&lt;/ref&gt; and supported the development of the [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]], as well as starting the [[OpenAL]] audio library project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/4400 The Story of OpenAL] [[Linux Journal]], January 1, 2001 (Article by Bernd Kreimeier)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.gamespy.com/legacy/articles/loki_a.shtm  Loki and the Linux World Expo - GameSpy chats with Linux legend Scott Draeker about the future of Linux gaming] GameSpot (Article by James Hills)&lt;/ref&gt; These are still often credited{{By whom|date=April 2011}} as being the cornerstones of Linux game development. They were also responsible for bringing nineteen high profile games to the platform before its closure in 2002. Loki's initial success also attracted other firms to invest in the Linux gaming market, such as [[Tribsoft]], [[Hyperion Entertainment]], [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Digital Publishing USA]], [[Xatrix Entertainment]], and [[Philos Laboratories]]. During this time [[Michael Simms (software developer)|Michael Simms]] founded [[Tux Games]], one of the first still active online Linux game retailers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.linuxgamepublishing.com/2009/05/15/lgp-history-pt-1-how-lgp-came-to-be/ Linux Game Publishing Blog, LGP History pt 1: How LGP came to be]&lt;/ref&gt;

After Loki's closure, the Linux game market experienced some changes. Although some new firms, such as [[Linux Game Publishing]] and [[RuneSoft]], would largely continue the role of a standard porting house, the focus began to change with Linux game proponents encouraging game developers to port their game products themselves or through individual contractors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=ODkwOA Alternative Games Is All About Linux Gaming] [[Phoronix]], December 14, 2010 (Article by Michael Larabel)&lt;/ref&gt; Influential to this was [[Ryan C. Gordon]], a former Loki employee who would over the next decade port several game titles to multiple platforms, including Linux.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hardware.no/artikler/ryan_c_gordon_and_michael_simms/68450/2 Porting games to Linux] hardware.no, March 10, 2009 (Article by Robin Heggelund Hansen)&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time many companies, starting with id, also began to release legacy [[source code]] leading to a proliferation of [[source port]]s of older games to Linux and other systems. The Linux gaming market has also experienced some growth over the past few years{{When|date=April 2011}} with the rise of [[independent video game development]], with many &quot;indie&quot; developers favouring support for multiple platforms. The recent [[Humble Indie Bundle]] initiatives have helped formally demonstrate this new trend.&lt;ref name=&quot;humble gdc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/33272/GDC_2011_Humble_Indie_Bundle_Creators_Talk_Inspiration_Execution.php | title = GDC 2011: Humble Indie Bundle Creators Talk Inspiration, Execution | first = Kyle | last = Orland | date = 2011-02-28 | accessdate  =2011-02-28 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of a Linux version of [[Desura]], a [[digital distribution]] platform with a primary focus on small [[independent game development|independent developers]], has also been heralded by several commentators as an important step to greater acknowledgement of Linux as a gaming platform.&lt;ref name=&quot;cheese&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.twolofbees.com/cheesetalks/desura.php | title = cheese talks to himself - Desura Beta | date = 2011-10-11 | accessdate = 2011-11-07 | publisher = twolofbees.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Source ports ====
{{Main|Source port}}

[[File:SimCity-Indigo.gif|right|200px|thumb|''[[Micropolis (video game)|Micropolis]]'', an [[open source]] port of ''[[SimCity]]'']]
Several developers have released the [[source code]] to many of their legacy titles, allowing them to be run as native applications on many alternative platforms, including Linux. Examples of games which were ported to Linux this way include ''[[Duke Nukem 3D]]'', ''[[Shadow Warrior]]'', ''[[Rise of the Triad]]'', ''[[Ken's Labyrinth]]'', ''[[Seven Kingdoms (video game)|Seven Kingdoms]]'', ''[[Warzone 2100]]'', ''[[Homeworld]]'', ''[[Call to Power II]]'', ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'', ''[[Heretic (video game)|Heretic]]'', ''[[Hexen]]'', ''[[Hexen II]]'', ''[[Aliens versus Predator (video game)|Aliens versus Predator]]'', ''[[Descent (video game)|Descent]]'', ''[[Descent II]]'' and ''[[Freespace 2]]''. Several game titles that were previously released for Linux were also able to be expanded or updated because of the availability of game code, including ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'', ''[[Abuse (video game)|Abuse]]'', ''[[Quake (video game)|Quake]]'', ''[[Quake II]]'', ''[[Quake III Arena]]'' and ''[[Jagged Alliance 2]]''. Some derivatives based on released source code have also been released for Linux, such as ''[[Aleph One]]'' and ''[[Micropolis (video game)|Micropolis]]'' for ''[[Marathon 2: Durandal]]'' and ''[[SimCity]]'' respectively.

Certain game titles were even able to be ported due to availability of shared engine code even though the game's code itself remains proprietary or otherwise unavailable, such as the video game ''[[Strife (video game)|Strife]]'' or the multiplayer component of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force]]''. Some games have even been ported entirely or partially by [[reverse engineering]] and [[game engine recreation]] such as ''[[WarCraft II]]'' through ''[[Wargus]]'' or ''[[Commander Keen]]''. Another trick is to attempt hacking the game to work as a [[Mod (computer gaming)|mod]] on another native title, such as with the original ''[[Unreal (video game)|Unreal]]''. Additionally, some games can be run through the use of Linux specific runtime environments, such as the case of certain games made with [[Adventure Game Studio]] such as the ''[[Chzo Mythos]]'' or certain titles made with the [[RPG Maker]] tool. Games derived from released code, with both free and proprietary media, that are released for Linux include ''[[Urban Terror]]'', ''[[OpenArena]]'', ''[[FreeDoom]]'', ''[[World of Padman]]'', ''[[Nexuiz]]/[[Xonotic]]'', ''[[Warsow (video game)|WarÂ§ow]]'' and ''[[Excalibur: Morgana's Revenge]]''.

[[File:Magna-Graecia-Redux-1600x1200.jpg|thumb|right|''[[0 A.D. (video game)|0 A.D.]]'' is a free software project currently under development]]
Several video games that are currently planned or are likely to have Linux ports are currently under development. These include several first-person shooters, such as ''[[Dark Salvation]]'' and ''[[Rage (video game)#Linux port|Rage]]''; some role-playing games such as ''[[The Broken Hourglass]]'', ''[[Wakfu]]'', and ''[[Dilogus: The Winds of War]]''; several strategy games, such as ''[[OilRush]]'', ''[[0 A.D.

These games may be commercial games or free software projects currently under development, some of which may already be available for other platforms.

Some developers have hinted at, but not officially announced, the possibility of Linux ports of their games, such as [[Iron Tower Studio|Iron Tower Studio's]] ''[[The Age of Decadence]]'' and [[Square Enix|Square Enix's]] ''[[Final Fantasy XIV]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Tanaka | first = Hiromichi | title = E3 Square Enix Interview with FFXIclopedia| work =ffxiclopedia.org | date = 2007-07-14| url =http://forums.ffxiclopedia.org/viewtopic.php?t=5032| accessdate = 2008-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emulation and compatibility layers ==
There are also APIs, virtual machines, and machine emulators that provide binary compatibility:

*[[Basilisk II]] for the [[Motorola 68040|68040]] [[Macintosh]];
*[[DOSBox]] and [[DOSEMU]] for MS DOS;
*[[DeSmuME]] for the [[Nintendo DS]];
*[[Dolphin (emulator)|Dolphin]] for the [[Nintendo GameCube]], [[Wii]], and the [[Triforce (arcade system board)|Triforce]];
*[[FCE Ultra]] and [[TuxNES]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]];
*[[Frotz]] for Z-Machine text adventures;

=== Wine gaming ===
Currently, many [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] games can run with minimal problems in a compatibility layer called [[wine (software)|Wine]]. The Wine project hosts a user-submitted [http://appdb.winehq.org/ application database] (known as Wine AppDB) that lists programs and games along with ratings and reviews which detail how well they run with Wine. Some games which are rated as running flawlessly include ''[[Guild Wars]]'', ''[[Supreme Commander (game)|Supreme Commander]]'', ''[[Half Life 2]]'', ''[[Counter-Strike Source]]'', ''[[Left 4 Dead]]'', ''[[Silkroad Online]]'', ''[[Spore (2008 video game)|Spore 1.x]]'', ''[[StarCraft II]]'', ''[[WarCraft III]]'', ''[[The Sims 3]]'', ''[[Star Trek: Voyager - Elite Force]]'', ''[[Duke Nukem: Manhattan Project]]'', and ''[[World of Warcraft]]''. There are also many other games that can be run with varying degrees of success. The use of Wine for gaming has proved controversial in the Linux community as some feel it is preventing, or at least hindering, the further growth of native gaming on the platform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20010511055620/http://www.gamespy.com/articles/may01/wine/ Ports vs. Wine] Gamespot (Article by James Hills)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=linux_gaming_frank&amp;num=3 An Interview With A Linux Game Porter] [[Phoronix]], July 03, 2009 (Article by [[Michael Larabel]])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxgamecast.com/2011/05/l-g-c-how-to-%E2%80%94-trackmania-nations-wine/ How-To - TrackMania Nations] [[LinuxGameCast]], May 30, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
