The [[Boston College Eagles]] are a Division I college basketball program that represents [[Boston College]] in [[Chestnut Hill, MA]]. The team has competed in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] since 2005, having previously played in the [[Big East]]. Home games have been played at the [[Conte Forum]] since 1988, having previously been played at the Roberts Center. The Eagles are coached by [[Steve Donahue]].

==History==
[[Image:BCbasketball1900.jpg|thumb|left|Boston College basketball, ca. 1900]]
In 1904, a men's varsity team was sanctioned and on December 26 of that year, BC played its first-ever game, losing 8â6 to Battery H of [[United States Navy|Navy]]. The team won its first-ever game that season against [[Tufts University|Tufts]], 23â17, in [[Medford, Massachusetts|Medford]]. Basketball, not a popular sport at the turn of the 20th century, suffered through years of weak fan support and only lasted three initial seasons before being dropped. A brief revival in the early 1920s brought the men's team back, but it was dropped again following the 1924â25 season. Finally, following [[World War II]] when the sport began to gain popularity in the United States, the basketball team became a permanent part of the Boston College athletics program in the 1945â46 season. Through 2010-11, there have been 73 seasons of BC basketball.

In 1963, BC hired [[Boston Celtics]] legend [[Bob Cousy]] as head coach, and earned postseason berths in five of his six years as coach, including a trip to the Elite Eight in 1967. Boston College has hired several other notable coaches through the years, including [[Chuck Daly]], [[Tom Davis (basketball)|Dr. Tom Davis]], [[Gary Williams]] and former [[Boston College Eagles|Eagle]], [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]] '71.

In one of the darkest stories in BC history, several members of the 1978-79 basketball team were accused of being involved in [[1978-79 Boston College point shaving scandal|a point-shaving scandal]] that drew national attention due to the involvement of the infamous [[Mafia]] associate [[Henry Hill (mobster)|Henry Hill]]. One player, [[Rick Kuhn]], was found guilty and served time in jail for his efforts in the fix.

Boston College basketball became a charter member of the [[Big East Conference]], which formed in time for the 1979â80 season. With more national exposure and better competition â leading to improved and more expansive recruiting â BC ensured itself of an opportunity to compete at the highest level of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[college basketball|Division I basketball]] every year.

From the time the seven original Northeastern schools formed the Big East, the BC men's basketball team achieved several high points: Advancing to the Elite Eight in the [[1982 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1982 NCAA Tournament]]; winning the [[Big East Tournament]] in 1997 and 2001; four Big East Coach of the Year awards; three Big East Player of the Year awards and a memorable win over No. 1-ranked [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina]] in the [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994 NCAA tourney]].

Among Boston College's biggest non-conference rivals in basketball is the [[UMass Minutemen men's basketball|University of Massachusetts]]. First played in 1905 and held annually since 1995, BC's basketball rivalry with UMass is called the &quot;[[Commonwealth Classic]]&quot; and was played on several occasions at what is now known as [[TD Garden]] in the 1990s. The Eagles are 22â17 against its cross-state rival. The Boston College men's basketball team has made 18 overall appearances in the NCAA tournament, including three trips to the Elite Eight. The team has played in the [[NIT]] 10 times. BC has produced four conference players of the year: 
* [[John Bagley (basketball)|John Bagley]] '83, was the [[Big East Player of the Year]] in 1980â1981
* [[Troy Bell]] '03 was co-Big East Player of the Year in 2000â2001, and won the title outright in 2002â2003
* [[Jared Dudley]] '07 was the ACC Player of the Year in 2006â07.

Notable BC student-athletes who have gone onto a career in the NBA include: [[Michael Adams (basketball)|Michael Adams]] '85, John Bagley '83, [[Dana Barros]] '89, [[Troy Bell]] '03, [[Bill Curley]] '94, [[Howard Eisley]] '94, [[Jay Murphy]] '84, [[Gerry Ward (basketball)|Gerry Ward]] '63, [[Sean Williams (basketball, born 1986)|Sean Williams]] '07, [[Craig Smith]] '06 and [[Jared Dudley]] '07.

===O'Brien returns to The Heights===
On March 26, 1986, [[Jim O'Brien (basketball, born 1949)|Jim O'Brien]] '71 returned to coach the Boston College Eagles basketball team. Despite a bitter end to his tenure as head coach, O'Brien has been credited with resuscitating the BC basketball team, which â aside from some success in the early 80s â had not been a consistent NCAA tournament contender since the 1960s. Although O'Brien did build a solid program, his timing was excellent: Boston College opened its new hockey and basketball arena, [[Conte Forum]], in 1988, (fully equipped with state-of-the-art facilities); the Big East had reached its zenith when O'Brien took the reins with conference teams winning national championships in 1984 and 1985; and O'Brien and BC, at the time, were still feeling the positive effects of the [[Flutie factor]] with Boston College athletics increasing in national exposure.

Boston College played its final season in the [[Roberts Center]] in the 1987â88 season and were invited to the NIT, advancing to the semi-finals before being knocked-off by regional rival [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]], 73â67. BC returned to the NIT in [[1992 National Invitation Tournament|1992]] and [[1993 National Invitation Tournament|1993]].

In 1994, the Eagles were beaten by [[Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball|Georgetown]] 81â58 in the first round of the Big East tournament. But, following its invitation to the NCAA's, the men's basketball team went on one of its most historic runs. Boston College defeated [[Washington State Cougars men's basketball|Washington State]] in the opening round of the tourney. In the second round, BC had its memorable upset of defending national champion North Carolina, 75â72, pushing them to the [[1994 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]]. After a victory over [[Bob Knight|Bobby Knight]] and [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]], the team went back to the Elite Eight where it fell to [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]], 74â66.

In 1996, the Eagles also made it to the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|Big Dance]]. BC finished the year at 19â11, and bowed out in the second round after losing to [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech]] by a score of 103â89.

Led by All-Big East forward [[Danya Abrams]] and sophomore point guard [[Scoonie Penn|James &quot;Scoonie&quot; Penn]], Boston College won the 1997 Big East Tournament with victories over [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pitt]], Georgetown and [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]]. For its Big East Tournament championship, BC received an automatic bid to [[1997 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|The Dance]] and met [[Valparaiso Crusaders|Valparaiso]]. The Eagles knocked off its first-round opponent 73-66, but fell in the second round to [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|St. Joe's]] when the Hawks eked out an 81-77 win.

Controversy erupted after the 1997 season as Jim O'Brien and the Boston College administration sparred over academic standards in recruiting athletes. O'Brien filed a lawsuit against BC on the grounds of breach of contract and slander. The case was settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bc.edu/bc_org/rvp/pubaf/chronicle/v6/my22/leahy.html B.C., Former Coach Resolve Lawsuit&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Following a bitter end to his tenure, the BC alumnus moved to [[Ohio State University|Ohio State]], and brought his star playmaker Scoonie Penn with him. At Ohio State, O'Brien took the Buckeyes to the Final Four in 1999. Unfortunately, his tenure at Ohio State also ended on bitter terms and litigation by O'Brien against his former employer.

===Skinner era begins===
{{update section|date=October 2010}}
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2010}}
In 1997, former [[Rhode Island Rams men's basketball|Rhode Island]] head coach and [[American Basketball Association (1967-1976)|ABA]] star, [[Al Skinner]] came to The Heights to coach the men's team. Following three sub-.500 seasons, Skinner lead the Eagles to a Big East-best 27â5 mark in 2000â01 (setting a then-school record for wins in a season), the [[2001 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East tournament]] title and a No. 3 seed in the [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]]. BC defeated [[Southern Utah Thunderbirds men's basketball|Southern Utah]] in the opening round of the tourney, but was upset by [[USC Trojans men's basketball|USC]] 74â71 in the second round. Skinner went on to win Big East Coach of the Year honors and star sophomore [[Troy Bell]] was named Big East Co-Player of the Year.

Since the inception of the Skinner era, Boston College has seen increased success on the basketball court and has garnered growing national media attention, receiving seven bids to the NCAA tournament in the last ten years as of 2010. In its first season in ACC, BC advanced to the finals of the league tournament losing by two points to [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]] and returned to the semifinal round in [[2007 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|2007]].

Some have argued Skinner's success is predicated on his ability to recruit student-athletes that other schools never bother to look at, so-called &quot;diamonds in the rough.&quot; Bell, who grew up in [[Minneapolis]], who won two Big East Player of the Year awards and is currently the BC all-time leading scorer, fits that description in addition to [[Jared Dudley]], [[Sean Williams (Boston College)|Sean Williams]], Sean Marshall and [[All-American]] forward [[Craig Smith]], a Los Angeles native, who was overlooked by most [[Pacific Ten Conference|Pac-10]] schools.

On an interesting note, the Eagles defeated the defending national champions in three consecutive seasons from the 2003â04 season through the [[2005-06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2005-06 season]]: [[2003-04 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] 57â54 (on 2004-03-11), [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]] 75-70 (on 2005-01-05) and [[2005-06 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|UNC]] 81â74 (on 2006-01-25 and 2006-03-11).

====20 straight to start: 2004â05 season====
Though the 2000â01 season was a memorable one for BC and its fans as it re-vamped local interest in the Chestnut Hill men's hoops team, it paled to the national exposure and media attention the Eagles garnered in 2004â05. Starting the year unranked and without one vote in the coaches' poll, Boston College accomplished something no Big East team had done before: it started a season 20â0. In the 20 straight victories, the Eagles beat two ranked opponents and, when they reached the 20â0 mark, were one of only two teams to be undefeated at the time ([[2004-05 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois]] was the other).

The team's first loss occurred at [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball|Notre Dame]] on February 8, 2005. Following its setback, BC beat unranked [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights men's basketball|Rutgers]] and then No. 9 [[2004-05 Syracuse Orange men's basketball team|Syracuse]] on February 19, vaulting them in the polls to No. 3 in both the AP and coaches' polls â the highest any Boston College basketball team has ever been ranked. Finishing the regular season with a 24â3 mark, [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]] bounced BC from the [[2005 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament|Big East tournament]], 78â72, in the second round after the Eagles had drawn a bye in the first due to being the No. 1 overall seed with the league's best record (13â3). Boston College earned an invitation to the [[2005 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2005 NCAA tournament]] and received a No. 4 seed, with an opening-round game against [[Pennsylvania Quakers men's basketball|Penn]]. The Eagles took care of the Quakers with an 85â65 thrashing and then took on [[Milwaukee Panthers men's basketball|Milwaukee]], who had upset [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]]. UWM pulled another upset with an 83â75 win over Boston College and sent the Eagles home before the Sweet Sixteen.

====Back to the Sweet Sixteen: 2005â06 season====
[[Image:Conte Forum Hoops.jpg|thumb|left|BC playing West Virginia at home in 2005.]]
The men's basketball team played its way to a school-record 28 wins and back to the Sweet Sixteen for the first time in 12 years. Boston College also established itself in the Atlantic Coast Conference with 11 league wins in its first year in the conference, and advanced to the league tournament title game against Duke following wins over Maryland and [[2005-06 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]]. BC would finish the season ranked No. 7 in the AP poll, which tallies its final poll before the NCAA tournament begins.

Coming into 2005â06, the offseason produced some change to the team as center [[Nate Doornekamp]] and sixth man [[Jermaine Watson]] graduated. Doornekamp, though not a prolific scorer, was a leader and, with his 7 feet of height, could see the court well and pass the ball with good precision. Watson averaged 9.6 points-per-game off the bench and was a clutch [[free throw]] shooter, averaging 83 percent to lead the team.

An offseason incident concerning drug use in May involving center Sean Williams lead to his suspension for the first semester from BC campus and from the team, and his playing status for the entire season was in doubt up until a court hearing in December. Williams set the BC single-season record for blocked shots in 2004â05 with 63. Although not allowed back to Chestnut Hill until the end of the first semester and contingent upon a court hearing, Williams took courses and worked out at the [[University of Houston]] in the fall of 2005. He was allowed to return after a Boston judge decided he had fulfilled his commitment and the school gave their approval because he met his academic requirements. Also in trouble was sophomore forward Akida McLain who was suspended from the team for the first seven games of the year for an off-court incident.

Prior to the season, senior forward Craig Smith was voted a first-team All-American, the first BC player to be so honored, and named to the All-ACC preseason team â before even playing one game in the league. Boston College entered its first season in the ACC ranked No. 11 in both major polls and started the year 6-0 and reached as high as No. 6 on December 5. On December 11 McLain was reinstated and on December 22, Williams returned to the team and registered two blocks in his first game back against [[Harvard Crimson Tide|Harvard]].

After starting ACC play with three straight losses ([[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]], Georgia Tech, [[North Carolina State Wolfpack men's basketball|NC State]]), senior point guard Louis Hinnant called a players-only meeting which helped to inspire the team to bounce back from a poor conference start. The Eagles rebounded to win four consecutive league wins â winning its first ACC game against [[Florida State Seminoles|Florida State]] on January 14. After its four straight league wins, BC dropped one to No. 3-ranked [[Duke Blue Devils basketball|Duke]] on February 1.

Boston College then beat [[Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball|Virginia Tech]] and [[Wake Forest Demon Deacons|Wake Forest]] both on the road, followed by a home win over [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]]. On February 13, BC downed [[State University of New York at Stony Brook|Stony Brook]] to reach the 20-win mark for the fifth time in six years. On February 25, Skinner earned his 169th Boston College win when the Eagles downed NC State 74â72 in double overtime, making the former ABA star the winningest coach in BC history. The Eagles finished the 2005â06 regular season with a 24â6 record and ended conference play at 11â5.

Boston College trounced Maryland (after receiving a bye) in the second round of the [[2006 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC Tournament]] on March 10, 80â66, and then edged No. 10 North Carolina 85â82 the next afternoon to advance to the ACC Championship Game in its first year in the league. No. 3 Duke squeaked out a 78â76 win in a thrilling ACC championship game on March 12.

BC earned a No. 4 seed in the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] playing in the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Minneapolis]] bracket, and defeated [[University of the Pacific (United States)|Pacific]] on March 16 in a thrilling 88-76 double-OT game. The Eagles trailed by six points with just over two minutes remaining in the initial overtime. Following key three pointers by Dudley and Hinnant, BC went to Smith with only seconds remaining and, after being fouled, the All-ACC forward hit two free throws with four seconds left to tie the game at 74â74. Forcing a second overtime, BC went on a 14â2 run in the second OT to win the game. Against 12th-seeded [[University of Montana-Missoula|Montana]], Boston College won 69â56, advancing to the regional semifinals for the first time since 1994.

In its Sweet Sixteen matchup against [[Villanova Wildcats men's basketball|Villanova]], BC lost a heartbreaker, 60â59, in overtime. The Eagles led by as many as 14 points in the first half and controlled much of the initial 35 minutes of the game. But the Wildcats captured their first lead with 2:18 remaining in the second half when Randy Foye hit two free throws to give 'Nova a 49â48 lead, and his layup expanded it to 51â48. With 28 seconds left Dudley dropped a 3-pointer to tie the score.

In an exciting overtime session, a Smith basket gave BC a 59â58 lead. It was later learned that Smith played the entire overtime period with a broken hand. With only seconds remaining, Wildcat forward Will Sheridan slipped past his defender and scored the winning two points on a goaltending call against Sean Williams with 2.3 seconds left. Hinnant's desperation 3 missed at the buzzer â as Nova moved on to the Elite Eight.

====2006âpresent: Rebuilding years====
=====2006â07 season=====
Boston College had quite a successful [[2006-07 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2006â2007 season]], but did slip from the [[2005-06 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|year before]]. They were led by seniors, Jared Dudley and Sean Marshall. Dudley led the Eagles to 4th in the ACC and a return to the [[2006 ACC Men's Basketball Tournament|ACC semifinal]], but lost to [[2005-06 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]]. They then got a bid to the [[2006 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA tournament]] and received a #7 and a first round game against [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]] in which they won, but then faced a tough Georgetown team in the second round. They lost, but gave the Hoyas a run for their money. BC also lost Dudley and Marshall to the pros and had to rely on junior, Tyrese Rice, in the [[2007-08 Boston College Eagles men's basketball team|2007â2008 season]].

=====2007â08 season=====
The Eagles struggled in [[2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007â2008]] going 14â17 and 4â12 in conference play. BC, however, got 3 good freshmen in Rakim Sanders, Josh Southern, and Corey Raji. Rice had many impressive performances such as his 48 point performance against North Carolina that ended up in an 90-80 loss. BC had trouble finishing off teams and going into [[2008-09 Boston College Eagles men's basketball team|2008-2009]] had 1 senior, 1 junior, and the rest freshmen and sophomores.

=====2008â09 season=====
BC had a solid 8â2 start to the [[2008-09 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2008â2009 season]] with the addition of Vermont-transfer forward [[Joe Trapani]]. BC went 3â1 in the [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] tip-off, losing only to a tough Purdue team 71â64 and coming in 3rd in the whole tournament.

To start the 2008â09 ACC Season, the Eagles stunned the then-undefeated #1-ranked [[2008-09 North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball team|North Carolina]] Tar Heels in the [[Dean Smith Center|Dean Dome]] 85â78, behind great play by Rice, Sanders, and freshman [[Reggie Jackson (basketball player)|Reggie Jackson]]. Despite the enormity of the win and the national attention that came with it, the Eagles promptly lost at home to Harvard 82â70 in the following game. In all, they suffered 4 consecutive losses after the North Carolina victory including [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|Miami]], [[2008-09 Wake Forest Demon Deacons men's basketball team|Wake Forest]], and [[2008-09 Virginia Tech Hokies men's basketball team|Virginia Tech]]. The slump ended with a win in overtime against [[2008-09 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball team|Georgia Tech]]. BC then got 3 more key ACC wins against NC State, Maryland, and Virginia Tech. In the Virginia Tech game, BC won in exciting fashion via a put-back shot with less than a second remaining. That made BC 5-3 in the ACC and 17â6 overall. After a win at Virginia, the Eagles were just a half game out of first place in the conference. The Eagles went on a two game losing streak, after losing halftime leads against No. 7 Wake Forest and No. 11 Clemson. On February 15 Boston College Defeated #6 Duke 80â74 at home. Tyrese Rice scored 21 points, including his 2,000th career point at BC. It was the Eagles' first win over the Blue Devils in 24 years, and BC was the only team to beat both Duke and UNC that season. After the victory against Duke, the Eagles lost their next game to Miami (Fla.) for the second time in the same year.  After this setback, BC went 2â1 down the stretch with home victories over #25 Florida State and a Rakim Sanders buzzer beater over Georgia Tech. They finished the regular season 21â10 and sixth in the ACC. In the first round of the conference tournament the Eagles beat Virginia 76â63 and moved on to play #8 Duke in the second round.  BC lost to the Blue Devils 66â65 on a last minute heart-breaker and were bounced from the tournament.  The Eagles finished the season 22â11 (9â7).  Senior Tyrese Rice was named to the 2nd team All-ACC after being on the 1st team All-ACC the previous year.

BC received a #7 seed and a date with a USC team led by future first-round draft pick Taj Gibson on March 20, 2009. However, that was the last game Tyrese Rice ever played in a BC uniform. The Eagles led by 4 at the half, but ultimately lost 72â55. Although the team lost Rice to graduation, all other players would return for the 2009-10 season.

=====2009â10 season=====
The Eagles had a disappointing 2009-2010 season, finishing 15-16 (6-10 in the ACC). The team's most notable games were losses to struggling programs, including Maine, Saint Joseph's, and (for the second straight year) Harvard. They ended the season with a loss to Virginia in the ACC Tournament, bringing the Eagles' all-time record in the tournament to .500 (5-5).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcinterruption.com/pages/boston-college-acc-mens-basketball|title= Boston College ACC Men's Basketball Tournament History|publisher=bcinterruption.com|date=2010-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 30, 2010, head coach Al Skinner was fired and soon replaced by former Cornell coach Steve Donahue, who had just completed guiding the Big Red to the Sweet Sixteen and the Ivy League's best performance in the tournament since 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/sports/colleges/extras/colleges_blog/2010/03/bc_fires_skinne.html|title= BC fires Skinner|publisher=bostonglobe.com|date=2010-03-30 | first=Mark | last=Blaudschun}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
With the loss of Skinner, Boston Colleege junior forward Rakim Sanders decided to transfer, landing at Fairfield where former BC Assistant Ed Cooley is head coach. Recruits Brady Heslip and Kevin Noreen also asked to be released form their letters of intent and never matriculated at BC. The team's lone senior, Tyler Roche, graduated after the 2009-2010 season.

=====2010â11 season=====
In Steve Donahue's first season as head coach, the Eagles roster featured seven seniors but was led by star junior guard [[Reggie Jackson (basketball player)|Reggie Jackson]], who was named to the first team All-ACC. BC finished the regular season at 19-11, 9-7 in the ACC. That conference record earned them a 5-seed in the ACC tournament, where they beat 12-seeded Wake Forest. However they lost a tough game to 4-seed Clemson. Boston College was one of multiple ACC teams on the NCAA tournament bubble. The Eagles were expected to be on of the &quot;first four&quot; teams. However they missed out on a seed to rival Clemson and surprisingly VCU and UAB. They received a 1 seed in the NIT. They won in the first round. However, they lost by double figures to 4-seed Northwestern. Their final record was 20-12. The season was highlighted by a marquee win over Texas A&amp;M, and sweeps of Maryland and Virginia Tech. On the other hand, the team was swept by the Ivy League, losing to Yale and Harvard at home; it was the third straight year that the Eagles lost to the Crimson, despite Harvard losing its star guard, Jeremy Lin, to graduation the previous year.
