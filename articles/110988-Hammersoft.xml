'''Harvey''' is a city in [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]], [[Illinois]], [[United States]], near [[Chicago]]. The population was 30,000 at the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]].

Harvey is bordered by [[Dixmoor, Illinois|Dixmoor]], [[Riverdale, Illinois|Riverdale]] and [[Blue Island, Illinois|Blue Island]] to the north, [[Posen, Illinois|Posen]] and [[Markham, Illinois|Markham]] to the west, [[South Holland, Illinois|South Holland]], [[Phoenix, Illinois|Phoenix]], and [[Dolton, Illinois|Dolton]] to the east, and [[East Hazel Crest, Illinois|East Hazel Crest]] to the south.

It is the birthplace and childhood home of Billboard Hot 100 #1 hit recording artist and longtime dramatic actor [[Bill Hayes (actor)|Bill Hayes]], who is perhaps best known for his portrayal of Doug Williams from 1970 to the present on the long-running NBC soap opera ''[[Days of our Lives]]''.

==Geography==
Harvey is located at {{coord|41|36|39|N|87|39|7|W|type:city}} (41.610934, â87.651895){{GR|1}}.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|6.2|sqmi|km2}}, all of it land.

==History==
Harvey was founded in 1891 by Christian leader [[Turlington W. Harvey]], a close associate of [[Dwight Moody]] (founder of the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in Chicago).  Harvey was originally intended as a model town for Christian values and [[temperance movement|temperance]] (no-alcohol, see [[Temperance Towns]]); it was closely modeled after the company town of [[Pullman, Chicago|Pullman]] (which eventually was annexed into the city of Chicago).{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

==Demographics==
As of the [[census]]{{GR|2}} of 2000, there were 30,000 people, 8,990 households, and 6,760 families residing in the city.  The [[population density]] was 4,842.2 people per square mile (1,868.2/kmÂ²).  There were 10,158 housing units at an average density of 1,639.6 per square mile (632.6/kmÂ²).  The racial makeup of the city was 79.57% [[African American (U.S. Census)|African American]], 10.02% [[White (U.S. Census)|White]], 0.26% [[Native American (U.S. Census)|Native American]], 0.38% [[Asian (U.S. Census)|Asian]], 0.05% [[Pacific Islander (U.S. Census)|Pacific Islander]], 7.94% from [[Race (United States Census)|other races]], and 1.78% from two or more races. [[Hispanic (U.S. Census)|Hispanic]] or [[Latino (U.S. Census)|Latino]] of any race were 12.78% of the population.

There were 8,990 households out of which 39.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 36.4% were [[Marriage|married couples]] living together, 31.8% had a female householder with no husband present, and 24.8% were non-families. 20.7% of all households were made up of individuals and 7.1% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older.  The average household size was 3.30 and the average family size was 3.80.

In the city the population was spread out with 35.1% under the age of 18, 10.8% from 18 to 24, 26.7% from 25 to 44, 18.8% from 45 to 64, and 8.6% who were 65 years of age or older.  The median age was 28 years. For every 100 females there were 92.2 males.  For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 86.0 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $31,958, and the median income for a family was $35,378.  Males had a median income of $30,610 versus $25,248 for females. The [[per capita income]] for the city was $12,336.  About 20.3% of families and 21.7% of the population were below the [[poverty line]], including 27.8% of those under age 18 and 17.6% of those age 65 or over.

==Government==
Harvey is in [[Illinois' 2nd congressional district]].

==Transportation==
Harvey is serviced by two stations along the [[Metra Electric]] University Park line to Chicago. One is at 147th Street(a.k.a. Sibley Boulevard) &amp; Clinton Street, and the other is at Park Avenue &amp; 154th Street.

Three major north-south streets in Chicago venture as far south as Harvey in some capacity.  Halsted Street (Illinois Route 1) runs through the east side of town.  [[Dixie Highway]], as it is known in Harvey, is Western Avenue in Chicago.  Finally, Chicago's Ashland Avenue becomes Wood Street in Harvey.  The reason for this is a [[surveying|surveyor's]] error along the line where [[Interstate 57]] is now located; Harvey's street names and numbers conform to the [[Section (United States land surveying)|section lines]] rather than actual distance from Chicago's base lines (as indicated by the jogs in Halsted Street near 150th Street and 159th Street between Harvey and Markham, as examples). Harvey's own Ashland Avenue serves as the east-west dividing line for house numbering.

==Harvey in film==
The [[Dixie Square Mall]], an abandoned [[shopping mall]] in Harvey, was the location where the famous car chase scene in the movie ''[[The Blues Brothers (film)|The Blues Brothers]]'' was shot.  Although the mall was closed in November 1978, the makers of the film convinced the city to allow them to shoot the scene.  The mall was remodeled and filled with stores for two days in order to shoot the scene.  After filming was completed, the mall was boarded up and closed again.  The main precinct of the Harvey Police Department was built on part of the old parking lot during the 1990s.
