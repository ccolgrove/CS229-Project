'''Beryllium''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|b|É|Ë|r|Éª|l|i|É|m}} {{respell|bÉ|RIL|ee-Ém}}) is the [[chemical element]] with the symbol '''Be''' and [[atomic number]] 4. It is a [[divalent]] element which occurs naturally only in combination with other elements in [[mineral]]s. Notable gemstones which contain beryllium include [[beryl]] ([[Aquamarine (gemstone)|aquamarine]], [[emerald]]) and [[chrysoberyl]]. As a free element it is a steel-gray, strong, lightweight and brittle [[alkaline earth metal]].

Beryllium is used primarily as a hardening agent in [[alloy]]s, notably [[beryllium copper]]. In structural applications, high [[flexural rigidity]], [[thermal stability]], [[thermal conductivity]] and low [[density]] (1.85 times that of water) make beryllium a quality [[aerospace]] material for high-speed [[aircraft]], [[missile]]s, [[space vehicle]]s and [[communication satellite]]s. Because of its low density and [[atomic mass]], beryllium is relatively transparent to X-rays and other forms of [[ionizing radiation]]; therefore, it is the most common window material for X-ray equipment and in [[particle physics experiments]]. The high thermal conductivity of beryllium and [[beryllium oxide]] have led to their use in [[heat conduction|heat transport]] and [[heat sink]]ing applications.

The commercial use of beryllium metal presents technical challenges due to the [[toxicity]] (especially by inhalation) of beryllium-containing dusts. Beryllium is corrosive to tissue, and can cause a chronic life-threatening allergic disease called [[berylliosis]] in some people. Because any Beryllium [[nucleosynthesis|synthesized]] in stars is short-lived, it is a relatively rare element in both the Earth and the universe. The element is not known to be necessary or useful for either plant or animal life.

==Characteristics==
===Physical properties===
Beryllium has exceptional [[flexural rigidity]] ([[Young's modulus]] 287 GPa) and a reasonably high [[melting point]]. The [[modulus of elasticity]] of beryllium is approximately 50% greater than that of steel. The combination of this modulus and a relatively low density results in an unusually fast [[speed of sound|sound conduction speed]] in beryllium â about 12.9&amp;nbsp;km/s at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]]. Other significant properties are high specific heat (1925 JÂ·kg&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;Â·K&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;) and thermal conductivity (216 WÂ·m&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;Â·K&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;), which make beryllium the metal with the best heat dissipation characteristics per unit weight. In combination with the relatively low coefficient of linear [[thermal expansion]] (11.4Ã10&lt;sup&gt;â6&lt;/sup&gt; K&lt;sup&gt;â1&lt;/sup&gt;), these characteristics result in a unique stability under conditions of thermal loading.&lt;ref name=Be&gt;{{Cite book| title = Landolt-BÃ¶rnstein&amp;nbsp;â Group VIII Advanced Materials and Technologies: Powder Metallurgy Data.

===Nuclear properties===
Beryllium has a large scattering cross section for high-energy neutrons, about 6 [[barn (unit)|barn]]s for energies above ~0.01 eV. Therefore, it effectively slows the neutrons to the [[neutron temperature|thermal energy]] range of below 0.03 eV, where the total cross section is at least an order of magnitude lower â exact value strongly depends on the purity and size of the crystallites in the material. The predominant beryllium isotope &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be also undergoes a (n,2n) neutron reaction to &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be, which then instantaneously breaks into two alpha particles; that is, beryllium is a neutron multiplier, releasing more neutrons than it absorbs. This nuclear reaction is:&lt;ref name =&quot;BeMelurgy&quot;/&gt; 
:{{Nuclide|Beryllium|9}} + n â 2({{Nuclide|Helium|4}}) + 2n

As a metal, beryllium is [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] to most wavelengths of [[X-ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s, making it useful for the output windows of [[X-ray tube]]s and other such apparatus. It is also a good source for the relatively-small numbers of free [[neutron]]s in the laboratory which are liberated when beryllium [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]] are struck by energetic [[alpha particle]]s&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; producing the nuclear reaction

===Isotopes and nucleosynthesis===
{{Main|Isotopes of beryllium|beryllium-10}}
Both stable and unstable isotopes of beryllium are created in stars, but these do not last long. It is believed that most of the stable beryllium in the universe was created when [[cosmic rays]] induced fission in heavier elements found in interstellar gas and dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=ILQ7sTrRixMC&amp;pg=PA172|page=172|title=Physics: 1981â1990|author=Ekspong, G. ''et al.'' |publisher=World Scientific|year=1992|pages=172 ff.|isbn=9789810207298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Solar Activity Proxies.png|thumb|left|300px|Plot showing variations in solar activity, including variation in &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be concentration. Note that the beryllium scale is inverted, so increases on this scale indicate lower &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be levels]]
Beryllium contains only one stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be, and therefore is a [[monoisotopic element]]. [[Cosmogenic]] &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is produced in the [[Earth's atmosphere|atmosphere of the Earth]] by the [[cosmic ray spallation]] of [[oxygen]] and [[nitrogen]]. Cosmogenic &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be accumulates at the [[soil]] surface, where its relatively long [[half-life]] (1.36 million years) permits a long [[residence time]] before decaying to [[boron]]-10. Thus, &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be and its daughter products are used to examine natural [[soil erosion]], [[soil formation]] and the development of [[laterite|lateritic soil]]s, and as a [[Proxy (climate)|proxy]] for measurement of the variations in [[solar activity]] and the age of [[ice core]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sahra.arizona.edu/programs/isotopes/beryllium.html |title=Beryllium: Isotopes and Hydrology |author= |date= |work= |publisher=University of Arizona, Tucson |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The production of &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be is inversely proportional to the solar activity, because the increased [[solar wind]] during periods of high solar magnetic activity in turn decreases the flux of [[galactic cosmic ray]]s that reach the Earth. Nuclear explosions also form &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be by the reaction of fast neutrons with &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C in the carbon dioxide in air. This is one of the indicators of past activity at [[nuclear weapon test]] sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jenvrad.2007.07.016|year=2008|month=Feb|author=Whitehead, N; Endo, S; Tanaka, K; Takatsuji, T; Hoshi, M; Fukutani, S; Ditchburn, Rg; Zondervan, A|title=A preliminary study on the use of (10)Be in forensic radioecology of nuclear explosion sites|volume=99|issue=2|pages=260â70 |pmid=17904707|journal=Journal of environmental radioactivity}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The isotope &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be (half-life 53 days) is also cosmogenic, and shows an atmospheric abundance linked to sunspots much like &lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;Be. &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be has a very short half-life of about 7{{e|-17}} s that contributes to its significant cosmological role, as elements heavier than beryllium could not have been produced by nuclear fusion in the [[Big Bang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Boyd |first1=R. N. |last2=Kajino |first2= T. |year=1989 |title=Can Be-9 provide a test of cosmological theories? |journal=The Astrophysical Journal |volume=336|bibcode=1989ApJ...336L..55B |pages=L55 |doi=10.1086/185360}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the lack of sufficient time during the Big Bang's [[nucleosynthesis]] phase to produce carbon by the fusion of &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He nuclei and the very low concentrations of available [[beryllium-8]]. The [[British (people)|British]] [[astronomer]] Sir [[Fred Hoyle]] first showed that the energy levels of &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;C allow carbon production by the so-called [[triple-alpha process]] in helium-fueled stars where more nucleosynthesis time is available, thus making creation of [[carbon-based life]] possible from the gas and dust ejected by [[supernova]]s (see also [[Big Bang nucleosynthesis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=PXGWGnPPo0gC&amp;pg=PA223|page=223|title=Supernovae and nucleosynthesis|author=Arnett, David |publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1996|isbn=0691011478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The innermost electrons of beryllium may contribute to chemical bonding. Therefore, when &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Be decays by [[electron capture]], it does so by taking electrons from [[atomic orbital]]s that may participate in bonding. This makes its decay rate dependent to a measurable degree upon its electron configuration&amp;nbsp;â a rare occurrence in nuclear decay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/ParticleAndNuclear/decay_rates.html|title = How to Change Nuclear Decay Rates|first = Bill|last = Johnson|publisher = University of California, Riverside|accessdate = 2008-03-30 |year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shortest-lived known isotope of beryllium is &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;Be which decays through [[neutron emission]]. It has a half-life of 2.7&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;â21&lt;/sup&gt; s. &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Be is also very short-lived with a half-life of 5.0&amp;nbsp;Ã&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;â21&lt;/sup&gt; s.&lt;ref name=crc&gt;Hammond, C. R. &quot;Elements&quot; in {{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exotic isotopes &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;Be and &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;Be are known to exhibit a [[Halo nucleus|nuclear halo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi = 10.1146/annurev.ns.45.120195.003111|title = Nuclear Halos|year = 1995|author = Hansen, P.

The beryllium concentration in the Earth's surface rocks is ca. 4â6 ppm by atoms. Beryllium is a major constituent of about 100 out of some 4000 known [[mineral]]s, the most important of which are [[bertrandite]] (Be&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[beryl]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Be&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;), [[chrysoberyl]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BeO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[phenakite]] (Be&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SiO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).

==Production==
Because of its high affinity for oxygen at elevated temperatures, and its ability to reduce water when its oxide film is removed, the extraction of beryllium from its compounds is a difficult process. [[Electrolysis]] of a mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] was used to isolate beryllium during the 19th century. The metal's high melting point makes this process more energy-consuming than corresponding processes used for the [[alkali metals]]. Early in the 20th century, the production of beryllium by the thermal decomposition of [[beryllium iodide]] was investigated following the success of a similar process for the production of [[zirconium]], but this process proved to be uneconomical for volume production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1080/08827508808952633|title=Beryllium Extraction&amp;nbsp;â A Review|year=1988|author=Babu, R. S.|journal=Mineral Processing and Extractive Metallurgy Review|volume=4|pages=39|last2=Gupta|first2=C. K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pure beryllium metal did not become readily available until 1957, even though it had been used as an alloying metal to harden and toughen copper much earlier. Beryllium could be produced by reducing beryllium compounds such as [[beryllium chloride]] with metallic potassium or sodium. Currently most beryllium is produced by reducing beryllium fluoride with purified [[magnesium]]. The price on the American market for [[Casting (metalworking)|vacuum-cast]] beryllium ingots was about $338 per pound ($745 per kilogram) in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;USGS&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/beryllium/|title = Beryllium Statistics and Information|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chemical equation for the key reaction is as follows:

Beryllium metal is located above aluminium in the electrochemical series and therefore is expected to show significant chemical activity; however, it is passivated by an oxide layer and does not react with air or water even at [[red heat]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once ignited, beryllium burns brilliantly forming a mixture of [[beryllium oxide]] and [[beryllium nitride]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt; Beryllium dissolves readily in non-[[oxidizing acid]]s, such as HCl and diluted H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, but not in [[nitric acid]] as this forms the oxide. This behavior is similar to that of aluminium metal. Beryllium, again similarly to aluminium, dissolves in warm alkali solutions to form the beryllate anion, Be(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2â&lt;/sup&gt;, and hydrogen gas.

The beryllium atom has the electronic configuration [He] 2s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In beryllium compounds the two electrons are lost and beryllium is in the +2 [[oxidation state]]; the only evidence of lower valence of beryllium is in the solubility of the metal in [[beryllium dichloride|BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Wiberg&amp;Holleman&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|author=Wiberg, Egon; Holleman, Arnold Frederick|year=2001|title=Inorganic Chemistry|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=0123526515}}&lt;/ref&gt; The small [[atomic radius]] leads to significant [[Covalent bond|covalent]] character in beryllium's bonding.&lt;ref name = &quot;Greenwood&quot;/&gt; Beryllium is 4-fold coordinated in virtually all of its derivatives, e.g. [Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and tetrahaloberyllates, BeX&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2â&lt;/sup&gt;. This characteristic is employed in analytical techniques using [[EDTA]] as a ligand.

Beryllium forms [[binary compound]]s with many non-metals. [[Anhydrous]] [[halide]]s are known for F, Cl, Br and I.

==History==
Early analyses of [[emerald]]s and [[beryl]]s &lt;!--by [[Martin Heinrich Klaproth]], [[Torbern Olof Bergman]], [[Franz Karl Achard]], and Johann Jakob Bindheim--&gt; always yielded similar elements, leading to the fallacious conclusion that both substances are [[aluminium silicate]]s. [[RenÃ© Just HaÃ¼y]] discovered that both crystals show strong similarities, and he asked the [[chemist]] [[Louis-Nicolas Vauquelin]] for a chemical analysis. Vauquelin was able to separate the aluminium from the beryllium by dissolving the [[aluminium hydroxide]] in an additional [[alkali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal = Annales de Chimie|url = http://books.google.com/books?id=dB8AAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA155|pages = 155â169| first = Louis-Nicolas|last = Vauquelin|title = De l'Aiguemarine, ou BÃ©ril; et dÃ©couverie d'une terre nouvelle dans cette pierre| year = 1798| issue = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vauquelin named the new element &quot;glucinum&quot; for the sweet taste of some of its compounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last = Weeks|first = Mary Elvira |year = 1933|title = The Discovery of the Elements |publisher = Journal of Chemical Education |location = Easton, PA |chapter = XII.

:BeCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 K â 2 KCl + Be

The potassium itself had been produced by the [[electrolysis]] of its compounds, a newly discovered process. This chemical method yielded only small grains of beryllium from which no ingot of metal could be cast or hammered. The direct electrolysis of a molten mixture of [[beryllium fluoride]] and [[sodium fluoride]] by [[Paul Lebeau]] in 1898 resulted in the first pure samples of beryllium.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weeks&quot;/&gt; It took until [[World War I]] (1914â18) before significant amounts of beryllium were produced, but large-scale production was not started until early 1930s. It saw a rapid increase during [[World War II]], due to the rising demand for hard beryllium-copper [[alloy]]s and [[phosphor]]s for [[fluorescent light]]s. In the first years, most fluorescent lamps used [[zinc orthosilicate]] with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium [[tungstate]] improved the blue part of the spectrum yielding acceptable white. After it was discovered that beryllium was toxic, halophosphate-based phosphors took over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter = A Review of Early Inorganic Phosphors|url =http://books.google.com/books?id=klE5qGAltjAC&amp;pg=PA98|page = 98|title = Revolution in lamps: a chronicle of 50 years of progress|isbn = 9780881733785|author1 = Kane, Raymond|author2 = Sell, Heinz|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
Early usage of the word ''beryllium'' can be traced to many languages, including [[Latin]] ''Beryllus''; French ''BÃ©ry''; [[Greek language|Greek]] ''Î²Î®ÏÏÎ»Î»Î¿Ï'', ''bÄrullos'', ''beryl''; [[Prakrit]] ''veruliya'' (à¤µà¥à¤°à¥à¤²à¤¿à¤¯â); [[PÄli]] ''veá¸·uriya'' (à¤µà¥à¤²à¥à¤°à¤¿à¤¯), ''veá¸·iru'' (à¤­à¥à¤²à¤¿à¤°à¥) or ''viá¸·ar'' (à¤­à¤¿à¤²à¤°à¥) â &quot;to become pale,&quot; in reference to the pale semiprecious gemstone beryl. The original source is probably the [[Sanskrit]] word à¤µà¥à¤¡à¥à¤°à¥à¤¯ vaidurya-, which is of [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] origin and could be derived from the name of the modern city of [[Belur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|beryl}}&lt;/ref&gt; For about 160 years, beryllium was also known as {{anchor|Glucinium}} '''glucinum''' or '''glucinium''' (with the accompanying chemical symbol &quot;'''Gl'''&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Black, The MacMillian Company, New York, 1937&lt;/ref&gt;), the name coming from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word for sweet: Î³Î»ÏÎºÏÏ, due to the sweet taste of beryllium [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]].

==Applications==
It is estimated that most beryllium is used for military applications, so information is not readily available.&lt;ref&gt;Petzow, GÃ¼nter ''et al.'' &quot;Beryllium and Beryllium Compounds&quot; in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a04_011.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation windows===
[[File:Beryllium target.jpg|thumb|left|Beryllium target which &quot;converts&quot; a proton beam into a neutron beam]]
[[File:Be foil square.jpg|thumb|right|A square beryllium foil mounted in a steel case to be used as a window between a vacuum chamber and an [[X-ray microscope]]. Beryllium is highly transparent to X-rays owing to its low [[atomic number]].]]
Because of its low atomic number and very low absorption for X-rays, the oldest and still one of the most important applications of beryllium is in radiation windows for X-ray tubes. Extreme demands are placed on purity and cleanliness of beryllium to avoid artifacts in the X-ray images. Thin beryllium foils are used as radiation windows for X-ray detectors, and the extremely low absorption minimizes the heating effects caused by high intensity, low energy X-rays typical of [[synchrotron]] radiation. Vacuum-tight windows and beam-tubes for radiation experiments on synchrotrons are manufactured exclusively from beryllium. In scientific setups for various X-ray emission studies (e.g., [[energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy]]) the sample holder is usually made of beryllium because its emitted X-rays have much lower energies (~100 eV) than X-rays from most studied materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

Low [[atomic number]] also makes beryllium relatively transparent to energetic [[Elementary particle|particles]]. Therefore it is used to build the [[beamline|beam pipe]] around the collision region in [[particle physics]] setups, such as all four main detector experiments at the [[Large Hadron Collider]] ([[A Large Ion Collider Experiment|ALICE]], [[ATLAS experiment|ATLAS]], [[Compact Muon Solenoid|CMS]], [[LHCb]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Installation and commissioning of vacuum systems for the LHC particle detectors|publisher = CERN|first1 =R.|last1 = Veness|first2 =D.|last2 =Ramos|first3 =P.|last3 =Lepeule|first4 =A.|last4 = Rossi|first5 =G.|last5 =Schneider|first6 =S.|last6 =Blanchard|url = http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1199583/files/CERN-ATS-2009-005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Tevatron]] and the [[SLAC]]. The low density of beryllium allows collision products to reach the surrounding detectors without significant interaction, its stiffness allows a powerful vacuum to be produced within the pipe to minimize interaction with gases, its thermal stability allows it to function correctly at temperatures of only a few degrees above [[absolute zero]], and its [[diamagnetic]] nature keeps it from interfering with the complex multipole magnet systems used to steer and [[strong focusing|focus]] the [[particle beam]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(01)01149-4|title=A new inner vertex detector for STAR|year=2001|author=Wieman, H|journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section a Accelerators Spectrometers Detectors and Associated Equipment|volume=473|pages=205|bibcode = 2001NIMPA.473..205W }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical applications===
Because of its stiffness, light weight and dimensional stability over a wide temperature range, beryllium metal is used for lightweight structural components in the defense and [[aerospace]] industries in high-speed [[aircraft]], [[missile]]s, [[space vehicle]]s and [[communication satellite]]s. Several [[liquid-fuel rocket]]s use [[rocket engine nozzle|nozzles]] of pure beryllium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = http://books.google.com/?id=IpEnvBtSfPQC&amp;pg=PA690| title = Metals handbook|chapter = Beryllium|first = Joseph R.|last = Davis|publisher = ASM International|year = 1998|isbn = 9780871706546|pages = 690â691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=6fdmMuj0rNEC&amp;pg=PA62|page=62|title=Encyclopedia of materials, parts, and finishes|author=Schwartz, Mel M. |publisher=CRC Press|year=2002|isbn=1566766613}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A small number of [[bicycle frame]]s were built with beryllium, at &quot;astonishing&quot; prices.&lt;ref name=museum&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mombat.org/American.htm | title = Museum of Mountain Bike Art &amp; Technology: American Bicycle Manufacturing}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Beryllium is used as an [[alloy]]ing agent in the production of [[beryllium copper]], which contains up to 2.5% beryllium. Beryllium-copper alloys are used in many applications because of their combination of high [[electrical conductivity|electrical]] and [[thermal conductivity]], high strength and [[hardness (materials science)|hardness]], nonmagnetic properties, along with good [[corrosion]] and [[fatigue (material)|fatigue]] resistance. These applications include the making of [[spot welding]] electrodes, [[Spring (device)|springs]], non-sparking tools and [[electrical contact]]s.

[[File:Beryllium Copper Adjustable Wrench.jpg|thumb|alt=Alt text|Beryllium Copper Adjustable Wrench]]

The excellent elastic rigidity of beryllium has led to its extensive use in precision instrumentation, e.g. in [[gyroscope]] [[inertial guidance]] systems and in support structures for optical systems.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt; Beryllium-copper alloys were also applied as a hardening agent in [[Jason pistol]]s, which were used to strip paint from the hulls of ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=1 February 2005|accessdate=2009-08-08|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Defence-forces-face-rare-toxic-metal-exposure-risk/2005/02/01/1107228681666.html|title=Defence forces face rare toxic metal exposure risk|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An earlier major application of beryllium was in [[brake]]s for military aircraft because of its hardness, high melting point and exceptional [[heat dissipation]]. Environmental considerations have led to substitution by other materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

To reduce cost, beryllium may be fabricated with large amounts of [[aluminium]], resulting in [[AlBeMet]] (trade name).  This blend is cheaper, while still retaining many desirable properties.

===Mirrors===
Beryllium [[mirror]]s are of particular interest. Large-area mirrors, frequently with a [[honeycomb mirror|honeycomb support structure]], are used, for example, in [[meteorological satellite]]s where low weight and long-term dimensional stability are critical. Smaller beryllium mirrors are used in [[control system|optical guidance]] systems and in [[fire-control system]]s, e.g. in the German-made [[Leopard 1]] and [[Leopard 2]] [[main battle tank]]s. In these systems, very rapid movement of the mirror is required which again dictates low mass and high rigidity. Usually the beryllium mirror is coated with hard [[electroless nickel plating]] which can be more easily polished to a finer optical finish than beryllium. In some applications, though, the beryllium blank is polished without any coating. This is particularly applicable to [[cryogenic]] operation where thermal expansion mismatch can cause the coating to buckle.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

The [[James Webb Space Telescope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html|title = Beryllium related details from NASA|accessdate = 2008-09-18|publisher =NASA |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080529052057/http://www.jwst.nasa.gov/mirror.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; will have 18 hexagonal beryllium sections for its mirrors. Because JWST will face a temperature of 33 K, the mirror is made of beryllium, capable of handling extreme cold better than glass. Beryllium contracts and deforms less than glass â and remains more uniform â in such temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The James Webb Space Telescope|first = Jonathan P.|last = Gardner|year = 2007|journal = Poceedings of Science|url = http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/052/005/MRU_005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the same reason, the optics of the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]] are entirely built of beryllium metal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Spitzer Space Telescope Mission|first = M.

===Magnetic applications===
Beryllium is non-magnetic. Therefore, tools fabricated out of beryllium are used by naval or military [[explosive ordnance disposal]] teams for work on or near [[naval mine]]s, since these mines commonly have [[fuze|magnetic fuze]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=AD0263919|title=The selection of low-magnetic alloys for EOD tools|publisher= Naval Weapons Plant Washington DC|author= Kojola, Kenneth ; Lurie, William|date=9 August 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also found in maintenance and construction materials near [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI) machines because of the high magnetic fields generated by them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=EqtlqFNkWwQC&amp;pg=PT891|page=891|title=Understanding anesthesia equipment|author=Dorsch, Jerry A. and Dorsch, Susan E.|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|year=2007|isbn=0781776031}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fields of [[radio communication]]s and powerful (usually military) [[radar]]s, hand tools made of beryllium are used to tune the highly magnetic [[klystron]]s, [[magnetron]]s, [[traveling wave tube]]s, etc., that are used for generating high levels of [[microwave]] power in the [[transmitter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=MobileReference|title=Electronics Quick Study Guide for Smartphones and Mobile Devices|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=AG6H633VIAcC&amp;pg=PT2396|accessdate=22 April 2011|date=1 January 2007|publisher=MobileReference|isbn=9781605011004|pages=2396â}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nuclear applications===
Thin plates or foils of beryllium are sometimes used in [[nuclear weapon design]]s as the very outer layer of the [[plutonium pit]]s in the primary stages of [[thermonuclear bomb]]s, placed to surround the [[fissile]] material. These layers of beryllium are good &quot;pushers&quot; for the [[implosion (mechanical process)|implosion]] of the [[plutonium-239]], and they are also good [[neutron reflector]]s, just as they are in beryllium-moderated [[nuclear reactors]].&lt;ref name=weapons/&gt;

Beryllium is also commonly used as a [[neutron source]] in laboratory experiments in which relatively few neutrons are needed (rather than having to use a nuclear reactor). For this purpose, a target of beryllium-9 is bombarded with energetic alpha particles from a [[radio-isotope]] such as [[polonium]]-210, [[radium]]-226, [[plutonium]]-239, or [[americium]]-241. In the nuclear reaction that occurs, a beryllium nucleus are [[Nuclear transmutation|transmuted]] into carbon-12, and one free neutron is emitted, traveling in about the same direction as the alpha particle was heading. Such neutron sources, named [[Modulated neutron initiator|&quot;urchin&quot;]] neutron initiators, were used some in early [[atomic bomb]]s.&lt;ref name=weapons&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA35|page=35|title=How nuclear weapons spread|author=Barnaby, Frank |publisher=Routledge|year=1993|isbn=0415076749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beryllium is also used at the [[Joint European Torus]] [[nuclear fusion|nuclear-fusion research laboratory]], and it will be used in the more advanced [[ITER]] to condition the components which face the plasma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=9ngHTkC8hG8C&amp;pg=PA15|page=15|title=Nuclear fusion research|author=Clark, R. E.

===Acoustics===
Low weight and high rigidity of beryllium make it useful as a material for high-frequency [[speaker driver]]s. Because beryllium is expensive (many times more than [[titanium]]), hard to shape due to its brittleness, and toxic if mishandled, beryllium [[tweeter]]s are limited to high-end home, [[pro audio]] and [[public address]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/speaker-product-reviews/speakers/usher-be-718-bookshelf-speakers-with-beryllium-tweeters.html|first = John E.|last = Johnson, Jr.|date = 2007-11-12|accessdate = 2008-09-18|title = Usher Be-718 Bookshelf Speakers with Beryllium Tweeters}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.focalprofessional.com/en/technologies/index.php#tabs-2|accessdate = 2010-07-10|title = Beryllium use in pro audio Focal speakers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.krksys.com/product_expose.php |publisher = KRK Systems|accessdate = 2009-02-12|title = ExposÃ© E8B studio monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; More often, beryllium is [[alloy]]ed with other metals, which is sometimes not disclosed for marketing purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.electrofusionproducts.com/userfiles/China_Be_Domes_Report.pdf|first = Mark|last = Svilar|date = 2004-01-08|accessdate = 2009-02-13|title = Analysis of &quot;Beryllium&quot; Speaker Dome and Cone Obtained from China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electronic===
Beryllium is a [[p-type semiconductor|p-type]] [[dopant]] in [[List of semiconductor materials|III-V compound semiconductors]]. It is widely used in materials such as [[gallium arsenide|GaAs]], [[AlGaAs]], [[InGaAs]] and [[InAlAs]] grown by [[molecular beam epitaxy]] (MBE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=oJs6nK3TZrwC&amp;pg=PA104|page=104|title=High-power diode lasers|author=Diehl, Roland |publisher=Springer|year=2000|isbn=3540666931}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross-rolled beryllium sheet is an excellent structural support for [[printed circuit board]]s in [[surface-mount technology]]. In critical electronic applications, beryllium is both a structural support and [[heat sink]]. The application also requires a coefficient of [[thermal expansion]] that is well matched to the [[alumina]] and [[glass-reinforced plastic|polyimide-glass]] [[Substrate (materials science)|substrate]]s. The beryllium-beryllium oxide [[metal matrix composite|composite]] &quot;[[E-Material]]s&quot; have been specially designed for these electronic applications and have the additional advantage that the thermal expansion coefficient can be tailored to match diverse substrate materials.&lt;ref name=Be/&gt;

[[Beryllium oxide]] is useful for many applications that require the combined properties of an [[electrical insulator]] and an excellent heat conductor, with high strength and hardness, and a very high melting point. Beryllium oxide is frequently used as an insulator base plate in [[power semiconductor device|high-power]] [[transistor]]s in [[radio frequency]] [[transmitter]]s for [[telecommunication]]s. Beryllium oxide is also being studied for use in increasing the [[thermal conductivity]] of [[uranium dioxide]] [[nuclear fuel]] pellets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Complexes===
{{Main|Beryllium coordination chemistry}}
Beryllium(II) readily forms complexes with strong donating ligands such as phosphine oxides and arsine oxides.
There have been extensive studies of these complexes which show the stability of the O-Be bond.{{fact|date=September 2011}}

==Toxicity==
{{Main|Beryllium poisoning}}
The toxicity of beryllium depends upon the duration, intensity and frequency of exposure (features of dose), as well as the form of beryllium and the route of exposure (e.g., inhalation, dermal, ingestion). According to the [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] (IARC), beryllium and beryllium compounds are [[List of IARC Group 1 carcinogens|Category 1 carcinogens]]; they are carcinogenic to animals (including humans).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url =http://www.inchem.org/documents/iarc/vol58/mono58-1.html|publisher = International Agency for Research on Cancer|title = IARC Monograph, Volume 58|year = 1993|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic [[berylliosis]] is a [[pulmonary]] and [[systemic circulation|systemic]] [[granuloma]]tous disease caused by exposure to beryllium. Acute beryllium disease in the form of [[chemical pneumonitis]] was first reported in Europe in 1933 and in the United States in 1943. Cases of chronic berylliosis were first described in 1946 among workers in plants manufacturing [[fluorescent lamp]]s in [[Massachusetts]]. Chronic berylliosis resembles [[sarcoidosis]] in many respects, and the [[differential diagnosis]] is often difficult. It killed some early workers in nuclear weapons design, such as [[Herbert L. Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.atomicarchive.com/Photos/CP1/image5.shtml|title = Photograph of Chicago Pile One Scientists 1946|date = 2006-06-19|publisher = Office of Public Affairs, Argonne National Laboratory|accessdate = 2008-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early researchers tasted beryllium and its various compounds for sweetness in order to verify its presence. Modern diagnostic equipment no longer necessitates this highly risky procedure and no attempt should be made to ingest this highly toxic substance. Beryllium and its compounds should be handled with great care and special precautions must be taken when carrying out any activity which could result in the release of beryllium dust ([[lung cancer]] is a possible result of prolonged exposure to beryllium laden dust). Although the use of beryllium compounds in [[fluorescent light]]ing tubes was discontinued in 1949, potential for exposure to beryllium exists in the nuclear and aerospace industries and in the refining of beryllium metal and melting of beryllium-containing alloys, the manufacturing of electronic devices, and the handling of other beryllium-containing material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/ehc/ehc/ehc106.htm |title=Berrylium: ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH CRITERIA 106 |author=International Programme On Chemical Safety |year= 1990 |work= |publisher=World Health Organization |accessdate=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful test for beryllium in air and on surfaces has been recently developed and published as an international voluntary consensus standard ASTM D7202. The procedure uses dilute [[ammonium bifluoride]] for dissolution and fluorescence detection with beryllium bound to sulfonated hydroxybenzoquinoline, allowing up to 100 times more sensitive detection than the recommended limit for beryllium concentration in the workplace. Fluorescence increases with increasing beryllium concentration. The new procedure has been successfully tested on a variety of surfaces and is effective for the dissolution and ultratrace detection of refractory beryllium oxide and siliceous beryllium (ASTM D7458).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.astm.org/Standards/D7458.htm|title=ASTM D7458&amp;nbsp;â08|accessdate=2009-08-08|publisher=American Society for Testing and Materials}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1520/JAI13168|title=Development of a New Fluorescence Method for the Detection of Beryllium on Surfaces|year=2005|last1=Minogue|first1 =EM|last2=Ehler|first2=DS|last3=Burrell|first3=AK|last4= McCleskey|first4=TM|last5=Taylor|first5=TP|journal=Journal of ASTM International|volume=2|pages=13168|issue=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
