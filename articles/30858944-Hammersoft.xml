The '''2011 Grand National''' (known as the [[John Smith's Brewery|John Smith's]] Grand National for sponsorship reasons) was the 164th renewal of the world-famous [[Grand National]] [[Horse racing|horse race]] held at [[Aintree Racecourse]] near [[Liverpool]], [[England]].

The showpiece [[steeplechase]] began at 4:15&amp;nbsp;pm [[British Summer Time|BST]] on 9 April 2011, the final day of the three-day annual meeting. The maximum permitted field of forty runners competed for prize money totalling a record [[Pound sterling|Â£]]950,000, making it the highest valued [[National Hunt racing|National Hunt race]] in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Order of running | publisher = Aintree Racecourse | url = http://www.aintree.co.uk/pages/order-of-running/ | accessdate = 9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen of the forty participants completed the 4Â½-mile course; two of the twenty-one who did not suffered fatal falls on the first circuit, reigniting debates over the safety of the event. Irish horse [[Ballabriggs]] won the race, securing the first-place prize money of Â£535,135 and a first Grand National win for [[Horse trainer|trainer]] [[Donald McCain, Jr.]], the son of four-time winning trainer [[Ginger McCain]]. Owned by [[Trevor Hemmings]], Ballabriggs was ridden by Irish [[jockey]] [[Jason Maguire]] and was sent off at odds of 14/1.&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news | title = Ballabriggs powers to National win | publisher = BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/9451559.stm | accessdate = 9 April 2011 | first=Frank | last=Keogh | date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pairing completed the race in 9 minutes 1.2 seconds, the second-fastest time in Grand National history.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news | title = Emotions run high at Aintree, but thrilling race is marred by death of two horses | publisher = The Telegraph | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/8440759/Grand-National-2011-emotions-run-high-at-Aintree-but-thrilling-race-is-marred-by-death-of-two-horses.html | accessdate = 9 April 2011 | location=London | first=Jonathan | last=Liew | date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Race card ==
On 2 February 2011 Aintree released the names of 102 horses submitted to enter, including 34 [[Republic of Ireland|Irish]]-trained and three [[France|French]]-trained horses. Ten were trained by [[Paul Nicholls (horse racing)|Paul Nicholls]], including a leading contender in Niche Market; nine were handled by Irish trainer [[Willie Mullins]], and three by [[Jonjo O'Neill]], the trainer of last year's winner. Ballabriggs, another leading contender, was trained by [[Donald McCain, Jr.]], the son of [[Ginger McCain]] who trained [[Red Rum]] to three National victories in the 1970s and returned with another winner, [[Amberleigh House]], in [[2004 Grand National|2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = February list of 102 entries | publisher = Aintree Racecourse | url = http://www.aintree.co.uk/news/102-entries-for-the-2011-john-smiths-grand-national/ | accessdate = 2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

20 contenders were withdrawn in the first scratchings. After a second scratchings deadline on 24 March, 74 horses remained on the list of entrants, with the top weight handicap of 11 [[Stone (Imperial mass)|st]] 10 [[Pound (mass)|lb]] allocated to last year's winner [[Don't Push It]]. The official odds on 24 March placed Mullins-trained The Midnight Club at 10/1 favourite. Backstage and Oscar Time were given joint-second favourite odds of 12/1.&lt;ref name=still-in-it&gt;{{cite news | title = 74 still on target for Grand National | publisher = Aintree Racecourse | url = http://www.aintree.co.uk/news/74-still-on-target-for-grand-national/ | accessdate = 24 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the five-day deadline on 4 April, nine further withdrawals since the second scratchings left a total of 65 contenders still in the running to compete. Nina Carberry, the sister of [[1999 Grand National|1999]] winner [[Paul Carberry]], became the first female jockey to take a third ride in the Grand National. Four amateur jockeys lined up to compete. Official odds on favourite The Midnight Club were cut to 8/1, while What A Friend replaced Oscar Time as a joint-second favourite with Backstage on odds of 11/1.&lt;ref name=fivedays&gt;{{cite news | title = 65 aiming for Grand National glory | publisher = Aintree Racecourse | url = http://www.aintree.co.uk/news/65_aiming_for_john_smiths_grand_national_glory/ | accessdate = 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 April, Aintree declared the final confirmed list of 40 runners and four reserves as follows. The reserves would replace any withdrawals prior to 9 am on 8 April.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Field declared for 2011 Aintree race | publisher = BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/9445742.stm#entries | accessdate = 7 April 2011 | date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the reserves, however, were required.

==Finishing order==
Ten-year-old [[Ballabriggs]] led for much of the race, and the gelding eventually saw off a strong run-in challenge from amateur jockey [[Sam Waley-Cohen]] on Oscar Time who secured second place. Third was [[2010 Grand National|2010]] winner [[Tony McCoy]] on [[Don't Push It]], twelve lengths behind the second. 15/2 favourite The Midnight Club made a mistake at the third fence and finished sixth.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;

State of Play, the eleven-year-old 28/1 shot trained by Welshman Evan Williams, finished in the top four for the third successive National.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Evan Williams praise for State of Play | publisher = BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/horse_racing/13026660.stm | accessdate = 9 April 2011 | date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nineteen runners completed the course, including three of the six 100/1 shots. This was the highest number of finishers since [[2005 Grand National|2005]] when twenty-one horses passed the finishing post.

Ten horses fell during the race, four unseated their riders, two were brought down by other fallers and five were pulled up.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

100/1 outsider Santa's Son had led the field over the [[Canal Turn]], but the short-distance runner eventually fell out of contention and jockey [[Jamie Moore (jockey)|Jamie Moore]] pulled him up before the 27th fence. Killyglen fell at the 27th, having been close to leader Ballabriggs at the beginning of the second circuit.&lt;ref name=bbclive&gt;{{cite news | title = The race as it happened | publisher = BBC Sport | url =

Ornais and Dooneys Gate both suffered fatal falls on the first circuit, the former at fence four (a plain, 4 ft 10 in obstacle) and the latter at fence six (the 5 ft [[Becher's Brook]]). According to one animal rights group, this brought to 20 the total number of equine deaths at all Aintree meetings since 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Two horses killed at Aintree | publisher = Animal Aid | url = http://www.animalaid.org.uk/h/n/NEWS/news_horse//2460// | accessdate = 9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aintree had made significant modifications to its ''National Course'' in recent years, including improving veterinary facilities and reducing the severity of some fences, but another notable change was highlighted in this race â that the course has been widened to allow more fences to be bypassed if necessary. As the remaining contenders on the second circuit approached the 20th fence, arrowed signposts and marshals waving chequered flags signalled them to bypass on the outside as Ornais' body was covered on the landing side. Two jumps later and they were again diverted, this time around the famous Becher's Brook, where veterinary staff attended to the fatally-injured Dooneys Gate.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; This was the first time since the modern course was finalised in the 1880s that only 28 fences had been jumped.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt;

==Broadcasting==
The Grand National has the status of being an event of significant national interest within the United Kingdom and thus is listed on the [[Ofcom Code on Sports and Other Listed and Designated Events]]. The race therefore must be covered live on free-to-air [[terrestrial television]] in the UK. The [[BBC]] aired the race on radio for the 80th consecutive year and on television for the 52nd year.

Ballabriggs with a hundred yards left to go, he's three lengths in front, he's going to outstay them I reckon. He's drifting towards the outside, but he's done enough to win. Ballabriggs and Donald McCain, its the McCain family back with another National. Ballabriggs, Jason Maguire the winner!'''

[[Clare Balding]] presented the BBC's television coverage, supported by Rishi Persad and retired jockey [[Richard Pitman]], which was broadcast on [[BBC One]] and, for the second year, [[BBC HD]]. Former National-winning jockeys [[Richard Dunwoody]] and [[Mick Fitzgerald]] provided expert analysis, while betting news was provided by Gary Wiltshire and [[John Parrott]]. [[Suzi Perry]] was due to be providing soundbites from spectators but did not take part in the programme. Her place was taken by last-minute replacement [[Dan Walker]] who had been at Aintree to present ''[[Football Focus]]'', aired prior to the National.

The race commentary team was led by [[Jim McGrath (Australian commentator)|Jim McGrath]], who called the winner home for the 14th consecutive year; he was supported by [[Ian Bartlett]] and [[Darren Owen]].&lt;ref name=broadcast&gt;{{cite news | title = BBC racing coverage | publisher = BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/4552838.stm | accessdate = 9 April 2011 | date=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as being streamed to UK viewers on [[BBC Online]], [[BBC Radio 5 Live]] also aired the race, presented by [[Mark Chapman (broadcaster)|Mark Chapman]].&lt;ref name=broadcast/&gt;

The BBC later received some criticism for failing to mention the deaths of Ornais and Dooneys Gate until the end of its broadcast.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; A spokesman later said: &quot;During the race and the re-run [the fatalities were] covered with as much sensitivity as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Aintree day of horror as TV audience of millions see two horses die at the National | publisher = Daily Mail | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/racing/article-1375310/Aintree-day-horror-TV-audience-millions-horses-die-National.html?ito=feeds-newsxml | accessdate = 10 April 2011 | location=London | first=Stephen | last=Davies | date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
Selected quotes of participating jockeys speaking after the race:&lt;ref name=order/&gt;

}}
*'''[[Jason Maguire]]''' ([[Ballabriggs]], 1st): &quot;He loved it... I got him to the front to get him relaxed and put breathers into him and that helped him get the trip.&quot;

*'''[[Sam Waley-Cohen]]''' (Oscar Time, 2nd): &quot;The plan was always to come with one smooth run. We knew he had a huge jump in him so I was just trying to get him to pop a little bit and save and not get too keen. He did everything I asked of him.&quot;

*'''[[Tony McCoy]]''' ([[Don't Push It]], 3rd): &quot;He ran a great race and all credit to the horse. He was off the bridle a little bit early and he got a little bit low at a couple of fences late on which was energy-sapping.&quot; 

*'''Paul Moloney''' (State of Play, 4th): &quot;He's an incredible horse - he's just a little bit slower this year because time is catching up with him. He couldn't lay up with the pace and the ground was probably a little slower than ideal, but he's a fabulous horse.&quot;

*'''Harry Skelton''' (Niche Market, 5th): &quot;He ran an absolute blinder and has given me a tremendous ride.&quot;

*'''Denis O'Regan''' (King Fontaine, 11th): &quot;My horse ran a blinder. I was a bit slow earlier and nearly got brought down. He jumped like a buck. He's only a novice and will be an ideal spin next year.&quot;

*'''Andrew McNamara''' (Bluesea Cracker, 14th): &quot;The ground was a bit quick for her.&quot;

*'''Nina Carberry''' (Character Building, 15th): &quot;I was nearly brought down at [[Becher's Brook|Becher's]] and that was his race over.&quot;

*'''Hadden Frost''' (Calgary Bay, fell at the 4th fence): &quot;He jumped the fence fine, but landed a bit steep, which any horse could do. We were just behind Ballabriggs at the time so we were in the right place. Maybe we'll come back and try again.&quot; 

*'''Robbie McNamara''' (Majestic Concorde, unseated rider at 24th): &quot;We were too keen early. I was just starting to get him switched off when we came into the [[Canal Turn]] and got in too close and tipped up.&quot;

*'''[[Timmy Murphy]]''' ([[Comply or Die]], pulled up before 28th): &quot;I would say that's his last race. He got very tired and he's not getting any younger, but he's a special horse to me and it's nice to think he's ended up at the course where we achieved our finest hour.&quot;

==Aftermath==
The unusually warm and sunny weather conditions were credited with helping the 2011 meeting set a Grand National attendance record. A crowd of 70,291 people attended the main Saturday race day, and a total of 153,583 attended over the course of the three-day meeting, beating the previous record of 151,660 set in [[2005 Grand National|2005]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Aintree 2011 set new records for Liverpool course | publisher = Click Liverpool | url = http://www.clickliverpool.com/sport/other-sport/1213039-aintree-2011-set-new-records-for-liverpool-course.html | accessdate = 14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Grand National is always a major event for bookmakers, particularly in the United Kingdom. An estimated Â£300 million in bets were estimated to be struck on the 2011 race,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Why the Grand National sees Welsh women bet as much as men | publisher = Wales Online | url = http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/2011/04/09/why-the-grand-national-sees-welsh-women-bet-as-much-as-men-91466-28488657/ | accessdate = 9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some from as far afield as Australia, Bermuda and Kazakhstan, with British troops in Afghanistan also joining in. It is estimated that nearly half of the adult population of the UK bets on the Grand National.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Grand National punters stake Â£300m | publisher = Daily Finance | url = http://www.dailyfinance.co.uk/2011/04/08/grand-national-punters-stake-300m/ | accessdate = 8 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ballabriggs cropped.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ballabriggs]], pictured two weeks after his Grand National win.]]
The race received a significant amount of negative media coverage over the two equine fatalities, which were more publicly noticeable than in prior Nationals due to two fences being bypassed for the first time. Those watching the race on television were given clear views of the tarpaulin-covered body of Ornais and of veterinary staff attending to the fatally-injured Dooneys Gate while the runners diverted around them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Horse racing industry must respond to anti-Grand National agenda | publisher = The Telegraph | url = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/horseracing/8457360/Horse-racing-industry-must-respond-to-anti-Grand-National-agenda.html | accessdate = 17 April 2011 | location=London | first=Charlie | last=Brooks | date=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mccoy&gt;{{cite news | title = Jockey Tony McCoy defends Grand National at Aintree | publisher = BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/horse_racing/13079492.stm | accessdate = 14 April 2011 | date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andrew Taylor, director of the animal rights group [[Animal Aid]], called for an outright ban of the Grand National, saying: &quot;It's a deliberately hazardous, challenging and predictably lethal event.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Calls grow to ban Grand National | publisher = MSN | url = http://news.uk.msn.com/uk/articles.aspx?cp-documentid=156960331 | accessdate = 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals|RSPCA]]'s equine consultant David Muir stated: &quot;I was gutted that two horses died... What I will do now is go back and have a look at each element, with the BHA and the racecourse management, to see if the jump contributed to what happened, look at the take-off and landing side and so on, and see if the evidence suggests something can be done about it. I'm trying to make the race better, safer where I can, but the one thing I can never do is eliminate risk: that's always going to be there.&quot; Muir did however add: &quot;There's no way I'm going to get the National banned.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Grand National deaths prompt RSPCA involvement in Aintree review | publisher = Guardian | url =

Aintree's managing director Julian Thick said: &quot;We are desperately sad at the accidents during the running of the Grand National today and our thoughts go out to the connections of Ornais and Dooneys Gate... Only the best horses and the best jockeys are allowed to enter and all horses are inspected by the vet when they arrive at Aintree to ensure that they are fit to race. This year we had 20 horse catchers, at least two fence attendants at each of the 16 fences, four stewards to inspect the course, two [[British Horseracing Authority|BHA]] course inspectors, ten vets, 50 ground staff and 35 ground repair staff... We work closely with animal welfare organisations, such as the RSPCA and [[World Horse Welfare]], to make sure we are up to date with the latest thinking and research... and to make sure that the horses are looked after properly and that the race is run as safely as possible.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Grand National result and round up | publisher = Aintree Racecourse | url = http://www.aintree.co.uk/news/grand-national-result-and-round-up/ | accessdate = 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Veteran trainer [[Ginger McCain]] queried the suggestion of reducing the size of the fences in the aftermath of the race. McCain said: &quot;You don't make things better by making it easier. Its speed that does the damage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Ginger McCain queries smaller fences  | publisher = BBC Sport | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/horse_racing/9453497.stm | accessdate = 10 April 2011 | date=10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Champion jockey [[Tony McCoy]] also defended the National, saying, &quot;I personally don't think the sport could be in any better shape for horses or jockeys.&quot;&lt;ref name=mccoy/&gt; Ornais's owner, Andy Stewart, later said: &quot;We're still grieving but I think this whole hyped up situation regarding the Grand National is totally wrong... National Hunt racing is safer and compliant with every single sport that goes along. My son snowboarded in France and, unfortunately, he had an accident and he'll never walk again. Why don't we just get on with it and enjoy the sport?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Stewart leaps to National defence | publisher = Press Association | url = http://www.google.com/hostednews/ukpress/article/ALeqM5iMfdkmAg9GkjD94FYIXmiD4TSVwQ?docId=N0508021302451841757A | accessdate = 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winning jockey Jason Maguire was handed a five-day ban by the stewards for excessive use of the whip on Ballabriggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jason Maguire and Ballabriggs battle way to glory at Aintree | publisher = The Telegraph | url =
