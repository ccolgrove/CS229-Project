==Economy==
{{Wide image|From across the Hills.jpg|840px|View of the City of Industry}}
The city's [[zoning]] is primarily devoted to business: 92% is [[industry|Industrial]], 8% is [[Commerce|Commercial]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofindustry.org/dex_14.html Official City of Industry Website: Industry Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The few residences in the city either existed before incorporation, are on properties adjacent to either Industry Hills Golf Club, Industry Hills Recreation Center or in a small neighborhood adjacent to City Hall.

The City of Industry has no business taxes and is primarily funded through retail [[sales tax]] from shopping centers located within the city limits, and [[property tax]] on parcels within the City.  The city has the highest property tax rate in Los Angeles County, at 1.92%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/bell/la-me-city-property-tax-table,0,5895218.htmlstory | work=Los Angeles Times | title=Paying too much?

County cities}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there is a revenue-generating hillside hotel resort, known as the [[Pacific Palms Resort]] (formerly the Industry Hills [[Sheraton Hotels and Resorts|Sheraton]]), which is almost completely surrounded by the city of [[La Puente, California|La Puente]] but actually located in the City of Industry.

City of Industry is a popular investment area for [[China|Chinese]] businessmen and the city has also emerged as a high-tech import/export center for computer parts, with business links to the Asian marketplace.  For convenience many Chinese entrepreneurs and staff live in nearby [[Rowland Heights, California|Rowland Heights]], [[Hacienda Heights, California|Hacienda Heights]], [[West Covina, California|West Covina]], [[Diamond Bar, California|Diamond Bar]] and [[Walnut, California|Walnut]]. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

A former [[IKEA]] store located north of the Puente Hills Mall and across the [[60 Freeway]] was used as a shooting location for the final fight scene in ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (2005 film)|Mr. &amp; Mrs Smith]]''. Its exterior was renovated so it could be used for both exterior and interior filming; it was later demolished.

Industry also features a [[McDonald's]] restaurant that is used strictly for filming movies and commercials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadsideamerica.com/tips/getAttraction.php3?tip_AttractionNo==2293 City of Industry, California - Fake TV McDonald's]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Industry is Vineland Drive-In, one of only two operating [[drive-in theater]]s in Los Angeles and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]].
