'''Ted Williams''' (born September 22, 1957) is an American [[voice acting|voice-over artist]] from [[Columbus, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Jan 7, 2011 02:33AM |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/nation/3193489-418/williams-voice-columbus-kraft-commercials.html |archiveurl =http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9FzKOI |title=Chicago-Sun Times |publisher=Suntimes.com |archivedate = 2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams gained widespread [[15 minutes of fame|media attention]] when an interview â made during a period when he was [[Homelessness|homeless]] â went [[viral video|viral]] after being posted to [[YouTube]] in early January 2011. Williams has since received numerous offers â including jobs â and has also encountered difficulties, both with the media and his own sobriety. 

==Background==
Williams was born and raised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, New York&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evshzFGrO-Y |title=Ted Williams' Mom on His Sudden Fame |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams served three years in the [[United States Army]], was [[honorably discharged]], and attended school for [[voice acting]].&lt;ref&gt;WNCI 97.9 Radio Interview&lt;/ref&gt; His inspiration to become a radio announcer came from a field trip at age 14, when he found that a radio announcer who he had heard looked nothing like he had imagined.  Williams later worked overnight shifts for [[WVKO (AM)]] in Columbus when the station played [[soul music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ohio Homeless Man Earns Second Chance With 'Golden Radio Voice' |url=http://www.rtdna.org/pages/posts/ohio-homeless-man-earns-second-chance-with-golden-radio-voice1193.php|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9KD4p9 |publisher=Radio Television Digital News Association |date=2011-01-05|archivedate = 2011-02-03 |quote=Williams had previously worked overnight shifts at WVKO (1580 AM), a former Columbus soul music station which now offers Catholic programming, according to Mail Online. |accessdate=2011-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Williams, his life started falling apart in 1986 with a combination of drug and alcohol abuse plus a loss of interest in his career. During this period Williams was arrested at least seven times on charges including theft, drug possession, escape, and robbery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lloyd|first=Jason|title=Cavs hire homeless man despite record|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/cavs-hire-homeless-man-despite-record/story-fn6e0tx4-1225983025955|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=The Daily Telegraph|date=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Williams' Arrest Photos|url=http://www.10tv.com/live/foundation/slideshow.jsp?file=/local/stories/2011/01/07/slideshow_tedwilliamsmugshots.html&amp;image=1&amp;adsec=&amp;tot=7&amp;sid=102|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=[[WBNS-TV]]|date=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also issued [[misdemeanor]] citations for drug abuse, criminal trespassing, and pedestrian [[solicitation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dispatch5jan11&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Joy|first=Kevin|author2=Amy Saunders|title=Media frenzy overwhelms Columbus' 'golden voice'|url=http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/01/05/05-homeless-dj-update.html|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=The Columbus Dispatch|date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These resulted in two prison sentences, with Williams serving three months in 1990 for theft and nearly two months in 2004 for theft, forgery and obstructing official business.&lt;ref name=&quot;dispatch5jan11&quot;/&gt; He is a father to nine children: seven girls and two boys.&lt;ref name=today/&gt;

==Recognition and response==
{{Wikinews|Homeless Columbus, Ohio man with 'god-given gift of voice' becomes YouTube sensation}}
Doral Chenoweth, a [[Columbus, Ohio]] videographer for the ''[[Columbus Dispatch]]'', recorded an interview with Williams, and posted the interview on the newspaper's website on January 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title = Homeless man Ted Williams becomes viral video star in quest to be a radio announcer| author = Meena Hartenstein| date = January 4, 2011| url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/2011/01/04/2011-01-04_homeless_man_ted_williams_becomes_viral_video_star_in_quest_to_be_radio_announce.html|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9Nz0lQ|archivedate = 2011-02-03| location=New York| work=Daily News}}

In the recording, Chenoweth asked Williams to demonstrate his voice.  The video showed a disheveled Williams gratefully receiving a donation and improvising a startlingly accomplished radio station [[Promotion (marketing)|promo]].  The video concluded with a short interview where Williams elaborated on his education and the problems that led to his homelessness.&lt;ref&gt;'''Video location:''' Hudson Street (exit 112) [[off-ramp]] of [[Interstate 71]], Columbus Ohio: {{Coord|40.015063|-82.994941|display=inline}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The video was reposted to [[YouTube]]&lt;ref&gt;Rivas, Jorge (4 January 2011) [http://colorlines.com/archives/2011/01/ohio_man_with_a_golden_voice_tells_his_tale_of_unemployment_crisis.html &quot;Ohio Man With Golden Voice Tells His Tale of Jobless Crisis&quot;] ([http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9UwltQ Archive] as of 3 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vitale, Robert (8 January 2011) [http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/local_news/stories/2011/01/08/how-the-golden-voice-video-went-viral.html &quot;How the 'golden voice' video went viral&quot;] ([http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9YnlNb Archive] as of 3 February 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; where it received significant attention.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTysXITBCmk.

At the same time, Williams' story garnered attention on social news websites with users pledging money, clothes, and job offers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddit.com/r/reddit.com/comments/evz04/homeless_man_wgolden_radio_voice_in_columbus_oh/|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9dckm2 |title=Homeless man w/golden radio voice in Columbus, OH [VIDEO |publisher=reddit.com |archivedate = 2011-02-03 |accessdate=2011-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 5, 2011, Williams appeared on the &quot;Dave and Jimmy Show&quot; on [[WNCI]] and was interviewed by ''[[The Early Show]]'' on [[CBS]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs5&quot;&gt;Doane, Seth (5 January 2011).

He was interviewed on ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'', January 6, doing the lead-in voice over, revealing that he was to have an interview to do voice overs for [[Kraft Foods]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;Andre Mayer, &quot;[http://www.cbc.ca/arts/media/blogs/popculture/2011/01/ted-williams-voices-opening-to-today-show.html Ted Williams voices opening to Today Show]&quot;, ''CBC.ca'', January 6, 2011. ([http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9m0GvS Archive] as of February 3, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, a fundraiser website, TedWilliamsYourVoice, was set up to support the [[National Coalition for the Homeless]] and Williams.

Subsequently, Williams received several job offers.  On January 5, the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]] NBA basketball team offered him a job and a home. The offer calls for Williams to do full-time voiceover work with the Cavaliers and [[Quicken Loans Arena]]. Williams responded, &quot;Thatâs the best deal ever!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Cavs offer homeless man with golden voice a job and a house |author=Garrett Downing |url=http://www.newsnet5.com/dpp/news/local_news/cleveland_metro/cavs-offer-homeless-man-with-golden-voice-a-job-and-a-house|archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9ub1rt |newspaper=NewsChannel5 WEWS |date=5 January 2011|archivedate = 3 February 2011|accessdate=5 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On January 7, 2011, Williams was officially hired by [[MSNBC]] to provide voiceovers for the network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ted Williams Hired ! |author=TedWilliamsBlog |url=http://tedwilliamsblog.com/2011/01/ted-williams-hired-by-msnbc |archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5wE9y6UpP|archivedate = 3 February 2011|date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=7 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Williams was also hired to be the voice behind [[Kraft Foods]]' new TV campaign, which launched on [[ESPN]] during the [[2011 Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl (January)|2011 Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl]] on January 9.

Williams said he had remained sober since mid-2008, but started drinking again after the media attention. On January 12, 2011, after a lengthy one-on-one talk with TV psychologist [[Phil McGraw]], Williams admitted to drinking alcohol heavily again and agreed to go to a male-only [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehab facility]] in Texas arranged by Dr. Phil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Golden Voice Ted Williams Heads to Rehab|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/12/national/main7240390.shtml|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wEA1S6p9|date=12 January 2011|archivedate=3 February 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011|work=CBS News}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also committed to attend alcohol rehabilitation courses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Golden Voice' Ted Williams Headed to Rehab|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/ted-williams-golden-voice-enters-rehab-drinking/story?id=12602177 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wEA5sYFO |archivedate=3 February 2011|date=12 January 2011|accessdate=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Williams checked himself out of the rehab facility after 12 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Golden Voice' Ted Williams departs drug rehab|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/SHOWBIZ/celebrity.news.gossip/01/24/ted.williams.rehab/|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wEA9hv7T|date=2011-01-25|archivedate=2011-02-03|accessdate=2011-02-03|work=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, in February 2011, Williams, reflecting on why he had left the rehab facility, said to reporters that &quot;I love Dr. Phil. I don't want to bash him in any way. I walked out of treatment because it was a little scripted, I felt. There was no anonymity. I want him to know that his cares and his concerns will not be in vain. I am going to try and truly get back into the swing of things.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gicas, Peter, [http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b226940_Golden_Voiced_Ted_Williams__Fame_Came_Too_Quickly.html &quot;Golden-Voiced Ted Williams: Fame Came Too Quickly&quot;], ''[[E!

Also in February 2011, the reality show ''Second Chances at Life'' was announced to be in pre-production with Williams as host.  A second season is also being planned and, if produced, is slated to introduce new individuals who also deserve a second chance at life.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2011/02/22/ted-williams-godlen-voice-reality-show-second-chances-at-life-homeless-ohio/ &quot;'Golden Voice' Ted Williams Scores REALITY SHOW&quot;], ''[[TMZ.com|TMZ]]'', 2/22/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 9, 2011, Williams was interviewed again on ''Today'', where he thanked his voice over mentors, Randy Thomas and Joe Cipriano and reported he was doing well and living in a [[Halfway house|sober house]] in [[Studio City, Los Angeles|Studio City]], California.&lt;ref name=&quot;TODAY03092011&quot;&gt;Inbar, Michael, [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/41984899/ns/today-today_people/ &quot;âGolden-voicedâ man on relapse: âIt was just awfulâ: But now Ted Williams says âstronger spiritualityâ helps him stay sober&quot;], ''Today'' show, NBC-TV, March 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Williams returned to Columbus as part of shooting a commercial for a local store and a reality show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Golden Voice' Returns To Columbus To Film Commercial, Reality Show|url=http://www.10tv.com/live/content/local/stories/2011/04/13/story-columbus-ted-williams-golden-voice-reality-show.html|accessdate=17 April 2011|newspaper=[[WBNS-TV]] / 10TV News|date=April 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 6, 2011, it was announced that Williams would be entering a Texas rehabilitation facility for emotional reasons and not for narcotic reasons. Furthermore, Williams' book and reality show are on break until Williams returns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmz.com/2011/05/05/golden-voice-ted-williams-back-in-rehab-radio-youtube-video-homeless/ 'Golden Voice' Ted Williams -- Headed Back to Rehab] from [[TMZ.com]] May 05, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b240573_golden-voiced_ted_williams_headed_back.html?cmpid=rss-000000-rssfeed-365-topstories&amp;utm_source=eonline&amp;utm_medium=rssfeeds&amp;utm_campaign=rss_topstories|title=Golden-Voiced Ted Williams Headed Back to Rehab|author=Marianne Gravey|publisher=[[E!]]|date=May 06, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, ''[[The News-Herald]]'' reported that the Cleveland Cavaliers had retracted their earlier job offer to Williams.&lt;ref name=&quot;cavs&quot;&gt;Finnan, Bob, [http://news-herald.com/articles/2011/05/07/sports/nh3979315.txt?viewmode=fullstory &quot;Bob Finnan's NBA notes: Cavaliers could go international route early in draft&quot;], ''[[The News-Herald]]'', May 7, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2011, [[New England Cable News]] announced that Williams had joined NECN as the official voice of the New England cable channel and would be working out of his at-home studio in [[Dublin, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ted Williams joins NECN|url=http://www.necn.com/pages/landing_newengland?blockID=589410&amp;tagID=68088|accessdate=9 November 2011|newspaper=[[New England Cable News]] / NECN|date=November 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Heslam, Jessica, [http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/2011_1111from_homeless_to_a_home_at_necn/ &quot;From homeless to a home at NECN&quot;], ''The Boston Herald'', Friday, November 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
