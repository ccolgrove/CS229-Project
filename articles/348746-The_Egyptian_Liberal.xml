{{Nihongo|'''Michio Kaku'''|å æ¥ éé|Kaku Michio|born January 24, 1947}} is an American [[theoretical physicist]], the Henry Semat Professor of [[Theoretical Physics]] in the [[City College of New York]] of [[City University of New York]], the co-founder of [[string field theory]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://mkaku.org/home/?page_id=5 About Michio Kaku]&lt;/ref&gt; and a &quot;[[science communication|communicator]]&quot; and &quot;[[popular science|popularizer]]&quot; of science. He has written several books about [[physics]] and related topics; he has made frequent appearances on radio, television, and film; and he writes extensive online [[blog|blogs]] and articles.

==Early life and education==
Kaku was born in [[San Jose, California]] to [[Nisei|Japanese immigrant]] parents.&lt;!--nonsensical without quote Reflecting on his childhood, he said:&lt;ref&gt;Skyward Interview: &quot;Michio Kaku, String Symphonies&quot; by Owen Pye, in [http://www.jal.co.jp/en/inflight/skyward/ JAL Skyward Magazine (February 2010):]&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; His grandfather came to the United States to take part in the clean-up operation after the [[1906 San Francisco Earthquake]]{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}. His father was born in California but was educated in Japan and spoke little English. Both his parents were put in the [[Tule Lake War Relocation Center]], where they met and where his two brothers were born.

At [[Ellwood P. Cubberley High School|Cubberley High School]] in [[Palo Alto]], Kaku assembled an [[Particle accelerator|atom smasher]] in his parent's garage for a science fair project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Physics of the Impossible|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ube-MQcFFZQC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|work=pp 11|publisher=Doubleday|accessdate=9 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the National Science Fair in Albuquerque, New Mexico, he attracted the attention of physicist [[Edward Teller]], who took Kaku as a protÃ©gÃ©, awarding him the Hertz Engineering Scholarship. Kaku graduated ''[[summa cum laude]]'' from [[Harvard University]] in 1968 and was first in his physics class. He attended the [[Berkeley Radiation Laboratory]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1972, and in 1972 he held a lectureship at [[Princeton University]]. 

During the [[Vietnam War]], Kaku completed his U.S. Army basic training at [[Fort Benning]], Georgia and his advanced infantry training at [[Fort Lewis]], Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaku|first=Michio|title=Hyperspace: a scientific odyssey through parallel universes, time warps, and the tenth dimension|publisher=Oxford University Press US|year=1994|isbn=0195085140|url=http://books.google.com/?id=_HBtAHuG6dwC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%22michio+kaku%22+%22fort+benning%22#v=onepage&amp;q=|pages=146}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Vietnam War ended before he was deployed as an infantryman.

==Academic career==
Kaku became a visiting professor at the [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton Township, New Jersey|Princeton]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Previous People|url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/previous?group=physics|work=Institute for Advanced Study}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[New York University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hua|first=Long|coauthors=Michio Kaku|title=Non-polynomial closed string field theory|journal=Thesis (Ph.D.)|year=1994|volume=New York University|pages=107 p.|url=http://aleph.library.nyu.edu/F/FPCJXNMBBKHEUMTJ8C6HUB6JHPLVVQQF1ACVTACEPTM9P18S2N-00900?func=direct&amp;doc_number=003142571&amp;format=999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He currently holds the Henry Semat Chair and Professorship in theoretical physics at the City College of New York.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Physics Department|url=http://www1.ccny.cuny.edu/prospective/science/profiles/Kaku-Profile.cfm|publisher=The City College of New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Kaku has had over 70 articles published in physics journals such as [[Physical Review]], covering topics such as [[superstring theory]], [[supergravity]], [[supersymmetry]], and [[hadron]]ic physics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publish.aps.org/search/query?&amp;offset=0&amp;q%5Bclauses%5D%5B%5D%5Bvalue%5D=kaku+michio&amp;q%5Bclauses%5D%5B%5D%5Boperator%5D=AND&amp;q%5Bclauses%5D%5B%5D%5Bfield%5D=author&amp;q%5Bper_page%5D=25|title=List of research papers in American Physical Society Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, along with Prof. Keiji Kikkawa of [[Osaka University]], he authored the first papers describing [[String field theory|string theory in a field form]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|coauthors=Michio Kaku and K.

===Radio===

Kaku is the host of the weekly, one-hour radio program ''Explorations'', produced by the Pacifica Foundation's [[WBAI]] in New York. &quot;Explorations&quot; is syndicated to community and independent radio stations and makes previous broadcasts available on the program's website. Kaku defines the show as dealing with the general topics of [[science]], [[war]], [[peace]], and the [[natural environment|environment]].

In April 2006, Kaku began broadcasting ''Science Fantastic'' on 90 commercial radio stations, the only nationally syndicated science program on commercial radio in the United States. It is syndicated by [[Talk Radio Network]] and now reaches 130 radio stations and [[America's Talk]] on [[XM Satellite Radio|XM]]. The program is formatted as a live listener call-in show, focusing on &quot;futurology,&quot; which he defines as the future of science.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Featured guests include Nobel laureates and top researchers on the topics of string theory, time travel, black holes, gene therapy, aging, space travel, artificial intelligence, and SETI. When Kaku is busy filming for television, ''Science Fantastic'' goes on hiatus, sometimes for several months. Kaku is also a frequent guest on many programs, where he is outspoken in all areas and issues he considers of importance, such as the program &quot;[[Coast to Coast AM]],&quot; where on 30 November 2007, he reaffirmed his belief that there is a 100% probability of extraterrestrial life in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |subject=Michio Kaku |title=Universe, Energy &amp; SETI |interviewer=[[Art Bell]] |type= |url=http://www.coasttocoastam.com/shows/2007/11/30.html |format=Audio |program=Coast to Coast AM |callsign= |date=30 November 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kaku has appeared on ''[[The Opie and Anthony Show]]'' a number of times, discussing popular fiction such as ''[[Back to The Future]]'', ''[[Lost (TV series)|Lost]],'' and the theories behind time-travel that these and other fictional entertainment focus on.

In 1999, Kaku was one of the scientists profiled in the feature-length film ''Me and Isaac Newton'', directed by [[Michael Apted]]. It played theatrically in the United States, was later broadcast on national TV, and won several film awards.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}

In 2005, Kaku appeared in the short documentary ''[[Obsessed &amp; Scientific]].'' The film is about the possibility of time travel and the people who dream about it. It screened at the Montreal World Film Festival and a feature film expansion is in development talks. Kaku also appeared in the ABC documentary ''[[UFOs: Seeing Is Believing]]'', in which he suggested that while he believes it is extremely unlikely that extraterrestrials have ever actually visited Earth, we must keep our minds open to the possible existence of civilizations a million years ahead of us in technology, where entirely new avenues of physics open up. He also discussed the future of interstellar exploration and alien life in the Discovery Channel special ''[[Alien Planet]]'' as one of the multiple speakers who co-hosted the show, and Einstein's Theory of Relativity on The History Channel.

In February 2006, Kaku appeared as presenter in the BBC-TV four-part documentary ''[[Time (television)|Time]]'' which seeks to explore the mysterious nature of time. Part one of the series concerns personal time, and how we perceive and measure the passing of time. The second in the series deal with cheating time, exploring possibilities of extending the lifespan of organisms. The geological time covered in part three explores the ages of the earth and the sun. Part four covers the topics of cosmological time, the beginning of time and the events that occurred at the instant of the big bang.

On January 28, 2007, Kaku hosted the Discovery Channel series ''[[2057 (TV series)|2057]].'' This three-hour program discussed how medicine, the city, and energy could change over the next 50 years.

In 2008, Kaku hosted the three-hour BBC-TV documentary ''[[Visions of the Future]]'', on the future of computers, medicine, and quantum physics, and he appeared in several episodes of the History Channel's ''Universe'' series.

On December 1, 2009, he began hosting a 12-episode weekly TV series for the Science Channel at 10 pm, called ''[[Sci Fi Science: Physics of the Impossible]]'', based on his best-selling book. Each 30-minute episode discusses the scientific basis behind imaginative schemes, such as time travel, parallel universes, warp drive, star ships, light sabers, force fields, teleportation, invisibility, death stars, and even superpowers and flying saucers. Each episode includes interviews with the world's top scientists working on prototypes of these technologies, interviews with sci-fi fans, clips from science fiction movies, and special effects and computer graphics. Although these inventions are impossible today, the series discusses when these technologies might become feasible in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mkaku.org/home/?p=697 SCI-FI SCIENCE: Physics of the Impossible].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, he began to appear in a series on the website [[Gametrailers.com]] called ''Science of Games'', discussing the scientific aspects of various popular video games such as ''[[Mass Effect 2]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]''.

Kaku is popular in mainstream media because of his knowledge and his accessible approach to presenting complex subjects in science. While his technical writings are confined to theoretical physics, his public speaking and media appearances cover a broad range of topics, from the [[Kardashev scale]] to more esoteric subjects such as [[wormhole]]s and [[time travel]]. In January 2007, Kaku visited [[Oman]]. While there, he talked at length to select members of that country's decision makers. In an interview with local media, Dr Kaku elaborated on his vision of mankind's future. Kaku considers [[climate change]] and [[terrorism]] as serious threats in man's evolution from a Type 0 civilization to Type 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=The Upside Down World of Dr. Michio Kaku | url=http://www.apexstuff.com/bt/200702/cover.asp | work=BusinessToday Oman | publisher=Apex Press and Publishing | date=February 2007 | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is pictured in Symphony of Science's newest song (as of September 6th, 2011), 'The Quantum World.'

On October 11, 2010, Michio Kaku appeared in the BBC program &quot;What Happened Before the Big Bang&quot; (along with [[Laura Mersini-Houghton]], [[Andrei Linde]], [[Roger Penrose]], [[Lee Smolin]], [[Neil Turok]], and other notable cosmologists and physicists), where he propounded his theory of the universe created out of nothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdkmj|title=www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00vdkmj&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social policy advocacy==
Kaku has publicly stated his concerns over matters including the [[anthropogenic]] cause of [[global warming]], [[nuclear armament]], [[nuclear power]] and the general misuse of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaku | first=Michio | title=Nuclear Threats and the New World Order | journal=[[CovertAction Quarterly]] | volume=41 | issue=2 | pages= | doi= | month=Summer | year=1992 | url=http://www.ratical.org/radiation/inetSeries/NthrtsNnwo.html | accessdate=2008-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was critical of the [[CassiniâHuygens]] [[space probe]] because of the {{convert|72|lb|kg}} of [[plutonium]] contained in the craft for use by its [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]. Conscious of the possibility of casualties if the probe's fuel were dispersed into the environment during a malfunction and crash as the probe was making a 'sling-shot' maneuver around earth, Kaku publicly criticized NASA's risk assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Kaku | first=Michio | title=A Scientific Critique of the Accident Risks from the Cassini Space Mission | url=http://www.animatedsoftware.com/cassini/mk9708so.htm | publisher=Animated Software Company | date=5 October 1997 | accessdate=2008-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also spoken on the dangers of [[Space debris|space junk]] and called for more and better monitoring. Kaku is generally a vigorous supporter of the exploration of outer space, believing that the ultimate destiny of the human race may lie in [[extrasolar planet]]s; but he is critical of some of the cost-ineffective missions and methods of [[NASA]].

Kaku credits his anti-nuclear [[war]] position to programs he heard on the [[Pacifica Radio]] network, during his student years in California. It was during this period that he made the decision to turn away from a career developing the next generation of nuclear weapons in association with [[Edward Teller]] and focused on research, teaching, writing and media.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Kaku joined with others such as [[Helen Caldicott]], [[Jonathan Schell]], [[Peace Action]] and was instrumental in building a global anti-nuclear weapons movement that arose in the 1980s, during the administration of U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]].

Kaku was a board member of [[Peace Action]] and on the board of radio station [[WBAI-FM]] in New York City where he originated his long running program, ''Explorations,'' that focused on the issues of science, war, peace and the environment.

His remark from an interview in support of [[SETI]], &quot;We could be in the middle of an intergalactic conversation...and we wouldn't even ''know''.&quot;, is used in the third [[Symphony of Science]] installment &quot;Our Place in the Cosmos&quot;.

==Personal life==
Kaku is married to Shizue Kaku and has two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;Physics of the Future: How Science Will Shape Human Destiny and Our Daily Lives by the Year 2100. Michio Kaku. Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
