'''Gentoo Linux'''  ({{IPAc-en|Ë|dÊ|É|n|t|uË}} {{respell|JEN|too}}) is a  computer [[operating system]] built on top of the [[Linux Kernel|Linux kernel]] and based on the [[Portage (software)|Portage]] [[package management system]]. It is distributed as [[free and open source software]]. Unlike a conventional software distribution, the user compiles the source code locally according to their chosen configuration. Where source-code is available, Portage normally supplies no precompiled binaries, continuing in the tradition of the [[ports collection]],&lt;ref name=gentoo-faq&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/faq.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-10-25 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; although for convenience, some software packages (such as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[LibreOffice]]) are also available as precompiled binaries for various [[computer architecture|architectures]] where compiling would otherwise be very time consuming. The development project and its products are named after the fastest-swimming penguin, the [[Gentoo penguin|Gentoo]], to reflect the potential speed improvements of machine-specific optimization. Gentoo package management is designed to be [[modularity (programming)|modular]], [[porting|portable]], easy to maintain, flexible, and [[Optimization (computer science)|optimized]] for the user's machine.  Gentoo describes itself as a [[meta]]-distribution, &quot;because of its near-unlimited adaptability&quot;, in that the majority of users have configurations and sets of installed programs which are unique to themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;gentoo-about&quot;/&gt;

==History==
Gentoo Linux was initially created by [[Daniel Robbins]] as the ''Enoch Linux'' distribution.  The goal was to create a distribution without precompiled binaries that was tuned to the hardware and only included required programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/articles/making-the-distro-p1.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Documentation â Making the distribution, Part 1 |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2005-10-09 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one version of Enoch was distributed: version 0.75, in December 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.planetmirror.com/pub/enoch/enoch-0.75 |title=Planet Mirror â enoch â Enoch Linux â enoch-0.75 â download now |publisher=Public.planetmirror.com |date=2007-02-11 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Compilation issues revealed problems with the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC), used to build from source code.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} Daniel Robbins and the other contributors experimented with a fork of GCC known as [[EGCS]] developed by [[Cygnus Solutions]]. At this point, Enoch changed name to Gentoo Linux (the [[Gentoo penguin|Gentoo species]] is the fastest swimming penguin&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/wildfacts/factfiles/161.shtml BBC â Science &amp;amp; Nature â Wildfacts â Gentoo penguin]&lt;/ref&gt;). The modifications to EGCS eventually became part of the official GCC (version 2.95), and other Linux distributions experienced similar speed increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/articles/making-the-distro-p2.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Documentation â Making the distribution, Part 2 |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2005-10-09 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After problems with a bug on his own system, Robbins halted Gentoo Linux development and switched to [[FreeBSD]] for several months, later saying &quot;I decided to add several FreeBSD features to make our autobuild system (now called Portage) a true next-generation ports system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/articles/making-the-distro-p3.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Documentation â Making the distribution, Part 3 |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2005-10-09 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gentoo Linux 1.0 was released March 31, 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=02/03/31/2123251 |title=Slashdot &amp;#124; Gentoo 1.0 Released |publisher=Linux.slashdot.org |date=2002-03-31 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Robbins set up the non-profit Gentoo Foundation, transferred all copyrights and trademarks to it, and stepped down as Chief Architect of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/04/26/2259211 |title=Daniel Robbins Resigns As Chief Gentoo Architect |publisher=Slashdot |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current Board of Trustees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/foundation/en/#doc_chap4 |title=Gentoo Linux Documentation â Gentoo Foundation Charter |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2010-01-02 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; is composed of five members who were announced (following an election) on March 2, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080302-foundation-election.xml |title=Gentoo Linux â New foundation trustees elected |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-03-02 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a seven-member Gentoo Council that oversees the technical issues and policies of Gentoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/ |title=Gentoo Linux Projects â Gentoo Council |publisher=Gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gentoo Council members are elected for a period of one year, each year by the active Gentoo developers. When a member of the Council retires, the successor is voted into place by the existing Council members.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/council/ Gentoo Council]. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gentoo Foundation is a [[501(c)|501(c)(6)]] non-profit foundation, registered in the State of [[New Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmprc.state.nm.us/cgi-bin/prcdtl.cgi?2463313+GENTOO+FOUNDATION+INC GENTOO FOUNDATION, INC.], Corporations Information Inquiry, New Mexico Public Relation Commission. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 2007, the Foundation's charter was revoked,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=January 14, 2008 |author=jake |url=http://lwn.net/Articles/265006/ |title=Gentoo loses charter; Robbins offers to return [LWN.net&amp;#93; |publisher=Lwn.net |date=2008-01-14 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; but by May 2008 the State of New Mexico declared that the Gentoo Foundation, Inc. had returned to good standing and was free to do business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.gentoo.org/gentoo-nfp/msg_d2632d76e6582187bb1816897bb81ffd.xml |title=Gentoo Linux â List Archive: gentoo-nfp |publisher=Archives.gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portability==
Although originally built on the [[x86 architecture]], Gentoo has been ported to many others. Currently it is officially supported and considered stable on [[x86]], [[x86-64]], [[Itanium|IA-64]], [[PA-RISC family|PA-RISC]], [[PowerPC]], [[PowerPC 970]], [[SPARC]] 64-bit and [[DEC Alpha]] architectures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/releng/release/2007.0/2007.0-press-release.txt |title=Gentoo 2007.0 press release |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also officially supported but considered in development state on [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/mips/ |title=Gentoo Linux Projects â Gentoo Linux MIPS Development |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cell (microprocessor)|PS3 Cell Processor]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/ppc64/ps3/ |title=Gentoo Linux for PS3 Development |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2006-12-26 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IBM zSeries|System Z/s390]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dev.gentoo.org/~vapier/s390/ |title=Gentoo Linux Documentation â s390 Installation Document |publisher=Dev.gentoo.org |date=2004-05-12 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ARM Architecture|ARM]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/base/arm/ |title=Gentoo Linux Projects â Gentoo Linux ARM Development |publisher=Gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SuperH]]. Official support for 32-bit SPARC hardware has been dropped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://devmanual.gentoo.org/archs/sparc/index.html |title=Gentoo Development Guide: Arch Specific Notes â SPARC |publisher=Devmanual.gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portability toward other operating systems, such as [[BSD]]-derived ones including [[Mac&amp;nbsp;OS&amp;nbsp;X]], is under active development by the [[Gentoo/Alt]] project. The [[Gentoo/FreeBSD]] project already has a working guide based on [[FreeSBIE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/gentoo-freebsd.xml |title=Gentoo/FreeBSD installation guide |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2009-04-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Gentoo/NetBSD, Gentoo/OpenBSD and Gentoo/DragonFly are being developed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/gentoo-alt/bsd/index.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Projects â Gentoo/*BSD |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2006-10-19 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a project to get Portage working on [[OpenSolaris]]. There was an unofficial project to create a Gentoo port to [[GNU Hurd]], but it has been inactive since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mundurat.net/ggh/ |title=Gentoo GNU Hurd |publisher=Mundurat.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portage==
{{Main|Portage (software)}}
Portage is Gentoo's [[package management system]].&lt;ref name=gentoo-about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/about.xml |title=Gentoo Linux â About Gentoo |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar in idea to the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] [[ports collection]]s: the original design was based on [[FreeBSD Ports|FreeBSD ports]]. In contrast, the Portage tree does not contain directories of [[Makefile]]s, but of so-called [[ebuild]]s, [[Bash]] scripts that describe separate functions to download, configure, make, install and remove a package and additional functions that can be used to set up the operating environment for a package.

In contrast to other distributions, the Portage tree contains many packages which are considered non-free by the [[Free Software]] movement, and these may be installed using the same mechanisms as other packages and without restriction. Users who feel strongly about this may control this behaviour in the Portage configuration file, ''make.conf''.

Portage's main utility is [[Portage (software)#Emerge|emerge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?full=1#book_part2_chap1 |title=Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook â A Portage Introduction |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is written in [[Python (programming language)|Python]] and can be used by privileged users to inspect and alter the set of installed packages on a Gentoo operating system. Whereas emerge used to operate in a similar way to other ports collections, by entering a directory in the tree and using emerge (instead of [[make (software)|make]]) to perform package management operations, it now reads variables from the file /etc/make.conf (again similar to ports) to determine where the Portage tree is kept.

Alternative package management utilities like Paludis and pkgcore have seen heavy development. Both are intended to be used alongside or instead of the official Portage utilities in both development and practical use. As both competing projects intend to replace the official utilities, an effort has been raised to standardise the [[application programming interface]] (API) of ebuilds for all package managers, in a project called the Package Manager Specification or PMS.&lt;ref name=PMS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/proj/en/qa/pms.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Projects â Package Manager Specification |publisher=Gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Init system==
Gentoo's [[init]] system is another important feature. It is similar to the [[System V]] init system that most Linux distributions use, but uses dependency-based scripts and named [[Runlevel|run levels]] rather than numbered ones. It also includes a command called ''rc-update'' which manages runlevels.

Gentoo startup scripts use the [[runscript]] shell interpreter, rather than a more traditional shell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=4 Gentoo Handbook]&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally Gentoo's rc system was written entirely in Bash and was part of the baselayout package, which contains the basic filesystem layout and critical files needed for the system. However, this led to several limitations. For example, certain system calls needed to be accessed during boot which required C-based callouts to be added. These callouts were each statically linked, causing the rc system to bloat over time.  Additionally, as Gentoo expanded to other platforms such as [[Gentoo/FreeBSD]] and Gentoo Embedded, requiring the relatively heavy Bash shell for the rc system became undesirable or sometimes impossible.

This led to a development of baselayout 2, which was written in C and only required a POSIX-compliant shell.  During this development, it was decided that it was a better fit if baselayout provided only the base files and filesystem layout for Gentoo, and the rc system was broken off into an independent project â OpenRC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20070416-newsletter.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter â 16 April 2007 |publisher=Gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Installation==
Gentoo may be installed in several ways. The most common way is to use the Gentoo minimal CD with a stage 3 [[tar (file format)|tarball]] (see below for more explanation on stages). As with many Linux distributions, Gentoo may be installed from almost any Linux environment, such as another Linux distributions' LiveCD, LiveUSB or Network Booting using the [http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/altinstall.xml Gentoo Alternate Install Guide]. A normal install requires a connection to the Internet, but there is also a guide for a network-less install.

Previously, Gentoo supported installation from stage 1 and 2 tarballs. However, this no longer recommended officially by the Gentoo foundation, and is meant only for Gentoo developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/faq.xml#stage12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the initial install steps, the Gentoo Linux install process requires that all users compile their own Linux kernel. This process is generally not required by more simplified Linux distributions. Although this is widely regarded as a complex task,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/Editorial/article.asp?article=articles/2001/s1204/48s04/48s04.asp&amp;guid= |title=Compiling &amp; Installing Linux 2.4 |publisher=Smartcomputing.com |date=2007-01-05 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gentoo provides documentation and tools such as [[Genkernel]] to simplify the process and make it straightforward for novice users.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&amp;chap=7 Gentoo Linux Documentation â Configuring the Kernel]&lt;/ref&gt; Support for installation is provided on the Gentoo forum and on [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]].

===Catalyst===
Starting with version 2004.0, Gentoo introduced a tool called Catalyst, which is used to build all Gentoo releases and can be used to build one's own customized install media. In the summer of 2008, Gentoo's founder Daniel Robbins released a new build tool called Metro. Metro is used to build releases of [[funtoo]], a slight variant of Gentoo Linux, which is developed and maintained by Daniel Robbins. However, Metro has not yet been integrated into the Gentoo release process.

===Stages===
Traditionally installation could be started from one of three base stages:
*Stage1: System must be [[bootstrapping (computing)|bootstrapped]] and the base system must be compiled.
*Stage2: System has already been bootstrapped, but the base system must be compiled.
*Stage3: System has already been bootstrapped and the base system already compiled.

As of November 2005, only stage3 installations are officially supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/en/gwn/20051114-newsletter.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Newsletter â November 14th, 2005 |publisher=Gentoo.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tarball]]s for stage1 and stage2 were distributed for some time after this, although the instructions for installing from these stages had been removed from the handbook&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://article.gmane.org/gmane.linux.gentoo.documentation/2327 |title=Mail To News And Back Again |publisher=Gmane |date=2005-11-05 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and moved into the  Gentoo FAQ.&lt;ref name=gentoo-faq/&gt; Only the supported stage3 tarballs are currently available.

===Live USB===
A [[Live USB]] of Gentoo Linux can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ |title=UNetbootin â Universal Netboot Installer |publisher=Unetbootin.sourceforge.net |date= |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graphical installer ===
A graphical installer (the Gentoo Linux Installer project, or GLI) was released with 2006.0, but the project did not gain enough development support and is no longer supported as of 2008.0.

=== Gentoo Reference Platform ===
From 2003 until 2008, the '''Gentoo Reference Platform''' (GRP) was a snapshot of prebuilt packages that users could quickly install during the Gentoo installation process, to give faster access to fully functional Gentoo installation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.linuxdevcenter.com/pub/a/linux/2002/10/10/intro_gentoo.html|title=Gentoo Linux Reloaded|author=[[Daniel Robbins]]|date=2002-10-10|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[O'Reilly Media|LinuxDevCenter.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=6206|title=Gentoo Linux 2004.0 Released|author=Sven Vermeulen|date=2004-03-01|accessdate=2007-01-04|work=[[OSNews]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; These packages included [[KDE]], [[X Window System]], [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]], [[GNOME]], and [[Mozilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2005.1/hb-install-about.xml#doc_chap2_sect1|title=What is the Gentoo Reference Platform?|accessdate=2006-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the installation was complete, the packages installed as part of the GRP were intended to be replaced by the user with the same or newer versions built though Portage which would be built using the users' system configuration rather than the generic builds provided by the GRP. As of 2011, the GRP is discontinued, the final reference to it appearing in the 2008.0 handbook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/2008.0/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&amp;chap=1|title=Gentoo Linux Documentation|accessdate=2011-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Versions==
Once Gentoo is installed, it becomes effectively &quot;[[Rolling release|versionless]]&quot;; that is, once an ''emerge'' update is done, the system is at the latest version, with the most up-to-date packages available (subject to restrictions that a user may have specified in their Portage configuration files). For example, if a system is installed using a stage3 from March 2011, and the user performs a full ''emerge'' update one month later, they will upgrade the installed Gentoo system to the same as they would have if they had performed a fresh installation from an April 2011 CD. Thus, Gentoo users may upgrade to the latest version of all of their installed software the day that new versions are released and have an [[Portage (software)|ebuild]] available. Like other Linux distributions, Gentoo systems have an &lt;code&gt;/etc/gentoo-release&lt;/code&gt; file, but this contains the version of the installed &lt;code&gt;sys-apps/baselayout&lt;/code&gt; package.

In 2004, Gentoo began to version its Live media by year rather than numerically. This continued until 2008, when it was announced that the 2008.1 LiveCD release had been cancelled in favour of weekly automated builds of both Stages 3 and Minimal CDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20080922-releng-announcement.xml |title=Gentoo News â New release strategy to provide more current install media |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-09-22 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 December 2008, the first weekly builds were published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/news/20081220-releng-first-weekly-stage.xml |title=Gentoo News â First sets of weekly stage3 tarballs and minimal CDs released |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2008-12-20 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, a special LiveDVD was created to celebrate the Gentoo 10-year anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gentoo.org/news/20091004-gentoo-10-years.xml&lt;/ref&gt;

====Special releases====
In 2009, a special LiveDVD was released to celebrate Gentoo's 10-year anniversary. Initially planned as a once-off, the LiveDVD was updated to the latest package versions in 2011 due to its popularity among new users.

* 10.1 October 10, 2009 (Bugfix release of Special LiveDVD)
* 11.0 March 8, 2011 (Anniversary LiveDVD is updated to latest package versions)

==Drawbacks and criticisms==
Compiling packages from source takes considerably more time than installing pre-built binaries. In some cases (depending on the size of the source code to be compiled and hardware) compilation of large programs can take hours&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/build_faq.html#howlong How long does an OpenOffice.org build take?], Build FAQ for OpenOffice.org. April 9, 2003. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://linuxreviews.org/gentoo/compiletimes Compile time stats], Linux Reviews. Accessed May 8, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; and may also require a few gigabytes of temporary disk space in which to build.

Generally, Gentoo users accept long compile times as the cost of being able to apply their own compile-time options and enjoy the flexibility of Portage, but Gentoo developers have created a number of work-arounds to avoid slow package installation.
# Pre-compiled binaries are provided for some applications with long build times, such as [[OpenOffice.org]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]], provided by upstream maintainers. By using these binaries, installation time is equivalent to other Linux distributions, but users lose the ability to customize optional features.
# The standard installation process gives users configuration options to reduce compilation times, such as enabling  parallel compilation and using [[pipe (computing)|pipes]] instead of temporary files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=1&amp;chap=5#doc_chap4 Configuring the Compile Options], Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook. July 7, 2008. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Other optional features of the Portage system include distributed compiling&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=3#doc_chap2 Distributed Compiling], Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook. July 7, 2008. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and using a compiler cache.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=3#doc_chap3 Caching Compilation], Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook. July 7, 2008. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the user may be able to mount a large filesystem in RAM to greatly speed up the process of building packages. Some of these approaches have drawbacks, and so are not enabled by default.
# When installing the same package on multiple computers, the package may be compiled once and a binary package created&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gentoo.org/doc/en/handbook/handbook-x86.xml?part=2&amp;chap=3#doc_chap4 Binary Package Support], Gentoo Linux x86 Handbook. July 7, 2008. Accessed May 8, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; for quick installation on the other computers, assuming sufficiently similar hardware.

==Logo and mascots==
A [[Gentoo Penguin]] is the fastest-swimming of the penguin family. The name evokes an image of speed, while retaining the penguin as a generic mascot for Linux.

The official Gentoo logo is a stylized 'g' resembling a silver [[magatama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gentoo.org/main/en/name-logo.xml |title=Gentoo Linux Documentation â Gentoo Name and Logo Usage Guidelines |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2005-12-11 |accessdate=2010-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unofficial mascots include ''Larry The Cow''&lt;ref name=gentoo-about/&gt; and ''Znurt the Flying Saucer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sources.gentoo.org/cgi-bin/viewvc.cgi/gentoo/xml/images/znurt.jpg?view=markup |title=[gentoo] Contents of /xml/images/znurt.jpg |publisher=Gentoo.org |date=2002-11-09 |accessdate=2011-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;
