'''FDNY Ladder Company 3''' is a unit in the [[New York City Fire Department]] that has fire stewardship over a several block area of [[Manhattan]]âs [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].  Ladder Company 3 received the most casualties of any fire department in the FDNY, losing half of its men in the [[September 11th attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;Amy Reiter, &quot;These are big strong guys. They ain't going down easy&quot; Salon, September 13, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  The company reported to the north tower of the [[World Trade Center]], where Captain Paddy Brown and his men were last reported on the 40th floor of the tower.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Daly,You can feel the presence of loved ones lost on 9/11 and only hope that somehow they feel ours, too. [[The New York Daily News]], September 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The company reported to the WTC running âheavyâ meaning that it had more men than would actually be on a shift (tour), as the attacks came during a shift change and both shifts ended up reporting to duty.

Ladder Company 3âs fire truck (apparatus) that responded to the World Trade Center spent ten years housed at Hangar 17 at [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]]. At the time of the collapse, the truck was parked on [[West Side Highway|West Street]] and damaged beyond repair by the collapse of the Twin Towers. In 2011, Firefighters stood alongside victimsâ families and assorted bystanders and watched as the flag-covered, 60,000-pound fire truck was lowered by crane 70 feet below ground be part of  the [[National September 11 Memorial &amp; Museum]].

Donnelly,  Michael Carroll,  James Raymond Coyle, Gerard Dewan,  Jeffrey John Giordano,  Joseph Maloney,  John Kevin McAvoy,  Timothy Patrick McSweeney,  Joseph J.
