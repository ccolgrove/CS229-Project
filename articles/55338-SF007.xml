The '''Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol''' (RRIP, [[IEEE]] P1282) is an extension to the [[ISO 9660]] volume format, commonly used on [[CDROM]] and DVD media, which adds [[POSIX]] [[file system]] semantics.  The availability of these extension properties allows for better integration with [[Unix]] and Unix-like operating systems.

RRIP was NOT developed by Andrew Young of Young Minds, Inc., but by a consortium of representatives from interested companies and institutions in the early 1990s.  Interactive Systems Corporation was one of the twenty or so organizations involved.  The standard takes its name from the fictional town ''Rock Ridge'' in [[Mel Brooks]]' film ''[[Blazing Saddles]].

The RRIP extensions are, briefly:

* Longer file names (up to 255 bytes) and fewer restrictions on allowed characters (support for lowercase, etc.)
* UNIX-style [[Unix permissions#Traditional Unix permissions|file modes]], [[user id]]s and group ids, and file [[timestamp]]s
* Support for [[Symbolic link]]s and [[Device file system|device files]]
* Deeper directory hierarchy (more than 8 levels)
* Efficient storage of [[sparse file]]s

==Method of extension==
The RRIP extensions are built upon a related standard '''System Use Sharing Protocol''' (SUSP, [[IEEE]] P1281).  SUSP provides a generic way of including additional properties for any directory entry reachable from the primary volume descriptor (PVD).

In an ISO 9660 volume, every directory entry has an optional ''system use area'' whose contents are undefined and left to be interpreted by the system.  SUSP defines a method to subdivide that area into multiple system use fields, each identified by a two-character signature tag.  The idea behind SUSP was that it would enable any number of independent extensions to ISO 9660 (not just RRIP) to be created and included on a volume without conflicting.  It also allows for the inclusion of property data that would otherwise be too large to fit within the limits of the system use area.

SUSP defines several common tags and system use fields:
* CE - Continuation area
* PD - Padding field
* SP - System use sharing protocol indicator
* ST - System use sharing protocol terminator
* ER - Extensions reference
* ES - Extension selector

RRIP defines additional SUSP tags for support of POSIX semantics, along with the format and meaning of the corresponding system use fields:
* RR - Rock Ridge extensions in-use indicator (note: dropped from standard after version 1.09)
* PX - POSIX file attributes
* PN - POSIX device numbers
* SL - symbolic link
* NM - alternate name
* CL - child link
* PL - parent link
* RE - relocated directory
* TF - time stamp
* SF - sparse file data

Other known SUSP fields include:
* AA - Apple extension, preferred
* AB - Apple extension, old
* AS - Amiga file properties (see below)

Note that the [[Apple ISO 9660 Extensions]] do not technically follow the SUSP standard; however the basic structure of the AA and AB fields defined by Apple are [[Forward compatibility|forward compatible]] with SUSP; so that, with care, a volume can use both Apple extensions as well as RRIP extensions.

==Amiga Rock Ridge== 

Amiga Rock Ridge is similar to RRIP, except it provides additional properties used by the [[Amiga]] operating system.  It too is built on the SUSP standard by defining an &quot;AS&quot;-tagged system use field.  Thus both Amiga Rock Ridge and the POSIX RRIP may be used simultaneously on the same volume.

Some of the specific properties supported by this extension are the additional [[Amiga]]-bits for files. There is support for attribute &quot;P&quot; that stands for &quot;pure&quot; bit (indicating re-entrant command) and attribute &quot;S&quot; for script bit (indicating [[batch]] file). This includes the protection flags plus an optional comment field. These extensions were introduced by [[Angela Schmidt]] with the help of Andrew Young,
the primary author of the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol and System Use Sharing Protocol.
The Amiga extensions are recognized by Amiga program [[MasterISO]], and should also be recognized by [[MakeCD]] and Frying Pan, but the support by latter two programs is uncredited.
Amiga filesystems supporting the extensions are [[AmiCDFS]], [[AsimCDFS]] and [[CacheCDFS]].
Users who want to access comments and protection bits of their Amiga files present on CDs could simply [[Mount (computing)|mount]] some new [[logical unit]]s associated to the same [[physical unit]], but using Amiga CacheCDFS as filesystem.
