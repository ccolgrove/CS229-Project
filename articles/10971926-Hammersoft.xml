'''Sandra di Marco''', played by [[Clare Wilkie]], was the estranged wife of [[Beppe di Marco]], and mother of his son [[Joe di Marco|Joe]]. She had walked out on the family when Joe was just one year old.

Sandra reappeared in Beppe and Joe's lives in 2000 when she tracked them down to [[Walford]]. She had left them because Beppe's family (particularly his grandparents [[Bruno di Marco|Bruno]] and [[Luisa di Marco|Luisa]]) resented her for not being [[Italy|Italian]]. Sandra wanted to go back to work after having Joe, but the family wouldn't allow it, and when Beppe started siding with his family on the issue, Sandra decided to leave him and her son. She later moved in with Beppe's police partner, [[#Jack Robbins|Jack Robbins]].

She left Jack to track down her son, and wormed her way back into Beppe's life. She attempted to get custody of Joe, while working as a personal assistant to [[Ian Beale]], but Beppe used dirty police tactics to prevent this. She eventually came to an agreement to visit Joe, and went back to Jack.

As time passed, Nicky's feelings for Rod begin to run deeper. On June 15, Rod told Nicky she had caught up enough and they could end the lessons.

Steve visited Barbara in July 2001 when she was in a critical condition and confronted her about the abuse she'd showered on him when he was a child. She tried to defend her actions by saying her husband left her to bring up two children with no money. She refused to let Steve call an ambulance and asked him to kiss her. He gave a peck on the forehead but she asked for a kiss on the lips. When he leant forward, she grabbed him and gave him an extremely passionate kiss, telling him he was an attractive man. Steve was disgusted and left. Barbara died soon after.

'''Rebecca Chloe Miller''' (nÃ©e '''Chloe Jackson''') is the daughter of [[Martin Fowler]] and [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia Jackson]]. She was delivered by [[Mo Harris]] on 26 October 2000. Fifteen-year-old Sonia didn't know she was pregnant. Chloe was the result of an underage fling between Sonia and Martin. She was subsequently given up for adoption to [[Neil Miller (EastEnders)|Neil]] and [[Sue Miller (EastEnders)|Sue Miller]]. The Millers changed Chloe's name to Rebecca.

In 2002, Sonia, who had delved into [[clinical depression|depression]] over the guilt of abandoning her daughter, kidnapped Rebecca. While Sonia barricaded herself inside her house, the Millers gave [[Dot Branning]] fifteen minutes to persuade Sonia to hand Rebecca over before they phoned the police. Dot successfully persuaded Sonia to hand Rebecca over.

In 2005, Neil and Sue were killed in a [[car crash]], and Rebecca moved in with Sue's mother, [[Margaret Wilson (EastEnders)|Margaret Wilson]]. The news of the crash was read by Sonia in the newspaper, and she and Martin, who were now married, grew concerned for their daughter and decided to track her down to make sure she was well. Posing as friends of the Millers, Margaret allowed the Fowlers into their home and it was only when they admitted who they really were that she told them to get out.
[[Pauline Fowler]], Martin's mother, demanded to be part of Rebecca's life, causing upset. Sonia was furious when she discovered Pauline and Martin had been seeing her daughter behind her back. Eventually Sonia gave into her urges and grew closer to Rebecca too. Margaret decided to make Sonia and Martin Rebecca's legal guardians in case anything happened to her. Margaret was unaware that Sonia and Martin had separated due to Sonia's lesbian adultery; Sonia persuaded Martin to pretend to Margaret that they were still a couple, but when the truth came out, Margaret was furious and she refused to give Sonia guardianship of Rebecca. When Margaret had a fall and died, Rebecca was given to Martin and Pauline refused Sonia access, causing many rows. 

Sonia and Martin reunited in December 2006. On Christmas Day 2006, Pauline died when she was about to move to America. Rebecca had seen Sonia slapping Pauline before her death and believed that Sonia killed Pauline. Sonia tried to hush Rebecca, but the truth came out and Sonia was arrested following a row with Martin. After absconding with Rebecca, Sonia was cleared of Pauline's murder when [[Joe Macer]], Pauline's husband, admitted to manslaughter.

For Rebecca and Martin's sake, Sonia tearfully left Walford; however, Martin opted to go with her, and he, Sonia and Rebecca left Walford as a family in February 2007.

Audrey was introduced by executive producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] as the matriarch of a new black family moving to Walford in November 2000. Portrayed as a &quot;busy body&quot;, Audrey was axed in September 2001. Actress [[Corinne Skinner-Carter]] has revealed in 2008, that she believes Audrey was axed because of creative differences she had with the writers about Audrey's backstory: &quot;I received a script and it was all about how Audreyâs first job in England had been as a lavatory cleaner, how she had worked her way up from that to become a B&amp;B owner. I didnât think it was appropriate and I told them so â she may have come from the bottom but not from the bottom of a toilet!â.&lt;ref name=&quot;audrey&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecnj.com/review/2008/102308/feature102308_02.html?headline=Corinne_and_the_killing_of_Audrey|title=Corinne and the killing of Audrey|date=23 October 2008|work=Camden New Journal|author=Angela Cobbinah|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the toilet cleaner reference was dropped, shortly after Skinner-Carter was informed about &quot;a fantastic development in the script â Audrey was going to be killed off.â Audrey died of a [[brain hemorrhage]] in September 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;audrey&quot;/&gt;

===Storylines===
Audrey moved to Walford in 2000, taking over the Bed and Breakfast, where she lived with her son [[Dr. Anthony Trueman]]. A religious woman, she became deeply involved with his life, whilst ignoring her other son, tearaway [[Paul Trueman|Paul]]. She didn't approve of Anthony dating [[Kat Slater]] and tried to interfere many times, leading to Anthony rebelling against his mother. 

Audrey's main reason for ignoring Paul was, that in the past, Paul and Anthony had been in a car crash that had crippled a young girl. Anthony was drunk at the time and was driving but Paul took the blame and went to prison. Audrey was unaware of this and continued to ignore Paul despite his attempts at making her notice him. 

In September 2001, Audrey suffered a blow to the head accidentally after being struck by falling debris while walking past some building works. Several days later, after an argument with Paul during which he revealed Anthony was the one who was driving at the time of the accident, Audrey collapsed and suffered a severe headache, caused by a delayed reaction to the blow she received earlier.

Just before she died, Audrey told Paul that she knew about Anthony being the driver and told Paul to tell Anthony that she loved him and Paul said &quot;What about me?&quot;. Just as Audrey was about to say something to him she died. However, everything was left to Paul in Audrey's will. Audrey's ex-husband [[Patrick Trueman|Patrick]] arrived in Walford for her funeral. It was subsequently revealed that he and Audrey married in a [[shotgun wedding]], after Audrey fell pregnant with Paul. Patrick left shortly after Anthony's birth in the early 1970s. The Truemans later discovered that despite Audrey's claims, Paul was not actually Patrick's son; he was the biological child of [[Milton Hibbert]], Patrick's friend with whom Audrey had been having an affair.
