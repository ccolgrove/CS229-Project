Monica Lewinsky attended two-year community college [[Santa Monica College]], and worked for the drama department at Beverly Hills High School and at a tie shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashpoProfile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt; In 1993, she enrolled at [[Lewis &amp; Clark College]] in [[Portland, Oregon]], graduating with a psychology degree in 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashpoProfile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn-whois&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt;

Taking advantage of a family connection, Lewinsky moved to Washington, D.C. to work at the [[White House]] as an unpaid summer [[intern]] starting in July 1995 in the office of [[White House Chief of Staff]] [[Leon Panetta]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WashpoProfile&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt;  She moved to a paid position in the [[White House Office of Legislative Affairs]] in December 1995.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashpoProfile&quot; /&gt;

==Scandal==
{{Main|Lewinsky scandal}}

Between November 1995 and March 1997, Lewinsky alleged that she had had nine sexual encounters with then-President [[Bill Clinton]] that, according to her testimony, involved [[fellatio]] and other sexual contact in the [[Oval Office]], but that did not involve actual [[sexual intercourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2008-03-19-852575883_x.htm|title=Lewinsky and the first lady|date=March 19, 2008|agency=Associated Press|accessdate=January 19, 2010|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton previously had been confronted with allegations of sexual misconduct during his time as Governor of Arkansas, including a civil lawsuit filed against Clinton by former Arkansas state employee, [[Paula Jones]], alleging that he had sexually harassed her. Lewinsky's name surfaced during the discovery phase of Jones' case, when Jones lawyers sought to show a pattern of behavior by Clinton that involved sexual relationships with other government employees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Xq9fAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=mOYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3866,13572 | title=Paula Jones' lawyers want Lewinsky evidence | agency=[[Associated Press]] | newspaper=[[Gettysburg Times]] | date=April 1, 1998 | page=A3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1996, Lewinsky's superiors transferred her from the White House to [[The Pentagon]] because they felt she was spending too much time around Clinton.&lt;ref name=&quot;WashpoProfile&quot; /&gt; Lewinsky confided in a co-worker named [[Linda Tripp]] about her relationship with the President. Beginning in September 1997, Tripp began secretly recording their telephone conversations regarding the affair with Clinton. In January 1998, after Lewinsky had submitted an [[affidavit]] in the Paula Jones case denying any physical relationship with Clinton, and attempted to persuade Tripp to lie under oath in the Jones case, Tripp gave the tapes to [[Independent Counsel]] [[Kenneth Starr]], and these tapes added to his ongoing investigation into the [[Whitewater (controversy)|Whitewater controversy]]. Starr broadened his investigation to include investigating Lewinsky, Clinton, and others for possible [[perjury]] and [[subornation of perjury]] in the Jones case. Noteworthy for its revelation of Tripp's motivations was her reporting of their conversations to literary agent [[Lucianne Goldberg]]. Tripp also convinced Lewinsky to save the gifts that Clinton had given her during their affair, and not to dry clean what would later be known as &quot;the blue dress.&quot;  While under oath, Clinton denied having had &quot;a sexual affair&quot;, &quot;sexual relations&quot;, or &quot;a sexual relationship&quot; with Lewinsky.&lt;ref name=&quot;starr&quot;&gt;[http://icreport.access.gpo.gov/report/6narrit.htm#L1 Starr Report: ''Nature of President Clinton's Relationship with Monica Lewinsky''] Accessed December 18, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

News of the ClintonâLewinsky relationship broke in January 1998.  On January 26, 1998, Clinton claimed &quot;I did not have sexual relations with that woman, Miss Lewinsky&quot; in a nationally televised White House news conference.&lt;ref name=&quot;ls-nh&quot;/&gt; The matter instantly occupied the news media and Lewinsky spent the next weeks hiding from public attention in her mother's residence within the [[Watergate complex]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mworld&quot;/&gt;

Clinton had also said, &quot;there is not a sexual relationship, an improper sexual relationship or any other kind of improper relationship&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ls-nh&quot;&gt;''[[The NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]'': [http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/white_house/jan-june98/clinton_1-21.html President Bill Clinton January 21, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; which he defended as truthful on August 17, 1998, hearing because of the use of the present tense, famously arguing &quot;it depends on what the meaning of the word 'is' is&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jurist.law.pitt.edu/transcr.htm Videotaped Testimony of William Jefferson Clinton Before the Grand Jury Empaneled for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr August 17, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., he was not, at the time he made that statement, still having a sexual relationship with Lewinsky). Under pressure from Starr, who had obtained from Lewinsky a blue dress with Clinton's [[semen]] stain, as well as testimony from Lewinsky that the President had inserted a cigar tube into her [[vagina]], Clinton stated, &quot;I did have a relationship with Miss Lewinsky that was not appropriate.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wapo081898&quot;/&gt; Clinton denied having committed perjury because, according to Clinton, the legal definition&lt;ref name=&quot;sex-definition&quot;&gt;[http://www.huppi.com/kangaroo/L-clintonjonesperjury.html &quot;Perjury about sexual relations from the Paula Jones deposition&quot;] by Steve Kangas. Accessed February 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; of [[oral sex]] was not encompassed by &quot;sex&quot; ''per se''. In addition, relying upon the definition of &quot;sexual relations&quot; as proposed by the prosecution and agreed by the defense and by Judge [[Susan Webber Wright]], who was hearing the Paula Jones case, Clinton claimed that because certain acts were performed on him, not by him, he did not engage in sexual relations. Lewinsky's testimony to the Starr Commission, however, contradicted Clinton's claim of being totally passive in their encounters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bennet|first=James|last2=Abramson|first2=Jill|title=Lawyers say tape of Clinton shows regret and anger|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE4D71230F933A1575AC0A96E958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=1998-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Clinton and Lewinsky were called before a [[grand jury]]; Clinton testified via closed-circuit television, Lewinsky in person. Given an opportunity to offer final words on the matter, Lewinsky told the jury, &quot;I hate Linda Tripp.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Black|first=Jane|title=Linda Tripp: Friend and Foe|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/events/clinton_under_fire/profiles/168589.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=1998-09-11|accessdate=2008-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent life==
The affair led to a period of [[pop culture]] celebrity for Lewinsky as a younger-generation focus of a political storm.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-where&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In June 1999, ''[[Ms. Magazine]]'' published a series of articles by writer [[Susan Jane Gilman]], sexologist [[Susie Bright]], and author-host [[Abiola Abrams]] arguing from three generations of women whether Lewinsky's behavior had any meaning for feminism. [http://www.msmagazine.com/jun99/monica-gilman.asp &quot;Oral Report&quot;], [http://www.msmagazine.com/jun99/monica-bright.asp &quot;The Beauty &amp; The Brains&quot;], [http://www.msmagazine.com/jun99/monica-abrams.asp &quot;Dear Monica&quot;].&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 1999, Lewinsky declined to sign an autograph in an airport, saying, &quot;I'm kind of known for something that's not so great to be known for.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-6781212.html | title=For Lewinsky, fame the same as notoriety | author=Leonard Pitts | date=February 14, 2000 | newspaper=[[Miami Herald]] | format=fee required}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 1999, Lewinsky was interviewed by [[Barbara Walters]] on ABC's ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''; the program was watched by 70 million Americans, which ABC said was a record for a news show.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn030899&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/time/1999/03/08/makeover.html | title=Monica's makeover | author=Cloud, John |publisher=CNN | date=March 8, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She cooperated with [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] in his telling of her life and her side of the Clinton affair, ''[[Monica's Story]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn030899&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt030599&quot;/&gt;  The book was published in March 1999 and also excerpted as the cover story in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn030899&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt030599&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/books/99/02/28/daily/030599lewinsky-book-review.html | title='Monica's Story': Tawdry and Tiresome | author=[[Michiko Kakutani|Kakutani, Michiko]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 5, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewinsky made about $500,000 from her participation in the book and another $1 million from international rights to the Walters interview, but was still beset by high legal bills and living costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt; Lewinsky made a cameo appearance as herself in two sketches during the May 8, 1999, episode of NBC's ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', a program that had lampooned her relationship with Clinton over the prior sixteen months.

By her own account, Lewinsky had survived the intense media attention during the scandal period by [[knitting]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt; In September 1999, Lewinsky took this interest further by beginning to sell a line of handbags bearing her name,&lt;ref name=&quot;vogue&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.vogue.co.uk/news/daily/2004-05/040527-is-the-lewinsky-affair-over-.aspx | title=Is the Lewinsky Affair Over? | magazine=[[Vogue (magazine)|Vogue]] | date=May 27, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the company name The Real Monica, Inc.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://nymag.com/nymetro/news/people/features/4481/ | title=Monica Takes Manhattan | author=Grigoriadis, Vanessa | magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]] | date=March 19, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were sold online as well as at [[Henri Bendel]] in New York, [[Fred Segal]] in California, and [[The Cross (boutique)|The Cross]] in London.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;vogue&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,616490,00.html | title=Monica: It's In the Bag | magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] | date=January 12, 1999 [date may be incorrect]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lewinsky both designed the bagsâdescribed by ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'' magazine as &quot;hippie-ish, reversible totes&quot;âand traveled frequently to supervise their manufacturing in [[Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;

At the start of 2000, Lewinsky began appearing in television commercials for [[Jenny Craig, Inc.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt122899&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/1999/12/28/business/media-business-advertising-monica-lewinsky-meets-jenny-craig-spokeswoman-born.html | title=Monica Lewinsky Meets Jenny Craig, and a Spokeswoman Is Born | author=Hays, Constance L. | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=December 28, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The $1 million endorsement deal, which required Lewinsky to lose 40 or more pounds in six months, gained considerable publicity at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;  Lewinsky said that despite her desire to return to a more private life, she needed the money to pay off legal fees and that she believed in the product,&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc041300&quot;/&gt; while a Jenny Craig spokesperson said of Lewinsky, &quot;She represents a busy active woman of today with a hectic lifestyle. And she has had weight issues and weight struggles for a long time. That represents a lot of women in America.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt122899&quot;/&gt;  The choice of Lewinsky as a role model proved controversial for Jenny Craig, and some of its private franchises switched to an older advertising campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc041300&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/711920.stm | title=Lewinsky trimmed from slimming ads |publisher=BBC News  | date=April 13, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jenny Craig stopped running the Lewinsky ads in February, concluded her campaign entirely in April 2000, and only paid her $300,000 for her involvement.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc041300&quot;/&gt;

Also at the start of 2000, Lewinsky moved to New York City, living in the [[West Village]] and becoming an [[A-list]] guest in the [[Manhattan]] social scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;  In February 2000, Lewinsky appeared on MTV's ''[[The Tom Green Show]]'' in an episode in which the host took her to his parents' home in [[Ottawa]] in search of fabric for her new business.  Later in 2000, Lewinsky worked as a correspondent for British [[Five (TV channel)|Channel 5]] on the show ''[[Monica's Postcards]]'', reporting on U.S. culture and trends from a variety of locations.&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=1&amp;click_id=3&amp;art_id=qw96979278119B216 | title=Now Monica shows off her 'Postcards' on UK TV | agency=[[Associated Press]]/[[South African Press Association]] | publisher=[[Independent Online (South Africa)|Independent Online]] | date=  September 24, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2002, Lewinskyâno longer bound by the terms of her agreement with the [[United States Office of the Independent Counsel]]&lt;ref name=&quot;nymag-profile&quot;/&gt;âappeared in the [[HBO]] special &quot;Monica in Black and White&quot;, part of the ''[[America Undercover]]'' series.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt030302&quot;/&gt;  In it, she answered a studio audience's questions about her life and the Clinton affair.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt030302&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/03/arts/television-radio-telling-her-own-story-selling-her-new-self.html | title=Telling Her Own Story, Selling Her New Self | author=James, Caryn| newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=March 3, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewinsky was the host of the reality television dating program ''[[Mr. Personality]]'' on [[Fox Television Network]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-where&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1870544_1870543_1870550,00.html | title=Where Are They Now: The Clinton Impeachment: Monica Lewinsky | magazine=TIME | date=January 9, 2009 | accessdate=May 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There she advised young women contestants who were picking men hidden by masks.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt032303&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/23/business/media-business-advertising-mr-personality-featuring-monica-lewinsky-draws-young.html | title='Mr. Personality,' featuring Monica Lewinsky, draws the young audience of advertisers' dreams | author=[[Bill Carter|Carter, Bill]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Americans tried to organize a boycott of advertisers on the show, in protest of Lewinsky capitalizing on her notoriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper=[[Saint Paul Pioneer Press]] | page=C8 | title=People | date=April 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, the show debuted to very high ratings,&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt032303&quot;/&gt; and ''[[The New York Times]]'' said that &quot;after years of trying to cash in on her fame by designing handbags and other self-marketing schemes, Ms. Lewinsky has finally found a fitting niche on television.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/23/arts/the-tv-watch-the-name-of-the-game-is-class-guys-and-gals-or-the-lack-of-it.html | title=The Name of the Game Is Class, Guys and Gals, or the Lack of It | author=[[Alessandra Stanley|Stanley, Alessandra]] | newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | date=April 23, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the ratings slid each successive week,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356281/news | title=&quot;Mr. Personality&quot; (2003) | publisher=[[IMDB.com]] | accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and after the show completed its limited run it did not reappear.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;/&gt;  The same year, she appeared as a guest on the programs ''[[V Graham Norton]]'' in the UK, ''[[High Chaparall]]'' in Sweden, and ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and ''[[Jimmy Kimmel Live!]]'' in the U.S.&lt;ref name=&quot;imdb&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0506861/ | title=Monica Lewinsky | publisher=[[IMDB.com]] | accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Clinton's autobiography ''[[My Life (Bill Clinton autobiography)|My Life]]'' appeared in 2004, Lewinsky said in an interview with the British tabloid ''[[Daily Mail]]'':&lt;ref name=&quot;USAT0625&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2004-06-25-lewinsky-clinton_x.htm|title=Lewinsky: Clinton lies about relationship in his new book|date=June 25, 2006|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|accessdate=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|He could have made it right with the book, but he hasn't. He is a revisionist of history. He has lied. [...] I really didn't expect him to go into detail about our relationship. [...] But if he had and he'd done it honestly, I wouldn't have minded. [...] I did, though, at least expect him to correct the false statements he made when he was trying to protect the Presidency. Instead, he talked about it as though I had laid it all out there for the taking. I was the buffet and he just couldn't resist the dessert. [...] This was a mutual relationship, mutual on all levels, right from the way it started and all the way through. [...] I don't accept that he had to completely desecrate my character.}}

By 2005, Lewinsky found that she could not escape the spotlight in the U.S., which made both her professional and personal life difficult.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-where&quot;/&gt;  She stopped selling her handbag line&lt;ref name=&quot;vogue&quot;/&gt; and moved to London.&lt;ref name=&quot;time-where&quot;/&gt;  In December 2006, Lewinsky graduated with a master's degree in [[Social Psychology|social psychology]] from the [[London School of Economics]]&lt;ref name=&quot;LSEgrad&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,238021,00.html|title=Monica Lewinsky Earns Master's Degree in London|date=December 21, 2006|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=December 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she had been studying since September 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/education/2005/sep/07/highereducation.psychology | title=Lewinsky to study psychology at LSE | author=MacLeod, Donald | newspaper=[[The Guardian]] | date=September 7, 2005 | accessdate=December 24, 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her thesis was titled &quot;In Search of the Impartial Juror: An Exploration of the Third-person effect and Pre-Trial Publicity&quot;.
