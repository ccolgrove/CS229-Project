==History and overview==

The University of Alberta was founded on May 8, 1906 in [[Edmonton, Alberta]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The University of Alberta, a single, public provincial university, was chartered in 1906 in [[Edmonton, Alberta]] with a new University Act. University of Alberta was modelled on the American state university, with an emphasis on extension work and applied research.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= University|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008242|work= |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date= |accessdate=2009-10-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

University of Alberta is a non-denominational university which offers undergraduate and graduate programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;
{{cite web |author= |title= The University of Alberta|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0003521|work= |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date= |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the hiring of [[Henry Marshall Tory]] in 1907, the University of Alberta started operation in 1908 using temporary facilities, while the first building on campus was under construction.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;

In a letter from [[Henry Marshall Tory]] to [[Alexander Cameron Rutherford]] in early 1906, while he is in the process of setting up [[University of British Columbia|McGill University College]] in [[Vancouver]], Tory writes ''&quot;If you take any steps in the direction of a working University and wish to avoid the mistakes of the past, mistakes which have fearfully handicapped other institutions, you should start on a teaching basis.&quot;''&lt;ref name=ToryQuote&gt;Tory to Rutherford,  March 6, 1906. University of Alberta Archives (UAA), Rutherford Fonds, 2/3/6-8&lt;/ref&gt;
The University of Alberta was established by the University Act, 1906&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= University Act, 1910|url= http://www.ualbertacentennial.ca/history/founding/university_act.html|work= |publisher= University of Alberta|date= |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the first session of the new [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|Legislative Assembly]], with [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Alexander C. Rutherford]] as its sponsor.

The governance was modelled on Ontario's University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a bicameral system of university government consisting of a senate (faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (citizens) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The president, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the 2 bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

On September 23, 1908 forty-five students attended classes in English, mathematics and modern languages, on the top floor of the Queen Alexandra Elementary School in Strathcona. Dr. Henry Marshall Tory (1864-1947) was the first director. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Percy Erskine Nobbs]] &amp; [[Frank Darling]] designed the master plan for the [[University of Alberta]] 1909-10.  Nobbs designed the Arts Building (1914-15); laboratories and Power House (1914). With Cecil S. Burgess, Nobbs designed the Provincial College of Medicine (1920-21). 
&lt;ref&gt;http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1452 Percy Erskine Nobbs&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbert Alton Magoon (architect) designed several buildings on campus including: the residence for Prof. Rupert C. Lodge, 1913; and St. Stephen's Methodist College, on the campus of the University of Alberta, 1910. &lt;ref&gt;http://dictionaryofarchitectsincanada.org/architects/view/1460 Herbert Alton Magoon (architect) &lt;/ref&gt;

It awarded its first degrees in 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; In 1912 the university established its Department of Extension. In the early part of 20th century, professional education expanded beyond the traditional fields of theology, law and medicine. Graduate training based on the German-inspired American model of specialized course work and the completion of a research thesis was introduced.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; In 1929, the university established a School of Education. In 1932, the University Department of Extension established the Banff School of Finer Arts.

The policy of university education initiated in the 1960s responded to population pressure and the belief that higher education was a key to social justice and economic productivity for individuals and for society. On September 19, 1960 the university opened a new 130 hectare campus in [[Calgary, Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1966, the University of Alberta introduced a masters program in community development.

The single-university policy in the West was changed as existing colleges of the provincial universities gained autonomy as universities - the [[University of Calgary]] was established in 1966.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The University of Alberta first offered programs of study at Calgary in 1945 and continued until 1966 when the University of Calgary was established as an autonomous institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt;
Canada's first organ transplant research group was established at the University of Alberta on April 2, 1970, by the Medical Research Council. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, structural engineer Reuben VandeKraats made the decision to add a more complex building style to the newly designed science and art wings of the school.&lt;ref&gt;Bilash, O.S.E. and O.F.G. Sitwell. Words Into Buildings: The University of Alberta, 1906-28. Mar. 1995 (20:1), p. 4-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gladys Young donated $3.7 million to the university undergraduate scholarship fund in memory of Roland Young, who graduated from UA in 1928. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location===
The location of the university was to be decided along the same lines as that of [[Saskatchewan]]. (The province of Saskatchewan shares the same founding date as Alberta, 1905.) Saskatchewan had to please two competing cities when deciding the location of its capital city and provincial university. Thus, [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]] was designated the provincial capital and [[Saskatoon]] received the provincial university, the [[University of Saskatchewan]]. The same heated wrangling over the location of the provincial capital also took place in Alberta between the cities of [[Calgary]] and Edmonton. It was stated that the capital would be north of the North Saskatchewan River and that the university would be in a city south of it.&lt;ref name=Rutherford/&gt; In the end the city of Edmonton became capital and the then-separate city of [[Strathcona, Alberta|Strathcona]] on the south bank of the river, where Premier Alexander Rutherford lived, was granted the university, much to the chagrin of [[Calgary]], for many years to come.

Meanwhile, in 1912 the two cities of Edmonton and Strathcona were [[Amalgamation (politics)|amalgamated]] under the name of the former; Edmonton had thus became both the political and academic capital, at the expense of Calgary. This was just one act in a larger rivalry between the two cities, often called the [[Battle of Alberta]].

In 1940 the [[Garneau, Edmonton|Garneau neighbourhood]] adjacent to the University was chosen as the location for the [[Garneau Theatre]], in large part an effort to garner the University students' patronage.

===Faculties===

In 1913, a medical school established at the University of Alberta in Edmonton was opened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= History of Medical Education in Canada|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com |work= |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date= |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1920, the university had six faculties (Arts and Sciences, Applied Science, Agriculture, Medicine, Dentistry, and Law) and two schools (Pharmacy and Accountancy). It awarded a range of degrees: [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA), [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc), [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture]] (BSA), [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB), [[Bachelor of Pharmacy]] (PhmB), [[Bachelor of Divinity]] (BD), [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] (MA), [[Master of Science]] (MSc), and [[Doctor of Laws]] (LLD). There were 851 male students and 251 female students, and 171 academic staff, including 14 women.&lt;ref&gt;Dominion Bureau of Statistics, ''Canada Year Book 1921'', Ottawa, 1922&lt;/ref&gt;

===Newspapers===
The university has two main newspapers, ''Folio''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= Folio|url= http://www.ualberta.ca/folio/|work= Home page|publisher= University of Alberta|date= |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Gateway (newspaper)|The Gateway]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= The Gateway Online|url= http://www.thegatewayonline.ca|work= |publisher= |date= |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Folio'' is the official newspaper published by Marketing &amp; Communications/University Relations every two weeks from September to June and once each in July and August. ''The Gateway'' is the official student newspaper. Fully autonomous, it publishes &quot;most Wednesdays.&quot;

The university also has a monthly student newspaper, the Dagligtale, published at Augustana Campus in [[Camrose, Alberta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= Student Newspaper|url= http://www.augustana.ca/sa/services/newspaper.html|work= |publisher= The University of Alberta Augustana Campus|date= |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio===
In 1927, the university established the [[CKUA]] Educational [[radio station]].

===Book publishing===

The [[University of Alberta Press]], which was founded in 1969, concentrates on western Canadian history, general science and ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= University Presses|url= http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0008267|work= |publisher= [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|date= |accessdate=2009-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Alberta Press]] publishes an average of between 20 and 30 books per year, often accepting submissions from across [[Canada]] for over 50% of the publications. Their current active title listing has more than 150 books,&lt;ref name=uap&gt;[http://www.uap.ualberta.ca The University of Alberta Press]&lt;/ref&gt; as of 2007.

==Campuses==
The university has several distributed campus facilities including, in addition to the Main Campus, two auxiliary satellites: Campus Saint-Jean in southeast Edmonton, and Augustana Campus in [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]].  An extensively renovated and refurbished historic [[The Bay|Hudson's Bay]] department store in downtown Edmonton, renamed Enterprise Square, serves as a campus for adult students belonging to the Faculty of Extension. Notably the university owns a set of large parcels of mostly undeveloped land (currently used as an experimental farm and the site of several agricultural and sports facilities) slightly south of the main campus, called South Campus (previously the University Farm), in which an entire new university complex will gradually be constructed of similar magnitude to the Main Campus.

===North Campus===
[[Image:U of A.jpg|thumb|University, river valley, and downtown Edmonton]]Also known as Main Campus, the North Campus is the original location of the University of Alberta. It is located on the southern banks of the [[North Saskatchewan River]]. It has 145 buildings on {{convert|92|ha|acre}} of land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;!--this needs to be updated--&gt;A satellite view of the main campus can be seen on [http://maps.google.ca/maps?ll=53.5243738888,-113.5243738888&amp;spn=0.007199,0.010965&amp;t=k&amp;hl=en Google maps].

Architect [[Barton Myers]] completed the long-range campus plan in 1969 and continued as a planner for the University until 1978.

=== Campus Saint-Jean ===
The [[University of Alberta FacultÃ© Saint-Jean|Campus Saint-Jean]] is a [[francophone]] campus located 5&amp;nbsp;km east of the main campus, in [[Bonnie Doon, Edmonton|Bonnie Doon]]. It is the only [[French language|French]]-language university campus west of [[Manitoba]]. Due to increasing enrolment, the Campus Saint-Jean is currently undergoing expansion, acquiring new laboratory and classroom spaces.  Students at Campus Saint-Jean currently may pursue Bachelor's degrees in the sciences or arts, or complete their first year of [[Engineering]], after which they often transfer to the University of Alberta's main campus. Bilingual Nursing and Business programs are also available.

=== Augustana Campus ===
The [[University of Alberta Augustana Faculty|Augustana Campus]] is located in [[Camrose, Alberta|Camrose]], a small city in rural Alberta about 100&amp;nbsp;km southeast of Edmonton. In 2004, the former [[Augustana University College]] in Camrose merged with the University of Alberta, thus creating the new satellite Augustana Campus. Students enrolled at the Augustana Campus currently may pursue four-year Bachelor's degrees in arts,  sciences, or music.

===Enterprise Square===
Enterprise Square opened for business January 15, 2008 on the north side of the [[North Saskatchewan]] river in downtown [[Edmonton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The building underwent major renovations.  Currently, Enterprise Square houses the [[University of Alberta Faculty of Extension]], the professional development activities of the [[University of Alberta School of Business|Alberta School of Business]], the Alberta Business Family Institute, and the Design Gallery. It is also the new home of the University of Alberta Alumni Association.

=== Future campuses ===
The University of Alberta has future plans for one more Edmonton campus. The South Campus is much larger in terms of land area and located two kilometres to the south of the Main Campus, with a convenient high speed link via [[Edmonton Transit System#LRT|Light Rail Transit]]. [[South Campus (ETS)|The transit station]] is near '''Foote Field''' and '''Saville Sports Centre''', forming a natural gateway to the new campus architectural model. Since South Campus LRT opened in April 2009, the U of A became the only university in Canada with four LRT/Subway stations on its campuses (Along with [[University (ETS)|University]], [[Health Sciences (ETS)|Health Sciences/Jubilee]], and [[Bay/Enterprise Square (ETS)|Bay/Enterprise Square]] stations).
Preliminary long range development thinking&lt;ref name=LRDP&gt;[http://www.creative.ualberta.ca/er/publicaffairs/pdf/stg02_brochure.pdf Building on Vision - LRDP Brochure, 2001]&lt;/ref&gt; for South Campus implies it may become an expanding academic and research extension of the Main Campus, with rapid development over the next few decades. New architectural guidelines, differing from the Main Campus might encourage a somewhat more consistent, high quality, aesthetic architectural style. As there is a large expanse of land available, significant green space will be incorporated&lt;ref name=LRDP/&gt; to provide a park like context overall.

==Recent developments and investment in health and science==
$1.6&amp;nbsp;billion dollars in construction is underway at the University in regards to fields in health and science.  Most projects will be complete in 2011 and are expected to greatly expand the University of Alberta's research capacity in the field of health in particular. Currently the University of Alberta attracts approximately $500&amp;nbsp;million in external research funding a year, the second highest in Canada,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.research.ualberta.ca/OfficeoftheVPR.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; and is expected to increase due to added state-of-the-art research and teaching capacity.

===Centre for Interdisciplinary Science===
One of the major projects underway is the construction of a new $400&amp;nbsp;million state-of-the-art facility, scheduled for completion in January 2011 and to be known as the Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science (CCIS),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===The Edmonton Clinic===

Construction on two new buildings totalling $909&amp;nbsp;million 170,000 mÂ² multidisciplinary health science facility, surrounding the Health Sciences LRT Station, started in early 2008. The Edmonton Clinic North being built by the University of Alberta is slated for completion in 2011. The Edmonton Clinic South being built by [[Alberta Health Services]] is slated for completion in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.edmontonclinic.ca/ Edmonton Clinic website]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Edmonton Clinic]] (formerly the Health Science Ambulatory Learning Centre) is a joint project with Alberta Health Services, and consists of two separate buildings. Edmonton Clinic South, a 9-story building, will focus on patient care and house most of the medical and dental clinics, while Edmonton Clinic North is a 6-story building that will focus on research and education currently held at the university.

===Health Research Innovation Facility (HRIF)===
Two new $300&amp;nbsp;million buildings adjacent to the Heritage Medical Research Centre building on the main campus will contribute to research by allowing the university to hire over 100 additional biomedical and health researchers, this is projected to result in a doubling of research funding by 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cgi.ualberta.ca/hrif/index.htm Health Research Innovation Facility Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Health Research Innovation Facility (HRIF) is a translational research centre designed to create an environment for innovative &quot;bench-to-bedside&quot; health research by increasing interaction between researchers and clinicians focused on common medical issues. A total of {{convert|65000|m2|sqft|sigfig=4|abbr=off}} gross area constructed on two sites.

'''HRIF West'''

The hub of the complex is HRIF West, an 8-story building which provides the main entrance to the complex and becomes the critical link between MSB and HMRC.  The atrium connection between MSB and HRIF West provides an impressive public venue for the entire facility.  The large Lecture Theatre, Teaching and Learning Centre and food service kiosks are located with the atrium which also supports interaction between researchers as well as important links to the existing circulation systems.

'''HRIF East'''

HRIF East provides access to the complex from the south and east as well as to the Alberta Diabetes Research Institute (&quot;ADRI&quot;) which will occupy several floors within this 9-stoery building.  Both the east and west buildings of HRIF are linked at every floor to HMRC with the exception of Level 1 of HRIF West.  HRIF West is linked to MSB through the atrium and bridge connections at several levels.  In addition HRIF East connects directly to NANUC as well as the new parkade to the south.  Completing the complex, the Zeidler (GI) Building and Clinical Training Centre (&quot;CTC&quot;) is also connected to the parkade and directly linked to Walter C. Mackenzie Health Sciences Centre (&quot;WCMHSC&quot;).  A Bio-Hazard Level 3 laboratory is located in the basement of the east building, one of the largest one in Canada at over {{convert|5000|sqft|m2}} over nine stories.

==Student life and residences==

[[Image:Students Union Building University Of Alberta Edmonton Alberta Canada 01A.jpg|thumb|South side of the Students' Union Building.]]

===Student bodies===
{{See also|University of Alberta Students' Union}}
In 1946 the university student council met to consider possible blueprints for a new building, including a large auditorium, during a time when veterans were returning to complete their interrupted studies. The new building was financed by a series of mechanisms, and the completed structure, after a series of additions, now with the large auditorium, named after Myer Horowitz, opened in 1967.

The Students' Union Building (SUB) has been expanded twice since its original construction.  It holds a number of services and businesses owned and operated by the Students' Union as well as services owned and operated by the University of Alberta, including the University Bookstore.

Undergraduate and graduate students' organizations are registered with the Students Union (SU) and Graduate Students Association (GSA) of the university.

===Residences===
The University of Alberta offers a wide range of residences on its campuses.

While a majority of the university's students live off-campus, a significant number of students from outside Edmonton in early years of their post secondary education opt to live in residences operated by the university's Residence Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= Residence Services|url= http://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/residences/|work= |publisher= University of Alberta|date= |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 300-room First Year residence complex is similar in style to, although much smaller than, Lister Centre, and is composed entirely of double rooms. Across a small ravine from the rest of the campus there is another compound of seven smaller buildings (six residences and a common area) known collectively as the &quot;Ravine Complex&quot; that house almost exclusively upperclassmen. The Augustana Faculty is the only faculty in the University with a residence requirement whereby, with certain exceptions, all students are expected to spend their first year in residence on campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |title= Residence Services|url= http://www.augustana.ca/student_life/reslife/|work= |publisher= University of Alberta Augustana Campus|date= |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
