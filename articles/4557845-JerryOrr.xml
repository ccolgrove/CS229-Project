He was originally signed by the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] as an [[undrafted free agent]] in 2005. John attended Dover Area High School in Dover, Pennsylvania. He played [[college football]] at [[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania]].

Kuhn earned a [[Super Bowl ring]] as a member of the Steelers' [[practice squad]] in [[Super Bowl XL]]. He later helped the Green Bay Packers defeat the Pittsburgh Steelers in [[Super Bowl XLV]] to earn his second Super Bowl ring.

==College career==
A Northeast Region finalist for the [[Harlon Hill Trophy]] given to the top player in [[NCAA Division II]] as a senior, Kuhn was selected to play in the 2005 [[Whataburger]] [[Cactus Bowl]] on January 7 as a Division II all-star for the North team. He was named PSAC Western Division Offensive Player of the Year in 2003 and was a three-time First-Team All-[[Pennsylvania State Athletic Conference]] (PSAC) Western Division selection.

In 2004, the Raiders won their first PSAC Western Division Championship since 1988 and advanced to the [[NCAA Division II national football championship]] second round with a 10-2 record, marking the team's first 10-win regular season since 1981.

Kuhn holds 27 school records and six PSAC records. He finished his career with 4,685&amp;nbsp;yards rushing, 910 carries, 53 touchdowns, 5,300 all-purpose yards and 26 games with at least 100&amp;nbsp;yards rushing, all school records. Kuhn led the team in rushing for the third-straight season as a senior and is the only player in team history to total over 1,000&amp;nbsp;yards rushing in three-straight seasons.

A standout in the classroom, Kuhn was a First-Team [[ESPN The Magazine]]/College Sports Information Directors of America (CoSIDA) Academic All-America in both 2003 and 2004 and was named First-Team Academic All-District II three-straight years. He was also chosen as a PSAC Fall Top Ten Award winner as both a junior and senior, the first [[Shippensburg University of Pennsylvania|Shippensburg]] male student-athlete to have received the award twice.

Kuhn ranked 17th in Division in rushing yards per game and was 34th in all-purpose yards. He was chosen as a First-Team American Football Coaches Association (AFCA) All-American and Third-Team Associated Press (AP) Little All-American.

==Professional career==
===Pittsburgh Steelers===
Kuhn signed with the Steelers as an undrafted free agent following the 2005 draft but was released prior to the beginning of the 2005 season. He signed a contract to play for the [[San Jose SaberCats]] of the [[Arena Football League (1987-2008)|Arena Football League]] but chose not to report after being signed to the Steelers practice squad on November 30, 2005. Kuhn was on the practice squad roster for the entirety of the Steelers playoff run and their win in [[Super Bowl XL]].

Kuhn was re-signed for the following season on February 17, 2006, but was cut once again at the end of training camp. After spending the first eight weeks of the 2006 season on the Steelers' practice squad, Kuhn was signed to the Steelers active roster on October 31, 2006. He finished the 2006 season, appearing in nine games, with two carries for 18&amp;nbsp;yards, including a 16-yard romp on his first [[NFL]] carry versus the [[Cleveland Browns]]. He added a two-yarder against the [[Carolina Panthers]]. He also caught one pass for 15&amp;nbsp;yards, also against Carolina. On October 6, 2006 John was selected in the 8th round of the [[Arena Football League (1987-2008)|Arena Football League]]'s Expansion Draft by the [[New Orleans VooDoo]]. His rights had been owned by the [[San Jose SaberCats]] although he never played for them or in the Arena League.

===Green Bay Packers===

Kuhn was signed to the active roster of the [[Green Bay Packers]] a day after being released by the Steelers. He joined [[Rob Davis (American football)|Rob Davis]] as Shippensburg University graduates on the Packers roster.  Davis has sub-sequentially retired and joined the Packers front office staff.

The Packers re-signed Kuhn, and was an exclusive rights free agent, on March 19, 2008.  According to the terms of his contract, he made $445,000 in 2008. Also, before the 2008 season, Kuhn  hired agent Kevin Gold who represented Rob Davis.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

On October 12, 2008, Kuhn scored his first [[NFL]] [[touchdown]], versus the [[Seattle Seahawks]] in [[Seattle]], on a 1-yard reception from [[Aaron Rodgers]].

On December 26, 2010, Kuhn scored three touchdowns in a game against the New York Giants, scoring two rushing touchdowns and one receiving touchdown.

Despite limited carries and playing time, Kuhn's aerial and ground abilities on third downs have made him a fan favorite in Green Bay. Whenever Kuhn carries the ball, or even appears on the field, Packers' fans call out his surname &quot;Kuhn,&quot; which is sometimes mistaken for booing.

Kuhn started the 2011 season on the right foot, scoring a touchdown in the season opener. &lt;ref&gt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/842110-packers-vs-saints-video-watch-packers-turn-back-mark-ingram-to-preserve-win&lt;/ref&gt;
