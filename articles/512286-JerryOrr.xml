The '''Superconducting Super Collider''' ('''SSC''') (also nicknamed the '''Desertron'''&lt;ref name=&quot;analog&quot;&gt;{{cite web |authorlink=John G. Cramer |author=John G.

Its planned ring circumference was {{convert|87.1|km|mi}} with an energy of 20 [[TeV]] per beam of protons.  The project's director was [[Roy Schwitters]], a physicist at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and [[Harvard University]]. Dr. Louis Ianniello served as Associate Director.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa5348/is_200510/ai_n21380886/|title=In Memory of Louis Ianniello| work=JOM |publisher=Minerals, Metals &amp; Materials Society |date=October 2005| accessdate=2011-02-25 }}(archived at BNET/FindArticles)&lt;/ref&gt; The project was cancelled in 1993 due to budget problems.

==Development==
The system was first envisioned in the December 1983 National Reference Designs Study, which examined the technical and economic feasibility of a machine with the design capacity of 20 TeV per beam. After an extensive Department of Energy review during the mid-1980s, a site selection process began in 1987. The project was awarded to Texas in November 1988 and major construction began in 1991. Seventeen shafts were sunk and {{convert|23.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} of tunnel were bored by late 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author=Staff, Wire services |date=December 29, 2009 |url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/humaninterest/qampa-texas-supercollider-project-scrapped/1062063 |title=Q &amp;amp; A: Texas supercollider project scrapped |work=tampabay.com |publisher=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |accessdate=2010-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellation==
During the design and the first construction stage, a heated debate ensued about the high cost of the project. In 1987, Congress was told the project could be completed for $4.4 billion, and it gained the enthusiastic support of [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] [[Jim Wright]] of nearby [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]].&lt;ref&gt;Jim Riddlesperger of [[Texas Christian University]], &quot;Jim Wright&quot;, [[West Texas Historical Association]] and [[East Texas Historical Association]], joint meeting in [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], [[Texas]], February 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dubious|date=July 2010}} By 1993, the cost projection exceeded $12 billion. A recurring argument was the contrast with [[NASA]]'s contribution to the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), a similar dollar amount.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} Critics of the project argued that the US could not afford both of them. Early in 1993 a group supported by funds from project contractors organized a public relations campaign to lobby Congress directly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Aggressive Promotional Blitz Aims To Shake SSC's Pork Barrel Image | author=Scott Veggeberg |journal=[[The Scientist]] | date = May 31, 1993 | volume =7 | issue=11 | pages=1 | url=http://www.the-scientist.com/article/display/16110/}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in June, the non-profit [[Project on Government Oversight]] released a draft audit report by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]'s Inspector General heavily criticizing the Super Collider for its high costs and poor management by officials in charge of it.&lt;ref name=&quot;MilwaukeeJournal&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Super Collider's first collision is with auditors | author = Wire Services | date=June 23, 1993 | publisher = [[The Milwaukee Journal]] | accessdate=2010-06-29 | page=A9 | url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7aIaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=piwEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=project%20on%20government%20oversight&amp;pg=6784%2C6938021}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pogo.org/pogo-files/reports/contract-oversight/the-superconducting-super-colliders-super-excesses/co-ca-19930101.html The Superconducting Super Collider's Super Excesses].

== Comparison to the Large Hadron Collider ==

The SSC's planned collision energy of 40 [[Electron volt|TeV]] was almost triple the 14 TeV of its [[Europe]]an counterpart, the [[Large Hadron Collider]] (LHC) at [[CERN]] in [[Geneva]]. 

The SSC cost was due largely to the massive civil engineering project of digging a huge tunnel underground. The LHC in contrast took over the pre-existing engineering infrastructure and 27 km long underground cavern of the [[Large Electron-Positron Collider]], and used innovative magnet designs to bend the higher energy particles into the available tunnel. &lt;ref&gt;Info about the civil engineering cost and magnets is at [http://edgeofphysics.com/blog/its-the-magnets-stupid-why-the-lhc-succeeded-where-the-ssc-failed It's the Magnets, Stupid], Anil Ananthaswamy, edgeofphysics.com&lt;/ref&gt;. The LHC eventually cost the equivalent of about 5 billion US dollars to build.

After the project was canceled, the main site was deeded to [[Ellis County, Texas]], and the county tried numerous times to sell the property. The property was finally sold in August 2006 to an investment group led by the late [[Johnnie Bryan Hunt|J.B.
