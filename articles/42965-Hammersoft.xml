[[File:Ireland.A2003004.jpg|thumb|250px|True-colour satellite image of [[Ireland]], known in Irish as {{lang|ga|''Ãire''}}.]]

{{lang|ga|'''Ãire'''}} (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ËeËÉ¾Ê²É||Eire_pronunciation.ogg}} in Irish, and {{IPA-en|ËÉÉrÉ||Eire.ogg}} in English) is the [[Irish language|Irish]] name for the island of [[Ireland]] and the [[Republic of Ireland|sovereign state of the same name]].

== Etymology ==
{{See|Ãriu|Erin|Hibernia|Iverni}}
The modern Irish ''Ãire'' evolved from the [[Old Irish]] word ''[[Ãriu]]'', which was the name of a [[Gaels|Gaelic]] goddess. ''Ãriu'' is generally believed to have been the matron goddess of Ireland, a goddess of sovereignty, or simply a goddess of the land. The origin of ''Ãriu'' has been traced to the [[Proto-Celtic]] reconstruction *''Î¦Ä«werjon'' (nominative singular ''Î¦Ä«werjÅ'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wales.ac.uk/en/CentreforAdvancedWelshCelticStudies/ResearchProjects/CompletedProjects/TheCelticLanguagesandCulturalIdentity/CelticLexicon.aspx Proto-CelticâEnglish lexicon]&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests a descent from the [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] reconstruction *''piHwerjon'', likely related to the adjectival stem *''piHwer-'' (cf. [[Sanskrit]] ''pÄ«van'', ''pÄ«varÄ«'' and ''pÄ«vara'' meaning &quot;fat, full, abounding&quot;). This would suggest a meaning of &quot;abundant land&quot;.

This Proto-Celtic form became ''ÄªweriÅ«'' or ''ÄªveriÅ«'' in [[Goidelic languages|Proto-Goidelic]].&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. and D.Q. Adams, ed. ''Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture.'' London: Fitzroy Dearborn Pub., 1997, p. 194&lt;/ref&gt; It is highly likely that explorers borrowed and modified this term. During his exploration of northwest Europe (circa 320 BCE), [[Pytheas of Massilia]] called the island  ''Ierne'' (written {{polytonic|á¼¸Î­ÏÎ½Î·}}). In his book ''Geographia'' (circa 150 CE), [[Ptolemy|Claudius Ptolemaeus]] called the island  ''Iouernia'' (written {{polytonic|á¼¸Î¿ÏÎµÏÎ½Î¯Î±}}). Based on these historical accounts, the Roman Empire called the island ''[[Hibernia]]''.

Thus, the evolution of the word would follow as such:
*[[Proto-Celtic]]  *''Î¦Ä«werjon'' (nominative singular ''Î¦Ä«werjÅ'')
**[[Goidelic languages|Proto-Goidelic]]  *''ÄªweriÅ«'' or *''ÄªveriÅ«''
***[[Old Irish]]  ''Ãriu''
****[[Irish language|Modern Irish]]  ''Ãire''

Another etymology is from the [[Gaelic language|Gaelic]]:
* ''Ã¬'' (island) + ''thairr'' (west) + ''fÃ³nn'' (land), which together give ''Ã¬-iar-fhÃ³nn'', or &quot;westland isle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|first=John|last=Forbes|title=The Principles of Gaelic Grammar|edition=2nd|publisher=Oliver and Boyd|location=Edinburgh|year=1848|page=160|quote=&quot;The Celitc words Ã¬, inns, an island, will forma  key to the etymology of the names of many insular and peninsular places in the world; as, ''Ile'', Islay. ''Jura'' or ''Iura'', Jura. Uist, ''Uist'', ''Inchkeith'', isle of Keith. ''Eireinn'', or ''Eirionn'', Ã¬-iar-fhÃ³nn, wetland isle; Ireland.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is similar in meaning to the [[Norse language|Norse]] name for Irish people, &quot;west men&quot;, which subsequently gave its name to the Icelandic island of [[Vestmannaeyjar]].

=== Difference between ''Ãire'' and ''Erin'' ===
While ''Ãire'' is simply the name for Ireland in the Irish language, and sometimes used in [[English language|English]], ''Erin'' is a common poetic name for Ireland, as in ''[[Erin go bragh]]''. The distinction between the two is one of the difference between [[Grammatical case|cases]] of [[nouns]] in Irish. ''Ãire'' is the [[nominative case]], the case that (in the modern Gaelic languages) is used for nouns that are the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] of a sentence i.e. the noun that is ''doing'' something as well as the direct [[object (grammar)|object]] of a sentence. ''Erin'' derives from ''Ãirinn'' (pronounced {{IPA-ga|ËeËÉ¾Ê²ÉªÉ²||Eire.ogg}}), the Irish [[dative case]] of ''Ãire'', which has replaced the nominative case in [[County Waterford#DÃ©ise|DÃ©ise]] Irish (and some non-standard sub-dialects elsewhere), in [[Scottish Gaelic]] (where the usual word for Ireland is {{lang|gd|''Ãirinn''}}) and [[Manx_language|Manx]] (a form of Gaelic), where the word is spelled Nerin, with the initial n- is probably in origin a fossilisation of the preposition ''in''/''an'' &quot;in&quot; (cf. Irish ''in Ãirinn'', Scottish ''an Ãirinn''/''ann an Ãirinn'' &quot;in Ireland&quot;). The [[genitive case]] ''Ãireann'' is used in the Gaelic forms of the titles of companies and institutions in Ireland e.g. ''[[IarnrÃ³d Ãireann]]'' (''Irish Rail''), ''[[DÃ¡il Ãireann]]'' (''Irish Parliament'') or ''[[Poblacht na hÃireann]]'' (''The Republic of Ireland'').

Article 4 of the [[Bunreacht na hÃireann|Irish constitution]] adopted in 1937 states that ''Ãire'' is the name of the state, except in the English language, where it is ''Ireland''.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.taoiseach.gov.ie/attached_files/html%20files/Constitution%20of%20Ireland%20(Eng)Nov2004.htm Bunreacht Na Ãireann]&quot;. Office of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Retrieved on 14 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The Constitution's English-language [[Irish Constitution#Preamble (full text)|preamble]] also described the population as &quot;We, the people of Ãire&quot;. Despite the fact that Article 8 designated Irish as the &quot;national&quot; and &quot;first official&quot; language, ''Ãire'' has to some extent passed out of everyday conversation and literature, and the state is referred to as ''Ireland'' or its equivalent in all languages except Irish.

The name &quot;Ãire&quot; has been used on Irish [[postage stamps of Ireland|postage stamps]] since 1922;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Roy |last=Hamilton-Bowen |title=Hibernian Handbook and Catalogue of the Postage Stamps of Ireland |year=2009 |editor=Roy Hamilton-Bowen |publisher=Rodgau Philatelic Service GmbH |location=Rodgau, Germany |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; on all [[Irish coinage]] (including [[Irish euro coins]]); and together with &quot;Ireland&quot; on passports and other official state documents issued since 1937. &quot;Ãire&quot; is used on the [[Seal of the President of Ireland]]. Before the 1937 Constitution, &quot;SaorstÃ¡t Ãireann&quot; (the Irish name of the [[Irish Free State]]) was generally used.

During the [[The Emergency (Ireland)|Emergency]] (as [[World War II]] was known), Irish ships had &quot;EIRE&quot; (and the [[Flag of Ireland|Irish tricolour]]) painted large on their sides and deck, to identify them as neutrals.

In 1922â1938 the [[List of international license plate codes#I|international plate on Irish cars]] was &quot;SE&quot;. From 1938 to 1962 it was marked &quot;EIR&quot;, short for Ãire.  In 1961 statutory instrument no. 269 allowed &quot;IRL&quot;&lt;ref&gt;SI 269 of 1961:&quot;''...the letters EIR are used to indicate the name of the State but the letters IRL may be substituted therefor.''&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;, and by 1962 &quot;IRL&quot; has been adopted. Irish politician Bernard Commons [[Teachta DÃ¡la|TD]] suggested to the [[DÃ¡il]] in 1950 that the government examine &quot;''the tourist identification plate bearing the letters EIR''&quot;  &quot;''with a view to the adoption of identification letters more readily associated with this country by foreigners''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0119/D.0119.195003220018.html |title=DÃ¡il Ãireann â Volume 119 - 22 March, 1950 â CeisteannaâQuestions.

Under the [[Convention on International Civil Aviation|1947 Convention]] [[Aircraft registration#List of countries/regions and their current registration prefixes and patterns|Irish-registered aircraft]] have carried a registration mark starting &quot;EI&quot; for Ãire.

From January 2007, the Irish government nameplates at meetings of the [[European Union]] have borne both ''Ãire'' and ''Ireland'', following the adoption of [[Irish language|Irish]] as a [[Languages of the European Union|working language of the European Union]].

== Use of Eire in Britain and the USA==
In 1938 the British government provided in the [[Eire (Confirmation of Agreements) Act 1938]] that British legislation could henceforth refer to the Irish Free State as &quot;Eire&quot; (but not as &quot;Ãire&quot;). The 1938 Act was repealed in 1981, and the term is now rarely used in modern [[British English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Understanding Journalism: A Guide to Issues|author=John Wilson|year=1996 |publisher=[[Routledge]]||isbn=978-0415115995|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still seen on some airport signage in 2011; [[Liverpool John Lennon Airport]] has an arrivals area for &quot;Eire and [[Channel Islands]]&quot;.

&quot;Eire&quot; is generally deplored by Irish language purists, partly because it is a mis-spelling and partly because &quot;eire&quot; can also mean a burden, load or encumbrance, giving a slightly [[pejorative]] nuance to the name of the island and/or the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.smo.uhi.ac.uk/gaidhlig/faclair/macbain/macbain.txt McBain A., ''An Etymological Dictionary of the Gaelic Language''; Clark Constable, Edinburgh (1982) ISBN 0 901771686; seen online 20 Aug 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Founded in 1937, the [[Eire Society of Boston]] is an influential [[Irish-American]] group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eiresociety.org/eshistory.html The Eire Society of Boston's history page on-line] (seen on 25 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other uses ==
Ãire has also been incorporated into the names of Irish commercial and social entities, such as [[Eircom Group plc]] (formerly &quot;Telecom Ãireann&quot;) and its former mobile phone network, [[Eircell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eircom.ie/cgi-bin/bvsm/bveircom/mainPage.jsp |title=eircom homepage |publisher=Eircom.ie |date=2006-11-29 |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the Irish electricity network was devolved to [[EirGrid]]. The company &quot;BetEire Flow&quot; ([[eFlow]]), named as a [[pun]] on &quot;better&quot;, is a [[France|French]] consortium running the electronic tolling system at the [[West-Link]] bridge west of Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nra.ie/News/PressReleases/htmltext,8987,en.html |title=National Roads Authority statement 2007 |publisher=Nra.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Dublin [[Companies Registration Office (Ireland)|Companies Registration Office]] in 2008, over 500 company names incorporate the word Ãire in some form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cro.ie/search/ |title=CRO search page |publisher=Cro.ie |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes the incorporation is humorous or ironic, such as the pop group named &quot;ScaryÃire&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mongrel.ie/april07pp12.php Comment on ScaryÃire]&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Cormac Ã GrÃ¡da]]'s &quot;Ãirvana&quot; paper in 2007 on the [[Celtic Tiger]] economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucd.ie/economics/research/papers/2008/WP08.12.pdf |title=Some recent social changes are not easily linked with the Tiger per se |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
