{{2010â11 Atlantic 10 men's basketball standings}}
The 2010â11 [[Temple Owls]] men's basketball team (the Owls) represented [[Temple University]] in the [[2010â11 NCAA Division I men's basketball season]]. The team played their home games at the [[Liacouras Center]], which has a capacity of 10,206. The Owls were in their 29th season as a member of the [[Atlantic 10 Conference]]. In the [[2009â10 Temple Owls men's basketball team|previous season]], Temple Owls  gained a record of 29â6 and reached the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The team returned three starters from the previous season, but leading scorer Ryan Brooks and point guard Luis Guzman left, having graduated. They were replaced by new players Aaron Brown, Anthony Lee, and Jimmy McDonnell and graduate student transfer Dutch Gaitley. In the off-season, other Atlantic 10 coaches predicted that Temple Owls would win the league.

Temple Owls finished the season with a 26â8 record. Among the highlights of the year was an upset of #10 [[2010â11 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]] on December 9, in coach [[Fran Dunphy]]'s 400th victory. In addition, [[Lavoy Allen]] became Temple Owls' all-time leading rebounder in a 66â52 rout of [[Saint Joseph's Hawks men's basketball|Saint Joseph's]]. Allen snatched 12 boards to pass Temple Owls' radio analyst [[Johnny Baum]]'s 1,042 career rebounds. The Owls' 14â2 mark in Atlantic 10 play earned them a two seed in the [[2011 Atlantic 10 Men's Basketball Tournament]], where they lost in the semifinals to [[2010â11 Richmond Spiders men's basketball team|Richmond]]. 

The team earned an [[at-large bid]] to the [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]] as a seven seed, and defeated [[2010â11 Penn State Nittany Lions men's basketball team|Penn State]] in the round of 64 on a last-second shot by guard [[Juan Fernandez (basketball)|Juan Fernandez]]. The win ended Dunphy's 11-game losing streak in the NCAA Tournament, the longest on record. Temple Owls' season ended with a double overtime loss to [[2010â11 San Diego State Aztecs men's basketball team|San Diego State]] in the round of 32. After the season, Allen was selected for the All-Atlantic 10 First Team, [[Ramone Moore]] was selected for the All-Atlantic 10 Second Team, Fernandez was an All-Atlantic 10 Third Team selection, and Scootie Randall was recognized as an All-Atlantic 10 Honorable Mention. Allen was drafted by the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] in the second round of the [[2011 NBA Draft]].

==Season==
===Preconference season===
Temple Owls started their season with a 62â56 home win against [[Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball|Seton Hall Pirates]] on November 12. Seton Hall last led with 8:15 in the first half, off a Herb Pope jump shot to made the score 20â17. The Owls went on a 17â0 run to close the half. They led by up to 16 with 4 minutes and 16seconds left in the game, but Seton Hall scored the next 12 points to cut their deficit to four. Despite retaining most of their players from the 2009-2010 season, when they were the eighth-highest scoring team in Division I at 80.1 points per game, Seton Hall was held to 30 percent shooting by Temple Owls' defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=303160218|title=Consistent defense lifts Temple over Seton Hall|accessdate=November 23, 2010|date=November 12, 2010|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Juan Fernandez (basketball)|Juan Fernandez]] led Temple Owls with 12 points, and Rahlir Jefferson recorded his first double-double at 10 points and 10 rebounds.

All five starters scored above nine, and Micheal Eric was the highest scorer, with 14 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=303180218|title=Micheal Eric leads five players in double-digit scoring for Temple|accessdate=November 24, 2010|date=November 14, 2010|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over Thanksgiving weekend, the Owls traveled to [[Lake Buena Vista, Florida]] to participate in the [[Old Spice Classic]]. Temple Owls suffered their first loss of the season on November 25, falling to [[California Golden Bears men's basketball|California]] 57â50. The Golden Bears went on a 16â1 run late in the second half to seal a victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=303290025|title=Cal uses late 16â1 run to advance in Old Spice Classic|accessdate=December 12, 2010|date=November 25, 2010|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, Temple Owls recovered to beat [[2010â11 Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball team|Georgia]] 65â58. Scootie Randall had a career-high 18 points for the Owls, including 15 in the first half. Rahlir Jefferson's converted a three-point play with 41.4 seconds left, securing a win for Temple Owls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=303300218|title=Georgia stays close but No. 20 Temple wins at Old Spice Classic|accessdate=December 12, 2010|date=November 26, 2010|work=[[ESPN]]|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Old Spice Classic consolation game, Temple  Owls lost to [[2010â11 Texas A&amp;M Aggies men's basketball team|Texas A&amp;M]] 54â51. Texas A&amp;M took a 51â50 lead when B.J. Holmes scored with 18.5 seconds left. Juan Fernandez then missed an open jumper that would have given Temple Owls the lead. &quot;We've got to shoot the ball better. Our defense is pretty solid. We've got a chance to be a good basketball team,&quot; said Temple  Owls' coach [[Fran Dunphy]] after the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|url=http://espn.go.com/ncb/recap?gameId=303320218|title=Aggies notch upset of Owls in Old Spice Classic consolation

On December 9, Temple Owls matched up against [[2010â11 Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball team|Georgetown]].

At their first home game in almost a month, Temple Owls took an early 6â0 lead and did not trail the entire game. They led by 11 in the first half, and a [[backdoor cut]] to Ramone Moore put the Owls up 39â32 at the break. The Hoyas manage to tie the game at 56 when [[Chris Wright (basketball, born 1989)|Chris Wright]] sunk a pair of [[free throws]]. A [[three-pointer]] from Moore and a putback shot from Rahlir Jefferson enabled Temple Owls to take a 61â56 lead. A hook shot by Georgetown's Julian Vaughn cut the Hoya deficit to one with less than a minute remaining, but Hollis Thompson missed a layup that would have given the Hoyas the lead. Jefferson grabbed the rebound and then netted two foul shots, and a last-second halfcourt shot by [[Austin Freeman]] went over the backboard. Temple Owls' fans rushed the court after the buzzer, as Georgetown suffered their first loss of the year. Moore shot 12-for-18 from the floor for a career-high 30 points.

Scootie Randall returned to the Owls and earned the start, although he only played for six minutes and did not score. The game began with hot shooting by Penn State's [[Talor Battle]], who drained three of his first four threes to put the Nittany Lions up 20â11. A 17-point first half by Juan Fernandez helped Temple Owls take a 35â33 lead at halftime. Jeff Brooks, a starting forward for the Nittany Lions, dislocated his right shoulder a minute into the half and sat out the rest of the game. In the second half, there were ten lead changes, and neither team lead by more than four points. Ramone Moore's 15 foot shot with 1:10 remaining pulled the Owls ahead 62â61. In Penn State's ensuing possession, Battle took the ball to the hoop but was blocked by Rahlir Jefferson, and Temple Owls took possession. Fernandez was fouled, and his pair of free throws with 28 seconds left extended the Owl lead to 64â61. With the clock at 12.2, Battle hit a three pointer from beyond the NBA line to tie the game at 64-64. Fran Dunphy called a timeout, and Khalif Wyatt advised Dunphy to draw up a play for Fernandez.

==NBA Draft==
In the [[2011 NBA Draft]], the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] drafted Lavoy Allen in the second round with the 50th pick on June&amp;nbsp;23. Allen became the 32nd Temple player to be drafted and the first since the [[New York Knicks]] selected [[Mardy Collins]] with the 29th pick in 2006. &quot;I am very happy for him,&quot; said coach Fran Dunphy. &quot;He accomplished so much as a college basketball player. It is a great reward to be drafted, and to go to the Sixers is icing on the cake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob|last=Cooney|url=http://articles.philly.com/2011-06-24/sports/29699408_1_temple-s-allen-lavoy-allen-temple-coach-fran-dunphy|title=Sixers select Temple's Allen|work=[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]|publisher=Philly.com|date=June 24, 2011|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
