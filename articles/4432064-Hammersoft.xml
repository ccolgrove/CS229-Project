'''Tintagel Old Post Office''' is a 14th-century stone house, built to the plan of a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] [[manor house]], situated in [[Tintagel]], [[Cornwall]], [[United Kingdom]]. The house, and its surrounding [[cottage garden]], are in the ownership of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

For 50 years in the 19th century the house was used as the district letter-receiving office and the Trust has restored it to this condition. It was among the early acquisitions of the Trust (1903) and closes in the winter months.
