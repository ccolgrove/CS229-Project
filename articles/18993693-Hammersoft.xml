==Typhoon Parma devastation==
On October 8, 2009, the mall was not spared from Typhoon Parma (2009)(Pepeng) as floodwaters entered the ground level of the mall. Merchandise and fixtures owned by the mall's anchor stores and tenants were swept away by the raging flood caused by torrential rains brought by the typhoon. Around 1,000 people, including a pregnant woman, were stranded inside the mall complex.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/nation/regions/10/09/09/1000-stranded-sm-mall-rosales  ABS-CBN News Online, 1,000 stranded in SM mall in Rosales]&lt;/ref&gt; The mall's rooftop became a drop-off point for the rescue workers that were deployed to bring relief goods to the affected residents in the nearby areas.
