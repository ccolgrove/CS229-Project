'''Microsoft Office for Windows 95''' was the version of [[Microsoft Office]] designed specifically for [[Windows 95]], succeeding Office 4.3. Previously, Microsoft had released Office 4.2 for Windows NT for several architectures, &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MICROSOFT+READIES+SUPPORTING+VERSIONS+OF+MICROSOFT+EXCEL+AND+WORD+FOR...-a017013735 Microsoft readies supporting versions of Microsoft Excel and Word for Windows NT The PowerPC] &lt;/ref&gt; which included 32-bit Word 6.0 for Windows NT and Excel 5.0 for Windows NT &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.thefreelibrary.com/MICROSOFT+ANNOUNCES+WORD+6.0+AND+MICROSOFT+EXCEL+5.0+FOR+WINDOWS+NT...-a015839910 Microsoft announced Word 6.0 and Microsoft Excel 5.0 for Windows NT Workstation] &lt;/ref&gt;, however PowerPoint 4.0 was 16-bit. With Office for Windows 95, all components in the suite were [[32-bit]]. All the Office 95 [[Application software|applications]] have [[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE 2]] capacity - moving data automatically from various programs. Office 95 was replaced by [[Microsoft Office 97|Office 97]].

==Editions==
Office 95 was available in two versions. &lt;!--Professional Plus didn't come till later. (couldn't find any trace of it's existance, not listed on microsoft.com?--&gt; They contained the following applications&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Press, Issue #3 1997, sales catalogue Part No. 098-69985&lt;/ref&gt;:

Office for Windows 95 is named version 7.0 to match Word's version number. The standard version consisted of [[Microsoft Word|Word 7.0]], [[Microsoft Excel|Excel 7.0]], [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint 7.0]], and [[Microsoft Schedule+|Schedule+ 7.0]]. The professional edition contained all of the items in the standard version plus [[Microsoft Access|Access 7.0]]. If the professional version was purchased in CD-ROM form, it also included [[Microsoft Bookshelf#Versions|Bookshelf 95]].

The application versions also skipped some numbers in order to show that they were contemporary. The previous Word 6.0 had the highest number, so 7.0 were chosen for all of them. Excel 5.0, PowerPoint 4.0, Schedule+ 1.0 and Access 2.0 were the predecessors to Office 95's applications. [[Microsoft Outlook]] was not included yet and used to be bundled with [[Microsoft Exchange Server]] 5.5.

==Contemporary components ==
Several additional programs were &quot;compatible with Microsoft Office 95&quot;:

*[[Microsoft Project]] for Windows 95 (Version 4.1a)
*[[Microsoft Publisher]] for Windows 95 (Version 3.0)
*[[Microsoft FrontPage]] 1.1
*Office Small Business Pack for Office 95

Other contemporary Microsoft products were:
*[[Microsoft Works]] 4.0
*[[Microsoft Money]] 4.0

== Updated releases ==
There were no downloadable service packs or service releases for Office for Windows 95. Instead, two updated versions, 7.0a &lt;ref&gt; [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/145523 List of Fixed Bugs in Word 7.0a for Windows 95] &lt;/ref&gt; and 7.0b &lt;ref&gt; [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/149662 OFF95: Summary List of Fixed Bugs in MS Office Version 7.0b] &lt;/ref&gt; were released to fix bugs. They could be ordered from Microsoft Support. A downloadable update was released in 1999 to address minor Y2K issues. &lt;ref&gt; [http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-offers-Y2K-patch-for-Office-95/2100-1001_3-223148.html Microsoft offers Y2K patch for Office 95] &lt;/ref&gt;

Versions of [[Microsoft Jet]] database engine, 3.0 and 3.5 used by Access for Windows 95 (Access 7.0) and the later released, Access 97 respectively, had a critical issue which made these versions of Access unusable on a computer with more than 1 GB of memory. &lt;ref&gt; [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/161255 &quot;Out of memory&quot; error starting Microsoft Access] &lt;/ref&gt; While this problem was fixed for Jet 3.5/Access 97, it was never fixed for Jet 3.0/Access 95.

== Requirements ==
Microsoft Office 95 requires a [[Intel 80386|386DX]] or higher [[Central processing unit|CPU]], and either Windows 95, [[Windows NT 4.0]], or [[Windows NT]] 3.51. 8&amp;nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] of [[Random-access memory|RAM]] is the minimum for a Windows 95 installation.  28&amp;nbsp;MB of [[Hard disk drive|hard disk]] space is required for the compact installation, 55&amp;nbsp;MB for the 'typical' and 88&amp;nbsp;MB for the full install.

==Easter eggs in Office 95==
[[Microsoft Excel]] contained a hidden Doom-like game called &quot;Hall of Tortured Souls&quot;, crediting the application's writers.
