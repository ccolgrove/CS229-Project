'''GNOME Do''' (often referred to as '''Do''') is a popular, [[Free and open source software|free]] [[application launcher]] for [[Linux]] originally created by David Siegel,&lt;ref&gt;[http://lifehacker.com/software/featured-linux-download/fast-file-and-program-launching-with-gnome-do-330110.php Lifehacker - Fast File and Program Launching with GNOME Do]&lt;/ref&gt; and currently maintained by Alex Launi. Unlike other application launchers, it not only allows searching for applications and files but it also allows specifying actions to perform on search results by providing instantaneous, action-oriented search results{{Clarify|date=March 2010}} that adapt to reflect user habits and preferences.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}} GNOME Do allows for quick finding miscellaneous artifacts of GNOME environment (applications, Evolution and Pidgin contacts, Firefox bookmarks, Rhythmbox artists and albums, and so on) and execute the basic actions on them (launch, open, email, chat, play, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Ubuntu 10.04 Add/Remove Applications description for GNOME Do&lt;/ref&gt;

While it is designed primarily for the [[GNOME]] desktop, it works in other [[desktop environment]]s, such as [[KDE]].

GNOME Do was inspired by [[Quicksilver (software)|Quicksilver]] for [[Mac OS X]], and GNOME Launch Box.&lt;ref name=&quot;GNOME Do Main Page&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Docky&lt;ref&gt;[http://do.davebsd.com/wiki/index.php?title=Docky Do.DaveBSD.com]&lt;/ref&gt; is a theme for GNOME Do that behaves much like the Mac OS X [[Dock (Mac OS X)|dock]]. Unlike GNOME Do's traditional interface, Docky can be set to one of three modes for hiding:
* ''None'' - Docky is always visible
* ''Autohide'' - Docky is normally hidden, and appears when the mouse pointer reaches Docky's (unseen) edge at the lower/upper edge of the screen.
* ''Intellihide'' - Docky hides if it overlaps any window in the [[active window]] group, but it can still be brought up by with mouse pointer as described above.

Standard Do functionality is still present within Docky, and the Do hot-key will still produce the expected behavior.
