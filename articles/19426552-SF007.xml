==PowerDVD 11==
PowerDVD 11 is available in three versions â Ultra, Deluxe and Standard. The latest version acts as a universal player for movies, videos music and photos which allows users to access and play their content from one player. PowerDVD 11 works smoothly with smart devices, as PowerDVD Remote lets users control playback of PowerDVD with an iPhone or Android device and PowerDVD Mobile lets the user play content on their Android tablet and across different devices. Other new features include TrueTheater enhancements which can stabilize shaky videos or upscale the image of DVDs to HD. PowerDVD 11 features support for social media sites Facebook, YouTube and Flickr, so that content can easily be uploaded and shared through these sites. PowerDVD was the first&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/news/CyberLink-PowerDVD-First-PC-bw-561919354.html?x=0&amp;.v=1 ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blu-ray 3D software player to achieve certification from the Blu-ray Disc Association ([[BDA]]) under the new Blu-ray 3D standard (Profile 5.0). Some other features of the software include converting movies from [[Dimension|2D]] to [[3-D film|3D]], smoother [[Blu-ray]] playback, playback of a variety of video formats and subtitles, and commenting on and bookmarking movie scenes.

'''3D Movies and Photos''': TrueTheater 3D technology uses a [[GPU]]-accelerated video converter to turn regular 2D movies into 3D. Also includes support for native 3D photos and movies, including Blu-ray 3D.

'''HD Movies''': TrueTheater HD upscales standard definition DVDs and video files into HD. This can also be applied to videos from YouTube.

'''Video Formats''': PowerDVD 11 plays a wide range of video formats, including [[mkv]], [[flv]], wtv, [[RealMedia|rm]], [[rmvb]], [[3gp]] and [[3g2]]. Both rm and rmvb formats require the installation of [[RealPlayer]]. Support for [[Subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] formats include smi, [[SubStation Alpha|ass, ssa]], psb, srt and [[MicroDVD|sub]].

'''MovieMarks''': MovieMarks combine bookmarked movie scenes and review comments which can be shared online via MoovieLive.com.

'''Live Comments''': Live comments let PowerDVD users post opinions and comments to [[Facebook]], [[Twitter]] and MoovieLive while a movie is playing.


'''Limitations''': Computer must have a DVI/HDMI HDPC compliant videocard, cable and monitor to watch bluray on Version 11, in version 10 and previous there is no such limitation and VGA, composite or S-Video interfaces can be used to connect monitor or TV to PC. When installed on laptops this limitation doesn't apply, but newer bluray protected discs can be played only in version 11 and most of the time need an Internet connection to be played.

HD DVD support is not available in version 11.

==Criticism==
Cyberlink only support PowerDVD for two years after its release, which means customers may have to buy new versions of their software every one to two years in order to keep watching the latest Bluray releases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberlink.com/downloads/support/powerdvd/patches_en_GB.html &quot;As the development phase of CyberLink PowerDVD 9 Ultra retail version has now ended, there will be no further Blu-ray Disc compatibility updates for this version. Any Blu-ray Disc titles released after 2011 June may not be compatible with CyberLink PowerDVD 9 Ultra retail version.&quot; PowerDVD 9 was released in June 2009.]&lt;/ref&gt; This led to many complaints about incompatibility from users of PowerDVD 9 (and earlier) when Star Wars was released on Bluray.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.cyberlink.com/forum/posts/list/18957.page PowerDVD Ultra 9 (8, 7, etc.) won't play the Star Wars blu-rays]&lt;/ref&gt;

DVD Audio support is not available in version 11. Support stopped during version 9, although Cyberlink advertised versions 9 and 10 as being able to play DVD Audio discs. Cyberlink has refused to offer assistance to customers who bought the products believing that DVD Audio discs could be played back.
