'''Clam AntiVirus''' ('''ClamAV''') is a [[free software|free]], [[cross-platform]] [[antivirus software]] tool-kit able to detect many types of malicious software, including [[computer virus|viruses]]. One of its main uses is on [[Mail transfer agent|mail servers]] as a server-side [[email virus]] scanner. The application was developed for [[Unix]] and has third party versions available for [[IBM AIX|AIX]], [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]], [[HP-UX]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[OpenVMS]], [[Tru64 UNIX|OSF]] (Tru64) and [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]]. As of version 0.96 ClamAV builds and runs on [[Microsoft Windows]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ClamAbout&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamav.net/about |title=About ClamAV |accessdate=2008-12-25 |last=ClamAV |authorlink= |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ports&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url =http://www.clamav.net/download/packages/ |title=ClamAV Packages and Ports |accessdate=2008-12-31 |last=ClamAV |authorlink= |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both ClamAV and its updates are made available free of charge.

[[Sourcefire]], a maker of [[intrusion detection]] products and the owner of [[Snort (software)|Snort]], announced on 17 August 2007 that it had acquired the [[trademarks]] and [[copyrights]] to ClamAV from five key developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamav.org/2007/08/17/sourcefire-acquires-clamav/ |title=Sourcefire acquires ClamAV |publisher=ClamAV |date=2007-09-17 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
ClamAV includes a number of utilities: a command-line scanner, automatic database updater and a scalable multi-threaded [[daemon (computer software)|daemon]], running on an anti-virus engine from a shared library.&lt;ref name=ClamAbout/&gt;

The application also features a [[Milter]] interface for sendmail and on-demand scanning. It has support for Zip, RAR, Tar, Gzip, Bzip2, OLE2, Cabinet, CHM, BinHex, SIS formats, most mail file formats, [[Executable and Linkable Format|ELF]] executables and [[Portable Executable]] (PE) files compressed with [[UPX]], FSG, Petite, NsPack, wwpack32, MEW, Upack and obfuscated with SUE, Y0da Cryptor. It also supports many document formats, including [[Microsoft Office]], [[HTML]], [[Rich Text Format]] (RTF) and [[Portable Document Format]] (PDF).&lt;ref name=ClamAbout/&gt;

The ClamAV virus database is updated several times each day and as of 30 October 2011 contained 1,063,024 virus signatures with the the daily update Virus DB number at 13867.&lt;ref name=ClamAbout/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ClamHome&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamav.net/ |title=Latest Stable Release |accessdate=2010-08-21 |last=ClamAV |authorlink= |year=2010 |month=August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effectiveness==

ClamAV is currently tested daily in comparative tests against other antivirus products on ''[[Shadowserver]]''. In 2010 Shadowserver tested over 22 million samples against ClamAV and numerous other [[antivirus]] products. Out of the 22 million samples tested ClamAV scored 76.64% ranking 9 out of 19, a higher rating than some much more established competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.shadowserver.org/wiki/pmwiki.php/Stats/VirusYearlyStats |title=ShadowServer Yearly Stats |publisher=[http://www.shadowserver.org www.shadowserver.org] |date=2011-01-01 |accessdate=2011-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ClamAV was included in comparative tests against other antivirus products. In the 2008 AV-Test it rated: on-demand: very poor, false positives: poor, on-access: poor, response time: very good, rootkits: very poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/Results-2008q1.htm |title=Anti-virus comparison test of current anti-malware products, Q1/2008 |publisher=AV-Test GmbH |date=22 January 2008 |accessdate=12 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20110715060200/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/Results-2008q1.htm |archivedate = 15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Platforms==
===Linux, BSD===
ClamAV is available for [[Linux]] and [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]]-based operating systems.&lt;ref name=ClamAbout/&gt; In most cases it is available through the distribution's repositories for installation.

On Linux servers ClamAV can be run in daemon mode, servicing requests to scan files sent from other processes. These can include mail exchange programs, files on [[Samba (software)|Samba]] shares, or packets of data passing through a proxy server ([[IPCop]], for example, has an add-on called Copfilter which scans incoming packets for malicious data).

On Linux and BSD desktops ClamAV provides on-demand scanning of individual files, directories or the whole PC.&lt;ref name=ClamAbout/&gt;

===Mac OS X===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:ClamXAV.png|thumb|ClamXav running in Mac OS X]] --&gt;
[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] [[Mac OS X Server]] has included ClamAV since version 10.4. It is used within the operating system's email service. A graphical user interface is available in the form of ''ClamXav''.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClamXAV&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamxav.com/ |title=ClamXAV.com |accessdate=2009-01-24 |last=ClamXav.com |authorlink= |year=undated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Fink]] and [[MacPorts]] have ported ClamAV to the platform too.

Another program which uses the ClamAV engine, on Mac OS X, is Counteragent. Working alongside the [[Eudora Internet Mail Server]] program, Counteragent scans emails for viruses using ClamAV and also optionally provides spam filtering through [[SpamAssassin]].

===OpenVMS===
ClamAV for [[OpenVMS]] is available for [[DEC Alpha]] and [[Itanium]] platforms. The build process is simple and provides basic functionality, including: library, clamscan utility, clamd daemon and freshclam for update.&lt;ref name=&quot;OpenVMS&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://clamav.dyndns.org/clamav/ |title=Clam AntiVirus OpenVMS Project News |accessdate=2008-12-25 |last=Chupahin |first=Alexey |authorlink= |year=2008 |month=December}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Windows===
ClamAV for Windows is a joint project of ClamAV and [[Immunet]] which provides support for Windows XP, Vista, and 7. Unlike [[ClamWin]] it includes on-access scanning accomplished through [[cloud computing]], which reduces the use of local PC memory.&lt;ref name=&quot;WindowsClam&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamav.net/lang/en/about/win32/ |title=ClamAV for Windows |accessdate=24 April 2010 |last=ClamAV |authorlink= |year=2010 |month=April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Graphical interfaces==
Since ClamAV does not include a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI) but instead is run from the command line, a number of third-party developers have written GUIs for the application for various platforms and uses.

These include:

*[[Mac OS X]]
**ClamXav is a freeware port which includes a graphical user interfaces and has a &quot;sentry&quot; service which can watch for changes or new files in many cases. There is also an update and scanning scheduler through a [[cron]] job facilitated by the graphical interface. ClamXav can detect malware specific to Mac OS X, Unix, or Windows, but malware definitions for Mac OS X are updated less often, with sometimes up to a year between updates. However, the ClamXav application and the ClamAV engine, are updated regularly.&lt;ref name=&quot;ClamXav&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamxav.com/ |title=ClamXav.com |accessdate=2008-12-25 |last=ClamXav.com |authorlink= |year=2008 |month=November}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ClamWin===
[[Image:ClamAv.PNG|thumb|right|ClamWin running on [[Windows XP]]]]
{{Main|ClamWin}}

[[ClamWin]] is a graphical user interface front end for ClamAV for [[Microsoft Windows]] built by ClamWin Pty Ltd. Features include ''on-demand'' (user started) scanning, automatic updates, scan scheduling, context menu integration to Explorer, and an add-in for [[Microsoft Outlook]]. To provide [[real-time protection|on-access scanning]] (scan when a file is read or written), additional software must be used. Examples are Clam Sentinel and the [[free software]] called Winpooch.

Plugins for [[Mozilla Firefox]] which use ClamWin to scan downloaded files are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/fireclam/ |title=FireClam: Use ClamAV to scan Firefox downloads for viruses |publisher=Firefox Addons |accessdate=2009-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/771 |title=ClamWin Antivirus Glue for Firefox |publisher=Firefox Addons |accessdate=2008-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other extensions allow users to process downloaded files with any software and scan the files with ClamWin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://downloadstatusbar.mozdev.org/downscan/ |title=Download Scan |publisher=Downloadstatusbar.mozdev.org |date=2005-08-19 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/download-statusbar/ Download Statusbar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://extensions.geckozone.org/SafeDownload |title=Safe Download |publisher=Extensions.geckozone.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AboutClamwin&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clamwin.com/content/view/71/1/ |title=About ClamWin Free Antivirus |accessdate=2009-03-13 |last=ClamWin Pty Ltd |authorlink= |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Patent lawsuit ==
[[Barracuda Networks]] is being sued by [[Trend Micro]] as of 2008 for its distribution of ClamAV as part of a security package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.linux.com/feature/126851 |title=Trend Micro patent claim provokes FOSS community, leads to boycott |publisher=Linux.com |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trend Micro claims that Barracuda's utilization of ClamAV infringes on a [[software patent]] for filtering viruses on an [[Gateway (computer networking)|Internet gateway]]. The [[free software community]] has responded in part by calling for a [[boycott]] against Trend Micro. The boycott has been endorsed by the [[Free Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/blogs/community/boycottTrendMicro.html |title=Boycott Trend Micro |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] |date=2008-02-11 |accessdate=2008-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barracuda Networks counter-sued with IBM obtained patents in July of 2008.&lt;ref&gt;http://arstechnica.com/open-source/news/2008/07/barracuda-bites-back-at-trend-micro-in-clamav-patent-lawsuit.ars&lt;/ref&gt;
