'''Henry L. Earl'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0925082henryearl3.html|title=Henry Earl: Setting The Record Straight|format=HTML|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born October 24, 1949) is a man from [[Lexington, Kentucky]]  famous for his extensive police record. Nearly all of his arrests have been for public intoxication, with charges of disorderly conduct, third degree trespassing, second degree trespassing, and apparently one count of begging.  The Fayette County Detention Center's website, showing Earl's arrest record from 1992 to present, indicates that he has not been arrested for theft or any violent offences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jail.lfucg.com/services/offenders/offenderdetails/default.asp?inmateid=337&amp;inmateimage=E253242.JPG|title=Division of Community Corrections|format=HTML|publisher= Lexington-Fayette Urban County Division of Community Corrections|accessdate=2008-09-26}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry's rise to fame was in large part because the [[Fayette County, Kentucky|Fayette County]] ([[Kentucky|KY]]) Jail had a public web site which listed a person's arrest record and [[mug shot]]s.  Henry Earl had an extensive record, and a wide range of emotions expressed in the mug shots, from despondent to happy. This page was linked to regularly by Internet news [[blogs]] - in particular, [[Fark.com]].  The jail's web site eventually had to be shut down due to the strain that was placed upon it. Henry has made numerous talk show appearances and has been featured in national and international media venues, including [[MSNBC]], the UK [[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]], and [[Jimmy Kimmel Live]].

On November 16, 2005, it was reported that a 55-year-old black man had died in police custody in Fayette County, prompting speculation that Earl had died. The man turned out to be Donald Ross, serving time for public intoxication and third degree assault. In 2006, Earl somewhat &quot;sobered up&quot;, with his number of offenses and number of days spent in jail being overwhelmingly lower than in previous years. However, he returned to his old ways in 2007.

==1000th arrest error==
In 2008, Earl was mistakenly reported having been arrested for the 1000th time since 1992. The judge, for this case, sentenced him to one thousand days in jail, saying the sentence was &quot;only fair&quot;.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbko.com/home/headlines/29698169.html|title=Lexington Man Arrested 1,000 Times|format=HTML|publisher=WBKO|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[The Smoking Gun]] clarified that Earl has actually been arrested 1333 times since his first arrest in 1970 for carrying a concealed weapon. Earl's actual 1000th arrest occurred in 2002. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/archive/years/2008/0925082henryearl3.html|title=Henry Earl: Setting The Record Straight|format=HTML|publisher=The Smoking Gun|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
