'''Medical cannabis''' refers to the use of parts of the herb [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] (also referred to as '''medical marijuana''') as a physician-recommended form of medicine or [[herbalism|herbal therapy]], or to synthetic forms of specific [[cannabinoids]] such as [[THC]] as a physician-recommended form of medicine.  The [[cannabis|''Cannabis'' plant]] from which the [[cannabis drug]] is derived has a long history of medicinal use, with evidence dating back to 2,737 BCE.&lt;ref name=&quot;Amar2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Mohamed Ben Amar |title = Cannabinoids in medicine: A review of their therapeutic potential |journal = Journal of Ethnopharmacology |volume = 105 |issue = 1â2 |pages = 1â25 |year = 2006 |doi = 10.1016/j.jep.2006.02.001 |url = http://www.doctordeluca.com/Library/WOD/WPS3-MedMj/CannabinoidsMedMetaAnalysis06.pdf |accessdate = 8 April 2010 |pmid = 16540272}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Synthetic cannabinoids, such as [[dronabinol|Marinol]] and [[nabilone|Cesamet]], are available as prescription drugs in some countries.  A number of studies, some disputed, claim that medical cannabis relieves symptoms and is helpful in the treatment of many diseases.

==Use==
The medicinal value of cannabis is controversial. A large majority of national governments do not recognize the use of plant parts from the plant Cannabis Sativa as something that doctors can recommend to their patients. A number of these governments, including the U.S. Federal Government, allow treatment with one or more specific synthetic [[cannabinoids]] for one or more disorders.

Supporters of medical cannabis argue that cannabis does have several well-documented beneficial effects.&lt;ref name=&quot;Aggarwal-MayâJune-2009&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author=Aggarwal SK, Carter GT, Sullivan MD, ZumBrunnen C, Morrill R, Mayer JD |title=Medicinal use of cannabis in the United States: historical perspectives, current trends, and future directions |journal=J Opioid Manag |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=153â68 |year=2009 |pmid=19662925 |url=https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0BzcItO1YbTHCZDBkZTA2NmItYmI1NS00ZjRkLTgxZDktYjFlYzY4YzJkMTk2&amp;hl=en&amp;pli=1 |laysummary=http://blogs.sfweekly.com/thesnitch/2009/09/chronic_city_summing_up_the_ev.php |laysource=[[SF Weekly]] |laydate=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;cannabis-med1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabis-med.org/meeting/Cologne2009/reader.pdf |title=IACM 5th Conference on Cannabinoids in Medicine |publisher=International Association for Cannabis as Medicine |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Janet E. |editor1-last=Joy |editor2-first=Stanley J. |editor2-last=Watson |editor3-first=John A. |editor3-last=Benson |year=1999 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?isbn=0309071550 |page=[http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&amp;page=13 13] |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |isbn=978-0-309-07155-0 |oclc=246585475}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;medmjscience1&quot;/&gt; Among these are: the amelioration of [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]], stimulation of hunger in [[chemotherapy]] and [[AIDS]] patients, lowered intraocular eye pressure (shown to be effective for treating [[glaucoma]]), as well as gastrointestinal illness. Its effectiveness as an [[analgesic]] has been suggestedâand disputedâas well.

There are several methods for [[Route of administration|administration of dosage]], including [[vaporizer (cannabis)|vaporizing]] or smoking dried buds, drinking, or eating extracts, and taking capsules. The comparable efficacy of these methods was the subject of an investigative study&lt;ref name=&quot;medmjscience1&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nih.gov/news/medmarijuana/MedicalMarijuana.htm |title=Workshop on the Medical Utility of Marijuana |publisher=[[National Institutes of Health]] |year=1997 |accessdate=26 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; conducted by the [[National Institutes of Health]].

Synthetic cannabinoids are available as prescription drugs in some countries. Examples are [[dronabinol|Marinol]] (The United States and Canada) and [[nabilone|Cesamet]] (Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom, and the United States).

While utilizing cannabis for recreational purposes is illegal in many parts of the world, many countries are beginning to entertain varying levels of decriminalization for medical usage, including Canada, Austria, Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, Israel, Italy, Finland, and Portugal. In the United States, federal law outlaws all use of herb parts from Cannabis, while some states have approved use of herb parts from Cannabis as medical cannabis in conflict with federal law. The [[United States Supreme Court]] has ruled in ''[[United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers' Coop]]'' and ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' that the federal government has a right to regulate and criminalize cannabis, even for medical purposes. A person can therefore be prosecuted for a cannabis-related crime even if it is medical cannabis that is legal according to the laws of this state.

===Safety of cannabis===
According to an approved statement from the [[US Department of Justice]] in 1988, &quot;Nearly all medicines have toxic, potentially lethal effects. But marijuana is not such a substance. There is no record in the extensive medical literature describing a proven, documented cannabis-induced fatality. In practical terms, marijuana cannot induce a lethal response as a result of drug-related toxicity.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usd&quot;&gt;{{cite news

From January 1997 to June 2005, the U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) reported zero deaths caused by the primary use of marijuana. Through that time period, 279 deaths were reported where marijuana was a possible &quot;[[concomitant]]&quot; drug used in conjunction with other drugs at the time of death. In contrast, common FDA-approved drugs which are often prescribed in lieu of marijuana (such as [[anti-emetics]] and [[anti-psychotics]]), were the primary cause of 10,008 deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;cbs&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Glaucoma===

In [[glaucoma]], marijuana and THC have been shown to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP) by an average of 24% in people with normal IOP who have visual-field changes. In studies of healthy adults and glaucoma patients, IOP was reduced by an average of 25% after smoking a marijuana cigarette that contained approximately 2% THCâa reduction as good as that observed with most other medications available today, according to a review by the [[Institute of Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor1-first=Janet E. |editor1-last=Joy |editor2-first=Stanley J. |editor2-last=Watson |editor3-first=John A. |editor3-last=Benson |year=1999 |title=Marijuana and Medicine: Assessing the Science Base |url=http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=6376&amp;page=173 |publisher=[[National Academies Press]] |location=[[Washington, D.C.]] |isbn=978-0-309-07155-0 |oclc=246585475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spasticity in multiple sclerosis===

A review of six [[randomized controlled trials]] of a combination of [[Tetrahydrocannabinol|THC]] and [[Cannabidiol|CBD]] extracts for the treatment of [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS) related muscle spasticity reported, &quot;Although there was variation in the outcome measures reported in these studies, a trend of reduced spasticity in treated patients was noted.&quot; The authors postulated that &quot;cannabinoids may provide neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory benefits in MS.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lakhan&gt;{{cite journal |author = Lakhan SE, Rowland M |year = 2009 |title = Whole plant cannabis extracts in the treatment of spasticity in multiple sclerosis: a systematic review |journal = BMC Neurology |volume = 9 |page = 59 |pmid = 19961570 |pmc = 2793241 |doi=10.1186/1471-2377-9-59}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small study done on whether or not marijuana could be used to control tremors of MS patients was conducted. The study found that there was no noticeable difference of the tremors in the patients. Although there was no difference in the tremors the patients felt as if their symptoms had lessened and their quality of life had improved. The researchers concluded that the mood enhancing or cognitive effects that cannabis has on the brain could have given the patients the effect that their tremors were getting better.&lt;ref name=&quot;De-Vries 2010 2454â2462&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AMAnews&quot;/&gt;

===Alzheimer's disease===

Research done by the [[Scripps Research Institute]] in California shows that the active ingredient in marijuana, [[THC]], prevents the formation of deposits in the brain associated with [[Alzheimer's disease]]. THC was found to prevent an enzyme called [[acetylcholinesterase]] from accelerating the formation of &quot;Alzheimer plaques&quot; in the brain more effectively than commercially marketed drugs. THC is also more effective at blocking clumps of protein that can inhibit memory and cognition in Alzheimerâs patients, as reported in [[Molecular Pharmaceutics]].&lt;ref name=&quot;alz&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Eubanks LM, Rogers CJ, Beuscher AE, ''et al.'' |title=A Molecular Link Between the Active Component of Marijuana and Alzheimer's Disease Pathology |journal=Molecular Pharmaceutics |volume=3 |issue=6 |pages=773â7 |year=2006 |pmid=17140265 |pmc=2562334 |doi=10.1021/mp060066m |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mental disorders===

There has been evidence that smoking marijuana can have a positive effect on disorders such as Schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or depression.{{cn|date=September 2011}} In patients with bipolar disorder subjects have been shown to actually become better after smoking marijuana increasing the rate at which these patients go from high to low.{{cn|date=September 2011}} In the case of depression many users have reported that their moods have become better.{{cn|date=September 2011}} Research done on lab rats and animals has shown that marijuana can act as an anti-depressant but in other studies done on humans this is not the case, actually pushing the subjects further into their depression.{{cn|date=September 2011}} A study of 50,000 Swedish soldiers who had smoked at least once were twice as likely to develop schizophrenia as those who had not smoked. The study concluded that either smoking caused a higher rate of schizophrenia, or that schizophrenics were more likely to be drawn to marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Medical marijuana and the mind|journal=Harvard Mental Health Letter|year=2010|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1â3|pmid=20499454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by [[Keele University]] commissioned by the British government found that between 1996 and 2005 there had been significant reductions in the incidence and prevalence of schizophrenia. From 2000 onwards there were also significant reductions in the prevalence of psychoses.

The authors say this data is &quot;not consistent with the hypothesis that increasing cannabis use in earlier decades is associated with increasing schizophrenia or psychoses from the mid-1990s onwards&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukcia.org/research/keele_study/Assessing-the-impact-of-cannabis.pdf | title = Frisher, M., et al., Assessing the impact of cannabis use on trends in diagnosed schizophrenia in the United Kingdom from 1996 to 2005, Schizophr.

A 10 year study on 1923 individuals from the general population in [[Germany]], aged 14â24, concluded that cannabis use is a risk factor for the development of incident psychotic symptoms. Continued cannabis use might increase the risk for psychotic disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d738 |title=Continued cannabis use and risk of incidence and persistence of psychotic symptoms: 10 year follow-up cohort study |publisher=[[BMJ]] |doi=10.1136/bmj.d738 |date=2011-03-01 |accessdate=2011-08-23 |last1=Kuepper |first1=R. |last2=Van Os |first2=J. |last3=Lieb |first3=R. |last4=Wittchen |first4=H.-U. |last5=Hofler |first5=M. |last6=Henquet |first6=C. |journal=BMJ |volume=342 |pages=d738 |pmid=21363868 |pmc=3047001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lung cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease===

The evidence to date is conflicting as to whether smoking cannabis increases the risk of developing [[lung cancer]] or [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) among people who do not smoke tobacco. In 2006 a study by Hashibe, Morgenstern, Cui, Tashkin, ''et al.'' suggested that smoking cannabis does not, by itself, increase the risk of lung cancer. Several subsequent studies have found results suggesting the reverse, however many of these were not completed with proper [[scientific control]]s and have subsequently been discredited. Many studies did report a strongly synergistic effect, however, between tobacco use and smoking cannabis such that tobacco smokers who also smoked cannabis dramatically increased their already very high risk of developing lung cancer or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by as much as 300%. Some of these research results follow below:

* In 2006, Hashibe, Morgenstern, Cui, Tashkin, ''et al.'' presented the results from a study involving 2,240 subjects that showed non-tobacco users who smoked marijuana did not exhibit an increased incidence of lung cancer or head-and-neck malignancies. These results were supported even among very long-term, very heavy users of marijuana.&lt;ref name=&quot;tashink&quot;&gt;

:Tashkin, a pulmonologist who has studied marijuana for 30 years, said, &quot;It's possible that tetrahydrocannabinol [[tetrahydrocannabinol|(THC)]] in marijuana smoke may encourage [[apoptosis]], or programmed cell death, causing cells to die off before they have a chance to undergo malignant transformation&quot;. He further commented that &quot;We hypothesized that there would be a positive association between marijuana use and lung cancer, and that the association would be more positive with heavier use. What we found instead was no association at all, and even a suggestion of some protective effect.&quot;{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2010}}

* A case-control study of lung cancer in adults 55 years of age and younger found that the risk of lung cancer increased 8% (95% confidence interval (CI) 2â15) for each joint-year of cannabis smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cigarette smoking, and 7% (95% CI 5â9) for each pack-year of cigarette smoking, after adjustment for confounding variables including cannabis smoking.&lt;ref&gt;

* A 2008 study by Hii, Tam, Thompson, and Naughton found that marijuana smoking leads to asymmetrical bullous disease, often in the setting of normal CXR and lung function. In subjects who smoke marijuana, these pathological changes occur at a younger age (approximately 20 years earlier) than in tobacco smokers.&lt;ref&gt;

* Researchers from the University of British Columbia presented a study at the American Thoracic Society 2007 International Conference showing that smoking marijuana and tobacco together more than tripled the risk of developing COPD over just smoking tobacco alone.{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=August 2010}}{{cite press release |title=Marijuana Worsens COPD Symptoms in Current Cigarette Smokers |publisher=[[American Thoracic Society]] |date=21 May 2007 |url=http://www.thoracic.org/sections/publications/press-releases/conference/articles/2007/press-releases/marijuana-worsens-copd-symptoms-in-current-cigarette-smokers.html |accessdate=11 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar findings were released in April 2009 by the Vancouver Burden of Obstructive Lung Disease Research Group.

===Breast cancer===

According to a 2007 study at the [[California Pacific Medical Center]] Research Institute, [[cannabidiol]] (CBD) may stop [[breast cancer]] from spreading throughout the body.&lt;ref name=pmid18025276&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McAllister SD, Christian RT, Horowitz MP, Garcia A, Desprez PY |title=Cannabidiol as a novel inhibitor of Id-1 gene expression in aggressive breast cancer cells |journal=Molecular Cancer Therapeutics |volume=6 |issue=11 |pages=2921â7 |year=2007 |pmid=18025276 |doi=10.1158/1535-7163.MCT-07-0371 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/7098340.stm |laysource=[[BBC News]] |laydate=19 November 2007 |format=Free full text}}&lt;/ref&gt; These researchers believe their discovery may provide a non-toxic alternative to [[chemotherapy]] while achieving the same results minus the painful and unpleasant [[adverse effect|side effects]].

===HIV/AIDS===

Investigators at [[Columbia University]] published clinical trial data in 2007 showing that [[HIV/AIDS]] patients who inhaled cannabis four times daily experienced substantial increases in food intake with little evidence of discomfort and no impairment of cognitive performance. They concluded that smoked marijuana has a clear medical benefit in HIV-positive patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Haney M, Gunderson EW, Rabkin J, ''et al.'' |title=Dronabinol and marijuana in HIV-positive marijuana smokers.

In another study in 2008, researchers at the [[University of California, San Diego School of Medicine]] found that marijuana significantly reduces HIV-related [[neuropathic pain]] when added to a patient's already-prescribed pain management regimen and may be an &quot;effective option for pain relief&quot; in those whose pain is not controlled with current medications.

===Brain cancer===

A study by [[Complutense University of Madrid]] found the chemicals in marijuana promotes the death of [[brain cancer]] cells by essentially helping them feed upon themselves in a process called [[autophagy]]. The research team discovered that cannabinoids such as THC had anticancer effects in mice with human brain cancer cells and in people with brain tumors. When mice with the human brain cancer cells received the THC, the tumor shrank. Using [[electron microscopes]] to analyze brain tissue taken both before and after a 26- to 30-day THC treatment regimen, the researchers found that THC eliminated cancer cells while leaving healthy cells intact.&lt;ref name=pmid19425170&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Salazar M, Carracedo A, Salanueva IJ, ''et al.'' |title=Cannabinoid action induces autophagy-mediated cell death through stimulation of ER stress in human glioma cells |journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation |volume=119 |issue=5 |pages=1359â72 |year=2009|pmid=19425170 |pmc=2673842 |doi=10.1172/JCI37948 |laysummary=http://health.usnews.com/articles/health/healthday/2009/04/01/active-ingredient-in-marijuana-kills-brain-cancer.html |laysource=[[HealthDay]] |laydate=1 April 2009 |last12=Fimia |first12=GM |last13=Piacentini |first13=M |last14=Cecconi |first14=F |last15=Pandolfi |first15=PP |last16=GonzÃ¡lez-Feria |first16=L |last17=Iovanna |first17=JL |last18=GuzmÃ¡n |first18=M |last19=Boya |first19=P |last20=Velasco |first20=G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patients did not have any toxic effects from the treatment; previous studies of THC for the treatment of cancer have also found the therapy to be well tolerated. However, the mechanisms which promote THC's tumor cellâkilling action are unknown.&lt;ref name=pmid19425170/&gt;

===Opioid dependence===

Injections of THC eliminate dependence on opiates in stressed rats, according to a research team at the ''Laboratory for Physiopathology of Diseases of the Central Nervous System'' (France) in the journal ''Neuropsychopharmacology''.&lt;ref name=pmid19553915&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Morel LJ, Giros B, DaugÃ© V |title=Adolescent Exposure to Chronic Delta-9-Tetrahydrocannabinol Blocks Opiate Dependence in Maternally Deprived Rats |journal=Neuropsychopharmacology |volume= 34|issue= 11|pages= 2469â76|year=2009 |pmid=19553915 |doi=10.1038/npp.2009.70 |laysummary=http://www.physorg.com/news166196260.html |laysource=[[PhysOrg.com]] |laydate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Deprived of their mothers at birth, rats become hypersensitive to the rewarding effect of morphine and heroin (substances belonging to the opiate family), and rapidly become dependent. When these rats were administered THC, they no longer developed typical morphine-dependent behavior. In the [[striatum]], a region of the brain involved in drug dependence, the production of endogenous [[enkephalins]] was restored under THC, whereas it diminished in rats stressed from birth which had not received THC. Researchers believe the findings could lead to therapeutic alternatives to existing substitution treatments.&lt;ref name=pmid19553915/&gt;

===Controlling ALS symptoms===
Recent research has been conducted on if the use of marijuana could control some of the symptoms of ALS or Lou Gehrig Disease. A survey was conducted on 131 people who suffered from ALS. The survey asked if the subjects had used marijuana in the last 12 months to control some of their symptoms. The survey resulted in 13 people who had used the drug in some form to control symptoms. The survey results found that cannabis was moderately effective in reducing symptoms of appetite loss, depression, pain, spasticity, drooling and weakness and the longest relief reported was for depression. The pattern of symptom relief was consistent with those reported by people with other conditions, including MS (Amtmann et al. 2004).&lt;ref name=&quot;De-Vries 2010 2454â2462&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=De-Vries |first=Kay |coauthors=Anita J Green |title=Cannabis use in palliative care â an examination of the evidence and the implications for nurses |journal=Journal of Clinical Nursing |date=17 |year=2010 |volume=19 |issue=19 |pages=2454â2462 |url=http://www.advancedholistichealth.org/PDF_Files/Palliative%20care.pdf |pmid=20920073 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2702.2010.03274.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tetrahydrocannabinol===
{{Main|Tetrahydrocannabinol}}

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) is the primary compound responsible for the psychoactive effects of cannabis. The compound is a mild analgesic, and cellular research has shown the compound has antioxidant activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hampson AJ, Grimaldi M, Axelrod J, Wink D. |url=http://www.pnas.org/content/95/14/8268.long |title=Cannabidiol and (â)Î9-tetrahydrocannabinol are neuroprotective antioxidants |journal=PNAS |volume=95 |pages=8268â73 |pmid=9653176 |date=July 1998 |accessdate=15 May 2011 |issue=14 |pmc=20965 |doi=10.1073/pnas.95.14.8268 |bibcode=1998PNAS...95.8268H}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[THC]] is believed to interact with parts of the brain normally controlled by the [[endogenous]] cannabinoid [[neurotransmitter]], [[anandamide]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid1470919&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal |author = Devane WA, Hanus L, Breuer A, Pertwee RG, Stevenson LA, Griffin G, Gibson D, Mandelbaum A, Etinger A, Mechoulam R |title = Isolation and structure of a brain constituent that binds to the cannabinoid receptor |journal = Science |volume = 258 |issue = 5090 |pages = 1946â1949 |year = 1992 |month = December |pmid = 1470919 |doi = 10.1126/science.1470919}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;isbn0-12-551460-3&quot;&gt;{{Cite book| author = Mechoulam R, Fride E|editor = Pertwee RG|title = Cannabinoid receptors|publisher = Academic Press|location = Boston|year = 1995|pages = 233â258|chapter = The unpaved road to the endogenous brain cannabinoid ligands, the anandamides|isbn = 0-12-551460-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anandamide is believed to play a role in pain sensation, memory, and sleep.

===Cannabidiol===

{{Main|Cannabidiol}}
[[Cannabidiol]] (CBD), is a major constituent of medical cannabis. CBD represents up to 40% of [[extract]]s of the medical cannabis plant.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grlie_1976&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

==Pharmacologic THC and THC derivatives==
In the USA, the FDA has approved several cannabinoids for use as medical therapies: [[dronabinol]] (Marinol) and [[nabilone]]. These medicines are taken orally.

These medications are usually used when first line treatments for nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy fail to work. In extremely high doses and in rare cases &quot;[[psychotomimetic]]&quot; side effects are possible. The other commonly used antiemetic drugs are not associated with these side effects.

Canasol is a cannabis-based medication for glaucoma that relieves [[intraocular pressure]] symptoms associated with late-stage glaucoma.

It was created by an optomologist, Dr. Albert Lockhart and Dr. Manley E. West, and began distribution in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;M E West and J Homi.  &quot;Cannabis as a medicine.&quot;  Br. J. Anaesth.

==Criticism==
One of the major criticisms of cannabis as medicine is opposition to smoking as a method of consumption. However, smoking is no longer necessary due to the development of healthier methods. Today, medicinal marijuana patients can use vaporizers, where the essential marijuana compounds are extracted and inhaled. This is somewhat similar to steaming vegetables to avoid cancerous by-products that are produced at higher temperatures. In addition, edible marijuana, which is produced in various baked goods, is also available, and has demonstrated longer lasting effects.

The United States [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) issued an advisory against ''smoked'' medical marijuana stating that, &quot;marijuana has a high potential for abuse, has no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and has a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision. Furthermore, there is currently sound evidence that smoked marijuana is harmful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;InterAgency&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Inter-Agency Advisory Regarding Claims That Smoked Marijuana Is a Medicine |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|Food and Drug Administration]] |date=20 April 2006 |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/2006/ucm108643.htm |accessdate=9 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Institute on Drug Abuse  [[NIDA]] state that &quot;Marijuana itself is an unlikely medication candidate for several reasons: (1) it is an unpurified plant containing numerous chemicals with unknown health effects; (2) it is typically consumed by smoking further contributing to potential adverse effects; and (3) its cognitive impairing effects may limit its utility&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nida.nih.gov/tib/marijuana.html |title=Nida: Marijuana, An update from the National Institute on Drug Abuse |publisher=Nida.nih.gov |year=2011 |month=February |accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of Medicine]], run by the [[United States National Academy of Sciences]], conducted a comprehensive study in 1999 to assess the potential health benefits of cannabis and its constituent cannabinoids. The study concluded that smoking cannabis is not recommended for the treatment of any disease condition, but did conclude that nausea, appetite loss, pain and anxiety can all be mitigated by marijuana. While the study expressed reservations about smoked marijuana due to the health risks associated with smoking, the study team concluded that until another mode of ingestion was perfected that could provide the same relief as smoked marijuana, there was no alternative. In addition, the study pointed out the inherent difficulty in marketing a non-patentable herb. Pharmaceutical companies will not substantially profit unless there is a patent. For those reasons, the Institute of Medicine concluded that there is little future in smoked cannabis as a medically approved medication.

==Harm reduction==
[[File:Aspergillus.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]'']]
The harm caused by smoking can be minimized or eliminated by the use of a vaporizer&lt;ref name=&quot;vap&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maps.org/mmj/vaporizer.html |title=MAPS/CaNORML vaporizer and waterpipe studies |publisher=Maps.org |accessdate=2009-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[ingesting]] the drug in an [[cannabis foods|edible form]]. 
Vaporizers are devices that heat the [[cannabinoids|active constituents]] to a temperature below the ignition point of the cannabis, so that their vapors can be inhaled. Combustion of plant material is avoided, thus preventing the formation of carcinogens such as [[polyaromatic hydrocarbons]], [[benzene]] and [[carbon monoxide]]. A pilot study led by Donald Abrams of [[University of California, San Francisco|UC San Francisco]] showed that vaporizers eliminate the release of irritants and toxic compounds, while delivering equivalent amounts of THC into the bloodstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Abrams DI, Vizoso HP, Shade SB, Jay C, Kelly ME, Benowitz NL |title=Vaporization as a smokeless cannabis delivery system: a pilot study |journal=Clinical Pharmacology and Therapeutics |volume=82 |issue=5 |pages=572â8 |year=2007 |pmid=17429350 |doi=10.1038/sj.clpt.6100200}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancient China and Taiwan===

Cannabis, called ''mÃ¡'' [[wikt: éº»|éº»]] (meaning &quot;hemp; cannabis; numbness&quot;) or ''dÃ mÃ¡'' [[Wikt:å¤§éº»|å¤§éº»]] (with &quot;big; great&quot;) in [[Chinese (language)|Chinese]], was used in [[Taiwan]] for fiber starting about 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=Ernest L. |last=Abel |year=1980 |chapter=Cannabis in the Ancient World |chapterurl=http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/hemp/history/first12000/1.htm |title=Marihuana: the first twelve thousand years |publisher=Plenum Publishers |location=[[New York City]] |isbn=978-0-306-40496-2}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The botanist Li Hui-Lin wrote that in China, &quot;The use of Cannabis in medicine was probably a very early development. Since ancient men used hemp seed as food, it was quite natural for them to also discover the medicinal properties of the plant.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Li, Hui-Lin (1974). &quot;An Archaeological and Historical Account of Cannabis in China&quot;, ''Economic Botany'' 28.4:437â448, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest Chinese pharmacopeia, the (ca. 100 CE) ''[[Shennong Bencaojing]]'' ç¥è¾²æ¬èç¶ (&quot;[[Shennong]]'s [[Materia Medica]] Classic&quot;), describes ''dama'' &quot;cannabis&quot;.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The flowers when they burst (when the pollen is scattered) are called éº»è¡ [''mafen''] or éº»å [''mabo'']. The best time for gathering is the 7th day of the 7th month. The seeds are gathered in the 9th month. The seeds which have entered the soil are injurious to man. It grows in [[Mount Tai|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Taishan]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] (in [[Shandong|&lt;nowiki&gt;[Shandong]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]] ...). The flowers, the fruit (seed) and the leaves are [[officinal]]. The leaves and the fruit are said to be poisonous, but not the flowers and the kernels of the seeds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Emil Bretschneider|Bretschneider, Emil]] (1895).

In the early 3rd century CE, [[Hua Tuo]] was the first person known to use cannabis as an [[anesthesia|anesthetic]]. He reduced the plant to powder and mixed it with wine for administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=de Crespigny |first=Rafe |year=2007 |title=A Biographical Dictionary of Later Han to the Three Kingdoms (23â220 CE) |location=[[Leiden]] |publisher=[[Brill Publishers]] |isbn=978-90-04-15605-0 |page=332 |oclc=71779118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth Wayland Barber says the Chinese evidence &quot;proves a knowledge of the narcotic properties of ''Cannabis'' at least from the 1st millennium B.C.&quot; when ''ma''  was already used in a secondary meaning of &quot;numbness; senseless.&quot; &quot;Such a strong drug, however, suggests that the Chinese pharmacists had now obtained from far to the southwest not THC-bearing ''Cannabis sativa'' but ''Cannabis indica'', so strong it knocks you out cold.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, Elizabeth Wayland.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Every part of the hemp plant is used in medicine; the dried flowers (å), the [[Achene|achenia]] (è¡), the seeds (éº»ä»), the oil (éº»æ²¹), the leaves, the stalk, the root, and the juice. The flowers are recommended in the 120 different forms of (é¢¨ ''feng'') disease, in menstrual disorders, and in wounds. The achenia, which are considered to be poisonous, stimulate the nervous system, and if used in excess, will produce hallucinations and staggering gait. They are prescribed in nervous disorders, especially those marked by local anaesthesia. The seeds, by which is meant the white kernels of the achenia, are used for a great variety of affections, and are considered to be tonic, demulcent, alterative, laxative, [[emmenagogue]], diuretic, [[anthelmintic]], and corrective. They are made into a congee by boiling with water, mixed with wine by a particular process, made into pills, and beaten into a paste. A very common mode of exhibition, however, is by simply eating the kernels. It is said that their continued use renders the flesh firm and prevents old age. They are prescribed internally in fluxes, post-partum difficulties, aconite poisoning, vermillion poisoning, constipation, and obstinate vomiting. Externally they are used for eruptions, ulcers, [[favus]], wounds, and falling of the hair. The oil is used for falling hair, sulfur poisoning, and dryness of the throat. The leaves are considered to be poisonous, and the freshly expressed juice is used as an anthelmintic, in scorpion stings, to stop the hair from falling out and to prevent it from turning grey. They are especially thought to have antiperiodic properties. The stalk, or its bark, is considered to be diuretic, and is used with other drugs in gravel. The juice of the root is used for similar purposes, and is also thought to have a beneficial action in retained placenta and post-partum hemorrhage. An infusion of hemp (for the preparation of which no directions are given) is used as a demulcent drink for quenching thirst and relieving fluxes.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Frederick Porter (1911).

===Ancient India===

Surviving texts from [[History of India|ancient India]] confirm that cannabis' psychoactive properties were recognized, and doctors used it for a variety of illnesses and ailments.

In humans, dried leaves of cannabis were used to treat nose bleeds, and cannabis seeds were used to expel tapeworms.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawthorne&quot;/&gt; The most frequently described use of cannabis in humans was to steep green seeds of cannabis in either water or wine, later taking the seeds out and using the warm extract to treat inflammation and pain resulting from obstruction of the ear.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawthorne&quot;/&gt;

In the 5th century BCE [[Herodotus]], a Greek historian, described how the [[Scythians]] of the Middle East used cannabis in steam baths.&lt;ref name=&quot;hawthorne&quot;/&gt;

Patani from Asia are primary natural producers of the [[diuretic]], [[antiemetic]], [[antiepileptic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[Analgesic|pain killing]] and [[antipyretic]] properties of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'', and used it extensively for 'Kopi Kapuganja' and 'Pecel Ganja', as recreation food, drinks and relaxing medication for centuries.

===Medieval Islamic world===

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Islamic world]], [[Islamic medicine|Arabic physicians]] made use of the [[diuretic]], [[antiemetic]], [[antiepileptic]], [[anti-inflammatory]], [[Analgesic|pain killing]] and [[antipyretic]] properties of ''[[Cannabis sativa]]'', and used it extensively as medication from the 8th to 18th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Lozano, Indalecio |year=2001 |title=The Therapeutic Use of Cannabis sativa (L.) in Arabic Medicine |journal=Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=63â70 |doi=10.1300/J175v01n01_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern history==
An Irish physician, [[William Brooke O'Shaughnessy]], is credited with introducing the therapeutic use of cannabis to Western medicine. He was Assistant-Surgeon and Professor of Chemistry at the Medical College of [[Calcutta]], and conducted a cannabis experiment in the 1830s, first testing his preparations on animals, then administering them to patients in order to help treat muscle spasms, stomach cramps or general pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

At the local level authorities introduced various laws that required the mixtures that contained cannabis, that was not sold on prescription, must be marked with warning labels under the so-called poison laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Chemist &amp; druggist |volume=28 |publisher=Benn Brothers |year=1886 |location=London, New York City, Melbourne |pages=68,330 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=qiPOAAAAMAAJ |title=Chemist &amp; druggist |unused_data=Chemists and poisons}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, researchers investigating methods of detecting cannabis intoxication discovered that smoking the drug reduced [[intraocular pressure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zauberpilz.com/golden/g31-40.htm |title=Golden Guide |work=www.zauberpilz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 the antibacterial effects were described at the [[PalackÃ½ University of Olomouc]]. Since 1971 [[LumÃ­r OndÅej HanuÅ¡]] was growing marijuana for his scientific research on two large fields in authority of the University.

In 1964, Dr. Albert Lockhart and Manley West began studying the health effects of traditional marijuana use in Jamaican communities. They discovered that Rastafarians had unusually low glaucoma rates and local fishermen were washing their eyes with cannibis extract in the belief that it would improve their sight. Lockhart and West developed, and in 1987 gained permission to market, the pharmaceutical [[Canasol]]: one of the first to cannabis extracts. They continued to work with cannabis throughout the years, developing more pharmaceuticals and eventually receiving the [[Jamaican Order of Merit]] for their work.&lt;ref name=&quot;FFY&quot;/&gt;

Later, in the 1970s, a [[chemical synthesis|synthetic]] version of [[THC]] was produced and approved for use in the United States as the drug [[Marinol]]. It was delivered as a capsule, to be swallowed. Patients complained that the violent nausea associated with chemotherapy made swallowing capsules difficult. Further, along with ingested cannabis, capsules are harder to [[titration|dose-titrate]] accurately than smoked cannabis because their onset of action is so much slower. Smoking has remained the route of choice for many patients because its onset of action provides almost immediate relief from symptoms and because that fast onset greatly simplifies titration. For these reasons, and because of the difficulties arising from the way cannabinoids are metabolized after being ingested, oral dosing is probably the least satisfactory route for cannabis administration.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lancet2003&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baker |first=D. |coauthors= Pryce, G., Giovannoni, G., Thompson, A.J. |year=2003 |title=The therapeutic potential of cannabis |journal=Lancet Neurology |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=291â98 |url=http://www.ukcia.org/research/TherapeuticPotentialOfCannabis.pdf |accessdate=15 August 2009 |doi=10.1016/S1474-4422(03)00381-8 |pmid=12849183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relatedly, some studies have indicated that at least some of the beneficial effects that cannabis can provide may derive from [[synergy]] among the multiplicity of cannabinoids and other chemicals present in the dried plant material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cannabis-med.org/data/pdf/2001-03-04-7.pdf |title=Cannabis and Cannabis Extracts: Greater Than the Sum of Their Parts? |author=McPartland, John M.; Russo, Ethan B. |work=Journal of Cannabis Therapeutics |publisher=International Association for Cannabis as Medicine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such synergy is, by definition, impossible with respect to the use of single-cannabinoid drugs like Marinol.

During the 1970s and 1980s, six U.S. states' health departments performed studies on the use of medical cannabis. These are widely considered some of the most useful and pioneering studies on the subject.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Voters in eight states showed their support for cannabis prescriptions or recommendations given by physicians between 1996 and 1999, including Alaska, Arizona, California, Colorado, Maine, Michigan, Nevada, Oregon, and Washington, going against policies of the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marijuana As Medicine |author=Mack,Alison ; Joy, Janet |publisher=National Academy Press |year=2001 |isbn=0309065313}}{{Page needed|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 7, 2003, a U.S. patent {{patent|US|6630507}} entitled &quot;Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants&quot; was awarded to the United States Department of Health and Human Services, based on research done at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH), and the [[National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke]] (NINDS). This patent claims that cannabinoids are &quot;useful in the treatment and prophylaxis of wide variety of oxidation associated diseases, such as ischemic, age-related, inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The cannabinoids are found to have particular application as neuroprotectants, for example in limiting neurological damage following ischemic insults, such as stroke and trauma, or in the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, such as [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[HIV dementia]].&quot;&lt;ref name=patent6630507&gt;{{US patent reference |number=6630507 |y=2003 |m=10 |d=07 |inventor=Hampson, Aidan J.; Axelrod, Julius; Grimaldi, Maurizio |title=Cannabinoids as antioxidants and neuroprotectants}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patentstorm.us/patents/6630507/fulltext.html Cannabinoids as Antioxidants and Neuroprotectants], U.S. patent 6630507 at Patentstorm web site.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Legal and medical status of cannabis}}

Cannabis is in Schedule IV of the [[United Nations]]Â´ [[Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs]], making it subject to special restrictions. Article 2 provides for the following, in reference to Schedule IV drugs:&lt;ref name=&quot;Single Convention&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/conv/convention_1961_en.pdf|title=Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs, 1961 As amended by the 1972 Protocol|date=13 March 1961|work=[[International Narcotics Control Board]]|publisher=[[United Nations]]|pages=2â3|accessdate=17 August 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''A Party shall, if in its opinion the prevailing conditions in its country render it the most appropriate means of protecting the public health and welfare, prohibit the production, manufacture, export and import of, trade in, possession or use of any such drug except for amounts which may be necessary for medical and scientific research only, including clinical trials therewith to be conducted under or subject to the direct supervision and control of the Party.''}}

The convention thus allows countries to outlaw cannabis for all non-research purposes but lets nations choose to allow medical and scientific purposes if they believe total prohibition is not the most appropriate means of protecting health and welfare. The convention requires that states that permit the production or use of medical cannabis must operate a licensing system for all cultivators,manufacturers and distributors and ensure that the total cannabis market of the state shall not exceed that required &quot;for medical and scientific purposes.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Single Convention&quot;/&gt;

In [[Austria]] both Î&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC and pharmaceutical preparations containing Î&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC are listed in annex V of the Narcotics Decree (''Suchtgiftverordnung'').&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.ris.bka.gv.at/GeltendeFassung.wxe?Abfrage=Bundesnormen&amp;amp;Gesetzesnummer=10011053|title=Verordnung der Bundesministerin fÃ¼r Arbeit, Gesundheit und Soziales Ã¼ber den Verkehr und die Gebarung mit Suchtgiften â SV|year=2011|publisher=Bundesministerium fÃ¼r Arbeit, Gesundheit und Soziales|accessdate=25 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Compendial formulations are manufactured upon prescription according to the German ''Neues Rezeptur-Formularium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{De-icon}} {{Cite journal|last=Valenta|first=Claudia|year=2005|title=Magistrale Problem-Rezepturen| journal=Ãsterreichische Apothekerzeitung| publisher=Ãsterreichische Apotheker-Verlagsges.m.b.H.| location=Vienna| issue=5| url=http://www.oeaz.at/zeitung/3aktuell/2005/05/haupt/haupt5_2005rezept.html| accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NRF&quot;&gt;{{De icon}} {{Cite journal|last=ABDA â Bundesvereinigung Deutscher ApothekerverbÃ¤nde| date=21 April 2008| title=Rezepturhinweise: Dronabinol- und Cannabis-Zubereitungen| journal=Pharmazeutische Zeitung|publisher=Govi-Verlag Pharmazeutischer Verlag GmbH|location=Eschborn| url=http://www.pharmazeutische-zeitung.de/fileadmin/nrf/PDF/1-Dronabinol.pdf| format=PDF| accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===

In [[Canada]], the regulation on access to marijuana for medical purposes, established by [[Health Canada]] in July 2001, defines two categories of patients eligible for access to medical cannabis. Category 1 covers any symptoms treated within the context of providing compassionate [[Palliative care|end-of-life care]] or the symptoms associated with medical conditions listed below:
*severe pain and/or persistent muscle spasms from multiple sclerosis, from a spinal cord injury, from spinal cord disease,
*severe pain, cachexia, anorexia, weight loss, and/or severe nausea from cancer or HIV/AIDS infection,
*severe pain from severe forms of arthritis, or
*seizures from epilepsy.
Category 2 is for applicants who have debilitating symptom(s) of medical condition(s), other than those described in Category 1. The application of eligible patients must be supported by a medical practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/dhp-mps/marihuana/about-apropos/faq-eng.php |title=Frequently Asked Questions â Medical Use of Marihuana |publisher=[[Health Canada]] |date=13 June 2005 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cannabis distributed by Health Canada is provided under the brand CannaMed by the company [[Prairie Plant Systems]] Inc. In 2006, 420&amp;nbsp;kg of CannaMed cannabis was sold, representing an increase of 80% over the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2006/10/23/prairie-plant.html |title=More pot, please: Demand booming for Prairie Plant's marijuana |publisher=[[CBC News]] |date=23 October 2006 |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, patients complain of the single strain selection as well as low potency, providing a pre-ground product put through a wood chipper (which deteriorates rapidly) as well as gamma irradation and foul taste and smell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Rielle |last=Capler |year=2007 |title=A Review of the Cannabis Cultivation Contract between Health Canada and Prairie Plant Systems |url=http://www.thecompassionclub.org/resources/HC_PPS_Contract_Report.pdf |publisher=British Columbia Compassion Club Society |accessdate=23 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also legal for patients approved by Health Canada to grow their own cannabis for personal consumption, and it's possible to obtain a production license as a person designated by a patient. Designated producers were permitted to grow a cannabis supply for only a single patient, however. That regulation and related restrictions on supply were found unconstitutional by the Federal Court of Canada in January, 2008. The court found that these regulations did not allow a sufficient legal supply of medical cannabis, and thus forced many patients to purchase their medicine from unauthorized, black market sources. This was the eighth time in the previous ten years that the courts ruled against Health Canada's regulations restricting the supply of the medicine.&lt;ref name=NationalPost_01&gt;{{Cite news| title=Court challenge aims to legalize all cannabis use; Advocates say previous rule a 'mockery'.| first=Shannon|last=Kari|newspaper=[[National Post]]|location=Toronto|id=ProQuest Newsstand, Document ID: 1739130721|date=June 1, 2009|page=A.6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May, 2009, Health Canada revised their earlier regulations to permit licensed, designated producers to grow cannabis for a maximum of two patients. The move was called a &quot;mockery&quot; of the court's intention by lawyer Ron Marzel, who represented plaintiffs in the successful challenge in Federal Court to Health Canada's previously existing rules. Marzel has announced plans to ask the court to overturn all prohibitions on cannabis use if Health Canada refuses to create regulations that will allow an adequate legal supply for use by medically-authorized patients.&lt;ref name=NationalPost_01/&gt;

In Canada there are four forms of medical marijuana. The first one is a cannabis extract called Sativex that contains THC and cannabidiol in a spray form. The second is a synthetic or manmade THC called dronabinol marketed as Marinol. The third also a synthetic version of THC called nabilone that is called Cesamet on the markets. The fourth product is the herbal form of cannabis often referred to as marijuana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collet|first=J.P|coauthors=Shapiro, S., Tongtong, W., &amp; Ware, M.

===Germany===

In [[Germany]] dronabinol was rescheduled 1994 from annex I to annex II of the Narcotics Law (''BetÃ¤ubungsmittelgesetz'') in order to ease research; in 1998 dronabinol was rescheduled from annex II to annex III and since then has been available by prescription,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grotenhermen |first=Franjo |month=Spring |year=2002 |title=The Medical Use of Cannabis in Germany |journal=Journal of Drug Issues |volume=32 |issue=2 |pages=607â34 |url=http://www.ncjrs.gov/App/Publications/abstract.aspx?ID=200785}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas Î&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;-THC is still listed in annex I.&lt;ref&gt;{{De icon}} {{cite web|url=http://bundesrecht.juris.de/bundesrecht/btmg_1981/gesamt.pdf|title=Gesetz Ã¼ber den Verkehr mit BetÃ¤ubungsmitteln (BetÃ¤ubungsmittelgesetz â BtMG)|date=19 January 2009|publisher=Bundesministerium der Justiz|accessdate=30 July 2009|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing instructions for dronabinol containing compendial formulations are described in the ''Neues Rezeptur-Formularium''.&lt;ref name=&quot;NRF&quot;/&gt;

===Spain===

In [[Spain]], since the late 1990s and early 2000s, medical cannabis underwent a process of progressive decriminalization and legalisation. The parliament of the region of [[Catalonia]] is the first in Spain have voted unanimously in 2001 legalizing medical marijuana, it is quickly followed by parliaments of [[Aragon]] and the [[Balearic Islands]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Spanish Penal Code prohibits the sale of cannabis but it does not prohibit consumption (although consumption on the street is fined). Until early 2000, the Penal Code did not distinguish between therapeutic use of cannabis and recreational use, however, several court decisions show that this distinction is increasingly taken into account by the judges. From 2006, the sale of seed is legalized,{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} the sale and public consumption remains illegal, and private cultivation and use are permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Hidalgo, Susana. &quot;El debate sobre el cannabis no espabila.&quot; [[PÃºblico (Spain)|PÃºblico.es]] [http://translate.google.com/translate?js=y&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=es&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.publico.es%2Fespana%2F205176%2Fdebate%2Fcannabis%2Fespabila&amp;sl=es&amp;tl=en&amp;history_state0=es|en|Ley%2520Corcuera]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perez&gt;PÃ©rez-Lanzac C.

Several studies have been conducted to study the effects of cannabis on patients suffering from diseases like cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, seizures or asthma. This research was conducted by various Spanish agencies at the Universidad Complutense de Madrid headed by Manuel Guzman, the hospital of La Laguna in Tenerife led neurosurgeon Luis GonzÃ¡lez Feria or the [[University of Barcelona]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Several cannabis consumption clubs and user associations have been established throughout Spain. These clubs, the first of which was created in 1991, are non-profit associations who grow cannabis and sell it at cost to its members. The legal status of these clubs is uncertain: in 1997, four members of the first club, the Barcelona RamÃ³n Santos Association of Cannabis Studies, were sentenced to 4 months in prison and a 3000 euro fine, while at about the same time, the court of Bilbao ruled that another club was not in violation of the law. The Andalusian regional government also commissioned a study by criminal law professors on the &quot;Therapeutic use of cannabis and the creation of establishments of acquisition and consumption. The study concluded that such clubs are legal as long as they distribute only to a restricted list of legal adults, provide only the amount of drugs necessary for immediate consumption, and not earn a profit. The Andalusian government never formally accepted these guidelines and the legal situation of the clubs remains insecure. In 2006 and 2007, members of these clubs were acquitted in trial for possession and sale of cannabis and the police were ordered to return seized crops.&lt;ref name=Perez/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the [[United Kingdom]], if you are arrested or taken to court for possession of cannabis, you are asked if there are any mitigating factors to explain why it is in your possession. It is unknown whether this is solely a formality, or if an excuse of medical usage has ever been used successfully to reduce the penalty issued. However, in the [[United Kingdom]], possession of small quantities of cannabis does not usually warrant an arrest or court appearance (street cautions or fines are often given out instead). Under UK law, certain cannabinoids are permitted medically,&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=The Committee Office, House of Lords |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199798/ldselect/ldsctech/151/15106.htm |title=House of Lords â Science and Technology â Ninth Report |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |accessdate=2010-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but these are strictly controlled with many provisos under the [[Misuse of drugs act 1971]] (in the 1985 amendments). The British Medical Associations official stance is &quot;users of cannabis for medical purposes should be aware of the risks, should enroll for clinical trials, and should talk to their doctors about new alternative treatments; but we do not advise them to stop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk&quot;/&gt;

On 19 October 2009 the US Deputy Attorney General issued a US Department of Justice memorandum to &quot;All United States Attorneys&quot; providing clarification and guidance to federal prosecutors in US States that have enacted laws authorizing the medical use of marijuana. The document is intended solely as &quot;a guide to the exercise of investigative and prosecutorial discretion and as guidance on resource allocation and federal priorities.&quot; The US Deputy Attorney General David W. Ogden provided seven criteria, the application of which acts as a guideline to prosecutors and federal agents to ascertain whether a patients use, or their caregivers provision, of medical marijuana &quot;represents part of a recommended treatment regiment consistent with applicable state law&quot;, and recommends against prosecuting patients using medical cannabis products according to state laws. Not applying those criteria, the Dep. Attorney General Ogden concludes, would likely be &quot;an inefficient use of limited federal resources&quot;. The memorandum does not change any laws. Sale of cannabis remains illegal under federal law. The [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]]'s position, that marijuana has no accepted value in the treatment of any disease in the United States, has also remained the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/opa/documents/medical-marijuana.pdf |title=19 October 2009; Office of the Deputy Attorney General, US Dept. of Justice, Washington D.C. 20530.

The [[Health and Human Services]] Division of the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] holds the [[patent]] {{patent|US|6630507}} for medical marijuana.
