==Previous Season==

[[2008 Buffalo Bulls football team|2008]] was a year of milestones for the UB Bulls: first winning season since rejoining FBS (formerly Division IA), first outright division championship, first conference championship and first [[bowl game]] appearance ([[2009 International Bowl]]). It was a season of close wins and close losses with six games being decided on the last play or in overtime. UB won four of those games and lost two.

UB stunned observers when they decisively defeated [[2008 Ball State Cardinals football team|Ball State]] 42-24 in the [[2008 MAC Championship Game]].  They went on to lose the International Bowl to [[2008 Connecticut Huskies football team|Connecticut]] 38-20.

Head coach [[Turner Gill]] signed a contract extension with the Bulls after being courted by [[Syracuse Orange football|Syracuse]] and [[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn]].

==Schedule and results==

2009 got off to a bad start for the Bulls as star running back James Starks injured the [[Glenoid labrum|labrum]] in his left shoulder in a pre-season scrimmage.  It was determined that he would need surgery and miss the whole year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bulls lose Starks to shoulder injury |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4421472 |date=2009-08-25 |publisher=ESPN.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because he was [[Redshirt (college sports)|redshirted]] his first year at UB, he will not be able to play again for the Bulls.

Buffalo's offense struggled to overcome the loss of Starks and the up-and-down play of new starting quarterback Zach Maynard while the defense continued to have a hard time stopping opposing teams and could not generate as many turnovers as they did in 2008.  Buffalo was out of MAC championship contention midway through the season, but did finish with two straight wins on the road.  After the season was over, Turner Gill accepted an offer to coach [[Kansas Jayhawks football|Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sources: Gill to coach at Kansas |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=4737280 |date=2009-12-12 |publisher=ESPN.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gill was replaced by [[Jeff Quinn (American football)|Jeff Quinn]].
