==Background==
Parliamentary elections for both houses of the [[Parliament of South Australia]] were held in [[South Australia]] in 1982, which saw [[John Bannon]] and the [[Australian Labor Party]] defeat the incumbent [[Liberal Party of Australia]] led by [[David Tonkin]], after one term in power.

As Premier, Tonkin combined fiscal conservatism with socially progressive reforms. In the former, Tonkin made significant cuts to the public service, earning him the enmity of the unions, while an example of the latter was the passage of the land rights bill and the return to the [[Pitjantjatjara people|Pitjantjatjara]] people of 10 per cent of South Australia's area.

Prior to the election, Tonkin removed [[Robin Millhouse]] (a former Liberal member who had defected to the [[Liberal Movement (Australia)|Liberal Movement]] and then the [[Australian Democrats]], and whose popularity enabled him to hold his seat of [[Electoral district of Waite|Waite]]) with an offer of a vacant seat in the Supreme Court[http://www2b.abc.net.au/news/forum/forum49/posts/topic734.shtm]. However the subsequent by-election saw the seat retained by Democrats candidate [[Heather Southcott]], although the Liberals claimed the seat at the 1982 general election.

One potential election factor was the [[copper]] and [[uranium]] mine at [[Olympic Dam]], near [[Roxby Downs]]. Enabling legislation had been passed earlier in 1982, despite the opposition of the Labor Party. In what was a controverisal move in Labor circles, Bannon defused this as an election issue by promising that development would go ahead under a Labor government (a commitment which was honoured), despite having previously opposed it.

The Liberals' chances were not made easier by the poor economic conditions prevalent in Australia in 1982.

After the election loss, Tonkin resigned as Liberal leader and was succeeded by [[John Olsen]], who won a leadership ballot against [[Dean Brown]]. A heart complaint caused Tonkin to leave parliament soon after.
