Ruby on Rails was extracted by [[David Heinemeier Hansson]] from his work on [[Basecamp (software)|Basecamp]], a project management tool by [[37signals]] (now a [[web application]] company).&lt;ref name=&quot;interview-davidhh&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Hansson first released Ruby on Rails as open source in July 2004, but did not share [[Commit (data management)|commit]] rights to the project until February 2005.&lt;ref name=core&gt;{{cite web

In August 2006 the framework reached a milestone when [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] announced that it would ship Ruby on Rails with [[Mac OS X]] [[Mac OS X v10.5|v10.5 &quot;Leopard&quot;]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
which was released in October 2007.

Ruby on Rails version 2.3 was released on March 15, 2009. Major new developments in Ruby on Rails include templates, engines, [[Rack (web server interface)|Rack]] and nested model forms. Templates enable the developer to generate a skeleton application with custom [[RubyGems|gems]] and configurations. Engines let one reuse application pieces complete with routes, view paths and models. The [[Rack (web server interface)|Rack]] web server interface and Metal allow one to write optimized pieces of code that route around ActionController.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rails 2.3: Templates, Engines, Rack, Metal, much more!&quot;&gt;{{cite web

On December 23, 2008, [[Merb]], another web application framework was launched, and Ruby on Rails announced a commitment to work together. The Ruby on Rails team announced they would work with the Merb project to bring &quot;the best ideas of Merb&quot; into Ruby on Rails 3, ending the &quot;unnecessary duplication&quot; across both communities.&lt;ref name =&quot;The day Merb joined Rails&quot;&gt;{{cite web|date=2008-12-27|title=The day Merb joined Rails|url=http://rubyonrails.com/merb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Merb was merged with Rails as part of the Rails 3.0 release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/3_0_release_notes.html Ruby on Rails 3.0 Release Notes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=sdtimes.com|date=2010-02-10|title=Ruby on Rails 3.0 goes modular|url=http://www.sdtimes.com/link/34122| accessdate=2010-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical overview== 
Like many web frameworks, Ruby on Rails uses the [[Model-View-Controller]] (MVC) architecture pattern to organize application programming.

Ruby on Rails includes tools that make common development tasks easier &quot;out of the box&quot;, such as [[Scaffold (programming)|scaffolding]] that can automatically construct some of the models and views needed for a basic [[website]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fairleads.blogspot.com/2007/12/rails-20-and-scaffolding-step-by-step.html There were quite a few changes in the 2.0 release, including the way that Ruby on Rails generates scaffolding code.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also included are [[WEBrick]], a simple Ruby web server that is distributed with Ruby, and [[Rake (software)|Rake]], a build system, distributed as a [[RubyGems | gem]]. Together with Ruby on Rails these tools provide a basic development environment.

Ruby on Rails relies on a [[web server]] to run it. [[Mongrel (web server)|Mongrel]] was generally preferred over WEBrick at the time of writing{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}, but it can also be run by [[Lighttpd]], [[Abyss Web Server|Abyss]], [[Apache (web server)|Apache]], [[nginx]] (either as a module - [[Phusion Passenger|Passenger]] for example - or via [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]], [[FastCGI]] or [[mod_ruby]]), and many others. From 2008 onwards, the Passenger web server replaced Mongrel as the most used web server for Ruby on Rails.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rubyonrails.org/deploy Official deployment instructions suggests use of Passenger]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruby on Rails is also noteworthy for its extensive use of the [[JavaScript]] libraries [[Prototype JavaScript Framework|Prototype]] and [[Script.aculo.us]] for [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/JavaScriptHelper.html Ruby on Rails includes the Prototype JavaScript framework and the Scriptaculous JavaScript controls and visual effects library.]&lt;/ref&gt; Ruby on Rails initially utilized lightweight [[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP]] for web services; this was later replaced by [[Representational State Transfer|RESTful]] [[web services]]. Ruby on Rails 3.0 uses a technique called [[Unobtrusive JavaScript]] to separate the functionality (or logic) from the structure of the web page.  [[jQuery]] is fully supported as a replacement for [[Prototype JavaScript Framework|Prototype]] and in Rails 3.1 is the default javascript library, reflecting an industry-wide move towards using jQuery.

Since version 2.0, Ruby on Rails by default offers both [[HTML]] and [[XML]] as output formats. The latter is the facility for RESTful web services.

The server uses embedded ruby in the HTML views with files having a html.erb extension.  Other templating methods are available such as HAML which removes much of the normal page 'clutter' (for example html '&lt;' and '&gt;' and ruby indent 'end's)

Ruby on Rails 2.3 relies on [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby 1.8.6]]. Ruby on Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and [[JRuby|JRuby 1.5.2+]]; earlier versions are not supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weblog.rubyonrails.org/2010/8/29/rails-3-0-it-s-done|title=Rails 3.0: It's ready!|publisher=rubyonrails.org|quote=Rails 3.0 has been designed to work with Ruby 1.8.7, Ruby 1.9.2, and JRuby 1.5.2+.|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework structure===
Ruby on Rails is separated into various packages, namely [[ActiveRecord (Rails)|ActiveRecord]] (an [[object-relational mapping]] system for database access), ActiveResource (provides web services), ActionPack, ActiveSupport and ActionMailer. Prior to version 2.0, Ruby on Rails also included the Action Web Service package that is now replaced by Active Resource. Apart from standard packages, developers can make [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] to extend existing packages.

===Deployment===

Ruby on Rails is often installed using [[RubyGems]], a package manager&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rubyonrails.org/download |title=Ruby on Rails: Download|publisher=RubyonRails.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is included with current versions of Ruby. Many [[Linux distribution]]s also support installation of Ruby on Rails and its dependencies through their native [[package management system]].

Ruby on Rails is typically deployed with a database server such as [[MySQL]] or [[PostgreSQL]], and a web server such as [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] running the [[Phusion Passenger]] module.

There are many Ruby on Rails hosting services such as [[Heroku]], [[Engine Yard]], and [http://railsplayground.com/ Rails Playground].

==Philosophy and design==
Ruby on Rails is intended to emphasize ''[[Convention over Configuration]]'' (CoC), and the rapid development principle of ''[[Don't Repeat Yourself]]'' (DRY).

&quot;Convention over Configuration&quot; means a developer only needs to specify unconventional aspects of the application. For example, if there is a class ''Sale'' in the model, the corresponding table in the database is called ''sales'' by default. It is only if one deviates from this convention, such as calling the table &quot;products sold&quot;, that the developer needs to write code regarding these names. Generally, Ruby on Rails conventions lead to less code and less repetition.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

&quot;Don't repeat yourself&quot; means that information is located in a single, unambiguous place. For example, using the [[ActiveRecord (Rails)|ActiveRecord]] module of Rails, the developer does not need to specify database column names in class definitions. Instead, Ruby on Rails can retrieve this information from the database based on the class name.

==Trademarks==
In March 2007, [[David Heinemeier Hansson]] filed three Ruby on Rails related [[trademark]] applications to the [[USPTO]]. These applications regard the phrase &quot;RUBY ON RAILS&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Trademark 77119206&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| title = &quot;Ruby on Rails&quot; Trademark Status

| title = &quot;Rails&quot; Trademark Status
| url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77119210

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the official Rails logo.&lt;ref name=&quot;Trademark 77119208&quot;&gt;{{cite web
| title = Rails Logo Trademark Status
| url = http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=77119208
| publisher = [[USPTO]]
| accessdate = 2007-08-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, in the summer of 2007, Hansson denied to [[Apress]] the permission to use the Ruby on Rails logo on the cover of a new Ruby on Rails book written by some authoritative community members. The episode gave rise to a polite protest in the Ruby on Rails community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Community criticism&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| last = Forde
| date = 2007-07-23
| title = Beginning Rails: From Novice to Professional
| url = http://rethink.unspace.ca/2007/7/23/beginning-rails-from-novice-to-professional

| title = David Heinemeier Hansson says No to Use of Rails Logo
| url = http://www.rubyinside.com/david-heinemeier-hansson-says-no-to-use-of-rails-logo-567.html
| accessdate = 2007-08-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this criticism, Hansson replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;I only grant promotional use [of the Rails logo] for products I'm directly involved with. Such as books that I've been part of the development process for or conferences where I have a say in the execution. I would most definitely seek to enforce all the trademarks of Rails.&lt;ref name=&quot;Community criticism&quot; /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
Rails running on [[Ruby MRI|Matz's Ruby Interpreter]] (the ''de facto'' reference interpreter for Ruby) had been criticized for issues with scalability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| publisher=radicalbehavior.com
| date = 2007-03-29
| title = 5 Question Interview with Twitter Developer Alex Payne
| quote=''By various metrics Twitter is the biggest Rails site on the net right now. Running on Rails has forced us to deal with scaling issues - issues that any growing site eventually contends with â far sooner than I think we would on another framework.''
| url = http://www.radicalbehavior.com/5-question-interview-with-twitter-developer-alex-payne/
| accessdate = 2009-07-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These critics often mentioned various [[Twitter]] outages in 2007 and 2008, which spurred Twitter's partial transition to [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]] (which runs on the [[Java Virtual Machine]]) for their [[Message queue|queueing system]] and other [[middleware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| publisher=artima.com
| author=Steve Jenson, Alex Payne, and Robey Pointer interview
| date = 2009-04-03
| title = Twitter on Scala
| url = http://www.artima.com/scalazine/articles/twitter_on_scala.html
| quote=''We had a Ruby-based queuing system that we used for communicating between the Rails front ends and the daemons, and we ended up replacing that with one written in Scala. The Ruby one actually worked pretty decently in a normal steady state, but the startup time and the crash behavior were undesirable.''
| accessdate = 2009-07-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| publisher=theregister.co.uk
| date = 2009-04-01
| title = Twitter jilts Ruby for Scala
| url = http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/04/01/twitter_on_scala/
| quote=''By the end of this year, Payne said, Twitter hopes to have its entire middleware infrastructure and its APIs ported to the new language. Ruby will remain, but only on the front end. &quot;We're still happy with Rails for building user facing features... performance-wise, it's fine for people clicking around web pages. It's the heavy lifting, asynchronous processing type of stuff that we've moved away from.&quot;''
| accessdate = 2009-07-18
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The user interface aspects of the site continue to run Ruby on Rails.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| author=ryan king
| date = 2009-09-25
