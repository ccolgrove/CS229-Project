As one of the major facilities to be built in the [[Manila]] campus of [[Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas]], the '''Thomasian Alumni Center''' is poised to serve as the meeting place of all members of the alumni in the Philippines and abroad.&lt;ref name=&quot;Father Rector's Message to USTMAA's 16th Grand Reunion&quot;&gt;[http://alumni.ust.edu.ph/events_read_content.php?id=201 Father Rector's Message to USTMAA's 16th Grand Reunion], Retrieved 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The center is conceived to house the individual alumni chapters of each faculty and college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Father Rector's Message to USTMAA's 16th Grand Reunion&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; 

The proposed site is the current location of UST's original [[gym|gymnasium]], which was the largest in the [[Philippines]] when it was built. Given its historic importance to UST, the gym's faÃ§ade will be kept&lt;ref name=&quot;Alumni Center, UST marker, 'Simbahayan' launched&quot;&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20100218/alumni_center_ust_marker_simbahayan_launched Alumni Center, UST marker, 'Simbahayan' launched], Retrieved 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and the entrance of the alumni center will be placed along [[UST Streets and Driveways|Tamayo Drive]]. The adjacent Olympic-sized swimming pool will also remain, yet refurbished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alumni Center, UST marker, 'Simbahayan' launched&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Visit of UST Rector in the United States ==
In June 2010, Fr. Rolando dela Rosa, O.P. visited the Thomasian Alumni based in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=&quot;UST Rector visits Thomasian Alumni in the US&quot;&gt;[http://www.asianjournal.com/community/community-news/5722-ust-rector-visits-thomasian-alumni-in-the-us.html UST Rector visits Thomasian Alumni in the US], Retrieved 10 February 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He addressed the members of the alumni in the U.S. particularly the Thomasian [[medical practitioners]] to invite them to come home and join the festivities for UST's quadricentennial anniversary. This happened during the 18th Annual Grand Reunion and Medical Convention of the UST Medical Alumni Association in America or USTMAAA. During the event, the UST Rector acknowledged the association's pledge of USD 1 million for the construction of the Thomasian Alumni Center. 

== Construction ==
The demolition of the original UST gymnasium started on April 6, 2011. The construction of the alumni center will commence once the original gymnasium had been demolished.&lt;ref name=&quot;78-year-old gymnasium demolished; paves way for construction of alumni center&quot;&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.net/news/20110516/78_year_old_gymnasium_demolished_paves_way_for_construction_of_alumni_center 78-year-old gymnasium demolished], Retrieved 23 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
