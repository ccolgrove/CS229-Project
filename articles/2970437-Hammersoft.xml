'''England's national Under-21 football team''', also known as '''[[England]] Under-21s''' or '''England U21(s)''', is considered to be the feeder team for the [[England national football team]].

This team is for English players aged under 21 at the start of the calendar year in which a two-year [[European Under-21 Football Championship]] campaign begins, so some players can remain with the squad until the age of 23. As long as they are eligible, players can play for England at any level, making it possible to play for the U21s, senior side, and again for the U21s, as [[Jack Wilshere]], [[Jordan Henderson]] and [[Danny Welbeck]] have done recently. It is also possible to play for one country at youth level and another at senior level (providing the player is eligible).

The U-21 team came into existence, following the realignment of [[UEFA]]'s youth competitions, in 1976.  A goalless draw in a [[Friendly match|friendly]] against [[Wales national under-21 football team|Wales]] at [[Wolverhampton Wanderers F.C.|Wolves']] [[Molineux stadium|Molineux Stadium]] was England U21s' first result.

England U21s do not have a permanent home.  They play in stadia dotted all around England, in an attempt to encourage younger fans in all areas of the country to get behind England.  Because of the smaller demand compared to the senior national team, smaller grounds can be used.  The record attendance for an England U21 match was set on 24 March 2007, when England U21 played Italy U21 in front of a crowd of just under 60,000 at the brand new [[Wembley Stadium]], also a world record attendance for a U21 game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6490655.stm BBC News â Wembley opener attracts thousands]&lt;/ref&gt; The match was one of the required two &quot;ramp up&quot; events the stadium hosted in order to gain its safety certificate in time for its full-capacity opening for the 2007 [[FA Cup Final]] in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/6441299.stm BBC News â Wembley game 'sold out' in hours]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/uklatest/story/0,,-6505159,00.html The Guardian â Early set-back on Wembley's big day]&lt;/ref&gt;

The original and most successful coach is [[Dave Sexton]], who led the U21s from 1977 to 1990. In this period he combined his duties with managing the top-flight clubs [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]] (1977â1981) and [[Coventry City F.C.|Coventry City]] (1981â1983). After Coventry he took a position within the FA as their first Technical Director, at Lilleshall.  He handed over U21 responsibilities to England manager [[Graham Taylor (footballer)|Graham Taylor]]'s assistant [[Lawrie McMenemy]] for three years before resuming control from 1994 to 1996.

[[Peter Taylor (footballer born 1953)|Peter Taylor]] took over in 1996 and, although never winning the tournament, his teams had an excellent record. He was controversially removed from the position in early 1999, however, and replaced initially by [[Peter Reid]], who resigned after just one match in charge to dedicate more time to his other job as manager of [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]]. [[Howard Wilkinson]] took over afterwards, yet could only produce four wins in ten competitive matches and quit after a year and a half in charge. [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] took charge after his departure from [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]]. Platt was U21 boss from 2001 to 2004, but had little success before Taylor's return. Taylor left in January 2007, as the senior national manager [[Steve McClaren]] wanted the U21s to have a full-time manager. Taylor, at the time, was combining his duties with his role as [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] boss.

On 1 February 2007, [[Manchester City F.C.|Manchester City]] manager [[Stuart Pearce]] was appointed as head coach on a part-time basis until after the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|European Championships]] in the summer of 2007. [[Nigel Pearson]], [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]]'s assistant manager, agreed to become Pearce's assistant. Their first match in charge was a 2â2 draw against [[Spain national under-21 football team|Spain]] on 6 February 2007 at [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]'s [[Pride Park Stadium]]. For the match against [[Italy national under-21 football team|Italy]] Nigel Pearson took charge as Stuart Pearce had club commitments. [[Steve Wigley]] assisted Pearson.

Pearce was dismissed as Manchester City manager on 14 May 2007, before the 2007 European Championships, but on 19 July 2007 he was named full-time U21s coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pearce named England U21 manager | work=BBC Sport | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/internationals/6906465.stm | accessdate=17 July 2007  | date=19 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; His contract was extended in the summer of 2009.

As a European U21 team, England compete for the [[European Under-21 Football Championship|European Championship]], with the finals every odd-numbered year, formerly even-numbered years. There is no Under-21 World Cup, although there is an [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|Under-20 World Cup]]. For the first six (1978â1988) European Under-21 Football Championships, England did well, getting knocked out in the semi-finals on four occasions and winning the competition in [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1982|1982]] and [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1984|1984]].  Then, as one might expect with a rapid turnover of players, followed a lean period.

After losing to [[France national under-21 football team|France]] in the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1988|1988]] semi final, England then failed to qualify for the last eight for five whole campaigns.  In the qualifying stages for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 1998|1998]] tournament, England won their group, but fate was not on their side.  Because there were nine groups, and only eight places, the two group-winning nations with worst records had to play-off to eliminate one of them.  England lost the away leg of this extra qualifying round and were eliminated on [[away goals rule|away goals]] to [[Greece national under-21 football team|Greece]].  In effect, England finished ninth in the competition despite losing only one of their ten matches.

England qualified for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2000|2000]] finals comfortably.  Under the 1996-appointed [[Peter John Taylor|Peter Taylor]] England won every match without conceding a goal.  But with 3 matches to play, Taylor was replaced in a controversial manner by [[Howard Wilkinson]], who won the next two matches.  The three goals conceded in the 3â1 defeat to group runners-up [[Poland national under-21 football team|Poland]] were the only blemish on the team's qualifying record. England got knocked out in the group stage of the European Championship finals in 2000 under Wilkinson.

After enlisting former international star [[David Platt (footballer)|David Platt]] as manager, England qualified for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2002|2002]] tournament in [[Switzerland]].  Again England did poorly in the group stage.  Platt's England failed to qualify for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2004|2004]] tournament and he was replaced by the returning Peter Taylor.  Taylor's England qualified from the group but lost to a strong [[France national under-21 football team|France]] team in a two-legged playoff and failed to qualify for the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2006|2006]] tournament.

The next campaign started shortly after the 2006 finals â the qualification stage of the [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2007|2007 competition]].  UEFA decided to shift the tournament forward to avoid a clash with senior tournaments taking place in even-numbered years.  The qualification stage was heavily reduced, being completed in a year's less time.  In a 3-team qualification group, England qualified over [[Switzerland national under-21 football team|Switzerland]] and [[Moldova national under-21 football team|Moldova]], and then won a two-legged play-off with [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] to qualify for the finals to be held in the [[Netherlands]]. At the tournament, England progressed through to the semi-finals where they led for the majority of the match against the hosts.  However, after a late equaliser and a marathon penalty shootout, England were eliminated.

In [[UEFA U-21 Championship 2009|2009]], England finished as runners-up, losing 4â0 to [[Germany national under-21 football team|Germany]] in the final.

England finished second in their qualifying group for the 2011 championships in Denmark. They subsequently defeated Romania in the play-offs to qualify for the finals tournament, where they were knocked out in the group stage after a 2-1 defeat to the Czech Republic. 

'''Note:''' The year of the tournament represents the year in which it ends.
