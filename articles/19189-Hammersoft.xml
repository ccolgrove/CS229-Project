The [[Seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]] that came to constitute Mumbai were home to communities of [[Kolis|fishing colonies]]. For centuries, the islands came under the control of successive [[History of Mumbai under indigenous empires|indigenous empires]] before being ceded to the [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese]] and subsequently to the [[British East India Company]]. During the mid-18th century, Mumbai was reshaped by the British with large-scale civil [[Hornby Vellard|engineering projects]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Dwivedi 2001 28&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Dwivedi|Mehrotra|2001|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and emerged as a significant trading town. Economic and educational development characterised the city during the 19th century. It became a strong base for the [[Indian independence movement]] during the early 20th century. When India became independent in 1947, the city was incorporated into [[Bombay State]]. In 1960, following the [[Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti|Samyukta Maharashtra movement]], a new state of [[Maharashtra]] was created with Bombay as capital. The city was renamed Mumbai in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It houses some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes like [[Bhabha Atomic Research Centre|BARC]], [[Nuclear Power Corporation of India|NPCL]], [[Indian Rare Earths Limited|IREL]], [[Tata Institute of Fundamental Research|TIFR]], [[Atomic Energy Regulatory Board|AERB]], [[Atomic Energy Commission of India|AECI]], and the [[Department of Atomic Energy (India)|Department of Atomic Energy]]. The city also houses India's [[Hindi film|Hindi]] ([[Bollywood]]) and [[Marathi cinema|Marathi]] [[Indian cinema|film and television industry]]. Mumbai's business opportunities, as well as its potential to offer a higher [[Standard of living in India|standard of living]], attract migrants from all over India and, in turn, make the city a [[potpourri]] of many communities and [[culture of India|cultures]].

==City name==
The name ''Mumbai'' is derived from ''Mumba'' or ''Maha-Amba''âthe name of the [[Koli]] goddess [[Mumbadevi]]âand ''Aai'', &quot;mother&quot; in the language of [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chittar|1973|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest known names for the city are ''Kakamuchee'' and ''Galajunkja''; these are sometimes still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Patel|Masselos|2003|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mehta|2004|p=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ali Muhammad Khan, in the ''Mirat-i-Ahmedi'' (1507) referred to the city as ''Manbai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shirodkar|1998|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1508, [[Portugal|Portuguese]] writer [[Gaspar Correia]] used the name ''Bombaim'', in his ''Lendas da Ãndia'' (&quot;Legends of India&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shirodkar|1998|pp=4â5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;et6yh&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yule|Burnell|1996|p=[http://books.google.com/books?id=20pdFRekGvMC&amp;pg=PA102 102]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This name possibly originated as the [[Galician-Portuguese|Old Portuguese]] phrase ''bom baim'', meaning &quot;good little bay&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirodkar 1998 7&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Shirodkar|1998|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bombaim'' is still commonly used in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ety&quot;/&gt; In 1516, Portuguese explorer [[Duarte Barbosa]] used the name ''Tana-Maiambu'': ''Tana'' appears to refer to the adjoining town of [[Thane]] and ''Maiambu'' to ''Mumbadevi''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shirodkar|1998|p=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mumbadevi temple.jpg|thumb|upright|The temple of local Hindu goddess [[Mumbadevi]], after whom the city of Mumbai derives its name]]
Other variations recorded in the 16th and the 17th centuries include: ''Mombayn'' (1525), ''Bombay'' (1538), ''Bombain'' (1552), ''Bombaym'' (1552), ''Monbaym'' (1554), ''Mombaim'' (1563), ''Mombaym'' (1644), ''Bambaye'' (1666), ''Bombaiim'' (1666), ''Bombeye'' (1676), and ''Boon Bay'' (1690).&lt;ref name=&quot;ety&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yule|Burnell|1996|p=[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=20pdFRekGvMC&amp;pg=PA103 103]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;etyh&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Yule|Burnell|1996|p=[http://books.google.co.in/books?id=20pdFRekGvMC&amp;pg=PA104 104]}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[British Empire|British]] gained possession of the city in the 17th century, the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] name was officially [[anglicise]]d as ''Bombay''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=6|Ref=bom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 20th century, the city was known as ''Mumbai'' or ''Mambai'' to Marathi language, [[Konkani language|Konkani]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Kannada language|Kannada]] and [[Sindhi language|Sindhi]] speakers and as ''Bambai'' in [[Hindi]], [[Persian language|Persian]] and [[Urdu]]. The English name was officially changed to ''Mumbai'' in November 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hansen|2001|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came at the insistence of the Marathi language nationalist Shiv Sena party that had just won the Maharashtra state elections and mirrored [[Renaming of cities in India|similar name changes across the country]].
A theory was proposed suggesting that &quot;Bombay&quot; was a corrupted English version of &quot;Mumbai&quot; and an unwanted legacy of British colonial rule. The push to rename Bombay was part of a larger movement to strengthen Marathi identity in the Maharashtra region. However, the city is still referred to as Bombay by some of its residents and Indians from other regions as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;mummaharashtra1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/asia/india/mumbai-bombay-and-maharashtra/more.html|title=Mumbai (Bombay) and Maharashtra|publisher=[[Fodor's]]|accessdate=24 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, mentions of the city by the name other than ''Mumbai'' have been controversial, resulting in emotional outbursts sometimes of a violently political nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/mumbai-vs-bombay/527660/0 |title=Mumbai vs Bombay |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-10-11 |accessdate=2011-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/65447/Cinema/Fruit+And+Nut:+Another+'Bombay'+controversy+brewing?.html |title=Fruit And Nut: Another 'Bombay' controversy brewing? |publisher=Indiatoday.intoday.in |date= |accessdate=2011-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A widespread popular etymology of ''Bombay'' holds that it was derived from a Portuguese name meaning &quot;good bay&quot;. This is based on the facts that ''bom'' is Portuguese for &quot;good&quot; and ''baÃ­a'' (or the archaic spelling ''bahia'') means &quot;bay&quot;. However, this [[literal translation]] would have been incorrect in [[grammatical gender]], as ''bom'' is masculine, while ''baia'' is feminine; a correct Portuguese rendering of &quot;good bay&quot; would be ''boa ba(h)ia''. Having said this, ''baim'' is an archaic, masculine word for &quot;little bay&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shirodkar 1998 7&quot;/&gt;

Portuguese scholar JosÃ© Pedro Machado in his ''DicionÃ¡rio OnomÃ¡stico EtimolÃ³gico da LÃ­ngua Portuguesa'' (1981; &quot;Portuguese Dictionary of Onomastics and Etymology&quot;), seems to reject the &quot;Bom Bahia&quot; hypothesis, suggesting that the presence of a bay was a coincidence (rather than a basis of the toponym) and led to a misconception, that the noun (''bahia''; &quot;bay&quot;) was an integral part of the Portuguese name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Machado|1984|pp=265â266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early history===
[[File:Kanheri-stupa1.jpg|thumb|upright|right|[[Kanheri Caves]] served as a centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient times|alt=A white Buddhist stupa.]]
Mumbai is built on what was once an archipelago of [[seven islands of Bombay|seven islands]]: [[Isle of Bombay|Bombay Island]], [[Parel]], [[Mazagaon]], [[Mahim]], [[Colaba]], [[Worli]], and [[Old Woman's Island]] (also known as ''Little Colaba'').&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Farooqui|2006|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is not exactly known when these islands were first inhabited. [[Pleistocene]] sediments found along the coastal areas around [[Kandivali]] in northern Mumbai by archaeologist Todd in 1939 suggest that the islands were inhabited since the [[South Asian Stone Age|Stone Age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ghosh|1990|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps at the beginning of the [[Common era]] (2000 years ago), or possibly earlier, they came to be occupied by the [[Kolis|Koli]] fishing community.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=5|Ref=bom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the third century BCE, the islands formed part of the [[Maurya]] Empire, during its expansion in the south, ruled by the Buddhist emperor, [[Ashoka]] of [[Magadha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|1995|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kanheri Caves]] in [[Borivali]] were excavated in the mid-third century BCE,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_tktd_maha_kanhericaves.asp|title=Kanheri Caves|publisher=[[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI)|accessdate=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and served as an important centre of Buddhism in Western India during ancient Times.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kumari|1990|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city then was known as ''Heptanesia'' ([[Ancient Greek]]: A Cluster of Seven Islands) to the Greek geographer [[Ptolemy]] in 150&amp;nbsp;CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|1973|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the second century BCE and ninth century CE, the islands came under the control of successive [[History of Mumbai under indigenous empires|indigenous dynasties]]: [[Satavahanas]], [[Western Kshatrapas]], [[Abhiras]], [[Vakatakas]], [[Kalachuri]]s, Konkan Mauryas, [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukyas]] and [[Rashtrakuta Dynasty|Rashtrakutas]],&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|pp=127â150|Ref=bom}}&lt;/ref&gt; before being ruled by the [[Silhara dynasty]] from 810 to 1260.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dwivedi|Mehrotra|2001|p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the oldest edifices in the city built during this period are, [[Jogeshwari Caves]] (between 520 to 525),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ldeo.columbia.edu/edu/eesj/gradpubs/GeneralMags/Patel_Archaeology_SlumandSacredCave_0607.pdf|title=The Slum and the Sacred Cave|page=5|accessdate=12 October 2008|publisher=Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory ([[Columbia University]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elephanta Caves]] (between the sixth to seventh century),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://asi.nic.in/asi_monu_whs_elephanta.asp|title=World Heritage Sites&amp;nbsp;â Elephanta Caves|publisher=Archaeological Survey of India|accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Walkeshwar Temple]] (10th century),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cities.expressindia.com/fullstory.php?newsid=101117|title=The Legends of Walkeshwar

[[Raja Bhimdev|King Bhimdev]] founded his kingdom in the region in the late 13th century, and established his capital in ''Mahikawati'' (present day [[Mahim]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dwivedi|Mehrotra|2001|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pathare Prabhu]]s, one of the earliest known settlers of the city, were brought to ''Mahikawati'' from [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in Gujarat around 1298 by Bhimdev.&lt;ref name=&quot;prabhu&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Maharashtra|2004|p=1703|Ref=prabhu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Delhi Sultanate]] annexed the islands in 1347â48, and controlled it till 1407. During this time, the islands were administered by the Muslim Governors of [[Gujarat]], who were appointed by the Delhi Sultanate.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|1973|p=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|1995|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Hajiali.jpg|thumb|The [[Haji Ali Dargah]] was built in 1431, when Mumbai was under the rule of the [[Gujarat Sultanate]]]]
The islands were later governed by the independent [[Gujarat Sultanate]], which was established in 1407. The Sultanate's patronage led to the construction of many mosques, prominent being the [[Haji Ali Dargah]] in [[Worli]], built in honour of the Muslim saint [[Haji Ali]] in 1431.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Khalidi|2006|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1429 to 1431, the islands were a source of contention between the Gujarat Sultanate and the [[Bahamani Sultanate]] of Deccan.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Misra|1982|p=193|Ref=misra}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mis&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Misra|1982|p=222|Ref=misra}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1493, [[Bahadur Khan Gilani]] of the Bahamani Sultanate attempted to conquer the islands, but was defeated.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|David|1973|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the treaty, the seven islands of Bombay, the nearby strategic town of [[Vasai|Bassein]] and its dependencies were offered to the Portuguese. The territories were later surrendered on 25 October 1535.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=166|Ref=bom}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Portuguese were actively involved in the foundation and growth of their Roman Catholic religious orders in Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=169|Ref=bom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ships in Bombay Harbour, 1731.jpg|thumb|right|Ships in [[Bombay Harbour]] (c. 1731). Bombay emerged as a significant trading town during the mid-18th century.]]
From 1782 onwards, the city was reshaped with large-scale civil engineering projects aimed at merging all the seven islands into a single amalgamated mass. This project, known as [[Hornby Vellard]], was completed by 1784.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dwivedi 2001 28&quot;/&gt; In 1817, the British East India Company under [[Mountstuart Elphinstone]] defeated [[Baji Rao II]], the last of the Maratha ''Peshwa'' in the [[Battle of Khadki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Naravane|2007|pp=80â82}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his defeat, almost the whole of the Deccan came under British suzerainty, and were incorporated in Bombay Presidency. The success of the British campaign in the Deccan witnessed the freedom of Bombay from all attacks by native powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Greater Bombay District Gazetteer|1960|p=233|Ref=bom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1845, the seven islands were coalesced into a single landmass by the Hornby Vellard project.&lt;ref name=&quot;mumfact&quot;/&gt; On 16 April 1853, India's first passenger railway line was established, connecting Bombay to the neighbouring town of [[Thane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dwivedi|Mehrotra|2001|p=127}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[American Civil War]] (1861â1865), the city became the world's chief cotton trading market, resulting in a boom in the economy that subsequently enhanced the city's stature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dwivedi|Mehrotra|2001|p=343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After India's independence in 1947, the territory of the Bombay Presidency retained by India was restructured into [[Bombay State]]. The area of Bombay State increased, after several erstwhile princely states that joined the Indian union were integrated into the state. Subsequently, the city became the capital of Bombay State.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Census of India|1961|p=23|Ref=cent}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 1950, Municipal limits of Bombay were expanded by merging the [[Mumbai suburban district|Bombay Suburban District]] and [[Mumbai city district|Bombay City]] to form Greater Bombay Municipal Corporation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mumbaisuburban.gov.in/html/administrative_setup.htm|title=Administration|accessdate=6 November 2008|publisher=[[Mumbai Suburban District]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samyukta Maharashtra movement]] to create a separate Maharashtra state including Bombay was at its height in the 1950s.

Mumbai, extending from [[Colaba]] in the south, to [[Mulund]] and [[Dahisar]] in the north, and [[Mankhurd]] in the east, is administered by the [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation]] (BMC).&lt;ref name=&quot;mloc&quot;/&gt; The [[Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation|BMC]] is in charge of the civic and infrastructure needs of the metropolis.&lt;ref name=&quot;mcmmm&quot;/&gt; The Mayor is usually chosen through indirect election by the councillors from among themselves for a term of two and half years.

The Municipal Commissioner is the chief Executive Officer and head of the executive arm of the Municipal Corporation. All executive powers are vested in the [[Municipal Commissioner of Mumbai|Municipal Commissioner]] who is an [[Indian Administrative Service]] (IAS) officer appointed by the [[Maharashtra#Government|state government]]. Although the Municipal Corporation is the legislative body that lays down policies for the governance of the city, it is the Commissioner who is responsible for the execution of the policies. The Commissioner is appointed for a fixed term as defined by state statute. The powers of the Commissioner are those provided by statute and those delegated by the Corporation or the Standing Committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.citymayors.com/government/india_government.html|title=Commissioner System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Mumbai Police]] is headed by a [[Police Commissioner of Mumbai|Police Commissioner]], who is an [[Indian Police Service]] (IPS) officer. The Mumbai Police comes under the state Home Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Office of the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai|p=2|Ref=mp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is divided into seven police zones and seventeen [[Mumbai traffic police|traffic police]] zones,&lt;ref name=&quot;trf&quot;/&gt; each headed by a Deputy Commissioner of Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Office of the Commissioner of Police, Mumbai|pp=7â8|Ref=mp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Traffic Police is a semi-autonomous body under the Mumbai Police.

[[File:1st INC1885.jpg|thumb|First session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in Bombay (28â31 December 1885)|alt=Men in traditional Indian dresses posing for a photograph]]
Mumbai has been a traditional stronghold and birthplace of the [[Indian National Congress]], also known as the Congress Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|100 glorious years: Indian National Congress, 1885â1985|loc=p. 4, &quot;The centenary of the Indian National Congress, which is being celebrated at its birthplace Bombay, is a unique event.&quot;|Ref=cng}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28â31 December 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2006/12/29/stories/2006122906471500.htm|title=Congress foundation day celebrated|date=29 December 2006|accessdate=12 November 2008|publisher=The Hindu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city played host to the Indian National Congress six times during its

The 1960s saw the rise of regionalist politics in Bombay, with the formation of the [[Shiv Sena]] on 19 June 1966, out of a feeling of resentment about the relative marginalisation of the native [[Marathi people]] in Bombay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/msid-1311115,prtpage-1.cms|title=Sena fate: From roar to meow|accessdate=12 November 2008|date=29 November 2005|publisher=The Times of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party headed a campaign to expel [[South Indian]] and [[North Indian]] migrants by force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=13 February 2008|url=http://www.hindu.com/2008/02/13/stories/2008021354841200.htm|accessdate=4 April 2008|publisher=The Hindu|title=Maharashtra government âsoftâ on Raj Thackerayâs outfit, says BJP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Congress had dominated the politics of Bombay from independence until the early 1980s, when the Shiv Sena won the 1985 Bombay municipal corporation elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Phadnis|pp=86â87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP), a major national political party, forged an electoral alliance with the Shiv Sena to dislodge the Congress in the Maharashtra [[Vidhan Sabha|Legislative Assembly]] elections. In 1999, the [[Nationalist Congress Party]] (NCP) separated from the Congress, but later allied with the Congress, to form a joint venture known as the [[Democratic Front (India)|Democratic Front]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rana|2006|pp=315â316}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, other parties such as [[Maharashtra Navnirman Sena]] (MNS), [[Samajwadi Party]] (SP), [[Bahujan Samaj Party]] (BSP), and several independent candidates also contest elections in the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.outlookindia.com/item.aspx?659150|date=29 April 2009|work=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]]|title=Stage Set for Third Phase Polls in Maharashtra

According to the 2011 census, the population of Mumbai was 12,479,608,. The population density is estimated to be about 20,482 persons per square kilometre. As Per 2011 census, Greater Mumbai, the area under the administration of the BMC, has a literacy rate of 94.7 %, higher than the national average of 86.7%.

The sex ratio was 838 (females per 1,000 males) in the island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the national average of 914 females per 1,000 males.&lt;ref name=&quot;populationindia.wordpress.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://populationindia.wordpress.com/2011/04/24/population-of-mumbai/ |title=Population of Mumbai &quot; PopulationIndia.com |publisher=Populationindia.wordpress.com |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=1 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The low sex ratio is partly because of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/843036.cms|title=Parsis top literacy, sex-ratio charts in city|date=8 September 2004|publisher=The Times of India|accessdate=2 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Residents of Mumbai call themselves ''[[Mumbaikar]]'', ''Mumbaiite'' or ''Bombayite''. Mumbai has a large polyglot population like any other [[Status of Indian cities|metropolitan city]] of India. Marathi, the official language of Maharashtra state, of which Mumbai is the capital, is widely spoken and understood in the city. Sixteen major [[languages of India]] are also spoken in Mumbai, most common being Marathi, [[Hindi language|Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pai|2005|p=1804}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[English language|English]] is extensively spoken and is the principal language of the city's [[White-collar worker|white collar]] workforce. A colloquial form of Hindi, known as ''[[Bambaiya]]'' â a blend of Marathi, [[Hindi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]], [[Konkani]], [[Urdu]], [[Indian English]] and some invented words â is spoken on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|O'Brien|2003|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumbai suffers from the same major urbanisation problems seen in many fast growing cities in [[developing countries]]: widespread poverty and unemployment, poor public health and poor civic and educational standards for a large section of the population. With available space at a premium, Mumbai residents often reside in cramped, relatively expensive housing, usually far from workplaces, and therefore requiring long commutes on crowded mass transit, or clogged roadways. Many of them live in close proximity to bus or train stations although suburban residents spend significant time travelling southward to the main commercial district.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Datta|Jones|1999|loc=Low-Income Households and the Housing Problem in Mumbai, pp. 158â159}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dharavi]], Asia's second largest [[slum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobson|first=Marc|title= Dharavi: Mumbai's Shadow City| url= http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2007/05/dharavi-mumbai-slum/jacobson-text| work=[[National Geographic Magazine]]|month=May|year=2007|accessdate=28 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is located in central Mumbai and houses 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Davis|2006|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a literacy rate of 69%, the slums in Mumbai are the most literate in [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/mumbai/report_mumbai-s-slums-are-india-s-most-literate_1015111 |title=Mumbaiâs slums are Indiaâs most literate â Mumbai â DNA |publisher=Dnaindia.com |date=27 February 2006 |accessdate=16 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mumbai's culture is a blend of traditional festivals, food, music and theatres. The city offers a cosmopolitan and diverse lifestyle with a variety of food, entertainment and night life, available in a form and abundance comparable to that in other world capitals. Mumbai's history as a major trading centre has led to a diverse range of cultures, religions and cuisines coexisting in the city. This unique blend of cultures is due to the migration of people from all over India since the British period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.maharashtra.gov.in/english/community/community_citiesShow.php
