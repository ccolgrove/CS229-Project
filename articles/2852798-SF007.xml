It can be used standalone or combined with other tools and frameworks.  It is often used for [[server-side scripting]] and [[dynamic web content]] by generating [[HTML]], but can also be used to [[Automatic programming|generate source code]].  Cheetah is [[open-source software]] licensed under the [[MIT License]].

[[Templating engine]]s encourage clean separation of content, graphic design, and program code. This leads to more modular, flexible, and reusable site architectures, shorter development time, and code that is easier to understand and maintain.

Cheetah compiles templates into optimized, yet readable, Python code.  It gives template authors full access to any Python data and functionality, while providing a way for administrators to selectively restrict access to Python when needed.

Cheetah is included in [[FreeBSD]] and several [[Linux]] distributions: [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[Debian]], and [[Ubuntu Linux|Ubuntu]] among others.
