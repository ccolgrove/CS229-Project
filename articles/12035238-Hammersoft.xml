'''891 ABC Adelaide''' (call sign: '''5AN''') is the [[ABC Local Radio]] station for [[Adelaide]].  It is broadcast at 891&amp;nbsp;kHz on the AM band.
==History==
5AN started transmitting in 15 October 1937 with equipment located in the central telephone exchange, and a radio mast located in Post Office Place.  The station transmitter moved to [[Brooklyn Park, South Australia|Brooklyn Park]], the site of [[5CL]] on 4 May 1944.  The radio mast was moved from the east side of the building to the south side to make way for an airport road in 1952.  The airport made the transmitter site inconvenient so it was moved to [[Pimpala]], and opened on 20 September 1961 by Postmaster-General C W Davidson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webcat.wtcc.sa.gov.au/hipres/images/lhimages/641-2.pdf|title=The 5CL â 5AN transmitter site at Brooklyn Park|author=Barrie Brice|date=October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC radio staff relocated to an eight story building in [[Collinswood, South Australia|Collinswood]] in 1974.  In the 1980s the radio manager was [[David Hill (businessman)|David Hill]].&lt;!--perhaps this one--&gt;  In 2000 the 5AN branding was replaced with &quot;891 ABC Adelaide&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/local/stories/2008/03/06/2182623.htm|title=The History on 891 ABC Adelaide|author=Aaron O'Brien|date=18 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The power level of 5AN was upgraded to 50 kw in the early 1950s.  The transmitter for this was housed in the same building as for 5CL.  The transmitter was manufactured by [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]].  The final stage of the transmitter contained three parallel 3J/261E air cooled [[triode]]s running in [[class C amplifier]] at 90% efficiency.  These were driven by a class B [[modulator]] with the same type of valves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Australian Radio the Technical Story 1923-83|author=Winston T.
