'''MythTV''' is a [[free and open source software|free and open source]] home entertainment application with a simplified &quot;[[10-foot user interface]]&quot; design for the living-room TV, and turns a computer with the necessary hardware into a [[Computer network|network]] [[Streaming media|streaming]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Network - MythTV | url = http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Network}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[digital video recorder]], a [[digital]] [[multimedia]] [[home entertainment system]], or [[Home theater PC|home theater personal computer]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lxf117&quot;&gt;{{Citation

It runs on various [[operating system]]s, primarily Linux/Mac/FreeBSD.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Operating_system MythTV operating systems]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The MythTV project was started in April 2002 by Isaac Richards,&lt;ref name=post/&gt; who explained his motivation:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/User_Manual:Introduction User Manual:Introduction], mythtv.org. Retrieved 15 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|I got tired of the rather low quality [[cable TV|cable]] box that [[AT&amp;T]] Broadband provides with their digital cable service. It's slow to change channels, ridden with ads, and the program guide is a joke. So, I figured it'd be fun to try and build a replacement. Yes, I could have just bought a [[TiVo]], but I wanted to have more than just a [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] â I want a web browser built in, a mail client, maybe some games. Basically, I want the mythical convergence box that's been talked about for a few years now.}}

In early 2007, Apress published ''Practical MythTV'' on MythTV and its installation.

==Features==
* Pause, skip, and rewind live TV shows.
* Completely automatic commercial detection and optional skipping.
* Intelligently schedules recordings to avoid conflicts.
* Interfaces with [[Broadcast programming|TV listing]] sources such as [[XMLTV]] or [[Program and System Information Protocol|PSIP]].
* Interfaces with nonprofit subscription listings service [[Schedules Direct]] in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]]. Schedules Direct delivers the same [[Tribune Media Services]] listings data that TiVo and other video recorders use.
* Supports [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]], [[QAM]], and [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] [[high-definition television]].
* Supports [[X video extension|Xv]], [[OpenGL]], and [[VDPAU]] video output.
* A backend server and frontend client architecture, allowing multiple frontend client machines to be remotely served content from one or more backend servers. A single computer can perform as both the frontend client and the backend server.
* Plays recordings at an accelerated or decelerated rate, adjusting the audio pitch as necessary.
* Schedule and administer various system functions using a web browser-based interface.
* Controls a settop box using an infrared remote ([[Infrared blaster|IR blaster]]), or firewire.

===HDTV support===
MythTV is capable of capturing [[HDTV]] streams from any source that will provide unencrypted video. This means broadcast [[ATSC]] and [[Digital_Video_Broadcasting|DVB]] content, as well as encrypted DVB content when using a tuner with an integrated [[Common_Interface|CI]] module.  Most [[U.S.]] [[Cable Television|cable]] and [[Satellite Television|satellite]] providers use encrypted video only accessible through their own [[set-top box]]es. Cable systems may provide some unencrypted QAM channels, but these will generally only be local broadcast stations, and not cable programming or premium channels.

[[OpenCable]] devices are available to access encrypted content on U.S. cable systems, but as this is a full [[Digital_rights_management|DRM]] system, and not just [[Conditional_access|CA]] like DVB CI, every piece of hardware and software on the playback chain must be tested and licensed by [[CableLabs]]. At current, [[Windows Media Center]] is the only DVR software to meet these requirements, and only it, and other software using its recording libraries, can use these devices. In 2010, CableLabs relaxed the DRM restrictions allowing unlicensed devices to record ''copy freely'' content using these devices&lt;ref&gt;http://thedigitalmediazone.com/2010/08/15/cablelabs-approves-tuner-sharing-and-copy-freely-drm-free-content/&lt;/ref&gt;, however it is still entirely up to cable operators what content they provide flagged as such.

As an alternative to direct digital capture, one can use an external decoder to receive the channels, and then capture using digital-analog-digital conversion. A popular means of doing this conversion is to connect the component outputs of a set-top box to the Hauppauge HD PVR.&lt;ref&gt;http://hauppauge.com/site/products/data_hdpvr.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mythtv.org/wiki/Hauppauge_HD-PVR&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supported tuner cards===
The MythTV software supports TV tuner cards fully compatible with [[Video4Linux|V4L-DVB]] [[Linux kernel|kernel]] drivers; lists of supported devices are available.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxtv.org/wiki/index.php/Hardware_Device_Information Hardware device information, with lists of supported devices]&lt;/ref&gt;

MythTV also supports program capture via [[FireWire]] from digital [[set-top box]]es. These include the Motorola DCT-6200, the STB used by Cogeco Cable in the USA and Shaw Cable in Canada for its HD services. It can also recording directly from [[IPTV]] sources such as the [[Freebox]] service, as well as from the [[HDHomeRun]] network tuner.

===Modules===
MythTV's add-on modules (plugins) include:
* '''MythVideo''' plays various video file formats
* '''MythMusic''' a music player, [[jukebox]], collection manager, and CD ripper
* '''MythGallery''' online photo gallery manager
* '''MythNews''' RSS feed news reader
* '''MythWeather''' fetches [[weather forecast]]s - including [[weather radar]] - from the Internet
* '''MythBrowser''' small [[web browser]]
* '''MythGame''' frontend for game console emulators
* '''MythWeb''' controls MythTV from a remote web browser
* '''MythArchive''' DVD burner
* '''MythNetvision''' streaming video player intended primarily for Flash-websites like [[YouTube]]
* '''MythZoneMinder''' frontend interface for a [[ZoneMinder]] system
* '''[[UPnP]]''' AV MediaServer v1.0 compliant server: share media files with UPnP-clients

The base system integrates well with its modules. A system can be controlled with an infrared remote control using [[LIRC]], or radio remote control using [[Module (Linux)|kernel modules]].

==Operating system bundles==
There are several projects which include a Linux distribution bundled with MythTV (and associated libraries) to make installation, configuration and maintenance easier and faster:
* LinHES (formerly known as [[KnoppMyth]]) is a [[bootCD]] derivative of [[ArchLinux]]. Its MythTV frontend can be run from the CD. An entire installation to the hard disk can be made in minutes.
* [[Mythbuntu]] combines [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] distributions with MythTV. The Ubuntu community has built extensive resources for installing, configuring and troubleshooting MythTV.
* [[Mythdora]] is a Red Hat [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] distribution with MythTV.
* iMedia MythTV Linux distribution is a version of the [[iMedia]] embedded Linux distribution.
* MiniMyth is a small Linux distribution that turns a [[diskless computer]] into a MythTV frontend.
* [[LinuxMCE]] bundles MythTV with [[Kubuntu]] as the Linux distro, along with the Pluto Home automation suite.
* Xebian is a distribution of [[Debian]] Linux for the [[Microsoft]] [[Xbox]] game console and includes MythTV.

==Internals==
The default file format for software encoding is a [[RTJPEG]] or [[MPEG-4]] video stored in a slightly-modified version of Roman Hochleitner's &quot;NuppelVideo&quot; (.nuv) container {{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}. NUV files are also playable in [[VLC media player]] and [[MPlayer]], but can occasionally exhibit problems in A/V synchronization due to the MythTV-specific modifications. It also appears that MythTV is now the single authority on the NuppelVideo file format, since the original author's website is no longer available.

MythTV can also record via hardware-encoder cards and other sources of [[MPEG-2]] digital TV streams like [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]], [[ATSC Standards|ATSC]] and [[Firewire]] (from [[HDTV]] cable boxes in the [[United States]]), so many users of MythTV rarely see NuppelVideo files unless they choose to [[transcode]] their files to NuppelVideo to save disk space.
