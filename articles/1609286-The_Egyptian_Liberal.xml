'''Kefaya''' ({{lang-arz|ÙÙØ§ÙØ©}} ''kefÄya'', {{IPA-arz|keËfÃ¦ËjÃ¦|IPA}}, âenoughâ) is the unofficial [[moniker]] of the '''Egyptian Movement for Change''' (&lt;small&gt;{{lang-ar|&lt;/small&gt;Ø§ÙØ­Ø±ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙØµØ±ÙØ© ÙÙ Ø£Ø¬Ù Ø§ÙØªØºÙÙØ±}} ''el-Haraka el-Masreyya men agl el-Taghyeer''), a [[Grassroots democracy|grassroots]] [[coalition]] which prior to the 2011 revolution drew its support from across [[Egypt]]âs political spectrum. It was a platform for protest against [[Hosni Mubarak]]âs presidency and the possibility he might seek to transfer power directly to his son [[Gamal Mubarak|Gamal]]; political corruption and stagnation; &quot;the blurring of the lines between power and wealth; and the regime's cruelty, coercion and disregard for human rights.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.136-7&lt;/ref&gt;

While it first came to public attention in the summer of 2004, and achieved a much greater profile during the 2005 constitutional referendum and presidential election campaigns, it subsequently lost momentum, suffering from internal dissent, leadership change, and a more general frustration at the apparent inability of Egyptâs political opposition to force the pace of reform.

== Origins ==

While Kefaya first emerged in 2004, its origins can be found in earlier strands of political protest, beginning with the solidarity committees that spread throughout [[Egypt]] following the start of the [[Second Intifada]] in [[Palestine]] in October 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baheyya Blogspot&quot;&gt;baheyya.blogspot.com, Kefaya: Asking the Right Questions, 30 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The pro-Intifada demonstrations were particularly notable as they involved a new generation of previously non-politicised youth and, as a direct consequence, resulted in a revival of Egyptian street politics.  {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Following the US-led invasion of [[Iraq]] in March 2003, these protesters formed the backbone of Egyptâs highly vocal [[anti-war movement]],&lt;ref name=&quot;El Hamalawy&quot;&gt;Hossam El Hamalawy, Comrades and Brothers, Middle East Report No. 242, Spring 2007&lt;/ref&gt;  and their protests in turn developed into the first public demonstrations against President Mubarak since he had taken office.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Anany&quot;&gt;Khalil Al-Anany, Egyptâs democratisation: reality or mirage? OpenDemocracy.net, 10 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   The anti-war protest of 20 March 2003 â from which the anti-war movement ''20 March'' derived its name â was one of the biggest spontaneous demonstrations in Egyptâs history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azimi&quot;&gt;Negar Azimi, Egyptâs youth have had enough, OpenDemocracy.net, 1 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The evolution of this protest movement into Kefaya occurred during the summer of 2004.  Speculation, fuelled by state-controlled media, had been mounting that major changes in top-level political personnel were to be announced.  The much-anticipated cabinet reshuffle in July resulted in only cosmetic changes, however, and saw the installation of a number of supporters of the Presidentâs son, [[Gamal Mubarak]], in important government posts.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;&gt;Mona El-Ghobashy, Egypt looks ahead to a portentous year, Middle East Report, 2 February 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing a [[hereditary]] transfer of power similar to that which had occurred in [[Syria]], opposition activists and intellectuals were galvanised into action.  In August, a petition was circulated which demanded fundamental constitutional and economic reforms, but most importantly direct presidential elections with competing candidates.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;/&gt;   The 300 signatories of what became Kefayaâs founding declaration called for âdemocracy and reform to take root in Egypt.â &lt;ref name=&quot;Korshid&quot;&gt;Sarah Korshid, A Cry of Distress, IslamOnline.net, 25 August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;   Then in October 2004, Tariq al-Bishri, one of Egyptâs most respected judges, presented what soon came to be regarded as the movementâs first [[manifesto]] in which he exhorted his fellow citizens to âwithdraw their long-abused consent to be governedâ â in effect, a call for civil disobedience.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;&gt;Mona El-Ghobashy, Egypt looks ahead to a portentous year&lt;/ref&gt;

Kefayaâs first rally, held on 12 December, was an historic event, being the first occasion a protest had been organised solely to demand that the President step down.  Surrounded by [[riot police]], between 500 and 1000 activists gathered on the steps of the High Court in [[Cairo]].  They âremained mostly silent and taped over their mouths a large yellow sticker emblazoned with âKefayaâ.â &lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;/&gt;

== Support-base ==

Described as a âloose knit umbrella of diverse political trends,â&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;/&gt; Kefaya represents a ânew styleâ of opposition in [[Egypt]], with parallels to [[Ukraine|Ukraineâs]] [[Orange Revolution]] and [[Poland|Polandâs]] [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rey&quot;&gt;Benjamin Rey, Will the Kefaya movement be enough to change Egypt? CafeBabel, 29 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  It draws its support from a cosmopolitan range of sources including [[Nasserism|Nasserists]], [[Islamists]], [[Liberals]], [[Marxists]], [[Secularists]] etc., some of which have deep-rooted ideological differences, and have even clashed in the past.  Activists frequently stress that it is not a political party aiming to achieve power, but a ânational coalition movementâ united by the common goal of seeking an end to President Mubarakâs rule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korshid&quot;&gt;Sarah Korshid, A Cry of Distress&lt;/ref&gt;

Abdel-Halim Qandil, the editor of the [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] newspaper ''Al-Arabi'' who was spokesman for the movement until the beginning of 2007, emphasised that the use of the word âKefayaâ was designed to connect with the general public:  âOur movement targets [[Egyptians]].  We want them to put away their fears, and demand their political and economic rights.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;&gt;Shaden Shehab, Thatâs Enough, Al-Ahram Weekly, 29 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Another member, Dr Mohamed Al-Saed Idris, an academic, called it âa national cry against the status quo.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Korshid&quot;/&gt;

== Key events ==

Kefaya came of age in 2005, a year which saw two events of great significance in Egyptian politics.  The first was a [[referendum]] on 25 May to approve changes to the constitution that would allow the first ever direct, multi-candidate elections for the presidency.  The second was the Presidential election itself, held on 7 September.

=== Constitutional amendments ===

Kefaya had continued its campaign for political reform since its December demonstration, attracting increasing attention from the government.  A rally planned for 18 January was banned, while in the same month political scientist and leading activist Mohamed El-Sayed Said, was removed from a panel discussion at [[Cairo|Cairoâs]] Book Fair.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;/&gt;

Then on 26 February 2005, [[Hosni Mubarak|President Mubarak]] caused consternation when he announced a proposal to amend Article 76 of the [[Constitution]] to enable multiple candidates to contest presidential elections directly for the first time.  Under the old system, the election process was indirect:  the candidate was nominated and confirmed by the [[Peopleâs Assembly]] (''Majlis al-Shaâb''), controlled by the [[National Democratic Party (Egypt)|National Democratic Party]] (NDP), before being approved in a nation-wide âyesâ or ânoâ referendum.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;&gt;Jeremy M Sharp, Egypt: 2005 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections, Report for Congress, Congressional Research Service, 21 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediate repercussion to this announcement was the decision by [[US Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] to cancel a proposed visit to the country in protest at the arrest and imprisonment of opposition politician [[Ayman Nour]], leader of the [[al-Ghad]] (Tomorrow) Party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Muravchik&quot;&gt;Joshua Muravchik, Among Arab Reformers, Commentary, Vol. 120, No. 2, September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  More generally, [[President of the United States|American President]] [[George W. Bush]] had been putting pressure on key regional allies, especially Egypt and [[Saudi Arabia]], to introduce some form of [[electoral reform]] as part of efforts to spread democracy â the so-called âforward strategy for freedom.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Ibrahim&quot;&gt;Youssef M Ibrahim, âKefayaâ: A Word, A Movement, USA Today, 28 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described President Mubarakâs plans as âan act of minimalism intended to deflect domestic and international pressure.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Washington Post&quot;&gt;âKefayaâ in Egypt, Washington Post, 15 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Kefaya immediately denounced the proposals as âtheatricsâ and a âfake reformâ designed merely as a &quot;reformulation of the dictatorship&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rey&quot;&gt;Benjamin Rey, Will the Kefaya movement be enough to change Egypt?&lt;/ref&gt;

The timing of the Presidentâs announcement was significant, coming only a few weeks after the close of the annual [[voter registration]] period (1 November to 31 January) specified under Article 5 of Egyptâs constitution.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;&gt;Mona El-Ghobashy, Egyptâs Paradoxical Elections, Middle east Report, Spring 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  When the specifics of the [[constitutional amendment]] were presented by law-makers, the oppositionâs fears seemed justified.  Under the new rules, each [[candidate]] would require the support of at least 250 elected officials from national or local bodies.  As these were controlled by the NDP, it would be virtually impossible for signatures to be collected.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;&gt;Jeremy M Sharp, Egypt: 2005 Presidential and Parliamentary Elections&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[political parties]] that wished to put their candidates on the [[ballot]] would need to have been licensed for a minimum of 5 years and have at least 5% of seats in the lower and upper house.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;/&gt;  This move seemed designed to place even greater pressure on established opposition parties, in particular the already-proscribed [[Muslim Brotherhood]].

The opposition were scathing in their criticism of the NDP.  Hussein Abderazzek of the left-wing Tagammu party declared: âThe NDP will not only choose its own candidate but also his competitors,â&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Anany&quot;&gt;Khalil Al-Anany, Egyptâs democratisation: reality or mirage?&lt;/ref&gt; while Kefaya accused the party of âaborting peopleâs hopes for freedom and democracy.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Toensing&quot;&gt;Chris Toensing, US Stays with Egyptian Dictator, Middle East Report, 30 June 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The referendum campaign ===

The run-up to the referendum saw popular demands for reform âskyrocket.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Kamel&quot;&gt;Kareem M Kamel, Simmering Discontent â The Persistence of Popular Protest in Egypt, IslamOnline.Net, 23 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Kefaya held regular protests, calling for the âcancellation of the state of emergency law and all special laws that restrict freedomsâ (''ilghaâhalat al-tawariâwa kafat al-qawanin al-istithna âiyya al-muqayyada lil-hurriyat'').&lt;ref name=&quot;Stacher&quot;&gt;[[Joshua Stacher]], Rhetorical Acrobatics and Reputations: Egyptâs National Council for Human Rights, Middle East Report, Summer 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, they attacked the government for its record on [[social welfare]], job creation and education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;/&gt;  In April, simultaneous demonstrations were planned in 13 cities under a banner of âNo Constitution Without Freedomâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;/&gt;

Kefayaâs activities served as a catalyst for other opposition groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;/&gt;  Egyptâs largest opposition party, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], held its own demonstrations calling for political reform, while university professors held a silent protest on 19 April calling for an end to state control of campuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howeidy&quot;&gt;Amira Howeidy, A Chronology of Dissent, Al-Ahram Weekly, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  The previous month Misr Digital, the countryâs first independent digital newspaper, was launched quickly becoming the main source of information on Kefayaâs activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howeidy&quot;/&gt;

Egyptâs judiciary, regarded as having almost replaced the opposition in the past,&lt;ref name=&quot;Makram-Ebeid&quot;&gt;Mona Makram-Ebeid, Egyptâs 2000 Parliamentary Elections, Middle East Policy, Vol. VIII, No. 2, June 2001&lt;/ref&gt; put additional pressure on the government over the issue of the domestic monitoring of elections.  At a meeting on 15 April of the Alexandria Judges Club, 1200 judges threatened to withdraw their supervision of presidential and parliamentary elections unless they were guaranteed independence and control of all stages of elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howeidy&quot;/&gt;

Throughout this period, while police and security forces continued to harass Kefaya and other opposition activists, there was no full-scale crackdown.  In effect, a stand-off had developed: while the opposition was not strong enough to topple the government, the government was equally unable to stamp-out the opposition, at least partly in fear of the international outcry that would follow.  Egyptians described the situation as âpolitical congestionâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abdelhadi&quot;&gt;Magdi Abdelhadi, Winds of Change Blow Through Egypt Politics, BBC News, 20 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 25 May 2005 ===

On 25 May, the day of the referendum, demonstrations organised by Kefaya in front of the Press Syndicate headquarters and Sa âd Zaghlul Shrine in [[Cairo]] were attacked by [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]] supporters and plain-clothes policemen, whilst [[riot police]] looked on.  A reporter gave an eyewitness account of what happened in front of the press building:

âThe steps were full of Kefaya people and I was on the edge of the crowd.  There was a cordon of security and riot policemen on the street.  I saw a group of NDP people come down the streets â they had Mubarak posters â and there were at least 20 riot police walking with them, looking like they were protecting them.  The police at the bottom of the steps opened the cordon to let the NDP gang through to the demonstrators.  The next thing I knew a gang of about 20 or 30 NDP guys came at us from the left.â&lt;ref name=&quot;HRW&quot;&gt;Egypt: Calls for reform met with brutality, Human Rights Watch, 26 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst the victims of the brutality were two women who were beaten and sexually molested.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howeidy&quot;/&gt;  The opposition were unified in their condemnation and demanded the resignation of the [[Interior Minister]], Habib al-âAdli.  In addition, Kefaya held protests every Wednesday for the rest of the summer.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;&gt;Mona El-Ghobashy, Egyptâs Paradoxical Elections&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these incidents, there was no serious violence on voting day, which George Ishak, Kefayaâs co-ordinator at the time, attributed to international attention on Egypt: âThere are 1,800 foreign correspondents watching the elections; do you think the regime would should show its hideous face to the world?  They behaved the way they did because of the huge media presence.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;/&gt;

The referendum approved the proposed [[constitutional amendments]], but Egyptian judges challenged a government turnout figure of 52%, saying it was closer to 5%.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sharp&quot;/&gt;

=== The Presidential election ===

Despite the setback of the constitutional referendum, Kefaya sought to maintain the pressure on the government ahead of the presidential poll on 7 September.  On 8 June, 2,000 people representing a cross-section of the Egyptian opposition took part in a candle-lit vigil in front of the [[mausoleum]] of Saad Zaghoul, one of Egyptâs [[national heroes]].  It was described as âthe most organised and impressive demonstration by the reform movement to date.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Howeidy&quot;/&gt;

Throughout the summer, inspired by Kefayaâs example, a series of opposition groups sprang up, all seeking to expand freedoms in specific areas of society.  They included Journalists for Change, Doctors for Change, Workers for Change and Youth for Change, which had been founded on the eve of the referendum and became Kefayaâs unofficial youth arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;Howeidy&quot;/&gt;

However, the government was emboldened by its May success, and increased its pressure on Kefaya and the other opposition parties.  At a rally held in Cairo on 30 July to protest against President Mubarakâs intention to seek a fifth term, 200 activists were attacked by uniformed and plain clothed police wielding truncheons.&lt;ref name=&quot;CRS&quot;&gt;Country Reports on Human Rights Practices in 2005, Congressional Research Service, 8 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;    The decision to do this was described by [[Human Rights Watch]] as ânot just to prevent a demonstration, but also to physically punish those daring to protest President Mubarakâs candidacy.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Korshid&quot;/&gt;  The tactics seemed to have an effect when Kefaya was forced to abandon its plan of inviting several prominent figures to run against the President when no names were forthcoming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;/&gt;  Instead, it adopted a strategy of [[boycotting]] the elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fathy&quot;&gt;Ahmed Fathy &amp; Hamdy Al Husseini, Egyptâs Kefaya Holds âSwear-Inâ Demo, IslamOnline.Net, 28 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  One of Kefayaâs founding members, Hany Anan, declared:

âWe are showing Egyptians that we can challenge the ruler, we can tell him we donât want you, thatâs enough, you go, and we can do this in public and still go back to our homes, maybe with some wounds or some bruises, but we still go home.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Saleh&quot;&gt;Heba Saleh, Re-Birth of Egyptian Politics, BBC News, 5 September 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Although ten candidates stood for the presidency, the election results came as little surprise.  President Mubarak won with 88.6% of the vote.  However, of 32 million eligible voters, only seven million cast their ballot, meaning just six million had voted to re-elect the President for a further six years.  Most of the defeated candidates challenged these results on the grounds of [[fraud]] and other irregularities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fathy&quot;&gt;Fathy &amp; Al Husseini, Egyptâs Kefaya Holds âSwear-Inâ Demo&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the elections, it was predicted in some quarters that Kefaya would disappear from the political scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fathy&quot;/&gt;   In response to this, a huge rally was organised in Cairo to coincide with the Presidentâs swearing-in ceremony on 27 September which organisers claimed was attended by over 5000 people.  They carried banners and chanted slogans attacking the President and his regime, including â6 millions voted yes, 70 millions say no.â  The rally culminated in a mass oath by Kefaya members, promising to continue their opposition to the President and his plans to pass power to his son.&lt;ref name=&quot;Fathy&quot;/&gt;

In the autumn, Kefaya joined a group of other opposition parties to form the National Front for Change to fight parliamentary elections that took place between November and December.  The joint effort resulted in only 12 seats, however.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;/&gt;  While the NDP dominated Assembly with 388 seats, the big opposition winners were the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] whose candidates, running as independents because of the ban on the party, won 88 seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehata&quot;&gt;Samer Shehata &amp; [[Joshua Stacher]], The Brotherhood Goes to Parliament, Middle East Report, No. 240, Fall 2006&lt;/ref&gt;   Talking about the coalitionâs disappointing showing, Kefaya spokesman Abdel-Halim Qandil said âit will take time and effort for the public to believe in its effectiveness.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;/&gt;

== Criticism ==

Despite its importance in becoming a âmodel of dissentâ,&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;/&gt;  Kefaya has been criticised on a number of levels.  It promised both mass â[[civil disobedience]]â and a strong opposition network to press the regime, neither of which have materialised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shehab&quot;/&gt;  Moreover, in the aftermath of the 2005 Presidential elections, the [[International Crisis Group]] stated:  âKefaya has remained essentially a protest movement, targeting Mubarak personally and articulating a bitter rejection of the [[status quo]] rather than a constructive vision of how it might be transformed.â&lt;ref name=&quot;ICG&quot;&gt;Reforming Egypt: In Search of a Strategy, International Crisis Group. Middle East/North Africa Report No. 46, 4 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been criticised for failing to reach beyond âan exclusive, Cairo-based intellectual crowd,â offering a âlofty discourse on human rights and democracyâ but no practical solutions to the problems Egyptians face on a daily basis, such as poverty, unemployment, poor access to education and public services, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;Azimi&quot;&gt;Negar Azimi, Egyptâs youth have had enough&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, according to Abdel Fattah, an academic at [[Cairo University]], Kefaya âare not effective among the masses and they will not reach the point where we see millions of Egyptians take to the streetsâ¦instead of slogans I want practical solutions to problems.â&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Hennawy&quot;&gt;Noha El-Hennawy, Business as Usual, Egypt Today, February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  Unless they can broaden their base of support into key urban and rural areas, they may indeed remain âa group of intellectuals screaming and shouting in political forums and magazines....â&lt;ref name=&quot;Osman&quot;&gt;Tarek Osman, Egyptâs phantom messiah, OpenDemocracy.net, 12 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

== Future prospects ==

After the high-profile campaigns of 2005, Kefaya has found itself in the political doldrums.  Its challenge became how to operate in what had apparently become a largely âapolitical societyâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;Makram-Ebeid&quot;&gt;âMona Makram-Ebeid, Egyptâs 2000 Parliamentary Elections&lt;/ref&gt; A [[culture of fear]] remained among ordinary Egyptian people as a result of 53 years of bans on protests, along with crackdowns on and detentions of opposition activists.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korshid&quot;/&gt;  Mohammed El-Sayed Said described Kefayaâs problem thus: âOrdinary Egyptians want democracy but will not fight for it.â&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Ghobashy&quot;/&gt;

Moreover, recently Kefaya has been described as suffering from an â[[identity crisis (psychology)|identity crisis]]â.&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Sayed&quot;&gt;Mohamed El-Sayed, Divided They Stand, Al-Ahram Weekly, 21â27 December 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  There have been disputes over tactics between the movement and Youth for Change, particularly over what have been termed the latterâs â[[vigilante]] street tactics.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Azimi&quot;/&gt;  Then, at the end of 2006, a more serious split occurred after an anonymous article was posted on Kefayaâs website apparently supporting an anti-veil stance advocated by [[Farouk Hosni]], the Minister of Culture.  Although the article was subsequently removed, seven key figures, all pro-[[Islamist]], announced their intention to quit the movement.  One, Magdi Ahmed Hussein, declared that Kefaya had âfailed to find the middle ground between the [[Islamists]] and [[liberals]]â¦â&lt;ref name=&quot;El-Sayed&quot;&gt;Mohamed El-Sayed, Divided They Stand&lt;/ref&gt;

The movementâs co-ordinator since 2004, George Ishak, stepped down in January 2007 to be replaced by Abdel Wahhab Al-Messiri, a renowned anti-[[zionist]] scholar and former member of both the Egyptian Communist Party and [[Muslim Brotherhood]].  He faces the difficult task of renewing the movement following further constitutional changes approved by a referendum in March 2007.  The changes, which make it even harder for political parties to operate and extend the stateâs security powers, are described by [[Amnesty International]] as the âgreatest erosion of human rightsâ since the introduction of [[emergency powers]] in 1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;Deknatel&quot;&gt;Frederick Deknatel, US skirts the issue of Egyptâs constitutional referendum, The Daily Star, 22 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Having successfully broken the [[taboo]] on directly criticising and challenging the President, it remains to be seen whether unity within such a disparate movement can be maintained long enough for it to broaden its appeal beyond its urban roots and become a genuine popular movement.

At the time of the [[2011 Egyptian protests]] the movement joined the protests that had been initiated by younger internet-savvy agitators via [[Facebook]], and were described by international media interviewers as the 'opposition'.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]] reports, 2 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/mobile/world-middle-east-12290167 Egypt's opposition pushes demands as protests continue], BBC News, 1 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
