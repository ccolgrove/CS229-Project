In an interview with Alison Oddey, Walters said about her early schooling: &quot;I was never going to be academic, so [my mother] suggested that I try teaching or nursing [...] I'd been asked to leave school, so I thought I'd better do it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Performing Women: Stand-ups, Strumpets and Itinerants, by Alison Oddey, Palgrave Macmillan, 2005. p. 305&lt;/ref&gt; 

Her first job was in insurance at the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=That's Another Story: The Autobiography |last=Walters |first=Julie |year=2008 |publisher=Orion Publishing Co |isbn=029785206X |page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt; At 18 she trained as a nurse at the [[Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham]] and worked on the ophthalmic, casualty and coronary care wards during the 18 months she spent there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=That's Another Story: The Autobiography |last=Walters |first=Julie |year=2008 |publisher=Orion Publishing Co |isbn=029785206X |pages=102â123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walters decided to leave nursing, and studied English and Drama at Manchester Polytechnic (now [[Manchester Metropolitan University]]) and pursued a career in the [[performing arts]].
