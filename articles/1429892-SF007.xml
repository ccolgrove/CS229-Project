'''''Spirou et Fantasio''''' (''Spirou and Fantasio'') is one of the most popular classic [[Franco-Belgian comics|Franco-Belgian comic strips]].  The series, which has been running since 1938, shares many characteristics with other [[European comics|European]] humorous adventure comics like ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'' and ''[[Asterix]]''.  It has been written and drawn by a succession of artists.

[[Spirou (character)|Spirou]] and [[Fantasio]] are the series' main characters, two adventurous [[journalist]]s who run into fantastic adventures, aided by Spirou's pet [[squirrel]] [[List of characters in Spirou et Fantasio#Spip|Spip]] and their inventor friend the [[Champignac|Count of Champignac]].

__TOC__

==History==
===Origins of ''Spirou''===
[[Image:Rob-vel-spirou1.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Rob-Vel's Spirou]]
The comic strip was originally created by [[Robert Velter|Rob-Vel]] for the launch of the ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Le Journal de Spirou]]'' on April 21, 1938, published by [[Dupuis|Ãditions Dupuis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambiek Spirou magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Lambiek Comiclopedia | title =Spirou Comic Magazine | url =http://lambiek.net/magazines/spirou.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main character was originally an elevator (lift) operator (in [[French language|French]]: ''un groom'') for the Moustique Hotel (in reference to the publisher's chief magazine, ''Le Moustique''), and remains dressed in his red [[bellhop]] uniform to this day although there was no relevance to his original occupation for many years. Spirou (the name means &quot;squirrel&quot; (lit.) and &quot;mischievous&quot; (fig.) in [[Walloon language|Walloon]]) has a pet squirrel called [[List of characters in Spirou et Fantasio#Spip|Spip]], the series' first supporting character, who was introduced on June 8, 1939 in the [[story arc]] titled ''L'Heritage de Bill Money'' and liberated in the following week's issue, remaining a presence in all ''Spirou'' stories since.&lt;ref name=&quot;spiroutj&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =spiroutj.free.fr| title =Historique - Rob-Vel | url =http://spiroutj.free.fr/hist/robv.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=inediBM&gt;{{Cite web|last=inedispirou.fr|title=L'Heritage de Bill Money|url=http://www.inedispirou.net/bd-inedites/rob-vel/heritage/79.gif}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Spirou et spip-150639.jpg|thumb|right|Spip's liberation, June 15, 1939]]

Adding to the difficulties of magazine publication that came with the outbreak of [[World War II]], Velter joined the army effort, and his wife Blanche Dumoulin, using the pen name Davine, continued the work on the ''Spirou'' strip, with the aid of the young Belgian artist Luc Lafnet.&lt;ref name=lambiek-robvel&gt;{{Cite web|last=Lambiek Comiclopedia|title=Rob-Vel |url=http://lambiek.net/artists/r/rob_vel.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=spriworld-robvel&gt;{{Cite web|last=spirouworld.com|title=FranÃ§ois Robert Velter, dit Rob-Vel |url=http://www.spirouworld.com/robvel.htm|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirou became the property of the publisher Dupuis, (atypical in France and Belgium where most comics characters are owned by their creator(s)), who bought the character from Rob-Vel in 1943, and since then the series has belonged to no specific author.&lt;small&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bedetheque - Rob-Vel&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =Bedetheque | title =Rob-Vel | url =http://www.bedetheque.com/auteur-4187-BD-Rob-Vel.html}}{{fr_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt; The title has therefore subsequently been passed on to several different artists and writers.

The first succession came in 1943 when Joseph Gillain, known by the pen name [[JijÃ©]], was given charge of the character. In 1944 JijÃ© introduced a new character, [[Fantasio]], who would become Spirou's best friend and co-adventurer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lambiek Spirou magazine&quot;/&gt; Holding many artistic commitments at ''Le Journal de Spirou'', JijÃ© sought to delegate much of his work, and in 1946 he handed the series to his understudy, the young [[AndrÃ© Franquin]], in the middle of the production of the story ''Spirou et la maison prÃ©fabriquÃ©e''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Franquin-Une vie-1946&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last =franquin.com | title =Une vie - 1946 | url =http://www.franquin.com/bio/1946.php|language=French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Franquin's ''Spirou''===
Franquin developed the strip from single gags and short serials into long adventures with complex plots, and is usually considered as the definitive author of the strip.  He introduced a large gallery of recurring characters, notably the [[Characters in Spirou et Fantasio#The Count of Champignac|Count de Champignac]], elderly scientist and inventor; the buffoonish [[mad scientist]] [[Zorglub]]; Fantasio's cousin and aspiring dictator [[Zantafio]]; and the journalist [[Seccotine]], a rare instance of a major female character in Belgian comics of this period.
[[Image:Spirou4heritiers.jpg|thumb|''Spirou et les hÃ©ritiers'', 1952, by Franquin]]

One Franquin creation that went on to develop a life of its own was the [[Marsupilami]], a fictional monkey-like creature with a tremendously long prehensile tail.  The Marsupilami appears in the majority of the Franquin stories, starting in 1952 with ''[[Spirou et les hÃ©ritiers]]''.  In the series, it is adopted by the duo and follows them everywhere they go. Marsupilamis in the wild take centre stage briefly in ''[[Le nid des Marsupilamis]]'' (1957) which presents Seccotine's documentary featuring a family in their natural habitat, the jungles of the fictitious [[South American]] state ''[[Palombia]]''.

Starting with ''[[Le prisonnier du Bouddha]]'' (1959), Franquin began to work with [[Greg (comics)|Greg]] (writing) and [[JidÃ©hem]] (backgrounds).  As in some of his later series (''[[Bruno Brazil]]'', ''[[Bernard Prince]]''), Greg staged his stories in a realistic geopolitical context.  ''Le prisonnier du Bouddha'' is set in mainland [[China]], with veiled references made to the [[Cold War]].  As for ''[[QRN sur Bretzelburg]]'', it takes place in two imaginary European countries which bring to mind pre-[[German reunification|reunification]] [[Germany]].  Lastly, it is with Greg that Franquin created famed villain Zorglub in the [[diptych]] of ''[[Z comme Zorglub]]'' and ''[[L'ombre du Z]]''.

However, as Franquin grew tired of Spirou, his other major character [[Gaston Lagaffe|Gaston]] began to take precedence in his work, and following the controversial ''[[Panade Ã  Champignac]]'', the series passed on to a then unknown young cartoonist, [[Jean-Claude Fournier]], in 1969.  One side effect of this is that the Marsupilami would only appear in one last story, ''[[Le faiseur d'or]]''.  This is because Franquin decided to retain the rights to that character; all the other characters remained the property of the publisher. Starting with ''[[Du glucose pour NoÃ©mie]]'', there would be no more appearances of the Marsupilami in ''Spirou et Fantasio'', with the exception of a few discreet references. Only in the 1980s did the Marsupilami reappear in its own series, and later television cartoon and videogame.

===A long transition===
Fournier authored nine books in the series, which saw Spirou evolve into a more modern character.  Where Franquin's stories tended to be politically neutral (in his later works, notably ''[[IdÃ©es noires]]'', he would champion pacifist and environmental views), Fournier's stint on Spirou addressed such hot topics (for the 1970s) as [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] (''[[L'Ankou]]''), drug-funded dictatorships (''[[Kodo le tyran]]'') and [[FranÃ§ois Duvalier|Duvalier]]-style repression (''[[Tora Torapa]]'').

Fournier introduced some new characters such as OrorÃ©a, a beautiful girl reporter with whom Fantasio was madly in love with (in contrast with his loathing for [[Seccotine]]); Itoh Kata, a Japanese [[magician (fantasy)|magician]]; and an occult [[SPECTRE]]-like criminal organisation known as The Triangle. None of these were reused by later artists until some thirty years later when Itoh Kata appeared in Morvan and Munuera's ''Spirou et Fantasio Ã  Tokyo''.

However, at the end of the 1970s Fournier's pace began to slow down and the publisher, Dupuis, sought new authors to replace him.  For a time, three separate teams worked on concurrent stories.  [[Nic Broca]] (art) and [[Raoul Cauvin]] (writing) took on Fournier's lead without adding much to the characters. Their primary addition to the Spirou universe, namely the &quot;Black box&quot;, a device which annihilates sound, is in fact an acknowledged rehash from an early ''Sophie'' story by JidÃ©hem (''La bulle du silence'').  Strangely, the authors were not allowed by the publisher to use any of the side characters and because of this, the duo's three stories read somewhat like a parenthesis in the series.

===Yves Chaland's case===
[[Yves Chaland]] proposed a far more radical make-over. His (very short) stint on Spirou is an [[irony|ironic]] re-staging of the strip as it was in the 40s. This homage to JijÃ© and early Franquin was seen at the time as too sophisticated for the mainstream readership. It was prepublished in 1982 in ''Le Journal de Spirou'', nÂ°2297 to nÂ°2318, printed in two-colour, but was interrupted before it was completed. This unfinished story was first collected in an unofficial album in 1984, ''Ã la recherche de Bocongo'', and then, legally, under the name of ''CÅurs d'acier'' (Champaka editor, 1990). This last edition includes the original strips, and a text by [[Yann Le Pennetier]], illustrated by Chaland, that finishes the interrupted story.&lt;ref name=&quot;chaandnote&quot;&gt;Included in ''L'intÃ©grale Chaland'' (HumanoÃ¯des AssociÃ©s, 1997. ISBN 2-7316-1243-6), and Special Edition nÂ°4 (Dupuis ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Spirou'' in contemporary times - Tome &amp; Janry===
[[Image:Spirou Vito la Deveine.jpg|thumb|right|''Vito la DÃ©veine'', 1991, by Tome &amp; Janry]]
It was the team of [[Philippe Vandevelde|Tome]] (writing) and [[Janry]] (art) which was to find lasting success with Spirou, both in terms of sales and critical appeal. Graphically, the authors' work was seen as a modern homage to Franquin's classic work, while their plots involved such modern topics as biotech (''[[Virus (Spirou et Fantasio)|Virus]]''), robotics (''[[Qui arrÃªtera Cyanure?]]'') and even time travel (The diptych of ''[[L'horloger de la comÃ¨te]]'' and ''[[Le rÃ©veil du Z]]'', featuring future descendants of the Count and Zorglub). Their position as the official Spirou authors made them the flagship team to a whole new school of young, likeminded artists, such as [[Didier Conrad]], [[Bernard Hislaire]] or [[Frank Le Gall]], who had illustrious careers of their own. For a time, Spirou also acted as a side character in [[Frank PÃ©]]'s short-lived absurd humor strip ''L'Ãlan'' (originally published in the weekly ''Spirou'' magazine).

With ''[[La jeunesse de Spirou]]'' (1987), Tome and Janry set out to imagine Spirou's youth. This idea was later developed into a spin-off series, ''[[Le Petit Spirou]]'' (&quot;Young Spirou&quot;), which details the antics of the character as an elementary school boy. A lot of the gags center around the character's interest in the opposite sex. It is generally acknowledged, however, that the Petit Spirou doesn't have very much in common, psychologically speaking, with the adult character.

A new villain, the unlucky Mafia boss Vito &quot;Lucky&quot; Cortizone, based on the character Vito Corleone from the ''[[The Godfather]]'' movies, was introduced in ''[[Spirou Ã  New-York]]'', while ''[[Spirou Ã  Moscou]]'' (1990) sees Spirou and Fantasio pay their first visit to the [[USSR]], just as it was about to collapse (the country was [[History of the Soviet Union (1985â1991)#Yeltsin and the dissolution of the USSR|dissolved]] in 1991).

In ''Machine qui rÃªve'' (1998), Tome and Janry tried to once again renew the series with a more mature storyline (wounded hero, love relationships, etc.), coupled with a more realistic graphic style. This sudden shift into a darker tone shocked many readers, although its seeds were apparent in previous Spirou albums and in other series by the same authors (''[[Soda (comics)|Soda]]'', ''Berceuse assassine''). While many considered the change in tone to be courageous and laudable, there was some concern that Spirou lost much of its point when presented as a &quot;realistic&quot; character. At any rate, the controversy caused Tome &amp; Janry to concentrate on ''Le Petit Spirou'', and stop making albums in the main series.

===''Spirou'' in the 21st century===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Spirou Paris sous Siene.jpg|thumb|right|''Paris-sous-Seine'', 2004, by Morvan &amp; Munuera]] --&gt;

====Morvan &amp; Munuera====
Then, after a 6 years break, which only saw the publication of ''L'accÃ©lÃ©rateur atomique'', a Spirou spoof by [[Lewis Trondheim]] not included in the official series (but which received Dupuis' approval), the series went back to a more classical storytelling mode with seasoned cartoonists [[Jean-David Morvan]] (writing) and [[JosÃ©-Luis Munuera]] (art). The latter kept close to the spirit of [[Franquin]]'s graphical style, while bringing its own touch of [[manga]]-inspired modernism.  Morvan and Munuera's Spirou is partly remarkable in that it uses background elements and secondary characters from the whole history of the title, and not just from Franquin's period.

The duo's third album, ''Spirou et Fantasio Ã  Tokyo'' was released 20 September 2006. Spirou and Fantasio uncover the story of two children with telekinetic powers (similarly to the manga ''[[Akira (manga)|Akira]]'') that are forced to construct an edo and meiji period theme park. Dupuis has also released as ''Spirou et Fantasio 49Z'' a [[manga]] story by [[Hiroyuki Oshima]] after an idea by Morvan. This story tells Spirou's adolescence as a groom in a 5 star [[Tokyo]] hotel.&lt;ref name=&quot;manga&quot;&gt;[http://www.spirou.com/spirou/inedits_manga.htm Spirou et Fantasio - InÃ©dits:  En manga]&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to a significant decline in sales, Dupuis decided to cease Morvan and Munuera work in Spirou in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inedispirou.net/morvan-amp-munuera-arretent-spirou-vt138.html InediSpirou - Morvan &amp; Munuera arrÃªtent Spirou]{{fr_icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they were allowed to complete one last album, ''Aux sources du Z'', which was released 5 November 2008, with the help of scenarist Yann.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dupuis.com/catalogue/FR/al/10227/aux_sources_du_z.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yoann &amp; Vehlmann====

In January 2009, it was announced in ''[[Spirou (magazine)|Spirou]]'' #3694 that Morvan and Munuera would be succeeded by [[Fabien Vehlmann]] and [[Yoann]], who had together created the first volume of ''Une aventure de Spirou et Fantasio par...''. Their first album in the regular series was announced for October 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toutenbd.com/article.php3?id_article=2791 ToutenBD] reports the new authors for Spirou (24 January 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; but was later pushed back to September 3, 2010 and is named ''Alerte aux zorkons''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vehlmann.blogspot.com/2010/01/questions-recurrentes-sur-vehlmann-sa.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Le Spirou de...''====
In 2006, Dupuis launched a second series of one-off volumes by various authors, under the name ''Une aventure de Spirou et Fantasio par...'' (&quot;A Spirou and Fantasio adventure by...&quot;). It has subsequently been renamed &quot;Le Spirou de...&quot; (&quot;The Spirou story by...&quot;)

The first volume, ''Les gÃ©ants pÃ©trifiÃ©s'' by [[Fabien Vehlmann]] and [[Yoann]], had a modern storyline and art, not dissimilar in spirit to Morvan and Munuera's work.&lt;ref name=&quot;geants&quot;&gt;[http://www.spirou.com/spirou/oneshots/01/index.htm One-Shots - Les GÃ©ants PÃ©trifiÃ©s]&lt;/ref&gt; The second volume, ''Les marais du temps'', by [[Frank Le Gall]], is drawn in a more classic style not dissimilar to [[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]] and [[ThÃ©odore Poussin]], Le Gall's own comic series. The third, ''Le tombeau des Champignac'', by [[Yann le Pennetier|Yann]] and [[Fabrice Tarrin]], is a slightly modernized homage to Franquin's classic period. The fourth, ''Journal d'un ingÃ©nu'', by [[Emile Bravo]], is a novelistic homage to the original [[Rob-Vel]] and [[JijÃ©]]'s universes and stories, and was released to critical acclaim, being awarded at the [[AngoulÃªme International Comics Festival|AngoulÃªme festival]]. The fifth, ''Le groom vert-de-gris'' by Yann and [[Olivier Schwartz]], is based on one of Yann's old scripts from the 80's originally intended to have been drawn by Chaland, while the editor rejected it. Yann picked up the artist Schwartz, working in a similar style, to complete the story. The story takes place among the resistance movement in the Nazi-occupied Belgium. Unlike traditional Spirou stories, but similar to other works by Yann, the story features rather much dark humour and political satire. It was released once again to some acclaim but also attracted controversy for its cavalier approach to sensitive issues.  The sixth album, ''Panique en Atlantique'', authored by [[Lewis Trondheim]] and [[Fabrice Parme]], was released on April 16, 2010.
