'''Claremont''' is a small affluent [[college town]] in eastern [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States, about {{convert|30|mi}} east of downtown Los Angeles at the base of the [[San Gabriel Mountains]]. The population as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]] is 34,926. Claremont is known for its seven higher-education institutions, its tree-lined streets, and its historic buildings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/claremont/faq.html Los Angeles County Library - Frequently Asked Questions: Claremont]&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2007, it was rated by [[CNN]]/''[[Money (magazine)|Money]]'' magazine as the fifth best place to live in the United States, and was the highest rated place in California on the list.&lt;ref&gt;[http://finance.yahoo.com/real-estate/article/103225/Best-Places-to-Live CNN Money ratings of the best cities to live in the U.S.]&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its large number of trees and residents with [[doctorates]], it is known as &quot;the City of Trees and PhDs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, Susan. [http://www.latimes.com/classified/realestate/la-re-guide29jun29,0,7477159.story âWhat's green and well educated? Claremontâ], ''The Los Angeles Times'', June 29, 2003, retrieved July 24, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is primarily residential, with commercial activity revolving around ''The Village'', a popular collection of street-front small stores, boutiques, art galleries, offices, and restaurants westerly adjacent to [[the Claremont Colleges]]. The Village was expanded in 2007, adding a multi-use development that includes a [[movie theater|cinema]], a boutique hotel, retail space, offices, and a parking structure on the site of an old citrus packing plant just west of Indian Hill Blvd.

The citrus groves and open space which once dominated the northern portion of the city have been replaced by new residential developments of large homes. Construction of Stone Canyon Preserve, one of the final tract residential developments in the north of the city, commenced in 2003 as part of a complicated agreement between [[Pomona College]] and the City of Claremont which resulted in the creation of a {{convert|1740|acre|km2|sing=on}} wilderness park. The foothills also include the Padua Hills Theatre, an historic site constructed in 1930.

Claremont has been a winner of the National [[Arbor Day]] Association's [[Tree City USA]] award for 22 consecutive years. Early citizens planted trees when the city incorporated in 1907.  Claremont is one of the few remaining places in North America with [[American Elm]] trees that have not been exposed to [[Dutch elm disease]]; the stately trees line Indian Hill Boulevard in the vicinity of the city's Memorial Park.

Commuter train service to Claremont is provided by [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] from the [[Claremont (Metrolink station)|Claremont Metrolink Station]].  The station is on the [[Metrolink San Bernardino Line|San Bernardino Line]] with trains traveling to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]] several times each day.

== Civic institutions ==
The [[Claremont Colleges]], a consortium of seven schools of higher education which includes [[Pomona College]] (founded in 1887), [[Claremont Graduate University]] (1925), [[Scripps College]] (1926), [[Claremont McKenna College]] (1946), [[Harvey Mudd College]] (1955), [[Pitzer College]] (1963), and [[Keck Graduate Institute of Applied Life Sciences]] (1997), are located in Claremont.  Many of these schools are consistently rated among the best in the nation, which has helped draw students from across the country and around the world.  Just north of Foothill is the college-owned [[Robert J. Bernard Field Station]]. The [[Claremont School of Theology]], another school of higher education located in Claremont, shares some resources with the Claremont Colleges, but is not a member. These private educational institutions are hosts to approximately 6,500 students every year from around the world.  Claremont is also home to the [[Claremont Institute]].

Retirement communities include Pilgrim Place, Claremont Manor and Mt. San Antonio Gardens. The [[Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden]] contains a major collection of California native plants and is located next door to the natural coastal sage scrub of the Bernard Field Station.
