The '''Jeweled Shillelagh''' (shuh-LAY-lee) is the trophy awarded to the winner of the American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played annually by the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football]] team of the [[University of Notre Dame]] and the  [[USC Trojans football]] team of the [[University of Southern California]].  The [[shillelagh (club)|shillelagh]], an Irish [[club (weapon)|club]], is made of [[oak]] or [[blackthorn]] [[tree|sapling]]s from [[Ireland]].  On the end of the club is engraved, &quot;From the Emerald Isle.&quot;  The trophy was introduced in 1952 to commemorate the rivalry that began December 4, 1926.

==Series history==
{{main|Notre Dame â USC rivalry}}
[[Image:102007-NotreDameStadium-pregameUSC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Notre Dame and USC take the field in 2007 in the 79th edition of the rivalry.]]
The trophy was originally presented in 1952 by the Notre Dame Alumni Club of Los Angeles, stating that &quot;this shillelagh will serve to symbolize in part the high tradition, the keen rivalry and above all the sincere respect which these two great universities have for each other.&quot;

For each victory, a respective jeweled ornament is added to the foot-long club.  For each USC victory, a [[ruby]]-adorned Trojan head is added, marked with the year and game score; for each Notre Dame victory, a similarly detailed [[emerald]]-studded shamrock is added.  For tie games, a combined Trojan head/shamrock medallion is used (the NCAA has since changed the rules to allow no tie games since 1996).  Although the shillelagh was introduced in 1952, the medallions go back to the start of the series in 1926. 	

When the original shillelagh ran out of space for the Trojan heads and shamrocks after the 1989 game, it was retired and is permanently displayed at Notre Dame.  A new shillelagh, longer than the original, was introduced for the 1997 season with medallions made by Images Jewelers of Elkhart, Indiana. 
		 
As of the end of the 2011 season, there are now 43 shamrocks, 35 Trojan heads, and five combined medallions on the shillelaghs. On June 10, 2010, the NCAA ruled that USC was guilty of a &quot;lack of institutional control&quot; involving the football, men's basketball and women's tennis programs. The result was the NCAA vacating all USC wins from the [[2005 USC Trojans football team|2005 season]], including the [[2005 USC vs. Notre Dame football game|2005 Notre Dame vs. USC game]]. It is unclear whether the trophy will be changed to reflect this decision. &lt;ref name=&quot;USC 2005 Season Forfeiture&quot;/&gt;
