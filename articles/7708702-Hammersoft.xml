'''Irma Bunt''' is the main henchwoman in the [[James Bond]] novel and film ''[[On Her Majesty's Secret Service (film)|On Her Majesty's Secret Service]]''. She is portrayed by German actress [[Ilse Steppat]]. The role was Steppat's only [[English language|English]] speaking part.

A stocky, red haired middle aged woman, Irma Bunt resides at the mountain-top clinic of [[Piz Gloria]] with [[Ernst Stavro Blofeld]]. Bunt is first introduced at a train station taking Bond up to the clinic by sleigh and helicopter while he is disguised as [[Sir Hilary Bray]]. She ostensibly looks after the girls who are suffering allergies â and secretly being brainwashed into &quot;angels of death&quot; &amp;mdash; and has dinner with them and &quot;Sir Hilary&quot;. A red-haired disciplinarian in the mold of [[Rosa Klebb]], Bunt is determined to keep any fraternizing between &quot;Sir Hilary&quot; and the girls kept to a minimum. In the film Bond himself subtly insults her by telling her that her name comes from a nautical word for the baggy, swollen part of a sail, though in the novel Bond starts tricking her into thinking she's a duchess.

When Bond escapes from Piz Gloria after his cover as Sir Hilary Bray is blown, Bunt helps some of the men pursue him in the village at the bottom of the mountain with a [[Mercedes-Benz W111]]. She fails in this and is almost killed when she is caught in an explosion at a [[stock car]] rally which Tracy had led her into in an attempt to shake her off. Bunt and the other three occupants of the car managed to escape it just before the explosion, but one of them was caught in the blast while crawling away - though the camera did not have enough focus for the viewer to see who it was, nor was the identity of the person mentioned later.

She is not seen again until right at the end of the film after 007's wedding (a scene deleted from the film had Bunt trailing Bond and Tracy when they are purchasing a wedding ring from a jewellery store). Bunt shows up, alive and well, in a car driven by Blofeld. As they pass the newlyweds, Bunt leans out of the window and fires at Bond with an [[M16 rifle|M16]]. Bond is unharmed, but Tracy is killed.

Unusually for a Bond film villain, Bunt escaped punishment and retribution from 007: she was neither seen nor mentioned in the following film, ''[[Diamonds Are Forever (film)|Diamonds Are Forever]]'' (actress Ilse Steppat had died just after ''On Her Majesty's Secret Service'' reached cinemas), where Bond avenges Tracy's death by relentlessly tracking down and killing Blofeld. Other villains, such as [[Jaws (James Bond)|Jaws]], survive because they switched allegiances. In the book ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]'', Bond incapacitates her before the final show-down with Blofeld and it is later stated that she was subsequently killed in the destruction of the castle in which they were living. She is the main villain in [[Raymond Benson]]'s 1997 short story [[James Bond uncollected short stories#&quot;Blast from the Past&quot;|&quot;Blast from the Past&quot;]], an unofficial sequel to ''[[You Only Live Twice (novel)|You Only Live Twice]]''.

==Blofeld's Angels of Death==
The '''Angels of Death''' are several beautiful women from all over the world (though in the novel, only ten from the UK) being brainwashed by [[Blofeld]] under the guise of allergy treatment.

Blofeld claimed he will rescind this threat if all his past crimes are pardoned and he is recognized as the current Count de Bleauchamp. In the novel, Ruby's last name is &quot;Windsor&quot;, and a subplot emerges with Bond (as Hilary Bray) promising to track her heritage.
