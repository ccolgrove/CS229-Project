== History ==
TV Bandeirantes was founded on May 13, 1967, by [[:pt:JoÃ£o Saad|JoÃ£o Saad]], nephew of [[SÃ£o Paulo (state)|SÃ£o Paulo state]] governor [[Ademar de Barros]] and owner of [[RÃ¡dio Bandeirantes]]. In [[1969]] the TV's building suffered a massive [[fire]], which forced Saad to renew his broadcasting equipment. By [[1972]], TV Bandeirantes was the first Brazilian television network to fully broadcast in color, the same year that [[Rede Globo]] did the same. Later in the 70s Bandeirantes became a national [[Television network|broadcasting network]]. The network launched a [[digital television|digital over-the-air feed]] in SÃ£o Paulo. One of the most successful network's show is called CQC, based on the [[Argentina]] version called [[Caiga Quien Caiga]], aired live on Monday nights, with a Saturday night replay.
