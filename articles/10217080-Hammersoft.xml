The '''Yamaha RGX''' and '''RGZ''' [[electric guitar]]s Series are manufactured by the [[Yamaha Corporation]] and bear a close resemblance to the [[Ibanez RG]] series, the [[Jackson Soloist]] and other &quot;superstrat&quot; enhanced copies of the [[Fender Stratocaster]]. These Taiwan-made instruments were introduced in 1987.

RGX Series guitars often have 24 or more frets and a [[bolt-on neck]]. Some high-end models use a neck-through-body design.  Some come with Yamaha active [[Pick up (music technology)|pickups]], two single coils and one humbucker.
 
Most of these instruments were generally known as RGZ, including the RGZ820R, a custom plaid graphic model with two [[humbucker]]s and a Floyd Rose licensed locking tremolo, played by rock guitarist [[Blues Saraceno]]. 

The RGX guitars were upgraded in 2003 with a 3D headstock sporting a 3+3 tuner layout and a piezo bridge option for acoustic-like tones. Famous endorsees of the RGX/RGZ guitars included Blues Saraceno and [[Ty Tabor]] of [[King's X]], who got his namesake RGX-TT and RGX-TTD6 signature models in 2000.
