==History==

St. Cloud State University opened its doors to students in 1869, under the name '''Third State Normal School'''. The school consisted of one building, the Stearns House, a renovated hotel purchased by the state Legislature for $46,000. Classrooms were on the first floor, the &quot;model school&quot; was on second floor and a women's dormitory was housed on the third floor. The five-member faculty was headed by Principal Ira Moore. Of the 53 original students, 43 were women. In 1898, the school began offering a junior college curriculum.

In 1914, the school dropped its secondary education program entirely. The legislature authorized a name change in 1921, allowing the school to adopt the name '''St. Cloud State Teachers College''' (the word &quot;teachers&quot; was deleted in 1957). The first bachelor's degrees were awarded in 1925, with master's degree programs offered beginning in 1953.

In 1975, St. Cloud State became a university, comprising five colleges and a graduate school. The G.R. Herberger Business School is recognized as one of the top business colleges in the country and is one of only four in the state that is nationally accredited. Within the past decade, the College of Science and Engineering established and gained full accreditation for its Computer Engineering program. It is the only university in Minnesota that offers an ABET accredited Manufacturing Engineering Program. It also offers ABET accredited Electrical and Mechanical Engineering programs, along with Computer Science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abet.org/AccredProgramSearch/AccreditationSearch.aspx|title=Accredited Programs|publisher=ABET Inc.|accessdate=2010-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; St. Cloud State University's Master of Engineering Management is the only program in Minnesota that is certified by the American Society of Engineering Management (ASEM).

In 1987, men's hockey became an NCAA Division I program. Two years later the team moved into a new two-rink arena called the National Hockey Center. In 1998, the university added a women's hockey team at the Division I level. 

In 2010, the university teamed with the private sector to build a welcome center and student housing complex adjacent to campus. The university leases the Welcome Center and Coborn Plaza Apartments.

Riverview Renovated

===Lawrence Hall renovated===

After an extensive restoration project in 2002 and 2003, St. Cloud State reopened the doors to historic Lawrence Hall to host a cultural melting pot of international and American Students studying foreign languages. The hall was first built in 1895 housing women students and later housing men for a few years. After originally being touted as fireproof, the building burned beyond repair and a new Lawrence Hall was built in 1905. It once again served as housing until it was retired in 1974 with exception to the basement floor which was used to facilitate a Math Skills Center. The Math Skills Center was forced out of the hall in 1999 after the structure was deemed unfit. After being distinguished as a campus eyesore efforts began to start a restoration campaign of the hall with funding for the project coming from the state's Legislation's bonding bill in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stcloudstate.edu/news/outlook/story.asp?storyID=11439&amp;issueID=7888|title=Lawrence Hall| publisher=St. Cloud State University|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
