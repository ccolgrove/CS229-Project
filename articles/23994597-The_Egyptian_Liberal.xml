'''The Green Path of Hope''' ({{lang-fa|Ø±Ø§Ù Ø³Ø¨Ø² Ø§ÙÛØ¯}}) is an [[Iran]]ian association established by Iranian presidential campaign candidate, [[Mir-Hossein Mousavi]], on August 15, 2009, as the organizational body of [[Green Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=103859&amp;sectionid=351020101|title=Khatami, Karroubi join Mousavi's Green movement|date=18 Aug 2009|publisher=[[Press TV]]|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mousavi described it as the &quot;countless self-initiated and independent social networks&quot; which form the body of Green Movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/irans-mousavi-to-lead-green-hope-opposition-20090816-em89.html|title=Iran's Mousavi to lead 'green hope' opposition|date= August 16, 2009 |publisher=SMH|accessdate=26 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been mentioned as a &quot;political front&quot; in media.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-iran-mousavi16-2009aug16,0,5218913.story Mousavi forms new political front], [[LA Times]], August 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ilna1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=71239|title=Mousavi issues first statments(sic) on &quot;Green path of hope&quot;|accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Name==
According to Mousavi's advisor, Ali Reza Beheshti, Mousavi himself chose the name. He chose Path, so he wouldn't have to use the words &quot;party&quot; or &quot;movement&quot;, &quot;green&quot;, because of the green color symbol used by protesters, and &quot;hope&quot;, because he had promised to establish a government of &quot;hope&quot; if elected.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.gooya.com&quot;&gt;http://news.gooya.com/politics/archives/2009/08/092369.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
The Green Path of Hope seeks to continue protests against the legitimacy of Ahmadinejad's presidency following lawful and peaceful ways, and the full execution of the constitution, as Mousavi says:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parlemannews.ir/index.aspx?n=2694&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|You can't follow some parts of the constitution and throw the rest into a bin.}}

==History==
[[Image:IranflagAzadiGreenPNG.png|thumb|200px|The &quot;Azadi Flag&quot; of The Green Path of Hope]]
Mousavi didn't name his movement as a political party or even a movement, but a &quot;path&quot;, because according to Iranian law parties and movements need to be authorized by the [[Ministry of Interior (Iran)|Interior Ministry]] and since neither Mousavi recognizes the government legitimate and the ministry is very unlikely to grant him permission, he chose this name to bypass the law.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.gooya.com&quot;/&gt;

Mousavi is quoted in describing the movement:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Top_News/2009/08/16/Mousavi-announces-new-political-party/UPI-34501250401917/ Mousavi announces new political party], [[UPI]], August 16, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

{{epigraph
 | quote =  &lt;font face=&quot;Georgia&quot;&gt; &quot;The Green Path of Hope is formed for the sake of peopleâs rightful demands and for claiming their rights... the color green is the symbol of this movement; its slogan is demanding the impeccable implementation of the constitution, and innumerable self-motivated independent societies form the body of this movement.&quot; &lt;/font&gt; |cite = }}

According to organization officials the movement functions on campaign basis including [[political parties]], NGO's and social networks. Referring to new movement Mousavi said on Saturday &quot;The Green Path of Hope is formed for the sake of people's rightful demands and for claiming their denied rights&quot;.&lt;ref name=ilna1 /&gt; He pointed that autonomous and spontaneous social networks in community are part of this movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;ilna2&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ilna.ir/fullStory.aspx?ID=71086|title=Green path of hope, Mousavi's new organization |accessdate=2009-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;During election our mottos chose and remained in constitutional frame work, today we are devoted to those slogans&quot; he said. &quot;We believe if people's demands were treated fairly and instead of using media to link spontaneous movements to foreigners, government promoted truth by fair criticism, they could satisfy public views&quot;, he added.&lt;ref name=ilna2 /&gt;

==Methods==
The way has six main members of the central council, that are connected to the [[reformist]] parties and movements, NGOs, and the social networks. The main body will be the ordinary protesters. The method is to create pressure from the lower parts of the society and make them connected in a social network, and therefore to lead the protests in a lawful way.&lt;ref name=&quot;news.gooya.com&quot;/&gt;

==Members of the Central Council==
The Green Path of Hope has three central leaders. [[Hossein Ali Montazeri]] also had a leading role in the movement in the earlier phase of the movement.
