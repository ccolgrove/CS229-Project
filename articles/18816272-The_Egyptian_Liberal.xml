The '''Qasr al-Nil Bridge''' spans the [[Nile River]] in central [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]]. It connects [[downtown Cairo]] to [[Gezira Island]] and the [[Zamalek]] district.  At the bridge's east and west approaches there are two large stone [[lion]] statues flanking each entrance, they are late 19th century works by French [[sculptor]] and [[animalier]] [[Henri Alfred Jacquemart]]. The newer and wider [[6th October Bridge]] parallels its route {{convert|0.8|km|mi}} to the south.

[[Qasr el-Nil Street]] crosses over the Nile on the bridge, from the east bank area [[Tahrir Square|Tahrir SquareâLiberation Square]] (''Midan Tahrir'') in downtown Cairo, past the huge [[The Mogamma]] government building and the [[Headquarters of the Arab League]], then onto the Qasr al-Nil Bridge over the river to Gezira Island. There it passes Opera Square and the [[Cairo Opera House]], with connections to the [[Cairo Tower]] and other places in the Zamalek district, and then crosses on the Al-Tahrir Bridge from the island to the west bank's [[Agouza]] district.  

==Construction and name==
The previous bridge on the site, Kobri el Gezira Bridge, was built in 1872. The foundation stone for the present Qasr al-Nil Bridge was laid by King [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] on February 4th, 1931. &lt;ref name=structurae/&gt; After over two years of construction, King Fuad inaugurated the bridge's opening on June 6th, 1933. 

The bridge was originally named Khedive Ismail Bridge after King Fuad's father, [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha]]. After the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1952]], the name of the bridge, as well as other Egyptian buildings and bridges, were changed.  This bridge was renamed ''Qasr al-Nil'' in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which translates as Palace of the Nile.&lt;ref name=&quot;latimes&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Cairoâs bridge of dreams |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/aug/14/world/fg-bridge14 |author=Fleishman, Jeffrey |date=August 14, 2007 |publisher=Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public use and demonstrations==
The Qasr al-Nil Bridge, with sidewalks, is popular for strolling in the evenings.  The bridge offers views of the river, as well as landmark buildings, hotels, and other structures on the island and along the Corniche Al-Nile on the west bank.  The bridge is popular as location for young Egyptian friends and couples to have an inexpensive outdoor date.

===2011 Egyptian Revolution===
{{main|2011 Egyptian Revolution}}
The bridge has been an ongoing site in the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]], along with the nearby [[6th October Bridge]], for public demonstrations on it and as a major route east to the ''Midan Tahrir''âTahrir Square protest gatherings.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News: [http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-12312330 &quot;Egypt protests: curfew defied in Cairo and other cities&quot;] 29 January 2011. accessed 2011.01.29.]&lt;/ref&gt;
