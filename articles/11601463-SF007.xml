The '''Parallels Plesk Panel''' (ex: Parallels Plesk Control Panel, Plesk Server Administrator, PSA,{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} or just Plesk) software package is a commercial [[web hosting]] automation program.  Originally released under the U.S. company Plesk Inc. and designed in [[Novosibirsk]], Russia, Plesk was acquired by [[SWSoft]] in July 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hostreview.com/news/news/030610swsoft.html HostReview : Web Hosting News : SWsoft Acquires Plesk and Confixx to Create Global Hosting Software Powerhouse]&lt;/ref&gt; SWSoft renamed themselves under the [[Parallels, Inc.|Parallels]] name (a brand which had been acquired by SWSoft) in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/01/30/parallels_virtuozzo_containers_4point0/ SWsoft Parallels does Virtuozzo Containers 4.0 thing] - Hypervisors are for the weak - Posted in Servers, 30th January 2008 20:59 GMT(By Austin Modine) The Register&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.techrepublic.com.com/tech-news/?p=1744 SWsoft to change its name to Parallels] - Date: December 11th, 2007 Author: Paul Mah (TechRepublic.com)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
Parallels Plesk Panel allows a server [[system administrator|administrator]] to set up new [[website]]s, [[reseller]] accounts, [[e-mail]] accounts, and [[Domain name system|DNS]] entries through a [[web browser|web]]-based interface.  The administrator can create client and site templates, which predetermine resource-allocation parameters for the domains and/or clients.

Parallels Plesk Panel for [[GNU/Linux|Linux]]/[[Unix-like|UNIX]] supports multiple [[POSIX]] platforms, including [[Debian]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Red Hat Linux]], [[SUSE Linux distributions|SUSE]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]. Parallels Plesk Panel for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] supports [[Windows Server 2003]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] operating systems.

Parallels Plesk Panel installs custom versions of or manages versions of [[MySQL]] and [[PostgreSQL]] databases ([[Microsoft SQL Server]] and [[MSDE|Microsoft SQL Server Desktop Engine]] under Windows), [[Apache Tomcat]] [[Java platform]] server, [[ColdFusion]] server, as well as ''[[CounterStrike]]'' and ''[[Battlefield 1942]]'' game servers.

== Add-ons ==
Parallels Plesk Panel has several software packs that are not part of the main Parallels Plesk Panel code base.  These add-ons are designed to fully interact with Parallels Plesk Panel.  These Parallels Plesk Panel software packs include functionality for billing, website building, and multiple server support.

They include:
* Parallels Plesk Customer &amp; Business Manager (formerly Plesk Billing)
* Parallels Plesk Sitebuilder
* Parallels Plesk Expand

== Reported issues ==
{{POV-section|date=April 2011}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2011}}
=== Security ===
Attackers routinely attack the Plesk interfaces to obtain root/admin access since Plesk does not enforce strong passwords by default. This makes them an easy and lucrative target for malicious users attempting to compromise Internet hosts. Plesk also runs many services on external interfaces by default (e.g. mysql), which means that they are generally exploited very quickly by attackers.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Some users have complained that Plesk is not secure in the sense of multihosting security since all virtual hosts are run under the same Apache user and share the same configuration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2007/Sep/0303.html Full Disclosure: PLESK hosting mass deface&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in Plesk 7.5.6 for Windows and onward, all virtual hosts can run under their own worker process group, secured using their own respective IIS user. In Plesk for Linux, one could use the [http://mpm-itk.sesse.net/ apache2-mpm-itk (Multi-Processing Module)] or the alternative [[suEXEC]]+[[FastCGI]]+[[PHP]] solution - both of which are not directly related to plesk itself.  Plesk also defaults to port 8443 for [[HTTP_Secure|HTTPS]] applications, this clashes with both Microsoft ISA servers and Microsoft Small Business Servers, which disallow non-standard ports for HTTPS.

Plesk offers users the possibility to install web applications with just a few mouse clicks using the [[Application_Packaging_Standard|Application Packaging Standard]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apsstandard.org/ Application Packaging Standard]&lt;/ref&gt; On the downside, it's not always possible to upgrade these applications as easily to fix [[World_Wide_Web#Security|security problems]], which might lead to vulnerable servers.

=== Interface ===
The Plesk control panel uses a [[Transport Layer Security|SSL]]-enabled web based [[Graphical user interface|GUI]], using [[Framing (World Wide Web)|frames]].

=== Backup and restore ===
One shortcoming in Plesk's data backup and restore functionality is the mechanism by which Plesk stores backup files, using server disk space before uploading files to a separate FTP server. Because Plesk backup files can be quite large, this mechanism effectively limits the usable server storage space, forcing administrators to choose between not backing up data or leaving large amounts of storage unused.
