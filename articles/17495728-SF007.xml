The '''reliability of [[Wikipedia]]''' (primarily of the [[English Wikipedia|English language version]]), compared to other [[encyclopedia]]s and more specialized sources, is assessed in many ways, including [[statistics|statistically]], through comparative review, analysis of the historical patterns, and strengths and weaknesses inherent in the editing process unique to Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title= Snared in the Web of a Wikipedia Liar |author= Katharine Q.

Several studies have been done to assess the reliability of Wikipedia. A notable early study in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' said that in 2005, Wikipedia scientific articles came close to the level of accuracy in ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'' and had a similar rate of &quot;serious errors&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesJ2005Internet&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Jim Giles|title=Internet encyclopedias go head to head|journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]|volume=438|pages=900â901|month=December|year=2005|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/full/438900a.html|doi=10.1038/438900a|pmid=16355180|issue=7070|authorlink=Jim Giles (reporter)|bibcode=2005Natur.438..900G}} The study (which was not in itself peer reviewed) was cited in many news articles such as this: {{cite news|title=Wikipedia survives research test|date=December 15, 2005|work=[[BBC News]]|publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation|BBC]]|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4530930.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study by ''Nature'' was disputed by ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://corporate.britannica.com/britannica_nature_response.pdf Fatally Flawed: Refuting the recent study on encyclopedic accuracy by the journal Nature] ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', Inc., March 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and later ''Nature'' responded to this refutation with both a formal response and a point-by-point rebuttal of ''Britannica'''s main objections.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/britannica/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2008 and 2010, articles in medical and scientific fields such as [[pathology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=A|coauthors=Struthers, K|title=Pathology education, Wikipedia and the Net generation.|journal=Medical teacher|year=2010|volume=32|issue=7|pages=618|pmid=20653388|quote=We have identified Wikipedia as an informative and accurate source for Pathology education and believe that Wikipedia is potentially an important learning tool for of the âNet Generationâ.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[toxicology]],&lt;ref name=Tox09/&gt; [[oncology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leithner|first=A|coauthors=Maurer-Ertl, W, Glehr, M, Friesenbichler, J, Leithner, K, Windhager, R|title=Wikipedia and osteosarcoma: a trustworthy patients' information?|journal=Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA|date=2010 Jul-Aug|volume=17|issue=4|pages=373â4|pmid=20595302}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pharmaceuticals]]&lt;ref name=Drug08/&gt; comparing Wikipedia to professional and [[peer-review]]ed sources found that Wikipedia's depth and coverage were of a high standard.

Wikipedia is open to anonymous and [[collaborative editing]], so assessments of its reliability usually include examinations of how quickly false or misleading information is removed. An early study conducted by [[IBM]] researchers in 2003âtwo years following Wikipedia's establishmentâfound that &quot;vandalism is usually repaired extremely quickly â so quickly that most users will never see its effects&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/projects/history_flow/results.htm history flow: results] IBM Collaborative User Experience Research Group, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that Wikipedia had &quot;surprisingly effective self-healing capabilities&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Fernanda B.

Nonetheless, there are still hundreds of millions of damaged views.&quot;&lt;ref name=mngrp07/&gt;

Several incidents have also been publicized in which false information has lasted for a long time in Wikipedia.  In May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article on [[John Seigenthaler Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.&lt;ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday/&gt; The inaccurate information went unnoticed until September 2005, when they were discovered by a friend of Seigenthaler. After the information was removed from Wikipedia, it remained for another three weeks on sites which mirror Wikipedia content.&lt;ref name=SeigenthalerABC/&gt; A biographical article in French Wikipedia portrayed LÃ©on-Robert de LâAstran as an 18th century anti-slavery ship owner, which led [[SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal]], a presidential candidate, to praise him. A student investigation later determined that the article was a hoax and de LâAstran had never existed.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesFrenchWPHoax&quot;/&gt;

== Wikipedia editing model ==
The [[Wikipedia:Editorial oversight and control|Wikipedia model]] allows anyone to edit, and relies on a large number of well-intentioned editors to overcome issues raised by a smaller number of problematic editors. It is inherent in Wikipedia's editing model that misleading information can be added, but over time quality is anticipated to improve in a form of [[group learning]] as editors reach [[consensus]], so that substandard edits will very rapidly be removed. This assumption is still being tested, and its limitations and reliability are not yet a settled matter. Wikipedia is a pioneer in communal [[knowledge building]] of this kind. It contrasts with many more traditional models of knowledge and [[publishing]], which attempt to limit content creation to a relatively small group of approved editors in order to exercise strong [[hierarchy|hierarchical]] control. In order to improve reliability, some editors have called for &quot;stable versions&quot; of articles,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wikipedia:Stable versions]]&lt;/ref&gt; or articles that have been reviewed by the community and locked from further editing.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Wikipedia:Protection policy]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia allows anonymous editing: contributors are not required to provide any identification, or even an email address. A 2007 study at [[Dartmouth College]] of the English Wikipedia noted that, contrary to usual social expectations, anonymous editors were some of Wikipedia's most productive contributors of valid content.&lt;ref name=&quot;samaritan&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=The Quality of Open Source Production: Zealots and Good Samaritans in the Case of Wikipedia |author=Anthony, Smith, Williamson |date = 2005 (Preliminary) 2007 (updated) |url=http://www.cs.dartmouth.edu/reports/abstracts/TR2007-606/ |accessdate=2007-11-05|quote=We find that quality that is associated with contributor motivations ... Registered users' quality increases with more contributions ... Surprisingly, however, we find the highest quality from the vast numbers of anonymous 'Good Samaritans' who contribute only once. Our findings that Good Samaritans as well as committed &quot;zealots&quot; contribute high quality content to Wikipedia suggest that it is the quantity as well as the quality of contributors that positively affects the quality of open source production.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Dartmouth study was criticized by John Timmer  of the [[Ars Technica]] website for its methodological shortcomings.&lt;ref name=Dartmouth&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20071018-anonymous-good-samaritans-may-produce-wikipedias-best-content.html|title=Anonymous &quot;good samaritans&quot; produce Wikipedia's best content, says study|author=John Timmer|publisher=Ars Technica|date=2007-10-18|accessdate=2007-10-27|quote=Good samaritans with less than 100 edits made higher-quality contributions than those with registered accounts and equal amounts of content. In fact, anonymous contributors with a single edit had the highest quality of any group. But quality steadily declined, and more-frequent anonymous contributors were anything but Samaritans; their contributions generally didn't survive editing... The authors also recognize that contributions in the form of stubs on obscure topics might survive unaltered indefinitely, inflating the importance of single contributions...Objective ratings of quality are difficult, and it's hard to fault the authors for attempting to find an easily-measured proxy for it. In the absence of independent correlation, however, it's not clear that the measurement used actually works as a proxy. Combined with the concerns regarding anonymous contributor identity, there are enough problems with this study that the original question should probably be considered unanswered, regardless of how intuitively satisfying these results are.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While Wikipedia has the potential for extremely rapid growth and harnesses an entire communityâmuch in the same way as other communal projects such as [[Linux]]âit goes further in trusting the same community to self-regulate and become more proficient at [[quality control]]. Wikipedia has harnessed the work of millions of people to produce the world's largest knowledge-based site along with software to support it, resulting in more than nineteen million articles written, across more than 280 different language versions, in less than twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://s23.org/wikistats/wikipedias_html |title=WikiStats by S23 - List of Wikipedias |publisher=s23Wiki |accessdate=2011-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, there has been considerable interest in the project both academically and from diverse fields such as [[information technology]], [[business]], [[project management]], knowledge acquisition, [[software programming]], other [[collaboration|collaborative projects]] and [[sociology]], to explore whether the Wikipedia model can produce quality results, what collaboration in this way can reveal about people, and whether the scale of involvement can overcome the obstacles of individual limitations and poor editorship which would otherwise arise.

Another reason for inquiry is a growing and widespread reliance on Wikipedia by both websites and individuals, who use it as a source of information, raising concerns over such a major source being susceptible to rapid change, including the whimsical introduction of misinformation. It is the responsibility of those who intend to use such a dynamically changing, multi-authored source to ascertain the quality and reliability of articles, and the degree of usefulness, misinformation or [[vandalism]] which might be expected, in order to decide what reliance to place upon them. A helpful safeguard is always to reference Wikipedia accurately when it is quoted to allow false or unreliable material to be identified and corrected.

=== Areas of reliability ===
The reliability of Wikipedia articles can be measured by the following criteria:

:* Accuracy of information provided within articles
:* Appropriateness of the images provided with the article
:* Appropriateness of the style and focus of the articles&lt;ref name=&quot;Stvilia2008Information&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Besiki Stvilia|title=Information Quality Work Organization in Wikipedia|journal=[[Journal of the American Society for Information Science and Technology]]|volume=59|pages=983â1001|month=April|year=2008|url=http://mailer.fsu.edu/~bstvilia/papers/stvilia_wikipedia_infoWork_p.pdf|doi=10.1002/asi.20813|last2=Twidale|first2=Michael B.|last3=Smith|first3=Linda C.|last4=Gasser|first4=Les|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:* Susceptibility to, and exclusion and removal of, false information
:* Comprehensiveness, scope and coverage within articles and in the range of articles
:* Identification of reputable [[source text|third-party sources]] as [[citation]]s
:* Stability of the articles
:* Susceptibility to editorial and [[systemic bias]]
:* Quality of writing

The first four of these have been the subjects of various studies of the project, while the presence of bias is strongly disputed on both sides, and the prevalence and quality of citations can be tested within Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB125893981183759969.html?mod=WSJ_hpp_MIDDLENexttoWhatsNewsTop Wall Street Journal]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Assessments ==
=== Comparative studies ===
On October 24, 2005, British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' published a story titled  &quot;Can you trust Wikipedia?&quot; in which a panel of experts was asked to review seven entries related to their fields, giving each article reviewed a number designation out of ten points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/opinion/story/0,16541,1599325,00.html|title=Can you trust Wikipedia?|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2007-10-28 | location=London | date=2005-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scores ranged from 0 to 8, but most received marks between 5 and 8. The most common criticisms were:
# Poor prose, or ease-of-reading issues (3 mentions)
# Omissions or inaccuracies, often small but including key omissions in some articles (3 mentions)
# Poor balance, with less important areas being given more attention and vice versa (1 mention)
The most common praises were:
# Factually sound and correct, no glaring inaccuracies (4 mentions)
# Much useful information, including well selected links, making it possible to &quot;access much information quickly&quot; (3 mentions)

In December 2005, the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' conducted a [[blind experiment|single-blind]] study comparing the accuracy of a sample of articles from Wikipedia and ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''. The sample included 42 articles on scientific topics, including biographies of well-known scientists. The articles were compared for accuracy by academic reviewers who remained anonymous â a customary practice for journal article reviews. Based on their review, the average Wikipedia article contained 4 errors or omissions; the average ''Britannica'' article, 3. Only 4 serious errors were found in Wikipedia, and 4 in ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica''. The study concluded: &quot;Wikipedia comes close to ''Britannica'' in terms of the accuracy of its science entries&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesJ2005Internet&quot;/&gt; although Wikipedia's articles were often &quot;poorly structured&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesJ2005Internet&quot;/&gt;

''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' expressed concerns, leading ''Nature'' to release further documentation of its survey method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nature.com/news/2005/051212/exref/supplementary_information.doc|work=Nature|title=Supplementary information to accompany Nature news article &quot;Internet encyclopedias go head to head&quot;|date=2005-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this additional information, ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' denied the validity of the ''Nature'' study, stating that it was &quot;fatally flawed&quot;. Among ''Britannica'''s criticisms were that excerpts rather than the full texts of some of their articles were used, that some of the extracts were compilations that included articles written for the youth version, that ''Nature'' did not check the factual assertions of its reviewers, and that many points which the reviewers labeled as errors were differences of editorial opinion.&lt;ref name=FF&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corporate.britannica.com/britannica_nature_response.pdf|title=Fatally Flawed â Refuting the recent study on encyclopedic accuracy by the journal ''Nature''|date=March 2006|publisher=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica, Inc.|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nature'' acknowledged the compiled nature of some of the ''Britannica'' extracts, but denied that this invalidated the conclusions of the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title = Britannica attacks | journal = [[Nature (journal)|Nature]]| volume = 440 | page = 582 | doi = 10.1038/440582b | date = 2006-03-30

In June 2006, [[Roy Rosenzweig]], a professor specializing in American history, published a comparison of the Wikipedia biographies of 25 Americans to the corresponding biographies found on Encarta and ''American National Biography Online''. He wrote that Wikipedia is &quot;surprisingly accurate in reporting names, dates, and events in U.S. history&quot;, with some of the errors being &quot;widely held but inaccurate beliefs&quot;. However, he stated that Wikipedia often fails to distinguish important from trivial details, and does not provide the best references. He also complained about Wikipedia's lack of &quot;persuasive analysis and interpretations, and clear and engaging prose.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rosenzweig&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Roy Rosenzweig|title=Can History be Open Source?

A web-based survey conducted from December 2005 to May 2006 by Larry Press, a professor of Information Systems at [[California State University at Dominguez Hills]], assessed the &quot;accuracy and completeness of Wikipedia articles&quot;. Fifty people (a fairly low response rate) accepted an invitation to assess an article. Of the fifty, thirty-eight (76%) agreed or strongly agreed that the Wikipedia article was accurate, and twenty-three (46%) agreed or strongly agreed that it was complete. Eighteen people compared the article they reviewed to the article on the same topic in the ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''. Opinions on accuracy were almost equal between the two encyclopedias (6 favoring Britannica, 7 favoring Wikipedia, 5 stating they were equal), and eleven (61%) found Wikipedia somewhat or substantially more complete, compared to seven (39%) for Britannica. The survey did not attempt random selection of the participants, and it is not clear how the participants were invited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Survey of Wikipedia accuracy and completeness| publisher=Larry Press, Professor of Computer Information Systems, California State University| year=2006| url=http://bpastudio.csudh.edu/fac/lpress/wikieval| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German computing magazine ''[[c't]]'' performed a comparison of ''[[Brockhaus Multimedial premium|Brockhaus Multimedial]]'', ''[[Encarta|Microsoft Encarta]]'', and the [[German Wikipedia]] in October 2004: Experts evaluated 66 articles in various fields. In overall score, Wikipedia was rated 3.6 out of 5 points (B-).&lt;ref&gt;Michael Kurzidim: Wissenswettstreit. Die kostenlose Wikipedia tritt gegen die MarktfÃ¼hrer Encarta und Brockhaus an, in: [[c't]] 21/2004, October 4, 2004, S. 132â139.&lt;/ref&gt; A second test by ''c't'' in February 2007 used 150 search terms, of which 56 were closely evaluated, to compare four digital encyclopedias: [[Bertelsmann]] EnzyklopÃ¤die 2007, Brockhaus Multimedial premium 2007, Encarta 2007 EnzyklopÃ¤die and Wikipedia. It concluded: &quot;We did not find more errors in the texts of the free encyclopedia than in those of its commercial competitors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Dorothee Wiegand: &quot;Entdeckungsreise.

Viewing Wikipedia as fitting the economists' definition of a perfectly competitive marketplace of ideas, George Bragues ([[University of Guelph-Humber]]), examined Wikipedia's articles on seven top Western philosophers: [[Aristotle]], [[Plato]], [[Immanuel Kant]], [[RenÃ© Descartes]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and [[John Locke]]. Wikipedia's articles were compared to a consensus list of themes culled from four reference works in philosophy. Bragues found that, on average, Wikipedia's articles only covered 52% of consensus themes. No errors were found, though there were significant omissions.&lt;ref&gt;Bragues, George, &quot;Wiki-Philosophizing in a Marketplace of Ideas: Evaluating Wikipedia's Entries on Seven Great Minds&quot; (April 2007).

''[[PC Pro]]'' magazine (August 2007) asked experts to compare four articles (a small [[sample size|sample]]) in their scientific fields between Wikipedia, Britannica and Encarta. In each case Wikipedia was described as &quot;largely sound&quot;, &quot;well handled&quot;, &quot;performs well&quot;, &quot;good for the bare facts&quot; and &quot;broadly accurate.&quot; One article had &quot;a marked deterioration towards the end&quot; while another had &quot;clearer and more elegant&quot; writing, a third was assessed as less well written but better detailed than its competitors, and a fourth was &quot;of more benefit to the serious student than its Encarta or Britannica equivalents.&quot; No serious errors were noted in Wikipedia articles, whereas serious errors were noted in one Encarta and one Britannica article.&lt;ref name=&quot;uncovered&quot;&gt;''PC Pro'' magazine, August 2007, p. 136, &quot;Wikipedia Uncovered&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, Australian magazine ''PC Authority'' published a feature article on the accuracy of Wikipedia. The article compared Wikipedia's content to other popular online encyclopedias, namely [[Britannica]] and [[Encarta]]. The magazine asked experts to evaluate articles pertaining to their field. Wikipedia was comparable to the other encyclopedias, topping the chemistry category.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcauthority.com.au/Feature/93908,wikipedia-uncovered.aspx/1|title=''PC Authority'' â 'Wikipedia Uncovered'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2007, German magazine ''[[Stern (magazine)|Stern]]'' published the results of a comparison between the German Wikipedia and the online version of the 15-volume edition of [[Brockhaus EnzyklopÃ¤die]]. The test was commissioned to a research institute (Cologne-based ''WIND GmbH''), whose analysts assessed 50 articles from each encyclopedia (covering politics, business, sports, science, culture, entertainment, geography, medicine, history and religion) on four criteria (accuracy, completeness, timeliness and clarity), and judged Wikipedia articles to be more accurate on the average (1.6 on a scale from 1 to 6, versus 2.3 for Brockhaus with 1 as the best and 6 as the worst). Wikipedia's coverage was also found to be more complete and up to date; however, Brockhaus was judged to be more clearly written, while several Wikipedia articles were criticized as being too complicated for non-experts, and many as too lengthy&lt;!--&quot;Einige Wikipedia-Artikel sind fÃ¼r Laien schlicht zu kompliziert, viele zu weitschweifig, urteilten die Tester.&quot;--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Wikipedia: Wissen fÃ¼r alle''.

In its April 2008 issue British computing magazine ''[[PC Plus]]'' compared the English Wikipedia with the DVD editions of ''World Book Encyclopedia'' and ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'', assessing for each the coverage of a series of random subjects. It concluded ''The quality of content is good in all three cases'' and advised Wikipedia users ''Be aware that erroneous edits do occur, and check anything that seems outlandish with a second source. But the vast majority of Wikipedia is filled with valuable and accurate information.''&lt;ref&gt;Simon Williams: ''[http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/web/wikipedia-vs-encyclopaedia-a-question-of-trust-316163 Wikipedia vs Encyclopaedia: A question of trust?

=== Expert opinion ===
==== Librarian views ====
In a 2004 interview with ''[[The Guardian]]'', self-described information specialist and Internet consultant&lt;ref&gt;Self description taken from [[blog]] biography, {{cite web | title=Phil Bradley â biography| publisher=Phil Bradley| year=2007| url=http://www.philb.com/philbiog.htm| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Philip Bradley said that he would not use Wikipedia and was &quot;not aware of a single librarian who would. The main problem is the lack of authority. With printed publications, the publishers have to ensure that their data are reliable, as their livelihood depends on it. But with something like this, all that goes out the window.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Who knows?| author=Simon Waldman| work=[[The Guardian]]| date=October 26, 2004|  accessdate=2011-02-03 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2004/oct/26/g2.onlinesupplement | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 review&lt;ref name=&quot;libraryjournal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=I want my Wikipedia!| publisher=Library Journal| date=April 2006| url=http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6317246.html| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of Wikipedia by ''[[Library Journal]]'', using a panel of librarians, &quot;the toughest critics of reference materials, whatever their format&quot;, asked &quot;long standing reviewers&quot; to evaluate three areas of Wikipedia (popular culture, current affairs, and science), and concluded: &quot;While there are still reasons to proceed with caution when using a resource that takes pride in limited professional management, many encouraging signs suggest that (at least for now) Wikipedia may be granted the librarian's seal of approval&quot;. A reviewer who &quot;decided to explore controversial historical and current events, hoping to find glaring abuses&quot; concluded &quot;I was pleased by Wikipedia's objective presentation of controversial subjects&quot; but that &quot;as with much information floating around in cyberspace, a healthy degree of skepticism and skill at winnowing fact from opinion are required.&quot; Other reviewers noted that there is &quot;much variation&quot; but &quot;good content abounds.&quot;

In 2007, [[Michael Gorman (librarian)|Michael Gorman]], former president of the [[American Library Association (ALA)]]  stated in an ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'' blog that &quot;A professor who encourages the use of Wikipedia is the intellectual equivalent of a dietician who recommends a steady diet of Big Macs with everything.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gorman|first=Michael|title=Jabberwiki: The Educational Response, Part II|url=http://www.britannica.com/blogs/2007/06/jabberwiki-the-educational-response-part-ii/|work=Enclyopaedia Britannica Blog|publisher=Encyclopaedia Britainnica, Inc.|accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The library at [[Trent University]] in [[Ontario]] states of Wikipedia that many articles are &quot;long and comprehensive&quot;, but that there is &quot;a lot of room for misinformation and bias [and] a lot of variability in both the quality and depth of articles.&quot; It adds that Wikipedia has advantages and limitations, that it has &quot;excellent coverage of technical topics&quot; and articles are &quot;often added quickly and, as a result, coverage of current events is quite good&quot;, comparing this to traditional sources which are unable to achieve this task. It concludes that depending upon the need, one should think critically and assess the appropriateness of one's sources, &quot;whether you are looking for fact or opinion, how in-depth you want to be as you explore a topic, the importance of reliability and accuracy, and the importance of timely or recent information&quot;, and adds that Wikipedia can be used in any event as a &quot;starting point.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trentu.ca/library/help/wikipedia.html |title=Trent University Library : About Wikipedia |publisher=Trentu.ca |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An article for the [[Canadian Library Association]] (CLA)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wikipedia Grows Up|author=Peter Binkley|publisher=Feliciter 52 (2006), no. 2, 59â61|year=2006|url=http://www.wallandbinkley.com/quaedam/?p=65#more-65|accessdate=October 31, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses the Wikipedia approach, process and outcome in depth, commenting for example that in controversial topics, &quot;what is most remarkable is that the two sides actually engaged each other and negotiated a version of the article that both can more or less live with.&quot; The author comments that:
{{quotation|In fact Wikipedia has more institutional structure than at first appears. Some 800 experienced users are designated as administrators [Update: As of 2009 some 1600 on English Wikipedia alone], with special powers of binding and loosing: they can protect and unprotect, delete and undelete and revert articles, and block and unblock users. They are expected to use their powers in a neutral way, forming and implementing the consensus of the community. The effect of their intervention shows in the discussion pages of most contentious articles. Wikipedia has survived this long because it is easier to reverse vandalism than it is to commit it...}}

''[[Information Today]]'' (March 2006) cites librarian Nancy OâNeill (principal librarian for Reference Services at the Santa Monica Public Library System) as saying that &quot;there is a good deal of skepticism about Wikipedia in the library community&quot; but that &quot;she also admits cheerfully that Wikipedia makes a good starting place for a search. You get terminology, names, and a feel for the subject.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;informationtoday&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Wikipedia and Britannica: The kid's all right.| publisher=Searcher (&quot;The Magazine for Database Professionals&quot;), part of Information Today, Inc.| date=March 2006| url=http://www.infotoday.com/searcher/mar06/berinstein.shtml| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''PC Pro'' (August 2007) cites the head of the European and American Collection at the [[British Library]], Stephen Bury,  as stating &quot;Wikipedia is potentially a good thing â it provides a speedier response to new events, and to new evidence on old items.&quot; The article concludes: &quot;For [Bury], the problem isn't so much the reliability of Wikipedia's content so much as the way in which it's used. &quot;It's already become the first port of call for the researcher&quot;, Bury says, before noting that this is &quot;not necessarily problematic except when they go no further.&quot; According to Bury, the trick to using Wikipedia is to understand that &quot;just because it's in an encyclopedia (free, web or printed) doesn't mean it's true. Ask for evidence .. and contribute.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uncovered&quot; /&gt;

====Academia====
Academics have also criticized Wikipedia for its perceived failure as a reliable source, and because Wikipedia editors may not have degrees or other credentials generally recognized in academia.&lt;ref name = Duke /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Susan_Youngwood&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

An empirical study conducted in 2006 by a [[Nottingham University]] Business School lecturer in Information Systems,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1413/1331|author=Chesney, Thomas|date=May 16, 2006|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the subject of a review on the technical website ''[[Ars Technica]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Study cited in {{cite web | title=Experts rate Wikipedia's accuracy higher than non-experts| publisher='[[Ars Technica]]''| date=November 27, 2006| url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061127-8296.html| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; involving 55 academics asked to review specific Wikipedia articles that either were in their expert field (group 1) or chosen at random (group 2), concluded that &quot;The experts found Wikipedia's articles to be more credible than the nonâexperts. This suggests that the accuracy of Wikipedia is high. However, the results should not be seen as support for Wikipedia as a totally reliable resource as, according to the experts, 13 percent of the articles contain mistakes (10% of the  experts reported factual errors of an unspecified degree, 3% of them reported spelling errors).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The study explains that &quot;In the survey, all respondents under Condition 1 were asked if there were any mistakes in the article they had been asked to read. Only five reported seeing mistakes and one of those five reported spelling mistakes rather than factual errors. This suggests that 13 percent of Wikipedia's articles have errors.&quot; Thus 80% of the 13% related to factual errors and 20% of the 13% related to spelling errors. {{cite journal|url=http://firstmonday.org/htbin/cgiwrap/bin/ojs/index.php/fm/article/view/1413/1331|title=An empirical examination of Wikipedia's credibility|author=Chesney, Thomas|date=May 16, 2006|accessdate=2010-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gould Library at [[Carleton College]] in [[Minnesota]] has a web-page describing the use of Wikipedia in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Using Wikipedia| author=Matt Bailey| publisher=Lawrence McKinley Gould Library, Carleton College| date=October 2, 2007| url=http://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/for_faculty/faculty_find/wikipedia/| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It asserts that &quot;Wikipedia is without question a valuable and informative resource&quot;, but that &quot;there is an inherent lack of reliability and stability&quot; to its articles, again drawing attention to similar advantages and limitations as other sources. As with other reviews it comments that one should assess one's sources and what is desired from them, and that &quot;Wikipedia may be an appropriate resource for some assignments, but not for others.&quot; It cited Jimmy Wales' view that Wikipedia may not be ideal as a source for all academic uses, and (as with other sources) suggests that at the least, one strength of Wikipedia is that it provides a good starting point for current information on a very wide range of topics.

In 2007, the ''[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]'' published an article written by [[Cathy Davidson]], Professor of Interdisciplinary Studies and English at [[Duke University]], in which she asserts that Wikipedia should be used to teach students about the concepts of reliability and credibility.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;We Canât Ignore the Influence of Digital Technologies,&quot; ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', March 23, 2007, http://chronicle.com/subscribe/login?url=/weekly/v53/i29/29b02001.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[Hamlet Isakhanli]], founder and president of [[Khazar University]], compared the ''EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica'' and English Wikipedia articles on [[Azerbaijan]] and related subjects. His study found that Wikipedia covered the subject much more widely, more accurately and in more detail, though with some lack of balance, and that Wikipedia was the best source for the first approximation.&lt;ref&gt;What is Happening in the Educational System of the Contemporary World and How &quot;The State Program on Reforms of the Higher Education System in the Republic of Azerbaijan for the Period of 2008â2012&quot; May Best be Carried Out (in Azeri). Khazar University Press, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Steve Jones, a professor of communication at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said that the number of Wikipedia articles is so large that it &quot;seems impossible that they could police it in an effective way&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirtytricks&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,193634,00.html | title=Wikipedia Becomes Hotbed of Political Dirty Tricks | accessdate=2011-02-23 | date=2006-04-28 | work=Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Geoffrey Nunberg]], an adjunct full professor at UC Berkeley's School of Information, has criticized Wikipedia for relying too much on citing sources even though the said sources may not be more accurate than Wikipedia itself.&lt;ref&gt;

Some academic journals do refer to Wikipedia articles, but are not elevating it to the same level as traditional references. For instance, Wikipedia articles have been referenced in &quot;enhanced perspectives&quot; provided on-line in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''. The first of these perspectives to provide a hyperlink to Wikipedia was &quot;A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Linden, Hartmut|date=2002-08-02| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/summary/297/5582/777|title=A White Collar Protein Senses Blue Light|work=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|accessdate=2005}} (subscription access only)&lt;/ref&gt; and dozens of enhanced perspectives have provided such links since then. The publisher of ''Science'' states that these enhanced perspectives &quot;include hypernotes â which link directly to websites of other relevant information available online â beyond the standard bibliographic references&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaas.org/publications/books_reports/CCLI/PDFs/01_D_Perspectives.pdf|title=Perspectives from AAAS|publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science|author=Yolanda S.

&lt;!--The academic world's view of Wikipedia has improved during the last few years, as can be inferred from the increase in the number  of citations in international scientific journals. A search in the ''[[ScienceDirect]]'' database (a large online collection of published scientific research produced by [[Elsevier]]) for academic and scientific journal articles citing Wikipedia in their references, yields the following result to 5 June 2010:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=ScienceDirect Indexed Papers| publisher=ScienceDirect| date=Various dates| url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleListURL&amp;_method=list&amp;_ArticleListID=1359637889&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=4&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=7fea708946cfc13e05e816774d4a4093 | accessdate=2010-06-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Science and medicine ====
Science and medicine are areas where accuracy is of high importance and [[peer review]] is the norm. While some of Wikipedia's content has passed a form of peer review, most has not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heilman|first=JM|coauthors=Kemmann, E, Bonert, M, Chatterjee, A, Ragar, B, Beards, GM, Iberri, DJ, Harvey, M, Thomas, B, Stomp, W, Martone, MF, Lodge, DJ, Vondracek, A, de Wolff, JF, Liber, C, Grover, SC, Vickers, TJ, MeskÃ³, B, Laurent, MR|title=Wikipedia: a key tool for global public health promotion.|journal=Journal of medical Internet research|date=2011-01-31|volume=13|issue=1|pages=e14|pmid=21282098|doi=10.2196/jmir.1589}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2008 study examined 80 Wikipedia drug entries. The researchers found few factual errors in this set of articles, but determined that these articles were often missing important information, like [[contraindications]] and [[drug interactions]]. One of the researchers noted that &quot;If people went and used this as a sole or authoritative source without contacting a health professional...those are the types of negative impacts that can occur.&quot; The researchers also compared Wikipedia to [[Medscape Drug Reference]] (MDR), by looking for answers to 80 different questions covering eight categories of drug information, including adverse drug events, dosages, and mechanism of action. They have determined that MDR provided answers to 82.5 percent of the questions, while Wikipedia could only answer 40 percent, and that answers were less likely to be complete for Wikipedia as well. None of the answers from Wikipedia were determined factually inaccurate, while they found four inaccurate answers in MDR. But the researchers found 48 errors of omission in the Wikipedia entries, compared to 14 for MDR. The lead investigator concluded: &quot;I think that these errors of omission can be just as dangerous [as inaccuracies]&quot;, and he pointed out that drug company representatives have been caught deleting information from Wikipedia entries that make their drugs look unsafe.&lt;ref name=Drug08&gt;{{cite journal |author= Clauson KA, Polen HH, [[Maged N.

A 2009 survey asked US toxicologists how accurately they rated the portrayal of health risks of chemicals in different media sources. It was based on the answers of 937 members of the [[Society of Toxicology]] and found that these experts regarded Wikipedia's reliability in this area as far higher than that of all traditional news media:
{{quote|In perhaps the most surprising finding in the entire study, all these national media outlets [U.S. newspapers, news magazines, health magazines, broadcast and cable television networks] are easily eclipsed by two representatives of &quot;new media&quot;: [[WebMD]] and Wikipedia. WebMD is the only news source whose coverage of chemical risk is regarded as accurate by a majority (56 percent) of toxicologists, closely followed by Wikipedia&amp;#39;s 45 percent accuracy rating. By contrast, only 15 percent describe as accurate the portrayals of chemical risk found in the New York Times, Washington Post, and Wall Street Journal.&lt;ref name=Tox09&gt;S.

In 2010 researchers compared 10 types of cancer to data from the [[National Cancer Institute]]'s Physician Data Query and concluded &quot;the Wiki resource had similar accuracy and depth to the professionally edited database&quot; and that &quot;sub-analysis comparing common to uncommon cancers demonstrated no difference between the two&quot;, but that ease of readability was an issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajagopalan ''et al''|title=Accuracy of cancer information on the Internet: A comparison of a Wiki with a professionally maintained database|journal=Journal of Clinical Oncology 28:7s, 2010|year=2010|url=http://abstract.asco.org/AbstView_74_41625.html|accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study in 2011 came to the result that categories most frequently absent in Wikipedia's drug articles are those of drug interactions and medication use in breastfeeding.&lt;ref name=Lavsa2011&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.cptl.2011.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other categories with incomplete coverage were descriptions of off-label indications, contraindications and precautions, adverse drug events and dosing.&lt;ref name=Lavsa2011/&gt; Information most frequently deviating from other sources used in the study were that of contraindications and precautions, drug absorption and adverse drug events.&lt;ref name=Lavsa2011/&gt;

==== Editors of other encyclopedias ====
In a 2004 piece called &quot;The Faith-Based Encyclopedia&quot;, [[Robert McHenry]], a former editor-in-chief of ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'', stated that Wikipedia errs in billing itself as an encyclopedia, because that word implies a level of authority and accountability that he believes cannot be possessed by an openly editable reference. McHenry argued that &quot;the typical user doesn't know how conventional encyclopedias achieve reliability, only that they do.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-based encyc&quot;/&gt;  He added:
{{quote|[H]owever closely a Wikipedia article may at some point in its life attain to reliability, it is forever open to the uninformed or semiliterate meddlerâ¦ The user who visits Wikipedia to learn about some subject, to confirm some matter of fact, is rather in the position of a visitor to a public restroom. It may be obviously dirty, so that he knows to exercise great care, or it may seem fairly clean, so that he may be lulled into a false sense of security. What he certainly does not know is who has used the facilities before him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;faith-based encyc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=The Faith-Based Encyclopedia| author=[[Robert McHenry]]| work=[[Tech Central Station]]| date=November 15, 2004| url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=111504a| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Similarly, ''Britannica''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s executive editor, [[Ted Pappas]], was quoted in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as saying:
{{quote|The premise of Wikipedia is that continuous improvement will lead to perfection. That premise is completely unproven.&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot; /&gt;}}

In the September 12, 2006 edition of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', [[Jimmy Wales]] debated with [[Dale Hoiberg]], editor-in-chief of &lt;CITE&gt;''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''&lt;/CITE&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj9-12-2006&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/public/article/SB115756239753455284-A4hdSU1xZOC9Y9PFhJZV16jFlLM_20070911.html|title=The Wall Street Journal Online|accessdate=2006-09-13 | date=2006-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoiberg focused on a need for expertise and control in an encyclopedia and cited [[Lewis Mumford]] that overwhelming information could &quot;bring about a state of intellectual enervation and depletion hardly to be distinguished from massive ignorance.&quot;

Wales emphasized Wikipedia's differences, and asserted that openness and transparency lead to quality.  Hoiberg claimed that he &quot;had neither the time nor space to respond to [criticisms]&quot; and &quot;could corral any number of links to articles alleging errors in Wikipedia&quot;, to which Wales responded: &quot;No problem! Wikipedia to the rescue with a fine article&quot;, and included a link to the Wikipedia article ''Criticism of Wikipedia''.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj9-12-2006&quot; /&gt;

==== Other ====
In one article, ''Information Today'' (March 2006) likens&lt;ref name=&quot;informationtoday&quot; /&gt; comparisons between Wikipedia and ''Britannica'' to &quot;[[Apples and Oranges]]&quot;:
{{quote|Even the revered ''Encyclopaedia Britannica'' is riddled with errors, not to mention the subtle yet pervasive biases of individual subjectivity and corporate correctness... There is no one perfect way. Britannica seems to claim that there is. Wikipedia acknowledges there's no such thing. Librarians and information professionals have always known this. That's why we always consult multiple sources and counsel our users to do the same.}}

[[BBC]] [[technology]] specialist [[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] wrote&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=What is it with Wikipedia?| author=Bill Thompson| publisher='[[BBC]]''| date=16 December 2005| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/4534712.stm| accessdate=2007-10-31| authorlink=Bill Thompson (technology writer) }}&lt;/ref&gt; that &quot;Most Wikipedia entries are written and submitted in good faith, and we should not let the contentious areas such as politics, religion or biography shape our view of the project as a whole&quot;, that it forms a good starting point for serious research but that:
{{quote|No information source is guaranteed to be accurate, and we should not place complete faith in something which can so easily be undermined through malice or ignorance...  That does not devalue the project entirely, it just means that we should be skeptical about Wikipedia entries as a primary source of information... It is the same with search engine results. Just because something comes up in the top 10 on [[MSN Search]] or [[Google]] does not automatically give it credibility or vouch for its accuracy or importance.}}
Thompson adds the observation that since most popular online sources are inherently unreliable in this way, one byproduct of the [[information age]] is a wiser audience who are learning to check information rather than take it on faith due to its source, leading to &quot;a better sense of how to evaluate information sources.&quot;

The Supreme Court of India in its judgment in Commr. of Customs, Bangalore vs. ACER India Pvt. (Citation 2007(12)SCALE581) has held that &quot;We have referred to Wikipedia, as the learned Counsel for the parties relied thereupon. It is an online encyclopaedia and information can be entered therein by any person and as such it may not be authentic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;B.

In his 2007 ''Guide to Military History on the Internet'', [[Simon Fowler (author)|Simon Fowler]] rated Wikipedia as &quot;the best general resource&quot; for military history research, and stated  that &quot;the results are largely accurate and generally free of bias.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Fowler (author)|Fowler, Simon]] ''Guide to Military History on the Internet'', UK:Pen &amp; Sword, ISBN 9781844156061, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  When rating WP as the No. 1 military site he mentioned that  &quot;Wikipedia is often criticised for its inaccuracy and bias, but in my experience the military history articles are spot on.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Fowler (author)|Fowler, Simon]] ''Guide to Military History on the Internet'', UK:Pen &amp; Sword, ISBN 9781844156061, p. 201&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, ''[[The Economist]]'' magazine described Wikipedia as &quot;a user-generated reference service&quot; and noted that Wikipedia's &quot;elaborate moderation rules put a limit to acrimony&quot; generated by cyber-nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/world/international/displayStory.cfm?source=hptextfeature&amp;story_id=11792535 |title=Cyber-nationalism &amp;#124; The brave new world of e-hatred |publisher=Economist.com |date=2008-07-24 |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Andrew Orlowski]], a columnist for ''[[The Register]]'', expressed similar criticisms, writing that the use of the term &quot;encyclopedia&quot; to describe Wikipedia may lead users into believing it is more reliable than it may be.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/12/wikipedia_no_responsibility/page2.html|title=Who's responsible for Wikipedia?|last=Orlowski|first=Andrew |date=2005-12-12|work=The Register|accessdate=2009-06-30|quote=The public has a firm idea of what an 'encyclopedia' is, and it's a place where information can generally be trusted, or at least slightly more trusted than what a labyrinthine, mysterious bureaucracy can agree upon, and surely more trustworthy than a piece of spontaneous graffitiâand Wikipedia is a king-sized cocktail of the two.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Information loop====
Criticism and concerns have been expressed about other sources (such as newspapers) which silently use Wikipedia as a reference source. The danger is that if the original information in Wikipedia was false, the fact that it has been reported in other media means that there is now a [[WP:Reliable Source|reliable source]] to reference the false information in Wikipedia, giving it apparent respectability. This in turn increases the likelihood of the false information being reported in other media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seomoz.org/blog/a-reputation-20-problem |title=A Reputation 2.0 Problem â Wiki-Circularity |publisher=SEOmoz |date= |accessdate=2010-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Cade.

=== Removal of false information ===
Fernanda ViÃ©gas of the MIT Media Lab and Martin Wattenberg and Kushal Dave of IBM Research studied the flow of editing in the Wikipedia model, with emphasis on breaks in flow (from vandalism or substantial rewrites), showing the dynamic flow of material over time.&lt;ref name=chi2004&gt;{{cite web | title=Studying Cooperation and Conflict between Authors with history flow Visualizations| author=Fernanda B. ViÃ©gas, Martin Wattenberg, Kushal Dave | publisher=CHI 2004, Vol. 6 No. 1| date=24â29 April 2004| url=http://alumni.media.mit.edu/~fviegas/papers/history_flow.pdf| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  From a sample of vandalism edits on the English Wikipedia during May 2003, they found that most such acts were repaired within minutes, summarizing:
{{quote|We've examined many pages on Wikipedia that treat controversial topics, and have discovered that most have, in fact, been vandalized at some point in their history. But we've also found that vandalism is usually repaired extremely quicklyâso quickly that most users will never see its effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=History flow: results| author=Fernanda B. ViÃ©gas, Martin Wattenberg, Kushal Dave | publisher=IBM Collaborative User Experience Research Group| year=2004| url=http://www.research.ibm.com/visual/projects/history_flow/results.htm| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
They also stated that &quot;it is essentially impossible to find a crisp definition of vandalism&quot;.&lt;ref name=chi2004/&gt;

Lih (2004) compared articles before and after they were mentioned in the press, and found that externally referenced articles are of higher quality work.

An informal assessment by the popular IT magazine ''PC Pro'' for its 2007 article &quot;Wikipedia Uncovered&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;uncovered&quot; /&gt; tested Wikipedia by introducing 10 errors that &quot;varied between bleeding obvious and deftly subtle&quot; into articles (the researchers later corrected the articles they had edited). Labeling the results &quot;impressive&quot; it noted that all but one was noted and fixed within the hour, and that &quot;the Wikipedians' tools and know-how were just too much for our team.&quot; A second series of another 10 tests, using &quot;far more subtle errors&quot; and additional techniques to conceal their nature, met similar results: &quot;despite our stealth attempts the vast majority... were discovered remarkably quickly... the ridiculously minor Jesse James error was corrected within a minute and a very slight change to Queen Anne's entry was put right within two minutes.&quot; Two of the latter series were not detected. The article concluded that &quot;Wikipedia corrects the vast majority of errors within minutes, but if they're not spotted within the first day the chances... dwindle as you're then relying on someone to spot the errors while reading the article rather than reviewing the edits.&quot;

A study in late-2007 systematically inserted inaccuracies into Wikipedia entries about the lives of philosophers. Depending on how exactly the data are interpreted, either one third or one half of the inaccuracies were corrected within 48 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, P.D.

=== Susceptibility to bias ===
==== Individual bias and the WikiScanner tool ====
{{Main|WikiScanner}}
In August 2007, WikiScanner, a tool developed by [[Virgil Griffith]] of the California Institute of Technology, was released to match anonymous IP edits in the encyclopedia with an extensive database of addresses. News stories appeared about IP addresses from various organizations such as the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]], [[Diebold|Diebold, Inc.]] and the [[Government of Australia|Australian government]] being used to make edits to Wikipedia articles, sometimes of an opinionated or questionable nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blakely|first=Rhys|title=Exposed: guess who has been polishing their Wikipedia entries?|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article2264150.ece|work=The Times of London|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110612023406/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article2264150.ece|archivedate=June 12, 2011}} [http://web.archive.org/web/20090517025259/http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/media/article2264150.ece?token=null&amp;offset=12 page 2]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] quoted a Wikimedia spokesperson as praising the tool: &quot;We really value transparency and the scanner really takes this to another level. Wikipedia Scanner may prevent an organization or individuals from editing articles that they're really not supposed to.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/6947532.stm|title=Wikipedia 'shows CIA page edits'|date=2007-08-15|accessdate=2007-08-15|publisher=BBC|author=Jonathan Fildes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WikiScanner story was also covered by ''[[The Independent]]'', which stated that many &quot;censorial interventions&quot; by editors with vested interests on a variety of articles in Wikipedia had been discovered:
{{quote|[Wikipedia] was hailed as a breakthrough in the democratisation of knowledge. But the online encyclopedia has since been hijacked by forces who decided that certain things were best left unknown... Now a website designed to monitor editorial changes made on Wikipedia has found thousands of self-serving edits and traced them to their original source. It has turned out to be hugely embarrassing for armies of political spin doctors and corporate revisionists who believed their censorial interventions had gone unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/sci_tech/article2874112.ece|title=Wikipedia and the art of censorship|author=Robert Verkaik|date=2007-08-18|publisher=The Independent|accessdate=2007-10-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Not everyone hailed WikiScanner as a success for Wikipedia. [[Oliver Kamm]], in a column for ''[[The Times]]'', argued instead that:&lt;ref name=okw&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/columnists/guest_contributors/article2267665.ece Wisdom? More like dumbness of the crowds | Oliver Kamm â Times Online]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The WikiScanner is thus an important development in bringing down a pernicious influence on our intellectual life. Critics of the web decry the medium as the cult of the amateur. Wikipedia is worse than that; it is the province of the covert lobby. The most constructive course is to stand on the sidelines and jeer at its pretensions.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

WikiScanner only reveals conflicts of interest when the editor does not have a Wikipedia account and their IP address is used instead. Conflict of interest editing done by editors with accounts is not detected, since those edits are anonymous to everyone â except for a [[Wikipedia:RFCU|handful of privileged Wikipedia admins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/12/18/the_wikipedia_paradox/ |author=Cade Metz |title=Truth, anonymity and the Wikipedia Way: Why it's broke and how it can be fixed |publisher=The Register |date=December 18, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Coverage====
{{See also|Academic studies about Wikipedia#A minority of editors produce the majority of persistent content}}

Wikipedia has been accused of [[systemic bias]], which is to say its general nature leads, without necessarily any conscious intention, to the propagation of various prejudices. Although many articles in newspapers have concentrated on minor, indeed trivial, factual errors in Wikipedia articles, there are also concerns about large scale, presumably unintentional effects from the increasing influence and use of Wikipedia as a research tool at all levels. In an article in the ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' magazine (London) [[philosopher]] Martin Cohen frames Wikipedia of having &quot;become a monopoly&quot; with &quot;all the prejudices and ignorance of its creators&quot;, which he describes as a &quot;youthful cab-drivers&quot; perspective.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen 26&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Encyclopaedia Idiotica |first=Martin |last=Cohen |journal=Times Higher Education |issue=28 August 2008 |page=26 |url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403327}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen's argument, however, finds a grave conclusion in these circumstances: &quot;To control the reference sources that people use is to control the way people comprehend the world. Wikipedia may have a benign, even trivial face, but underneath may lie a more sinister and subtle threat to freedom of thought.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen 26&quot;/&gt; That freedom is undermined by what he sees as what matters on Wikipedia,  &quot;not your sources but the 'support of the community'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cohen 26&quot;/&gt;

Critics also point to the tendency to cover topics in a detail disproportionate to their importance. For example, [[Stephen Colbert]] once mockingly praised Wikipedia for having a &quot;longer entry on '[[lightsaber]]s' than it does on the '[[printing press]]'.&quot;&lt;ref name =&quot;ColbertReport&quot;&gt;Stephen Colbert, ''The Colbert Report'', episode 3109, August 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''The Guardian'', Dale Hoiberg, the editor-in-chief of ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]'', noted:&lt;blockquote&gt;People write of things they're interested in, and so many subjects don't get covered; and news events get covered in great detail. In the past, the entry on [[Hurricane Frances]] was more than five times the length of that on [[Chinese art]], and the entry on ''[[Coronation Street]]'' was twice as long as the article on [[Tony Blair]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot;/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This critical approach has been satirised as &quot;Wikigroaning&quot;, a term coined by Jon Hendren&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Oh, that John Locke |first=Jamin |last=Brophy-Warren |journal=The Wall Street Journal |issue=June 16, 2007 |pages=P3 |url=http://online.wsj.com/article_email/SB118194482542637175-lMyQjAxMDE3ODExNzkxNDc0Wj.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the website [[Something Awful]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Art of Wikigroaning |date=2007-06-05 |first=Johnny &quot;DocEvil&quot; |last=Hendren |accessdate=2007-06-17 |work=Something Awful |url=http://www.somethingawful.com/d/news/wikigroaning.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, two articles (preferably with similar names) are compared: one about an acknowledged serious or classical subject and the other about a topic popular or current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abrown&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal| first=Andrew |last=Brown| issue=June 14, 2007 |title=No amount of collaboration will make the sun orbit the Earth |journal=The Guardian |url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,2101810,00.html | location=London | date=2007-06-14 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Defenders of a broad inclusion criteria have held that the encyclopedia's coverage of pop culture does not impose space constraints on the coverage of more serious subjects (see &quot;[[:meta:Wiki is not paper|Wiki is not paper]]&quot;). As Ivor Tossell noted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That Wikipedia is chock full of useless arcana (and did you know, by the way, that the article on &quot;Debate&quot; is shorter than the piece that weighs the relative merits of the 1978 and 2003 versions of Battlestar Galactica?) isn't a knock against it: Since it can grow infinitely, the silly articles aren't depriving the serious ones of space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20070615.wweb15/BNStory/Technology/home|title=Duality of Wikipedia|author=Ivor Tossell|work=[[Toronto Globe and Mail]]|date=2007-06-15|accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Wikipedia has been accused of deficiencies in comprehensiveness because of its voluntary nature, and of reflecting the systemic biases of its contributors. Former Nupedia editor-in-chief [[Larry Sanger]] stated in 2004, &quot;when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;SangerElitism&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism| author=[[Larry Sanger]]| work=[[Kuro5hin]]| date=December 31, 2004| url=http://www.kuro5hin.org/story/2004/12/30/142458/25| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[GamesRadar]] editorial, columnist Charlie Barrat juxtaposed Wikipedia's coverage of [[video game]]-related topics with its smaller content about topics that have greater real-world significance, such as God, World War II and former U.S. presidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/pc/f/the-wtf-world-of-wikipedia/a-2008062510326553058 | title=The WTF World of Wikipedia | accessdate=February 20, 2009 |author=Charlie Barratt | date=June 25, 2008 | publisher=[[Future Publishing]] | pages=1â5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia has been praised for making it possible for articles to be updated or created in response to current events. For example, the then-new article on the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] in its English edition was cited often by the press shortly after the incident.{{Citation needed|date=January 2007}} Its editors have also argued that, as a website, Wikipedia is able to include articles on a greater number of subjects than print encyclopedias may.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[Wikipedia:Replies to common objections]]&quot;, Wikipedia, 22:53 April 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Notability of article topics =====
{{See also | Deletionism and inclusionism in Wikipedia }}
Wikipedia's [[Notability in Wikipedia|notability]] guidelines, and the application thereof, are the subject of much criticism.&lt;ref name=Kirby&gt;J.P. Kirby (October 20, 2007). [http://www.the506.com/ramblings/20071020.html The Problem with Wikipedia.] J.P.'s Random Ramblings.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholson Baker]] considers the notability standards arbitrary and essentially unsolvable:&lt;ref name=Baker&gt;Volume 55, Nicholson Baker (March 20, 2008) [http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2008/mar/20/the-charms-of-wikipedia/?pagination=false The Charms of Wikipedia â The New York Review of Books] Vol. 55, Number 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
There are quires, reams, bales of controversy over what constitutes notability in Wikipedia: nobody will ever sort it out.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Criticizing the &quot;[[deletionists]]&quot;, Nicholson Baker then writes:&lt;ref name=Baker/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Still, a lot of good workâverifiable, informative, brain-leapingly strangeâis being cast out of this paperless, infinitely expandable accordion folder by people who have a narrow, almost grade-schoolish notion of what sort of curiosity an on-line encyclopedia will be able to satisfy in the years to come.

[...] It's harder to improve something that's already written, or to write something altogether new, especially now that so many of the World Bookâsanctioned encyclopedic fruits are long plucked. There are some people on Wikipedia now who are just bullies, who take pleasure in wrecking and mocking peoples' workâeven to the point of laughing at nonstandard &quot;[[Engrish]].&quot; They poke articles full of warnings and citation-needed notes and deletion prods till the topics go away.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yet another criticism&lt;ref&gt;Bobbie Johnson, Guardian Newspapers Limited, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; about the deletionists is this: &quot;The increasing difficulty of making a successful edit; the exclusion of casual users; slower growth â all are hallmarks of the deletionists approach.&quot;

Complaining that his own biography was on the verge of deletion for lack of notability, [[Timothy Noah]] argued that:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Noah |first=Timothy |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2160222/pagenum/all |title=Evicted from Wikipedia. â By Timothy Noah â Slate Magazine |publisher=Slate.com |date=2007-02-24 |accessdate=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wikipedia's notability policy resembles U.S. immigration policy before 9/11: stringent rules, spotty enforcement. To be notable, a Wikipedia topic must be &quot;the subject of multiple, non-trivial published works from sources that are reliable and independent of the subject and of each other.&quot; Although I have written or been quoted in such works, I can't say I've ever been the subject of any. And wouldn't you know, some notability cop cruised past my bio and pulled me over. Unless I get notable in a hurryâwin the Nobel Peace Prize? Prove I sired Anna Nicole Smith's baby daughter?âa &quot;sysop&quot; (volunteer techie) will wipe my Wikipedia page clean. It's straight out of [[Philip K. Dick]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the same article, Noah mentions that the Pulitzer Prize-winning writer [[Stacy Schiff]] was not considered notable enough for a Wikipedia entry before she wrote an extensive ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' article on Wikipedia itself.

===== Liberal bias =====
Another criticism is that a politically [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] bias is predominant. According to [[Jimmy Wales]]: &quot;The Wikipedia community is very diverse, from [[liberalism|liberal]] to [[conservatism|conservative]] to [[libertarianism|libertarian]] and beyond. If averages mattered, and due to the nature of the wiki software (no voting) they almost certainly don't, I would say that the Wikipedia community is slightly more liberal than the U.S. population on average, because we are global and the international community of English speakers is slightly more liberal than the U.S. population. There are no data or surveys to back that.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/mediashift/2006/04/email_debatewales_discusses_po.html|title=Wales Discusses Political Bias on Wikipedia|author=Mark Glaser|publisher=PBS Mediashift|date=2006-04-21|accessdate=2007-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Schlafly created [[Conservapedia]] because of his perception that Wikipedia contained a liberal bias.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news| last = Johnson | first = Bobbie | url = http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,,2024434,00.html | title = Conservapediaâthe US religious right's answer to Wikipedia | work = The Guardian | date = 2007-03-01 | location=London | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservapedia's editors have compiled a list of alleged examples of liberal bias in Wikipedia.&lt;ref name=&quot;itwire&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|last=Turner|first=Adam|title=Conservapedia aims to set Wikipedia right|url=http://www.itwire.com/content/view/10160/1154/|work=IT Wire|date=2007-03-05|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, an article in ''[[The Christian Post]]'' criticised Wikipedia's coverage of [[intelligent design]], saying that it was biased and hypocritical.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/article/20070509/27307_'Design'_Proponents_Accuse_Wikipedia_of_Bias,_Hypocrisy.htm|title='Design' Proponents Accuse Wikipedia of Bias, Hypocrisy|author= Doug Huntington|date=2007-05-09|accessdate=2007-08-09|work=The Christian Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lawrence Solomon]] of the ''[[National Review]]'' stated that Wikipedia articles on subjects like [[global warming]], intelligent design, and ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' are slanted in favor of liberal views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Solomon|first=Lawrence|title=Wikipropaganda On Global Warming|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/07/08/opinion/main4241293.shtml|work=National Review|publisher=CBSNews.com|date=2008-07-08|accessdate=2008-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a September 2010 issue of the conservative weekly ''[[Human Events]]'', [[Rowan Scarborough]] presented a critique of Wikipedia's coverage of American politicians prominent in the approaching [[United States midterm election|midterm election]]s as evidence of systemic liberal bias. Scarborough compares the biographical articles of liberal and conservative opponents in Senate races in the Alaska Republican primary and the Delaware and Nevada general election, emphasizing the quantity of negative coverage of [[Tea Party movement|tea party]]-endorsed candidates. He also cites some criticism by Lawrence Solomon and quotes in full the lead section of Wikipedia's article on the competing [[Conservapedia]] as evidence of an underlying bias.&lt;ref name=&quot;scarborough&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|last=Scarborough|first=Rowan|url=http://www.humanevents.com/article.php?id=39139 |title=Wikipedia Whacks the Right|date=2010-09-27|accessdate=2010-10-03|work=[[Human Events]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====American and corporate bias=====
Tim Anderson, a senior lecturer in [[political economy]] at the [[University of Sydney]], said that Wikipedia administrators display a U.S.-oriented bias in their interaction with editors, and in their determination of sources that are appropriate for use on the site. Anderson was outraged after several of the sources he used in his edits to [[Hugo ChÃ¡vez]], including ''Venezuela Analysis'' and ''[[Z Magazine]]'', were disallowed as &quot;unusable&quot;. Anderson also described Wikipedia's neutral point of view policy to ZDNet Australia as &quot;a facade&quot;, and that Wikipedia &quot;hides behind a reliance on corporate media editorials&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Browne (February 13, 2008) [http://www.zdnetasia.com/news/internet/0,39044908,62037725,00.htm Wikipedia accused of 'US-centric bias'] [[ZDNet]] Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Gender bias=====
[[Justine Cassell]], a professor and the director of the [[Human-Computer Interaction Institute]] at Carnegie Mellon University, has criticized Wikipedia for lacking not only women contributors but also extensive and in-depth encyclopedic attention to many topics regarding gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/02/02/where-are-the-women-in-wikipedia/a-culture-of-editing-wars | work=The New York Times | title=Room for Debate: A Culture of Editing Wars | date=2011-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article in ''The New York Times'' cites a Wikimedia Foundation study which found that fewer than 13% of contributors to Wikipedia are women. [[Sue Gardner]], the executive director of the foundation, said increasing diversity was about making the encyclopedia &quot;as good as it could be.&quot; Factors the article cited as possibly discouraging women from editing included the &quot;obsessive fact-loving realm,&quot; associations with the &quot;hard-driving hacker crowd,&quot; and the necessity to be &quot;open to very difficult, high-conflict people, even misogynists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Noam Cohen, [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/31/business/media/31link.html?_r=1&amp;adxnnl=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss&amp;adxnnlx=1296482628-WKqXsGSoGM9myNIYsHbqYw &quot;Define Gender Gap?

===Reliability as a source in other contexts===
Although Wikipedia is stated not to be a primary source, it has been used as evidence in legal cases. In one notable case, the trademark of [[Formula One]] racing decision,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Case ref. O-169-07: In the matter of application no 2277746C by Formula One Licensing B.V., to register the trade mark: &quot;F1&quot;| publisher=UK Government Intellectual Property Office| date=14 June 2007| url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-decisionmaking/t-challenge/t-challenge-decision-results/o16907.pdf| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[UK Intellectual Property Office]] considered both the reliability of Wikipedia, and its usefulness as a reliable source of evidence:
{{quote|Wikipedia has sometimes suffered from the self-editing that is intrinsic to it, giving rise at times to potentially [[libel]]lous statements.  However, inherently, I cannot see that what is in Wikipedia is any less likely to be true than what is published in a book or on the websites of news organisations.  [Formula One's lawyer] did not express any concerns about the Wikipedia evidence [presented by the plaintiff].  I consider that the evidence from Wikipedia can be taken at face value.&quot;
The case turned substantively upon evidence cited from Wikipedia in 2006 as to the usage and interpretation of the term ''[[Formula One]]''.}}

In the United States, the [[United States Court of Federal Claims]] has ruled that &quot;Wikipedia may not be a reliable source of information.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nordwall v. Secretary of Health &amp; Human Services, No. 05-123V, 2008 WL 857661, at *7 n.6 (Fed. Cl. Feb. 19, 2008) as cited in [http://docs.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/5:2008cv00904/204116/62/ Capcom Co., Ltd, et al. v. The MKR Group, Inc., No. C 08-0904 RS]&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;...Articles [from Wikipedia] do not - at least on their face - remotely meet this reliability requirement...A review of the Wikipedia website reveals a pervasive and, for our purposes, disturbing series of disclaimers...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Campbell v. Sec'y of Heath &amp; Human Servs., 69 Fed. Cl. 775, 781 (Ct. Cl. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia has also developed into a key source for some current new events such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]] and related [[tsunami]], and the 2007 [[Virginia Tech massacre]]. In the latter case, it cites the ''[[New York Times]]'', noting with 750,000 page views of the article in the two days after the event:
{{quote|Even ''[[The Roanoke Times]]'', which is published near [[Blacksburg, Virginia]], where the university is located, noted on Thursday that Wikipedia 'has emerged as the clearinghouse for detailed information on the event'.&lt;ref name=&quot;vtech&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Wikipedia emerges as key source for Virginia Tech shootings| publisher=Cyberjournalist.net| date=24 April 2007| url=http://www.cyberjournalist.net/news/004178.php| accessdate=2007-10-31 }} â ''cyberjournalist.net'' cites this article {{cite news | title=The Latest on Virginia Tech, From Wikipedia | author=Noam Cohen| publisher='[[The New York Times]]''| date=23 April 2007| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/23/technology/23link.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;oref=slogin| accessdate=2007-10-31 }} for the above quote.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The ''[[Washington Post]]'' commented similarly, in the context of [[2008 Presidential election]] candidate biographies, that despite occasional brief vandalism, &quot;it's hard to find a more up-to-date, detailed, thorough article on [[Barack Obama|Obama]] than Wikipedia's. As of Friday (14 September 2007), Obama's article â more than 22 pages long, with 15 sections covering his personal and professional life â had a reference list of 167 sources.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=On Wikipedia, Debating 2008 Hopefuls' Every Facet| author=Jose Antonio Vargas| work=[[Washington Post]], Page A01| date=September 17, 2007| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/09/16/AR2007091601699.html?hpid=topnews| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broad assessments===
Several commentators have drawn a middle ground, asserting that the project contains much valuable knowledge and has some reliability, even if the degree is not yet assessed with certainty. Many of the librarian and academic reviewers of Wikipedia cited above take such a view.

Others taking this view include [[Danah Boyd]], who in 2005 discussed Wikipedia as an academic source, concluding that &quot;[i]t will never be an encyclopedia, but it will contain extensive knowledge that is quite valuable for different purposes&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Academia and Wikipedia| author=[[Danah Boyd]]| publisher=Many-to-Many| date=January 4, 2005| url=http://www.corante.com/many/archives/2005/01/04/academia_and_wikipedia.php| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bill Thompson (technology writer)|Bill Thompson]] who stated &quot;I use the Wikipedia a lot. It is a good starting point for serious research, but I would never accept something that I read there without checking.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thompson&quot; /&gt;

Information Today's March 2006 article&lt;ref name=&quot;informationtoday&quot; /&gt; concludes on a similar theme:
{{quote|The inconvenient reality is that people and their products are messy, whether produced in a top-down or bottom-up manner. Almost every source includes errors... Many non-fiction books are produced via an appallingly sloppy process... In this author's opinion, the flap over Wikipedia was significantly overblown, but contained a silver lining: People are becoming more aware of the perils of accepting information at face value. They have learned not to consult just one source.}}

[[Dan Gillmor]], a [[Silicon Valley]] commentator and author commented in October 2004 that, &quot;I don't think anyone is saying Wikipedia is an absolute replacement for a traditional encyclopedia. But in the topics I know something about, I've found Wikipedia to be as accurate as any other source I've found.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Who&quot; /&gt;

Referencing [[Linus' Law]] of open-source development, Larry Sanger who is a co-founder&lt;ref name=&quot;Bergstein&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last=Bergstein|authorlink=Brian Bergstein|title=Sanger says he co-started Wikipedia|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17798723/|work=[[MSNBC]]|agency=Associated Press|date=March 25, 2007

[[Sheizaf Rafaeli]] and Yaron Ariel report how &quot;most people agree that at least the English version of Wikipedia is approaching critical mass where substantial content disasters should become rare.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Online motivational factors: Incentives for participation and contribution in Wikipedia, In A.

Likewise, technology figure [[Joi Ito]] wrote on Wikipedia's authority, &quot;[a]lthough it depends a bit on the field, the question is whether something is more likely to be true coming from a source whose resume sounds authoritative, or a source that has been viewed by hundreds of thousands of people (with the ability to comment) and has survived.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wikipedia attacked by ignorant reporter| author=[[Joi Ito]]| publisher=Joi Ito's Web| date=August 29, 2004| url=http://joi.ito.com/archives/2004/08/29/wikipedia_attacked_by_ignorant_reporter.html#c014592| accessdate=2007-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Loc Vu-Quoc]], professor for Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at the [[University of Florida]], has stated that &quot;sometimes errors may go for years without being corrected as experts don't usually read Wikipedia articles in their own field to correct these errors&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Vu-Quoc, L. [http://clesm.mae.ufl.edu/wiki.pub/index.php/Configuration_integral_%28statistical_mechanics%29 Configuration integral], VQWiki, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to the editor of ''[[Physics Today]]'', [[Gregg Jaeger]], an associate professor at [[Boston University]],&lt;ref&gt;Jaeger, G.[http://people.bu.edu/jaeger professional webpage]&lt;/ref&gt; has characterized Wikipedia as a medium that is susceptible to fostering &quot;anarchy and distortions&quot; in relation to scientific information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ptonline.aip.org/journals/doc/PHTOAD-ft/vol_61/iss_7/10_1.shtml Bits on Quantum Information], Letter to the Editor, Physics Today, Jul 2008, p.10.
&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was in response to a review of his book ''Quantum Information: An Overview'', that had questioned &quot;whether there is an audience for such encyclopedic texts, especially given the easy access to online sources of information such as the [[arXiv]] e-print server and Wikipedia.&quot;

People known to use or recommend Wikipedia as a reference source include [[film critic]] [[Roger Ebert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=-U3y_SgnQ6kC&amp;pg=PA529&amp;lpg=PA529&amp;dq=Roger+Ebert,+%22according+to+Wikipedia%22&amp;q= |author=[[Ebert, Roger]].|title='&amp;#39;Roger Ebert's Movie Yearbook 2009'&amp;#39; Page 529 |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2008-11-18|accessdate=2010-07-13|isbn=9780740777455}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ebert, Roger.

=== Tools for testing the reliability of articles ===
[[File:014-WW-Screenshot-Reliability of Wikipedia.png|thumb|Screenshot of Wiki-Watch rating of the article ''Reliability of Wikipedia'' rated as ''reliable source'' and additional orange WikiTrust marks for questionable edits]]
While experienced editors can view the article history and discussion page, for normal users it is not so easy to check whether information from Wikipedia is reliable. University projects from California, Switzerland and Germany try to improve that by methods of formal analysis and data mining. [[Wiki-Watch]] from Germany, which was inspired by the [[WikiBu]] from Switzerland, shows an evaluation up to five-stars for every English or German article in Wikipedia. Part of this rating is the Californian tool [[WikiTrust]] which shows the trustworthiness of single text parts of Wikipedia articles by white (trustworthy) or orange (not trustworthy) markings.&lt;ref&gt;Selena Mann: ''[http://www.itworldcanada.com/blogs/cooltools/2011/01/14/new-tool-used-to-evaluate-wikipedia/55979/ New tool used to evaluate Wikipedia.]'' In: it-World Canada.

== Notable incidents ==
=== False biographical information ===
[[File:Astran.JPG|thumb|300px|Cached version of a deleted biographical hoax in the French Wikipedia. Created in January 2007, the article on the fictional 18th century naturalist LÃ©on Robert de L'Astran was not deleted until June 2010, when a historian identified it as a hoax.&lt;ref name=&quot;lemonde.fr&quot;&gt;[http://www.lemonde.fr/politique/article/2010/06/07/quand-segolene-royal-cite-un-personnage-historique-qui-n-a-jamais-existe_1369150_823448.html &quot;SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal et LÃ©on-Robert de l'Astran, le savant qui n'a jamais existÃ©&quot;], ''[[Le Monde]]'', June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Inaccurate information may persist in Wikipedia for a long time before it is challenged. The most prominent cases reported by mainstream media involved biographies of living persons.

The [[Seigenthaler incident]] demonstrated that the subject of a biographical article must sometimes fix blatant lies about his own life. In May 2005, a user edited the [[biography|biographical]] article on [[John Seigenthaler Sr.]] so that it contained several false and [[defamation|defamatory]] statements.&lt;ref name=SeigenthalerUSAToday&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/editorials/2005-11-29-wikipedia-edit_x.htm|work=USA Today|date=2005-11-29|title=A false Wikipedia &quot;biography&quot;|author=John Siegenthaler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaccurate claims went unnoticed between May and September 2005 when they were discovered by [[Victor S. Johnson, Jr.]], a friend of Seigenthaler. Wikipedia content is often mirrored at sites such as [[Answers.com]], which means that incorrect information can be replicated alongside correct information through a number of web sources. Such information can develop a misleading air of authority because of its presence at such sites:&lt;ref name=SeigenthalerABC&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/science/ss/stories/s1613571.htm|title=Mistakes and hoaxes on-line|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation| date=2006-04-15| accessdate=2007-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
Then [Seigenthaler's] son discovered that his father's hoax biography also appeared on two other sites, Reference.com and Answers.com, which took direct feeds from Wikipedia. It was out there for four months before Seigenthaler realized and got the Wikipedia entry replaced with a more reliable account. The lies remained for another three weeks on the mirror sites downstream.

Seth Finkelstein reported in an article in ''[[The Guardian]]'' on his efforts to remove his own biography page from Wikipedia, simply because it was subjected to [[defamation]]:&lt;ref&gt;Seth Finkelstein (Sep. 28, 2006) [http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2006/sep/28/wikipedia.web20 &quot;I'm on Wikipedia, get me out of here&quot;] The Guardian. Inside IT.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Wikipedia has a short biography of me, originally added in February 2004, mostly concerned with my internet civil liberties achievements. After discovering in May 2006 that it had been vandalised in March, possibly by a long-time opponent, and that the attack had been subsequently propagated to many other sites which (legally) repackage Wikipedia's content, the article's existence seemed to me overall to be harmful rather than helpful.

For people who are not very prominent, Wikipedia biographies can be an &quot;attractive nuisance&quot;. It says, to every troll, vandal, and score-settler: &quot;Here's an article about a person where you can, with no accountability whatsoever, write any libel, defamation, or smear. It won't be a marginal comment with the social status of an inconsequential rant, but rather will be made prominent about the person, and reputation-laundered with the institutional status of an encyclopedia.&quot;}}

In the same article Finkelstein recounts how he voted his own biography as &quot;not [[Notability in Wikipedia|notable]] enough&quot; in order to have it removed from Wikipedia. He goes on to recount a similar story involving [[Angela Beesley]], previously a prominent member of the foundation which runs Wikipedia.

In November 2005, the biography of [[Jens Stoltenberg]], the Norwegian Prime Minister, was edited to contain libelous statements including accusations of pedophilia and prison time.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPRfeb2006&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5182883 | title=Wikipedia Under Fire | accessdate=April 9, 2011 | author=Seabrook, Andrea and Chadwick, Alex | date=February 1, 2006 | publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Taner Akcam]], a [[Turkish people|Turkish]] history professor at the [[University of Minnesota]], was detained at the Montreal airport, as his article was vandalized by Turkish nationalists in 2007. While this mistake was resolved, he was again arrested in USA for the same suspicion two days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2042333_2042334_2042574,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Wikipedia Moments | date=2011-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In another example, on March 2, 2007, msnbc.com reported that [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] had been incorrectly listed for 20 months in her Wikipedia biography as [[valedictorian]] of her class of 1969 at [[Wellesley College]]. (Hillary Rodham was not the valedictorian, though she did speak at [[Graduation|commencement]].)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bill|last=Dedman|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17388372/page/3/|title=Reading Hillary Clinton's hidden thesis|publisher=msnbc.com|date=2007-03-03|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article included a link to the Wikipedia edit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillary_Rodham_Clinton&amp;diff=18494301&amp;oldid=18493966|title=Hillary Rodham Clinton|publisher=Wikipedia|date=2005-07-09|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the incorrect information was added on July 9, 2005. After the msnbc.com report, the inaccurate information was removed the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Hillary_Rodham_Clinton&amp;diff=112070224&amp;oldid=111773323|title=Hillary Rodham Clinton|publisher=Wikipedia|date=2007-03-02|accessdate=2007-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the two edits, the wrong information had stayed in the Clinton article while it was edited more than 4,800 times over 20 months.

Attempts to perpetrate [[hoax]]es may not be confined to editing Wikipedia articles. In October 2005 [[Alan Mcilwraith]], a former [[call centre]] worker from [[Scotland]] created a Wikipedia article in which he claimed to be a highly decorated war hero. The article was quickly identified by other users as unreliable (see [[Wikipedia:Wikipedia Signpost/2006-04-17/Persistent hoax|Wikipedia Signpost article 17 April 2006]]). However, Mcilwraith had also succeeded in convincing a number of charities and media organizations that he was who he claimed to be:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/news/tm_objectid=16929538&amp;method=full&amp;siteid=66633&amp;headline=meet-sir-walter-mitty--name_page.html|title=Exclusive: Meet the Real Sir Walter Mitty|author=Cara Paige|publisher=Daily Record|date=2006-04-11|accessdate=2007-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|The 28-year-old, who calls himself Captain Sir Alan McIlwraith, KBE, DSO, MC, has mixed with celebrities for at least one fundraising event. But last night, an Army spokesman said: &quot;I can confirm he is a fraud. He has never been an officer, soldier or Army cadet.&quot;}}

In May 2010, French politician [[SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal]] publicly praised the memory of LÃ©on-Robert de l'Astran, an 18th century [[naturalist]], [[humanism|humanist]] and son of a slave trader, who had opposed the slave trade. The newspaper ''[[Sud-Ouest (newspaper)|Sud-Ouest]]'' revealed a month later that de l'Astran had never existedâexcept as the subject of an article in the [[French Wikipedia]]. Historian Jean-Louis MahÃ© discovered that de l'Astran was fictional after a student, interested by Royal's praise of him, asked MahÃ© about him. MahÃ©'s research led him to realise that de l'Astran did not exist in any archives, and he traced the hoax back to the [[Rotary Club]] of [[La Rochelle]]. The article, created by members of the Club in January 2007, had thus remained online for three yearsâunsourcedâbefore the hoax was uncovered. Upon ''Sud-Ouest''âs revelationârepeated in other major French newspapersâFrench Wikipedia administrator [[:fr:Utilisateur:DonCamillo|DonCamillo]] immediately deleted the article.&lt;ref name=&quot;TimesFrenchWPHoax&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article7146463.ece | title=SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal and Wikipedia duped by tale of anti-slavery activist | work=The Times | date=June 9, 2010 | accessdate=June 17, 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lemonde.fr&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudouest.fr/2010/06/07/leon-robert-de-l-astran-celui-qui-n-a-jamais-existe-110539-3415.php &quot;LÃ©on-Robert de L'Astran, celui qui n'a jamais existÃ©&quot;], ''[[Sud-Ouest (newspaper)|Sud-Ouest]]'', June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lefigaro.fr/politique/2010/06/08/01002-20100608ARTFIG00346-segolene-royal-tombe-dans-le-piege-de-wikipedia.php &quot;SÃ©golÃ¨ne Royal tombe dans le piÃ¨ge de WikipÃ©dia&quot;], ''[[Le Figaro]]'', June 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lejdd.fr/Politique/Actualite/Royal-toute-une-Histoire-198776/ &quot;Royal, toute une Histoire&quot;], ''[[Le Journal du Dimanche]]'', June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Robert_de_L%27Astran &quot;LÃ©on Robert de L'Astran&quot;], article in the French Wikipedia, deleted on June 7, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:OIfWh714i6kJ:fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on_Robert_de_L'Astran+%22L%C3%A9on+Robert+de+L'Astran%22&amp;cd=13&amp;hl=fr&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=fr Cached version of the article &quot;LÃ©on Robert de L'Astran&quot; prior to deletion]&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been instances of users deliberately inserting false information into Wikipedia in order to test the system and demonstrate its alleged unreliability. For example, [[Gene Weingarten]], a journalist, ran such a test in 2007 by anonymously inserting false information into his own biography.

&quot;Death by Wikipedia&quot; is a phenomenon in which a person is erroneously proclaimed dead through vandalism. Articles about the comedian [[Paul Reiser]], British television host [[Vernon Kay]], and the West Virginia Senator [[Robert Byrd]], who died on June 28, 2010, have been vandalized in this way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Metz |first=Cade |url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/01/22/wikipedia_vandalism_crackdown/ |title=TheRegister.co.uk |publisher=TheRegister.co.uk |date=2009-01-22 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Goss |first=Patrick |url=http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/vernon-kay-shocked-at-death-by-wikipedia-464838 |title=Techradar.com |publisher=Techradar.com |date=2008-09-15 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pershing |first=Ben |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitol-briefing/2009/01/kennedy_the_latest_victim_of_w.html?hpid=topnews |title=WashingtonPost.com |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wikipedia considers vandalism as &quot;any addition, removal, or change of content in a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia&quot;. The Wikipedia page &quot;[[Wikipedia:Researching with Wikipedia|Researching with Wikipedia]]&quot; states:

{{quote|Wikipedia's radical openness means that any given article may be, at any given moment, in a bad state: for example, it could be in the middle of a large edit or it could have been recently vandalized. While blatant vandalism is usually easily spotted and rapidly corrected, Wikipedia is certainly more subject to subtle vandalism than a typical reference work.}}

=== Other false information ===
In June 2007, an anonymous Wikipedia contributor became involved in the [[Chris Benoit double murder and suicide]] because of an unverified piece of information he added to the [[Chris Benoit]] [[English Wikipedia]] article. This information regarding Benoit's wife's death was added fourteen hours before police discovered the bodies of Benoit and his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Blane |last=Bachelor |title=Web Time Stamps Indicate Benoit Death Reported About 14 Hours Before Police Found Bodies |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,287194,00.html |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police detectives seized computer equipment from the man held responsible for the postings, but believed he was uninvolved and did not press charges.&lt;ref name=&quot;hindrance&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Schoetz |title=Police: Wiki Confession an 'Unbelievable Hindrance' |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Sports/story?id=3327310&amp;page=1 |publisher=[[ABC News]] |date=2007-06-29 |accessdate=2008-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[IP address]] from which the edit was made was traced to earlier instances of Wikipedia vandalism. The contributor apologized on [[Wikinews]], saying: {{quote|I will never vandalize anything on Wikipedia or post wrongful information.

On 29 August 2008, shortly after the UEFA cup first round draw was completed, an edit was made to [[AC Omonia]]'s article, apparently by users of [[B3ta]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webuser.co.uk/news/news.php?id=268155 Mirror duped by Wikipedia 'fact'] (''Web User'', 19 Sep 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; which added the following erroneous information to the section titled &quot;The fans&quot;.

{{quote|A small but loyal group of fans are lovingly called &quot;The Zany Ones&quot; â they like to wear hats made from discarded shoes and have a song about a little potato.}}

In a 2009 incident, [[University College Dublin]] sociology student Shane Fitzgerald added an incorrect quote to the article on the recently deceased composer [[Maurice Jarre]]. Fitzgerald wanted to demonstrate the potential dangers of news reporters' reliance on the internet for information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/opinion/2009/0507/1224246059241.html |title=Lazy journalism exposed by online hoax |date=May 7, 2009 |author=Shane Fitzgerald |publisher=[[The Irish Times]] |accessdate=2010-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Fitzgerald's edits were removed three times from Wikipedia article for lack of sourcing,&lt;ref name=ABC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/AheadoftheCurve/wirestory?id=7556738&amp;page=1 |title=Irish Student Hoaxes World's Media With Fake Quote |publisher=[[ABC News]] |author=Shawn Pogatchnik |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-08 }} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; they were nevertheless copied into obituary columns in newspapers worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://arstechnica.com/media/news/2009/05/wikipedia-hoax-reveals-limits-of-journalists-research.ars |title=Wikipedia hoax points to limits of journalists' research |publisher=arstechnica.com |accessdate=2010-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fitzgerald believes that if he had not come forward his quote would have remained in history as actual fact.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;

The death of [[Norman Wisdom]] in October 2010 led several major newspapers to repeat the false claim, drawn from Wikipedia, that he was the author of the lyrics of the Second World War song &quot;[[(There'll Be Bluebirds Over) The White Cliffs of Dover]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/mediamonkeyblog/2010/oct/05/norman-wisdom-wikipedia-mirror |title='Wikipedia vandals' strike again in Norman Wisdom obits |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=October 5, 2010 |accessdate=2010-12-03 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] was presented with the Order of the Companions of Oliver Reginald Tambo.

=== Content disputes and conflicts of interest ===
==== Political interests and advocacy ====
While Wikipedia policy requires articles to have a neutral point of view, it is not immune from attempts by outsiders (or insiders) with an agenda to place a [[spin (public relations)|spin]] on articles. In January 2006 it was revealed that several staffers of members of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] had embarked on a campaign to cleanse their respective bosses' biographies on Wikipedia, as well as inserting negative remarks on political opponents. References to a campaign promise by [[Marty Meehan|Martin Meehan]] to surrender his seat in 2000 were deleted, and negative comments were inserted into the articles on U.S. Senator [[Bill Frist]] and [[Eric Cantor]], a congressman from [[Virginia]]. Numerous other changes were made from an [[IP address]] which is assigned to the House of Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Margaret Kane|date=2006-01-30|url=http://news.com.com/2061-11199_3-6032713.html|title=Politicians notice Wikipedia|publisher=[[CNET|Cnet news.com]]|accessdate=2007-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, [[Jimmy Wales]] remarked that the changes were &quot;not cool.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawnorder.blogspot.com/2006/01/senator-staffers-spam-wikipedia.html|title=Senator staffers spam Wikipedia|accessdate=2006-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 31, 2008, ''The New York Times'' ran an article detailing the edits made to the biography of [[Sarah Palin]] in the wake of her nomination as running mate of [[John McCain]].  During the 24 hours before the McCain campaign announcement, [http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Sarah_Palin&amp;diff=234778085&amp;oldid=234741793 30 edits], many of them flattering details, were made to the article by Wikipedia single-purpose user identity Young Trigg.

Larry Delay and Pablo Bachelet write that from their perspective, some articles dealing with Latin American history and groups (such as the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinistas]] and [[Cuba]]) lack political neutrality and are written from a sympathetic Marxist perspective which treats socialist dictatorships favorably at the expense of alternate positions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Pablo Bachelet|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MH&amp;p_theme=mh&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;s_dispstring=cuba%20wikipedia%20AND%20date(all)&amp;p_field_advanced-0=&amp;p_text_advanced-0=(cuba%20wikipedia)&amp;p_sort=_rank_:D&amp;xcal_ranksort=4&amp;xcal_useweights=yes|title=War of Words: Website Can't Define Cuba|date=2006-05-03|work=[[The Miami Herald]]|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Matt Sanchez|url=http://pajamasmedia.com/blog/wiki-whacked-by-political-bias/|title=Wiki-Whacked by Political Bias|date=2008-05-14|publisher=[[Pajamas Media]]|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Larry Delay|url=http://lanic.utexas.edu/project/asce/pdfs/volume16/pdfs/program.pdf|title=A Pernicious Model for Control of the World Wide Web: The Cuba Case|date=2006-08-03|publisher=Association for Study of the Cuban Economy(ASCE)|accessdate=2008-07-08|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007, libelous accusations were made against two politicians from southwestern France, [[Jean-Pierre Grand]] and [[HÃ©lÃ¨ne Mandroux-Colas]], on their Wikipedia biographies. Jean-Pierre Grand asked the president of the [[French National Assembly]] and the [[Prime Minister of France]] to reinforce the legislation on the penal responsibility of Internet sites and of authors who peddle false informations in order to cause harm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vnunet.fr/fr/news/2007/11/28/wikipedia_en_butte_a_une_nouvelle_affaire_de_calomnie Â« WikipÃ©dia en butte Ã  une nouvelle affaire de calomnie Â»], Vnunet.fr, 28 novembre 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Senator [[Jean Louis Masson]] then requested the Minister of Justice to tell him whether it would be possible to increase the criminal responsibilities of hosting providers, site operators, and authors of libelous content; the minister declined to do so, recalling the existing rules in the [[:fr:Loi pour la confiance dans l'Ã©conomie numÃ©rique|LCEN]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senat.fr/questions/base/2007/qSEQ071102679.html Question] from Senator Jean-Louis Masson to the Minister of Justice, and the Minister's response&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Wikipedia banned the [[Church of Scientology]] from editing any articles on its site. The Wikipedia articles concerning Scientology were edited by members of the group to improve its portrayal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mid-day.com/lifestyle/2009/jun/030609-Wikipedia-Controversy-Church-of-Scientology-IT-Adda-Bangalore.htm|title=Handling controversy on Wikipedia|first=Balaji|last=Narasimhan|publisher=[[MiD DAY]]|date=2009-06-03|accessdate=2011-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2010, the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' reported that the Canadian &quot;government is now conducting two investigations into federal employees who have taken to Wikipedia to express their opinion on federal policies and bitter political debates.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/canada/article/852228--ottawa-investigating-wikipedia-edits |title= Ottawa investigating Wikipedia edits|author=Allan Woods |date= August 25, 2010 |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Al Jazeera]]'s Teymoor Nabili suggested that the article ''[[Cyrus Cylinder]]'' had been edited for political purposes by &quot;an apparent tussle of opinions in the shadowy world of hard drives and 'independent' editors that comprise the Wikipedia industry.&quot; He suggested that after the [[Iranian presidential election, 2009]] and the ensuing &quot;anti-Iranian activities&quot; a &quot;strenuous attempt to portray the cylinder as nothing more than the propaganda tool of an aggressive invader&quot; was visible. The edits following his analysis of the edits during 2009 and 2010, represented &quot;a complete dismissal of the suggestion that the cylinder, or Cyrus' actions, represent concern for human rights or any kind of enlightened intent,&quot; in stark contrast to [[Cyrus the Great|Cyrus]]' own reputation as documented in the [[Old Testament]] and the people of Babylon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.aljazeera.net/middle-east/2010/09/11/cyrus-cylinder-wikipedia-and-iran-conspiracies The Cyrus Cylinder, Wikipedia and Iran conspiracies | Al Jazeera Blogs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Arab-Israeli conflict=====

In April 2008, the Boston-based Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America ([[Committee for Accuracy in Middle East Reporting in America|CAMERA]]) organized an e-mail campaign to encourage readers to correct perceived Israel-related biases and inconsistencies in Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;Metz, Cade, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/04/29/wikipedia_blocked_doj_ip/ US Department of Justice banned from Wikipedia], ''The Register'', April 29, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Excerpts of some of the e-mails were published in the July 2008 issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' under the title of &quot;Candid camera&quot;.&lt;ref name=Harpers&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://harpers.org/archive/2008/07/0082086/|title=Candid camera|work=[[Harper's Magazine]]|date=2008-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CAMERA argued the excerpts were unrepresentative and that it had explicitly campaigned merely &quot;toward encouraging people to learn about and edit the online encyclopedia for accuracy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.camera.org/index.asp?x_context=2&amp;x_outlet=32&amp;x_article=1525 |title=Letter in Harper's Magazine About Wikipedia Issues |publisher=Camera |date=2008-08-14 |accessdate=2010-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some defenders of CAMERA, serious misrepresentations of CAMERA's role emanated from the competing Electronic Intifada group; moreover, it is said, some other Palestinian advocacy groups have been guilty of systematic misrepresentations and manipulative behaviors but have not suffered bans of editors amongst their staff or volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;Andre Oboler, &quot;Exposed â Anti-Israel Subversion on Wikipedia,&quot; May 14, 2008, Media Critiques at http://www.honestreporting.com/articles/45884734/critiques/new/Exposed_-_Anti-Israeli_Subversion_on_Wikipedia.asp; also see Andre Oboler, &quot;Wiki Warfare: Battle for the on-line encyclopedia,&quot; May 13, 2008, ''Jerusalem Post'' at http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-EdContributors/Article.aspx?id=101037&lt;/ref&gt;

Five editors involved in the campaign were sanctioned by Wikipedia administrators.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1934857/Israeli-battles-rage-on-Wikipedia.html|title=Israeli battles rage on Wikipedia|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|publisher=Telegraph Media Group Limited|accessdate=2008-05-08|date=2008-05-08|last=McElroy|first=Damien | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli diplomat David Saranga said that Wikipedia is generally fair in regard to Israel. When confronted with the fact that the entry on Israel mentioned the word &quot;occupation&quot; nine times, whereas the entry on the Palestinian People mentioned &quot;terror&quot; only once, he replied &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It means only one thing: Israelis should be more active on Wikipedia. Instead of blaming it, they should go on the site much more, and try and change it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/culture/arts-leisure/your-wiki-entry-counts-1.235851 Your wiki entry counts], Haaretz, By Cnaan Liphshiz 25.12.07&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Political commentator Haviv Rettig Gur, reviewing widespread perceptions in Israel of systemic bias in Wikipedia articles, has argued that there are deeper structural problems creating this bias: anonymous editing favors biased results, especially if those Gur calls &quot;pro-Palestinian activists&quot; organize concerted campaigns as has been done in articles dealing with Arab-Israeli issues, and current Wikipedia policies, while well-meant, have proven ineffective in handling this.&lt;ref&gt;Haviv Rettig Gur, &quot;Israeli-Palestinian conflict rages on Wikipedia,&quot; ''Jerusalem Post'', 16.05.10, at http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Article.aspx?id=175660.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2010, it was reported that the Yesha Council together with [[Israel Sheli]] (My Israel), a network of online pro-Israel activists committed to spreading Zionism online, were organizing people at a workshop in [[Jerusalem]] to teach them how to edit [[Wikipedia]] articles in a pro-Israeli way.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{Cite news|title=Wikipedia editing courses launched by Zionist groups|author=Rachel Shabi, Jemima Kiss|newspaper=Guardian|date=18 August 2010|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2010/aug/18/wikipedia-editing-zionist-groups|accessdate=|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Benari | first=Elad | title=Zionist Internet Struggle to Hit Wikipedia | url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138917 | publisher=Israel National News | date=3 August 2010 | accessdate=18 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=The right's latest weapon: 'Zionist editing' on Wikipedia |first=Nir |last=Hasson|newspaper=Haaretz|date=18 August 2010|url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/the-right-s-latest-weapon-zionist-editing-on-wikipedia-1.308667 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 50 people took part in the course.&lt;ref name=Haaretz&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/the-right-s-latest-weapon-zionist-editing-on-wikipedia-1.308667 The right's latest weapon: 'Zionist editing' on Wikipedia ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The project organiser, Ayelet Shaked was interviewed on [[Arutz Sheva|Arutz Sheva Radio]]. She emphasized that the information has to be reliable and meet Wikipedia rules. She cited some examples such as the use of the term âoccupationâ in Wikipedia entries, as well as in the editing of entries that link Israel with [[Judea and Samaria]] and [[Jewish history]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sheva&quot;&gt;[http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/138917 Zionist Internet Struggle to Hit Wikipedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;We don't want to change Wikipedia or turn it into a propaganda arm,&quot; commented [[Naftali Bennett]], director of the Yesha Council. &quot;We just want to show the other side. People think that Israelis are mean, evil people who only want to hurt Arabs all day.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ynet&quot;&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3944937,00.html The battle for Wikipedia: Palestinians counter Israeli editing group]&lt;/ref&gt;  &quot;The idea is not to make Wikipedia rightist but for it to include our point of view,&quot; he said in another interview.&lt;ref name=Haaretz/&gt;

A course participant explained that the course is not a âZionist conspiracy to take over Wikipedia&quot;; rather, it is an attempt to balance information about disputed issues presented in the online encyclopedia. &lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he goal of this workshop was to train a number of pro-Israelis how to edit Wikipedia so that more people could present the Israeli side of things, and thus the content would be more balanced... Wikipedia is meant to be a fair and balanced source, and it is that way by having people from all across the spectrum contributing to the content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/08/23/readers-discuss-wikipedia-editing-course-that-aims-for-balanced-and-zionist-entries/ Readers Discuss Wikipedia Editing Course That Aims for âBalanced and Zionistâ Entries] By ROBERT MACKEY August 23, 2010, 1:12 PM&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Following the course announcement, Abdul Nasser An-Najar, the head of [[Palestinian Journalists Syndicate]] said there were plans to set up a counter group to ensure the Palestinian view is presented online as the &quot;next regional war will be [a] media war.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ynet&quot;/&gt;

In 2011, Wikipedia founder [[Jimmy Wales]] stated in retrospect about the course organized by Israel Sheli, âwe saw absolutely no impact from that effort whatsoever. I don't think it ever â it was in the press but we never saw any impact.â&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/news/national/wikipedia-founder-israel-palestine-is-heavily-debated-but-we-re-vigilant-on-neutrality-1.377207 Wikipedia founder: Israel-Palestine is heavily debated, but we're vigilant on neutrality], Haaretz&lt;/ref&gt;

CBS also quoted [[Jimmy Wales]] as having expressed his disapproval of Microsoft's involvement: &quot;We were very disappointed to hear that Microsoft was taking that approach.&quot;

In a story covered by the [[BBC]],  Jeffrey Merkey claimed that in exchange for a donation his Wikipedia entry was edited in his favor. Jay Walsh, a spokesman for Wikipedia, flatly denied the allegations in an interview given to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]''.&lt;ref&gt;March 12, 2008 [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7291382.stm Wiki boss 'edited for donation'] Technology.

===== Conflicts involving Wikipedia policy makers =====

In February 2008, British technology  news and opinion website ''[[The Register]]'' stated that a prominent administrator of Wikipedia had edited a topic area where he had a conflict of interest to keep criticism to a bare minimum, as well as altering the Wikipedia policies regarding ''personal biography'' and ''conflict of interest'' to favour his editing.

Some of the most scathing criticism of Wikipedia's claimed neutrality came in ''The Register'', which in turn was allegedly criticized by founding members of the project. According to ''The Register'':&lt;ref&gt;Cade Metz (March 6, 2008). &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/03/06/a_model_wikipedian/page2.html Why you should care that Jimmy Wales ignores reality]&quot;. The Register. Retrieved on 2010-04-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In short, Wikipedia is a cult. Or at least, the inner circle is a cult. We aren't the first to make this observation.

On the inside, they reinforce each other's beliefs. And if anyone on the outside questions those beliefs, they circle the wagons. They deny the facts. They attack the attacker. After our Jossi Fresco story, Fresco didn't refute our reporting. He simply accused us of &quot;yellow journalism&quot;. After our Overstock.com article, Wales called us &quot;trash&quot;.

Charles Arthur in ''The Guardian'' said that &quot;Wikipedia, and so many other online activities, show all the outward characteristics of a [[cult]].&quot;&lt;ref name=cult&gt;{{cite news

==== Commandeering or sanitizing articles ====
Articles of particular interest to an editor or group of editors are sometimes commandeered&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, Ron (2009-08-04) http://www.dnjournal.com/archive/lowdown/2009/dailyposts/20090804.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and sanitized&lt;ref&gt;Umbria Blogosphere Analysis â Wikipedia and Corporate Blogging (2007-08-24) http://www.jdpowerwebintelligence.com/downloads/CNN_Wikipedia.pdf &quot;Organizations like Sony, Diebold,  Nintendo, Dell, the CIA and the Church of Scientology were all shown to have sanitized pages about themselves.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Marc (2008-02-01) http://www.beggarscanbechoosers.com/2008/02/wikipedia-continues-to-sanitize-bush.html&lt;/ref&gt; to continually reflect a point of view that sheds a favorable light on the subject or group. Editors essentially &quot;squat&quot; on pages, watching for negative entries, then immediately [[Help:Reverting|revert]] them. This is especially true of pages on politicians as shown on [[USA Congressional staff edits to Wikipedia]]. The page on [[Scientology]] has also been subject to vandalism and protected under [[Wikipedia:Protection policy|Wikipedia's Protection Policy]].

==== Scientific disputes ====
The 2005 ''Nature'' study also gave two brief examples of challenges that Wikipedian science writers purportedly faced on Wikipedia. The first concerned the addition of a section on violence to the [[Schizophrenia#Violence|schizophrenia]] article, which exhibited the view of one of the article's regular editors, [[neuropsychologist]] [[Vaughan Bell]], that it was little more than a &quot;rant&quot; about the need to lock people up, and that editing it stimulated him to look up the literature on the topic.&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesJ2005Internet&quot;/&gt;

The second dispute reported by ''Nature'' involved the climatologist [[William Connolley]] related to protracted disputes between editors of climate change topics, in which Connolley was placed on parole and several opponents banned from editing climate related articles for six months;&lt;ref name=&quot;GilesJ2005Internet&quot;/&gt; a separate paper commented that this was more about etiquette than bias and that Connolley did &quot;not suffer[] fools gladly&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;crowdsourcing&quot;&gt;Mathieu O'Neil: &quot;[http://jcom.sissa.it/archive/09/01/Jcom0901(2010)C01/Jcom0901(2010)C04 Shirky and Sanger, or the costs of crowdsourcing]&quot;. ''Journal of Science Communication'', Volume 09, Issue 01, March 2010, [[International School for Advanced Studies]]&lt;/ref&gt;
