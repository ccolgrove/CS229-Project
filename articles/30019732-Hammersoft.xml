The curriculum is harmonized with the curriculum of Agricultural Faculty of Sarajevo, and some changes have been introduced lately. Thanks to the large number of elective courses, students can shape their professional profile by their own choice. Since 2002, a fruit-wine growing department has existed, in addition to the already existing Department of vegetable-flower growing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.af.unmo.ba/ofakultetu.aspx UNMO;AF 2 &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
