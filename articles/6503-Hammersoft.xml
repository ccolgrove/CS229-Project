The city of '''Concord''' {{IPAc-en|Ë|k|É|n|.|k|Ér|d}} is the [[capital city|capital]] of the state of [[New Hampshire]] in the United States. It is also the [[county seat]] of [[Merrimack County, New Hampshire|Merrimack County]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], its population was 42,695.&lt;ref&gt;United States Census Bureau, [http://factfinder2.census.gov/main.html American FactFinder], 2010 Census figures. Retrieved March 23, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concord includes the villages of [[Penacook, New Hampshire|Penacook]], East Concord and West Concord. The city is home to the [[University of New Hampshire School of Law]], New Hampshire's only [[law school]]; [[St. Paul's School (Concord, New Hampshire)|St. Paul's School]], a private [[University-preparatory school|preparatory school]]; [[New Hampshire Technical Institute]], a two-year [[community college]]; and the Granite State Symphony Orchestra.

==History==
[[File:Downtownconcordnh.jpg|thumb|left|Downtown in 2005]]
The area that would become Concord was originally settled thousands of years ago by [[Abenaki]] Native Americans called the [[Pennacook]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lyford|first=James|coauthors=Amos Hadley, Howard F. Hill, Benjamin A. Kimball, Lyman D. Stevens, and John M. Mitchell|title=History of Concord, N.H.|publisher=The Rumford Press|year=1903|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=65|url=http://www.onconcord.com/books/lyford/lyford_vol1/LyfordV1chapt1.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tribe fished for [[Fish migration|migrating]] [[salmon]], [[sturgeon]] and [[alewife|alewives]] with nets strung across the rapids of the [[Merrimack River]]. The stream was also the transportation route for their [[birch bark]] canoes, which could travel from [[Lake Winnipesaukee]] to the Atlantic Ocean. The broad sweep of the Merrimack River valley [[floodplain]] provided good soil for farming [[bean]]s, [[gourd]]s, [[pumpkin]]s, [[melon]]s and [[maize]].

On January 17, 1725, the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], which then held jurisdiction over New Hampshire, granted it as the Plantation of Penacook.&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; It was settled between 1725 and 1727 by Captain Ebenezer Eastman and others from [[Haverhill, Massachusetts]]. On February 9, 1734, the town was incorporated as Rumford,&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; from which [[Benjamin Thompson|Sir Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford]] would take his title. It was renamed Concord in 1765 by Governor [[Benning Wentworth]] following a bitter boundary dispute between Rumford and the town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]]; the city name was meant to reflect the new concord, or harmony, between the disputant towns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Jacob|title=Annals of the Town of Concord|publisher=Jacob B. Moore|year=1824|location=Concord, N.H.|pages=31â34}}&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens displaced by the resulting border adjustment were given land elsewhere as compensation. In 1779, New Pennacook Plantation was granted to Timothy Walker, Jr. and his associates at what would be incorporated in 1800 as [[Rumford, Maine]], the site of Pennacook Falls.

Concord grew in prominence throughout the 18th century, and some of its earliest houses survive at the northern end of Main Street. In the years following the [[American Revolution|Revolution]], Concord's central geographical location made it a logical choice for the state capital, particularly after Samuel Blodget in 1807 opened a [[canal]] and [[lock (water transport)|lock]] system to allow vessels passage around the [[Amoskeag Falls]] downriver, connecting Concord with [[Boston]] by way of the [[Middlesex Canal]]. In 1808, Concord was named the official seat of state government,&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 324â326&lt;/ref&gt; its 1819 [[New Hampshire State House|State House]] the oldest capitol in which legislative branches meet in their original chambers. The city would become noted for [[furniture]]-making and [[granite]] [[quarry]]ing. In 1828, Lewis Downing joined J. Stephens Abbot to form Abbot-Downing Coaches.&lt;ref&gt;Lyford et al., p. 339â340&lt;/ref&gt; Their most famous [[Stagecoaches#Concord stagecoaches|coach]] was the Concord Coach, modeled after the [[coronation]] coach of [[George II of England|King George III]]. In the 19th century, Concord became a hub for the [[railroad]] industry, with Penacook a [[textile]] manufacturing center using [[hydropower|water power]] from the [[Contoocook River]]. Today, the city is a center for health care and several [[insurance company|insurance companies]]. It is also home to Concord Litho, one of the largest independently owned commercial [[printing]] companies in the country.

==Geography and climate==
[[File:Concord 102WP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Aerial view of downtown Concord (looking east)]]
Concord is located at {{coord|43|12|24|N|71|32|17|W|type:city}} (43.2070, â71.5371).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=2&amp;s=12&amp;lon=-71.538056&amp;lat=43.206667&amp;w=600&amp;h=400 | title = Topo Map: Concord, New Hampshire, United States 01 July 1985 | work = [[The National Map]] | publisher = [[U.S. Geological Survey]] | accessdate=2008-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|67.5|sqmi}}. {{convert|64.3|sqmi|abbr=on}} of it is land and {{convert|3.2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of it is water, comprising 4.78% of the city. Concord is drained by the [[Merrimack River]]. [[Penacook Lake]] is in the west. The highest point in Concord is {{convert|860|ft}} above sea level on Oak Hill, just west of the hill's {{convert|970|ft|adj=on}} summit in neighboring [[Loudon, New Hampshire|Loudon]].

Concord lies fully within the Merrimack River [[Drainage basin|watershed]],&lt;ref name=watershed&gt;{{cite book |title=Water Use in New Hampshire: An Activities Guide for Teachers |url=http://nh.water.usgs.gov/Publications/nh.intro.html |last=Foster |first=Debra H. |coauthors=Batorfalvy, Tatianna N.; and Medalie, Laura |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior and U.S. Geological Survey |year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is centered on the river, which runs from northwest to southeast through the city. Downtown is located on a low terrace to the west of the river, with residential neighborhoods climbing hills to the west and extending southwards towards the town of Bow. To the east of the Merrimack, atop a {{convert|100|ft|adj=on}} bluff, is a flat, sandy plain known as Concord Heights, which has seen most of the city's commercial development since 1960. The eastern boundary of Concord (with the town of [[Pembroke, New Hampshire|Pembroke]]) is formed by the [[Soucook River]], a tributary of the Merrimack. The [[Turkey River (New Hampshire)|Turkey River]] winds through the southwestern quarter of the city, passing through the campus of St. Paul's School before entering the Merrimack River in Bow. In the northern part of the city, the [[Contoocook River]] enters the Merrimack at the village of Penacook. Other village centers in the city include West Concord (actually north of downtown, on the west side of the Merrimack) and East Concord (also north of downtown, but on the east side of the Merrimack).

The city's neighboring communities are [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]] to the south, Pembroke to the southeast, Loudon to the northeast, [[Canterbury, New Hampshire|Canterbury]], [[Boscawen, New Hampshire|Boscawen]], and [[Webster, New Hampshire|Webster]] to the north, and [[Hopkinton, New Hampshire|Hopkinton]] to the west.

[[Interstate 89]] and [[Interstate 93]] are the two main Interstate highways serving Concord, and join just south of the city limits. Interstate 89 links Concord with [[Lebanon, New Hampshire|Lebanon]] and the state of [[Vermont]] to the northwest, while Interstate 93 connects the city to [[Plymouth, New Hampshire|Plymouth]], [[Littleton, New Hampshire|Littleton]], and the White Mountains to the north and [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]] to the south. [[Interstate 393]] is a spur highway leading east from Concord and merging with [[U.S. Route 4]] as a direct route to New Hampshire's [[Seacoast Region (New Hampshire)|seacoast]]. North-south [[U.S. Route 3]] serves as Concord's Main Street, while [[U.S. Route 202]] and [[New Hampshire Route 9]] cross the city from east to west.

Concord, as with much of New England, is within the [[humid continental climate]] zone ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|KÃ¶ppen]] ''Dfb''), with long, cold, snowy winters, very warm (and at times humid) summers, and relatively brief autumns and springs. In winter, successive storms deliver light to moderate snowfall amounts, contributing to the relatively reliable snow cover. The dampness is compounded by frequent (occurring 20 times per year) plunges to {{convert|0|Â°F|0}} at night, though thaws are frequent, with a few days per winter above {{convert|50|Â°F}}.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Summer can bring stretches of humid conditions as well as thunderstorms, but rarely extended periods of {{convert|90|Â°F|0}} or above, with 11 days breaching that mark.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt; Freezes begin early (late Sept) and cease late (late May) in the season, and even summer nights are crisp.&lt;ref name = NCDC /&gt;

Monthly daily means range from {{convert|20.1|Â°F|1}} in January to {{convert|70.0|Â°F|1}} in July. Temperature extremes have ranged from {{convert|â37|Â°F|0}} in February 1943 to {{convert|102|Â°F|0}} in July 1966.

===Air quality===
According to [http://scorecard.org Scorecard.org], Merrimack County ranked in 2002 among the top 10% dirtiest in terms of air pollution, with a total release of {{convert|2830473|lb}} of toxins, compared to {{convert|543|lb}} in neighboring [[Belknap County, New Hampshire|Belknap County]]. The top chemical pollutant release was [[hydrochloric acid]] at {{convert|2300000|lb}}, followed by [[sulfuric acid]] with {{convert|340000|lb}} released.  The majority of toxins, {{convert|2746211|lb}}, were released in the neighboring town of [[Bow, New Hampshire|Bow]] at the Merrimack Station power plant.

The [http://des.nh.gov/ New Hampshire Department of Environmental Services] has put an air quality forecast page on their website. In comparing scorecard.org and the [http://www2.des.state.nh.us/airdata/air_quality_forecast.asp NHDES pollutant forecast], there has been an improvement in air quality from 2002 to 2011.
