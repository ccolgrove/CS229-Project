With an estimated population of over 112 million,&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI 2010 Census Statistics&quot;/&gt; it is the [[List of countries by population|eleventh most populous country]] and the [[Hispanophone#Hispanosphere|most populous Spanish-speaking]] country. Mexico is a federation comprising [[Administrative divisions of Mexico|thirty-one states]] and a [[Mexico City|Federal District]], the capital city.

In [[Pre-Columbian Mesoamerica]] many cultures matured into advanced civilizations such as the [[Olmec]], the [[Toltec]], the [[Teotihuacan]], the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]], the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and the [[Aztec]] before the first contact with Europeans. In 1521, Spain [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire|conquered]] and colonized the territory from its base in [[Tenochtitlan|MÃ©xico-Tenochtitlan]], which was administered as the Viceroyalty of [[New Spain]]. This territory would eventually become Mexico as the colony's [[Mexican War of Independence|independence]] was recognized in 1821. The post-independence period was characterized by [[Economic history of Mexico#Independence|economic instability]], the [[Mexican-American War]] and [[Territorial evolution of Mexico|territorial cession]] to the [[United States]], a [[Reform War|civil war]], [[Emperor of Mexico|two empires]] and [[List of Presidents of Mexico|a domestic dictatorship]]. The latter led to the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910, which culminated with the promulgation of the [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]] and the emergence of the country's current [[Politics of Mexico|political system]]. [[Mexican general election, 2000|Elections held in July 2000]] marked the first time that an opposition party won the presidency from the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]].

Mexico has one of the world's largest economies, and is considered both a [[regional power]] and [[middle power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japan's Regional Diplomacy, Latin America and the Caribbean|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/other/bluebook/2006/05.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Latin America:Region is losing ground to competitors|publisher=Oxford Analytica|url=http://www.oxanstore.com/displayfree.php?NewsItemID=130098|accessdate=2007-10-01 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070808004523/http://www.oxanstore.com/displayfree.php?NewsItemID=130098 |archivedate = August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Mexico was the first Latin American member of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] OECD (since 1994), and a firmly established upper-middle income country.&lt;ref name=&quot;wb-upper-middle&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.worldbank.org/about/country-classifications/country-and-lending-groups#Upper_middle_income |title=Country and Lending Groups  |author= |date= |work= |publisher=World Bank |accessdate=5 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is considered a [[newly industrialized country]]&lt;ref name=Globalization&gt;{{Cite book|title=Globalization and the Transformation of Foreign Economic Policy|author=PaweÅ BoÅ¼yk|chapter=Newly Industrialized Countries|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd|year=2006|isbn=0-75-464638-6|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Limits&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Limits of Convergence|author=Mauro F.

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Name of Mexico}}
[[File:CodexMendoza01.jpg|thumb|Image of Mexico-[[Tenochtitlan]] from the [[Codex Mendoza]]]]
After New Spain won independence from Spain, it was decided that the new country would be named after its capital, [[Mexico City]], which was founded in 1524 on top of the ancient Aztec capital of [[Tenochtitlan|MÃ©xico-Tenochtitlan]]. The name comes from the [[Nahuatl]] language, but its meaning is not well known.

''[[Name of Mexico|MÄxihco]]'' was the [[Nahuatl]] term for the heartland of the [[Aztec Empire]], namely, the [[Valley of Mexico]], and its people, the [[Mexica]], and surrounding territories which became the future [[State of Mexico]] as a division of [[New Spain]] prior to independence (compare ''[[Latium]]''). It is generally considered to be a [[toponym]] for the valley which became the primary [[ethnonym]] for the [[Aztec Triple Alliance]] as a result, or vice versa.

The suffix ''-co'' is  the [[Nahuatl language|Nahuatl]] [[locative]], making the word a place name. Beyond that, the etymology is uncertain. It has been suggested that it is derived from [[Mextli]] or MÄxihtli, a secret name for the god of war and patron of the Aztecs, [[Huitzilopochtli]], in which case MÄxihco means &quot;Place where Huitzilopochtli lives&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Aguilar-Moreno|first=Manuel|title=Handbook to Life in the Aztec World|year=2006|publisher=Facts of Life, Inc.|isbn=0-8160-5673-0|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another hypothesis&lt;ref name=edomex/&gt; suggests that ''MÄxihco'' derives from a [[portmanteau]] of the Nahuatl words for &quot;moon&quot; (''mÄtztli'') and navel (''xÄ«ctli''). This meaning (&quot;Place at the Center of the Moon&quot;) might then refer to [[Tenochtitlan]]'s position in the middle of [[Lake Texcoco]]. The system of interconnected lakes, of which Texcoco formed the center, had the form of a rabbit, which the Mesoamericans [[pareidolia|pareidolically]] associated with the [[moon rabbit|moon]]. Still another hypothesis suggests that it is derived from MÄctli, the goddess of [[Agave americana|maguey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;edomex&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Nombre del Estado de MÃ©xico|publisher=Government of the State of Mexico|url=http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm|accessdate=2007-10-03 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070427111842/http://www.edomexico.gob.mx/identidad/civica/htm/NomMexico.htm |archivedate = April 27, 2007}} {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the city-state was transliterated to Spanish as MÃ©xico with the phonetic value of the letter &lt;x&gt; in Medieval Spanish, which represented the [[voiceless postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[Ê]}}. This sound, as well as the [[voiced postalveolar fricative]] {{IPA|[Ê]}}, represented by a &lt;j&gt;, evolved into a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} during the sixteenth century. This led to the use of the variant MÃ©jico in many publications in Spanish, most notably in Spain, whereas in Mexico and most other Spanishâspeaking countries MÃ©xico was the preferred spelling. In recent years the [[Real Academia EspaÃ±ola]], which regulates the [[Spanish language]], determined that both variants are acceptable in Spanish but that the normative recommended [[spelling]] is MÃ©xico.&lt;ref&gt;http://buscon.rae.es/dpdI/SrvltConsulta?lema=mÃ©xico&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of publications in all Spanish-speaking countries now adhere to the new norm, even though the alternative variant is still occasionally used.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011|reason=Source cited formerly does not support the assertion}} In English, the &lt;x&gt; in Mexico represents neither the original nor the current sound, but the consonant cluster {{IPA|[ks]}}.

The official name of the country has changed as the [[form of government]] has changed. On two occasions (1821â1823 and 1863â1867), the country was known as Imperio Mexicano ([[Mexican Empire]]). All three federal constitutions (1824, 1857 and 1917, the current constitution) used the name Estados Unidos Mexicanos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ierd.prd.org.mx/coy128/hlb.htm |title=El cambio de la denominaciÃ³n de &quot;Estados Unidos Mexicanos&quot; por la de &quot;MÃ©xico&quot; en la ConstituciÃ³n Federal |publisher=Ierd.prd.org.mx |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;âor the variants Estados Unidos mexicanos&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/constitutions/text/image/A02.html |title=Constitucion Federal de los Estados Unidos Mexicanos (1824) |publisher=Tarlton.law.utexas.edu |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Estados-Unidos Mexicanos,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tlahui.com/politic/politi99/politi8/con1857.htm |title=ConstituciÃ³n Mexicana de 1857 |publisher=Tlahui.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; all of which have been translated as &quot;United Mexican States&quot;.

===Ancient cultures===

====Archaic period====
The earliest human remains in Mexico are chips of [[stone tool]]s found near campfire remains in the Valley of Mexico and radiocarbon-dated to ca. 21,000 [[Common Era|BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Native Americans: Earliest Migrations|year=2009|publisher=MSN Encarta|url=http://uk.encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761570777/Native_Americans.html#s76|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/query?id=1257037540134054|archivedate=2009-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico is the site of the domestication of [[maize]] and [[phaseolus|beans]] which caused a transition from [[Paleo-Indians|paleo-indian]] hunter-gatherers to sedentary agricultural villages beginning around 7000 BCE. 

====Classic periods====
In the subsequent formative areas maize cultivation and cultural traits such as a complex  mythological and religious complex, a vigesimal numeric system, were diffused from the Mexican cultures to the rest of the [[Mesoamerica]]n culture area.&lt;ref&gt;Kirchhoff, Paul (1943). &quot;MesoamÃ©rica. Sus LÃ­mites GeogrÃ¡ficos, ComposiciÃ³n Ãtnica y Caracteres Culturales&quot;. Acta Americana 1 (1): 92â107.&lt;/ref&gt; In this period villages began to become socially stratified and develop into [[chiefdom]]s, and the development of large ceremonial centers.&lt;ref&gt;Carmack, Robert; et al. (1996). The legacy of Mesoamerica: history and culture of a Native American civilization. New Jersey: Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Among the earliest complex civilizations in Mexico was the [[Olmec]] culture which flourish on the gulf coast from around 1500 BCE. Olmec cultural traits diffused through Mexico into other formative era cultures in Chiapas, Oaxaca and the Valley of Mexico. The formative period saw the spread of distinct religious and symbolic traditions, as well as artistic and architectural complexes.&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Richard A. (2004). The Olmecs : America's First Civilization. London: Thames and Hudson. pp. 9â25.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the subsequent [[Mesoamerican chronology|pre-classical period]], complex centers began to develop among the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] with centers at [[Calakmul]] and the [[Zapotec civilization|Zapotec]] at [[Monte AlbÃ¡n]]. During this period the first true [[Mesoamerican writing systems]] were developed in the [[Epi-Olmec culture|Epi-Olmec]] and the Zapotec cultures, and the Mesoamerican writing tradition reached its height in the Classic [[Maya Script|Maya Hieroglyphic script]].&lt;ref&gt;Sampson, Geoffrey; ''Writing Systems: A Linguistic Introduction'', Hutchinson (London), 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Central Mexico, the height of the classic period saw the ascendancy of [[Teotihuacan]] which formed a military and commercial empire whose political influence stretched south into the Maya area and north. At its peak, [[Teotihuacan]], containing some of the largest [[Mesoamerican pyramid|pyramidal structures]] built in the pre-Columbian Americas, had a population of more than 150,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author={{aut|Cowgill, George}} |authorlink=George Cowgill |year=1997 |date= |title=State and Society at Teotihuacan, Mexico |journal=[[Annual Review of Anthropology]] |url= |format=[[PDF]] online reproduction |volume=26 |issue=1 |pages=pp.129â161|location=Palo Alto, CA |publisher=[[Annual Reviews|Annual Reviews Inc]] |doi=10.1146/annurev.anthro.26.1.129 |issn=0084-6570 |oclc=202300854}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the collapse of TeotihuacÃ¡n around 600 CE, competition between several important political centers in central Mexico such as [[Xochicalco]] and [[Cholula]] ensued. At this time during the Epi-Classic [[Nahua people]]s began moving south into Mesoamerica from the North, and became politically and culturally dominant in central Mexico, as they displaced speakers of [[Oto-Manguean languages]].

====Post-classic period====
During the early post-classic Central Mexico was dominated by the [[Toltec]] culture, Oaxaca by the [[Mixtec civilization|Mixtec]] and the lowland Maya area had important centers at [[ChichÃ©n ItzÃ¡]] and [[MayapÃ¡n]]. Towards the end of the post-Classic period the [[Aztec]]s of Central Mexico built a tributary empire covering most of central Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author={{aut|Coe, Michael D.}} |authorlink=Michael D.

===Conquest===
The [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] began in February 1519 when [[HernÃ¡n CortÃ©s]] arrived on the coast of Veracruz with ca. 500 [[conquistador]]. Following a strategy of allying with Indigenous city states that were subject to the Aztec empire an supporting them in a rebellion against the Aztecs, CortÃ©s and his men were able to defeat the Aztecs after two years of campaigning on August 13, 1521.

===Independence===

On September 16, 1810, independence from Spain was declared by priest [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], in the small town of [[Dolores Hidalgo|Dolores]], Guanajuato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miguel Hidalgo Biography|publisher=Catholic Encyclopedia|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/16045a.htm|accessdate=2007-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first insurgent group was formed by Hidalgo, the Spanish [[viceregal]] army [[captain (land)|captain]] [[Ignacio Allende]], the [[militia]] captain [[Juan Aldama]] and &quot;La Corregidora&quot; [[Josefa Ortiz de DomÃ­nguez]]. Hidalgo and some of his soldiers were captured and [[executed by firing squad]] in [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua]], on July 31, 1811. Following his death, the leadership was assumed by priest [[JosÃ© MarÃ­a Morelos]], who occupied key southern cities.

In 1813 the [[Congress of Chilpancingo]] was convened and, on November 6, signed the &quot;[[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America]]&quot;. Morelos was captured and executed on December 22, 1815. In subsequent years, the insurgency was near collapse, but in 1820 [[Viceroy]] [[Juan Ruiz de Apodaca]] sent an army under the [[Criollo people|criollo]] general [[AgustÃ­n de Iturbide]] against the troops of [[Vicente Guerrero]]. Instead, Iturbide approached Guerrero to join forces, and in 1821 representatives of the [[Spanish Crown]] and Iturbide signed the &quot;[[Treaty of CÃ³rdoba]]&quot; and the &quot;[[Declaration of Independence of the Mexican Empire]]&quot;, which recognized the [[independence of Mexico]] under the terms of the &quot;[[Plan of Iguala]]&quot;.

====JuÃ¡rez reforms and territorial losses====

[[File:Porfirio Diaz in uniform.jpg|right|thumb|Porfirio DÃ­az, president of Mexico with one interruption from 1876-1911]]
AgustÃ­n de Iturbide immediately proclaimed himself emperor of the [[First Mexican Empire]]. A revolt against him in 1823 established the United Mexican States. In 1824, a [[Constitution of 1824|Republican Constitution]] was drafted and [[Guadalupe Victoria]] became the first president of the newly born country. The first decades of the post-independence period were marked by [[Economic history of Mexico|economic instability]], which led to the [[Pastry War]] in 1836, and a constant strife between liberales, supporters of a [[federal republic|federal form of government]], and conservadores, proposals of a [[Unitary state|hierarchical form of government]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

General [[Antonio LÃ³pez de Santa Anna]], a centralist and two-time [[dictator]], approved the [[Siete Leyes]] in 1836, a radical amendment that institutionalized the centralized form of government. When he suspended the 1824 Constitution, [[civil war]] spread across the country, and three new governments declared independence: the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[Republic of the Rio Grande]] and the [[Republic of YucatÃ¡n]].

Texas successfully achieved independence and was annexed by the United States. A [[territorial dispute|border dispute]] led to the [[Mexican-American War]], which began in 1846 and lasted for two years; the War was settled via the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]], which forced Mexico to give up over half of its land to the U.S., including [[Alta California]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico|New Mexico]], and the disputed parts of [[Coahuila y Tejas|Texas]]. A much smaller transfer of territory in what is today southern [[Arizona]] and southwestern [[New Mexico]]&amp;nbsp;â the [[Gadsden Purchase]]&amp;nbsp;â occurred in 1854. The [[Caste War of YucatÃ¡n]], the [[Maya peoples|Mayan]] uprising that began in 1847,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/98432/Caste-War Caste War (Central American history)].

Dissatisfaction with Santa Anna's return to power led to the liberal &quot;[[Plan of Ayutla]]&quot;, initiating an era known as [[La Reforma]], after which [[Constitution of 1857|a new Constitution was drafted in 1857]] that established a [[secular state]], federalism as the [[form of government]], and several freedoms. As the conservadores refused to recognize it, the [[Reform War]] began in 1858, during which both groups had their own governments. The war ended in 1861 with victory by the Liberals, led by Amerindian President [[Benito JuÃ¡rez]]. In the 1860s Mexico underwent a military occupation by France, which established the [[Second Mexican Empire]] under the rule of [[House of Habsburg|Habsburg]] [[Archduke]] [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Ferdinand Maximilian]] of [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] with support from the Roman Catholic clergy and the conservadores, who later switched sides and joined the liberales. Maximilian surrendered, was tried on June 14 and was executed on June 19, 1867.

====Porfiriato====
[[Porfirio DÃ­az]], a republican general during the [[French intervention in Mexico|French intervention]], ruled Mexico from 1876â1880 and then from 1884â1911 in five consecutive reelections, period known as the [[Porfirio DÃ­az|Porfiriato]], characterized by remarkable economic achievements, investments in [[the arts]] and [[science]]s, but also of [[income distribution|economic inequality]] and [[political repression]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Mexican Revolution====
[[Image:Madero en Cuernavaca.jpg|right|thumb|[[Francisco I. Madero]] with [[Emiliano Zapata]], in [[Cuernavaca]] during the Mexican revolution.]]
A likely electoral fraud that led to Diaz's fifth reelection sparked the [[Mexican Revolution|1910 Mexican Revolution]], initially led by [[Francisco I. Madero]].
DÃ­az resigned in 1911 and Madero was elected president but [[Decena trÃ¡gica|overthrown and murdered in a coup d'Ã©tat two years later]] directed by conservative general [[Victoriano Huerta]]. That event re-ignited the civil war, involving figures such as [[Francisco Villa]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]], who formed their own forces. A third force, the [[EjÃ©rcito Constitucionalista|constitutional army]] led by [[Venustiano Carranza]], managed to bring an end to the war, and radically amended the 1857 Constitution to include many of the social premises and demands of the revolutionaries into what was eventually called the [[Constitution of Mexico|1917 Constitution]]. It is estimated that the war killed 900,000 of the 1910 population of 15 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/opb/historydetectives/investigations/505_mexicanrevolution.html The Mexican Revolution].

Robert McCaa, University of Minnesota Population Center&lt;/ref&gt; Assassinated in 1920, Carranza was succeeded by another revolutionary hero, [[Ãlvaro ObregÃ³n]], who in turn was succeeded by [[Plutarco ElÃ­as Calles]]. ObregÃ³n was reelected in 1928 but assassinated before he could assume power.

In 1929, Calles founded the National Revolutionary Party (PNR), later renamed the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI), and started a period known as the [[Maximato]], which ended with the election of [[LÃ¡zaro CÃ¡rdenas]], who implemented many economic and social reforms, and most significantly [[Mexican oil expropriation|expropriated the oil industry]] into [[Pemex]] on March 18, 1938, but sparked a diplomatic crisis with the countries whose [[citizen]]s had lost businesses by CÃ¡rdenas' radical measure.

Between 1940 and 1980, Mexico experienced a substantial economic growth that some historians call the &quot;[[Mexican miracle]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Mexican Miracle: 1940â1968|work=World History from 1500|publisher=Emayzine|url=http://www.emayzine.com/lectures/mex9.html|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the economy continued to flourish, [[distribution of wealth|social inequality]] remained a factor of discontent.

That year, [[1980s oil glut|oil prices plunged]], interest rates soared, and the government defaulted on its [[debt]]. [[Miguel de la Madrid|President Miguel de la Madrid]] resorted to currency devaluations which in turn sparked inflation.

In the 1980s the first cracks emerged in PRI's monopolistic position. In [[Baja California]], [[Ernesto Ruffo Appel]] was elected as governor. In 1988, [[electoral fraud]] prevented leftist candidate [[CuauhtÃ©moc CÃ¡rdenas]] from winning the national presidential elections, giving [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] the Presidency and leading to massive protests in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.photius.com/countries/mexico/government/mexico_government_the_1988_elections.html|title=Photius Geographic.org, &quot;Mexico The 1988 Elections&quot;, (Sources: The Library of the Congress Country Studies, CIA World Factbook)|publisher=Photius.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salinas embarked on a program of [[neoliberalism|neoliberal]] reforms which fixed the exchange rate, controlled inflation and culminated with the signing of the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA), which came into effect on January 1, 1994.

The United Mexican States are a federation of thirty-one free and sovereign states, which form a union that exercises a degree of jurisdiction over the [[Mexican Federal District|Federal District]] and other [[territory (administrative division)|territories]].

Each state has its own constitution, [[congress]], and a judiciary, and its citizens elect by [[direct vote|direct voting]] a [[List of Mexican state governors|governor]] for a six-year term, and representatives to their respective unicameral state congresses for three-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 116|work=Political Constitution of the United Mexican States|publisher=Congress of the Union of the United Mexican States|url=http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Federal District is a special political division that belongs to the federation as a whole and not to a particular state, and as such, has more limited local rule than the nation's states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Article 112|work=Political Constitution of the United Mexican States|publisher=Congress of the Union of the United Mexican States|url=http://constitucion.gob.mx/index.php?idseccion=12|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico is crossed from north to south by two mountain ranges known as [[Sierra Madre Oriental]] and [[Sierra Madre Occidental]], which are the extension of the [[Rocky Mountains]] from northern North America. From east to west at the center, the country is crossed by the [[Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt]] also known as the Sierra Nevada. A fourth mountain range, the [[Sierra Madre del Sur]], runs from [[MichoacÃ¡n]] to [[Oaxaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Americas/Mexico-TOPOGRAPHY.html |title=Mexico Topography |publisher=Nationsencyclopedia.com |date=2007-10-16 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As such, the majority of the Mexican central and northern territories are located at high altitudes, and the highest elevations are found at the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt: [[Pico de Orizaba]] ({{convert|5700|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}), [[Popocatepetl]] ({{convert|5462|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) and [[Iztaccihuatl]] ({{convert|5286|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}) and the [[Nevado de Toluca]] ({{convert|4577|m|ft|0|disp=comma|abbr=on}}). Three major urban agglomerations are located in the valleys between these four elevations: [[Toluca]], [[Greater Mexico City]] and [[Puebla, Puebla|Puebla]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nationsencyclopedia1&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Mexico}}
[[File:Island-Bay-Chamela-Mexico.jpg|thumb|Isla Bay in the subtropic Central East.]]
[[File:SierraMadredelsur.jpg|thumb|Snowfall in Sierra Madre del Sur.]]
The [[Tropic of Cancer]] effectively divides the country into temperate and tropical zones. Land north of the twenty-fourth parallel experiences cooler temperatures during the winter months. South of the twenty-fourth parallel, temperatures are fairly constant year round and vary solely as a function of elevation. This gives Mexico one of the world's most diverse weather systems.

Areas south of the twenty-fourth parallel with elevations up to {{convert|1000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} (the southern parts of both coastal plains as well as the [[YucatÃ¡n Peninsula]]), have a yearly median temperature between {{convert|24|to|28|C|F|1}}. Temperatures here remain high throughout the year, with only a {{convert|5|C-change|0}} difference between winter and summer median temperatures. Both Mexican coasts, except for the south coast of the Bay of Campeche and northern Baja, are also vulnerable to serious [[tropical cyclone|hurricanes]] during the summer and fall. Although low-lying areas north of the twentieth-fourth parallel are hot and humid during the summer, they generally have lower yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|20|to|24|C|F|1|disp=or}}) because of more moderate conditions during the winter.

Many large cities in Mexico are located in the Valley of Mexico or in adjacent valleys with altitudes generally above {{convert|2000|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. This gives them a year-round temperate climate with yearly temperature averages (from {{convert|16|to|18|C|F|1|disp=or}}) and cool nighttime temperatures throughout the year.

Many parts of Mexico, particularly the north, have a dry climate with sporadic rainfall while parts of the tropical lowlands in the south average more than {{convert|2000|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} of annual precipitation. For example, many cities in the north like [[Monterrey]], [[Hermosillo]], and [[Mexicali]] experience temperatures of {{convert|40|C|F}} or more in summer. In the [[Sonoran Desert]] temperatures reach {{convert|50|C|F}} or more.

===Biodiversity===

In Mexico, {{convert|170000|km2|sqmi|0}} are considered &quot;Protected Natural Areas.&quot; These include 34 reserve biospheres (unaltered ecosystems), 64 national parks, 4 natural monuments (protected in perpetuity for their aesthetic, scientific or historical value), 26 areas of protected flora and fauna, 4 areas for natural resource protection (conservation of soil, hydrological basins and forests) and 17 sanctuaries (zones rich in diverse species).&lt;ref name=&quot;SEMARNAT&quot;/&gt;

The discovery of the Americas brought to the rest of the world many widely used [[Agriculture|food crops]] and [[edible plants]]. Some of Mexico's native [[culinary art|culinary]] ingredients include: [[chocolate]], [[avocado]], [[tomato]], [[maize]], [[vanilla]], [[guava]], [[chayote]], [[Dysphania ambrosioides|epazote]], [[Sweet potato|camote]], [[jÃ­cama]], [[nopal]], [[zucchini]], [[Crataegus mexicana|tejocote]], [[Corn smut|huitlacoche]], [[sapote]], [[mamey sapote]], many varieties of [[bean]]s, and an even greater variety of [[chili pepper|chiles]], such as the [[habanero]] and the [[jalapeÃ±o]]. Most of these names come from indigenous languages like [[Nahuatl]].

[[Mexico City]] is most popular with tourists as an ancient Mesoamerican city and the site of many popular tourist attractions such as the [[Pyramid of the Sun]] and the [[Pyramid of the Moon]]. The city is also home to the [[Plaza MÃ©xico]] and to the [[National Palace (Mexico)|Mexican National Palace]], built on the site of [[Moctezuma II|Montezuma]]'s palace, and the huge [[Mexico City Metropolitan Cathedral|Metropolitan Cathedral]], the largest in the Western Hemisphere, built over the even greater Temple of Teocalli.

[[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], the second-largest city by population in the Republic, is home of some of Mexico's best known traditions, such as [[tequila]], [[mariachi]] music and charros, or Mexican cowboys. Its similitude with western European countries mixed with modern architecture and infrastructure makes Guadalajara very attractive to tourists. Along with Mexico City and beach destinations ([[CancÃºn]], [[Acapulco]], etc.), Guadalajara is one of the most visited cities in Mexico. Cultural tourism is the main attraction, the city being home to a large number of museums, art galleries and theatres.

[[Monterrey]], was founded in the late 16th century. The downtown district is the oldest section in the city, surrounded by newer neighbourhoods. The Museo de Historia Mexicana (Museum of Mexican History), [[Museo de Arte ContemporÃ¡neo de Monterrey|MARCO]] (Monterrey Museum of Contemporary Art), Metropolitan Museum of Monterrey and the Museum of the [[Palacio de Gobierno]], or State House, are some of the better known museums in the city, as well as nationally.  The [[Santa LucÃ­a Riverwalk]] is a popular tourist site, connecting the [[Fundidora Park]] with the [[Macroplaza]], one of the largest plazas in the world.

===Communications===
{{Main|Telecommunications in Mexico}}
[[File:STS-51-G Morelos 1 deployment.jpg|thumb|A [[Satmex]] communications satellite being deployed from its launch vehicle]]

The telecommunications industry is mostly dominated by Telmex (''TelÃ©fonos de MÃ©xico''), privatized in 1990. As of 2006, Telmex had expanded its operations to Colombia, Peru, Chile, Argentina, Brazil and Uruguay and the United States. Other players in the domestic industry are [[Axtel]] and [[Maxcom]]. Due to Mexican [[orography]], providing landline telephone service at remote mountainous areas is expensive, and the penetration of line-phones per capita is low compared to other Latin American countries, at forty-percent, however 82% of Mexicans over the age of 14 own a mobile phone. Mobile telephony has the advantage of reaching all areas at a lower cost, and the total number of mobile lines is almost two times that of landlines, with an estimation of 63 million lines.&lt;ref name=ciacom&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mx.html#Comm Communications] CIA Factbook&lt;/ref&gt; The telecommunication industry is regulated by the government through [[Cofetel]] (''ComisiÃ³n Federal de Telecomunicaciones'').

The Mexican satellite system is domestic and operates 120 earth stations. There is also extensive microwave radio relay network and considerable use of fiber-optic and coaxial cable.&lt;ref name=ciacom/&gt; Mexican satellites are operated by ''SatÃ©lites Mexicanos'' ([[Satmex]]), a private company, leader in Latin America and servicing both North and South America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satmex.com.mx/english/?opcion=0 Satmex.

Usage of radio, television, and Internet in Mexico is prevalent.&lt;ref name=encnations/&gt; There are approximately 1,410 radio broadcast stations and 236 television stations (excluding repeaters).&lt;ref name=ciacom/&gt; Major players in the broadcasting industry are [[Televisa]]âthe largest Spanish media company in the Spanish-speaking world&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;âand [[TV Azteca]].

Sherwood Rowland]] for their work in atmospheric chemistry, particularly concerning the formation and decomposition of ozone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/chemistry/laureates/1995/index.html |title=The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 1995 |accessdate=2 January 2009 |work=Nobelprize.org |publisher=[[Nobel Foundation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molina, an alumnus of UNAM, became the first Mexican citizen to win the Nobel Prize in science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/newsoffice/1995/molina-1018.html |title=Molina wins Nobel Prize for ozone work |accessdate=2 January 2009 |author=Thomson, Elizabeth A. |date=18 October 1995 |work= |publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years, the biggest scientific project being developed in Mexico was the construction of the [[Large Millimeter Telescope]] (Gran Telescopio MilimÃ©trico, GMT), the world's largest and most sensitive single-aperture telescope in its frequency range.&lt;ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=January 2011}}Unravelling unidentified Î³-ray sources with the large millimeter telescope, Alberto CarramiÃ±ana and the LMT-GTM collaboration, in ''The Multi-Messenger Approach to High-Energy Gamma-Ray Sources'', Josep M.

&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican politicians and reformers such as [[JosÃ© Vasconcelos]] and [[Manuel Gamio]] were instrumental in building a Mexican national identity on the concept of mestizaje.&lt;ref&gt;Wade (1981:32)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:78â85)&lt;/ref&gt; The term [[mestizo]] often used in literature about Mexican social identities carries a variety of meanings containing both socio-cultural, economic, racial and biological components and for this reason it has been deemed to imprecise to be used for ethnic classification, for which reason it has been abandoned in Mexican censuses.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/377246/mestizo |title=mestizo (people) |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The category of &quot;indÃ­gena&quot; (indigenous) can be defined narrowly according to linguistic criteria including only persons that speak one of [[Languages of Mexico|Mexicos 62 indigenous languages]] or self-identify as having an indigenous cultural background. According with the [[National Commission for the Development of Indigenous Peoples]] as of 2005, there are 10.1 million Mexicans who speak an indigenous language and claim indigenous heritage, representing 9.8% of the total population.&lt;ref name=&quot;CDI1&quot;/&gt;

The word &quot;mestizo&quot; is sometimes used with the meaning of a person with mixed Indigenous and European blood. This usage does not conform to the Mexican social reality where a person of pure indigenous genetic heritage would be considered Mestizo either by rejecting his indigenous culture or by not speaking an indigenous language,&lt;ref&gt;BartolomÃ© (1996:2)&lt;/ref&gt; and a person with a very low percentage of indigenous genetic heritage would be considered fully indigenous either by speaking an indigenous language or by identifying with a particular indigenous cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Knight (1990:73)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples]] (CDI) there are 9,854,301 indigenous people reported in Mexico in 2000, which constitute 9.54% of the population in the country. The absolute indigenous population is growing, but at a slower rate than the rest of the population so that the percentage of indigenous peoples is nonetheless falling.&lt;ref&gt;http://mexico.cnn.com/nacional/2011/03/30/inegi-cada-vez-mas-mexicanos-hablan-una-lengua-indigena&lt;/ref&gt;  [http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index2.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=62&amp;Itemid=24 National Commission for the Development of the Indigenous Peoples]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;inegi1&quot;&gt;[http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/rutinas/ept.asp?t=mlen01&amp;c=3325  	Indicadores seleccionados sobre la poblaciÃ³n hablante de lengua indÃ­gena, 1950 a 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the indigenous population is concentrated in the central and southern states, that are generally the least developed, and the majority of the indigenous population live in rural areas. Some indigenous communities have a degree of autonomy under the legislation of &quot;usos y costumbres&quot;, which allows them to regulate some internal issues under [[customary law]]. According to the CDI, the [[political divisions of Mexico|states]] with the greatest percentage of indigenous population are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdi.gob.mx/index.php?id_seccion=91]&lt;/ref&gt; [[YucatÃ¡n]], with 59%, [[Quintana Roo]] with 39% and [[Campeche]] with 27% of the population being indigenous, most of them [[Maya people|Maya]]; [[Oaxaca]] with 48% of the population, the most numerous groups being the [[Mixtec]] and [[Zapotec people]]s; [[Chiapas]] has 28%, the majority being [[Tzeltal]] and [[Tzotzil]] Maya; [[Hidalgo (Mexico)|Hidalgo]] with 24%, the majority being [[Otomi people|Otomi]]; [[Puebla]] with 19%, and [[Guerrero]] with 17%, mostly [[Nahua people]] and the states of [[San Luis PotosÃ­]] and [[Veracruz]] both home to a population of 15% indigenous people, mostly from the [[Totonac]], Nahua and [[Huastec|Teenek (Huastec)]] groups.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/poblacion_indigena/Pob_ind_Mex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the indices of social development for the indigenous population are considerably lower than the national average. In all states indigenous people have higher [[infant mortality]], in some states almost double of the non-indigenous populations. Literacy rates are also much lower, with 27% of indigenous children between 6 and 14 being illiterate compared to a national average of 12%. The indigenous population participate in the workforce longer than the national average, starting earlier and continuing longer. However, 55% of the indigenous population receive less than a minimum salary, compared to 20% for the national average. Many practice subsistence agriculture and receive no salaries. Indigenous people also have less access to health care and a lower quality of housing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.inegi.org.mx/prod_serv/contenidos/espanol/bvinegi/productos/censos/poblacion/poblacion_indigena/Pob_ind_Mex.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Population genetics===

A study presented by the [[American Society of Human Genetics]] has shown (based on genes) that, on average, Mestizo Mexicans are (genetically) 58.96% European, 35.05% &quot;Asian&quot; (Amerindian), and 05.03% African. Sonora shows the highest European contribution (70.63%) and Guerrero the lowest (51.98%) where we also observe the highest Asian contribution (37.17%). African contribution ranges from 2.8% in Sonora to 11.13% in Veracruz. 80% of the Mexican population was classed as mestizo (defined as &quot;being racially mixed in some degree&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ashg.org/cgi-bin/ashg06s/ashg06?abst=mexican%20mestizo&amp;sort=ptimes&amp;sbutton=Detail&amp;absno=10071&amp;sid=864055 |title=Abstract/Presentation Search and Itinerary Planner |publisher=ASHG |date= |accessdate=2011-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the Mexican government founded the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) which launched the Mexican Genome Diversity Project. In May 2009, the Institute issued a report on a major genomic study of 300 mestizos in the Mexican population. The study showed that the Mestizo population in Mexico were on average 55% of indigenous ancestry followed by 41.8 % of European, 1.8% of African, and 1.2% of East Asian ancestry. The sample size used for this research involved 300 Mestizos who were picked from the states of Guerrero, Sonora, Veracruz, YucatÃ¡n, Zacatecas, and Guanajuato. Whereas Mestizo individuals from the state of Guerrero showed on average 66% of indigenous ancestry, those from the state of Sonora displayed about 61.6% European ancestry. There was a clear increase in indigenous ancestry as one traveled towards the Southern states in Mexico, while the indigenous ancestry declined as one traveled to the Northern states in the country, such as Sonora. The name of this paper was titled &quot;Analysis of genomic diversity in Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico&quot; by researchers such as Irma Silva-Zolezzi1 and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2009/05/11/0903045106.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;INMEGEN&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title= Analysis of genomic diversity in Mexican Mestizo populations to develop genomic medicine in Mexico|publisher= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A.|date= 2009-05-26|volume=106(21):8611-6|doi=10.1073/pnas.0903045106|author=Silva-Zolezzi I, Hidalgo-Miranda A, Estrada-Gil J, Fernandez-Lopez JC, Uribe-Figueroa L, Contreras A, Balam-Ortiz E, del Bosque-Plata L, Velazquez Fernandez D, Lara C, Goya R, Hernandez-Lemus E, Davila C, Barrientos E, March S, Jimenez-Sanchez G|journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|issue= 21|pages= 8611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metropolitan areas===

Metropolitan areas in Mexico have been traditionally defined as the group of municipalities that heavily interact with each other, usually around a core city.&lt;ref name=&quot;CONAPO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inegi.gob.mx/est/contenidos/espanol/metodologias/otras/zonas_met.pdf |title=DelimitaciÃ³n de las zonas metropolitanas de MÃ©xico |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, a joint effort between CONAPO, [[Instituto Nacional de EstadÃ­stica y GeografÃ­a|INEGI]] and the Ministry of Social Development (SEDESOL) agreed to define metropolitan areas as either:&lt;ref name=&quot;CONAPO&quot;/&gt;
* the group of two or more municipalities in which a city with a population of at least 50,000 is located whose urban area extends over the limit of the municipality that originally contained the core city incorporating either physically or under its area of direct influence other adjacent predominantly urban municipalities all of which have a high degree of social and economic integration or are relevant for urban politics and administration; or
* a single municipality in which a city of a population of at least one million is located and fully contained, (that is, it does not transcend the limits of a single municipality); or
* a city with a population of at least 250,000 which forms a [[conurbation]] with other cities in the United States.

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Mexico}}
[[File:Tradicionalranchero.JPG|thumb|right|[[Jarabe TapatÃ­o]], an example of traditional Mexican dance and costumes.]]
Mexican culture reflects the complexity of the [[History of Mexico|country's history]] through the blending of indigenous cultures and the [[culture of Spain]], imparted during Spain's 300-year colonization of Mexico. Exogenous cultural elements mainly from the United States have been incorporated into Mexican culture.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

The Porfirian era (''el [[Porfirio DÃ­az|Porfiriato]]''), in the last quarter of the 19th century and the first decade of the 20th century, was marked by economic progress and peace. After four decades of civil unrest and war, Mexico saw the development of philosophy and the arts, promoted by President DÃ­az himself. Since that time, as accentuated during the [[Mexican Revolution]], cultural identity has had its foundation in the ''mestizaje'', of which the indigenous (i.e. Amerindian) element is the core. In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[JosÃ© Vasconcelos]] in his publication ''La Raza CÃ³smica'' (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races (thus extending the definition of the ''mestizo'') not only biologically but culturally as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;vasconcelos160&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Vasconcelos|first=JosÃ©|coauthors=Didier T. JaÃ©n (translator)|title=La Raza CÃ³smica (The Cosmic Race)|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|year=1997|isbn=0-8018-5655-8|page=160 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This exalting of ''mestizaje'' was a revolutionary idea that sharply contrasted with the idea of a superior pure race prevalent in Europe at the time.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Literature===
{{Main|Mexican literature|Mesoamerican literature}}
[[File:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|thumb|upright|A late 18th century painting of [[Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz]], Mexican poet and writer.]]
The literature of Mexico has its antecedents in the literatures of the indigenous settlements of Mesoamerica. The most well known prehispanic poet is [[Nezahualcoyotl]]. Modern Mexican literature was influenced by the concepts of the Spanish colonialization of [[Mesoamerica]]. Outstanding colonial writers and poets include [[Juan Ruiz de AlarcÃ³n]] and [[Juana InÃ©s de la Cruz]].

In light of the various ethnicities that formed the Mexican people, [[JosÃ© Vasconcelos]] in his publication [[La Raza CÃ³smica]] (The Cosmic Race) (1925) defined Mexico to be the melting pot of all races, biologically as well as culturally.&lt;ref name=&quot;vasconcelos160&quot;/&gt;

Other writers include [[Alfonso Reyes]], [[JosÃ© JoaquÃ­n FernÃ¡ndez de Lizardi]], [[Ignacio Manuel Altamirano]], [[Carlos Fuentes]], [[Octavio Paz]] (Nobel Laureate), [[Renato Leduc]], [[Carlos MonsivÃ¡is]], [[Elena Poniatowska]], [[Mariano Azuela]] (&quot;Los de abajo&quot;) and [[Juan Rulfo]] (&quot;Pedro PÃ¡ramo&quot;). [[Bruno Traven]] wrote &quot;Canasta de cuentos mexicanos&quot;, &quot;El tesoro de la Sierra Madre.&quot;

===Visual arts===

[[File:Palacio de las Bellas Artes (Mexico City).jpg|thumb|right|[[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]] in Mexico City]]
Post-revolutionary art in Mexico had its expression in the works of renowned artists such as [[Frida Kahlo]], [[Diego Rivera]], [[JosÃ© Clemente Orozco]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], [[Federico CantÃº Garza]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] and [[Juan O'Gorman]]. Diego Rivera, the most well-known figure of Mexican muralism, painted the [[Man at the Crossroads]] at the [[Rockefeller Center]] in New York City, a huge mural that was destroyed the next year due to the inclusion of a portrait of Russian communist leader [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rockefeller Controversy|publisher=Diego Rivera Prints|url=http://www.diego-rivera.org/rockefellercontroversy.html|accessdate=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Rivera's murals are displayed at the Mexican [[National Palace (Mexico)|National Palace]] and the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes|Palace of Fine Arts]].

[[Mesoamerican architecture]] is mostly noted for its pyramids which are the largest such structures outside of Ancient Egypt.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} [[Spanish Colonial architecture]] is marked by the contrast between the simple, solid construction demanded by the new environment and the Baroque ornamentation exported from Spain.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Mexico, as the center of New Spain has some of the most renowned buildings built in this style.

[[Cinema of Mexico|Mexican films]] from the [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Golden Age]] in the 1940s and 1950s are the greatest examples of Latin American cinema, with a huge industry comparable to the [[Hollywood]] of those years. Mexican films were exported and exhibited in all of Latin America and Europe. [[Maria Candelaria]] (1944) by [[Emilio FernÃ¡ndez]], was one of the first films awarded a [[Palme d'Or]] at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] in 1946, the first time the event was held after World War II. The famous Spanish-born director [[Luis BuÃ±uel]] realized in Mexico, between 1947 to 1965 some of him master pieces like [[Los Olvidados]] (1949), [[Viridiana]] (1961) and [[El angel exterminador]] (1963). Famous actors and actresses from this period include [[MarÃ­a FÃ©lix]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Dolores del RÃ­o]], [[Jorge Negrete]] and the comedian [[Cantinflas]].

More recently, films such as [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|Como agua para chocolate]] (1992), [[Cronos (film)|Cronos]] (1993), [[Amores perros]] (2000), [[Y tu mamÃ¡ tambiÃ©n]] (2001), [[El crimen del Padre Amaro]] (The Crime of Father Amaro) (2002), [[Pan's Labyrinth]] (2006) and [[Babel (film)|Babel]] (2006) have been successful in creating universal stories about contemporary subjects, and were internationally recognised, as in the prestigious [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Mexican directors [[Alejandro GonzÃ¡lez IÃ±Ã¡rritu]] ([[Amores perros]], [[Babel (film)|Babel]]), [[Alfonso CuarÃ³n]] ([[Children of Men]], [[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]), [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Carlos Carrera]] ([[El crimen del Padre Amaro|The Crime of Father Amaro]]), and screenwriter [[Guillermo Arriaga]] are some of the most known present-day film makers.

Two of the major television networks based in Mexico are [[Televisa]] and [[TV Azteca]]. Televisa is also the largest producer of Spanish-language content in the world and also the world's largest Spanish-language media network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Televisa Brings 2006 FIFA World Cup to Mexico in HD With Snell &amp; Wilcox Kahuna SD/HD Production Switcher|work=Press release|date=2006-06-27 | publisher=[[Snell &amp; Wilcox]] | url=http://www.snellwilcox.com/news_events/press_releases/203 | accessdate=2007-09-30}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Grupo Multimedios]] is another media conglomerate with Spanish-language broadcasting in Mexico, Spain, and the United States. [[Soap opera]]s ([[telenovela]]s) are translated to many languages and seen all over the world with renowned names like [[VerÃ³nica Castro]], [[LucÃ­a MÃ©ndez]], [[Lucero (actress)|Lucero]], and [[ThalÃ­a]].

===Music===

Mexican society enjoys a vast array of music genres, showing the diversity of Mexican culture. Traditional music includes [[Mariachi]], [[banda music|Banda]], [[NorteÃ±o (music)|NorteÃ±o]], [[Ranchera]] and [[Corrido]]s; on an every-day basis most Mexicans listen to contemporary music such as [[Mexican pop music|pop]], [[rock music|rock]], etc. in both English and Spanish. Mexico has the largest media industry in Latin America, producing Mexican artists who are famous in Central and South America and parts of Europe, especially Spain. Some well-known Mexican singers are
[[ThalÃ­a]], [[Luis Miguel]], [[Alejandro FernÃ¡ndez]], [[Julieta Venegas]] and [[Paulina Rubio]]. Mexican singers of traditional music are: [[Lila Downs]], [[Susana Harp]], [[Jaramar]], [[GEO Meneses]] and [[Alejandra Robles]]. Popular groups are [[CafÃ© Tacuba]], [[Molotov (band)|Molotov]] and [[ManÃ¡]], among others. Since the early 2000s [[Mexican rock]] has seen widespread growth both domesticly and internationally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

According to the Sistema Nacional de Fomento Musical, there are between 120 and 140 youth orchestras affiliated to this federal agency from all federal states.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Some states, through their state agencies in charge of culture and the artsâMinistry or Secretary or Institute or Council of Culture, in some cases Secretary of Education or the State Universityâsponsor the activities of a professional [[Orchestra|Symphony Orchestra or Philharmonic Orchestra]] so all citizens can have access to this artistic expression from the field of [[classical music]]. Mexico City is the most intense hub of this activity hosting 12 professional orchestras sponsored by different agencies such as the National Intitute of Fine Arts, the Secretary of Culture of the Federal District, The National University, the National Polytechnic Institute, a DelegaciÃ³n PolÃ­tica (CoyoacÃ¡n) and very few are a kind of private ventures.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Mexican cuisine}}
[[File:Hot chocolate.jpg|thumb|right|&quot;[[Chocolate]]&quot; originates from Mexico's [[Aztec]] cuisine, derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word [[xocolatl]].]]
[[File:Cabrito con tamales 2.JPG|thumb|right|Cabrito con [[Tamales]].]]

Mexican cuisine is known for its intense and varied flavors, colorful decoration, and variety of spices. Most of today's Mexican food is based on pre-Columbian traditions, including the Aztecs and Maya, combined with culinary trends introduced by Spanish colonists.

The [[conquistador]]es eventually combined their imported diet of rice, beef, pork, chicken, wine, garlic and onions with the native pre-Columbian food, including [[maize]], [[tomato]], [[vanilla]], [[avocado]], [[guava]], [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[chili pepper]], [[bean]]s, [[squash (plant)|squash]], [[sweet potato]], [[peanut]], and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]].

Mexican food varies by region, because of local climate and geography and ethnic differences among the indigenous inhabitants and because these different populations were influenced by the Spaniards in varying degrees. The north of Mexico is known for its [[beef]], [[goat]] and [[ostrich]] production and [[meat]] dishes, in particular the well-known [[Arrachera]] cut.

Central Mexico's cuisine is largely made up of influences from the rest of the country, but also has its authentics, such as [[barbacoa]], [[pozole]], [[menudo (soup)|menudo]], [[tamales]], and [[carnitas]].

Southeastern Mexico, on the other hand, is known for its spicy [[vegetable]] and [[chicken]]-based dishes. The cuisine of Southeastern Mexico also has quite a bit of Caribbean influence, given its geographical location. [[Veal]] is common in the [[Yucatan]]. Seafood is commonly prepared in the states that border the Pacific Ocean or the [[Gulf of Mexico]], the latter having a famous reputation for its fish dishes, in particular Ã  la veracruzana.

In modern times, other cuisines of the world have become very popular in Mexico, thus adopting a Mexican fusion. For example, sushi in Mexico is often made with a variety of sauces based on [[mango]] or [[tamarind]], and very often served with [[serrano pepper|serrano]]-chili-blended soy sauce, or complemented with vinegar, [[habanero]] and [[chipotle]] peppers

The most internationally recognized dishes include [[chocolate]], [[taco]]s, [[quesadilla]]s, [[enchilada]]s, [[burrito]]s, [[tamale]]s and [[mole (sauce)|mole]] among others. Regional dishes include [[mole (sauce)|mole poblano]], [[chiles en nogada]] and [[chalupa]]s from [[Puebla]]; [[cabrito]] and [[machaca]] from Monterrey, [[cochinita pibil]] from [[YucatÃ¡n]], [[Tlayuda]]s from [[Oaxaca]], as well as [[barbacoa]], [[chilaquiles]], [[milanesa]]s, and many others.

By 1902 a five-team league had emerged with a strong British influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Introduction|publisher=Federacion Mexicana de Futbol|url=http://www.femexfut.org.mx/portalv2/(hjfqs545niz5yh55yipntw55)/default.aspx?s=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Mexico&amp;nbsp;â List of Final Tables|publisher=Rec.Sports.Soccer Statistics Foundation|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mexhist.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mexico's top clubs are [[Club Deportivo Guadalajara|Guadalajara]] with 11 championships, [[Club AmÃ©rica|AmÃ©rica]] with 10 and [[Deportivo Toluca F.C.|Toluca]] with 9.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Mexico&amp;nbsp;â List of Champions|publisher=Rec.Sports.Soccer Statistics Foundation|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/mexchamp.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antonio Carbajal]] was the first player to appear in five World Cups,{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} and [[Hugo SÃ¡nchez]] was named best [[CONCACAF]] player of the 20th century by IFFHS.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Baseball]] has traditionally been more popular than soccer in some regions.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} The Mexican professional league is named the [[Liga Mexicana de Beisbol]]. While usually not as strong as the United States, the Caribbean countries and Japan, Mexico has nonetheless achieved several international baseball titles.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} Mexico has had several players signed by Major League teams, the most famous of them being Dodgers pitcher [[Fernando Valenzuela]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

[[Bullfighting]] is a popular sport in the country, and almost all large cities have bullrings. [[Plaza MÃ©xico]] in [[Mexico City]], is the largest bullring in the world, which seats 55,000 people. Professional wrestling (or [[Lucha libre]] in Spanish) is a major crowd draw with national promotions such as [[Asistencia AsesorÃ­a y AdministraciÃ³n|AAA]], LLL, [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre|CMLL]] and others.

Mexico is an international power in [[professional boxing]] (at the amateur level, several Olympic boxing medals have also been won by Mexico).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} [[Vicente Saldivar]], [[RubÃ©n Olivares]], [[Salvador SÃ¡nchez]], [[Julio CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez]], [[Ricardo Lopez Nava|Ricardo Lopez]] and [[Erik Morales]] are but a few Mexican fighters who have been ranked among the best of all time.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Notable Mexican athletes include [[golf]]er [[Lorena Ochoa]], who was ranked first in the [[LPGA]] world rankings prior to her retirement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LPGA Rolex Women's World Golf Rankings|date=2007-10-01|url=http://www.lpga.com/content/RolexRankings10-1-2007.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=2007-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ana Guevara]], former world champion of the {{convert|400|m|ft|}} and Olympic subchampion in Athens 2004, and [[Fernando Platas]], a numerous Olympic medal winning diver.

==Health care==
{{Main|Health care in Mexico}}
[[Image:Mexicohospital.jpg|thumb|''Hospital Angeles'' in Mexico City, the largest Mexican private hospitals chain.]]
Since the early 1990s, Mexico entered a transitional stage in the health of its population and some indicators such as mortality patterns are identical to those found in highly developed countries like [[Germany]] or [[Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/mexico/63.htm |title=Mexico&amp;nbsp;â Health Care and Social Security |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although all Mexicans are entitled to receive medical care by the state, 50.3 million Mexicans had no medical insurance as of 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinais.salud.gob.mx/descargas/pdf/SE01_PoblacionesInst.pdf |title=Sistema Nacional de InformaciÃ³n en Salud&amp;nbsp;â Poblaciones de las Instituciones Prestadoras de Servicios de Salud de MÃ©xico: DefiniciÃ³n y ConstrucciÃ³n|format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to increase the number of people are being made, and the current administration intends to achieve [[universal health care]] by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidencia.gob.mx/prensa/presidencia/?contenido=38260 |title=De seguir por el camino correcto en materia de salud, en tres aÃ±os todos los mexicanos, sin excepciÃ³n, contarÃ¡n con mÃ©dico, medicinas y tratamiento cuando lo necesiten: Presidente CalderÃ³n |publisher=Presidencia.gob.mx |accessdate=2010-05-30}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.esmas.com/noticierostelevisa/mexico/009174/calderon-promete-cobertura-universal-salud |title=CalderÃ³n promete cobertura universal de salud |publisher=.esmas.com |date=2008-08-29 |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico's medical infrastructure is highly rated for the most part and is usually excellent in major cities,&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Care in Mexico&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatforum.com/articles/health/health-care-in-mexico.html |title=Health Care in Mexico |publisher=Expatforum.com |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kwintessential.co.uk/articles/article/Mexico/Health-Care-Issues-Mexico/695 |title=Health Care Issues Mexico |publisher=Kwintessential.co.uk |accessdate=2009-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but rural communities still lack equipment for advanced medical procedures, forcing patients in those locations to travel to the closest urban areas to get specialized medical care.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt;

State-funded institutions such as [[Mexican Social Security Institute]] (IMSS) and the [[Institute for Social Security and Services for State Workers]] (ISSSTE) play a major role in health and social security. Private health services are also very important and account for 13% of all medical units in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sinais.salud.gob.mx/medicinaprivada/index.html |title=Sistema Nacional de InformaciÃ³n en Salud&amp;nbsp;â Infraestructura |publisher=Sinais.salud.gob.mx |accessdate=2010-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical training is done mostly at public universities with much specializations done in vocational or internship settings. Some public universities in Mexico, such as the [[University of Guadalajara]], have signed agreements with the U.S. to receive and train American students in Medicine. Health care costs in private institutions and prescription drugs in Mexico are on average lower than that of its North American economic partners.&lt;ref name=&quot;Health Care in Mexico&quot;/&gt;

==Law enforcement==
Public security is enacted at the three levels of government, each of which has different prerogatives and responsibilities. Local and state police department are primarily in charge of law enforcement, whereas the [[Mexican Federal Police]] is in charge of specialized duties. All levels report to the SecretarÃ­a de Seguridad PÃºblica (Secretary of Public Security). The General Attorney's Office (ProcuradurÃ­a General de la RepÃºblica, PGR) is the [[executive (government)|executive power]]'s agency in charge of investigating and prosecuting crimes at the federal level, mainly those related to drug and arms trafficking,&lt;ref&gt;&quot; An Inside Look at Mexican Guns and Arms Trafficking,&quot; by Barnard R.

While the government respects the human rights of most citizens,&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt;{{failed verification|date=October 2011}} serious abuses of power have been reported in security operations in indigenous communities and poor urban neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt; The National Human Rights Commission has had little impact in reversing this trend, engaging mostly in documentation but failing to use its powers to issue public condemnations to the officials who ignore its recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/la/displaystory.cfm?story_id=10696136 Big, expensive and weirdly spineless].

Despite the efforts of the authorities to fight crime and fraud, few Mexicans have strong confidence in the police or the judicial system, and therefore, few crimes are actually reported by the citizens.&lt;ref name=brit-mex/&gt; The ''Global Integrity Index'' which measures the existence and effectiveness of national anti-corruption mechanisms rated Mexico 31st behind Kenya, Thailand, and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://report.globalintegrity.org/globalindex/results.cfm |title=Global Integrity Report |publisher=Report.globalintegrity.org |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, president CalderÃ³n proposed a major reform of the judicial system, which was approved by the Congress of the Union, which included oral trials, the presumption of innocence for defendants, the authority of local police to investigate crimeâuntil then a prerogative of special police unitsâand several other changes intended to speed up trials.&lt;ref&gt;McKinley, JC Jr. (March 7, 2008) [http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/07/world/americas/07mexico.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Mexicoâs Congress Passes Overhaul of Justice Laws].

Current president Felipe CalderÃ³n made abating drug-trafficking one of the top priorities of his administration. In a very controversial move, CalderÃ³n deployed military personnel to cities where drug cartels operate. While this move has been criticized by the opposition parties and the National Human Rights Commission, its effects have been praised by the [[Bureau for International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs]] as having obtained &quot;unprecedented results...&quot; with &quot;many important successes&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs.
