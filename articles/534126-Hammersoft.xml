'''DePaul University''' is a private institution of [[higher education]] and [[research]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]]. Founded by the [[Congregation of the Mission|Vincentian]]s in 1898, the university takes its name from the 17th century French priest [[Vincent de Paul|Saint Vincent de Paul]]. The student body consists of about 25,400 students (approximately 16,400 undergraduate and 9,000 graduate/law), making DePaul the largest [[Roman Catholic]] university and one of the 10 largest [[Private university|private universities]] in the United States; it is the largest private university in Illinois. DePaul is a member of the [[Big East Conference]].

==History==
[[File:DePaul University 1911.jpg|left|thumb|225px|A 1911 photograph of DePaul University in the ''[[Chicago Daily News]]'']]
Originally named '''St. Vincent's College''', DePaul University was founded in 1898 by the [[Congregation of the Mission]] priests and brethren, known as the [[Vincentian Family|Vincentians]]. Followers of 17th century French priest [[Saint Vincent de Paul]], they founded the university to serve [[Roman Catholic]] children of immigrants. &lt;!--  many of whom were denied admission to universities based on ethnic and religious quotas.
NOTE: Please source this allegation before unhiding the text --&gt;

Student enrollment grew from 70 in 1898 to 200 in 1903 in what is now the Lincoln Park neighborhood of [[Chicago]]. In that year, [[James Edward Quigley|James Quigley]], [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Chicago|Archbishop of Chicago]], announced plans to create a preparatory seminary, now [[Archbishop Quigley Preparatory Seminary]], for the archdiocese and allow the Jesuit Saint Ignatius College, now [[Loyola University Chicago]] to move its collegiate programs to the north side, threatening St. Vincent College's survival. In response, the Vincentians re-chartered in 1907 as DePaul University, expressly offering all of its courses of study to men and women of any religious background. DePaul began admitting women in 1911 and awarded degrees to its first female graduates in 1912. It was one of the first Catholic universities to admit female students in a [[Coeducation|co-educational]] setting.

In 1912, DePaul established the School of Music and the College of Commerce, the latter becoming one of the oldest business schools in the nation. In 1914, the College began offering courses in Chicago's Loop, the precursor of DePaul's second primary campus. In 1915, the Illinois College of Law completed its affiliation with the university and became the [[DePaul University College of Law]]. Enrollment totaled more than 1,100. With the entry of the United States into [[World War I]] in 1918, DePaul formed a unit of the [[US Army]] [[Reserve Officer Training Corps]] and converted its College Theatre into [[Army]] barracks.[[Image:dpu bktball.jpg|right|thumb|200px|DePaul University's basketball team (1908)]][[Image:dpu bsball.jpg|right|thumb|200px|DePaul University's baseball team (1908)]][[Image:dpu ftball.jpg|right|thumb|200px|DePaul University's football team (1916)]]

Although finances were rocky, the university continued to grow and build in the 1920s. In 1926, the university was first accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Universities. When DePaulâs first sports teams were formed in the early 1900s, the monogram &quot;D&quot; was selected for the uniforms. From this originated the nickname &quot;D-men&quot; which evolved into &quot;Demons.&quot; The color blue, which signifies loyalty and was chosen in 1901 by a vote of the student body, was added to the name to create the &quot;Blue Demons&quot;.

By 1930 more than 5,000 students were enrolled in eight colleges and schools on two campuses. [[Great Depression|The Great Depression]] led to fluctuations in enrollment and tuition as well as cutbacks, including elimination of the football team in 1939. In 1938, the Department of [[Primary education|Elementary Education]] was established, reportedly the only one in the [[Midwest]] and one of six in the [[United States]].

DePaul mobilized for [[World War II]], offering its facilities for war training and free courses to train people for industry work. The [[G.I. Bill]], which paid the tuition of veterans enrolled in college, turned the financial tide for DePaul. Enrollment in 1945 skyrocketed to 8,857 students, twice as many as the previous year, and totaled more than 11,000 in 1948. Although a [[Management consulting|consulting firm]] recommended relocating from its deteriorating Lincoln Park neighborhood to the suburbs, trustees voted to remain and support revitalization of the neighborhood.

In 1942, DePaul named [[Ray Meyer]] as head basketball coach. Meyer coached for DePaul until he retired in 1984, leading the 1945 team to the championship of the [[National Invitation Tournament]] and earning numerous honors, including election to the [[Basketball Hall of Fame|Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame]] in 1979, the fourth active coach to be so honored.

In 1954, DePaul adopted its current armorial seal with [[coat of arms]] and motto: &quot;Viam sapientiae monstrabo tibi&quot; (&quot;I will show you the way of wisdom&quot;, Proverbs, IV, 11). In 1955, the Frank J. Lewis Foundation donated the 18-story Kimball Building, rechristened the Lewis Center, at 25 East Jackson Boulevard, to the university. The building, still used today, was the hub of the Loop campus until 1993, when the DePaul Center opened at 1 East Jackson Boulevard (at State Street).

In 1972, DePaul created the School for New Learning, one of the first colleges in the nation dedicated to serving adult students. In 1976 and 1977, the university acquired the land and buildings of the [[McCormick Theological Seminary]], which increased its presence in Lincoln Park. In 1978, DePaul acquired the 47-year-old Goodman School of Drama from the [[Goodman Theatre]] and transformed it into The Theatre School.

Following renovations in the 1980s and expansion of academic programs to promote research and social engagement, the university launched a six-year strategic plan in 1989. The plan included raising the national profile, expanding enrollment from 13,500 to 18,500 and completing an extensive building campaign at the Loop and Lincoln Park campuses. Major construction included renovation of the DePaul Center in 1993 and acquisition of the Blackstone Theatre, rechristened the Merle Reskin, in 1992. At Lincoln Park, projects included the John T. Richardson Library, completed in 1992, several new [[dormitory|residence halls]] and the quadrangle.

In 1994 enrollment was 16,700. Under the next six-year strategic plan, the university expanded enrollment to 23,000 students, reclaiming its status as the nationâs largest Catholic university while maintaining admission standards, increasing diversity (currently, one third of the student population is of color) and maintaining access for first-generation college students and those from [[Poverty|low-income]] circumstances (about one-fourth of incoming freshmen qualify for Pell grants for low-income families). Additional new facilities included the William G. McGowan Biological and Environmental Sciences Center (McGowan North) in 1999, the Ray Meyer Fitness and Recreation Center in 1999, the Student Center in 2001 and the Sullivan Athletic Center in 2000, and the Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (McGowan South) in 2009. A privately owned and operated building, 1237 West, was built one block off campus as a student apartment community for over 580 DePaul University students with retail businesses on the first floor. DePaul was one of seven finalists for âCollege of the Yearâ honors given by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine and the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' in 1998. DePaul got the #1 ranking for Great College Town by the ''[[Princeton Review]]'' in 2008.

DePaul entered into a merger with [[Barat College]] in 2001, from which it withdrew in 2005 after continued low enrollment and rising maintenance costs made the campus unviable. The former [[Barat College]] had its final graduation on June 11, 2005 and was closed as of June 30, 2005. It sold the grounds of the 147-year-old college to a condominium developer Barat Woods LLC, who pledged to maintain the historic Old Main building, yet demolished the Thabor Wing with its Italianate style Sacred Heart Chapel. The remaining students, tenured and tenure-track faculty and some staff were absorbed into DePaul's other campuses. Barat Woods LLC went into foreclosure and the property was auctioned and the lender, Harris Bank won. The former Barat College campus was donated by an anonymous donor to Woodlands Academy of the Sacred Heart.

===Controversies===
Like other universities, DePaul has incurred controversies.
*In 1967, the Black Student Union (BSU) was formed. In 1969, while in ongoing negotiations with DePaul administrators, members of the group occupied a campus building for two days and led several related rallies. The actions helped bring concerns of [[African American|black]] students, and later those of [[Latino]], [[Muslim]] and other student groups, to the fore. The university now sponsors a wide range of student organizations, including BSU, the DePaul Conservative Alliance, DePaul Irish Society, the DePaul Alliance for Latino Empowerment, United Muslims Moving Ahead, Hillel, the Asian Cultural Exchange, the Hellenic-American Student Association and the Activist Student Union.

*In 2005, the university limited fliers protesting a visit of [[Ward Churchill]], which included the term &quot;hatemonger,&quot; declaring them &quot;propaganda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefire.org/index.php/case/697.html?PHPSESSID=8f23a23293632d52eb12df13cb5f8765 FIRE.org website]&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill's visit resulted in a bomb threat that prompted the university to limit attendance at the event.

*On May 24, 2006, the university sponsored a forum on [[free speech]] for students, faculty and interested community members, which featured [[Randall Kennedy]] of [[Harvard Law School]] and Ann Franke of United Educators in [[Washington, D.C.]], and included a discussion between the speakers and members of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsline.depaul.edu/newslineadmin/anmviewer.asp?a=620 Free speech forum at DePaul on 5/24/06]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://studentaffairs.depaul.edu/handbook/code1.html Free speech forum at DePaul on 5/24/06]&lt;/ref&gt;

*In June 2007, [[Norman Finkelstein]], an outspoken political science professor, was denied tenure. This followed a highly public and rancorous evaluation process in which an opponent of Finkelstein, [[Alan Dershowitz]], took the highly unorthodox step of sending unsolicited letters and dossiers to Finkelstein's peers at DePaul urging them to deny him tenure. DePaul's president, Rev. [[Dennis H. Holtschneider|Dennis Holtschneider]], denies that the outside pressure affected the university's position, saying ''&quot;This attention was unwelcome and inappropriate and had no impact on either the process or the outcome of this case.&quot;''&lt;ref&gt;[http://sherman.depaul.edu/media/webapp/mrNews.asp?NID=1630 DePaul University Statement on the Tenure and Promotion Decision Concerning Professor Norman Finkelstein] 6 June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Finkelstein's supporters claim he was denied tenure due to his writings on the [[Holocaust]] and on the state of the Palestinians under Israeli occupation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/jensen05252007.html The Commonplace Cowardice of Responsible Professors] What the Finkelstein Tenure Fight Tells Us About the State of Academia (Robert Jensen, [[CounterPunch]], 25 May 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zmag.org/content/showarticle.cfm?ItemID=13052 DePaul Genuflects to Dershowitz] ([[ZNet]], 12 June 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/EDUCATION/06/11/depaul.professor.ap/ DePaul denies tenure to controversial professor] ([[CNN]], 11 June 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; Detractors such as Dershowitz challenged Finkelstein's research methods and confrontational approach. On September 5, 2007, Finkelstein resigned after he and the university reached a settlement; they released a joint statement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sherman.depaul.edu/media/webapp/mrNews2.asp?NID=1655&amp;ln=true DePaul settlement with Dr. Finkelstein]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{See also|Dershowitz-Finkelstein affair}}

*In June 2009, the university removed the dean of the [[DePaul University College of Law|College of Law]], Glen Weissenberger. The recommendation to remove Dean Weissenberger was made by DePaul's provost, Helmut Epp, who stated in an e-mail to College of Law faculty and staff that &quot;the working relationship between the dean and the administration had deteriorated to the point where it had become difficult to accomplish the collegeâs work.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.wsj.com/law/2009/06/19/whats-going-on-at-depaul-law What's Going on at DePaul Law? - Law Blog - WSJ]&lt;/ref&gt; Weissenberger had recently reported to the [[American Bar Association]] that DePaul's administration had failed to redistribute law school tuition income appropriately, in violation of ABA accreditation rules. Some DePaul faculty and students, as well as several independent observers in the law school community, have speculated that Weissenberger's removal was directly related to his report to the ABA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://taxprof.typepad.com/taxprof_blog/2009/06/depaul-fires-.html TaxProf Blog: DePaul Fires Dean in Dispute Over Tuition to be Retained by Law School]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://leiterlawschool.typepad.com/leiter/2009/06/depaul-provosts-ousts-law-dean-without-consulting-faculty-plans-to-appoint-an-outside-as-interim-dea.html DePaul Provost Ousts Law Dean Without Consulting Faculty, Plans to Appoint an Outsider as Interim Dean]&lt;/ref&gt; The ABA did not find any irregularities that would affect the school's accreditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/business/chi-tue-chicago-law-07-28jul28,0,6099572.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=Chicago Tribune |date= |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In recent years, DePaul has been the target of criticism, for different reasons, by various [[conservatism|conservative]] and free speech organizations.The most active of the free speech groups is [[Foundation for Individual Rights in Education|FIRE]]. The organization lists DePaul as the second worse college in America for free speech http://www.huffingtonpost.com/greg-lukianoff/the-12-worst-colleges-for_b_814706.html#s230523&amp;title=SUNY_BinghamtonBinghamton_New.  FIRE gave the President of the University, [[Dennis H. Holtschneider]], its award for the worst protector of Free Speech by a university president.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/7007.html?PHPSESSID=8f23a23293632d52eb12df13cb5f8765 FIRE - University presidents battle for honors in spinelessness]&lt;/ref&gt; FIRE and others have criticized the university's decision to suspend without public hearing and not renew the contract of part-time faculty member [[Thomas E. Klocek]] in September 2004 for comments made to and behaviour towards [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] students concerning the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict|conflict]] with [[Israel]]. The event resulted in FIRE's harsh criticism of the university's level of support for open discussion and debate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefire.org/index.php/article/5671.html FIRE.org website].&lt;/ref&gt; University supporters maintain that the issue was not Klocek's views, but the manner in which he expressed them. The conflict happened in the student union and campus security was called.

==Campuses==
[[Image:RichardsonLibraryDePaul.jpg|thumb|200px|Completed in 1992, Richardson Library faces the Quad in the heart of DePaul University's Lincoln Park Campus.]]

DePaul's two primary campuses are in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood of [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]] and the downtown [[Chicago Loop|Loop]] area. The university has suburban campuses in [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]], [[Oak Forest, Illinois|Oak Forest]], [[O'Hare, Chicago|O'Hare]] and [[Rolling Meadows, Illinois|Rolling Meadows]].

'''Lincoln Park Campus'''
DePaul's Lincoln Park Campus is the oldest and largest of the university's six campuses. Located on {{convert|36|acre|ha|2}} in [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago's]] historic Lincoln Park neighborhood, this campus offers a traditional university environment. Approximately 2,400 students live on campus in DePaul's twelve residence halls.

The Lincoln Park Campus is home to the College of [[Liberal arts|Liberal Arts]] and Social Sciences, the College of [[Communication]], The Theatre School, the School of Music, the College of Education, the College of Science and Health, and the John T. Richardson Library. Opened in 1992, the library features study and small-group spaces, an automated reference center, and a high-tech Resource Center for [[Career development|Career Development]].

[[Image:StudentCenterDePaul.jpg|thumb|200px|Completed in 2002, the Student Center is a central meeting place for students.]]
[[Image:Depaul University Student Center.jpg|thumb|200px|Student Center in March 2007.]]
The three-level Student Center, which opened in 2002, houses student services, dining facilities, the Saint Louise de Marillac Chapel, a [[Internet cafe|cyber cafe]], a PNC Bank and offices for organizations ranging from special-interest clubs to the Center for Intercultural Programs. Other recent additions include the [[Sullivan Athletic Center]], containing McGrath-Phillips Arena, and the [[Ray Meyer]] Fitness and Recreation Center. The Monsignor Andrew J. McGowan Environmental Science and Chemistry Building (McGowan South) is a new four-story building completed in January 2009, it is connected to the William G. McGowan Biological and Environmental Sciences Center (McGowan North). The Lincoln Park campus also contains the remnants of the former [[McCormick Theological Seminary]], these buildings (those remaining) are located east of the elevated tracks. This expansion was completed in the 1970s when McCormick moved its campus to the Hyde Park neighborhood. The McCormick Row Houses along the south side of Fullerton Avenue east of the elevated station, though now privately owned, were originally constructed for the Seminary. Also, until its destruction in 2006, the gothic architecture Hayes-Healy Athletic Center adjacent to the CTA Fullerton 'L' Station (similar in design to the still-present Cortelyou Commons next to Wish Field at Cacciatore Stadium) was also part of the Seminary campus. The gymnasium was demolished as part of the renovation/expansion of the Fullerton 'L' stop, despite being on the National Register of Historic Places.

'''Loop Campus'''
DePaul's Loop campus is located in downtown Chicago's Loop along Jackson Boulevard from State Street to Michigan Avenue. It is close to the [[stock exchange]]s, financial district, and the [[Art Institute of Chicago]]. The DePaul Center (DPC), an 11-story building fully renovated in 1993 to include modern classrooms, high-tech student services and a business library, is located in the building that formerly housed the  A. M. Rothschild &amp; Company Store and the Goldblatt's Department Store. It is home to the College of Commerce. In November 2000, the [[Urban Land Institute]] presented DPC with its Award for Excellence for Rehabilitation.

The [[DePaul University College of Law|College of Law]] is based in the Lewis Center and O'Malley Place at the southwest corner of Wabash and Jackson. Kitty-corner across the street is the [[DePaul University College of Computing and Digital Media|College of Computing and Digital Media]]. In 2008, DePaul purchased the 18-story 14 East Jackson Boulevard Building at State and Jackson, formerly the Lytton Building, across the street from the DePaul Center. The College of [[Communication]], the [[School for New Learning]] and the [[School of Public Service]] were the first academic tenants of 14 East Jackson Boulevard, now the Richard M. and Maggie C. Daley Building.

DePaul partnered with [[Roosevelt University]] and [[Columbia College Chicago]] to build the University Center of Chicago, an 18-story residence hall two blocks south of DPC housing 1,700 students, which opened in 2004 at the intersection of State and Congress Streets. [[Robert Morris University (Illinois)|Robert Morris University]] later joined and also houses students in the University Center of Chicago.

'''Suburban Campuses'''
DePaul has suburban campuses in [[Rolling Meadows]], [[O'Hare, Chicago|O'Hare]], [[Oak Forest, Illinois|Oak Forest]] and [[Naperville, Illinois|Naperville]]. The four suburban campuses primarily serve [[Part time|part-time]] [[professional student]]s completing undergraduate and graduate degrees.

The [[DePaul University College of Computing and Digital Media]] (CDM) is also located in the Loop and includes the largest graduate program in the United States. CDM is organized into two schools: the School of Cinema and Interactive Media and the School of Computing. At the 2006 [[Association for Computing Machinery|ACM]] [[ACM International Collegiate Programming Contest|International Collegiate Programming Contest]], in which over 5,600 teams representing 1,733 universities from 84 countries competed, DePaul placed 29th, one of three [[Universities in the United States|U.S. universities]] in the top 30 ([[MIT]] placed 7th, [[Princeton University|Princeton]] placed 28th). CDM is a recognized national leader in [[computer network security]] and [[information assurance]] education, according to a designation bestowed by the [[National Security Agency]] and the [[U.S. Department of Homeland Security]]. DePaul was named as a National Center of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance by the two agencies in early 2005. CDM was one of only six schools nationwide (and the only Midwestern university) selected by [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] to take part in the inaugural Imageworks Professional Academic Excellence (IPAX) program. The program is a collaboration to educate faculty and structure curricula in an effort to develop future artists, designers, animators and engineers who will help the [[visual effects]] industry to grow. DePaul's [[Digital cinema|Digital Cinema]] program, one of the first of its kind in the nation, combines the artistic principles of [[film school]] programs with the technology expertise of digital graphics, visual effects and [[digital storytelling]]. In 2005 DePaul became the first Liberal Arts university in the US to offer a Bachelors degree in Computer Games Development, and in 2008 named [[Eugene Jarvis]] their first Game Designer in Residence. In 2011, DePaul became the first university in the Midwest to offer an MFA Screenwriting and an MFA Animation.

SNL was named one of six &quot;Best Practice&quot; institutions in North America by the Council for Adult and [[Experiential education|Experiential Learning]], an international [[non-profit organization]] which advocates for adult learning. The Houston-based American Productivity and Quality Center has touted SNL for its individualized education of adult students.
