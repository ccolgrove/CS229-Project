'''''StepMania''''' is an [[open source]] and [[cross-platform]] [[Rhythm game|rhythm video game]] and [[game engine|engine]]. It was originally developed as a simulator of [[Konami]]'s [[arcade game]] series ''[[Dance Dance Revolution]]'', and has since evolved into an extensible rhythm game engine capable of supporting a wide variety of rhythm-based game types. Released under the [[MIT License]], ''StepMania'' is [[free software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.spong.com/article/12240/Rock_Bands_Guitar_Heroes_Recriminations_and_Comedy_Litigation?cb=767 |title=Rock Bands, Guitar Heroes, Recriminations and Comedy Litigation |date=2007-04-04 |work=Sprong |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Video game series [[In the Groove (series)|In the Groove]] and [[Pump It Up Pro]], among others, use StepMania as their game engine. StepMania was included in a video game exhibition at New York's [[American Museum of the Moving Image|Museum of the Moving Image]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.movingimage.us/site/screenings/content/2005/digital_play_reloaded.html Museum of the Moving Image article]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
StepMania 4.0, based on a 2006 CVS build of StepMania, better known as 3.95, was in the beta stage of development. &lt;ref name=&quot;Danford08-10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Danford|first=Chris|title=StepMania project reboot: opinions wanted|url=http://www.stepmania.com/forums/showthread.php?t=24111|work=StepMania.com|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the announcement of StepMania 4 beta, StepMania's CVS/SVN fork has been unofficially branded by the StepMania community as version 5.0&lt;ref name=&quot;DanfordBeta1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Danford|first=Chris|title=Release: StepMania 4.0b1|url=http://www.stepmania.com/forums/showpost.php?p=173303&amp;postcount=29|work=StepMania|accessdate=15 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A separate development team called the Spinal Shark Collective [[Fork (software development)|fork]]ed Stepmania 4 Alpha, calling it ''sm-ssc''. ''sm-ssc'' added more features and made many bug fixes. In Mid-2011 sm-ssc merged into official branch of StepMania and thus, The alpha development stage of Stepmania 5 ended.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/sm-ssc/ sm-ssc (now Stepmania 5) Google Code page]&lt;/ref&gt; Development of Stepmania 4 beta also discontinued.

==Gameplay==
The primary game type features the following game play: as [[arrow (symbol)|arrow]]s scroll upwards on the [[Display device|screen]], they meet a normally stationary set of target arrows.  When they do, the player presses the corresponding arrows on his or her keyboard or [[dance mat]]. The moving arrows meet the [[wiktionary:Target|target]]s based on the beat of the song. Stepmania strongly utilizes a player's sense of rhythm in its game play. The game is scored based upon how accurately the player can trigger the arrows in time to the beat of the song. The player's efforts are awarded by letter [[Grade (education)|grades]] and a number score that tell him/her how well they have done. An award of AAAA (quadruple A) is the highest possible award available on a standard installation and indicates that a player has triggered all arrows with &quot;marvelous&quot; timing (within 0.0225 seconds under official [[settings]]) and avoided all mines and completed all hold arrows. However, a patch is available that provides &quot;ridiculous&quot; timing (within a window of 0.01125 seconds, or half the timing of marvelous) and a top grade of AAAAA (quintuple A). An E indicates failure for a player to survive the length of the song without completely draining his/her life bar. Default scoring and grading for Stepmania is almost identical to scoring in Dance Dance Revolution; however, timing and scoring settings can easily be changed.

StepMania allows for several input options. Specialized adapters that connect console peripherals like [[PS2]] and [[Xbox]] controllers or [[dance pad]]s to one's computer can be used. Alternatively, and most popularly, the [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] can be used to tap out the rhythms using arrow or other keys. Many song charts designed for [[Keyboard (computing)|keyboard]] are unable to be passed using a pad. In addition, the game possesses the capability to emulate other music games, such as [[Beatmania]] itself, [[o2Jam]] and [[DJMAX]]'s 7-key arrangement, [[Pump It Up]] and [[Techno Motion]] - but scoring however, remains identical to DDR-style play, although some have found a way to change the scoring method to a Pump it Up style.

==Features==
*Custom Songs (&quot;Stepfiles&quot;) also known as &quot;Simfiles&quot;: StepMania allows users to create their own custom dance patterns to any song in [[.ogg]] or [[.mp3]] format. The program includes a comprehensive Step editor to aid the creation of these stepfiles. Despite copyright concerns, many Simfile websites exist where users share and distributed Simfiles for copyrighted songs. Additionally, official [[Dance Dance Revolution|DDR]] and [[In the Groove (video game)|In The Groove]] songs with their original steps are commonly available for StepMania.

*Background [[animation]]s: Support for many types of animations behind the arrows onscreen, including sprite-based animation sequences, a single full-motion video or multiple FMV visualization overlays.

*Modifiers: Visual mods that affect the scroll of arrows and either increase or decrease difficulty. StepMania includes multiple modifiers featured in Dance Dance Revolution as well as dozens of additional modifiers created exclusively for StepMania.

*Multiple arrow types:

:* [[Land mine|Mines]]: An object that scrolls onto the screen along with the arrows. If a player triggers the mines, they will be penalized by having their dance gauge reduced. This step type was developed for the StepMania-based [[arcade game]] ''[[In the Groove (game)|In The Groove]]'', and was ported into StepMania itself during development of that title. A derivative of these mines, known as &quot;Attack Mines&quot; or &quot;Mod Bombs&quot;, force a modifier change on the player when triggered instead of diminishing the dance gauge.

:*Holds: A long arrow that requires you to keep your feet on the corresponding panel for its duration to pass.

:*Rolls: A special hold arrow which requires a rapid tap on to keep alive. This step type was developed for the sequel to In The Groove - [[In the Groove 2]], and was ported into the StepMania 4.0 development builds.

:*Lift: a special type of arrow (colored Gray by default) which requires the key (or panel) to be held down '''before''' the note passes and released when the note passes the target arrows. This is different from freeze arrows in that the timing of the press is not important, only when the note is released.

*Multiple game types, including partial simulation of other dance games like [[Pump It Up]], [[ParaParaParadise]] and [[EZ2Dancer]].

*Real-time lyrics, which display on the opposite side of the screen for stepfiles that have [[LRC (file format)|accompanying lyric data]].

*Custom themes: users can create their own [[Skin (computing)|skins]] for Stepmania. StepMania themes can vary from simple replacement of images to drastic changes that can be implemented by scripting its [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] backend.

*Dancing characters: 2-dimensional and 3-dimensional character models that dance in the background according to a pre-defined routine.

*Infinite BPMs: an official implementation in StepMania 4 of a bug in the 3.9 series that could be exploited to create &quot;warps&quot; in stepcharts using negative speeds.

*Network play: support for lobby-based online play, dubbed ''StepMania Online.'' Typically, users connect through the ''StepMania Online''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepmaniaonline.com Stepmania Online Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; centralized server. Network Play is only available with StepMania 5.0 builds or alphas. All players must have a copy of the song chosen by the host in order to play.

==Availability==

[[File:Stepmania-arcade.jpg|thumb|right|StepMania-based arcade machine in a Chinese amusement park]]

StepMania runs on most common operating systems ([[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows 98|98]]/[[Windows Me|Me]]/[[Windows 2000|2000]]/[[Windows XP|XP]]/[[Windows Vista|Vista]]/[[Windows 7|7]], [[GNU/Linux]], [[Mac OS X]]), and has also been used as the base engine in a variety of [[free software]] and [[proprietary software|proprietary]] products.  It has also been ported to several platforms including the [[Xbox]], [[iPod]] (running Linux) and cell phones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepmaniawiki.com/wiki/FAQ:_Xbox_version StepMania Xbox FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use in products===
Several StepMania-based games have been released due to its open nature:

*''[[In the Groove (game)|In The Groove]]'' (ITG) is an arcade dance game series developed by the core StepMania developers, and is based on 3.9 and a CVS build of StepMania often known as version 3.95. To prevent [[Copyright infringement of software|unauthorized copying]], StepMania was re-licensed under a more permissive license (changed from [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] to the [[MIT License]] with the agreement of all coders, in exchange for their names appearing on the ITG credits screen), not requiring source code to be published on derivative works, and thus allowing ITG's [[copy control]] to remain proprietary and [[closed source software|closed source]].

*''[[Pump it Up Pro]]'' is a spinoff of the [[Pump it Up]] series headed by former ITG developers and musicians. The game utilizes a build of StepMania 4 for its engine, which also led to improved Pump support in StepMania itself.

==StepMix==
StepMania developers conducted StepMix contest for step builders to create stepcharts/stepfiles that can be played using StepMania. StepMix 1, 2, 3, and 4 were run successfully. Participants need to have a song to be used in the stepchart/stepfile. The song must be under a compatible license for distribution or be authorized for use in StepMix 4, or the entry is automatically disqualified.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepmaniawiki.com/wiki/StepMix_4_Contest#Entry_requirements StepMix 4 Contest Entry requirements]&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, if the graphics used in the entry are found to have been copied from another artist and used without their authorization (as happened once in StepMix 2&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepmania.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=4063 My art is in a song...but I dont know who took it! - StepMania Forums]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepmania.com/forums/showpost.php?p=70791&amp;postcount=14 StepMania Forums - View Single Post - 20070310|Dokodemo Kawaii]&lt;/ref&gt;), the entry may be disqualified.

The scoring is determined by the overall quality of the song, steps and graphics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stepmaniawiki.com/wiki/StepMix_4_Contest#Judging StepMix 4 Contest Judging]&lt;/ref&gt;
