== History ==
The first devices to run a mobile edition of Opera were the [[Psion Series 5]], [[Psion Series 5mx]], [[Psion Series 7]], and then [[Psion netBook]]. They ran Opera Mobile 3.6, released in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Opera Mobile was ported to the [[Windows Mobile]] operating system in 2003.&lt;ref name=&quot;Timeline&quot;/&gt;

* Version 6.0 was the initial release.
* On June 25, 2003, the first update came in the form of version 6.01, which was a minor update, mainly correcting bugs.
* Version 6.10, released on October 27, 2003, introduced several user interface and usability improvements, considerably optimized performance, and slightly improved page rendering. It was also the first version to support [[proxy server]]s, [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] pages, and the first one to be released in localized versions for 9 different languages.
* On July 13, 2005, almost two years after the previous iteration, version 8.0 was launched. This version was the first to require [[Symbian OS]] 7 (previous ones could function in Symbian 6.1). This version introduced the Opera Mobile Accelerator, a technology that used an Opera-run external server to slim-down the pages' content to reduce the traffic to the phones. This was also the first version to support [[dynamic HTML]], and greatly improved compatibility with several web standards.
* On November 14, 2005, version 8.5 was introduced. This version introduced password management and form auto-filling functionality, added some more languages for localized versions, and made some improvements to stability and reduced-screen rendering quality.
* On April 5, 2006, version 8.6 was released and was also the first version to support Symbian OS 9. New to this version is the ability to support multiple browsing windows, support for [[Scalable Vector Graphics]], introduction of [[URL]] autocompletion as well several changes in the customization aspect. It was also the first version of Opera Mobile that allowed for the possibility to configure it as the device's default browser, allowing for it to be launched whenever a web page was requested to be opened.
* Version 8.65 was released on August 29, 2006, which was mostly a welcome makeover and optimization to the then considered mature 8.60.
* Opera Mobile 9.0 was announced in February 2007 with a planned feature list, &quot;coming soon&quot; banners in the official Opera Mobile website, and official announcements in Opera's Community Forum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.softpedia.com/news/Opera-Mobile-9-Unveiled-46893.shtml Opera Mobile 9 Unveiled - The new version includes Widgets and Intelligent Zoom - Softpedia]. News.softpedia.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; With no reason given, version 9.0 was cancelled, all references to it swept from Opera's site and 8.65 went back to being the latest version, being given a very slight refresh in the form of a new build that offered a handful of hardly-noticeable features, some of them platform-dependent.
* On February 5, 2008, Opera Mobile 9.5 was announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/pressreleases/en/2008/02/05/ Opera unleashes innovative technology in latest mobile Web browser â Opera Mobile 9.5]. Opera.com (2008-02-05). Retrieved on 2011-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been given several estimated release timeframes, each of which has been silently ignored with a new one being set after it. An initial beta version of Opera Mobile 9.5 was released on July 17, 2008, although the only platform supported by this version was Windows Mobile.
* A second beta release of Opera Mobile 9.50 was made on October 20, 2008, including support for Opera Widgets, and adding Symbian UIQ3 as a further platform. With this release, the newest version of Opera Mobile for Symbian S60 remains 8.65.
* On March 26, 2009, Opera announced that there won't be any final version of Opera mobile 9.5. Instead they would flip over to developing 9.7 because of changes in the [[Presto layout engine]].
* On June 8, 2009, Opera Mobile 9.7 beta was made available for download. It introduced the new rendering engine Presto 2.2 and Opera Turbo. Other features planned for 9.7 are an improved Widget manager, Google Gears, and OpenGL ES support.
* On November 2, 2009, Opera Mobile 10 beta for Symbian S60 was made available for download, sporting a revamped user interface and performance enhancements.
* On December 10, 2009, Opera Mobile 10 was released to operators and OEMs. It includes Opera's new, cross-platform UI framework that unifies the look and feel of the browser across all platforms running Opera Mobile or [[Opera Mini]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 10&quot;/&gt;
* On February 12, 2010, Opera Mobile 10 beta 3 was publicly released for Windows Mobile and Symbian devices.  It includes support for Flash Lite 3.1 as well as better recognition for third party input solutions in Windows Mobile.  It also adds support for Windows Mobile Standard (non-touchscreen) handsets.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 10&quot;/&gt;
* On March 16, 2010, Opera Software released the final versions of Opera Mobile 10.
[[File:Nokia5800 Opera Mobile 10 1 Beta.JPG|thumb|290px|left|The [[Nokia 5800 XpressMusic]], running Opera Mobile 10.1 Beta]]
* On May 11, 2010, Opera labs released a preview build of Opera Mobile 10 for [[Maemo]]. The preview build has the same features available in Opera Mobile 10 for other platforms but uses Opera's new JavaScript engine (codenamed [[Carakan (script engine)|Carakan]]), as well as the new vector graphics library (codenamed Vega).&lt;ref name=&quot;Weâre back! Opera Mobile 10 on Maemo&quot;/&gt;
* On October 15, 2010, Opera Software released Opera Mobile 10.1 Beta for Android to the Android Market, the first public build for Android.
* On March 22, 2011, Opera Software released Opera Mobile 11 for Android,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 11&quot; /&gt; Symbian S60,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 11&quot; /&gt; Maemo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 11 labs&quot; /&gt; MeeGo,&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 11 labs&quot; /&gt; and [[Windows]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile 11 labs&quot; /&gt;

== Features ==
&lt;!-- [[File:Mini 5 Commercial.ogv|thumb|350px|Opera Mobile 10 and Opera Mini 5 Commercial]] --&gt;
Opera Mobile uses the [[Presto layout engine]] and supports many web standards, as well as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/business/solutions/mobile/features/ Opera Solutions: Opera Mobile]. Opera.com. Retrieved on 2011-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt; As of version 9.7, it can use Opera Turbo that compresses web pages via [[Opera Software]]'s &quot;Turbo&quot; servers, thus reducing download size. Because web pages are compressed, page loading times are improved, and bandwidth consumption is reduced by up to 80%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opera.com/press/releases/2009/02/12/ Opera unveils turbo-charged browsing at Mobile World Congress 2009]. Opera.com (2009-02-12). Retrieved on 2011-01-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The browser can dynamically reformat [[web page]]s for small screen, using Opera's Small Screen Rendering (SSR) technology and [[word wrap|text-wrapping]].

Opera Mobile 10 includes a &quot;[[Features of the Opera web browser#Speed Dial|Speed Dial]]&quot; feature, which allows the user to add links shown as thumbnail images in a page displayed when a new tab is opened. Once set up, this feature allows the user to more easily navigate to the selected web pages, and [[Tab (GUI)|visual tabs]], that allow the browsing multiple Web sites at one time. It also includes a [[password manager]] and [[Pop-up ad|pop-up handler]], and it supports [[copy and paste]], [[autocomplete|address auto-complete]], [[page zooming|zooming]], history, and [[bookmark (web)|bookmarks]].

The browser can be used by either using finger-touch or stylus on a touchscreen or with a keypad and can be displayed in portrait and landscape mode.
