'''''Torchwood''''' is a [[British television science fiction|British science fiction]] television programme created by [[Russell T Davies]]. The series is a [[Doctor Who spin-offs|spin-off]] from Davies's 2005 revival of the long-running science fiction programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''. The show has shifted its broadcast channel each series to reflect its growing audience, moving from [[BBC Three]] to [[BBC Two]] to [[BBC One]], and acquiring US financing in its fourth series. In contrast to ''Doctor Who'', whose target audience includes both adults and children, ''Torchwood'' is aimed at an older audience.

''Torchwood'' follows the exploits of a small team of alien-hunters, who make up the [[Cardiff]], [[Wales]] branch of the fictional [[Torchwood Institute]], which deals mainly with incidents involving extraterrestrials. Its central character is [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]), an immortal former con-man from the distant future; Jack originally appeared in the [[Doctor Who (series 1)|2005 series]] of ''Doctor Who''. Other than Barrowman, the initial main cast of the series consisted of [[Eve Myles]], [[Burn Gorman]], [[Naoko Mori]] and [[Gareth David-Lloyd]]. Their characters are specialists for the Torchwood team, often tracking down aliens and defending the planet from alien and nefarious human threats. In its first two series, the show uses a [[Cardiff Rift|time rift in Cardiff]] as its primary [[plot generator]], accounting for the unusual preponderance of alien beings in Cardiff. In the third and fourth series, Torchwood operate as fugitives. Gorman and Mori's characters were written out of the story at the end of the second series. Recurring actor [[Kai Owen]] was promoted to the main cast in series three, in which David-Lloyd too was written out. Subsequently, American actors [[Mekhi Phifer]], [[Alexa Havins]] and [[Bill Pullman]] joined the cast of the show for its fourth series; the latter two were written out at the end of its run.

The first series premiered on [[BBC Three]] and on [[BBC HD]] in 2006 to mixed reviews but viewing figures which broke records for the digital channel. Subsequently it returned in 2008 where it aired first on [[BBC Two]], receiving a higher budget; its uneven tone, a criticism of the first series, was largely smoothed out, and the show attracted higher ratings and better reviews. The third series episodes worked on a bigger budget and transferred to the network's flagship channel, [[BBC One]] as a five episode [[serial (radio and television)|serial]], entitled ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth]]''. Despite airing in July evenings, typically a [[graveyard slot]], spread across five nights in one week, the show received unexpectedly high ratings at home and abroad and for the most part, reviews hailed it as excellent. A fourth series, co-produced by [[BBC Wales]], [[BBC Worldwide]] and US premium entertainment network [[Starz (TV channel)|Starz]] began airing on 8 July 2011 on Starz and 14 July 2011 on BBC One as ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'', and is set in both Wales and in the United States.

==Production==
===Early development===
Before the revival of ''Doctor Who'', Russell T Davies began to develop an idea for a science-fiction/crime drama in the style of American dramas like ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' and ''[[Angel (TV series)|Angel]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;buffy&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Because ''Torchwood'' is shown after the [[watershed (television)|watershed]] â that is, after 9&amp;nbsp;pm â it has more mature content than ''Doctor Who''. Davies told ''[[SFX magazine|SFX]]'': &quot;We can be a bit more visceral, more violent, and more sexual, if we want to. Though bear in mind that it's very teenage to indulge yourself in blood and gore, and ''Torchwood'' is going to be smarter than that. But itâs the essential difference between [[BBC One]] at 7&amp;nbsp;pm, and [[BBC Three]] at, say, 9 pm. That says it all â instinctively, every viewer can see the huge difference there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfx&quot;/&gt;
According to Barrowman: &quot;I don't do any nude scenes in series one; they're saving that for the next series! I don't have a problem with getting my kit off. As long as they pay me the right money, I'm ready to get out my cock and balls.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;metro2&quot;&gt;{{Cite news

Davies also joked to a [[BBC Radio Wales]] interviewer that he was &quot;not allowed&quot; to refer to the programme as &quot;''Doctor Who'' for grown-ups&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/sounds/torchwood.mp3|title=Russell T Davies talks about ''Torchwood''|publisher=BBC Radio Wales|date=17 October 2005|format=MP3|accessdate=29 March 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060114150449/http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/sounds/torchwood.mp3 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate = 14 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first series includes content rarely seen or heard in the ''Doctor Who'' franchise, including sex scenes, same-sex kissing, and use of extreme [[profanity]] in several episodes.

Due to the level of interest in the show from younger audience members, despite the adult themes, the BBC decided to craft the second series such that a &quot;child-friendly&quot; edit of the shows could go out at 7pm (pre-watershed). This had the effect that many of the more adult themes ceased to be central to the main episode plot, so they could be more easily edited out for the child-friendly edition.

The first three series of ''Torchwood'', the programme was produced in-house by [[BBC Wales]]. The Head of Drama at the time of the first series, [[Julie Gardner]], served as executive producer alongside Davies. The first two episodes of Series 1 of ''Torchwood'' premiered on 22 October 2006 on [[BBC Three]] and [[BBC HD]]. Series 2 premiered on [[BBC Two]] and BBC HD on 16 January 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;RadioTimes&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.radiotimes.com/ListingsServlet?event=10&amp;channelId=105&amp;programmeId=72170875&amp;jspLocation=/jsp/prog_details_fullpage.jsp

===Later development===
BBC Three described ''Torchwood'' as the centrepiece of its autumn 2006 schedule,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | title = BBC THREE Autumn 2006|publisher=BBC  Press Office | date =24 July 2006 | url =http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/07_july/24/bbcthree.shtml | accessdate = 17 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the successful first season led to a second series on BBC Two and a third on BBC One in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB&quot;/&gt; However, Davies expressed concern that the third series was aired in a summer evening [[graveyard slot]].&lt;ref name=graveyardslot&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/s8/torchwood/news/a252010/davies-torchwood-surprised-bbc-one.html|title=Davies: 'Torchwood surprised BBC One'|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=28 July 2010|date=28 July 2007|last=Millar|first=Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead actor John Barrowman felt that the show had been mistreated by BBC executives, despite what he felt was the programme's proven popularity and success.&lt;ref name=&quot;JB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.pinkpaper.com/NewsStory.aspx?id=1131|title=Barrowman felt &quot;punished&quot; by Torchwood axe|work=[[Pink news]]|date=30 June 2009|accessdate=28 July 2010|last=Sanders|first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series, entitled ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', began shooting on 18 August 2008, and comprised a five-episode mini-series that aired over five consecutive days at 9&amp;nbsp;pm on [[BBC One]] from 6 July 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/tv/2009/wk27/ |title=Press Office â Network TV Programme Information BBC Week 27 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 9&amp;nbsp;pm on [[BBC America HD]] and [[BBC America]] from 20 July 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbcamerica1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbcamerica.com/content/262/index.jsp |title=Torchwood: Children of Earth |publisher=BBC America |date=6 April 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell T Davies and [[Julie Gardner]] stayed on as executive producers, and [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]] produced the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/torchwood/sites/news/pages/production_news_40_seriesthree.shtml |title=Production News: Series 3 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=21 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=series3production/&gt;

In August 2009, Davies stated that the fourth series was &quot;ready to go&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Den of Geek&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=McEwan |first=Cameron K |coauthors= |title=Torchwood: Series 4 â &quot;ready to go&quot; |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/television/266944/torchwood_series_4_ready_to_go.html |date=12 June 2009 |work=Den of Geek |accessdate=13 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that he had the next series planned out, stating, &quot;I know exactly how to pick it up. I've got a shape in mind, and I've got stories. I know where you'd find Gwen and Rhys, and their baby, and Jack, and I know how you'd go forward with a new form of Torchwood.&quot; At the time, he stated he would prefer for the series four to be another mini-series, though he has no qualms about doing another thirteen-episode run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= |coauthors= |title=Russell T Davies Plans The Future Of 'Torchwood' |url=http://www.fanbolt.com/headline/5017/Russell_T_Davies_Plans_The_Future_Of_%27Torchwood%27 |date=18 August 2009 |work=FANBOLT.COM |accessdate=18 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A November 2009 article posted on Eve Myles's website stated that shooting for the fourth series was to begin in January 2011;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=uberVU â social comments |url=http://evemyles.net/2009/11/13/torchwood-series-4-in-the-works/ |title=Torchwood Series 4 âin the worksâ |publisher=EveMyles.net |date=13 November 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Davies looked to US networks to finance future series of the programme.

===Directing===
Block One of series two, consisting of episodes by Raynor and Tregenna, was directed by [[Andy Goddard]]. [[Colin Teague]] directed Block Two, which consists of [[Sleeper (Torchwood)|episode two]] by Moran and [[Meat (Torchwood)|episode four]] by Tregenna, with [[Ashley Way]] directing Block Three, consisting of [[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (Torchwood)|the series two premiere]] by Chibnall and the [[Reset (Torchwood)|sixth episode]] of the series, by JC Wilsher.&lt;ref&gt;Doctor Who Magazine 384&lt;/ref&gt; An edited repeat of the second series episodes, suitable for children to view, was shown on BBC Two at 7&amp;nbsp;pm. In 2009, [[Euros Lyn]] directed all five episodes of the third series, ''Children of Earth''.&lt;ref name=series3production/&gt;

In June 2010, a BBC News report confirmed that the fourth series would have 10 episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title= Torchwood returns with international flavour|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10262266.stm |date=8 June 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010 |work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/showbiz-and-lifestyle/showbiz/2010/07/04/torchwood-star-can-t-wait-to-start-new-series-91466-26780199/ |title=Lifestyle â Showbiz â Torchwood star canât wait to start new series |publisher=WalesOnline |date=11 August 2009 |accessdate=5 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Writing===
In an October 2005 announcement, Stuart Murphy described Torchwood as &quot;sinister and psychological...As well as being very British and modern and real.&quot; Davies further described it as &quot;a British sci-fi paranoid thriller, a cop show with a sense of humour.

For the fourth series, ''Miracle Day'', Davies secured several popular US television writers, including ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' writer [[Jane Espenson]], ''The X-Files'', [[Star Trek: Enterprise]] and ''[[Supernatural (TV series)|Supernatural]]'' writer [[John Shiban]], and ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' writer [[Doris Egan]].

In continuing the series, Davies was again inspired by ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer''. He explained that ''Torchwood'' is more focused on the [[human condition]] than its science fiction backdrop:
{{quotebox
|quote=&quot;The best metaphors in Buffy came down to, âWhatâs it like to be in high school, as a kid?â Itâs the same with ''Torchwood: Miracle Day''. Itâs about us and our decisions and our lives, and how we live with each other and how we die with each other.
That forms the core of the story.&quot;

===Crew===
[[Richard Stokes (producer)|Richard Stokes]] produced Series 1 &amp; 2 of ''Torchwood''. Originally, ''Doctor Who'' director [[James Hawes]] was lined up as producer. After directing the [[BBC Four]] drama ''[[The Chatterley Affair]]'', Hawes backed out of the project. Davies told ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' that Hawes &quot;has been having such a good time... that he's decided directing is his greatest passion, and as a result, he's stepped down.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DWM366&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickman |first=Clayton |authorlink=Clayton Hickman |coauthors=Tom Spilsbury |title=Torchwood Tales! |journal=[[Doctor Who Magazine]] |issue=366 |page=5 |publisher=[[Panini Comics]] |date=1 March 2006 cover date}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Team Torchwood&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |title=Team Torchwood |publisher=BBC  Press Office |date=24 February 2006 |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/02_february/24/torchwood.shtml |accessdate=4 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Series 3 was produced by [[Peter Bennett (producer)|Peter Bennett]]. Series 4 is produced by Kelly A Manners, with UK filming produced by Brian Minchin, producer of Series 4 and 5 of [[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]. The series also shares ''Doctor Who'''s production designer, Edward Thomas. Music for the series is composed by [[Ben Foster (orchestrator)|Ben Foster]] and ''Doctor Who''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s composer [[Murray Gold]], with composer [[Stu Kennedy]] assisting on Series 4.

===Opening sequence===
[[File:Children of Earth titles.jpg|thumb|right|The title card for the ''Torchwood'' miniseries, ''Children of Earth'' (series 3)]]
In lieu of full-length [[title sequence]], the opening sequence of the show's first two series are composed of a [[voice-over]] monologue by Barrowman as Harkness, establishing the show's premise. The show's theme tune plays over this monologue and the additional [[intertitle]]. As in ''Doctor Who'' (2005âpresent), it is written by [[Murray Gold]].

For ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', a recap of the last episode was played at the beginning of each episode, followed by a title card. The theme was not featured in this, instead only featuring over the end credits.

A new theme arrangement and opening credit sequence is introduced with Series 4 (though a musical motif or sting from the original theme is still audible in numerous scenes). Although each episode of ''Miracle Day'' carries an individual title, ''Torchwood: Miracle Day'' is the only on-screen title used.

==Overview==
The series is set in [[Cardiff]] and follows the Welsh branch of a covert agency called the Torchwood Institute which investigates extraterrestrial incidents on Earth and scavenges alien technology for its own use, its origins outlined in the ''Doctor Who'' episode &quot;[[Tooth and Claw (Doctor Who)|Tooth and Claw]]&quot;. As the opening monologue explains, the organisation is separate from the government, outside the police, and beyond the United Nations. Their public perception is as merely a 'special ops' group. The events of the first series take place some time after the ''Doctor Who'' [[Doomsday (Doctor Who)|series two finale]], in which Torchwood's London headquarters was destroyed. This format was maintained for the first two series.

Series three, a miniseries, saw the Cardiff headquarters completely destroyed and the team temporarily operating as fugitives in England's capital city of London, its membership wiped and the organisation thoroughly broken over the course of the serial. Series four, another mini-series, starts with Torchwood fully disbanded.  Jack has left Earth after the events of Series Three, and Gwen has retired to be with her family. The group is reformed (unofficially), this time operating primarily in the United States and including two fugitive ex-CIA agents framed for treason.

[[Image:Torchwood Series2 Cast.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The series two cast, including special guest star [[Freema Agyeman]] as [[Martha Jones]]]]
Unlike its parent programme, ''Torchwood'' centres on a team instead of a single character with companions. The show initially depicts a small team of alien-hunters known as Torchwood Three, based in Cardiff. The team is made up of five operatives led by [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]] ([[John Barrowman]]), formerly a [[time travel in fiction|time-travelling]] &quot;Time Agent&quot; and con man from the distant future who has lived on Earth as an immortal since the 19th century. [[Gwen Cooper]] ([[Eve Myles]]), the female lead, joins the team in the first episode; she is originally an [[audience surrogate]], but later grows into a more morally complicated character. The original cast is filled out by Torchwood medical officer [[Owen Harper]] ([[Burn Gorman]]), computer specialist [[Toshiko Sato]] ([[Naoko Mori]]), and general ''factotum''-cum-administrator [[Ianto Jones]] ([[Gareth David-Lloyd]]). Toshiko and Owen are [[kill off|killed off]] in the [[Exit Wounds (Torchwood)|second series finale]], as is Ianto in the show's third series. Recurring characters are [[Rhys Williams (Torchwood)|Rhys Williams]] ([[Kai Owen]]), Gwen's live-in boyfriend and later husband; and [[Andy Davidson (Torchwood)|Andy Davidson]] ([[Tom Price (actor)|Tom Price]]), Gwen's former police partner and occasional [[comic relief]]. Kai Owen becomes a main cast member in the programme beginning with the third series; his character is initially unaware of Gwen's activities with Torchwood, but later becomes her close confidante and the team's ally. Price appears in all four series.

&lt;!--Recurring--&gt;Prior to the programme's debut, publicity materials featured [[Indira Varma]] as [[Suzie Costello]] among the regular cast members, giving the impression that she would appear throughout the series. However, Suzie was killed off at the end of the [[Everything Changes (Torchwood)|first episode]] with Gwen taking her place on the team, Suzie reappearing only [[They Keep Killing Suzie|once more]] as an [[antagonist]]. In the first two series, [[Paul Kasey]] regularly appears under heavy prosthetics, portraying, as in ''[[Doctor Who]]'', a number of aliens on the series, such as humanoid [[Weevil (Torchwood)|Weevils]] and [[List of Torchwood monsters and aliens#Blowfish|Blowfishes]]. Other recurring characters include ''Doctor Who''{{'}}s [[Martha Jones]] ([[Freema Agyeman]])âlike Jack, a former time-traveller, and now medical officer for the militaristic alien-investigating organisation [[UNIT]]âwho crosses over into ''Torchwood'' for three episodes in series two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/news/cult/news/drwho/2007/07/02/46692.shtml|title=More Martha! |accessdate=2 July 2007 |work=BBC Doctor Who }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, [[James Marsters]] portrays [[Captain John Hart (Torchwood)|Captain John Hart]], Jack's villainous former lover and Time Agent partner.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.afterelton.com/node/6096 John Barrowman rocks the TCA house] ''AfterElton.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/07/spike-from-buff.html Spike from 'Buffy' and 'Torchwood's Captain Jack Harkness â Yowza!]'', [[Chicago Tribune]]&lt;/ref&gt; Others in the second series, recurring in a minor capacity, include a mysteriously age-immune [[List of Torchwood characters#Little Girl|little girl]] ([[Skye Bennett]]) and [[Victorian era|Victorian-era]] Torchwood member [[List of Torchwood characters#Alice Guppy|Alice Guppy]] ([[Amy Manson]]). The second series also introduces Gwen's parents, Geraint ([[William Thomas (actor)|William Thomas]]) and Mary Cooper ([[Sharon Morgan]]), who later reappear in the show's fourth series.

''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'' featured a largely new supporting cast for the duration of the five-episode serial, such as [[Permanent Secretary]] [[John Frobisher]] ([[Peter Capaldi]]), [[List of Torchwood characters#Clement McDonald|Clem McDonald]] ([[Paul Copley]]), Frobisher's personal assistant [[List of Torchwood characters#Bridget Spears|Bridget Spears]] ([[Susan Brown (actress)|Susan Brown]]), [[Brian Green (Torchwood)|Prime Minister Brian Green]] ([[Nicholas Farrell]]), ruthless operative [[List of Torchwood characters#Johnson|Agent Johnson]] ([[Liz May Brice]]), Jack's middle-aged daughter, [[Alice Carter|Alice]] ([[Lucy Cohu]]), her son [[List of Torchwood characters#Steven Carter|Steven]] (Bear McCausland) and Ianto's sister Rhiannon ([[Katy Wix]]). [[Cush Jumbo]] was cast as Frobisher's [[personal assistant]] [[List of Torchwood characters#Lois Habiba|Lois Habiba]]; Habiba was written into the story after Agyeman was unavailable to return to portray Martha.&lt;ref name=&quot;Davies 0626&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nj.com/entertainment/tv/index.ssf/2009/06/russell_t_davies_talks_doctor.html|title=Russell T Davies talks 'Doctor Who' &amp; 'Torchwood'|last=Sepinwall|first=Alan|date=26 June 2009|work=New Jersey Star Legder|accessdate=9 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Episodes===
{{Main|List of Torchwood episodes}}
The premiere episode &quot;[[Everything Changes (Torchwood)|Everything Changes]]&quot; was written by Russell T Davies and serves to introduce the main characters and roles within the series, using newcomer Gwen as the [[audience surrogate]] in a similar style to the introduction of the [[companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] characters in ''Doctor Who''. The second episode, titled &quot;[[Day One (Torchwood)|Day One]]&quot;, aired immediately after the first. It continues Gwen's neophyte role and includes a &quot;sex monster&quot; science fiction storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video

The first part, entitled &quot;[[Captain Jack Harkness]]&quot;, is a love story set in wartime Britain, with a subplot which serves to push the setting towards an apocalypse for series finale &quot;[[End of Days (Torchwood)|End of Days]]&quot;. It deals with the ramifications of diseases and persons from throughout history falling through time and across the universe to arrive in the present day, and particularly in Cardiff. The episode also sets up Jack's return in the ''Doctor Who'' episode &quot;[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]&quot;.

2008's second 13-episode series of ''Torchwood'' begins by following on with Jack's return from the previous ''Doctor Who'' episode, &quot;[[Last of the Time Lords]]&quot; with the series premiere, &quot;[[Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang (Torchwood)|Kiss Kiss, Bang Bang]]&quot;. The series introduces Jack's ex-partner [[Captain John Hart (Torchwood)|Captain John Hart]] in its premiere, reveals flashbacks to Jack's childhood in &quot;[[Adam (Torchwood)|Adam]]&quot; and shows how each member joined Torchwood in the penultimate episode &quot;[[Fragments (Torchwood)|Fragments]]&quot;. A three-episode arc (&quot;[[Reset (Torchwood)|Reset]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dead Man Walking (Torchwood)|Dead Man Walking]]&quot; and &quot;[[A Day in the Death]]&quot;) in the middle of the series guest stars ''Doctor Who'' actress [[Freema Agyeman]] as [[Martha Jones]], temporarily drafted into Torchwood. The arc focuses upon the death and partial resurrection of main character Owen Harper, and how he coped as a dead man. The second series' finale, &quot;[[Exit Wounds (Torchwood)|Exit Wounds]]&quot; (which aired 4 April 2008) features the departures of main characters Owen and Tosh, whose deaths at the hands of Jack's long-lost brother [[Gray Harkness|Gray]] reduced the series' cast to Barrowman, Myles and David-Lloyd in its closing scenes. The Torchwood Three team made a crossover appearance in the [[Doctor Who (series 4)|series four]] finale of parent show ''Doctor Who'', &quot;[[The Stolen Earth]]&quot;/&quot;[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]&quot;, which featured Jack Harkness leaving the Doctor at the close of the story, accompanied by [[Martha Jones]] and [[Mickey Smith]].

Series three is only five episodes long, and makes up a single story, ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'' (2009). David-Lloyd departs the cast when Ianto is killed by aliens. In its closing scenes, with Gwen heavily pregnant and Jack leaving Earth, Torchwood effectively no longer existed. Series four, ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day]]'' (2011), comprising ten episodes, sees Torchwood having been reduced to the status of legend following ''Children of Earth''. The narrative follows two CIA agents who encounter Torchwood's supernatural world, and later Gwen and Jack.&lt;ref name=IGNNewworld&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/111/1111045p1.html|title=Torchwood: The New World is Coming|work=[[IGN]]|date=7 August 2010|accessdate=8 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although partly set in the USA, Cardiff remains a part of the show's setting, with Gwen being Welsh and her young family based in Wales.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hibberd&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://livefeed.hollywoodreporter.com/2010/08/torchwood-gets-title-the-new-world.html|title=âTorchwoodâ gets new title: âThe New Worldâ|last=Hibberd|first=James|date=7 August 2010|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter|accessdate=10 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Torchwood HQ.jpg|thumb|left|&quot;The Hub&quot; connects [[Roald Dahl Plass]] and is underneath the [[Mermaid Quay]] shopping complex.]]

The team's headquarters during the first two series, referred to as ''the Hub'', was beneath [[Roald Dahl Plass]] in [[Cardiff Bay]] â formerly known as the Oval Basin. This is where the [[TARDIS]] landed in the ''Doctor Who'' episodes &quot;[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]&quot; and &quot;[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]&quot; to refuel, and is the location of the [[spacetime]] [[Cardiff Rift|rift]] first seen in &quot;[[The Unquiet Dead]]&quot;. The Hub itself was around three stories high, with a large column running through the middle that was an extension of the fountain above; at its base lay the rift machine. The Hub had two means of access: a lift that rose to the plass next to the fountain (camouflaged by a perception filter), and a more mundane entrance hidden in a tourism office. Production crew were keen to use everything Wales had to offer in filming the series; for example, the military base scenes in &quot;[[Sleeper (Torchwood)|Sleeper]]&quot; and the booby-trapped abandoned warehouse scenes in &quot;[[Fragments (Torchwood)|Fragments]]&quot; were filmed at [[Royal Navy Propellant Factory, Caerwent|RAF Caerwent]], near Chepstow, South Wales.

The third series opened in the traditional setting, but in the first episode the Hub was reduced to a smoking pile of rubble; the show adapted to a conventional London setting, with many scenes filmed and set at real-life British [[intelligence agency]] headquarters [[Thames House]]. For the show's fourth series, the programmed is largely filmed and set in the United States, but parts of the series are still filmed in Wales and other locations around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;International partnership secures new series of Torchwood&quot;/&gt;

===Themes===
{{Main|Themes in Torchwood}}
Torchwood explores several themes in its [[narrative]], in particular [[LGBT]] themes. Various characters are portrayed as sexually fluid; through those characters, the series examines homosexual and [[bisexuality|bisexual]] relationships. The programme also addresses issues around [[existentialism]], the nature of human life and the absence of a traditional afterlife, and the corrupting nature of power.

The Australia/New Zealand version was launched in April 2008. The magazine emulated ''[[Doctor Who Magazine]]'' in combining behind-the-scenes features with original story content in the form of a serialized comic strip and short stories; as the magazine's run progressed, the original fiction became more predominant. The magazine was discontinued in early 2011 after two-dozen issues.

''Convergence: the International Journal of Research into New Media'' commented on ''Doctor Who'' and ''Torchwood''{{'s}} foray into &quot;covergence culture&quot; as an achievement &quot;on an unprecedented scale, with the BBC currently using the series to trial a plethora of new technologies, including: mini-episodes on mobile phones, podcast commentaries, interactive red-button adventures, video blogs, companion programming, and `fake' metatextual websites.&quot;&lt;ref name=Transmedia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Perryman|first=Neil|year=2008|title= Doctor Who and the Convergence of Media, A Case Study in `Transmedia Storytelling'|journal=Convergence: the International Journal of Research into New Media Technologies|volume=14|issue=1|pages=21â39|id=10.1177/1354856507084417|doi=10.1177/1354856507084417|url=http://con.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/14/1/21|accessdate=2008-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the second series in 2008, a second interactive ''Torchwood'' online game was devised, scripted by series writer [[Phil Ford (writer)|Phil Ford]];&lt;ref name=&quot;series two game&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a88392/interactive-torchwood-adventure-launched.html|title= Interactive 'Torchwood' adventure launched|accessdate=2008-08-06 |work=DigitalSpy.com|date=31 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; this more heavily featured the actors of the series, particularly Gareth David-Lloyd, and [[Siwan Morris]] was cast as a [[pirate radio]] jockey investigating ''Torchwood''.

During the fourth season of the revival of ''Doctor Who'', a crossover webcast production called ''Captain Jack's Monster Files'' was launched, featuring Barrowman, in character as Jack, hosting a series of shorts profiling various monsters and aliens featured on ''Doctor Who''. These segments, posted to the BBC's official ''Doctor Who'' website, included specially shot footage of Jack in the Hub. After Season 4, the segments were produced less frequently, with the last featuring Jack, released in December 2009, taking the form of Jack narrating a mini-episode featuring the [[Weeping Angels]] entitled &quot;A Ghost Story for Christmas&quot;. Subsequent ''Monster Files'' webcasts released since 2010 have been hosted by ''Doctor Who'' co-star [[Alex Kingston]] as her character, [[River Song (Doctor Who)|River Song]]. As with most other online video content from the BBC, ''Captain Jack's Monster Files'' are not viewable outside the UK and to date (2011) have never been included on a DVD or Blu-ray release of either ''Doctor Who'' or ''Torchwood''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/s4/episodes/S4_01?episode=S4_01&amp;character=&amp;action=videostream&amp;playlist=/doctorwho/playlists/s4_01/video/s4_01_v_01.xml&amp;video=1&amp;date=&amp;summary=Captain%20Jack%20reveals%20facts,%20figures%20and%20top%20secret%20info%20about%20the%20Adipose.&amp;info=&amp;info2=&amp;info3=&amp;tag_file_id=s4_01_v_01 Link to the first instalment of Monster Files] on the official Doctor Who website (viewable only in the UK).&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Torchwood Archives'' by Gary Russell collects much of this online literature for the first two series in hardback form, including the Captain's Blog section of the BBC America ''Torchwood'' website.&lt;ref name=&quot;TWArchives&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Russell|first=Gary|authorlink=Gary Russell|title=The Torchwood Archives|year=2008|month=October|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=9781846074592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To promote its rebroadcasts of ''Torchwood'', the UK digital channel [[Watch (TV channel)|Watch]] has twice commissioned the creative team of the ''Torchwood Magazine'' comic strip to produce brief online-exclusive comic strip stories for the Watch website. The first of these, ''The Return of the Vostok'', was uploaded in February 2009, with a follow-up, ''Ma and Par'', appearing in February 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=24801 Watch and Titan Team Up for Exclusive Torchwood Online Comic], Comic Book Resources.com, 10 February 2010; accessed 6 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tying in with the launch of ''Torchwood: Miracle Day'', Starz is producing a 2011 ''Torchwood'' webseries entitled ''[[Torchwood: Web of Lies]]'', which will star American actress [[Eliza Dushku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s8/torchwood/news/a320030/eliza-dushku-to-star-in-torchwood-spinoff.html|title=Eliza Dushku to star in 'Torchwood' spinoff?|date=17 May 2011|accessdate=18 May 2011|work=Digital Spy|last=Jefferey|first=Morgan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio plays===
Set between the end of Series Two and the beginning of Series Three, the BBC aired four Torchwood radio dramas featuring the cast of the series. As a tie in with [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]]'s [[CERN]]-themed day on 10 September 2008, a CERN-themed radio episode of Torchwood written by [[Joseph Lidster]], entitled &quot;[[Lost Souls (Torchwood)|Lost Souls]]&quot;, aired as the day's [[The Afternoon Play (BBC)|Afternoon Play]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/08_august/07/cern.shtml |title=Radio 4 has exclusive access to CERN'S Big Bang experiment |accessdate=8 August 2008 |date=7 August 2008 |work=BBC Press Releases }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the first Torchwood drama not to feature Burn Gorman and Naoko Mori.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallifreyone.com/cgi-bin/viewnews.cgi?id=EkpAkZFFkZpKezjobI&amp;tmpl=newsrss&amp;style=feedstyle |title=Torchwood comes to Radio 4 |accessdate=27 April 2008 |author=Jarrod Cooper |date=26 April 2008 |work=The Doctor Who News Page }}&lt;/ref&gt; Three further episodes were broadcast on 1â3&amp;nbsp;July 2009: &quot;[[Asylum (Torchwood)|Asylum]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Novels and audiobooks===
{{Main|List of Torchwood novels and audio books}}
Accompanying the main series of ''Torchwood'' are a series of novels. The books are published in paperback-sized hardcover format, the same format BBC Books uses for its [[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|New Series Adventures]] line for ''Doctor Who''. These novels were later released, abridged, as audiobooks. Several audio-exclusive readings have also been produced. To date all of the core cast members have narrated at least one abridged or audio-exclusive reading.

===Original soundtrack===

===Critical reception===
As a spin-off of long-running British cultural artefact ''Doctor Who'', ''Torchwood''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s launch into British popular culture has received many positive and negative reviews, commentary and parody following the hype of its inception, especially regarding its status as an &quot;adult&quot; ''Doctor Who'' spin-off as well as its characterisation and portrayal of sex. Reviews for the first series were largely negative, with sites such as [[Behind the Sofa]] giving many more negative reviews than positive ones. Reviews of the second series were more positive. The third series, which took the form of a five-part story arc with the blanket title of ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', received a number of positive reviews. Critics described it separately as a &quot;powerful human drama&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/cult/a164598/torchwoods-final-and-finest-hour.html|title=Torchwood's Final and Finest Hour|accessdate=13 August 2009|author=Ben Rawson-Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Best.

Its highest scores were a 100 from ''[[TV Guide]]'' and a 91 from ''TIME''; the lowest was a 60 from ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/shows/torchwoodseason3|title=Torchwood: Children of Earth series three reviews|accessdate=26 July 2009|work=Metacritic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A plot point in ''Children of Earth'' triggered protests from fans of the show, among them the &quot;Save Ianto Jones&quot; campaign, which collected more than 10,000 pounds for the British [[Children in Need]] annual charity event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saveiantojones.com/ |title=Save Ianto Jones |publisher=Save Ianto Jones |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other fans resorted to abuse and threats, causing writer James Moran to fire off an angry missive in a blog post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Moran |first=James |url=http://jamesmoran.blogspot.com/2009/07/stepping-back.html |title=The Pen Is Mightier Than the Sword |publisher=Jamesmoran.blogspot.com |date=12 July 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Showrunner Russell T Davies made no apologies for the decision to kill off the character, saying, &quot;Iâm just delighted that the fans are so wrapped in the character to have that reaction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jensen |first=Michael |url=http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2009/7/russeltdavies |title=&quot;Torchwood&quot;'s Russell T Davies Makes No Apologies â For Anything |publisher=Afterelton.com |date=31 July 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plot point attracted more controversy from some commentators, additionally, because it depicted the death of a main character involved in a same-sex relationship. This led several writers to analyse the death in view of the character's earlier refusal to admit to his relationship with a man, and claimed that the death was a sign that the [[LGBT]] community was leaving behind its image of victimhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skibinskaya |first=Polina |url=http://www.afterelton.com/TV/2009/10/death-torchwood-queer-visibility |title=Death By &quot;Torchwood&quot;: Captain Jack, Ianto Jones, And The Rise Of The Queer Superhero |publisher=Afterelton.com |date=28 October 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{further|[[Ianto Jones#Fan reaction to death|Fan reaction to Ianto Jones' death]]}}

Positive and negative attention has been given to the portrayal of same-sex relationships in ''Torchwood''. Maria Boyd of the [[University of Texas at Austin]] published her paper at a conference, &quot;Gay Sex and Aliens! How the Press frames Russell T Daviesâ ''Torchwood''.&quot; She argues through &quot;a discourse analysis of 109 reviews of the Season 1 and Season 2 premiere episodes&quot; how &quot;TV critics are more concerned with the depictions of bisexuality among the principal characters on ''Torchwood''.&quot; Furthermore, she argues that the show's reviews &quot;highlight the same-sex interactions depicted on the show utilising sensationalist, assimilationist, or condemnatory language&quot; and that the &quot;hegemonic, heterosexist language used by TV critics covering ''Torchwood'' has framed the program in such a way that it limits audienceâs ability to make meaning of the text themselves.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.pacificu.edu/gspconference/program/Saturday/11/|title=Session Three: Panel 6 â Love, Sexuality and Popular Culture|date=17 October 2009|publisher=[[Pacific University]]|last=Boyd|first=Maria}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parodies===

Although fewer in number than [[Doctor Who spoofs|''Doctor Who'' spoofs]], there have been a number of [[parody|parodies]] of ''Torchwood'' in various media. [[Verity Stob]], a technology columnist for online newspaper ''[[The Register]]'', wrote a parody of ''Torchwood'' called ''Under Torch Wood''. The piece is in the style of ''[[Under Milk Wood]]'', a [[Dylan Thomas]] radio play. The piece comments on the level of swearing present in ''Torchwood'' and the role of [[Rhys Williams (Torchwood)|Rhys Williams]], whom the piece describes as &quot;Barry [[Backstory]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In its third series, the ''Doctor Who'' parody ''[[Nebulous]]'' also began to parody ''Torchwood'', with references to &quot;baby dinosaurs falling through a hole in time&quot; and &quot;the sheer amount of paranormal activity in the Cardiff area alone ... starting to threaten the Earth's plausibility shield&quot;.

Satirical [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionist]] television series ''[[Dead Ringers (comedy)|Dead Ringers]]'' also parodied ''Torchwood'', with [[Jon Culshaw]] playing Captain Jack and [[Jan Ravens]] as Gwen Cooper. The sketches parodied the level of sex in ''Torchwood'', claiming &quot;we never deal with an alien unless at least one [of the team] has shagged it&quot;, and describing the lack of [[motivation]]s of the characters. It also parodies the bisexuality of the characters and the melodramatic personality of Jack, who in the sketch walks extremely dramatically, swinging his coat about himself. Barrowman is described as a &quot;[[Variety store|pound shop]] [[Tom Cruise]]&quot;, and reference is made to the perceived low-budget of the show, with Owen describing the ''Torchwood'' equipment as &quot;an [[Apple Mac]] with stickers on the case&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later spoofs in the final episode of the 2007 series of ''Dead Ringers'' featured Jack Harkness in  a [[threesome]] with two ''[[Attack of the Cybermen]]''-era [[Cybermen]], and an elderly version called ''Driftwood'', which claims to be &quot;separate from the [[Post Office]], beyond the [[Bingo (UK)|bingo]] hall and outside the [[Oxfam]]&quot;, a parody of ''Torchwood's'' opening narration. It also featured Albert Steptoe of ''[[Steptoe and Son]]'' as the leader of the team, claiming &quot;a terrible event in my past means that I can't die. It's called [[GOLD (TV channel)|UKTV Gold]]&quot;, and parodied its use of amnesia pills (unnecessary for this team due to the onset of senile amnesia).

===Ratings===
The first episodes of Torchwood on BBC Three gave the channel its highest-ever ratings and the highest ratings of any [[digital television|digital-only]] non-sports channel at the time with 2.519&amp;nbsp;million viewers (though this has since been surpassed by ''[[Bionic Woman (2007 TV series)|Bionic Woman]]'' on [[ITV2]], which gained 2.553&amp;nbsp;million in March 2008&lt;ref name=&quot;barb&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?report=weeklytop30&amp;requesttimeout=500&amp;flag=viewingsummary |title=BARB |publisher=BARB |date=6 June 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The audience share was 12.7%, increasing to 13.8% for the second episode (shown immediately after the first episode on the same day), despite viewership dropping to 2.498&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Torchwood scores record audience|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6077078.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=23 October 2006|accessdate = 23 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ratings for later episodes dropped to around 1.1 to 1.2&amp;nbsp;million viewers during the first showing on BBC Three (the lowest being 0.8&amp;nbsp;million for week ending 24 December 2006), but nevertheless, the show remained the most-viewed programme on BBC Three by a wide margin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&amp;report=weeklytop30 Weekly Multichannel Top 10 progammes], ''[[BARB]]''. Retrieved 7 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Viewing figures for the repeat screenings on BBC Two later the same week were around 2.2 to 2.3&amp;nbsp;million (dropping to under 1.1 and 1.8 respectively for the weeks ending 03/12/06 and 10/12/06).

For its second series, which began in January 2008, Torchwood was moved to the more established channel [[BBC Two]]. Again, initial ratings were respectable, and the first episode garnered 4.22&amp;nbsp;million viewers. However, the series again began to decline and had lost a million viewers by its fourth episode. It dropped to a low of 2.52&amp;nbsp;million viewers towards the end of its run,&lt;ref name=&quot;barb&quot; /&gt;  even after the BBC had moved it from its usual Wednesday-night slot (where it was being consistently beaten by [[ITV]]'s programming and [[Channel 4]]'s number-one series, ''[[Grand Designs]]'') to Friday nights. The second series had an overall average rating of 3.26&amp;nbsp;million viewers on BBC Two.

Torchwood's five part third season, entitled ''[[Torchwood: Children of Earth|Children of Earth]]'', premiered on [[BBC One]] in July 2009, with an estimated 5.9&amp;nbsp;million viewers, according to overnight figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a163877/59m-tune-in-for-new-torchwood.html Digital Spy â 5.9m tune in for new 'Torchwood'], digitalspy.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings for the second episode dropped to 5.58m,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a164095/jackson-memorial-seen-by-63-million.html Digital Spy â Jackson memorial seen by 6.3&amp;nbsp;million], digitalspy.co.cuk&lt;/ref&gt; but rose to a high of 6.24m for the fourth episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rogers |first=Jon |url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/ratings/torchwood-hits-new-heights/5003460.article |title=Torchwood hits new heights |publisher=Broadcastnow.co.uk |date=10 July 2009 |accessdate=20 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the overnight figures, the mini-series garnered an average rating of 5.88&amp;nbsp;million viewers. According to official figures, published by [[Broadcasters' Audience Research Board]] (BARB), all five episodes of the mini-series garnered more than 6&amp;nbsp;million viewers, with the fourth episode gaining the largest audience.

The first episode of series four, ''[[Torchwood: Miracle Day|Miracle Day]]'', attracted a consolidated audience of 6.59 million, which was slightly higher than the figure for the opening episode of the previous series, as well as an AI rating of 85 out of 100, considered &quot;excellent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/07/dwn250711133012-torchwood-episode-1.html|title=Torchwood: Episode 1 Final ratings|publisher=[[Doctor Who News]]|first=Marcus|date=25 July 2011|accessdate=2011-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, viewing figures steadily declined as the season continued, dropping to a low of 4.48 for the seventh episode, though figures picked up slightly with 4.85 million viewers for the final episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/09/dwn160911124812-blood-line-overnight.html|title=The Blood Line : Overnight Viewing Figures|publisher=[[Doctor Who News]]|first=Marcus|date=16 Septembner 2011|accessdate=2011-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===
In April 2007, ''Torchwood'' beat its parent series, which is also made in Wales, to win the Best Drama Series category at the [[BAFTA Cymru]] Awards. The awards, given by the Welsh branch of the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts]], celebrate the achievements of film and television productions made in Wales. [[Eve Myles]] won the Best Actress category at the same awards, ahead of ''Doctor Who'''s [[Billie Piper]].&lt;ref name=&quot;cymru&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/6604115.stm|title=Dr Who sweeps Bafta Cymru board|publisher=BBC News |date=29 April 2007|accessdate=29 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the episode &quot;[[Captain Jack Harkness]]&quot; was nominated for the [[Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation, Short Form]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Denv&quot;&gt;{{cite web
