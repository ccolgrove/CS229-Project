==History==
{{Main|History of University of Santo Tomas}}
{{See also|Santo Tomas Internment Camp}}
{{See also|UST Quadricentennial Celebration}}

The foundation of the University is ascribed to [[Miguel de Benavides]]&lt;!-- The University library uses Benavides, obviously, with a letter S.--&gt;, O.P., the third Archbishop of Manila. He came to the Philippines with the first [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] mission in 1587. He went on to become bishop of Nueva Segovia, and was promoted archbishop of Manila in 1601. Upon his death in July 1605, Benavides bequeathed his library and personal property worth 1,500 pesos to be used as the seed fund for the establishment of an institution of higher learning. Fr. Bernardo de Santa Catalina carried out Benavidesâ wishes and was able to secure a building near the Dominican church and convent in [[Intramuros]] for the College.

In 1609, permission to open the College was requested from King [[Philip III of Spain]], which only reached Manila in 1611. On April 28, 1611, notary Juan Illian witnessed the signing of the act of foundation by Baltazar Fort, OP, Bernardo Navarro, OP, and Francisco Minayo, OP. Fort, appointed that year to the post of Father Provincial, was its first Rector.&lt;ref&gt;De Ramos, N.V., 2000.  ''I Walked with Twelve UST Rectors''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The '''Colegio de Nuestra SeÃ±ora del SantÃ­simo Rosario''' was established on April 28, 1611, from the Benavides's library. Later renamed '''Colegio de Santo TomÃ¡s''', it was elevated by [[Pope Innocent X]] to a university on November 20, 1645 in his brief, ''In Supreminenti''.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/geninfo/history.asp  History of UST] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph]. Retrieved August 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; This made the university the second royal and pontifical institution in the Philippines, after the Jesuit's Universidad de San Ignacio which was founded in 1590 but closed in 1768 following the expulsion of the [[Society of Jesus]] from the Philippines.

Its complete name is '''The Pontifical and Royal University of Santo Tomas, The Catholic University of the Philippines''' ({{lang-es|A La Real y Pontificia Universidad de Santo Tomas de Aquino Universidad CatÃ³lica de Filipinas}}).&lt;ref&gt;UST Museum of Arts and Sciences - University Rector's academic insignias&lt;/ref&gt; It was given the title &quot;Royal&quot; by King [[Charles III of Spain]] on 1785; &quot;[[Pontifical university|Pontifical]]&quot; by [[Pope Leo XIII]] on 1902 in his constitution, ''Quae Mari Sinico'', and the appellative &quot;The Catholic University of the Philippines&quot; by [[Pope Pius XII]] in 1947.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/geninfo/history.asp  History of UST] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph]. Retrieved October 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The university was located within the walled city of [[Intramuros]] in [[Manila]]. It was started by the Spanish [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Manila|Archbishop of Manila]] in the early 17th century as a [[seminary]] for aspiring young priests, taking its name and inspiration from Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]], a Dominican theologian. The first courses offered by the Colegio de Santo TomÃ¡s were canon law, theology, philosophy, logic, grammar, the arts, and civil law. In 1871, it began offering degrees in Medicine and Pharmacy, the first in colonized Asia.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

At the beginning of the 20th century, with the growing student population, the Dominicans bought land at the Sulucan Hills in [[Sampaloc, Manila]] and built its 215,000 square meter campus there in 1927 with the inauguration of its Main Building. Also that year, it began accepting female enrollees.  In the last four decades, the university grew into a full-fledged institution of higher learning, conferring degrees in law, medicine and various academic letters. The university has graduated Philippine national heroes, presidents, and even saints.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

During World War II, the [[Imperial Japan|Japanese]] converted [[Santo Tomas Internment Camp|the campus into an internment camp]] for enemy aliens, mostly Americans, living in the Philippines.   More than 4,000 foreigners survived under difficult conditions in the internment camp for 37 months from January 1942 until February 1945 when the camp was liberated by American soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnac.org/emilscott/santotomas01.htm Victims of Circumstance: Santo Tomas Internment Camp]. Accessed September 11, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Since its establishment in 1611, the University's academic life was interrupted only twice: from 1898 to 1899, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, and from 1942 to 1945, during the Japanese occupation of the country.  In its long history, the university has been under the leadership of more than 90 Rectors. UST's first Filipino rector was Fr. [[Leonardo Legaspi]], O.P. who served UST from 1971 to 1977. Its current rector is Fr. Rolando V. de la Rosa, O.P.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

In recognition of its achievements, a number of important dignitaries have officially visited the university, among them, during the last three decades: His Holiness [[Pope Paul VI]] on 28 November 1970; His Majesty King [[Juan Carlos I of Spain]] in 1974 and 1995; [[Mother Teresa]] of Calcutta in January 1977 and again in November 1984; [[Pope John Paul II]] on 18 February 1981 and 13 January 1995 (as part of the [[World Youth Day 1995]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

On the 2007â2008 academic year, UST had 37,776 students enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/university/306-ust-enrollment-upsurges.html |title=UST enrollment upsurges |work=UST.edu.ph |accessdate=2010-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The University seal==
The seal of the University of Santo Tomas is a shield quartered by the Dominican Cross. Superimposed on the cross is the sun of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], patron of Catholic schools, after whom the university is named. The sun is actually made similar to the [[Sun of May]].

Encircling the Dominican cross are:
* On the upper left is the [[papal tiara]], indicating that the UST is a [[pontifical university]].
* The upper right shows the lion derived from the [[Coat of Arms of Spain|seal of Spain]], indicative of royal patronage throughout the greater part of the university's centuries-old existence.
* The lower left is occupied by the sea lion taken from the seal of the City of Manila, the national capital, symbolizing the Republic of the Philippines.
* The rose on the lower right is a symbol of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Blessed Virgin Mary]] under whose patronage the university was placed from its very beginnings.

The symbols are rendered in gold (except for the Dominican cross which is black and white), and are set on a field of light blue, the Marian color.&lt;ref&gt;University of Santo Tomas Student Handbook, 2002 edition&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tongues of Fire''' is the official logo for the Quadricentennial celebration of the university.  This logo features the outline of the UST Main Building Tower as a concrete symbol of the stability, integrity and 400 years of existence of the university. From the cross of the Main Building emanate four tongues of fire that spell out '''U''', '''S''', and '''T'''. The tongues of fire reference the future of the university, some ideals, and are reminiscent of the stripes of the Tiger, the school's mascot. The Quadricentennial logo was designed by Dopy Doplon, a Thomasian.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=439&amp;Itemid=104 Tongues of Fire].

The University sits on an almost perfect square of 21.5 hectares bounded by [[EspaÃ±a Boulevard]], P.Noval, A.H. Lacson and Dapitan St, in [[Sampaloc, Manila]]. The University transferred to its present campus in 1927 when the Dominicans deemed the [[Intramuros]] Campus Inadequate for the University's growing population. The First Structures in the campus were the imposing Main Building, the Santisimo Rosario Parish, the UST Gym (once the largest gym in the country), and the [[Arch of the Centuries]].

The Campus, at present boasts a mixture of old and new architecture with the inclusion of the UST Multi-Deck carpark which houses the [[University of Santo Tomas Alfredo M. Velayo College of Accountancy|Alfredo M. Velayo College of Accountancy]], and the proposed UST Sports Complex, the 2nd Modern Sports facility to be constructed by a [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines|UAAP]] member school.

Other new structures include the Beato Angelico Building which houses the [[University of Santo Tomas College of Architecture|College of Architecture]] and [[University of Santo Tomas College of Fine Arts and Design|College of Fine Arts and Design]], the Plaza Mayor, the UST Quadricentennial Square and Alumni Park, Thomas Aquinas Research Complex and the UST Tan Yan Kee Student Center.

The UST Manila campus was declared a ''National Historical Landmark'' by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] on 24 May 2011. Four of the University's structures are also declared ''National Cultural Treasures'' by the National Museum: Main Building, Arch of the Centuries, Santissimo Rosario Central Seminary, as well as the Grandstand and its open spaces. UST is the first and only university campus to have been named a National Historical Landmark and the only learning institution in the Philippines as location of National Cultural Treasures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://varsitarian.net/breaking_news/20110811/ust_dineklarang_national_historical_landmark |title=UST, dineklarang 'national historical landmark' |author=Madrid, R.D. |date=August 11, 2011. |work=[[The Varsitarian]] |accessdate=August 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
&lt;!--  Commented out: [[Image:Arch of the Centuries.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The [[Arch of the Centuries]]]]--&gt;
Aside from the basic and major subjects, all undergraduate students are required to take 15 units (tuition-free) of [[Theology]] classes. The students are also required to attend 4 physical education classes, and a choice from among ROTC, civil welfare training service, and literacy training service.

===Basic education===
The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Elementary School|UST Elementary School]]''' used to offer primary education for children in the [[K-12]] levels,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/index.php/faculty/260-elementary-school.html UST.edu.ph - Elementary]&lt;/ref&gt; but before the Quadricentennial Celebration of the University, the school started denying applications from the K-Level, until the last batch of Grade 6 students who would graduate on AY 2010-2011 are left. The UST Elementary School, after finishing the last batch of its students in the UST Sampaloc Campus, will be transferred to the new UST Campus in [[Santa Rosa City]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]].

UST has two secondary institutions: The '''[[University of Santo Tomas High School|UST High School]]''' and the '''[[University of Santo Tomas Education High School|UST Education High School]]''' which serves as a laboratory for the College of Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://usths.ust.edu.ph UST High School] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph].

All students of these institutions undergo Citizenship Advancement Training, while the students from first to third year level of the [[UST High School]] undergo scouting under the [[Boy Scouts of the Philippines]] for the boys and the [[Girl Scouts of the Philippines]] for the girls.  The scouting program aims to instill nationalism and discipline among the students while the Citizenship Advancement Training aims to introduce students to the National Service Training Program that college students undergo.

===Undergraduate studies===
The different faculties, colleges and institutes of the University were created at different times in the University's history. The &quot;Faculties&quot; were founded before the American occupation of the early 20th century, while the &quot;Colleges&quot; were founded during and after American rule. The &quot;Institutes&quot;  and &quot;Departments&quot; are found within their mother faculties/colleges. Some Institutes that attained enough enrollment were separated from their mother faculties/colleges and were made into colleges in their own right.

====Faculties====
The degree programs for undergraduate studies were first offered in 1611, where the '''Faculties of Sacred Theology and Philosophy''' were founded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/departments/acaddepts_detail.asp?id=11STHEO Faculty of Sacred Theology] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph].

Retrieved August 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; These three original faculties are now known as the '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculties of Ecclesiastical Studies|Ecclesiastical Faculties]]''', to distinguish them from the '''Secular Faculties and Colleges''' that were founded later. The Eccesiastical Faculties are housed at the Seminary and at the Santisimo Rosario Parish.

The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery|Faculty of Medicine &amp; Surgery]]''' together with the '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]''' were founded on the same year in 1871. The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]''' offers [[Bachelor of Science]] degrees in [[Biochemistry]], [[Medical Technology]], and [[Pharmacy]]. The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery|Faculty of Medicine &amp; Surgery]]''' is located at the St. [[Martin de Porres]] building, while the '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Pharmacy|Faculty of Pharmacy]]''' is located at the Main Building.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/departments/acaddepts_detail.asp?id=06PHARM Faculty of Pharmacy] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph]. Retrieved August 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Arts and Letters|Faculty of Philosophy and Letters]]''' was founded in 1896. It was merged with some programs of the '''College of Liberal Arts''' in 1965 hence renaming the Faculty of Philosophy and Letters as the '''Faculty of Arts and Letters''' (the College of Liberal Arts was renamed the College of Science).  The Faculty of Arts and Letters offers the Bachelor of Arts (AB) degrees, in  Asian Studies, Behavioral Science, Communication Arts, Economics, Journalism, Legal Management, Literature, Philosophy, Political Science, and Sociology. The Faculty of Arts and Letters is located in the St. [[Raymond de PeÃ±afort]] building. Its students are known as &quot;Artlets&quot; (previously &quot;Philets&quot;). The departments of Literature and Philosophy are Centers of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/departments/acaddepts_detail.asp?id=03ARTS-LET Faculty of Arts and Letters] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph].

===Postgraduate studies===
As early as the 17th century post-graduate programs have been offered in the University of Santo Tomas through its various Faculties and Colleges.

====Faculty of Civil Law====
The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|UST Faculty of Civil Law]]''' was the first secular faculty, and hence the oldest law school in the Philippines. Although the Faculty offers the [[Bachelor of Laws]] degree, it is considered as a post baccalaureate degree, as it requires applicants to either have a [[Bachelor of Arts]] or [[Bachelor of Science]] degree. Civil Law resides in the UST Main Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faculty of Civil Law&quot;&gt;[http://www.ust.edu.ph/sitelinks/insideust/departments/acaddepts_detail.asp?id=15LAW Faculty of Civil Law] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph]. Retrieved August 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty of Civil Law has produced four Philippine Presidents and six Chief Justices of the Philippines. It also has a Legal Aid clinic named after one of its illustrious alumni, Chief Justice [[Roberto Concepcion]].

Aspiring law students need to finish at least a bachelor's degree before being admitted to the Faculty. They must then maintain an average of at least 78 in their freshman year to be readmitted the succeeding year. The required minimum grade increases as the year level progresses (79 for the second year, 80 for the third year and 81 for fourth year). During the third year of stay in the Faculty and after finishing all the law subjects, the student is required to engage in an internship program of at least 200 hours before being admitted to the fourth year, wherein he will then be required to undergo an oral examination or ''revalida'' and at least two major examinations to be able to complete the whole program. Upon graduation, the student will be qualified to become a bar candidate that will be eligible to take the bar examinations in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=&quot;Faculty of Civil Law&quot;/&gt;

The [[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law|Faculty]] is one of the top performing schools in the history of the Philippine bar examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Data of Bar Examination Passing Rates, Office of the Bar Confidant, Supreme Court of the Philippines, 2000-2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It has produced four Philippine Presidents, three Philippine Vice Presidents, six Supreme Court Chief Justices, and several law deans in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Faculty and alumni list, University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Civil Law, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Faculty of Medicine and Surgery====
The '''[[University of Santo Tomas Faculty of Medicine and Surgery|UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery]]''' was founded in 1871. Medicine and Surgery offers the Doctor of Medicine degree which is a post baccalaureate degree.

The national hero of the Philippines, [[JosÃ© Rizal]], studied here before moving to [[Complutense University of Madrid|Madrid Central University]] to complete his studies. Graduates of the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery rank among the top scorers in the medical licensure exams, and the Faculty boasts a high passing rate overall.

In 2001, the Faculty adopted the [[problem-based learning]] method for use in the curriculum. This was highly controversial, as many professors complained that students were not learning the basic sciences adequately.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.varsitarian.com/archivedetail.asp?ArticleID=74022217&amp;Sections=News Med students now approve PBL] [[The Varsitarian]]. Vol. LXXIV, No. 2 â¢ July 10, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, in 2003 the curriculum was changed again, this time to an innovate format which combined elements of both traditional (lecture-based) and problem-based methods.

The Faculty is known for giving its fourth-year students a series of written and oral exams known as the &quot;revalida&quot;. In the oral exams, groups of three students each are questioned by panels composed of three professors on basic, clinical, and emergency medical sciences. Passing the revalida is a prerequisite to graduation.

The Faculty is a Center of Excellence.&lt;ref&gt;List of Centers of Excellence and Centers of Development, Commission on Higher Education (CHED), Republic of the Philippines, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been consistently producing topnotchers in the annual national licensure exams for Filipino physicians and it is proud of its Level 4 National Accreditation for several years.&lt;ref&gt;Statistical Data of Board Examination Passing Rates, Physician Licensure Examinations, Professional Regulation Commission, 1997-2006.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also the [[alma mater]] of numerous Secretaries of Health of the Philippines,&lt;ref&gt;History, Department of Health (DOH), Republic of the Philippines, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as several Presidents of the Philippine Medical Association, the national organization of medical doctors in the country.&lt;ref&gt;History, Philippine Medical Association, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Faculty was also ranked as the only Asian medical school to be in the top 10 list of foreign medical institutions by the U.S. Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates in 2007.

====Graduate School====
As early as the 17th century postgraduate degrees were offered and granted by the various faculties in the University.

In 1938, the '''[[University of Santo Tomas Graduate School|UST Graduate School]]''' was established to administer and coordinate all the graduate programs in the University. The Graduate School academic programs have grown to 90 course offerings, spanning about seven clusters of disciplines.

Today, the UST Graduate School is recognized as a Center of Excellence in several fields of the Arts and Humanities, Allied Health Sciences, Natural Sciences, and Engineering by the Commission on Higher Education.&lt;ref&gt;[http://graduateschool.ust.edu.ph Graduate School] [http://www.ust.edu.ph UST.edu.ph].
