'''Borg Massif''' is a spectacular [[mountain massif]], about {{convert|30|mi}} long and with summits above {{convert|2700|m}}, situated along the northwest side of the [[Penck Trough]] in [[Queen Maud Land]], [[East Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=gnis&gt;{{GNIS|1692|type=antarid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tallest peak, at {{convert|2727|m}}, is [[Hogsaetet Mountain]]. The parallel, ice-filled [[Raudberg Valley]] and [[Frostlendet Valley]] trend northeastward through the massif, dividing its summits into three rough groups:
# Located at the northern end of the Borg Massif is the summit of [[Borg Mountain]], a large, flattish, ice-topped mountain with many exposed rock cliffs.
# Located at the northeastern end of the Borg Massif is the summit of [[Ytstenut Peak]]. The name &quot;Ytstenut&quot; means &quot;outermost peak&quot; in the Norwegian language.
# Located at the southern end of the Borg Massif is the summit of [[Hogfonna Mountain]]. The name &quot;Hogfonna&quot; means &quot;the high snowfield&quot; in the Norwegian language.

==Discovery and naming==
The feature was photographed from the air by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â1939), led by Captain [[Alfred Ritscher]], but was not correctly shown on the maps by the expedition. It was mapped in detail by [[Norway|Norwegian]] cartographers from surveys and air photos by the [[NorwegianâBritishâSwedish Antarctic Expedition]] (1949â1952), led by [[John Schjelderup GiÃ¦ver]]. It was remapped by air photos taken by the [[Sixth Norwegian Antarctic Expedition]] (1958â1959). They named it &quot;Borgmassivet&quot; (the castle massif) in association with [[Borg Mountain]], its most prominent feature.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnis&quot;/&gt;
