'''CounterSpy''' is a proprietary [[spyware]] removal program for [[Microsoft Windows]] software developed by [[Sunbelt Software]].

==Features==
CounterSpy scans a [[Personal computer|PC]] for spyware, examining files on the [[hard drive]], objects in memory, the [[Windows registry]] and [[HTTP cookies|cookies]] and it has a capability called DNR (Do Not Resuscitate) that, according to Sunbelt, improves the chances of killing off resuscitators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/article/0,aid,121411,pg,1,00.asp Spyware Stoppers Still Improving]&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, the tool was based on and used [[GIANT AntiSpyware]]'s engine.
