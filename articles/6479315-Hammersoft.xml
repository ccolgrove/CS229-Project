'''Shakira Isabel Mebarak Ripoll''' (born February 2, 1977),&lt;ref name=&quot;Origin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/4406486.stm |title=Shakira proud of Arab background |date=November 4, 2005 |work=BBC News    |accessdate=February 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; known professionally as '''Shakira''' ({{pron-en|ÊÉËkÉªÉrÉ}}, {{IPA-es|ÊaËkiÉ¾a|lang}}),&lt;ref&gt;See [http://inogolo.com/pronunciation/d1107/Shakira Inogolo: pronunciation of Shakira]&lt;/ref&gt; is a Colombian singer-songwriter who emerged in the music scene of [[Colombia]] and Latin America in the early 1990s. Born and raised in [[Barranquilla]], Colombia, Shakira began performing in school, demonstrating her vocal ability with [[rock and roll]], [[Latin music|Latin]] and [[Arabic music|Arabic]] influences with her own original twist on [[belly dancing]]. Shakira is a native Spanish speaker and also speaks fluent English and Portuguese as well as some Italian, French, Catalan and Arabic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BwfJhEb05aE Entrevista em portuguÃªs com Shakira!

After commercial flops with local producers on her first two albums, and being little-known outside Colombia, Shakira decided to produce her own brand of music. In 1995 she released ''[[Pies Descalzos]]'', which brought her great fame in Latin America and Spain, and her 1998 album ''[[Â¿DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n los Ladrones?]]'' was a critical success selling over 10 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ticket4-you1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ticket4-you.com/acatalog/Shakira.html |title=Shakira Tickets, Wembley Arena |publisher=Ticket4-you.com |accessdate=May 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2001, aided by the worldwide success of her first English single &quot;[[Whenever, Wherever]]&quot; that became the best selling single of 2002, she broke through into the English-speaking world with the release of ''[[Laundry Service]]'', which sold over 13 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmi.com/musicworld/entry/535199 |title=Shakiraâs songs are the heart of her success |publisher=Bmi.com |date=2007-07-30 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four years later, Shakira released two album projects called ''[[FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1]]'' and ''[[Oral Fixation Vol. 2]]''. Both reinforced her success, particularly with the best selling song of the 2000s, &quot;[[Hips Don't Lie]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=dominate&gt;{{cite web|author=Andrew Winistorfer |url=http://www.prefixmag.com/news/shakira-and-britney-dominate-list-of-the-20-best-s/32422/ |title=Shakira and Britney Dominate List of the 20 Best-Selling Singles of Last 10 Years |publisher=Prefixmag.com |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1995, Shakira founded the [[Pies Descalzos Foundation]]. It is a Colombian charity with special schools for poor children all around Colombia. During her career, Shakira has performed at a large number of [[benefit concert]]s. Among the most famous are the [[Live 8 concert, Paris|Live 8 benefit concert]] in July 2005, the [[Live Earth concert, Hamburg]] where she headlined the show, as well as the &quot;[[Clinton Global Initiative]]&quot; created by former US President [[Bill Clinton]].

Since 2009, Shakira's musical career suffered from a strained relationship with her label [[Epic Records]], which resulted in lack of promotion and investment from Epic Records towards her two latter studio albums; [[She Wolf (album)|She Wolf]] (2009) and [[Sale el Sol]] (2010). However, Shakira is to enter a bidding war from labels such as [[Interscope Records]] and [[Def Jam Records]] after the release of her 2011 World Tour DVD, titled [[Shakira: Live from Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nypost.com/p/pagesix/shakira_label_shopping_xr7jZZIaiuuGM9DzialGCN?utm_campaign=Post10&amp;utm_source=Post10Alpha&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:EsculturaShakira.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Shakira in [[Barranquilla]], Colombia]]

Shakira spent much of her youth in [[Barranquilla]], a city located in northern Colombia. Shakira wrote her first poem, entitled &quot;La Rosa De Cristal&quot; (&quot;The Crystal Rose&quot;) when she was only four years old. As she was growing up, she was fascinated watching her father writing stories on a [[typewriter]], and asked for one as a Christmas gift. She got her wish at age seven and continued writing poetry. These poems eventually evolved into songs. At the age of two, an older half-brother was killed in a motorcycle accident and at the age of eight, Shakira wrote her first song entitled &quot;Tus gafas oscuras&quot; (&quot;Your dark glasses&quot;) which was inspired by her father, who for years wore dark glasses, to hide his grief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redbalcony.com/?aid=167 |title=Shakira |publisher=RedBalcony |accessdate=March 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Shakira was four, her father took her to a local Middle Eastern restaurant, where Shakira first heard the [[doumbek]], a traditional drum used in [[Arabic music]] and which typically accompanied [[belly dancing]].&lt;ref name=rollingstone/&gt; Before she knew it, Shakira was dancing on the table, she then knew she wanted to be a performer. She enjoyed singing for schoolmates and teachers (and even the nuns) at her Catholic school, but in the second grade was rejected for the school choir because her [[vibrato]] was too strong. The music teacher told her that she sounded &quot;like a goat&quot;.&lt;ref name=rollingstone&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/artists/shakira/articles/story/5937750/shakira |title=Shakira |accessdate =April 24, 2007|last=Wright|first=Evan|date=April 11, 2002 |work=Rolling Stone }}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/music/newsid_1890000/1890956.stm Shakira: 'I don't hate Britney'], ''BBC News'', March 24, 2002.

When she was eight, Shakira's father declared bankruptcy. While the details were sorted out, she stayed with relatives in Los Angeles. On returning to Barranquilla, she was shocked to find that much of what her parents owned had been sold; as she later said &quot;In my childish head, this was the end of the world.&quot;&lt;ref name=ShakiraTimes200903/&gt; To show her that things could be worse, her father took her to a local park to see orphans who lived there. The images stayed with her and she said to herself &quot;one day Iâm going to help these kids when I become a famous artist.&quot;&lt;ref name=ShakiraTimes200903/&gt; Between the ages of ten and thirteen Shakira was invited to various events in Barranquilla and gained some recognition in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;&gt;[http://www.gale.com/free_resources/chh/bio/shakira.htm &quot;Shakira&quot;]. ''Contemporary Musicians'', Volume 33. 2002. Retrieved February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was at about this time that she met local theater producer Monica Ariza, who was impressed with her and as a result tried to help her career. During a flight from Barranquilla to [[BogotÃ¡]], Ariza convinced [[Sony]] Colombia executive Ciro Vargas to hold an audition for Shakira in a hotel lobby. Vargas held Shakira in high regard and, returning to the Sony office, gave the cassette to a song and artist director. However, the director was not overly excited and thought Shakira was something of &quot;a lost cause&quot;. Vargas, not daunted, was still convinced that Shakira had talent, and set up an audition in BogotÃ¡. He arranged for Sony Colombia executives to arrive at the audition, with the idea of surprising them with Shakira's performance. She performed three songs for the executives and impressed them enough for her to be signed to record three albums.&lt;ref name=&quot;driven&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vh1.com/shows/dyn/driven/96614/episode_about.jhtml|title=Driven: Shakira|accessdate=April 24, 2007|publisher=VH1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music career==
===1990â94: Career beginnings===
{{Main|Magia (Shakira album)|l1=Magia|Peligro (Shakira album)|l2=Peligro}}

Shakira's debut album, ''[[Magia (Shakira album)|Magia]]'', was recorded with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music Columbia]] in 1990 when she was only thirteen years old.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakira biography&quot;/&gt; The songs are a collection made by her since she was 8, mixed [[pop-rock]] [[ballad]]s and [[disco]] uptempo songs with electronic accompaniment, however it was hampered by a lack of recording and production cohesion. The album was released in June 1991 and featured &quot;Magia&quot; and three other singles. Though it fared well on Colombian radio and gave the young Shakira much exposure, the album did not fare well commercially as only 1,200 copies were sold worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;rollingstone&quot;/&gt; After the poor performance of ''Magia'', Shakira's label urged her to return to the studio to release a follow-up record. Although little known outside of her native Colombia, Shakira was invited to perform at Chile's [[ViÃ±a del Mar International Song Festival]] in February 1993. The festival gave aspiring Latin American singers a chance to perform their songs, and the winner was then chosen by a panel of judges. Shakira performed the ballad &quot;Eres&quot; (&quot;You Are&quot;) and won the trophy for third place. One of the judges who voted for her to win was then 20-year-old [[Ricky Martin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakira biography&quot;/&gt;

Shakira's second studio album ''[[Peligro (Shakira album)|Peligro]]'' was released in March, but Shakira was not pleased with the final result, mainly taking issue with the production. The album was better received than ''Magia'', though it was also considered a commercial failure due to Shakira's refusal to advertise it. Shakira then decided to take a hiatus from recording so that she could graduate from high.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakira biography&quot;/&gt; In the same year, Shakira starred in the Colombian TV Series &quot;The Oasis&quot;, loosely based on the [[Armero tragedy]] in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/shakira/artist.jhtml#biographyEnd|title=Shakira â Full Biography |accessdate =March 20, 2010|last= Huey|first=Steve|publisher=MTV }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the albums have been pulled from release and are not considered official Shakira albums but rather promotional albums.

===1995â97: ''Pies Descalzos'' and ''The Remixes''===
{{Main|Pies Descalzos|The Remixes (Shakira album)|l2=The Remixes}}
Shakira originally recorded the song &quot;[[Â¿DÃ³nde EstÃ¡s CorazÃ³n?]]&quot; (later released on her album ''Pies Descalzos'') for the compilation album ''Nuestro Rock'' in 1995, released exclusively in Colombia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.songfacts.com/detail.php?id=1751|title=Donde Estas Corazon? by Shakira |accessdate =March 20, 2010|work=SongFacts }}&lt;/ref&gt; âPies Descalzosâ album brought her great popularity in Latin America by the hit singles &quot;Estoy AquÃ­,&quot; &quot;Pies Descalzos, SueÃ±os Blancos&quot; and &quot;DÃ³nde EstÃ¡s CorazÃ³n.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakira biography&quot;/&gt; Shakira also recorded three tracks in Portuguese titled âEstou Aquiâ, âUm Pouco de Amorâ, and âPÃ©s DescalÃ§osâ.

Shakira returned to recording music under Sony Music along with [[Columbia Records|Columbia]] in 1995 with Luis F. Ochoa, using musical influences from a number of countries and an [[Alanis Morissette]]-oriented persona which affected two of her next albums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/30/AR2006083003265.html|title=In Any Language, a Whole Lotta Shakira Goin' On|accessdate =January 22, 2007|last= Freedom du Lac|first=Josh.|date=August 31, 2006 |work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt; These recordings spawned her third studio album but first official, ''[[Pies Descalzos]]''. Recording for the album began in February 1995, after the success of her single &quot;Â¿DÃ³nde EstÃ¡s CorazÃ³n?&quot;. Sony gave Shakira $100,000 to produce the album since they predicted that the album would not sell past 100,000 copies. Starting with this album, Shakira began producing her own music, perfecting her vocals and most of all, practicing creative control over her music. Highly influenced by the American alternative market and British groups such as ''[[The Pretenders]]'', the album's songs are melodic, musically surprising and gritty, with intellectual lyrics and an electronic/acoustic blend that effectively broke the formulaic mold of Latin pop with an authentic sound that had not been heard before.

The album ''[[Pies Descalzos]]'', was released in October 1995 in South America and in February 1996 internationally. It debuted at number one in eight different countries. However, it only managed to reach number one-hundred-eighty on the U.S. [[Billboard 200]] but reached number five on the U.S. [[Billboard Top Latin Albums]] chart. The album spawned six hit singles, &quot;[[Estoy AquÃ­]]&quot; which reached number two on the U.S. Latin chart, &quot;[[Â¿DÃ³nde EstÃ¡s CorazÃ³n?]]&quot; which reached number five on the U.S. Latin chart, &quot;[[Pies Descalzos, SueÃ±os Blancos]]&quot; which reached number eleven on the U.S. Latin chart, &quot;[[Un Poco de Amor (song)|Un Poco De Amor]]&quot; which reached number six on the U.S. Latin chart, &quot;[[AntologÃ­a (Shakira song)|AntologÃ­a]]&quot; which reached number fifteen on the U.S. Latin Pop Songs chart and &quot;[[Se Quiere, Se Mata]]&quot; which reached number eight on the U.S. Latin chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/artist/shakira/chart-history/147604|title=Billboard&amp;nbsp;â Artist Chart History: Shakira|work=Billboard}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1996, [[RIAA]] certified the album platinum status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?resultpage=1&amp;table=SEARCH_RESULTS&amp;action=&amp;title=PiesDescalzos&amp;artist=&amp;format=&amp;debutLP=&amp;category=&amp;sex=&amp;releaseDate=&amp;requestNo=&amp;type=&amp;level=&amp;label=&amp;company=&amp;certificationDate=&amp;awardDescription=&amp;catalogNo=&amp;aSex=&amp;rec_id=&amp;charField=&amp;gold=&amp;platinum=&amp;multiPlat=&amp;level2=&amp;certDate=&amp;album=&amp;id=&amp;after=&amp;before=&amp;startMonth=1&amp;endMonth=1&amp;startYear=1958&amp;endYear=2009&amp;sort=Artist&amp;perPage=25|title=RIAA: Gold &amp; Platinum.

In March 1996, Shakira went on to her first international tour named simply the ''[[Tour Pies Descalzos]]''. The tour consisted of 20 shows and ended in 1997. Also in that year, Shakira received three [[Billboard Latin Music Awards]] for Album of the Year for ''Pies Descalzos'', Video of the Year for &quot;Estoy Aqui&quot; and [[Best New Artist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europanas.com/shakira-en.htm|title=Europanas-Musica-Shakira}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Pies Descalzos'' later sold over 5 million copies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ssmusic.tv/artist_profile.php?Opt=2&amp;Language=&amp;artId=20070600001|title=SS Music|publisher=SS Music}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakira.com/discography/index/album/albumId/1/tagName/Albums|title=Pies Descalzos: Description|publisher=Shakira.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompting the release of a remix album, simply titled ''The Remixes''. ''The Remixes'' also included [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] versions of some of her well known songs, which were recorded as a result of her success in the Brazilian market, where ''Pies Descalzos'' sold nearly one million copies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;/&gt;

===1998â2000: ''DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n Los Ladrones?'' and ''MTV Unplugged''===
{{Main|DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n Los Ladrones?|MTV Unplugged (Shakira album)|l2=MTV Unplugged}}
Her second official studio album, ''[[DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n Los Ladrones?]]'', produced entirely by Shakira herself and [[Emilio Estefan, Jr.]] as the executive producer, was released in September 1998. The album, inspired by an incident in an airport in which a suitcase full of her written lyrics was stolen, became a bigger hit than ''Pies Descalzos''. [[Allmusic]] and [[Rolling Stone]] both gave the album a four out of five stars rating. The album has reached a peak position of number one-hundred-thirty-one on the U.S. ''Billboard 200'' and held the top spot on the U.S. Latin Albums chart for eleven weeks. It has since sold over 1.5&amp;nbsp;million copies in the U.S. alone, making it one of the best selling Spanish albums in the U.S. Eight of the album's eleven tracks became singles, including &quot;[[Ciega, Sordomuda]]&quot;, &quot;[[Moscas En La Casa]]&quot;, &quot;[[No Creo]]&quot; which became her first single to chart on the U.S. ''Billboard'' [[Hot 100]], &quot;[[Inevitable (Shakira song)|Inevitable]]&quot;, &quot;[[TÃº (song)|TÃº]]&quot;, &quot;[[Si Te Vas (Shakira song)|Si Te Vas]]&quot;, &quot;[[Octavo DÃ­a]]&quot;, and the world-famous, Arabic tinged &quot;[[Ojos AsÃ­]]&quot;. The latter two songs won Shakira one [[Latin Grammy]] each with six of the eight singles reaching the top 40 on the U.S. Latin chart.

''DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n Los Ladrones?'' has sold seven million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ticket4-you1&quot;/&gt; Shakira also received her first [[Grammy Award]] nomination in 1999 for [[Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album|Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://product.half.ebay.com/Donde-Estan-Los-Ladrones_W0QQtgZinfoQQprZ3295362 |title=Half.com / Music / Â¿DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n Los Ladrones? |publisher=Product.half.ebay.com |date=October 26, 2009 |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakira's first live album, ''[[MTV Unplugged (Shakira album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' was recorded in New York City on August 12, 1999.

===2001â04: ''Laundry Service'' and international success===
{{Main|Laundry Service|Tour of the Mongoose|l2=The Mongoose Tour}}
Upon the success of ''DÃ³nde EstÃ¡n Los Ladrones?'' and ''MTV Unplugged'', Shakira began working on an English crossover album. Thanks to other successful crossover acts, most notably that of [[Ricky Martin]], [[Selena]] and [[Enrique Iglesias]], the crossover of Spanish artists to the English market had a great surge of popularity in [[mainstream]] music and it was the next logical step to Shakira and her label for her career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1999/apr/18/entertainment/ca-28407|title=Queen of Crossover?|work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=April 18, 1999 | first=Alisa | last=Valdes-Rodriguez | date=April 18, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakira worked for over a year on new material for the album. &quot;[[Whenever, Wherever]]&quot; (&quot;[[Suerte]]&quot; in Spanish countries) was released as the first and lead single from Shakira's first English album and third studio album throughout the period of August 2001 and February 2002. The song took heavy influence from [[Andean music]], including the [[charango]] and [[panpipes]] in its instrumentation. The track was produced by Shakira, and it was an international success by reaching number one in most countries. It was also her first success in the U.S., by reaching number six on the Hot 100.

Shakira's third studio album and first English language album ''[[Laundry Service]]'' (''Servicio De Lavanderia'' in Latin America and Spain) was released on November 13, 2001. The album debuted at number three on the U.S. Billboard 200 chart selling over 200,000 records in its first week. ''Laundry Service'' was later certified triple platinum by the RIAA in June 2004 as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.biz/bbbiz/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1000509297 |title=Ask Billboard |publisher=Billboard.biz |date=May 12, 2004 |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and thus helped to establish Shakira's musical presence in the mainstream North American market. Seven songs from the album became international singles: &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot; / &quot;Suerte&quot;, &quot;[[Underneath Your Clothes]]&quot;, &quot;[[Objection (Tango)]]&quot; / &quot;[[Te Aviso, Te Anuncio (Tango)]]&quot;, &quot;[[The One (Shakira song)|The One]]&quot;, &quot;[[Te Dejo Madrid]]&quot;, &quot;[[Que Me Quedes TÃº]]&quot; and &quot;[[Poem To A Horse]]&quot;, with four of the singles becoming largely successful.

Because the album was created for the English language market, the rock and Spanish dance-influenced album gained mild critical success with some critics claimed that her English skills were too weak for her to write songs for it with ''Rolling Stone'' stating &quot;she sounds downright silly&quot; or &quot;Shakira's magic is lost in translation.&quot; Shakira also was criticized by her Latin fans for seemingly abandoning her folk and rock roots in favor of contemporary [[American pop]] music. Despite this fact, the album became the best selling album of 2002, selling more than 13 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;shakira.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shakira biography&quot;/&gt; and became the most successful album of her career to date. Around this time, Shakira also released four songs for [[Pepsi]] for her promotion in the English markets: &quot;Ask for More&quot;, &quot;Pide Mas&quot;, &quot;Knock on My Door&quot; and &quot;Pideme El Sol&quot;, included in the [[extended play]], [[Pepsi CD]].

In November 2002, Shakira embarked on the [[Tour of the Mongoose]] with 61 shows occurring by May 2003. The tour was also her first worldwide tour, as legs were played in North and South America as well as Europe and Asia. At [[Aerosmith]]'s [[MTV Icon]] in April 2002, Shakira performed &quot;[[Dude (Looks Like a Lady)]]&quot;. Also in 2002, Shakira joined the likes of [[Cher]], [[Whitney Houston]], [[Celine Dion]], [[Mary J. Blige]], [[Anastacia]], and the [[Dixie Chicks]] for ''[[VH1 Divas Live Las Vegas]]''. In September 2002, Shakira won the now-defunct International Viewer's Choice Award at the MTV Video Music Awards with &quot;Whenever, Wherever&quot;. Shakira also won the [[Latin Grammy Award]] for the category of [[Best Short Form Music Video]] for the Spanish version of the video. In October of that year, she won five [[MTV Video Music Awards Latin America]] for Best Female Artist, Best Pop Artist, Best Artist â North (Region), Video of the Year (for &quot;Suerte&quot;), and Artist of the Year. In November 2002, Shakiraâs label Sony BMG released her Spanish greatest hits compilation ''[[Grandes Ãxitos (Shakira album)|Grandes Ãxitos]]''. A DVD and ten-track live album, called ''[[Live &amp; Off the Record]]'', was also released in 2004, reaching sales of 3 million worldwide, and commemorating the Tour of the Mongoose.

===2005â08: ''FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1'' and ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2''===
{{Main|FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1|Oral Fixation Vol. 2|Oral Fixation Tour}}
After promotion for Shakira's third studio album ended in 2003, Shakira chose to step out of the spotlight to record new music. Many possible release dates for her fourth studio album were announced but later delayed until early 2005 when Shakira announced the title of her fourth record and that [[Rick Rubin]] would be the executive producer of the album. It was later announced that the album would instead be two albums. Shakira's fourth studio album, ''[[FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1]]'', was released in June 2005. The lead single from the album, &quot;[[La Tortura]]&quot; reached the top 40 of on the Hot 100 after being released in April 2005 and receiving large scale success on radio. The song also featured the Spanish balladeer [[Alejandro Sanz]]. It also spent a record of twenty-five weeks at number one on the U.S. Latin chart. Shakira became the first artist to perform a Spanish language song at the ''MTV Video Music Awards'' in 2005 as well.

Contrary to low expectations, ''FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1'' was extremely well received. It debuted at number four on the ''Billboard 200'' chart, selling 157,000 copies in its first week. It has since sold over two million copies in the U.S., earning a 2x Platinum certification from the RIAA. Due to its first week sales, the album became the highest debut ever for a Spanish language album. After only a day of release in Latin America, the album earned certifications. In Venezuela, it earned a Platinum certification, in Colombia, a triple Platinum certification while in Mexico, the album exceeded shipments and was unavailable after only one day of release. The album sold over one million copies in three days worldwide. Four other singles were also released from the album. &quot;[[No (song)|No]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dia De Enero]]&quot;, &quot;[[La Pared (Shakira song)|La Pared]]&quot; and &quot;[[Las De La IntuiciÃ³n]]&quot;, with each single reaching number one in countries worldwide.

On February 8, 2006, Shakira won her second Grammy Award with the win of ''Best Latin Rock/Alternative Album'' for ''FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx|title=Search results for Shakira|publisher=[[Grammy Award|Grammy.com]]}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakira received four Latin Grammy Awards in November 2006, winning the awards for [[Latin Grammy Award for Record of the Year|Record of the Year]], [[Latin Grammy Award for Song of the Year|Song of the Year]] for &quot;La Tortura&quot;, [[Latin Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Album of the Year]] and [[Latin Grammy Award for Best Pop Vocal Album, Female|Best Pop Vocal Album]] for ''FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/11/02/entertainment/main2147901.shtml|title=Shakira Wins Big At Latin Grammys&amp;nbsp;â CBS News|publisher=[[CBS|CBS News]]|accessdate=November 2, 2006 | date=November 2, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1'' has since sold over 4 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;ticket4-you1&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Shakira Rio 03.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Shakira at the [[Rock in Rio]] festival in 2008]]
Before the release of ''[[Oral Fixation Vol. 2]]'', Shakira's second bilingual studio album, Shakira appeared at the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2005]] in Lisbon, Portugal, where she performed &quot;[[Don't Bother]]&quot;, the lead single from the album, minutes before winning an award in the category of Best Female Artist. &quot;Don't Bother&quot;, however, failed to achieve chart success in the U.S. by missing the top 40 on the Hot 100. It did, however, reach the top 20 in most countries worldwide. Shakira's second English studio album and fifth studio album, ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'' was released on November 29, 2005. The album debuted at number five on the ''Billboard 200'', selling 128,000 copies in its first week. The album has gone on to sell 1.8&amp;nbsp;million records in the U.S., earning a Platinum certification from the RIAA. Oddly enough, the album did not fare as well as its Spanish counterpart in the U.S., selling a few hundred thousand less records overall. ''Oral Fixation Vol. 2'' has also gone on to sell over 8&amp;nbsp;million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shakira.com/discography/index/album/albumId/4/tagName/Albums|title=Oral Fixation vol. 2: Description}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cover of the album featured Shakira as Eve with forbidden fruit was also considered controversial, and had to be altered in several countries which would not sell the album with that cover.

Despite the commercial failure of the album's lead single in the U.S., it went on to spawn two more singles. &quot;[[Hips Don't Lie]]&quot;, featuring [[Wyclef Jean]], was released as the album's second single in February 2006. The song went on to become the highest selling single of the 21st century and became Shakira's first number one single on the Billboard Hot 100, in addition to reaching number one in over fifty-five countries. Shakira and Wyclef Jean also recorded a Bamboo version of the song to serve as the official theme of the [[FIFA World Cup 2006]]. Shakira, along with the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]], received the most nominations for the [[2006 MTV Video Music Awards]] with &quot;Hips Don't Lie&quot;, but she won only the award for [[Best Choreography]]. Shakira later released the third and final single from the album, &quot;[[Illegal (song)|Illegal]]&quot; featuring [[Carlos Santana]], in November 2006. The single reached number one in some European countries and on the U.S. dance chart, though it failed to reach the Hot 100.Shakira embarked on the [[Oral Fixation Tour]], in June 2006. The tour consisted of 125 shows between June 2006 and July 2007. The concert also visited all six continents. One show in [[Mexico City]] was performed for free, and earned an audience of over 200,000. This concert sets the record for the highest attendance of any concert in Mexican history. Shakira also performed on July 9, 2006 at the [[FIFA World Cup]] final in Germany. In November 2007, the [[Oral Fixation Tour (video)|''Oral Fixation Tour'' DVD]] was released and is also available in High Definition [[Blu-Ray]] format.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonybmg.no/nye_utgivelser/kommende_utgivelser/ Sonybmg.no]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two versions of the DVD have sold over 16 million copies worldwide. In February 2007, Shakira performed for the first time at the [[49th Grammy Awards]] and earned the nomination for [[Best Pop Collaboration with Vocals]] for &quot;Hips Donât Lie&quot; with Wyclef Jean, though she did not win the award.

===2009âpresent: ''She Wolf'' and ''Sale el Sol''===

During an online chat with her fans in ''El Heraldo'' in February 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elheraldo.com.co/ELHERALDO/BancoConocimiento/S/soforo/soforo.asp?CodSeccion=16 |title=El Heraldo.com |publisher=El Heraldo.com |accessdate=October 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakira revealed that work on her sixth studio album was about to begin. Furthermore, at Shakira's cousin Isa Mebarak's album release party in [[Colombia]], Shakira's father William Mebarak stated that Shakira was currently at work writing and producing new songs for her upcoming album. This was being done in &quot;her own studio&quot;, which many fans thought to mean the studio at her home in the [[Bahamas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elheraldo.com.co/ELHERALDO/BancoConocimiento/S/soforo/soforo.asp?CodSeccion=16 |title= Banco Conocimiento |publisher=Elheraldo.com.co |accessdate=October 31, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shakira recorded 2005's ''[[FijaciÃ³n Oral Vol. 1]]'' and 2006's ''[[Oral Fixation Vol. 2]]'' there as well.

After spending two weeks in London, Shakira flew to Colombia for a peace-promoting concert in [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]] (at the three way border of [[Colombia]], Peru and [[Brazil]]) with [[Carlos Vives]]. Followed by hundreds of thousands of fellow Colombians, Shakira was calling for the release of hostages being held by rebels in Colombia and an end to similar kidnappings in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogamole.tr3s.com/2008/07/21/shakira-one-ups-juanes-with-peace-concert/ |title=Shakira One-Ups Juanes with Peace Concert |publisher=Blogamole.tr3s.com |date=July 21, 2008 |accessdate=August 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, it was reported by Noticias Caracol in Colombia that Shakira returned to her home studio in the [[Bahamas]] and continued recording &quot;a little something&quot; with members of Vives' band. It was later confirmed that Shakira was working with the likes of [[RedOne]], [[Wyclef Jean]] and Luis F. Ochoa on her sixth studio album. RedOne later stated that Shakira was in &quot;an experimental phase&quot; and that she had been working on the album in Los Angeles, Miami, Vancouver, London, Uruguay and the Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/artman/publish/article_272621935.shtml|title=Michael Jackson Recording With Akon and RedOne: Album ETA Unknown|accessdate=July 16, 2007|date=July 13, 2007|publisher=National Ledger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums1.epicrecords.com/Artists/Shakira/albumnews EpicRecords.com]{{Dead link|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2008, [[Forbes]] named Shakira the fourth top-earning female artist in music industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2008/01/28/music-madonna-hollywood-biz-cz_dp_0129musicwomen.html|title=The Top-Earning Women In Music|accessdate=January 29, 2008|work=Forbes|date=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, in July 2008, Shakira signed a 10-year contract with [[Live Nation]], an international touring giant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/02/arts/music/02shakira-brief.html|title=Shakira Leaves Record Company for Live Nation|accessdate=July 2, 2008|work=New York Times | first=Ben | last=Sisario | date=July 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The touring group also doubles as a record label which promotes but does control the music their artists release. Regarding Shakira's contract, Jason Garner, the global music chief of Live Nation stated that: &quot;Shakira is one of the few truly global artists. She can sell music and tickets in nearly every corner of the globe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/03/31/celebrities-clothing-rich-women-power-deals.html|title=Savvy Celebrity Businesswomen|accessdate=January 4, 2009|work=Forbes |first=Kiri|last=Blakeley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neither Shakira's representatives nor Live Nation would confirm the value of the deal, but people close to the negotiations said that depending on Shakira's performance over the 10 years, it is likely to be worth between $70&amp;nbsp;million and $100&amp;nbsp;million. Shakira's contract with [[Epic Records]] calls for three more albums as well â one in English, one in Spanish, and a compilation, but the touring and other rights of the Live Nation deal were confirmed to begin immediately.

The album's second single, &quot;[[Did It Again (Shakira song)|Did It Again]]&quot;, was released in October 2009 and was originally due for a U.S. release, though this was later canceled. The single reached the top 40 in most countries worldwide. &quot;[[Give It Up To Me]]&quot;, featuring [[Lil Wayne]] was released as the album's second U.S. single in November 2009 and reached the top 40 in Canada and on the Hot 100. The album's U.S. release was delayed in order for Shakira to record the song, which was originally due to be featured on its producer [[Timbaland]]'s album, ''[[Timbaland Presents Shock Value II]]'' and would have featured Shakira. However, she chose to record it for her album with Timbaland's rap verse being scrapped in favor of a verse from [[Flo Rida]]. Plans for the single changed again when [[Lil Wayne]] requested to be featured on the song, with this later happening. The album's third and final single, &quot;[[Gypsy (Shakira song)|Gypsy]]&quot;, was released in February 2010 and reached the top 40 in Europe but failed to reach the top 40 in the U.S. or in South America, becoming a mildly successful single.
