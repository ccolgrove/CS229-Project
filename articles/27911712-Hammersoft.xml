The '''KapÄ±kule Railway Station''' (''KapÄ±kule garÄ±'' in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]) is the western most [[train station]] in [[Turkey]]. It is located in the border town of [[KapÄ±kule]] on the Turkish-Bulgarian border. The station is the western terminus for all Turkish domestic trains. Only the [[Bosphorus Express (Ä°stanbul-Bucharest)|Bosphorus Express]] and the [[Balkans Express]] continue westward.

==History==
The station was built in 1971 along with the [[Edirne cut-off]], to build a direct rail line to [[Edirne]] and [[Bulgaria]] without having to go through [[Greece]]. The line was completed in 1971 and electrified in 1997. The building of this line and a station in Edirne, was the cause of the abandonment of the [[KaraaÄaÃ§ Railway Station]] (the previous station servicing Edirne).

==Layout==
The station has two platforms servicing 4 tracks. There is a freight yard on the other tracks but is also used as a bypass of the station.
