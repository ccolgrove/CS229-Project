The development of Linux is one of the most prominent examples of [[free and open source software]] collaboration: the underlying [[source code]] may be used, modified, and distributedâcommercially or non-commerciallyâby anyone under licenses such as the [[GNU General Public License]]. Typically Linux is packaged in a format known as a ''[[Linux distribution]]'' for desktop and server use. Some popular mainstream Linux distributions include [[Debian (operating system)|Debian]] (and its derivatives such as [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]), [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] and [[openSUSE]]. Linux distributions include the Linux kernel, supporting [[system utility|utilities]] and [[library (computer science)|libraries]] and usually a large amount of application software to fulfill the distribution's intended use.

A distribution oriented toward desktop use may include the [[X Window System]] and an accompanying [[desktop environment]] such as [[GNOME]] or [[KDE Plasma Workspaces|KDE Plasma]]. Other distributions may include a less resource intensive desktop such as [[LXDE]] or [[Xfce]] for use on older or less-powerful computers. A distribution intended to run as a server may omit any graphical environment from the standard install and instead include other software such as the [[Apache HTTP Server]] and a [[SSH server]] like [[OpenSSH]]. Because Linux is freely redistributable, it is possible for anyone to create a distribution for any intended use. Commonly used applications with desktop Linux systems include the [[Mozilla Firefox]] web browser, the [[OpenOffice.org]] or [[LibreOffice]] office application suites, and the [[GIMP]] image editor.

The main supporting [[user space]] system tools and libraries from the [[GNU Project]] (announced in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]]) are the basis for the [[Free Software Foundation]]'s preferred name ''[[GNU/Linux naming controversy|GNU/Linux]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;lsag&quot;&gt;{{cite book | url = http://www.tldp.org/LDP/sag/html/sag.html#GNU-OR-NOT | title = Linux System Administrator's Guide | chapter = 1.1 | edition = version 0.9 | year = 2004 | accessdate = 2007-01-18 | first = Alex | last = Weeks }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu_homepage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/ |title=The GNU Operating System |publisher=Gnu.org |accessdate=2009-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Linux}}

===Unix===
The [[Unix]] operating system was conceived and implemented in 1969 at [[AT&amp;T]]'s Bell Laboratories in the [[United States]] by [[Ken Thompson]], [[Dennis Ritchie]], [[Douglas McIlroy]], and [[Joe Ossanna]]. It was first released in 1971 and was initially entirely written in [[assembly language]], a common practice at the time. Later, in a key pioneering approach in 1973, Unix was re-written in the programming language [[C (programming language)|C]] by [[Dennis Ritchie]] (with exceptions to the kernel and I/O). The availability of an operating system written in a high-level language allowed easier [[porting|portability]] to different computer platforms. With a legal glitch forcing AT&amp;T to license the operating system's source code to anyone who asked,&lt;ref name=&quot;faqs.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faqs.org/docs/artu/ch02s01.html |title=Origins and History of Unix, 1969â1995 |publisher=Faqs.org |date= |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unix quickly grew and became widely adopted by academic institutions and businesses. In 1984, AT&amp;T divested itself of Bell Labs. Free of the legal glitch requiring free licensing, Bell Labs began selling Unix as a [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] product.

[[Image:Richard Matthew Stallman cropped.jpeg|upright|thumb|left|[[Richard Stallman]], founder of the [[GNU project]]]]

===GNU===
The [[GNU Project]], started in 1983 by [[Richard Stallman]], had the goal of creating a &quot;complete Unix-compatible software system&quot; composed entirely of [[free software]]. Work began in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu_announce&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html |title=About the GNU Project â Initial Announcement |publisher=Gnu.org |date=2008-06-23 |accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in 1985, Stallman started the [[Free Software Foundation]] and wrote the [[GNU General Public License]] (GNU GPL) in 1989. By the early 1990s, many of the programs required in an operating system (such as libraries, [[compiler]]s, [[text editor]]s, a [[Unix shell]], and a windowing system) were completed, although low-level elements such as [[device driver]]s, [[daemon (computer software)|daemons]], and the [[kernel (computer science)|kernel]] were stalled and incomplete.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/gnu/gnu-history.html |title=Overview of the GNU System |publisher=Gnu.org |date= |accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linus Torvalds has said that if the [[GNU kernel]] had been available at the time (1991), he would not have decided to write his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.dina.dk/~abraham/Linus_vs_Tanenbaum.html | title = Linus vs. Tanenbaum debate }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BSD===
Although not released until 1992 due to [[Berkeley Software Distribution#Net/2 and legal troubles|legal complications]], development of [[386BSD]], from which [[NetBSD]] and [[FreeBSD]] descended, predated that of Linux.  [[Linus Torvalds]] has said that if 386BSD had been available at the time, he probably would not have created Linux.&lt;ref name=&quot;meta&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gondwanaland.com/meta/history/interview.html|title=The Choice of a GNU Generation â An Interview With Linus Torvalds|last=Linksvayer|first=Mike|year=1993|work=Meta magazine|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===MINIX===
{{double image|right|AndrewTanenbaum2.png|130|Linus Torvalds cropped.jpeg|150|[[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]] (left), author of the [[MINIX]] operating system, and [[Linus Torvalds]] (right), principal author of the [[Linux kernel]]}}

[[MINIX]] is an inexpensive minimal [[Unix-like]] operating system, designed for education in computer science, written by [[Andrew S. Tanenbaum]]. Starting with [[MINIX 3|version 3, MINIX]] was [[free software|free]] and redesigned for âseriousâ use.

In 1991 while attending the [[University of Helsinki]], Torvalds, curious about the operating systems &lt;ref&gt;{{cite newsgroup | title = What would you like to see most in minix? | newsgroup = comp.os.minix | id = 1991Aug25.205708.9541@klaava.Helsinki.FI | url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.minix/msg/b813d52cbc5a044b | last = Torvalds | first = Linus | accessdate = 2006-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and frustrated by the licensing of MINIX limiting it to educational use only (which prevented any commercial use), began to work on his own operating system which eventually became the [[Linux kernel]].

Torvalds began the development of the Linux kernel on MINIX, and applications written for MINIX were also used on Linux. Later Linux matured and it became possible for Linux to be developed under itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Chicken and egg: How was the first linux gcc binary created?? | newsgroup = comp.os.minix | url = http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux/msg/4ae6db18d3f49b0e }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also GNU applications replaced all MINIX ones, because with code from the GNU system freely available, it was advantageous if this could be used with the fledgling operating system. Code licensed under the GNU GPL can be used in other projects, so long as they also are released under the same or a compatible license. In order to make Linux available for commercial use, Torvalds initiated a switch from his original license (which prohibited commercial redistribution) to the GNU GPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Release notes for Linux v0.12 | first = Linus | last = Torvalds | url = http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12 | authorlink = Linus Torvalds | date = 1992-01-05 | accessdate = 2007-07-23 | publisher = Linux Kernel Archives | quote = The Linux copyright will change: I've had a couple of requests to make it compatible with the GNU copyleft, removing the âyou may not distribute it for moneyâ condition. I agree. I propose that the copyright be changed so that it confirms to GNU â pending approval of the persons who have helped write code. I assume this is going to be no problem for anybody: If you have grievances (&quot;I wrote that code assuming the copyright would stay the same&quot;) mail me. Otherwise The GNU copyleft takes effect since the first of February. If you do not know the gist of the GNU copyright â read it. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers worked to integrate GNU components with Linux to make a fully functional and free operating system.&lt;ref name=&quot;gnu history&quot;/&gt;

These third-party components comprise a vast body of work and may include both kernel modules and user applications and libraries. Linux vendors and communities combine and distribute the kernel, GNU components, and non-GNU components, with additional package management software in the form of [[Linux distribution]]s.

==Design==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=August 2011}}
A Linux-based system is a modular [[Unix-like]] operating system. It derives much of its basic design from principles established in Unix during the 1970s and 1980s. Such a system uses a [[monolithic kernel]], the [[Linux kernel]], which handles process control, networking, and [[peripheral]] and [[file system]] access. [[Device drivers]] are either integrated directly with the kernel or added as modules loaded while the system is running.

Separate projects that interface with the kernel provide much of the system's higher-level functionality. The GNU [[userland (computing)|userland]] is an important part of most Linux-based systems, providing the most common implementation of the [[C standard library|C library]], a popular [[shell (computing)|shell]], and many of the common [[Unix tool]]s which carry out many basic operating system tasks. The [[graphical user interface]] (or GUI) used by most Linux systems is built on top of an implementation of the [[X Window System]].

===User interface===
{{Refimprove|section|date=August 2011}}
{{See also|User interface}}
Users operate a Linux-based system through a [[command line interface]] (CLI), a [[graphical user interface]] (GUI), or through controls attached to the associated hardware, which is common for embedded systems. For desktop systems, the default mode is usually a graphical user interface, by which the CLI is available through [[terminal emulator]] windows or on a separate [[virtual console (PC)|virtual console]]. Most low-level Linux components, including the GNU [[userland (computing)|userland]], use the CLI exclusively. The CLI is particularly suited for automation of repetitive or delayed tasks, and provides very simple [[inter-process communication]]. A graphical [[terminal emulator]] program is often used to access the CLI from a Linux desktop. A Linux system typically implements a CLI by a [[shell (computing)|shell]], which is also the traditional way of interacting with a Unix system. A Linux distribution specialized for servers may use the CLI as its only interface.

On desktop systems, the most popular user interfaces are the extensive [[desktop environment]]s [[KDE Plasma Desktop]], [[GNOME]], and [[Xfce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Debian popularity-contest program information | url = http://times.debian.net/1092-30000-popcon-submissions }}&lt;/ref&gt; though a variety of additional user interfaces exist. Most popular user interfaces are based on the [[X Window System]], often simply called &quot;X&quot;. It provides [[network transparency]] and permits a graphical application running on one system to be displayed on another where a user may interact with the application.&lt;ref name=&quot;manX&quot;&gt;Manual page for &quot;X&quot; (xorg-docs 1:1.4-4 on Debian)&lt;/ref&gt;

Other GUIs may be classified as simple [[X window manager]]s, such as [[FVWM]], [[Enlightenment (window manager)|Enlightenment]], and [[Window Maker]], which provide a [[minimalism (computing)|minimalist]] functionality with respect to the desktop environments. A window manager provides a means to control the placement and appearance of individual application windows, and interacts with the X Window System. The desktop environments include window managers as part of their standard installations  ([[Metacity]] for GNOME, [[Kwin]] for KDE, [[Xfwm]] for Xfce as of 2010) although users may choose to use a different window manager if preferred.

==Development==
[[File:Unix history.svg |upright=1.4 |thumb| Simplified history of [[Unix-like]] operating systems. Linux shares similar architecture and concepts (as part of the [[POSIX]] standard) but does not share non-free source code with the original [[Unix]] or [[MINIX]].]]
{{Main|Linux distribution}}

The primary difference between Linux and many other popular contemporary operating systems is that the [[Linux kernel]] and other components are [[free software|free]] and [[open source software]]. Linux is not the only such operating system, although it is by far the most widely used.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarketShare09NOV&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://marketshare.hitslink.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=8|title = Operating System Market Share|accessdate = 2009-12-11|last = Operating System Market Share |authorlink = |year = 2009|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some [[free software license|free]] and [[open source license|open source]] software licenses are based on the principle of [[copyleft]], a kind of reciprocity: any work derived from a [[copyleft]] piece of software must also be copyleft itself. The most common free software license, the [[GNU GPL]], is a form of [[copyleft]], and is used for the Linux kernel and many of the components from the [[GNU project]].

Linux based distributions are intended by developers for [[interoperability]] with other operating systems and established computing standards. Linux systems adhere to [[POSIX]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ukuug.org/newsletter/linux-newsletter/linux@uk21/posix.shtml | title = POSIX.1 (FIPS 151-2) Certification }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Single UNIX Specification|SUS]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = How source code compatible is Debian with other Unix systems? | url = http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-compat.en.html#s-otherunices | work = Debian FAQ | publisher = the Debian project }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]], and [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] standards where possible, although to date only one Linux distribution has been POSIX.1 certified, Linux-FT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/0131|title=Certifying Linux|last=Eissfeldt|first=Heiko|publisher=Linux Journal|date=1996-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Debian GNU/Linux FAQ - Compatibility issues|url=http://www.debian.org/doc/FAQ/ch-compat.en.html|accessdate=17 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Free software projects, although developed in a [[collaboration|collaborative]] fashion, are often produced independently of each other. The fact that the software licenses explicitly permit redistribution, however, provides a basis for larger scale projects that collect the software produced by stand-alone projects and make it available all at once in the form of a [[Linux distribution]].

A [[Linux distribution]], commonly called a &quot;distro&quot;, is a project that manages a remote collection of system software and application software packages available for download and installation through a network connection. This allows the user to adapt the operating system to his/her specific needs. Distributions are maintained by individuals, loose-knit teams, volunteer organizations, and commercial entities. A distribution is responsible for the default configuration of the installed Linux kernel, general system security, and more generally integration of the different software packages into a coherent whole. Distributions typically use a [[package manager]] such as [[dpkg]], [[Synaptic (software)|Synaptic]], [[YAST]], or [[Portage (software)|Portage]] to install, remove and update all of a system's software from one central location.

===Community===
{{See also|Free software community|Linux User Group}}

A distribution is largely driven by its developer and user communities. Some vendors develop and fund their distributions on a volunteer basis, [[Debian]] being a well-known example. Others maintain a community version of their commercial distributions, as [[Red Hat]] does with [[Fedora (Linux distribution)|Fedora]] and [[Novell]] does with [[openSUSE]].

In many cities and regions, local associations known as [[Linux User Group]]s (LUGs) seek to promote their preferred distribution and by extension free software. They hold meetings and provide free demonstrations, training, technical support, and operating system installation to new users. Many [[Internet]] communities also provide support to Linux users and developers. Most distributions and free software / open source projects have [[IRC]] chatrooms or [[newsgroup]]s. [[Online forum]]s are another means for support, with notable examples being [[LinuxQuestions.org]] and the various distribution specific support and community forums, such as ones for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]], and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]]. Linux distributions host [[mailing list]]s; commonly there will be a specific topic such as usage or development for a given list.

There are several technology websites with a Linux focus. Print [[magazine]]s on Linux often include [[cover disk]]s including software or even complete Linux distributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/ | title=Linux Format DVD contents | author=[[Linux Format]] | accessdate=2008-01-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070807222402/http://www.linuxformat.co.uk/dvd/ |archivedate = August 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/resources/current_issue | title=Current Issue | author=linux-magazine.com | accessdate=2008-01-17 | authorlink=Linux Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although [[Linux distributions]] are generally available without charge, several large corporations sell, support, and contribute to the development of the components of the system and of [[free software]]. An analysis of the Linux kernel showed 75 percent of the code from December 2008 to January 2010 was developed by programmers working for corporations, leaving about 18 percent to the traditional, open source community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://apcmag.com/linux-now-75-corporate.htm | title=75% of Linux code now written by paid developers
| author=|work=[[APC (magazine)|APC]] | accessdate=2010-01-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the major corporations that contribute include [[Dell]], [[IBM]], [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Sun Microsystems]] (now part of Oracle), [[Novell]], and [[Nokia]]. A number of corporations, notably [[Red Hat]] and [[Novell]], have built a significant business around Linux distributions.

The [[free software licenses]], on which the various software packages of a distribution built on the Linux kernel are based, explicitly accommodate and encourage commercialization; the relationship between a Linux distribution as a whole and individual vendors may be seen as [[symbiosis|symbiotic]]. One common business model of commercial suppliers is charging for support, especially for business users. A number of companies also offer a specialized business version of their distribution, which adds proprietary support packages and tools to administer higher numbers of installations or to simplify administrative tasks.

Another business model is to give away the software in order to sell hardware. This used to be the norm in the computer industry, with operating systems such as [[CP/M]], [[Apple DOS]] and versions of [[Mac OS]] prior to 7.5 freely copyable (but not modifiable). As computer hardware standardized throughout the 1980s, it became more difficult for hardware manufacturers to profit from this tactic, as the OS would run on any manufacturer's computer that shared the same architecture.

===Programming on Linux===
Most Linux distributions support dozens of [[programming language]]s. The original development tools used for building both Linux applications and operating system programs are found within the [[GNU toolchain]], which includes the [[GNU Compiler Collection]] (GCC) and the [[GNU build system]]. Amongst others, GCC provides compilers for [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], [[C (programming language)|C]], [[C++]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], and [[Fortran]]. First released in 2003, the [[Low Level Virtual Machine]] project provides an alternate open-source compiler for many languages. [[Proprietary software|Proprietary]] compilers for Linux include the [[Intel C++ Compiler]], [[Sun Studio (software)|Sun Studio]], and IBM XL [[C (programming language)|C]]/[[C++]] Compiler. [[BASIC]] in the form of [[Visual Basic]] is supported in such forms as [[Gambas]], [[FreeBASIC]], and [[XBasic]].

Most distributions also include support for [[PHP]], [[Perl]], [[Ruby programming language|Ruby]], [[Python programming language|Python]] and other [[dynamic programming language|dynamic languages]]. While not as common, Linux also supports [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]] (via [[Mono (software)|Mono]]), [[Vala (programming language)|Vala]], and [[Scheme programming language|Scheme]]. A number of [[Java Virtual Machine]]s and development kits run on Linux, including the original Sun Microsystems JVM ([[HotSpot]]), and IBM's J2SE RE, as well as many open-source projects like [[Kaffe]] and [[JikesRVM]].

[[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] are popular [[desktop environment]]s and provide a framework for developing applications. These projects are based on the [[GTK+]] and [[Qt (toolkit)|Qt]] [[widget toolkit]]s, respectively, which can also be used independently of the larger framework. Both support a wide variety of languages. There are a number of [[Integrated development environment]]s available including [[Anjuta]], [[Code::Blocks]], [[CodeLite]], [[Eclipse (computing)|Eclipse]], [[Geany]], [[ActiveState Komodo]], [[KDevelop]], [[Lazarus (software)|Lazarus]], [[MonoDevelop]], [[NetBeans]],  [[Qt Creator]] and [[Omnis Studio]], while the long-established editors [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]] and [[Emacs]] remain popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Joe | last = Brockmeier | title = A survey of Linux Web development tools | url = http://programming.linux.com/programming/05/10/03/1828224.shtml?tid=63&amp;tid=47 | accessdate = 2006-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
As well as those designed for general purpose use on desktops and servers, distributions may be specialized for different purposes including: [[computer architecture]] support, [[Embedded Linux|embedded systems]], stability, security, localization to a specific region or language, targeting of specific user groups, support for [[real-time computing|real-time]] applications, or commitment to a given desktop environment. Furthermore, some distributions deliberately include only [[free software]]. Currently, over three hundred distributions are actively developed, with about a dozen distributions being most popular for general-purpose use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://lwn.net/Distributions/ | title = The LWN.net Linux Distribution List | accessdate = 2006-05-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linux is a widely [[porting|ported]] operating system kernel. The Linux kernel runs on a highly diverse range of [[computer architecture]]s: in the hand-held [[ARM architecture|ARM]]-based [[iPAQ]] and the [[mainframe computer|mainframe]] [[IBM]] [[IBM System z9|System z9]], [[IBM System z9|System z10]]; in devices ranging from [[mobile phone]]s to [[supercomputer]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.freeos.com/articles/4737/ | title = If I could re-write Linux | first = Prakash | last = Advani | date = 8 February 2004 | accessdate = 2007-01-23 | publisher = freeos.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specialized distributions exist for less mainstream architectures. The [[ELKS]] kernel [[fork (software development)|fork]] can run on [[Intel 8086]] or [[Intel 80286]] [[16-bit]] microprocessors, while the [[ÂµClinux]] kernel fork may run on systems without a [[memory management unit]]. The kernel also runs on architectures that were only ever intended to use a manufacturer-created operating system, such as [[Macintosh]] computers (with both [[PowerPC]] and [[Intel]] processors), [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]], [[video game console]]s, [[Digital audio player|portable music players]], and [[mobile phone]]s.

There are several industry associations and hardware [[Business conference|conferences]] devoted to maintaining and improving support for diverse hardware under Linux, such as [[FreedomHEC]].

===Desktop===
{{Main|Desktop Linux}}

The popularity of Linux on standard desktop computers and laptops has been increasing over the years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linux.org/info/index.html What is Linux]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently most distributions include a graphical user environment, with the two most popular environments being [[GNOME]] (which can utilize additional [[Shell (computing)|shells]] such as the default [[GNOME Shell]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[Unity (desktop environment)|Unity]]), and the [[KDE Plasma Desktop]].

The performance of Linux on the desktop has been a controversial topic; for example in 2007 [[Con Kolivas]] accused the Linux community of favoring performance on servers. He quit Linux kernel development because he was frustrated with this lack of focus on the desktop, and then gave a &quot;tell all&quot; interview on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why I quit: kernel developer Con Kolivas|url=http://apcmag.com/node/6735/|accessdate=2011-08-15|date=2007-07-24|work=APC Magazine|publisher=ACP Magazines}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then a significant amount of development has been undertaken in an effort to improve the desktop experience. Projects such as [[Upstart]] and [[systemd]] aim for a faster boot time.

Many popular applications are available for a wide variety of operating systems. For example [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[OpenOffice.org]]/[[LibreOffice]] and [[Blender (software)|Blender]] have downloadable versions for all major operating systems. Furthermore, some applications were initially developed for Linux, such as [[Pidgin (software)|Pidgin]], and [[GIMP]], and were ported to other operating systems including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] due to their popularity. In addition, a growing number of proprietary desktop applications are also supported on Linux;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iist.unu.edu/globaldesktop/ | title = The Global Desktop Project, Building Technology and Communities|accessdate = 2006-05-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; see [[List of proprietary software for Linux]]. In the field of animation and visual effects, most high end software, such as [[Maya (software)|Autodesk Maya]], Softimage XSI and [[Shake (software)|Apple Shake]], is available for Linux, Windows and/or Mac OS X. There are also [[Linux gaming#Commercial games|several companies]] that have ported their own or other companies' games to Linux.

Many types of applications available for Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X are also available for Linux. Commonly, either a [[free software]] application will exist which does the functions of an application found on another operating system, or that application will have a version that works on Linux, such as with [[Skype]] and some [[Linux gaming#Commercial games|video games]]. {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} Furthermore, the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project provides a Windows compatibility layer to run unmodified Windows applications on Linux. [[CrossOver]] is a proprietary solution based on the open source [[Wine (software)|Wine]] project that supports running Windows versions of [[Microsoft Office]], [[Intuit]] applications such as [[Quicken]] and [[QuickBooks]], [[Adobe Photoshop]] versions through CS2, and many popular games such as ''[[World of Warcraft]]'' and ''[[Team Fortress 2]]''. In other cases, where there is no Linux port of some software in areas such as [[desktop publishing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freeos.com/articles/2540/ |title=Microsoft Office for Linux? |accessdate=2008-02-03 |last=Advani |first=Prakash |date=2000-10-27 |work=FreeOS |publisher=FreeOS Technologies (I) Pvt. Ltd. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[professional audio]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/guides/tweaks/linux-audio.ars |title=Editing audio in Linux |accessdate=2008-02-03 |last=Smith-Heisters |first=Ian |date=2005-10-11 |work=Ars Technica |publisher=Ars Technica, LLC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.keyboardmag.com/article/linux-its-not/apr-07/27458 |title=Linux: It's Not Just For Computer Geeks Anymore |accessdate=2008-02-03 |last=Lumma |first=Carl |date = April 2007|work=Keyboard Magazine |publisher=New Bay Media, LLC. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/feb04/articles/mirrorimage.htm |title=Using Linux For Recording &amp; Mastering |accessdate=2008-02-03 |last=James |first=Daniel |date = February 2004|work=Sound On Sound |publisher=SOS Publications Group }}&lt;/ref&gt; there is equivalent software available on Linux.

The collaborative nature of free software development allows distributed teams to perform [[language localisation|language localization]] of some Linux distributions for use in locales where localizing proprietary systems would not be cost-effective. For example the [[Sinhalese language]] version of the [[Knoppix]] distribution was available significantly before [[Microsoft Windows XP]] was translated to Sinhalese.{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}} In this case the [[Lanka Linux User Group]] played a major part in developing the localized system by combining the knowledge of university professors, [[linguist]]s, and local developers.

Installing, updating and removing software in Linux is typically done through the use of package managers such as the [[Synaptic Package Manager]], [[PackageKit]], and [[Yellow dog Updater, Modified|Yum Extender]]. While most major Linux distributions have extensive repositories, often containing tens of thousands of packages, not all the software that can run on Linux is available from the official repositories. Alternatively, users can install packages from unofficial repositories, download pre-compiled packages directly from websites, or compile the source code by themselves. All these methods come with different degrees of difficulty; compiling the source code is in general considered a challenging process for new Linux users, but it's hardly needed in modern distributions and is not a method specific to Linux.

[[Linux distributions]] have long been used as [[server (computing)|server]] operating systems, and have risen to prominence in that area; [[Netcraft]] reported in September 2006 that eight of the ten most reliable internet hosting companies ran Linux distributions on their [[web server]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Rackspace Most Reliable Hoster in September | url = http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2006/10/07/rackspace_most_reliable_hoster_in_september.html | publisher = Netcraft | date = 7 October 2006 | accessdate = 2006-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 2008, Linux distributions represented five of the top ten, [[FreeBSD]] three of ten, and [[Microsoft]] two of ten;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Aplus.Net is the Most Reliable Hosting Company Site in June 2008 | url = http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2008/07/07/aplusnet_is_the_most_reliable_hosting_company_site_in_june_2008.html | publisher = Netcraft | date = 7 July 2008 | accessdate = 2008-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; since February 2010, Linux distributions represented six of the top ten, [[FreeBSD]] two of ten, and [[Microsoft]] one of ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Most Reliable Hosting Company Sites in February 2010 | url = http://news.netcraft.com/archives/2010/03/01/most_reliable_hosting_company_sites_in_february_2010.html | publisher = Netcraft | date = 1 March 2010 | accessdate = 2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Linux distributions are the cornerstone of the [[LAMP (software bundle)|LAMP]] server-software combination (Linux, [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]], [[MySQL]], [[Perl]]/[[PHP]]/[[Python (programming language)|Python]]) which has achieved popularity among developers, and which is one of the more common platforms for website hosting.&lt;ref name=&quot;SecuritySpace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=SecuritySpace|url=http://www.securityspace.com/s_survey/data/201005/index.html |title=Web Server Survey |publisher=SecuritySpace |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linux distributions]] have become increasingly popular on [[mainframe computer|mainframes]] in the last decade partly due to pricing and the open-source model.&lt;ref name=&quot;rules_supercomputers&quot;/&gt;{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In December 2009, computer giant [[IBM]] reported that it would predominantly market and sell mainframe-based Enterprise Linux Server.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Register&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Timothy Prickett Morgan|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/11/ibm_linux_only_mainframe/ |title=IBM punts Linux-only mainframes Big MIPS, deep discounts |publisher=The Register |date=11 December 2009|accessdate=2009-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Linux distribution]]s are also commonly used as [[operating systems]] for [[supercomputer]]s: {{As of|2010|11|01|alt=since November 2010}}, out of the [[TOP500|top 500]] systems, 459 (91.8%) run a Linux distribution.&lt;ref name=&quot;top500_osfam&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=TOP500.org |url=http://www.top500.org/stats/list/36/osfam |title=Operating system Family share for 11/2010 &amp;#124; TOP500 Supercomputing Sites |publisher=Top500.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linux was also selected as the operating system for the world's most powerful supercomputer, IBM's [[IBM Sequoia|Sequoia]] which will become operational in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;IBM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/26599.wss|title=20 Petaflop Sequoia Supercomputer|publisher=[[IBM]]|date=3 Feb 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Embedded devices===

[[File:Android screenshot.png|thumb|150px|right|Home screen displayed on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] 2.3 &quot;Gingerbread&quot;]]
Due to its low cost and ease of customization, [[embedded Linux|Linux]] is often used in [[embedded system]]s. [[Android (operating system)|Android]]âbased on a modified version of the Linux kernelâhas become a major competitor of Nokia's older [[Symbian]] OS, found in many [[smartphone]]s. During the third quarter of 2010, 25.5% of smartphones sold worldwide used Android (with all Linux variants forming 27.6% of the total during that time).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gartner.com/it/page.jsp?id=1466313 | title = Gartner Says Worldwide Mobile Phone Sales Grew 35 Percent in Third Quarter 2010; Smartphone Sales Increased 96 Percent }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell phones and PDAs running Linux on open-source platforms became more common from 2007; examples include the [[Nokia N810]], [[Openmoko]]'s [[Neo1973]], and the [[Motorola ROKR E8]]. Continuing the trend, [[Palm, Inc.|Palm]] (later acquired by [[HP]]) produced a new Linux-derived operating system, [[webOS]], which is built into its new line of [[Palm Pre]] smartphones. The popular [[TiVo]] digital video recorder also uses a customized Linux,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.tivo.com/linux/linux.asp | title = TiVo â GNU/Linux Source Code | accessdate = 2006-12-12 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070519150730/http://www.tivo.com/linux/linux.asp |archivedate=2007-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do several network [[Firewall (computing)|firewalls]] and [[router (computing)|router]]s from such makers as [[Cisco]]/[[Linksys]].

===Market share and uptake===
{{Main|Linux adoption}}
{{OS marketshare|align=right}}
{{See also|Usage share of operating systems}}
Many quantitative studies of [[free software|free]] / open source software focus on topics including market share and reliability, with numerous studies specifically examining Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = David A | last = Wheeler | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/oss_fs_why.html | title = Why Open Source Software/Free Software (OSS/FS)? Look at the Numbers! | accessdate = 2006-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Linux market is growing rapidly, and the revenue of servers, desktops, and packaged software running Linux was expected to exceed $35.7 billion by 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.techweb.com/wire/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=55800522 | title = Linux To Ring Up $35 Billion By 2008 | accessdate = 2006-04-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[International Data Corporation|IDC]]'s Q1 2007 report indicated that Linux held 12.7% of the overall server market at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Linux-watch.com IDC's Q1 2007 report&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS5369154346.html |title=â IDC Q1 2007 report |publisher=Linux-watch.com |date=2007-05-29 |accessdate=2009-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; This estimate was based on the number of Linux servers sold by various companies, and did not include server hardware purchased separately which had Linux installed on it later.

Primarily based on [[web analytics|web server statistics]], various companies estimated that the desktop market share of Linux range from less than 1% to 4.8%.&lt;ref name=&quot;W3Schools&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.w3schools.com/browsers/browsers_os.asp|title = OS Platform Statistics|accessdate = 2010-07-14|last = W3Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, [[List of Microsoft operating systems|Microsoft operating systems]] hold more than 85%.&lt;ref name=&quot;galli2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;paul2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;beer2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;applications2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;xitimonitor2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;globalstats2007&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;zeitgeist2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Byfield04May09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/12068_3818696_2/Linux-Desktop-Market-Share-Greater-Than-One-Percent.htm|title = Linux Desktop Market Share: Greater Than One Percent?|accessdate = 2009-05-06|last = Byfield|first = Bruce|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;W3CCounterJuly09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.w3counter.com/globalstats.php|title = W3Counter â Global Webstats|accessdate = 2009-08-22|last = Awio Web Services|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysts and proponents attribute the relative success of Linux to its security, reliability, low cost, and freedom from [[vendor lock-in]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20070217125550/http://www.ca.com/za/news/2005/20051010_linux.htm| title = The rise and rise of Linux|date=10 October 2005|publisher=Computer Associates International}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://web.archive.org/web/20080603232638/http://www-306.ibm.com/software/info/features/feb152005/ | title = Why customers are flocking to Linux |author=Jeffrey S.

The [[OLPC XO-1|XO laptop]] project of One Laptop Per Child is creating a new and potentially much larger Linux community which is planned to reach millions of schoolchildren and their families in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=mission|url=http://www.laptop.org/en/vision/mission/index.shtml|publisher=laptop.org|accessdate=2008-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Major supporters of the project include [[Google]], [[Red Hat]], and [[eBay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-static.laptop.org/vision/progress/ One Laptop per Child (OLPC), a low-cost, connected laptop for the world's children's education]&lt;/ref&gt; Although the XO will have a Windows option, it will be primarily deployed with [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]] Linux while using [[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]] as the desktop environment.

For years Linux has been the platform of choice in the film industry. The first major film produced on Linux servers was 1997's [[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Strauss|first=Daryll|title=Linux Helps Bring Titanic to Life|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/2494?page=0,0|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rowe|first=Robin|title=Linux and Star Trek|url=http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/6339|accessdate=28 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then major studios including [[Dreamworks Animation]], [[Pixar]], [[Weta Digital]], and [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] have migrated to Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/5472 | title = Industry of Change: Linux Storms Hollywood | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://video.fosdem.org/2008/maintracks/FOSDEM2008-tuxwithshades.ogg | title = Tux with Shades, Linux in Hollywood | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.wetafx.co.nz/jobs/ | title = Weta Digital â Jobs | accessdate = 2010-11-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Linux Movies Group, more than 95% of the servers and desktops at large animation and visual effects companies use Linux.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxmovies.org/ | title = LinuxMovies.org â Advancing Linux Motion Picture Technology | accessdate = 2009-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright, trademark, and naming==
{{See also|SCO-Linux controversies}}
Linux and most GNU software are [[software license|licensed]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] (GPL). The GPL requires that anyone who distributes Linux must make the source code (and any modifications) available to the recipient under the same terms. Other key components of a software system may use other licenses; many libraries use the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] (LGPL), a more permissive variant of the GPL, and the [[X.org Server|X.org]] implementation of the [[X Window System]] uses the [[MIT License]].

Torvalds states that the Linux kernel will not move from version 2 of the GPL to version 3. He specifically dislikes some provisions in the new license which prohibit the use of the software in [[digital rights management]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/1/25/273 | title=Re: GPL V3 and Linux â Dead Copyright Holders | author=Torvalds, Linus | date=2006-01-26 | publisher=[[Linux Kernel Mailing List]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lkml.org/lkml/2006/9/25/161 | title=Re: GPLv3 Position Statement | author=Torvalds, Linus | date=2006-09-25 | publisher=[[Linux Kernel Mailing List]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it would also be impractical to obtain permission from all the copyright holders, who number in the thousands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-watch.com/news/NS3301105877.html |title=â Keeping an Eye on the Penguin |publisher=Linux-watch.com |date=2006-02-07 |accessdate=2010-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2001 study of [[Red Hat Linux]] 7.1 found that this distribution contained 30 million [[source lines of code]].&lt;ref name = &quot;estimating_size&quot;/&gt; Using the [[COCOMO|Constructive Cost Model]], the study estimated that this distribution required about eight thousand man-years of development time. According to the study, if all this software had been developed by conventional [[proprietary software|proprietary]] means, it would have cost about ${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|1080000000|2000}}|0}} ({{CURRENTISOYEAR}} US dollars) to develop in the United States.&lt;ref name = &quot;estimating_size&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first = David A | last = Wheeler | date = 2002-07-29 | url = http://www.dwheeler.com/sloc/redhat71-v1/redhat71sloc.html | title = More Than a Gigabuck: Estimating GNU/Linux's Size | accessdate = 2006-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the code (71%) was written in the [[C (programming language)|C]] [[computer programming|programming]] [[programming language|language]], but many other languages were used, including [[C++]], [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]], [[assembly language]], [[Perl]], [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Fortran]], and various [[shell script]]ing languages. Slightly over half of all lines of code were licensed under the GPL. The Linux kernel itself was 2.4 million lines of code, or 8% of the total.&lt;ref name = &quot;estimating_size&quot;/&gt;

In a later study, the same analysis was performed for [[Debian|Debian GNU/Linux]] version 4.0 (etch, which was released in 2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Juan JosÃ© | last = Amor | coauthors = et al. | date = 17 June 2007 | url = https://penta.debconf.org/~joerg/attachments/33-measuring_etch_slides.pdf | title = Measuring Etch: the size of Debian 4.0 | accessdate = 2007-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This distribution contained close to 283 million source lines of code, and the study estimated that it would have required about seventy three thousand man-years and cost US${{formatprice|{{inflation|US|7170186240|2007}}|0}} (in {{CURRENTISOYEAR}} dollars) to develop by conventional means. &lt;!-- original paper quoted 5358000000 euros, but Wikipedia does not have an inflation calculator for euros; converted to USD via June 17 2007 exchange rate as provided by http://www.bankofcanada.ca/en/rates/exchform.html and double-checked against other sources of historical exchange rates ... it is also more useful to quote the number in dollars, for comparison to other dollar amounts quoted in this article, e.g. the 2001 study above --&gt;

In the United States, the name ''Linux'' is a trademark registered to Linus Torvalds.&lt;ref name=&quot;US_trademark&quot;/&gt; Initially, nobody registered it, but on 15 August 1994, William R. Della Croce, Jr. filed for the trademark ''Linux'', and then demanded royalties from Linux distributors. In 1996, Torvalds and some affected organizations sued him to have the trademark assigned to Torvalds, and in 1997 the case was settled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/article/9065 | title = Linux Timeline | publisher = Linux Journal | date = 31 May 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The licensing of the trademark has since been handled by the [[Linux Mark Institute]]. Torvalds has stated that he trademarked the name only to prevent someone else from using it. LMI originally charged a nominal sublicensing fee for use of the Linux name as part of trademarks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but later changed this in favor of offering a free, perpetual worldwide sublicense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.linuxmark.org
 | title = Linux Mark Institute
 | accessdate = 2008-02-24
 | quote = LMI has restructured its sublicensing program. Our new sublicense agreement is: Free â approved sublicense holders pay no fees; Perpetual â sublicense terminates only in breach of the agreement or when your organization ceases to use its mark; Worldwide â one sublicense covers your use of the mark anywhere in the world
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===GNU/Linux===
{{Main|GNU/Linux naming controversy}}

The [[Free Software Foundation]] views Linux distributions that use GNU software as [[GNU variants]] and they ask that such operating systems be referred to as ''GNU/Linux'' or ''a Linux-based GNU system''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stallman01&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = Linux and the GNU Project | url = http://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html | first = Richard | last = Stallman | authorlink = Richard Stallman | date = 2007-03-03 | accessdate = 2007-03-12 | publisher = Free Software Foundation }}&lt;/ref&gt; The media and common usage, however, refers to this family of operating systems simply as ''Linux'', as do many large Linux distributions (e.g. [[SUSE Linux]] and [[Mandriva Linux]]). Some distributions, notably [[Debian]], use ''GNU/Linux''. The naming issue remains controversial.
