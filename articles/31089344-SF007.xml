==Business model==
Many card [[Issuing Bank]]s issue prepaid [[Visa Inc.]] or MasterCard debit cards either directly or through Member Service Providers (MSPs). In order to compete, many of these organizations target specific markets, where they can differentiate their products. Payoneer pursues a number of markets by providing salary and commission payout solutions for industries like [[affiliate marketing]],&lt;ref name=&quot;PRWeb&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Avangate Pays Vendors and Affiliates Using the new Avangate Prepaid MasterCard Powered by Payoneer |url=http://www.prweb.com/releases/avangate/prepaid-debit-mastercard/prweb1865714.htm |publisher=[[PRWeb]] |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2011-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[summer camps]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Shifrin&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Shifrin |coauthors= |title=Paying with Plastic: Camping Style |url=http://www.acacamps.org/content/paying-plastic-camping-style |publisher=Camping Magazine |date=2010-03-02 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[freelancers]],&lt;ref name=&quot;oDesk&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=oDesk Expands Provider Payment Options with Payoneer and the oDesk Debit MasterCard |url=http://www.odesk.com/w/odesk-expands-provider-payment-options-payoneer-debit-mastercard |publisher=[[oDesk]] |date=2007-04-30 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[direct selling]] {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} and [[clinical trial]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;CenterWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=New York Hospital Uses Prepaid Cards to Pay Study Participants |url=http://www.centerwatch.com/news-resources/clinical-trials-today/headline-details.aspx?HeadlineID=853 |publisher=[[CenterWatch]] |date=2010-03-23 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Techcrunch]] described Payoneer as a competitor to [[Paypal]], having an &quot;advantage over Paypal in the micro-payments arena&quot; because &quot;it makes international payments easier by not requiring a bank account for verification.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schonfeld&quot;/&gt; According to ''[[The New York Observer]]'', a large share of the traffic to Payoneer's web site comes from Russia and Central Asian countries like Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelson&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Max |last=Abelson |title=New York City's Assassination Connection |url=http://www.observer.com/2010/wall-street/new-york-citys-assassination-connection |publisher=[[The New York Observer]] |date=2010-03-09 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Payoneer has a partnership with the freelance-marketplace firm [[Guru.com]]; 85% of Guru.com pay card holders are from outside USA.&lt;ref name=&quot;Heet&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=LaRita |last=Heet |title=More employees say 'hello' to payroll cards |url=http://www.creditcards.com/credit-card-news/payroll-cards-pay-cards-walmart-1271.php |publisher=CreditCards.com |date=2009-09-29 |accessdate=2011-02-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''The New York Observer'' reports that Payoneer uses Belizeâs [[Choice Bank Limited]] and the Iowa's [[MetaBank]] for some of its services, after it has used the [[First Bank of Delaware]] in the past.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abelson&quot;/&gt;
