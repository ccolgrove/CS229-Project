'''Fordham College of Liberal Studies''' is a degree-granting [[undergraduate]] college within [[Fordham University]] in the [[United States]]. The [[college]] is specifically intended to serve [[non-traditional students]], offering full-time and part-time study options, flexible schedules, and three different campus locations, in order to facilitate the needs of this population. 

==Courses==
The college offers [[Bachelor of Arts]] and [[Bachelor of Science]] degree programs. Fordham College of Liberal Studies follows the same [[Core Curriculum]] as the rest of the university's undergraduate colleges, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_of_l/lincoln_center/core_curriculum_13108.asp Fordham College of Liberal Studies, Lincoln Center Campus, Core Curriculum.] (Accessed March 30, 2008)]&lt;/ref&gt; and utilizes much of the same faculty. An Honors Program is available to very high academic achievers by invitation, however, that deviates from the Core Curriculum and relies heavily on faculty-supervised project work and independent research â an opportunity unavailable to non-traditional students at almost all other institutions. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_of_l/lincoln_center/fcls_honors_program_14516.asp Fodham College of Liberal Studies Honors Program] (Accessed March 30, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; Completion of the Honors Program entitles a graduate to have the phrase ''[[in cursu honorum]]'' noted on the transcript and diploma.

==Credit assignment==
College credit may be available to any student for prior instruction outside formal academic circumstances (military training, job-based technical training, etc.), and for life-experience learning. It is not possible to cobble together transfer credits, prior instruction credit, and life-experience credit alone to obtain a degree, however. A minimum number of [[college credit]]s must be earned at Fordham College of Liberal Studies in order to receive a [[bachelor's degree]]. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/colleges__graduate_s/undergraduate_colleg/fordham_college_of_l/lincoln_center/credit_for_life_expe_14535.asp Fodham College of Liberal Studies, Credit for Life Experience Learning.] (Accessed March 30, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;
