==Background==
 
Noor Uthman Muhammaed is a citizen of Sudan who described working at the [[Khalden training camp]], in [[Afghanistan]], from the mid-1990s, until it was shut down in 2000.  He first worked as a small-arms instructor, but after a few months of discontent he asked for a transfer.  Instead, Noor Uthman Muhammad was assigned as Khalden training camp's quartermaster.  He was responsible for the collection and distribution of camp supplies, such as food, water and firewood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cabot|first=Tyler|title=The  Prisoners of Guantanamo|url=http://www.esquire.com/features/guantanamo-prisoner-0911?click=pp|work=Esquire Magazine|publisher=Hearst Corporation|accessdate=18 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He denies membership in al Qaida or the Taliban, and described the Khalden camp as being an independent camp.

[[Joint Task Force Guantanamo]] [[counter-terrorism]] analysts describe him as being a senior member of [[al Qaida]]'s leadership cadre.
Noor Uthman Muhammaed was captured in [[Abu Zubaydah's house in Faisalabad]] on March 24, 2002, along with [[Abu Zubaydah]], [[Sufyian Barhoumi]], [[Ghassan al-Shirbi]], [[Jabran Al Qahtani]], [[Abdul Zahir (Guantanamo captive 753)|Abdul Zahir]] and several other suspects.  Four of the other captives captured in that house were to face charges before the [[Guantanamo military commission]]s, in 2005 and 2006.

Charges were initiated against Noor Uthman Muhammed on May 23, 2008.&lt;ref name=AP20080523&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Carol J. Williams]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' reports that all five men had been connected by [[Abu Zubaydah]] -- one of the three captives the CIA has acknowledged was interrogated using the controversial technique known as &quot;[[waterboarding]]&quot;.

Williams quoted the men's attorneys, who anticipated the five men would be re-charged in thirty days.&lt;ref name=LosAngelesTimes2008-10-21/&gt;
They told Williams that: ''&quot;... prosecutors called the move procedural&quot;,''
and attributed it to the resignation of fellow Prosecutor [[Darrel Vandeveld]], who resigned on ethical grounds.  Williams reported that [[Clive Stafford Smith]] speculated that the Prosecution's dropping of the charges, and plans to subsequently re-file charges later was intended to counter and disarm the testimony Vandeveld was anticipated to offer, that the Prosecution had withheld exculpatory evidence.

The current charges &lt;ref&gt;http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Referred%20Charge%20Sheet.pdf {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQnLBl0T|date =2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; against Noor Uthman were instated on 5 December 2008.

The [[Barack Obama]] [[United States President|Presidency]] was granted a continuance on October 21, 2009.&lt;ref name=Ap2009-10-21&gt;

The military commissions for five other captives have been granted continuances, until November 16, 2009.

On 13 November 2009, the Attorney General Eric Holder announced that Noor Uthman's case would continue in a military commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-guantanamo14-2009nov14,0,4700402.story U.S. to hold 9/11 trial in public court : Some praise the shift from Guantanamo to New York.

On April 8, 2010, [[Carol Rosenberg]], writing in the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', reported [[Captain (USN)|Captain]] [[Moira Modzelewski]], the [[Presiding Officer (Guantanamo Military Commissions)|Presiding Officer]] over Noor's military commission, predicted she would require a year to review the secret evidence against Noor.&lt;ref name=MiamiHerald-2010-04-08&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Rosenberg the provisions within the [[Military Commissions Act of 2009]] allowed the use of classified evidence, but only after a review by the Presiding Officer.
The Prosecution could submit a summary of classified evidence, in lieu of the evidence itsel, but the Presiding Officer was required to review every document the summary was based on, to ensure it was a fair summary.

On September 21, 2010, [[Carol Rosenberg|Carol Rosenburg]], again writing in the Miami Herald, reported that prosecutor Marine Major James Weirick stated that âNoor Uthman Mohammed for a number of years was the principal trainer and in charge of all training at the [[Khalden training camp]] in Afghanistan that provided numerous individuals who went on to serve for al Qaida.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/09/21/100941/prosecutor-guantanamo-detainee.html Prosecutor: Guantanamo detainee trained 9/11 hijackers &amp;#124; McClatchy] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5wQnLsVFS|date =2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 February 2011, Noor Uthman Muhammed pleaded guilty to providing material support for terrorism, and conspiracy to providing material support to an international terrorist organization and terrorism.  He was sentenced to 14 years of confinement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gitmo detainee pleads guilty to terror charges|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2011-02-15/us/gitmo.detainee.plea_1_gitmo-detainee-terror-charges-material-support?_s=PM:US|accessdate=2 March 2011|newspaper=CNN U.S.|date=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
