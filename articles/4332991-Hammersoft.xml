'''Tim Brown''' (born July 24, 1938 - died 1989?) was an [[United States|American]] former [[Figure skating|figure skater]].  He won the silver medal at the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] four times and twice captured the silver at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]].  He also competed at the [[1960 Winter Olympics]].  In 1961, he earned another berth to the World Championships but did not make the trip due to illness, a move that was ironically fortunate, as the entire [[U.S. Figure Skating]] team was killed en route to the competition when [[Sabena Flight 548]] crashed near [[Brussels]].

Brown also competed in [[ice dance]], winning the bronze at the 1958 nationals with partner [[Susan Sebo]].  He died of AIDS some time in the late 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;AIDS has killed 40 skaters, Lakeland Ledger, Dec 14, 1992[http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1347&amp;dat=19921214&amp;id=fuoSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=V_wDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6806,4483739]&lt;/ref&gt;
