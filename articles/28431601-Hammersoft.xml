The '''Kars railway station''' ({{lang-tr|Kars GarÄ±}}) is a [[train station]], serving the eastern [[Turkey|Turkish]] city of [[Kars]]. It is one of the easternmost stations on the Trans-Anatolian railway. The [[Eastern Express]] services Kars once a day to [[Ä°stanbul]]. Between 1993 and 2011, there was no train service east of Kars due to the Turkish-Armenian border closure. But as of February 2011, a [[Kars-Akkaya Regional|regional train]] operates twice daily from Kars to [[Akkaya]], the last Turkish town before the border.

The station was opened in 1899, by the [[Transcaucasus Railway]], when Kars was under the rule of the [[Russian Empire]] in order to have better control over the Ottoman front. The tracks were originally standard [[Russian gauge|Russian 5-foot gauge]]. After the [[Turkish War of Independence]], Kars was given back to [[Turkey]]. The [[Turkish State Railways]] took over the station, but Kars remained isolated from the rest of the network until 1939, when a [[standard gauge]] line was built to [[Erzurum]]. Passengers would change to a narrow gauge train from Erzurum to Kars. The Narrow gauge line was replaced with standard gauge in 1957 and the broad gauge line was replaced in 1962.
