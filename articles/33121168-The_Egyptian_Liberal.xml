'''Occupy Wall Street''' ('''OWS''') is an ongoing series of [[Demonstration (people)|demonstrations]] initiated by the Canadian activist group [[Adbusters]] which began September 17, 2011 in [[Zuccotti Park]], located in [[New York City]]'s [[Wall Street]] financial district. The protests are against social and [[economic inequality]], high unemployment, greed, as well as corruption, and the undue influence of corporationsâparticularly from the [[financial services]] sectorâon government. The protesters' slogan ''[[We are the 99%]]'' refers to the growing [[income inequality in the United States|difference in wealth]] in the U.S. between the wealthiest 1% and the rest of the population.

==Background==
===Origin===
In a July 13, 2011 blog post, the Canadian-based Adbusters Foundation, best known for its advertisement-free [[Anti-consumerism|anti-consumerist]] magazine ''[[Adbusters]]'', proposed a peaceful occupation of Wall Street to protest corporate influence on democracy, the absence of legal repercussions for the bankers behind the recent global financial crisis, and a growing disparity in wealth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/technology-news/from-a-single-hashtag-a-protest-circled-the-world-20111019-1m72j.html |title=From a single hashtag, a protest circled the world |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Fleming&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Fleming|first=Andrew|title=Adbusters sparks Wall Street protest Vancouver-based activists behind street actions in the U.S|url=http://www.vancourier.com/Adbusters+sparks+Wall+Street+protest/5466332/story.html|publisher=The Vancouver Courier|date=September 27, 2011|accessdate=September 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They sought to combine the symbolic location of the 2011 protests in [[Tahrir Square#2011 Egyptian Revolution|Tahrir Square]] with the [[consensus decision making]] of the [[2011 Spanish protests]].&lt;ref name=&quot;huffpo&quot;&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/shira-lazar/micah-white-adbusters-_b_996931.html Sira Lazar âOccupy Wall Street: Interview With Micah White From Adbustersâ, Huffington Post, October 7, 2011, at 3:40 in interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Adbusters' senior editor [[Micah M.

The internet group [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] encouraged its readers to take part in the protests, calling protesters to &quot;flood lower Manhattan, set up tents, kitchens, peaceful barricades and occupy Wall Street.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cnn&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|work=CNN tech|last=Saba|first=Michael|title=Twitter #occupywallstreet movement aims to mimic Iran|url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/09/16/tech/social-media/twitter-occupy-wall-street/index.html|date=September 17, 2011|accessdate=September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;adbusters3&quot;&gt;{{cite web |last=Adbusters |title=Anonymous Joins #OCCUPYWALLSTREET &quot;Wall Street, Expect Us!&quot; says video communique. |url=http://www.adbusters.org/blogs/adbusters-blog/anonymous-joins-occupywallstreet.html |publisher=Adbusters |date=August 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other groups began to join in the organization of the protest, including the U.S. Day of Rage and the NYC General Assembly, the governing body of the Occupy Wall Street group.&lt;ref name=&quot;ibtimes&quot;/&gt;  An Occupy Wall Street page on [[Facebook]] began on September 19 with a YouTube video of the early protests, and by September 22, it had reached critical mass.  By mid-October, Facebook listed  125 Occupy-related pages and roughly one in every 500 hashtags used on Twitter, all around the world, was the movement's own #OWS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/technology/technology-news/from-a-single-hashtag-a-protest-circled-the-world-20111019-1m72j.html |title=From a single hashtag, a protest circled the world |publisher=Brisbanetimes.com.au |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Adbusters''' [[Kalle Lasn]], when asked why it took three years after the implosion of [[Lehman Brothers]]' for people to begin protesting, said that after the election of President [[Barack Obama]] there was a feeling among the young that he would pass laws to regulate the banking system and &quot;take these financial fraudsters and bring them to justice.&quot; However, as time passed, &quot;the feeling that he's a bit of a gutless wonder slowly crept in&quot; and they lost their hope that his election would result in change.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Tyee&amp;nbsp;â Adbusters' Kalle Lasn Talks About OccupyWallStreet&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thetyee.ca/News/2011/10/07/Kalle-Lasn-Occupy-Wall-Street/ |title=The Tyee&amp;nbsp;â Adbusters' Kalle Lasn Talks About OccupyWallStreet |publisher=Thetyee.ca |accessdate=October 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protest was begun at [[Zuccotti Park]] since it was private property and police could not legally force protesters to leave without being requested to do so by the property owner.&lt;ref name=&quot;twsC65&quot;&gt;{{cite news |first=Laura |last=Batchelor |title=Occupy Wall Street lands on private property |work=CNNMoney |quote=Many of the Occupy Wall Street protesters might not realize it, but they got really lucky when they elected to gather at Zuccotti Park in downtown Manhattan |date=October 6, 2011 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/10/06/news/companies/occupy_wall_street_park/index.htm |accessdate=October 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At a press conference held on the same day as the protests began, New York City mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]] explained, &quot;People have a right to protest, and if they want to protest, we'll be happy to make sure they have locations to do it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ibtimes&quot;/&gt;

Immediate prototypes for OWS are the British student protests of 2010, Greece's and Spain's anti-austerity protests of the &quot;indignados&quot; (indignants), as well as the Middle Easts' Arab Spring protests. These antecedents have in common with OWS a reliance on social media and electronic messaging to circumvent the authorities, as well as the feeling that financial institutions, corporations, and the political elite have been [[wikt:malfeasant|malfeasant]] in their behavior toward youth and the middle class.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reutersmalfeasant&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Apps |first=Peter |url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/10/11/uk-global-politics-protest-idUSLNE79A03Z20111011 |title=Wall Street action part of global Arab Spring? |publisher=Reuters |date= October 11, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-24}} &quot;What they all share in common is a feeling that the youth and middle class are paying a high price for mismanagement and malfeasance by an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite...they took on slogans from U.S. protesters who describe themselves as the &quot;99 percent&quot; paying the price for mistakes by a tiny minority.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ArabSpring&quot;&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/oct/25/egyptian-protesters-occupy-wall-street?newsfeed=true Tahrir Square protesters send message of solidarity to Occupy Wall Street] by Jack Shenker and Adam Gabbatt  [[The Guardian]], Tuesday 25 October 2011 &quot;Much of the tactics, rhetoric and imagery deployed by protesters has clearly been inspired by this year's political upheavals in the Middle East...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Occupy Wall Street, in turn, gave rise to the [[Occupy movement]] in the United States and around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/oct/17/city-protest-occupied-mainstream In the City and Wall Street, protest has occupied the mainstream] By Polly Toynbee in [[The Guardian]], Monday 17 October 2011 &quot;From Santiago to Tokyo, Ottawa, Sarajevo and Berlin, spontaneous groups have been inspired by Occupy Wall Street.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theweek.com/article/index/220100/occupy-wall-street-a-protest-timeline Occupy Wall Street: A protest timeline]  &quot;A relatively small gathering of young anarchists and aging hippies in lower Manhattan has spawned a national movement. What happened?&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;top5&quot; /&gt;

===Goals===
The protesters targeted Wall Street because of the part it played in the economic crisis of 2008 which started the Great Recession.  They say that Wall Street's risky lending practices of mortgage-backed securities which ultimately proved to be worthless caused the crisis, and that [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008|the government bailout]] breached a sense of propriety.  The protesters say that Wall Street recklessly and blatantly abused the credit default swap market, and that the instability of that market must have been known beforehand.  They say that the guilty parties should be prosecuted.&lt;ref name=&quot;top5&quot;/&gt;

Some journalists have criticized the protests saying it is hard to discern a unified aim for the movement, while other commentators have said that although the movement is not in complete agreement on its message and goals, it does have a message which is fairly coherent.  [[Douglas Rushkoff]], writing for CNN, said that even though the protesters are not ready to articulate an exact array of problems or how to solve them,

{{Quotation|Anyone who says he has no idea what these folks are protesting is not being truthful. Whether we agree with them or not, we all know what they are upset about, and we all know that there are investment bankers working on Wall Street getting richer while things for most of the rest of us are getting tougher. What upsets banking's defenders and politicians alike is the refusal of this movement to state its terms or set its goals in the traditional language of campaigns...They mean to show that there is an inappropriate and correctable disconnect between the abundance America produces and the scarcity its markets manufacture.&lt;ref name=&quot;DouglasRushkoff&quot; /&gt;}}

The protesters want, in part, more and better jobs, more equal distribution of income, bank reform, and a reduction of the influence of corporations on politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;DouglasRushkoff&quot;&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2011/10/05/opinion/rushkoff-occupy-wall-street/index.html Think Occupy Wall St. is a phase?

The General Assembly, the governing body of the OWS movement, has adopted a âDeclaration of the Occupation of New York City,â which includes a list of grievances against corporations, and to many protesters a general statement is enough.  However, saying, &quot;âPower concedes nothing without a demand' &quot; others within the movement  have favored a fairly concrete set of national policy proposals.&lt;ref name=&quot;nytimes1&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/17/nyregion/occupy-wall-street-trying-to-settle-on-demands.html?scp=1&amp;sq=occupy%20wall%20street%20demands%20groups%20&amp;st=cse ''New York Times'']&lt;/ref&gt; One group has written an unofficial document, &quot;The 99 Percent Declarationâ, that calls for a national general assembly of representatives from all 435 congressional districts to gather on July 4, 2012, to assemble a list of grievances and solutions.&lt;ref name=&quot;motherjones1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2011/10/occupy-wall-street-demands-new-deal |title=Occupy Protesters' One Demand: A New New DealâWell, Maybe |publisher=Mother Jones |date=2011-10-18 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;walsh1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh |first=Joan |url=http://www.salon.com/2011/10/20/do_we_know_what_ows_wants_yet/singleton/ |title=Do we know what OWS wants yet? |publisher=Salon.com |date=2011-10-20 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/the99percentdeclaration/ |title=The99PercentDeclaration |publisher=Sites.google.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  OWS protesters that  prefer a looser, more localized set of goals have also written a document,  the [[Liberty Square Blueprint]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.freenetworkmovement.org/commons/index.php?title=Liberty_Square_Blueprint |title=Liberty Square Blueprint - The Commons |publisher=Freenetworkmovement.org |date= |accessdate=2011-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[wiki]] page edited by some 250 occupiers and still undergoing changes.

The Guardian interviewed OWS and found three main demands: get the money out of politics; reinstate the [[Glass-Steagall]] act; and draft laws against the little-known loophole that currently allows members of Congress to pass legislation affecting Delaware-based corporations in which they themselves are investors. &lt;ref&gt; Naomi Wolf.

Financial inequality (total net worth minus the value of one's home)&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Financial wealth&quot; is defined by economists as [http://www2.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/wealth.html &quot;total net worth minus the value of one's home,&quot;] including investments and other liquid assets.&lt;/ref&gt; was greater than inequality in total wealth, with the top 1% of the population owning 42.7%, the next 19% of Americans owning 50.3%, and the bottom 80% owning 7%.&lt;ref name=&quot;ForbesJacobs&quot;&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/sites/deborahljacobs/2011/11/01/occupy-wall-street-and-the-rhetoric-of-equality/ Occupy Wall Street And The Rhetoric of Equality] ''Forbes'' November 1, 2011 by Deborah L.

===Organization and group process===
[[File:Day 14 Occupy Wall Street September 30 2011 Shankbone 2.JPG|left|thumb|Protesters engaging in the '[[human microphone]]']]

The New York City General Assembly (NYCGA), held every evening at seven, is the main OWS decision-making body and provides much of the leadership and executive function for the protesters.  At its meetings the various OWS committees discuss their thoughts and needs, and the meetings are open to the public for both attendance and speaking.  The meetings are without formal leadership, although certain members routinely act as moderators. Meeting participants comment upon committee proposals using a process called a &quot;stack&quot;, which is a queue of speakers that anyone can join. New York uses what is called a [[progressive stack]], in which people from [[marginalized groups]] are sometimes allowed to speak before people from dominant groups, with [[facilitator]]s, or ''stack-keepers'', urging speakers to &quot;step forward, or step back&quot; based on which group they belong to, meaning that women and minorities may move to the front of the line, while white men must often wait for a turn to speak.&lt;ref name=&quot;SeltzNation&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Seltzer|first=Sarah|title=Where Are the Women at Occupy Wall Street?|url=http://www.truth-out.org/where-are-women-occupy-wall-street/1319895284|accessdate=11 November 2011|newspaper=The Nation|date=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Penny|first=Laura|title=Protest By Consensus|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/laurie-penny/2011/10/spain-movement-square-world|accessdate=11 November 2011|newspaper=New Statesman|date=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hinkle|first=A.

According to [[Fordham University]] communications professor [[Paul Levinson]], Occupy Wall Street and similar movements symbolize another rise of [[direct democracy]] that has not actually been seen since ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2011/1010/Does-Occupy-Wall-Street-have-leaders-Does-it-need-any| title=Does 'Occupy Wall Street' have leaders?

Ad hoc leaders discussed whether to leave. They plan for the occupation of other cities and neighborhoods, with an infrastructure to keep the movement beyond just the park. A facilitator of some of the movement's more contentious discussions, Nicole Carty, says âUsually when we think of leadership, we think of authority, but nobody has authority here,â - âPeople lead by example, stepping up when they need to and stepping back when they need to.â&lt;ref name=Crain&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20111113/ECONOMY/311139975| title=Occupy Wall Street takes a new direction| accessdate=11-13-11| publisher=Crain Communications Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''TheStreet.com'', some organizers have made more of a commitment and are more visible than others, with a core of about five main organizers being the most active.&lt;ref name=thestreet.com5leaders&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thestreet.com/story/11292354/1/5-occupy-wall-street-leaders.html| title=5 Occupy Wall Street Leaders (Update 1)| accessdate=11-14-11| publisher=TheStreet, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Funding====
Most of OWS funding comes from middle-class donors with incomes in the $50,000 to $100,000 range, and the median donation was $22.&lt;ref name=CSMprofile/&gt;  According to finance group member Pete Dutro, OWS had accumulated over $600,000 and had $450,000 remaining as of November 21, 2011. During the period that protesters were encamped in the park the funds were being used to purchase food and other necessities and to bail out fellow protesters.  In the future members of the OWS finance committee say they will initiate a process to streamline the movement and re-evaluate their budget. They may eliminate or restructure some of the &quot;working groups&quot; they no longer need on a day-to-day basis.  &quot;We have some ideas but we want to hear ideas from the other working groups,&quot; said Dutro, &quot;So we can put forward a proposal that would be fair and suit everybody's needs.&quot;  Presently the movement continues to organize out of donated office space and give money to other &quot;occupations.&quot;

According to ''The Wall Street Journal'', &quot;A few weeks ago, the Alliance for Global Justice, a Washington-based nonprofit, agreed to sponsor Occupy Wall Street and lend it its tax-exempt status, so donors could write off contributions. That means the Alliance for Global Justice's board has final say on spending, though it says it's not involved in decisions and will only step in if the protesters want to spend money on something that might violate their tax-exempt status.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;grossman1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;grossman1&quot;&gt;&quot;Protest's Money Problem.

Prior to being closed to overnight use, somewhere between 100 and 200 people slept in Zuccotti Park. Initially tents were not allowed and protesters  slept in sleeping bags or under blankets.&lt;ref name=&quot;google11&quot;/&gt; Meals were served at a cost of about $1,000 a day and some visitors ate at nearby restaurants,&lt;ref name=&quot;kadet&quot;/&gt; however local vendors  fared badly,&lt;ref name=WSJ-Vendors&gt;{{cite news|last=Oloffson|first=Kristi|title=Food Vendors Find Few Customers During Protest|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/metropolis/2011/10/12/food-vendors-find-few-customers-during-protest/|accessdate=24 October 2011|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=October 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many businesses surrounding the park were adversely affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=GIOVE|first=CANDICE|title=Occupy Wall Street costs local businesses $479,400!|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/item_Wq8d8Q0M0W98jwaQAVPvYL/|accessdate=15 November 2011|newspaper=New York Post|date=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contribution boxes collected about $5,000 a day, and supplies came in from around the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;kadet&quot;/&gt; Eric Smith, a local chef who was laid off at the [[Sheraton]] in Midtown, said that he was running a five-star restaurant in the park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan%20occu_pie_the_kitchen_PIZ7EsDJEZqzPgzzEWKX7I Protest mob is enjoying rich diet] By REBECCA ROSENBERG, New York Post, October 19, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In late-October kitchen volunteers complained about working 18 hour days to feed people who were not part of the movement and served only brown rice, simple sandwiches, and potato chips for three days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/zuccotti_hell_kitchen_i5biNyYYhpa8MSYIL9xSDL  Occupy Wall Street kitchen staff protesting fixing food for freeloaders] By Selim Algar and Bob Fredricks, New York Post, October 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The protesters constructed a [[greywater]] treatment system to recycle dishwater contaminants.&lt;ref name=&quot;businessinsider&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wired&quot;/&gt;  The filtered water was used for the park's plants and flowers.  Many protesters used the bathrooms of nearby business establishments.&lt;ref name=&quot;google10&quot;/&gt; Some supporters  donated use of their bathrooms for showers and the sanitary needs of protesters.&lt;ref name=Deprez/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ OWS Economy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204002304576631084250433462.html/|title=The Occupy Economy|last=Kadet|first=Anne|date=October 15, 2011|work=The Wall Street Journal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New York City requires a permit to use &quot;amplified sound,&quot; including electric bullhorns. Since Occupy Wall Street does not have a permit, the protesters have created the &quot;[[human microphone]]&quot; in which a speaker pauses while the nearby members of the audience repeat the phrase in unison.  The effect has been called &quot;comic or exhilaratingâoften all at once.&quot;  Some feel this has provided a further unifying effect for the crowd.&lt;ref name=&quot;We Are All Human Microphones Now&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;

In October a makeshift tent was erected, formally calling itself [[:The People's Library]], and began offering free wi-fi internet to protesters and containing over 5,000 books. The library operated [[24/7]] and used an [[honor system]] to manage returns. It offered weekly poetry readings on Friday nights, provided a reference serviced frequently staffed by professional librarians, and  procured materials available through the [[interlibrary loan]] system.&lt;ref name='NYDN 2011-10-17'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUFn8kKDwuk | title = Voices from Zuccotti: Steve Syrek, 33 | accessdate = 2011-11-20 | work = The New York Daily News | publisher = [[YouTube]] | quote = I've even got one guy who wants to help us procure any materials we want from the interlibrary loan system, which means we are a legitimate, fully functioning research library.

The library's cataloging system is accessible online at [[LibraryThing]], which donated a free lifetime membership.

But Justice Michael Stallman later ruled in favor of New York city officials and Brookfield properties, owners and developers of the privately-owned park in Lower Manhattan.

==Reaction==
===Public opinion===
National polls over October and November 2011 were mixed, with agreement/approval ratings for Occupy Wall Street varying from 59% to 22%, but approval was fairly consistently larger than disapproval, with large numbers often not giving an opinion. The age group that most strongly supports OWS are 50 to 64, rather than under 35. OWS has the strongest support among those making $50,000 to $70,000 a year, rather than under $30,000, with 27% of people making over $75,000 a year backing the movement. Managers and other professionals support the movement more than blue-collar workers, and men over 50 show the strongest support.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJPolls&quot;&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970203503204577037980400569026.html Populist Movements Rooted in Same Soil] [[The Wall Street Journal]] By GERALD F.

===Political response===
====The White House====
During an October 6 news conference, President Obama said &quot;I think it expresses the frustrations the American people feel, that we had the biggest financial crisis since the Great Depression, huge collateral damage all throughout the country ... and yet you're still seeing some of the same folks who acted irresponsibly trying to fight efforts to crack down on the abusive practices that got us into this in the first place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama news conference: Obama: Occupy Wall Street protests show Americans' frustration&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama acknowledges Wall Street protests as a sign&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama Speaks on Occupy Wall Street Oct 6&quot;/&gt; When [[Jake Tapper]] of ABC News pushed Obama to explain the fact that his administration hasn't prosecuted any Wall Street executives who didn't play by the rules, he replied, &quot;One of the biggest problems about the collapse of Lehman's and the subsequent financial crisis and the whole subprime lending fiasco is that a lot of that stuff wasn't necessarily illegal; it was just immoral or inappropriate or reckless.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wall Street Corruption, Solyndra, and Fast &amp; Furious: Today's Q's for O&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama: Not all pre-crisis financial ploys illegal&quot;/&gt; On October 18, when interviewed by ABC news, he said &quot;in some ways, theyâre not that different from some of the protests that we saw coming from the Tea Party.

They feel that their institutions arenât looking out for them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2011/10/obama-occupy-wall-street-not-that-different-from-tea-party-protests |title=Obama: Occupy Wall Street âNot That Differentâ From Tea Party Protests - ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=|accessdate=October 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.yahoo.com/obama-occupy-wall-street-not-different-tea-party-171041906.html |title=Obama: Occupy Wall Street 'Not That Different' From Tea Party Protests - Yahoo!

Vice President [[Joe Biden]] likened the protest to the Tea Party's similar anger at the banks, saying, &quot;Look guys the bargain is not on the level anymore in the minds of the vast majority of the American (people) the middle class has been screwed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;oliphant&quot;/&gt;

====Congress====
[[File:Eric Cantor.jpg|thumb|House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Virginia|Va]]), at the Values Voter Summit]]
[[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Democratic Leader Rep.]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], said she supports the growing nationwide Occupy Wall Street movement. Pelosi said she includes herself in the group of Americans dissatisfied with [[United States Congress|Congress]] and stated, &quot;I support the message to the establishment, whether it's Wall Street or the political establishment and the rest, that change has to happen. We cannot continue in a way (that) is not relevant to their lives.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pelosi Supports Occupy Wall Street Movement&quot;/&gt;

[[Independent (politician)|Independent]] Senator [[Bernie Sanders]] of Vermont, who [[Congressional caucus|caucuses]] with the [[Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate|Democratic Party]], appeared on ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'' and supported the protests saying, &quot;We desperately need a coming together of working people to stand up to Wall Street. We need to rebuild the middle-class in this country and you guys can't have it all.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olbermann&quot;/&gt;

[[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Virginia|Va]]), in a speech to a Values Voter Summit, characterized the movement as &quot;growing mobs&quot; and said that Obama's &quot;failed policies&quot; and rhetoric &quot;condon[ing] the pitting of Americans against Americans&quot; were to blame. In response, White House Press Secretary [[Jay Carney]] accused Cantor of &quot;unbound&quot; hypocrisy, given the Majority Leader's support of the Tea Party protests, adding, &quot;I don't understand why one man's mob is another man's democracy.&quot; Carney characterized both movements as examples of American democratic traditions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obama, Cantor spar over Occupy Wall Street&quot;/&gt;

The Democratic co-chairs of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], [[United States House of Representatives|Representatives]] [[RaÃºl Grijalva]] and [[Keith Ellison]], announced their solidarity with the movement on October 4.&lt;ref name=&quot;house&quot;/&gt; The [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] is asking for 100,000 names on its website which will subsequently be added to 100,000 letters to [[Speaker of the House]] [[John Boehner]] and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor expressing support for the Occupy Wall Street protesters, the middle class, and opposition to tax [[loopholes]] for millionaires and [[big oil]].&lt;ref name=&quot;DCCC1&quot;/&gt;

U.S. Congressman and [[Ron Paul presidential campaign, 2012|2012 Republican presidential candidate]] [[Ron Paul]] (R-TX) stated, &quot;If they were demonstrating peacefully, and making a point, and arguing our case, and drawing attention to the FedâI would say, 'good!'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thehill&quot;/&gt; In a GOP debate, mentioning the ongoing âOccupy Wall Streetâ protesters, he stated that crony capitalists are those âthat benefit from contract from government, benefit from the Federal Reserve, benefit from all the bailouts.

Former [[Herman Cain presidential campaign, 2012|2012 Republican presidential candidate]] [[Herman Cain]] accused the movement of being &quot;[[Anti-capitalism|anti-capitalist]]&quot; and argued &quot;Don't blame Wall Street, don't blame the big banks, if you don't have a job and you're not rich, blame yourself!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;abcnews&quot;/&gt; In an interview with the ''Wall Street Journal'', Cain also expressed his belief that Occupy Wall Street was &quot;planned and orchestrated to distract from the failed policies of the Obama administration,&quot; but admitted that he &quot;[didn't] have facts&quot; to back up his accusation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Herman Cain: I'm More Than the 'Anti-Romney'&quot;/&gt; 

Former Speaker of the House of Representatives and [[Newt Gingrich presidential campaign, 2012|2012 Republican presidential candidate]] [[Newt Gingrich]] was quoted as saying at the 2012 Bloomberg/Washington Post Debate, &quot;Let me draw a distinction. Virtually every American has a reason to be angry. I think virtually [every] American has a reason to be worried. I think the people who are protesting in Wall Street break into two groups: one is left-wing agitators who would be happy to show up next week on any other topic, and the other is sincere middle-class people who frankly are very close to the Tea Party people who care. And actually... you can tell which are which. The people who are decent, responsible citizens pick up after themselves. The people who are just out there as activists trash the place and walk off and are proud of having trashed it, so letâs draw that distinction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/11/newt-gingrich-dodd-frank-occupy-wall-street-debate_n_1006165.html |title=Newt Gingrich On Occupy Wall Street: Barney Frank, Chris Dodd Should Go To Jail (VIDEO) |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 21, Gingrich was quoted as saying to the protesters that they should &quot;Go get a job right after you take a bath.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/11/21/gingrich-to-occupy-go-get-a-job-right-after-you-take-a-bath-video/#ixzz1eNnrCG1N |title=Newt Gingrich &amp;#124; Occupy Wall Street &amp;#124; Take A Bath |publisher=The Daily Caller |date= |accessdate=2011-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Buddy Roemer presidential campaign, 2012|2012 Republican presidential candidate]] [[Buddy Roemer]] expressed support for the movement, saying, &quot;We have almost permanent unemployment. They say itâs nine percent, but the real unemployment rate is more like 16 percent. These are people there are no jobs for, or they have to work part time to try to make ends meet. Itâs disturbing. The Wall Street protest is unshaped, unfocused, but thereâs a lot of power in it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roemer&quot;/&gt;

Mayor Bloomberg said that the protests &quot;aren't productive,&quot; although he also expressed sympathy for some of their complaints.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupy Wall Street protesters running out of space&quot;/&gt; On October 8, during his weekly radio show, Bloomberg complained that the protesters are trying to &quot;take the jobs from the people working in the city,&quot; and said that although &quot;[t]here are some people with legitimate complaints, there are some people who just like to protest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Post Bloomberg article&quot;/&gt;

In an interview with ''[[The Washington Post]]'', Former Democratic U.S. Senator [[Russ Feingold]] endorsed the movement on October 5 stating, &quot;This is like the Tea Partyâonly it's real... By the time this is over, it will make the Tea Party look like ... a tea party.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;washingtonpost&quot;/&gt; Former [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] and [[Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] declared that the demonstrations of the OWS movement were &quot;as American as apple pie,&quot; adding &quot;âThis is something that our political leaders need to think about.

===Labor unions===

In September, various [[Trade union|labor unions]], including the [[Transport Workers Union of America]] Local 100 and the New York Metro 32BJ [[Service Employees International Union]], pledged their support for demonstrators.&lt;ref name=&quot;union support&quot;/&gt;  
Union leaders say that unions and OWS can offer mutual support, with OWS gaining from the union's money, stature, and large membership, and the weakened labor movement absorbing the protesters vitality.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/06/nyregion/major-unions-join-occupy-wall-street-protest.html?pagewanted=all Seeking Energy, Unions Join Protest Against Wall Street] By STEVEN GREENHOUSE and CARA BUCKLEY, October 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-OWS-background&quot;&gt;[http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/o/occupy_wall_street/index.html?inline=nyt-org Times Topics], Occupy Wall Street background, retrieved November 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] announced on September 28, 2011, that its General Executive Board (GEB), and the General Defense Committee (GDC) had issued statements of support for Occupy Wall Street.&lt;ref&gt;IWW.org Editor, &quot;IWW Endorses Occupy Wall Street,&quot; http://www.iww.org/en/content/iww-endorses-occupy-wall-street retrieved October 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;IWW.org Editor, &quot;IWW General Defense Committee Statement in Support of Occupy Wall Street,&quot; http://www.iww.org/en/content/iww-general-defense-committee-statement-support-occupy-wall-street retrieved October 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; After numerous arrests of protesters on the Brooklyn Bridge, police commandeered city buses to pick up detained protesters and union drivers later sued the New York Police Department.  Union President John Samuelsen said, &quot;We're down with these protesters. We support the notion that rich folk are not paying their fair share. Our bus operators are not going to be pressed into service to arrest protesters anywhere&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;AP-Hawley-10032011&quot;/&gt;  On October 4, representatives from more than 14 of the country's largest labor unions joined the protesters for a mass rally and march.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupy Wall Street Protests: Police Make Numerous Arrests&quot;/&gt; In early November, [[National Nurses United]] (NNU), the largest union of registered nurses in the nation, expressed support for OWS and rallied in front of the White House and Department of Treasury.  Karen Higgins, co-president of NNU, said, &quot;A real finance tax would generate $350 billion a year in the U.S. alone and bring relief to families out of homes, friends out of work, patients out of care, communities running out of time.  The tax starts a revenue flow back to the 99 percent.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nurses |first=National |url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/11/03/4029485/nurses-from-four-continents-urge.html |title=Nurses from Four Continents Urge Global Finance Tax; &quot;We Are Running Out of Time&quot; - PR Newswire |publisher=sacbee.com |date=2011-11-03 |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Noting the growing union support, an article in the progressive-leaning ''[[Mother Jones magazine|Mother Jones]]'' magazine said that union support could splinter and derail the protests rather than sustain them because while unions are tightly organized, hierarchical, and run with a clear chain of command, Occupy Wall Street is the opposite in that they are &quot;a horizontal, autonomous, leaderless, modified-consensus-based system with roots in anarchist thought.&quot;  However, the article went on to suggest that if the unions and OWS joined together they could work to create a progressive movement that &quot;effectively taps into the rising feeling among many Americans that economic opportunity has been squashed by corporate greed and the influence of the very rich in politics.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupy Wall Street, Powered by Big Labor&quot;/&gt;  As the success of the movement has become apparent, union organizers have begun to embrace some of their social media skills, bold tactics, and the simplicity of the 99% slogan. Damon Silvers, the [[AFLâCIO]]'s policy director, said, âWe think the Occupy movement has given voice to something very basic about whatâs going on in our country right now.  The fact that theyâve figured out certain concepts and language for doing that, we think is really important and positive.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/business/occupy-movement-inspires-unions-to-embrace-bold-tactics.html | work=The New York Times | first=Steven | last=Greenhouse | title=Occupy Movement Inspires Unions to Embrace Bold Tactics | date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW) has endorsed the movement saying, &quot;We recognize the need to work together and learn from each other.

===Federal Reserve===
During a hearing before the Joint Economic Committee October 4, 2011, [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] said, &quot;[P]eople are quite unhappy with the state of the economy and whatâs happening. They blame, with some justification, the problems in the financial sector for getting us into this mess, and theyâre dissatisfied with the policy response here in Washington. And at some level, I canât blame them. Certainly, 9 percent unemployment and very slow growth is not a good situation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;thinkprogress&quot;/&gt; Dallas Federal Reserve President [[Richard W.

We have a very [[Income inequality in the United States|uneven distribution of income]]. We have a very frustrated people, and I can understand their frustration.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;reuters&quot;/&gt;
[[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] commented about protester's blame of the Fed saying: &quot;âThe concerns about the Fed are based on misconceptions, A very simplistic interpretation of that [criticism] was that we were doing that because we wanted to preserve banker salaries. That was obviously not the case.â Bernanke has stated that policies aimed at boosting the economy will continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/801-economy/191415-bernanke-takes-on-critics-defends-fed-efforts-to-boost-economy| title=Bernanke takes on Occupy Wall Street| accessdate=11-11-11| publisher=Capitol Hill Publishing Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following Wednesday, ''[[The New York Observer]]'' reported on the nascent protests in Zuccotti Park.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupy Wall Street's Media Problems&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;The Wall Street Protesters: What the Hell Do They Want?&quot;/&gt;  On Friday, September 23, Ginia Bellafante panned the movement in ''The New York Times''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gunning For Wall Street, With Faulty Aim&quot;/&gt;  Joanna Weiss of ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' found it difficult to take the protests seriously, criticizing Occupy Wall Street for its &quot;circus&quot; atmosphere.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;The right way to get heard&quot;/&gt; In a September 27 article, Lauren Ellis of ''Mother Jones'' magazine criticized the movement's lack of a clear message.&lt;ref name=&quot;ellis&quot;/&gt;

By October 4, economist [[Richard D.

MSNBC's ''Technolog'' noted that policymakers had failed to address economic problems, and news media had failed to cover the unemployment crisis: &quot;Tracking CNN, MSNBC and Fox, ThinkProgress found 7,583 mentions of the word 'debt,' compared to 427 mentions of 'unemployment' on all three networks combined.&quot; [[Nielsen Online|NM Incite]] said 22% of [[Twitter|tweets]] using the #OccupyWallStreet [[hashtag]] voiced general support for the movement, 11% indicated participation in it,&lt;!-- we should measure this in terms of what it means for the number of tweeters who say they are participating --&gt; 5% described celebrity support, 11% were complaints against the movement, 13% shared news, 6% shared videos, 4% blamed government, 2% blamed Obama, and 1% blamed capitalism.

===Police response===

Police reaction has varied. Some incidents have been criticized. The [[New York City Police Department]] has assigned Rick Lee, a First Precinct community relations detective, to duty at the demonstration. He is one of the department's main liaisons with the protesters on behalf of the police department, and advises protesters on such matters as, avoiding arrest and getting along with police as well as attempting to get information of protesters plans. As a plainclothes officer, he has been referred to as the &quot;hipster cop&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gq.com/style/profiles/201110/hipster-cop-rick-lee-interview-occupy-wall-street| title=The Hipster Cop: An Occupy Wall Street Conversation| accessdate=11-10-11| publisher=gq.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his attire consisting of glasses, cardigan sweaters, skinny ties and skinny trousers.

Arrests and crimes have risen, while the number of summonses has fallen. How dangerous it may be for Occupy Wall Street protesters and nearby residents is difficult to assess due to an informal divide that has sprung up between who patrols inside and outside the park. While NYC police are stationed around the periphery, police seem to have ceded patrol of the interior to protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/09/nyregion/at-occupy-wall-street-protest-rising-concern-about-crime.html?_r=1| title=At Scene of Wall St. Protest, Rising Concerns About Crime| accessdate=11-11-11| publisher=New York times| first1=Cara| last1=Buckley| first2=Matt| last2=Flegenheimer| date=November 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[India]]n Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] stated, &quot;There are reasons why people are protesting.

[[File:Naomi Klein Occupy Wall Street 2011 Shankbone 2.JPG|thumb|left|[[Naomi Klein]] leading an open forum on October 6]]
[[Kate Pickett]], coauthor of ''[[The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better]],'' said in [[The Guardian]] that &quot;Few doubt that it was the actions of the rich and the super-rich, the 1%, that created the crisis.  But sadly, debate has not yet been translated into action...This is why we need the Occupy movement and the staunch actions of the trade unions â why we need protest and demonstrations and activism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2011/nov/15/occupy-equality-kate-pickett?newsfeed=true We need Occupy to help deliver equality] by Kate Pickett in the Guardian, Tuesday 15 November 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian writer [[Naomi Klein]] has spoken at the protest several times.  Writing in the New York Times she said she is &quot;delighted&quot; that OWS has not given in to issuing a list of demands. &quot;This is a young movement still in the process of determining just how powerful it is, and that power will determine what demands are possible. Small movements have to settle for small reforms: big ones have the freedom to dream.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/roomfordebate/2011/10/06/can-occupy-wall-street-spark-a-revolution/occupy-wall-st-learns-from-globalization-protests |title=Occupy Wall St. Learns From Globalization Protests - Room for Debate |publisher=NYTimes.com |date=2011-10-06 |accessdate=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor and author [[Cornel West]] addressed the frustrations that some critics have expressed at the protestâs lack of a clear and unified message, saying, &quot;Itâs impossible to translate the issue of the greed of Wall Street into one demand, or two demands. Weâre talking about a democratic awakening.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Goodman2&quot;/&gt;

Philosopher [[Slavoj Å½iÅ¾ek]] gave a speech on Wall Street in which he expressed support for the protests saying, &quot;They tell you we are dreamers. The true dreamers are those who think things can go on indefinitely the way they are. We are not dreamers. We are awakening from a dream which is turning into a nightmare.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;24ur&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLAVOJ ZIZEK AT OWS PART1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SLAVOJ ZIZEK AT OWS PART2&quot;/&gt;

On November 15, when police closed the park to overnight use by the protesters, [[Chris Hedges]], who has been participating since the onset, wrote in his weekly column  that he believed that through a rigid adherence to nonviolence and a verbal respect for the police, the movement would continue to move forward to see the realization of its goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.truthdig.com/report/item/this_is_what_revolution_looks_like_20111115/ |title=Chris Hedges: This Is What Revolution Looks Like - Chris Hedges' Columns |publisher=Truthdig |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author [[Barbara Ehrenreich]], in response to the dismantling of the occupations, stated that &quot;One of the appalling things here is that there are so many Democratic mayors involved in these crackdowns or in Bloomberg's case, someone who is seen as a liberal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/nov/15/barbara-ehrenreich-occupy-wall-street Ehrenreich: Democratic establishment abandoned Occupy Wall Street] ''[[The Guardian]]''.

===Criticism===
{{POV section|New_version_of_text_summarizing_how_RS_have_characterized_criticism_of_OWS|date=December 2011}}
There has been criticism of the Occupy Wall Street movement by various groups and individuals. According to recent polling, most Republican voters have an unfavorable view of the movement by a large margin.&lt;ref name=&quot;QuinnipiacNov3&quot;/&gt;

In an opinion piece in the ''Wall Street Journal'', pollster [[Douglas Schoen]] wrote that the protesters reflect &quot;values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American people&quot; and have &quot;a deep commitment to left-wing policies: opposition to free-market capitalism and support for radical redistribution of wealth, intense regulation of the private sector, and protectionist policies to keep American jobs from going overseas,&quot; and that politicians who support them will be hurt in the 2012 elections.&lt;ref name=&quot;WSJ-Schoen&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052970204479504576637082965745362.html |title=Polling the Occupy Wall Street Crowd |first=Douglas |last=Schoen |date=18 |month=October |year=2011 |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |quote=Last week, senior White House adviser David Plouffe said that &quot;the protests you're seeing are the same conversations people are having in living rooms and kitchens all across America. . . . People are frustrated by an economy that does not reward hard work and responsibility, where Wall Street and Main Street don't seem to play by the same set of rules.&quot; Nancy Pelosi and others have echoed the message.  Yet the Occupy Wall Street movement reflects values that are dangerously out of touch with the broad mass of the American peopleâand particularly with swing voters who are largely independent and have been trending away from the president since the debate over health-care reform.  The protesters have a distinct ideology and are bound by a deep commitment to radical left-wing policies. On Oct. 10 and 11, Arielle Alter Confino, a senior researcher at my polling firm, interviewed nearly 200 protesters in New York's Zuccotti Park. Our findings probably represent the first systematic random sample of Occupy Wall Street opinion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[David Weigel]] responded in an opinion piece published on [[Slate]] characterizing Schoen's opinion piece as &quot;a dishonest column full of claims that couldn't be backed up by his own research&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Slate-Weigel&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/11/10/doug_schoen_the_official_anti_spokesman_of_occupy_wall_street.html |title=Doug Schoen, the Official Anti-Spokesman of Occupy Wall Street |first=Weigel |last=David |date=10 |month=November |year=2011 |publisher=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''Washington Monthly'' lead blogger [[Steve Benen]] wrote an opinion piece accusing Schoen of political spin in his analysis and referring to Schoen, a frequent contributor to Fox News, as &quot;the quintessential 'Fox News Democrat'&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;WM-Benen&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/political-animal/2011_10/doug_schoen_isnt_helping_his_r032892.php# |title=Doug Schoen isn't helping his reputation|first=Benen |last=Steve |date=18 |month=October |year=2011 |publisher=Washington Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mike Brownfield of [[The Heritage Foundation]] argued that rejection of the capitalist system and the policies that OWS protesters advocate, including limits on trade and student loan forgiveness, would not lead to improved economic conditions for unemployed Americans. According to Brownfield, the Foundation believes it is &quot;right to decry out-of-control bailouts and corporate subsidies&quot; and there are valid concerns regarding the economy, unemployment rates and low job creation. However, Heritage argued that capitalism is key to improving the economy and that the movement is focusing on the wrong solutions to the problems they protest: it should be protesting the expansion of government instead of calling for more government intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.heritage.org/2011/10/18/morning-bell-wall-street-is-the-wrong-place-to-occupy/ |title=Morning Bell: Wall Street is the Wrong Place to Occupy |last1=Brownfield |first1=Mike |date=October 18, 2011 |work=blog.heritage.org |publisher=The Heritage Foundation |accessdate=October 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Day 14 Occupy Wall Street September 30 2011 Shankbone 11.JPG|thumb|left|Protesters dance in front of drummers at the protest]]
Some residents of the area surrounding Zuccotti Park have voiced complaints about the demonstrations. A caller to a radio show complained that the park has been rendered &quot;unusable&quot; by the protesters, and that &quot;a general atmosphere of incivility,&quot; together with loud shouting and drums, prevailed; another complained that the drums from the protest, which he said &quot;start in the morning&quot; and get louder in the evening until 11:30&amp;nbsp;pm, made it difficult for his children to sleep or do their homework. Another resident complained that protesters had been vandalizing and urinating in the vestibule to his apartment building.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Post Bloomberg article&quot;/&gt;  Responding to a caller to his radio show complaining about noise and incivility at the park, Mayor Michael Bloomberg said &quot;we couldn't agree more.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Post Bloomberg article&quot;/&gt; The Mayor has been criticized for alienating both supporters and critics for his stance that seems supportive of the protests one day and opposed on others.

Thieves also stole $2500 of donations that were stored in a makeshift kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/manhattan/criminal_occupation_oh3CnKANUqYHrGPCaZaLRK |title=Thieves preying on fellow protesters |publisher=www.nypost.com |date=October 18, 2011 |first1=Larry |last1=Celona}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 10, a &quot;methadone-addled man freeloading off the Wall Street protest&quot; was arrested for groping a woman.&lt;ref name=&quot;nypost1&quot;/&gt; On Nov 10, 2011, A man was arrested at OWS for breaking an [[Emergency medical technician|EMT]]'s leg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siegal |first=Ida |url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Occupy-Wall-Street-EMT-Assaulted-Zuccotti-Park-Arrest-133613788.html |title=Man Arrested for Breaking EMT's Leg at Occupy Wall Street |publisher=NBC New York |date= |accessdate=2011-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chronology==
{{main|Timeline of Occupy Wall Street}}

=== First four weeks (September 17 â October 14) ===
[[File:Wallst14occupy.jpg|left|thumb|Protesters rallying near New York police headquarters, [[St. Andrew's Church (New York City)|St. Andrew's Church]] in the background.]]
On September 17, 1,000 protesters marched through the streets, with an estimated 100 to 200 staying overnight in cardboard boxes.  By September 19, seven people had been arrested.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYPD Arrest Seven Wall Street Protesters&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;businessweek1&quot;/&gt;{{anchor|Anthony Bologna}}
At least 80 arrests were made on September 24,&lt;ref name=&quot;arrests&quot;/&gt; after protesters started marching uptown and forcing the closure of several streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;crackdown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;times2&quot;/&gt; Most of the 80 arrests were for blocking traffic, though some were also charged with [[disorderly conduct]] and resisting arrest. Police officers used a technique called [[kettling]] which involves using orange nets to isolate protesters into smaller groups.&lt;ref name=crackdown/&gt;&lt;ref name=times2/&gt;  Videos which showed several penned-in female demonstrators being hit with [[pepper spray]] by a police official were widely disseminated, sparking controversy.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews0929&quot;/&gt; That police official was identified as [[Inspector#United States|Deputy Inspector]] Anthony Bologna, and other videos imerged showing him hitting a photographer with a burst of spray as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt0928&quot;/&gt;

The activist [[Anonymous]] subsequently published the name, phone number and family details of the police officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Karen McVeigh in New York |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/sep/26/occupy-wall-street-police-named |title=Occupy Wall Street activists name officer over pepper spray incident &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= September 26, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-05 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Initially Police Commissioner [[Raymond W. Kelly]] and a representative for Bologna defended his actions, while decrying the disclosure of his personal information.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews0929&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt0928&quot;/&gt; After growing public furor, Kelly announced that [[Internal affairs (law enforcement)|Internal Affairs]] and the Civilian Complaint Review Board were opening investigations,&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews0929&quot;/&gt; again criticizing Anonymous for &quot;[trying] to intimidate, putting the names of children, where children go to school,&quot; and adding that this tactic was &quot;totally inappropriate, despicable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dailynews0929&quot;/&gt; Meanwhile, Manhattan [[District Attorney]] [[Cyrus Vance, Jr.]] started his own inquiry.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt0928&quot;/&gt;

Public attention to the pepper-sprayings resulted in a spike of news media coverage, a pattern that was to be repeated in the coming weeks following confrontations with police.&lt;ref name=&quot;five38&quot;/&gt; [[Clyde Haberman]], writing in ''The New York Times'', said that &quot;If the Occupy Wall Street protesters ever choose to recognize a person who gave their cause its biggest boost, they may want to pay tribute to Anthony Bologna,&quot; calling the event &quot;vital&quot; for the still nascent movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt1012&quot;/&gt; &quot;After Ron Kuby, an attorney for one of the protesters, demanded Mr. Bolognaâs arrest, [Bologna] was instead docked 10 vacation days and given a [...] reassignment to Staten Island, where he lives,&quot; according to an account by blogger Daniel Edward Rosen.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Daniel Edward, [http://www.observer.com/2011/11/is-ray-kellys-nypd-spinning-out-of-control/?show=all &quot;Is Ray Kellyâs NYPD Spinning Out of Control?&quot;], ''The [New York] Observer'', 11/01/2011 6:39pm. 2011-11-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 1, 2011, protesters set out to march across the [[Brooklyn Bridge]]. ''The New York Times'' reported that more than 700 arrests were made.&lt;ref name=&quot;Police Arrest More Than 700 Protesters on Brooklyn Bridge&quot;/&gt; The police used ten buses to carry protesters off the bridge. Some said the police had tricked protesters, allowing them onto the bridge, and even escorting them partway across.  Jesse A. Myerson, a media coordinator for Occupy Wall Street said, âThe cops watched and did nothing, indeed, seemed to guide us onto the roadway.â&lt;ref name=&quot;Police Arrest More Than 400 Protesters on Brooklyn Bridge&quot;/&gt;  However, some statements by protesters supported descriptions of the event given by police: for example, one protester Tweeted that &quot;The police didn't lead us on to the bridge.

On October 5, thousands of union workers joined protesters marching through the Financial District. The march was mostly peaceful until after nightfall, when scuffles erupted. About 200 protesters tried to storm barricades blocking them from Wall Street and the Stock Exchange. Police responded with pepper spray and penned the protesters in with orange netting.&lt;ref name=&quot;Occupy Wall Street protests: Police make arrests, use pepper spray as some activists storm barricade&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian13&quot;/&gt;

Half an hour into the police removal, the Occupy Wall Street Media Team put out an official statement under the heading, &quot;You can't evict an idea whose time has come.&quot; It went on to say, &quot;Some politicians may physically remove us from public spaces â our spaces â and, physically, they may succeed.

:&quot;New York City police officers dressed in riot gear, handed out a written notice to the protesters telling them where their personal articles from the encampment could be retrieved, which sounds lovely until you saw what they were doing to the protesters` personal belongings. There were reports that police use knives to cut up the sturdy military-grade tents that were the best hope of surviving winter down there.

After the removal, New York City officials ordered police to keep the entire park closed and to prevent any protesters from returning, pending the outcome of a court hearing on whether and in what circumstances the protesters could return; a judge issued a temporary restraining order that protesters could return to the park with their tents, which ''Washington Post'' opinion writer James Downie accused Mayor Bloomberg of ignoring.&lt;ref&gt;''The Washington Post'', 2011 Nov. 15, &quot;Bloombergâs Disgraceful Eviction of Occupy Wall Street,&quot; http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-partisan/post/bloombergs-disgraceful-eviction-of-occupy-wall-street/2011/11/15/gIQASRiqON_blog.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Newman |first=Andy |url=http://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/11/15/updates-on-the-clearing-of-zuccotti-park/?src=twt&amp;twt=cityroom#judge-says-protesters-can-return-to-park-for-now |title=Updates on the Clearing of Zuccotti Park - NYTimes.com |location=New York City;Zuccotti Park (NYC) |publisher=Cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com |date= November 15, 2011|accessdate=2011-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; A judge in the late afternoon ruled that the temporary order should not be extended, saying that the First Amendment did not give protesters the right to fill the park with &quot;tents, structures, generators, and other installations to the exclusion of the owner's reasonable rights and duties to maintain Zuccotti Park.&quot;&lt;ref name=RestrainingOrderVacated&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/11/15/us/new-york-occupy-eviction/index.html?hpt=hp_t1 |title=New York court upholds eviction of &quot;Occupy&quot; protesters |author=CNN Wire Staff |date=November 15, 2011 |publisher=www.cnn.com |accessdate=November 15, 2011 |quote= A New York Supreme Court has ruled not to extend a temporary restraining order that prevented the eviction of &quot;Occupy&quot; protesters who were encamped at Zuccotti Park, considered a home-base for demonstrators.
Police in riot gear cleared out the protesters early Tuesday morning, a move that attorneys for the loosely defined group say was unlawful.
But Justice Michael Stallman later ruled in favor of New York city officials and Brookfield properties, owners and developers of the privately-owned park in Lower Manhattan.
The order does not prevent protesters from gathering in the park, but says their First Amendment rights not do include remaining there, &quot;along with their tents, structures, generators, and other installations to the exclusion of the owner's reasonable rights and duties to maintain Zuccotti Park.&quot;}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/16/nyregion/police-begin-clearing-zuccotti-park-of-protesters.html?pagewanted=3&amp;_r=1 Police Clear Zuccotti Park of Protesters] ''The New York Times''. 15 Nov 2011.

&lt;ref name=&quot;cjr9&quot;&gt;&quot;as the protest has grown, the media team has been busy coordinating, notably through the âunofficial,â Occupytogether.org. Itâs a hub for all Occupy-inspired happenings and updates, a key part of the internal communications network for the Occupy demonstrations. While sitting in the media tent I saw several Skype sessions with other demonstrators. At one point a bunch of people gathered around a computer shouting, âHey Scotland!â Members of the media team also maintain a livestream, and keep a steady flow of updates on Twitter, Facebook, and Tumblr.&quot; [http://www.cjr.org/the_news_frontier/occupy_wall_streets_media_team.php &quot;Occupy Wall Streetâs Media Team], Columbia Journalism Review's New Frontier Database, October 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
