'''612 ABC Brisbane''' ([[callsign]]: '''4QR''') is an [[ABC Local Radio]] [[radio station|station]] in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]]. It is one of the largest stations in the network, serving as a base for [[Queensland]] programming - many programs are broadcast across the ABC Local Radio network in regional and rural areas of Queensland when those stations are not carrying local programming.

The 2012 on-air team includes [[Spencer Howson]], [[Steve Austin (Australian broadcaster)|Steve Austin]], Kelly Higgins-Devine, Tim Cox and Rebecca Levingstone. Past presenters have included [[Richard Fidler]], Madonna King, Peter Dick, Rod Henshaw, Andrew Carroll and Susan Mitchell.

==History==
{{main|History of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation}}
Radio broadcasting began in Brisbane in 1925 when the [[Government of Queensland]] commenced its own broadcasting operations with the callsign 4QG - 4 denoted the state of [[Queensland]]; QG stood for ''Queensland Government''. 4QG became a part of the ABC's radio network at its inception in 1932.

The ABC started a second Brisbane station on January 7, 1938 using the callsign 4QR - the new station carried national programming while 4QG aired mainly local content. 4QG is now part of the ABC's [[Radio National]] network - as such it now has the callsign ''4RN'', in common with all other Radio National services in Queensland.

Until December 2006, 612 ABC Brisbane's studios were located on Coronation Drive in the Brisbane inner-city suburb of [[Toowong, Queensland|Toowong]] (a location severely damaged by water in the 1974 Brisbane floods).

A number of [[breast cancer]] cases at the ABC's [[Toowong]] studios led to the permanent evacuation of the entire site in December, 2006. 350 staff, from ABC [[television]], [[radio]] and [[online]], were relocated. The station broadcast from the ABC's [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] studios during the relocation period.

In September 2006, 612 ABC Brisbane was &quot;host radio broadcaster&quot; for naturalist [[Steve Irwin]]'s memorial service at [[Australia Zoo]], [[Beerwah, Queensland|Beerwah]].   Breakfast announcers [[Spencer Howson]] (from 612 ABC Brisbane) and John Stokes (from the ABC's [[Sunshine Coast, Queensland|Sunshine Coast]] station [[90.3 ABC Coast FM|Coast FM]]) were chosen to host the broadcast, made available to radio stations around the world.

==The Morning Show==
The show currently runs from 8:30am until 11:00am with the first 30 minutes devoted to the main news stories of the day. Prime Ministers, Premiers and other politicians will lobby to be interviewed in this first half hour.

After 9:00am talkback callers are encouraged to contribute to the day's debate.

However, The Morning Show has proved almost as controversial as the stories normally covered on the local current affairs show.  Several people have presented the show over the years with their departure often making headlines.

Recent presenters have been Madonna King (2006 - 11), [[Steve Austin (Australian broadcaster)|Steve Austin]] (2004-5), Kirsten Macgregor (2003), Susan Mitchell (2002), Andrew Carroll (2000-1), Cathy Border (2000), John Barton, Carolyn Tucker (1999), Anna Reynolds and Rod Henshaw.

In 2002, the ABC was forced to apologise to [[Andrew Carroll]] and admit he was unfairly sacked (See [http://www.abc.net.au/corp/pubs/media/s690457.htm Media Release]). Carroll was taken off-air after commenting, during an interview with [[Queensland]] Premier [[Peter Beattie]], that he would have to &quot;reconsider the terms of his contract&quot; (or similar).  Carroll's story was featured on the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s own media watchdog program [http://www.abc.net.au/mediawatch/transcripts/200502_s3.htm Media Watch].

In October 2011, King announced that she would be leaving the station to spend more time with her children. In December 2011, [[Steve Austin (Australian broadcaster)|Steve Austin]] was announced as King's replacement.
