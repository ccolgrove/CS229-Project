==History==
SIU baseball started as a club sport in 1921, lasting until 1924. From 1925 until 1946, the school did not have a baseball program.

In 1947, [[Glenn Martin (coach)|Abe Martin]] revived the program as an intercollegiate sport and it has remained ever since, being an elite program in the late 1960s through the 1980s.

SIU plays its home games at [[Abe Martin Field]] but also occasionally plays home games at [[Rent One Park]] in nearby [[Marion, IL|Marion]], home of the [[Frontier League|Frontier League's]] [[Southern Illinois Miners]].

==SIU in the NCAA tournament==
SIU has a proud history in the NCAA Baseball Tournament, held at [[Johnny Rosenblatt Stadium]] in [[Omaha, NE|Omaha]] since 1950. They have made the [[College World Series]] 5 times and finished as the national champion runner-up twice, losing out to the [[USC Trojans baseball|University of Southern California]] [[USC Trojans|Trojans]] both times, as well as two third place finishes.
