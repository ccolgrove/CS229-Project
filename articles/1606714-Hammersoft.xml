'''Wine labels''' are important sources of information for consumers since they tell the type and origin of the wine. The [[label]] is often the only resource a buyer has for evaluating the [[wine]] before purchasing it. Certain information is ordinarily included in the wine label, such as the country of origin, quality, type of wine, alcoholic degree, producer, bottler, or importer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;&gt;George, Rosemary, ''The Simon &amp; Schuster Pocket Wine Label Decoder'', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information provided==
===Label design===
Some wineries place great importance on the label design while others do not. There are wineries that have not changed their label's design in over 60 years, as in the case of [[ChÃ¢teau Simone]], while others hire designers every year to change it. Labels may include images of works by [[Picasso]], [[Chagall]], and other artists, and these may be collector's pieces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; The elegance of the label does not determine the wine's quality. Instead, it is the information contained within the label that can provide consumers with such knowledge.

Most New World consumers, and increasingly European consumers, prefer to purchase wine with varietal labels and/or with brand name labels. A recent study of younger wine drinkers in the U.S. found that they perceived labels with chÃ¢teaux on them to be stuffy or old-fashioned. Producers often attempt to make selecting and purchasing wine easy and non-intimidating by making their labels playful and inviting.&lt;ref&gt;Franson, Paul. Labels gone wild. ''Wine Enthusiast'', 2006 (March), ''19(3)'', 28-33.&lt;/ref&gt; The financial success of New World wine attributed to striking label designs has led some European producers to follow suit, as in the case of the redesign of [[Mouton Cadet]].&lt;ref name=dw&gt;{{cite web|last= Benady |first= David, ''Design Week'' |title= Wine label branding off the shelf |url=http://www.designweek.co.uk/Articles/137951/Wine+label+branding+off+the+shelf.html |date= March 19, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Differences by country===
Wine classification systems differ by country. Wines can be classified by region and area only. For example, there are 151 chÃ¢teaux in [[Bordeaux]] with &quot;Figeac&quot; and 22 estates in [[Burgundy (region)|Burgundy]] with &quot;Corton&quot; on their labels. In Burgundy, there are 110 appellations in an area only one-fifth the size of Bordeaux. Complicating the system is the fact that it is common for villages to append the name of their most famous vineyard to that of the village.

In [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], the authenticity of the wine is guaranteed by a seal on the label or a band over the cork under the capsule.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; This is promulgated by the growers' association in each area.

[[German Wine Label|German wine labels]] are particularly noted for the detail that they can provide in determining quality and style of the wine. 

Almost every New World wine is labelled by grape variety and geographic origin. [[Semi-generic]] designations were once quite common in countries such as Australia and the USA, but the wine authorities in areas such as Champagne have not been afraid to bring lawsuits against the use of their names outside their region, and semi-generic names are falling out of use.

Wines whose label does not indicate the name of the winery or the winemaker are referred to as &quot;[[cleanskin (wine)|cleanskin]]&quot; wine, particularly in [[Australia]].

===Importance of labels in different types of wine===
The information contained in labels is important to determine the quality of the wine. For example, great importance needs to be attached to [[vintage]] dates when there are differences in climate.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; The taste and quality of the wine can change from year to year depending on the climate. Knowing the vintage is specially important when buying fine wines because the quality of the wine can vary from year to year due to climatic differences. The quickest way to determine the quality of the year is to use a [[wine chart]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt;

Vintage dates may not be important, for example, there are no vintage dates on bottles of [[sherry]].
On the other hand, wines may or may not have vintages. [[Champagne (wine)|Champagne]] is usually a blend from more than one year and only sometimes sold as a vintage wine. Also, [[Port wine|Port]] is only sold with a vintage in years of exceptional quality.

===Bottler and importer information===
A wine label may include the producer, the bottler and the merchant's names. The bottler's name must always be included in the label. The importer's name must be included in the label only for countries outside the [[Common Market]]. While it is not necessary for a wine to be bottled at its place of origin, it is obligatory for classed growth claret and vintage port to be bottled in [[Bordeaux]] and [[Oporto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; Also, bottling of [[Alsace]] must be done within the [[appellation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;&gt;George, Rosemary, '''The Simon &amp; Schuster Pocket Wine Label Decoder''', 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it is important to look for terms such as ''mis en bouteille au chÃ¢teau'' or ''mis au domaine'' because they tell you the wine is estate bottled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt;

===Misleading information===
Labels may include terms that may be perceived as misleading. The term ''[[Champagne (wine)#Blanc de blancs|Blanc de blancs]]'' may be included in a label. This term means &quot;white wine made from white grapes&quot;. The fact is that white wines are predominantly made from white grapes, with the exception of many [[sparkling wines]], the common use of the red [[Pinot noir]] in Champagne wines being a typical example. 

Although the word ''chÃ¢teau'' is most associated with [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]], it does not mean that the wine ''does'' come from Bordeaux, and there may not be any kind of building - let alone a chÃ¢teau - associated with the vineyard. The name chÃ¢teau can even be included in wines from Australia or California. Labels of [[Vin de pays]] never include the word chÃ¢teau.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt;

''[[Cru (wine)|Cru]]'', a word used to classify wines can mean different things. For example, in the [[MÃ©doc]] part of Bordeaux, this terms means the chÃ¢teau is one of the classified growths in the regions. In [[Saint-Ãmilion AOC|Saint-Ãmilion]], the term ''cru'' is of little importance because it bears little relation to quality. For [[Provence]] the term ''cru classÃ©'' is included only for historical reasons. On the other hand, the use of the term ''cru'' in [[Swiss wine|Switzerland]] has no foundation and it is included at the producer's discretion.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt;

===Accessibility===
[[File:Lazarus-wines.jpg|thumb|right|A wine label from Lazarus Wines printed in [[Braille]]. Wines from this vineyard are grown, cultivated, and produced by blind employees.]]
To better reach the market of [[blindness|blind]] or sight-impaired wine consumers, labels have appeared printed in [[Braille]]. Currently the only known winemaker who has taken the initiative to print all their labels in Braille is [[Chapoutier]] winery in France, who began the practice in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Karen Meyer |title=Braille wine labels | date=2008-05-01 |url=http://abclocal.go.com/wls/story?section=news/disability_issues&amp;id=6113514 |publisher=ABC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other wineries in a number of countries have followed Chapoutier's lead and have braille available on at least some of their bottles.&lt;ref name=WashingtonPost&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/07/31/AR2007073100387.html Washington Post - Vintners Who Share a Vision]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neck and back labels==
Neck and/or back labels may appear on a bottle. The neck label may include the vintage date and the back label usually gives extra (and usually optional) information about the wine. Government required warnings are usually found in the back label, as well as [[Universal Product Code|UPC]]s. For example, the [[United States]] requires alcoholic beverages to include a warning regarding the consumption of alcohol during pregnancy. The label also has to mention the possibility of a reduced ability to drive while intoxicated. Wine labels in the United States must also disclose that the wine contains [[sulfites]].

==Wine laws==
There are different reasons for wine laws. Labelling regulations can be intended to prevent wine from sounding better than it is.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; Also, it is illegal to say that a wine is made from one grape when it is actually from another.

The label must also include the name and address of the bottler of the wine. If the producer is not the bottler, the bottle will say that the wine was bottled by X bottled for Y producer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; Table wines may carry the name of the bottler and the postal code. The label must also include the country of origin.

The size of the font is also regulated for mandatory information. Alcohol content must be included in the label. In Australia and the United States a wine label must also mention that it has [[sulfites]] in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttb.gov/pdf/grape_wine_labels0706%20.pdf Wine Label Regulations] summary from the US Department of the Treasury, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (July 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Regulations may permit table wines to be labelled with only the colour and flavour, and no indication of quality.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; The use of words such as [[CuveÃ©]] and [[grand vin]] in labels is controlled.&lt;ref name=&quot;Wine Label decoder&quot;/&gt; As mentioned above, a [[vin de pays]] must never be from a chÃ¢teau, but from a [[domaine]].

=== Allergen warnings ===
[[New Zealand]] and [[Australian]] labeling regulations have required an [[allergen]] warning to appear on wine labels since 2002 due to the use of [[egg whites]], [[milk]], and [[isinglass]]&lt;ref&gt;Food Standards Australian and New Zealand (2004) [http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/newsroom/factsheets/industryfactsheetsfsc/wineandthelabellingo2558.cfm Wine and the labelling of certain substances that may cause adverse reactions]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[fining (wine)|fining]] and [[clarifying (wine)|clarifying]] of the wine. The United States is considering similar requirements. [[Winemakers]] in the U.S. have been resistant to this requirement because the decision to put a wine through a fining process normally occurs after the labels have been ordered, which could lead to allergen warnings on wines that have had no exposure to allergens.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sogg ''Wine Producers Struggle With Proposal to Require Allergen Warnings'' Wine Spectator pg 22 31 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Wine labels from the member states of the European Union must also disclose after 30 June 2012 that the wine was treated with casein and ovalbumin, derived from milk and egg respectively, used as fining agents in the winemaking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2010:347:0027:0028:EN:PDF COMMISSION REGULATION (EU) No 1266/2010] of 22 December 2010 amending Directive 2007/68/EC as regards labelling requirements for wines&lt;/ref&gt;

== Collecting ==
Wine labels have long been collected. This can turn into a full-fledged hobby, with collections organized by theme, country, or region. For others, saving labels may be part of maintaining a wine tasting-notes journal, or just simply to remember a particular wine.

While labels were once easily steamed off, recent automatic bottling and labeling processes at wineries have led to the use of stronger glues. Removing these labels is often difficult and may result in considerable damage to the label. A recent, though by no means universal, innovation to bypass this problem is the use of bottles that come with the ability to tear off a small part of the label in order to remind the drinker of the name and bearing of the wine. 

If full label removal is desired, a common approach involves putting hot water inside the bottle which makes the hold of the glue weaker. A knife can then be used to remove the label from one side by lifting it off with even pressure.

Commercial label removal kits apply a strong, transparent sticker over the label surface. The goal is to carefully pull off the sticker and literally tear the front design of the label away from the glued back. In practice, varying degrees of success are encountered and extensive damage to the label can occur.

==Personalisation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2010}}
{{Original research|section|date=April 2010}}
Creating custom wine labels has gained popularity over the years, with people needing labels for wedding favors, holiday gifts, and promotional campaigns. This is often carried out by specialist companies to avoid any breaches of wine law.

The increase in home wine making has contributed significantly, with hundreds of thousands of people around the world making their own wine instead of buying it. These people often make their own labels as well, or use online label companies. Homemade labels range from ink jet printing on copy paper and adhered with milk, to high quality designs printed on expensive label stock and printed with laser printers.
