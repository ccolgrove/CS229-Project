==DVD releases==
[[Image:Highlander series compleate series.jpg|thumb|180px|Complete DVD set]]

The television series '''''[[Highlander: The Series]]''''' has been released on home video in various collections. [[Starz Home Entertainment|Anchor Bay Entertainment]] released all six seasons of ''Highlander: The Series'' on DVD in [[DVD region code|Region 1]] between 2002-2005. The company also released a 15-episode [[greatest hits|best-of]] collection, as well as a collection containing all six seasons. In addition, Anchor Bay released several two-part episodes on single DVDs and edited them together to present them as feature-length films. For example, &quot;[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep21|Counterfeit]]&quot; and &quot;[[Highlander: The Series (season 2)#ep22|Counterfeit Part Two]]&quot; were released on a single DVD as ''Highlander: Counterfeit''.  These releases have all been discontinued and are now out of print.

Before the advent of [[DVD]], full seasons of ''Highlander'' were released on [[VHS]], one of few television series to do so. The season sets featured 11 VHS tapes, with two episodes on each tape. In addition, a feature-length release titled ''Highlander: The Gathering'' was released on VHS, which combined the episodes &quot;[[Highlander: The Series (season 1)#ep01|The Gathering]]&quot; and &quot;[[Highlander: The Series (season 1)#ep10|Revenge is Sweet]].&quot;
