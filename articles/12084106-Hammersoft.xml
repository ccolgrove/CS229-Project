'''''Young Frankenstein''''', officially known as '''''The New Mel Brooks Musical Young Frankenstein''''',  is a [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Mel Brooks]] and [[Thomas Meehan (writer)|Thomas Meehan]] and music and lyrics by Brooks. It is based on [[Young Frankenstein|the 1974 comedy film of the same name]] written by Brooks and [[Gene Wilder]] and directed by Brooks, who has described it as his best film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = New Zealand Herald | title = Mel Brooks Thinks It Time for Frankenstein to Dance | date = April 10, 2006 | url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/topic/story.cfm?c_id=265&amp;objectid=10376854 | accessdate = 2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is a [[parody]] of the [[horror film]] genre, especially the 1931 [[Universal Pictures]] adaptation of [[Mary Shelley]]'s ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'' and its 1939 sequel, ''[[Son of Frankenstein]]''. 

After tryouts in [[Seattle, Washington]] and four weeks of previews, the musical opened on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on November 8, 2007 to mixed reviews. The Broadway production closed on January 4, 2009 after 30 previews and 484 performances. A U.S. tour started on September 29, 2009 in [[Providence, Rhode Island]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/133293-Hensley_and_Bart_Put_on_the_Ritz_on_the_Road_in_Young_Frankenstein &quot;Hensley and Bart Put on the Ritz on the Road in Young Frankenstein&quot;], playbill.com, September 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

After the success of his 2001 musical, ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]'', based on Brooks' earlier film of the same name, it was not surprising that Brooks would musicalize another of his successful films.  Brooks and Meehan (the same team that crafted ''The Producers'') began work on the project in April 2006.  An October 2006 reading of the first draft of the script directed by [[Susan Stroman]] (who had directed the earlier musical)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Playbill News | title = Chenoweth, Hensley, Kudisch to Star in October Workshop of ''Young Frankenstein'' | date = September 6, 2006 | url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/101847.html  | accessdate = 2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; featured [[Brian d'Arcy James]] as Dr. Frankenstein, [[Kristin Chenoweth]] as Elizabeth, [[Sutton Foster]] as Inga, [[Roger Bart]] as Igor, [[Marc Kudisch]] as Inspector Kemp, and [[Shuler Hensley]] as the Monster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.playbill.com/news/article/102800.html &quot;It's FRAHN-ken-steen: Brian D'Arcy James Nabs Lead Role in Young Frankenstein Workshop&quot;, playbill.com, Oct. 18, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Cloris Leachman]], reprising her film role as Frau BlÃ¼cher, also attended the table read, and at the time it was widely reported she would be offered the role of BlÃ¼cher for the stage show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | work = Contact Music | title = Leachman to Return for Young Frankenstein Musical | date = August 11, 2006 | url=http://contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/leachman%20to%20return%20for%20young%20frankenstein%20musical_1013159 | accessdate = 2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, [[gossip]] [[maven]] [[Liz Smith (journalist)|Liz Smith]] reported in her January 12, 2007 ''[[New York Post]]'' column that Leachman was sent a letter informing her she would not be considered for the Broadway production because the producers wanted to keep the film and stage properties separate (and also because of Brooks's concerns over Leachman's ability to perform the character consistently at her age). However, due to Leachman's success on ''[[Dancing with the Stars (US TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'' Brooks reportedly asked her to reprise her role as Frau BlÃ¼cher after [[Beth Leavel]] left the production. However, the production closed before Leachman could take over the role.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realitytvworld.com/news/axed-dancing-star-cloris-leachman-may-reprise-frankenstein-role-1015512.php Axed 'Dancing' star Cloris Leachman may reprise 'Frankenstein' role]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwayworld.com/article/Leachman_to_Go_Dancing_with_YOUNG_FRANKENSTEIN_20010101 Leachman to Go 'Dancing' with YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
The plot is largely carried over from the movie, but some scenes are expanded to musical numbers, and many gags have been added or updated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Asian Week|title=I Enjoy Being a Frankenstein Girl|date=September 8, 2007|url=http://www.asianweek.com/2007/09/08/i-enjoy-being-a-frankenstein-girl/#more-261|accessdate=2007-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act I===
In the town of [[Transylvania]] Heights, the year 1934, the villagers celebrate the funeral procession of the [[mad scientist]], Dr. [[Victor Frankenstein|Victor von Frankenstein]]. However, Inspector Kemp, who has a wooden right arm and wooden left leg, ruins the happiness with news about the existence of Victor's grandson: Frederick, the Dean of Anatomy at [[New York]]'s best university, known as the &quot;Johns, Miriam and [[Anthony Hopkins]] School of Medicine.&quot; The village idiot Ziggy convinces the other villagers that there is no way a New York doctor would come to Transylvania, thus continuing the celebration (&quot;The Happiest Town&quot;).

In New York, [[Frederick Frankenstein]] is ashamed to be a Frankenstein, insisting his name be pronounced &quot;Fronkensteen&quot; and that he is not a madman but a scientist. He then lectures his students about the greatest mind of science (&quot;The Brain&quot;). After learning that he has inherited his grandfather's castle in Transylvania, he is forced to resolve the issue of the property. As Elizabeth Benning, Frederick's [[Engagement|fiancÃ©e]], sees him off, it is clear that their relationship is far from physical as Elizabeth enumerates all the lustful situations that she is abstaining from (&quot;Please Don't Touch Me&quot;). This number includes the show's famous much lauded attention to her breasts. 

Arriving at Transylvania Heights, Frederick meets the hunchback [[Igor (Young Frankenstein)|Igor]] (pronounced &quot;Eye-gore&quot;), the grandson of Victor's henchman, who is extremely excited to meet him. Igor tries to convince him to continue in his grandfather's footsteps (&quot;Together Again&quot;); he has already hired the services of [[Inga (Young Frankenstein)|Inga]], a yodeling lab assistant with a degree in Laboratory Science from the local community college. During a wagon ride to Castle Frankenstein, a yodeling Inga and the doctor indulge in a &quot;Roll in the Hay&quot; (Roll in the Hay). When they reach the castle, they meet the mysterious Frau Blucher, whose spoken name frightens the horses.

Once inside the castle's main living room, Frederick falls asleep reading ''[[Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm]]'' and dreams that his grandfather and ancestors encourage him to build a monster complete with line dancing and stage-height monster puppet (&quot;Join the Family Business&quot;). He is awakened by Inga, and, after performing the film's iconic candle/bookcase sequence, they find the secret entrance to his grandfather's laboratory by following eerie violin music. They discover the mysterious violin player to be Frau BlÃ¼cher, who tells of her past of festival games with the late Victor for whom she was more than just a housekeeper (&quot;He Vas My Boyfriend&quot;). After reviewing his grandfather's notes, Frederick decides to carry on the experiments in the reanimation of the dead. They dig up a huge corpse with &quot;an enormous ''schwanstuker''.&quot; The villagers gather at the local town hall for a meeting and are instructed to be on the lookout for grave robbers (&quot;The Law&quot;).

Frederick sends Igor to find a brain and entrusts him with the vital organ, but the henchman drops it, surreptitiously replacing the brain with another. Frederick creates the creature (&quot;Life, Life&quot;), who goes on a rampage shortly after waking. The doctor is distressed to find that Igor had provided a different brain whose name he recalls as &quot;Abby Normal&quot;.

Inspector Kemp and the townspeople come to investigate, pretending to welcome Frederick (&quot;Welcome to Transylvania&quot;). Frederick and his employees try to stall the villagers (&quot;Transylvania Mania&quot;) while Frau BlÃ¼cher frees the Monster without letting Frederick know. Panic ensues as the monster breaks free from the stage and tramples through the house just as the Act I curtain falls.

===Act II===
Everyone goes out to search for the Monster. Even Frau BlÃ¼cher tries bringing back the Monster with the music from the violin, but to no avail (&quot;He's Loose&quot;). Inga talks to the frustrated doctor (&quot;Listen to Your Heart&quot;). Frau BlÃ¼cher and Igor find the two suspended on the platform, completing what Igor believes to be &quot;an experiment on the female anatomy, and Inga is assisting his brains out.&quot;

Elizabeth arrives unexpectedly in Transylvania with a large entourage (&quot;Surprise&quot;) and finds Frederick and a naked Inga, who tell her that no funny business was taking place. Meanwhile, the Monster finds a blind hermit named Harold after breaking through his house wall (&quot;Please Send Me Someone&quot;). Eventually, after Harold accidentally pours hot soup into the Monster's lap and lights his thumb (mistaking it as a cigar), the Monster is startled into another yelling rampage and leaves. Frederick locks himself into a room with the Monster, and after overcoming his fears he tells the Monster that he is a good looking fellow who is loved and will be hailed by all (&quot;Man About Town&quot;).

The Monster is presented at the [[Loews Hotels|Loews Transylvania Theatre]], now dressed as a gentleman, first walking on command, and then dancing to [[Irving Berlin]]'s &quot;[[Puttin' on the Ritz]]&quot;, complete with backup dancers and strobe lights. While taking his bow, the Monster becomes terrified when some stage lights explode. Elizabeth is kidnapped by the creature and is taken to a cave and raped. However, as her &quot;Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life&quot; demonstrates, she's now seeing a different side of the Monster and discovers what she's been yearning for in her life (&quot;Deep Love&quot;). Luring the Monster back to the castle by the music of a French horn, Frederick attempts an intelligence transfer, but the Monster does not wake, and to make things worse Inspector Kemp and the angry villagers (believing that Elizabeth has been killed by the Monster) break into the castle and bring Frederick to the gallows. The doctor is hanged after finally accepting his family name (&quot;Frederick's Soliloquy&quot;).

The Monster returns, not only able to speak articulately but also using his newly transferred medical skills to discover that Frederick is not dead, but merely unconscious and is able to bring him back to life. Just as the crowd is about to re-hang Frederick and the Monster, Elizabeth arrives. After a hopeful plot twist, the Monster proposes to Elizabeth (&quot;Deep Love&quot; (Reprise)). Then the blind Hermit's voice is heard singing. Frau Blucher announces she has a &quot;blind date&quot; with him. Igor proclaims a miracle, saying that his hump is gone, but quickly realizes that it is in the middle. Inspector Kemp and the villagers all elect the Monster as the Mayor of Transylvania which the Monster happily accepts. Suddenly, [[Count Dracula]] appears, wishing to purchase the castle on the hill, but Frederick tells him the castle is not for sale and he will be living in it and continuing the family business from now on. He then proposes marriage to Inga which she accepts. More comic surprises follow, and all lead to a happy ending that is sure to prove a life of laughter and love for all (&quot;Finale Ultimo&quot;). Just then, Inga realizes when her new husband gave the Monster his brilliant mind, the Monster gave him his  &quot;enormous ''schwanstuker''&quot; in return. &quot;Woof!&quot;

=== Differences from the original film ===
Although the plot remains mostly the same, there are several changes from the original film. &quot;The Happiest Town in Town&quot; is not based on any scene from the film. Elizabeth arrives in Transylvania earlier than in the film, where she arrives after &quot;Puttin' on The Ritz,&quot; a song performed in the film by only Frederick and the Monster; in the musical, it is sung by all the characters, except Elizabeth and the villagers. The scene from the film with the little girl is not in the musical. In the film, the Monster is lured not by a French horn but a violin, and awakens in the laboratory directly after the brain transfer; in the musical, the Villagers hang Frederick before the Monster wakes and saves him, with the ensuing finale much expanded.&lt;ref&gt;Synopsis sources:[http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20070825/ENT/108250011 Herald.net, 8/25/07] and [http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117934491.html?categoryid=33&amp;cs=1 Variety, 8/26/07]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Young Frankenstein'' generally received mixed critical reviews, and was often compared to ''[[The Producers (musical)|The Producers]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,1682320,00.html ''Time'' November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/culture/2007/11/09/2007-1-09_young_frankenstein_doesnt_measure_up_to_-2.html ''Daily News'', November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it &quot;an overblown burlesque revue, right down to its giggly smuttiness ... Mr. Brooksâs songs have a throwaway quality, as if they were dashed off on the day of the performance.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://theater2.nytimes.com/2007/11/09/theater/reviews/09fran.html ''New York Times'', November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;  

''[[The New York Post]]'' gave a more positive review, saying that the show &quot;is nearly very good indeed&quot; and that &quot;Brooks and Stroman pull out every stop. Despite music that's more ho-hum than hummable, Brooks's lyrics are bright and witty. Better yet, the book ... does a great job, with the assistance of co-writer Thomas Meehan, in transferring the original script to the stage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypost.com/seven/11092007/entertainment/theater/not_quite_a_monster_725476.htm ''New York Post'', November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' said that &quot;Susan Stroman directs and choreographs with her usual wit and invention,&quot; but also mentioned that &quot;you cannot escape the impression that everyone is working desperately hard to animate essentially weak material, and the show fatally lacks that touch of the sublime that made ''The Producers'' so special.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/11/09/btfrank109.xml ''The Daily Telegraph'', November 9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite mixed reviews from [[New York]] critics, ''Young Frankenstein'' was generally popular with audiences, with one attendee saying that although it didn't outdo the film, it's a &quot;fantastic [show] for those new to Broadway&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadwaybox.com/reviews/theater/young_frankenstein_the_musical_reviews.aspx Audience Reviews]. BroadwayBox.&lt;/ref&gt; The production won a Broadway.com Audience Award for Favorite New Broadway Musical.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadway.com/buzz/97390/2008-audience-award-winners-announced-young-frankenstein-tops-list-of-fan-faves/ 2008 Broadway.com Audience Award Winners; &quot;Young Franenstein&quot; Tops List]&lt;/ref&gt; 

When describing the audience's reaction, Brooks said, &quot;I love what they do. The audience knows 'Young Frankenstein' the movie; they didn't know 'The Producers.' They all neigh when anyone on stage says 'Frau Blucher.' And they can't wait for the Blind Hermit to spill the hot soup on the monster's lap. It's great to see the audience play ping-pong with the actors.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/entertainment/106254363.html 'Young Frankenstein' comes alive with music | Mel Brooks musical coming to Milwaukee]&lt;/ref&gt;
