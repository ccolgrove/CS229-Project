== History of Mexican Americans ==
{{Main|History of Mexican Americans}}
Mexican American history is wide-ranging, spanning more than four hundred years and varying from region to region within the United States. In 1900, there were slightly more than 500,000 [[Hispanics]] living in [[New Mexico]], California and Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prb.org/Articles/2004/LatinosandtheChangingFaceofAmerica.aspx Latinos and the Changing Face of America â Population Reference Bureau]&lt;/ref&gt; Most were Mexican Americans of indigenous Mexican, Spanish, and other hispanicized European settlers who arrived in the Southwest during Spanish colonial times. Approximately ten percent of the current Mexican American population can trace their lineage back to these early colonial settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Mexican Americans â MSN Encarta|url=http://encarta.msn.com/encyclopedia_761587500_1/Mexican_Americans.html|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5kx7M1c1J|archivedate=November 1, 2009|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1813 some of the [[Tejanos]] who colonized Texas in the Spanish Colonial Period established a government in Texas that looked forward to independence from Mexico. In those days, there was no concept of what a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] was. Many Mexicans were more loyal to their states/provinces than to their country as a whole. This was particularly true in frontier regions such as [[Zacatecas]], [[Coahuila y Tejas|Texas]], [[Yucatan peninsula|Yucatan]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Santa Fe de Nuevo Mexico|New Mexico]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/kera/usmexicanwar/war/borderlands_on_the_eve.html]&lt;/ref&gt; As revealed by the writings of colonial Tejano Texians such as Antonio Menchaca, the [[Texas Revolution]] was initially a colonial Tejano cause. By 1831, [[Anglo]] settlers outnumbered Tejanos ten to one in Texas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/alamo/timeline/timeline2.html American Experience | Remember the Alamo | Timeline | PBS]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mexican government became concerned by their increasing numbers and restricted the number of new Anglo-American settlers allowed to enter Texas. The Mexican government also banned slavery within the state, which angered slave owners.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissidentvoice.org/April2004/Felux0408.htm (DV) Felux: Remember the Alamo?]&lt;/ref&gt; The American settlers along with many of the Tejanos rebelled against the centralized authority of [[Mexico City]] and the [[General Santa Anna|Santa Anna]] regime, while others remained loyal to Mexico, and still others were neutral.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=ENPUSvf4Z3EC&amp;pg=PA41&amp;dq=%22tejano+community%27s%22+%22texas+independence%22&amp;sig=sgeYJ9hGcg2Fg2WPZc4AoeTREZE#PPA21,M1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bexargenealogy.com/Tejanos.html {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author John P. Schmal wrote of the effect Texas independence had on the Tejano community:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.houstonculture.org/hispanic/alamo.html The Hispanic Experience â Tejanos in the Texas Revolution]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;A native of San Antonio, [[Juan SeguÃ­n]] is probably the most famous Tejano to be involved in the War of Texas Independence. His story is complex because he joined the Anglo rebels and helped defeat the Mexican forces of Santa Anna. But later on, as Mayor of San Antonio, he and other Tejanos felt the hostile encroachments of the growing Anglo power against them. After receiving a series of death threats, SeguÃ­n relocated his family in Mexico, where he was coerced into military service and fought against the US in 1846â1848 Mexican-American War.

Although the events of 1836 led to independence for the people of Texas, the Hispanic population of the state was very quickly disenfranchised to the extent that their political representation in the Texas State Legislature disappeared entirely for several decades.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Californios]] were Spanish speaking residents of modern day California who were the original Hispanics (Mexicans (regardless of race) and local Hispanicized Indians) in the region ([[Alta California]]) before the United States took it over. Relations between Californios and Anglo settlers were relatively good until military officer [[John C. Fremont]] arrived in Alta California with a force of 60 men on an exploratory expedition in 1846. Fremont made an agreement with Comandante Castro that he would only stay in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] for the winter, then move north to [[Oregon]]. However, Fremont remained in the [[Santa Clara Valley]] then headed towards [[Monterey]]. When Castro demanded that Fremont leave Alta California, Fremont rode to [[Gavilan Peak]], raised a US flag and vowed to fight to the last man to defend it. After three days of tension, Fremont retreated to Oregon without a shot being fired. With relations between Californios and Anglos quickly souring, Fremont rode back into Alta California and encouraged a group of American settlers to seize a group of Castro's soldiers and their horses. Another group, seized the [[Presidio of Sonoma]] and captured Mariano Vallejo. [[William B. Ide]] was chosen Commander in Chief and on July 5, he proclaimed the creation of the [[Bear Flag Republic]]. On July 9, US forces reached Sonoma and lowered the Bear Flag Republic's flag then replaced it with a US flag. Californios organized an army to defend themselves from invading American forces after the Mexican army retreated from Alta California to defend other parts of the country. The Californios defeated an American force in Los Angeles on September 30, 1846, but were defeated after the Americans reinforced their forces in what is now southern California. The arrival of tens of thousands of people during the [[California Gold Rush]] meant the end of the Californio's ranching lifestyle. Many Anglo 49ers turned to farming and moved, often illegally, onto the land granted to Californios by the old Mexican government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/goldrush/peopleevents/p_coronel.html American Experience | The Gold Rush | People &amp; Events | PBS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States first came into conflict with Mexico in the 1830s, as the westward spread of Anglo settlements and of slavery brought significant numbers of new settlers into the region known as Tejas (modern-day Texas), then part of Mexico. The [[Mexican-American War]], followed by the [[Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo]] in 1848 and the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853, extended U.S. control over a wide range of territory once held by Mexico, including the present day borders of Texas and the states of New Mexico, Colorado, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, and California.

Although the treaty promised that the landowners in this newly acquired territory would enjoy full enjoyment and protection of their property as if they were citizens of the United States, many former citizens of Mexico lost their land in lawsuits before state and federal courts or as a result of legislation passed after the treaty.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated8&quot;&gt;[http://www.worldbook.com/wb/Students?content_spotlight/cinco/hispanic World Book Encyclopedia | Atlas | Homework Help]&lt;/ref&gt; Even those statutes intended to protect the owners of property at the time of the extension of the United States' borders, such as the 1851 California Land Act, had the effect of dispossessing [[Californio]] owners ruined by the cost of maintaining litigation over land titles for years.

While Mexican Americans were once concentrated in the [[Southwestern United States|Southwest]] â California, [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], [[Colorado]] and Texas â they began creating communities in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], Chicago, Detroit, [[Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh]], and other steel producing regions when they obtained employment during World War I. More recently, Mexican illegal immigrants have increasingly become a large part of the workforce in industries such as meat packing throughout the [[Midwest]], in agriculture in the southeastern United States, and in the construction, landscaping, restaurant, hotel and other service industries throughout the country.

Mexican-American workers formed unions of their own and joined integrated unions. The most significant union struggle involving Mexican-Americans was the [[United Farm Workers]]' long strike and boycott aimed at grape growers in the San Joaquin and Coachella Valleys in the late 1960s. Its struggle propelled [[CÃ©sar ChÃ¡vez]] and [[Dolores Huerta]] into national prominence
changing from a workers' rights organization that helped workers get unemployment insurance to that of a union of farmworkers almost overnight.

Mexican American identity has also changed markedly throughout these years. Over the past hundred years Mexican Americans have campaigned for voting rights, stood against educational and employment discrimination and stood for economic and social advancement. At the same time many Mexican Americans have struggled with defining and maintaining their community's identity. In the 1960s and 1970s, some Latino/Hispanic student groups flirted with nationalism and differences over the proper name for members of the communityâ[[Chicano|Chicano/Chicana]], [[Latino|Latino/Latina]], Mexican Americans, or [[Hispanics]] became tied up with deeper disagreements over whether to integrate into or remain separate from mainstream American society, as well as divisions between those Mexican Americans whose families had lived in the United States for two or more generations and more recent immigrants. During this time rights groups such as the [[National Mexican-American Anti-Defamation Committee]] were founded. The states with the largest percentages and populations of Mexican-Americans are California, [[Arizona]], [[New Mexico]], Texas, [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], and [[Utah]]. There has also been very high increasing populations in [[Oklahoma]]. [[Pennsylvania]] and [[Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.census.gov/ Census Bureau Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Admixturehispanicswest.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Admixture graphic of the Hispanic population.]]
Per the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 U.S. Census]], a plurality of 47.3% of Mexican Americans self identify as being of [[White people|White race]], closely followed by Mexican Americans who self identify as [[Race and ethnicity in the United States Census|&quot;Some other race&quot;]], usually [[Mestizo]] (Native American/European) with 45.5%.&lt;.&lt;ref name=Tafoya&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pewhispanic.org/files/reports/35.pdf |title=Shades of Belonging |last=Tafoya |first=Sonya |accessdate=June 3, 2008 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center|Pew Hispanic Center]] |date=December 6, 2004 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respondents who claim two or more races accounted for 5.1%, [[African American|Blacks]] for 0.7%, and all other races for 1.4%. Mexican Americans are predominantly of [[mestizo|Native American and European]] descent.  A study presented by the [[American Society of Human Genetics]] found that on average, Mexicans (from Mexico) are 58.99% [[white Hispanic and Latino Americans|Caucasian]], 39.01% &quot;Asian&quot; (Native American), and 80% of Mexicans were classes as mestizos (racially mixed in any degree).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashg.org/cgi-bin/ashg06s/ashg06?abst=mexican%20mestizo&amp;sort=ptimes&amp;sbutton=Detail&amp;absno=10071&amp;sid=460830&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found the Mexican mestizo population has a higher heterogeneity compared to other populations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ashg.org/cgi-bin/ashg06s/ashg06?abst=2006&amp;sort=ptimes&amp;sbutton=Detail&amp;absno=20080&amp;sid=77226&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to the admixture of Mexican Americans (in general). According to the last Mexican census to record race (which was in 1921), 10 percent of the Mexican populace identified itself as [[white Hispanic and Latino Americans|white]], 59 percent as Mestizo (Native American-European mixture), 29 percent as Native American, and 2 percent as &quot;other&quot;, foreigner (regardless of race), or did not specify a race.&lt;ref&gt;Bertoni et al., Admixture in Hispanics: Distribution of Ancestral Population Contributions in the United States, Human Biology â Volume 75, Number 1, February 2003, pp. 1â11&lt;/ref&gt;
Before the United States' borders expanded westward in the 19th century, [[New World]] regions colonized by the [[Spanish Empire]] since the 16th century held to a complex caste system (''casta'') that [[Race (classification of human beings)|classified persons]] by their fractional racial makeup and geographic origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zonalatina.com/Zldata55.htm | title = Racial Classifications in Latin America | accessdate=December 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/5views/5views5.htm | title = A History of Mexican Americans in California: Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the United States' borders expanded, the [[United States Census Bureau]] changed its racial classification methods for Mexican Americans under United States jurisdiction. The Bureau's classification system has evolved significantly from its inception:

* From 1790 to 1850, there was no distinct racial classification of Mexican Americans in the  U.S. census. The only racial categories recognized by the [[Census Bureau]] were ''White'' and ''Black''. The Census Bureau estimates that during this period the number of persons that could not be categorized as white or black did not exceed 0.25% of the total population based on 1860 census data.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical census&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* From 1850 through 1920 the Census Bureau expanded its racial categories to include all different races including  ''[[Mestizos]]'',  ''[[Mulattos]]'', ''[[Amerindians]]'' and ''[[Asians]]'', and classified Mexicans and Mexican Americans as &quot;White&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;historical census&quot;/&gt; All Mexicans were legally (though not always socially) considered &quot;White&quot; either because they were considered to be of full Spanish heritage, or because of treaty obligations to Spaniards and Mexicans that conferred citizenship status at a time when whiteness was a prerequisite for U.S. citizenship.

* The 1930 U.S. census revoked generic &quot;white&quot; status for Mexican Americans due to protests from Anglo Americans nativists.  The new form asked for &quot;color or race&quot; and census workers were instructed to &quot;write âWâ for White; âMexâ for Mexican.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;1930 census&quot;&gt;

|year= 2002
| accessdate =December 7, 2006
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* In the 1940 census, Mexican Americans were re-classified as ''White'', due to widespread protests by the Mexican American community and the World War II-era [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] administration's policies of promoting national, &quot;patriotic&quot; unity by reorganizing racial categories to make all [[ethnic group]]s &quot;white&quot; and or &quot;Americans&quot; if not white. Instructions for enumerators were &quot;Mexicans â Report 'White' (W) for Mexicans unless they are definitely of indigenous or other non-white race.&quot; During the same census, however, the bureau began to track the ''White population of Spanish mother tongue''. This practice continued through the 1960 census.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical census&quot;/&gt; The 1960 census also used the title &quot;Spanish-surnamed American&quot; in their reporting data of Mexican Americans, which included Cuban Americans, Puerto Ricans and others under the same category.

* From 1970 to 1980, there was a dramatic population increase of Other Race in the census, reflecting the addition of a question on Hispanic origin to the 100-percent questionnaire, an increased propensity for Hispanics to NOT identify themselves as White, and a change in editing procedures to accept reports of &quot;Other race&quot; for respondents who wrote in Hispanic entries such as Mexican, Cuban, or Puerto Rican. In 1970, such responses in the Other race category were reclassified and tabulated as White. During this census, the bureau attempted to identify all ''Hispanics'' by use of the following criteria in sampled sets:&lt;ref name=&quot;historical census&quot;/&gt;
:* Spanish speakers and persons belonging to a household where the head of household was a Spanish speaker
:* Persons with Spanish heritage by birth location or surname
:* Persons who self-identified Spanish origin or descent

* From 1980 on, the Census Bureau has collected data on Hispanic origin on a 100-percent basis. The bureau has noted an increasing number of respondents who mark themselves as Hispanic origin but not of the ''White'' race.&lt;ref name=&quot;historical census&quot;/&gt;
For certain purposes, respondents who wrote in &quot;Chicano&quot; or &quot;Mexican&quot; (or indeed, almost all Hispanic origin groups) in the &quot;''Some other race''&quot; category were automatically re-classified into the &quot;White race&quot; group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seer.cancer.gov/manuals/2007/SPCSM_2007_AppendixD.pdf Surveillance Epidemology and End Results.

=== Politics and debate of racial classification ===
{{Chicano and Mexican-American series|right}}

Since the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo, which granted citizenship rights to Mexican people in the newly conquered US territory of the South West, Mexican Americans have been legally considered &quot;White.&quot;  Since legal [[citizenship in the United States]] required &quot;white&quot; racial status, new Mexican &quot;Americans&quot; had to be classified as White, whether or not they were considered white in &quot;reality&quot;. Thus Mexican Americans were white by law, but not usually classified as such socially (depending on class and whether an individual had any degree of perceived indigenous ancestry). According to legal scholars, &quot;Anglos rarely distinguished between Mexicans and Mexican Americans and painted a picture of 'Mexicans' as an economic and cultural threat to America. In [the early 1900s], Mexican Americans increasingly were denied many of the rights of citizens. Like the African American population, many were placed in segregated schools with inferior educational resources, barred from restaurants, movie theaters, bathrooms, and public swimming pools, and denied the possibility of living in white neighborhoods,&quot; in addition to being barred from serving on juries in most of the Southwest; yet none of this segregation was formally encoded in law. Thus while for legal purposes, Mexican Americans were counted as White, in everyday reality most Mexican Americans were not considered &quot;white,&quot; did not enjoy &quot;white&quot; status or privileges, and were in fact typically subjected to systematic discrimination and &quot;Jim Crow&quot; style racial segregation.  The legal designation of white racial status actually worked against Mexican American civil rights in law suits claiming racial discrimination. Such suits were typically denied on the basis that Mexican Americans were not subject to racial discrimination, despite all evidence to the contrary, because they were legally white.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clare Sheridan&quot;&gt;

In times and places where Mexicans were allotted white status, they were permitted to intermarry with what today are termed &quot;non-Hispanic whites&quot;, though social customs typically only approved of such marriages if the Mexican partner was not of any discernable indigenous heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=De Genova|first=Nicholas|title=Racial Transformations: Latinos And Asians|page=96|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2006|isbn=978-0-8223-3716-4|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=EypC4KRNR9oC&amp;pg=PA95&amp;lpg=PA95&amp;dq=anti+miscegenation+mexican&amp;source=web&amp;ots=WSGVELWSM0&amp;sig=JrAVv7bWJotQboswzLKUAgWp-JA#PPP1,M1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Legally, Mexican Americans could vote and hold elected office, though they were also constrained from voting in most places by literacy tests and poll taxes. While Mexicans of Spanish descent ran the state politics and constituted most of the elite of [[New Mexico]] since colonial times, property requirements and English literacy requirements were imposed in Arizona, California, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas in order to prevent Mexican Americans from voting. Some eligible voters were intimidated with the threat of violence if they attempted to exercise their right to vote.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iwantmyvote.com/recount/history/ History of Voting Rights in America Â» Cobb-LaMarche 2004 â Ballot Recount]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexicans were also allowed to serve in all-white units during World War II. However, many Mexican American war veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] when they arrived home.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.neta.com/~1stbooks/press3b.htm press3b]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past, Mexicans were legally considered &quot;White&quot; because either they were considered to be of full Spanish heritage, or because of early treaty obligations to Spaniards and Mexicans that conferred citizenship status to Mexican peoples at a time when whiteness was a prerequisite for U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref name = &quot;Haney-Lopez0&quot;&gt;

Mexican Americans classified as &quot;White&quot;, following anti-[[miscegenation]] laws in most western states until the 1960s, could not legally marry African or Asian Americans (See [[Perez v. Sharp]]). However, there's a documented trend of intermarriage rates in the Mexican American community with [[Indian Americans]] from India or Pakistan (see [[Punjabi Mexican American]] for information about the subject). 

Cohabitation with [[Filipino Americans]] in California whom shared some cultural traits like the Spanish language and mostly the Roman Catholic faith are well-known. But because Mexican Americans were classified as &quot;White&quot; they couldn't legally marry Asian Americans until the state repealed its' anti-miscegenation laws in the 1960's. {{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

Many employers, however, have developed a &quot;don't ask, don't tell&quot; attitude toward hiring undocumented Mexican nationals. In May 2006, hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants, Mexicans and other nationalities, walked out of their jobs across the country in [[2006 United States immigration reform protests|protest]] to support immigration reform (many in hopes of a path to citizenship similar to the [[Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986]], which granted citizenship to Mexican nationals living and working without documentation in the US).

In the United States, in states where Mexican Americans make up a large percentage of the population, such as California and Texas, undocumented as well as legal immigrants from Mexico and Central America in addition to Mexican Americans combined often make up a large majority of workers in many [[blue-collar]] occupations: the majority of the employed men are restaurant workers, janitors, truck drivers, gardeners, construction laborers, material moving workers, or perform other types of manual or other blue collar labor (Source, U.S. Census Bureau, American community survey data.). Many women also work in low wage service and retail occupations. In many of these places with large Latino populations, many types of blue-collar workers are often assumed to be Mexican American or Mexican or other Latino immigrants (Although a large minority are actually not. -Source, U.S. Census Bureau, American community survey data.) because of their frequent dominance in those occupations and stereotyping. Occasionally, tensions have risen between Mexican immigrants and other ethnic groups because of increasing concerns over the availability of working-class jobs to Americans and immigrants from other ethnic groups. However, tensions have also risen among Hispanic American laborers who have been displaced because of both cheap Mexican labor and ethnic profiling. African American workers in lower-wage jobs have been displaced by undocumented Mexican laborers and their neighborhoods have been transformed from majority black to majority Latino, which has caused some racial tensions between African Americans and Mexicans in the Southwest US. Even legal immigrants to the United States, both from Mexico and elsewhere, have spoken out against illegal immigration. However, according to a survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]] in June 2007, 63% of Americans would support an immigration policy that would put illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship if they &quot;pass background checks, pay fines and have jobs, learn English&quot;, while 30% would oppose such a plan. The survey also found that if this program was instead labeled &quot;amnesty&quot;, 54% would support it, while 39% would oppose.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people-press.org/reports/display.php3?ReportID=335 Summary of Findings: Mixed Views on Immigration Bill]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alan Greenspan]], former [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]], has said that the growth of the working-age population is a large factor in keeping the economy growing and that immigration can be used to grow that population. According to Greenspan, by 2030, the growth of the US workforce will slow from 1 percent to 1/2 percent, while the percentage of the population over 65 years will rise from 13 percent to perhaps 20 percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.federalreserve.gov/boarddocs/testimony/2003/20030227/ FRB: Testimony, Greenspan-Aging population-February 27, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Greenspan has also stated that the current immigration problem could be solved with a &quot;stroke of the pen&quot;, referring to the 2007 immigration reform bill which would have strengthened border security, created a guest worker program, and put illegal immigrants currently residing in the US on a path to citizenship if they met certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2007-05-17-greenspan-immigration_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Immigration curbs hurting U.S., Greenspan says | date=May 17, 2007 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Discrimination and stereotypes ==
{{Main|Anti-Mexican sentiment|Hispanophobia}}
Throughout U.S. history, Mexican Americans have and continue to endure various types of negative stereotypes which have long circulated in media and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Flores Niemann Yolanda, ''et al.'' ââBlack-Brown Relations and Stereotypesââ (2003); Charles RamÃ­rez Berg, ââLatino Images in Film: Stereotypes, Subversion, &amp; Resistanceââ (2002); Chad Richardson, ââBatos, Bolillos, Pochos, and Pelados: Class &amp; Culture on the South Texas Borderââ (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p111385_index.html Life on the Texas-Mexico Border: Myth and reality as represented in Mainstream and Independent Western Cinema]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican Americans have also faced discrimination based on ethnicity, race, culture, poverty, and use of the Spanish language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/lhr/21.1/forum_wilson.html Steven H.

Since the majority of illegal immigrants in the U.S. have traditionally been from Latin America, the Mexican American community has been the subject of widespread immigration raids. During [[The Great Depression]], the United States government sponsored a [[Mexican Repatriation]] program which was intended to encourage people to voluntarily move to Mexico, but thousands were deported against their will. More than 500,000 individuals were deported, approximately 60 percent of which were actually United States citizens.&lt;ref&gt;[http://campusapps.fullerton.edu/news/2005/valenciana.html 1930s Mexican Deportation: Educator brings attention to historic period and its affect on her family]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot;&gt;[http://www.counselingkevin.com/the_economy/index.html Counseling Kevin: The Economy] {{dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the post-war [[McCarthy era]], the Justice Department launched [[Operation Wetback]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated3&quot; /&gt;

During World War II, more than 300,000 Mexican Americans served in the US armed forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated8&quot; /&gt; Mexican Americans were generally integrated into regular military units, however, many Mexican American war veterans were discriminated against and even denied medical services by the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] when they arrived home.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; In 1948, war veteran Dr [[Hector P. Garcia]] founded the [[American GI Forum]] to address the concerns of Mexican American veterans who were being discriminated against. The AGIF's first campaign was on the behalf of [[Felix Longoria]], a Mexican American private who was killed in the [[Philippines]] while in the line of duty. Upon the return of his body to his hometown of [[Three Rivers, Texas]], he was denied funeral services because of his race.

In the 1948 case of [[Perez v. Sharp]], Andrea Perezâa Mexican-American woman listed as Whiteâand Sylvester Davisâan African American manâthe Supreme Court of California recognized that interracial bans on marriage violated the Fourteenth Amendment of the Federal Constitution.

In 2006, ''Time'' magazine reported that the number of hate groups in the United States increased by 33% since 2000, primarily due to anti-illegal immigrant and anti-Mexican sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1198895,00.html | work=Time | title=How Immigration is Rousing the Zealots | date=May 29, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010 | first=Jeffrey | last=Ressner}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the annual Federal Bureau of Investigation ([[FBI]]) Hate Crimes Statistics Report,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2007/index.html Hate Crime Statistics, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; in 2007, Hispanics comprised 61.7 percent of victims of crimes motivated by a bias toward the victimsâ ethnicity or national origin. Since 2003 the number of both victims of anti-Hispanic crimes and incidents increased by nearly 40 percent. In 2004, the comparable figure was 51.5 percent. In California, the state with the largest Mexican American population, the number of hate crimes committed against Latinos has almost doubled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.democracynow.org/2007/12/5/fbi_statistics_show_anti_latino_hate Democracy Now! | FBI Statistics Show Anti-Latino Hate Crimes on the Rise]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ccsre.stanford.edu/reports/exec_summary5.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social status and assimilation ==

Barrow (2005) finds increases in average personal and household incomes for Mexican Americans in the 21st century. U.S. born Mexican Americans earn more and are represented more in the middle and upper-class segments more than most recently arriving Mexican immigrants.

Most immigrants from Mexico, as elsewhere, come from the lower classes and from families generationally employed in lower skilled jobs. They also are most likely from rural areas. Thus, many new Mexican immigrants are not skilled in white collar professions. Recently, some professionals from Mexico have been migrating, but to make the transition from one country to another involves re-training and re-adjusting to conform to US laws âi.e. professional licensing is required.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}

According to James P. Smith of the [[RAND|Research and Development Corporation]], the children and grandchildren of Latino immigrants tend to lessen educational and income gaps with native [[White American|whites]]. Immigrant Latino men make about half of what native whites do, while second generation US-born Latinos make about 78 percent of the salaries of their native white counterparts and by the third generation US-born Latinos make on average identical wages to their US-born white counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4188/is_20060618/ai_n16490113 | work=Deseret News (Salt Lake City) | title=Assimilation of immigrants is not a problem in the U.S | first=Tyler | last=Cowen | date=June 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington (2005) argues that the sheer number, concentration, linguistic homogeneity, and other characteristics of Latin American immigrants will erode the dominance of English as a nationally unifying language, weaken the country's dominant cultural values, and promote ethnic allegiances over a primary identification as an American. Testing these hypotheses with data from the U.S. Census and national and Los Angeles opinion surveys, Citrin et al. (2007) show that Hispanics generally acquire English and lose Spanish rapidly beginning with the second generation, and appear to be no more or less religious or committed to the work ethic than native-born non-Mexican American whites.

South et al. (2005) examine Hispanic spatial assimilation and inter-neighborhood geographic mobility. Their longitudinal analysis of seven hundred Mexican, Puerto Rican, and Cuban immigrants followed from 1990 to 1995 finds broad support for hypotheses derived from the classical account of assimilation into American society. High income, English-language use, and embeddedness in American social contexts increased Latin American immigrants' geographic mobility into multi-ethnic neighborhoods. US citizenship and years spent in the United States were positively associated with geographic mobility into different neighborhoods, and coethnic contact was inversely associated with this form of mobility, but these associations operated largely through other predictors. Prior experiences of ethnic discrimination increased and therefore decreased the likelihood that Latino immigrants would move from their original neighborhoods, while residing in metropolitan areas with large Latino populations led to geographic moves into &quot;less Anglo&quot; census tracts.&lt;ref&gt;South, Scott J.; Crowder, Kyle; and Chavez, Erick. &quot;Geographic Mobility and Spatial Assimilation among U.S. Latino Immigrants.&quot; ''International Migration Review'' 2005 39(3): 577â607. Issn: 0197-9183&lt;/ref&gt;

== Segregation Issues ==
In 2000, over nine million Mexicans Americans lived in areas considered highly segregated socially.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;&gt;Martin, Michael E. Residential Segregation Patterns of Latinos in the United States, 1990â2000. New York: Routledge, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Segregated Neighborhoods ===
[[File:Los Angeles County Mexican 2000.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of Los Angeles County showing percentage of population self-identified as ''Mexican'' in ancestry or national origin by census tracts. Heaviest concentrations are in East L.A, Echo Lake/Silver Lake, South Central, San Fernando and San Pedro/Wilmington.]]

Neighborhoods with a high percentage of individuals who claim Latino ancestry are commonly referred to as &quot;barrios&quot; or &quot;colonias.&quot; When translated from Spanish to English, barrio signifies &quot;district&quot; or &quot;quarter&quot; while colonia is the corresponding Mexican Spanish word.

A barrio has been defined as &quot;a place where Latino immigrants can express communal culture and language within the larger American culture.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;/&gt; In other words, the barrio is a sort of sanctuary for Spanish-speaking immigrants who may not yet be fully adjusted to the United States. In the barrio, they can converse in their native language, allowing one to communicate, find a job, and seek help with less pressure of speaking a second language. It is a place where Latino culture thrives and a source of comfort to a recent immigrant, as it would offer him or her a place to work and live while perfecting fluency of the English language.

However, some argue that the barrio also represents the inequality faced by many Mexican Americans in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;/&gt; Barrios usually offer a lower quality of education, provide poorer jobs than other neighborhoods, and generally receive less government attention than wealthier more integrated Hispanic neighborhoods.

=== Housing Market Practices ===
{{Hispanic and Latino Americans|right}}

Studies have shown that the segregation among Mexican Americans and Mexican immigrants seems to be declining. One study found that Mexican American applicants were offered the same housing terms and conditions as Anglo Americans. They were asked to provide the same information (regarding employment, income, credit checks, etc.) and asked to meet the same general qualifications of their Anglo peers.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot;&gt;James, Franklin J., and Eileen A. Tynan. Minorities in the Sunbelt. New Jersey: The State University of New Jersey, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in this same study, it was found that Mexican Americans were more likely than Anglo Americans to be asked to pay a security deposit or application fee.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt; Another interesting aspect of this study is that the Mexican American applicants were more likely to be placed onto a waiting list than the Anglo Americans applicants.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated7&quot; /&gt;

=== Latino Segregation versus Black Segregation ===
Historically, Blacks have faced much harsher treatment concerning segregation than any other racial, ethnic, or ancestral group. When comparing the segregation of Mexican Americans to that of Black Americans, there are two important facts that one must understand.

First, &quot;Latino segregation is less severe and fundamentally different than Black residential segregation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot;/&gt; Studies have shown that the separation of Latinos is more likely to be due to factors such as lower socioeconomic status and immigration while the segregation of African Americans is more likely to be due to larger issues such as racism. While Asians, Hispanics, and Amerindians may find themselves less segregated as they move up the socioeconomic ladder, many African Americans often continue to be spatially separated from Whites regardless of their socioeconomic status.

=== Segregated Schools ===
During certain periods, Mexican American children sometimes were forced to register at &quot;Mexican schools&quot;, where classroom conditions were poor, the school year was shorter, and the quality of education was substandard.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot;&gt;Ferg-Cadima, James A. Black, White and Brown:. Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Apr. 28, 2008 &lt;http://www.maldef.org/publications/pdf/LatinoDesegregationPaper2004.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Various reasons for the inferiority of the education given to Mexican American students have been listed by James A. Ferg-Cadima including: inadequate resources, poor equipment, unfit building construction, shortened school year (see below), failure to prevent drop out, limited access to high school, a watered down curriculum, poor instruction, disproportionate suspension, expulsion, harassment and non-enforced attendance rules.

In 1923, the Texas Education Survey Commission found that the school year for some non-white groups was 1.6 months shorter than the average school year.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot; /&gt; This may be connected to the fact that minority labor was needed during this time. As the agricultural field required the cheap labor provided by exploited minorities, it has been suggested that the minority school year was shortened to allow for these students to work instead of receive the extra 1.6 months of education.

Some have interpreted the shortened school year as a &quot;means of social control&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated5&quot; /&gt; implementing policies to ensure that Mexican Americans would maintain the unskilled labor force required for a strong economy. A lesser education would serve to confine Mexican Americans to the bottom rung of the social ladder. By limiting the number of days that Mexican Americans could attend school and allotting time for these same students to work, in mainly agricultural and seasonal jobs, the prospects for higher education and upward mobility were slim.

=== Immigration and Segregation ===
Immigration hubs are popular destinations for Latino immigrants. They are increasing in size and continue to be highly segregated. The largest immigration hubs include Los Angeles, New York, and Chicago.  The highly segregated areas of these cities have historically served the purpose of allowing immigrants to become comfortable in the United States, accumulate wealth, and eventually leave.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot;&gt;White, Michael J., Catherine Bueker, and Jennifer E. Glick. The Impact of Immigration on Residential Segregation Revisited. &lt;http://www.brown.edu/Departments/Sociology/faculty/mwhite/documents/impact_of_immigration_on_residential_segregation_revisited.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The historical view of immigration hubs sees these cities as temporary starting points for immigrants. They are not expected to live their entire lives within the United States inside segregated areas. Rather, they are expected to accumulate enough wealth to start a life within the larger society.

This model of immigration and residential segregation, explained above, is the model which has historically been accurate in describing the experiences of Latino immigrants. However, the patterns of immigration seen today no longer follows this model. This old model is termed the standard spatial assimilation model. More contemporary models are the polarization model and the diffusion model{{Clarify|date=August 2009}}.

The spatial assimilation model posits that as immigrants would live within this country's borders, they would simultaneously become more comfortable in their new surroundings, their socioeconomic status would rise, and their ability to speak English would increase.  The combination of these changes would allow for the immigrant to move out of the barrio and into the dominant society. This type of assimilation reflects the experiences of immigrants of the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated9&quot; /&gt; Recent, more contemporary, models of residential segregation are the polarization model and the diffusion model are described below.

Polarization model suggests that the immigration of non-Black minorities into the United States further separates Blacks and Whites, as though the new immigrants are a buffer between them.  This creates a hierarchy in which Blacks are at the bottom, Whites are at the top, and other groups fill the middle.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt; In other words, the polarization model posits that Asians and Amerindians are less segregated than their African American peers because White American society would rather live closer to Asians or Amerindians than Blacks.

The diffusion model has also been suggested as a way of describing the immigrant's experience within the United States. This model is rooted in the belief that as time passes, more and more immigrants enter the country. This model suggests that as the United States becomes more populated with a more diverse set of peoples, stereotypes and discriminatory practices will decrease, as awareness and acceptness increase. The diffusion model predicts that new immigrants will break down old patterns of discrimination and prejudice, as one becomes more and more comfortable with the more diverse neighborhoods that are created through the influx of immigrants.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated6&quot; /&gt; Applying this model to the experiences of Mexican Americans forces one to see Mexican American immigrants as positive additions to the &quot;American melting pot,&quot; in which as more additions are made to the pot, the more equal and accepting society will become.

=== Overcrowding ===
The issue of overcrowding is closely related to the issue of segregation and immigration.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} As immigrants enter the country, they are likely to settle in areas where their friends, family, or simply other who share their culture, have settled.  It is not uncommon for many members of families, extended families, or friends, to live in what is considered &quot;overcrowded&quot; conditions.

A large aspect of the segregation of Latinos within the United States is overcrowding.  Rates of overcrowding among Latinos, especially in American suburbs, are high.  The U.S. Census Bureau considers a residence to be overcrowded if there is more than one person per room&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated10&quot;&gt;Roth, Benjamin J. The Latino Community in Suburban Chicago: an Analysis of Overcrowding. Latinos United. &lt;http://www.latinopolicyforum.org/drupal55/files/Overcrowding_Report.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various explanations for overcrowding. One widely held belief about overcrowding is based on a stereotype of living in close proximity simply to cultural preference. To expand on that point, it is widely believed that immigrant Hispanic families live in dense households because of their desire to remain in close proximity with extended family. However, this view does not paint the entire picture.  Some families may live under one roof by choice and it is possible that Hispanic people may have different cultural standards than other population groups, thus allowing them to be more comfortable living with extended family underneath the same roof.  However, one cannot reduce all problems of Hispanic overcrowding to cultural preference, as this offers an incomplete understanding of the issue at hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated10&quot; /&gt;

Hispanic people may live in overcrowded conditions out of economic necessity and simply because they choose to live differently than others. Lack of affordable housing and a poor selection of well-paying occupations may combine to create the necessity of many living close together.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated10&quot; /&gt; Because one certain family may find very few opportunities for sufficient housing or find themselves without adequate funds for a house of their own, they may be forced to live in crowded conditions.

[[File:San Jose May Day 01.jpg|thumb|180px|right|Chicanas/os march in Northern California's largest city, [[San Jose, California|San Jose]] in 2006.]]

In the heady days of the late 1960s, when the student movement was active around the globe, the Chicano movement conducted actions such as the mass walkouts by high school students in Denver and East Los Angeles in 1968 and the [[Chicano Moratorium]] in Los Angeles in 1970. The movement was particularly strong at the college level, where activists formed [[MEChA]], an organization that seeks to promote Chicano unity and empowerment through education and political action, but also espouses [[revanchism|revanchist]] ideals centered around &quot;taking back&quot; the American southwest for Mexicans. The Chicano Moratorium, formally known as the National Chicano Moratorium Committee, was a movement of Chicano anti-war activists that built a broad-based but fragile coalition of Mexican-American groups to organize opposition to the [[Vietnam War]]. The committee was led by activists from local colleges and members of the &quot;[[Brown Berets]]&quot;, a group with roots in the high school student movement that staged walkouts in 1968, known as the [[East L.A. walkouts]], also called &quot;blowouts&quot;. The best known historical fact of the Moratorium was the death of [[RubÃ©n Salazar]], known for his reporting on civil rights and police brutality. The official story is that Salazar was killed by a [[tear gas]] canister fired by a member of the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] into the Silver Dollar CafÃ© at the conclusion of the August 29 rally.

=== A Dynamic Community ===
{{Refimprove|date=May 2009}}
In the 1990s and 2000s, the [[Midwestern United States]] became a major destination for Mexican immigrants. But Mexican-Americans were already present in the Midwest's industrial cities and urban areas. Esp. Mexicans/Latinos came into states like [[Illinois]] (mostly in [[Chicagoland]]), [[Indiana]] esp. the [[Northern Indiana|Northern]] section, [[Iowa]], [[Kansas]], [[Michigan]] (i.e. the Detroit metropolitan area), [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Nebraska]] and [[Wisconsin]] due to needs of the region's industrial manufacturing base.

Another destination of Mexican and Latin American immigration was the Northeastern United States, in places such as the [[Monongahela Valley]], [[Pennsylvania]]; [[Mahoning Valley]], [[Ohio]]; throughout [[Massachusetts]] and the state of [[Rhode Island]]; [[New Haven, Connecticut]] along with other Latin American nationalities; Washington, D.C. with [[Maryland]] and [[Northern Virginia]] included; the [[Hudson Valley]] and [[Long Island]] of New York state; the [[Jersey Shore]] region and the [[Delaware Valley]], [[New Jersey]]. 

Communities that consist mostly of recent-arrived immigrants from Mexico, are also present in other parts of the rural Southeastern United States, in states such as [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Maryland]], [[Tennessee]], [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]] and [[Oklahoma]]. A growing Mexican-American population is also present in urban areas such as [[Orlando, Florida]] with the [[Central Florida]] region included; the [[Atlanta]] metro area; [[Charlotte, North Carolina]]- with a majority Hispanic enclave of Eastland; New Orleans which increased after Hurricane Katrina in Sep. 2005; the [[Hampton Roads]], [[Virginia]] area; the states of [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]] and [[Delaware]]; and [[Pennsylvania]] esp. in the [[Philadelphia]] metropolitan area â the area's largest Mexican community.
