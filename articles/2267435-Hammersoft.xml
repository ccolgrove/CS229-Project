'''Scotty's Castle''' is a two-story [[Mission Revival Style architecture|Mission Revival]] and [[Spanish Colonial Revival architecture|Spanish Colonial Revival]] style [[villa]] located in the [[Grapevine Mountains]] of northern [[Death Valley]] in [[Death Valley National Park]], [[California]], [[U.S.]]. It is also known as '''Death Valley Ranch'''. Scotty's Castle is not a real [[castle]], and it did not belong to the &quot;Scotty&quot; from whom it got its name.

==History==
Construction began on Scotty's Castle in 1922, and cost between $1.5 and $2.5 million.  A man named [[Walter E. Scott|Walter Scott]] born in [[Cynthiana, Kentucky]], also known as âDeath Valley Scottyâ, convinced [[Chicago]] millionaire Albert Johnson to invest in his gold mine in the Death Valley area. By 1937, Johnson had acquired more than {{convert|1500|acre}} in [[Grapevine Canyon (Death Valley)|Grapevine Canyon]], where the ranch is located.

After Johnson and his wife made several trips to the region, and his health improved, construction began. It was Mrs. Johnson's idea to build something comfortable for their vacations in the area, and the villa eventually became a winter home.

The Johnsons hired [[Martin de Dubovay]] as the architect, [[Mat Roy Thompson]] as the engineer and head of construction, and [[Charles Alexander MacNeilledge]] as the designer.&lt;ref name=&quot;nris&quot; /&gt;

Unknown to the Johnsons, the initial survey was incorrect, and the land they built Death Valley Ranch on was actually government land; their land was further up Grapevine Canyon. Construction halted as they resolved this mistake, but before it could resume, the stock market crashed in 1929, making it difficult for Johnson to finish construction. Having lost a considerable amount of money, the Johnsons used the Death Valley Ranch to produce income by letting rooms out. The Johnsons died without heirs and had hoped that the National Park Service would purchase the property, and in 1970, the National Park Service purchased the villa for $850,000 from the Gospel Foundation, to which the Johnsons left the property.  Walter Scott, who was taken care of by the Gospel Foundation after Johnson's passing, died in 1954 and was buried on the hill overlooking Scotty's Castle next to a beloved dog.

==Tours==
The U.S. National Park Service gives guided tours of Scotty's Castle for a nominal fee. Park rangers dress in 1930s style clothes to help take the visitor back in time.  During the tour, guests are treated to the sounds of a 1,121 pipe [[Welte-Mignon|Welte]] [[theater organ]]. An underground mystery tour is also available for those wishing to see the inner-workings of the building. One-quarter of a mile of tunnels run under the building, where visitors can visit the powerhouse and see thousands of tiles that were to be used for the never-finished swimming pool. The main house tour is [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990|ADA]] accessible, but the underground tour is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nps.gov/deva/historyculture/scottys-castle.htm|title=Scotty's Castle|publisher=National Park Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Water and electricity==
The springs of Grapevine Canyon provided the water supply for the ranch and were used to generate electricity. The springs, located about {{convert|300|ft}} higher than the villa, generated enough water flow and pressure to turn a [[Pelton wheel]], which ran the generator that furnished the villa's electricity.  The springs provided enough water to meet all the needs of the ranch, with enough left for other uses.  A water fountain was constructed in the Great Hall, where water dripped down a rock face creating evaporative cooling and into a catch basin for recirculation.

==Additional info==
Both the Scotty's Castle Visitor Center and the Castle Museum are currently open year-round, and approximately 100,000 people tour the villa each year. The Johnsons' original furnishings and clothing can still be seen today. The ranch is located about 45 miles north of [[Stovepipe Wells, California]], on Highway 267, about a three-hours drive from [[Las Vegas metropolitan area|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nps&quot;/&gt;
