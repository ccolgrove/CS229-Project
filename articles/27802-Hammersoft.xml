'''Seymour Papert''' (born February 29, 1928 in [[Pretoria, South Africa]]) is an [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] [[mathematician]], [[computer science|computer scientist]], and [[education|educator]]. He is one of the pioneers of [[artificial intelligence]], as well as an inventor of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo programming language]].

==Early years and education==
Papert attended the [[University of the Witwatersrand]], receiving a B.A. in 1949 and a PhD in [[mathematics]] in 1952. He then went on to receive another PhD, also in mathematics, at [[Cambridge University]] in 1959.&lt;ref name=&quot;who's who&quot;&gt;Papert, Seymour A. in ''American Men and Women of Science'', R.R. Bowker. (1998-99, 20th ed). p. 1056.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a leading figure in the revolutionary socialist circle around [[Socialist Review]] while living in London in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Higgins: 
&quot;More Years for the Locust: The Origins of the SWP&quot; 
Published by IS Group, London, 1997. Chapter 5 page 1
&quot;Another South African, Seymour Papert â a man of considerable talent  ... was recruited by Kidron and, for a few years, he added considerably to the impact of Socialist Review. His review of John Stracheyâs, at that time very influential book, Contemporary Capitalism, for example, is an excellent attack on Strachey and, incidentally, one of the better statements on the permanent arms economy.&quot;
[http://www.marxists.org/archive/higgins/1997/locust/index.htm &quot;'More Years for the Locus' reproduced in the Marxist Internet Archive&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Papert worked as a researcher in a variety of places, including [[St. John's College, Cambridge]], the [[Henri Poincare Institute]] at the [[University of Paris]], the [[University of Geneva]] and the [[National Physical Laboratory, UK|National Physical Laboratory]] in London before becoming a research associate at [[MIT]] in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;who's who&quot;/&gt; He held this position until 1967, when he became professor of applied math and director of the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory|MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], until 1981; he also served as Cecil &amp; Ida Green professor of [[education]] at MIT from 1974-1981.&lt;ref name=&quot;who's who&quot;/&gt;

==Research and theories==
Papert worked on learning theories, and is known for focusing on the impact of new technologies on learning in general and in schools as learning organizations in particular.

===Constructionism===
At MIT, Papert went on to create the [[Genetic epistemology|Epistemology]] and Learning Research Group at the [[MIT School of Architecture and Planning|MIT Architecture Machine Group]] which later became the [[MIT Media Lab]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://el.media.mit.edu/ Epistemology and Learning homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; Here, he was the developer of an original and highly influential theory on learning called [[Constructionist learning|constructionism]], built upon the work of [[Jean Piaget]] in [[Constructivism (learning theory)|Constructivism learning theories]]. Papert worked with Jean Piaget at the University of Geneva from 1958 to 1963&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.media.mit.edu/~papert/ Papert page at MIT Media Lab]&lt;/ref&gt; and is widely considered the most brilliant and successful of Piaget's proteges; Piaget once said that &quot;no one understands my ideas as well as Papert.&quot; Papert has rethought how schools should work based on these theories of learning.

===Logo===
Papert used [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]]'s work in his development of the [[Logo (programming language)|Logo programming language]] whilst at MIT. He created Logo as a [[tool]] to improve the way that [[child]]ren think and solve the problems. A small [[robot]] called the &quot;[[Turtle (robot)|Logo Turtle]]&quot; was developed and children used it to solve problems. A main purpose of the [http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/ Logo Foundation] research group is to strengthen the ability to [[learning|learn]] [[knowledge]]. Papert insists a simple [[programming language|language]] or [[Computer program|program]] that children can learnâlike Logoâcan also have advanced functionality for expert users.

===Other work===
As part of his work with technology, Papert has been a proponent of the [[Knowledge Machine]]. He is also currently one of the principals for the [[One Laptop Per Child]] initiative to manufacture and distribute [[The Children's Machine]] in developing nations. 

Papert has also collaborated with [[Lego]] on their Logo-programmable [[Lego Mindstorms]] robotics kits.

==Influence and awards==
Papert's work has been highly influential to other researchers in the fields of education and computer science. He influenced the work of [[Uri Wilensky]] in the design of [[NetLogo]] and collaborated with him on the study of knowledge restructurations, as well as the work of [[Andrea diSessa]] and the development of dynaturtles. In 1981, Papert along with several others in the Logo group at MIT, started [[Logo Computer Systems Inc.]], of which he was Board Chair for over 20 years. Working with LCSI, Papert designed a number of award-winning programs, including LogoWriter&lt;ref&gt;see [http://www.siue.edu/~jandris/HTMLDocuments/ANDRIS/logow.html this history]&lt;/ref&gt; and Lego/Logo (marketed as [[Lego Mindstorms]]).  He also influenced the research of [[Idit Harel Caperton]], coauthoring articles and the book ''Constructionism'' and chairing the advisory board of the company [[MaMaMedia]]. He also influenced [[Alan Kay]] and the [[Dynabook]] concept, and worked with Kay on various projects. 

Papert won a [[Guggenheim fellowship]] in 1980, a [[Marconi Society|Marconi International]] fellowship in 1981,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marconifoundation.org/index.html Marconi Foundation - the Marconi Fellows]. Accessed March 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; the Software Publishers Association Lifetime Achievement Award in 1994, and the Smithsonian Award from ''Computerworld'' in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Henderson, Harry. 2003. ''A to Z of Computer Scientists.'' New York: Facts on File. p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; Papert has been called by [[Marvin Minsky]] &quot;the greatest living mathematics educator.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;From the cover of ''Mindstorms.'' (date needed).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Papert's third wife was [[Sherry Turkle]], and together they wrote the influential paper &quot;Epistemological Pluralism and the Revaluation of the Concrete.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Papert is married to [[Suzanne Massie|Suzanne Massie Papert]], who is a Russian scholar and author of ''Pavlovsk, Life of a Russian Palace'' and ''Land of the Firebird.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.suzannemassie.com/bio.html Suzanne Massie's website]. Accessed April 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident in Hanoi==
While attending the [http://www.tatvietnam.com/conference/ 17th ICMI Study conference] in [[Hanoi]], Papert was struck by a [[motorcycle]] while crossing a road near his hotel on Tuesday December 5, 2006.  He underwent [[brain surgery]] at the [[L'HÃ´pital FranÃ§ais De HanoÃ¯|French Hospital of Hanoi]] on Wednesday December 6 to remove the [[blood clot]] that had formed.  By the evening of Tuesday December 12, he was in stable but critical condition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Megan Tench |title=Top MIT scientist injured in Vietnam |date=2006-12-08|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2006/12/08/top_mit_scientist_injured_in_vietnam/ |work=Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 16, 2006 he was transferred by air ambulance to [[Boston]], [[Massachusetts]], and on January 23, 2007 he was transferred to a hospital in his home state of [[Maine]].  In March 2007, he suffered an attack of [[septicemia]], which required treatment in the hospital until May.  Another problem occurred in April, when he had to have a heart valve replaced due to the septicemia. {{As of|2008}}, he has fully recovered from the septicemia and heart operation, and can think clearly, walk &quot;almost unaided&quot;, and communicate. However, he still has &quot;some complicated speech problems&quot;, and is still undergoing extensive rehabilitation, although he is at home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thelearningbarn.org thelearningbarn.org] ([http://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.thelearningbarn.org&amp;date=2008-03-25 copy]) (aka. the Seymour Papert Institute) (verified through the IRS as being a 501(c)3, as they claim)&lt;/ref&gt;

His rehabilitation team is using some of the very principles of experiential, hands-on learning which he pioneered to aid him in recovery.
