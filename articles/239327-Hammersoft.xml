'''Wake Forest University''' is a [[Private university|private]], coeducational [[university]] in the U.S. state of [[North Carolina]], founded in 1834. The university received its name from its original location in [[Wake Forest, North Carolina|Wake Forest]], north of [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], the state capital. The Reynolda Campus, the university's main campus, is located north of downtown [[Winston-Salem, North Carolina|Winston-Salem]], after the university moved there in 1956. The [[Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center]] campus is located nearby. The University also occupies lab space at the Bowman Gray Technical Center, at the downtown Piedmont Research Park, and at the Center for Nanotechnology and Molecular Materials. The University's [[Babcock Graduate School of Management]] maintains a presence on the main campus in Winston-Salem and in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]].

In the 2011 U.S. News America's Best Colleges report, Wake Forest ranked 25th overall among national universities, tied with the University of Virginia and the University of California, Los Angeles. Additionally, the same report ranked Wake Forest University 12th overall in terms of Best Undergraduate Teaching among national universities.

In the 2009 BusinessWeek Undergraduate Business Schools Rankings, the Calloway School of Business and Accountancy was ranked 14th overall, and first in terms of Academic Quality.

==History==
Wake Forest University was founded after the North Carolina [[Baptist]] State Convention purchased a {{convert|600|acre|kmÂ²|1|sing=on}} plantation from Dr. [[Calvin Jones (NC physician)|Calvin Jones]] in an area north of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]] ([[Wake County, North Carolina|Wake County]]) called the &quot;Forest of Wake.&quot; The new school, designed to teach both Baptist ministers and laymen, opened on February 3, 1834, as the Wake Forest Manual Labor Institute, named because students and staff were required to spend half of each day doing manual labor on the plantation. Dr. [[Samuel Wait]], a Baptist minister, was selected as the &quot;principal,&quot; later president, of the institute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wfu.edu/history/HST_WFU/perry.html History of Wake Forest University&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:UpperQuad ACB.jpg|right|thumb|Wait Chapel located on the Hearn Plaza (or the 'Upper Quad').]]
In 1838, it was renamed Wake Forest College, and the manual labor system was abandoned. The town that grew up around the college came to be called the town of [[Wake Forest, North Carolina|Wake Forest]]. In 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], the school closed due to the loss of most students and some faculty to service in the [[Confederate States Army]].  The College re-opened in 1866 and prospered over the next four decades under the leadership of presidents [[Washington Manley Wingate]], [[Thomas H. Pritchard]], and [[Charles Taylor (university president)|Charles Taylor]]. In 1894, the School of Law was established, followed by the School of Medicine in 1902. The university held its first summer session in 1921.

The leading college figure in the early 20th century was Dr. [[William L. Poteat]], a gifted [[biology|biologist]] and the first layman to be elected president in the collegeâs history. âDr. Billyâ continued to promote growth, hired many outstanding professors, and expanded the [[science]] curriculum. He also stirred upheaval among North Carolina Baptists with his strong support of teaching the theory of [[evolution]] but eventually won formal support from the Baptist State Convention for academic freedom at the College.

[[File:BensonCenter ACB.jpg|thumb|left|The Benson University Center]]
The School of Medicine moved to [[Winston-Salem]] (then North Carolina's second-largest city) in 1941 under the supervision of Dean [[Coy Cornelius Carpenter]], who guided the school through the transition from a two-year to a four-year program. The school then became the [[Bowman Gray]] School of Medicine. The following year, 1942, Wake Forest admitted its first female undergraduate students, after [[World War II]] dramatically depleted the pool of male students.

In 1946, as a result of large gifts from the [[Z. Smith Reynolds Foundation]], the entire college agreed to move to Winston-Salem, a move that was completed for the beginning of the fall 1956 term, under the leadership of Dr. Harold W. Tribble. Charles and Mary Babcock (daughter of [[R. J. Reynolds]]) donated to the college about {{convert|350|acre|kmÂ²|1}} of fields and woods at &quot;Reynolda,&quot; their estate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite|title=www.journalnow.com/servlet/Satellite&lt;!--INSERT TITLE--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1952 to 1956, fourteen new buildings were constructed on the new campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;The Undergraduate Schools: Bulletin of Wake Forest University 2007â2008&lt;/ref&gt; These buildings were constructed in [[Georgian (architecture)|Georgian]] style.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; The old campus in Wake Forest was sold to the Baptist State Convention to establish the [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]].

A graduate studies program was inaugurated in 1961, and in 1967 the school became the fully accredited Wake Forest University. The [[Babcock Graduate School of Management]] was established in 1969. The [[James R. Scales Fine Arts Center]] opened in 1979. In 1986, Wake Forest gained autonomy from the Baptist State Convention of North Carolina and established a fraternal relationship with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://revgil.blogspot.com/2007/02/wake-forest-university-and-baptist.html|title= address given by Bill Leonard, dean of the Divinity School, at the spring 2007 convocation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wfu.edu/wfunews/1999/111799h.htm|title=Hearn says Wake Forest remains committed to its Baptist heritage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thirteenth president of Wake Forest is [[Nathan O. Hatch]], former provost at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. Hatch was officially installed as president on October 20, 2005. He assumed office on July 1,  2005, succeeding [[Thomas K. Hearn, Jr.]], who had retired after 22 years in office.

===Political, social===
On March 17, 1978, President [[Jimmy Carter]] made a major National Security address in [[Wait Chapel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=30516|title=Address at Wake Forest University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twice the school has hosted [[United States presidential election debates|presidential debates]]. The first, between then-Vice President [[George H.W. Bush]] and Governor [[Michael Dukakis]] on September 25, 1988. The second matched then-Governor [[George W. Bush]] against Vice President [[Al Gore]] on October 11, 2000.  Both debates were hosted in [[Wait Chapel]].

In the predawn hours of April 18, 1978, students affixed a large Mickey Mouse to the {{convert|10|ft|m|adj=mid|-diameter}} clock face of Wait Chapel facing the Quad.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Criminal Charges Possible in WFU Mickey Mouse Prank&quot;, Winston-Salem Journal, April 19, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, 2007 Wait Chapel was the venue for a broadcast of [[National Public Radio]] (NPR) show, [[Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me]]. The show aired on September 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/programs/waitwait/|title= Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==
Since 1986, the university has produced 12 [[Rhodes Scholar]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.wfu.edu/2011/11/20/turner-named-rhodes-scholar/ | title=Turner named Rhodes Scholar | accessdate = 2011-11-21 | author=WFU News Service | date=2011-11-20  | publisher=Wake Forest University | quote=He is the 12th Wake Forest student to be named a Rhodes Scholar in the past 25 years}}&lt;/ref&gt; and numerous [[Marshall Scholarship|Marshall]] and [[Fulbright]] recipients.

===Undergraduate===
Wake Forest's undergraduate component consists of Wake Forest College (School of Arts and Science) and the Wayne Calloway School of Business and Accountancy. The university offers 34 majors and many interdisciplinary minors across various fields of study. In order to attend the Wayne Calloway School, students must make a special application to its program. The Calloway School offers a five-year accountancy program whereby a student earns a BS and an MS in Accountancy and qualifies to sit for the [[Certified Public Accountant|CPA]] exam after 5 years of combined undergraduate and graduate study.

In order to graduate, a Wake Forest student must finish a basic set of classes and a set of divisional classes. The basic set of classes includes a first-year seminar, a writing seminar, health and PE classes, and foreign language literature. The latter usually requires students to take additional languages classes first. Languages available include Spanish, French, German, Latin, Greek, Japanese, Chinese, Arabic, and others.

About 89% of Wake Forest professors hold the terminal degree in their field. Wake Forest professors are expected to excel in both teaching and scholarship.

Wake Forest offers a number of [[study abroad]] programs for its undergraduates and, in the summers, for its [[law school]] students. About half of Wake Forest undergraduates spend at least one semester abroad.

===Physical activity options===
Wake Forest offers a vast array of possibilities for physical activity, be it for recreation or health.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}} The university offers classes in [[Yoga]], Dance, Boot Camp, etc. In addition, some classes are offered for credit on sports theory and practice, as well as several dance courses. Intramural Sports are also extremely popular and take place for a variety of sports, depending on the season.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}  The university rec center, Reynolds Gym, is the oldest gym in the ACC.  The university is in the planning process for a new rec center to replace the aging Reynolds Gym and the now inadequate Miller Fitness Center.

===Dining facilities===
Every Wake Forest undergraduate student who lives on campus is required to sign up for some form of a meal plan in coordination with [[Aramark]]. The meals can be consumed in the main dining facility known as &quot;The Pit&quot; or the [[Magnolia]] Room, both of which are located at Reynolda Hall, in the center of the campus. At the neighboring Benson Center, students can buy food and snacks independent of their meal plan from Aramark or from [[Chick-fil-A]]. A [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway]] is also located on campus, off Hearn Plaza.

In the fall of 2005, Aramark, through its Fresh Foods Company, renovated &quot;The Pit&quot; in an attempt to improve the quality of the dining experience. The newly renovated area contains a variety a food stations with a &quot;cooked upon order&quot; service.  As of October 6, 2008, there has been a full-service [[Starbucks]] in the library.

*[[WFDD]] is the broadcast service of Wake Forest University, with a signal of 36,000 watts broadcasting to 32 counties in North Carolina and [[Virginia]].
*''WAKE Radio'' is a student-run [[internet]] radio station. Students regularly broadcast shows ranging from political talk to underground indie music hours.
*''The Student'' is a student-run website created and run by students to help integrate the student body to academic activities and social events around campus and the Winston-Salem area.
*Wake Forest University's school newspaper is the ''Old Gold &amp; Black'' (OGB), named for the school's colors. Published weekly from an office in Benson University Center, the ''[[Old Gold &amp; Black]]'' is produced by a group of student editors, reporters and photographers.

*''Notice'' is a student-made magazine funded by ''Three to Four Ounces'' and designed to enlighten the students of Wake Forest about the creative people surrounding them. The project's intent is to celebrate and encourage creativity on campus in visual arts, music, writing, or any provocative form of expression.

===Undergraduate student housing===
Wake Forest undergraduate students are guaranteed on-campus housing for four years. For their first two years as a full time enrolled student, students are required to live on campus. Residence Life is divided into thirteen communities which are staffed by a graduate hall director and a staff of RAs (resident advisers) who facilitate community building and assume administrative responsibilities.  All student housing has air-conditioning, closets, wired/wireless internet access, cable television connections, and free unlimited washer/dryer usage. Every residence hall is equipped with at least one communal lounge area (with a big-screen television, sometimes a ping-pong table, pianos, etc.) and kitchen area. Student housing in Polo offers two-bedroom apartment-style living and four bedroom, two bathroom townhouse-style living, complete with furnished bedrooms, living room, and dining room furniture.

The thirteen community areas for the 2011â12 academic year are: Bostwick Hall, Johnson Hall, Babcock Hall, Luter Hall, Collins Hall, South Hall, Palmer/Piccolo Halls, Kitchin Hall, Davis Hall, Poteat/Huffman Halls, Taylor/Efird Halls, Polo/Martin/Roadhouses Area, and the Apartments Area.  Freshman housing is located in Collins, South, Babcock, Luter, Bostwick, and Johnson halls.

The office of Residence Life &amp; Housing boasts 105 undergraduate RAs, and 13 graduate hall directors.  Along with student staff, the RL&amp;H office supports two major residential student organizations: the Resident Student Association, and the National Residence Hall Honorary.

===Student union===
The event-planning arm of Wake Forest is undergraduate student led and run organization known as Student Union. Student union projects include such events as [[Homecoming]], Family Weekend, Special Lectures, Concert Events, and the Coffeehouse music series.

Their most celebrated and well-attended event is the annual &quot;Shag on the Mag&quot; that occurs on the Manchester Quad (formerly the Magnolia Quad) each spring and was begun in 2005 by then Springfest Chairman Joseph Bumgarner. A big tent covering the entire quad is laid out and students [[shag]] dance together to a live band.

===Student government===
Wake Forest Student Government (known as SG) works under a [[Semi-presidential system|semi-Presidential system]].

The core component is the General Assembly, which acts as a student legislature. The General Assembly is made up of legislators, represented and voted by each residence hall. The legislators are assigned within one of six committees to specialize in a particular area of student needs.

[[File:DemonDeaconACB.jpg|right|thumb|Wake Forest University Mascot Demon Deacon]]

Originally, Wake Forest's athletic teams were known as the Fighting Baptists, due to its association with the Baptist Convention (from which it later separated itself). However, in 1923, after a particularly impressive win against the [[Duke University|Duke]] [[Duke Blue Devils|Blue Devils]], a newspaper reporter wrote that the Deacons &quot;fought like Demons&quot;, giving rise to the current team name, the &quot;'''[[Demon Deacon]]s'''.&quot;

Wake Forest has won a total of eight national championships in four different sports; four of these championships have come in the past six years. Wake Forest is sometimes referred to as being a part of &quot;[[Tobacco Road]]&quot; or &quot;The Big Four,&quot; terms that refer to the four North Carolina schools that compete heatedly against each other within the ACC; these include [[Duke University|Duke]], [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]], and [[North Carolina State]], as well as Wake Forest.

The Demon Deacons participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA's]] Division I (in the [[Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]] for [[college football|football]]) and in the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]].

The [[Athletic director|Athletics Director]] is Ron Wellman.

They won the 2006 ACC Atlantic Division Title and went on to defeat the [[2006 Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]] 9-6 on December 2 in the ACC Championship Game in Jacksonville, FL. The win sent Wake Forest to the [[Orange Bowl (game)|Orange Bowl]] to play the Big East champion [[Louisville Cardinals football|Louisville Cardinals]], where they lost 24â13. However, this made Wake Forest the smallest school to ever compete in the [[Bowl Championship Series]]. Of all schools that play Division I FBS football, only [[Rice University|Rice]] and [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]] have smaller undergraduate enrollments, and Wake has the smallest undergraduate enrollment of any school in the [[BCS conference]]s.

For his part in the record-setting season, coach [[Jim Grobe]] was unanimously selected ACC Coach of the Year, and handily won the AP Coach of the Year award several weeks later. Coach Grobe signed a ten-year contract in 2003.

====2007 Season====
{{main|2007 Wake Forest Demon Deacons football team}}
Wake Forest followed its success in 2006 with another excellent year and finished the regular season with a record of 8 wins and 4 losses. During the season, the Demon Deacons were briefly ranked in the Top 25. Their success throughout the year earned Wake Forest an invitation to the Meineke Car Care Bowl in Charlotte, North Carolina. Played on December 29 in the Bank of America stadium (home of the Carolina Panthers) the Demon Deacons defeated the Connecticut Huskies 24-10.

Wake Forest's head coach, Jim Grobe, continues to garner national attention as an outstanding college football coach. Though he was offered coaching positions at other schools, Grobe chose to remain with the Deacons, citing a desire to remain at an institution that successfully balances high-level academics with a major athletic program.

Wake Forest plays its home football games at [[BB&amp;T Field]] (formerly Groves Stadium).

===Screamin' Demons===
Student attendance of [[Wake Forest Football]] and [[Basketball]] games is high, in part due to the program known as &quot;Screamin' Demons.&quot; At the beginning of each respective athletic season students on the Reynolda Campus can sign up for the program whereby they pay $15 for each season; in addition to the best seats at the games, this gets students a football shirt in the fall and a tie-dye t-shirt in the spring along with a card that serves as an automatic pass to the sporting events. They lose this privilege if they miss two of the games. Through the planning of Sports Marketing and the Screamin' Demons program, basketball game seats in the students section are difficult to attain without participating in the Screamin' Demons program. The arena can seat only 2,250 of the 4,500 undergraduate students at Wake Forest. At least 150 seats are always set aside for non-Screamin Demons, who sit behind the 2,100 member group.

==Student organizations==
There are over 160 chartered student organizations of all sorts. Student sports organizations are highly visible on campus. Special interest organizations range from the academic, such the [[Model United Nations]] team, to the artistic, such as the [[handbell]] choir.

Both the [[College Republicans]] and [[College Democrats]] have active chapters at the University. Historic student organizations such as the Philomathesians, an artistic literary magazine, are also present. Students are entertained by numerous performing groups, including The Lilting Banshee Comedy Troupe.

The Office of Student Development, led by [[Michael Gerald Ford]], son of [[Gerald R. Ford]], oversees all student organizations. Student Development also organizes leadership oriented student activities such as LEAD, a semester long course in campus leadership.

===Volunteer Service Corps===
The Volunteer Service Corps (VSC) is one of the most popular student organizations. It coordinates volunteering in both the local and international/national setting via service projects and trips. The organization has annual service trips to Russia, Vietnam, and Latin America. In light of the disaster caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]], VSC sent 30 Wake Students on a Wake Alternative Spring Break in the Spring of 2006.

===A cappella groups===
Wake Forest has a number of vibrant [[a cappella]] groups that produce annual records and have popular performances on and off campus.

===Army ROTC===
Wake Forest University offers only Army ROTC. In 2006 the Army ROTC program was awarded the MacArthur Award by the [[United States Army]] for having the best medium sized ROTC battalion in the nation. There are about sixty cadets in the program, and about half of each military science class finishes Leadership Development Advanced Camp ([[LDAC]]) as a &quot;Distinguished Military Graduate,&quot; the top 20% of ROTC graduates.

The minimum service commitment of a contracted cadet who graduates from ROTC is four years active duty and four years of inactive reserve duty after that. Alternatively, a cadet can choose to forgo active duty service and serve eight straight years in the active Reserve or National Guard. Other alternative service plans are available for those who intend to be an Army doctor, lawyer, or chaplain with source of commissioning via ROTC.

At Wake Forest contracted ROTC cadets are given full scholarship, a monthly stipend, and book money by the US Army. The university extends the scholarship with free room and board.

The program also serves students from [[Winston-Salem State University]] and [[Salem College]].

==Technology==
Wake Forest has received praise for its efforts in the field of technology. In 2003, The Princeton Review listed it as the number two &quot;Most Connected Campus&quot; in the [[United States]]. The University's Information Systems (IS) department has a program that issues new [[ThinkPad|Lenovo ThinkPad]] laptop computers to all undergraduate and graduate students and faculty. High speed wireless and wired Internet access is now provided across campus.
For undergraduate students living on campus, the university provides Resident Technology Advisors (RTAs), undergraduate students who also live on campus, trained to aid students with technical help for their laptops.

Information Systems, in cooperation with high technology firms like [[IBM]], [[AT&amp;T]], and [[Hewlett Packard|HP]], also actively engage in technology testing with members of the student body. These selected students participate through either co-payment or leasing plans in experimental uses of technology in education and college life through [http://www.wfu.edu/is/research/index.html IS Research and Development]. A recent program of this type was called MobileU and provided students involved in the program with PDA/phone combos and software to support educational and personal activities.

The University is a founding member of WinstonNet, a non-profit organization of educational and municipal institutions in [[Winston-Salem, NC]] that among other things provides a gigabit ethernet based regional [[point of presence]] (or, rPOP) for the [[North Carolina Research and Education Network]].

Wake Forest University provides faculty with access to high performance computing efforts locally with the WFU DEAC cluster and statewide with its participation in the NC Grid Computing Initiative. The statewide efforts are coordinated through the non-profit organization.
