'''Zentyal''' (formerly eBox Platform) is an [[open source]] unified network server software package (or a [[Unified Network Platform]]) for small and medium enterprises ([[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]]). Zentyal can act as a [[Gateway (telecommunications)|Gateway]], Network Infrastructure Manager, [[Unified threat management|Unified Threat Manager]], Office Server, [[Unified communications]] Server or a combination of them. Besides, Zentyal includes a [[Software framework|development framework]] to ease the development of new [[Unix]] based services.

The project's [[source code]] is available under terms of the [[GNU General Public License]], as well as under a variety of [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] agreements. Zentyal is owned and sponsored by a single for-profit firm, the Spanish company eBox Technologies S.L., which holds the copyright to the codebase.&lt;ref name=&quot;eBox Technologies S.L.&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== Development ==
Zentyal uses an open source model, with all the source code available for its users.

=== Design ===
Zentyal is a [[web application]] using [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] webserver with [[mod perl]] as foundation and [[Mason (Perl)|Mason]] components as building blocks, mainly written in object oriented [[Perl]], with some [[Javascript]] for visual improvements.

Its design incorporates modern programming techniques as:
* Design patterns: an [[Observer pattern|Observer]] design pattern is used mainly to integrate different modules across Zentyal. E.g. each service reports about which ports it needs to be open. Besides this, a [[Singleton pattern|Singleton]] holds global configuration and behavior details.
* Presentation and logic decoupling: user interface uses [[CSS]] and [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]], and include several Mason components, as a generic table used to configure services. Program logic is held inside [[library (computing)|library]] packages and [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]]-like code.
* Fault tolerance: errors and warnings are managed through software exceptions, flowing from core to its handling routine.

It also offers debugging facilities, integrating the layout of the execution stack of the Perl 5 interpreter.

Services are monitored and automatically respawned if they die.

=== Open source components ===
Zentyal is composed of open source software packages, mostly written in Perl:
* [[Apache HTTP Server|Apache]] [[web server]]
* [[mod_perl]] [[Common Gateway Interface|CGI]] engine
* [[OpenLDAP]] shared users and groups
* [[OpenSSL]] [[cryptography]]
* [[netfilter]]/[[iptables]] [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] and [[network address translation|NAT]]
* [[BIND]] [[Name server|DNS server]]
* [[Squid (software)|Squid]] [[proxy server]] and [[web cache]]
* [[DansGuardian]] [[content-control software]]
* [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]] [[Message transfer agent|mail transfer agent]]
* [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] [[instant messaging]]
* [[ntpd]] [[clock synchronization]]
* [[OpenVPN]] [[virtual private network]]
* [[Samba (software)|Samba]] shared storage and [[Primary Domain Controller|PDC]] for Windows clients
* [[CUPS]] shared printers
* [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] software installation and upgrade
* [[Asterisk (PBX)|Asterisk]] [[Voice over IP|VOIP]] services
* [[Snort (software)|Snort]] [[network intrusion detection system]]
* [[Zarafa_(software)|Zarafa]] or [[eGroupWare]] calendar sharing, address book, and webmail
* [[Dovecot (software)|Dovecot]] [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]] server

== Community ==
Main Zentyal community work and support takes place at Zentyal Forum.
