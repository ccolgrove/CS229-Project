'''Decapitation''' (from [[Latin]], ''caput'', ''capitis'', meaning head) is the separation of the [[human head|head]] from the body. '''Beheading''' typically refers to the act of intentional decapitation, e.g., as a means of [[murder]] or [[capital punishment|execution]]; it may be accomplished, for example, with an [[axe]], [[sword]], [[knife]], [[wire]], or by other more sophisticated means such as a [[guillotine]]. Ritualistic decapitation after execution by some other means, sometimes followed by public display of the severed head, has also been common throughout history. An [[executioner]] carrying out decapitations is called a ''headsman''.

Accidental decapitation can be the result of an [[explosion]], car or industrial accident,&lt;ref&gt;see [[Isadora Duncan#Death|Isadora Duncan]]&lt;/ref&gt; improperly administered execution by [[hanging]] or other violent injury. [[Suicide]] by decapitation is rare, but not unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/tyne/2974083.stm|title=Guillotine death was suicide|date=2003-04-24|work=BBC News|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Decapitation is quickly fatal to humans and most animals as [[brain death]] occurs within minutes without circulating oxygenated blood. However, some animals and insects (such as [[cockroaches]]) can survive decapitation, and die not because of it, but because of starvation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=fact-or-fiction-cockroach-can-live-without-head Fact or Fiction?: A Cockroach Can Live without Its Head: Scientific American&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[head transplantion]] by the reattachment of blood vessels has been successful with animals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last =Roach| first =Mary | year = 2004| title = [[Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers]]| publisher = W.W.

The word ''decapitation'' can also refer, on occasion, to the removal of the head from a [[human body|body]] that is already dead. This might be done to take the head as a [[headhunting|trophy]], for [[gibbet|public display]], to make the deceased more difficult to identify, for [[cryonics]] or for other reasons.


==History==
[[Image:Beheading Fac simile of a Miniature on Wood in the Cosmographie Universelle of Munster in folio Basle 1552.png|thumb|Beheadingâ[[facsimile]] of a miniature on wood in the ''Cosmographie Universelle'' of Munster: in folio, Basle, 1552.]]

===Honour===
Decapitation has been used as a form of [[capital punishment]] for millennia. The terms &quot;capital offence&quot;, &quot;capital crime&quot;, &quot;capital punishment,&quot; derive from the Latin ''caput'', &quot;head&quot;, referring to the punishment for serious offenses involving the forfeiture of the head; ''i.e.,'' death by beheading.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, edited by Noah Porter, published by G &amp; C. Merriam Co., 1913&lt;/ref&gt; Decapitation by sword (or axe, a military weapon as well) was sometimes considered the &quot;honorable&quot; way to die for an [[aristocracy|aristocrat]], who, presumably being a warrior, could often expect to die by the sword in any event; in England it was considered a privilege of noblemen to be beheaded. This would be distinguished from a &quot;dishonorable&quot; death on the [[gallows]] or through [[burning at the stake]]. In medieval England, [[high treason]] by nobles was punished by beheading; male commoner traitors, including [[knight]]s, were [[hanged, drawn and quartered]]; female commoner traitors were [[burned at the stake]].

In countries where beheading was the usual means of capital punishment, such as in Scandinavia, the noblemen would be beheaded with a sword, symbolizing their class as a military caste, thus dying by an instrument of war, while the commoners would be beheaded with an axe. {{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

===Painlessness===
If the [[headsman]]'s [[axe]] or [[executioner's sword|sword]] was sharp and his aim was precise, decapitation was quick and was presumed to be a relatively painless form of death. If the instrument was blunt or the executioner clumsy, however, multiple strokes might be required to sever the head.  The person to be executed was therefore advised to give a gold coin to the headsman to ensure that he did his job with care. [[Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex]], and [[Mary, Queen of Scots]], required three strikes at their respective executions.  [[Margaret Pole, 8th Countess of Salisbury]], required ten strokes before the fatal blow.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', v. XII p. II, p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:CosmasDamianfraangelico.jpg|thumb|left|300px|The Beheading of [[Cosmas and Damian]], by [[Fra Angelico]]]]

To ensure that the blow would be fatal, executioners' swords usually were blade-heavy two-handed swords. Likewise, if an axe was used, it almost invariably would be wielded with both hands. In England a special form of axe was used for beheadings, with the blade's edge extending downwards from the tip of the shaft.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

[[Finland]]'s official beheading axe resides today at the Museum of Crime in [[Helsinki]]. It is a broad-bladed two-handed axe. It was last used when murderer [[Tahvo Putkonen]] was executed in 1825, the last execution in peacetime in Finland.&lt;ref name=&quot;otonkoski-1&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Otonkoski|first=Pirkko-Leena|title=Henkirikoksista kuolemaan tuomittujen kohtaloita vuosina 1824-1825 Suomessa|journal=Genos|publisher=The Genealogical Society of Finland|volume=68|pages=55â69, 94â95|url=http://www.genealogia.fi/genos/68/68_55.htm|accessdate=14 December 2010|language=Finnish|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5uyNXe7J1|archivedate=23 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guillotine===
Decapitation by [[guillotine]] was a common, mechanically assisted form of [[capital punishment|execution]], invented shortly before the [[French Revolution]] (although an earlier version of the guillotine, the [[Halifax Gibbet]], was used in [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], England, from 1286 until the 17th century, and a version called the &quot;[[Maiden (beheading)|Maiden]]&quot; was used in [[Edinburgh]] during the 16th-18th centuries). The aim was to create a painless and quick form of execution that did not require great skill to carry out. The executioner, after chopping off the head, would hold it up to the crowd. There is some evidence that the head could remain conscious for up to ten seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bellows |first=Alan |title=Lucid Decapitation |url=http://www.damninteresting.com/lucid-decapitation/ |work=Damn Interesting |accessdate=August 16, 2011 |date=April 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The account of Dr. Beaurieux who observed the decapitation of a convict named Languille in 1905, may imply that the head could still see as he recounts &quot;Next Languille's eyes very definitely fixed themselves on mine and the pupils focussed themselves&quot; (A history of the guillotine, Alister Kershaw), though there are reasons to doubt the accuracy of Beaurieux's account.&lt;ref&gt;Dash, Mike.

Accessed 30 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The French had a strict code of etiquette surrounding such executions; a man named Legros, one of the assistants at the execution of [[Charlotte Corday]], was imprisoned for three months and dismissed for slapping the face of the victim after the blade had fallen in order to see whether any flicker of life remained.&lt;ref&gt;[[FranÃ§ois Mignet|Mignet, FranÃ§ois]], ''History of the French Revolution from 1789 to 1814'', (1824).&lt;/ref&gt; The guillotine was used in France during the French Revolution and remained the normal judicial method in both peacetime and wartime into the 1970s, although the [[firing squad]] was used in certain cases. France abolished the death penalty in 1981. The guillotine was also used in [[Algeria]] before the [[France|French]] relinquished control of it, as shown in [[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]''. Another guillotine existed in [[Vatican City]] until recent years.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} It had been brought in by [[Napoleon]]'s forces during the early 19th century; and, in 1870, the Pope still claimed the authority to use it.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} In recent times however, the Vatican has abolished capital punishment in its own jurisdiction, and recent [[Pope]]s have condemned capital punishment wherever it is still practised.

===German ''Fallbeil''===
Many German states had used a guillotine-like device known as a [[Fallbeil]] since the 17th and 18th centuries, and decapitation by guillotine was the usual means of execution in Germany until the abolition of the death penalty in West Germany in 1949. In [[Nazi Germany]], the guillotine was reserved for criminal convicts and political crimes including treason. A famous example of the guillotine being used was on the members of the [[White Rose]] resistance movement, a group of students in Munich that included siblings [[Sophie Scholl|Sophie]] and [[Hans Scholl]]. Contrary to popular myth, executions were generally not conducted face-up, and chief executioner [[Johann Reichhart]] was peculiarly insistent on maintaining &quot;professional&quot; protocol throughout the era, having administered the death penalty during the earlier Weimar era.  Nonetheless, the Nazis' use of the Fallbeil was chillingly routine.  It is estimated that some 16,500 persons were guillotined in Germany and Austria between 1933 and 1945. This number includes resistance fighters both in Nazi Germany itself and in those countries that were occupied by them. As these resistance fighters were not part of any regular army they were considered common criminals and were in many cases taken to Germany and decapitated.  Decapitation was considered a &quot;dishonorable&quot; death, unlike an &quot;honorable&quot; death: ''e.g.,'' [[execution by firing squad]].

===Propaganda===
In the days before photography, it was sometimes important to maintain some visual evidence for identification of executed criminals for public display as a form of political propaganda or intimidation. Public display of the severed head of a well-known person could serve this purpose.

====China====
[[File:Caishikou Beheaded Corpses2.jpeg|thumb|Ranked beheaded bodies on the ground, in ''Caishikou'' (the crossroad of vegetables market), [[Beijing]], [[China]], 1905]]
In traditional [[China]] decapitation was considered a more severe form of punishment than strangulation although strangulation caused more prolonged suffering. This was because in Confucian tradition bodies were gifts from their parents, and so it was therefore disrespectful to their ancestors to return their bodies to the grave dismembered. The Chinese however had other punishments, such as dismembering the body into multiple pieces (similar to English [[hanged, drawn and quartered|quartering]]). In addition, there was also a practice of cutting the body at the waist, which was a common way of execution before being abolished in early Qing dynasty due to the [[Slow slicing|lingering death]] caused.  In some tales, people did not die immediately after decapitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bbs.04gd.com/viewthread.php?tid=547&amp;fpage=1 åä¾æ¬é ­ä¿åæå³å»æ­»æ¢(ä»²è­è¬é)ä¸­åæå¥½å¤æ¬é ­æ¡ä¾!!]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://äººæ°ç½.cn/GB/kejiao/42/154/20030410/968308.html âæ å¤´äººâææä¼ ç»å»å­¦ äººç±»è¿æä¸ªâè¹èâ?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.66163.com/Fujian_w/news/fzwb/990124t/3-3.htm ç¦å·æå ±]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cst21.com.cn/3/hrt.htm æ¢äººå¤´]&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistan's government employs death by hanging for capital punishment. Since 2007, militants from Tehrek-e-Taliban Pakistan have used beheadings as a form of punishment for opponents, criminals and spies in the north west region of Pakistan. Severed heads of opponents or government officials in Swat were left on popular street corners in order to terrorize local population. The beheadings have stopped in Swat since the military incursion and sweep-up that began in May 2009 and ended in June 2009. Three Sikhs were [[February 2010 Sikh beheadings by Taliban|beheaded]] by the Taliban in Pakistan in 2010. [[Daniel Pearl]] was beheaded by his captors in the city of Karachi.

A video obtained by the [[Associated Press]] on April 20, 2007 shows a young boy, appearing to be around 12 years of age, beheading a man identified as [[Ghulam Nabi]], a Pakistani militant accused of betraying the [[Taliban]]. According to the AP report, &quot;A continuous 2Â½-minute shot then shows the victim lying on his side on a patch of rubble-strewn ground. A man holds Nabi by his beard while the boy, wearing a camouflage military jacket and oversized white sneakers, cuts into the throat. Other men and boys call out &quot;Allahu akbar!&quot; â &quot;God is great!&quot; â during the beheading. The film, overlain with [[nasheeds]], then shows the boy hacking and slashing at the man's neck until the head is severed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2007/4/21/apworld/20070421081329&amp;sec=apworld The Star Online] Video in Pakistan shows youngster beheading man for alleged betrayal of Taliban leader Dated: Saturday, April 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite official condemnation from religious scholars &lt;ref&gt;http://www.islamonline.net/English/News/2004-05/12/article08.shtml&lt;/ref&gt; and the state&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/south-asia/sgpc-punjab-government-condemn-sikh-beheading-in-pakistan_100324135.html SGPC, Punjab government condemn Sikh beheading in Pakistan&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; itself, such beheading continues to flourish in the Taliban strongholds of [[Baluchistan]] and [[Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa]] and are often jarred and unprofessional resulting in increased pain for the victim.

====Japan====
[[Image:LeonardGSiffleet.jpg|thumb|An Australian [[POW]] captured in New Guinea, Sgt. [[Leonard Siffleet]], about to be beheaded by the Japanese with a [[shin guntÅ]] sword, 1943.]]
In [[Japan]], decapitation was a common punishment, sometimes for minor offences. [[Samurai]] were often allowed to decapitate soldiers who had fled from battle, as it was considered cowardly. Decapitation was historically performed as the second step in [[seppuku]] (ritual [[suicide]] by [[disembowelment]]). After the victim had sliced his own [[abdomen]] open, another warrior would strike his head off from behind with a [[katana]] to hasten death and to reduce the suffering. The blow was expected to be precise enough to leave intact a small strip of skin at the front of the neckâto spare invited and honored guests the indelicacy of witnessing a severed head rolling about, or towards them; such an event would have been considered inelegant and in bad taste. The sword was expected to be used upon the slightest sign that the practitioner might yield to pain and cry outâavoiding dishonor to him and to all partaking in the privilege of observing an honorable demise. As skill was involved, only the most trusted warrior was honored enough to take part. In the late [[Sengoku period]], decapitation was performed as soon as the person chosen to carry out seppuku had made the slightest wound to his abdomen.

Decapitation (without seppuku) was also considered very severe and degrading form of punishment. One of the most brutal decapitations was that of Sugitani ZenjubÅ ([[:ja:æè°·åä½å]]), who attempted to assassinate [[Oda Nobunaga]], a prominent [[daimyo]] in 1570. After being caught, ZenjubÅ was buried alive in the ground with only his head out, and the head was slowly sawn off with a bamboo saw by passers-by for several days (Punishment of sawing; nokogiribiki; [[:ja:é¸æ½ã]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://kotobank.jp/word/%E5%96%84%E4%BD%8F%E5%9D%8A] Asahi Dictionary of Japanese Historical Figures&lt;/ref&gt; These unusual punishments were abolished in the early [[Meiji period|Meiji]] era.

====Korea====
Historically, decaptitation had been the most common method of execution in Korea, until it was replaced by [[hanging]] in 1896. Professional executioners were called &quot;Mangnani&quot; (ë§ëë) and belonged to the lowest class of people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=144883 Doosan Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thailand====
In Southern [[Thailand]], there were at least 15 cases where [[Buddhism|Buddhists]] have been beheaded in 2005. Thai officials suspect the attackers are part of the [[South Thailand insurgency|South Thailand Muslim insurgency]] who are seeking to separate the south end part from the rest of Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Buddhist decapitated in Thailand |url=http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,16055672-1702,00.html  |publisher=[[Herald Sun]] |date=2005-07-26 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070524123211/http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,16055672-1702,00.html |archivedate = May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  |title=Man beheaded, two shot dead the man was later found in a shallow grave.|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,16917051-23109,00.html  |publisher=[[News Limited]] |date=2005-10-14 |accessdate=2008-02-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070320180201/http://www.news.com.au/story/0,10117,16917051-23109,00.html |archivedate = March 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
====Classical Antiquity====
In the [[Roman Republic]] of the early 1st century BC, it became the tradition for the severed heads of public enemies â such as the opponents of [[Gaius Marius|Marius]] and [[Sulla]] for example â to be publicly displayed on the [[Rostra]] in the [[Forum Romanum]] after execution. Perhaps the most famous such victim was [[Cicero]] who, on instructions from [[Marc Antony]], had his hands (which had penned the ''[[Philippics]]'' against Antony) and his head cut off and nailed up for display in this manner.

====Bosnia and Herzegovina====
During the [[war in Bosnia and Herzegovina]] (1992â1995) there were a number of ritual beheadings of Serbs who were taken as prisoners of war by [[Bosnian mujahideen|mujahedin]] members of the [[Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Army]]. At least one case is documented and proven in court by the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia|ICTY]] where mujahedin, members of 3rd Corps of Army BiH, beheaded [[Serbs of Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian Serb]] Dragan PopoviÄ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/icty/pressreal/2006/p1054-e.htm UN - TRIBUNAL CONVICTS ENVER HADZIHASANOVIC AND AMIR KUBURA Press Release, March 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/icty/indictment/english/had-3ai030926e.htm UN - THIRD AMENDED INDICTMENT - THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL TRIBUNAL FOR THE FORMER YUGOSLAVIA]&lt;/ref&gt;
Another case of beheadings of Serbs is documented to have happened on Kazani, on [[TrebeviÄ]] mountain above Sarajevo. Mostly Serb civilians were killed by beheading, and later on thrown in the Kazani pit. These actions were performed by several soldiers of the 10th mountain brigade under the command of [[MuÅ¡an TopaloviÄ]] - Caco.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bhdani.com/arhiva/140/t402a.htm - 100 SVJEDOKA PROTIV 10.

====Germany====
*In July 1931, notorious serial killer [[Peter KÃ¼rten]], known as &quot;The Vampire of DÃ¼sseldorf&quot;, was executed on the guillotine in [[Cologne]].
* On 1 August 1933, in [[Altona, Hamburg|Altona]], [[Bruno Tesch (antifascist)|Bruno Tesch]] and three others were beheaded. These were the first executions in the [[Third Reich]]. The executions concerned the Altona Bloody Sunday (''Altonaer Blutsonntag'') riot, an [[Sturmabteilung|SA]] march on 17 July 1932 that turned violent and led to 18 people being shot dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asfpg.de/english/4763/17330.html asfpg ~ Altonaer Stiftung fÃ¼r philosophische Grundlagenforschung&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/157552/The-Axe-of-Wandsbek/overview | work=The New York Times | title=Movies: About Das Beil Von Wandsbek}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*In February 1935 [[Benita von Falkenhayn]] and [[Renate von Natzmer]] were beheaded with the axe and block in [[Berlin]] for espionage for [[Poland]]. Axe beheading was the only method of executions in Berlin until 1938, when it was decreed that all civil executions would henceforth be carried out by guillotine. However, the practice was continued in rare cases as late as [[Olga Bancic|in 1944]].
*In February 1943, university students [[Hans Scholl]], his sister [[Sophie Scholl]], and [[Christoph Probst]] of the [[White Rose]] protest movement, for distributing anti-war and anti-Nazi leaflets. Four other members of the [[White Rose]] were also executed by the Nazi [[People's Court (Germany)|People's Court]] later that same year.  The anti-Nazi [[Helmuth HÃ¼bener]] was also decapitated by Peopleâs Court order.
[[Image:Beheading duke somerset.jpg|thumb|200px|The execution of the [[Edmund Beaufort, 4th Duke of Somerset|Duke of Somerset]] after the [[battle of Tewkesbury]] in 1471.]]
*In May and September 1943 several Dutch members of the [[Wollweber League]] were beheaded with the axe.

Altogether, over 40,000 Germans were legally executed under the Nazi regime, most of them by guillotine.

====France====
Decapitation by guillotine was the only legal method of execution in France (in a few cases, the firing squad was used) from the time of the French Revolution until 1981, when President [[FranÃ§ois Mitterrand]]Â abolished capital punishment and issued commutations for those whose sentences had not been executed. It was last used in 1977, the last legal beheading in a democratic country.

====Nordic countries====
In [[Nordic countries]], decapitation was the usual means of carrying out capital punishment. Noblemen were beheaded with a [[sword]], and commoners with an [[axe]]. The last executions by decapitation in [[Finland]] in 1825, [[Norway]] in 1876, [[Faroe Islands]] in 1609, and in [[Iceland]] in 1830 were carried out with axes. The same was the case in [[Denmark]] in 1892. [[Sweden]] continued the practice for a few decades, executing its last criminal - mass murderer [[Johan Filip Nordlund]] - by manual cleaver in 1900, followed by the first and only execution by [[guillotine]] in 1910. 

Nordlund's execution was the last (legal) manual beheading in the Western worlds except for in Germany, where it prevailed until the days of [[World War II]] (see above).

The official beheading axe of Finland resides today in the Museum of Crime, [[Helsinki]].

====Spain====

In Spain executions were carried out by various methods including strangulation by the [[garrotte]]. In the 16th and 17th centuries, noblemen were sometimes executed by means of beheading. They were tied to a chair on a scaffold. The executioner used a knife to cut the head from the body. It was considered to be a more honourable death if the executioner started with cutting the throat.&lt;ref&gt;Execution of the Marquess of Ayamonte on the 11th. of December 1645 Described in &quot;Varios relatos diversos de Cartas de Jesuitas&quot; (1634â1648) Coll.

====Mexico====
[[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla]], [[Ignacio Allende]], [[JosÃ© Mariano JimÃ©nez]] and [[Juan Aldama]] were tried for treason, executed by [[firing squad]] and beheaded during the Mexican independence in 1811. Their heads were on display on the four corners of the [[AlhÃ³ndiga de Granaditas]], in [[Guanajuato]].

Recently during the [[Mexican Drug War]] some Mexican drug cartels have turned to decapitation of rival cartel members as a method of intimidation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Grayson&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fpri.org/enotes/200901.grayson.lafamilia.html | title=La Familia: Another Deadly Mexican Syndicate | author=George W.

====Saudi Arabia====
Saudi Arabian authorities beheaded four men in February 2007â Sangeeth Kumara, Victor Corea, Ranjith Silva and Sanath Pushpakumara.These four [[Sri Lanka]]n workers were convicted in a Saudi Arabian court for an armed robbery committed in October 2004. Their deaths sparked reactions from the international human rights group [[Amnesty International]], which called on the Saudi authorities to abolish the [[death sentence]]. The court also ruled that the bodies of the four workers be [[crucified]] for public view as an example for others. In most such cases the respective embassy is notified only after the execution, thereby eliminating chances for international or diplomatic protest.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/sinhala/news/story/2007/02/070223_saudi_hrw.shtml BBC&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iraq====

Though not officially sanctioned, legal beheadings were carried out against at least 50 prostitutes and pimps under [[Saddam Hussein]] as late as 2000.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article10190019.ab&lt;/ref&gt;

Beheadings have emerged as another [[terrorism|terror]] tactic especially in Iraq since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/14/movies/14TERROR.html &quot;The Terrorist as Auteur&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Civilians have borne the brunt of the beheadings, although U.S. and Iraqi military personnel have also been targeted. After kidnapping the victim, the kidnappers typically make some sort of demand of the government of the hostage's nation and give a time limit for the demand to be carried out, often 72 hours. Beheading is often threatened if the government fails to heed the wishes of the hostage takers. Frequently the crude beheadings are videotaped and made available on the Internet.  One of the most publicized of such executions was that of [[Nick Berg]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

Judicial execution is practiced in Iraq, but is generally carried out by [[hanging]].
