'''Xubuntu''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|z|uË|Ë|b|uË|n|t|uË}} {{Respell|zoo|BOON|too}}) is a [[Canonical Ltd.]] recognized, community maintained derivative of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[operating system]], using the [[Xfce]] [[desktop environment]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuAbout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/about|title = What is Xubuntu?|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuGlossary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/glossary|title = Glossary|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Derv&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ubuntu.com/products/whatisubuntu/derivatives|title = Products|accessdate = 2009-10-15|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name ''Xubuntu'' is a [[portmanteau]] of ''Xfce'' and ''Ubuntu''. Xfce originally was an abbreviation for ''XForms Common Environment'', while Ubuntu means &quot;humanity towards others&quot; in the [[Zulu language|Zulu]] and [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] languages.

==Goals==
Xubuntu's goals are to:

{{quote|provide an easy to use distribution, based on Ubuntu, using Xfce as the graphical desktop, with a focus on integration, usability and performance, with a particular focus on low memory footprint. The integration in Xubuntu is at a configuration level, a toolkit level, and matching the underlying technology beneath the desktop in Ubuntu. Xubuntu will be built and developed autonomously as part of the wider Ubuntu community, based around the ideals and values of Ubuntu.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strategy&quot; /&gt; }}

The Xfce desktop environment is intended to use fewer system resources than the default Ubuntu [[Unity_(desktop_environment)|Unity]] desktop. As recently as September 2010 the Xubuntu developers claimed that the minimum RAM Xubuntu could be run on was 128 MB, with 256 MB of RAM strongly recommended at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuGet&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/get|title = Get Xubuntu|accessdate = 8 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]] |authorlink = |year = 2010|month = September|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20100622083826/http://www.xubuntu.org/get |archivedate = 21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing conducted by Martyn Honeyford at [[IBM]] in January 2007 on Xubuntu 6.10 concluded that it &quot;uses approximately 25&amp;nbsp;MB less application memory, and also eats significantly less into buffers and cache (which may imply that there is less file activity) than Ubuntu.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Honeyford&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-linux-memory.html|title = Reduce your Linux memory footprint|accessdate = 24 December 2010|last = Honeyford|first = Martyn|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = January}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later testing showed that Xubuntu was at a disadvantage compared to [[Debian]] equipped with the Xfce desktop. Tests were conducted by [[DistroWatch]] on a Dell Dimension 4500 desktop machine, with an Intel 2 GHz processor and 384 MB of memory in April 2009, that compared Xubuntu 9.04 against an Xfce desktop version of Debian 5.0.1. These showed that Xubuntu used more than twice the RAM as Debian in simple tasks. Xubuntu also ran out of RAM doing everyday tasks, indicating that 384 MB of RAM was inadequate. The review concluded &quot;It was obvious I had already run out of RAM and was starting to use swap space. Considering I wasn't doing very much, this was rather disappointing&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;DW27Apr09&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090427#feature|title = Xubuntu 9.04 vs Debian 5.0.1 Xfce|accessdate = 24 December 2010|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent experimentation by Distrowatch concluded that the performance advantages observed in Debian were due to Xubuntu's inclusion of memory-hungry software not present in Debian's implementation of Xfce.&lt;ref name=&quot;DW27May04&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090504#feature|title = Minimal Xubuntu 9.04|accessdate = 13 April 2011|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Testing conducted on a later version, Xubuntu 9.10 beta, in September 2009 showed similar results. The tests, conducted by [[Linux Magazine (USA)|Linux Magazine]], concluded that Xubuntu 9.10 beta's RAM usage was actually greater than Ubuntu's 9.10 beta with GNOME.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.linux-mag.com/cache/7520/1.html|title = Lubuntu: Floats Like a Butterfly, Stings Like a Bee|accessdate = 2009-10-19|publisher = Linux Magazine|date = 9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Subsequent reviewers emphasized Xubuntu's perceived deficiencies in performance to highlight [[Lubuntu]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Barbu01Sep09&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/First-Lubuntu-Test-ISOs-Available-120608.shtml|title = First Lubuntu Test ISOs Available|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Barbu|first = Doru|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = September| work = Softpedia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG18Jan10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/01/lubuntu-10-04-alpha-1-visual-overview/|title = Lubuntu 10.04 Alpha 1 â Visual Overview|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = January| work = OMG Ubuntu}}&lt;/ref&gt; a project with similar goals but using the [[LXDE]] desktop environment as opposed to Xfce. For instance, Damien Oh of ''Make Tech Easier'' noted in May 2010, &quot;So what about Xubuntu? isnât it supposed to be the lightweight equivalent of Ubuntu? Sadly, that is a thing of the past. The truth is, the supposed lightweight equivalent is not lightweight at all. While Xubuntu is using the lightweight XFCE desktop environment, it had been bugged down by several heavyweight applications and also the integration with GNOME desktop also makes it lose its advantage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oh06May10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://maketecheasier.com/lubuntu-review-a-lightweight-ubuntu-variant/2010/05/06|title = Lubuntu Review: A Lightweight Ubuntu Variant|accessdate = 14 November 2010|last = Oh|first = Damien|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May| work = Make Tech Easier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of the Xubuntu 11.04 release the developers now &quot;strongly recommend&quot; 512 MB of RAM to use Xubuntu. This is the same as is recommended for [[Ubuntu 11.04]].&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuRequire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/get#requirements|title = Minimum system requirements|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuRequire&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://help.ubuntu.com/community/Installation/SystemRequirements#Low-spec%20computers%20(Xubuntu)|title = Low-spec computers (Xubuntu)|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008 |month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Xubuntu was originally intended to be released at the same time as Ubuntu 5.10 ''Breezy Badger'', 13 October 2005, but the work was not complete by that date. Instead the Xubuntu name was used for the ''xubuntu-desktop'' metapackage available through the [[Synaptic Package Manager]] which installed the Xfce desktop.

The first official Xubuntu release, led by Jani Monoses, appeared on 1 June 2006, as part of the Ubuntu 6.06 ''Dapper Drake'' line, which also included [[Kubuntu]] and [[Edubuntu]].

Cody A.W. Somerville developed a comprehensive strategy for the Xubuntu project named the ''Xubuntu Strategy Document''. In early 2009 the document was awaiting a second reading by the Ubuntu Community Council.&lt;ref name=&quot;Strategy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Specifications/Intrepid/StrategyDocument#Mission%20Statement|title =Xubuntu/Specifications/Intrepid/StrategyDocument|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = Somerville|first = Cody|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009 [[Mark Shuttleworth]] agreed that an official [[LXDE]] version of Ubuntu, [[Lubuntu]], would be developed. The LXDE desktop uses the [[Openbox]] window manager and, like Xubuntu, is intended to be a low-system-requirement, low-RAM environment for [[netbook]]s, mobile devices and older PCs and will compete with Xubuntu in that niche.&lt;ref name=&quot;DistroWatch11May09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090511#news|title = Another day, another Ubuntu derivative.|accessdate = 2009-05-21|last = Smart|first = Chris|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;LXDEBlog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blog.lxde.org/?p=208|title =Lubuntu? LXDE Meet up with Mark Shuttleworth in Berlin|accessdate = 2009-05-21|last = [[LXDE]]|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = February}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2009, Cody A.W. Somerville stepped down as the project leader and made a call for nominations to help find a successor.&lt;ref name=&quot;CallForNominations7Nov09&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/xubuntu-devel/2009-November/007180.html|title =Xubuntu Project Lead: Call for Nominations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lionel Le Folgoc was confirmed by the Xubuntu community as the new project leader on 10 January 2010 and requested the formation of an official Xubuntu council.&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuMeetingNotes10Jan10&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2010-01-10|title =Xubuntu/Meetings/Archive/Minutes/2010-01-10|accessdate = 2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of late March 2010, discussions regarding the future of Xubuntu's governance and the role a council might play in it were still ongoing.

===Xubuntu 6.06 LTS===
[[File:Xubuntu606.png|thumb|right|Xubuntu 6.06 LTS ''Dapper Drake'', the first official Xubuntu release]]
The first official stand-alone release of Xubuntu was version 6.06 Long Term Support (LTS), which was made available on 1 June 2006. 

It was introduced with the statement &quot;Xubuntu is the newest official Ubuntu derivative distribution, using the Xfce desktop environment and a selection of GTK2 applications. Its lightweight footprint is well suited for low-end hardware and thin clients. Xubuntu builds on the solid foundation of Ubuntu, with world-class hardware support and access to a vast repository of additional software.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes606&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/XubuntuDapperReleaseNotes|title = Xubuntu 6.06 (Dapper Drake)|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = August}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version used  [[Linux kernel]] 2.6.15.7 and Xfce 4.4 beta 1. Applications included the [[Thunar]] file manager, GDM desktop manager, [[Abiword]] word processor and [[Gnumeric]] spread sheet, [[Evince]] PDF document viewer, [[Xarchiver]] archive manager, [[Xfburn]] CD burner, [[Firefox|Firefox 1.5.0.3]] web browser, [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird 1.5.0.2]] email client and the [[GDebi]] package manager.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes606&quot; /&gt;

Caitlyn Martin reviewed Xubuntu 6.06 in June 2006. She singled out its &quot;bare bones approach&quot; to the applications included, indicating that she would rather add applications she wanted than clean out ones she didn't want. On her aging laptop Xubuntu 6.06 proved faster than [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core 5]]. She stated &quot;Under Fedora when I opened a couple of rather resource intensive applications, for example Open Office and Seamonkey, the system would begin to drag. While these apps still take a moment to get started on Xubuntu they are crisp and responsive and donât seem to slow anything else down. I never expected this sort of performance and that alone made Xubuntu an instant favorite of mine.&quot; She had praise for the Thunar file manager, as light and fast. She concluded &quot;Overall I am impressed and Xubuntu, for the moment anyway, is my favorite Linux distribution despite a few rough edges, probably largely due to the use of a beta desktop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin17Jun06&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/blog/2006/06/meet_the_newest_member_of_the.html|title = Meet The Newest Member of the Ubuntu Family: Introducing Xubuntu|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Martin|first = Caitlyn|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = June| work = O'Reilly Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 6.10===
[[File:Xubuntu-6.10.png|thumb|left|Xubuntu 6.10 ''Edgy Eft'']]
Xubuntu 6.10 was released on 26 October 2006. This version used Xfce 4.4 beta 2 and included [[Upstart]], the [[Firefox 2|Firefox 2.0]] web browser, the [[Gaim]] 2.0.0 beta 3.1 instant messaging client along with new versions of AbiWord and Gnumeric. The media player was [[gxine]] which replaced  [[Xfmedia]]. The previous ''xffm4'' file manger was replaced by Thunar. It introduced redesigned artwork for the bootup splash screen, the login window and the desktop theme.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelAnn6.10&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/news/6_10_released|title = Xubuntu 6.10 Released|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2006|month = October|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080828155000/http://www.xubuntu.org/news/6_10_released |archivedate = 24 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin13Dec06&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.oreillynet.com/linux/blog/2006/12/xubuntu_gets_edgy.html|title = Xubuntu Gets Edgy|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Martin|first = Caitlyn|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = December| work = O'Reilly Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The developers claimed that this version of Xubuntu could run on 64 MB of RAM, with 128 MB &quot;strongly recommended&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuGet610&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/get|title = Get Xubuntu|accessdate = 8 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]] |authorlink = |year = 2006|month = December|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061214191650/http://www.xubuntu.org/get |archivedate = 14 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewer Caitlyn Martin tested Xubuntu on a four year old Toshiba Satellite 1805-S204 laptop, with a 1 GHz Celeron processor and 512 MB of RAM in December 2006. She noted that Xubuntu ran faster than GNOME or KDE, which she described as &quot;sluggish&quot; and rated it as one of the two fastest distributions on her limited test hardware, placing with [[Vector Linux]]. She found the graphical installer to be be less than acceptable and the text-based installer better. She concluded, &quot;Once I had everything I like installed and configured Iâve found Xubuntu to be truly a pleasure to use. Itâs user friendly for the newcomer and highly customizable for the experienced user. The basic application set on the single CD is, as expected, limited but Iâd rather build up a distro with what I need and exclude what I donât need than try to remove cruft. Performance is the best Iâve seen in any current distro. Most of my complaints are nitpicking and in general Xubuntu Edgy Eft is as good as any Linux distribution Iâve used so far. Highly recommended.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Martin13Dec06&quot; /&gt;

===Xubuntu 7.04===
[[File:Xubuntu704.png|thumb|right|Xubuntu 7.04 ''Feisty Fawn'']]
Xubuntu 7.04 was released on 19 April 2007. This release was based on Xfce 4.4.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelAnn704&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/feisty_release|title = Xubuntu 7.04 Released|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = April|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080916201256/http://www.xubuntu.org/feisty_release |archivedate = 16 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DW704&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=04180|title = Distribution Release: Xubuntu 7.04|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Larabel of [[Phoronix]] carried out detailed benchmark testing of betas for [[Ubuntu 7.04]], [[Kubuntu|Kubuntu 7.04]] and Xubuntu 7.04 in February 2007 on two different computers, one with dual [[Intel]] Clovertown processors and the other with an [[AMD Sempron]]. After a series of gzip compression, LAME compilation, and LAME encoding tasks he concluded, &quot;in these tests with the dual Clovertown setup we found the results to be indistinguishable. However, with the AMD Sempron, Ubuntu 7.04 Feisty Fawn Herd 4 had outperformed both Kubuntu and the lighter-weight Xubuntu. Granted on a slower system the lightweight Xubuntu should have a greater performance advantage.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Phoronix23Feb07&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=article&amp;item=650&amp;num=1|title = Ubuntu, Kubuntu, &amp; Xubuntu Benchmarks|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Larabel|first = Michael|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = February | work = [[Phoronix]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one ''Review Linux'' look at Xubuntu 7.04 it was faulted for not including [[OpenOffice.org]]. The reviewer noted &quot;If you do decide to keep the default software, it will cover your basic needs. Xubuntu comes with light weight desktop in XFCE 4.4 and also less tasking programs. If you are thinking that OpenOffice will come pre-installed on your desktop, you will be greatly surprised as AbiWord and Gnumeric are your default processor and spreadsheet program.&quot; He indicated though that installing applications from the repositories was easy and made for simple customization of an installation.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReviewLinux22May07&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.reviewlinux.com/?m=show&amp;id=5849|title = Review: A Look at Xubuntu 7.04|accessdate = 8 June 2011|last = L|first = Mike|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = May| work = Review Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

18 October 2007 was the release date for Xubuntu 7.10. It was based upon Xfce, 4.4.1 and added updated translations along with a new theme, MurrinaStormCloud, using the Murrine Engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes710&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/news/gutsy/release|title = Xubuntu 7.10 Released|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = October|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080802225740/http://www.xubuntu.org/news/gutsy/release |archivedate = 23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DW710&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/?newsid=04541|title = Distribution Release: Xubuntu 7.10|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Application updates included [[Pidgin]] 2.2.0, (Gaim was renamed Pidgin) and [[GIMP]] 2.4. This Xubuntu version allowed the installation of Firefox extensions and plug-ins through the ''Add/Remove Software'' interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes710&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;DW710&quot; /&gt;

The developers claimed that this version of Xubuntu could run on 64 MB of RAM, with 128 MB &quot;strongly recommended&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuGet710&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/get|title = Get Xubuntu|accessdate = 8 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]] |authorlink = |year = 2007|month = December|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20071217182227/http://www.xubuntu.org/get#edgy |archivedate = 17 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of the release candidate for Xubuntu 7.10 that was installed on a [[Pentium 2]] 300 Celeron with 256 MB of RAM, equipped with an [[nVidia]] [[GeForce 4 Series|GeForce 4]] 64 MB video card, ''Review Linux'' noted that &quot;the system was very fast&quot;. &lt;ref name=&quot;ReviewLinux11Oct07&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.reviewlinux.com/?m=show&amp;id=7643|title = ReviewLinux.Com: Xubuntu 7.10 RC|accessdate = 8 June 2011|last = Webmaster|authorlink = |year = 2007|month = October| work = Review Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Review Linux'' positioned Xubuntu and its role, &quot;The main difference between Xubuntu and Ubuntu is the fact that Xubuntu is a little lighter on system requirements and it uses Xfce as it's ([[sic]]) desktop. Xubuntu is perfect for that old computer just lying around in your basement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReviewLinux11Oct07&quot; /&gt;

===Xubuntu 8.04 LTS===
[[File:Xubuntu 8.04 Korean.png|thumb|right|Xubuntu 8.04 ''Hardy Heron'']]
Xubuntu 8.04 Long Term Support (LTS) was made available on 24 April 2008. This version of Xubuntu used Xfce 4.4.2, Xorg 7.3 and Linux kernel 2.6.24. It introduced [[PolicyKit]] for permissions control, [[PulseAudio]] and a new printing manager. It also introduced [[Wubi]], that allowed Windows users to install Xubuntu as a program on Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes804&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/news/hardy/release|title = Xubuntu 8.04 Released|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = April|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20081028145320/http://www.xubuntu.org/news/hardy/release |archivedate = 28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications included were [[Firefox 3|Firefox 3 Beta 5]], Brasero CD/DVD burning application, Transmission BitTorrent client, Mousepad text editor, AbiWord word processor and Ristretto image viewer&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes804&quot; /&gt;

Reviewer Christopher Dawson of [[ZD Net]] installed Xubuntu 8.04 on a [[Dell Latitude|Dell Latitude C400]] with 512 MB of RAM, a 30GB hard drive and a 1GHz [[Pentium III|Pentium III-M]] processor. He noted it provided better performance than the [[Windows XP Pro]] it replaced. He concluded &quot;This is where Xubuntu really shines... What it will do is take some very moderate hardware and provide a solid, reliable, and relatively snappy machine for a user with productivity needs or who accesses terminal services.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dawson04May08&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.zdnet.com/blog/education/xubuntu-804-stellar-on-low-power-machines/1656|title = Xubuntu 8.04 stellar on low-power machines|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Dawson|first = Christopher |authorlink = |year = 2008|month = May| work = [[ZD Net]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 8.10===
[[File:Xubuntu810.png|thumb|left|Xubuntu 8.10 ''Intrepid Ibex'']]
Xubuntu 8.10 was released on 30 October 2008. This version of Xubuntu brought a new version of Abiword, version 2.6.4, the ''Listen Multimedia Player'' and introduced the ''Catfish'' desktop search application. It used Linux kernel 2.6.27, [[X.Org]] 7.4. There was an installation option of an encrypted private directory using ecryptfs-utils. The [[Totem (software)|Totem media player]] was included.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes810&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/news/intrepid/release|title = Xubuntu 8.10 released|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = [[Canonical Ltd]]|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darren Yates, the Australian IT journalist, was very positive about Xubuntu 8.10, particularly for [[netbook]]s, which were at their peak of popularity then, dismissing &quot;ubuntu itself is nothing flash&quot;. He said &quot;One of the disappointing things about the arrival of netbooks in Australia has been the decline of Linux in the face of an enslaught by Microsoft to push Windows XP Home Edition back into the market. Itâs sad because Xubuntu is the ideal Linux distro for these devices. While the latest Xubuntu 8.10 distro lacks drivers for WiFi wireless networking and in many cases also the built-in webcams, those drivers do exist and incorporating them inside Xubuntu would neither be difficult or take up much space.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Yates&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://darrenyates.com.au/2008/12/xubuntu-the-under-rated-linux-distro/534|title = Xubuntu â the under-rated Linux distro|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Yates|first = Darren|authorlink = |year = undated}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 9.04===
[[File:Xubuntjaunty.png|thumb|right|Xubuntu 9.04 ''Jaunty Jackalope'']]
Version 9.04 was released on 23 April 2009. The development team advertised this release as giving improved boot-up times, &quot;benefiting from the Ubuntu core developer team's improvements to boot-time code, the Xubuntu 9.04 desktop boots more quickly than ever. This means you can spend less time waiting, and more time being productive with your Xubuntu desktop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes904&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/JauntyJackalope/Final|title = Xubuntu 9.04 Announcement|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Campbell |first = Jim|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xubuntu 9.04 used Xfce 4.6, which included a new Xfce Settings Manager dialog, the new Xconf configuration system, a improved desktop menu and clock, new notifications and remote file system application [[Gigolo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes904&quot; /&gt;

This release also brought all new artwork and incorporated the Murrina Storm Cloud GTK theme and a new XFWM4 window manager theme. 9.04 also introduced new versions of many applications, including the AbiWord word processor, [[Brasero (software)|Brasero]] CD/DVD burner and [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] e-mail client. It used X.Org server 1.6. The default file system was [[ext3]], but [[ext4]] was an option at installation.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes904&quot; /&gt;

In testing Xubuntu 9.04 [[Distrowatch]] determined that Xubuntu used more than twice the system memory than [[Debian|Debian 5.0.1 Xfce]] and that while loading the desktop the memory usage was ten times higher. DistoWatch attributed this to Xubuntu's use of Ubuntu desktop environment services, including the graphical package manager and updater, network manager, power manager, proprietary driver manager. They provided a plan to strip it down and reduce its memory footprint.&lt;ref name=&quot;DW904&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090504#feature|title = Minimal Xubuntu 9.04|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = |first = |authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May| work = [[DistroWatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DistroWatch concluded &quot;Xubuntu is a great distribution, but its default selection of packages does not necessarily suit itself to low-memory systems.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DW904&quot; /&gt;

In reviewing Xubuntu in May 2009, [[Linux.com]] writer Rob Reilly said, &quot;The latest Xubuntu distribution has just about the right mix of speed and power&quot; and concluded &quot;for the new Linux user, Xubuntu is an easy to use version of Ubuntu that is fast, simple, and reliable. Experienced or &quot;get it done&quot; types will appreciate the minimalist approach, that can be beefed up to whatever degree that is needed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reilly15May09&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = https://www.linux.com/news/software/applications/9809-xubuntu-a-simple-approach-to-ubuntu|title = Xubuntu: A Simple Approach To Ubuntu|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = Reilly|first = Rob|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = May| work = Linux.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 9.10===
[[File:Xubuntu-karmic.png|thumb|left|Xubuntu 9.10 ''Karmic Koala'']]
29 October 2009 saw the release of Xubuntu 9.10, which utilized Xfce 4.6.1, Linux kernel 2.6.31 and by default the ext4 file system and [[GRUB 2]]. This release included the [[Exaile]] 0.3.0 music player, the Xfce4 power manager replaced the Gnome Power Manager and improved desktop notifications using ''notify-osd''. Upstart boot-up speed was improved.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes910&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/KarmicKoala/Final|title = Final|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last =  |first = Vincent|authorlink = |year = 2009|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The release promised &quot;faster application load times and reduced memory footprint for a number of your favorite Xfce4 applications thanks to improvements in library linking provided by ld's --as-needed flag.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes910&quot; /&gt;

Dedoimedo gave Xubuntu a negative review, saying &quot;When it comes to usability, Xubuntu has a lot to desire. While Xubuntu is based on Ubuntu, which is definitely one of the friendlier, simpler and more intuitive distros around, a core elements that has led to Ubuntu stardom, the integration of the Xfce desktop makes for a drastic change compared to stock edition. The usability is seriously marred, in several critical categories. And it gets worse. Losing functionality is one thing. Trying to restore it and ending with an unusable desktop is another.&quot; The review concluded &quot;Sadly, Xubuntu is a no go. It's not what it ought to be. What more, it does injustice to the Ubuntu family, which usually delivers useful solutions, mainly to new Linux users. There were horrendous, glaring problems with Xubuntu that kicked me back to Linux not so usable 2005. I was taken by surprise, totally not expecting that an ultra-modern distro would pull such dirty, antiquated tricks up its sleeve.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Dedoimedo.com910&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.dedoimedo.com/computers/xubuntu-9-10.html|title = Xubuntu 9.10 Review - Unremarkable|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Dedoimedo|authorlink = |year = undated| work = Dedoimedo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 10.04 LTS===
[[File:Xubuntu 10.04 desktop pl.png|thumb|right|Xubuntu 10.04 LTS ''Lucid Lynx'']]
Xubuntu 10.04 Long Term Support (LTS) was released on 29 April 2010. It moved to [[PulseAudio]] and replaced the [[Xsane]] [[Image scanner|scanner utilities]] with [[Simple Scan]]. It also incorporated the [[Ubuntu Software Center]], which had been introduced in [[Ubuntu 9.10]], to replace the old ''Add/Remove Software'' utility. The included spreadsheet application, Gnumeric was updated to version 1.10.1 and new games were introduced. Due to incompatibilities in the gnome-screensaver [[screensaver]] application it was replaced by xscreensaver. The default theme was an updated version of ''Albatross'', designed by the Shimmer Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes1004&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/LucidLynx/Final|title = What's new in Xubuntu|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Somerville |first = Cody|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of Xubuntu officially required a 700 MHz x86 processor, 128 MB of RAM, with 256 MB RAM &quot;strongly recommended&quot; and 3 GB of disk space.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch10May10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2010/05/10/xubuntu-linux-10-04/|title = Xubuntu Linux 10.04|accessdate = 14 June 2011|last = Lynch|first = Jim|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = May| work = Desktop Linux Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Xubuntu 10.04 beta 1 in April 2010, Joey Sneddon of [[OMG Ubuntu]], declared it &quot;borderline irrelevant&quot;. He noted that it provided few performance advantages over Ubuntu. In testing it against Ubuntu and Lubuntu on a 1 GB RAM, 2 Ghz Single core processor computer with a 128 MB video card, RAM usage with 3 tabs open in Firefox, 1 playing a HTML5 YouTube video was:

*Ubuntu Beta 1: 222 MB
*Xubuntu Beta 1: 215.8 MiB
*Lubuntu Beta 1: 137 MB

Sneddon concluded from this testing, &quot;as you can see Xubuntu, as we've mentioned previously, shows very little lean-ness compared to Ubuntu proper, which begs the question 'why would you use it over Ubuntu?'. Xubuntu, whilst of interest to those who prefer the XFCE environment, remains an unremarkable spin from the Ubuntu canon that, for most users, is largely irrelevant.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;OMG28Mar10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2010/03/xubuntu-10-04-beta-1-remains-borderline-irrelevant/|title = Xubuntu 10.04 Beta 1 remains borderline irrelevant|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Sneddon|first = Joey|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = March| work = [[OMG!

Jim Lynch of ''Desktop Linux Reviews'' praised Xubuntu 10.04's fast boot time and its incorporation of the [[Ubuntu Software Center]], but criticized the lack of inclusion of [[Ubuntu One]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch10May10&quot; /&gt;

===Xubuntu 10.10===
[[File:Xubuntu 10.10 Screenshot.png|thumb|left|Xubuntu 10.10 ''Maverick Meerkat'']]
Xubuntu 10.10 was released on 10 October 2010. It included Parole, the Xfce4 media player, XFBurn CD/DVD writer in place of Brasero and Xfce4-taskmanager replaced Gnome-Task-Manager. These changes were all to lighten the release's memory footprint. AbiWord was updated to version 2.8.6  and Gnumeric to 1.10.8. This release also introduced the ''Bluebird'' theme, from the Shimmer Team.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes1010&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/MaverickMeerkat/Final|title = What's new in Xubuntu|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Kravetz |first = Charlie|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version of Xubuntu required 192 MB of RAM to run the standard live CD or to install it. The alternate installation CD required 64 MB of RAM to install Xubuntu. Either CD required 2.0 GB of free hard disk space. Once installed, Xubuntu 10.10 could run with as little as 128 MB of RAM, but the developers strongly recommended a minimum of 256 MB of RAM.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch19Oct10&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://eyeonlinux.com/2010/10/19/quick-look-xubuntu-10-10/|title = Quick Look: Xubuntu 10.10|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Lynch|first = Jim|authorlink = |year = 2010|month = October| work = Eye On Linux}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing Xubuntu 10.10 in October 2010, just after it was released, Jim Lynch of ''Eye On Linux'' said, &quot;I had no problems using Xubuntu 10.10. My system was very stable; I didnât notice any application crashes or system burps. Xubuntu 10.10 is also very fast; applications opened and close very quickly. There was no noticeable system lag or sluggishness. The new theme Bluebird is attractive without being garish; it fits in well with Xubuntuâs minimalist mission.&quot;

Christopher Tozzi, writing about Xubuntu 10.10 beta in August 2010, noted that the distribution was shedding its Gnome dependencies and adopting lighter weight alternatives. He noted &quot;itâs encouraging to see more uniqueness in the distribution, especially given the uncertain future of the Gnome-Ubuntu relationship as the release of Gnome 3.0 approaches.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tozzi&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.thevarguy.com/2010/08/16/xubuntu-10-10-becoming-more-unique/|title = Xubuntu 10.10: Becoming More Unique|accessdate = 7 June 2011|last = Tozzi|first = Chistopher |authorlink = |year = 2010|month = August| work = Nine Lives Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 11.04===
[[File:Xubuntu-natty.png||thumb|right|Xubuntu 11.04 ''Natty Narwhal'']]
Xubuntu 11.04 was released on 28 April 2011. This version was based upon Xfce 4.8 and introduced editable menus using any menu editor that meets the freedesktop.org standards. This version also introduced a new Elementary Xubuntu icon theme, the [[Droid (font)|Droid font]] by default and an updated installation slide show.&lt;ref name=&quot;RelNotes1104&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/NattyNarwhal/ReleaseNotes#Xubuntu|title = ReleaseNotes|accessdate = 8 June 2011|last = Pedretti|first = Fabio|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Ubuntu 11.04]] introduced the new default [[Unity (user interface)|Unity interface]], Xubuntu did not adopt Unity and instead retained its existing Xfce interface. Although the developers have decided to retain a minimalist interface, Xubuntu 11.04 has a new dock-like application launcher to achieve a more modern look.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch01Jun11&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = http://desktoplinuxreviews.com/2011/06/01/xubuntu-11-04/6/|title = Xubuntu 11.04|accessdate = 6 June 2011|last = Lynch|first = Jim|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = June}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xubuntu 11.04 could be installed with one of 2 CDs. The Xubuntu 11.04 standard CD requires 4.4 GB of hard disk space and 256 MB of RAM to install, while the alternate CD, which uses a text-based installer, requires 64 MB of RAM and 2 GB of disk space for installation and provides additional options. Once installed, Xubuntu 11.04 can run with 256 MB of RAM, but 512 MB is &quot;strongly recommended&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuRequire&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;UbuntuRequire&quot; /&gt;

In reviewing Xubuntu 11.04, Jim Lynch of ''Desktop Linux Reviews'' faulted the release for its lack of [[LibreOffice]], its dull default wallpaper and the default automatic hiding of the bottom panel. In praising the release he said &quot;Xubuntu 11.04 is a good choice for minimalists who prefer a desktop environment not bogged down with pointless eye-candy. It should work well on older or slower hardware. Itâs also a good option for those who dislike Unity and want a different desktop environment. Xfce is simple, fast and doesnât get in your way when you are trying to quickly launch an application or otherwise find something. And those who decide to use Xubuntu still remain in the Ubuntu family without the headache of dealing with Unity. So if youâre a Unity resister, you should definitely check out Xubuntu 11.04.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lynch01Jun11&quot; /&gt;

Joe Brockmeier of ''Linux.com'' in reviewing Xubuntu 11.04, praised the inclusion of AbiWord and Gnumeric over LibreOffice, as well as the Catfish file search utility. He added, &quot;Though I've usually used the mainline Ubuntu release when I use Ubuntu, I have to say that I really like the latest iteration of Xubuntu. It does a great job of showcasing Xfce while providing a unique desktop that gives all the pluses of Ubuntu while still being a bit more like a traditional Linux desktop.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Brockmeier03May11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.linux.com/learn/tutorials/441252:xubuntu-1104-solid-sleek-and-speedy|title = Xubuntu 11.04: Solid, Sleek, and Speedy|accessdate = 14 June 2011|last = Brockmeier|first = Joe|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = May| work = Linux.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Xubuntu 11.10===
[[File:Xubuntu 11.10 English.png|thumb|left|Xubuntu 11.10 ''Oneiric Ocelot'']]
Xubuntu 11.10 was released on 13 October 2011, the same day that [[Ubuntu 11.10]] was released.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xubuntu1110relnotes&quot;&gt; {{Cite web|url = https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Xubuntu/OneiricOcelot/Final|title = Information about Xbuntu 11.10|accessdate = 14 October 2011|last = Xubuntu|authorlink = |year = 2011|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this release [[gThumb]] became the new image viewer/organizer, [[Leafpad]] replaced [[Xfce#Mousepad|Mousepad]] as the default text editor and [[LightDM]] was introduced as the log-in manager. The release also incorporated [[pastebinit]] for cut and paste actions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Xubuntu1110relnotes&quot; /&gt;

In reviewing Xubuntu 11.10 on the Acer eM350 [[netbook]], Michael Reed of [[Linux Journal]] noted the extensive hardware support out of the box, attractive theme and good performance on 1 GB of RAM. He did remark on the inferior [[Adobe Flash]] performance compared to the Windows version of Flash, particularly in full screen mode, something common to all Linux Flash installations as well as the lack of native support for [[Samba (software)|Samba networking]], although he was quickly able to install this. Reed concluded &quot;my overall assessment was that Xubuntu 11.10 was a better fit than Windows XP on this netbook. Being fair, one has to remember that XP is now ten years old. Xfce is going to get better and better, and it's already very comprehensive. There is a growing contingent of users for whom the direction that KDE4 and Gnome 3 have taken doesn't ring true, and increasingly, Xfce is going to be the first choice for them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reed31Oct11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://www.linuxjournal.com/content/xubuntu-1110-and-my-netbook|title = Xubuntu 11.10 and my Netbook|accessdate = 2 November 2011|last = Reed|first = Michael|date = 31 October 2011| work = [[Linux Journal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reviewing 11.10, Brian Masinick of ''IT Toolbox'' praised its low RAM usage and said the &quot;Xubuntu 11.10 release is a fresh relief for those who simply want a nice, functional system. Xubuntu 11.10 delivers, and excels in providing a functional, no frills or surprises, responsive, and usable desktop system.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Masinick14Oct11&quot;&gt; {{Cite news|url = http://it.toolbox.com/blogs/brians-blog/very-favorable-first-impressions-of-xubuntu-1110-48892|title = Very favorable first impressions of Xubuntu 11.10|accessdate = 9 November 2011|last = Masinick|first = Brian|date = 14 October 2011| work = IT Toolbox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
The Xubuntu CD includes application software for the average user including:&lt;ref name=&quot;DistroWatch&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=xubuntu|title =Xubuntu|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[DistroWatch]]|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;XubuntuTour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.xubuntu.org/tour|title = Glossary|accessdate = 2009-02-10|last = [[Canonical Ltd.]]|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xubuntu includes the [[Ubuntu Software Center]] which allows users to download additional applications from the Ubuntu repositories.

==Releases==
Xubuntu versions are released twice a year, coinciding with Ubuntu releases. Xubuntu uses the same version numbers and code names as Ubuntu, using the year and month of the release as the [[Software versioning|version number]]. The first Xubuntu release, for example, was 6.06, indicating June 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;warty_release&quot;&gt;{{cite mailing list |url=https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-announce/2004-October/000003.html |title=Ubuntu 4.10 announcement |date=2004-10-20 |accessdate=2008-08-19 |mailinglist=ubuntu-announce |last=Shuttleworth |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Shuttleworth }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xubuntu releases are also given [[code name]]s, using an adjective and an animal with the same first letter e.g.: &quot;Dapper Drake&quot; and &quot;Intrepid [[Ibex]]&quot;. These are the same as the respective [[Ubuntu (operating system)#Releases|Ubuntu code names]]. Xubuntu code names are in alphabetical order, allowing a quick determination of which release is newer, although there were no releases with the letters &quot;A&quot; or &quot;C&quot;. Commonly, Xubuntu releases are referred to by developers and users by only the adjective portion of the code name, for example ''Intrepid Ibex'' is often called just ''Intrepid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.ubuntu.com/DevelopmentCodeNames |title=DevelopmentCodeNames - Ubuntu Wiki |publisher=Wiki.ubuntu.com |date= |accessdate=2008-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
