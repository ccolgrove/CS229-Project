The junta meets regularly, as well as in times of a national emergency, with the President of Egypt serving as its chairman. During the course of the 2011 revolution, the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces met first on February 9, 2011 under the chairmanship of the former Egyptian President, [[Hosni Mubarak]].

The Council met for the first time without the chairmanship of the President on February 10, and issued their first press statement, which signaled that the council was about to assume power which they did the next day following Mubarak's relinquishing of power to the military. The [[military junta]] is headed by the [[Field Marshal]] [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]] who served as the Minister of Defense under Mubarak, and includes the service heads and other senior commanders of the [[Egyptian Armed Forces]], namely Air Marshal [[Reda Mahmoud Hafez Mohamed]], Air Force commander,  Lt. Gen. [[Sami Hafez Anan]], Armed Forces Chief of Staff, Lt. Gen. [[Abd El Aziz Seif-Eldeen]], Commander of Air Defense, and Vice Admiral [[Mohab Mamish]], Navy Commander in Chief.&lt;ref name=nyt0210&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2011/02/10/world/middleeast/20110210-egypt-supreme-council.html?ref=middleeast| work=The New York Times| title=Egypt's Supreme Council of the Armed Forces| date=February 10, 2011 |accessdate=February 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Actions==
{{main|Timeline of the 2011 Egyptian revolution under Supreme Council of the Armed Forces}}
===Prior to Mubarak's Resignation===
The Supreme Council released its First statement on Thursday, February 10, 2011 stating that the council &quot;in affirmation and support for the legitimate demands of the people&quot; is in &quot;continuous session  to consider what procedures and measures that may be taken to protect the nation&quot;. It was noted that then-president [[Hosni Mubarak]] was not present in the meeting as the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, however the meeting was headed by [[Mohamed Hussein Tantawi|Defense Minister Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi]].

===Assuming power===
The Supreme Council of the Armed Forces in his third statement issued on the evening of Friday, February 11, 2011 Shortly after the announcement of Mubarak's resignation, that the Council is not a substitute for the legitimacy that satisfies the people. The Council addressed &quot;with all the greetings and cherished for the lives of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives to sacrifice for freedom and security of their country, &quot;and led a spokesman for the Council to salute the martyrs, an action which received wide appraise from the people. The Council also thanked President Hosni Mubarak &quot;for his work in the process of national war and in peace and on the national position in preference to the higher interest of the homeland&quot; in the same statement. In the following day, February 12, the Council released his fourth statement, which he pledged to oversee the transition to ensure the transfer of power to a civilian government elected by the people.

===Transition period and political reforms===
{{Expand section|date=April 2011}}
In its statement the Council indicated that it intends to suspend emergency laws that had been in effect for three decades, and move towards free and fair presidential elections, and provide for a safe transition to a free democratic order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/11/world/middleeast/11egypt-military-statement.html| work=The New York Times |title=Statement From the Supreme Council of the Egyptian Armed Forces. |date=February 11, 2011, |accessdate=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[:Egyptian_Revolution_of_2011#13_February|One of their first actions]] were to dissolve the [[Parliament of Egypt]], [[List of political leaders who suspended the constitution|suspend]] the [[Constitution of Egypt]], and an announcement of free, open [[Egyptian presidential election, 2011|presidential]] and [[Egyptian parliamentary election, 2011|parliamentary]] elections before the year's end and within six months.

The Council has also declared that Egypt &quot;is committed to all regional and international obligations and treaties&quot;. This has been widely interpreted as relating to the [[EgyptâIsrael Peace Treaty]], and has been welcomed by [[Israel]]i [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Story.aspx?sid=53702|title= Army Council: Egypt is committed to all treaties|author= |date= 13 February 2011|publisher= Egypt State Information Service |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-world/israel-welcomes-peace-pledge-20110213-1arnk.html|title= Israel welcomes peace pledge|author= |date= 13 February 2011|author= Agence France-Presse|work= The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 7, 2011, Field Marshal Tantawi swore in 15 new governors, 11 of whom were new to the post. Some critics complained that the new governors were appointed rather than elected, that many of them were military figures and/or members of the old regime and none of them were young, women, or Copts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memri.org/report/en/print5568.htm Uproar in Egypt Over Government Appointment of Regional Governors from Armed Forces, Old Regime] 15 August 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Since taking power the council has overseen the trial of 7000 people in closed military trials, including bloggers, journalists and protesters. In May 2011, one of the members of the council, General Mamdouh Shahin stated that the under the new constitution Egypt's military should be given `some kind of insurance ... so that it is not under the whim of a president.`&lt;ref name=Martini&gt;''Foreign Affairs magazine'', September/October 2011, &quot;Commanding Democracy in Egypt&quot;, Jeff Martini and Julie Taylor, p.127-137&lt;/ref&gt;

The SCAF was heavily criticized following violent confrontations between armed soldiers at the headquarters of the state television and radio services (known as the [[Maspero television building|Maspiro building]]). A group of protestors, mostly [[Coptic Christians]], marched to the Maspiro building in downtown Cairo to protest against the burning of a church in Upper Egypt. A confrontation between the protestors and the army turned violent, resulting in the killing of over 20 protestors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/world/middle-east/bloodshed-at-christian-protest-leaves-stunned-egyptians-torn-over-army-sectarian-divisions/2011/10/15/gIQAwkzXmL_story.html Bloodshed at Christian protest leaves stunned Egyptians torn over army, sectarian divisions] AP. 15 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; State TV broadcast messages of Copts attacking the army and called on Egyptians to join the army.&lt;ref&gt;El-Gundy, Zeinab.

[http://pulitzercenter.org/reporting/egypt-cairo-coptic-christian-attack-church-violence Violence and Bloodshed in Egypt: An Eyewitness Account] Pulitzer Center. 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The SCAF initially denied the army was responsible for any violence and further claimed that three soldiers had been killed by protestors, claiming that the soldiers were not carrying any live ammunition.&lt;ref name=merip&gt;Tadros, Mariz [http://www.merip.org/mero/mero101311 Egypt's Bloody Sunday] MERIP. 13 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Later, video evidence was broadcast showing army vehicles hitting groups of protestors.&lt;ref name=merip /&gt; An editorial in ''[[The Washington Post]]'' blasted the SCAF for what it called a &quot;shameful&quot; response to the violence directed against the Coptic protestors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/egypts-delaying-tactic/2011/10/10/gIQAMlkYaL_story.html Egyptâs delaying tactic] Washington Post. 10 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the turbulence of the transitional period in Egypt, polls have shown that the SCAF has enjoyed wide legitimacy from the Egyptian people and general confidence in their ability to provide free elections. A poll in October 2011 showed that 91.7% of Egyptians have confidence in the SCAF to provide the conditions for free elections. The SCAF at that time had a general approval rating of 40.6%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raman|first=Suby|title=Poll- Do the Egyptians really want to overthrow the military government?|url=http://subyraman.com/poll-do-egyptians-really-want-to-overthrow-the-military-government/|work=Tabeer}}&lt;/ref&gt;
