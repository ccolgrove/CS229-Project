'''USS ''Enterprise'' (CVN-65)''', formerly CVA(N)-65, is the world's first nuclear-powered [[aircraft carrier]] and the eighth US naval vessel to bear [[USS Enterprise|the name]]. Like [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|her predecessor]] of World War II fame, she is nicknamed the &quot;''Big E''&quot;. At {{convert|1123|ft|m|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name=&quot;length&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;length2&quot;/&gt; she is the longest [[naval vessel]] in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of longest ships in the world#Military ships&quot;List of longest naval vessels]]&lt;/ref&gt; Her {{convert|93284|LT|MT|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name=&quot;NVR&quot;/&gt; displacement ranks her as the 11th-heaviest [[supercarrier]], after the 10 carriers of the [[Nimitz class aircraft carrier|''Nimitz'' class]].

The only ship of her class, ''Enterprise'' is the second-oldest vessel in commission in the [[United States Navy]], after the wooden-[[hull (watercraft)|hull]]ed, three-[[Mast (sailing)|masted]] [[frigate]] {{USS|Constitution}}. She was originally scheduled for [[Ship decommissioning|decommissioning]] in 2014 or 2015, depending on the life of her reactors and completion of her replacement, {{USS|Gerald R. Ford}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;decom&quot;&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/navycvn21.htm  Navy CVN-21 Aircraft Carrier Program: Background and Issues for Congress]. history.navy.mil Retrieved 8 December 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; But the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010 slated the ship's retirement for 2013, when she will have served for 51 consecutive years, the most of any U.S. aircraft carrier.&lt;ref name=&quot;retire2&quot;&gt;[http://www.defpro.com/news/details/10424/ &quot;House and Senate Armed Services Committees agree FY 2010 Navy shipbuilding authorization&quot;]. defpro.com, October 10, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2010, ''Enterprise'''s home port is at [[Naval Station Norfolk, Virginia]].  She has one more deployment before her decommissioning.&lt;ref name=&quot;october2009&quot;&gt;[http://www.dailypress.com/business/dp-biz_enterprise_1022oct22,0,13991.story &quot;USS Enterprise repair bill now $605 million&quot;]. dailypress.com, 22 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterprise'' was meant to be the first of a class of six, but construction costs ballooned and the remaining vessels were never laid down.

Because of the huge cost of her construction, ''Enterprise'' was launched and commissioned without the planned [[RIM-2 Terrier|Terrier]] missile launchers. These were never installed and the ship's self-defense suite instead consisted of three shorter-range [[RIM-7 Sea Sparrow]], Basic Point Defense Missile System (BPDMS) launchers.&lt;ref&gt;''Jane's American fighting ships of the 20th century'' New York, N.Y. : Mallard Press, 1991. p 89 ISBN 0-7924-5626-2&lt;/ref&gt; Later upgrades added two NATO Sea Sparrow (NSSM) and three Mk 15 [[Phalanx CIWS]] gun mounts.&lt;ref&gt;Tony Cullen, Tony.''Encyclopedia Of World Sea Power'', p. 68. ISBN 0-517-65342-7.&lt;/ref&gt; One CIWS mount was later removed and two 21-cell [[RIM-116 Rolling Airframe Missile]] launchers were added.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dodmedia.osd.mil/JCCC/Still/2006/Navy/061031-N-0119G-115.JPEG 061031-N-0119G-115 Stbd side, RAM aft], [http://www.dodmedia.osd.mil/Assets/Still/2007/Navy/DN-SD-07-21656.JPEG DN-SD-07-21656 Forward Port side, RAM launcher]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterprise'' is also the only aircraft carrier to house more than two nuclear reactors.&lt;ref name=&quot;length&quot;/&gt;&quot;This was due to the ready availability of a field-proven production design developed for nuclear submarines.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Her eight-reactor propulsion design also fit well with the [[Forrestal class aircraft carrier|supercarrier]] hull designs of the time,{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} with each [[A2W reactor]] taking the place of one of the conventional boilers in earlier constructions. She is the only carrier with four rudders, two more than other classes, and features a more [[cruiser]]-like hull.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nascar.com/2007/news/opinion/06/20/bweber.cedwards.uss.enterprise/index.html |title= The First and the Finest: Aboard the USS Enterprise |accessdate= 2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Enterprise'' also had a [[phased array]] radar system designed to be better at tracking multiple airborne targets than conventional rotating antenna radars. These early phased arrays, which were replaced around 1980, were responsible for the distinctive square-looking island.&lt;ref name=&quot;janes2000-p798&quot;&gt;{{cite book | title = Jane's Fighting Ships 2000&amp;ndash;2001 | editor = Capt Richard Sharpe OBE RN | year = 2000 |publisher = Jane's Information Group Limited | location = Coulsdon, Surrey, UK | page = 798 | isbn = 0 7106 2018 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Commissioning and trials===
In 1958, ''Enterprise''{{'}}s keel was laid at [[Northrop Grumman Shipbuilding Newport News|Newport News Shipbuilding]] and Drydock Company. On 24 September 1960, the ship was [[ship naming and launching|launched]], sponsored by Mrs. [[William B. Franke|W. B. Franke]], wife of the former [[United States Secretary of the Navy|Secretary of the Navy]]. On 25 November 1961, ''Enterprise'' was [[ship commissioning|commissioned]], with Captain [[Vincent P. De Poix]], formerly of Fighting Squadron 6 on [[USS Enterprise (CV-6)|her predecessor]],&lt;ref&gt;Battle 360, &quot;The Empire's Last Stand.&quot; Dir. Tony Long. History Channel. May 2, 2008 (2008-05-02)&lt;/ref&gt; in command. On 12 January 1962, the ship made her maiden voyage conducting a three-month shakedown cruise and a lengthy series of tests and training exercises designed to determine the full capabilities of the [[Nuclear Power|nuclear-powered]] [[aircraft carrier]].

===1960s===
On 20 February 1962, ''Enterprise'' was a tracking and measuring station for the flight of [[Mercury Atlas 6|''Friendship 7'']], the [[Project Mercury]] space capsule in which [[John H. Glenn, Jr.|Lieutenant Colonel John H. Glenn, Jr.]] made the first American orbital spaceflight. In August, the carrier joined the [[United States Sixth Fleet|6th Fleet]] in the Mediterranean sea, returning to [[Norfolk, Virginia]] in October.

====1962 Cuban Missile Crisis====
{{Main|Cuban Missile Crisis}}

In October, 1962, ''Enterprise'' was dispatched to her first international crisis. Following revelations that the Soviet Union was constructing [[nuclear missile]] launch sites on [[Cuba]], President [[John F. Kennedy]] began to prepare for action, moving several military units to Florida and adjacent waters.  On 24 October, President Kennedy ordered a naval and air &quot;quarantine&quot; (blockade) on shipment of offensive military equipment to Cuba, and demanded the [[Soviets]] dismantle the missile sites there. ''Enterprise'', supported by the carriers {{USS|Independence|CV-62|2}}, {{USS|Essex|CV-9|2}}, and {{USS|Randolph|CV-15|2}} and backed by shore-based aircraft, participated in the blockade as part of the [[United States Second Fleet|2nd Fleet]].  By 28 October, the crisis was averted.

====Second/third deployments====

''Enterprise'' crew members are spelling out [[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] [[mass-energy equivalence]] formula ''E''=''mc''Â² on the flight deck.  Note the distinctive [[phased array]] radars in the superstructures of ''Enterprise'' and ''Long Beach''.]]

On 19 December 1962, a [[E-2 Hawkeye]] was [[aircraft catapult]]ed off ''Enterprise'' in the first shipboard test of a nose-wheel launch bar designed to replace the catapult bridle.  Minutes later, a second launch with a launch bar was made by an [[A-6 Intruder|A-6A]], demonstrating one of the primary design goals of reducing launch intervals.

In 1963&amp;ndash;1964, ''Enterprise'' made her second and third [[military deployment|deployment]] to the Mediterranean, respectively. Also during the third Mediterranean deployment, the carrier was part of [[Operation Sea Orbit]], the world's first nuclear-powered task force with the [[cruiser]]s {{USS|Long Beach|CGN-9|2}} and {{USS|Bainbridge|CGN-25|2}}, which joined to sail around the world. On 25 February 1964, a crewman of the Finnish merchant ship {{SS|Verna Paulin||2}} was injured in a fall whilst the ship was in the vicinity of [[Souda Bay]], Greece. ''Enterprise'' answered her call for assistance. A surgeon was transferred to ''Verna Paulin'' by helicopter.&lt;ref name=Vernapaulin&gt;{{cite DANFS|title=Enterprise|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e4/enterprise-viiia.htm|accessdate=5 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1964, ''Enterprise'' returned to Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company for her first [[refueling and overhaul]].

====Southeast Asia deployments====
In November 1965, the ''Big E'' was transferred to the Pacific [[Seventh Fleet]], home-porting at [[NAS Alameda]] California. The following month, on 2 December, she became the first nuclear-powered ship to engage in combat when she launched aircraft against the [[Viet Cong]] near [[Bien Hoa]]. ''Enterprise'' launched 125 [[sortie]]s on the first day, unleashing {{convert|167|ST|t|abbr=on}} of bombs and rockets on the enemy's supply lines. On 3 December, she set a record of 165 strike sorties in a single day.

[[File:USS Enterprise (CVN-65) burning, stern view.jpg|thumb|left|View of ''Enterprise''{{'}}s stern during the fire of 1969]]

In January 1968, the capture of {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|2}} by a [[North Korea]]n patrol boat led to a diplomatic crisis. ''Enterprise'' was ordered to operate near [[South Korea]]n waters for almost a month.

During the morning of 14 January 1969, while being escorted by the destroyers Benjamin Stoddert (DDG22) and Rogers (DD876), a [[MK-32 Zuni]] rocket loaded on a parked [[F-4 Phantom]] exploded due to ordnance [[Cooking off|cook off]] after being overheated by an aircraft start unit mounted to a tow tractor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=52888 History.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The explosion set off fires and additional explosions across the [[flight deck]]. The fires were brought under control relatively quickly (when compared with previous carrier flight deck fires), but 27 lives were lost and an additional 314 people were injured. The fire destroyed 15 aircraft, and the resulting damage forced ''Enterprise'' to put in for repairs at Pearl Harbor Naval Shipyard, primarily to repair the flight deck's armored plating.&lt;ref&gt;This [[YouTube]] [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UKCT0vOnF-Q&amp;mode=related&amp;search= film extract] shows some of the events. The film can also be seen on [http://www.militaryvideo.com/store/store.cfm?titleID=EnterpriseF&amp;do=detail militaryvideo.com].&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 3rd week of April 1969, repairs to the ship were completed at [[Pearl Harbor, Hawaii]] and the ship proceeded on her ''scheduled'' 'WestPac' deployment to Vietnam and the Tonkin Gulf. However, these destinations would be delayed by events unfolding in the East Japan Sea.

[[File:Aircraft burning on USS Enterprise (CVN-65).jpg|thumb|left|Sailors aboard ''Enterprise'' battle a massive ordnance fire triggered by a Zuni rocket. January 14, 1969]]

On 14 April 1969, tensions with North Korea flared up again as a [[North Korea]]n aircraft [[EC-121 shootdown incident|shot down]] an unarmed [[EC-121 Warning Star]] which was on a routine reconnaissance patrol over the East Japan Sea from its base at [[Atsugi, Japan]]. The entire 31-man crew was killed. The U.S. responded by activating Task Force 71 (TF 71) to protect such flights over those [[international waters]] in the future. Initially, the Task Force was to comprise ''Enterprise'', {{USS|Ticonderoga|CV-14|2}}, {{USS|Ranger|CV-61|2}} and {{USS|Hornet|CV-12|2}}, with a screen of cruisers and destroyers, however the ''Enterprise'' did not arrive on station with TF 71 until late April after completion of repairs. The ships for TF 71 were drawn mostly from Southeast Asia duty. This deployment became one of the largest shows of force in the area since the Korean War.

In all, ''Enterprise'' made six combat deployments to Southeast Asia from 1965 to 1975.

===1970s===
In 1969&amp;ndash;1970, ''Enterprise'' returned to Newport News Shipbuilding and went through an overhaul and her second refitting. In January 1971, she completed sea trials with her newly designed nuclear reactor cores which contained enough energy for 10 years. ''Enterprise'' then set sail for Vietnam, again to provide air support for American and South Vietnamese units.

====Southeast Asia====
In [[Vietnam]], ''Enterprise'', {{USS|Oriskany|CV-34|2}} and {{USS|Midway|CV-41|2}} launched a total of 2,001 strike sorties by 30 July 1971. Strike operations in July were disrupted when the carriers on station evaded three [[typhoon]]s: Harriet, Kim and Jean. A slight increase in [[South Vietnam]] strike sorties occurred during the month. These were mainly visual strikes against enemy troop positions and in support of U.S. [[helicopter]] operations. From AugustâNovember 1971, ''Enterprise'' was in operations on [[Yankee Station]].

In December 1971 during the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]], ''Enterprise'' was deployed to the [[Bay of Bengal]] as a show of strength against India's naval blockade by [[INS Vikrant|INS ''Vikrant'']]. A [[Soviet Navy]] submarine was also trailing the US task force. A confrontation was averted when the Americans moved towards South East Asia, away from the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/NAVY/History/1971War/Games.html Cold war games]&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1972, the U.S. ended tactical air sorties into North Vietnam above the 20th parallel and brought [[Operation Linebacker|Linebacker I]] operations to a close, a goodwill gesture designed to promote peace negotiations being held in Paris. ''Enterprise'' and the other carriers had flown a total of 23,652 tactical air attack sorties into North Vietnam from MayâOctober and U.S. tactical air sorties during Linebacker I operations helped to stem the flow of supplies into North Vietnam, thereby limiting the operating capabilities of the North Vietnamese Army.

From October to December, ''Enterprise'' alternated with other carriers on [[Yankee Station]] during the bombing halt and remained on station. As a result of the bombing halt above the 20th parallel in North Vietnam, no [[MiG]] kills or U.S. aircraft losses were recorded during this time.

On 18 December 1972, the U.S. resumed bombing campaigns above the 20th parallel under the name [[Operation Linebacker II|Linebacker II]]. During Linebacker II operations, ''Enterprise'' and other carriers on station reseeded the mine fields in [[Haiphong]] harbor and conducted concentrated strikes against surface-to-air missile and anti-aircraft artillery sites, enemy army barracks, petroleum storage areas, Haiphong naval and shipyard areas, and railroad and truck stations. Navy tactical air attack sorties under Linebacker II were centered in the coastal areas around Hanoi and Haiphong. There were 705 Navy sorties in this area during Linebacker II. Between 18 December and 22 December the Navy conducted 119 Linebacker II strikes in North Vietnam, with the main limiting factor on airstrikes being bad weather.

In December 1972, the North Vietnamese returned to the peace table and Linebacker II ended. In January 1973, the Vietnam cease fire was announced and American carriers ceased all combat sorties into North and South Vietnam.

From 28 January 1973, aircraft from ''Enterprise'' and ''[[USS Ranger (CV-61)|Ranger]]'' flew 81 combat sorties against lines-of-communication targets in [[Laos]]. The corridor for overflights was between [[Huáº¿]] and [[Da Nang]] in [[South Vietnam]]. These combat support sorties were flown in support of the Laotian government which had requested this assistance. Laos had no relationship with the cease-fire in Vietnam.

====Post-Vietnam====
After the cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973, ''Enterprise'' proceeded to the [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility|Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]], [[Bremerton, Washington]], where the carrier was altered and refitted to support the Navy's newest fighter aircraft â the [[F-14 Tomcat]]. Two of four [[jet blast deflector]]s were enlarged to accommodate the Tomcat. The No. 4 propulsion shaft was replaced; it had been bent when its screw became fouled in a discarded [[arresting gear]] cable.

[[File:Enterprise Tomcat.JPG|thumb|upright=1.25|In the 1970s, ''Enterprise'' was refitted to handle [[F-14 Tomcat]]s, which operated from the ship from 1974 to 2001.]]

On 18 March 1974, the first operational Tomcats of [[VF-1]] Wolfpack and [[VF-2]] Bounty Hunters made their maiden takeoffs and landings from the carrier. In September 1974, ''Enterprise'' became the first carrier to deploy with the new fighter plane when she made her seventh western Pacific (WESTPAC) deployment.

In February 1975, [[Typhoon|Typhoon Gervaise]] struck the island nation of [[Mauritius]], and ''Enterprise'' was ordered to provide disaster relief.  Arriving at [[Port Louis]], carrier personnel spent more than 10,000 [[man-hour]]s rendering such assistance as restoring water, power and telephone systems, clearing roads and debris, and providing helicopter, medical, food and drinkable water support to the stricken area.

====Operation Frequent Wind====
In April 1975, ''Enterprise'', ''Midway'', {{USS|Coral Sea|CV-43|2}}, {{USS|Hancock|CV-19|2}}, and {{USS|Okinawa|LPH-3|2}} were deployed to waters off Vietnam for possible evacuation contingencies as [[North Vietnam]], in violation of the [[Paris Peace Accords]], launched a conventional invasion of [[South Vietnam]]. On 29 April, [[Operation Frequent Wind]] was carried out by US Navy and Marine Corps helicopters from the [[United States Seventh Fleet|7th Fleet]]. The Operation involved the evacuation of American citizens and &quot;at-risk' Vietnamese from [[Saigon]], the capital of South Vietnam under heavy attack from the invading forces of North Vietnam.

President [[Gerald Ford]] ordered helicopter evacuation when [[PAVN]] shelling forced the cessation of fixed-wing evacuation from [[Tan Son Nhut]] airport. With fighter cover provided by carrier aircraft, the helicopters landed at the [[US Embassy, Saigon]] and the [[Military Assistance Command, Vietnam#MACV Headquarters/DAO Compound|DAO Compound]] to pick up evacuees. The last helicopter lifted off the roof of the [[US Embassy, Saigon]] at 07:53 on 30 April 1975 carrying the last 11 [[Marine Security Guards]]. During Operation Frequent Wind, aircraft from ''Enterprise'' flew 95 sorties.

====Eighth and ninth deployments====
In July 1976 ''Enterprise'' began her eighth [[Western Pacific Ocean|Western Pacific]] deployment.

In February 1977, [[Idi Amin]], the President of [[Uganda]], made derogatory remarks against the United States in public and Americans in Uganda were taken hostage. This was several months after the [[Israel]]i [[Operation Entebbe|raid at Entebbe airport]]. ''Enterprise'' and her escort ships, having just left [[Mombasa]] after a port call, were directed to remain in the area and operated off the east African coast for about one week. At that point the ships were scheduled to transit home after a seven-month deployment. The ship's Marine detachment and air wing prepared for a possible mission to rescue and evacuate the Americans, but Amin eventually released all the hostages.  The ships then steamed across the Indian Ocean at high speed to make a previously scheduled final port call at [[NAS Cubi Point]] in the Philippines before returning to NAS Alameda.

In 1978, ''Enterprise'' underwent her ninth Western Pacific deployment, including port calls in Hong Kong, Perth, Australia, and Singapore. In January 1979, the carrier sailed into [[Puget Sound Naval Shipyard]] for a 36-month comprehensive overhaul. During this overhaul, the ship's superstructure was modified, removing the [[SCANFAR]] radars and the unique inverted cone-shaped top section which was three stories high. During the lengthy overhaul, ''Enterprise'' was referred to as &quot;Building 65&quot; by Navy and shipyard personnel.

===1980s===
In 1982, the carrier underwent her 10th WESTPAC deployment. In April 1983, ''Enterprise'' ran aground on a sandbar in San Francisco Bay while returning from deployment and remained stuck there for several hours.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,923599,00.html &quot;Off Course&quot;]. Time, 9 May 1983.&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, [[George Takei]], who played Mr. Sulu, helmsman of the fictional starship {{USS|Enterprise|NCC-1701|2}} was aboard at the time as a Distinguished Visitor of the Navy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/danfs/e4/enterprise-viiie.htm History.navy.mil]&lt;/ref&gt; Even though groundings and collisions are usually career-enders for U.S. warship captains, the captain at the time, [[Robert J. Kelly]], who had already been selected for promotion to commodore, eventually became a four-star admiral and commander in chief of the U.S. Pacific Fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cpf.navy.mil/former_commander.htm CPF.navy.mil]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984, the carrier underwent her 11th WESTPAC deployment. On 2 November 1985, she struck Bishops Rock on the [[Cortes Bank]] during exercises, damaging the outer hull and propeller. She continued operations and later went to drydock for repairs.

In 1986, the carrier made her 12th WESTPAC deployment. On 28 April 1986, ''Enterprise'' became the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to transit the [[Suez Canal]]. She went from the [[Red Sea]] to the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] to relieve ''Coral Sea'', on station with {{USS|America|CV-66|2}} off the coast of [[Libya]]. ''Enterprise'' entered the Mediterranean to support &quot;[[Bombing of Libya (1986)|Operation Eldorado Canyon]]&quot;, the U.S. bombing of Libya. It was the ship's first visit to the Mediterranean in more than 22 years.

In April 1988, ''Enterprise'' underwent her 13th deployment and was assigned to [[Operation Earnest Will]], escorting reflagged [[Kuwait]]i oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. On April 14, another Earnest Will ship, {{USS|Samuel B. Roberts|FFG-58|2}}, struck an Iranian mine in [[international waters]]. In response, the U.S. launched [[Operation Praying Mantis]] against Iranian targets, starting with two Iranian [[oil platform]]s that were being used as support bases for Iranian attacks on merchant shipping. Aircraft from ''Enterprise's'' [[Carrier Air Wing 11|CVW-11]] bombed two Iranian frigates, helping to sink one, and provided other air support for the strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;nohigherhonor&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title= No Higher Honor: Saving the USS Samuel B. Roberts in the Persian Gulf|last= Peniston|first= Bradley|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006 |publisher= Naval Institute Press |location= Annapolis, Maryland |isbn= 1-59114-661-5|page= |pages= 181â187 |url= http://www.navybook.com/nohigherhonor/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1989, ''Enterprise'' left Alameda and began her 14th overseas deployment, an around-the-world cruise that would end at the ship's new homeport of [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Virginia. In early December 1989, ''Enterprise'' and ''Midway'' participated in [[1989 Philippine coup attempt#American Involvement|Operation Classic Resolve]], President [[George H.W. Bush]]'s response to Philippine President [[Corazon Aquino]]'s request for air support during the rebel coup attempt. ''Enterprise'' remained on station conducting flight operations in the waters outside Manila Bay until the situation subsided.

===1990s===
In March 1990, ''Enterprise'' completed her around-the-world deployment, arriving in [[Norfolk, Virginia]], after having steamed more than {{convert|43000|mi|abbr=on}} &lt;!-- nautical or statute? nautical!--&gt;. In October, the carrier moved to Newport News Shipbuilding for refueling and the Navy's largest [[RCOH|complex overhaul]] refit ever attempted. During this overhaul, the Navy extended the carrier's length from {{convert|1101|ft|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert|1123|ft|m|abbr=on}}, as well as other modifications to extend her service life.

On 27 September 1994, ''Enterprise'' returned to sea for sea trials, during which she performed an extended full power run as fast as when she was new.

On 28 June 1996, ''Enterprise'' began her 15th overseas deployment. The carrier enforced no-fly zones in Bosnia as part of [[Operation Joint Endeavor]] and over Iraq as part of [[Operation Southern Watch]]. The deployment ended in December 1996, which also marked the end of active service for the [[A-6 Intruder]] from the Navy. In February 1997, ''Enterprise'' entered Newport News Shipbuilding for an extended selective restrictive availability lasting four-and-a-half months.

In November 1998, following workups, ''Enterprise'' departed on her 16th overseas deployment, with [[Carrier Air Wing Three|CVW-3]] embarked.  On the night of 8 November, shortly after the start of the deployment, a [[EA-6B Prowler]] crashed into an [[S-3 Viking]] on the carrier's flight deck. The mishap occurred as the EA-6B was landing during night [[carrier qualification]]s, striking the folded wings of the S-3, which had not yet cleared the landing area of the flight deck.  The four crew of the EA-6B perished when the aircraft hit the water, but the two crew members of the S-3  [[ejection seat|ejected]]. A fire broke out on the flight deck, but was quickly extinguished by the flight deck crew. Three of the four members of the Prowler crew were lost at sea, and the remains of the fourth were recovered shortly after the crash. The crew of the Viking were rushed to the [[Naval Medical Center Portsmouth (Portsmouth, Virginia)]]. There were no other significant injuries.  An exhaustive search for three missing EA-6B Prowler crew members was suspended after nearly 24 hours.

On 23 November 1998, ''Enterprise'' relieved {{USS|Dwight D. Eisenhower|CVN-69|2}} in the [[Persian Gulf]]. During a port call in [[Dubai, UAE]], the carrier hosted former President George H.W. Bush and a live concert by [[Grammy Award]]-winning rock group [[Hootie and the Blowfish]]. In December 1998, ''Enterprise'' battlegroup spearheaded [[Operation Desert Fox]], destroying Iraqi military targets with more than 300 [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|Tomahawk land attack missiles]] and {{convert|691000|lb|ST t|abbr=on}} of ordnance. The 70-hour assault was carried out by ''Enterprise'', {{USS|Gettysburg|CG-64|2}}, {{USS|Stout|DDG-55|2}}, {{USS|Nicholson|DD-982|2}} and {{USS|Miami|SSN-755|2}}.

Shortly after the [[Racak massacre]] and failure of [[Yugoslavia]]n [[Rambouillet Agreement|peace talks]] in [[Rambouillet]], France, ''Enterprise'' quickly left a port visit in [[Cannes]], France to return to the [[Adriatic]].

In early March 1999, ''Enterprise'' returned to the [[Persian Gulf]] to relieve {{USS|Carl Vinson|CVN-70|2}} in support of [[Operation Southern Watch]], returning to Norfolk in May 1999.

During the 1998&amp;ndash;1999 deployment, ''Enterprise'' steamed more than {{convert|50000|nmi|abbr=on}} &lt;!-- nautical  --&gt; and spent 151 days underway. ''Enterprise'' Battle Group was the first to deploy with [[IT-21]], which allowed unprecedented internal and external communication capabilities, including commercial internet, email, and television.

===2000s===
On 25 April 2001, ''Enterprise'' began her 17th overseas deployment with [[Carrier Air Wing Eight|CVW-8]]. From 18â28 June, the carrier and four escorts participated in an exercise with the British [[Royal Navy]] in a joint and combined warfare training exercise in the [[North Sea]], near the [[Hebrides Islands]] and in [[Scotland]].

''Enterprise'' was beginning her voyage home from the [[Persian Gulf]] when the [[September 11 attacks]] were carried out. Without orders, the carrier returned at [[flank speed]] to the waters off Southwest Asia near the [[Persian Gulf]], outrunning her escorts. In October 2001, the United States launched air attacks against [[Al Qaeda]] training camps and [[Taliban]] military installations in [[Afghanistan]]. The actions were designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a base for terrorist operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime. Over three weeks, aircraft from ''Enterprise'' flew nearly 700 missions and dropped large amounts of ordnance over Afghanistan. On 10 November, the carrier arrived at her home port of [[Norfolk, Virginia]], 16 days later than originally planned. During her last day at sea, the ship hosted a live two-hour broadcast of [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''Good Morning America.''  [[Garth Brooks]] performed a concert with [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] from ''Enterprise'' on 21 November while she was docked in Norfolk, Virginia.  The concert was carried live on [[CBS]].

In January 2002, ''Enterprise'' entered the [[Norfolk Naval Shipyard]], Portsmouth, Virginia for a scheduled one-year Extended Dry Docking Selected Restricted Availability.

====Operation Iraqi Freedom====
In 2003&amp;ndash;2004, the carrier provided air support for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. In 2004, the ship participated in Summer Surge 2004 and several multinational exercises.

In May 2006, ''Enterprise'' departed for a six-month deployment, operating in the [[U.S. Sixth Fleet|6th]], [[United States Fifth Fleet|5th]] and [[Seventh Fleet|7th]] Fleet areas, and supported both Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom. She returned to Norfolk 18 November 2006.

On 19 December 2007, the carrier returned home after a six-month deployment in the Persian Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlottesvillenewsplex.tv/home/headlines/12631106.html USS Enterprise Returns Home]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2008, ''Enterprise'' entered the Northrop-Grumman Newport News shipyard for a scheduled 18 month Extended Docking Selected Restricted Availability, with a projected completion date of September 2009.  As maintenance was performed, costs continued to rise above projections and the completion date repeatedly slid.  ''Enterprise'', the oldest active combat vessel in the Navy, was scheduled to be decommissioned as late as 2014. On April 6, 2009, [[Gary Roughead|Admiral Gary Roughead]], [[Chief of Naval Operations]], stated that he was seeking a congressional dispensation to speed up the process to decommission ''Enterprise''. Under this new timetable, the ship would complete one final deployment before being decommissioned in late 2012 or early 2013. This would temporarily reduce the U.S. Navy to having only ten active aircraft carriers through the launch of the {{USS|Gerald R. Ford|CVN-78|2}} in 2015.  In October 2009, the House and Senate Armed Services Committees agreed with the recommendation, approving the decommissioning of  ''Enterprise'' in 2013 after 51 years of service.&lt;ref name=&quot;retire2&quot; /&gt;

===2010s===

In April 2010, the Navy announced that the cost of refurbishing the carrier had risen to $655 million and was scheduled to be completed the same month.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Peter, &quot;USS Enterprise Delayed Again; Cost Of Maintenance Balloons 44.5 Percent&quot;, ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', April 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 19, 2010, ''Enterprise'' left the Northrop Grumman shipyard to conduct sea trials in preparation for return to the fleet.&lt;ref name=&quot;ASD News&quot;&gt;[http://www.asdnews.com/news/27375/Enterprise_Departs_for_Sea_Trials.htm &quot;Enterprise Departs for Sea Trials&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The total cost of refurbishing the carrier was $662 million, which was 46% over budget and took eight months longer than originally scheduled.  The Navy stated that it planned to use the carrier for two six-month deployments before her scheduled decommissioning date in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Frost, Peter.

On 1 January 2011, the Virginian-Pilot leaked highlights from the final video of a set entitled &quot;XO Movie Night&quot; that was filmed on ''Enterprise'' and aired via closed circuit television on select Saturday evenings.  The videos, which were not meant to be released outside of the command, were produced by Capt. [[Owen Honors]] when he was executive officer (XO) of the ship in the 2006&amp;ndash;2007 timeframe and included profanity, anti-gay slurs, and sexually suggestive scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2010/12/raunchy-videos-starring-enterprise-skipper-come-light |title= Raunchy videos starring Enterprise skipper come to light |accessdate= 2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-12114023 |title= Navy Captain Owen Honors 'to lose post for lewd videos' |accessdate= 2011-01-04 | work=BBC News |date=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Capt.

John C. Harvey Jr., the commander of the United States Fleet Forces Command in Norfolk removed Honors for demonstrating poor judgment.  Capt. Dee Mewbourne was appointed as replacement commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.mil/search/display.asp?story_id=57937 |title=USFF Relieves USS Enterprise Commanding Officer |publisher=U.S. Navy - Fleet Forces Command Public Affairs |accessdate=2011-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forty officers and enlisted sailors, including six [[flag officer]]s, were later disciplined to varying extents over the incident.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Military Times]]'', &quot;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2011/03/navy-harvey-honors-investigation-030311w/ 40 faulted in Enterprise video investigation]&quot;, 3 March 2011; retrieved 4 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier and her strike group deployed on January 13, 2011.  Accompanying the carrier on the cruise to the Persian Gulf and Mediterranean were [[Carrier Air Wing One]], guided missile cruiser {{USS|Leyte Gulf|CG-55|2}}, and guided missile destroyers {{USS|Barry|DDG-52|2}}, {{USS|Bulkeley|DDG-84|2}}, and {{USS|Mason|DDG-87|2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Lessig, Hugh, &quot;Enterprise Carrier Group To Deploy Next Week&quot;, ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', 8 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2011 the ''Enterprise'' was involved in an [[Quest Incident|incident]] with [[Somali pirates]], an event which ended in the deaths of four American citizens and four pirates.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/41715530/ns/world_news-africa/t/four-american-hostages-killed-somali-pirates/ MSNBC.msn.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The carrier returned to Norfolk on 15 July 2011.  During its deployment, it had participated in operations which had captured 75 Somali pirates and had missile strikes by its strike group against the Libyan government.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, Todd Allen, &quot;USS Enterprise Returns To Norfolk&quot;, ''[[Newport News Daily Press]]'', 16 July 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future prospects===

''Enterprise'' will be the first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to be decommissioned by the [[United States Navy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;navytimes.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.navytimes.com/news/2009/04/navy_enterprise_040509w/ &quot;CNO wants faster decommissioning for Enterprise&quot;], April 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2009, an [[Internet]]-based petition began circulating to convert ''Enterprise'' into a museum ship after she is decommissioned.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cvn65.epetitions.net/ CVN65.epetitions.net]&lt;/ref&gt; The costs of doing so regarding her nuclear reactors has yet to be calculated by the [[United States Department of Defense]]. A petition has also been set up for the next carrier to be named as the ninth {{USS|Enterprise}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ussenterp.epetitions.net/signatures.php?petition_id=1870|title=Signatures for A Petition to name the next United States Navy nuclear powered aircraft carrier the USS Enterprise|accessdate= 2011-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newport News Shipbuilding]] will deactivate and de-fuel the ship after her decommissioning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/USS-Enterprise-The-Beginning-of-the-End-for-the-Big-E-05157/ USS Enterprise: The Beginning of the End for the âBig Eâ] - Defence Industry Daily, 13/11/08&lt;/ref&gt; Using the fates of previous U.S. Navy aircraft carriers as a guide, once the ship's nuclear fuel and reactor machinery has been removed and disposed of, petitioners and naval enthusiasts want the ship to become a museum, however that may not be possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;lastdeployment&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navytimes.com/news/2010/09/navy-enterprise-prepares-last-combat-deployment-092010w/|title=Big E preps for final combat deployment|publisher=Navy Times|author=Erwing, Phillip|date=2010-09-21|accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the Navy dismantles and recycles the ship's reactors, there will be very little left to turn into a museum;&lt;ref name=&quot;lastdeployment&quot;/&gt; virtually everything two decks below the hangar bay would have to be cut apart.&lt;ref name=&quot;lastdeployment&quot;/&gt;  ''Enterprise'' may also enter the [[Ship-Submarine Recycling Program]].
