Following Ben Ali's departure, a [[state of emergency]] was declared. The Constitutional Court affirmed [[Fouad Mebazaa]] as acting president under Article 57 of the Constitution. A caretaker coalition government was also created, including members of Ben Ali's party, the [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]] (RCD), in key ministries, while including other [[Opposition (politics)|opposition]] figures in other ministries, with elections to take place within 60 days. However, five newly appointed non-RCD ministers resigned&lt;ref name=&quot;threeministers&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_protests_21jan&quot; /&gt; almost immediately, and daily street protests in Tunis and other towns around Tunisia continued, demanding that the new government have no RCD members and that the RCD itself be disbanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_protests_21jan&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_RCD_newgov_rejected&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_RCD_disband&quot; /&gt; On 27 January Prime Minister [[Mohamed Ghannouchi]] reshuffled the government, removing all former RCD members other than himself.

Following further public protests, Ghannouchi himself resigned on 27 February, and [[Beji Caid el Sebsi]] became Prime Minister; two other members of the Interim Government resigned on the following day. On 3 March 2011, the president announced the [[Tunisian Constituent Assembly election, 2011|elections for the Constituent Assembly]], which were held on 23 October 2011 with the Islamist Nahdah Party winning the plurality of seats. 

==Naming==

In Tunisia and the wider Arab world, the protests and change in government are called the '''Sidi Bouzid Revolt''', derived from [[Sidi Bouzid]], the city where the initial protests began.&lt;ref name=&quot;SidiBouzid_FB&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/video/video.php?v=151395198244689 |title=Niet compatibele browser |publisher=Facebook |date=|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SidiBouzid_libcom&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://libcom.org/forums/news/protests-spread-tunisia-29122010 |title=The Sidi Bouzid Revolution: Ben Ali flees as protests spread in Tunisia |publisher=libcom.org |date=|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SidiBouzid_YT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8thJM2nmd_g |title=Revolte Tunisie Sidi bouzid 3 |publisher=YouTube |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western media, these events have been dubbed the '''Jasmine Revolution'''&lt;ref name=&quot;europe1.fr&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Par FrÃ©dÃ©ric Frangeul |url=http://www.europe1.fr/International/D-ou-vient-la-revolution-du-jasmin-375743/ |title=DâoÃ¹ vient la &quot;rÃ©volution du jasmin&quot; ? |publisher=Europe 1 |date=17 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011 |language=french |trans_title=From where does the &quot;Jasmin Revolution&quot; come from?}} ([http://translate.google.com/translate?js=n&amp;prev=_t&amp;hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;layout=2&amp;eotf=1&amp;sl=auto&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.europe1.fr%2FInternational%2FD-ou-vient-la-revolution-du-jasmin-375743%2F Google Translate version])&lt;/ref&gt; after Tunisia's national flower and in keeping with the geopolitical nomenclature of &quot;[[color revolutions]]&quot;.

The Tunisian revolution has also been considered the first of a series of revolutions named the [[Arab Spring]].

==Background==

President [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] had ruled Tunisia since 1987 with an iron fist. His government, which had been criticised in the media and amongst NGOs, was supported by the United States and France. As a result, the initial reactions to Ben Ali's abuses by the U.S. and France were muted, and most instances of socio-political protest in the country, when they occurred at all, rarely made major news headlines.&lt;ref name=&quot;end of an era&quot;/&gt;

Riots in Tunisia were rare&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/10/world/main7233191.shtml |title=Deadly Riots in Tunisia Shut Down Schools |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and noteworthy, especially since the country is generally considered to be wealthy and stable as compared to other countries in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011191414183128.html |title=Protesters killed in Tunisia riots |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any form of protests in the country were previously successfully oppressed and kept silent by the former regime and protesters would be jailed for such actions, as were for example protests by hundreds of unemployed demonstrators in [[Redeyef]] in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;precursor&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jean-Marie LEMAIRE / Rim MATHLOUTI |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110215-reporters-tunisia-redeyef-gafsa-mining-phosphate-accusations-competition-rigged-ben-ali-supporters-protests-journalists |title=Redeyef, the precursor of the Tunisian revolution |publisher=http://www.france24.com |date=15 Februari 2011 |accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Al Jazeera English]]'' also said that Tunisian activists are amongst the most outspoken in its part of the world with various messages of support being posted on ''Twitter'' for Bouazizi.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122063745828931.html |title=Riots reported in Tunisian city â Africa â Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=20 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[op-ed]] article in the same network said of the action that it was &quot;suicidal protests of despair by Tunisia's youth.&quot; It pointed out that the state-controlled [[National Solidarity Fund]] and the [[National Employment Fund]] had traditionally subsidised many goods and services in the country but had started to shift the &quot;burden of providence from state to society&quot; to be funded by the &quot;''[[bidonville]]s'',&quot; or [[shanty towns]], around the richer towns and suburbs.{{clarify|date=January 2011}} It also cited the &quot;marginalisation of the agrarian and arid central and southern areas [that] continue[s] unabated.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;protestsgoingon&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Larbi Sadiki |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2010/12/20101227142811755739.html |title=Tunisia: The battle of Sidi Bouzid â Opinion â Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=27 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protests were also called an &quot;uprising&quot; because of &quot;a lethal combination of poverty, unemployment and political repression: three characteristics of most Arab societies.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lamis Andoni |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2010/12/20101231161958792947.html |title=The rebirth of Arab activism â Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=31 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another cause for the uprising has been attributed to the inability of the Tunisian government from being able to censor information from reaching the Tunisian people troll, such as information from [[WikiLeaks]] [[Contents of the United States diplomatic cables leak (analysis of individual leaders)#Tunisia|describing rampant corruption]] in the Tunisian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strike-the-root.com/internet-and-muhammad-bouazizi |title=The Internet and Muhammad Bouazizi |publisher=Strike-the-root.com |date=19 January 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sidi Bouzid and Mohamed Bouazizi===

Twenty-six year old [[Mohamed Bouazizi]] had been the sole income earner in his extended family of eight. He operated a purportedly unlicensed vegetable cart for seven years in [[Sidi Bouzid]] 190 miles (300&amp;nbsp;km) south of Tunis. On 17 December 2010 a policewoman confiscated his cart and produce. Bouazizi, who had such an event happen to him before, tried to pay the 10-dinar fine (a day's wages, equivalent to 7USD). In response the policewoman 
insulted his deceased father. A humiliated Bouazizi then went to the provincial headquarters in an attempt to complain to local municipality officials. He was refused an audience. Without alerting his family, at 11:30&amp;nbsp;am and within an hour of the initial confrontation, Bouazizi returned to the headquarters, doused himself with a flammable liquid and set himself on fire. Public outrage quickly grew over the incident, leading to protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2043557,00.html | title=Bouazizi: The Man Who Set Himself and Tunisia on Fire | author=Rania Abouzeid | date=Bouzid Friday, 21 Jan. 2011|work=Time Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/922279--suicide-protest-helped-topple-tunisian-regime | title=Suicide protest helped topple Tunisian regime | location=Toronto | work=The Star | date=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This immolation and the subsequent heavy-handed response by the police to peaceful marchers caused riots the next day in [[Sidi Bouzid]] that went largely unnoticed, although [[social media]] sites such as Facebook and YouTube featured images of police dispersing youths who attacked shop windows and damaged cars. Bouazizi was subsequently transferred to a hospital near Tunis. In an attempt to quell the unrest President [[Zine el Abidine Ben Ali]] visited Bouazizi in hospital on 28 December 2010. Bouazizi died on 4&amp;nbsp;January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFJOE70408420110105 | title=Tunisian who sparked rare protests dies: relatives -Reuters | publisher=Af.reuters.com | date=5 January 2011 | accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Protests==

Though the bulk of protests followed Bouazizi's self-immolation and led to the departure of Ben Ali, protests also continued after his departure in demanding his party be removed from government. Some more minor protests followed the cabinet reshuffle.

===Early protests===

There were reports of police obstructing demonstrators and using [[tear gas]] on hundreds of young protesters in [[Sidi Bouzid]] in mid-December 2010. The protesters had gathered outside regional government headquarters to demonstrate against the treatment of Mohamed Bouazizi. Coverage of events was limited by Tunisian media.

On 22 December, Lahseen Naji, a protester, responded to &quot;hunger and joblessness&quot; by electrocuting himself after climbing an [[electricity pylon]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Protests continue in Tunisia&quot;/&gt; Ramzi Al-Abboudi also killed himself because of financial difficulties arising from a business debt by the country's [[micro-credit]] solidarity programme.&lt;ref name=&quot;protestsgoingon&quot;/&gt; On {{Nowrap|24 December}}, Mohamed Ammari was fatally shot in the chest by police in Bouziane.

Violence later increased as Tunisian authorities and residents of [[Sidi Bouzid Governorate]] encountered each other once again. The protests had reached the capital [[Tunis]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Protests continue in Tunisia&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122682433751904.html|title=Protests continue in Tunisia|date=26 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=26 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; on {{Nowrap|27 December}} with about 1,000 citizens expressing solidarity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2010/12/20101228182021539319.html |title=Tunisia jobless protests rage â Africa â Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with residents of Sidi Bouzid and calling for jobs. The rally, which was called by independent trade union activists, was stopped by security forces. The protests also spread to [[Sousse]], [[Sfax]] and [[Meknassy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/20101227204853391930.html |title=Job protests escalate in Tunisia â Africa â Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day the Tunisian Federation of Labour Unions held another rally in [[Gafsa]] which was also blocked by security forces. At the same time about 300 lawyers held a rally near the government's palace in Tunis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bilal Randeree |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122819724363553.html |title=Tensions flare across Tunisia â Africa â Al Jazeera English |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protests continued again on the {{Nowrap|29 December}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;wed&quot;/&gt;

On 30 December, police peacefully broke up a protest in [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]] while using force to disrupt further demonstrations in [[Sbikha]] and [[Chebba]]. Momentum appeared to continue with the protests on {{Nowrap|31 December}} and further demonstrations and public gatherings by lawyers in Tunis and other cities following a call by the Tunisian National Lawyers Order. Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League (LTDH), said that lawyers across Tunisia had been &quot;savagely beaten.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Another Tunisian protester dies&quot;/&gt; There were also unconfirmed reports of another man attempting to commit suicide in [[El Hamma]].&lt;ref name=&quot;video: today a young unemployed man trying to commit a suicide in El Hamma #sidibouzid&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://24sur24.posterous.com/video-today-a-young-unemployed-man-trying-to|title=video: today a young unemployed man trying to commit a suicide in El Hamma #sidibouzid|date=31 December 2010|work=Nawaat|accessdate=31 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 January 2011, protests in [[Thala]] over unemployment and a high [[cost of living]] turned violent. At a demonstration of 250 people, mostly students, in support of the protesters in Sidi Bouzid, police fired tear gas; one canister landed in a local mosque. In response, the protesters were reported to have set fire to tyres and attacked the office of [[Constitutional Democratic Rally]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bilal Randeree |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201114101752467578.html |title=Violent clashes continue in Tunisia â Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=4 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the more general protests sought changes in the government's online censorship, where a lot of the media images have been broadcast. Tunisian authorities also allegedly carried out [[phishing]] operations to take control of user passwords and check online criticism. Both state and non-state websites had been hacked.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al Jazeera Ryan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Yasmine Ryan |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/features/2011/01/20111614145839362.html |title=Tunisia's bitter cyberwar â Features |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising elites' support and continuing protests===

On 6 January, 95% of Tunisia's 8,000 lawyers went on strike, according to the chairman of the national [[bar association]]. He said &quot;The strike carries a clear message that we do not accept unjustified attacks on lawyers. We want to strongly protest against the beating of lawyers in the past few days.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201116193136690227.html |title=Thousands of Tunisia lawyers strike â Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported on the following day that teachers had also joined the strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Sandels |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-tunisia-riots-20110108,0,1279820.story |title=Rioting spreads across Tunisia; unrest also reported in Algeria |work=LA Times |date=8 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to 11 January protests police used riot gear to disperse protesters ransacking buildings, burning tires, setting fire to a bus and burning two cars in the working class suburb of [[Ettadhamen-Mnihla]] in Tunis. The protesters were said to have chanted &quot;We are not afraid, we are not afraid, we are afraid only of God.&quot; Military personnel were also deployed in many cities around the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/01/2011111214716877786.html |title=Tunisia unrest spreads to capital â Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=|accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January, a reporter from the Italian state-owned television broadcaster ''[[RAI]]'' stated that he and his cameraman were beaten with batons by police during a riot in Tunis' central district and that the officers then confiscated their camera.&lt;ref name=&quot;tg3web&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rai.tv/dl/RaiTV/programmi/media/ContentItem-0ec2c1f9-c6f3-48cd-8166-bc1eca6d13a9-tg3.html|title=Tunisi.

[[Hizb ut-Tahrir]] also organised protests after [[Friday prayer]] on 14 January to call for re-establishing the Islamic [[caliphate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNRhq4fFAto&amp;feature=player_embedded |title=Protests organized by Hizb ut-Tahrir calling for the re-establishment of the Islamic caliphate |publisher=Youtube |date=|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, it also organised other protests that went to the [[9 April Prison]] to free political prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alokab.com/forums/index.php?showtopic=56256 |title=Call for re-establishing Caliphate in streets of Tunisia and freeing political prisoners |publisher=Alokab.com |date=|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 14 January (the same day that Ben Ali fled), [[Lucas Dolega]], a photojournalist working for [[European Pressphoto Agency]], was hit in the forehead by a [[tear gas]] canister allegedly fired by the police at short range; he died two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier Laurent, &quot;[http://www.bjp-online.com/british-journal-of-photography/news/1937417/french-photographer-dies-tunisia UNESCO, French government call for investigation of Lucas Dolega's death &lt;nowiki&gt;[update 7]&lt;/nowiki&gt;]&quot;, ''British Journal of Photography,'' 16 January 2011; David Walker, &quot;[http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/news/Photographer-Dies-of-1505.shtml Photographer dies of injuries in Tunis]&quot;, ''Photo District News,'' 18 January 2011; Matthias Bruggmann, et al., &quot;[http://www.visapourlimage.com/news/4967.do Lucas Mebrouk Dolega]&quot;&lt;!-- backed up at http://www.webcitation.org/5vvYDTZEX --&gt;, Visa pour l'image, 18 January 2011; Michel Puech, &quot;[http://www.lalettredelaphotographie.com/entries/lucas-dolega-succumbs-to-a-hand-grenade Lucas Dolega succumbs to a hand grenade]&quot;, ''La Lettre de la photographie,'' 22 January 2011.

Internal and external protests against the presence of [[Constitutional Democratic Rally|RCD]] members in the new government occurred daily starting on 17 January, the day that the new cabinet was announced. Thousands of anti-RCD protesters rallied on 17 January in a protest with relatively little violence between security services and protestors.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.sky.com/skynews/Article/201009115896853&lt;/ref&gt;  Pro-Ben Ali supporters held a rally later in the day.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}} The [[Tunisian General Labour Union]]'s ministers resigned after a day (18 January), citing the presence of RCD ministers in the government as the reason.&lt;ref name=&quot;threeministers&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=Tunisia announces withdrawal of 3 ministers from unity gov't: TV  | date=18 January 2011 | publisher=[[People's Daily Online]] | url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7264930.html |accessdate=20 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vrgMnytL |archivedate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mustafa ben Jaafar also refused to take up his post. The interim president and prime minister then left the RCD in a bid to calm protests against the inclusion of RCD members in the government with the PM stating that all members of the national unity government had &quot;clean hands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_RCD_disband&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12220862|title=Tunisia: New government leaders quit ruling party | work=BBC News | date=18 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 January, street protests against RCD participation in the new government included hundreds of people demonstrating in Tunis, [[Sfax]], [[Gabes]], [[Bizerta]], [[Sousse]] and [[Monastir, Tunisia|Monastir]].&lt;ref name=&quot;threeministers&quot; /&gt; The protests continued on 19 January, with the demand that no &quot;former allies&quot; of Ben Ali should remain in the government, including hundreds of protestors marching in central Tunis and about 30 staging a sit-in near the [[Ministry of the Interior (Tunisia)|Ministry of the Interior]], ignoring a curfew.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_RCD_newgov_rejected&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=Tunisia leader vows break with past  | date=19 January 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011119201252887481.html |accessdate=19 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vrfRSxUe |archivedate=19 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors also called for the RCD to be disbanded.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc_RCD_disband&quot; /&gt; On 20 January, hundreds of people demonstrated outside of the RCD headquarters in Tunis with the same aims, and protests in other towns around Tunisia were reported.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_antiRCDprotests_20jan&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title=Tunisia cabinet to lift party bans  | date=20 January 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201112014107109184.html |accessdate=20 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vstKVA6X |archivedate=20 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands participated in 21 January protests outside the Interior Ministry.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljaz_protests_21jan&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first= | last= | pages= | language =| title= Protests hit Tunisia amid mourning | date=21 January 2011 |publisher=Al Jazeera | url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011121104023232257.html  |accessdate=21 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vuUSjc1C |archivedate=21 January 2011 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Zouhair M'Dhaffer]], a close confidant of Ben Ali who was seen as the main architect of the 2002 constitutional reform to lift term limits, resigned from the government on 20 January. All other RCD ministers resigned from the party on the same day. The central committee of the RCD also disbanded on that day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.taz.de/1/politik/afrika/artikel/1/ben-alis-partei-ohne-politbuero/ |title=Regierungsbildung in Tunesien: Ben Alis Partei ohne PolitbÃ¼ro |publisher=taz.de |date=|accessdate=26 January 2011}} {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Top_News/World-News/2011/01/20/8-Tunisian-leaders-quit-ruling-party/UPI-57211295546906/ |title=8 Tunisian leaders quit ruling party |publisher=UPI.com |date=20 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 January, thousands of police began to join protests in Tunis over salaries and to assuage blame over political deaths attributed to them during Ben Ali's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1349766/Tunisia-riots-Police-join-protesters-streets.html |title=Tunisia riots: Police join protesters on the streets |publisher=Mail Online |date=24 January 2011|accessdate=26 January 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the country's army chief [[Rachid Ammar]] announced on 24 January 2011 it was on the side of the protesters and would &quot;defend the revolution&quot;, rumours emerged that the government would be replaced by a council of &quot;wise men&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/2011124163051778391.html |title=Tunisia cabinet to be reshuffled |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=24 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cabinet reshuffle====

On 27 January 2011 Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi announced that six former members of the RCD party had left the interim government. These included Defence Minister, Foreign Minister, Finance Minister and Interior Minister. Apart from the prime minister, the new government retained just two ministers from Ben Ali's old governmentâthe industry and international cooperation ministersâbut neither of these had been a member of his ruling RCD party. This move was seen as meeting one of the demands of the protestors in Tunisia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12302232 |title=Tunisia announces major cabinet reshuffle after protest |publisher=BBC News |date=27 January 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was supported by the UGTT, which stated its support for the reorganised cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/world/africa/28tunisia.html Most Members of Old Cabinet in Tunisia Step Down]&lt;/ref&gt; New ministers included independent state attorney [[Farhat Rajhi]] as interior minister, retired career diplomat [[Ahmed Ounaies]] as foreign minister and [[Elyes Jouini]] (an economist living in France) as minister delegate to the prime minister in charge of administrative and economic reform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7275560.html Tunisian labor union backs reshuffle of interim government] People's Daily Online, 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Ghannouchi protests===

{{As of|2011|01|28}}, hundreds of people camped beside Mohamed Ghannouchi's office protested against Ghannouchi remaining in the interim government.&lt;ref name=&quot;antiGhann_protests&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | first=Lin | last=Noueihed | pages= | language =| title=Tunisia protesters turn government HQ into campsite | date=28 January 2011 | publisher=Reuters | url=http://af.reuters.com/article/libyaNews/idAFLDE70R13720110128?sp=true |accessdate=29 January 2011 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5w6ESsvhm |archivedate=29 January 2011 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A student coordinating food distribution at the protests, Saifeddine Missraoui, stated, &quot;We are not leaving here until Ghannouchi leaves and we get a brand new government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;antiGhann_protests&quot; /&gt; Another protestor, Naim Garbousi from Casbah Media Relations, stated, &quot;The new line-up is a theatre.

We are 10&amp;nbsp;million people, there will surely be someone who can replace him.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;antiGhann_protests&quot; /&gt;

On 2 February 2011, the former interior minister, Rafik Belhaj Kacem also, was arrested by his successor, Farhat Rajhi, concurrently with accusations of former allies of Ben Ali trying to destabilize the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailystar.com.lb/article.asp?edition_id=10&amp;categ_id=2&amp;article_id=124437#axzz1CtomXvJQ |title=Politics â Tunisia interior minister says predecessor arrested |publisher=The Daily Star |date=2 February 2011 |accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later protests and developments===

On 4 February, Sidi Bouzid was again the scene of protests despite the arrests of two security forces personnel for deaths of two. Several hundred people turned up at the local police station as a result of medical staff at a local hospital saying they found signs of burning on the victims' bodies. On 5 February, protesters in [[El Kef]] called for the local police chief Khaled Ghazouani to be sacked for abusing his authority. Protesters threw stones and small firebombs as well as burned two cars, one of which was a police vehicle. Police first responded with tear gas and then fired on the protesters in which two people were killed immediately and two died in hospital, 15 others were also wounded. The region's [[prefect]] Mohamed Najib Tlijali called for calm&lt;ref name=&quot;chron.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=By BOUAZZA BEN BOUAZZA Associated Press |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/top/all/7414844.html |title=Tunisian police fire on crowd, killing 2 &amp;#124; Top AP Stories &amp;#124; Chron.com â Houston Chronicle |work=Houston Chronicle  |date=|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;chron.com&quot;/&gt; as the police chief was arrested.

Protests flared up again on 19 February and 20 February, with 40,000 protesters demanding a new interim government completely free of any people associated with the old regime. Protesters also demanded a parliamentary system of government instead of the current presidential one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/international/tunisia-protests-resume-for-second-straight-day-amid-uncertainty-of-future-government-1.344628 |title=Tunisia protests resume for second straight day amid uncertainty of future government â Haaretz Daily Newspaper &amp;#124; Israel News |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7294037.html |title=Thousands call for setting up parliamentary system in Tunisia â People's Daily Online |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=21 February 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a date was announced for an [[Tunisian general election, 2011|election]] in mid-July 2011, more than 100,000 protesters continued to demand the removal of Ghannouchi as interim prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/167012.html |title=PressTV - Tunisians want PM Ghannouchi gone |publisher=Presstv.ir |date=25 February 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After an even larger rally on 27 February 2011, Ghannouchi resigned, saying: &quot;After having taken more than one week of thinking, I became convinced, and my family shared my conviction, and decided to resign.

In mid-February, about 4,000 mostly Tunisian refugees landed on the Italian island of [[Lampedusa]], causing the authorities to declare a state of emergency&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/europe/2011/02/20112122328974957.html |title=Italy declares migrant emergency â Europe |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; that would allow for federal aid to the island.

Until now the system of patrolling the coasts of Northern Africa has worked and we want to re-establish the technique, which had reduced illegal immigration to zero until a month ago.&quot; Tunisia then said that it had troops patrolling southern fishing ports and that checkpoints had been erected in coastal towns. By 14 February, at least 2,000 refugees had been sent to [[Sicily]] with the other 2,000 [[quarantine]]d at a re-opened holding centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazrefugeeresponse&quot;/&gt; On 2 March about 350 more people arrived on the island.

The [[International Organisation for Migration]] said that no new boats had been spotted. The EU's Catherine Ashton was on a visit to Tunisia to discuss the issue. German Chancellor [[Angela Merkel]] said that &quot;not everyone who does not want to be in Tunisia can come to Europe. Rather, we need to talk to each other how we can strengthen the rule of law in Tunisia again and whether Europe can be of help.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;aljazrefugeeresponse&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/video/africa/2011/02/2011214133653175984.html |title=Italy struggles with Tunisia influx â Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=14 February 2011 |accessdate=20 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Domestic political response==

During a national television broadcast on {{Nowrap|28 December}}, [[List of Presidents of Tunisia|President]] [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali]] criticised people for their protests calling the perpetrators &quot;extremists and mercenaries&quot; and warned of &quot;firm&quot; punishment. He also accused &quot;certain foreign television channels of broadcasting false allegations without verification, based on dramatisation, fermentation and deformation by media hostile to Tunisia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/2010122823238574209.html|title=Tunisia president warns protesters|date=28 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks were ignored and the protests continued.&lt;ref name=&quot;wed&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2010/12/20101229122733122341.html|title=Tunisia struggles to end protests|date=29 December 2010|publisher=Al Jazeera|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December, Zine El Abidine Ben Ali shuffled his cabinet to remove his communications minister [[Oussama Romdhani]], while also announcing changes to the trade and handicrafts, religious affairs, communication and youth portfolios.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.alarabiya.net/articles/2010/12/29/131431.html|title=Tunisian president removes ministers after protests|date=29 December 2010|work=[[Al Arabiya]]|accessdate=29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he also announced the dismissal of the governors of Sidi Bouzid, [[Jendouba Governorate|Jendouba]] and [[Zaghouan Governorate|Zaghouan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rnw.nl/africa/bulletin/more-heads-roll-tunisian-social-crisis|title=More heads roll in Tunisian social crisis|date=30 December 2010|work=[[Radio Netherlands Worldwide]]|accessdate=30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2011, Ben Ali said 300,000 new jobs would be created, though he did not clarify what that meant. However, he also described the protests as &quot;the work of masked gangs that attacked at night government buildings and even civilians inside their homes in a terrorist act that cannot be overlooked.&quot; [[Ahmed Najib Chebbi]], the leader of the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Tunisia)|Progressive Democratic Party]], then said that despite official claims of police firing in self-defense &quot;the demonstrations were non-violent and the youths were claiming their rights to jobs&quot; and that &quot;the funeral processions [for those killed on 9 January] turned into demonstrations, and the police fired [at] the youths who were at these .. processions.&quot; He then criticised Ben Ali's comments as the protesters were &quot;claiming their civil rights, and there is no terrorist act...no religious slogans,&quot; while accusing Ben Ali of &quot;looking for scapegoats.&quot; He further criticised the additional jobs offered as mere &quot;promises.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;death&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Bilal Randeree |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/01/201111016239214548.html |title=Tunisian leader promises new jobs â Africa |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 January, the government announced the indefinite closure of all schools and universities in order to quell the unrest.&lt;ref name=&quot;schools&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12155670 |title=BBC News â Tunisia closes schools and universities following riots |publisher=BBC News |date=10 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Days before departing office, Ben Ali announced that he would not change the [[Constitution of Tunisia|present constitution]], which was read as, in effect, promising to step down in 2014 due to his age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110113-tunisia-protests-ben-ali-speech-will-not-seek-reelection |title=Ben Ali rules out 'presidency for life' as chaos spreads| publisher=France 24| date=13 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January, after Ben Ali left the country, international arrest warrants were issued for him, his wife and several other members of his family.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=CNN Wire Staff |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/africa/01/26/tunisia.warrant/ |title=Tunisia issues warrant for ousted leader, family members |publisher=CNN  |date=26 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Interior Ministry replaced 34 top-level security officials in a bid to bring change to the police, security services and spies that were a part of Ben Ali's security infrastructure. The interim [[head of state]] Fouad Mebazaa promised a national dialogue to address protester demands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/02/201121210345525985.html |title=Middle East rulers make concessions â Middle East |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=|accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign minister [[Ahmed Ounaies]] resigned on 13 February over controversial praise he gave to French Foreign Minister [[Michele Alliot-Marie]], who was being criticised for her ties to Ben Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2011/02/201121314913447933.html |title=Tunisian foreign minister resigns  |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=13 February 2011 |accessdate=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mouldi Kefi]] became the new foreign minister on 21 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shemsfm.net/actualite/actualites_tunisie-news/mouldi-kefi-est-le-nouveau-ministre-des-affaires-etrangeres/12 |title=Mouldi Kefi est le nouveau Ministre des Affaires EtrangÃ¨res |publisher=Shemsfm.net |date=|accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The unity government announced on 17 January included twelve members of the ruling RCD, the leaders of three opposition parties ([[Mustapha Ben Jafar]] from the [[Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties]], [[Ahmed Ibrahim]] of the [[Ettajdid Movement]] and [[Ahmed Najib Chebbi]] of the [[Progressive Democratic Party (Tunisia)|Progressive Democratic Party]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allheadlinenews.com/briefs/articles/90031186?Tunisian%20prime%20minister%20invites%20all%20political%20parties%20to%20form%20unity%20government|title=Tunisian prime minister invites all political parties to form unity government}}&lt;/ref&gt; three representatives from the [[Tunisian General Labour Union]] (UGTT) and representatives of civil society (including prominent blogger [[Slim Amamou]]). Just one day after the formation of the temporary government the three members of the UGTT as well as Mustapha Ben Jafaar, head of the FTDL opposition party quit saying that they had &quot;no confidence&quot; in a government that still featured members of the RCD party that ruled under Ben Ali.&lt;ref&gt;Angelique Chrisafis, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/jan/18/tunisia-caretaker-government-ministers-quit &quot;Tunisia's caretaker government in peril as four ministers quit,&quot;] ''The Guardian'' (18-01-2011).

;Political actions
On 7 February 2011 Tunisia's Defense Ministry called up recently retired troops as the country still struggles to contain unrest. Soldiers, retired within the last five years, as well as those who recently carried out their mandatory military service, are being asked to report for duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apnews.myway.com//article/20110207/D9L853V00.html |title=Tunisia calls up reserve troops amid unrest |publisher=Apnews.myway.com |date=|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; First steps were taken on a bill that would give the interim president, Fouad Mebazaa, emergency powers, allowing him to bypass the RCD-dominated parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bouderbala |first=Sofia |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5juBHIGNP6tw4F6SZgHqEqUv_71IA?docId=CNG.f633c1f93ead7c4ea82895634cdfeeaf.481 |title=AFP: Tunisian lawmakers approve emergency powers |publisher=Google  |date=|accessdate=8 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An agreement between the interim government and the [[UGTT]] on nomination of new governors was reached on 8 February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.people.com.cn/90001/90777/90855/7281826.html |title=Tunisian gov't reaches agreement with labor union on governor nomination â People's Daily Online |publisher=English.people.com.cn |date=|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further protests caused numerous fatalities, and on 27 Feb Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi resigned.

On 9 March, a court in Tunis announced the dissolution of the former ruling party, the Rally for Constitutional Democracy (RCD), and the liquidation of its assets and funds, but the party said it would appeal the decision.&lt;ref name=&quot;Al-Jazeera English&quot;/&gt;

On 14 April 2011, it was announced that Ben Ali would face 18 charges, including voluntary manslaughter and drug-trafficking. His family and former ministers are also going to face 26 further charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13082028 | work=BBC News | title=Tunisia's former President Ben Ali faces 18 charges | date=14 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prime Minister Mohamed Ghannouchi's government asked Saudi Arabia to extradite Ben Ali saying that &quot;following a new batch of charges against the ousted president regarding his involvement in several serious crimes aimed at perpetrating and inciting voluntary homicide and sowing discord between the citizens of the same country by pushing them to kill one another.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5g1FkUvosmNAcR0vpAT99VQg3f_tg?docId=CNG.2fa97f53bfcdc1875eb8f281d95222b2.601 |title=AFP: Tunisia asks Saudi Arabia to extradite Ben Ali |publisher=Google  |date=20 February 2011 |accessdate=1 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International and non-state===
{{main|International reactions to the Tunisian revolution}}
[[Image:Manif tunisie Nantes.JPG|thumb|Demonstration in support of the Tunisian protests in [[Nantes]], France, 15 January 2011.]]
Many governments and supranational organisations expressed concerns over use of force against protesters. [[France]], the former colonial power of Tunisia, was one of just a few states that expressed strong support for the Ben Ali government prior to its ouster, though protests were held in solidarity with Tunisia in several French cities and the [[French Socialist Party]] voiced support for the popular revolution.

===Media and punditry===

The protests and resultant political crisis have generally been called the ''Jasmine Revolution'' only in the foreign media.&lt;ref name=wp&gt;{{Cite news|first=Mona |last=Eltahawy |title=Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution

The lack of coverage in the domestic state-controlled media was criticised.&lt;ref name=&quot;begin&quot;/&gt; Writer/activist [[Jillian York]] alleged that the [[mainstream media]], particularly in the Western world, was providing less coverage and less sympathetic coverage to the Tunisia protests relative to Iranian protests and the [[Iranian Green Movement|Green movement]] and China's censorship. York alleged the &quot;US governmentâwhich intervened heavily in Iran, approving circumvention technology for export and famously asking Twitter to halt updates during a critical time periodâhas not made any public overtures toward Tunisia at this time.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jillian York |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111981222719974.html |title=Activist crackdown: Tunisia vs Iran â Opinion |publisher=Al Jazeera English |date=9 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite criticism about the &quot;sparse&quot; level of coverage and &quot;little interest&quot; given to the demonstrations by the international media, the protests have been hailed by some commentators as &quot;momentous events&quot; in Tunisian history.&lt;ref name=&quot;How a man setting fire to himself sparked an uprising in Tunisia&quot;/&gt; [[Brian Whitaker]], writing in ''[[The Guardian]]'', suggested on 28 December 2010, that the protests would be enough to bring an end to Ben Ali's presidency and noted similarities with the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|protests]] that led to the end of [[Nicolae CeauÅescu]]'s reign in [[Romania]] in 1989,&lt;ref name=&quot;How a man setting fire to himself sparked an uprising in Tunisia&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|author=Whitaker, Brian|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2010/dec/28/tunisia-ben-ali|title=How a man setting fire to himself sparked an uprising in Tunisia|date=28 December 2010|work=The Guardian |location=UK|publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]]|accessdate=28 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Steven Cook, writing for the [[Council of Foreign Relations]], notes that a [[Tipping point (sociology)|tipping point]] is only obvious after the fact, and points to the counter-example of the [[2009-2010 Iranian election protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/cook/2011/01/06/the-last-days-of-ben-ali/ |title=The Last Days of Ben Ali? |publisher=Steven Cook's Blog |date=6 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ben Ali's governing strategy was nevertheless regarded to be in serious trouble,&lt;ref name=&quot;protestwave&quot;/&gt; and [[Elliot Abrams]] noted both that demonstrators were able for the first time at the end of 2010 to defy the security forces and that the regime had no obvious successors outside of Ben Ali's own family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.cfr.org/abrams/2011/01/07/is-tunisia-next/ |title=Is Tunisia Next? |publisher=Elliott Abrams: Pressure Points |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=14 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Repercussion analysis==

''[[Al Jazeera]]'' read the ousting of the president as the &quot;glass ceiling of fear has been for ever shattered in Tunisia and that the police state that Ben Ali created in 1987 when he came to power in a coup seems to be disintegrating.&quot; Though it added that Ben Ali's resignation following his statement that he had been &quot;duped by his entourage&quot; may not entirely be sincere just yet. ''[[Le Monde]]'' criticised French President Nicolas Sarkozy and the European Union's &quot;Silence over the Tragedy&quot; when the unrest broke.&lt;ref name=&quot;end of an era&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Hashem Ahelbarra |url=http://blogs.aljazeera.net/2011/01/14/tunisia-end-era |title=Tunisia: The end of an era &amp;#124; Al Jazeera Blogs |publisher=Blogs.aljazeera.net |date=|accessdate=15 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' suggested that [[mobile telecommunications]] played an influential role in the &quot;revolution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Africa/Africa-Monitor/2011/0115/Tunisia-s-Jasmine-Revolution-and-how-mobile-phones-helped-it-happen |title=Tunisia's Jasmine Revolution, and how mobile phones helped it happen |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt in Tunisia began speculation that the Tunisian &quot;Jasmine Revolution&quot; would lead to protests against the multiple other autocratic regimes across the [[Arab world]]. This was most famously captured in the phrase asking whether ''&quot;Tunisia is the Arab [[GdaÅsk]]?''. The allusion refers to the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity movement]] and [[GdaÅsk]]'s role as the birthplace of the movement that [[Collapse of Communism|ousted Communism in Eastern Europe]]. The phrase appeared in outlets such as the [[BBC]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_9362000/9362677.stm |title=Today â Is this the 'Arab world's Gdansk?' |publisher=BBC News |date=15 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as editorials by well known columnists [[Rami George Khouri|Rami Khouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondoweiss.net/2011/01/khouri-tunisia-is-gdansk-shipyard-of-80-with-jazeera-as-megaphone-to-other-arab-countries.html |title=Khouri: Tunisia is Gdansk shipyard of â80 with Jazeera as megaphone to other Arab countries! |publisher=Mondoweiss.net |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Roger Cohen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/18/opinion/18iht-edcohen18.html | title = The Arab Gdansk | accessdate=28 January 2011 | author=Roger Cohen |work=New York Times | date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larbi Sadiki]] suggested that despite &quot;conventional wisdom has it that 'terror' in the Arab world is monopolised by al-Qaeda in its various incarnations&quot; there was also the practice of &quot;regimes in countries like Tunisia and Algeria [that] have been arming and training security apparatuses to fight Osama bin Laden [they] were [also] caught unawares by the 'bin Laden within': the terror of marginalisation for the millions of educated youth who make up a large portion of the region's population.

If it suffers a setback we shall witness unprecedented repression by rulers struggling to maintain their absolute grip on power. Either way, a system that combined a starkly unequal distribution of wealth with the denial of freedoms has collapsed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lamis Andoni |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/2011115135046129936.html |title=To the tyrants of the Arab world... |publisher=Al Jazeera |date=16 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, [[Mark LeVine]] noted that the events in Tunisia could spiral into the rest of the [[Arab world]] as the movement was &quot;inspiring people...to take to the streets and warn their own sclerotic and autocratic leaders that they could soon face a similar fate.&quot; He then cited solidarity protests in Egypt where protesters chanted &quot;Kefaya&quot; and &quot;We are next, we are next, Ben Ali tell Mubarak he is next;&quot; and that Arab bloggers were supporting the movement in Tunisia as &quot;the African revolution commencing...the global anti-capitalist revolution.&quot; He pointed to an article in ''[[al-Nahar]]'' that talked of an &quot;inhuman globalisation&quot; that had been imposed on the Arab world, however a &quot;human&quot; nationalism had not taken place. LeVine then accused the Obama administration in the United States of double standards when Clinton was in the region meeting with political and civil society leaders, however she responded to a question about the protests saying &quot;We can't take sides,&quot; which was read as a failure to seize the &quot;reigns of history&quot; and &quot;usher in a new era&quot; to &quot;defeat the forces of extremism&quot; without the violent conflict in the Afghanistan-Pakistan area. Pointing out Clinton's remarks about regimes whose &quot;foundations are sinking into the sand&quot; and needed &quot;reform&quot;, LeVine argued that US foreign policy in the Middle East and the [[ummah|Muslim world]] was &quot;equally in danger of sinking into the sands if the President and his senior officials are not willing to get ahead of history's suddenly accelerating curve.&quot; He added, &quot;It is the US and Europe, as much as the leaders of the region, who in Clinton's words are in need of 'a real vision for that future.'&quot; Finally he said there were two scenarios that could play out: &quot;a greater democratic opening across the Arab world,&quot; or a similar situation to Algeria in the early 1990s when the [[Algerian legislative election, 1991|democratic election]] was annulled and the Algeria went into a [[Algerian Civil War|civil war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/indepth/opinion/2011/01/20111167156465567.html|title=Tunisia: How the US got it wrong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Fisk]] asked if this was &quot;The end of the age of dictators in the Arab world?&quot; and partly answered the question in saying that Arab leaders would be &quot;shaking in their boots.&quot; He also pointed out that the &quot;despot&quot; Ben Ali sought refuge in the same place as the ousted [[Idi Amin]] of [[Uganda]] and that &quot;the French and the Germans and the Brits, dare we mention this, always praised the dictator for being a 'friend' of civilised Europe, keeping a firm hand on all those Islamists.&quot; He notably pointed at the &quot;demographic explosion of youth&quot; of the Maghreb, though he said that the change brought about in Tunisia may not last as: &quot;For I fear this is going to be the same old story. Yes, we would like a democracy in Tunisia â but not too much democracy. Remember how we wanted Algeria to have a democracy back in the early Nineties? Then when it looked like the Islamists might win the second round of voting, we supported its military-backed government in suspending elections and crushing the Islamists and initiating a civil war in which 150,000 died. No, in the Arab world, we want law and order and stability.&quot; He added that &quot;If it can happen in the holiday destination Tunisia, it can happen anywhere, can't it?&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;britian&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/the-brutal-truth-about-tunisia-2186287.html|title=The brutal truth about Tunisia|publisher=The Independent | location=London|first=Robert|last=Fisk|date=17 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blake Hounshell wrote on Foreign Policy.com that the Tunisian precedent raised the prospect of a &quot;new trend. There is something horrifying and, in a way, moving about these suicide attempts. It's a shocking, desperate tactic that instantly attracts attention, revulsion, but also sympathy.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

===Impact of the internet===
{{see|Human impact of Internet use#Internet and political revolutions}}

The use of communication technologies, and the Internet in particular, has been widely credited as contributor to the mobilisation of protests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/ Threat Level]&lt;/ref&gt; A blog associated with ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' described the intricate efforts of the Tunisian authorities to control such online media as&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2011/01/tunisia/|title=Tweeting Tyrants Out of Tunisia: Global Internet at Its Best|publisher=Threat Level / Wired}}&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter and Facebook. Other regional regimes were also on higher alert to contain spillover effects that may ensue.

On 11 March 2011, [[Reporters Without Borders]] gave its annual award for online media freedom to the Tunisian blogging group Nawaat.org. Founded in 2004, it played an important role rallying anti-government protesters by reporting on the protests which the national media ignored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5jn6P6Y2M4esLbvifHY0Foqb2vQTA?docId=361d3296b81a471bbfffeccbe1202202 Tunisian bloggers win online media award], [[Associated Press|AP]], 11 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; changes are coming.

Bouazizi's actions have resonated across the region &quot;There is great interest. The Egyptian people and the Egyptian public have been following the events in Tunisia with so much joy, since they can draw parallels between the Tunisian situation and their own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Westcott |first=Kathryn |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-12206551 |title=Why do people set themselves on fire? |publisher=BBC News |date=18 January 2011 |accessdate=26 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An economic analyst also suggested instability could spread to [[Libya]] and [[Saudi Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-28/crude-oil-climbs-from-eight-week-low-in-new-york-as-u-s-economy-expands.html Oil Rises Most Since 2009 on Concern Egyptian Unrest to Spread] Bloomberg, 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; An analyst on [[Al Jazeera]] added [[Algeria]] as well and cited Western concerns as their intelligence bureaus base large parts of their Arab networks in Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;Breaking News. Al Jazeera English. 28 January 2010. 11:30 Egypt time.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a financial analyst in [[Dubai]] suggested that &quot;the spillover effect of the political turbulence to the large countries in the [[Gulf Cooperation Council]] is non-existent as there are no similar driver.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hankir |first=Zahra |url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-01-30/dubai-shares-plunge-most-in-year-lead-gulf-drop-on-egypt-risk-protests.html |title=Dubai Shares Fall Most Since May on Egypt Unrest, Pacing Mideast Decline |publisher=Bloomberg |date=|accessdate=1 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the beginning of the uprising in Tunisia, similar protests took place in almost all Arab countries from [[Morocco]] to [[Iraq]], as well as in other states, ranging from [[Gabon]] to [[Albania]], Iran, [[Kazakhstan]], and [[People's Republic of China|China]]. Following [[2011 Egyptian revolution|weeks of protests]], Egyptian president [[Hosni Mubarak]] resigned on 11 February. Major protests against longtime [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] broke out on 17 February and quickly deteriorated into [[2011 Libyan civil war|civil war]], ultimately resulting in the downfall of the Gaddafi regime later in the year. In addition, [[2011 Yemeni protests|Yemen]], [[2011 Bahraini protests|Bahrain]], and [[2011 Algerian protests|Algeria]] saw major protests.
