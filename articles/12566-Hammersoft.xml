==History==
The [[Virginia General Assembly]] passed a resolution in January 1956, establishing a branch college of the [[University of Virginia]] in [[Northern Virginia]]. In September 1957 the new college opened its doors to seventeen students, all of whom enrolled as freshmen in a renovated elementary school building at [[Bailey's Crossroads]]. John Norville Gibson Finley served as Director of the new branch, which was known as University College.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/1920/2712 MARS: Photograph: J.N.G. Finley]. Hdl.handle.net (1963-12-31). Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:George Mason.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[George Mason]], (1725â1792) after whom the University is named.]]
The city of Fairfax purchased and donated {{convert|150|acre|km2}} of land to the University of Virginia for the college's new site,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.gmu.edu/resources/visitors/history.html A Brief History of George Mason University] George Mason University&lt;/ref&gt; which was referred to as the [[George Mason University Fairfax Campus|Fairfax Campus]]. In 1959, the [[Board of Visitors]] of UVA selected a permanent name for the college: George Mason College of the University of Virginia. The Fairfax campus construction planning that began in early 1960 showed visible results when the development of the first {{convert|40|acre|m2}} of Fairfax Campus began in 1962. In the Fall of 1964 the new campus welcomed 356 students.

Local jurisdictions of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], and the cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]] and [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] agreed to appropriate $3 million to purchase land adjacent to Mason to provide for a {{convert|600|acre|km2|sing=on}} Fairfax Campus in 1966 with the intention that the institution would expand into a regional university of major proportions, including the granting of graduate degrees.

On April 7, 1972 the [[Virginia General Assembly]] enacted legislation which separated George Mason College from its parent institution, the [[University of Virginia]]. Renamed that day by the legislation, George Mason College became George Mason University.

In 1978, the George Mason University Foundation purchased the former Kann's department store in Arlington. In March 1979 the Virginia General Assembly authorized the establishment of the George Mason University School of Law (GMUSL) â contingent on the transfer of the Kann's building to George Mason University. GMUSL began operations in that building on July 1, 1979 and received provisional accreditation from the American Bar Association in 1980. The ABA granted full approval to GMUSL in 1986.

Also, in 1979, the university moved all of its athletic programs to [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] Division I. Enrollment that year passed 11,000. The university opened its Arlington campus in 1982, two blocks from the [[Virginia Square-GMU (Washington Metro)|Virginia Square-GMU station]] in Arlington. In 1986 the university's governing body, the Board of Visitors, approved a new master plan for the year based on an enrollment of 20,000 full-time students with housing for 5,000 students by 1995. That same year university housing opened to bring the total number of residential students to 700.

Through a bequest of Russian immigrant Shelley Krasnow the University established the [[Krasnow Institute for Advanced Study]] in 1991. The Institute was created to further the understanding of the mind and intelligence by combining the fields of [[cognitive psychology]], [[neurobiology]], and [[artificial intelligence]]. In 1992, Mason's new Prince William Institute began classes in a temporary site in [[Manassas, Virginia]]. The Institute moved to a permanent {{convert|124|acre|km2|sing=on}} site located on the [[Virginia State Route 234|Rt. 234]] bypass, ten miles (16&amp;nbsp;km) south of Manassas, by the year 1997, and is now known as the Prince William Campus. The university graduated more than 5,000 students that following spring.

While George Mason University is young compared to established research universities in Virginia, it has grown rapidly, reaching an enrollment of 30,714 students in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2008â2009 Facts and Figures | work = www.gmu.edu | publisher = George Mason University | url = http://www2.gmu.edu/resources/visitors/masonfacts/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 2005 report issued by the university, enrollment is expected to reach 35,000 students by 2011 with more than 7,000 resident students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://research.schev.edu/enrollment/E2_Report.asp Fall Headcount Enrollment] State Council of Higher Education for Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Mason celebrated its 30th anniversary as a university by launching its first capital campaign, trying to raise $110 million. The school raised $142 million, $32 million more than its goal. The George Mason University logo, originally designed in 1982, was updated in 2004.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

In 2008, the School of Management celebrated its 30th anniversary. Also, in 2008 Mason changed its mascot from the &quot;Gunston&quot; animal to the &quot;Patriot&quot;.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Fairfax Campus===
[[Image:GeorgeMasonAcademicVI.JPG|thumb|right|280px|The Volgenau School of Engineering building.]]

The main campus of George Mason University is situated on {{convert|677|acre|km2}} just south of the [[City of Fairfax, Virginia]] in central [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]], approximately {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of [[Washington, D.C.]] The Fairfax campus is served on the [[Washington Metro]] by the [[Vienna (WMATA station)|Vienna]] station on the [[Orange Line (Washington Metro)|Orange line]]. A 15 minute shuttle in addition to the [[City-University-Energysaver|CUE]] bus, free for students with a Mason ID card, serves the students through routes from the Metro station to the University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shuttle.gmu.edu/ &quot;Mason Shuttle Services&quot;], George Mason University&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairfaxva.gov/CUEBus/CUEBus.asp &quot;Cue Bus System&quot;], City of Fairfax Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

====Design and construction====
In the early 1960s four buildings were constructed around a lawn in Fairfax, appropriately named East, West, North (later, Krug Hall), and South (later, Finley Hall). The first four structures, today dubbed &quot;The Original Four,&quot; &quot;around a lawn&quot; were understood as a clear reference to the buildings around [[The Lawn]] of the University of Virginia in [[Charlottesville, Virginia|Charlottesville]]. In addition, in the words of the architects, the architecture of the buildings was meant to reflect [[Thomas Jefferson|Jeffersonian]] influence through the use of red brick with buff colored mortar, white vertical columns, and sloped shingled roofs.

Master plans were developed to incorporate further development, which saw new additions such as Fenwick Library and Lecture Hall. By 1979 master plan development was handled by the firm of [[Hideo Sasaki|Sasaki &amp; Associates]], which continued to work alongside the university in the years that followed. Student housing first became available in 1977. The 1980s saw the university expand with a new building being added on each year, including the [[Patriot Center]]. As well as the construction of the Fairfax campuses network of hot and cold water piping that provides power efficient, centralized heating and cooling for the university's buildings.

Recent years have once again brought a new construction boom to the Fairfax campus, which is currently undergoing a massive, $900 million construction campaign (between 2002â2012) based on the 2002 University Master Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://facilities.gmu.edu/masterplans/universitymasterplan.pdf|title=Master Plan|publisher=GMU}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has brought about a huge influx of new buildings to campus, and renovations of existing buildings, most recently:

====Notable campus buildings====
=====Johnson Center=====
The George W. Johnson Learning Center, more commonly known as the Johnson Center or JC, is the central hub on campus, completed in 1995 and named after University President of 18-years, George W. Johnson. Located in the center of campus, the $30 million, {{convert|320000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building was built as the first of its kind building on any American campus, acting both as a [[library]] and a [[Student activity center|student union]]. The ground floor includes a buffet style restaurant named the Bistro, the campus radio station [[WGMU Radio]], a coffee shop named Jazzman's, 300-seat movie theater, and Dewberry Hall. The main floor includes the campus bookstore, a large food court with several fast food restaurants, a patisserie and the ground floor of the library. The second and third floors of the Johnson Center are primarily used by the library, with multiple group meeting rooms, computer labs, and a full service restaurant named George's located on the third floor.

The Johnson Center serves as the center for student life with many activities and productions sponsored by Program Board and Student Government. In 2004 during the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2004|Democratic Primaries]], Senator [[John Kerry]], the eventual Democratic Nominee for President, visited George Mason University and gave a speech on the floor of the Johnson Center. In 2007, shortly after announcing on his website that he would establish a [[Exploratory committee|presidential exploratory committee]], Senator [[Barack Obama]] gave a speech at the &quot;Yes We Can&quot; rally at the Johnson Center atrium. The next week he formally announced his intentions of running for president.

=====Center for the Arts=====
[[Image:George Mason Performing Arts.JPG|thumb|280px|right|George Mason University's Center for the Arts.]]
The Center for the Arts includes a 2,000-seat Concert Hall built in 1990. The concert hall can be converted into a more intimate 800-seat theater. Most ''Center for the Arts'' events take place here, including [[operas]], [[orchestras]], [[ballets]], and musical and theatrical performances such as [[Kid Cudi]] in 2010.

=====Patriot Center=====
The [[Patriot Center]] is a 10,000 seat arena, home court for the Men's and Women's [[George Mason Patriots|basketball]] team. The Patriot Center is also host to over 100 concerts and events throughout the year, annually attracting major performers like the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]].

=====Aquatic and Fitness Center=====
The {{convert|68000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} Aquatic and Fitness Center opened in 1998 at a cost of $11 million. The center includes an [[Olympic size swimming pool]] containing eight 50-meter lanes, twenty-two {{convert|25|yd|m|sing=on}} lanes, two movable bulkheads, and a diving area equipped with two 1-meter and two 3-meter spring boards, a Warm-water [[swimming pool|recreational pool]], Locker rooms, a [[hot tub|whirlpool]], a coed [[sauna]], and a family changing room.

[[Image:Fenwick 2007.jpg|thumb|280px|left|Fenwick Library]]

=====Fenwick Library=====
Fenwick Library was originally built in 1967, with additions in 1974, a tower in 1983, and renovations in 2005â2006. It was named for Charles Rogers Fenwick, one of George Mason's founders. Fenwick Library is the main [[research library]] at George Mason. Its resources include: most of the university's books, microfilms, print and bound journals, government documents, and maps. Electronic resources include networked and stand-alone [[CD-ROM]]s, the libraries' [[OPAC|online catalog]], a number of databases available through the libraries' membership in various consortia, and [[Internet access]]. Another important collection of research materials housed in Fenwick is the Government Documents collection. This collection includes both federal and Virginia state documents. Both sets of documents contain items from the [[executive branch|administrative]], [[United States Congress|legislative]], and [[judicial branch|judicial]] branches of government, and constitute an invaluable source of primary source materials for students and faculty in [[political science]], [[Policy|public policy]], [[sociology]], [[business]] and other fields. There is also a special GIS center in Fenwick Library which conducts [[GIS]] drop-in sessions every week.

George Mason is a member of the [[Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan Area]], granting it access to resources of thirteen other libraries in the District of Columbia.

===Arlington Campus===
[[Image:Gmu law school.jpg|thumb|right|280px|The [[George Mason University School of Law]] on the Arlington campus]]
The {{convert|5.2|acre|m2|sing=on}} Arlington campus was established in 1979 by the [[Virginia General Assembly]] for the newly founded [[George Mason University School of Law|law school]]. In 1980, graduate and professional programs were also offered in the building, a converted [[Kann's]] department store. Since then the school has grown to offer a multitude of graduate degrees. In 1996, Arlington's campus began its first phase in a three phase campus redevelopment project. In 1998, Hazel Hall was completed to house the law school, the [[Mercatus Center]], and the [[Institute for Humane Studies]]. The second phase, to be completed in 2010, is underway for a {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} building named Founders Hall is to house the Schools of Public Policy, Education and Human Development, [[Information Technology]], [[Engineering]], [[Management]], the [[Institute for Conflict Analysis and Resolution]], [[Computational Science]], and the College of Visual &amp; Performing Arts and academic and student supports services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arlington.gmu.edu//newconstruction.html Arlington Campus â George Mason University].

On February 27, 2009, Mason announced they would close the Ras Al Khamimah campus at the end of the Spring 2009 semester. University Provost, [[Peter Stearns]], cited that the relationship between George Mason University and the partner foundation in RAK worked smoothly until early 2009. He explained that the foundation would be reducing the financial support as well as attempting to change the academic reporting structure. In an e-mail to students Stearns wrote, &quot;We have not been able to reach agreement with our RAK partner on a budget and administrative structure that, in our judgment, assures our ability to provide an education that meets Mason standards.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenational.ae/article/20090226/NATIONAL/302411756/0/NEWS UAE news â The National].

{{Main|George Mason Patriots}}
{{See also|George Mason Patriots men's basketball|2005â06 George Mason Patriots men's basketball team}}
The school's sports teams are called the Patriots. The university's men's and women's sports teams participate in the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]]'s [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]], and are members of the [[Colonial Athletic Association]], or CAA.

The Patriots, who had never won an NCAA tournament game before 2006, became the first team from the CAA to crash the Final Four and were the first true [[mid-major]] conference team since 1979 to do so (that year, the [[Larry Bird]]-led [[1978â79 Indiana State Sycamores men's basketball team|Indiana State Sycamores]] as a #1 seed, and the [[Penn Quakers men's basketball|Penn Quakers]] as a #9 seed both reached the Final Four).

===Fraternity and sorority life===
{{See also|List of Fraternities and Sororities at George Mason University}}
George Mason University does not have traditional Fraternity &amp; Sorority housing or a &quot;Greek row.&quot; For several years, three Panhellenic Council organizations had established &quot;Living/Learning Floors&quot; in the University Commons. [[Alpha Omicron Pi]] had a floor 2004â2010, [[Gamma Phi Beta]] had a floor 2006â2010, and [[Alpha Phi]] had a floor 2007â2010.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Officially, Mason refers to &quot;Greek Life&quot; as &quot;Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life&quot; to avoid confusion with the Hellenic Society club, a student organization focusing on the people and culture of Greece.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

Most organizations in the Interfraternity Council (IFC) and Panhellenic Council (PHC) hold one or two large charitable events each year. Most organizations in the National Pan-Hellenic Conference (NPHC) and Multicultural Greek Council (MGC) hold a series of smaller charitable events throughout the year. The NPHC is also known for its annual Step Show.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

The most well-known{{By whom|date=November 2010}} event associated with Fraternity &amp; Sorority Life on campus is held each spring and is called Greek Week. This annual event includes competitive sporting and trivia events, charitable fund raising, and is usually ended with Greek Sing. Organizations participating in Greek Sing put together 10â15 minute themed shows which have included extravagant costumes, set designs, lighting displays, multimedia presentations, dances, singing, acrobatics, and more.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

PHC holds a formal recruitment each fall. Informal recruitment is held in spring. Many PHC organizations also offer continuous open recruitment (or continuous open bidding) after the designated recruitment period. IFC has a designated one-week rush period in the fall and spring. This week is regulated and monitored, but participants are not registered or tracked.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}
