'''Highway 39''' is a very minor 29&amp;nbsp;km (19&amp;nbsp;mi) long spur from the [[British Columbia Highway 97|John Hart Highway]] northwest to the town of [[Mackenzie, British Columbia|Mackenzie]], near the southern arm of [[Williston Lake]].  Highway 39 and the town of Mackenzie were both built in the 1960s as a measure of support for workers on the construction project of the [[W. A. C. Bennett Dam|W.&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;nbsp;C.&amp;nbsp;Bennett Dam]] (which actually is not on the same arm of Williston Lake as Mackenzie).  The road did not gain its '39' designation, however, until 1975.
