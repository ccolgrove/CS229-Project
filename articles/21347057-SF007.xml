A '''Unix-like''' (sometimes referred to as '''UN*X''' or '''*nix''') [[operating system]] is one that behaves in a manner similar to a [[Unix]] system, while not necessarily conforming to or being certified to any version of the [[Single UNIX Specification]].

There is no [[Technical standard|standard]] for defining the term, and some difference of opinion is possible as to the degree to which a given OS is &quot;Unix-like&quot;.

The term can include [[free and open source software|free and open source]] operating systems inspired by [[Bell Labs]]â Unix or designed to emulate its features, commercial and proprietary work-alikes, and even versions based on the [[software license|licensed]] UNIX source code (which may be sufficiently &quot;Unix-like&quot; to pass certification and bear the &quot;UNIX&quot; trademark).

== Definition ==

[[The Open Group]] owns the [[UNIX]] [[trademark]] and administers the Single UNIX Specification, with the &quot;UNIX&quot; name being used as a [[certification mark]].  They do not approve of the construction &quot;Unix-like&quot;, and consider it a misuse of their trademark.  Their guidelines require &quot;UNIX&quot; to be presented in uppercase or otherwise distinguished from the surrounding text, strongly encourage using it as a branding adjective for a generic word such as &quot;system&quot;, and discourage its use in hyphenated phrases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/tm-guidelines.htm Trademark Guidelines] The Open Group.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other parties frequently treat &quot;Unix&quot; as a [[genericized trademark]]. Some add a [[wildcard character]] to the name to make a [[euphemism|euphemistic]] abbreviation like  &quot;Un*x&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;jargonfile_UNasteriskX&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=UN*X|url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/U/UN-asterisk-X.html|accessdate=2009-01-22|author=[[Eric S. Raymond]]|coauthors=[[Guy L. Steele Jr.]]|work=[[The Jargon File]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;*nix&quot;, since Unix-like systems often have Unix-like names such as [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[Linux]], [[Minix]], [[Ultrix]], and [[Xenix]].  These patterns do not literally match many system names, but are still generally recognized to refer to any UNIX descendant or work-alike system, even those with completely dissimilar names such as [[Solaris Operating System|Solaris]] or [[FreeBSD]]. 

In 2007, [[Wayne R. Gray]] sued to dispute the status of UNIX as a trademark, but lost his case, and lost again on appeal.

Also in 2007, the Open Group reached a binding legal agreement to prevent the German [[University of Kassel]] from using &quot;UNIK&quot; as its short form name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uni-kassel.de/presse/publik/07_03/s1.pdf Publik, Kasseler Hochschulzeitung] Nummer 3, 17 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Ref improve section|date=April 2010}}

&quot;Unix-like&quot; systems started to appear in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Many [[proprietary software|proprietary]] versions, such as [[Idris (operating system)|Idris]] (1978), [[UNOS (operating system)|UNOS]]  (1982), [[Coherent (operating system)|Coherent]] (1983), and [[UniFlex]] (1985), aimed to provide businesses with the functionality available to academic users of UNIX.

When AT&amp;T later allowed commercial licensing of UNIX in the 1980s, a variety of proprietary systems were developed based on it, including [[AIX operating system|AIX]], [[HP-UX]], [[IRIX]], [[SunOS]], [[Tru64]], [[Ultrix]], and [[Xenix]].  These largely displaced the proprietary clones.  Growing incompatibility between these systems led to the creation of interoperability standards, including [[POSIX]] and the [[Single UNIX Specification]].

Meanwhile, the [[GNU Project]] was launched in 1983 with the goal of making [[GNU]], an operating system which all computer users could freely use, study, modify, and redistribute. Various &quot;Unix-like&quot; operating systems developed alongside GNU, frequently sharing substantial components with it (leading to some disagreement about whether they should be called &quot;GNU&quot; or not).  These primarily served as low-cost and unrestricted substitutes for UNIX, and include [[Berkeley Software Distribution|4.4BSD]], [[Linux]], and [[Minix]].  Some of these have in turn been the basis for commercial &quot;Unix-like&quot; systems, such as [[BSD/OS]] and [[Mac OS X]]. Notably, [[Mac OS X 10.5]] and [[Mac OS X 10.6]] running on Intel Macs are certified under the Single UNIX Specification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opengroup.org/openbrand/register/ Register of Open Branded Products] The Open Group&lt;/ref&gt;

The various BSD variants are notable in that they are in fact descendants of UNIX, developed by the University of California at Berkeley with UNIX source code from Bell Labs.  However, the BSD code base has evolved since then, replacing all of the AT&amp;T code. Since the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variants are not certified as compliant with the Single UNIX Specification (except for Mac OS X 10.5 Leopard and Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard), they are referred to as &quot;UNIX-like&quot;.

== Categories ==

[[Dennis Ritchie]], one of the original creators of Unix, has expressed his opinion that Unix-like systems such as [[Linux]] are ''[[de facto]]'' Unix systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/July1999/article79.html Interview with Dennis M. Ritchie] Manuel Benet, ''LinuxFocus'', July 1999&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eric S. Raymond]] and Rob Langley have suggested&lt;ref&gt;[http://catb.org/~esr/hackerlore/sco-vs-ibm.html#id305450 The meaning of 'Unix'] Eric Raymond and Rob Langley, ''OSI Position Paper on the SCO-vs.-IBM Complaint''&lt;/ref&gt; that there are three kinds of Unix-like systems:

;Genetic UNIX: Those systems with a historical connection to the [[AT&amp;T]] codebase. Most (but not all) commercial UNIX systems fall into this category. So do the [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] systems, which are descendants of work done at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in the late 1970s and early 1980s. Some of these systems have no original AT&amp;T code but can still trace their ancestry to AT&amp;T designs.
;Trademark or Branded UNIX: These systemsâlargely commercial in natureâhave been determined by the [[Open Group]] to meet the [[Single UNIX Specification]] and are allowed to carry the UNIX name. Most such systems are commercial derivatives of the [[System V]] code base in one form or another, although Apple [[Mac OS X]] [[Mac OS X Leopard|10.5]] and later is a [[Berkeley Software Distribution|BSD]] variant, and has been certified, and a few certified systems (such as IBM [[z/OS]]) earned the trademark through a [[POSIX]] [[compatibility layer]] and are not otherwise inherently Unix systems.  Many [[ancient UNIX]] systems no longer meet this definition.
;Functional UNIX: Broadly, any Unix-like system that behaves in a manner roughly consistent with the UNIX specification; more specifically, this can refer to systems such as [[Linux]] or [[Minix]] that behave similarly to a UNIX system but have no genetic or trademark connection to the AT&amp;T code base. Most free/open-source implementations of the UNIX design, whether genetic UNIX or not, fall into the restricted definition of this third category due to the expense of obtaining Open Group certification, which costs thousands of dollars, not being commercially necessary.

==Compatibility layers==

Some non-Unix-like operating systems provide a Unix-like [[compatibility layer]], with variable degrees of Unix-like functionality.

*IBM [[z/OS]]'s POSIX compatibility layer is sufficiently complete to be certified as trademark UNIX.
*[[Cygwin]] and [[MSYS]] both provide a reasonably complete [[GNU]] environment, sufficient for most common [[open source]] software to be compiled and run, with some emulation of [[Linux]], on top of the [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Windows API|user API]].
*[[Interix]] provides Unix-like functionality as a [[Windows NT]] [[Architecture of Windows NT|subsystem]].
