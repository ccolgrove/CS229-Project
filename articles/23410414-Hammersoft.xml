'''Religious texts''', also known as '''scripture''', '''scriptures''', '''holy writ''', or '''holy books''', are the texts which various religious traditions consider to be [[sacred]], or of central importance to their religious tradition. Many [[religion]]s and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] movements believe that their sacred texts are [[divinity|divinely]] or [[supernatural]]ly [[revelation|revealed or inspired]].

== History of religious texts ==
{{See also|history of religion|timeline of religion|history of writing}}
The oldest known religious texts are [[Pyramid texts]] of [[Ancient Egypt]] that date to 2400-2300 BCE.  The earliest form of the Phoenician alphabet found to date is the inscription on the sarcophagus of King [[Ahiram]] of [[Byblos]]. ( The Sumerian Temple Hymns  &lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books/about/Princess_priestess_poet.html?id=X3ALAQAAMAAJ&lt;/ref&gt;). The [[Epic of Gilgamesh]] from [[Sumer]]ia is also one of the earliest literary works dating to 2150-2000 BCE, that includes various [[mythological]] figures. The [[Rigveda]] of [[Hinduism]] is proposed to have been composed between 1700â1100 BCE&lt;ref&gt;The oldest mention of Rigveda in other sources dates from 600 BCE, and the oldest available text from 1,200 CE. Oberlies (1998:155) gives an estimate of 1100 BCE for the youngest hymns in book 10. Estimates for a ''terminus post quem'' of the earliest hymns are far more uncertain. Oberlies (p. 158) based on 'cumulative evidence' sets wide range of 1700â1100. The [[Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture|EIEC]] (s.v. [[Indo-Iranian languages]], p. 306) gives 1500â1000. It is certain that the hymns post-date [[Proto-Indo-Iranian|Indo-Iranian]] separation of ca. 2000 BC and probably that of the Indo-Aryan Mitanni documents of c. 1400 BCE. Philological estimates tend to date the bulk of the text to the second half of the second millennium. Compare [[Max MÃ¼ller]]'s statement &quot;the hymns men of the Rig-Veda are said to date from 1500 B.C.&quot; ('Veda and Vedanta', 7th lecture in ''India: What Can It Teach Us: A Course of Lectures Delivered Before the University of Cambridge'', World Treasures of the Library of Congress Beginnings by Irene U. Chambers, Michael S. Roth. Some writers out of the mainstream claim to trace [[archaeoastronomy|astronomical references]] in the Rigveda, dating it to as early as 4000 BC, a date corresponding to the Neolithic [[Mehrgarh#Mehrgarh Period II and Period III|late Mehrgarh culture]]; summarized by [[Klaus Klostermaier]] in a [http://content.iskcon.com/icj/6_1/6_1klostermaier.html 1998 presentation]{{Dead link|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it possibly the world's oldest religious text still in use. The oldest portions of the [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[Avesta]] are believed to have been transmitted orally for centuries before they found written form, and although widely differing dates for ''Gathic'' [[Avestan language|Avestan]] (the language of the oldest texts) have been proposed, scholarly consensus floats at around 1000 BCE.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

The majority of scholars agree that the [[Torah]]'s composition took place over centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Dkr7rVd3hAQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Reading+the+Pentateuch:+a+historical+introduction#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=McDermott, John J., &quot;Reading the Pentateuch: a historical introduction&quot; (Pauline Press, 2002)p.21 |publisher=Books.google.com.au |date= 2002-10|accessdate=2010-10-03|isbn=9780809140824}}&lt;/ref&gt; From the late 19th century there was a general consensus around the [[documentary hypothesis]], which suggests that the five books were created c.450 BCE by combining four originally independent sources, known as the [[Jahwist]], or J (about 900 BCE), the [[Elohist]], or E (about 800 BCE), the [[Deuteronomist]], or D, (about 600 BCE), and the [[Priestly source]], or P (about 500 BC).&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Wenham]], &quot;[http://www.biblicalstudies.org.uk/article_pentateuch_wenham.html Pentateuchal Studies Today],&quot; ''[[Themelios]]'' 22.1 (October 1996): 3-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first scripture printed for wide distribution to the masses was [[The Diamond Sutra]], a [[Buddhist]] scripture, and is the earliest recorded example of a dated printed text, bearing the Chinese calendar date for 11 May 868 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/themes/landmarks/diamondsutra.html British Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Views ==
Attitudes to sacred texts differ. Some religions make written texts widely and freely available, while others hold that sacred secrets must remain hidden from all but the loyal and the initiate. Most religions promulgate policies defining the limits of the sacred texts and controlling or forbidding changes and additions. Some religions view their sacred texts as the &quot;Word of God&quot;, often contending that the texts are inspired by [[God]] and as such not open to alteration. Translations of texts may receive official blessing, but an original sacred language often has ''de facto'', absolute or exclusive paramountcy. Some religions make texts available free or in subsidized form; others require payment and the strict observance of copyright.

References to scriptures profit from standardisation: the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] (of [[Sikhism]]) always appears with standardised page numbering while many other religions (including the [[Abrahamic religion]]s and their offshoots) favour chapter and verse pointers.

== Other terms ==
Terms like &quot;Holy Writ&quot;, &quot;Holy Scripture&quot; or &quot;Sacred Scripture&quot; are often used by adherents to describe the canonical works of their religion to denote the text's importance, its status as divine [[revelation]], or, as in the case of many Christian groups, its complete [[inerrancy]]. Christianity is not alone in using this terminology to revere its sacred book; Islam holds the [[Qur'an]] in similar esteem, as does Hinduism the [[Vedas]] and [[Bhagavad Gita]] and Buddhism the [[SÅ«tra|sutras]].

== Hierographology ==
Hierographology ([[Ancient Greek]]: á¼±ÎµÏÏÏ, hieros, &quot;sacred&quot; or &quot;holy&quot;, + Î³ÏÎ±ÏÎ®, graphe, &quot;writing&quot;, + Î»ÏÎ³Î¿Ï, logos, &quot;word&quot; or &quot;reason&quot;) ([[archaism|archaically]] also '[[hierology (textual criticism)|hierology]]') is the study of sacred texts.

Increasingly, sacred texts of many cultures are studied within academic contexts, primarily to increase understanding of other [[culture]]s, whether ancient or contemporary. Sometimes this involves the extension of the principles of [[higher criticism]] to the texts of many faiths. It may also involve a [[comparative religion|comparative study]] of religious texts. The hierographology of the [[Qur'an]] can be particularly controversial, especially when questioning the accuracy of [[Origin and development of the Qur'an|Islamic traditions]] about the text.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}
