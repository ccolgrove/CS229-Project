The '''Irish general election of 1961''' was held on 4 October 1961, just over three weeks after the [[Dissolution of Parliament|dissolution]] of the DÃ¡il on 8 September. The newly elected [[members of the 17th DÃ¡il]] assembled at [[Leinster House]] on 11 October when the new [[Taoiseach]] and [[Government of Ireland|government]] were appointed.

The general election took place in [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|38 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for 144 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[DÃ¡il Ãireann]] which had been reduced in size by three seats from the previous election.

==Campaign==
The general election of 1961 saw the three main parties being led by three new leaders. [[SeÃ¡n Lemass]] had taken charge of [[Fianna FÃ¡il]] in 1959. It was also the first time Fianna FÃ¡il faced a general election campaign without [[Ãamon de Valera]]. [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]] took over at [[Fine Gael]] in 1959 also, while the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] was now under the leadership of [[Brendan Corish]].

While the election was caused by the &quot;crisis&quot; surrounding [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s application for membership of the [[European Economic Community]] and various other international affairs, little attention was paid to these matters during the campaign. While the 1961 general election has become known as the dullest campaign on record, with the most important issue being the teaching of the [[Irish language]] in schools. Fianna FÃ¡il were fighting the election on their record in government and a reforming theme, Fine Gael presented itself as the party of free enterprise. The Labour Party campaigned strongly against the &quot;conservative&quot; Fianna FÃ¡il and Fine Gael parties. It also favoured major expansion in the public sector. It was the first and only general election for the new [[National Progressive Democrats]] party led by [[NoÃ«l Browne]].
