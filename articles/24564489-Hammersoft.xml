'''''The Best Collection I''''' is Hurd's debut album. Recorded between the years of 1993-1995, and released along with'' [[Hurd discography#The Best Collection II|The Best Collection II]]'', it is considered to be one of the first heavy metal albums in Mongolian music history. It contains such hit songs as ''ChimeegÃ¼i irekh durlal'', ''Saikhan bÃ¼sgÃ¼i'' and ''Eejdee'', which are hugely popular among Mongolian music lovers, and are frequently included in the live set.

5 songs from ''The Best Collection I'' were re-arranged and played acoustically during the 1998 [[Unplugged (Hurd album)|Unplugged]] concert.

Hurd released their first [[music video]] for ''Chono'', where the band is seen playing the song near an abandoned factory. It also contains numerous battle scenes from a 1945 movie about [[Choghtu Khong Tayiji|Tsogt Taij]]. It is told that the band members grew quickly tired and behaved impatiently during the filming, as they were not yet familiar with the process. 

Mongolian traditional music instruments were used for the recording of ''Bakharkhal'', most notably the [[Morin khuur]]. This song is among the first in a long list of patriotic songs written by Hurd.

'''''The Best Collection II''''' is Hurd's second studio album. It was recorded and released in conjunction with [[Hurd discography#The Best Collection I|The Best Collection I]], and as a result the two albums are sometimes seen together as a double album.

Compared to its counterpart, the style and lyrical theme of ''The Best Collection II'' is somewhat darker (dealing with night, darkness, fear, cemetery, ...), and the songs are rather fast paced, with ''Khar darsan zÃ¼Ã¼d'' being one of the fastest songs in Hurd's repertoire.

The hugely successful ''Tsergiin bodol'' (&quot;Soldier's Thoughts&quot;) is considered a classic and allowed the band to reach celebrity. The song was written by [[Dambyn Ganbold]], while he was in military service, his fellow soldiers helping him up on the lyrics.

It is told that, during a performance in an all-star concert, Hurd had a 3 song setlist that included ''Tsergiin bodol'', but under popular demand they ended up playing the song three times in a row. Other famous songs from the album include ''Baga nas'', ''Zurag shig bÃ¼sgÃ¼i'' and ''Nulimsaa tevch'ye''.

Hurd's 1998 [[Unplugged (Hurd album)|Unplugged]] [[acoustic music|acoustic]] concert includes no less than 8 songs from ''The Best Collection II''.

With a few modifications, the melody in &quot;Sokhor Nomin&quot; was later reused in 2001's &quot;Ueg Sons&quot; (from ''Myangan Jild Gants''.

'''''Myangan Jild Gants''''' ({{lang-mn|ÐÑÐ½Ð³Ð°Ð½ Ð¶Ð¸Ð»Ð´ Ð³Ð°Ð½Ñ}}, &quot;once in a thousand years&quot;) is Hurd's fourth studio album.

In this album, besides their usual [[Ballad#Pop_and_rock_ballads|rock ballads]] and [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]] songs, Hurd has made their first attempts of writing [[nu metal]] material. That can be attested by such songs as ''Ãg sons'' or ''Gar utas'', as some of the singing is [[Rapping|rapped]] and there is some use of [[Turntablism|turntables]].

''Gar Utas'' (Mobile phone)'s theme is about mobile phones.

''Khelekh n' khegjÃ¼Ã¼n'' is the fastest and also the shortest song in all of Hurd's catalog.

'''''Mongold TÃ¶rsÃ¶n''''' ({{lang-mn|ÐÐ¾Ð½Ð³Ð¾Ð»Ð´ ÑÓ©ÑÑÓ©Ð½}}, &quot;born in Mongolia&quot;) is Hurd's fifth studio album.

According to the bands comments in the [[Enhanced CD]] section, they wanted to make a softer sounding album and try out different [[rock music]] genres. For the first time, Hurd has written songs in [[rock and roll]] style. Also notable is the collaboration with [[hip-hop]] artists [[Ice Top]], [[Digital (band)|Digital]] and [[2 Khuu|2 KhÃ¼Ã¼]] on ''Sain muu''. ''Nutag min' Ã¼nertdeg'' features two famious [[mongolian wrestling]] champions G.ÃsÃ¶khbayar and D.MÃ¶nkh-Erdene.

The band also comments that ''Mongold TÃ¶rsÃ¶n'' was specially dedicated to all the mongolians living abroad. Indeed, the [[Concept album|overarching theme]] of the album is family, [[homeland]], and [[Nationalism|national pride]].

In 2004, Hurd's tour supporting ''Mongold TÃ¶rsÃ¶n'' in [[Inner Mongolia]] was cancelled, as reportedly the Chinese authorities feared [[civil disorder|civil unrest]].
