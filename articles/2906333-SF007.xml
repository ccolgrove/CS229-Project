'''Edubuntu''', also previously known as '''Ubuntu Education Edition''', is an official derivative of the [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] [[operating system]] designed for use in [[classroom]]s inside [[school]]s, [[home]]s and [[communities]].

Edubuntu has been developed in collaboration with teachers and technologists in multiple countries. Edubuntu is built on top of the Ubuntu base, incorporates the [[Linux Terminal Server Project|LTSP]] [[thin client]] architecture and several education-specific applications, and is aimed at users aged 6 to 18. It is designed for easy installation and ongoing system maintenance.

== Features ==
Included with Edubuntu is the [[Linux Terminal Server Project]], a large number of educational applications including [[GCompris]], [[KDE Edutainment Project|KDE Edutainment Suite]], Sabayon Profile Manager, Pessulus Lockdown Editor, Edubuntu Menueditor, OpenOffice.org, Gnome Nanny and iTalc as well as many more. Edubuntu CDs were previously available for free through their ''Shipit'' service. However, as of version 8.10, it is only available as a download in a DVD format. 

Edubuntu's default [[Graphical User Interface|GUI]] is [[GNOME]], but since release 7.10, [[KDE]] is also available as Edubuntu KDE. Since Ubuntu 10.04, the Edubuntu community has also worked &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Qimo 2.0 is now available |url=http://www.qimo4kids.com/post/Qimo-20-is-now-available!.aspx |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[Qimo 4 Kids]] project to provide a Qimo desktop that is [[Xfce]] based.

== Project goals ==
The primary goal of Edubuntu is to enable an educator with limited technical knowledge and skills to set up a computer lab or an on-line learning environment in an hour or less and then effectively administer that environment.

The principal design goals of Edubuntu are centralized management of configuration, users and processes, together with facilities for working collaboratively in a classroom setting. Equally important is the gathering together of the best available free software and digital materials for education. According to a statement of goals on the official Edubuntu Website: &quot;Our aim is to put together a system that contains all the best free software available in education and make it easy to install and maintain.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edubuntu.org/about|title=&quot;About Edubuntu&quot;|accessdate=16 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also aims to allow low income environments to maximize their available (older) equipment.

== Versions ==
[[Image:Edubuntu 7.04.jpg|thumb|120px|Edubuntu 7.04 package]]
The first Edubuntu release coincided with the release of Ubuntu 5.10, which was codenamed ''Breezy Badger'' on 2005-10-13. With the 8.04 Hardy Heron release of Edubuntu it was given the name of '''Ubuntu Education Edition'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ubuntu Education Edition 8.04 Released |url=http://www.edubuntu.org/news/8.04-release |accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was changed to be an add-on to a standard Ubuntu installation instead of being an installable [[LiveCD]]. From version 9.10 onwards, Edubuntu changed to be available as a full system DVD instead of an Add-on CD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edubuntu 9.10 Release Announcement |url=http://www.edubuntu.org/news/9.10-release |accessdate=2009-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Edubuntu is also installable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Edubuntu Packages Downloads |url=http://edubuntu.org/download |accessdate=2010-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; via a selection of &quot;edubuntu&quot; packages for all distributions using the official Ubuntu repositories ([[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] and [[Kubuntu]] mainly).
==Usage==
The [[Republic of Macedonia]] is using Edubuntu in all primary and secondary schools. The program, called ''Computer for every child'', was started in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Every Student in the Republic of Macedonia to Use Ubuntu-Powered Computer Workstations |url=http://www.ubuntu.com/news/macedonia-school-computers |accessdate=2007-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
