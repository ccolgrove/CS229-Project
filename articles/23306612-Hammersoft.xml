His father died when he was still at a young age. Cole attended [[Terry Sanford High School]] in Fayetteville and graduated in 2003. He decided that he had a better chance of getting signed in [[New York City]], so he chose to attend [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]] on an academic scholarship where he majored in communication and minored in business, graduating ''[[magna cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;German Rhymes&quot; &gt;{{cite web|last=GermanRhymes|first=GermanRhymes|title=GermanRhymes.de - Interview with J.

===Career beginnings===
J. Cole started rapping at the age of 14 when Don Juan Brown put him on the rap game and his cousin showed him the basics of rhyming and word play. Inspired mostly by rappers [[Canibus]] and [[Tupac Shakur]], Cole developed a love for telling stories in his lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rapbasement.com/j-cole/051810-j-cole-says-he-was-inspired-by-eminem-and-canibus-in-his-early-days-watch-here-click-now.html J Cole Inspired By Eminem &amp; Canibus (Video)] RapBasement&lt;/ref&gt; At age 15, J. Cole had notebooks filled with rhymes, but no beats of his own to record them with. His mother bought him an 808 beat machine so he could produce music himself.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} By the age of 17, he was posting songs on various [[internet forum]]s under the moniker &quot;Therapist&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lattisawtapes.com/2011/05/j-cole-aka-therapist.html/ J COLE: Bref Control , May 2011]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; J. Cole stood outside of Jay-Zâs place of business for three hours in order to give him a beat he sampled by Idris Muhammad, so that his mentor-to-be could use it. However, when Jay-Z came out of his building he shunned the up-and-coming rapper.&lt;ref name=NardwuarServiette&gt;{{cite web|last=NardwuarServiette|first=NardwuarServiette|title=Nardwuar vs. J.

Cole was signed to Roc Nation, he worked a job as a bill collector. One morning, he turned on his cell phone and noticed that he received a text from an associate asking him to call the associate back. When Cole returned the call, the associate informed Cole that he received a call from Jay-Zâs associates and that he had to meet with them as soon as possible. &lt;ref name=GrimeDaily&gt;{{cite web|last=GrimeDaily|first=GrimeDaily|title=GRIME DAILY MEETS J.
