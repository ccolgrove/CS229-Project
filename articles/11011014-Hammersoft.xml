'''WAOR''' (95.7 FM) is a [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[classic rock]] format.  Licensed to [[Nappanee, Indiana]], WAOR serves the [[South Bend, Indiana]] market.

==History==
95.7 signed on as '''WLRX''' on December 16, 1991 (the calls for the construction permit granted in [[1990]] had been '''WXJG''', but the station was never on the air with those calls).  WLRX broadcast [[Citadel Media|ABC Radio]]/[[Satellite Music Network|SMN]]'s [[Hits &amp; Favorites|StarStation]] [[adult contemporary]] format serving the Nappanee area under the name &quot;Star 96,&quot; then segued to a [[Hot AC]] direction with local DJs as &quot;Magic 95.7&quot; and broadened its focus to include South Bend and Elkhart.  It was during this time the station also changed hands from Indiana Star Broadcasting to Service Communications of South Bend.  Service was purchased by Talking Stick which is now a part of the Federated Communications of Elkhart umbrella.  At Midnight on February 4, 2005 the station adopted an Urban Contemporary format and took the call letters '''WYPW''', which it held until it adopted its current format and call letters in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;radioinfo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radio-info.com/news/fm-talk-comes-to-south-bend-with-a-power-outage-at-957|title=FM talk comes to South Bend, with a &quot;Power&quot; outage at 95.7|date=April 16, 2010|work=Radio-Info.com|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WAOR callsign and classic rock format were originally at 95.3, but moved to 95.7 FM on May 10, 2010 replacing the [[rhythmic contemporary]] format of WYPW.  At that time 95.3 was relaunched as [[WTRC]] &quot;Michiana's News Channel&quot;, a [[Talk radio|news/talk]] station that took ''[[The Rush Limbaugh Show]]'', ''[[The Glenn Beck Program]]'', and [[Fox News Radio]] from rival [[WSBT (AM)|WSBT]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sbt-953talk&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.southbendtribune.com/article/20100414/Biz/100419716/1129/News|title=Michiana radio stations to see talk shows, program formats shifting|last=Meenan|first=Jim|date=April 14, 2010|work=[[South Bend Tribune]]|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
