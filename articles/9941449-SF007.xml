'''GAG''' ('''G'''estor de '''A'''rranque '''G'''rÃ¡fico, English: &quot;Graphical Boot Manager&quot;) is a GNU GPL [[boot loader]] for [[x86]] computers. It doesn't need its own [[Disk partitioning|partition]] â it installs directly to the [[boot sector]] of [[Hard disk]] or [[floppy disk]] which allows it to survive to repartitioning or formatting. It is distributed as a bootable disk image, which makes it fully [[operating system]]-independent. It can be installed from a [[CD-ROM]] or from a linux terminal too (this last method allows to install it in a USB pendrive).

GAG works on x86 processor with standard [[VGA]] graphic adapter or compatible (it can't be properly run under [[Hercules Graphics Card|Hercules]], [[Color Graphics Adapter|CGA]] or [[Enhanced Graphics Adapter|EGA]]).

GAG aims to be an easy-to-use boot manager, but allows certain advanced features. It has a classic 3D-looking [[GUI]] driven by a keyboard. It allows to have up to 9 operating systems installed. Every OS (boot partition) has an icon, label and, if needed, [[password]] protection. Configuration is menu-driven, and can be protected with its own password too.

It allows to hide [[primary partition]]s (to avoid OS collisions between C:/D: primary partitions) and auto-choose using timer.

==Grub2 incompatibility==
Because GAG is a pure [[Chain_loading#Chain_loading_in_boot_manager_programs|chain loading boot loader]], it requires a kernel loader to be installed in the superblock of each bootable partition to handle the different filesystems or kernels. This means that users of [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] are required to install [[LILO]] or [[GRUB]] in the superblock of the partition in order to be able to boot from GAG; however it seems that installing [[GRUB2]] in a superblock is discouraged.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} Some people have been able to make this configuration work by running '''sudo grub-install /dev/sdXX''' (where XX represents the root partition), however it is not guaranteed to work.
