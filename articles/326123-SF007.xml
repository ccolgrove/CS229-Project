Windows 7's server counterpart, [[Windows Server 2008 R2]], was released at the same time.

Unlike Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware with which Windows Vista was already compatible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2008/10/28/windows-7-unveiled-today-at-pdc-2008.aspx|title=Windows 7 Unveiled Today at PDC 2008|last=Nash|first=Mike|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=2008-11-11|work=Windows Team Blog|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presentations given by Microsoft in 2008 focused on [[multi-touch]] support, a redesigned [[Windows shell]] with a new [[taskbar]], referred to as the Superbar, a home networking system called HomeGroup,&lt;ref name=&quot;leblanchomegroup&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2008/10/28/how-libraries-amp-homegroup-work-together-in-windows-7.aspx|title=How Libraries &amp; HomeGroup Work Together in Windows 7|last=LeBlanc|first=Brandon|date=28 October 2008|accessdate=2008-11-11|work=Windows Team Blog|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performance improvements.

[[File:Action-centre-warning.PNG|thumb|right|When the action center flag is clicked on, it lists all security issues in a small popup window]]
Windows 7 includes a number of new features, such as advances in touch and [[handwriting recognition]], support for [[VHD (file format)|virtual hard disks]], improved performance on [[multi-core]] processors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsvienna.com/windows-7-takes-more-advantage-of-multi-core-cpus-a24.html |title=Windows 7 Takes More Advantage of Multi-Core CPUs - Windows 7 |publisher=Windowsvienna.com |date= |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/microsoft/?p=1612 |title=Windows 7 to get parallel-processing tweaks &amp;#124; All about Microsoft &amp;#124; ZDNet.com |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pctipsbox.com/windows-7-to-get-parallel-processing-tweaks/ |title=Windows 7 to get parallel-processing tweaks &amp;#124; PC Tips |publisher=Pctipsbox.com |date=2008-10-05 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vista.blorge.com/2008/09/30/windows-7-enters-parallel-universe/ |title=Windows 7 enters parallel universe |publisher=Vista.Blorge |date=2008-09-30 |accessdate=2009-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; improved [[booting|boot]] performance, [[DirectAccess]], and [[kernel (computing)|kernel]] improvements. Windows 7 adds support for systems using multiple heterogeneous graphics cards from different vendors (Heterogeneous Multi-adapter), a new version of [[Windows Media Center]],&lt;ref name=&quot;tgdailym1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Wolfgang|last=Gruener|url=http://www.tgdaily.com/content/view/35641/118/|title=TG Daily&amp;nbsp;â Windows Vista successor scheduled for a H2 2009 release?|publisher=TG Daily|date=2008-01-16|accessdate=2008-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Microsoft Gadgets#Desktop gadgets|Gadget]] for Windows Media Center, improved media features, the [[XML Paper Specification|XPS]] Essentials Pack and [[Windows PowerShell]] being included, and a redesigned [[Calculator (Windows)|Calculator]] with multiline capabilities including ''Programmer'' and ''Statistics'' modes along with unit conversion for length, weight, temperature, and several others. Many new items have been added to the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]], including [[ClearType]] Text Tuner, Display Color Calibration Wizard, [[Microsoft Gadgets#Desktop gadgets|Gadgets]], Recovery, Troubleshooting, Workspaces Center, Location and Other Sensors, Credential Manager, Biometric Devices, System Icons, and Display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thinknext.net/archives/2150|title=ThinkNext.net: Screenshots from a blogger with Windows 7 M1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Windows Security Center]] has been renamed to Windows Action Center (Windows Health Center and Windows Solution Center in earlier builds), which encompasses both [[computer security|security]] and maintenance of the computer. Readyboost on 32bit editions now supports up to 256 Gigabytes of extra allocation. The default setting for [[User Account Control]] in Windows 7 has been criticized for allowing untrusted software to be launched with elevated privileges without a prompt by exploiting a trusted application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 7 also supports images in [[RAW image format]] through the addition of [[Windows Imaging Component]]-enabled image decoders, which enables raw image thumbnails, previewing and metadata display in Windows Explorer, plus full-size viewing and slideshows in Windows Photo Viewer and Windows Media Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.downloadsquad.com/2009/10/21/raw-image-support-windows/|title=How to add Mac-like RAW image support to Windows 7, Vista, XP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The taskbar has seen the biggest visual changes, where the Quick Launch toolbar has been replaced with the ability to pin applications to the taskbar. Buttons for pinned applications are integrated with the task buttons. These buttons also enable the ''Jump Lists'' feature to allow easy access to common tasks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Softpedia04Nov08&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-7-User-Interface-The-Superbar-Enhanced-Taskbar-97143.shtml|title = Windows 7 User Interface&amp;nbsp;â The Superbar (Enhanced Taskbar)|accessdate = 2008-11-12|last = Softpedia|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = November}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revamped taskbar also allows the reordering of taskbar buttons. To the far right of the system clock is a small rectangular button that serves as the ''Show desktop'' icon. This button is part of the new feature in Windows 7 called ''Aero Peek''. Hovering over this button makes all visible windows transparent for a quick look at the desktop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://money.cnn.com/news/newsfeeds/siliconalley/big-tech/2008_12_windows_7_some_minor_improvements_no_game_changer_msft.html|title=Windows 7: Some Minor Improvements, No Game Changer}}{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In touch-enabled displays such as touch screens, tablet PCs, etc., this button is slightly wider to accommodate being pressed with a finger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/25/touching-windows-7.aspx|title=Touching Windows 7 (Engineering Windows 7 Blog)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clicking this button minimizes all windows, and clicking it a second time restores them. Additionally, there is a feature named ''Aero Snap'', that automatically maximizes a window when it is dragged to the top of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/17/designing-aero-snap.aspx|title=Engineering Windows 7 : Designing Aero Snap|publisher=Steven Sinofsky/Microsoft|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dragging windows to the left/right edges of the screen allows users to snap documents or files on either side of the screen for comparison between windows, such that the windows vertically take up half the screen. When a user moves windows that were maximized using Aero Snap, the system restores their previous state automatically. This functionality is also accomplished with keyboard shortcuts.
Unlike in [[Windows Vista]], window borders and the taskbar do not turn opaque when a window is maximized with [[Windows Aero]] applied. Instead, they remain translucent.

For developers, Windows 7 includes a new networking [[API]] with support for building [[SOAP (protocol)|SOAP-based]] web services in [[machine code|native code]] (as opposed to .NET-based [[Windows Communication Foundation|WCF]] web services),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC01/|title=Windows 7: Web Services in Native Code|publisher=PDC 2008|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; new features to shorten application install times, reduced UAC prompts, simplified development of installation packages,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC42/|title=Windows 7: Deploying Your Application with Windows Installer (MSI) and ClickOnce|publisher=PDC 2008|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and improved globalization support through a new Extended Linguistic Services API.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC52/|title=Windows 7: Writing World-Ready Applications|publisher=PDC 2008|accessdate=2008-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[Windows Hardware Engineering Conference|WinHEC]] 2008 Microsoft announced that color depths of 30-bit and 48-bit would be supported in Windows 7 along with the wide color gamut [[scRGB]] (which for [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] 1.3 can be converted and output as [[xvYCC]]). The video modes supported in Windows 7 are 16-bit sRGB, 24-bit sRGB, 30-bit sRGB, 30-bit with extended color gamut sRGB, and 48-bit scRGB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/E/6/5E66B27B-988B-4F50-AF3A-C2FF1E62180F/GRA-T583_WH08.pptx |title=WinHEC 2008 GRA-583: Display Technologies |publisher=Microsoft |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2008-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-7-High-Color-Support-98741.shtml |title=Windows 7 High Color Support |publisher=Softpedia |date=2008-11-26 |accessdate=2008-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has also implemented better support for [[solid-state drive]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/05/05/support-and-q-a-for-solid-state-drives-and.aspx|title=Support and Q&amp;A for Solid-State Drives|work=Engineering Windows 7|publisher=Microsoft|date=2009-05-05|accessdate=2009-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; including the new [[TRIM (SSD command)|TRIM command]], and Windows 7 is able to identify a solid-state drive uniquely. Microsoft is planning to support [[USB 3.0]] in a subsequent patch, support not being included in the initial release due to delays in the finalization of the standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13924_3-10083822-64.html |title=Microsoft describes USB 3.0 delays |last=Crothers |first=Brooke |date=6 November 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-13 |publisher=CNet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Windows 7 Taskbar.png|thumb|800px|center|The Windows 7 taskbar]]

Internet [[Spades]], Internet [[Backgammon]] and Internet [[Checkers]], which were removed from Windows Vista, were restored in Windows 7. Windows 7 includes [[Internet Explorer 8]] and [[Windows Media Player 12]]. {{Wikinews| Windows 7 will allow users to disable Internet Explorer}}Users are also able to disable many more Windows components than was possible in Windows Vista.

===Removed features===
{{Main|List of features removed in Windows 7}}

Certain capabilities and programs that were a part of [[Windows Vista]] are no longer present or have been changed, resulting in the removal of certain functionalities. These include the classic [[Start Menu]] user interface, some [[List of features removed in Windows 7#Taskbar|taskbar features]], [[List of features removed in Windows 7#Windows Explorer|Windows Explorer features]], [[List of features removed in Windows 7#Windows Media Player features|Windows Media Player features]], [[Windows Ultimate Extras]] and [[InkBall]].

Although [[Windows Ultimate Extras]] was removed, many of the extras can be installed separately.&lt;ref name='penton-media-w7 2009-02-10'&gt;{{cite news | first = Paul   | last = Thurrott | title = No Ultimate Extras in Windows 7.

==Development==
{{Main|Development of Windows 7}}Originally, a version of Windows codenamed [[Microsoft Windows Fiji|''Blackcomb'']] was planned as the successor to [[Windows XP]] (codename [[Microsoft Windows Fiji|Whistler]]) and [[Windows Server 2003]]. Major features were planned for Blackcomb, including an emphasis on searching and querying data and an advanced storage system named [[WinFS]] to enable such scenarios. However, an interim, minor release, codenamed &quot;[[Microsoft Windows Fiji|Longhorn]],&quot; was announced for 2003, delaying the development of Blackcomb.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/10/24/gates_confirms_windows_longhorn |title=Gates confirms Windows Longhorn for 2003 |last=Lettice |first=John |date=2001-10-24 |publisher=The Register |accessdate=2008-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the middle of 2003, however, Longhorn had acquired some of the features originally intended for Blackcomb. After three major [[computer virus|viruses]] exploited flaws in Windows operating systems within a short time period in 2003, Microsoft changed its development priorities, putting some of Longhorn's major development work on hold while developing new [[service pack]]s for Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

Copies of Windows 7 build 6801 were distributed at the end of the conference; however, the demonstrated taskbar was disabled in this build.

The release candidate, build 7100, became available for MSDN and TechNet subscribers and Connect Program participants on April 30, 2009.

An estimated 1000 developers worked on Windows 7. These were broadly divided into &quot;core operating system&quot; and &quot;Windows client experience&quot;, in turn organized into 25 teams of around 40 developers on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/08/18/windows_5F00_7_5F00_team.aspx |first=Steven |last=Sinovsky |title=The Windows 7 Team |publisher=Engineering Windows 7, MSDN |date=2008-08-18 |accessdate=2009-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goals===
[[Bill Gates]], in an interview with'' [[Newsweek]]'', suggested that this version of Windows would be more &quot;user-centric&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/16934083/site/newsweek/page/4/print/1/displaymode/1098/|title=Bill Gates on Vista and Apple's 'Lying' Ads|author=Steven Levy|date= 3 February 2007}}{{dead link|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gates later said that Windows 7 would also focus on performance improvements.&lt;ref name=&quot;gates2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/05-07japanwdlc.mspx|title=Bill Gates: JapanâWindows Digital Lifestyle Consortium|author=Bill Gates|date=12 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Sinofsky]] later expanded on this point, explaining in the ''Engineering Windows 7'' blog that the company was using a variety of new tracing tools to measure the performance of many areas of the operating system on an ongoing basis, to help locate inefficient code paths and to help prevent performance regressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2008/12/15/continuing-our-discussion-on-performance.aspx |title=Continuing our discussion on performance |last=Sinofsky |first=Steven |authorlink=Steven Sinofsky |date=15 December 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-18 |work=Engineering Windows 7 |publisher=Microsoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Vice President Bill &lt;!--Do not change this to Gates. It is Veghte.--&gt;Veghte stated that [[Windows Vista]] users migrating to Windows 7 would not find the kind of device compatibility issues they encountered migrating from [[Windows XP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Windows-7-Will-Not-Inherent-the-Incompatibility-Issues-of-Vista-88625.shtml|title=Windows 7 Will Not Inherit the Incompatibility Issues of Vista|first=Marius|last=Oiaga|date=24 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking about Windows 7 on October 16, 2008, [[Microsoft]] CEO [[Steve Ballmer]] confirmed compatibility between [[Windows Vista]] and Windows 7, indicating that Windows 7 would be a refined version of Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=10464|title = Ballmer: Itâs ok to wait until Windows 7; Yahoo still âmakes senseâ; Google Apps âprimitiveâ|accessdate = 2008-10-17|last = Dignan|first = Larry|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = October}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antitrust regulatory attention{{Anchor|Criticism}}==
As with other Microsoft operating systems, Windows 7 is being studied by United States federal regulators who oversee the company's operations following the 2001 ''[[United States v. Microsoft]]'' settlement. According to status reports filed, the three-member panel began assessing prototypes of the new operating system in February 2008. [[Michael Gartenberg]], an analyst at [[Jupiter Research]] said that, &quot;[Microsoft's]&lt;!--The word &quot;Microsoft's&quot; appears in square brackets here because it was inserted into the quote to replace the unclear pronoun &quot;Their&quot; in this context. Please do not change this as it would make it look like the word &quot;Microsoft&quot; was in the original quote which is not the case.--&gt; challenge for Windows 7 will be how can they continue to add features that consumers will want that also don't run afoul of regulators.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9068339&amp;taxonomyId=14&amp;intsrc=kc_top|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080423070835/http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&amp;articleId=9068339&amp;taxonomyId=14&amp;intsrc=kc_top|archivedate = 2008-04-23|title = Windows 7 eyed by antitrust regulators|accessdate = 2008-03-19|last = Keizer|first = Gregg F.|authorlink = |year = 2008|month = March}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to comply with European antitrust regulations, Microsoft has proposed the use of a &quot;ballot&quot; screen, allowing users to download a competing browser, thus removing the need for a version of Windows completely without Internet Explorer, as previously planned.&lt;ref name=&quot;neowin-browserballot&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/07/24/microsoft-propose-browser-ballot-screen-to-the-eu|title=Microsoft proposes &quot;Browser Ballot Screen&quot; to the EU|first=Kevin|coauthors=Weiner|date=July 24, 2009|publisher=Neowin|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to criticism involving Windows 7 E and concerns from manufacturers about possible consumer confusion if a version of Windows 7 with Internet Explorer were shipped later after one without Internet Explorer, Microsoft announced that it would scrap the separate version for Europe and ship the standard upgrade and full packages worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;neowin-noE&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/news/main/09/08/01/microsoft-scraps-windows-7-e-version-for-europe|title=Microsoft scraps Windows 7 'E' version for Europe|last=Warren|first=Tom|date=August 1, 2009|publisher=Neowin|accessdate=2009-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with the previous version of Windows, an N version, which does not come with [[Windows Media Player]], has been released in Europe, but only for sale directly from Microsoft sales websites and selected others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://emea.microsoftstore.com/UK/Microsoft/Windows/Windows-7/?WT.mc_id=MSCOMUK_HomePage_Buy_Windowstab|title=Microsoft online Windows 7 store page|accessdate=2009-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hardware requirements==
[[File:WINDOWS 7 PC STICKER.svg|125px|thumb|right|Computers that contain this sticker meet the requirements for Windows 7.]]
Microsoft has published the minimum specifications for a system to run Windows 7.&lt;ref name=&quot;7requirements&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/products/system-requirements|title=Windows 7 system requirements|publisher=Microsoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; Requirements for the 32-bit version are similar to that of premium editions of Vista, but are higher for 64-bit versions. Microsoft has released an upgrade advisor that determines if a computer is compatible with Windows 7. Although the [[Nvidia]] [[GeForce FX Series|GeForce FX (5xxx) series]] graphics cards meet the minimum hardware requirement, nVidia has decided not to produce Windows 7 compatible drivers for anything below the [[GeForce 6 Series]].
