'''San Marino''' is a small, affluent city in  [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], California.  Incorporated in 1913, the City founders designed the community to be uniquely residential, with expansive properties surrounded by beautiful gardens, wide streets, and well maintained parkways.  The population was 13,147 at the 2010 census.

In 2010, [[Forbes Magazine]] ranked the city's 91108 [[ZIP code]] as the 63rd most expensive area to live in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/09/27/most-expensive-zip-codes-2010-lifestyle-real-estate-zip-codes-10-rank.html|title=Most Expensive ZIP Codes|accessdate=2010-12-15 | work=Forbes|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most homes were built between 1920 and 1950.  The [[median]] list price of a single family home is US$1,987,500, as of July 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Marino California City Guide&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pasadenaviews.com/san-marino-city-guide/ |title=San Marino California City Guide |publisher=Pasadenaviews.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Origin of name===

The city takes its name from the ancient [[Republic of San Marino]], founded by [[Saint Marinus]] who fled his home in [[Dalmatia]] (modern [[Croatia]]) at the time of the [[Diocletianic Persecution]] of Christians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cityofsanmarino.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofsanmarino.org/about.htm |title=City of San Marino, CA - About Our City |publisher=Cityofsanmarino.org |date=1917-09-09 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=K.Maskarin |url=http://www.kristofor.hr/english-marin.html |title=St. Marino, the founder of the San Marino republic - the legend, island Rab Croatia |publisher=Kristofor.hr |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marinus took refuge at [[Monte Titano]] on the Italian peninsula, where he built a chapel and founded a monastic community in 301 A.D..  The state which grew from the monastery is the world's oldest surviving republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saints.sqpn.com/saint-marinus/ |title=Blog Archive Â» Saint Marinus |publisher=Saints.SQPN.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seal of the City of San Marino, California is modeled on that of the republic, depicting [[the Three Towers of San Marino]] each capped with a bronze plume, surrounded by a heart-shaped scroll with two roundels and a lozenge (of unknown significance) at the top. The crown representing the monarchy on the original was replaced with five stars representing the five members of the City's governing body. Beneath the city's seal are crossed palm fronds and orange branches.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cityofsanmarino.org&quot;/&gt;

===Early history===

The site of San Marino was originally occupied by a village of [[Tongva people|Tongva]] (GabrieleÃ±o) Indians. The area was part of the [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel|San Gabriel Mission]]. Principal portions of San Marino were included in an 1830 Mexican land grant to SeÃ±ora Victoria Reid, a Native-American woman and the widow of [[Hugo Reid]], who called it [[Rancho Huerta de Cuati]]. In 1852, SeÃ±ora Reid deeded her rancho to [[Benjamin Davis Wilson|Don Benito Wilson]], the first [[Anglo#United States|Anglo]] owner of [[Rancho San Pascual]].  In 1873, Don Benito conveyed to his son-in-law, James DeBarth Shorb, {{convert|500|acre|km2}} which Shorb named &quot;San Marino&quot; after his grandfather's plantation in Maryland.  The site of the Shorb home is today occupied by the [[Huntington Library]].&lt;ref name=&quot;skagitriverjournal1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skagitriverjournal.com/WA/Whatcom/FairhavenSth/Harris/Dan03-Shorb2.html |title=The Shorbs of Los Angeles vs. Dan Harris, Part Two |publisher=Skagitriverjournal.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903, the Shorb estate was purchased by [[Henry E. Huntington]] (1850â1927), and in 1913 the three primary ranchos of Wilson, Patton, and Huntington, together with the subdivided areas from those and smaller ranchos, such as Stoneman, White, and Rose, were incorporated as the city of San Marino.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cityofsanmarino.org&quot;/&gt;

The first mayor of the city of San Marino was George S. Patton, Senior.   The son of a slain Civil War general, Patton graduated from the [[Virginia Military Institute]] in 1877, just before moving west. He married Ruth Wilson, the daughter of Don Benito Wilson.  Their son was the famous World War II general, [[George S. Patton|George S. Patton, Junior]].&lt;ref name=&quot;skagitriverjournal1&quot;/&gt;

To a prior generation of southern Californians, San Marino was known for its old-money wealth and as a bastion of the region's [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant|WASP]] gentry.  By mid-century, other European ethnic groups had become the majority; in recent decades, immigrants of Chinese (especially [[Taiwan]]ese) ancestry have come to represent more than half of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofsanmarino.org/faq.htm |title=City of San Marino, CA - Employment Opportunites |publisher=Cityofsanmarino.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Landmarks==
[[Image:Lightmatter huntington library.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Huntington Library, in a landscape setting by [[Beatrix Farrand]]]]
San Marino is the location of the renowned [[Huntington Library]] and gardens. In 1919 Henry Huntington provided limited access to the art collections, and to the rare books and historical documents, housed in the library and in his large [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]]-[[Palladian]] mansion, as well as to the surrounding [[botanical garden]]s, all collectively known as &quot;The Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens&quot;, or &quot;The Huntington&quot;, to the public.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huntington.org/  access date: 6/2/2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, [[The Wedding Singer]], the big wedding finale was filmed  on the grassy mall at The Huntington Library &amp; Gardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;seeing-stars1&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:El Molino Viejo (back side), San Marino.jpg|thumb|200px|left|View of the Old Mill from rear courtyard]]
[[El Molino Viejo]] (&quot;The Old Mill&quot;), completed about 1816 as a [[Gristmill|grist mill]] for [[Mission San Gabriel ArcÃ¡ngel]], is in San Marino. The original two-story structure measured {{convert|53|ft|m}} by {{convert|26|ft|m}}. It is the oldest commercial building in Southern California.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Marino California City Guide&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.old-mill.org/history.asp |title=The Old Mill ~ El Molino Viejo |publisher=Old-mill.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; The town is located on the former lands of the historic [[Rancho Huerta de Cuati]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.old-mill.org/  access date: 6/2/2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edwin Hubble House]]: From 1925 to 1953, this two story stucco home was the residence of one of America's greatest 20th-century astronomers, [[Edwin Hubble]], who, among other accomplishments, discovered extragalactic nebulae and their recession from each other.  It is a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tps.cr.nps.gov/nhl/detail.cfm?ResourceId=1603&amp;ResourceType=Building |title=National Historic Landmarks Program (NHL) |publisher=Tps.cr.nps.gov |date=1976-12-08 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Michael White Adobe House, is located on the high school campus and houses the San Marino Historical Society archives.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smnet.org/comm_group/historical/  access date: 6/2/2010&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[University of Southern California]] owns a house in San Marino which is used as the residence of the President of the University. The residence and grounds are often used for University Presidential events.

In the middle of San Marino lies [[Lacy Park]], a huge {{convert|30|acre|m2|adj=on}} expanse of lush grass and trees, rare for urban areas. Originally named Wilson Lake in 1875, the land was purchased by the city in 1925 and dedicated as a park. Families in San Marino have enjoyed the park for years, and it remains one of San Marino's best kept secrets. A picnic area is often the site of musical concerts, civic events and pancake breakfasts.  Within the park are two walking loops:  an inner loop of approximately 3/4 mile in length, and an outer loop of approximately {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} in length.  Dogs are welcome with their owners, providing they are on a leash.&lt;ref name=&quot;City of San Marino, CA - Lacy Park&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.san-marino.ca.us/lacy.htm |title=City of San Marino, CA - Lacy Park |publisher=Ci.san-marino.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The park includes six championship tennis courts and a pro shop, administered by the San Marino Tennis Foundation. At the west entrance of the park is the Rose Arbor, which is of special significance for the people of San Marino. It is sixty years old and has long been a source of beauty and tranquility to many residents. In recent years the care and upkeep of the [[Rose]] [[Pergola|Arbor]] itself has been augmented by private donations from dedicated residents who have chosen to sponsor individual posts.&lt;ref name=&quot;City of San Marino, CA - Lacy Park&quot;/&gt; The park recently built a memorial to General George S. Patton (a native of San Marino) and also a large memorial to the Armed Forces along with a statue of a sad soldier. The memorial includes the names of all military personnel from San Marino.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Marino California City Guide&quot;/&gt;

The city's local newspaper office is located in the heart of town near the city's most prominent street, Huntington Drive. &quot;The San Marino Tribune&quot; has been the official newspaper of the city since 1929. There are two sections of the weekly paper, an &quot;A&quot; section and a &quot;B&quot; section, the distinction being that it covers not only San Marino news but also the Pasadena, San Gabriel, Alhambra, Arcadia and South Pasadena news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanmarinotribune.com/ |title=San Marino |publisher=Sanmarinotribune.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==City politics==
Governing the City of San Marino is a city council of five members, elected by the people for a four-year term, at elections held in March of odd calendar years. These five Council members serve without any financial compensation and elect one of their own members as Mayor.  The current Mayor is Dr. Allan Yung.  The Vice Mayor is Dr. Richard Sun and council members are: Dennis Kneier,  Richard Ward and Eugene Sun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.san-marino.ca.us/ |title=City of San Marino, CA - Home Page |publisher=Ci.san-marino.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Marino City Council page states:
'' &quot;San Marino was formed to protect your personal rights and to control the growth and activities of the City in such a way that each individual resident will be guaranteed a pleasant place in which to live with a minimum of nuisance, with assurance that his property values will be protected by stringent zoning regulations. It is your City Council's desire to acquaint the old and new residents with the history and background of San Marino, its many advantages and some of your responsibilities as a citizen. &quot;'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ci.san-marino.ca.us/city_council.htm |title=City of San Marino, CA - City Council Page |publisher=Ci.san-marino.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This community consists only of single family residences: there are no apartment buildings, condominiums or townhouses in the city. All homes must have a 2-car garage&lt;ref name=&quot;San Marino California City Guide&quot;/&gt; No fast food or drive-through restaurants are allowed in San Marino. &quot;The responsibilities of being a citizen in San Marino are many and rules are strictly enforced.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://www.answers.com/topic/san-marino-california&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zoning==
The city is divided into seven zones, based on minimum lot size. The smallest lot size is about {{convert|4500|sqft|m2}}, with many averaging over {{convert|30000|sqft|m2}}. Because of this and other factors, most of the homes in San Marino, built between 1920 and 1950, do not resemble the houses in surrounding Southern California neighborhoods (with the exception, perhaps, of neighboring portions of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]). San Marino has also fostered a sense of historic preservation among its homeowners. With minor exceptions, the city's strict design review and zoning laws have thus far prevented the development of large homes found elsewhere in Los Angeles. No apartment buildings or townhouses exist in the city. {{Citation needed|date=November 2009}}

San Marino is located at {{Coord|34|7|22|N|118|6|47|W|city}} (34.122658, -118.112964).{{GR|1}}

==Schools==
On September 9, 1913, the first San Marino school was opened at the corner of Monterey Road, (then called Calle de Lopez) and Oak Knoll, in what was known as the Old Mayberry Home. There were  three teachers and thirty-five pupils, grades kindergarten through the eighth; High School students attended South Pasadena High until [[San Marino High School]] was founded in 1955 after 50 years of utilizing [[South Pasadena High School]] in nearby South Pasadena.  San Marino High School graduated its first class in 1956. The high school's nickname, &quot;The Titans,&quot; comes from Mt. Titano, in the Republic of San Marino.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cityofsanmarino.org&quot;/&gt;

San Marino High School is situated on the former site of Carver Elementary School.  In 1996, the high school reconstruction was begun and the school is now equipped with new laboratories, classrooms, and ethernet connections, supported mainlyly by bond issues and rigorous fund-raising by the San Marino Schools Endowment. The new buildings include a brand new cafeteria, orchestra and band room, dance studio, journalism lab, and renovated auditoriums, as well as a renovated baseball field and a brand new football field/track.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;|http://www.sanmarinohs.org/about/history.jsp&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marino High School is part of the [[San Marino Unified School District]].  Its public funding is supplemented by private donations raised through the San Marino Schools Endowment Foundation. Each year, the Foundation raises funds necessary to balance the Districtâs budget.  To date, the San Marino Schools Foundation has contributed $18,268,485 to our schools since their inception in March 1980.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

===Private schools===

*[[Southwestern Academy]], a private college preparatory school, was founded on April 7, 1924 . The campus was part of an original Spanish grant (the old ranch grew orange and avocado trees) and the land was subsequently legalized by Abraham Lincoln. âSouthwestern Academyâ was named to capture the distinctive spirit of the Southwestern United States.  Pioneer Hall, which was Southwesternâs original campus building, was the home of then Governor, George Stoneman.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;
*Saints Felicitas and Perpetua  grammar school, grades K-8.  The city took the Archdiocese of Los Angeles to the Supreme Court to block the opening of this school.  Saints Felicitas &amp; Perpetua School was completed and dedicated in 1950.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

==City services==
When the City of San Marino was first incorporated in 1913 it did not have its own police department.  During its early years, the only police protection deemed necessary was a City Marshal.  However, as the City began to grow and crime made its way into the community, two deputy City Marshals were added in October 1918.   In 1924, then Deputy Marshal Ben Parker was appointed the Cities first police chief. He served until 1934.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofsanmarino.org/smpd/smpd.history.htm |title=City of San Marino, CA - San Marino Police Department |publisher=Cityofsanmarino.org |date=1975-07-15 |accessdate=2010-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently, The Field Services Division, or Patrol Bureau, is the largest component of the Police Department division with a staff of 22,  including 1 Lieutenant, 4 Sergeants, and 17 patrol officers.

San Marino may be recognizable to many Americans for the prevalence of movies and television shows filmed in the city. Location scouts turn to San Marino when they wish to make a film in southern California set elsewhere.
