The first team to use the &quot;Whitecaps&quot; name was the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (NASL)|Vancouver Whitecaps]] of the now-defunct [[North American Soccer League]], playing from 1974 to 1981. A Whitecaps FC team began play in [[Major League Soccer]] starting in [[2011 MLS season|2011]] making it the first time since 1984 that a &quot;Whitecaps&quot; team is playing in the top tier of [[association football|soccer]] in the United States and Canada.

== NASL (1973â84) ==
{{Main|Vancouver Whitecaps (NASL)}}
The original '''Vancouver Whitecaps''' were founded on December 11, 1973 and during the  1970s and 1980s played in the [[North American Soccer League]] (NASL). The Whitecaps achieved success, winning the 1979 [[Soccer Bowl]]. The Whitecaps of that era included international players such as [[Alan Ball (footballer)|Alan Ball]], but also &quot;home grown&quot; stars like [[Bob Lenarduzzi|Bobby]] and [[Sam Lenarduzzi]], [[Buzz Parsons]], and [[Glen Johnson (soccer)|Glen Johnson]].  In 1979 the team from the &quot;Village of Vancouver&quot; (a reference to ABC TV sportscaster [[Jim McKay]]'s observation that &quot;Vancouver must be like the deserted village right now&quot;, with so many people watching the game on TV) beat the powerhouse [[New York Cosmos]] in one of the most thrilling playoff series in NASL history to advance to the [[Soccer Bowl]].  In the Soccer Bowl, they triumphed against the [[Tampa Bay Rowdies (1975â1993)|Tampa Bay Rowdies]] in a disappointed [[New York City]].

It was during this short period that soccer interest peaked in Vancouver. The Whitecaps attendance at [[Empire Stadium, Vancouver|Empire Stadium]] grew to regular sellouts, at 32,000. The team also recorded two tracks, with &quot;White is the Colour&quot; becoming a hit on local radio during the run-up to their championship win.

After playing at Vancouver's 32,000-seat Empire Stadium for most of their existence, the team moved into the brand new 60,000-seat [[BC Place Stadium]] in 1983. However, the subsequent demise of the NASL in 1984 meant the Whitecaps - along with the other teams in the NASL - were forced to fold.

== Post-NASL Revival (1986â87) ==
{{Main|Vancouver 86ers}}

In 1986, a professional soccer team was again launched in Vancouver, the Vancouver 86ersâso named because of both the year of the team's founding and to commemorate the year Vancouver was founded (1886). The 86ers played in the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987â1992)|Canadian Soccer League]] (CSL) winning 4 straight CSL Championships (1988â1991) and 5 consecutive CSL regular-season first-place finishes (1988â92). In 1990, the Vancouver 86ers captured the North American Club Championship after defeating the [[Maryland Bays]] 3â2 in the final played in Burnaby. The game was played between the champions of the [[Canadian Soccer League (1987â1992)|Canadian Soccer League]] and the champions of the [[American Professional Soccer League]] (APSL). Vancouver played in the CSL from its inception in 1987 until the league folded in 1992, and then moved over to the APSL in 1993 which was later absorbed into the USL hierarchy of leagues in 1997 becoming the [[American Professional Soccer League|A-League]], later renamed the [[USL First Division|USL]].

In 1988â1989, the team, coached by [[Bob Lenarduzzi]], set a North American professional sports record by playing 46 consecutive games without a loss.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcsportshalloffame.com/cgi-bin/search.cgi?team_id=44&amp;searchall=1&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Vancouver Whitecaps (1986â2010)}}

In 2001, the team began to use the old Vancouver Whitecaps moniker (signifying both the 'white caps' of the nearby mountains, and the waves of the [[Pacific Ocean]]). The Whitecaps currently practise on the new turf field at [[Simon Fraser University]].

In 2003, the name was again changed, albeit only slightly, to Whitecaps FC, which encompasses the men's, women's, and youth development teams within the organization. At this time, the Whitecaps logo changed slightly in colour (the light teal-green was replaced with a brighter blue) and the word &quot;Vancouver&quot; was dropped from the image.

In 2006, the Whitecaps organization won an unprecedented double-championship, claiming both the [[USL First Division|United Soccer Leagues First Division]] championship trophy, defeating the host [[Rochester Rhinos]] 3â0 at PAETEC Park, and winning the W-League women's trophy. The men's team also won the Nation's Cup, a new tournament established by their club as a way to feature the Whitecaps playing against international competition. The 2006 Nation's Cup tournament featured the Chinese and Indian U-20 National teams and [[Football League Championship|Championship]] Welsh club [[Cardiff City F.C.]] (the &quot;Bluebirds&quot;). The gradually added the &quot;Vancouver&quot; back into their name, changing it officially to &quot;Vancouver Whitecaps FC&quot;.

The following season, the Whitecaps signed a deal to play an exhibition match against the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], which featured international [[David Beckham]], and promoted Director of Soccer Operations [[Bob Lenarduzzi]] to team president.

October 12, 2008, they claimed their second United Soccer Leagues First Division championship with a 2â1 victory over the [[Puerto Rico Islanders]]. [[Charles Gbeke]] scored twice with his head in the second half to help secure the title. In 2009, they placed 7th in the league and were eliminated in the final by the [[Montreal Impact]] on a 6â3 aggregate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The Vancouver franchise was granted status on March 18, 2009 by MLS Commissioner [[Don Garber]] as the seventeenth franchise of Major League Soccer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/content/mls-awards-vancouver-team-2011 |title=MLS awards Vancouver team for 2011 |date=2009-03-18 |accessdate=2010-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is to join the [[Portland Timbers (MLS)|Portland Timbers]], announced two days later as the eighteenth MLS franchise, for the [[2011 Major League Soccer season|2011 MLS season]]. While no name was provided at the Vancouver announcement, over a year later the club confirmed that the MLS team would keep the Whitecaps name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=It's official: Whitecaps joining MLS in 2011 | url=http://www.vancouversun.com/official+Whitecaps+joining+2011/1402528/story.html | publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] | date=2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=MLS expected to announce Vancouver expansion team | url=http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2009/03/17/sp-whitecaps-expansion.html | publisher=[[CBC News]] | date=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Whitecaps to announce they will join MLS in 2011 | url=http://www.vancouversun.com/Sports/Whitecaps+expected+announce+they+will+join+2011/1398865/story.html | publisher=[[The Vancouver Sun]] | date=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | Whitecaps to announce MLS franchise secured | url=http://www.canada.com/Sports/Whitecaps+announce+franchise+secured/1399199/story.html | publisher=[[Canwest News Service]] | date=2009-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In preparation for its inaugural season, the Whitecaps brought in executive talent from around the world. On November 24, 2009, [[Paul Barber (soccer administrator)|Paul Barber]], former [[Tottenham Hotspur F.C.]] executive, was announced to join the club as CEO. Others joining him include former [[D.C. United]] head coach [[Tom Soehn]] as Director of Operations and Dutch national [[Richard Grootscholten]] as the technical director and head coach of the residency program. Former [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] international [[Teitur Thordarson]] was confirmed as head coach on September 2, 2010 for the inaugural MLS season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/node/151 whitecapsfc.com - Technical Staff]&lt;/ref&gt; He held the same position with the [[United Soccer Leagues|USL]] and later [[USSF Division 2 Professional League|USSF Division 2]] [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986â2010)|Whitecaps]].
