<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="369144" ns="0" title="Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">The '''Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food''' was a UK cabinet position, responsible for the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food]]. The post was originally named President of the Board of Agriculture and was created in 1889. In 1903 an Act was passed to transfer to the new-styled Board of Agriculture and Fisheries certain powers and duties relating to the fishing industry, and the post was renamed President of the Board of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1919 it was renamed Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries. In 1954 the separate position of [[Minister of Food]] was merged into the post and it was renamed Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. Successive Ministers were asked to upgrade the Ministry to a Department of State and take the title 'Secretary of State', but all refused.

On 8 June 2001, the Ministry merged with [[Secretary of State for the Environment]] into the office of [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]]. However, the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food was not formally abolished until The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Dissolution) Order 2002 (S.I. 2002/794) came into force on 27 March 2002. Until the Dissolution Order also made the necessary amendments to the law when it did come into force, many statutory functions were still vested in the holder of the office of Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, rather in the Secretary of State at large. For that reason, in a final twist, [[Margaret Beckett]] had to be appointed formally as the last ever Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as well as becoming the first Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs.
