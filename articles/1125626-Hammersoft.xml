'''Oxford Bus Company''' is a [[bus]] operator serving the city and surrounding area of [[Oxford]], [[England]] and is the trading name of City of Oxford Motor Services Ltd. It is now a subsidiary of the [[Go-Ahead Group]]. The company operates [[Oxford Bus Company#Brands|five different brands.]]

Oxford is one of the few UK cities where such free and unsubsidised competition (as envisaged by the architects of [[bus deregulation]] in the 1980s) still exists. Similarly the Espress buses compete with the Stagecoach in Oxfordshire's [[Oxford Tube]] service. This unusual level of both service and competition is facilitated by Oxford's status as a prestigious university city and the consequent large numbers of young, affluent but car-less inhabitants, assisted by Oxfordâs pro-public transport Balanced Transport Policy of 1973 and Oxford Transport Strategy of 1993. As of 2006 public transport use in the city was six times the national average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harris, Chris|title=Exploring Oxford Bus Company country|publisher=Past &amp; Present Publishing|location=Kettering|year=2007|isbn=978-1-85895-256-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the competition led to route inefficiencies and lack of ticket interoperability between bus operators. In 2010 it was announced that a quality contract had been agreed between the two principal bus operators and the County Council leading to joint timetabling and ticketing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Reg|last=Little|title=Historic bus deal boosts city services|work=Oxford Times|date=2010-01-14|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A horse-drawn [[tram system]] first operated in Oxford from 1881.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22819 A History of the County of Oxford: Volume 4: The City of Oxford]; [http://www.oxfordbus.co.uk/content/doc/cms/companyhistory.pdf Oxford Bus Company: history]&lt;/ref&gt; Its operation was taken over in 1906 by the City of Oxford Electric Tramway Company Ltd. This did not in fact electrify the tramway, but over the period 1913-14, and under threat of competition from [[William Morris, 1st Viscount Nuffield|William Morris (later Lord Nuffield)]], replaced the [[tram]]s by [[Daimler Motor Company]] buses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordmail.co.uk/news/community/memorylane/5058786.Postcard_marked_passing_of_Oxford_s_trams/ Oxford Mail: Postcard marked passing of Oxford's trams; 10:00am Monday 15th March 2010]; [http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1914/jul/22/oxford-and-district-tramways-bill-by OXFORD AND DISTRICT TRAMWAYS BILL. (By Order.) HC Deb 22 July 1914 vol 65 cc591-9 591]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921 the company was renamed '''City of Oxford Motor Services Ltd''' and continued to expand its operations into the surrounding countryside. From the 1930s the company was controlled by [[British Electric Traction]] with a large [[Great Western Railway]] shareholding. Most of the fleet comprised [[Associated Equipment Company|AEC]] vehicles in the traditional red livery with green and maroon relief.

On becoming a subsidiary of the [[National Bus Company (UK)|National Bus Company]] in 1969, moves towards greater integration of city and country services began. In 1971 the Oxford to London coach operator '''South Midland''' (established as South Midland Transport &amp; Touring Company Ltd in 1921), which had been controlled by the neighbouring [[Thames Valley Traction]] company, was transferred to City of Oxford and the fleet name for the entire operation became '''Oxford South Midland'''. A particularly acute problem for the operator was the competition for staff with the [[Morris Motor Company]] whose works was located close to the Oxford garage. One solution was the move to one person operation of buses during the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jolly, Stephen and Taylor, Nick|title=The Book of Oxford Buses and Trams|publisher=Oxford Bus Museum Trust|year=2003|isbn=0-9506739-2-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following several trials, the Oxford company has operated the cityâs pioneering [[park and ride]] bus services since 1978, the year in which the London express service on its present routing began.

In 1983 the operation was split into separate Oxford and South Midland units.  The Oxford Bus Company was allocated the Oxford city services and the London routes, and South Midland was allocated the remainder of the network.   Both companies were subject to [[management buyout]]s. The South Midland company was soon resold to [[Thames Transit]] (later [[Stagecoach South Midlands|Stagecoach]]) who introduced [[minibus]] competition, countered by the Oxford Bus Company under the brand name '''Oxford City Nipper'''. 

[[Image:WYOxlogo.gif|right|180px|The previous 1999 logos of the Wycombe Bus Company and Oxford Bus Company]] 
In 1990 the Oxford Bus Company acquired the High Wycombe operations of the [[First Berkshire &amp; The Thames Valley|Bee Line]], and ran them under the '''Wycombe Bus''' brand name.  OBC was sold to the [[Go-Ahead Group]] in 1994. In 2000 Go-Ahead sold the High Wycombe operations to [[Arriva Shires &amp; Essex|Arriva]], who dropped the Wycombe Bus brand.  In Oxford the name '''City Line''' was used before the present branding was adopted in 2000. The company's long-standing main depot site in [[Cowley Road, Oxford]] was abandoned in 2004 in favour of a new works in Watlington Road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ashworth, Phil|title=The Oxford Bus Company &amp;mdash; the first 125 years|publisher=Oxford Bus Company|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently, the Oxford Bus Company have replaced some of its older buses with the [[Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro]]. Another 11 arrived at the end of 2006; these were &quot;Euro V&quot;, a higher specification than at that date demanded by [[European emission standards]].

==Brands==
Oxford Bus Company currently operates services under five distinct brands:

|'''Oxford Bus Company''' / '''&quot;City&quot;''' 
|Local buses in and around Oxford. The &quot;City&quot; name has been introduced recently for the most frequent services, and the name appears on the sides of buses. At first designated to specific routes (i.e. &quot;city 5&quot;) most buses now only display the general name.

==Fleet==
The fleet consists approximately 160 operational vehicles as of January 2009, consisting a wide variety of bus makes and types. The fleet is about 56% single-deck and 19% double-deck. Coaches make up around 25% of the fleet. 

The single-deck fleet contains a number of types. Three comparatively rare [[Dennis Dart|Dennis Dart SLF]]/[[Wright Crusader]]s were new in 1998. Two large batches of [[Volvo B10BLE]]/[[Wright Renown]]s in 1999 and 2000 total 21 of the type. In late 2002, the first of a batch of 5 [[Mercedes-Benz O530 Citaro|Mercedes-Benz Citaro]]s arrived for new park and ride service 500 to the recently opened Water Eaton site. Following a fleet reshuffle which saw service 500 receive double decker buses, this fleet now all carry the standard 'city' livery. The original batch can be distinguished by the protruding destination display, all other examples in the fleet have swept back versions. A year later in December 2003 a further batch of 11 Citaros arrived, branded for routes X3 to Abingdon. Another batch of 10 arrived in December 2005 for route 2, followed by another 11 in December 2006. 11 more arrived in January 2008. The 2006 batch onwards is to the new Citaro design for the Euro 4 engine, although the Oxford examples are to Euro 5 specification. Half of the 2006 and the 2008 batch are branded for routes X3 and X13, which meant that the second batch were debranded and now work in generic livery.

The double-deckers in the fleet are [[Dennis Trident 2]]s. A batch of 20 with [[Alexander ALX400]] bodywork entered service in 1999. These were some of the first examples of the type. Originally 14 of the batch operated on park and ride services but are now being phased out in favour of 17 new diesel/electric hybrid ADL Enviro400H models&lt;ref&gt;www.busandcoach.com/newspage.aspx?id=5382&amp;categoryid=0&lt;/ref&gt;. In 2007, 8 Tridents with [[Plaxton President]] bodywork were transferred from [[Go North East]] for use on route 35/35A. These are restricted to certain routes as they are too high to fit under the Oxford station railway bridge. 

Also the double-decker fleet includes 31 [[Scania N230UD]] with [[Alexander Dennis Enviro400]] bodywork used for Brookes Bus services.

The large coach operation uses 37 vehicles. The Oxford Espress service uses most of a total of 12 (two batches in 2003 and 2004) [[Scania K114]]s with [[Irizar]] Century bodywork, as well as 6 2002 [[Volvo B12B]]s with [[Jonckheere]] Mistral bodywork. The Airline uses a fleet of 19 Volvo B12B/Plaxton Panthers new in 2008, as well as some of the Scania K114s.
