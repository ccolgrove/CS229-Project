The '''[[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] season''' was the club's 35th season as a franchise in the [[National Football League|NFL]]. The Buccaneers entered the season attempting to improve on their 3â13 record and last place finish in the [[NFC South]] in [[2009 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|2009]], a feat they accomplished after only six games.  The Buccaneers achieved the best turnaround in franchise history and became the first team since the NFL merger in 1970 to start 10 rookies and achieve a winning season. [[Raheem Morris]] spent his second season as head coach. The Buccaneers had the third overall pick in the [[2010 NFL Draft]], with which they selected [[Gerald McCoy]].

[[John McKay (American football)|John McKay]], the team's first head coach, became the second inductee into the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers#Ring of Honor|Ring of Honor]] on December 5 during a game against [[Atlanta Falcons|Atlanta]]. McKay's son [[Rich McKay|Rich]], a former Buccaneers [[general manager]], and current president of the Falcons, accepted the award for his late father.&lt;ref name=&quot;McKay&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Despite finishing the season with a 10&amp;ndash;6 record (a seven game improvement from the year before), the team failed to sell out any of its home games at [[Raymond James Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6244302]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Buccaneers won their fifth straight road game (dating back to the previous season) with a shootout win against the [[Arizona Cardinals|Cardinals]]. 

Arizona took the early lead after a 3-yard touchdown pass from [[Max Hall]] to [[Larry Fitzgerald]]. On their next drive, [[Geno Hayes]] intercepted Hall, and returned 41-yards for a touchdown. Early in the second quarter, Buccaneers returner [[Sammie Stroughter]] muffed a punt and the ball was recovered by the Cardinals at the Tampa Bay 16 yard line. [[Beanie Wells]] scored a 1-yard touchdown run off the turnover, and the Cardinals led 14-7. On the ensuing drive, [[Josh Freeman]] drove the Buccaneers 80 yards in only three plays, completing a 47-yard touchdown pass to [[Mike Williams (wide receiver b. 1987)|Mike Williams]] and a 14-14 tie. Four plays later, [[Aqib Talib]] returned Hall's second interception 45 yards for a touchdown and the Buccaneers led 21-14. Hall was benched in favor of [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]]. Anderson drove the Cardinals to the Tampa Bay 3 yard line, but threw incomplete on a 4th down &amp; 2 and turned the ball over on downs. Tampa Bay drove 94 yards in the final three minutes, and [[Connor Barth]] kicked a field goal as the half expired.

In the third quarter, Tampa Bay increased their lead to 31-14 after a [[LeGarrette Blount]] touchdown run. Arizona rallied, however. [[LaRod Stephens-Howling]] rushed for a 30-yard touchdown with one minute left in the third quarter. [[LeGarrette Blount|Blount]] fumbled the ball on the first play of the ensuing drive, and [[Gerald Hayes]] recovered the ball 21 yards for a Cardinals touchdown.

Tampa Bay answered with [[LeGarrette Blount|Blount's]] second touchdown run, and a 38-35 lead. [[Barrett Ruud]] intercepted [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Anderson]] on the first play of the next drive, which set up a 53-yard field goal attempt by [[Connor Barth|Barth]]. Tampa Bay chose to attempt the long field goal instead of punting. The kick was blocked, and the Cardinals took over with 3:16 remaining in good field position. Anderson drove the Cardinals to the Tampa Bay 20 yard line, but he was intercepted by [[Aqib Talib]], who clinched the win for Tampa Bay.

Looking to secure a playoff spot, the Buccaneers played at New Orleans. Trailing 3-7 in the second quarter, the Buccaneers took the lead with [[Josh Freeman]] completing a 2-yard touchdown pass to [[Dezmon Briscoe]]. The Saints tied the game after [[Garrett Hartley]]'s 45-yard field goal in the third quarter. Tampa Bay re-took the lead after another field goal, then stretched their lead with Freeman's second touchdown pass of the day. The Saints tried to narrow the gap with Hartley making a 38-yard field goal, but the Buccaneers held on to win.

With the win, the Buccaneers finished with a 10â6 record, but the [[Green Bay Packers]] victory over the [[Chicago Bears]] later that day gave them the 6th seed due to a strength of victory tie-breaker and eliminated the Buccaneers from playoff contention.

{{main|2010 NFL Draft}}
After finishing the 2009 season with a record of 3â13, the Buccaneers picked third. The Buccaneers also had an additional second round pick from a trade that sent the late defensive end [[Gaines Adams]] to the [[Chicago Bears]], a fifth round pick from the [[New England Patriots]] in a trade that sent tight end [[Alex Smith (tight end)|Alex Smith]] to the Patriots, and two additional seventh round picks; one from the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] for quarterback [[Luke McCown]], and one from the [[Baltimore Ravens]] for defensive end [[Marques Douglas]]. The Buccaneers traded their 2010 fifth-round selection and a 2009 second-round selection to the Browns for TE [[Kellen Winslow II]].

==== Undrafted free agents ====
After the draft many of the players that went unpicked are signed by teams to fill out their rosters and create competition for places on the roster. These undrafted free agents have a long shot of making the team for the start of the regular season but there have been some notable recent Buccaneer success stories such as Clifton Smith and Elbert Mack. The following were signed after the draft as first year players.

==Television blackouts==
All of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers home games (preseason and regular season) have been [[Blackout (broadcasting)|blacked out]] on local television because the games failed to sell out prior to 72 hours before kickoff. The affiliates affected include [[WTVT]], [[WTSP]], and [[WFLA-TV|WFLA]] (preseason) in the [[Tampa Bay Area|Tampa/St. Pete market]], as well as [[WOFL]], [[WKMG-TV|WKMG]] and [[WFTV]] (preseason) in the [[Greater Orlando|Orlando market]]. Despite their improvement and being in the playoff hunt, Tampa Bay Buccaneers became the first NFL team of the 2010 season to not sell out a single home game.

The Week 1 blackout against [[2010 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland]] marked the first regular season game at [[Raymond James Stadium]] that failed to sell out. The last TV blackout occurred in 1997.
