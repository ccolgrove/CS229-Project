The '''Providence Friars''' is the name of the athletic teams of [[Providence College]]. They compete in the [[Big East Conference]] ([[NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]]) for every sport except for [[ice hockey]], where they compete in [[Hockey East]] and in women's [[volleyball]], where they compete in the [[America East Conference]]. The Big East Conference was founded in 1979 by former athletic director and men's basketball coach [[Dave Gavitt]], and the current commissioner is former athletic director [[John Marinatto]].

The school's men's and women's sports teams are called the ''[[Friar]]s'', after the [[Dominican Order]] that runs the school. They are the only collegiate team to use the name.

Overall, the program consists of 19 [[varsity team|varsity]] sports, seven for men and ten for women: men's and women's [[basketball]], men's and women's [[Cross country running|cross country]], [[field hockey]], men's and women's ice hockey, men's [[lacrosse]], men's and women's [[soccer]], [[softball]], men's and women's [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[diving]], women's [[tennis]], men's and women's [[track and field]], and women's [[volleyball]]. The lacrosse team competed in the [[Metro Atlantic Athletic Conference]] through the 2009 season before joining the newly-created Big East lacrosse league for 2010.

Former sports include [[American football|football]], which was offered from 1921 until [[World War II]] in 1941, and [[baseball]], which was dropped due to [[Title IX]] in 1999. Other dropped sports include men's tennis and men's [[golf]].

The school's biggest rivalries are [[Boston University]] and [[Boston College]] in hockey and [[University of Connecticut|UConn]] and [[University of Rhode Island|URI]] in the school's other sports, especially in soccer, swimming and diving, and basketball.

===Renovations===
The mid-2000s saw the beginning of the improvement of many of the on- and off-campus facilities under new president [[Brian Shanley|Fr. Brian Shanley]]:

In August 2005, the school opened an [[artificial turf]] field for its lacrosse and field hockey programs adjacent to the Peterson Recreation Center; underneath the field is a parking garage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=http://www.friars.com/sports/w-fieldh/spec-rel/082205aaa.html|title=Friars To Celebrate Opening Of The College's Multi-Million Dollar Turf Facility|work=[[Providence College]]|date=2005-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2005, the Rhode Island Convention Center Authority purchased the Dunkin' Donuts Center from the city of Providence and spent $80 million on an extensive renovation. Major elements of the construction included a significantly expanded lobby and concourse, an enclosed pedestrian bridge from the Rhode Island Convention Center, a new center-hung [[LED]] video display board, a new restaurant, 20 luxury suites, four new bathrooms, and all-new seats with cupholders in the arena bowl. Behind-the-scenes improvements included a new [[HVAC]] system, ice chiller, and a first-of-its-kind fire suppression system. These renovations were completed in October 2008.

In 2006, Schneider Arena underwent a refurbishment that included new seats and renovated training rooms, locker rooms, and offices.

In 2007, the Concannon Fitness Center was built between Alumni Hall and the Peterson Recreation Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/facilities/prov-concannon-dev.html|title=Concannon Fitness Center|work=[[Providence College]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and included the [[Jimmy Walker (basketball)|Jimmy Walker]] Strength and Conditioning Center&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/facilities/prov-jimmywalker-dev.html|title=Jimmy Walker Strength and Conditioning Center|work=[[Providence College]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; for student-athletes. At the same time, improvements were made to Alumni Hall, including the opening of the Canavan Sports Medicine Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/facilities/prov-canavan-dev.html|title=Canavan Sports Medicine Center|work=[[Providence College]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Helen Bert Student Athlete Lounge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/facilities/prov-helenbert-dev.html|title=Helen Bert Student-Athlete Lounge|work=[[Providence College]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Joe Calabria Hallway of Legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/facilities/prov-calabria-dev.html|title=Joe Calabria Hallway|work=[[Providence College]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mullaney Gymnasium, inside Alumni Hall, was also refurbished during this time, including a new floor, scoreboard, locker rooms, and offices for the basketball programs and athletic department.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/facilities/prov-alumnihall-dev.html|title=Alumni Hall/Mullaney Gymnasium|work=[[Providence College]]|accessdate=2009-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
