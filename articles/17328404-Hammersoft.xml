The whole County Council is the ultimate decision-making body and the principal forum for major political debate. Its 71 members meet six times a year. The County Council reserves to itself decisions on key policy plans, questions members of the Cabinet, debates major pieces of work by Select Committees and notices of motion.

It appoints the Leader who decides the composition and areas of competence of the Cabinet, to which responsibility is delegated for carrying out many of the County Council's existing policies. It also appoints the Select Committees which examine and review decisions and actions of the Cabinet and Cabinet Members, as well as some non-Executive committees and a Standards Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westsussex.gov.uk/ccm/content/your-council/about-the-county-council/council-and-cabinet.en&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The [[Local Government Act 1888]] created the [[administrative county]] of West Sussex, with its own county council, from the ancient county of [[Sussex]]. The eastern half came under the control of [[East Sussex County Council]]. Until 1898 it existed alongside the Urban and Rural Sanitary Districts, when these were abolished in favour of a new network or urban and rural districts.

The [[Local Government Act 1972]] abolished the previous structure of local government in England and Wales. At this time West Sussex became a [[non-metropolitan county]], divided into districts. This act created the two-tier system of government that exists in West Sussex to this day.
