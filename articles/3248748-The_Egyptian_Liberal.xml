{{History of Egypt}}

The '''Egyptian Revolution of 1952''' ({{lang-ar|Ø«ÙØ±Ø© 23 ÙÙÙÙÙ 1952}}), also known as the '''23 July Revolution''', began on 23 July 1952, with a military [[coup d'Ã©tat]] by the [[Free Officers Movement]], a group of army officers led by [[Muhammad Naguib]] and [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]. The revolution was initially aimed at overthrowing [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]]. However, the movement had more political ambitions, and soon moved to abolish the [[constitutional monarchy]] and [[aristocracy]] of Egypt and [[Sudan]], establish a [[republic]], end the [[United Kingdom|British]] occupation of the country, and secure the independence of [[Sudan]] (hitherto governed as an [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Anglo-Egyptian condominium]]). The revolutionary government adopted a staunchly [[nationalism|nationalist]], [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] agenda, which came to be expressed chiefly through [[Arab nationalism]], and international [[non-alignment]].

The revolution was faced with immediate threats from Western imperial powers, particularly the [[United Kingdom]], which had occupied Egypt since 1882, and [[France]], both of whom were wary of rising nationalist sentiment in territories under their control throughout the [[Arab World]] and [[Africa]]. The ongoing [[Arab-Israeli conflict|state of war with Israel]] also posed a serious challenge, as the Free Officers increased Egypt's already strong support of the [[Palestinian people|Palestinians]]. These two issues conflated four years after the revolution when Egypt was invaded by Britain, [[France]], and [[Israel]] in the [[Suez Crisis|Tripartite Aggression]] of 1956. Despite enormous military losses, the war was seen as a political victory for Egypt, especially as it left the [[Suez Canal]] in uncontested Egyptian control for the first time since 1875, erasing what was seen as a mark of national humiliation. This strengthened the appeal of the revolution in other Arab and African countries.

Wholesale [[agrarian reform]], and huge [[industrialisation]] programmes were initiated in the first decade and half of the revolution, leading to an unprecedented period of infrastructure building, and [[urbanisation]]. By the 1960s, [[Arab socialism]] had become a dominant theme, transforming Egypt into a [[centrally planned economy]]. Official fear of a Western-sponsored [[counter-revolution]], domestic religious extremism, potential [[communist]] infiltration, and the conflict with Israel were all cited as reasons compelling severe and longstanding restrictions on political opposition, and the prohibition of a [[multi-party]] system. These restrictions on political activity would remain in place until the presidency of [[Anwar Al-Sadat]] from 1970 onwards, during which many of the policies of the revolution were scaled back or reversed.

The early successes of the revolution encouraged numerous other nationalist movements in other [[Arab]] and [[African]] countries, such as [[Algeria]], and [[Kenya]], which were engaged in anti-colonial struggles against European empires. It also inspired the toppling of existing pro-Western monarchies and governments in the region and the continent.

The Revolution is commemorated each year on Egypt's national day, [[Revolution Day (Egypt)|Revolution Day]], on 23 July.

== Causes ==

{{unreferenced section|date=February 2011}}

* [[Germany]] successfully agitated numerous anti-British movements of various degrees of Islamic and secular political ideologies in the run-up to [[World War II]].  Coordinated by German intelligence and nurtured by exposure to [[Liberalism]] and [[Nationalism]] and renewed [[Jihadism]], these groups coalesced into the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the [[Baath Party]], and other reformist and revolutionary groups during the inter-war years before gaining substantial ideological, political, psychological, and logistical support from the Axis powers.  After [[World War II]] these associated elements received moral and sometimes logistical support from the United States and the Soviet Union who were both opposed to continuing the European Colonial Empires.

* Both the [[United States of America]] and the [[Soviet Union]] promoted the view that the Egyptian [[monarchy]] was both corrupt and a pro-British colonial [[satrapy]], its lavish lifestyle in sharp contrast to that of the Free Officers, who lived in poverty. The propaganda of the two [[Super-powers]] completed the image of the Egyptian government as a corrupt puppet of the British.

* The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] and the [[KGB]] through their agents in Egypt promoted the feeling of corruption on the part of several Egyptian institutions such as the police, the palace and even the political parties, and in turn helped coordinate their anti-British and reformist sympathies with the Free Officers Movement.

* The loss of 1948 war with [[Israel]] led to the Free Officers' blame of corruption with the King and his court and promotion of that feeling among the Egyptian people.

The Free Officers Movement' was formed by a group of reform minded officers which, backed by the Soviet Union and the United States, coalesced around a young officer named [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]].  They used an army general, [[Muhammad Naguib]], as its head to show their seriousness and attract more army followers.

In the warning that General Naguib conveyed to [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] on 26 July upon the king's abdication, he provided a summary of the reasons for the revolution:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of what the country has suffered in the recent past, the complete [[vacuity]] prevailing in all corners as a result of your bad behavior, your toying with the constitution, and your disdain for the wants of the people, no one rests assured of life, livelihood, and honor. Egypt's reputation among the peoples of the world has been debased as a result of your excesses in these areas to the extent that traitors and bribe-takers find protection beneath your shadow in addition to security, excessive wealth, and many extravagances at the expense of the hungry and impoverished people. You manifested this during and after the Palestine War in the corrupt arms scandals and your open interference in the courts to try to falsify the facts of the case, thus shaking faith in justice. Therefore, the army, representing the power of the people, has empowered me to demand that Your Majesty abdicate the throne to His Highness Crown Prince Ahmed Fuad, provided that this is accomplished at the fixed time of 12 o'clock noon today (Saturday, 26 July 1952, the 4th of Zul Qa'ada, 1371), and that you depart the country before 6 o'clock in the evening of the same day. The army places upon Your Majesty the burden of everything that may result from your failure to abdicate according to the wishes of the people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=f0ubvD99Ly4C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;dq=the+complete+vacuity+prevailing+in+all+corners+as+a+result+of+your+bad+behavior&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=2qdaTqurOYX00gH07IiUCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20complete%20vacuity%20prevailing%20in%20all%20corners%20as%20a%20result%20of%20your%20bad%20behavior&amp;f=false The Long Struggle: The Seeds of the Muslim World's Frustration] By Amil Khan, p.58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Prelude ==
During the winter of 1951â1952 nationalist police officers backed by the United States and the Soviet Union began protecting and promoting [[fedayeen]] [the Egyptian resistance]  attacks on British authorities in [[Cairo]], [[Alexandria]], and the [[Suez Canal]].  After repelling a particularly devastating attack on British shipping and facilities near [[Ismailia]] which resulted in the death of several British soldiers. British troops tracked the fedayeen into the city.  On January 25, 1952, British troops discovered the fedayeen had retreated into the local police barracks.  When the police refused to surrender the fedayeen, the British officer attempted to negotiate the surrender of the police and the fedayeen.  When their negotiator was killed in the parley by the fedayeen, the British force attacked the Egyptian police barracks in [[Ismailia]].  Fifty Egyptian police officers were killed and one hundred were wounded. Egypt erupted in fury.

Subsequently, Free Officer Movement cells initiated riots in Cairo which led to arsons.  Without suppression from local fire brigades, these arson attacks further inflamed more rioting.  American and Soviet [[newspaper]]s promoted the incident on global wire outlets as the &quot;[[Cairo Fire]]s&quot; and suggested they were seen as further evidence of the beginning of the end of the monarchy.

The next day, January 26, 1952 (&quot;Black Saturday&quot;), what many Egyptians call &quot;the second revolution&quot; broke out (the first being the [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]]).

[[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] dismissed [[Mustafa el-Nahhas]]'s government, and in the months that followed, three different politicians were instructed to form governments, each proving short-lived: Ali Maher (27 January â 1 March), Ahmed Naguib El-Hilali (2 March â 29 June, and [[July 22|22]]â23 July) and Hussein Sirri ([[2 July|2]]â20 July). These &quot;salvation ministries&quot;, as they were called, failed to halt the country's downward spiral. Corruption remained ubiquitous despite attempts by successive prime ministers to put their political houses in order.

Stirrings of discontent were felt in the army, and in January 1952 opposition officers supported by the Free Officers gained control of the governing board of the Officers Club. On 16 July, the King annulled these elections, appointing his own supporters instead in an attempt to regain control of the army.

A coup d'Ã©tat was planned for 5 August, but when General Naguib, one of the Free Officers, informed the group on 19 July that the Egyptical Royal Army high command had a list of their names, the coup leaders acted on the night of 22 July.

==Revolution==

On Wednesday morning, 23 July 1952, a military coup occurred in Egypt, carried out by The &quot;Free Officers&quot; and led by General Naguib, but the real power behind the military coup was Gamal Abdel Nasser. Aided by intelligence provided by the two super-powers and their own network, the Free Officers Movement targeted command, control, and communications posts of the Army and Internal Ministry.  Several police sections that had been successfully penetrated aided in rounding up key personnel of the royal government.

At 7:30 a.m., the Egyptian populace heard a broadcast station issue the first communiquÃ© of the revolution in the name of Gen. Naguib to the Egyptian people that stated the justification for the revolution or the '''Blessed Movement'''. The voice everyone heard reading the message belonged to Free Officer and future president of Egypt, Anwar El Sadat:&lt;ref&gt;Ibrahim, Sammar. [http://www.sis.gov.eg/En/Pub/africanperspective/16issue/110415000000000003.htm 'Profile: Anwar Al-Sadat'], ''Egypt State Information Service'', Retrieved on 2008-07-20.&lt;/ref&gt; The coup was conducted by less than a hundred officers - almost all drawn from junior ranks â and prompted scenes of celebration in the streets by cheering mobs.&lt;ref name=Osman&gt;''Egypt on the Brink'' by Tarek Osman, Yale University Press, 2010, p.40&lt;/ref&gt; 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Egypt has passed through a critical period in her recent history characterized by bribery, mischief, and the absence of governmental stability. All of these were factors that had a large influence on the army. Those who accepted bribes and were thus influenced caused our defeat in the Palestine War [1948]. As for the period following the war, the mischief-making elements have been assisting one another, and traitors have been commanding the army. They appointed a commander who is either ignorant or corrupt. Egypt has reached the point, therefore, of having no army to defend it. Accordingly, we have undertaken to clean ourselves up and have appointed to command us men from within the army whom we trust in their ability, their character, and their patriotism. It is certain that all Egypt will meet this news with enthusiasm and will welcome it. As for those whose arrest we saw fit from among men formerly associated with the army, we will not deal harshly with them, but will release them at the appropriate time. I assure the Egyptian people that the entire army today has become capable of operating in the national interest and under the rule of the constitution apart from any interests of its own. I take this opportunity to request that the people never permit any traitors to take refuge in deeds of destruction or violence because these are not in the interest of Egypt. Should anyone behave in such ways, he will be dealt with forcefully in a manner such as has not been seen before and his deeds will meet immediately the reward for treason. The army will take charge with the assistance of the police. I assure our foreign brothers that their interests, their personal safety [lit. &quot;their souls&quot;], and their property are safe, and that the army considers itself responsible for them. May God grant us success [lit. &quot;God is the guardian of success&quot;].&lt;/blockquote&gt;

With his British support network now neutralized, [[Farouk of Egypt|King Farouk]] sought the intervention of the [[United States]], which unsurprisingly would not respond. By the 25th, the army had occupied [[Alexandria]], where the king was in residence at the [[Montaza Palace]]. Now plainly terrified, Farouk abandoned Montaza, and moved to [[Ras Al-Teen Palace]] on the waterfront. Naguib ordered the captain of Farouk's yacht, ''al-Mahrusa'', not to sail without orders from the army.

Debate broke out among the Free Officers concerning the fate of the deposed king. While some (including Gen. Naguib and Nasser) viewed the best solution as to send him into exile, others argued the urge to put him on trial and even execute him for the &quot;crimes he committed to the Egyptian people&quot;. Finally, the order came for Farouk to abdicate in favour of his son, Crown Prince [[Fuad II of Egypt|Ahmed Fuad]] - who was acceded to the throne as King Fuad II - and a Regency Council was appointed. Departure into exile finally came on Saturday, July 26, 1952 and at 6 o'clock that evening, the king set sail for [[Italy]] with protection from the Egyptian army. On July 28, 1953, Muhammad Naguib became the first President of Egypt, which marked the beginning of modern Egyptian governance.

== Consolidation ==&lt;!-- [[Revolutionary Tribunal (Egypt)]] references this section --&gt;

The [[Egyptian Revolutionary Command Council|Revolution Command Council]] (RCC), made up of the previous 9-member command committee of the Free Officers in addition to five more members, including [[Mohamed Naguib]], was formed. Ali Maher was asked to form a civilian government. When the Free Officers started isolating elements sympathizing with the Soviet Union, [[Communist Party]] cadres led workers riots in [[Kafr Dawar]] on [[August 12]], [[1952]], which resulted in two death sentences. Ali Maher who still sympathized with the British resigned on 7 September following differences with the officers, principally over proposed [[Egyptian land reform|land reform]]. Mohamed Naguib became prime minister. On 9 September, the Agrarian Reform Law was passed, which immediately seized any white owned, especially British owned property in Egypt.  This was followed by signaling a major land redistribution programme among peasant farmers which gained most of the seized land.  However, royal land as well as those of Jews, Greeks, and [[Copt]]s, were in turn distributed amongst the Free Officers as well as common supporters of the regime.  In a bid to stop concentration of land ownership, the regime placed a ceiling of 200 [[feddan]]s on land ownership. On 9 December, the Revolutionary Command Council (RCC) without proper due process decreed that the [[1923 Constitution of Egypt]] was abrogated &quot;in the name of the people.&quot;

On 16 January 1953 the officers of the RCC dissolved and banned all political parties, declaring a three-year transitional period during which the RCC would rule. A provisional Constitutional Charter, written by the close circle of usurpers, was written with the intention of giving a veneer of legitimacy to the RCC.  This new Constitution was proclaimed on 10 February, and the Liberation Rallyâthe first of 3 political organisations linked to the July regimeâwas launched soon afterwards with the aim of mobilising popular support. The Rally was headed by [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]] and included other Free Officers as secretaries-general. On 18 June, the RCC declared Egypt a [[republic]], abolishing the monarchy (the infant son of Farouk had been reigning as King [[Fuad II of Egypt|Fuad II]]) and appointing General Naguib, aged 52, as first president and prime minister. [[Gamal Abdel-Nasser]], 35, was appointed deputy premier and minister of the interior. A '''Revolutionary Tribunal''' consisting of RCC members [[Abdel Latif Boghdadi (politician)|Abdel Latif Boghdadi]], Anwar el-Sadat and Hassan Ibrahim, was set up to try politicians of the ''ancien rÃ©gime''.

In opposition to the Constitution with its overt [[secularism]] was the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Additionally, contrary to orders issued by the Council, members of the Liberation Rally accumulated much of the seized non-Muslim property and distributed amongst their closed networks. Angered at being left out of the political and economic spoils and seeing a continuation of secularism and modernity within the Free Officers Movement such as had existed under the King, the Muslim Brotherhood organized its street elements. From June 1953 into the following year, Egypt was wracked by street riots, clashes, arson, and civil tumolt as the regime and the Muslim Brotherhood battled for popular support.

=== 1954 ===
In January, the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] was outlawed, remaining an illegal political organization until the [[2011 Egyptian revolution|Revolution of 2011]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. The move came in the wake of clashes between members of the Brotherhood and Liberation Rally student demonstrators on 12 January 1954. March witnessed clashes within the RCC, symbolised in the attempt, ultimately successful, to oust Naguib. The move faced opposition from within the army, and some members of the RCC, especially Khaled Mohieddin, favoured a return to constitutional government.  On 26 October, an [[assassination]] attempt suspected by the Brotherhood was directed at Nasser during a rally in Alexandria. This led to the regime acting against the Brotherhood, executing Brotherhood leaders on 9 December. Subsequently, Gamal Abdel-Nasser, who had maneuvered himself into the commanding heights of power, finally cemented his power, first becoming chairman of the RCC, and finally as prime minister, with Naguib's constitutional position remaining vague until 14 November, when he was dismissed from office and placed under house arrest.

Meanwhile, the RCC, morally backed by both the Soviet Union and the United States, managed to remain united in its opposition to the British and French, specifically in regard to the Suez. Despite continued calls from the RCC, in debates in the United Nations, and pressure from both the US and USSR, the British refused to transfer control of the Canal to the new regime.  The RCC began funding and coordinating ever greater attacks on the British and French in the Suez and Damietta. Finally, on 19 October, Nasser signed a treaty for the evacuation of British troops from Egypt, to be completed over the following 20 months. Two years later, on 18 June 1956, Nasser raised the Egyptian flag over the Canal Zone, announcing the complete evacuation of British troops.

=== 1956 ===

President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]] announced a new Constitution on 16 January at a popular rally, setting up a presidential system of government in which the president has the power to appoint and dismiss ministers. An elections law was passed on 3 March granting women the right to vote for the first time in Egyptian history. Nasser was elected as the second president of the Republic on 23 June. In 1957, Nasser announced the formation of the National Union (Al-Ittihad Al-Qawmi), paving the way to July elections for the National Assembly, the first parliament since 1952.
