'''Sabena Flight 571''' was a scheduled passenger flight from [[Vienna]] to [[Tel Aviv]] operated by the Belgian national airline, [[Sabena]]. On May 8, 1972 a [[Boeing 707]] passenger [[aircraft]] operating that service, and captained by the Englishman, Reginald Levy, [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United Kingdom)|DFC]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/05/world/europe/05levy.html|title=Reginald Levy Is Dead at 88; Hailed as a Hero in a â72 Hijacking|last=Hevesi|first=Dennis|date=5 August 2010|work=The New York Times|accessdate=6 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; was hijacked by four terrorists from the [[Black September (group)|Black September]] organization and landed at Lod Airport&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; (later [[Ben Gurion International Airport]])&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; near [[Lod]],  although that was the planned destination anyway.

The attack was planned by [[Ali Hassan Salameh]] and carried out by a group of two men and two women, armed with pistols,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; led by [[Ali Taha]]&lt;ref name=&quot;AARP&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | title =In a ruined country | publisher = [[The Atlantic Monthly]] | url =http://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200509/samuels/12  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twenty minutes out of Vienna,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; the hijackers rushed the cockpit. &quot;As you can see,&quot; Captain Levy told the 90 passengers, &quot;we have friends aboard&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; While the passengers and the captain waited, hoping that something would happen and lead to their safety, Reginald Levy talked about everything &quot;from navigation to sex&quot; with the terrorists.  

The hijackers demanded the release of 315 convicted Palestinian terrorists&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title =Striking Back: The 1972 Munich Olympics Massacre and Israel's Deadly Response | publisher = [[AARP The Magazine]] | url =http://www.aarpmagazine.org/books/striking_back.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; who were imprisoned in [[Israel]], and threatened to blow up the airplane with its passengers. Seeing the terrorists crying and hugging each other goodbye, Reginald Levy managed to send a message and ask for help to be delivered as soon as possible.  The [[Defense Minister of Israel|security minister]] [[Moshe Dayan]], conducted negotiations with the terrorists while also making preparations for a rescue operation, code-named &quot;Operation Isotope&quot;.

On May 9, 1972 at 4:00 p.m. the rescue operation began: a team of 16 [[Sayeret Matkal]] commandos, led by [[Ehud Barak]]&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; and including [[Benjamin Netanyahu]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; both future Israeli [[Prime Minister of Israel|Prime Ministers]], approached the airplane.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sontag&quot;&gt;{{Cite news | last =Sontag | first =Deborah | title =2 Who Share a Past Are Rivals for Israel's Future | publisher = [[The New York Times]] | pages =Section A, Page 3, Column 1 | year =1999 | url =http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30917FD3D5E0C738EDDAD0894D1494D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fB%2fBarak%2c%20Ehud| date =1999-04-20  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commandos were disguised as [[airplane]] [[technicians]] in white overalls,&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; and were able to convince the terrorists that the [[aircraft]] needed repair. The commandos stormed the aircraft and took control of the plane in ten minutes, killing both male hijackers and capturing the two women.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; All the passengers were rescued. Three of the passengers, however, were wounded in the takeover, with one female passenger eventually dying from her wounds. Netanyahu was wounded during the rescue, presumably by friendly fire.

The two female surviving terrorists were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]], but were later freed as part of a [[prisoner exchange]] following the [[1982 Lebanon War|Lebanon War]].

The hijacked airplane itself continued to be operated by Sabena for another five years before being purchased by [[Israel Aircraft Industries]].  They eventually sold the airplane to the [[Israeli Air Force]], where it served as a spy plane for many years and participated in most of the Air Force's long range operations.

Captain Levy, having flown [[Royal Air Force |RAF]] [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing missions]] over Germany&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; and taken part in the [[Berlin airlift]],&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; had joined Sabena in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; He retired in 1982&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; and died, from a heart attack, at a hospital near his home in [[Dover]] on 1 August 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt; The hijacking took place on his 50th birthday.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-Levy&quot; /&gt;&lt;!-- More on Levy's part, from cited ref, to be added soon --&gt;
