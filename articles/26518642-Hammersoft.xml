'''The Eyes of a Traitor''' are &lt;!-- DO NOT change this to &quot;is&quot; without discussion on the talk page (click &quot;discussion&quot; tab at top of page).--&gt; a British [[metalcore]] band from [[Harpenden]] in [[Hertfordshire]], UK, who formed in the summer of 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traitor Sign To Listenable&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.metalunderground.com/news/details.cfm?newsid=36193| title = The Eyes Of A Traitor Signs To Listenable Records| author = deathbringer | publisher = Metal Underground.com| date = 28/04/2008| accessdate = 06/09/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have released two extended plays, and two full-length studio albums. The band consists of vocalist Jack Delany, guitarists Tim George and Matthew Pugh, bassist Jack Moulsdale and drummer Sam Brennan. The bands name apparently devirves from a conversation the band members had whilst watching Star Wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;Absolutepunk interview jack&quot;/&gt; There have been numerous line-up changes within the band, mainly due to members wishing to pursue education.

They released their debut EP [[By Sunset]] in November 2007 after being recorded and writted it in 2006. This was followed up by [[A Clear Perception]] being released on [[Listenable Records]] in 2009. Their second studio album, [[Breathless (The Eyes of a Traitor album)|Breathless]], was released in July 2010 after featuring a different line-up, maintaining only the vocalist and drummer of the band as original members. They then released a second extended play titled [[The Disease EP|The Disease]] independently, through live shows. Eyes of a Traitor was in the process of recording their third studio album; however declared their hiatus on 20 November 2011.

==History==
===Formation and A Clear Perception (2006&amp;ndash;2009)===
The band formed in August 2006 when vocalist Jack Delany and guitarist Stephen Whitworth first met in Luton.&lt;ref name=&quot;Absolutepunk interview jack&quot;/&gt; A year after their formation, they parted ways with their bassist, Ian Cubbon due to musical differences. Releasing their first extended play, [[By Sunset]] on underground UK label [[Thirty Days of Night Records|Thirty Days of Night]] led to them touring across the country. Their first tour was a 7 day UK tour in support of Italian [[blackened death metal]] band Godless Crusade. In the winter of 2007, The Eyes of a Traitor did a headline tour with death metal act Aortic Dissection, leading to them being acknowledged by Listenable Records. This subsequently led to the signing of a 3 album deal with Listenable Records. Guitarist David McCretton left the band at this time to further his education and was replaced by an old friend of the band,  Matthew Pugh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traitor on Listenable&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.listenable.net/v2/artist_detail.php?id=63| title = The Eyes Of A Traitor's band page on Listenable Records| author = | publisher = [[Listenable Records]]| date =| accessdate = 06/09/2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 6, 2009, The Eyes of a Traitor were confirmed as main support for Gojira on the UK dates of their &quot;The Way of All Flesh Tour.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;GOJIRA On Upcoming UK Tour&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bravewords.com/news/106235| title = THE EYES OF A TRAITOR Announced As Main Support To GOJIRA On Upcoming UK Tour| author = | publisher = Bravewords.com| date = 06/02/2009 | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tour was in conjunction with the release of their debut album [[A Clear Perception]]. Shortly after the Gojira tour, The Eyes of a Traitor embarked on a 7 day headline tour with The Argent Dawn, Many Things Untold and Ignominious Incarceration. This was the start of a massive tour schedule which was to occupy them for the remainder of the year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Traitor on Listenable&quot;/&gt; On September 1, 2009, The Eyes of a Traitor released a digital single called Nothing to Offer.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Nothing To Offer Single Blog&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url =http://blogs.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=blog.view&amp;friendId=101855470&amp;blogId=505719745| title = The Nothing To Offer Single Myspace Blog|work= The Eyes of a Traitor|publisher=[[MySpace]]| date = August 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was later re-recorded for their second album ''[[Breathless (The Eyes of a Traitor album)|Breathless]]''.
