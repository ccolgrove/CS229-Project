'''KJCK-FM''' (97.5 [[FM broadcasting|FM]], &quot;Power Hits 97.5&quot;) is a [[contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] music formatted [[radio station]] owned by Platinum Broadcasting (with a sale pending to Eagle Communications), along with sister stations [[KJCK (AM)|KJCK]] &quot;1420 KJCK The Talk of JC&quot; and [[KQLA]] &quot;Q 103.5&quot;. The station is broadcast from [[Junction City, Kansas]], broadcasting on 97.5 MHz with an ERP of 100,000 kW. The station serves the [[Junction City, Kansas|Junction City]]-[[Manhattan, Kansas|Manhattan]]-[[Fort Riley]] area, as well as some portions of Northern and Central Kansas, and can be heard as far away as [[Hutchinson, Kansas]] and [[Toronto, Kansas]]. It is believed to be that the station may be the most powerful station in Kansas. KJCK is also one of the oldest stations in Kansas. KJCK-FM is currently the most listened to radio station in the market.

==History==
KJCK-FM first went on the air in July 1965 as a simulcast of [[KJCK (AM)|KJCK]]. This simulcast continued until the mid 1970s, when the formats split. 

The station was known as Power 94.5 through the 1990's and aired a [[Rhythmic contemporary]] format competing against (now sister station) [[KQLA]] &quot;Q 103.5&quot;. After that station was acquired by Power 94.5's owners (Platinum Broadcasting) in 1997, the station moved to its current [[Contemporary hit radio]] format, while [[KQLA]] moved to a satellite-fed [[Hot Adult Contemporary]] format. The station kept leaning rhythmic during this time. In 2000, the moniker was changed to &quot;The Big Kat 94.5&quot;. A year later, the station gained a competitor when [[KACZ]] &quot;Z 96.3&quot; signed on the air with the same Top 40 format.

The station moved from 94.5 to 97.5 sometime in 2003 due to moving the 97.3 frequency to [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], which cost several other stations across Kansas to change frequencies ([[Topeka]] [[country music]] station [[WIBW-FM]] currently occupies the 94.5 frequency), but retained the &quot;The Big Kat&quot; moniker after the move. 

On April 1, 2005, the station changed its name to &quot;Power Hits 97-5&quot;, which was partially intended as an April Fool's Day joke. The music direction was changed, as it started day-parting by playing more adult-friendly content (which capitalized on current mainstream pop, [[punk-rock]] and [[modern rock]] tracks (even leaning towards [[modern adult contemporary]] at times), as well as [[1990's]] tracks) during the day and playing harder-edged content (such as [[Hip hop]] and [[R&amp;B]] tracks) after 6 PM. This was done to compete against [[KACZ]], who also had an adult-leaning Top 40 format. A new morning show, Stooks In The Morning, debuted in May 2005. This show targeted people in the 18-34 demographic and was well respected across the area as it discussed edgy content and being very listener interactive.

In August 2007, the station started leaning rhythmic again, as most of the adult-friendly content was removed. This was done due to a new program director being hired, as former PD and morning show host Matt Stooks quit in June. To this day, the station still leans rhythmic, as it avoids some rock-oriented music due to sister station [[KQLA]] playing some of that material.

On October 6, 2011, Platinum Broadcasting announced it was ceasing operations, and that the station, along with its sister stations, will be sold to [[Hays, Kansas]]-based Eagle Communications, pending [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] approval. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.eaglecom.net/2011NewsReleases/KJCK-KQLAAcquisitionOct2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transmitter fire==
On March 25, 2007, at around 11 pm, KJCK went off the air due to a fire in the transmitter. The transmitter went back on a few hours later, however, the coverage area was reduced down to at least a 6 mile radius. Manhattan residents and some residents in [[Fort Riley]] were not able to pick up the station. Stooks In The Morning did a web-only show for part of the week, while on 97.5, it was a clip show. Everyone else took the day off. On Thursday afternoon/evening, the station went back to its original coverage area. Some criticized that the days they were off the air were Justin Carson's last days before moving to [[KZCH]] in [[Wichita, Kansas|Wichita]] the following week. Justin's last day was on Friday, March 30 (he returned in August 2008, but left by September 2009).

During the early morning hours of Saturday, May 19, 2007 the secondhand transformer which replaced the original transformer that had caused the fire ceased to function correctly. KJCK-FM again operated at extremely low power until the following Monday afternoon when a new transformer was installed. On January 11, 2008, the station put in a new transmitter which includes the most up to date technology.

==Competition==
Currently, Power Hits only has two competitors, [[KACZ]] &quot;Z 96.3&quot;. The other competitor is Salina-based &quot;92.7 The Zoo&quot; (KZUH-FM). That station began airing a satellite-fed format from [[Dial Global]]; they have since moved to a more local presentation.

Other competitors include [[KZCH]] in [[Wichita, Kansas]], [[KEKS]] in [[Emporia, Kansas]], and [[KMXV]] and [[KCHZ]] in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], which can be heard in different parts of Power Hits' coverage area due to their signals.

Former competitors include [[KSAL-FM]] from Salina, which changed its Top 40 format to Classic Hits in 2004.
