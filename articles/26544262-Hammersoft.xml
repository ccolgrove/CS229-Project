'''''Today with Kathie Lee and Hoda''''' (sometimes called ''The Today Show with Kathie Lee and Hoda'' or simply ''Kathie Lee and Hoda'') is the fourth-hour segment of [[NBC]]'s ''[[The Today Show]]''. This &quot;show-within-a-show&quot; has its own opening and theme music, anchors, and website.

== History of the &quot;fourth hour&quot; ==
On September 10, 2007, NBC expanded the show length to four hours, as announced on January 17, 2007, at its press tour sessions. The fourth hour was originally hosted by [[Ann Curry]], [[Natalie Morales]] and [[Hoda Kotb]] as ''Today with Ann, Natalie and Hoda''. 

NBC had aired the daytime soap opera ''[[Passions]]'' from 1999 to 2007 but had dropped it to make room on their schedule for the extended version of ''Today''. The fourth hour of ''The Today Show'' competes with [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[The View (U.S. TV series)|The View]]'' and [[CBS]]'s ''[[The Price Is Right]]'' in most markets in the Central and Pacific time zones, but most Eastern time stations air it live one hour before those programs. Not all NBC affiliates carry the new hour. The fourth hour of ''The Today Show'' is filmed and mainly broadcast at 10:00 am EST, although some affiliates air it at other times, mainly to air other syndicated talk shows or [[Infomercial#Daytime programming|locally-originated talk shows]].

On September 26, 2011, this hour began to be rebroadcast as part of what NBC formerly called their ''NBC All Night'' lineup in an overnight 2:05 a.m. ET/PT timeslot on weekday early mornings (varied according to local scheduling), as a replacement for ''[[Poker After Dark]]'', which was canceled due to [[United States v. Scheinberg|legal issues]] involving that show's sponsor [[Full Tilt Poker]] and televised poker in general.
