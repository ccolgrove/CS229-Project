Lowe's radio show can be heard on Mondays to Thursdays from 7pm to 9pm. Past and present features on his show have included:

* On Mondays, ''Fresh Meat'' is where the show's chatroom rate three songs from three upcoming bands; the winning track is played throughout the rest of the week
* ''The Hottest Record In The World this week'', where a song from a hotly-tipped band or new album is played
* ''Sunsetter'' where a more mellow track is played as the [[sun]] sets each night, (seasonal)
* ''Encore'', when listeners can [[Short message service|text in]] to request a repeat of a track that has already been played, the winning track being the track most requested. (discontinued)
* ''U-turns'', a phone-in request slot (signified by 'the screech and the beat'), also discontinued (now 'What have we missed')
* ''Crowd Rocker'', where an anthem from the past is played (discontinued)
* ''Mixtape'', a ninety minute themed mix which only broadcasts to listeners in England while the rest of the UK do their regional shows (Discontinued)
* Live performances and interviews with bands and artists

Lowe's method of [[Disc jockey|DJing]] is rather enthusiastic and fast-paced, similar to many [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] [[DJ]]s, with samples of radio stations, interview clips and Radio 1 stings thrown in between songs, along with the occasional sound of Lowe singing along to the music.

He is extremely dedicated to new music, and many of the bands or musicians who won ''Fresh Meat'' have gone on to be very successful; [[Arctic Monkeys]], [[Bloc Party]], [[The Killers]], [[Editors]], [[Kasabian]], [[The Wombats]] and [[Kaiser Chiefs]] are examples of bands who have benefited.

Zane Lowe played &quot;[[Crazy (Gnarls Barkley song)|Crazy]]&quot; by [[Gnarls Barkley]] for the first time on radio. The song was frequently played on Radio 1 thereafter, helping it to reach number one on the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 2 April 2006. &quot;Crazy&quot; was the first song in British history to go to number one based on sales of [[Music download|legal downloads]] alone; the download was made available a week before physical copies went on sale. The song also featured in Zane Lowe's TV advert, which aired in early 2006.

Prior to [[Muse (band)|Muse]] and [[Foo Fighters]] emerging onstage at their concerts at [[Wembley Stadium]], Lowe 'entertained' the crowd on DJ decks.
More recently Zane Lowe played a large role in the Festival/Large concert &quot;Warrior's Dance&quot; hosted by The Prodigy, and DJ'd two sets through the evening.

===Masterpieces===
Between 2007 and 2011, one week of Zane Lowe's show was dedicated to albums considered '[[masterpiece]]s'.  Each show focused on a different album which Lowe and his team considered to be a bonafide classic.  The first half of the show was dedicated to interviews and an in-depth look at the album's cultural impact.  In the second half of the show, the full unabridged album was played in its entirety, complete with gaps and no lyric censorship.

On 25 July 2011, his first show after the death of [[Amy Winehouse]], Zane told listeners that he had intended to make her album ''[[Back to Black]]'' a Masterpiece in a previous series, but was unable to secure an interview with the singer.
Lowe also appeared alongside other music acts The Vaccines, Darwin Deez, Union and Doorly on 7 June 2011, and again alongside Biffy Clyro, Morning Parade and Doorly on 19 July 2011 at the Mallorca Rocks hotel in Magaluf, Mallorca for the event of the same name.

During the 21 November 2011 broadcast of 'Masterpieces' featuring [[The Smashing Pumpkins]], Lowe expressed his delight at securing the opportunity to play [[Siamese Dream]] in full, stating the album to be his favourite of all time. 

On 24 November 2011, Zane Lowe announced that 2011 would be the final edition of 'Masterpieces', concluding the show with [[&quot;Hallelujah&quot;]] from [[Jeff Buckley]]'s album &lt;i&gt;[[Grace]]&lt;/i&gt;, stating that the idea of the feature originally came from the suggestion that the album &lt;i&gt;[[Grace]]&lt;/i&gt; be played on the air from beginning to end.

==Zane Lowe on MTV Two {{anchor|Gonzo}}==
Lowe started his career on [[MTV Two]] presenting shows such as ''Up 4 It'' (1997) and ''Brand:New'' (1999), and since 2002 he has presented ''[[Gonzo (TV show)|Gonzo]]'', its flagship music show, in which time the show has evolved from a two-hour random collection of presenting and clips, to a [[primetime]] (7pm) show featuring regular musical guests and interviews. The show is presented solely by Lowe, with the studio effectively being a [[bluescreen|blue screen]] and the infamous 'Brown Couch'. His presenting manner on ''Gonzo'' is more laid back than on his radio show. The show features music videos, along with news (usually ripped from the [[NME]]; Lowe can often be seen reading the news straight from the magazine) and input from the channel's message boards. The show also features mock interview done by a character called [[Ginger Bloke]], in which popular musical artists are humorously &quot;interviewed.&quot; Occasionally, moderators of the boards (chosen on Gonzo and by the members) contribute; one member even filled in for a week when Lowe was ill and unable to present.
At [[Oxegen Festival]] 2006, Zane Lowe was reportedly &quot;beaten up&quot; by Didz Hammond and Carl Barat from Dirty Pretty Things on an episode of Gonzo.   He has since said that the punch was in fact completely playful but unfortunately, and painfully, connected with his groin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TuhBJgxhjhI Zane Lowe on Dirty Pretty Things Bust-up]. YouTube (2006-11-11). Retrieved on 2011-09-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ryan Jarman==
Zane Lowe saved [[Ryan Jarman]]'s life at the 2006 [[NME Awards]], an incident [[NME]] now refers to as &quot;engraved in indie folklore&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME 26/01/08&quot;&gt;NME 26/01/08&lt;/ref&gt; Ryan's band, [[The Cribs]], accepted an award on behalf of winners, [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]]. However, on his way to collect the trophy from presenter [[Russell Brand]], Ryan dived onto the [[Kaiser Chiefs]] table and pierced his back with broken glass, narrowly missing his vital organs.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME 26/01/08&quot;/&gt; He was quickly taken to hospital but discharged himself to return for the show's party later in the night. However, his injuries were severe and he fell unconscious in a back corridor. Luckily Zane Lowe, a fellow guest at the party, came across Ryan lying on the floor and discovered he was bleeding profusely. Zane raised the alarm and Ryan received urgently needed medical attention to stop internal bleeding.&lt;ref name=&quot;NME 26/01/08&quot;/&gt;

==Awards==
Both the ''Zane Lowe Show'' and ''Gonzo'' have won numerous awards including Best Radio Show and Best TV Show respectively at the [[NME]] [[NME Awards|Awards]] 2006. Radio 1 DJ [[Chris Moyles]] has jokingly referred to &quot;The Best Radio Show&quot; award as &quot;The Zane Lowe Award&quot; due to Lowe's repeated success. Lowe continues this success by winning the Best Radio Show NME award in the 2007 and 2008 Awards.

Lowe won the Gold Award in The Specialist Music Programme Award, and Music Broadcaster of the Year categories at the 2006, 2010 and 2011 [[Sony Radio Academy Awards]].
