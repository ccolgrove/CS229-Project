'''Carlton Ernest Fisk''' (born December 26, 1947), nicknamed '''&quot;Pudge&quot;'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Carlton Fisk Statistics and History| work = statistical and professional information| publisher = Baseball Reference.com| url = http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fiskca01.shtml| accessdate = 2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''&quot;The Commander&quot;''',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Chuck| first = Bill| last2 = Kaplan| first2 = Jim| title = Walkoffs, Last Licks, and Final Outs: Baseball's Grand (and not-so-grand) Finales| place = Skokie, IL, USA| publisher = ACTA Sports| year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-87946-342-7| quote = (p. 155) Before the game played against the Texas Rangers, Fisk was given a motorcycle by his teammates and a shadowbox of homeplate by the team.  Signs like &quot;Fisk Forever&quot; and &quot;The Commander&quot; festooned the stands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a former [[Major League Baseball]] [[catcher]]. During a 24-year baseball career, he played for both the [[Boston Red Sox]] (1969, 1971â1980) and [[Chicago White Sox]] (1981â1993).

Fisk was known by the nickname &quot;Pudge&quot; due to his 6'2&quot;, 220&amp;nbsp;lb frame. He was the first player to be unanimously voted American League Rookie of the Year (1972). Fisk is best known for &quot;waving fair&quot; his game-winning home run in the 12th inning of Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]].  At the time of his retirement in 1993, he held the record for most [[home run]]s all-time by a [[catcher]] with 351 (since passed by [[Mike Piazza]]).  Fisk held the record for most games played at the position of catcher (2,226) until June 17, 2009 when he was surpassed by another &quot;Pudge,&quot; [[IvÃ¡n RodrÃ­guez]]. Fisk still holds the American League record for most years served behind the plate (24). Fisk was voted to the All-Star team 11 times and won 3 [[Silver Slugger Award]]s which is awarded annually to the best [[Batting (baseball)|offensive]] player at each [[Baseball positions|position]]. Fisk was known as a fierce competitor, a superb handler of pitchers and a natural on-field leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;baseballhall.org&quot;&gt;[http://baseballhall.org/hof/fisk-carlton Fisk Biography and Stats at Baseball Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt;  He was elected to the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|Hall of Fame]] in [[Baseball Hall of Fame balloting, 2000|2000]].

==Early life==
Fisk was born in [[Bellows Falls]], Vermont but grew up across the [[Connecticut River]] in [[Charlestown, New Hampshire]]. Fisk graduated from Charlestown High School, playing baseball for the [[American Legion]] post 37 team in Bellows Falls. At the [[University of New Hampshire]], Fisk started for the [[New Hampshire Wildcats|basketball team]], while also playing baseball.

==Professional career==
===Boston Red Sox===
{{MLBBioRet
|Image  = Bosret27.svg
|Name   = Carlton Fisk
|Number = 27
|Team   = Boston Red Sox
|Year   = 2000|}}
[[1967 Major League Baseball Draft|Drafted]] by the [[Boston Red Sox]] in {{By|1967}} as the fourth overall pick of the draft, Fisk got the call to the big leagues for two games in {{By|1969}}.  After some seasoning in the Boston minor league system and serving out a military commitment, Fisk was back with the Red Sox in {{By|1971}}, appearing in fourteen games.  Pudge broke out for the Red Sox in his first full season in {{By|1972}}. Fisk hit .293 with 22 home runs, 28 doubles and a .909 OPS.  He led the [[American League]] with nine triples (tied with [[Joe Rudi]] of the [[Oakland Athletics]]), and was the last catcher to lead the league in this statistical category.  As the result of his 1972 season, Fisk won both the [[list of AL Gold Glove Winners at Catcher|AL Gold Glove at Catcher]] and the [[Major League Baseball Rookie of the Year award|AL Rookie of the Year]] awards.

In June 1974, Fisk suffered a devastating knee injury when [[Cleveland Indians]] [[Leron Lee]] collided with him at home plate, tearing several knee ligaments.  After undergoing reconstructive knee surgery, Fisk was told he would never play again, yet the backstop returned just twelve months later to hit .331 in 1975.

====1975 World Series====
{{Main|1975 World Series}}
The defining moment of Fisk's illustrious career came in the 12th inning of Game 6 of the 1975 World Series at [[Fenway Park]]. He hit [[1975 Cincinnati Reds season|Cincinnati Reds]] pitcher [[Pat Darcy]]'s second pitch down the left field line that appeared to be heading into foul territory. The enduring image of Fisk jumping and waving the ball fair as he made his way to first base is considered by many to be one of baseball's greatest moments. The ball struck the [[foul pole]], giving the Red Sox a 7&amp;ndash;6 win and forcing a seventh and deciding game of the fall classic.

The image of him waving the ball fair changed the way baseball was televised. During this time, cameramen covering baseball were instructed to follow the flight of the ball. In a 1999 interview, [[Major League Baseball on NBC|NBC]] cameraman Lou Gerard admitted that the classic shot was not due to his own skills as a cameraman, but because he had been distracted by a nearby rat. Unable to follow the ball, he kept the camera on Fisk instead.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lowitt]], &quot;Rats! Fisk's homer&quot; St. Petersburg Times, November 23, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; This play was perhaps the most important catalyst in getting camera operators to focus most of their attention on the players themselves,&lt;ref&gt;[[Seth Mnookin]], &quot;Feeding the Monster: How Money, Smarts and Nerve took a Team to the Top&quot; pg. 40&lt;/ref&gt; and resulted in many future memorable World Series moments involving, among others, [[Kirk Gibson]] ([[1988 World Series|1988]]), [[Joe Carter]] ([[1993 World Series|1993]]), [[Edgar RenterÃ­a]] ([[1997 World Series|1997]]), and [[David Freese]] ([[2011 World Series|2011]]).

====Last years in Boston====
Fisk was among the top offensive catchers in the American League in his eight full seasons with the Boston Red Sox.  Over that time, he averaged 20 home runs and 70 RBIs per season.  His best year in Boston was in 1977 when Pudge hit .315 with 26 HRs and 102 RBI.

Fisk was reportedly among a group of several Red Sox players who lobbied Boston management for players to be paid what they deserved, which made him none too popular with [[Haywood Sullivan]], the Boston general manager.  When Fisk's contract expired at the end of the 1980 season, Sullivan in fact mailed him a new contract, but put it in the mail one day after the contractual deadline.  As a result, Fisk was technically a free agent and he signed a $3.5 million deal with the Chicago White Sox, beginning with the 1981 season.

===Chicago White Sox===
{{MLBBioRet
|Image  = SoxRetired72.PNG
|Name   = Carlton Fisk
|Number = 72
|Team   = Chicago White Sox
|Year   = 1997
|}}

Fisk was signed by the White Sox on March 18, 1981. At that time, his old number 27 was held on the White Sox by pitcher [[Ken Kravec]]. Fisk flip-flopped his old number and thus wore the unusual baseball number of 72 on his jersey. Although Kravec was traded just ten days later, Fisk retained the number 72 throughout his career with the White Sox. As the season got under way, Fisk was interviewed by the media concerning his switching teams, and joked that that &quot;after a decade with the Red Sox, it was time to change my sox!&quot;

On opening day 1981, Fisk started the season with the [[White Sox]] against his former team in [[Fenway Park]]. In the eighth inning, Fisk knocked a three-run homer to put his new team on top, 5-3.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newhampshire.com/nh-people/carlton-fisk-biography.aspx Fisk bio on newhampshire.com accessed 27 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

After joining the White Sox, he played an instrumental role in helping the [[1983 Chicago White Sox season|team]] win its first [[American League West|American League Western Division]] title in {{By|1983}}. His .289 batting average, 26 home runs, and 86 RBI, as well as his leadership on the young team, helped him to finish third in the MVP voting (behind [[1983 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] teammates [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]] and [[Eddie Murray]]).  Fisk also caught [[LaMarr Hoyt]] that season, the 1983 Cy Young award winner.

On May 16, 1984 Fisk accomplished the rare feat of [[hitting for the cycle]] in [[Comiskey Park]] against the [[Kansas City Royals]]. Fisk's triple in the bottom of the 7th inning off [[Dan Quisenberry]] was the only triple he hit in the season, joining Bill Salkeld (1945) as the only catcher in the 20th Century to hit the season's only triple in a cycle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballlibrary.com/ballplayers/player.php?name=carlton_fisk_1947&amp;page=chronology Fisk Chronology at baseballlibrary.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Injuries once again befell Fisk in the 1984 season, limiting him to just 102 games and a .231 average.  The experience led him to begin a new training regimen which he would use for the rest of his career. In his Hall of Fame induction speech, Fisk credited White Sox strength and conditioning coach Phil Claussen for his turnaround. Claussen introduced Fisk to a more scientific approach to physical conditioning which included long sessions of weight training. Fisk often credited the training program to extending his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseballhall.org/node/11305 Fisk HOF Induction Speech]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, following the advent of his new training program, Fisk had the most productive offensive year of his career. He hit 37 home runs and drove in 107 runs, both career-high numbers; the home run numbers tied [[Dick Allen]]'s 13-year White Sox single-season record. At the age of 37, Fisk tied his career high for stolen bases with 17 thefts on the year. For his performance, Fisk was voted to the All-Star team, won the Silver Slugger award and finished 13th in the A.L. MVP voting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/fiskca01.shtml Fisk stats at baseballreference.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 4, 1985 Fisk caught all nine innings of [[Tom Seaver]]'s complete game 300th career victory, which was played in [[Yankee Stadium]]. Fisk caught [[Bobby Thigpen]] as he set the then-record for most saves in a season (57) in 1990. In 2005, [[Jack McDowell]] credited Fisk as being instrumental in his development into a pitcher who won the [[Cy Young Award]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050807&amp;content_id=1161974&amp;vkey=news_cws&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cws Fisk Statue Stands Tall]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 17, 1990 in the second game of a twi-night doubleheader in Arlington, Texas Fisk broke [[Johnny Bench]]'s career home run record for catchers by hitting his 328th longball as a catcher off [[Charlie Hough]] in the top of the second inning.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1143141.html Washington Post article on Fisk HR Record]&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to end his career as the all-time leader in home runs by a catcher with 351. On May 5, 2004 [[Mike Piazza]] surpassed Fisk's record by belting his 352nd as a backstop.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/19/sports/baseball-catchers-honor-one-of-their-own.html?ref=carltonfisk NY Times article]&lt;/ref&gt; Fisk still holds the American League record for homers by a catcher.

A single in the [[1991 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1991 All-Star Game]] made him the oldest player in MLB history to collect a hit in All-Star game.

On June 22, 1993 Fisk broke [[Bob Boone]]'s record for career games caught with his 2,226th game behind the plate. Fisk was passed on this list by [[Ivan Rodriguez]] on June 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=4268084 ESPN article]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six days after breaking Bob Boone's all-time games caught record, Fisk was unceremoniously and abruptly released by the Chicago White Sox. Fisk was notified of his dismissal in his hotel room in [[Cleveland]] while on a road trip with the team. It is reported that he was ordered to turn in his equipment and fly back to Chicago immediately, and alone.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsillustrated.cnn.com&quot;&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/baseball/mlb/news/2001/03/14/sayitaintso_whitesox/#fisk Sports Illustrated article on Fisk dismissal accessed 27 March 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; Fisk was the final active position player in the 1990s who had played in the 1960s. He is one of only 29 players in baseball history to date to have appeared in Major League games in four decades.  

It is rumored that this end to Fisk's tenure in Chicago was the culmination of years of conflict with White Sox management, particularly team majority owner [[Jerry Reinsdorf]]. Fisk made mention of the fireworks between himself and Reinsdorf in his Hall of Fame induction speech.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baseballhall.org/node/11305 HOF induction speech]&lt;/ref&gt; To add insult to injury, it is reported that Fisk was thrown out of the White Sox clubhouse later that season when he stopped by to wish his teammates good luck in the playoffs.&lt;ref name=&quot;sportsillustrated.cnn.com&quot;/&gt;  

Fences began to be mended with the White Sox with the retirement of Fisk's number 72 on September 14, 1997 and the dedication of his statue in [[U.S. Cellular Field]] in 2005. In 2008, Fisk officially rejoined the White Sox team, becoming a team ambassador and part of the White Sox speaker's bureau.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080513&amp;content_id=2695276&amp;vkey=news_cws&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cws Fisk returns as ambassador]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Almost a Yankee===

After the 1985 season, the White Sox came close to trading Fisk to the New York Yankees for designated hitter [[Don Baylor]]. Baylor was unhappy with the Yankees since he did not play every day as he wanted (despite being the team's regular DH) and asked to be traded. The potential deal was complicated in that the White Sox would have to re-sign Fisk, a free agent, and that both players would have to agree to the trade. Negotiations between the two teams ended when they were unable to reach an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/14/sports/baylor-trade-talks-off.html New York Times (December 14, 1985) &quot;Baylor Trade Talks Off&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The White Sox re-signed Fisk, who remained with the club until the end of his career. During spring training in 1986, the Yankees finally traded Baylor to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for designated hitter [[Mike Easler]].

===Notable feuds===
Fisk was known for his longstanding feud with [[New York Yankees]] counterpart [[Thurman Munson]]. One particular incident that typified their feud, and the [[Yankees â Red Sox rivalry]] in general, occurred on August 1, 1973 at [[Fenway Park]]. With the score tied at 2-2 in the top of the 9th, Munson, attempting to score on [[Gene Michael]]'s missed bunt attempt, barreled into Fisk, triggering a 10-minute [[bench-clearing brawl]] in which both catchers were ejected.
As [[John Curtis (baseball)|John Curtis]] let his first pitch go, Munson broke for the plate. Michael tried to bunt, and missed. With Munson coming, the scrawny Yankee shortstop tried to step in Fisk's way, but Carlton elbowed him out of the way and braced for Munson, who crashed into him as hard as he could. Fisk held onto the ball, but Munson tried to lie on top of him to allow [[Felipe Alou]] to keep rounding the bases.

Fisk kicked Munson off him and into the air, and swiped at him with his fist. Michael grabbed Fisk, and as Curtis grabbed Munson -- his former Cape Cod League roommate -- Fisk threw Michael down with his left arm and fell to the ground. &quot;Fisk had his left arm right across Stick's throat and wouldn't let up,&quot; said [[Ralph Houk]], the Yankees manager at the time. &quot;Michael couldn't breathe. I had to crawl underneath the pile to try to pry Fisk's arm off his throat to keep him from killing Stick. All the while he had Michael pinned down, he was punching Munson underneath the pile. I had no idea Fisk was that strong, but he was scary.&quot;&lt;ref name=munson_fight&gt;{{cite news|last=Rappaport|first=Ken|title=Munson, Fisk fight|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=nmoQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=3YsDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4342,227788|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=[[The Free Lance-Star]]|date=2 August 1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In another incident typifying the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry, Fisk was also involved in an altercation with [[Lou Piniella]] during a May 20, 1976 game at Yankee Stadium. In the sixth inning of this game, Piniella barreled into Fisk trying to score on an [[Otto Velez]] single. Fisk and Piniella shoved each other at home plate, triggering another bench-clearing brawl. After the fight apparently died down and order appeared to be restored, Fisk's pitcher, [[Bill Lee (left-handed pitcher)|Bill Lee]], and Yankee third baseman [[Graig Nettles]] began exchanging words and punches, igniting the brawl anew.&lt;ref name=lee_fisk_pinella_fight&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Lee injured as Boston-Yankees brawl|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=txRJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=U4MMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1280,2265350|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=[[Youngstown Vindicator]]|date=21 May 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lee suffered a separated left shoulder in the altercation and missed much of the season.

In another incident, pro-football and pro-baseball player [[Deion Sanders]], then with the Yankees, hit a pop fly, and declined to run to first base, suspecting that the ball would be easily caught. Fisk yelled at Sanders to run the ball out and told Sanders during his next at-bat, &quot;There is a right way and a wrong way to play this game. You're playing it the wrong way. And the rest of us don't like it. Someday, you're going to get this game shoved right down your throat.&quot;&lt;ref name=deion_argument&gt;{{cite news|last=Boswell|first=Thomas|title=Fisk A Relic From Non-prime Time|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=97YzAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=124DAAAAIBAJ|accessdate=27 March 2011|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]|date=26 May 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boston Red Sox retired his uniform number 27 on September 4, 2000. He is one of eight people to have their uniform number retired by at least two teams,&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/cws/history/retired_numbers.jsp Chicago White Sox retired uniform numbers; accessed 15 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/bos/history/retired_numbers.jsp Bostoned Red Sox retired uniform numbers; accessed 15 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; and one of only three to have different numbers retired by two teams.

===The Fisk Foul Pole===
On June 13, 2005, the Red Sox honored Carlton Fisk and the 12th-inning [[home run]] that won Game 6 of the [[1975 World Series]] by naming the [[left field]] foul pole, which the famous home run contacted, the ''Fisk Foul Pole''. In a pregame ceremony from the [[Green Monster|Monster Seats]], Fisk was cheered by the [[Fenway Park]] crowd while the shot was replayed to the strains of [[Handel]]âs ''[[Messiah (Handel)|Hallelujah Chorus]]'', the song longtime Fenway Park organist [[John Kiley]] originally played following the home run. The Red Sox scheduled the ceremony to coincide with an [[interleague play|interleague]] series against the [[Cincinnati Reds]], who were making their first trip back to Fenway Park since the '75 Series. 

Thirty years later, the video of Fisk trying to wave the ball fair remains one of the game's enduring images. Game 6 is often considered one of the best games played in major league history. The crowd remembered that magical moment at precisely 12:34 a.m. ET early on the morning of Oct. 22, 1975, when Fisk drove a 1-0 fastball from Cincinnati right-hander Pat Darcy high into the air, heading down the left-field line. &quot;The ball only took about two and half seconds,&quot; recalled Fisk. &quot;It seemed like I was jumping and waving for more than two and a half seconds.&quot; Two and a half seconds later, the ball caromed off the bright yellow pole, ending one of the most dramatic World Series games ever played and giving the Red Sox a 7-6 win over the Reds in 12 hard-fought innings.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLB&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boston.redsox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20050613&amp;content_id=1088701&amp;vkey=news_bos&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=bos | title=Sox honor Fisk with left-field foul pole | year=2007 | publisher=boston.redsox.mlb.com | accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the field, Fisk threw out the ceremonial first pitch to his former batterymate [[Luis Tiant]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/06/14/a_catchy_new_name_in_left_fisk_pole/ ''A catchy new name in left: Fisk Pole'', 14 June 2005, Marvin Pave for the ''Boston Globe''; accessed 15 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; From now on, like the Pesky Pole down the right-field line, the left-field pole will officially be called the ''Fisk Foul Pole''. The idea was the inspiration of the countless fans who contacted the Red Sox about recognizing the historic moment.&lt;ref name=&quot;MLB&quot; /&gt; Fenway's [[right field]] foul pole, which is just 302 feet from the plate, is named [[Pesky's Pole]], for light-hitting former Red Sox [[shortstop]] [[Johnny Pesky]]. [[Mel Parnell]] named the pole after Pesky in {{By|1948}} when he won a game with a home run just inside the right field pole.

After the June 13 ceremony in Boston, Fisk received an honorary [[World Series]] ring from the Red Sox commemorating their [[2004 World Series]] victory.&lt;ref name=&quot;boston.com&quot;/&gt; On Saturday, August 12, 2006, the Chicago White Sox presented Fisk with another ring, this one in honor of the White Sox' [[2005 World Series|2005 championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://chicago.whitesox.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060404&amp;content_id=1383477&amp;vkey=news_cws&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=cws ''Ringing in the title: Sox get hardware'', 4 April 2006, Scott Merkin, @mlb.com; accessed 15 August 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;
