'''Yellow Magic Orchestra''' '''(YMO)''' is a Japanese [[electronic music]] band consisting of principal members [[Haruomi Hosono]] (bass and keyboards and vocals), [[Yukihiro Takahashi]] (drums and lead vocals) and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] (keyboards and vocals).&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_ymo&quot;&gt;{{Allmusic|artist|p5886|Yellow Magic Orchestra|accessdate=2009-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group began under the name &quot;Yellow Magic Band&quot; in 1977,&lt;ref name=&quot;discogs_paraiso&quot;/&gt; and then renamed itself as &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; in 1978. The band's former &quot;fourth member&quot; was [[Programming (music)|music programmer]] [[Hideki Matsutake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sound_147&quot;/&gt;

==History==
===Early years and formation (1976â1978)===
{{see also|Haruomi Hosono|Ryuichi Sakamoto|Yukihiro Takahashi|Hideki Matsutake|Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)}}

Prior to the group's formation, Sakamoto had been experimenting with [[Electronic musical instrument|electronic music equipment]] at the [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]], which he entered in 1970, including synthesizers such as the [[Buchla]], [[Moog synthesizer|Moog]], and [[ARP Instruments, Inc.|ARP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dayal_interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Dayal|first=Gheeta|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra|url=http://www.theoriginalsoundtrack.com/blog/archives/00000615.htm|work=Groove|publisher=The Original Soundtrack|accessdate=June 17, 2011|date=07/07/2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; At around the same time, Hosono had been involved in the recording of several early [[electronic rock]] records, including [[YÅsui Inoue]]'s [[Folk rock|folk]] [[pop rock]] album ''[[KÅri no Sekai]]'' (1973) and [[Osamu Kitajima]]'s [[Progressive rock|progressive]] [[psychedelic rock]] album ''Benzaiten'' (1974), both of which utilized synthesizers, electric guitars, electric bass, and in the latter, [[electronic drum]]s and [[Drum machine|rhythm machines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|2509617|äºä¸é½æ°´ â æ°·ã®ä¸ç}} ([http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;tl=en&amp;u=http://www.discogs.com/%E4%BA%95%E4%B8%8A%E9%99%BD%E6%B0%B4-%E6%B0%B7%E3%81%AE%E4%B8%96%E7%95%8C/release/2509617 Translation])&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|1303605|Osamu Kitajima â Benzaiten}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also around the same time, the band's future &quot;fourth member&quot; [[Hideki Matsutake]] was the assistant for the internationally successful electronic musician [[Isao Tomita]]. Much of the methods and techniques developed by both Tomita and Matsutake during the early 1970s would later be employed by Yellow Magic Orchestra.&lt;ref name=&quot;sound_147&quot;/&gt; Other early influences on the band included [[Kraftwerk]] and [[Giorgio Moroder]].&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_ymo&quot;/&gt; The former was particularly an influence on Sakamoto, who heard the band in the mid-1970s and later introduced them to his fellow band members.&lt;ref name=&quot;sfweekly_interview&quot;/&gt; They were impressed with Kraftwerk's &quot;very formalized&quot; style but wanted to avoid imitating their &quot;very German&quot; approach. According to Sakamoto, they were &quot;tired&quot; of Japanese musicians imitating [[Western culture|Western]] and [[Music of the United States|American music]] at the time and so they wanted to &quot;make something very original from Japan.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;sfweekly_interview&quot;/&gt; He described Kraftwerk's music as &quot;theoretical, very focused, simple and minimal and strong,&quot; contrasting it with YMO's &quot;very Japanese&quot; approach of [[Fusion (music)|fusing]] many different styles of music like a &quot;[[bento]] box.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dayal_interview&quot;/&gt; Their alternative template for electronic pop was less [[Minimalistic music|minimalistic]], made more varying use of synthesizer lines, introduced &quot;fun-loving and breezy&quot; sounds,&lt;ref name=&quot;bogdanov_565&quot;/&gt; and placed a strong emphasis on [[melody]].&lt;ref name=&quot;sfweekly_interview&quot;/&gt;

Sakamoto first worked with Hosono as a member of his live band in 1976, while Takahashi recruited Sakamoto to produce his debut solo recording in 1977 following the split of the [[Sadistic Mika Band]]. Hosono invited both to work on his [[exotica]]-flavoured album ''Paraiso'', which included [[Electronic music|electronic songs]] produced using various electronic equipment such as the [[Yamaha CS-80]] [[polyphonic synthesizer]], [[Roland Corporation|Roland]] and [[ARP Odyssey]] synthesizers, the [[List of Yamaha products|Yamaha CP-30]] and [[Rhodes piano|Rhodes]] [[electric piano]]s, and electric guitar. The band was named &quot;Harry Hosono and the Yellow Magic Band&quot; and in late 1977 they began recording ''Paraiso'', which was released in 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;discogs_paraiso&quot;&gt;{{Discogs release|1188801|Harry Hosono And The Yellow Magic Band â Paraiso}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three worked together again for the 1978 electronic album ''Pacific'', which included an early version of the song &quot;Cosmic Surfin&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|2561274|Pacific}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosono and Sakamoto also worked together alongside [[Hideki Matsutake]] in early 1978 for Hosono's experimental &quot;electro-exotica&quot; [[Fusion (music)|fusion]] album ''Cochin Moon'', which fused electronic music with [[Music of India|Indian music]] (reminiscent of [[Ravi Shankar]] and [[Filmi|Bollywood music]]), including an early &quot;synth [[raga]]&quot; song &quot;Hum Ghar Sajan&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;pitchfork&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Dominique Leone|date=July 19, 2005|title=Hosono &amp; Yokoo: Cochin Moon|publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]]|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/4016-cochin-moon/|accessdate=2011-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Sakamoto released his own solo album, ''The Thousand Knives of Ryuichi Sakamoto'', experimenting with a similar fusion between electronic music and traditional [[Music of Japan|Japanese music]] in early 1978. Hosono also contributed to one of Sakamoto's songs, &quot;Thousand Knives&quot;, in the album.&lt;ref&gt;{{Discogs release|325757|Ryuichi Sakamoto â Thousand Knives Of}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Thousand Knives'' was also notable for its early use of the [[microprocessor]]-based [[Roland MC-8 Microcomposer]] [[music sequencer]], with Matsutake as its [[Programming (music)|music programmer]] for the album.&lt;ref name=&quot;knives_cd&quot;&gt;{{Discogs release|1156483|Ryuichi Sakamoto â Thousand Knives Of (CD)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hosono, Sakamoto and Takahashi eventually collaborated again to form the Yellow Magic Orchestra and they began recording their self-titled album at a [[Shibaura]] studio in July 1978.&lt;ref name=&quot;discogs_ymo_lp&quot;/&gt;

The band was initially conceived as a one-off studio project by Hosono, the other two members being recruited session musiciansâthe idea was to produce an album fusing orientalist [[exotica]] with modern electronics, as a [[subversion]] of [[Orientalism]] and [[exoticization]], while exploring similar themes such as [[Asian people|Asianness]]. The album would eventually be called ''Yellow Magic Orchestra'', as a satire of Japan's obsession with [[black magic]] at the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_ymo&quot;/&gt; The album featured the use of computer technology (along with synthesizers) which, according to ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'', allowed the group to create a new sound that was not possible until then.&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard_1979&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=Artists and producers strive for inroads overseas|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 26, 1979|volume=91|issue=20|issn=0006-2510|page=61|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=_iQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT61|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===National and international success (1978â1983)===
{{see also|Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Solid State Survivor|XâMultiplies|BGM (album)|Technodelic|Naughty Boys|Service (album)}}

The band's 1978 self-titled album ''[[Yellow Magic Orchestra (album)|Yellow Magic Orchestra]]'', with its cutting-edge production, was very popular, and the studio project grew into a fully fledged touring band and career for its three members. Following the release of the album ''Yellow Magic Orchestra'', a live date at the Roppongi Pit Inn was seen by executives of A&amp;M Records of the USA who were in the process of setting up a partnership deal with Alfa Records. This led to the YMO being offered an international deal, at which point (early 1979) the three members decided the group would be given priority over their solo careers. The most popular international hit from the album was &quot;Firecracker&quot;, which would be released as a single the following year and again as &quot;Computer Game&quot;, which became a success in the United States and Europe.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Following an advertising deal with [[Fujifilm|Fuji Cassette]], the group sparked a boom in the popularity of electronic pop music, called &quot;Technopop&quot; in Japan,&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_ymo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lewis|first=John|title=Back to the future: Yellow Magic Orchestra helped usher in electronica â and they may just have invented hip-hop, too|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/jul/04/electronicmusic.filmandmusic11|work=The Guardian |location=UK|accessdate=May 25, 2011|date=July 4, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sarasota&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|title=Computer rock music gaining fans|journal=[[Sarasota Journal]]|date=August 18, 1980|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7s4mAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=h44EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4481,2128223|accessdate=2011-05-25|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; where they had an impact similar to that of [[The Beatles]] and [[Beat music|Merseybeat]] in 1960s Britain.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_ymo&quot;/&gt; For some time, YMO was the most popular band in Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian_ymo&quot;/&gt; A testament to the influence of YMO on fashion is how many middle-aged Japanese businessmen still have the &quot;Techno cut&quot; haircut, modeled after the group.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Successful solo act [[Akiko Yano]] (later married to Sakamoto) joined the band for its live performances in the late 1970s and early 1980s, but did not participate in the studio recordings. On the other hand, the YMO trio contributed to her own albums and became part of her live band, during these same years.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Making abundant use of new synthesizers, [[Sampler (musical instrument)|samplers]], [[music sequencer|sequencers]], [[drum machine]]s, computers and digital recording technology as it became available, as well as utilizing [[cyberpunk]]-ish lyrics sung mostly in English, they extended their popularity and influence beyond Japan.&lt;ref name=&quot;allmusic_ymo&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;sarasota&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;clashmusic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Senor Coconut|author=Paul Sullivan|work=clashmusic.com|date=01/09/2007|url=http://www.clashmusic.com/feature/senor-coconut|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Solid State Survivor]]'', released in 1979, was YMO's pinnacle recording in Japan, winning the 1980 Best Album Award in the [[Japan Record Awards]]. It featured English lyrics by [[Chris Mosdell]], whose sci-fi themes often depicted a human condition alienated by dystopic futures, much like the emerging [[cyberpunk]] movement in fiction at that time. One of the album's major singles, and one of the band's biggest international hits, was &quot;[[Behind the Mask (song)|Behind the Mask]]&quot;, which YMO had first produced in 1978 for a [[Seiko]] [[Quartz clock|quartz]] [[wristwatch]] commercial,&lt;ref name=&quot;discogs_ucymo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Yellow Magic Orchestra: UC YMO|publisher=[[Discogs]]|url=http://www.discogs.com/Yellow-Magic-Orchestra-UC-YMO/release/1282322|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then for ''Solid State Survivor'' with lyrics penned by [[Chris Mosdell]]. The song was later revised by [[Michael Jackson]], who added new lyrics in the early 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metafilter.com/82928/Behind-the-Mask-Michael-Jacksons-rarest-recording |title=Behind the Mask â Michael Jackson's rarest recording? |publisher=MetaFilter |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jackson's version was never released until his first posthumous album, ''[[Michael (album)|Michael]]'', though his additional lyrics were included in later cover versions of the song by [[Greg Phillinganes]], [[Eric Clapton]],&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymail_michael&quot;/&gt; and [[Ryuichi Sakamoto]] himself in his 1986 solo release ''Media Bahn Live''.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Their second album ''Solid State Survivor'' went on to sell over 2 million records worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hardy_1987&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Rock|author=Phil Hardy, Dave Laing, Stephen Barnard|year=1987|edition=2nd|publisher=Macdonald Orbis|isbn=0356142744|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tgcKAQAAMAAJ|edition=2|accessdate=May 25, 2011|page=476}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1980, YMO had become the most popular group in Japan, where they were performing to sold out crowds. Their first live album ''[[Public Pressure]]'' set a record in Japan, topping the charts and selling 250,000 copies within two weeks, while their next studio album ''[[XâMultiplies]]'' had 200,000 pre-orders before release.&lt;ref name=&quot;sarasota&quot;/&gt; The same year, their albums ''Solid State Survivor'' and ''XâMultiplies'' held the top two spots on the [[Oricon]] charts for seven consecutive weeks, making YMO the only band in Japanese chart history to achieve this feat.&lt;ref name=&quot;oricon_ymo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=ãã«ãã24å¹´ã¶ãã®å¿«æéæï¼|publisher=[[Oricon]]|date=August 17, 2004|url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/5122/|accessdate=2011-06-09}} ([http://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ja&amp;u=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/ranking/5122/ Translation])&lt;/ref&gt;

They also had similar success abroad, performing to sold-out crowds during tours in the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;sarasota&quot;/&gt; The single &quot;Computer Game&quot; had sold 400,000 copies in the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;sarasota&quot;/&gt; and reached No. 17 in the UK Charts. The group also performed &quot;Firecracker&quot; and &quot;[[XâMultiplies|Tighten Up]]&quot; live on the ''[[Soul Train]]'' television show. At around the same time, the 1980 song &quot;Riot in Lagos&quot; by YMO member Sakamoto pioneered the beats and sounds of [[electro music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wire_1996&quot;&gt;{{citation|title=A-Z Of Electro|work=[[The Wire (magazine)|The Wire]]|issue=145|month=March|year=1996|author=David Toop|url=http://www.thewire.co.uk/articles/210/|accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;broughton_2007&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Broughton|first=Frank|title=La historia del DJ / The DJ's Story, Volume 2|year=2007|publisher=Ediciones Robinbook|isbn=8496222799|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=1GMxP6mpRdgC&amp;pg=PA121|accessdate=May 25, 2011|page=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band was particularly popular with the emerging [[hip hop]] community, which appreciated the group's electronic sounds, and in [[the Bronx]] where &quot;Firecracker&quot; was a success and sampled in the famous ''Death Mix'' (1983) by [[Afrika Bambaataa]].&lt;ref name=&quot;wire_1996&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;buckley_2003&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=Peter|title=The rough guide to rock|year=2003|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|isbn=1843531054|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=7ctjc6UWCm4C&amp;pg=PT908|accessdate=May 25, 2011|page=901}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile in Japan, YMO remained the best-selling music act there up until 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Pioneering Production Economy in the '80s|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=May 29, 1982|volume=94|issue=21|issn=0006-2510|page=41|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=byQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PT41|accessdate=2011-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breakup and brief reunion (1984â1993)===
{{see also|Technodon}}

The band had stopped working as a group by 1984, after the release of their [[Musical film|musical]] motion picture ''Propaganda'', the three members returning to their solo careers. The group were careful to avoid saying they had &quot;split up&quot;, preferring to use the Japanese phrase meaning {{Nihongo|&quot;spreading out&quot;|æ£é|sankai}}, and in fact the trio continued to play on each other's recordings and made guest appearances at live shows. Takahashi, in particular, would play YMO material in his concerts and as &quot;lead singer&quot; was arguably best placed to do so. Meanwhile, Sakamoto would gain international success for his work as a solo artist, actor, and [[film composer]],&lt;ref name=&quot;billboard_1996&quot;/&gt; winning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]], [[Academy Award|Oscar]] and [[Golden Globe Award|Golden Globe]] awards.&lt;ref name=&quot;boston_1998&quot;/&gt;

The trio would eventually release a one-off reunion album, ''[[Technodon]]'', and credited it to 'NOT YMO' (YMO crossed out with a calligraphy X) or &lt;strike&gt;YMO&lt;/strike&gt; in 1993.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Instead of traditional vocals, about half of it features field audio recordings and samples of authors and scientists reading their work.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} During their brief reunion in the early 1990s, they continued to experiment with new styles of electronic music, playing an instrumental role in the [[techno]] and [[acid house]] movements of the era.&lt;ref name=&quot;UGO&quot;/&gt;

===Post-breakup and reformation (1994âpresent)===
{{see also|Sketch Show (band)|Rescue / Rydeen 79/07|The City of Light / Tokyo Town Pages}}
{{Ref improve section|date=February 2011}}

The early 2000s saw Hosono &amp; Takahashi reunited in a project called [[Sketch Show (band)|Sketch Show]]. On a number of occasions Ryuichi Sakamoto has joined in on Sketch Show performances and recording sessions. He later proposed they rename the group Human Audio Sponge when he participates. Barcelona performance at Sonar festival and Wild Sketch Show DVDs chronicle these reunions, and include a tongue-in-cheek Japanese text only history of the group that spans to 2036.

The band have reunited in 2007 for an advertising campaign for [[Kirin Brewery Company|Kirin]] Lager which lampooned their longevity and charted No.1 on various Japanese digital download charts (including [[iTunes Store]] chart) with the song &quot;Rydeen 79/07&quot;, released on Sakamoto's new label [[Avex Trax|commmons]]. Recently performing live as Human Audio Sponge; Hosono, Sakamoto and Takahashi did a live performance together as Yellow Magic Orchestra for the [[Live Earth (2007 concert)|Live Earth]], [[Live Earth concert, Kyoto|Kyoto event]] on July 7, 2007, which raised money and awareness of a &quot;climate in crisis.&quot;

In August 2007, the band once again reformed, taking the name HASYMO or HAS/YMO, combining the names of Human Audio Sponge and Yellow Magic Orchestra. Their first single under this name, &quot;Rescue&quot;, was written for the film [[Appleseed EX Machina]]. They released a new two song single titled &quot;The City of Light/Tokyo Town Pages&quot; on August 6, 2008. HASYMO played two live concerts in Europe in the summer of 2008, one at the [[Royal Festival Hall]], London on June 15, as part of the [[Meltdown (festival)|Meltdown]] festival of music curated by [[Massive Attack]] and another in [[Gijon]], Spain on the 19th. Although the primary YMO members (Yukihiro Takahashi, Haruomi Hosono, and Ryuichi Sakamoto) are effectively known as HASYMO and played both these concerts, these concerts were billed simply as &quot;YMO&quot; but featured only 4 YMO songs in each concert while the rest of the concert featured Sketch Show, HASYMO music and member's solo works.

In August 2009, the band played the World Happiness festival in Japan, featuring many Japanese artists. The band closed the night, and confirmed that &quot;Yellow Magic Orchestra&quot; is their official name, dropping the HASYMO title.
