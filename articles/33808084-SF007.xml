Just like the [[internet]] and [[pay TV]], the adult entertainment industry was one of the very first forms of mass media to embrace mobile devices as a new means to distribute content; with some of the earliest forays into adult [[short message service|SMS]] and the [[Mobile Web]] (WAP) as far back as 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;Justin Pearse&quot;&gt;[http://nma.co.uk/news/private-in-largest-campaign-to-push-adult-sms-services/9670.article Private in largest campaign to push adult SMS services].&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the mobile porn business expects to grow to a market value of $2.3 billion in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Widespread adoption of Apple's [[iPhone]] may encourage growth in the mobile porn industry in North America.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web

[[Google]] is building a new phone system that the company claims will support any application, presumably including porn, while [[YouTube]] is in negotiations to offer free softcore porn content on 100 million advanced cell phones.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReutersJan08&quot;&gt;{{cite web

In fact, while so-called &quot;smartphones&quot; comprised only 14% of the mobile devices sold in 2009, according to AdMob, a prominent adult ad-serving network, they generated more than 65% of the total ads served to mobile devices.  The vast majority of these devices ran [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]], Apple's iPhone operating system (OS), however other devices are now catching up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Article-News&quot;&gt;{{cite web

The North American mobile erotica market differs from Europe in that carriers are not allowing adult sites to use their billing mechanisms such as billing via premium [[short message service|SMS]], slowing market growth.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} There are sites specifically geared towards iPhone customers and do not allow the site to be viewed by non-mobile browsers.  Other business models involve offering free videos in the 'tube' style of websites. For the cost of viewing an ad, users can get free video clips. [[Verizon Wireless]] and [[Sprint Nextel Corporation]] announced in early 2008 that they plan to allow some adult content to be viewed on their networks, while working to prevent access to this content by children.  There have been expectations for some time that these companies will overcome age-verification, political, and religious challenges that have become a barrier to this market, to take advantage of the resulting increase in mobile web-surfing on their networks.&lt;ref name=ReutersJan08 /&gt;

During 2010, many [[North America]] based mobile porn sites formerly optimized for only the [[iPhone]] modified their site design to take advantage of any [[WebKit]] based browser on a mobile device. Phones such as the [[Palm Pre]] or those running on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] are examples of this type. Many third party mobile porn app stores have been released on Android to exploit the growing market. Apple chairman [[Steve Jobs]] has made it clear that no adult content would be sold from Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gawker&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==Criticisms==

There has been some criticism regarding mobile porn, with children possibly being exposed to the inappropriate and unregulated content.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Network operators have implemented age verification systems though, which demand customers who want to buy porn through their phone to be a verified adult first.

[[Sony]], the company which created the [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]], say they are unhappy with the spread of PSP porn, but claim to be unable to stop its spread.&lt;ref name=unhappy&gt;{{cite web
