The '''DharmarajaâKingswood Cricket Encounter''' is a cricket match between [[Dharmaraja College, Kandy]] (a government-run national school accommodates approximately 4500 students) and [[Kingswood College (Sri Lanka)|Kingswood College, Kandy]] (another government-run national school accommodates approximately 2500 students). It is the longest cricket match series in the central province, [[Sri Lanka]], having been played for 105 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lankapuvath.lk/index.php?view=article&amp;id=555%3Akingswood-rajans-battle-continues-&amp;option=com_content&amp;Itemid=85 Kingswood-Rajans battle continues - Lankapuwath]&lt;/ref&gt; It is also known as the &quot;Battle of the Maroons&quot; in public. The first match was played in 1893, with Dharmaraja College team captained by the great educationist, later [[Don Baron Jayatilaka|Sir Don Baron Jayathilake]], who was the principal of Dharmaraja at that time. Kingswood team was captained by A.E. Spencer. It was played at the Bogambara Stadium, [[Kandy]] which is no longer a cricket venue. But that match and some others followed were not all schoolboy matches as they included a few members of the staff of each school. The first all schoolboy Big Match was played in 1899 with J.C. de Mel captaining Dharmaraja and T.B. Marshall leading the Kingswood. It was played at the [[Asgiriya Stadium|Asgiriya international Cricket stadium]] until 2010, but starting from 2011, it is played at [[Pallekele International Cricket Stadium]].

This match is played for the prestigious T.B. Tennakoon Memorial Trophy.

==Series Summary==
Up to 2011, 106 cricket matches have been played.

The last time a decision was possible during the series, before 2011, was in 1980, when Rajans defeated Kingswoodians by nine wickets under the captaincy of Janaka Mendis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slcricket.com/index.php?topic=17778.0;wap2Kingswood-Rajans Cricket Encounter - SLCricket]&lt;/ref&gt; Last time Kingswood won a match in this series was way back in 1957 under Maurice Fernando.

Dharmaraja College registered a historic seven wicket win  under the  captaincy of Hemal Munaweera over Kingswood College on 26th of March 2011 at the Pallekale Cricket International stadium in Kandy, ending 30 years of indecision in the long history of Battle of maroons encounters.

* 1943 - First century in the series - The distinction of scoring the first century in the series goes to R. L. Arthur Alwis of Dharmaraja College. It is interesting to note that the Rajan's skipper, T. B. Talwatte, was deprived of this honour as he was injured by the Kingswood pace bowler, M. T. Jaimon and Talwatte had to leave the field temporarily during which time Arthur completed his century. Later Talwatte too completed his century. M. T. Jaimon took 5 wickets for ninety (90) runs for Kingswood. The match was won by the Rajans by an innings and 152 runs. Late J. P. Jayasena captained Kingswood.

* 1951 - Kingswood led by left-hander Shelton R. S. Perera, scored an exciting win over Dharmaraja, having had to score ten runs in six balls and one run in two balls, which they did with a ball to spare. Winning stroke was hit by the captain himself.

* 1952 - Chandra de Silva scored 158 for Dharmaraja in this match, played at Randles Hill. Asoka Perera scored 148 for Kingswood. The match ended in a draw. de Silva's 158 was the highest individual score in the series up to that date.

Fernando who was selected 'the School Boy Cricketer of the Year'. Dharmaraja was captained by D. D. T. Alwis. The Kingswood opening pair, considered the best among schools, was Maurice Fernando and Herly Jayasuriya. They put on an unbroken stand of 102 runs in the second innings enabling Kingswood to win.

* 1959 - C. Ratnavibushana scored 167 for Kingswood which erased the earlier record of 158 the highest individual score.
