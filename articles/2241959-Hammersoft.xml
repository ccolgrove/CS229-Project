'''Lloyd Wolfe Bochner''' (July 29, 1924&amp;nbsp;â October 29, 2005) was a Canadian actor, usually playing the role of suave, rich leading men.

== Career ==
At age 11, Bochner began his acting career on [[Ontario]] radio programs. He went on to garner two Liberty Awards, the highest acting honour in Canada, for his work in Canadian film and theatre. In 1951 he moved to [[New York City]] and appeared in early television series such as ''[[One Man's Family]]'' and ''Kraft Television Theatre''. In 1960, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] called with a starring role in the series ''[[Hong Kong (TV series)|Hong Kong]]'' with co-star [[Rod Taylor]]. A few years later, Bochner appeared in one of his most famous roles, that of the scientist attempting to  decipher an alien text in the classic 1962 ''[[The Twilight Zone (1959 TV series)|Twilight Zone]]'' episode &quot;[[To Serve Man (The Twilight Zone)|To Serve Man]],&quot; a part he himself spoofed years later in the comedy ''[[The Naked Gun 2Â½: The Smell of Fear]]''. In 1965, he guest starred on ABC's [[Western (genre)|western]] series ''[[The Legend of Jesse James (TV series)|The Legend of Jesse James]]'' starring [[Christopher Jones (actor)|Christopher Jones]] in the title role. Two years later, he appeared on the ABC military-western ''[[Custer (TV series)|Custer]]'' starring [[Wayne Maunder]] in the title role. He appeared twice on the long running television western ''[[The Virginian (TV series)|The Virginian]]'' in the 1960s. Bochner is also memorably smooth and malicious as the gangster Carter up against [[Lee Marvin]] in [[John Boorman]]'s seminal 1960s film noir ''Point Blank''.

Over the years, Bochner continued to portray a variety of roles in television and film, from a [[warlock]] on ''[[Bewitched]]'' to a [[homosexual]] doctor coming out at middle age in the 1977 television-movie ''Terraces'', to [[Pia Zadora]]'s abusive screenwriter husband in the camp classic film ''[[The Lonely Lady]].''  In 1960, he starred in an [[The Citadel (1960)|adaptation]] of [[A. J. Cronin]]'s ''[[The Citadel (novel)|The Citadel]]'' along with [[Ann Blyth]]. His son Paul said he &quot;almost always played a suave, handsome, wealthy villain.&quot;

=== Famous roles ===
A typical and very famous Bochner role was that of the scheming [[Cecil Colby]] on ''[[Dynasty (TV series)|Dynasty]]'', in part due to his notorious death scene (the character suffered a heart attack while having sex with [[Alexis Colby|Alexis Carrington]] ([[Joan Collins]]), and later died in his hospital bed seconds after marrying her). A few years later, Bochner planned to star as C.C. Capwell on the daytime drama ''[[Santa Barbara (TV series)|Santa Barbara]]'', but a heart attack caused his departure from the series. Bochner continued to appear in television series for the next few decades, doing frequent voiceover work for the animated cartoon version of ''[[Batman: The Animated Series]]'' and ''[[The New Batman Adventures]]''. In 1998 Bochner co-founded the Committee to End Violence, a panel designed to study the impact violent images had on culture. He was also active in Association of Canadian Radio and Television Artists and was a licensed amateur radio operator.  He joined the Stratford Festival of Canada in its first season in 1953 and spent six years there, playing Horatio in ''[[Hamlet]]'', Orsino in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'', and Duke Vincentio in ''[[Measure for Measure]]'' opposite [[James Mason]].

== Personal life and death ==
Bochner was born in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]] to a middle-class [[Jew]]ish family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2005/nov/05/guardianobituaries.usa | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Christopher | last=Reed | title=Lloyd Bochner | date=November 5, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Ruth Roher Bochner, a concert pianist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | publisher=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=October 5, 1956 | page=26 | title=Births | quote=at [[Women's College Hospital]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=elli&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=On The Air|pages=4|publisher=Drummondville Spokesman|date=1950-03-24|url=http://news.google.ca/newspapers?id=04swAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OEMDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3435,595408&amp;dq=un-me-air&amp;hl=en|accessdate=2010-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; until his death of [[cancer]] on October 29, 2005, at the age of 81 at home in [[Santa Monica, California]].
