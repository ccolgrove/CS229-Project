'''Merrill Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; McPeak''' (born January 9, 1936) was the 14th [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]]. He retired from the service on November 1, 1994.

==Education==
McPeak was born in [[Santa Rosa, California]]. After graduating from [[Grants Pass High School]] in [[Grants Pass, Oregon]], he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[economics]] from [[San Diego State College]] in 1957 and became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] fraternity. He was [[officer (armed forces)|commissioned]] through [[AFROTC]], and entered [[active duty]] in November of that year. He later earned a [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|Master of Arts]] degree in [[international relations]] from the [[George Washington University]] in 1974. He also learned Latin, French and various other languages at Harvard University.

==Military career==
After completing preflight and pilot training, he flew fighter [[F-100 Super Sabre]] and [[F-104 Starfighter]] aircraft in operational squadrons in the United States and in the [[United Kingdom]]. Later he returned to the U.S. as an instructor pilot and weapons officer at [[Luke Air Force Base, Arizona]].

From December 1966 to December 1968, McPeak was assigned as a solo and lead solo pilot with the [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbirds]], the Air Force's acrobatic flying team. While with the Thunderbirds he performed in nearly 200 air shows in the U.S. and overseas.

Upon completion of his tour with the Thunderbirds, he was assigned as an F-100 pilot with the [[37th Tactical Fighter Wing]] at [[Phu Cat Air Base]] in the [[South Vietnam|Republic of Vietnam]]. On February 1, 1969, he was assigned to Project Commando Sabre (Detachment 1, [[416th Tactical Fighter Squadron]]), known as the ''Misty'' FACs, a specialized group of high speed [[forward air controller]]s trying to stop traffic down the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. He became the tenth commander of Commando Sabre on April 22, 1969, and moved it to the 31st Tactical Fighter Wing at [[Tuy Hoa Air Base]] on May 1, when the 37th TFW transitioned to [[F-4 Phantom II]]s. Rotating out of his command on May 31, 1969 after 98 missions, he served as chief of standardization and evaluation for 31st Wing. McPeak completed a total of 269 combat missions while in Vietnam, remaining in-country until 1970, after which he attended the [[Armed Forces Staff College]] in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

From 1970-73 McPeak was an air operations staff officer for the Mideast Division at Headquarters USAF in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]]. After graduating from the [[National War College]] in 1974, he was named assistant deputy commander for operations for the 1st Tactical Fighter Wing at [[MacDill AFB, Florida]]. He later (1975â76) was a military fellow with the [[Council on Foreign Relations]] in New York City.

In 1976, McPeak contributed an article to ''Foreign Affairs Journal'' expressing his views on the Israelis' occupation of territories during the [[Six-day war|1967 Arab-Israeli War]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19760401faessay10180/colonel-merrill-a-mcpeak/israel-borders-and-security.html ''Israel:Borders and Security''] Article preview ''Foreign Affairs'' retrieved 2008-03-25&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1976, he became commander of the 513th Combat Support Group based at [[RAF Station Mildenhall]]; a year later he moved to [[Zaragoza Air Base]] in [[Spain]] as vice commander of the 406th Tactical Fighter Training Wing. From 1978-80, he was assistant chief of staff for current operations, Allied Air Forces Central Europe (in [[Boerfink]], [[West Germany]]). 1980-81 saw him commanding the [[20th Tactical Fighter Wing]], based at [[RAF Station Upper Heyford]]. McPeak was chief of staff at [[USAFE]] headquarters from 1981â82, and deputy chief of staff for plans at TAC headquarters, [[Langley AFB, Virginia]] from 1982-85. He returned to Headquarters USAF in 1985-87 as deputy chief of staff for programs and resources.

In June 1987, McPeak moved to [[Bergstrom AFB, Texas]] in the dual roles of [[12th Air Force]] commander and commander of Air Forces for [[United States Southern Command]]. A year later he was named commander-in-chief of Pacific Air Forces [[PACAF]]. He was appointed [[Air Force Chief of Staff]] by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George H.W. Bush]] in October 1990, replacing the retiring General [[Michael Dugan (USAF officer)|Michael Dugan]].

[[File:Gen Merrill McPeak 1993.jpg|thumb|Gen. McPeak in the redesigned Air Force Service Dress Uniform used 1993-1994]]
McPeak took over as Chief of Staff during the run-up for [[Gulf War#Operation Desert Shield|Operation Desert Shield]], and assisted in overall strategic planning for [[Gulf War|Operation Desert Storm]]. His tenure also saw major reduction in force as a result of the end of the [[Cold War]]; during his time as Chief of Staff, he oversaw the disbandment of [[Strategic Air Command]], [[Air Force Systems Command]] and [[Air Force Communications Command]], with assets transferred primarily to [[Air Combat Command]], [[Air Mobility Command]], [[Air Force Materiel Command]] and the [[Air Force Communications Agency]]. McPeak pushed through major organizational change, aimed at streamlining and emphasizing operations and combat readiness. Much of his tenure focused on elevating the status of the fighter pilot, frequently at the expense of other flying and non-flying career fields. He also created the Air Force Expeditionary Wing concept, a fusion of combat forces and support into a single organization. He also transferred several command billets to Brigadier Generals even though previously these had been commanded by Colonels.

However, he is best remembered by many Air Force personnel for the sweeping changes made to the service dress uniform.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}} Worn by more personnel during most duties, the new version was a radical departure from the earlier version, which was essentially the same as the US Army service uniform (the US Air Force was originally the [[US Army Air Corps]]). Because of its resemblance to both Naval officer's uniforms and those of airline pilots, the McPeak uniform was unpopular with service members, especially the senior enlisted corps, who still to this day object to the uniform change, and was obsoleted rapidly after McPeak retired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark |last=Thompson |authorlink=Mark Thompson (reporter) |title= A Veep on a White Horse? |url=http://www.time.com/time/politics/article/0,8599,1813768,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=2008-06-12 |accessdate=2008-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

McPeak also acted as [[Secretary of the Air Force]] for three weeks in 1993, during an interim before the formal appointment and confirmation of [[Sheila E. Widnall]], as of that date becoming the only person to have ever concurrently served in both capacities. McPeak continued as Chief of Staff through October 1994, retiring afterwards.
&lt;!-- (remarked out until cited His legacy as Chief of Staff has been the subject of much debate. Many accuse him of trying to run the Air Force as a corporation {{Fact|date=March 2008}}, with his introduction of [[Total Quality Management]] and the uniform changes which strayed from the traditional military style. Some of his uniform changes were soon undone after his retirement. He was often accused of ignoring the needs of enlisted men, and looking out solely for his officers. There was a large debate over the somewhat traditional act of inducting the outgoing chief of staff into the [[Order of the Sword (United States)|Order of the Sword]]. {{Fact|date=March 2008}}General McPeak was relieved of command by G.H.W.Bush @ the start of GulfWarI. McPeak had made intemperate remarks about targeting Saddam Hussein under the United Nations order 666. As Air Force Chief of Staff, he had no command authority in the Central Command Theater. He was retained as a special advisor by Secretary of Defense Cheney for the requisite pendancy of his tenure in the 4-star rank until retirement{{Fact|date=March 2008}}.--&gt;

==Post-military career==
Following his Air Force career, McPeak entered the private sector as a consultant and business executive. He has been on the boards of directors for [[TWA]], ECC International, where he served for several years as Chairman, [[Tektronix]], [[U.S.I.A.]] of [[St. Helens, Oregon|St. Helens]], [[Oregon]] as advisory board chairman, and other organizations. McPeak and his wife Elynor currently reside in [[Lake Oswego, Oregon|Lake Oswego]], [[Oregon]]. She served as a member of the Lake Oswego City Council.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.oswego.or.us/council/cbios.htm Lake Oswego Council Biographies]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, McPeak served as Oregon state chairman for the [[Bob Dole]] for President campaign. During the [[U.S. presidential election, 2000|presidential election of 2000]] McPeak endorsed [[George W. Bush]] and served as co-chairman of Oregon Veterans for Bush.&lt;ref name=&quot;wweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news

As the military and foreign policy of the Bush administration coalesced, however, McPeak expressed strong objections, especially with regard to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref name=ORI&gt;[http://www.oregonlive.com/special/iraq/index.ssf?/special/iraq/0327mcpeak.html ''Iraq after Saddam: Text of interview with Gen. Merrill A. &quot;Tony&quot; McPeak''] ''The Oregonian'' 2003-03-27 retrieved 2008-03-25&lt;/ref&gt; McPeak later openly campaigned for [[Howard Dean]]'s nomination, and when Dean withdrew, acted as an adviser for the [[John Kerry]] campaign. He was also one of twenty-seven signatories to the statement of the &quot;[[Committee of Diplomats &amp; Commanders for Change]]&quot; calling the [[George W. Bush|Bush]] Administration a failure at &quot;preserving national security&quot; and calling for Bush not to be re-elected.{{Citation needed|date=March 2008}}

McPeak worked as a co-chair on [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential campaign during the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 United States presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;[http://www.militarytimes.com/news/2008/03/ap_mcpeak_032408/ McPeakâs McCarthyism comments draw fire]&quot;, March 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

McPeak was appointed in July 2010 to the [[American Battle Monuments Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abmc.gov/commission/commissioners.php&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Current events==
{{Criticism section|date=May 2010}}

===Israel===
McPeak was harshly criticized by ''[[American Spectator]]'' journalist [[Robert Goldberg]] for comments and writings he has made regarding [[Israel]].&lt;ref name=GB&gt;Goldberg, Robert [http://www.spectator.org/dsp_article.asp?art_id=12937 ''McPeak on Display''] ''American Spectator'' 2008-03-24 retrieved 2008-03-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Goldberg begins the piece saying that &quot;McPeak has a long history of criticizing Israel for not going back to the 1967 borders as part of any peace agreement with [[Arab states]]. In 1976 McPeak wrote an [http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19760401faessay10180/colonel-merrill-a-mcpeak/israel-borders-and-security.html article] for [[Foreign Affairs]] magazine questioning Israel's insistence on holding on to the [[Golan Heights]] and parts of the [[West Bank]].&quot;&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

Goldberg writes that &quot;[in] recent years McPeak has echoed the [[John Mearsheimer|Mearsheimer]]-[[Stephen Walt|Walt]] view that American Middle East policy is being controlled by Jews at the expense of America's interests in the region.&quot;&lt;ref name=GB/&gt; Goldberg then quotes McPeak responding to a question as to what is the cause for the lack of progressing in getting Israelis and Palestinians together: &quot;New York City. Miami. We have a large vote -- vote, here in favor of Israel. And no politician wants to run against it.&quot;&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

Goldberg also wrote that McPeak &quot;claims that a combination of Jews and [[Christian Zionists]] are manipulating U.S. policy in Iraq in dangerous and radical ways.&quot;&lt;ref name=GB/&gt; To support this claim, Goldberg quotes McPeak from a published interview: &quot;Let's say that one of your abiding concerns is the security of Israel as opposed to a purely American self-interest, then it would make sense to build a dozen or so bases in Iraq. Let's say you are a born-again Christian and you think that Armageddon and the rapture are about to happen any minute and what you want to do is retrace steps you think are laid out in [[Book of Revelation|Revelations]], then it makes sense. So there are a number of scenarios here that could lead you in this direction. This is radical....&quot;&lt;ref name=GB/&gt;

====McPeak's response====
:More than 30 years ago, ... I wrote a Foreign Affairs published an article now being circulated in the blogosphere as evidence of an alleged anti-Israel point of view. Some commentators reach farther, suggesting that since I have been an active supporter of Barack Obama's presidential bid he, too, is anti-Israel. Both these assertions fall flat after any objective reading of the historical record.

:I am a long-time admirer (and think myself a friend) of Israel. In the early 1970s, I played a key role in getting advanced weaponry released to the Israeli Air Force -- capabilities it later put to active use. During that period, I made many official visits to Israel and established close relationships there. These contacts turned out to be useful during Operation Desert Storm, when, as chief of staff of the U.S. Air Force, I worked with my Israeli counterparts to help defend Israel from Iraqi Scud missile attacks.

:I was a vocal opponent of the George W. Bush Administration's decision to invade Iraq, a strategic blunder made worse by slapdash execution. As we have seen, this star-crossed action took our eye off the ball in Afghanistan, breathed new life into a moribund al Qaeda, and enhanced Iranian influence in this critical region -- all outcomes which damaged both the United States and our ally Israel.

:It is my view and hope that Israel will have our continued support. I wish it every success. Of course, what Israel regards as success is up to it to decide. But for friends like me, &quot;success&quot; means a secure Israel at peace with neighbors who recognize and respect its existence. Even so, we should maintain our special relationship and help Israel keep its qualitative military edge.

:As for the article, much has changed in 32 years and much has not. The essential argument holds: no set of realistically achievable geographic borders produces safety for Israel. Rather, the security requirement is that any of the territory taken in the Six-Day War and given back as part of a peace settlement should be effectively demilitarized. Of course, the Sinai Peninsula was returned to Egypt long ago in exactly this way, resulting in relative quiet along Israel's southern border and creating a fundamental shift in the regional balance of forces. This opportunity was not skillfully exploited, so the result has been a &quot;cold peace.&quot; But it is nevertheless peace and has served the interests of both sides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foreignaffairs.org/20080331faupdate87277/merrill-a-mcpeak/how-to-secure-israel.html ''How to Secure Israel Demilitarized land for peace is the key to a settlement''] ''Foreign Affairs Journal'' 2008-03-31 retrieved2008-04-08&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former President Clinton===
McPeak also generated controversy following comments he made at a Barack Obama campaign appearance in [[Medford, Oregon]] where he implied that former [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] had appeared to question Obama's patriotism:
&lt;blockquote&gt;As one who for 37 years proudly wore the uniform of our country, I'm saddened to see a president employ these tactics, he of all people should know better because he was the target of exactly the same kind of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statesmanjournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2008803230326 ''Obama takes message to Southern Oregon''] ''The Statesman-Journal'' 2008-03-23 retrieved 2008-03-25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

McPeak also compared the former President's comments to actions by [[Joe McCarthy|Senator Joe McCarthy]]: &quot;I grew up, I was going to college when Joe McCarthy was accusing good Americans of being traitors, so I've had enough of it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.breitbart.com/article.php?id=D8VIB4QO0&amp;show_article=1 ''Obama Aide: Clinton Like McCarthy''] Breitbart.com 2008-03-24 retrieved 2008-03-26&lt;/ref&gt;

===East Timor===
According to journalist [[Allan Nairn]], General McPeak oversaw the delivery of advanced U.S. fighter planes to [[Suharto]]'s government not long after the November, 1991 shooting of pro-independence demonstrators known as the [[Dili massacre]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article18991.htm Allan Nairn interviewed by Amy Goodman]&lt;/ref&gt;
