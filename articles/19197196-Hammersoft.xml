MV ''Westward'' is NRHP listing #07000304, listed April 12, 2007. Accessed online 6 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Westward'' was modeled after a salmon cannery [[ship's tender|tender]] and constructedâaround a 1923 [[Atlas-Imperial]] [[diesel engine]]âat the Martinolich Shipyard on [[Maury Island]] near Seattle. It was designed to travel the [[Inside Passage]] along the [[British Columbia]] coast to [[Alaska]]. Its construction marked a turning point in Geary's career: previously he had built workboats; from this time he built yachts.&lt;ref name=Sabella2 /&gt;

In its early years, expeditions on the ''Westward'' were hunting expeditions, with &quot;a Norwegian whale gun shooting [[harpoon]]s fitted with time fuse bombs, a [[horsepower|10-horse]] gasoline [[winch]] with thirty-six hundred feet [1097 meters] of quarter-inch [0.6 cm] plow steel cable as a fishing line, and all of the accessories for 'scrapping it out' with fifty-ton [about 45 metric tonnes] whales&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sabella1 /&gt; These expeditions were led by Church's son Campbell Church, Jr., who founded The Alaska Coast Hunting and Cruising Company. The Churches ended up owning numerous notable motor yachts. Besides the ''Westward'' were the ''Nooya'', ''Deerleap'', ''Caroline'', ''Alarwee'', ''Acania'', ''Onawa'', ''Malibu'', ''Cadrew'', ''Electra'', ''Olympus'', and ''Taconite''. Campbell Jr. made extensive films of his journeys.&lt;ref name=Sabella2 /&gt;

Among the many people who have traveled aboard the ''Westward'' are  [[A. C. Gilbert]], inventor of the [[Erector Set]], [[George Eastman]] (of [[Eastman Kodak]]), banker [[Paul Mellon]], George Pabst of [[Pabst Brewing Company]], investor [[E.F. Hutton]] and his wife [[Marjorie Merriweather Post]], [[Walt Disney]], [[John Wayne]], [[Phil Harris]], [[Fibber McGee &amp; Molly]] and [[Amos &amp; Andy]].&lt;ref name=MCNews /&gt;

During World War II, the ''Westward'' was pressed into military service. Don Gumpertz bought the ''Westward'' in 1967 and circumnavigated the globe in it in the 1970s. Current owner Hugh Reilly, once the owner of a fleet of [[fishing trawler]]s in the Alaska seafood industry (coincidentally named Westward Trawlers), bought the ''Westward'' in 1993. From 1997 to 2004 he returned it to its roots as a vessel for Alaska tourism (minus the blood sports). He then put the boat through a major refitting before taking it on a two-year tour of the Pacific, from which he returned in early September 2008. After a brief visit to [[Puget Sound]], he plans next to take it down the West Coast to Mexico and then in May 2009 to cross to head for the [[Oceania|South Pacific]].&lt;ref name=Sabella2 /&gt;

The ''Westward'' is still powered by its original 1923 Atlas-Imperial diesel engine.&lt;ref name=Sabella2 /&gt;
