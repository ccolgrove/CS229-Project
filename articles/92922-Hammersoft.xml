The '''St Kilda Football Club''', nicknamed '''The Saints''', is an [[Australian rules football]] club based in [[Melbourne]], [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Australia]].  The club plays in the [[Australian Football League]], the sport's premier league.

The club was established in 1873 and its name originates from the Melbourne suburb of [[St Kilda, Victoria|St Kilda]]. St Kilda were a foundation team of the [[Victorian Football Association]] (VFA) in 1877 and later, in 1897, became a foundation team in the [[Australian Football League|Victorian Football League]] (VFL), which was renamed the [[Australian Football League]] (AFL) prior to the start of the 1990 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;TheClubs&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The Clubs|editor=Ross, John &amp; Hutchinson, Garrie|publisher=Penguin Books|year=1998|page=321|isbn=978-0-670-87858-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being a foundation team in the league, St Kilda have only won a single premiership, a famous one-point win in the [[1966 VFL Grand Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last=Gleeson | first=Michael | url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/rfnews/that-one-point-in-1966-as-never-seen-before/2009/09/02/1251570754023.html | location=Melbourne | work=The Age | title=That one point in 1966, as never seen before â RFNews â theage.com.au | date=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Kilda have, however, had various other achievements including, most recently, being the [[List of AFL Minor Premiers|minor premiers]] of the [[2009 AFL season]]&lt;ref name=&quot;stats.rleague.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stats.rleague.com/afl/seas/2009.html#lad|title=2009 Season Scores and Results â Ladder|work=AFL Tables|date=2009 00:00:00|accessdate=2009-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[2009 AFL Grand Final|2009]] and [[2010 AFL Grand Final|2010]] grand finalists.

St Kilda developed a reputation as perennial underachievers,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/news/business/two-saints-punting-on-a-different-path/2007/10/05/1191091366658.html Two Saints punting on a different path] by Mark Hawthorne for The Age, 6 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; much of this attributed to their record of [[List of Australian Football League wooden spoons|finishing last]] more often than any other club in the league,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fullpointsfooty.net/St_Kilda_part_1.htm St Kilda]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as having the second lowest all-time win percentage of any team still playing in the league.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afl.allthestats.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=47:all-time-ladder&amp;catid=34:all-time&amp;Itemid=56 All time ladder]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{details|History of the St Kilda Football Club}}
{{Cleanup|section|date=September 2010}}

===1873â1915: Early years===
====1873: Establishment====
The St Kilda Football Club was formed on 2 April 1873,&lt;ref&gt;'' The Argus'', 14 April 1873&lt;/ref&gt; containing many elements of the previous '''South Yarra Football Club''' which had disbanded a year earlier.  Soon after a decision was made to amalgamate St Kilda FC with nearby '''Prahran Football Club'''. St Kilda retained their colours, name and ground, as well as picking up a number of Prahran players.&lt;ref name=&quot;saints.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Holmesby|first=Russell|title=A History of the Saints|url=http://www.saints.com.au/History/AHistoryoftheSaints/tabid/13686/default.aspx|publisher=Official St Kilda Website}}&lt;/ref&gt; St Kilda competed as a senior club in the VFA from 1877 to 1879, 1881â1882 and 1886â1896 before moving into the breakaway competition â The Victorian Football League â from 1897 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportingpulse.com/assoc_page.cgi?client=1-118-0-0-0&amp;sID=54554&amp;news_task=DETAIL&amp;articleID=4834479&amp;sectionID=54554 History of the VFL: 1877 â 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

====1897: Joining the VFL====
St Kilda were one of the eight clubs that took part in the inaugural [[1897 VFL season|VFL season]] in 1897. They made their debut in an away game against [[Collingwood Football Club|Collingwood]] on  8 May 1897, which they lost 2.4. (16) to 5.11. (41).

The club's first home ground was the [[Junction Oval]] in the suburb of St Kilda in Melbourne and the club's first home game was against [[Fitzroy Football Club|Fitzroy]]. The score was St Kilda 3.8. (26) to 10.6. (66).

St Kilda's early years in the VFL were not successful and, in 1899, they had the lowest score ever recorded in a VFL/AFL match, one point against Geelong (who scored 162).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jim Main]], ''Aussie Rules For Dummies'' (2nd edition, 2008) p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, [[Charlie Baker (footballer)|Charlie Baker]] became the first St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 30 goals.

====1907: First finals series====
Six successive wins at the start of the [[1907 VFL season|1907 season]] saw St Kilda make the finals for the first time, qualifying third with nine wins and eight losses.

St Kilda were beaten by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]] in their first VFL final by 56 points. They qualified in third position again in [[1908 VFL season|1908]] and were once again eliminated by Carlton in the semi-finals, this time by 58 points.

====1913: First grand final====
The 1913 season saw major improvement in which the team qualified fourth, but were eventually beaten in the [[1913 VFL Grand Final|1913 grand final]] by Fitzroy. At the time a challenge system was in place, which allowed the team that qualified in first position as minor premiers to challenge any team that won through to be the top ranked team in the finals series if it was not the minor premiers. St Kilda won its semi-final against [[Sydney Swans|South Melbourne]] and then defeated Fitzroy two weeks later 10.10. (70) to 6.9. (45) in what was a match between the two teams that won the semi-finals. Fitzroy as minor premiers were allowed to challenge St Kilda â the number one ranked team in the finals series at that point â and the two teams played again the following week in the grand final which Fitzroy won 7.14.(56) to 5.13.(43).

Due to [[World War I]] the St Kilda Football Club was in recess in 1916 and 1917 but resumed in 1918 and fared well, making the finals in fourth position but were eliminated by Collingwood in a semi final by nine points, 58 to 49.

===1918â1939: Between the wars===
====1925: First Brownlow Medallist====
[[Colin Watson (footballer)|Colin Watson]] became the first St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the [[Brownlow Medal]].

The following years saw St Kilda establish itself as a more consistently competitive club. They made the finals in [[1929 VFL season|1929]] and were eliminated once again by [[Carlton Football Club|Carlton]], 12.9 (81) to 11.7,  (73) in the semi-finals.

====1930s====
In 1936, [[Bill Mohr]] became the second St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season.

Bill Mohr kicked 101 goals in [[1936 VFL season|1936]] and was the first St Kilda player to kick 100 goals or more in a season.

The mid 1930s saw the club consistently vying for finals berths, finally making it in [[1939 VFL season|1939]] by qualifying fourth after a record run of eight consecutive victories and an overall record of 13 wins and five losses.&lt;ref name=&quot;saints.com.au&quot;/&gt;  The team had its first finals win since 1913, against [[Richmond Football Club|Richmond]], but were eliminated in the 1939 finals series by Collingwood in the preliminary final.

===1940s and 1950s===
St Kilda won three of the first four games early in the [[1940 VFL season|1940 season]] and were on top of the ladder after Round 4 before finishing second last.  Although there were some prominent players like [[Harold Bray]], [[Keith Drinan]], [[Peter Bennett (footballer born 1926)|Peter Bennett]] and later [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]], St Kilda were rarely competitive in the 1940s. The [[1950 VFL season|1950 season]] saw St Kilda win the first five games before fading to finish with eight wins and a draw in ninth place. In 1955, after one of the club's worst seasons, [[Alan Killigrew]] was appointed coach.  His first action was one of the largest clean-outs of players in the history of any VFL club. It is believed that only 17 players from 1955 played for St Kilda again in 1956, with 11 new players appearing in the club's opening match of 1956.

In 1956 [[Bill Young]] became the third St Kilda player to be the league's leading goalkicker in a home and away season with 56 goals.

====1957â1959: Consecutive Brownlow Medallists====
In 1957, [[Brian Gleeson]] became the second St Kilda player to win the league's highest individual award, the Brownlow Medal.

In 1958, [[Neil Roberts (Australian footballer)|Neil Roberts]] became the third St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.

Also in 1958 St Kilda won the [[1958 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series competition]], a competition that was played between clubs that had failed to qualify for the premiership season finals series. St Kilda defeated Carlton 16.13 (109) to 15.11 (101) in the final.

In 1959, [[Verdun Howell]] became the fourth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal.

Howell tied with [[Bob Skilton]] in the 1959 Brownlow Medal count. At the time Skilton was awarded the medal on count-back. The league later decided to award a Brownlow Medal to any player who was eligible to win who tied on the same number of votes as a winner who won on count-back â with Verdun Howell receiving a Brownlow retrospectively.

In 1961, after finishing sixth in 1960, [[Allan Jeans]] was appointed coach.  St Kilda qualified for the final four for the first time since 1939, qualifying third with eleven wins and seven losses.  However, with fullback Verdun Howell unfit, the club lost to [[Western Bulldogs|Footscray]] in the first semi-final.  The club finished ninth in [[1962 VFL season|1962]] with nine wins and nine losses.

In 1964, St Kilda were defeated in the final of the [[1964 Night Series Cup|Consolation Night Series]] competition by Footscray 11.12 (78) to 11.7 (73).

St Kilda had a convincing sequence of six consecutive wins in the last six rounds of the [[1963 VFL season|1963 season]] to qualify in fourth position with 13 wins (52 premiership points), two premiership points behind minor premiers [[Hawthorn Football Club|Hawthorn]]. The club lost to [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]] in the semi-finals.

===1960â1973: Successful era===
====1964: Farewell to the Junction Oval====
St Kilda's final home game for premiership points at the [[Junction Oval]] was the Round 18 match on 22 August 1964 against [[Geelong Football Club|Geelong]]. St Kilda won 12. 18. (90) to 11. 12 (78) in front of a crowd of 37,100.&lt;ref&gt;[http://stats.rleague.com/afl/teams/stkilda/allgames_vn.html#6 AFL Tables â St Kilda All Games â By Team]&lt;/ref&gt;

====1965: First minor premiership====
Prior to the start of the [[1965 VFL season|1965 season]], the club moved to a new training, administration and home game base at [[Moorabbin Oval]] in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. The first home game at the new home ground was a 6 point win over Collingwood 8. 12. (60) to 8. 6. (54) in front of a massive crowd of 51,370.

St Kilda finished the home and away season a game clear on top with 14 wins and 4 losses, qualifying for a finals series in first position as minor premiers for the first time in the club's history.

St Kilda defeated Collingwood in the second semi-final to progress into the grand final. The club finished second in the 1965 premiership season after being beaten by [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] 14.21 (105) to 9.16 (70) in the [[1965 VFL Grand Final]].

[[Ian Stewart (Australian rules footballer)|Ian Stewart]] became the fifth St Kilda player to win the Brownlow Medal. Stewart tied on votes with [[Noel Teasdale]] of [[North Melbourne Football Club|North Melbourne]] and was awarded the 1965 Brownlow on a count-back.

====1966: First premiership====

Continuing financial pressures and defeats saw the club remain in the bottom three for every season from 1979 to 1986.

In [[1987 VFL season|1987]], with [[Tony Lockett]] at full forward, St Kilda moved out of the bottom three for the first time since [[1982 VFL season|1982]] with nine wins.

St Kilda won the first 19 games of the 2009 season, breaking the club record of 10 successive wins which was set in the first 10 games of the 2004 season.  The winning streak was brought to end by Essendon in Round 20 when they defeated the Saints by two points. An after-the-siren shot at goal which would have won the game for St Kilda was missed by [[Nick Riewoldt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Witham|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.afl.com.au/news/newsarticle/tabid/208/newsid/82826/default.aspx|title=Essendon stuns St Kilda|work=AFL.com.au|date=16 August 2009|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Club symbols==
===Jumper===
The original colours of the St Kilda Football Club are red, white and black. In the club's early years, from 1873 to 1896, the players wore a thinly striped red, white and black jumper which was also used in selected games during 2004 and 2005. It later changed to thicker red, white and black stripes. In 1915 St Kilda changed its colours to red, yellow and black due to red, white and black being the national colours of the [[German Empire]] during the [[First World War]]. The German [[Weimar Republic]] ironically chose red, yellow and black for the national colours following the war. 

In 1923 the club returned to using the club's original colours of red, white and black.  The club crest first appeared on the jumper in approximately 1933. In 1953 the Saints' jumper took the look of the three stripes; red, white and black which have been used up until today, except for a period from 1997 to 2001 in which a stylised jumper based on the club crest was worn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footyjumpers.com www.footyjumpers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

The St Kilda jumper is three vertical stripes of red, white and black on the front with the club crest.  The back is black with white numbers.  From 2008 the jumper's sponsor is [[Jeld-Wen]], a windows and doors company.  Jeld-Wen's logo also appears on the jumper.

===Logo===
In 1977 the VFL introduced official logos for the first time.  Prior to 1977 logos were generally done by outside companies for sales of merchandise but were in no way official.  All the club's logos were printed on shields and had navy blue top halves to represent the league. In 1980 the St Kilda logo had the border replaced with the club colour of red.  In 1989 the logo changed to include the then AFL logo and the St Kilda crest sitting on the point posts.

In 1995 the club dropped the shield logo style and began using the club crest which first appeared on the St Kilda jumper about 1933. The St Kilda Football Club crest is one of the features of the Saints' jumper and is a symbol of the club.

The logo also includes the club's motto, ''Fortius Quo Fidelius'', which is [[Latin]] for Fortitude along with Fidelity (Strength Through Loyalty).

===Song===
The club song is sung to the tune of &quot;[[When The Saints Go Marching In]]&quot; &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.footy.com.au/dags/songs/saints.html St. Kilda Saints Club Song]&lt;/ref&gt; and was recorded in 1972 by the Fable Singers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brodie|first=Will|title=AFL tunes to remember|url=http://www.theage.com.au/afl/afl-news/afl-tunes-to-remember-20100723-10nyh.html|date=23 July 2010|work=The Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''Oh when the Saints, ''&lt;br /&gt;
''Go marching in,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Oh when the Saints go marching in,''&lt;br /&gt;
''Oh how I want to be with St Kilda,''&lt;br /&gt;
''When the Saints go marching in.''

Until 1964, when St Kilda played at the Junction Oval, the club song at every match was an adaptation of &quot;I Do Like To Be Beside The Seaside&quot;. When the club moved to Moorabbin Oval a popular chant called &quot;We are the Saints&quot; was sung by supporters. In the late 1960s &quot;When The Saints Go Marching In&quot; eventually became established as the club song. The tune is used by permission under license.

The club's training and administration base remained at Moorabbin Oval after home games ceased being played there. The club's final home game for premiership points at Moorabbin Oval was in Round 20, 1992.

Moorabbin Oval was extensively renovated to provide training, administration and entertainment facilities within the Huggins Stand and a heritage museum. Moorabbin Oval remains the club's training, administration and entertainment base. The G.G. Huggins Stand has three internal floors that contain player rooms, a fully equipped player gymnasium, football department meeting rooms, administration offices, a membership department, gaming room and bar, the Trevor Barker Room (a function room with a bar), club shop, trophy and memorabilia display areas and other facilities.

In 2010 construction was completed on a new additional training and administration property at Seaford in the City Of Frankston, approximately 21&amp;nbsp;kilometers from Moorabbin Oval. The new facilities were completed a cost of approximately 9.5 million dollars and was named the Linen House Centre under a naming rights sponsorship deal.
