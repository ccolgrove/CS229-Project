==History==
[[File:Brick Hall, Maine State College, Orono, from Robert N. Dennis collection of stereoscopic views.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Brick Hall (1871), later renamed Oak Hall, burned in 1936]]
UMaine was founded in 1862 as a function of the [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|Morrill Act]], signed by President [[Abraham Lincoln|Lincoln]]. Established in 1865 and originally named the Maine College of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts, the Maine College opened on September 21, 1868, changing its name to the University of Maine in 1897.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=The First Century: A History of the University of Maine, 1865-1965 |last=Smith |first=David C. |publisher=University of Maine at Orono Press |year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1871, curricula had been organized in Agriculture, Civil Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and electives. The Maine Agricultural and Forest Experiment Station was founded as a division of the university in 1887. Gradually the university developed the Colleges of Life Sciences and Agriculture (later to include the School of Forest Resources and the School of Human Development), Engineering and Science, and Arts and Sciences. In 1912 the Maine Cooperative Extension, which offers field educational programs for both adults and youths, was initiated. The School of Education was established in 1930 and received college status in 1958. The School of Business Administration was formed in 1958 and was granted college status in 1965. Women have been admitted into all curricula since 1872. The first master's degree was conferred in 1881; the first doctor's degree in 1960. Since 1923 there has been a separate graduate school.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cutler.umaine.edu/about/history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:UMaine StevensHall.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Stevens Hall]]
Near the end of the 19th century, the curriculum was expanded to place greater emphasis on [[liberal arts]]. As a function of this shift in focus new faculty hired during the early 20th century included [[Caroline Colvin]], chair of the history department, and the first woman in the nation to head a major university department.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honors.umaine.edu/community/the-honors-campus/colvin-hall/caroline-colvin/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1906, [[The Senior Skull Honor Society]] was founded to &quot;publicly recognize, formally reward, and continually promote outstanding leadership and scholarship, and exemplary citizenship within the University of Maine community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umaine.edu/orientation/traditions.htm#skull&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16, 1925, 80 women met in Balentine Hall - faculty, alumnae, and undergraduate representatives - to plan a pledging of members to a new honorary organization. This organization was called &quot;The All Maine Women&quot; because only those women closely connected with the University of Maine were elected as members. On April 22, 1925, the new members were inducted into the honor society.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umainealumni.com/feed.php?num=6&amp;feed_id=51&amp;news_id=157&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973, the [[Wilde Stein Alliance for Sexual Diversity]] was founded as one of the first gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender student organizations in the United States and the first in the state of Maine.&lt;ref&gt;http://mainecampus.com/2005/04/11/wilde-stein-open-house-highlights-groups-services-to-umaine/&lt;/ref&gt;

When the University of Maine System was incorporated, the school was renamed by the legislature over the objections of the faculty to the University of Maine at Orono (or UMO). This was changed back to the University of Maine in 1986.

==Organization and administration==
UMaine is the flagship of the University of Maine System.&lt;ref name=UMSUMaine/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;96CHEG&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.gov/spo/economics/docs/publications/30and1000.pdf |title=How to Build a Knowledge-based Economy in Maine and Raise Icnomes to the National Average by 2010 |publisher=Maine State Planning Office |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.maine.edu/pdf/umprescri.pdf |title=Next President}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://catalog.umaine.edu/content.php?catoid=49&amp;navoid=551 |title=President's Message |publisher=Undergraduate Catalog, University of Maine}}&lt;/ref&gt; The senior administration of the university consists of President Paul W. Ferguson,&lt;ref name=WABIFerguson&gt;http://www.wabi.tv/news/21516/first-day-for-new-president-at-umaine&lt;/ref&gt; Provost Sue Hunter, Vice-President for Administration Janet Waldron, Vice-President for Research Michael Eckhardt, and Dean of Students Robert Dana.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine4h.maine.edu/about/administration.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The senior administration governs cooperatively with the Chancellor of the University of Maine system, Richard L. Pattenaude&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine.edu/chancellor/index.php?section=4&lt;/ref&gt; and the sixteen members of the University of Maine Board of Trustees (of which fifteen are appointed by the Governor of Maine and one is the current Maine State Commissioner of Education). The Board of Trustees has full legal responsibility and authority for the university system. It appoints the Chancellor and each university President, approves the establishment and elimination of academic programs, confers tenure on faculty members, and sets tuition rates/operating budgets.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.maine.edu/board/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;

UMaine is also one of a handful of colleges in the United States whose Student Government is incorporated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umaine.edu/handbook/SOrg/student_government.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Student Government was formed in 1978 and incorporated in 1987. They are classified as a 501(c)(3) not for profit corporation.&lt;ref name=MEICS&gt;{{cite web|url= http://icrs.informe.org/nei-sos-icrs/ICRS?CorpFilings=19880274ND|title= Corporate Name Search:University of Maine Student Government, Inc.|accessdate= 2009-05-11|publisher = Maine Bureau of Corporations, Elections, and Commissions}}&lt;/ref&gt; It consists of a legislative branch, which passes resolutions, and an executive branch, which helps organize on-campus entertainment and guest speakers, works with new and existing student organizations, and performs other duties. Other organizations fall under the umbrella of Student Government Inc., including representative boards, community associations, and many other student groups. [[The Maine Campus]], the student newspaper, is also incorporated and does not operate under or receive money from student government.

The center of the campus is occupied by the University of Maine Mall, an open grassy area between the Raymond H. Fogler Library and the University Memorial Field House. The mall is further bordered by one residence and five academic halls. The campus is essentially divided into three sections (northern, southern, and hilltop),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umaine.edu/locator/&lt;/ref&gt; all of which are within close proximity to (or border directly on) the mall. The northern section includes many of the athletic facilities, including the [[Alfond Arena]](ice hockey), [[Alfond Stadium (University of Maine)|Morse Field at the Alfond Sports Stadium]] (field hockey, football, track and field), [[Larry Mahaney Diamond]] (baseball), Kessock Field (softball), and the Mahaney athletic/recreational dome. Other buildings that occupy the northern section of campus include the Cutler Health Center, two administrative halls, three residence halls, and multiple academic halls. The southern section of campus includes the Memorial Student Union, the Maynard F. Jordan Observatory, Lengyel Gymnasium and Athletic Field, the Buchanan Alumni House, as well as multiple administrative, residence, and academic halls.

The baseball team has participated in seven [[College World Series]], six of them under coach [[John Winkin]] between 1976 and 1986, and one under Jack Butterfield in 1964. The Black Bears achieved two third-place finishes in 1964 and 1982.

The official [[fight song]] of UMaine is the âStein Songâ.  Written by Lincoln Colcord (words) and E. A. Fenstad (music), the tune rose to fame when [[Rudy Vallee]] arranged the current version.  Vallee attended Maine from 1921â1922 before transferring to [[Yale University|Yale]], and his popularity helped make the song a national favorite.  To this day, the &quot;Stein Song&quot; remains the only college fight song to ever reach number one on the pop charts, achieving this distinction in 1930.&lt;ref name=top40hits1930&gt;

In addition to varsity athletics, the university offers many club sports through its Campus Recreation department.  Sport clubs represent UMaine by competing against teams and clubs from other universities and colleges. National governing bodies for each club provide competition guidelines and league structure.

Sport clubs are student led and student administered. Each has a budget that is run through Campus Recreation, which in part funds nearly all clubs. Clubs are eligible for funding through Campus Recreation after they have been active for at least one year and have a membership minimum of ten members. Current club sports include [[alpine skiing]], [[baseball]], [[Rowing (sport)|crew]], [[cricket]], [[cycling]], fast pitch [[softball]], [[field hockey]], [[golf]], [[ice hockey]], [[lacrosse]], [[nordic skiing]], [[roller hockey]], [[Rugby football|rugby]], shotokan [[karate]], [[soccer]], [[table tennis]], tackle [[American football|football]], [[ultimate (sport)|ultimate]], and [[volleyball]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.umaine.edu/campusrecreation/programs/clubs/clubs_about.html&lt;/ref&gt;
