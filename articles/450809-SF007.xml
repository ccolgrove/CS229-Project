'''DNA Lounge''' is a late-night, all ages [[nightclub]] in the [[SoMa]] district of [[San Francisco]] owned by [[Jamie Zawinski]], a former [[Netscape]] programmer and [[open-source]] software [[hacker (free and open source software)|hacker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=From Netscape to Nightclub | work=Wired Magazine | date=2001-07-16 | url=http://www.wired.com/news/culture/0,1284,45264,00.html | author=Evany Thomas | accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The club features [[DJ]] dancing, live music, [[American burlesque|burlesque]] performances, and occasionally conferences, private parties, and film premieres. It is located at 375 Eleventh Street, near Harrison Street.

The club consists of a large main dance floor and stage, surrounded on three sides by a balcony, open to below. There is also a back room with its own dance floor and separate sound system. There are three full [[Bar (establishment)|bars]], and a full kitchen, serving Mexican food. DNA Lounge also has a number of unconventional features, including a free [[wireless network]] for [[internet]] access. The club also provides continuous audio and video [[webcasts]] of all events free of charge.

From 2001 through 2009, the club also provided several publicly accessible [[computer]] terminals (running [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora]]). They were eventually removed due to maintenance difficulties, and a belief that the prevalence of internet-enabled [[Smartphone|phones]] made them obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge blog entry about kiosks | date=2009-07-05 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/07/05.html | accessdate=2009-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

[[File:DNAsoundCheck.jpg|thumb|right|Sound check, 2009]]

The venue first opened for business in 1977 as a [[Leather subculture|leather bar]] called ''Chaps'', owned by Chuck Slaton.

In 1985 it was purchased by Jim English, Jeff Mason, and Brian Raffi who opened for business under the name '''DNA Lounge''' on November 22, 1985. The name was rumored to be an acronym for &quot;dancing, not art&quot;. The earliest regular DJs were Ted Cousens, Adam Fisher, and Brian Raffi. One of the early [[Bouncer (doorman)|doormen]] was Doc Martin, who later became a popular [[house music]] DJ. Some nights were genre-specific, with both live bands and DJs. Notable nights and resident DJ's included DJs Blackstone (who spun [[hip-hop]] and [[Rapping|rap]] on Wednesday nights), DJ Damon (who spun alternative and industrial) and Kelly Spencer (who played [[Punk rock|punk]] and [[New Wave music|new wave]] on Tuesdays). Many of DNA's posters and flyers were designed by the San Francisco-based artist, [[Rex Ray]]. There were wildly psychedelic, fluorescent murals of strange and twisted monsters with stretched perspectives on the otherwise black downstairs walls and a black and white motif in the upstairs VIP lounge that was painted by celebrated late graffiti artist [[Keith Haring]].

During the early 90s, the DNA offered a black membership card for $10 that offered free entry most nights. Employees got a gold card which allowed up to four guests at no charge, and there was a rumored 'platinum' card that was said to be a free pass to unlimited entry, guests, and drinks. It hosted many rave-themed nights with acts including Right Said Fred, the Hardkiss Brothers and Tasti Box, and afterhours events such as Lift- it was an important venue in San Francisco rave history. The DNA Lounge was also one of the few bars in San Francisco that would serve the [[Flaming Dr Pepper]], an ignited drink.

In 1994, the club was purchased by Tim Dale, John Schneider, and comedian/actor [[Rob Schneider]]. From 1995 until 1998, the DNA was a popular late-night destination, featuring unpublicized shows by such top pop musicians as [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] and [[Metallica]], and weekend dance parties headlined by retro bands Grooveline and the M-80s. But, starting in 1996, the Schneiders had to devote the bulk of their time to Rob's TV sitcom [[Men Behaving Badly (U.S. TV series)|Men Behaving Badly]]. They left the daily operations of the club to subordinates, and it fell into disrepair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge: Ancient History: 1906-1998 | date=2000-12-13 | url= http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/1906-1998.html#1994 | accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The club was purchased by [[Jamie Zawinski]] in 1999. The club was closed for extensive remodeling and [[soundproofing]] from April 1999 until it re-opened on [[Friday the 13th|Friday]], July 13, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge set to reopen tomorrow; New owner brings top technology | work=San Francisco Chronicle | author=James Sullivan | date=2001-07-12 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2001/07/12/DD161466.DTL | accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Zawinski purchased the pizza restaurant next door to DNA Lounge, renaming it DNA Pizza, and announcing his plans to expand DNA Lounge into that space, combining the two businesses into a single all-ages nightclub, restaurant and cafe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge blog entry: &quot;Wherein the Empire Expands&quot; | date=2011-02-16 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2011/02/16.html | accessdate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Conflict with local regulatory agencies ===

During the period that DNA Lounge was closed, Zawinski spearheaded a successful [[grassroots]] effort to maintain its late-night permits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Free the Night Life! | work=Salon | author=Andrew Leonard | date=2000-02-10 | url= http://dir.salon.com/tech/feature/2000/02/10/zawinski/index.html | accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; facing opposition from several neighbors and the [[San Francisco Police Department|SFPD]], but was unable to procure an all-ages license. In September 2008, after two and a half years of legal battles, the club's operating permits were successfully modified to allow patrons of all ages, instead of only those 21 years of age or older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge blog entry about permit change | date=2008-08-18 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2008/08/18.html | accessdate=2009-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control]] (ABC) launched an investigation against the club in 2009, resulting in an accusation of &quot;running a disorderly house injurious to the public welfare and morals&quot;, and asking for permanent revocation of the club's liquor license, which would result in the club closing permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge blog entry about ABC accusations | date=2009-02-13 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/02/13.html | accessdate=2009-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The accusations pertain to lewd behavior at certain gay and lesbian events which no longer take place at the club. Members of the community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gay party venue fights to remain open | work=Bay Area Reporter | author=Matthew S. Bajko | date=2009-02-26 | url=http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=3744 | accessdate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; were outraged by the ABC's allegations and the severity of their proposed punishment. Many complained that ABC was unfairly targeting DNA lounge, and their homosexual clientele in particular, pointing out that the specific allegations are far less &quot;lewd&quot; than the standard behavior at heterosexual strip clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The ABC's New Anti-Gay Crusade? ABC's recent targeting of LGBT events at the DNA Lounge is a tragic non-surprise. | work=San Francisco Bay Guardian | author=Violet Blue | date=2009-02-26 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/g/a/2009/02/26/violetblue0226.DTL | accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC has not commented on this accusation. Many have claimed that ABC's punishment is in retaliation to DNA's successful appeal to receive an all-ages liquor license, and that this appears to be part of a larger shift in policy by the ABC to crack down on all-ages music venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=State goes after legendary all-ages music clubs | work=San Francisco Chronicle | author=Marisa Lagos | date=2009-04-11 | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/11/MNK217038L.DTL | accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, ABC ruled to revoke DNA Lounge's liquor license. DNA promptly filed an appeal citing insufficient evidence in the ABC's case as well as challenging the constitutionality of ABC's code&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=California Code of Regulations | url=http://www.abc.ca.gov/LawsRulesReg.html | accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that pertain to regulating sexual behavior and morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge blog entry about filing of appeal | date=2009-04-11 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/04/11.html | accessdate=2009-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA Lounge remained in business, pending resolution of their appeal, and they have set up a legal defense fund soliciting donations to help offset the cost of contesting the decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/donate/ | title=Legal Defense Fund | work=DNA Lounge | date=2009-02-22 | accessdate=2009-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 10, 2009, a settlement was announced, reducing the revocation of their license down to a 25-day suspension, effective January 4, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2009/11/10.html | title=DNA Lounge blog entry regarding settlement | date=2009-11-10 | accessdate=2009-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==

DNA Lounge won &quot;Best Dance Club&quot; in the [[San Francisco Bay Guardian]]'s &quot;Best of the Bay&quot; readers' poll in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Best of the Bay 2008 | work=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=2008-07-29 | url= http://www.sfbg.com/bob/2008/ent.php | accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 2009&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Best of the Bay 2009 | work=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=2009-07-29 | url= http://www.sfbg.com/printable_entry.php?entry_id=8921 | accessdate=2009-08-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Best of the Bay 2010 | work=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=2010-07-27 | url= http://www.sfbg.com/specials/best-bay-2010-readers-poll-arts-and-nightlife | accessdate=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and , 2011,&lt;ref name=&quot;botb11&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Best of the Bay 2011 | work=San Francisco Bay Guardian | date=2011-07-27 | url=http://www.sfbg.com/specials/best-bay-2011-readers-poll-arts-and-entertainment | accessdate=2011-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;Best Bar Staff&quot; in 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;botb11&quot; /&gt; A number of regular DNA Lounge events are perennial winners as well, including [[Bootie (club night)|Bootie]] (&quot;Best Party Producers&quot;, &quot;Best Dance Party&quot;), [[Smash-Up Derby]] (&quot;Best Cover Band&quot;), [[Hubba Hubba Revue]] (&quot;Best Burlesque&quot;), [[Bohemian Carnival]] (&quot;Best Circus Troupe&quot;), [[Trannyshack]] (&quot;Best Drag Show&quot;), [[Bearracuda]] (&quot;Best Club for Queer Men&quot;) and [[Fog City Wrestling]] (&quot;Best Body Slams&quot;).

On November 22, 2010, the date of DNA Lounge's 25th anniversary, the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]] issued a resolution proclaiming that day to be &quot;DNA Lounge Day&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA Lounge Day&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2010/11/22.html | title=Board of Supervisors Proclamation, &quot;DNA Lounge Day&quot; | date=2010-11-22 | accessdate=2010-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;to convey the City's sincere respect for their ability to successfully run an entertainment business for the past 25 years.&quot;

On the same day, San Francisco [[Mayor of San Francisco|Mayor]] [[Gavin Newsom]] presented the club with a Certificate of Honor, stating that the club &quot;contributes to the rich cultural history of San Francisco's entertainment scene and our beloved historic South of Market District.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DNA Lounge Day&quot; /&gt;

== Live music ==

DNA Lounge has been well known for both DJ dance nights and live concerts. Since the club was purchased by Zawinski, they have been focusing more on live music,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge blog entry about live music | date=2007-04-18 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2007/04/18.html | accessdate=2009-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2008 they procured an all-ages liquor license to facilitate this. Currently, dance events are generally 21+, but most live shows are all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge | date=2009-02-26 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/ | accessdate=2009-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Concert highlights since 1985&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Bands that have performed at DNA Lounge | date=2010-12-06 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/ledger.html | accessdate=2010-12-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=DNA Lounge Calendar: 1985-1999 | date=2009-04-04 | url=http://www.dnalounge.com/calendar/1985-1999.html | accessdate=2009-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; include:
