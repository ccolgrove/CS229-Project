The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Kansas City Chiefs]] season''' was the franchise's 49th season, and third with head coach [[Herman Edwards]] at the helm. The Chiefs failed to improve on their 4-12 record from 2007 with the youngest team in the NFL as part of their &quot;youth movement.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Several '08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Thigpen to start&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interesting list&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Interesting list of suitors for Hall | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/blog/index?entryID=3687123&amp;name=clayton_john | last=Clayton | first=John | work=ESPN | date=2008-11-06 | accessdate=2008-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The season turned out to be the worst in the franchise's history, by tallying 13 losses for the first time ever.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pennington-led&quot;/&gt; The Chiefs' final 2-14 record was the worst in franchise history.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson wants&quot;/&gt;

Entering the season, the Chiefs were unsure if injury-prone [[quarterback]] [[Brodie Croyle]] could be their quarterback of the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;Several '08&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Several '08 picks should make immediate impact | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?columnist=williamson_bill&amp;id=3448409 | last=Williamson | first=Bill | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2008-06-18 | accessdate=2008-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chiefs reorganized their offense to focus around Croyle, but his season-ending injury in Week 7 led to a new [[spread offense]] gameplan focused around [[Tyler Thigpen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Thigpen to start&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Croyle out&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Breaking the Mold&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Spread changes&quot;/&gt;

Following the Chiefs' dismal 2007 season, head coach [[Herman Edwards]] and general manager [[Carl Peterson]] were considered to be on the hot seat.&lt;ref name=&quot;Several '08&quot;/&gt; Peterson and Edwards were considered to be safe unless absolutely zero progress was made in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Several '08&quot;/&gt; Chiefs chairman [[Clark Hunt]] had expressed his expectations of a winning Chiefs team earning a playoff berth in 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hunt expects&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3201970 | title=Hunt expects Chiefs to challenge for playoffs in 2008 | agency=Associated Press | publisher=ESPN.com | date=2008-01-17 | accessdate=2008-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Departures====
In February, the Chiefs released WR [[Eddie Kennison]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs cut loose&quot;&gt;Associated Press.

[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3500590 Wesley agrees to one-year, $730K contract with Raiders] ''ESPN.com'', 22 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In October, Kansas City released LB [[Napoleon Harris]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3646811 Injury-depleted Vikings agree to deal with Harris, agent confirms 16 October 2008.]&lt;/ref&gt; and K [[Nick Novak]].&lt;ref name=&quot;change kickers&quot;/&gt;

====Failed signings====
The Chiefs were as aggressive as NFL rules allowed them to be in pursuing C [[Jeff Faine]] and K [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]], both of whom signed with teams on the first day of free agency.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bucs, Rams&quot;&gt;[http://www.fannation.com/truth_and_rumors/view/44400 Bucs, Rams anger Edwards] ''Kansas City Star'', 25 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; NFL rules prohibit teams from contacting prospective free agents or their agents until free agency begins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bucs, Rams&quot;/&gt; In 2008, that time was 11&amp;nbsp;p.m. on February 28.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bucs, Rams&quot;/&gt; &quot;There were probably some deals done before (the start of the league year),&quot; Edwards said when asked why the Chiefs didn't get in the game with either player. &quot;We didn't cheat. We abided by the rules. That's how you're supposed to do it, and that's what we did.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bucs, Rams&quot;/&gt;

Following the season-ending injury to QB [[Brodie Croyle]], the Chiefs contacted recently-retired QB [[Daunte Culpepper]] and free agent QB [[Bruce Gradkowski]].&lt;ref name=&quot;change kickers&quot;/&gt; Culpepper acted as his own agent and asked for &quot;preposterous&quot; contract terms, which caused many teams to cancel talks, including Kansas City.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culpepper drops&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Sources: Culpepper drops visit with Chiefs | url=http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/8728262/Sources:-Culpepper-drops-visit-with-Chiefs | last=Glazer | first=Jay | work=Fox Sports | date=2008-10-28 | accessdate=2008-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culpepper agreed to meet with the Chiefs on October 28 for a physical and face-to-face negotiations but canceled the meeting in favor of other opportunities with the NFL.&lt;ref name=&quot;Culpepper drops&quot;/&gt;

===Jared Allen trade===

In February, the Chiefs placed the franchise tag on DE [[Jared Allen]] to prevent him from hitting the free agent market before the teams agree on a long-term deal.&lt;ref name=&quot;tag on Allen&quot;/&gt; In April, reports surfaced detailing a proposed trade between Kansas City and the [[Minnesota Vikings]] which would send Allen to Minnesota in exchange for additional selections in the [[2008 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs keeping options&quot;&gt;Associated Press. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3353557 Chiefs keeping options open with Pro Bowl end Allen] ''ESPN.com'', 18 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Other teams that had contacted Allen's agent include the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Glazer, Allen&quot;&gt;Glazer, Jay.

[http://sports.aol.com/fanhouse/2008/04/22/could-eagles-trade-for-chiefs-jared-allen/ Could Eagles trade for Chiefs' Jared Allen?] ''AOL Sports'', 22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Allen was not tagged as an exclusive rights franchise player and had the right to visit and negotiate with other teams.&lt;ref name=&quot;Status of DE&quot;&gt;[http://kcchiefs.com/news/2008/04/17/chiefs_statement_on_the_status_of_de_jared_allen/ Chiefs statement on the status of DE Jared Allen] ''KCChiefs.com'', 17 April 2008. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chiefs [[general manager]] [[Carl Peterson]]'s relationship with Allen had been strained ever since Peterson, in the wake of Allen's [[Drunk driving (United States)|DUI]] convictions, described him as &quot;a young man at risk.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs keeping options&quot;/&gt; Allen, who could be suspended for a season if he has another alcohol-related episode, had said he would not negotiate with Kansas City if he did not get a contract done by July 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs keeping options&quot;/&gt; Allen had previously voiced his wish to stay with the Chiefs.&lt;ref name=&quot;tag on Allen&quot;/&gt;

On April 22, the Chiefs and Vikings reached an agreement on a trade package, and at roughly the same time, Allen reached an agreement in principle on a contract with the Vikings. Upon reaching the contract agreement, Allen headed to the airport and left for Minnesota.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen to Vikes&quot;&gt;Clayton, John. [http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3362701 Sources: Chiefs agree to send franchise player Allen to Vikes] ''ESPN.com'', 22 April 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources said the Vikings included a second third-round pick (No. 73) in the 2008 draft to get the deal done. They had been offering a No. 1 pick (17th in the first round) and a No. 3 (No. 82). The teams also swapped spots in the sixth round with the Vikings getting a better spot in the sixth round, sources said.&lt;ref name=&quot;Allen to Vikes&quot;/&gt;

===2008 NFL Draft===
The Chiefs chose fifth overall in the [[2008 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs secure&quot;&gt;[http://kcchiefs.com/news/2008/02/22/chiefs_secure_fifth_overall_selection_in_2008_nfl_draft/ Chiefs secure fifth overall selection in 2008 NFL Draft] ''KCChiefs.com'', 22 February 2008. {{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A coin flip held at the [[NFL Scouting Combine]] determined the tie-breaker between the Chiefs, Falcons, and Raiders.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press.

Kansas City was interested in [[defensive end]] [[Chris Long (American football)|Chris Long]] following the departure of [[Jared Allen]], but ended up with [[Glenn Dorsey]] after he slipped to #5 overall. Kansas City had Dorsey rated higher than Long,&lt;ref name=&quot;Draft grades&quot;&gt;Czarnecki, John.

Regardless of concern from NFL scouts about a previous leg injury to Dorsey which may cause him to get surgery in the near future, Kansas City selected Dorsey fifth overall.&lt;ref name=&quot;Draft grades&quot;/&gt; Dorsey and OT [[Branden Albert]], Kansas City's other first-round selection, were considered by some to be the best players in the entire Draft.&lt;ref name=&quot;Several '08&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Chiefs' Day 1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Draft yields&quot;/&gt;

Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Titans, the Chiefs flew to [[Giants Stadium|The Meadowlands]] for a Week 8 duel with the [[New York Jets]].  Due to the season-ending injuries to QB's [[Brodie Croyle]] and [[Damon Huard]], [[Tyler Thigpen]] made his second career start.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnson will not play&quot;/&gt; Thigpen became the starting quarterback by default.&lt;ref name=&quot;Breaking the Mold&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Breaking the Mold | url=http://kcchiefs.com/news/2008/11/13/breaking_the_mold/ | last=Rand | first=Jonathan | work=Kansas City Chiefs official website | date=2008-11-13 | accessdate=2008-11-14|archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20090110191420/http://kcchiefs.com/news/2008/11/13/breaking_the_mold/ |archivedate = January 10, 2009|deadurl=yes}} &lt;/ref&gt;

The momentum started to change when the Buccaneers ran a punt return for a touchdown and added a late field goal to cut the deficit to a 24-13 margin.  In the fourth quarter, Tampa Bay picked up a late touchdown on a fumble to bring the game to a 27-25 deficit.  They converted the two-point conversion to tie the game at 27-27.  In overtime, the Buccaneers systematically ran the ball to the 30-yard line and then kicked the winning field goal to capture a 30-27 victory.

The Chiefs took an early lead on a 30&amp;nbsp;yard pass from [[Tyler Thigpen]] to [[Mark Bradley]].  The Chiefs defense continued to show improvement in the red zone, limiting the Chargers to two field goals instead of two touch downs.  At the end of the first half, Thigpen threw a pass to 34&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass to [[Tony Gonzalez (tight end)|Tony Gonzalez]]. However, the extra point snap was botched and an attempt at a quick pass failed.

The Chargers controlled the second half better than the first, scoring two touchdowns and leading the Chiefs by 7 at the end of the fourth quarter.  The Chiefs' final drive ended with a 3&amp;nbsp;yard touchdown pass to Gonzalez. A 1-point PAT would tie the game. However, [[Herm Edwards]] told Thigpen to go for two, explaining in a post-game interview that the defense was too beat up for overtime play.  The resulting two-point conversion ended in an incomplete pass.  The Chiefs lost by one point.

With the loss, Kansas City fell to 1-8.
