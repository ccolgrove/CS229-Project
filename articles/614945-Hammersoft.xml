<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="614945" ns="0" title="Member states of the League of Nations"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">Between 1920 and 1946, a total of 63 countries became '''[[member states]] of the [[League of Nations]]'''.  The Covenant forming the League of Nations was included in the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and came into force on 10 January 1920. The League of Nations was dissolved on 18 April 1946, when its assets and responsibilities were transferred to the [[United Nations]]. 

The Leagueâs greatest extent was from 28 September 1934 (when [[Ecuador]] joined) to 23 February 1935 (when [[Paraguay]] withdrew) with 58 members. At this time, only [[Costa Rica]] (22 January 1925), [[Brazil]] (14 June 1926), the [[Empire of Japan]] (27 March 1933) and [[Germany]] (19 September 1933) had withdrawn and only [[Egypt]] was left to join (on the 26 May 1937). The members (listed from earliest joining and alphabetically if they joined on the same day) at this time were [[Argentina]], [[Australia]], [[Belgium]], [[Bolivia]], the [[British Empire]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], the [[Republic of China]], [[Colombia]], [[Cuba]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Denmark]], [[El Salvador]], [[France]], [[Greece]], [[Guatemala]], [[Haiti]], [[Honduras]], [[British Raj|India]], [[Italy]], [[Liberia]], the [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Nicaragua]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Paraguay]], [[Persia]]/[[Iran]], [[Peru]], [[Poland]], [[Portugal]], [[Romania]], [[Siam]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], [[Switzerland]], the [[Union of South Africa]], the [[United Kingdom]], [[Uruguay]], [[Yugoslavia]], [[Venezuela]], [[Austria]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Finland]], [[Luxembourg]], [[Albania]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Hungary]], [[Irish Free State|Ireland]], [[Ethiopia]], the [[Dominican Republic]], [[Mexico]], [[Turkey]], [[Iraq]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Ecuador]].

Of the 42 founding members, 23 (or 24, counting [[Free France]]) remained members until the League of Nations was dissolved in 1946. A further 21 countries joined between 1920 and 1937, but 7 left, withdrew or were expelled before 1946.

Countries are listed under the year in which they joined.  The word &quot;withdrew&quot; indicates that a country left of its own choice.  The word &quot;left&quot; indicates a country that ceased to exist because of [[annexation]] by Germany, Italy or the USSR.  The [[USSR]] and [[Finland]] were the only countries to be expelled by the League.

Despite formulating the concept and signing the Covenant, the [[United States]] never joined the League of Nations.
