'''Dinosaurs''' are a diverse group of animals of the [[clade]] and [[superorder]] '''Dinosauria'''. They were the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s for over 160&amp;nbsp;million years, from the late [[Triassic]] period (about 230&amp;nbsp;million years ago) until the end of the [[Cretaceous]] (about 65&amp;nbsp;million years ago), when the [[CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event]] led to the extinction of all non-avian dinosaurs at the close of the [[Mesozoic era]]. The [[fossil]] record indicates that [[bird]]s [[evolution|evolved]] within [[theropod]] dinosaurs during the [[Jurassic]] period. Some of them survived the CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event, including the ancestors of all modern birds. Consequently, in modern classification systems, birds are considered a type of dinosaurâthe only group which survived to the present day.&lt;ref name=GauthQuer/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zhou2004/&gt;

Dinosaurs are a varied group of animals. Birds, at over 9,000 living species, are the most diverse group of vertebrates besides [[perciformes|perciform]] fish.&lt;ref name=Alfaroetal2009/&gt; Using fossil evidence, [[paleontologist]]s have identified over 500 distinct [[genus|genera]]&lt;ref name=Wang&amp;Dodson/&gt; and more than 1,000 different species of non-avian dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=AmosBBC/&gt; Dinosaurs are represented on every continent by both [[extant taxon|extant]] species and fossil remains.&lt;ref name=MacLeod/&gt; Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous. Many dinosaurs have been [[bipedalism|bipedal]], and many extinct groups were also [[quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]], and some were able to shift between these body postures. Many species possess elaborate display structures such as horns or crests, and some prehistoric groups even developed skeletal modifications such as [[armour (zoology)|bony armor]] and [[spine (zoology)|spines]]. Avian dinosaurs have been the planet's dominant flying vertebrate since the extinction of the [[pterosaur]]s, and evidence suggests that all ancient dinosaurs built nests and laid eggs much as avian species do today. Dinosaurs varied widely in size and weight; the smallest adult theropods were less than 100 centimeters (40 inches) long, while the largest sauropods could reach lengths of almost 50 meters (165 feet) and were several stories tall. 

Although the word ''dinosaur'' means &quot;terrible lizard,&quot; the name is somewhat misleading, as dinosaurs were not [[lizard]]s. Rather, they were a separate group of reptiles with a distinct upright posture not found in lizards. Through the first half of the 20th century, most of the scientific community believed dinosaurs were sluggish, unintelligent, and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. Most [[Dinosaur renaissance|research conducted since the 1970s]], however, has indicated that dinosaurs were active animals with elevated [[metabolism]]s and numerous adaptations for social interaction, and many groups (especially the carnivores) were among the most intelligent organisms of the time. 

Since the first dinosaur [[fossil]]s were recognized in the early 19th century, mounted fossil dinosaur skeletons or replicas have been major attractions at museums around the world, and dinosaurs have become a part of world culture. Their diversity, the large sizes of some groups, and their seemingly monstrous and fantastic nature have captured the interest and imagination of the general public for over a century. They have been featured in best-selling books and films such as ''[[Jurassic Park (film)|Jurassic Park]]'', and new discoveries are regularly covered by the media. 

==Etymology==
The [[taxon]] '''Dinosauria''' was formally named in 1842 by [[paleontologist]] Sir [[Richard Owen]], who used it to refer to the &quot;distinct tribe or sub-order of Saurian Reptiles&quot; that were then being recognized in England and around the world.&lt;ref name=Owen1842/&gt;{{rp|103}} The term is derived from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] words [[wikt:Î´ÎµÎ¹Î½ÏÏ|Î´ÎµÎ¹Î½ÏÏ]] (''deinos'', meaning &quot;terrible,&quot; &quot;potent,&quot; or &quot;fearfully great&quot;) and [[wikt:ÏÎ±á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï|ÏÎ±á¿¦ÏÎ¿Ï]] (''sauros'', meaning &quot;lizard&quot; or &quot;reptile&quot;).&lt;ref name=Owen1842/&gt;{{rp|103}}&lt;ref name=LSJ/&gt; Though the taxonomic name has often been interpreted as a reference to dinosaurs' teeth, claws, and other fearsome characteristics, Owen intended it merely to evoke their size and majesty.&lt;ref name=FBS97/&gt;

==Modern definition==
[[Image:Triceratops AMNH 01.jpg|thumb|''[[Triceratops]]'' [[skeleton]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in New York City]]
Formal definitions are written to correspond with scientific conceptions of dinosaurs that predate the modern use of [[phylogenetics]]. The continuity of meaning is intended to prevent confusion about what the term &quot;dinosaur&quot; means.

Under phylogenetic taxonomy, dinosaurs are usually defined as the group consisting of &quot;''[[Triceratops]]'', [[Neornithes]] [modern birds], their [[most recent common ancestor]], and all descendants&quot;.&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt; It has also been suggested that Dinosauria be defined with respect to the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]] of ''[[Megalosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', because these were two of the three genera cited by Richard Owen when he recognized the Dinosauria.&lt;ref name=olshevsky2000/&gt; Both definitions result in the same set of animals being defined as dinosaurs, that is &quot;Dinosauria = [[Ornithischia]] + [[Saurischia]]&quot;, which encompasses [[theropoda|theropods]] (mostly [[bipedalism|bipedal]] [[carnivore]]s and [[bird]]s), [[ankylosauria]]ns (armored herbivorous quadrupeds), [[stegosauria]]ns (plated herbivorous quadrupeds), [[ceratopsia]]ns (herbivorous quadrupeds with horns and frills), [[ornithopoda|ornithopods]] (bipedal or quadrupedal herbivores including &quot;duck-bills&quot;), and, perhaps, [[sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (mostly large [[herbivore|herbivorous]] [[quadruped]]s with long necks and tails).

Many paleontologists note that the point at which sauropodomorphs and theropods diverged may omit sauropodomorphs from the definition for both saurischians and dinosaurs. To avoid the instability of Dinosauria, a more conservative definition of Dinosauria is defined with respect to four anchoring nodes: ''Triceratops horridus'', ''[[Saltasaurus loricatus]]'', and ''[[Passer domesticus]]'', their most recent common ancestor, and all descendants. This &quot;safer&quot; definition can be expressed as &quot;Dinosauria = Ornithischia + [[Sauropodomorpha]] + [[Theropoda]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Sereno2005/&gt;

There is a wide consensus among paleontologists that birds are the descendants of theropod dinosaurs. Using the strict [[Phylogenetic nomenclature|phylogenetic nomenclatural]] definition that all descendants of a single common ancestor must be included in a group for that group to be natural, birds would thus ''be'' dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified by most paleontologists as belonging to the subgroup [[Maniraptora]], which are [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]], which are theropods, which are [[saurischia]]ns, which are dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;

From the point of view of cladistics, birds are dinosaurs, but in ordinary speech the word &quot;dinosaur&quot; does not include birds. Additionally, referring to dinosaurs that are not birds as &quot;non-avian dinosaurs&quot; is cumbersome. For clarity, this article will use &quot;dinosaur&quot; as a synonym for &quot;non-avian dinosaur&quot;. The term &quot;non-avian dinosaur&quot; will be used for emphasis as needed.

===General description===
[[File:Stegosaurus at the Field Museum.jpg|thumb|''[[Stegosaurus]]'' skeleton, [[Field Museum]], [[Chicago]]]]
Using one of the above definitions, dinosaurs (aside from birds) can be generally described as terrestrial [[archosaur]]ian [[reptile]]s with [[Terrestrial locomotion#Posture|limbs held erect beneath the body]], that existed from the [[Late Triassic]] (first appearing in the [[Carnian]] [[faunal stage]]) to the [[Late Cretaceous]] (going extinct at the end of the [[Maastrichtian]]).&lt;ref name=DFG97/&gt; Many prehistoric animals are popularly conceived of as dinosaurs, such as [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', but are not classified scientifically as dinosaurs. Marine reptiles like ichthyosaurs, mosasaurs, and plesiosaurs were neither terrestrial nor archosaurs; pterosaurs were archosaurs but not terrestrial; and ''Dimetrodon'' was a [[Permian]] animal more closely related to mammals.&lt;ref name=DL90/&gt; Dinosaurs were the dominant terrestrial vertebrates of the Mesozoic, especially the [[Jurassic]] and Cretaceous. Other groups of animals were restricted in size and niches; mammals, for example, rarely exceeded the size of a cat, and were generally rodent-sized carnivores of small prey.&lt;ref name=MM97/&gt; One notable exception is ''[[Repenomamus|Repenomamus giganticus]]'', a [[triconodont]] weighing between {{convert|12|kg|lb}} and {{convert|14|kg|lb}} that is known to have eaten small dinosaurs like young ''[[Psittacosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=huetal2005/&gt;

Dinosaurs were an extremely varied group of animals; according to a 2006 study, over 500&amp;nbsp;dinosaur genera have been identified with certainty so far, and the total number of genera preserved in the fossil record has been estimated at around&amp;nbsp;1850, nearly 75% of which remain to be discovered.&lt;ref name=Wang&amp;Dodson/&gt; An earlier study predicted that about 3400&amp;nbsp;dinosaur genera existed, including many which would not have been preserved in the fossil record.&lt;ref name=russell1995/&gt;{{as of |2008|09|17
 |alt=As of September 17, 2008}}, 1047 different species of dinosaurs have been named.&lt;ref name=AmosBBC/&gt; Some were herbivorous, others carnivorous. Some dinosaurs were bipeds, some were quadrupeds, and others, such as ''[[Ammosaurus]]'' and ''[[Iguanodon]]'', could walk just as easily on two or four legs. Many had [[armour (zoology)|bony armor]], or cranial modifications like horns and crests. Although known for large size, many dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller. Dinosaur remains have been found on every continent on Earth, including [[Antarctica]].&lt;ref name=MacLeod/&gt; No non-avian dinosaurs are known to have lived in marine habitats or in aerial habitats, although it is possible some feathered non-avian theropods were flyers. There is also evidence that some [[spinosauridae|spinosaurids]] had semi-aquatic habits.&lt;ref name=RMetal10/&gt;

===Distinguishing anatomical features===
While recent discoveries have made it more difficult to present a universally agreed-upon list of dinosaurs' distinguishing features, nearly all dinosaurs discovered so far share certain modifications to the ancestral [[archosaur]]ian skeleton. Although some later groups of dinosaurs featured further modified versions of these traits, they are considered typical across Dinosauria; the earliest dinosaurs had them and passed them on to all their descendants. Such common features across a taxonomic group are called [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]].

A detailed assessment of archosaur interrelations by S. Nesbitt&lt;ref name=nesbitt2011/&gt; confirmed or found the following 12 unambiguous synapomorphies, some previously known:
* in the skull, a supratemporal fossa (excavation) is present in front of the supratemporal [[Temporal fenestra#Temporal fenestrae|fenestra]]
* epipophyses present in anterior neck vertebrae (except atlas and axis)
* apex of deltopectoral crest (a projection on which the [[clavipectoral triangle|deltopectoral]] muscles attach) located at or more than 30% down the length of the [[humerus]] (upper arm bone)
* [[Radius (bone)|radius]] shorter than 80% of humerus length
* fourth trochanter (projection where the caudofemoralis muscle attaches) on the [[femur]] (thigh bone) is a sharp flange
* fourth trochanter asymmetrical, with distal margin forming a steeper angle to the shaft
* on the [[Talus bone|astragalus]] and [[Calcaneus|calcaneum]] the proximal articular facet for [[fibula]] occupies less than 30% of the transverse width of the element
* exocciptials (bones at the back of the skull) do not meet along the midline on the floor of the endocranial cavity
* proximal articular surfaces of the [[ischium]] with the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] and the [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]] separated by a large concave surface
* cnemial crest on the [[tibia]] (shinbone) arcs anterolaterally
* distinct proximodistally oriented ridge present on the posterior face of the distal end of the tibia
Nesbitt found a number of further potential synapomorphies, and discounted a number of synapomorphies previously suggested. Some of these are also present in [[Silesauridae|silesaurids]], which Nesbitt recovered as a sister group to Dinosauria, including a large anterior trochanter, metatarsals II and IV of subequal length, reduced contact between ischium and pubis, the presence of a cenmial crest on the tibia and of an ascending process on the astragalus,&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt; and many others.

[[File:Sprawling and erect hip joints - horiz.png|thumb|Hip joints and hindlimb postures]]
A variety of other skeletal features were shared by many dinosaurs. However, because they were either common to other groups of [[archosaurs]] or were not present in all early dinosaurs, these features are not considered to be synapomorphies. For example, as [[diapsid]] reptiles, dinosaurs ancestrally had two pairs of [[temporal fenestra]]e (openings in the skull behind the eyes), and as members of the diapsid group Archosauria, had additional openings in the [[antorbital fenestra|snout]] and lower jaw.&lt;ref name=TRHJ00/&gt; Additionally, several characteristics once thought to be synapomorphies are now known to have appeared before dinosaurs, or were absent in the earliest dinosaurs and independently evolved by different dinosaur groups. These include an elongated [[scapula]], or shoulder blade; a [[sacrum]] composed of three or more fused [[vertebra]]e (three are found in some other archosaurs, but only two are found in ''[[Herrerasaurus]]'');&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt; and an [[acetabulum]], or hip socket, with a hole at the center of its inside surface (closed in ''[[Saturnalia (dinosaur)|Saturnalia]]'', for example).&lt;ref name=LARB99/&gt; Another difficulty of determining distinctly dinosaurian features is that early dinosaurs and other archosaurs from the Late Triassic are often poorly known and were similar in many ways; these animals have sometimes been misidentified in the literature.&lt;ref name=NIP07/&gt;

Dinosaurs stood erect in a manner similar to [[Evolution of mammals#Erect limbs|most modern mammals]], but distinct from most other reptiles, whose limbs sprawl out to either side.&lt;ref name=Holland1909&gt;This was recognized not later than 1909: {{cite web |title=Dr. Holland and the Sprawling Sauropods |url=http://www.hmnh.org/library/diplodocus/holland1910.html }} The arguments and many of the images are also presented in {{cite book |title=Hot Blooded Dinosaurs |author=Desmond, A. |publisher=DoubleDay |year=1976 |isbn=0-385-27063-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their posture was due to the development of a laterally facing recess in the pelvis (usually an open socket) and a corresponding inwardly facing distinct head on the femur.&lt;ref name=MJB00/&gt; Their erect posture enabled dinosaurs to breathe easily while moving, which likely permitted stamina and activity levels that [[Carrier's constraint|surpassed those of &quot;sprawling&quot; reptiles]].&lt;ref name=RC05/&gt; Erect limbs probably also helped support the evolution of large size by reducing bending stresses on limbs.&lt;ref name=TKMB07/&gt; Some non-dinosaurian archosaurs, including [[rauisuchia]]ns, also had erect limbs but achieved this by a &quot;pillar erect&quot; configuration of the hip joint, where instead of having a projection from the femur insert on a socket on the hip, the [[ilium (bone)|upper pelvic bone]] was rotated to form an overhanging shelf.&lt;ref name=TKMB07/&gt;

==Evolutionary history==
{{Main|Evolution of dinosaurs}}
===Origins and early evolution===
[[Image:Marasuchus.JPG|thumb|''Marasuchus'', a dinosaur-like [[ornithodiran]]]]
Dinosaurs diverged from their [[archosaur]] ancestors approximately 230 million years ago during the Middle to Late [[Triassic]] period, roughly 20&amp;nbsp;million years after the [[PermianâTriassic extinction event]] wiped out an estimated 95% of all [[life on Earth]].&lt;ref name=KPA/&gt;&lt;ref name=TannerLucas/&gt; [[Radiometric dating]] of the [[rock formation]] that contained fossils from the early dinosaur [[genus]] ''[[Eoraptor]]'' establishes its presence in the fossil record at this time. Paleontologists believe ''Eoraptor'' resembles the [[Common descent|common ancestor]] of all dinosaurs;&lt;ref name=Sereno1999/&gt; if this is true, its traits suggest that the first dinosaurs were small, bipedal [[predation|predators]].&lt;ref name=SFRM93/&gt; The discovery of primitive, dinosaur-like [[ornithodiran]]s such as ''[[Marasuchus]]'' and ''[[Lagerpeton]]'' in [[Argentina|Argentinian]] [[Middle Triassic]] strata supports this view; analysis of recovered fossils suggests that these animals were indeed small, bipedal predators.

When dinosaurs appeared, terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of basal archosaurs and [[therapsida|therapsids]], such as [[aetosaur]]s, [[cynodont]]s, [[dicynodont]]s, [[ornithosuchidae|ornithosuchids]], [[rauisuchia]]s, and [[rhynchosaur]]s. Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about the boundary between the [[Carnian]] and [[Norian]] [[faunal stage]]s (about 215&amp;nbsp;million years ago), dicynodonts and a variety of basal [[archosauromorpha|archosauromorphs]], including the [[prolacertiformes|prolacertiforms]] and rhynchosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the [[TriassicâJurassic extinction event]] (about 200&amp;nbsp;million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, [[phytosaur]]s, and rauisuchians. These losses left behind a land fauna of [[crocodylomorpha|crocodylomorphs]], dinosaurs, [[mammal]]s, [[pterosauria]]ns, and [[turtle]]s.&lt;ref name=MJB04dino/&gt; The first few lines of early dinosaurs [[Adaptive radiation|diversified]] through the [[Carnian]] and [[Norian]] [[faunal stage|stages]] of the Triassic, most likely by occupying the niches of the groups that became extinct.

===Evolution and paleobiogeography===
[[File:LateJurassicGlobal.jpg|thumb|Earth during the [[Jurassic]], one of the periods in which dinosaurs lived. The continents were in different locations from where they are today.]]
Dinosaur evolution after the Triassic follows changes in vegetation and the location of continents. In the Late Triassic and Early Jurassic, the continents were connected as the single landmass [[Pangaea]], and there was a worldwide dinosaur fauna mostly composed of [[coelophysoidea|coelophysoid]] [[carnivore]]s and [[prosauropod]] [[herbivore]]s.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; [[Gymnosperm]] plants (particularly [[conifer]]s), a potential food source, radiated in the Late Triassic. Prosauropods did not have sophisticated mechanisms for processing food in the mouth, and so must have employed other means of breaking down food farther along the digestive tract.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; The general homogeneity of dinosaurian faunas continued into the Middle and Late Jurassic, where most localities had predators consisting of [[ceratosauria]]ns, [[spinosauroidea|spinosauroids]], and [[carnosauria]]ns, and herbivores consisting of [[stegosauria]]n ornithischians and large sauropods. Examples of this include the [[Morrison Formation]] of North America and [[Tendaguru|Tendaguru Beds]] of Tanzania. Dinosaurs in China show some differences, with specialized [[sinraptoridae|sinraptorid]] theropods and unusual, long-necked sauropods like ''[[Mamenchisaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; [[Ankylosauria]]ns and [[ornithopoda|ornithopods]] were also becoming more common, but prosauropods had become extinct. Conifers and [[pteridophyte]]s were the most common plants. Sauropods, like the earlier prosauropods, were not oral processors, but ornithischians were evolving various means of dealing with food in the mouth, including potential [[cheek]]-like organs to keep food in the mouth, and jaw motions to grind food.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; Another notable evolutionary event of the Jurassic was the appearance of true birds, descended from [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;

By the Early Cretaceous and the ongoing breakup of Pangaea, dinosaurs were becoming strongly differentiated by landmass. The earliest part of this time saw the spread of ankylosaurians, [[iguanodontia]]ns, and [[brachiosauridae|brachiosaurids]] through Europe, North America, and northern Africa. These were later supplemented or replaced in Africa by large [[spinosaurid]] and [[carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] theropods, and [[rebbachisauridae|rebbachisaurid]] and [[titanosauria]]n sauropods, also found in South America. In Asia, [[maniraptora]]n [[coelurosauria]]ns like [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], [[troodontidae|troodontids]], and [[oviraptorosauria]]ns became the common theropods, and [[ankylosauridae|ankylosaurids]] and early [[ceratopsia]]ns like ''Psittacosaurus'' became important herbivores. Meanwhile, Australia was home to a fauna of basal ankylosaurians, [[hypsilophodont]]s, and iguanodontians.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; The stegosaurians appear to have gone extinct at some point in the late Early Cretaceous or early Late Cretaceous. A major change in the Early Cretaceous, which would be amplified in the Late Cretaceous, was the evolution of [[angiosperm|flowering plants]]. At the same time, several groups of dinosaurian herbivores evolved more sophisticated ways to orally process food. Ceratopsians developed a method of slicing with teeth stacked on each other in batteries, and iguanodontians refined a method of grinding with tooth batteries, taken to its extreme in [[hadrosaurid]]s.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; Some sauropods also evolved tooth batteries, best exemplified by the rebbachisaurid ''[[Nigersaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=serenoetal07/&gt;

There were three general dinosaur faunas in the Late Cretaceous. In the northern continents of North America and Asia, the major theropods were [[tyrannosauridae|tyrannosaurids]] and various types of smaller maniraptoran theropods, with a predominantly ornithischian herbivore assemblage of hadrosaurids, ceratopsians, ankylosaurids, and [[pachycephalosauria]]ns. In the southern continents that had made up the now-splitting [[Gondwana]], [[abelisauridae|abelisaurids]] were the common theropods, and titanosaurian sauropods the common herbivores. Finally, in Europe, dromaeosaurids, [[rhabdodontidae|rhabdodontid]] iguanodontians, [[nodosauridae|nodosaurid]] ankylosaurians, and titanosaurian sauropods were prevalent.&lt;ref name=HCL04/&gt; Flowering plants were greatly radiating,&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt; with the first grasses appearing by the end of the Cretaceous.&lt;ref name=PSAS05/&gt; Grinding hadrosaurids and shearing ceratopsians became extremely diverse across North America and Asia. Theropods were also radiating as herbivores or omnivores, with [[therizinosaur]]ians and [[ornithomimosauria]]ns becoming common.&lt;ref name=FS04/&gt;

The [[CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event]], which occurred approximately 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period, caused the extinction of all dinosaurs except for the birds. Some other [[diapsid]] groups, such as crocodilians, [[lizard]]s, [[snake]]s, [[sphenodontia]]ns, and [[choristodera]]ns, also survived the event.&lt;ref name=AF04/&gt;

==Classification==
{{Main|Dinosaur classification}}

Dinosaurs (including birds) are [[archosaur]]s, like modern [[crocodilia]]ns. Within the archosaur group, dinosaurs are differentiated most noticeably by their gait. Dinosaur legs extend directly beneath the body, whereas the legs of lizards and crocodilians sprawl out to either side.

Collectively, dinosaurs are usually regarded as a [[superorder]] or an unranked [[clade]]. They are divided into two [[Order (biology)|orders]], [[Saurischia]] and [[Ornithischia]], depending upon [[pelvis|pelvic]] structure. Saurischia includes those taxa sharing a more recent common ancestor with birds than with Ornithischia, while Ornithischia includes all [[taxon|taxa]] sharing a more recent common ancestor with ''[[Triceratops]]'' than with Saurischia. Saurischians (&quot;lizard-hipped&quot;, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''sauros'' (''ÏÎ±ÏÏÎ¿Ï'') meaning &quot;lizard&quot; and ''ischion'' (''Î¹ÏÏÎ¹Î¿Î½'') meaning &quot;hip joint&quot;) retained the hip structure of their ancestors, with a [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] bone directed [[anatomical terms of location|cranially]], or forward.&lt;ref name=MJB00/&gt; This basic form was modified by rotating the pubis backward to varying degrees in several groups (''[[Herrerasaurus]]'',&lt;ref name=GSP88/&gt; [[therizinosaur]]oids,&lt;ref name=clarketal2004/&gt; [[dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]],&lt;ref name=MAPM04/&gt; and [[bird]]s&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;). Saurischia includes the [[Theropoda|theropods]] (bipedal and mostly carnivores, except for birds) and [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]] (long-necked quadrupedal [[herbivore]]s).

By contrast, ornithischians (&quot;bird-hipped&quot;, from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] ''ornitheios'' (''Î¿ÏÎ½Î¹Î¸ÎµÎ¹Î¿Ï'') meaning &quot;of a bird&quot; and ''ischion'' (''Î¹ÏÏÎ¹Î¿Î½'') meaning &quot;hip joint&quot;) had a pelvis that superficially resembled a bird's pelvis: the [[pubis (bone)|pubis]] bone was oriented [[anatomical terms of location|caudally]] (rear-pointing) Unlike birds, the ornithischian pubis also usually had an additional forward-pointing process. Ornithischia includes a variety of herbivores. ('''NB:''' the terms &quot;lizard hip&quot; and &quot;bird hip&quot; are misnomers&amp;nbsp;â birds evolved from dinosaurs with &quot;lizard hips&quot;.)

==Paleobiology==
Knowledge about dinosaurs is derived from a variety of fossil and non-fossil records, including fossilized [[bone]]s, [[feces]], [[trackway]]s, [[gastrolith]]s, [[feather]]s, impressions of skin, [[Viscus|internal organs]] and [[soft tissue]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;softtissue&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Dal Sasso, C. and Signore, M. |year=1998|title=Exceptional soft-tissue preservation in a theropod dinosaur from Italy|journal=Nature|volume=292|issue=6674|pages=383â387|doi=10.1038/32884|bibcode=1998Natur.392..383D}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Schweitzer2005&quot;/&gt; Many fields of study contribute to our understanding of dinosaurs, including [[physics]] (especially [[biomechanics]]), [[chemistry]], [[biology]], and the [[earth sciences]] (of which [[paleontology]] is a sub-discipline). Two topics of particular interest and study have been dinosaur size and behavior.

===Size===
{{Main|Dinosaur size}}
[[Image:Largestdinosaursbysuborder scale.png|thumb|400px|Scale diagram comparing the largest known dinosaurs in five major [[clade]]s and a human]]
Current evidence suggests that dinosaur average size varied through the Triassic, early Jurassic, late Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.&lt;ref name=Sereno1999/&gt; Theropod dinosaurs, when sorted by estimated weight into categories based on [[order of magnitude]], most often fall into the 100 to 1000&amp;nbsp;kilogram (220 to 2200&amp;nbsp;lb) category, whereas [[Holocene|recent]] predatory [[carnivora]]ns peak in the 10 to 100&amp;nbsp;kilogram (22 to 220&amp;nbsp;lb) category.&lt;ref name=JF93/&gt; The [[Mode (statistics)|mode]] of dinosaur body masses is between one and ten metric tonnes.&lt;ref name=Peczkis1994/&gt; This contrasts sharply with the size of [[Cenozoic]] mammals, estimated by the [[National Museum of Natural History]] as about 2 to 5&amp;nbsp;kilograms (5 to 10&amp;nbsp;lb).&lt;ref name=NMNH/&gt;

The [[Sauropoda|sauropods]] were the largest and heaviest dinosaurs. For much of the dinosaur era, the smallest sauropods were larger than anything else in their habitat, and the largest were an [[order of magnitude]] more massive than anything else that has since walked the Earth. Giant prehistoric [[mammal]]s such as the ''[[Paraceratherium]]'' and the Columbian [[mammoth]] were dwarfed by the giant sauropods, and only a handful of modern aquatic animals approach or surpass them in size&amp;nbsp;â most notably the [[blue whale]], which reaches up to {{gaps|173|000}} kg ({{gaps|381|000}} lb) and over {{convert|30|m|ft|sp=us}} in length.{{Citation needed|reason=old source (PDF) dead|date=May 2011}} There are several proposed advantages for the large size of sauropods, including protection from predation, reduction of energy use, and longevity, but it may be that the most important advantage was dietary. Large animals are more efficient at digestion than small animals, because food spends more time in their digestive systems. This also permits them to subsist on food with lower nutritive value than smaller animals. Sauropod remains are mostly found in [[rock formation]]s interpreted as dry or seasonally dry, and the ability to eat large quantities of low-nutrient browse would have been advantageous in such environments.&lt;ref name=KC06/&gt;

====Largest and smallest====
Scientists will probably never be certain of the [[largest organism|largest and smallest dinosaurs]]. This is because only a tiny percentage of animals ever fossilize, and most of these remain buried in the earth. Few of the specimens that are recovered are complete skeletons, and impressions of skin and other soft tissues are rare. Rebuilding a complete skeleton by comparing the size and morphology of bones to those of similar, better-known species is an inexact art, and reconstructing the muscles and other organs of the living animal is, at best, a process of educated guesswork. 

[[Image:Giraffatitan scale.png|thumb|Comparative size of ''[[Giraffatitan]]'']]
The tallest and heaviest dinosaur known from good skeletons is ''[[Giraffatitan|Giraffatitan brancai]]'' (previously classified as a species of ''[[Brachiosaurus]]''). Its remains were discovered in [[Tanzania]] between 1907â12. Bones from several similar-sized individuals were incorporated into the skeleton now mounted and on display at the [[Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde|Museum fÃ¼r Naturkunde Berlin]];&lt;ref name=EC68/&gt; this mount is {{convert|12|m|ft|sp=us}} tall and {{convert|22.5|m|ft|sp=us}} long, and would have belonged to an animal that weighed between {{gaps|30|000}} and {{gaps|60|000}}&amp;nbsp;kilograms ({{gaps|70|000}} and {{gaps|130|000}}&amp;nbsp;lb). The longest complete dinosaur is the 27-meter (89&amp;nbsp;ft) long ''[[Diplodocus]]'', which was discovered in [[Wyoming]] in the [[United States]] and displayed in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh's]] [[Carnegie Natural History Museum]] in 1907.
[[Image:Human-eoraptor size comparison(v2).png|thumb|left|Comparative size of ''[[Eoraptor]]'']]
There were larger dinosaurs, but knowledge of them is based entirely on a small number of fragmentary fossils. Most of the largest [[herbivore|herbivorous]] specimens on record were all discovered in the 1970s or later, and include the massive ''[[Argentinosaurus]]'', which may have weighed {{gaps|80|000}} to {{gaps|100|000}}&amp;nbsp;kilograms (90 to 110&amp;nbsp;short tons); some of the longest were the {{convert|33.5|m|ft|sp=us}} long ''[[Diplodocus|Diplodocus hallorum]]''&lt;ref name=KC06/&gt; (formerly ''Seismosaurus'') and the {{convert|33|m|ft|sp=us}} long ''[[Supersaurus]]'';&lt;ref name=LHW07/&gt; and the tallest, the {{convert|18|m|ft|sp=us}} tall ''[[Sauroposeidon]]'', which could have reached a sixth-floor window. The heaviest and longest of them all may have been ''[[Amphicoelias|Amphicoelias fragillimus]]'', known only from a now lost partial vertebral [[neural arch]] described in 1878. Extrapolating from the illustration of this bone, the animal may have been {{convert|58|m|ft|sp=us}} long and weighed over {{gaps|120|000}} kg ({{gaps|260|000}} lb).&lt;ref name=KC06/&gt; The largest known [[carnivore|carnivorous]] dinosaur was ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', reaching a length of 16 to 18&amp;nbsp;meters (50 to 60&amp;nbsp;ft), and weighing in at 8150&amp;nbsp;kg ({{gaps|18|000}} lb).&lt;ref name=SMBM06/&gt; Other large meat-eaters included ''[[Giganotosaurus]]'', ''[[Carcharodontosaurus]]'' and ''[[Tyrannosaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=TH07/&gt;

Not including modern birds, the smallest known dinosaurs known were about the size of a [[pigeon]].&lt;ref name=zhang2008/&gt; Not surprisingly, the smallest dinosaurs were theropods closely related to birds. ''[[Anchiornis]]'' and ''[[Epidexipteryx]]'' both had a total skeletal length of under 35&amp;nbsp;centimeters (1.1&amp;nbsp;ft).&lt;ref name=zhang2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=anchiadvance/&gt; ''Anchiornis'' is currently the smallest dinosaur described from an adult specimen, with an estimated weight of 110&amp;nbsp;grams.&lt;ref name=anchiadvance/&gt; The smallest herbivorous dinosaurs included ''[[Microceratus]]'' and ''[[Wannanosaurus]]'', at about 60&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;ft) long each.&lt;ref name=Holtz2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=butler&amp;zhao2009/&gt;

===Behavior===
[[Image:Maiasaurusnest.jpg|thumb|A nesting ground of ''[[Maiasaura]]'' was discovered in 1978.]]

Interpretations of dinosaur behavior are generally based on the pose of body fossils and their [[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]], [[computer simulation]]s of their [[biomechanics]], and comparisons with modern animals in similar [[ecological niche]]s. As such, the current understanding of dinosaur behavior relies on speculation, and will likely remain controversial for the foreseeable future. However, there is general agreement that some behaviors which are common in crocodiles and birds, dinosaurs' closest living relatives, were also common among dinosaurs.

The first potential evidence of [[herd]]ing behavior was the 1878 discovery of 31&amp;nbsp;''[[Iguanodon]]'' dinosaurs which were then thought to have perished together in [[Bernissart]], [[Belgium]], after they fell into a deep, flooded [[sinkhole]] and drowned.&lt;ref name=Yans/&gt; Other mass-death sites have been subsequently discovered. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that [[Hadrosaurid|duck-bills]] (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the [[American Bison]] or the African [[Springbok Antelope|Springbok]]. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in [[Oxfordshire]], England,&lt;ref name=Day2002/&gt; although there is not evidence for specific herd structures.&lt;ref name=JLW05/&gt; Dinosaurs may have congregated in herds for defense, for [[Bird migration|migratory]] purposes, or to provide protection for their young. There is evidence that many types of dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in [[Inner Mongolia]] that has yielded the remains of over 20 ''[[Sinornithomimus]]'', from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud.&lt;ref name=DVetal08sino/&gt; The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as [[pack hunter]]s working together to bring down large prey.&lt;ref name=LG93/&gt;&lt;ref name=maxwell&amp;ostrom1995/&gt; However, this lifestyle is uncommon among the modern relatives of dinosaurs ([[crocodile]]s and other reptiles, and [[bird]]s&amp;nbsp;â [[Harris's Hawk]] is a well-documented exception), and the [[taphonomy|taphonomic]] evidence suggesting pack hunting in such theropods as ''[[Deinonychus]]'' and ''[[Allosaurus]]'' can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern [[diapsid]] predators.&lt;ref name=RB07/&gt;
[[Image:Dino eggP9240092.JPG|thumb|Fossilized egg of the [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'', [[American Museum of Natural History]]]]
[[Jack Horner (paleontologist)|Jack Horner's]] 1978 discovery of a ''[[Maiasaura]]'' (&quot;good mother dinosaur&quot;) [[nest]]ing ground in [[Montana]] demonstrated that parental care continued long after birth among the [[ornithopod]]s.&lt;ref name=HM79/&gt; There is also evidence that other Cretaceous-era dinosaurs, like [[Patagonia]]n [[titanosaur]]ian sauropods (1997 discovery), also nested in large groups.&lt;ref name=LMCetal05/&gt; The [[Mongolia]]n [[oviraptoridae|oviraptorid]] ''[[Citipati]]'' was discovered in a [[chicken]]-like [[Avian incubation|brooding]] position in 1993, which may mean it was covered with an insulating layer of feathers that kept the [[egg (biology)|eggs]] warm.&lt;ref name=search.eb/&gt; Parental care is also implied by other finds. For example, the fossilized remains of a grouping of ''[[Psittacosaurus]]'' has been found, consisting of one adult and 34 juveniles; in this case, the large number of juveniles may be due to communal nesting.&lt;ref name=mengetal2004/&gt; Additionally, a dinosaur embryo (pertaining to the [[prosauropoda|prosauropod]] ''[[Massospondylus]]'') was found without teeth, indicating that some parental care was required to feed the young dinosaur.&lt;ref name=Reiszetal05/&gt; Trackways have also confirmed parental behavior among ornithopods from the [[Isle of Skye]] in northwestern [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=BBCtracks/&gt; Nests and eggs have been found for most major groups of dinosaurs, and it appears likely that dinosaurs communicated with their young, in a manner similar to modern birds and crocodiles.

[[Image:Centrosaurus dinosaur.png|thumb|left|Artist's rendering of two ''[[Centrosaurus]]'', herbivorous [[ceratopsidae|ceratopsid]] dinosaurs from the late Cretaceous fauna of North America]]
The crests and [[Neck frill|frills]] of some dinosaurs, like the [[marginocephalia]]ns, [[theropod]]s and [[lambeosaurine]]s, may have been too fragile to be used for active defense, and so they were likely used for sexual or aggressive displays, though little is known about dinosaur mating and [[territory (animal)|territorialism]]. Head wounds from bites suggest that theropods, at least, engaged in active aggressive confrontations.&lt;ref name=PC98/&gt;

From a behavioral standpoint, one of the most valuable dinosaur fossils was discovered in the [[Gobi Desert]] in 1971. It included a ''[[Velociraptor]]'' attacking a ''[[Protoceratops]]'',&lt;ref name=AMNH/&gt; providing evidence that dinosaurs did indeed attack each other.&lt;ref name=carpenter1998/&gt; Additional evidence for attacking live prey is the partially healed tail of an ''[[Edmontosaurus]]'', a hadrosaurid dinosaur; the tail is damaged in such a way that shows the animal was bitten by a tyrannosaur but survived.&lt;ref name=carpenter1998/&gt; [[Cannibalism (zoology)|Cannibalism]] amongst some species of dinosaurs was confirmed by tooth marks found in Madagascar in 2003, involving the theropod ''[[Majungasaurus]]''.&lt;ref name=rogersetal2003/&gt;

Comparisons between the [[sclerotic ring|scleral ring]]s of dinosaurs and modern birds and reptiles have been used to infer daily activity patterns of dinosaurs. Although it has been suggested that most dinosaurs were active during the day, these comparisons have shown that small predatory dinosaurs such as [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]], ''[[Juravenator]]'', and ''[[Megapnosaurus]]'' were likely [[nocturnal]]. Large and medium-sized [[herbivore|herbivorous]] and [[omnivore|omnivorous]] dinosaurs such as [[ceratopsia]]ns, [[Sauropodomorpha|sauropodomorphs]], [[Hadrosauridae|hadrosaurids]], [[Ornithomimosauria|ornithomimosaurs]] may have been [[cathemeral]], active during short intervals throughout the day, although the small [[ornithischia]]n ''[[Agilisaurus]]'' was inferred to be [[Diurnality|diurnal]].&lt;ref name=SchmitzMotani2011/&gt;

Based on current fossil evidence from dinosaurs such as ''[[Oryctodromeus]]'', some herbivorous species seem to have led a partially [[fossorial]] (burrowing) lifestyle,&lt;ref name=VMK07/&gt; and some bird-like species may have been [[arboreal]] (tree climbing), most notably primitive [[Dromaeosauridae|dromaeosaurids]] such as ''[[Microraptor]]''&lt;ref name=chatterjee2007/&gt; and the enigmatic [[scansoriopterygidae|scansoriopterygids]].&lt;ref name=zhang2002/&gt; However, most dinosaurs seem to have relied on land-based locomotion. A good understanding of how dinosaurs moved on the ground is key to models of dinosaur behavior; the science of [[biomechanics]], in particular, has provided significant insight in this area. For example, studies of the forces exerted by muscles and gravity on dinosaurs' skeletal structure have investigated how fast dinosaurs could run,&lt;ref name=alexander2006/&gt; whether [[diplodocid]]s could create [[sonic boom]]s via [[whip]]-like tail snapping,&lt;ref name=goriely/&gt; and whether sauropods could float.&lt;ref name=Henderson2006/&gt;

===Communication and vocalization===
The nature of dinosaur [[Animal communication|communication]] remains enigmatic, and is an active area of research. In 2008, paleontologist Phil Senter examined the evidence for vocalization in Mesozoic animal life, including dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt; Senter found that, contrary to popular depictions of roaring dinosaurs in motion pictures, it is likely that most dinosaurs were not capable of creating any [[Animal communication|vocalizations]]. To draw this conclusion, Senter studied the distribution of vocal organs in reptiles and birds. He found that vocal cords in the [[larynx]] probably evolved multiple times among reptiles, including [[crocodilia]]ns, which are able to produce guttural roars. Birds, on the other hand, lack a larynx. Instead, bird calls are produced by the [[Syrinx (biology)|syrinx]], a vocal organ found only in birds, and which is not related to the larynx, meaning it evolved independently from the vocal organs in reptiles. The syrinx depends on the air sac system in birds to function; specifically, it requires the presence of a ''clavicular air sac'' near the wishbone or collar bone. This air sac leaves distinctive marks or opening on the bones, including a distinct opening in the upper arm bone (''humerus''). While many dinosaurs show evidence of extensive air sac systems, almost none possess the clavicular air sac necessary to vocalize (one exception, ''[[Aerosteon]]'', probably evolved its clavicular air sac independently of birds for reasons other than vocalization).&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt;

The most primitive animals with evidence of a vocalizing syrinx are the [[Enantiornithes|enantironithine birds]]. Any bird-line archosaurs more primitive than this probably did not make vocal calls. Rather, several lines of evidence suggest that dinosaurs used primarily visual communication, in the form of distinctive-looking (and possibly brightly colored) horns, frills, crests, sails and feathers. This is similar to some modern reptile groups such as lizards, in which many forms are largely silent (though like dinosaurs they possess well-developed senses of hearing) but use complex coloration and display behaviors to communicate.&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt;

Also, though they may not have been able to vocalize, some dinosaurs may have used other methods of producing sound for communication. Modern animals, including reptiles and birds, use a wide variety of non-vocal sound communication, including hissing, jaw grinding or clapping, use of environment (such as splashing), and wing beating (which would have been possible in winged [[maniraptora]]n dinosaurs).&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt;

Some studies have suggested that the hollow crests of the lambeosaurines may have functioned as [[resonance chamber]]s used for a wide range of vocalizations.&lt;ref name=JAH75/&gt;&lt;ref name=DW98/&gt; However, Senter (2008) noted that such chambers are also used in modern non-vocal animals to accentuate or deepen non-vocal sounds like hissing. For example, many snakes, which lack vocal cords, have resonating chambers in the skull.&lt;ref name=senter2008/&gt;

===Reproductive biology===
A discovery of features in a ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' [[skeleton]] provided evidence of medullary bone in dinosaurs and, for the first time, allowed paleontologists to establish the sex of a dinosaur. When laying eggs, female birds grow a special type of bone between the hard outer bone and the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] of their limbs. This medullary bone, which is rich in [[calcium]], is used to make eggshells. The presence of endosteally derived bone tissues lining the interior marrow cavities of portions of the ''Tyrannosaurus rex'' specimen's hind limb suggested that ''T. rex'' used similar reproductive strategies, and revealed the specimen to be female.&lt;ref name=schweitzeretal2005/&gt; Further research has found medullary bone in the theropod ''[[Allosaurus]]'' and the ornithopod ''[[Tenontosaurus]]''. Because the line of dinosaurs that includes ''Allosaurus'' and ''Tyrannosaurus'' diverged from the line that led to ''Tenontosaurus'' very early in the evolution of dinosaurs, this suggests that dinosaurs in general produced medullary tissue. Medullary bone has been found in specimens of sub-adult size, which suggests that dinosaurs reached sexual maturity rather quickly for such large animals.&lt;ref name=LW08/&gt;

===Waste===
Like other [[reptile]]s, dinosaurs are primarily uricotelic, that is, their [[kidney]]s extract nitrogenous wastes from their bloodstream and excrete it as [[uric acid]] instead of [[urea]] or [[ammonia]] via the ureters into the intestine. In most living species, uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Ehrlich |first=Paul R. |coauthors=David S.

===Physiology===
{{Main|Physiology of dinosaurs}}
[[Image:Palais de la Decouverte Tyrannosaurus rex p1050042.jpg|thumb|''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' skull and upper vertebral column, Palais de la DÃ©couverte, Paris]]
A vigorous debate on the subject of temperature regulation in dinosaurs has been ongoing since the 1960s. Originally, scientists broadly disagreed as to whether dinosaurs were capable of regulating their body temperatures at all. More recently, dinosaur [[Warm-blooded|endothermy]] has become the consensus view, and debate has focused on the mechanisms of temperature regulation.

After dinosaurs were discovered, paleontologists first posited that they were [[ectotherm]]ic creatures: &quot;terrible [[lizard]]s&quot; as their name suggests. This supposed cold-bloodedness was used to imply that dinosaurs were relatively slow, sluggish organisms, even though many modern reptiles are fast and light-footed despite relying on external sources of heat to regulate their body temperature. The idea of dinosaurs as ectothermic and sluggish remained a prevalent view until [[Robert T. Bakker|Robert T. &quot;Bob&quot; Bakker]], an early proponent of dinosaur endothermy, published an influential paper on the topic in 1968.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Modern evidence indicates that dinosaurs thrived in cooler temperate climates, and that at least some dinosaur species must have regulated their body temperature by internal biological means (aided by the animals' bulk in large species). Evidence of [[Warm-blooded|endothermy]] in dinosaurs includes the discovery of [[polar dinosaurs in Australia]] and [[Antarctica]] (where they would have experienced a cold, dark six-month winter), the discovery of dinosaurs whose feathers may have provided regulatory insulation, and analysis of blood-vessel structures within dinosaur bone that are typical of endotherms. Scientific debate continues regarding the specific ways in which dinosaurs regulated their temperature.&lt;ref name=parsons2001/&gt;

[[Image:Eubrontes01.JPG|thumb|left|''Eubrontes'', a dinosaur footprint in the Lower [[Jurassic]] [[Moenave Formation]] at the St. George Dinosaur Discovery Site at Johnson Farm, southwestern Utah]]Complicating the debate is the fact that warm-bloodedness can emerge based on more than one mechanism. Most discussions of dinosaur endothermy tend to compare them with average-sized birds or mammals, which expend energy to elevate body temperature above that of the environment. Small birds and mammals also possess [[thermal insulation|insulation]], such as [[fat]], [[fur]], or [[feather]]s, which slows down heat loss. However, large mammals, such as elephants, face a different problem because of their relatively small ratio of surface area to volume ([[J. B. S. Haldane|Haldane's]] principle). This ratio compares the volume of an animal with the area of its skin: as an animal gets bigger, its surface area increases more slowly than its volume. At a certain point, the amount of heat radiated away through the skin drops below the amount of heat produced inside the body, forcing animals to use additional methods to avoid overheating. In the case of elephants, they have little hair as adults, have large ears which increase their surface area, and have behavioral adaptations as well (such as using the trunk to spray water on themselves and mud-wallowing). These behaviors increase cooling through evaporation.

Large dinosaurs would presumably have had to deal with similar issues; their body size suggest they lost heat relatively slowly to the surrounding air, and so could have been what are called [[gigantothermy|inertial homeotherms]], animals that are warmer than their environments through sheer size rather than through special adaptations like those of birds or mammals. However, so far this theory fails to account for the numerous dog- and goat-sized dinosaur species, or the young of larger species.

Modern [[computerized tomography]] (CT) scans of a [[Thescelosaurus|dinosaur]]'s chest cavity (conducted in 2000) found the apparent remnants of a four-chambered heart, much like those found in today's mammals and birds.&lt;ref name=Fisheretal2000/&gt; The idea is controversial within the scientific community, coming under fire for bad anatomical science&lt;ref name=HillRuben/&gt; or simply wishful thinking.&lt;ref name=roweetal2001/&gt; The question of how this find reflects on metabolic rate and dinosaur internal anatomy may be moot, though, regardless of the object's identity: both modern [[crocodilia]]ns and [[bird]]s, the closest living relatives of dinosaurs, have four-chambered hearts (albeit modified in crocodilians), and so dinosaurs probably had them as well.&lt;ref name=CH04/&gt;

===Soft tissue and DNA===
One of the best examples of soft-tissue impressions in a fossil dinosaur was discovered in Petraroia, [[Italy]]. The discovery was reported in 1998, and described the specimen of a small, very young [[coelurosaur]], ''[[Scipionyx]] samniticus''. The fossil includes portions of the intestines, colon, liver, muscles, and windpipe of this immature dinosaur.&lt;ref name=&quot;softtissue&quot; /&gt;

In the March 2005 issue of ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', the paleontologist [[Mary Higby Schweitzer]] and her team announced the discovery of flexible material resembling actual soft tissue inside a 68-million-year-old ''[[Tyrannosaurus|Tyrannosaurus rex]]'' leg [[bone]] from the [[Hell Creek Formation]] in [[Montana]]. After recovery, the tissue was rehydrated by the science team.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer2005/&gt;

When the fossilized bone was treated over several weeks to remove mineral content from the fossilized bone-marrow cavity (a process called demineralization), Schweitzer found evidence of intact structures such as [[blood vessel]]s, bone matrix, and connective tissue (bone fibers). Scrutiny under the microscope further revealed that the putative dinosaur soft tissue had retained fine structures (microstructures) even at the cellular level. The exact nature and composition of this material, and the implications of Schweitzer's discovery, are not yet clear; study and interpretation of the material is ongoing.&lt;ref name=Schweitzer2005/&gt;

The successful extraction of ancient DNA from dinosaur fossils has been reported on two separate occasions, but, upon further inspection and [[peer review]], neither of these reports could be confirmed.&lt;ref name=Wangetal1997/&gt; However, a functional visual [[peptide]] of a theoretical dinosaur has been inferred using analytical phylogenetic reconstruction methods on gene sequences of related modern species such as reptiles and birds.&lt;ref name=changetal2002/&gt; In addition, several [[protein]]s, including hemoglobin,&lt;ref name=Schweitzeretal1997/&gt; have putatively been detected in dinosaur fossils.&lt;ref name=Emberyatal2003/&gt;

==Feathers and the origin of birds==
{{Main|Origin of birds}}

The possibility that dinosaurs were the ancestors of birds was first suggested in 1868 by [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].&lt;ref name=huxley1868/&gt; After the work of [[Gerhard Heilmann]] in the early 20th century, the theory of birds as dinosaur descendants was abandoned in favor of the idea of their being descendants of generalized [[thecodont]]s, with the key piece of evidence being the supposed lack of [[clavicle]]s in dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=heilmann/&gt; However, as later discoveries showed, clavicles (or a single fused [[furcula|wishbone]], which derived from separate clavicles) were not actually absent;&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt; they had been found as early as 1924 in ''Oviraptor'', but misidentified as an [[interclavicle]].&lt;ref name=HO24/&gt; In the 1970s, [[John Ostrom]] revived the dinosaurâbird theory,&lt;ref name=ostrom1973/&gt; which gained momentum in the coming decades with the advent of cladistic analysis,&lt;ref name=gauthier1986/&gt; and a great increase in the discovery of small theropods and early birds.&lt;ref name=TRHJ00/&gt; Of particular note have been the fossils of the [[Yixian Formation]], where a variety of theropods and early birds have been found, often with feathers of some type.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt; Birds share over a hundred distinct anatomical features with theropod dinosaurs, which are now generally accepted to have been their closest ancient relatives.&lt;ref name=Mayretal2005/&gt;
They are most closely allied with [[maniraptora]]n coelurosaurs.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt; A minority of scientists, most notably [[Alan Feduccia]] and [[Larry Martin]], have proposed other evolutionary paths, including revised versions of Heilmann's basal archosaur proposal,&lt;ref name=martin2004/&gt; or that maniraptoran theropods are the ancestors of birds but themselves are not dinosaurs, only [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=AF02/&gt;

===Feathers===
{{Main|Feathered dinosaurs}}
[[Image:SArchaeopteryxBerlin2.jpg|thumb|The famous Berlin Specimen of ''[[Archaeopteryx]] lithographica'']]

''Archaeopteryx'' was the first fossil found which revealed a potential connection between dinosaurs and birds. It is considered a [[transitional fossil]], in that it displays features of both groups. Brought to light just two years after Darwin's seminal ''[[The Origin of Species]]'', its discovery spurred the nascent debate between proponents of [[evolutionary biology]] and [[creationism]]. This early bird is so dinosaur-like that, without a clear impression of feathers in the surrounding rock, at least one specimen was mistaken for ''[[Compsognathus]]''.&lt;ref name=PW88/&gt;

Since the 1990s, a number of additional [[feathered dinosaurs]] have been found, providing even stronger evidence of the close relationship between dinosaurs and modern birds. Most of these specimens were unearthed in the [[LagerstÃ¤tten|lagerstÃ¤tte]] of the Yixian Formation, [[Liaoning]], northeastern [[China]], which was part of an island continent during the Cretaceous. Though feathers have been found in only a few locations, it is possible that non-avian dinosaurs elsewhere in the world were also feathered. The lack of widespread fossil evidence for feathered non-avian dinosaurs may be because delicate features like skin and feathers are not often preserved by fossilization and thus are absent from the fossil record. To this point, protofeathers (thin, filament-like structures) are known from dinosaurs at the base of Coelurosauria, such as [[compsognathidae|compsognathids]] like ''[[Sinosauropteryx]]'' and [[tyrannosauroidea|tyrannosauroids]] (''[[Dilong (dinosaur)|Dilong]]''),&lt;ref name=Xuetal2004/&gt; but barbed feathers are known only among the coelurosaur subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds.&lt;ref name=KP04/&gt;&lt;ref name=GC06/&gt; The description of feathered dinosaurs has not been without controversy; perhaps the most vocal critics have been Alan Feduccia and Theagarten Lingham-Soliar, who have proposed that protofeathers are the result of the decomposition of collagenous fiber that underlaid the dinosaurs' integument,&lt;ref name=TLS03/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLH05/&gt;&lt;ref name=LSFX07/&gt; and that maniraptoran dinosaurs with barbed feathers were not actually dinosaurs, but [[convergent evolution|convergent]] with dinosaurs.&lt;ref name=AF02/&gt;&lt;ref name=FLH05/&gt; However, their views have for the most part not been accepted by other researchers, to the point that the question of the scientific nature of Feduccia's proposals has been raised.&lt;ref name=Prum2003/&gt;

===Skeleton===
Because feathers are often associated with birds, feathered dinosaurs are often touted as the [[transitional fossil|missing link]] between birds and dinosaurs. However, the multiple skeletal features also shared by the two groups represent another important line of evidence for [[paleontology|paleontologists]]. Areas of the skeleton with important similarities include the neck, [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[wrist]] (semi-lunate [[carpal]]), arm and [[pectoral girdle]], furcula (wishbone), and [[keel (bird)|breast bone]]. Comparison of bird and dinosaur skeletons through [[cladistics|cladistic analysis]] strengthens the case for the link.

===Soft anatomy===
[[File:Pneumatopores on the left ilium of the theropod Aerosteon riocoloradensis.jpg|thumb|Pneumatopores on the left [[ilium (bone)|ilium]] of ''[[Aerosteon|Aerosteon riocoloradensis]]'']]
Large meat-eating dinosaurs had a complex system of air sacs similar to those found in modern birds, according to an investigation which was led by Patrick O'Connor of [[Ohio University]]. The lungs of theropod dinosaurs (carnivores that walked on two legs and had bird-like feet) likely pumped air into hollow sacs in their [[skeleton]]s, as is the case in birds. &quot;What was once formally considered unique to birds was present in some form in the ancestors of birds&quot;, O'Connor said.&lt;ref name=OConnorClaessens2005/&gt; In a 2008 paper published in the online journal ''[[PLoS ONE]]'', scientists described ''[[Aerosteon|Aerosteon riocoloradensis]]'', the skeleton of which supplies the strongest evidence to date of a dinosaur with a bird-like breathing system. [[computed tomography|CT-scanning]] revealed the evidence of air sacs within the body cavity of the ''Aerosteon'' skeleton.&lt;ref name=Sereno2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=newswise2/&gt;

===Behavioral evidence===
Fossils of the [[Troodontidae|troodont]]s ''[[Mei (dinosaur)|Mei]]'' and ''[[Sinornithoides]]'' demonstrate that some dinosaurs slept with their heads tucked under their arms.&lt;ref name=XUNorell2004/&gt; This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several [[Deinonychosauria|deinonychosaur]] and [[Oviraptorosauria|oviraptorosaur]] specimens have also been found preserved on top of their nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner.&lt;ref name=&quot;norell1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author = Norell M.A., Clark J.M., Chiappe L.M., Dashzeveg D. | year = 1995 | title = A nesting dinosaur | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 378 | issue =6559 | pages = 774â776 |doi=10.1038/378774a0|bibcode = 1995Natur.378..774N }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the eggs were primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.&lt;ref name=Varricchioetal2008&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Varricchio | first1= D.

Some dinosaurs are known to have used [[gizzard]] stones like modern birds. These stones are swallowed by animals to aid digestion and break down food and hard fibers once they enter the stomach. When found in association with fossils, gizzard stones are called [[gastrolith]]s.&lt;ref name=wings2007/&gt;

==Extinction of major groups==
{{Main|CretaceousâTertiary extinction event|KâPg boundary}}

The discovery that birds are a type of dinosaur showed that dinosaurs in general are not, in fact, [[extinct]] as is commonly stated.&lt;ref name=mistaken&gt;Dingus, L. and Rowe, T. (1998). ''The Mistaken Extinction â Dinosaur Evolution and the Origin of Birds''. New York: W. H. Freeman.&lt;/ref&gt; However, all non-avian dinosaurs as well as many groups of birds did suddenly become [[extinct]] approximately 65&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Many other groups of animals also became extinct at this time, including [[ammonite]]s ([[nautilus]]-like [[mollusk]]s), [[mosasaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and many groups of [[mammal]]s.&lt;ref name=MacLeod/&gt; This [[mass extinction]] is known as the [[CretaceousâPaleogene extinction event]]. The nature of the event that caused this mass extinction has been extensively studied since the 1970s; at present, several related theories are supported by paleontologists. Though the consensus is that an impact event was the primary cause of dinosaur extinction, some scientists cite other possible causes, or support the idea that a confluence of several factors was responsible for the sudden disappearance of dinosaurs from the fossil record.

At the peak of the Mesozoic, there were no [[polar ice cap]]s, and sea levels are estimated to have been from 100 to 250&amp;nbsp;meters (300 to 800&amp;nbsp;ft) higher than they are today. The planet's temperature was also much more uniform, with only 25&amp;nbsp;Â°C (45&amp;nbsp;Â°F) separating average polar temperatures from those at the equator. On average, atmospheric temperatures were also much higher; the poles, for example, were 50&amp;nbsp;Â°C (90&amp;nbsp;Â°F) warmer than today.&lt;ref name=pmid16311326/&gt;&lt;ref name=McAetal2007/&gt;

The atmosphere's composition during the Mesozoic was vastly different as well. Carbon dioxide levels were up to 12&amp;nbsp;times higher than today's levels, and oxygen formed 32 to 35%&amp;nbsp;of the atmosphere,{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}} as compared to 21%&amp;nbsp;today. However, by the late Cretaceous, the environment was changing dramatically. Volcanic activity was decreasing, which led to a cooling trend as levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide dropped. Oxygen levels in the atmosphere also started to fluctuate and would ultimately fall considerably. Some scientists hypothesize that climate change, combined with lower oxygen levels, might have led directly to the demise of many species. If the dinosaurs had respiratory systems similar to those commonly found in modern birds, it may have been particularly difficult for them to cope with reduced respiratory efficiency, given the enormous oxygen demands of their very large bodies.&lt;ref name=MacLeod/&gt;

===Impact event===
{{Main|Chicxulub crater}}
[[Image:Chicxulub radar topography.jpg|thumb|The [[Chicxulub Crater]] at the tip of the [[YucatÃ¡n Peninsula]]; the impactor that formed this crater may have caused the dinosaur extinction.]]
The asteroid collision theory, which was brought to wide attention in 1980 by [[Walter Alvarez]] and colleagues, links the [[extinction event]] at the end of the Cretaceous period to a [[bolide]] impact approximately 65.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago. Alvarez ''et al.'' proposed that a sudden increase in [[iridium]] levels, recorded around the world in the period's rock stratum, was direct evidence of the impact.&lt;ref name=Alvarezetal80/&gt; The bulk of the evidence now suggests that a [[bolide]] 5 to 15&amp;nbsp;kilometers (3 to 9&amp;nbsp;mi) wide hit in the vicinity of the [[YucatÃ¡n Peninsula]] (in southeastern [[Mexico]]), creating the approximately {{convert|180|km|mi|abbr=on}} [[Chicxulub Crater]] and triggering the [[mass extinction]].&lt;ref name=ARHetal91/&gt;&lt;ref name=KPetal96/&gt; Scientists are not certain whether dinosaurs were thriving or declining before the [[impact event]]. Some scientists propose that the meteorite caused a long and unnatural drop in Earth's atmospheric temperature, while others claim that it would have instead created an unusual heat wave. The consensus among scientists who support this theory is that the impact caused extinctions both directly (by heat from the meteorite impact) and also indirectly (via a worldwide cooling brought about when matter ejected from the impact crater reflected thermal radiation from the sun). Although the speed of extinction cannot be deduced from the fossil record alone, various models suggest that the extinction was extremely rapid, being down to hours rather than years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robertson|first=D.S.|coauthors=et al.|title=Survival in the first hours of the Cenozoic|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|date=30 September|year=2003|volume=116|issue=5/6|pages=760â768|doi=10.1130/B25402.1|url=http://webh01.ua.ac.be/funmorph/raoul/macroevolutie/Robertson2004.pdf|accessdate=15 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2007, U.S. researchers led by William Bottke of the [[Southwest Research Institute]] in [[Boulder, Colorado]], and [[Czech Republic|Czech]] scientists used [[computer]] simulations to identify the probable source of the Chicxulub impact. They calculated a 90% probability that a giant asteroid named [[Baptistina]], approximately {{convert|160|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter, orbiting in the asteroid belt which lies between [[Mars]] and [[Jupiter]], was struck by a smaller unnamed asteroid about 55&amp;nbsp;km (35&amp;nbsp;mi) in diameter about 160&amp;nbsp;million years ago. The impact shattered Baptistina, creating a cluster which still exists today as the [[Baptistina family]]. Calculations indicate that some of the fragments were sent hurtling into earth-crossing orbits, one of which was the {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} wide [[meteorite]] which struck [[Mexico]]'s [[Yucatan]] [[peninsula]] 65&amp;nbsp;million years ago, creating the Chicxulub crater.&lt;ref name=Billiards/&gt; In 2011, new data from the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] revised the date of the collision which created the [[Baptistina family]] to about 80 million years ago. This makes an asteroid from this family highly improbable to be the asteroid that created the Chicxulub Crater, as typically the process of resonance and collision of an asteroid takes many tens of millions of years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Universe Today&quot;&gt;{{cite news | first=Tammy | last=Plotner | title=Did Asteroid Baptistina Kill the Dinosaurs?

A similar but more controversial explanation proposes that &quot;passages of the [hypothetical] solar companion star [[Nemesis (star)|Nemesis]] through the [[Oort cloud|Oort comet cloud]] would trigger comet showers.&quot;&lt;ref name=Koeberl/&gt; One or more of these comets then collided with the Earth at approximately the same time, causing the worldwide extinction. As with the impact of a single asteroid, the end result of this comet bombardment would have been a sudden drop in global temperatures, followed by a protracted cool period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Koeberl&quot;/&gt;

===Deccan Traps===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[CretaceousâTertiary extinction event]] --&gt;
{{Main|Deccan Traps}}

Before 2000, arguments that the [[Deccan Traps]] [[flood basalt]]s caused the [[extinction]] were usually linked to the view that the extinction was gradual, as the flood basalt events were thought to have started around 68&amp;nbsp;[[annum|million years ago]] and lasted for over 2 million years. However, there is evidence that two thirds of the Deccan Traps were created in only 1 million years about 65.5&amp;nbsp;million years ago, and so these eruptions would have caused a fairly rapid extinction, possibly over a period of thousands of years, but still longer than would be expected from a single impact event.&lt;ref name=wwnjsd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

The Deccan Traps could have caused extinction through several mechanisms, including the release into the air of dust and sulphuric aerosols, which might have blocked sunlight and thereby reduced photosynthesis in plants. In addition, Deccan Trap volcanism might have resulted in carbon dioxide emissions, which would have increased the [[greenhouse effect]] when the dust and aerosols cleared from the atmosphere.&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt; Before the mass extinction of the dinosaurs, the release of [[volcanic gas]]es during the formation of the [[Deccan Traps]] &quot;contributed to an apparently massive global warming. Some data point to an average rise in temperature of 8&amp;nbsp;Â°C (14&amp;nbsp;Â°F) in the last half million years before the [[Chicxulub Crater|impact [at Chicxulub]]].&quot;&lt;ref name=wwnjsd/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duncan/&gt;

In the years when the Deccan Traps theory was linked to a slower extinction, [[Luis Alvarez]] (who died in 1988) replied that [[paleontologists]] were being misled by [[SignorâLipps effect|sparse data]]. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept the idea that the mass extinctions at the end of the Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. However, even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, such as a drop in [[sea level]] and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions.&lt;ref name=Alvarez1997/&gt;

===Failure to adapt to changing conditions===
Lloyd ''et al.'' (2008) noted that, in the Mid Cretaceous, the flowering, [[angiosperm]] plants became a major part of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, which had previously been dominated by [[gymnosperm]]s such as conifers. Dinosaur [[coprolite]]âfossilized dungâindicate that, while some ate angiosperms, most herbivorous dinosaurs ate mainly gymnosperms. Statistical analysis by Lloyd ''et al.'' concluded that, contrary to earlier studies, dinosaurs did not diversify very much in the Late Cretaceous. Lloyd ''et al.'' suggested that dinosaurs' failure to diversify as ecosystems were changing doomed them to extinction.&lt;ref name=&quot;LDPEtAl2008&quot; /&gt;

===Possible Paleocene survivors===
{{Main|Paleocene dinosaurs}}
Non-avian dinosaur remains are occasionally found above the [[KâT boundary]]. In 2001, paleontologists Zielinski and Budahn reported the discovery of a single [[hadrosauridae|hadrosaur]] leg-bone fossil in the San Juan Basin, New Mexico, and described it as evidence of [[Paleocene dinosaurs]]. The formation in which the bone was discovered has been dated to the early [[Paleocene]] epoch, approximately 64.5 million years ago. If the bone was not re-deposited into that [[stratum]] by weathering action, it would provide evidence that some dinosaur populations may have survived at least a half million years into the Cenozoic Era.&lt;ref name=Fassett/&gt; Other evidence includes the finding of dinosaur remains in the [[Hell Creek Formation]] up to 1.3&amp;nbsp;meters (51&amp;nbsp;in) above ({{gaps|40|000}}&amp;nbsp;years later than) the KâT boundary. Similar reports have come from other parts of the world, including China.&lt;ref name=Sloan/&gt; Many scientists, however, dismissed the supposed Paleocene dinosaurs as re-worked, that is, washed out of their original locations and then re-buried in much later sediments.&lt;ref name=FS05/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt; However, direct dating of the bones themselves has supported the later date, with UâPb dating methods resulting in a precise age of 64.8 Â± 0.9 million years ago.&lt;ref name=fassettetall2011/&gt; If correct, the presence of a handful of dinosaurs in the early Paleocene would not change the underlying facts of the extinction.&lt;ref name=FS05/&gt;

==History of discovery==
Dinosaur fossils have been known for millennia, although their true nature was not recognized. The Chinese, whose modern word for dinosaur is ''konglong'' (æé¾, or &quot;terrible dragon&quot;), considered them to be [[Chinese dragon|dragon]] [[bone]]s and documented them as such. For example, ''Hua Yang Guo Zhi'', a book written by Zhang Qu during the [[Western Jin Dynasty]], reported the discovery of dragon bones at Wucheng in [[Sichuan]] Province.&lt;ref name=dong1992/&gt; Villagers in central China have long unearthed fossilized &quot;dragon bones&quot; for use in traditional medicines, a practice that continues today.&lt;ref name=BBCdinobonemed/&gt; In Europe, dinosaur fossils were generally believed to be the remains of [[Giant (mythology)|giants]] and other creatures killed by the [[Deluge (mythology)|Great Flood]].
[[Image:Stego-marsh-1896-US geological survey.png|thumb|Marsh's 1896 illustration of the bones of ''[[Stegosaurus]]'', a dinosaur he described and named in 1877.]]
Scholarly descriptions of what would now be recognized as dinosaur bones first appeared in the late 17th century in [[England]]. Part of a bone, now known to have been the [[femur]] of a ''[[Megalosaurus]]'',&lt;ref name=WAS97/&gt; was recovered from a limestone quarry at Cornwell near [[Chipping Norton, Oxfordshire|Chipping Norton]], [[Oxfordshire]], England, in 1676. The fragment was sent to [[Robert Plot]], Professor of Chemistry at the [[University of Oxford]] and first curator of the [[Ashmolean Museum]], who published a description in his ''Natural History of Oxfordshire'' in 1677. He correctly identified the bone as the lower extremity of the [[femur]] of a large animal, and recognized that it was too large to belong to any known species. He therefore concluded it to be the thigh bone of a [[Scrotum (dinosaur)|giant human]] similar to those mentioned in the [[Bible]]. In 1699, [[Edward Lhuyd]], a friend of [[Sir Isaac Newton]], was responsible for the first published scientific treatment of what would now be recognized as a dinosaur when he described and named a [[sauropod]] [[tooth]], &quot;[[Rutellum|Rutellum implicatum]]&quot;,&lt;ref name=L99/&gt;&lt;ref name=DS02/&gt; that had been found in Caswell, near Witney, Oxfordshire.&lt;ref name=G45/&gt;

[[Image:William Buckland detail.png|thumb|left|[[William Buckland]]]]
Between 1815 and 1824, the Rev [[William Buckland]], a professor of [[geology]] at [[University of Oxford|Oxford University]], collected more fossilized bones of ''Megalosaurus'' and became the first person to describe a dinosaur in a [[scientific journal]].&lt;ref name=WAS97/&gt;&lt;ref name=buckland1824/&gt; The second dinosaur genus to be identified, ''[[Iguanodon]]'', was discovered in 1822 by Mary Ann Mantell&amp;nbsp;â the wife of English geologist [[Gideon Mantell]]. Gideon Mantell recognized similarities between [http://collections.tepapa.govt.nz/objectdetails.aspx?oid=212194&amp;coltype=history&amp;regno=gh004839 his fossils] and the bones of modern [[iguana]]s. He published his findings in 1825.&lt;ref name=GM25/&gt;&lt;ref name=HDS97/&gt;

The study of these &quot;great fossil lizards&quot; soon became of great interest to European and American scientists, and in 1842 the English paleontologist [[Richard Owen]] coined the term &quot;dinosaur&quot;. He recognized that the remains that had been found so far, ''Iguanodon'', ''Megalosaurus'' and ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]'', shared a number of distinctive features, and so decided to present them as a distinct taxonomic group. With the backing of [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]], the husband of [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], Owen established the [[Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]], [[London]], to display the national collection of dinosaur fossils and other biological and geological exhibits.

In 1858, the first known American dinosaur was discovered, in [[marl]] pits in the small town of [[Haddonfield, New Jersey]] (although fossils had been found before, their nature had not been correctly discerned). The creature was named ''[[Hadrosaurus]] foulkii''. It was an extremely important find: ''Hadrosaurus'' was one of the first nearly complete dinosaur skeletons found ([[Iguanodon#Gideon Mantell, Sir Richard Owen, and the discovery of dinosaurs|the first]] was in 1834, in Maidstone, Kent, England), and it was clearly a [[bipedal]] creature. This was a revolutionary discovery as, until that point, most scientists had believed dinosaurs walked on four feet, like other lizards. Foulke's discoveries sparked a wave of dinosaur mania in the [[United States]].

[[Image:OthnielCharlesMarsh.jpg|130px|left|thumb|upright|[[Othniel Charles Marsh]], 19th century photograph]]
[[Image:edcope.jpg|130px|upright|thumb|[[Edward Drinker Cope]], 19th century photograph]]

Dinosaur mania was exemplified by the fierce rivalry between [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Othniel Charles Marsh]], both of whom raced to be the first to find new dinosaurs in what came to be known as the [[Bone Wars]]. The feud probably originated when Marsh publicly pointed out that Cope's reconstruction of an ''[[Elasmosaurus]]'' skeleton was flawed: Cope had inadvertently placed the [[plesiosaur]]'s head at what should have been the animal's tail end. The fight between the two scientists lasted for over 30 years, ending in 1897 when Cope died after spending his entire fortune on the dinosaur hunt. Marsh 'won' the contest primarily because he was better funded through a relationship with the [[US Geological Survey]]. Unfortunately, many valuable dinosaur specimens were damaged or destroyed due to the pair's rough methods: for example, their diggers often used [[dynamite]] to unearth bones (a method modern paleontologists would find appalling). Despite their unrefined methods, the contributions of Cope and Marsh to paleontology were vast: Marsh unearthed 86 new species of dinosaur and Cope discovered 56, a total of 142 new species. Cope's collection is now at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York]], while Marsh's is on display at the [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] at [[Yale University]].&lt;ref name=Holmes/&gt;

After 1897, the search for dinosaur fossils extended to every continent, including [[Antarctica]]. The first [[South Polar dinosaurs|Antarctic dinosaur]] to be discovered, the [[ankylosaur]]id ''[[Antarctopelta|Antarctopelta oliveroi]]'', was found on [[Ross Island]] in 1986, although it was 1994 before an Antarctic species, the theropod ''[[Cryolophosaurus ellioti]]'', was formally named and described in a scientific journal.

Current dinosaur &quot;hot spots&quot; include southern South America (especially [[Argentina]]) and [[China]]. China in particular has produced many exceptional [[feathered dinosaur]] specimens due to the unique geology of its dinosaur beds, as well as an ancient arid climate particularly conducive to fossilization.

===The &quot;dinosaur renaissance&quot;===
{{Main|Dinosaur renaissance}}
The field of dinosaur research has enjoyed a surge in activity that began in the 1970s and is ongoing. This was triggered, in part, by [[John Ostrom]]'s discovery of ''[[Deinonychus]]'', an active predator that may have been [[warm-blooded]], in marked contrast to the then-prevailing image of dinosaurs as sluggish and [[Poikilotherm|cold-blooded]]. [[Vertebrate paleontology]] has become a global [[science]]. Major new dinosaur discoveries have been made by paleontologists working in previously unexploited regions, including [[India]], South America, [[Madagascar]], [[Antarctica]], and most significantly [[China]] (the amazingly well-preserved [[feathered dinosaurs]] in [[China]] have further consolidated the link between dinosaurs and their conjectured living descendants, modern birds). The widespread application of [[cladistics]], which rigorously analyzes the relationships between biological organisms, has also proved tremendously useful in [[scientific classification|classifying]] dinosaurs. Cladistic analysis, among other modern techniques, helps to compensate for an often incomplete and fragmentary fossil record.

==Cultural depictions==
{{Main|Cultural depictions of dinosaurs}}
By human standards, dinosaurs were creatures of fantastic appearance and often enormous size. As such, they have captured the popular imagination and become an enduring part of human culture. Entry of the word &quot;dinosaur&quot; into the common [[vernacular]] reflects the animals' cultural importance: in English, &quot;dinosaur&quot; is commonly used to describe anything that is impractically large, obsolete, or bound for extinction.&lt;ref name=m-w/&gt;

Public enthusiasm for dinosaurs first developed in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] England, where in 1854, three decades after the first scientific descriptions of dinosaur remains, the famous [[Crystal Palace dinosaurs|dinosaur sculptures]] were unveiled in [[London]]'s [[Crystal Palace Park]]. The Crystal Palace dinosaurs proved so popular that a strong market in smaller replicas soon developed. In subsequent decades, dinosaur exhibits opened at parks and [[Museum#Natural history museums|museums]] around the world, ensuring that successive generations would be introduced to the animals in an immersive and exciting way.&lt;ref name=torrens1993/&gt; Dinosaurs' enduring popularity, in its turn, has resulted in significant public funding for dinosaur science, and has frequently spurred new discoveries. In the United States, for example, the competition between museums for public attention led directly to the [[Bone Wars]] of the 1880s and 1890s, during which a pair of feuding paleontologists made enormous scientific contributions.&lt;ref name=breithaupt1997/&gt;

The popular preoccupation with dinosaurs has ensured their appearance in [[literature]], [[film]] and other [[Media (communication)|media]]. Beginning in 1852 with a passing mention in [[Charles Dickens|Charles Dickens']] ''[[Bleak House]]'',&lt;ref name=bleakhouse/&gt; dinosaurs have been featured in large numbers of [[fiction]]al works. [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]]'s 1912 book ''[[The Lost World (Conan Doyle novel)|The Lost World]]'', the iconic 1933 [[motion picture|film]] ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'', 1954's ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' and its many sequels, the best-selling 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' by [[Michael Crichton]] and its 1993 [[Jurassic Park (film)|film adaptation]] are just a few notable examples of dinosaur appearances in fiction. Authors of general-interest [[non-fiction]] works about dinosaurs, including some prominent paleontologists, have often sought to use the animals as a way to educate readers about science in general. Dinosaurs are ubiquitous in [[advertising]]; numerous [[Company (law)|companies]] have referenced dinosaurs in printed or televised advertisements, either in order to sell their own products or in order to characterize their rivals as slow-moving, dim-witted or obsolete.&lt;ref name=DFGlut1997/&gt;
