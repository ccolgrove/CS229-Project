'''Tinfoil Hat Linux''' (THL) was a compact [[Linux distribution]] designed for high [[security]]. Version 1.000 was released in February 2002. It appears to be no longer actively maintained {{As of|2010|lc=on}}, though the files are still available in [[gzip]] format. THL requires a [[Intel 80386|386DX]] computer or better, with at least 8 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[Random access memory|RAM]]. The distribution fits on a single ordinary [[Floppy_disk#Reported_3.5.22_DS-HD_floppy_capacity|HD floppy]]. The small footprint provides additional benefits beyond making the system easy to understand and verify- the computer need not even have a [[hard drive]], making it easier to &quot;sanitize&quot; the computer after use.

The logo of Tinfoil Hat is [[Tux]], the Linux mascot, wearing a [[tinfoil hat]].

==Security features==
Tinfoil Hat uses a number of measures to defeat hardware and software surveillance methods like [[keystroke logging]], [[video camera]], and [[TEMPEST]]:

*Encryption â [[GNU Privacy Guard]] (GPG) [[public key cryptography]] software is included in THL.
*Data retrieval â All temporary files are created on an encrypted [[RAM disk|ramdisk]] that is destroyed on shutdown. Even the GPG keyfile information can be stored encrypted on the floppy.
*Keystroke monitoring â THL has gpggrid, a wrapper for GPG that lets you use a video game style character entry system instead of typing in your [[passphrase]]. [[Keystroke logging|Keystroke logger]]s get a set of grid points, not your passphrase.
*Power usage and other [[side channel attack]]s â Under the Paranoid options, a copy of GPG runs in the background generating keys and encrypting random documents. This makes it harder to determine when real encryption is taking place.
*Even [[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|reading the screen over the user's shoulder]] is very hard when Tinfoil Hat is switched to paranoid mode,  which sets the screen to a very low [[Contrast (vision)|contrast]].

==Applications==
An advantage of THL is that it can be used on virtually any modern [[Personal computer|PC]] using the [[x86]] processor architecture. For example, one might install it on a computer that is kept in a locked room, not connected to any [[Computer network|network]], and used only for [[Cryptography|cryptographically]] signing [[Cryptographic key|keys]]. While the [[Paranoia|paranoid]] mode security measures may seem over the top and might be found funny, they are a good education in the types of issues that must be considered for high security.  It is fairly easy to create the Tinfoil Hat [[booting]] floppy with [[Microsoft Windows]]. Verifying the [[checksum]] can be more tricky. The text of the documentation is salted with just a few jokes, which reinforces their humor by the stark contrast with the serious and paranoiac tone of the surrounding text- the very name pokes fun at itself, as [[Tinfoil hat]]s are commonly ascribed to paranoiacs as a method of protecting oneself from mind-control waves.

Tinfoil Hat Linux requires one to work in a text-only environment in Linux, i.e. starting straight off with a Bourne shell and the editor [[vi]], not a [[graphical user interface]]. It uses [[BusyBox]] instead of the normal [[util-linux]], the [[GNU Core Utilities|GNU coreutils]] (formerly known as fileutils, shellutils and textutils) and other common [[Unix]] tools. Tinfoil Hat also offers the [[nano (text editor)|nano]] text editor.
