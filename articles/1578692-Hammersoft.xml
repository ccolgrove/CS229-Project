'''The Magarey Medal''' is an [[Australian rules football]] honour awarded annually since 1898 to the fairest and most brilliant player in the [[South Australian National Football League]] (SANFL), as judged by field umpires.  The award was created by [[William Ashley Magarey]], then chairman of the league.

After each match, the three field umpires (those umpires who control the flow of the game) confer and award 3, 2 and 1 points to the players they regard as the best, second best and third best during the match.  Players suspended for a reportable offence during the season are ineligible to win the award. 

== History ==
William Magarey was born in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]]. A lawyer by vocation, he had an enduring interest in sports, although he did not play football.  He was, however, an active sports administrator who, in 1897, became the inaugeral Chairman of the South Australian Football Association (later renamed the SANFL).   The sport at that time was known for often rough play, and Magarey wanted to help combat this, and help gain more respect for umpires.

In 1898 Magarey presented the first Medal to South Australiaâs &quot;fairest and most brilliant player&quot; of that season.  Similar [[Best and Fairest]] player awards followed in other state-based competitions, notably the [[Sandover Medal]] in [[Western Australia]] from 1921 and [[Brownlow Medal]] in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]] from 1924. 

The Magarey Medal has been awarded in every year of SANFL competition since 1898, with the exception of 1900, 1904 (no record being extant), when the competition was suspended due to war 1916-1918, and when a restricted competition was held during the war period of 1942-1944.

In the 1990s the awarding of the medal was changed so that players tied on the most number of votes would share the medal.  Prior to this, a &quot;countback&quot; system was used, whereby the player with the most &quot;best on ground&quot; performances would be awarded the medal.  In 1998, ten players who had finished runner-up over prior years owing to the countback rule were retrospectively awarded the Magarey Medal.

== Recipients ==
The first recipient of the Magarey Medal was [[Norwood Football Club|Norwoodâs]] [[Alby Green]] in 1898.  The following players have been multiple recipients of the medal.
