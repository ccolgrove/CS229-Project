Seghill used to be a busy pit village within the Northumberland Coalfield, however, the Coal Mine has been closed for many years. The folk song &quot;[[Blackleg Miner]]&quot;, as covered by [[Steeleye Span]], originates from the area and contains the lyric:
::::&lt;em&gt;Dinna gang near the Seghill mine
::::Across the way, they stretch a line
::::To catch the throat and break the spine
::::Of the dirty blackleg miner.&lt;/em&gt;

Seghill served by a railway station but it was closed in November 1964 along with the rest of the passenger services on the [[Blyth &amp; Tyne Railway|Blyth &amp; Tyne]] route north of [[Backworth]]. It still has a [[level crossing]] which sees the occasional [[goods train]].

[[Image:Image-Seghill Welfare Field.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Seghill Welfare Field]]
On '''Seghill Welfare Field''' Seghill Rugby and Football Club regularly practice on Saturday and Sunday mornings. The '''Annual Gala and Fair''' is held on the Welfare Field. It is a chance for the whole village to enjoy an otherwise normal day. It gives younger children of the village the chance to ride on floats, compete in races and fancy dress competitions and of course enjoy the amusements and attractions, provided by the Seghill Treats Committee. In the summer months, when the nights are light, '''AFC Seghill''' can also be found training on the welfare field.

;AFC Seghill
Formed in 2007, AFC Seghill play in the Community Champions League. The league consists of teams from North of the Tyne and games take place on a Sunday afternoon. Managed and Captained by Ian Clark, Seghill had a good first season finishing 3rd in the league, just one place below a playoff position. On April 6th 2008 Seghill played in the NK Cup Final against Sports For Youth in sub zero conditions. Despite losing 2 players to the cold in the 2nd half Seghill came from behind twice to win the game 3-2 and claim their first piece of silverware in their rookie season. 

Despite starting their second season with an unbeaten run that stretched beyond Christmas and building up a double figure lead over their nearest rivals, Seghill were eventually undone by the weather. Due to the large number of postponed fixtures throughout the season Seghill were left to play out the last few weeks with 3 or more games per week. This led to problems with squad members securing time off work and with just a couple of games left Seghill were pipped at the post to finish 2nd in the league. Despite it being a better showing than the previous season there was widespread disappointment that the season had ended without any silverware.
