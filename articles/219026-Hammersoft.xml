{{nihongo|'''Koji Kondo'''|è¿è¤ æµ©æ²»|KondÅ KÅji|born August 13, 1960}} is a Japanese [[video game music|video game composer]] and [[director of audiography|sound director]] who has been employed at [[Nintendo]] since 1984. He is best known for scoring numerous titles in the ''[[Mario (series)|Mario]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Born in [[Nagoya]], Japan, Koji Kondo began taking lessons in the [[electronic organ]] from the age of five. He improved his skills in the instrument in a [[cover band]] that played [[jazz]] and [[rock music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; Kondo studied at the Art Planning Department of [[Osaka University of Arts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.music4games.net/News_Display.aspx?id=506|title=Mario and Zelda composer Koji Kondo shares all at GDC '07|publisher=[[Music4Games]]|date=2007-01-19|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was never classically-trained or particularly dedicated to music. However, he gained some experience in composing and arranging pieces, using both the piano and a computer to assist him. During his senior year, [[Nintendo]] sent a recruitment message to his university stating that they were interested in hiring people dedicated to composition and sound programming. An [[liquid crystal display|LCD]] and [[arcade game]]r, Kondo successfully applied for the job in 1984 without requiring any [[demo (music)|demo tapes]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.squareenixmusic.com/composers/kondo/index.shtml|title=Koji Kondo|publisher=Square Enix Music Online|author=Chris|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Career===
Kondo was the first person hired by Nintendo for the purpose of creating compositions, and was to play an integral role in making the company's games and music recognizable worldwide. The first games he scored were the arcade games ''Vs. Golf'' and ''[[Punch-Out!! (arcade game)|Punch-Out!!]]''. Despite creating very little music, he was able to overcome the challenges of [[sound design]]. As the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] had become highly popular in Japan, Kondo was assigned to compose music for the console's subsequent games at Nintendo's new development team, [[Nintendo Entertainment Analysis and Development]] (EAD). Kondo also wrote an instruction manual on how to program Japanese [[popular music]] into the Famicom using the [[peripheral]] ''[[Family BASIC]]''. To conclude his first year at Nintendo, he created the music to ''[[Devil World]]'' alongside Akito Nakatsuka.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; In 1985, Nintendo started marketing the Famicom abroad under the name the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) to capitalize on the [[North American video game crash of 1983|1983 video game crash]] that devastated [[Atari, Inc.]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; He composed the music for the hit releases ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' (1985)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/action/supermariobros/tech_info.html?tag=tabs;summary|title=Super Mario Bros. Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Legend of Zelda (video game)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' (1986)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/adventure/legendofzelda/tech_info.html?tag=tabs;summary|title=The Legend of Zelda Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which helped the system to sell 60 million copies in total and established some of the most well-known melodies in the [[video game industry]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Koji Kondo - GDC 2007 cropped.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Kondo at the Game Developers Conference 2007]]
''Super Mario Bros.'', for many years the best-selling video game of all time, was Kondo's first major score. The game's melodies were created with the intention that short segments of music could be endlessly repeated during the same gameplay without causing boredom. Kondo's soundtrack to ''Super Mario Bros.'' gained worldwide recognition, and is to this day the most well-known video game score. [[Super Mario Bros. theme|The main theme]] is iconic in popular culture and has been featured in over 50 concerts,&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; been a best-selling ringtone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://moconews.net/article/top-selling-ringtones-in-us-for-2006/|title=Top Selling Ringtones In US For 2006|publisher=mocoNews|first=James Quintana|last=Pearce|date=2007-01-04|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and been remixed or [[sampling (music)|sampled]] by various musicians.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; Kondo's work on ''The Legend of Zelda'' scores has also become highly recognized. He produced four main pieces of background music for the first installment of the series; the overworld theme has become comparable in popularity with the ''Super Mario Bros.'' main theme. Following the success of ''The Legend of Zelda'', he provided the score for two Japanese-exclusive titles, ''[[Nazo no Murasame JÅ]]'' (1986) and ''[[Shin Onigashima]]'' (1987). He also created the soundtrack to ''[[Yume KÅjÅ: Doki Doki Panic]]'' (1987),&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; which was later rebranded outside of Japan as ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/833/833615p2.html|title=IGN Presents The History of Super Mario Bros.|publisher=[[IGN]]|first=Rus|last=McLaughlin|date=2007-11-08|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/nes/action/supermariobros2/tech_info.html?tag=tabs;summary|title=Super Mario Bros. 2 Tech Info|publisher=[[GameSpot]]|accessdate=2009-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kondo returned to the ''Super Mario'' series to produce the scores to ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' (1988) and the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|SNES]] launch title ''[[Super Mario World]]'' (1990). [[Koichi Sugiyama]] directed a jazz arrangement album of ''Super Mario World''{{'}}s music and oversaw its performance at the first [[Orchestral Game Music Concerts|Orchestral Game Music Concert]] in 1991. After finishing the soundtrack to ''Super Mario World'', Kondo was in charge of the sound programming for ''[[Pilotwings]]'', and created the sound effects for ''[[Star Fox (video game)|Star Fox]]''. In 1995 he composed for the sequel to ''Super Mario World'', ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Biography&quot;/&gt; Until the [[Nintendo 64]] era, Kondo would usually write all compositions for a game, ending with ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time]]'' as the last score he worked alone on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wired.com/science/discoveries/news/2007/03/72971 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5wSqL8j29 |archivedate=2011-02-13 |title=Behind the Mario Maestro's Music |date=2007-03-15 |author=Kohler, Chris |work=Wired |publisher=[[CondÃ© Nast Digital]] |accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, he has been collaborating with other staff members at Nintendo EAD, supervising music created by others, as well as providing additional compositions for games such as ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'', ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite album-notes |title=Super Mario Galaxy Original Sound Track Platinum Version |url=http://vgmdb.net/album/5411 |year=2008 |publisher=[[Nintendo Co., Ltd.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/news/mario-music |title=How Mario Music Gets Made |author=Gifford, Kevin |date=2010-02-24 |work=[[1UP.com]] |publisher=[[UGO Entertainment, Inc.]] |accessdate=2010-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;osvint&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.originalsoundversion.com/koji-kondo-talks-ocarina-of-time-gives-details-on-skyward-sword/ |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5zdCAJDVF |archivedate=June 22, 2011 |title=Koji Kondo Talks Ocarina of Time, Gives Details on Skyward Sword |date=June 21, 2011 |author=Napolitano, Jayson |work=Original Sound Version |accessdate=June 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerts==
Kondo attended the world-premiere of [[Play! A Video Game Symphony]] at the [[Rosemont Theater]] in [[Rosemont, Illinois]] in May 2006. His music from the ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'' and ''[[The Legend of Zelda]]'' series was performed by a full symphony orchestra. This event drew nearly four thousand attendees. He also attended and performed in a series of three concerts celebrating the 25th anniversary of The Legend of Zelda series in late 2011.

==Musical style and influences==
The &quot;[[Super Mario Bros. theme]]&quot; reached number one on ''[[Billboard Magazine]]''{{'}}s [[Hot Ringtones]] chart in 2009.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Kondo cites rock bands [[Deep Purple]] and [[Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer]] as major musical influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.zelda.com/universe/game/twilightprincess/inside04.jsp |title=Inside Zelda Part 4: Natural Rhythms of Hyrule |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |issue=195 |date=September 2005 |publisher=[[Nintendo of America, Inc.]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He has also cited as influences the works of the Russian romantic composer [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], particularly his four piano concertos.
