The episodes involved the [[The Beale/Fowler family|Fowler and Beale family]] travelling from [[London]] to the &quot;Emerald Isle&quot;, to meet their long-lost relatives. They were badly received by viewers and heavily criticised in the media. The BBC was inundated with complaints from angry viewers from Ireland for negative stereotyping, portraying Irish people as &quot;dirty, rude, and drunk&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Italy&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61053150.html Italy's Square deal; LAST NIGHT'S VIEW]&quot;, ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''.

The BBC was forced to issue an apology for causing offence.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,564651,00.html |title= No soft soapbox|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' | author = Summerskill, Ben| date = 2001-10-07| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storyline development==
In 1997, ''EastEnders'' aired a storyline in which the character [[Pauline Fowler]] ([[Wendy Richard]]) discovered that she had a long-lost sister, [[#Maggie Flaherty|Maggie Flaherty]]. In the storyline, Pauline's deceased mother [[Lou Beale|Lou]] had given Maggie up for adoption shortly after her birth, as she was born out of wedlock. Maggie was said to be the result of an illicit affair Lou had with an Irishman 60 years prior, but although Maggie was initially thought to be Paulineâs half sister, it later transpired that they shared the same father too; she was only the result of pre-marital sex between Lou and her husband-to-be, [[Albert Beale]]. 

Pauline and various members of the Fowler and Beale family travelled to Ireland to reunite with their long-lost relatives in a special week of episodes. The episodes were filmed on location in the countryside around [[County Dublin]], away from the soap's typical filming location in [[Borehamwood]], [[Elstree]], [[England]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ireland&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61088991.html |title= EastEnders' stars arrive in the Emerald Isle|publisher=''The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland)'' | author = | date = 1997-07-23| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were filmed over a period of two weeks in July and August 1997, and were broadcast on 22, 23 and 25 September 1997. In the three episodes, Pauline was accompanied by her sons [[Mark Fowler|Mark]] and [[Martin Fowler (EastEnders)|Martin]] ([[Todd Carty]] and [[James Alexandrou]]), Mark's wife [[Ruth Fowler|Ruth]] ([[Caroline Paterson]]), nephew [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]) and his daughter [[Lucy Beale|Lucy]] ([[Casey Anne Rothery]]). Speaking about their trip to Dublin, actress Wendy Richard who played Pauline said &quot;It's nice to be in Dublin for a change. It's not like London at all, where they take you a little bit for granted&quot;, and Todd Carty, who played her screen son Mark, said &quot;It's also really nice to get out of Albert Square for a while to do something different.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ireland1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61076383.html |title= Albert Square's touch of Blarney as the Fowlers find lost family; EASTENDER PAULINE COMES WEST|publisher=''The Mirror'' | author = Taylor, Richie| date = 1997-07-23| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

A number of Irish actors were cast as Pauline's long-lost relatives, many of whom were starring in their first prominent television role.&lt;ref name=&quot;ireland1&quot;/&gt; They included Maggie Flaherty, played by [[Olivia Shanley]], son [[Conor Flaherty|Conor]] ([[SeÃ¡n Gleeson|Sean Gleeson]]) and his headstrong daughter [[Mary Flaherty (EastEnders)|Mary]] ([[Melanie Clark Pullen]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;mel&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20010204/ai_n14524642 I felt so lonely and isolated when I went to work on EastEnders]&quot;, ''Sunday Mirror''. URL last accessed on 2007-03-31.&lt;/ref&gt; For the latter two characters, Conor and Mary, the Ireland episodes were only the beginning of their stint in ''EastEnders''. Both characters remained in the serial as regulars, moving back to the soap's setting in [[Albert Square]] to be with the new found family. They remained on-screen for two years. At the time of filming the Ireland epiosodes, Gleeson, from [[Thurles]], [[County Tipperary]], said, &quot;The ''EastEnders'' cast are all really nice people&quot;, and Shanley said, &quot;I've always been a big fan of ''EastEnders'' and to tell the truth I was a bit star struck [...] But they made us all feel very much at ease.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ireland1&quot;/&gt; Clark Pullen added, &quot;I was expecting the cast to be luvvies but they were all brilliant â real grafters and totally down to earth. They were all very supportive as well and made me feel right at home. I was pretty starstruck [...] Wendy Richard who plays Pauline Fowler was great â she is the most wonderful woman and she quietly gave me advice on how to cope with the sudden fame and attention.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pullen&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4161/is_20000102/ai_n9706465 |title= MY LIFE WITHOUT SOAP: Interview - Melanie Clark Pullen|publisher=''Sunday Mirror'' | author = Doherty, Amanda| date = 2000-01-02| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were also joined by a host of other characters, including Maggie's husband Sean ([[Pat Laffan]]), second son Eamonn ([[Maurice O'Donoghue]]), Eamonn's wife Brenda ([[Janet Behan]]) and daughter Colette ([[Shiona Redmond]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;ireland1&quot;/&gt;

==Reception==
The episodes were not well received by viewers or the media. The BBC and the programme makers were heavily criticised for the [[stereotype|stereotypical]] way they portrayed [[Irish people]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61058550.html|title=WHAT A LOAD OF PORK PIES; Ireland's full of drunkards, dimwits and donkeys according to EastEnders|publisher=''The Mirror''| author = Kierans, John| date = 1997-09-24| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers were angered by scenes that they felt portrayed Irish as resentful towards English, drunk, dirty, poor and rude â one scene showed a drunk man pouring beer over Pauline Fowler (later revealed to be her brother-in-law), and then demanding payment for the drink.&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; Others were angered by the scriptwriters decision to include various farm animals in a street scene on the outskirts of Dublin, with one viewer commenting to the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'': &quot;It was nothing like life in the real Ireland of today. When did you last see a donkey walking along our streets? The EastEnders production team haven't got a clue about modern Irish society; they are living in the Dark Ages.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt;

The BBC and [[RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann|RTÃ]] (the Public Service Broadcaster of Ireland) received complaints from angry Irish people all over Britain and Ireland, and it was reported that viewers &quot;bombarded&quot; local and national radio stations, claiming the episodes were an insult to Irish people everywhere.&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oirish&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61144901.html|title= Irish Eastenders' fans in a lather over soap Oirish over Dublin|publisher=''The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland)''| author = | date = 1997-09-24| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Callers to [[Radio Ulster]]'s [[Talk radio#Talk radio in the United Kingdom|Talkback]] programme and [[Gerry Ryan]]'s morning talk show on [[RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann|RTÃ radio]], demanded that the scriptwriters be sacked. BBC contributor Mike Philpott described the show as &quot;the worst case of stage 'Oirish' seen for a long time&quot; and &quot;one of the most shameful half-hour episodes in the history of British television&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oirish&quot;/&gt; 

The angry reaction stretched from official channels, such as the [[Diplomatic missions of Ireland|Irish Embassy]], to holiday chiefs, who feared that the episodes would have a negative affect on tourist trade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oirish&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ofcom&quot; /&gt;  The Irish Embassy in London said, &quot;[''EastEnders''] has caused a great deal of upset and annoyance in the country [Ireland] and with Irish people in Britain.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; Furthermore, they suggested that the episodes &quot;presented a prejudiced and stereotyped view of Ireland that [was] utterly unrecognisable.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; Ted Barrington, Ireland's [[ambassador]] to the UK, described the portrayal of Ireland as an &quot;unrepresentative caricature&quot;, stating he was worried by the negative stereotypes and the images of drunkenness, backwardness and isolation.&lt;ref name=&quot;dirty&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61151274.html|title= Soap does the dirty on Ãire says envoy|publisher=''The News Letter (Belfast, Northern Ireland)''| author = | date = 1997-09-25| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added, &quot;EastEnders is a powerful and very concentrated medium â¦ People are upset at the caricature and misrepresentation of Ireland. Irish people can laugh at themselves but, the point is, this is one of the most popular programmes on British television, and it decided to present an image of Ireland that conforms to old-fashioned negative stereotypes. It selected an unrepresentative range of stereotypes. Cultural and racial stereotyping tends to create barriers between people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;dirty&quot;/&gt;
 
Mark Mortell, the chairman of Ireland's national tourism development, [[FÃ¡ilte Ireland|Bord FÃ¡ilte]], said: &quot;I am enormously concerned that the single biggest television audience in Britain was shown a negative image of Irish hospitality â¦ It has the potential to be enormously damaging.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Oirish&quot;/&gt;  His colleague, John Lahiffe, added: &quot;I am dismayed by the mischievous nature of it. We go to great efforts to promote this country, but it was in no way representative of Ireland.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt;  

Various Irish entertainers and sports personalities also went public with their opinions on the episodes. Broadcaster [[Gerry Kelly (broadcaster)|Gerry Kelly]] labelled the episodes racist, and an unmitigated disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61112421.html|title=I blame Irish actors for selling us short|publisher=''The People''| author = Kelly, Gerry| date = 1997-09-28| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Irish actors, who were employed specifically for the storyline, were also criticised by Kelly for not speaking out against the scenes they were enacting. He accused them of selling out their heritage and denigrating their fellow-countrymen.&lt;ref name=&quot;people&quot;/&gt; Comic [[Brendan O'Carroll]] said, &quot;Whoever wrote the script has obviously never been to Ireland. I'm very disappointed because ''EastEnders'' is a programme I have great respect for. It is outrageous and untrue to portray us like that. I'm disappointed the producers allowed it to be broadcast as it was.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; Former [[jockey]] and TV presenter Declan Murphy said, &quot;It's wrong and disgraceful when writers portray everyone from Ireland as backward drunks. I am an Irishman and I'm proud of it, but I'm not a drunk and I'm certainly not backward and neither are my compatriots.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; Actor Garret Keogh, who played an &quot;ignorant&quot; Irish hotel owner in the ''EastEnders'' episodes, revealed: &quot;The streets around [[Cabra, Dublin|Cabra]], where I live, are hopping. I went down to get the paper and some bread and I was accosted. The script has stirred up a hell of a hornets' nest here. I'm only an actor, but I wouldn't want to do anything that would be demeaning to me, my people or my country.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; However, actor [[Dermot Morgan]] urged Irish people not to overreact: &quot;I'm sure there's no great conspiracy against Irish people here. The BBC have a good track record and this would seem to be a dodgy storyline that has somehow crept through. As for being drunks, surely they must only mean on a Saturday night!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61058551.html|title=BEEB'S APOLOGY FOR TV INSULT TO IRISH|publisher=''The Mirror''| author = Kierans, John| date = 1997-09-24| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Complaints were upheld by the British [[Ofcom|Broadcasting Standards Commission]], who said &quot;the intention was positive rather than negative but the result was clumsy and irritating&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofcom&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61066865.html|title= Soap rapped for 'irritating' Irish scenes|publisher=''The Mirror''| author = Tallant, Nicola| date = 1997-09-28| accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BBC said, &quot;EastEnders has a reputation for showing slices of life in many different ways and sometimes these are not flattering&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;pork&quot;/&gt; but they admitted that the episodes were &quot;ill-judged&quot; and issued a public apology for causing offence and misrepresenting Irish people.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofcom&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;beeb&quot;/&gt; [[Jana Bennett]], the BBC's then director of production, stated on [[BBC One|BBC1]]'s news bulletin: &quot;It is clear that a significant number of viewers have been upset by the recent episodes of ''EastEnders'', and we are very sorry, because the production team and programme makers did not mean to cause any offence.&quot; A year later, in 1998, BBC chairman [[Christopher Bland]] admitted that as result of the Irish-set ''EastEnders'' episodes, the station failed in its pledge to represent all groups accurately and avoid reinforcing prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/172718.stm BBC sets out pledges], ''BBC News''.

'''Margaret &quot;Maggie&quot; Flaherty''' (nÃ©e '''Medeemey''') was born [[illegitimacy|illegitimately]] to [[Lou Beale|Louise Medeemey]] before Lou's marriage to [[Albert Beale]]. She was given up for [[adoption]], as she was born out of wedlock, and was sent to live with a family in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

In 1996, eight years after Lou died in 1988, her youngest daughter [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] found a letter from Lou to her best friend [[Ethel Skinner|Ethel]], revealing that she had a secret daughter. Pauline and her family tried to find Maggie, and when they did, they visited her in Kilmoneen, Ireland.

Whilst in Ireland, Maggie's lecherous husband [[#Sean Flaherty|Sean]] flirted with Pauline, and was abusive to his granddaughter, [[Mary Flaherty (EastEnders)|Mary]]. When Pauline and her family left, taking Mary with them, she begged Maggie to leave Sean and return to [[Walford]] with her, but Maggie decided to stay and look after her vast family. This was the last time she was seen.
Her all grown up family sent a wreath to Pauline's funeral in 2006.

'''Sean Flaherty''', portrayed by Pat Laffin, is first seen as a [[lust|lecherous]] [[alcoholism|drunk]] in a pub in the Irish village of Kilmoneen. Sean leered over Pauline's [[breasts]] and tried to buy her a drink, only to be told to leave her alone by Ian. He later went over to Pauline and tried to touch her, spilling [[stout]] on her. He was then thrown out of the bar.&lt;ref name=&quot;mon&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.walford.net/update/19970922.htm MON 22-SEP-97]&quot;, ''walford.net''. URL last accessed 2007-03-07&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, when Pauline was at Maggie's house, and her eldest son Eamonn brought his father home, Pauline was shocked to see that Maggie was married to Sean.&lt;ref name=&quot;mon&quot;/&gt;

Eamonn later told Sean of his granddaughter Mary's affair with married man [[#Gerry McCrae|Gerry McCrae]]. Maggie raced to Mary's school to collect her before violent Sean could get to her. She begged Pauline to take Mary back to [[Walford]] with her. Pauline got Sean drunk until he fell asleep and then helped Maggie pack Mary's clothes.&lt;ref name=&quot;thu&quot;&gt;&quot;[http://www.walford.net/update/19970925.htm THU 25-SEP-97]&quot;, ''walford.net''.

Eamonn was unwelcoming to his long-lost relatives, and extremely loyal to his drunken father. He defended his father's bullying to his long-lost cousin [[Ian Beale]], and they nearly came to blows because of this. According to the Kilmoneen hotelier, Patrick, Eamonn had been on the receiving end of his father's abuse as a child and was severely whipped with a belt for stealing chocolate. Patrick commented, &quot;you don't break the [[Ten Commandments|commandments]], not in Sean's house&quot;. Even though he was of aware of the potential repercussions, Eamonn informed his father that his niece [[Mary Flaherty (EastEnders)|Mary]] had been having an affair with a married man, and Sean was furious. Maggie feared for her safety, so she sent her to London to live with Pauline.
