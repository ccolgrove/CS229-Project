Over the course of the team's history, the team has had several logos while wearing virtually the same uniforms over the years, with subtle changes made to give the uniforms an updated look. The team colors, uniforms, and logo are often ranked as being among the best in the [[National Football League|NFL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/jay_mohr/11/09/mohr.sports/1.html|title=Queer Eye for the NFL Guy (cont.)|publisher=SI.com | date=November 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/647485-2011-nfl-power-rankings-all-32-teams-full-uniforms/page/33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Colors==
The Steelers have used [[black]] and [[Yellow (color)|yellow]] as their colors since the club's inception, the lone exception being the 1943 season when they merged with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and formed the &quot;[[Steagles]]&quot;; the team's colors at that time were green and white as a result of wearing Eagles uniforms. Originally, the team wore Gold-colored helmets and black jerseys. Unique to Pittsburgh, the Steelers' black and gold colors are now shared by all major professional teams in the city, including the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in baseball and the [[Pittsburgh Penguins]] in hockey. These also are the colors of the [[Flag of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|city's official flag]].

==Logo==
The Steelers have had several logos in the early part of their history, among them including the [[Crest (heraldry)|crest]] of Pittsburgh, a football with Pittsburgh's then-[[smog]]gy skyline, as well as a [[construction worker]] hanging onto a chain holding a [[Pennon|pennant]]. Another logo showed the worker [[punt (football)|punting]] a football on a [[Beam (structure)|steel beam]]. It is rumored that controversial mascot Steely McBeam was based on the latter logo.&lt;ref&gt;http://chriscreamer.com/team.php?id=156&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1963, the team has used a [[Stencil (typeface)|stencil]] typeface for their script logo. Since then, many team-related typefaces have used stencil font.

The team's current primary logo was introduced in 1962 and is based on the flag originally designed by Pittsburgh's [[U.S. Steel]] and now owned by the [[American Iron and Steel Institute]] (AISI). [[BrownsâSteelers rivalry|Ironically]], it was Robert Sexton, an employee out of the Pittsburgh office of [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]]-based [[Republic Steel]], that suggested the Steelers adopt the industry logo. It consists of the word &quot;Steelers&quot; surrounded by three [[astroid]]s ([[hypocycloid]]s of four [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]s). The original meanings behind the astroids were, &quot;Steel lightens your work, brightens your leisure, and widens your world.&quot; Later, the colors came to represent the ingredients used in the steel-making process: yellow for coal, orange for iron ore, and blue for scrap steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.steel.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&amp;TEMPLATE=/CM/ContentDisplay.cfm&amp;CONTENTID=12452|title=The Story Behind the Pittsburgh Steelers Logo|publisher=AISI}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the formal Steelmark logo contains only the word &quot;Steel,&quot; the team was given permission to add &quot;ers&quot; in 1963 after a petition against AISI.

While the logo still resembles the original [[Steelmark]] logo, the team has made subtle changes over the years in order to own a [[trademark]] on the logo, most notably making the three astroids thicker in shape and changing the orange astroid to red. The Steelmark logo itself has actually been heavily redesigned since then, using two variants, one of which uses a more modern design and uses three shades of blue for the astroids&lt;ref&gt;http://www.steel.org/AM/Template.cfm?Section=Home&lt;/ref&gt; while another one used concurrently has a strong resemblance to the [[recycling symbol]]. One alternate variation the team used in the 1980sâthough rarely used todayâcombined the logo with the team's signature stencil-script typeface, replacing the regular &quot;Steelers&quot; typeface used with the team's longtime script logo.

==Helmets==
The Steelers are the only NFL team that puts its logo on only one side of the helmet (the right side). Longtime field and equipment manager Jack Hart was instructed to do this by Art Rooney as a test to see how the logo appeared on the gold helmets; however, its popularity led the team to leave it that way permanently.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media3.steelers.com/tradition/logohistory/ Official site of the Pittsburgh Steelers - Logo History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, several [[college football]] teams such as [[Michigan State Spartans football|Michigan State]] have followed the Steelers approach at one point or another and had their logo on only one side of the helmet. A year after introducing the logo, they switched to black helmets to make it stand out more. In 1977, the Steelers switched facemask colors from gray to black.

Another feature of the helmet is that a player's number appears on both the front and back (the Steelers are one of only two teams in the NFL to do this, the other being the [[New York Giants]]). The numbers traditionally do not appear on the front of the helmet during the exhibition season, and also do not appear on the front of the throwback helmets.

==Uniforms==
===Early years===
The Steelers have made only a few changes to their jerseys over the years. Originally, the team had vertically-striped jerseys that resembled [[prison]] uniforms at the time, with some variations having the city of Pittsburgh crest on the front, a la [[National Hockey League|NHL]] uniforms. The team would later wear these uniforms as throwbacks in [[1994 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1994]].

The team adopted more standard NFL uniforms in [[1936 Pittsburgh Pirates (NFL) season|1936]] and added [[Northwestern striping]] to the sleeves, and with the team finishing 0.500 for the first time in team history that season (at 6&amp;ndash;6), the stripes have largely remained on the uniforms since.  The striping pattern is named for [[Northwestern University]], the college that is believed to have originated the pattern.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giants.com/news/eisen/story.asp?story_id=6361&lt;/ref&gt;

One exception that the stripes were omitted prior to the 1960s was from the aforementioned &quot;Steagles&quot; season because the team wore the Eagles uniforms as a cost-saving measure. The Eagles' jerseys at the time were green with white shoulders and no stripes. The Rooneys have acknowledged that because the combined team wore the Eagles uniforms that year, it is the only time in team history that the colors were something other than black &amp; gold.

===Two white jerseys===
Due to uniform experimentation in the 1960s, on two separate occasions the team's stripes were omitted. The first time came in [[1962 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1962]], when the Steelers began to wear two types of white jerseys, one of which featured a gold diamond on the sleeves in place of the stripes, with the &quot;TV numbers&quot; situated on the diamonds. These jerseys were primarily worn in home games when the team didn't wear their black jerseys, since the NFL at the time was encouraging teams to wear white jerseys so fans could see the team colors of their opponents.

The other jersey featured gold sleeves and a black version of the stripes, and were worn in road games when the home team elected to wear their colored jerseys. The team continued this way through the [[1965 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1965 season]].

===Caped Crusaders===
[[File:BatmanUniforms.jpg|thumb|right|The Steelers' &quot;[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]&quot;-style uniforms the team experimented with in 1966-1967.]]
Perhaps the most infamous uniforms the team has ever worn came in [[1966 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1966]], when the team experimented with the &quot;[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]&quot;-themed uniforms, named as such because they were similar to the Batman outfits [[Adam West]] wore on the popular TV series. The jersey had no stripes on either the black or white jerseys and had a gold triangle-like diamond covering the shoulders.

Although they have been commonly called the &quot;Batman&quot; uniforms, [[Dan Rooney]] later made public his reasoning behind the uniforms. With [[Art Rooney|his father]] still running the team and the [[Vince Lombardi]]-led [[Green Bay Packers]] being the class of the NFL, the younger Rooney (who still had a much smaller role with the team at the time) didn't want to follow the lead of other NFL teams trying to copy the Packers and wanted the Steelers to have a more unique look.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman1&quot;&gt;http://news.steelers.com/article/97476/&lt;/ref&gt; Coinciding with this was the development of the [[Downtown Pittsburgh|Golden Triangle]] in the city of Pittsburgh in the 1960s, so Rooney decided to give the uniforms a connection to the growing downtown district with the gold triangle-like diamond.

Although both Rooney and [[NFL Films|NFL Films's]] [[Steve Sabol]] liked the look (Sabol mentioned that you could easily tell when the Steelers played),&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman2&quot;&gt;http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/dailycourier/bridal/s_527501.html&lt;/ref&gt; the players didn't, adding that they looked like [[clown]]s or [[Batman]], which is likely where the &quot;Batman&quot; rumors began. Due to primitive washing techniques at the time (as well as NFL teams frequently reusing the uniforms, unlike today where current athletic supplier [[Reebok]] gives teams new equipment every game), the Steelers had trouble washing the uniforms because the gold triangle faded easily. Rooney was even asked on a radio show in Dallas when the team was playing the Cowboys on October 30, 1966 if the team was wearing the uniforms for [[Halloween]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman1&quot; /&gt;

The uniforms were retired after two seasons. The team has mentioned publicly as recently as 2007 that they will never wear them in a game again.&lt;ref name=&quot;Batman2&quot; /&gt; However, in 2008, the team began to sell customized versions of the jerseys on their official Web site.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.steelers.com/catalog/product/97384/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern classics===
After just two years with the &quot;Batman&quot; uniforms, the current uniform designs were introduced in [[1968 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1968]]. The design was a modernized version of the pre-1966 black design and consists of gold pants and either black jerseys or white jerseys, except for the 1970 and 1971 seasons when the Steelers wore white pants with their white jerseys. After a two-year hiatus, the Northwestern-style stripes returned for good, with the black jerseys getting white stripes in the two gaps of the gold stripes while the white jerseys got black outlines on the gold stripes. Both variations have been heavily used in team apparel. Although the stripes initially went all the way around the sleeves, since the [[2000 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2000 season]] they now stop in the middle of the jersey; this is due to football jerseys in general shortening the sleeves to reduce holding calls.

The helmet is solid black with a gold central stripe and small white player numbers on the forehead. Last names were added to the jerseys in [[1970 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1970]], as part of a new NFL mandate resulting from the [[AFL-NFL merger]] (the AFL teams had last names on the back of their jerseys). In [[1997 Pittsburgh Steelers season|1997]], the team switched to rounded numbers on the jersey to match the number font ([[Futura (typeface)#Futura Condensed|Futura Condensed]]) on the helmets, and a Steelers logo was added to the left side of the jersey.

The Steelers are often praised and recognized with their uniforms due to their traditional style while other teams such as the [[Arizona Cardinals]], [[Atlanta Falcons]], [[Denver Broncos]] and [[Minnesota Vikings]] have introduced more radical uniforms in recent years. When [[Reebok]] signed a contract to become the exclusive uniform supplier to the NFL in 2000 (replacing [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]], whom the Steelers had from 1997-2001, and had [[Starter Clothing Line|Starter]] before Nike) Reebok had announced that all NFL teams would be changing their uniforms for the [[2002 NFL season]], when Reebok's contract took effect. Dan Rooney, one of the league's most influential owners, stated several times in public that the Steelers would NOT be changing their uniforms despite Reebok stating otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.post-gazette.com/steelers/20001225stllog7.asp | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | first1=Ed | last1=Bouchette | first2=Gerry | last2=Dulac | title=Steelers Report: 12/25/00 | date=December 25, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Reebook rescinded its proposal due to several owners protesting after taking Rooney's lead. (The [[Buffalo Bills]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]] redesigned their uniforms for 2002 anyways.) Aside from introducing their throwbacks in [[2007 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2007]], the Steelers have not made any changes to their uniforms since Reebook took over as the league's supplier.

In 1979, the team gave the [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten's]] [[Iowa Hawkeyes football|Iowa Hawkeyes]] permission to use the Steelers uniform designs, since both teams had the same color scheme. Aside from Iowa using its Tigerhawk logo as well as continuing to use the block numbers that the Steelers themselves replaced with the rounder numbers in 1997, the two uniform sets remain identical today.

===Black at home===
The Steelers are one of a dwindling number of NFL franchises that strictly wears its team color jerseys at home, always opting for black. They are the only ones in the [[AFC North]] to practice this. The [[Cleveland Browns]] have traditionally had on again/off again periods of wearing white at home, while the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]], like some other NFL teams, wear white in their home opener before wearing their darker jerseys in their remaining home games. The Steelers last wore white at home on a regular basis in 1969, Chuck Noll's first season as coach and the last year the team played in [[Pitt Stadium]].

Because of the team's unofficial policy of always wearing their black jerseys in home games, the team gained some notoriety when, as the designated &quot;home&quot; team for [[Super Bowl XL]], the team elected to wear their white jerseys, becoming just the third NFL team to elect to wear white as the &quot;home&quot; team in the [[Super Bowl]]. But while the other two teams that have elected to wear white as the &quot;home&quot; team in the Super Bowl ([[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]] in [[Super Bowl XIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXVII]], and [[Washington Redskins|Washington]] in [[Super Bowl XVII]]) traditionally wear white at home, a variety of reasons were rumored as to why the Steelers elected to wear white in Super Bowl XL. Reasons included the fact that the team wore white in all three playoff victories that year (all on the road) to former head coach [[Bill Cowher]]'s comments that since it wasn't at [[Heinz Field]], it was a road game (a statement contradicted by the fact that ten years earlier in [[Super Bowl XXX]], Cowher's squad was the &quot;home team&quot; and chose to wear their black jerseys away from [[Three Rivers Stadium]], where they had played both playoff games). However, it should be noted though that the game took place in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]], which is only a five hour drive from Pittsburgh and with the league preferring to have the Super Bowl in [[subtropical climate|subtropical]] or [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] climates or in domed/retractable roof stadiums due to the winter weather, is likely the closest the Steelers would have to a home game in a Super Bowl in the foreseeable future. (Not surprisingly, there were also an overwhelming number of Steelers fans at the game compared to the number of supporters of their opponent, the [[Seattle Seahawks]]. One ESPN.com columnist suggested that Steelers fans outnumbered Seahawks fans by a ratio of 25 to 1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/recap?gameId=260205023 ESPN - Steelers get past Seahawks for fifth Super Bowl win in club history - NFL Football Recap]&lt;/ref&gt;) Having been the Cowboys' opponent in XIII, the Steelers are the only team to have worn both white jerseys for a &quot;home&quot; Super Bowl and colored jerseys for an &quot;away&quot; one.

===Throwback uniforms===
[[File:Hines Ward throwback 2007.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Hines Ward]] wearing the Steelers 75th anniversary uniform in 2007]]
At a press conference on April 27, 2007, it was announced that the Steelers would wear a [[throwback uniform]] for two home games during the 2007 season, as part of the celebration of the Steelers' 75th Season. They were worn for the Steelers' home opener against the Buffalo Bills on September 16 and again during the Monday Night Football game on November 5 against the Baltimore Ravens. Both games resulted in victories. The jersey is black with the numbers, names and stripes all in gold and it also contains a 75th Season logo on the right side of the upper chest part of the jersey. The jersey is considered to be from the 1960 season. The pants are white with a single gold stripe running down the length of the outside of each leg, surrounded by thinner black stripes on either side of the gold stripe. The helmets are gold with the Steelers logo on the right side and a single black stripe running down the center from front to back. The helmet was worn during the 1962 season, which was the first year that the present Steelers logo began to appear on their helmets. The only two differences are that the logo on the original helmet read 'Steel', whereas Steelers appears on the helmet that the team wore for the two games in 2007 and that the face mask on this version of the helmet is black, whereas the original face mask color on the gold helmet was gray. The throwbacks, minus the &quot;75th season&quot; patch, are now officially the team's [[third jersey|alternate uniform]] as of the [[2008 Pittsburgh Steelers season|2008 season]],&lt;ref&gt;http://news.steelers.com/catalog/product/91379/&lt;/ref&gt; and are usually worn for games that honor the team's [[alumni]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.steelers.com/article/96928/ A fun weekend for Steelers alumni]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since their introduction in 2007, the Steelers have worn the throwbacks the NFL maximum of twice per year, with the team's annual home matchup against the [[SteelersâRavens rivalry|rival]] [[Baltimore Ravens]] receiving one of the allotments each year. The other matchups have included the [[Buffalo Bills]] in 2007, the [[New York Giants]] in 2008 (the first loss in the throwbacks to date), and the [[San Diego Chargers]] in 2009 ([[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday night]] contest).

2010 will see the team sporting the throwback uniforms at the October 17 game against the Cleveland Browns, and for the November 14, Sunday Night Football game against the New England Patriots.

The throwback gold helmets have often been worn in practice in addition to the regular black helmets, a highly unusual move among NFL teams whose throwbacks use a different helmet than their current design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/10162/1064858-87.stm|title=Cook: Steelers' Roethlisberger takes step in reformation|author=Ron Cook|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
