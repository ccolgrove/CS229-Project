'''Daniel George Niculae''' (born 6 October 1982 in [[BucureÅti]], [[Romania]]) is a [[football (soccer)|football]] [[striker]] who currently plays for [[AS Nancy|Nancy]]. He is usually holder at the [[Romanian national team]].

==Club career==
===Rapid BucureÅti===
Daniel &quot;Nico&quot; Niculae started his professional career at [[FC Rapid BucureÅti|Rapid BucureÅti]] in 2000. Despite a period playing for the B team in 2001, Nico proved he is one of most gifted players of the club, and helped his club to win the championship in the 2002â03 season â his first as a first-team regular.

Niculae was Rapid's leading scorer in the 2003â04 season, with 14 goals â the third highest total in Romania's [[Liga 1]].

In the [[2005â06 UEFA Cup|2005â06]] [[UEFA Cup]] campaign, he and [[Mugurel Buga]] formed one of the most powerful striker pairs of the competition, with Niculae scoring 8 goals, as Rapid reached the Quarter-Finals of the competition. The season also saw Rapid claim the 2006 [[Cupa RomÃ¢niei|Romanian Cup]], with Niculae scoring the winning goal in the first minute of extra-time, against [[FC Progresul BucureÅti|NaÅ£ional BucureÅti]].

===Auxerre===
Niculae was transferred to French club [[AJ Auxerre]] in the summer of 2006, for 3.3 million Euros. His first season with the club saw him score 4 goals in the UEFA Cup, but he struggled for goals in [[Ligue 1]]. However, the following season his form improved, as he scored 11 goals to help keep the club in Ligue 1.

The [[2008â09 Ligue 1|2008â09]] season was one to forget for Niculae. He was deeply affected by the loss of his father, and despite threatening to score on several occasions, he failed to find the net in 32 games.

Things got back on track in [[2009â10 Ligue 1|2009â10]] however. [[Jean Fernandez]] initially wanted to loan out Niculae for the season, but the latest signing [[Alexandre Licata]] was ruled out for most of the season with a serious ankle injury. Daniel Niculae found a new role in the Auxerre side, as a creater of goals rather than a scorer of them. As of April 2010, he lies third in the table for assists in Ligue 1 with a total of 8. He has a brilliant entente with Polish goalscorer [[Ireneusz JeleÅ]] and has helped the Burgundian side to reach second in the table and to thus push for the Champions League places.

===Monaco===
After the expiring of his contract with [[AJ Auxerre]] on 15 June 2010, Niculae signed a three-year-deal with [[Ligue 1]] rivals [[AS Monaco FC|AS Monaco]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asm-fc.com/article.aspx?id=11776 Daniel Niculae sâengage avec lâAS Monaco FC]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nancy (loan)===
On 31 August 2011, Niculae signed for French side [[AS Nancy]] on a season long loan.

==International career==
Niculae won his first international cap for [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in 2003, but did not become a regular squad member until the 2005â06 season.

He was selected for Romania's [[Euro 2008]] squad, and started his country's first two matches. He came on as a substitute for their final group game against the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]], but could not help Romania to a win, which would have taken the country into the Quarter-Finals.

Other than the fact that they share birthplace, he has no connection with namesake and fellow international [[Marius Niculae]].
