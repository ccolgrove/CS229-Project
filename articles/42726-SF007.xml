A '''cephalopod''' is any member of the [[mollusca|mollusc]]an [[Taxonomic rank|class]] '''Cephalopoda''' ([[Greek language|Greek]] plural ''{{Polytonic|ÎÎµÏÎ±Î»ÏÏÎ¿Î´Î±}}'' (kephalÃ³poda); &quot;head-feet&quot;). These exclusively marine animals are characterized by [[bilateral symmetry|bilateral body symmetry]], a prominent head, and a set of [[cephalopod arm|arm]]s or [[tentacle]]s ([[muscular hydrostat]]s) modified from the primitive molluscan foot.  Fishermen sometimes call them '''inkfish''', referring to their common ability to squirt [[Cephalopod ink|ink]]. The study of cephalopods is a branch of [[malacology]] known as '''teuthology'''.

Cephalopods became dominant during the [[Ordovician]] period, represented by primitive [[Nautiloidea|nautiloids]]. The class now contains two, only distantly related, [[Extant taxon|extant]] subclasses: [[Coleoidea]], which includes [[octopus]]es, [[squid]], and [[cuttlefish]]; and [[Nautiloidea]], represented by ''[[Nautilus]]'' and ''[[Allonautilus]]''. In the Coleoidea, the molluscan shell has been internalized or is absent, whereas in the Nautiloidea, the external shell remains. About 800 living [[species]] of cephalopods have been identified. Two important extinct [[taxon|taxa]] are the [[Ammonoidea]] (ammonites) and [[Belemnoidea]] (belemnites).

There are around 800 {{wict|extant}} species of cephalopod,&lt;ref&gt;[updated 13-Jun-2003] [cit. 27-Feb-2005] http://www.cephbase.utmb.edu/spdb/allsp.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; although new species continue to be described. An estimated 11,000 extinct [[taxon|taxa]] have been described, although the soft-bodied nature of cephalopods means they are not easily fossilised.&lt;ref name=mollusca12&gt;{{mollusca|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods are found in all the oceans of Earth. None of them can tolerate [[freshwater]], but the brief squid, ''[[Lolliguncula brevis]]'', found in [[Chesapeake Bay]], may be a notable exception in that it tolerates [[brackish water]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Bartol I.K., Mann R., Vecchione M. | year = 2002 | title = Distribution of the euryhaline squid ''Lolliguncula brevis'' in Chesapeake Bay: effects of selected abiotic factors | url = | journal = Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. | volume = 226 | issue = | pages = 235â247 | doi = 10.3354/meps226235 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods occupy most of the depth of the ocean, from the [[abyssal plane]] to the sea surface.  Their diversity is greatest near the equator (~40 species retrieved in nets at 11Â°N by a diversity study) and decreases towards the poles (~5 species captured at 60Â°N).&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;

Cephalopods are widely regarded as the most intelligent of the [[invertebrate]]s, and have well developed senses and large [[brain]]s (larger than those of [[gastropod]]s). The [[nervous system]] of cephalopods is the most complex of the invertebrates&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url = http://books.google.com/?id=dW5e6FHOH-4C&amp;lpg=PA115&amp;pg=PA115#v=onepage&amp;f=false | title = The nervous systems of invertebrates: An evolutionary and comparative approach | isbn = 9783764350765 | author1 = Kutsch | first1 = Wolfram | year = 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and their brain-to-body-mass ratio falls between that of warm- and cold-blooded vertebrates.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;{{Rp|14}} The brain is protected in a [[cartilage|cartilaginous]] cranium. The giant [[nerve]] fibers of the cephalopod [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] have been widely used as experimental material in [[neurophysiology]] for many years; their large diameter (due to lack of [[myelination]]) makes them relatively easy to study.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/50/4/619.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods are social creatures; when isolated from their own kind, they will take to [[Shoaling and schooling|shoaling]] with fish.&lt;ref name=Packard1972&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1469-185X.1972.tb00975.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cephalopods are able to fly through air for distances up to 50&amp;nbsp;m. While the organisms are not particularly aerodynamic, they achieve these rather impressive ranges by use of jet-propulsion; water continues to be expelled from the funnel while the organism is in flight.&lt;ref&gt;http://mollus.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/70/3/297&lt;/ref&gt;

==Senses==

Cephalopods have advanced vision, can detect gravity with [[statocyst]]s, and have a variety of chemical sense organs.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;{{Rp|34}} Octopuses use their tentacles to explore their environment and can use them for depth perception.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;

[[File:Nautilus pompilius (head).jpg|thumb|left|The primitive [[nautilus]] eye functions similarly to a [[pinhole camera]].]]

===Vision===
{{Main|Cephalopod eye|mollusc eye}}
Most cephalopods rely on vision to detect predators and prey, and to communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=Serb2008&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/s12052-008-0084-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, cephalopod vision is acute: training experiments have shown that the [[common octopus]] can distinguish the brightness, size, shape, and horizontal or vertical orientation of objects. The morphological construction gives cephalopod eyes the same performance as sharks'; however, their construction differs, as cephalopods lack a cornea, and have an everted retina.&lt;ref name=Serb2008/&gt; Cephalopods' eyes are also sensitive to the plane of [[Polarization (waves)|polarization]] of light. Surprisinglyâgiven their ability to change colorâall octopuses&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; and most cephalopods&lt;ref name=&quot;Messenger-17&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Messenger | first = John B. | coauthors = Roger T. Hanlon | title = Cephalopod Behaviour | publisher = Cambridge University Press | year = 1998 | location = Cambridge | pages = 17â21 | isbn = 0-521-64583-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; are [[color blind]].  When camouflaging themselves, they use their chromatophores to change brightness and pattern according to the background they see, but their ability to match the specific color of a background may come from cells such as [[iridophore]]s and [[leucophore]]s that reflect light from the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Hanlon and Messenger, 68.&lt;/ref&gt;  They also produce visual pigments throughout their body, and may sense light levels directly from their body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1098/rsbl.2010.0223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of [[color vision]] has been found in the [[Sparkling Enope Squid|sparkling enope squid]] (''Watasenia scintillans''),&lt;ref name=&quot;Messenger-17&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=Michinomae1994&gt;{{Cite pmid|9317205}}&lt;/ref&gt; which achieves color vision by the use of three distinct [[retinal]] molecules (A1, sensitive to red; A2, to purple, and A4, to yellow?) which bind to its [[opsin]].&lt;ref name=Seidou1990&gt;{{Cite doi|10.1007/BF00187321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike many other cephalopods, [[nautilus]]es do not have good vision; their eye structure is highly developed, but lacks a solid [[lens (anatomy)|lens]]. They have a simple &quot;[[Pinhole camera|pinhole]]&quot; eye through which water can pass. Instead of vision, the animal is thought to use [[olfaction]] as the primary sense for [[foraging]], as well as locating or identifying potential mates.

===Hearing===

Cephalopods can use their [[statocyst]]s to detect sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/earth/hi/earth_news/newsid_8095000/8095977.stm | work=BBC News | title=The cephalopods can hear you | date=2009-06-15 | accessdate=2010-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use of light==
[[Image:Cuttlefish color.jpg|thumb|This [[Broadclub Cuttlefish|broadclub cuttlefish]] (''Sepia latimanus'') can go from camouflage tans and browns (top) to yellow with dark highlights (bottom) in less than a second.]]
Most cephalopods possess [[chromatophore]]s - that is, coloured pigments - which they can use in a startling array of fashions.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt; As well as providing camouflage with their background, some cephalopods bioluminesce, shining light downwards to disguise their shadows from any predators that may lurk below.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;  The bioluminescence is produced by bacterial symbionts; the host cephalopod is able to detect the light produced by these organisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1073/pnas.0904571106 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bioluminescence]] may also be used to entice prey, and some species use colourful displays to impress mates, startle predators, or even communicate with one another.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;  It is not certain whether bioluminescence is actually of epithelial origin or if it is a bacterial production.&lt;ref name=encbrit/&gt;

=== Colouration ===
Colouration can be changed in milliseconds as they adapt to their environment,&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;  and the pigment cells are expandable by muscular contraction.&lt;ref name=encbrit&gt;&quot;integument (mollusks).&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2009. [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Colouration is typically more pronounced in near-shore species than those living in the open ocean, whose functions tend to be restricted to camouflage by breaking their outline.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;{{Rp|2}}

Evidence of original colouration has been detected in cephalopod fossils dating as far back as the [[Silurian]]; these orthoconic individuals bore concentric stripes, which are thought to have served as camouflage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url =http://www.app.pan.pl/article/item/app20080062.html|title=Minute Silurian oncocerid nautiloids with unusual colour patterns

Messenger: ''Cephalopod Behaviour,'' page 2. Cambridge University Press, 1999, ISBN 0521645832&lt;/ref&gt; all known cephalopods have an ink sac, which can be used to expel a cloud of dark ink to confuse [[predator]]s.&lt;ref name=Boyle&gt;{{cite book

 | title= Cephalopods : ecology and fisheries }}&lt;/ref&gt; This sac is a muscular bag which originated as an extension of the hind gut.  It lies beneath the gut and opens into the anus, into which its contents &amp;ndash; almost pure [[melanin]] &amp;ndash; can be squirted; its proximity to the base of the funnel means the ink can be distributed by ejected water as the cephalopod uses its jet propulsion.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt;  The ejected cloud of melanin is usually mixed, upon expulsion, with [[mucus]], produced elsewhere in the mantle, and therefore forms a thick cloud, resulting in visual (and possibly chemosensory) impairment of the predator, like a [[smokescreen]]. However, a more sophisticated behaviour has been observed, in which the cephalopod releases a cloud, with a greater mucus content, that approximately resembles the cephalopod that released it (this decoy is referred to as a [[Pseudomorph#Pseudomorph_in_other_fields|Pseudomorph]]). This strategy often results in the predator attacking the pseudomorph, rather than its rapidly departing prey.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; For more information, see [[Cephalopod_ink#Inking_behaviours|Inking behaviors]].

The inking behaviour of cephalopods has led to a common name of &quot;inkfish&quot;, primarily used in [[fisheries]] science and the [[fishing industry]], paralleling the terms [[Whitefish (fisheries term)|white fish]], [[oily fish]], and [[shellfish]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Circulatory system==
Cephalopods are the only mollusks with a closed circulatory system. [[Coleoid]]s have two gill [[heart]]s (also known as [[branchial heart]]s) that move blood through the capillaries of the [[gill]]s. A single systemic heart then pumps the oxygenated blood through the rest of the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Wells | first = M.J. | title = Nervous control of the heartbeat in octopus | journal = Journal of Experimental Biology | volume = 85 | issue = 1 | pages = 111â28 | date=1 April 1980| url = http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/content/abstract/85/1/111 | pmid=7373208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like most molluscs, cephalopods use [[hemocyanin]], a copper-containing protein, rather than [[hemoglobin]], to transport oxygen. As a result, their blood is colorless when deoxygenated and turns blue when exposed to air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ghiretti-Magaldi | first = A. | title = The Pre-history of Hemocyanin. The Discovery of Copper in the Blood of Molluscs | journal = Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences | volume = 48 | issue = 10 | pages = | publisher = BirkhÃ¤user Basel | month = October | year = 1992 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/content/ph8v3ln7560v68pp/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Respiration==
Cephalopods exchange gasses with the seawater by forcing water through their gills, which are attached to the roof of the organism.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990/&gt;{{Rp|488}}&lt;ref name=Schipp1979/&gt;  Water enters the mantle cavity on the outside of the gills, and the entrance of the mantle cavity closes.  When the mantle contracts, water is forced through the gills, which lie between the mantle cavity and the funnel.  The water's expulsion through the funnel can be used to power jet propulsion. The gills, which are much more efficient than those of other molluscs, are attached to the ventral surface of the mantle cavity.&lt;ref name=Schipp1979&gt;{{cite journal|	title=Electron Microscopical and Histochemical Studies of Differentiation and Function of the Cephalopod Gill (''Sepia officinalis'' L.)|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/m483628053742p34/fulltext.pdf|	year=1979|	unused_data=Zoomorphologie 93, 193-207}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is a trade-off with gill size regarding lifestyle.  To achieve fast speeds, gills need to be small - water will be passed through them quickly when energy is needed, compensating for their small size.  However, organisms which spend most of their time moving slowly along the bottom do not naturally pass much water through their cavity for locomotion; thus they have larger gills, along with complex systems to ensure that water is constantly washing through their gills, even when the organism is stationary.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990/&gt;  The water flow is controlled by contractions of the radial and circular mantle cavity muscles.&lt;ref name=Bone1994&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/cgi/reprint/194/1/153.pdf|year=1994|publisher=[[Journal of Experimental Biology]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gills of cephalopods are supported by a skeleton of robust fibrous proteins; the lack of mucopolysaccharides distinguishes this matrix from cartilage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cole2009&quot;&gt;{{cite pmid|18722759}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also http://tolweb.org/articles/?article_id=4200&lt;/ref&gt; The gills are also thought to be involved in excretion, with NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; being swapped with K&lt;Sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from the seawater.&lt;ref name=Schipp1979/&gt;

== Locomotion and buoyancy ==
[[Image:Octopus3.jpg|thumb|right|Octopuses swim headfirst, with arms trailing behind]]
While all cephalopods can move by [[jet (gas)|jet]] propulsion, this is a very energy-consuming way to travel compared to the tail propulsion used by fish.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;/&gt; The efficiency of a propellor-driven waterjet (i.e. Froude efficiency) is a more efficient model than rocket efficiency.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid10952883&quot;&gt;{{Cite pmid | 10952883}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relative efficiency of jet propulsion decreases further as animal size increases; paralarvae are far more efficient than juvenile and adult individuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartol2008&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1093/icb/icn043}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the Paleozoic era, as competition with fish produced an environment where efficient motion was crucial to survival, jet propulsion has taken a back role, with fins and tentacles used to maintain a steady velocity.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12&quot; /&gt;
Whilst jet propulsion is never the sole mode of locomotion,&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12&quot;/&gt;{{rp|208}} the stop-start motion provided by the jets continues to be useful for providing bursts of high speed - not least when capturing prey or avoiding predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12&quot;/&gt; Indeed, it makes cephalopods the fastest marine invertebrates,&lt;ref name=Cephalopods&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0-19-852761-6|author=Marion Nixon |author2= J.Z. Young|year=2003|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|title=The brains and lives of cephalopods}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|Preface}}
and they can out-accelerate most fish.&lt;ref name=Gilbert1990&gt;{{cite book|title=Squid as Experimental Animals|author=Daniel L. Gilbert|first2=William J. |last2=Adelman|author3=John M. Arnold

The jet is supplemented with fin motion; in the squid, the fins flap each time that a jet is released, amplifying the thrust; they are then extended between jets (presumably to avoid sinking).&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartol2008&quot;/&gt;
Oxygenated water is taken into the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle cavity]] to the [[gill]]s and through muscular contraction of this cavity, the spent water is expelled through the [[hyponome]], created by a fold in the mantle.  The size difference between the posterior and anterior ends of this organ control the speed of the jet the organism can produce.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shea2002&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/s00227-001-0772-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The velocity of the organism can be accurately predicted for a given mass and morhpology of animal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Study in Jet Propulsion: An Analysis of the Motion of the Squid, ''Loligo Vulgaris'' | journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=56|pages=155â165|issue=1972|author=W. JOHNSON |author2=P. D. SODEN |author3=E. R. TRUEMAN }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Motion of the cephalopods is usually backward as water is forced out anteriorly through the hyponome, but direction can be controlled somewhat by pointing it in different directions.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, Reece, &amp; Mitchell, p.612&lt;/ref&gt;   Some cephalopods accompany this expulsion of water with a gunshot-like popping noise, thought to function to frighten away potential predators.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guerra2007&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1017/S0025315407058225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods employ a similar method of propulsion despite their increasing size (as they grow) changing the dynamics of the water in which they find themselves.  Thus their paralarvae do not extensively use their fins (which are less efficient at low [[Reynolds number]]s) and primarily use their jets to propel themselves upwards, whereas large adult cephalopods tend to swim less efficiently and with more reliance on their fins.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bartol2008&quot;/&gt;

[[Image:Nautilus front.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Nautilus belauensis]]'' seen from the front, showing the opening of the hyponome]]

Early cephalopods are thought to have produced jets by drawing their body into their shells, as ''Nautilus'' does today.&lt;ref name=Wells1991&gt;{{cite journal

Some octopus species are also able to walk along the sea bed. Squids and cuttlefish can move short distances in any direction by rippling of a flap of [[muscle]] around the mantle.

While most cephalopods float (i.e. are [[neutral buoyancy|neutrally buoyant]] or nearly so; in fact most cephalopods are about 2-3% denser than seawater&lt;ref name=Packard1972/&gt;), they achieve this in different ways.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;&gt;{{mollusca|chapter=11: Evolution of Buoyancy and Locomotion in recent cephalopods|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some, such as ''[[Nautilus]]'', allow gas to diffuse into the gap between the mantle and the shell; others allow purer water to ooze from their kidneys, forcing out denser salt water from the body cavity;&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;/&gt; others, like some fish, accumulate oils in the liver;&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;/&gt; and some octopuses have a gelatinous body with lighter [[chlorine]] [[ion]]s replacing [[sulfate]] in the body chemistry.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca12-11&quot;/&gt;

[[Nautilus]]es are the only extant cephalopods with an external shell. However, all molluscan shells are formed from the ectoderm (outer layer of the embryo); in [[cuttlefish]] (''Sepia'' spp.), for example, an invagination of the ectoderm forms during the embryonic period, resulting in a shell that is internal in the adult.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baratte2007&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/s00427-007-0147-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same is true of the chitinous gladius of squid&lt;ref name=&quot;Baratte2007&quot;/&gt; and octopus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.geobios.2003.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cirrina|Cirrate]] [[octopus]]es have cartilaginous fin supports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Females of the octopus genus ''[[Argonauta]]'' secrete a specialised paper-thin eggcase in which they reside, and this is popularly regarded as a &quot;shell&quot;, although it is not attached to the body of the animal.

The largest group of shelled cephalopods, the [[ammonite]]s, are extinct, but their shells are very common as [[fossil]]s.

The deposition of carbonate, leading to a mineralized shell, appears to be related to the acidity of the organic shell matrix (see [[Mollusc shell]]); shell-forming cephalopods have an acidic matrix, whereas the gladius of squid has a basic matrix.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1007/BF00353265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Head appendages==
{{Main|Cephalopod arm|tentacle}}
Cephalopods, as the name implies, have muscular appendages extending from their heads and surrounding their mouths. These are used in feeding, mobility, and even reproduction. In [[Coleoidea|coleoids]] they number eight or ten. Decapods such as cuttlefish and squid have five pairs. The longer two, termed ''[[tentacle]]s'', are actively involved in capturing prey;&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot; /&gt;{{Rp|225}} they can lengthen rapidly (in as little as 15 milliseconds&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|225}}). In [[giant squid]] they may reach a length of 8 metres. They may terminate in a broadened, sucker-coated club.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|225}} The shorter four pairs are termed ''[[cephalopod arm|arms]]'', and are involved in holding and manipulating the captured organism.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|225}} They too have suckers, on the side closest to the mouth; these help to hold onto the prey.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|226}} Octopods only have four pairs of sucker-coated arms, as the name suggests.

The tentacle consists of a thick central nerve cord (which must be thick to allow each sucker to be controlled independently)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 1912 | title=Anatomy of the Common Squid}}&lt;/ref&gt; surrounded by circular and radial muscles. Because the volume of the tentacle remains constant, contracting the circular muscles decreases the radius and permits the rapid increase in length.  Typically a 70% lengthening is achieved by decreasing the width by 23%.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|227}} The shorter arms lack this capability. 

The size of the tentacle is related to the size of the buccal cavity; larger, stronger tentacles can hold prey as small bites are taken from it; with more numerous, smaller tentacles, prey is swallowed whole, so the mouth cavity must be larger.&lt;ref&gt;Nixon 1988 in {{cite doi|10.1111/j.0031-0239.2004.00408.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Externally shelled [[Nautilidae|nautilids]] (''[[Nautilus]]'' and ''[[Allonautilus]]'') have on the order of 90 finger-like appendages, termed ''tentacles'', which lack suckers but are sticky instead, and are partly retractable.

==Feeding==
[[File:Architeuthis beak.jpg|thumb|The two-part beak of the [[giant squid]], ''Architeuthis'' sp.]]
All living cephalopods have a two-part beak;&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;{{Rp|7}} most have a [[radula]], although it is reduced in most octopus and absent altogether in ''Spirula''.&lt;ref name=Cephalopods/&gt;{{Rp|7}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Mollusca|volume=12|chapter=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|110}} They feed by capturing prey with their tentacles, drawing it in to their mouth and taking bites from it.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt;  They have a mixture of toxic digestive juices, some of which are manufactured by symbiotic algae, which they eject from their salivary glands onto their captured prey held in their mouth. These juices separate the flesh of their prey from the bone or shell.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; The salivary gland has a small tooth at its end which can be poked into an organism to digest it from within.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt;

The digestive gland itself is rather short.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; It has four elements, with food passing through the crop, stomach and caecum before entering the intestine. Most digestion, as well as the absorption of nutrients, occurs in the digestive gland, sometimes called the liver.  Nutrients and waste materials are exchanged between the gut and the digestive gland through a pair of connections linking the gland to the junction of the stomach and caecum.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; Cells in the digestive gland directly release pigmented excretory chemicals into the lumen of the gut, which are then bound with mucus passed through the anus as long dark strings, ejected with the aid of exhaled water from the funnel.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; Cephalopods tend to concentrate ingested heavy metals in their body tissue.&lt;ref&gt;C.Michael Hogan. 2011.

=== Radula ===
{{See also|Radula#In cephalopods}}
[[File:Veined Octopus - Amphioctopus Marginatus eating a Crab.jpg|thumb|''[[Amphioctopus marginatus]]'' eating a crab]]
The cephalopod radula consists of multiple symmetrical rows of up to nine teeth&lt;ref&gt;{{tolweb|2035|title=Cephalopod radula|author=Richard E. Young, Michael Vecchione, and Katharina M. Mangold}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;ndash; thirteen in fossil classes.&lt;ref name=Nixon1995&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1469-7998.1995.tb01785.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The organ is reduced or even vestigial in certain octopus species and is absent in ''[[Spirula]]''.&lt;ref name=Nixon1995/&gt;  The teeth may be homodont (i.e. similar in form across a row), heterodont (otherwise), or ctenodont (comb-like).&lt;ref name=Nixon1995/&gt;  Their height, width and number of cusps is variable between species.&lt;ref name=Nixon1995/&gt;  The pattern of teeth repeats, but each row may not be identical to the last; in the octopus, for instance, the sequence repeats every five rows.&lt;ref name=Nixon1995/&gt;{{rp|79}}

Cephalopod radulae are known from fossil deposits dating back to the Ordovician.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabbott1999&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/1475-4983.00065}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually preserved within the cephalopod's body chamber, commonly in conjunction with the mandibles; but this need not always be the case;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Radulae are usually difficult to detect, even when they are preserved in fossils, as the rock must weather and crack in exactly the right fashion to expose them; for instance, radulae have only been found in nine of the 43 ammonite genera,&lt;ref name=&quot;Kruta2011&quot;&gt;{{cite doi|10.1126/science.1198793}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=March 2011}} and they are rarer still in non-ammonoid forms: only three pre-Mesozoic species possess one.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gabbott1999&quot; /&gt;

===Excretory system===
Most cephalopods possess a single pair of large [[nephridium|nephridia]]. Filtered nitrogenous waste is produced in the [[pericardium|pericardial]] cavity of the [[branchial heart]]s, each of which is connected to a nephridium by a narrow canal. The canal delivers the excreta to a bladder-like renal sac, and also resorbs excess water from the filtrate. Several outgrowths of the lateral [[vena cava]] project into the renal sac, continuously inflating and deflating as the branchial hearts beat. This action helps to pump the secreted waste into the sacs, to be released into the mantle cavity through a pore.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 450â451|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nautilus'', unusually, possesses four nephridia, none of which are connected to the pericardial cavities.

== Ammonium ==
The handling of [[ammonia]] is thought to be important in shell formation in terrestrial molluscs, and in other nonmolluscan lineages.&lt;ref name=Loest1979&gt;{{cite jstor|30155937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because [[protein]] (i.e. flesh) is a major constituent of the cephalopod diet, large amounts of [[ammonium]] are produced as waste.  The main organs involved with the release of this excess ammonium are the gills.&lt;ref name=Boucher-Rodoni1994&gt;{{cite doi|10.1080/10236249409378907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rate of this release is the lowest in the shelled cephalopods ''[[Nautilus]]'' and ''[[Sepia (genus)|Sepia]]'', probably as a result of their use of [[nitrogen]] to fill their shells with gas to produce buoyancy.&lt;ref name=Boucher-Rodoni1994/&gt;  Other cephalopods use ammonium in a similar way, storing the [[ion]]s (as [[ammonium chloride]]) themselves to reduce their overall density and thus become more buoyant.&lt;ref name=Boucher-Rodoni1994/&gt;

}}
With a few exceptions, Coleoidea live short lives with rapid growth. Most of the energy extracted from their food is used for growing. The penis in most male Coleoidea is a long and muscular end of the [[gonoduct]] used to transfer spermatophores to a modified arm called a [[hectocotylus]]. That, in turn, is used to transfer the spermatophores to the female. In species where the hectocotylus is missing, the penis is long and able to extend beyond the mantle cavity and transfers the spermatophores directly to the female. Deep water squid have the greatest known penis length relative to body size of all mobile animals, second in the entire animal kingdom only to certain sessile [[barnacle]]s.&lt;ref name=penis&gt;Arkhipkin, A.I. &amp; V.V.

Most cephalopods tend towards a [[semelparous]] reproduction strategy; they lay many small eggs in one batch and die afterwards. The Nautiloidea, on the other hand, stick to [[iteroparity]]; they produce a few large eggs in each batch and live for a long time.{{cn|date=November 2011}}

External sexual characteristics are lacking in cephalopods, so cephalopods use colour communication. A courting male will approach a likely looking opposite number flashing his brightest colours, often in rippling displays. If the other cephalopod is female and receptive, her skin will change colour to become pale, and mating will occur. If the other cephalopod remains brightly coloured, it is taken as a warning.&lt;ref name=Branch1981/&gt;

The male has a sperm-carrying arm, known as the hectocotylous arm, with which to impregnate the female. In many cephalopods, mating occurs head to head and the male may simply transfer sperm to the female. Others may detach the sperm-carrying arm and leave it attached to the female. In the [[paper nautilus]], this arm remains active and wriggling for some time, prompting the zoologists who discovered it to conclude it was some sort of worm-like parasite. It was duly given a genus name ''Hectocotylus'', which held for some time until the mistake was discovered.&lt;ref name=Branch1981&gt;{{cite book|author=Branch George, Branch, Margo and Bannister, Anthony |year=(1981) |title=''The Living Shores of Southern Africa''|isbn=0869771159|publisher=C. Struik|location=Cape Town}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|227}}

[[Nidamental gland]]s are involved in the secretion of egg cases or the gelatinous substance comprising egg masses.&lt;ref name=TOL&gt;Young, R.E., M. Vecchione &amp; K.M. Mangold 1999. [http://tolweb.org/accessory/Cephalopoda_Glossary?acc_id=587 Cephalopoda Glossary].

Often, though, the eggs are left to their own devices; many squid lay sausage-like bunches of eggs in crevices or occasionally on the sea floor. [[Cuttlefish]] lay their eggs separately in cases and attach them to coral or algal fronds.&lt;ref name=Mapes2009&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1502-3931.2008.00141.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Fossilised egg clutches show that ammonites also laid clutches of eggs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1502-3931.2008.00133.x}} - this reference also contains a good summary of the process of egg development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cephalopods are occasionally long-lived, especially in the deep water or polar forms, but most of the group live fast and die young, maturing rapidly to their adult size. Some may gain as much as 12% of their body mass each day.&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; Most live for one to two years,&lt;ref name=Boyle/&gt; reproducing and then dying shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=Norman&gt;Norman, M.D. (2000). ''Cephalopods: A World Guide''. ConchBooks.&lt;/ref&gt;

To free up resources for reproduction, many squid are known to resorb the muscle tissue of their mantle and tentacles, breaking down the tissue and using the energy contained therein to produce more gametes.&lt;ref name=Kear1995&gt;{{Cite journal

==Embryology==
Unlike most other molluscs, cephalopods do not have a distinct [[larva]]l stage. The fertilised [[ovum]] initially divides to produce a disc of germinal cells at one pole, with the [[yolk]] remaining at the opposite pole. The germinal disc grows to envelop and eventually absorb the yolk, forming the embryo. The tentacles and arms first appear at the hind part of the body, where the foot would be in other molluscs, and only later migrate towards the head.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 459â460|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shigeno2008&gt;{{cite doi|10.1002/jmor.10564}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The funnel of cephalopods develops on the top of their head, whereas the mouth develops on the opposite surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=0306435136|author= Daniel L. Gilbert; William J. Adelman; John M. Arnold|year=1990|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|title=Squid as experimental animals}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|86}} The early embryological stages are reminiscent of ancestral [[gastropod]]s and extant [[Monoplacophora]].&lt;ref name=Shigeno2008/&gt;

The shells develop from the ectoderm as an organic framework which is subsequently mineralised.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baratte2007&quot;/&gt;  In ''Sepia'', which has an internal shell, the ectoderm forms an invagination whose pore is sealed off before this organic framework is deposited.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baratte2007&quot;/&gt;

The gene ''[[engrailed (gene)|engrailed]]'' is expressed first in the arms, funnel and optic vesicles, and is only later present in the tentacles and eyelids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baratte2007&quot;/&gt;  It is expressed in embryonic stages 17â19 in all arm buds, and subsequently in the future-tentacles in stages 24â5, suggesting that it may serve a role in the differential development of tentacles.  Sequential expression of Hox genes is also observed in cephalopod arms.&lt;ref name=&quot;Baratte2007&quot;/&gt;

Larger eggs in colder waters can develop for over a year before hatching.&lt;ref name=Boletzky2009/&gt;

The process from spawning to hatching follows a similar trajectory in all species, the main variable being the amount of yolk available to the young and when it is absorbed by the embryo.&lt;ref name=Boletzky2009/&gt;

Young do not pass through a larval stage, strictly speaking.  They quickly learn how to hunt, using encounters with prey to refine their strategies.&lt;ref name=Boletzky2009/&gt;

The development of a [[siphuncle]] would have allowed the shells of these early forms to become gas-filled (thus buoyant) in order to support them and keep the shells upright while the animal crawled along the floor, and separated the true cephalopods from putative ancestors such as ''[[Knightoconus]]'', which lacked a siphuncle.&lt;ref name=Boyle3/&gt; Neutral or positive buoyancy (i.e. the ability to float) would have come later, followed by swimming in the [[Plectronocerida]] and eventually jet propulsion in more derived cephalopods.&lt;ref name=Kroger2007&gt;{{Cite doi | 10.1111/j.1475-4983.2007.00644.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some morphological evidence is difficult to reconcile with this view, and the redescription of ''[[Nectocaris|Nectocaris pteryx]]'', which did not have a shell and appeared to possess jet propulsion in the manner of &quot;derived&quot; cephalopods, complicated the question of the order in which cephalopod features developed &amp;ndash; provided ''Nectocaris'' is a cephalopod at all.&lt;ref name=SmithAndCaron2010&gt;{{Cite journal

In the Early Palaeozoic, their range was far more restricted than today; they were mainly constrained to sublittoral regions of shallow shelves of the low latitudes, and usually occur in association with [[thrombolites]].&lt;ref name='Kroger2009b'&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1371/journal.pone.0007262 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A more pelagic habit was gradually adopted as the Ordovician progressed.&lt;ref name='Kroger2009b'/&gt;  Deep-water cephalopods, whilst rare, have been found in the Lower Ordovician - but only in high-latitude waters.&lt;ref name='Kroger2009b'/&gt;
The mid Ordovician saw the first cephalopods with septa strong enough to cope with the pressures associated with deeper water, and could inhabit depths greater than 100&amp;ndash;200&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name=Kroger2009/&gt;  The direction of shell coiling would prove to be crucial to the future success of the lineages; endogastric coiling would only permit large size to be attained with a straight shell, whereas exogastric coiling - initially rather rare - permitted the spirals familiar from the fossil record to develop, with their corresponding large size and diversity.&lt;ref name=Holland1986&gt;{{cite doi|10.1144/gsjgs.144.1.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Endogastric mean the shell is curved so as the ventral or lower side is longitudinally concave (belly in); exogastric means the shell is curved so as the ventral side is longitudinally convex (belly out) allowing the funnel to be pointed backwards beneath the shell.)&lt;ref name=Holland1986/&gt;

This could represent the origin of the two derived groups.&lt;ref name=Young1998/&gt;

Unlike most modern cephalopods, most ancient varieties had protective shells. These shells at first were conical but later developed into curved nautiloid shapes seen in modern [[nautilus]] species.
Competitive pressure from fish is thought to have forced the shelled forms into deeper water, which provided an evolutionary pressure towards shell loss and gave rise to the modern coleoids, a change which led to greater metabolic costs associated with the loss of buoyancy, but which allowed them to recolonise shallow waters.&lt;ref name='Boyle3'&gt;{{cite doi | 10.1002/9780470995310.ch3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|36}} However, some of the straight-shelled [[nautiloids]] evolved into [[belemnites]], out of which some evolved into [[squid]] and [[cuttlefish]].{{Verify source|date=November 2008}}  The loss of the shell may also have resulted from evolutionary pressure to increase manoeuvrability, resulting in a more fish-like habit.&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|289}}

The classification presented here, for recent cephalopods, follows largely from [http://www.mnh.si.edu/cephs/newclass.pdf Current Classification of Recent Cephalopoda] (May 2001), for fossil cephalopods takes from Arkell et al. 1957, Teichert and Moore 1964,  Teichert 1988, and others.  The three subclasses are traditional, corresponding to the three orders of cephalopods recognized by Bather.&lt;ref&gt;

===Suprafamilial classification of the Treatise===
This is the older classification that combines those found in parts K and L of the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology, which forms the basis for and is retained in large part by classifications that have come later.

Nautiloids in general, (Teichert and Moore 1964)  Sequence as given.

: Subclass â  [[Endocerida|Endoceratoidea]].    Not used by Flower, e.g. Flower and Kummel 1950, interjocerids included in the Endocerida.
:: Order â  [[Endocerida]]
:: Order â  [[Intejocerida]]

: Subclass â  [[Actinocerida|Actinoceratoidea]]   Not used by Flower, ibid
:: Order â  [[Actinocerida]]

: Subclass â  [[Nautiloidea]]     Nautiloidea in the restricted sense.
:: Order â  [[Ellesmerocerida]]   Plectronocerida subsequently split off as separate order.
:: Order â  [[Orthocerida]]  Includes orthocerids and pseudorthocerids
:: Order â  [[Ascocerida]]
:: Order â  [[Oncocerida]]

Subsequent revisions include the establishment of three Upper Cambrian orders, the Plectronocerida, Protactinocerida and Yanhecerida; separation of the pseudorthocerids as the Pseudorthocerida, and elevating orthoceritoids as the Subclass Orthoceratoidea.

Another recent system divides all cephalopods into two [[clade]]s.  One includes nautilus and most fossil nautiloids.  The other clade ([[Neocephalopoda]] or Angusteradulata) is closer to modern coleoids, and includes belemnoids, ammonoids, and many [[orthocerid]] families.  There are also [[stem group]] cephalopods of the traditional [[Ellesmerocerida]] that belong to neither clade.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monophyly of coeloids===
The coeloids have been thought to possibly represent a polyphyletic group,&lt;ref name=&quot;mollusca11&quot;/&gt;{{Rp|289}} although this has not been supported by the rising body of molecular data.&lt;ref name=Lindgren2004&gt;{{cite doi|10.1111/j.1096-0031.2004.00032.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-mortem decay==

After death, if undisturbed, cephalopods&lt;ref group=note&gt;Experiments were performed on a variety of squid&lt;/ref&gt; decay relatively quickly.  Their muscle softens within a couple of days, and may swell; egg sacs can swell so much that they rip through the mantle. Subsequently, the organs shrink again; at this point the organism may start to break up into fragments. The eyes retain their size while the head shrinks around them. The gills may remain swollen at this point. After around a week, the carcass collapses in on itself and begins to disintegrate.  The ink sac solidifies around this point. After a fortnight little is left but a blob with eyes, arms and ink sac visible. After a couple of months, these are only recognisable as flattened dark stains - although in some cases the eye lenses can remain intact for up to a year.&lt;ref name=Kear1995/&gt;
