'''Microsoft Corporation''' ({{nasdaq|MSFT}} and {{NYSE|MSFT}}) is an American [[public company|public]] [[multinational corporation]] headquartered in [[Redmond, Washington]], USA that develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of products and services predominantly related to [[computing]] through its various product divisions. Established on April 4, 1975 to develop and sell [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computer software)|interpreters]] for the [[Altair 8800]], Microsoft rose to dominate the [[home computer]] [[operating system]] market with [[MS-DOS]] in the mid-1980s, followed by the [[Microsoft Windows]] line of operating systems.

Microsoft would also come to dominate the [[office suite]] market with [[Microsoft Office]]. The company has diversified in recent years into the [[video game industry]] with the [[Xbox]] and its successor, the [[Xbox 360]] as well as into the [[consumer electronics]] and digital services market with [[Zune]], [[MSN]] and the [[Windows Phone 7|Windows Phone]] OS. The ensuing rise of stock in the company's 1986 [[initial public offering]] (IPO) made an estimated three billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees (Forbes 400 list revealed that in March 2011 both Jon Shipley and Nathan Myhrvold lost their billionaire status). In May 2011, Microsoft Corporation [[List of mergers and acquisitions by Microsoft|acquired]] Skype Communications for $8.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.searchofficespace.com/sos-news/microsoft-buys-skype-for-8-5-billion.html |title=Microsoft buys Skype for $8.5 billion |publisher=The Search Office Space Blog - News.searchofficespace.com |date=2011-05-10 |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primarily in the 1990s, critics{{Who|date=September 2011}} contend Microsoft used [[monopoly|monopolistic]] business practices and anti-competitive strategies including [[refusal to deal]] and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]], put unreasonable restrictions in the use of its software, and used misrepresentative marketing tactics; both the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] and [[European Commission]] found the company in violation of [[antitrust]] laws.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Known for its interviewing process with obscure questions, various studies and ratings were generally favorable to Microsoft's diversity within the company as well as its overall environmental impact with the exception of the electronics portion of the business.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

===Early History===
[[Paul Allen]] and [[Bill Gates]], childhood friends with a passion in [[computer programming]], were seeking to make a successful business utilizing their shared skills. The January 1975 issue of [[Popular Electronics]] featured [[Micro Instrumentation and Telemetry Systems]]'s (MITS) [[Altair 8800]] [[microcomputer]]. Allen noticed that they could program a [[BASIC]] [[interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] for the device; after a call from Gates claiming to have a working interpreter, MITS requested a demonstration. Since they didn't actually have one, Allen worked on a [[simulation|simulator]] for the Altair while Gates developed the interpreter. Although they developed the interpreter on a simulator and not the actual device, the interpreter worked flawlessly when they demonstrated the interpreter to MITS in [[Albuquerque]], New Mexico in March 1975; MITS agreed to distribute it, marketing it as [[Altair BASIC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allan|2001|pp=108, 112â114}}&lt;/ref&gt; They officially established Microsoft on April 4, 1975, with Gates as the [[Chief executive officer|CEO]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BBCTL&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/5085630.stm|title=Bill Gates: A Timeline|work=BBC News|publisher=BBC|date=July 15, 2006|accessdate=July 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allen came up with the original name of &quot;Micro-Soft,&quot; as recounted in a [http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/1995/10/02/206528/index.htm 1995 Fortune magazine article].

Microsoft entered the OS business in 1980 with its own version of [[Unix]], called [[Xenix]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695|title=Under The Hood: Part 8|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060901182630/http://www.computersourcemag.com/articles/viewer.asp?a=695|archivedate=September 11, 2006|work=Computer Source|author=Dyar, Dafydd Neal|date=November 4, 2002|accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it was [[DOS]] (Disk Operating System) that solidified the company's dominance. After negotiations with [[Digital Research]] failed, [[International Business Machines|IBM]] awarded a contract to Microsoft in November 1980 to provide a version of the [[CP/M]] OS, which was set to be used in the upcoming [[IBM Personal Computer]] (IBM PC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=k9xS6t4ibxoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Engines+that+move+markets:+technology+investing+from+railroads+to+the&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BJThTfsoiK3yA4bgoJQH&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=november%201980&amp;f=false |title=Engines that move markets |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this deal, Microsoft purchased a CP/M clone called [[86-DOS]] from [[Seattle Computer Products]], branding it as MS-DOS, which IBM rebranded to [[PC-DOS]]. Following the release of the IBM PC in August 1981, Microsoft retained ownership of MS-DOS. Since IBM [[copyright]]ed the IBM PC [[BIOS]], other companies had to [[Reverse engineering|reverse engineer]] it in order for non-IBM hardware to run as [[IBM PC compatible]]s, but no such restriction applied to the operating systems. Due to various factors, such as MS-DOS's available software selection {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, Microsoft eventually became the leading PC OS vendor.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smart-Microsoft&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Smart Computing|publisher=Sandhills Publishing Company|volume=6|issue=3|url=http://www.smartcomputing.com/editorial/article.asp?article=articles/archive/r0603/09r03/09r03.asp&amp;guid=|title=Microsoft to Microsoft disk operating system (MS-DOS)|date=March 2002|accessdate=August 18, 2008|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Blaxill|Eckardt|2009|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company expanded into new markets with the release of the ''Microsoft Mouse'' in 1983, as well as a publishing division named [[Microsoft Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allan|2001|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Allen resigned from Microsoft in February after developing [[Hodgkin's lymphoma|Hodgkin's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allan|2001|p=231}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1984â1994: Windows and Office===
While jointly developing a new OS with IBM in 1984, [[OS/2]], Microsoft released [[Microsoft Windows]], a graphical extension for MS-DOS, on November 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Allan|2001|pp=242â243, 246}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft moved its headquarters to Redmond on February 26, 1986, and on March 13 the company went [[public company|public]];&lt;ref name=&quot;CBSCHRON&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/elements/2006/06/16/in_depth_business/timeline1720211.shtml|title=Microsoft Chronology|work=CBS News|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ensuing rise in the stock would make an estimated four billionaires and 12,000 millionaires from Microsoft employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;stockrich&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/business/yourmoney/29millionaire.html?ex=1275019200&amp;en=de3d71cbbb7e06f8&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|title=The Microsoft Millionaires Come of Age|author=Bick, Julie|date=May 29, 2005|work=The New York Times|accessdate=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the partnership with IBM, in 1990 the [[Federal Trade Commission]] set its eye on Microsoft for possible [[collusion]]; it marked the beginning of over a decade of legal clashes with the U.S. Government.&lt;ref name=&quot;WiredUSDOJ&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wired.com/techbiz/it/news/2002/11/35212|title=U.S. v.

On July 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice, Antitrust Division filed a Competitive Impact Statement that said, in part:
&quot;Beginning in 1988, and continuing until July 15, 1994, Microsoft induced many OEMs to execute anticompetitive &quot;per processor&quot; licenses. Under a per processor license, an OEM pays Microsoft a royalty for each computer it sells containing a particular microprocessor, whether the OEM sells the computer with a Microsoft operating system or a non-Microsoft operating system. In effect, the royalty payment to Microsoft when no Microsoft product is being used acts as a penalty, or tax, on the OEM's use of a competing PC operating system. Since 1988, Microsoft's use of per processor licenses has increased.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gov/atr/cases/f0000/0045.htm |title=Competitive Impact Statement : U.S. v.

As the smartphone industry boomed beginning in 2007, Microsoft struggled to keep up with its rivals [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Google]] in providing a modern smartphone operating system. As a result, in 2010, Microsoft revamped their aging flagship mobile operating system, [[Windows Mobile]], replacing it with the new [[Windows Phone]] OS; along with a new strategy in the smartphone industry that has Microsoft working more closely with smartphone manufactures, such as [[Nokia]], and to provide a consistent user experience across all smartphones using Microsoft's Windows Phone OS.

Microsoft is a founding member of the [[Open Networking Foundation]] started on March 23, 2011.  Other founding companies include [[Google]], [[HP Networking]], [[Yahoo]], [[Verizon]], [[Deutsche Telekom]] and 17 other companies.

==Product divisions==
{{main|Microsoft Product Divisions}}
&lt;!-- Generally we stick to products that are in the current annual report here - if you wish to add one that is not you need to provide a reference for it --&gt;
For the 2010 [[fiscal year]], Microsoft had five product divisions: Windows &amp; Windows Live Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division.

===Windows &amp; Windows Live Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division===
The company's Client division produces the flagship Windows OS line such as [[Windows 7]]; it also produces the [[Windows Live]] family of products and services. Server and Tools produces the server versions of Windows, such as [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] as well as a set of development tools called [[Microsoft Visual Studio]], [[Microsoft Silverlight]], a web application framework, and [[System Center Configuration Manager]], a collection of tools providing remote-control abilities, patch management, software distribution and a hardware/software inventory. Other server products include: [[Microsoft SQL Server]], a [[relational database]] management system, [[Microsoft Exchange Server]], for certain business-oriented [[e-mail]] and scheduling features, [[Windows Small Business Server|Small Business Server]], for messaging and other small business-oriented features; and [[Microsoft BizTalk Server]], for [[business process management]].

Microsoft provides [[information technology consulting|IT consulting]] (&quot;Microsoft Consulting Services&quot;) and produces a set of certification programs handled by the Server and Tools division designed to recognize individuals who have a minimal set of proficiencies in a specific role; this includes developers ([[Microsoft Certified Professional|&quot;Microsoft Certified Solution Developer&quot;]]), system/network analysts ([[MCSE|&quot;Microsoft Certified Systems Engineer&quot;]]), trainers (&quot;[[Microsoft Certified Professional|Microsoft Certified Trainers]]&quot;) and administrators ([[MCSA|&quot;Microsoft Certified Systems Administrator&quot;]] and [[MCDBA|&quot;Microsoft Certified Database Administrator&quot;]]). [[Microsoft Press]], which publishes books, is also managed by the division. The Online Services Business division handles the online service [[MSN]] and the search engine [[Bing]]. As of December 2009, the company also possesses an 18% ownership of the [[cable news]] channel [[MSNBC]] without any editorial control; however, the division develops the channel's website, [[msnbc.com]], in a [[joint venture]] with the channel's co-owner, [[NBC Universal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSNBC&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/24/business/media/24msnbc.html|title=Microsoft Quits MSNBC TV, but Web Partnership Remains|work=The New York Times|author=Carter, Bill|date=December 24, 2005|accessdate=July 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business Division===
[[Image:Microsoft building 17 front door.jpg|thumb|Front entrance to building 17 on the main campus of the company's Redmond campus.]]

The Microsoft Business Division produces [[Microsoft Office]] including [[Microsoft Office 2010]], the company's line of office software. The software product includes [[Microsoft Office Word|Word]] (a word processor), [[Microsoft Access|Access]] (a [[relational database]] program), [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] (a [[spreadsheet]] program), [[Microsoft Office Outlook|Outlook]] ([[collaborative software|Groupware]], frequently used with [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Exchange Server]]), [[Microsoft PowerPoint|PowerPoint]] (presentation software), and [[Microsoft Publisher|Publisher]] ([[desktop publishing software]]). A number of other products were added later with the release of Office 2003 including [[Microsoft Visio|Visio]], [[Microsoft Project|Project]], [[Microsoft MapPoint|MapPoint]], [[Microsoft InfoPath|InfoPath]] and [[Microsoft Office OneNote|OneNote]]. The division also develops [[enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) software for companies under the [[Microsoft Dynamics]] brand. These include: [[Microsoft Dynamics AX]], [[Microsoft Dynamics NAV]], [[Microsoft Dynamics GP]], and [[Microsoft Dynamics SL]]. They are targeted at varying company types and countries, and limited to organizations with under 7,500 employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;MS Dynamics Lineup&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.directionsonmicrosoft.com/samples/49-samples/743-four-products-advance-on-dynamics-erp-roadmap.html|work=Directions on Microsoft|title=Four Products Advance on Dynamics ERP Roadmap|date=April 27, 2009|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included under the Dynamics brand is the [[customer relationship management]] software [[Microsoft Dynamics CRM]], part of the [[Azure Services Platform]].

===Entertainment and Devices Division===
The Entertainment and Devices Division produces the [[Windows CE]] OS for [[embedded system]]s and [[Windows Phone]] for [[smartphone]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/8301-17918_1-20015314-85.html|title=Microsoft releases Windows Phone 7 to manufacturers|author=Cha, Bonnie|work=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|date=September 1, 2010|accessdate=September 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft initially entered the mobile market through Windows CE for [[handheld device]]s, eventually developing into the [[Windows Mobile]] OS and now, Windows Phone. Windows CE is designed for devices where the OS may not directly be visible to the end user, in particular, appliances and cars. The division also produces [[computer games]] that run on Windows PCs and other systems including titles such as [[Age of Empires]], [[Halo (video game series)|Halo]] and the [[Microsoft Flight Simulator]] series, and houses the [[Macintosh Business Unit]] which produces [[Mac OS]] software including [[Microsoft Office 2011 for Mac]]. Microsoft's Entertainment and Devices Division designs, markets, and manufactures [[consumer electronics]] including the [[Xbox 360]] game console, the handheld [[Zune]] media player, and the television-based [[Internet appliance]] [[MSN TV]]. Microsoft also markets [[personal computer hardware]] including [[computer mouse|mice]], [[Computer keyboard|keyboards]], and various [[game controller]]s such as [[joystick]]s and [[gamepad]]s.&lt;!-- there was a time when mice, keyboards, joysticks were the only hardware MS made, until (what year)--&gt;

==Culture==
&lt;!-- Note we could really use more here about the user culture as the expected behaviur - i.e. how apple tends to generate advocates while Microsoft users mainly see its products as tools, for example--&gt;
Technical reference for developers and articles for various Microsoft magazines such as ''Microsoft Systems Journal'' (or MSJ) are available through the [[Microsoft Developer Network]] (MSDN). MSDN also offers subscriptions for companies and individuals, and the more expensive subscriptions usually offer access to pre-release beta versions of Microsoft software.&lt;ref name=&quot;MSDN-SubscribeFAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/ms123402.aspx?missingurl=%2fsubscriptions%2ffaq%2fdefault.aspx |publisher=Microsoft|title=MSDN Subscription FAQ |accessdate=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;MSJ-home&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.microsoft.com/msj/|title=Microsoft Systems Journal Homepage |publisher=Microsoft|date=April 15, 2004|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004 Microsoft launched a community site for developers and users, titled [[Channel9]], that provides a [[wiki]] and an [[Internet forum]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Hobson&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Hobson, Neville|url=http://www.webpronews.com/topnews/2005/04/11/microsofts-channel-and-cultural-rules |title=Microsoft's Channel 9 And Cultural Rules |work=WebProNews |publisher=iEntry Inc |date=April 11, 2005 |accessdate=July 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another community site that provides daily [[videocast]]s and other services, On10.net, launched on March 3, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;On10-home&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.On10.net|title=On10.net homepage|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=May 4, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Free technical support is traditionally provided through online [[Usenet]] newsgroups, and [[CompuServe]] in the past, monitored by Microsoft employees; there can be several newsgroups for a single product. Helpful people can be elected by peers or Microsoft employees for [[Microsoft Most Valuable Professional]] (MVP) status, which entitles them to a sort of special social status and possibilities for awards and other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.boston.com/business/globe/articles/2005/06/13/somehow_usenet_lumbers_on/|title=Somehow, Usenet lumbers on|author=Bray, Hiawatha|date=June 13, 2005|accessdate=July 3, 2006|work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;br /&gt;* {{cite web|url=http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/mvpfaqs|title=Microsoft MVP Frequently Asked Questions|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Noted for its internal [[lexicon]], the expression [[eat one's own dog food|&quot;eating our own dog food&quot;]] is used to describe the policy of using prerelease and beta versions of products inside Microsoft in an effort to test them in &quot;real-world&quot; situations.&lt;ref name=&quot;dogfood&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Microsoft tests its own dog food|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5047467.html| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070108214545/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5047467.html| archivedate=January 8, 2007|author=CNET News.com Staff|work=ZDNet|publisher=CNET Networks, Inc.|date=July 21, 2003| accessdate=October 9, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is usually shortened to just &quot;dog food&quot; and is used as noun, verb, and adjective. Another bit of [[jargon]], [[FYIFV]] or FYIV (&quot;F**k You, I'm [Fully] Vested&quot;), is used by an employee to indicate they are [[financial independence|financially independent]] and can avoid work anytime they wish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Heileman, John|title=The Truth, The Whole Truth, and Nothing But The Truth|url=http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft_pr.html|work=Wired|date=November 2000|accessdate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is also known for its hiring process, mimicked in other organizations and dubbed the &quot;[[Microsoft interview]]&quot;, which is notorious for off-the-wall questions such as &quot;Why is a [[manhole cover]] round?&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;manhole&quot;&gt;{{cite news| url=http://g4tv.com/screensavers/features/6282/square_manhole_covers_and_crazy_questions.html|title=Square Manhole Covers and Crazy Questions|work=G4TV.com|author=Poundstone, William|date=May 21, 2003|accessdate=July 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft is an outspoken opponent of the cap on [[H1B visa]]s, which allow companies in the U.S. to employ certain foreign workers. Bill Gates claims the cap on H1B visas makes it difficult to hire employees for the company, stating &quot;I'd certainly get rid of the H1B cap&quot; in 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarkRoy&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3500986 |title=Gates Rakes Congress on H1B Visa Cap|author=Mark, Roy|work=internetnews.com|date=April 27, 2005|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of H1B visas argue that relaxing the limits would result in increased unemployment for U.S. citizens due to H1B workers working for lower salaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=88154016|title=

==Corporate affairs==
The company is run by a [[board of directors]] made up of mostly company outsiders, as is customary for publicly traded companies. Members of the board of directors as of June 2010 are: Steve Ballmer, [[Dina Dublon]], Bill Gates (chairman), [[Raymond Gilmartin]], [[Reed Hastings]], [[Maria Klawe]], [[David Marquardt]], [[Charles Noski]], and [[Helmut Panke]].&lt;ref name=&quot;MSPR-Board&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/bod/bod.aspx|title=Microsoft Board of Directors|work=PressPass|publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Board members are elected every year at the annual shareholders' meeting using a majority vote system. There are five committees within the board which oversee more specific matters. These committees include the Audit Committee, which handles accounting issues with the company including auditing and reporting; the Compensation Committee, which approves compensation for the CEO and other employees of the company; the Finance Committee, which handles financial matters such as proposing mergers and acquisitions; the Governance and Nominating Committee, which handles various corporate matters including nomination of the board; and the Antitrust Compliance Committee, which attempts to prevent company practices from violating [[antitrust]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Corporation Corporate Governance Guidelines|url=http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/corporategovernance/guidelines.mspx |publisher=Microsoft|date=July 1, 2009|accessdate=July 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of Microsoft's business tactics, described by an executive as &quot;[[embrace, extend and extinguish]],&quot; initially embraces a competing standard or product, then extends it to produce their own version which is then incompatible with the standard, which in time extinguishes competition that does not or cannot use Microsoft's new version.&lt;ref name=&quot;eee&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-100925.html|title=Intel exec: MS wanted to 'extend, embrace and extinguish' competition|author=Rodger, Will|work=ZDNet|date=November 8, 1998|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various companies and governments sue Microsoft over this set of tactics, resulting in billions of dollars in rulings against the company.&lt;ref name=&quot;Orlowski2004-03-05&quot;&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.burst.com/new/newsevents/pressrelease007.htm |title=Microsoft Corp.

===Financial===
[[Standard and Poor's]] and [[Moody's]] have both given a AAA rating to Microsoft, whose assets were valued at $41&amp;nbsp;billion as compared to only $8.5&amp;nbsp;billion in unsecured debt. Consequently, in February 2011 Microsoft released a corporate bond amounting to $2.25&amp;nbsp;billion with relatively low borrowing rates compared to [[government bonds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/04/us-microsoft-bonds-idUSTRE7128EZ20110204|title=Microsoft sells $2.25&amp;nbsp;billion of debt at low rates|publisher=Reuters | date=February 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in 20 years [[Apple Inc.]] surpassed Microsoft in Q1 2011 quarterly profits and revenues due to a slowdown in PC sales and continuing huge losses in Microsoft's Online Services Division (which contains its search engine Bing). Microsoft profits were $5.2 billion, while Apple Inc. profits were $6 billion, on revenues of $14.5 billion and $24.7 billion respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Charles Arthur |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/28/microsoft-falls-behind-apple |title=Microsoft falls behind Apple for first time in 20 years &amp;#124; Technology |publisher=The Guardian |date= April 28, 2011|accessdate=2011-05-11 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's Online Services Division has been continuously loss-making since 2006 and in Q1 2011 it lost $726 million. This follows a loss of $2.5 billion for the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MG Siegler Apr 29, 2011 |url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/29/microsoft-internet-bloodbath/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29 |title=When Will Microsoftâs Internet Bloodbath End? |publisher=Techcrunch.com |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2011-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environment===
Microsoft is ranked on the 17th place in [[Greenpeace]]âs Guide to Greener Electronics that ranks 18 electronics manufacturers according to their policies on toxic chemicals, recycling and climate change.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenpeace International&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/campaigns/toxics/electronics/Guide-to-Greener-Electronics/ |title=Guide to Greener Electronics â Greenpeace International| publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Microsoftâs timeline for phasing out [[brominated flame retardant|BFR]]s and phthalates in all products is 2012 but its commitment to phasing out PVC is not clear. As yet (January 2011) it has no products that are completely free from PVC and BFRs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/Global/international/publications/toxics/2010/version16/Ranking%20tables%20Oct%202010-Microsoft.pdf |title=Ranking tables October 2010 â Greenpeace International| publisher=Greenpeace International |accessdate=January 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft's main U.S. campus received a silver certification from the [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design]] (LEED) program in 2008, and it installed over 2,000 solar panels on top of its buildings in its Silicon Valley campus, generating approximately 15 percent of the total energy needed by the facilities in April 2005.&lt;ref name=&quot;news1&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/Microsoft-vs.-Google-Whos-greener/2100-1022_3-6080297.html?tag=mncol;txt|title=Microsoft vs. Google: Who's greener?|work=CNET|publisher=CBS Interactive|author=Mills, Elinor|date=June 6, 2008|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft makes use of alternative forms of transit. It created one of the worlds largest private bus systems, the &quot;Connector&quot;, to transport people from outside the company; for on-campus transportation, the &quot;Shuttle Connect&quot; uses a large fleet of hybrid cars to save fuel. The company also subsidises regional [[public transport]] as an incentive.&lt;ref name=&quot;news1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/environment/our_commitment/articles/alternative_commuting.aspx|title=Fostering Alternative Ways to Commute at Microsoft|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=July 6, 2009}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2010 however, Microsoft took a stance against adding additional public transport and [[high-occupancy vehicle lane|high-occupancy vehicle]] (HOV) lanes to a bridge connecting Redmond to Seattle; the company did not want to delay the construction any further.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.king5.com/news/Microsofts-big-520-advertisement-85031317.html|work=King5 Television News|title=Seattle hires consultant to look at 520 bridge plan|date=February 23, 2010|accessdate=July 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft was ranked number 1 in the list of the World's Best Multinational Workplaces by the Great Place to Work Institute in 2011. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoftpri0/2016631709_microsoft_named_best_multinational_workplace_by_gr.html |title=Microsoft Pri0 &amp;#124; Microsoft named best multinational workplace |publisher=Seattle Times Newspaper |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marketing===
In 2004, Microsoft commissioned research firms to do independent studies comparing the [[total cost of ownership]] (TCO) of [[Windows Server 2003]] to [[Linux]]; the firms concluded that companies found Windows easier to administrate than Linux, thus those using Windows would administrate faster resulting in lower costs for their company (i.e. lower TCO).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/business/158237_msftresearch27.html|title=Studies on Linux help their patron: Microsoft|author=Bishop, Todd|work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|publisher=Hearst Seattle Media, LLC|date=January 27, 2004|accessdate=July 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This spurred a wave of related studies; a study by the [[Yankee Group]] concluded that upgrading from one version of Windows Server to another costs a fraction of the switching costs from Windows Server to Linux, although companies surveyed noted the increased security and reliability of Linux servers and concern about being locked into using Microsoft products.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foley&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.microsoft-watch.com/content/operating_systems/yankee_independently_pits_windows_tco_vs_linux_tco.html|title=Yankee Independently Pits Windows TCO vs. Linux TCO |author=Foley, Mary Jo|work=eWeek |date=March 24, 2004 |accessdate=July 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, released by the [[Open Source Development Labs|OSDL]], claimed that the Microsoft studies were &quot;simply outdated and one-sided&quot; and their survey concluded that the TCO of Linux was lower due to Linux administrators managing more servers on average and other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.vnunet.com/vnunet/news/2150210/linux-fans-hit-back-microsoft |title=Linux fans hit back at Microsoft TCO claims|author=Jaques, Robert|work=vnunet.com|date=February 13, 2006 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the &quot;Get the Facts&quot; campaign Microsoft highlighted the [[.NET framework|.NET]] trading platform that it had developed in partnership with Accenture for the [[London Stock Exchange]], claiming that it provided &quot;[[High availability|five nines]]&quot; reliability.

Microsoft adopted the so-called &quot;''[[Pac-Man]]'' Logo&quot;, designed by Scott Baker, in 1987. Baker stated &quot;The new logo, in Helvetica italic typeface, has a slash between the ''o'' and ''s&amp;nbsp;'' to emphasize the &quot;soft&quot; part of the name and convey motion and speed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|work=Computer Reseller News Magazine|month=March|year=1987|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dave Norris ran an internal joke campaign to save the old logo, which was green, in all uppercase, and featured a fanciful letter ''O'', nicknamed the ''blibbet'', but it was discarded.&lt;ref name=&quot;Osterman2005-07-14&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2005/07/14/438777.aspx|title=Remember the blibbet|work=Larry Osterman's WebLog|publisher=Microsoft|author=Osterman, Larry|date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft's logo with the &quot;''Your potential.

In 2002, the company started using the logo in the United States and eventually started a TV campaign with the slogan, changed from the previous tagline of ''&quot;[[Where do you want to go today?]]&quot;.''&lt;ref name=&quot;wherego1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;potentialpassion1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Reimer&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20060123-6031.html|title=Microsoft set to launch new marketing campaign|work=Ars Technica|publisher=CondÃ© Nast Digital|author=Reimer, Jeremy|date=January 23, 2006|accessdate=August 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the private MGX (Microsoft Global Exchange) conference in 2010, Microsoft unveiled the company's next tagline, ''&quot;Be What's Next.&quot;'', as well as a new logo scheduled for use sometime in the future.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010logo&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/07/22/new-microsoft-brand-logos-company-tagline-revealed-at-mgx-event/|title=New Microsoft brand logos, company tagline revealed at MGX event?|author=Topolsky, Joshua|work=engadget|publisher=Aol News|date=July 22, 2010|accessdate=July 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
