=== Changes and contestants===
For the first time, the audience picked the final two contestants to compete in Nuestra Belleza Latina 2011 in an online casting. This will define two seats left vacant to go to Miami. The voting ended February 19 at midnight. Each contestant that wins a challenge will win $10,000 dollars. All four winners, from previous seasons, will do the opening scene and also be mentors for the girls throughout the season. Winner [[Ana Patricia GonzÃ¡lez]] will be the co-hostess throughout the competition. A new house will be chosen this year, for the first time the judges may pick one week prior to finale to save both girls from elimination. For the second time, an expulsion occurred. The first time was in 2009, when Puerto Rican Stephanie Figueroa was expelled for disobeying contest rules. This time, Cuban Juliete Cabrera was caught in a sexually explicit photo-shoot scandal. Although the photos were taken prior to the show, the contestant was disqualified and replaced by Semi-Finalist Jenny Arzola who also represented Cuba. For the first time, only four finalists were in the finale. This was achieved by having a double elimination in week seven and adding an entire week of competition. The logo was also altered, having the actual crown used by [[Ana Patricia Gonzalez]] replace previous drawing.

=== Season 5, Episode 2: 89 Contestants,Group 1-From 24 to 12 ===
Original Air Dateâ13 March 2011
The 89 selected girls go to Miami. They receive classes and hit the runway for the first time. The judges eliminate 12 of them. While for some girls the joy of being in continuous Nuestra Belleza Latina, others were overcome by sadness to know that their participation in the show was over. After winning the passes during the auditions, but choose to travel to Miami and some said goodbye to his dream of becoming the new queen. This week came more than fifteen girls during rehearsals and diction classes. In addition to tears, this show was full of challenges and Prince Royce came to put the musical touch to the song that Univision.com users chose to inaugurate the show. Since arriving in Miami the girls began a strong training classes in diction, choreography and gateway. Some failed to give teachers the length and therefore another group of girls left the competition on Monday. Besides beauty and intelligence, the next queen has to be a talented girl. That's why the judges were asked to submit their special talents. Those that did not meet the expectations of the judges also had to say goodbye. In this first gala after mass disposal, there were only 12 girls, who before the judges, the audience and viewers had to explain why they want to be the next Nuestra Belleza Latina and then paraded for the first time in this competition in bikini. Natacha and Altagracia, two heartbreaking goodbyes. It is never easy to dismiss the girls when judges decide to end their dream, but is even more difficult when the cause of this output is health. This week the show was hit with two important players for this reason. Natacha RodrÃ­guez, Puerto Rican whose story touched our hearts during the first show, underwent medical examination and found to be five weeks pregnant. This forced the production to end his stay in Miami as the most important thing is your health and your baby. The story of Altagracia is even more heartbreaking. The medical examination determined that Bianca has Lupus, a disease that affects the defense and that she hid all suffering from life threatening. She had not said anything to her mother because she was afraid to disappoint. Who would say that the production Altagracia her mother traveled to Miami to surprise her and say that beyond disappointment, I was very proud of her. Look at photos. He also made official judges and teachers at this gala, the experts take care and polish every aspect of the life and career of the applicants.

=== Season 5, Episode 3: Group 2 - From 24 to 12 ===
Original Air Dateâ20 March 2011 The 57 remaining girls are divided in groups to perform one last time for the judges before the show on Sunday. The judges eliminate 33 leaving the top 24 girls from group 2. Four groups have musical numbers and the other four acting scenes. The girls get critiqued and slowly start narrowing down the group. At the end of the show, the judges eliminate 12 girls, Leaving Top 12 from group 2. Twelve girls were chosen in the second group and I only have 24 but there's a problem ... in the mansion there is only room for 12. We were the second group of girls since arriving in Miami and among them were the two winners of our Virtual Casting, Vivian Valadez and Carol Ramos.Giselle opened the show by introducing the judges JuliÃ¡n Gil, Lupita Jones and Osmel Sousa. Osmel said he would not to comment during the night and thank goodness it would be discreet.When he opened his mouth was to be hoped that two girls drowned, to say ugly to another and to ask a group of girls were imprisoned by bad actresses.The second group girls were presented one by one, parading in their finery and learned a little more theatrical skills in acting exercises. It was obvious rivalry between the girls in the first group and second. When newly arrived in Miami were suffering in his first exercise class with Joseph, the girls in the first group were to spy and do not see why I put smilies. But if you looked hard exercise class, the geography was shameful. The poor Osmel was nerves because several of the girls could not identify America on the map. Compared the knowledge production of the girls against Emma, a girl of eight years, which proved to be better educated than them.And from the evil drink that was the geography class to something more pleasant, it was seeing girls in bikinis. The judges initially threw out the second group girls in bikinis and you have, one by one, all the photos as Osmel saw them in trials.The show was full of energy with a performance by Gloria Trevi and the great song &quot;I laugh at you&quot;, which he dedicated to Osmel think the dunce cap or they put the girls in class. You can not imagine the marathon in tears to see so many girls was crying when production allowed them to call their loved ones goodbye and confiscated their phones.Tears, emotion, but everything is for the dream of the crown.For the first time all season that the sisters had to vote between them to eliminate one. The two girls faced more votes to go to the jury and they decided not to save either.

=== Season 5, Episode 6: Backstabbing, Pole Dancing and Mud ===
Original Air Dateâ10 April 2011 The 11 remaining girls hit the runway for an amazing week. At panel one of the girls is eliminated. Another week cardiac output Paulette Acosta, Giselle dancing with the girls and the pace of Tito el Bambino marked the sixth show of Nuestra Belleza Latina 2011. The 11 participants were subjected to two major tests during the week: report from a construction site through any obstacle and a pole dancing sensual dance where they had to demonstrate their agility as athletes and dancers at the challenge of pole dancing. Pretty generally conductive, Giselle Blondet, is responsible for encouraging girls during the tests but this time wanted to show solidarity with them and learn the choreography of the show opening. The audience went crazy when Giselle went to the dance floor to shake your hips to the rhythm of mambo and demonstrate that if they compete, the girls would be in serious trouble to snatch the crown. This challenge was held secret for a week and eleven girls did not know what to expect when they arrived at the location, in miniskirts and heels. Once there were reported to be reported from a construction site without suspecting that the production would submit to all sorts of obstacles to measuring the calm before the cameras in front of unexpected situations. When Nuestra Belleza Latina participants were in full report at all surprised by the sound of a drilling machine that kept driving their interviews or listen to their interviews. All of them will cast a valde of water and mud as they were about to close his report that helped the jury to measure who responded and who are naturally frozen on camera. If you thought the treacherous catwalk last week was difficult, the challenges of this week confirmed that this competition is getting tougher. During the week the candidates had to rehearse sexy choreography, in which used as tools from chairs to a tube, activity that was not all easy because each had to demonstrate physical dexterity and could not always look as seductive as intended. Our dear CharytÃ­n was encouraging them and watching their development to qualify. Diana Cano was really distressed testing tube and surprised all with his shyness and concern about what your coworkers think of her Wall Street. Darla proved to be the most agile of the group, and a good companion to teach Gredmarie their best moves. After the challenges came time to decide. They announced the candidate with fewer votes from the public and the two who had received worse grades on the challenges. The girl with the fewest public votes was Paulette Acosta, and she joined Villa and Diana Cano Jocell with lower qualifications. It's time for the girls to save someone and no one would believe to be saved. Nothing more, nothing less than Diana Cano, the most direct of all participants. In front of the judges were Jocell and Paulette Villa Acosta, the latter being the judges decided to eliminate. We are consenting to our audience and because you asked Tito &quot;El Bambino&quot; will be responsible to make everyone dance to its rhythm.

Before addressing the issue of Juliette, we saw what happened in the week. There's tests of skill and there is evidence of honesty. And in the latter won, surprise, Diana Cano. The girls had to write a private letter several truths of others and of themselves without knowing that such contents be revealed to all. And what's that ensued when revelaron.Maribel of Santiago lost her temper and Diana Cano accused of being a liar, screaming. Diana Cano did not pay much attention because in this show with great sadness she was reminded of her ex-boyfriend and shed many tears for him showing that she is vulnerable and has a good heart. The girls were asked to seal their letters and pledge their veracity and only Diana Cano had the courage to seal her letter with her name. Although Miriam HernÃ¡ndez seemed shy and coy, she left all the girls shocked. This week Miriam and Juliette had a heated argument. Miriam called Juliette a &quot;prostitute&quot; and Juliette threw water at Miriam, causing Miriam to react by throwing a plate of food at Miriam.  The challenge of the week was marred by some compromising photos of Juliette Cabrera that emerged in social networks and the internet. Juliette posed suggestively and production met to define whether this violated the official rules of competition must abide by all the judges participantes. Los Cabrera explained that Juliet was not on trial for his life, but for violating the rules and because the public viralizÃ³ their photos by creating this scandal. Production determined that her photos were objectionable and that they violated the rules that they all signed up to participate in the competition as Juliet Cabrera left the competencia.Pero which would be the surprise when he left Juliet Cabrera announced the entry of a of the girls that was previously deleted. Who would? Before this big announcement, we review the challenge of chicas.El Nuestra Belleza Latina challenge this week was won by which they were physically better prepared because they had to imitate the training routine performed by the Fire Department Broward County. It was not only so, but do it as fast possible. The participants faced an extreme challenge in a large building where there was everything: a lot of weight on the body, a dark room, alleged victims, a lot of adrenaline and physical exertion, but next to very handsome men. The success of the test depended on the ability of girls to work in pairs (although some were uneven). Production divided them: Juliet Cabrera and Miriam Hernandez, Diana Maribel Cano and Santiago, Gredmarie Columbus and Nicole Smith, Darla Delgado and finally Villa Jocell Nastassja Bolivar and Patricia Corcino. The winners were Patricia Corcino and Nastassja Bolivar who were rewarded with a dinner with Alejandro Chaban and assist Giselle Blondet at the Mana concert in Miami.The music guest was Joey Montana who sang his song &quot;The Melody&quot;. The competition was made more difficult as former 2003 Miss Universe Amelia Vega from the Dominican Republic announced the challenge of the week. Amelia was like a fairy godmother for girls and accompanied them during their visit to the Miami Zoo to test the challenge of judges and that was the wildest of the season. The test was to enter a cave with reptiles; Nastassja Bolivar stopped to cry because she has a phobia of snakes. A paramedic had to measure her tension in the dressing room to monitor their anxiety, but found that was able to continue. Curiously, despite her fear, Nastassja Bolivar won the second best score for this challenge with 26 points after Darla Delgado who scored 28 points. Jocell Villa received the lowest score, followed by Nicole Suarez and Diana Cano. Nicole Suarez and Jocell Villa were in front of the judges and they saved Nicole Suarez. With much pain the show said goodbye to the beautiful Jocell Villa.

=== Season 5, Episode 10: Nuestra Belleza's Mothers Day ===
Original Air Dateâ8 May 2011 The 7 remaining girls hit the runway for an amazing week. The girls make a special dance for mothers day. The seven must answer difficult questions at panel. At panel the six Finalist are announced. In past editions, some participants were displayed as the strongest in the tournament but this year it has been different since each gala has surprised us with strange and unexpected eliminations. The best challenge of the season no doubt was held at the offices of NuestraBellezaLatina.com where Jenny Arzola, Gredmarie Colon, Patricia Corcino, Diana Cano, Nastassja Bolivar, Miriam Hernandez and Nicole Suarez were assigned each with a photo of a celebrity in which they would have to transform and imitate. The girls were glammed up and combed to imitate each photo but it was difficult to imitate the perfect pose and attitude in a photo shoot with photographer Felipe Cuevas, under the guidance of a master of imitation, Mexican actress AngÃ©lica Vale. AngÃ©lica Vale, star of our next web novel, No Me Hallo, determined that Miriam Hernandez, who imitated Shaila DÃºrcal, was the best photograph and was awarded $1,000 on Univision Mastercard card. She also received a professional photo shoot for her portfolio. The reward challenge was led by the famous brand JCPenney, and in honor of Mother's Day the girl's mothers would be part of the weekly activity. The girls paraded with their mothers, except Diana Cano and HernÃ¡ndez Miriam who marched with her best friend and grandmother respectively. One of the most emotional moments of this gala was the message that Diana Cano received from her mother who was in Ecuador, Diana cried and proved once again that she is not as cold and strong as she looks. The winners of this challenge were Nasstassja Bolivar and her mother who celebrated with lots of hugs and kisses. JCPenney taught the girls how to dress for the spring season in the virtual closet. Dancing with the most handsome guys from Univision in Episode 9 was a success but not easy, dancing different genres had been a task that required much effort, but it falls short of what the girls lived in the tenth gala where they had to present TV segments and were coached by BÃ¡rbara Bermudo, ChiquinquirÃ¡ Delgado, Marisa del Portillo, Lili Estefan, Maria Elena Salinas, Jackie Guerrido and Lourdes Stephen. The girls moved their bodies to the rhythm grupero Intocable. The guys from this band prepared a great show of good humor to put our beloved &quot;iron judge&quot; Osmel Sousa to dance. Jenny Arzola from Cuba went straight to the judges for having the least number of votes. Nasstasja Bolivar and Diana Cano were also in the bottom three, but the other constestants saved Nastassja. In the end, Diana went with Jenny to face the judges. Diana Cano was eliminated by the judges in the tenth gala, after being saved several times by her fellow contestants.
