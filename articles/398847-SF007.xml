'''Nutch''' is an effort to build an [[open source]] [[web search engine]] based on [[Lucene|Lucene Java]] for the search and index component.

== Features ==
Nutch is coded entirely in the [[Java (programming language)|Java programming language]], but data is written in language-independent formats.  It has a highly modular architecture, allowing developers to create plug-ins for media-type parsing, data retrieval, querying and clustering.

The fetcher (&quot;robot&quot; or &quot;[[web crawler]]&quot;) has been written from scratch specifically for this project.

== History ==
Nutch originated with [[Doug Cutting]], creator of both [[Lucene]] and [[Hadoop]], and [[Mike Cafarella]].

In June, 2003, a successful 100-million-page demonstration system was developed. To meet the multimachine processing needs of the crawl and index tasks, the Nutch project has also implemented a [[MapReduce]] facility and a [[distributed file system]]. The two facilities have been spun out into their own subproject, called [[Hadoop]].

In January, 2005, Nutch joined the [[Apache Incubator]], from which it graduated to become a subproject of Lucene in June of that same year. Since April, 2010, Nutch has been considered an independent, top level project of the [[Apache Software Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nutch.apache.org/#News Nutch News]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucidimagination.com/blog/2009/03/09/nutch-solr/ Using Nutch with Solr]&lt;/ref&gt; ==
Some of the advantages of Nutch, when compared to a simple Fetcher
* highly scalable and relatively feature rich crawler
* features like politeness which obeys robots.txt rules
* robust and scalable - you can run Nutch on a cluster of 100 machines
* quality - you can bias the crawling to fetch âimportantâ pages first

== Scalability ==
IBM Research studied the performance&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cecs.uci.edu/~papers/ipdps07/pdfs/SMTPS-201-paper-1.pdf Scalability of the Nutch search engine]&lt;/ref&gt; of Nutch/Lucene as part of its Commercial Scale Out (CSO) project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://weather.ou.edu/~apw/projects/cso/prov_paper.pdf Base Operating System Provisioning and Bringup for a Commercial Supercomputer]&lt;/ref&gt; Their findings were that a [[Scalability#Scale horizontally (scale out)|scale-out]] system, such as Nutch/Lucene, could achieve a performance level on a cluster of blades that was not achievable on any [[Scalability#Scale_vertically_.28scale_up.29|scale-up]] computer such as the [[Power5]].

The ClueWeb09 dataset (used in e.g. [[Text Retrieval Conference|TREC]]) was gathered using Nutch, with an average speed of 755.31 documents per second.&lt;ref&gt;http://boston.lti.cs.cmu.edu/crawler/crawlerstats.html&lt;/ref&gt;
