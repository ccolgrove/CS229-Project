'''Ritscher Upland''' is a large ice-covered upland of western [[Queen Maud Land]], bounded by [[Kraul Mountains]] and [[Heimefront Range]] to the west and southwest, and by [[Borg Massif]] and [[Kirwan Escarpment]] to the east. It was discovered by the [[Third German Antarctic Expedition]] (1938â1939), and named for Capt. [[Alfred Ritscher]], leader of the expedition. It was remapped from air photos taken by the [[Norwegian-British-Swedish Antarctic Expedition]] (NBSAE) (1949â1952), led by [[John Schjelderup GiÃ¦ver]].&lt;ref name=gnis12688&gt;USGS Geographic Names Information System: [http://geonames.usgs.gov/pls/gnispublic/f?p=gnispq:5:::NO::P5_ANTAR_ID:12688 USGS GNIS: Ritscher Upland]&lt;/ref&gt;
