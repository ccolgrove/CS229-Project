The '''World Environment Day Awards''' are presented annually by the [[United Nations Association of Australia]] in support of the [[United Nations Environment Programme]]âs World Environment Day. The awards recognise the innovative and outstanding programs and initiatives from across Australia, and the important work of Australian environmental leaders.
The annual awards program invites nominations from individuals, organisations, businesses, local councils, school, journalists and community groups whose work serves to protect, manage or restore Australiaâs natural heritage. The awards aim to raise awareness about key environmental issues and challenges, and to inspire and motivate individuals, organisations and businesses to take positive steps towards sustainability and environmental excellence in their homes, school, communities and workplaces.
