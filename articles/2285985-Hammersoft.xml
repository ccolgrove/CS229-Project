'''RTL Klub''' is a television station (M-RTL Zrt.) owned by [[RTL Group]] and broadcast in [[Hungary]]. It was one of Hungary's first commercial TV channels and was only two days after the main rival [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]] to begin broadcasting.

==About RTL Klub==
Since its start, RTL Klub has focused to gain viewers from the urban population. The channel airs programs mostly for a younger (18â49) audience.

RTL and TV2 aired two similar major reality series simultaneously. While TV2 purchased the rights of ''[[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]]'', RTL Klub produced its own series called ''ValÃ³ VilÃ¡g'' (Real World).
ValÃ³ VilÃ¡g had 3 seasons between 2002 and 2004. Since its second season the show has been much more successful than the rival ''Big Brother''.

RTL is the most watched TV channel in Hungary, thanks to the daily Hungarian soap opera 'BarÃ¡tok kÃ¶zt' (Among Friends), which is the most watched TV programme in Hungary with more than 2 million viewers; the magazine show 'FÃ³kusz' (Focus) and the game show ''Legyen Ãn is milliomos'' (''[[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?]]''). Millionaire is off the schedule from September 2007 after 7 years and will be replaced by A SzÃ©f ([[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It Or Leave It]]).

From the fall/winter season of 2005â2006 RTL Klub has started to broadcast popular American TV shows like Lost. The first episode of Lost had almost 2 million viewers, and a 50% share. This was a record. The next year Prison Break started with almost 1.6 million. Nowadays a TV show at primetime (21:00) can reach 1â1.5 million viewers. At season 2006/2007 Prison Break was the most watched American series in Hungary.

From the Fall season of 2007 RTL Klub has launched two new formats with great success. Poker Face ran like a tournament for 6 weeks with an average 38â42% share. The other new show was [[America's Got Talent|&quot;Csillag szÃ¼letik,&quot;]] the Hungarian version of the RTL &quot;Got Talent&quot; format. Poker Face ended with the super final at 18 December and the time slot of it will be occupied by the new game show &quot;A SzÃ©f&quot; (''[[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take It or Leave it]]'').

RTL Klub has been the only licensed broadcaster of [[Formula One]] in Hungary.

The RTL Klub has been the only licensed bordcaster of [[Domino Day]] in Hungary, for 6 years (2004âPresent).

From 2010 RTL Klub started with 2 winning formats. First of all the chanell after 6 years absence successfully relaunched the [[ValÃ³ VilÃ¡g]] franchise. VV4 ran with a 40% SHR among 18-49 demographic &lt;ref&gt;Est.hu [http://est.hu/cikk/86765 &quot;ValÃ³ VilÃ¡g 4: TÃ¶retlen siker&quot; (VV4: Great success)] January 15, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly they purchased the rights of television talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]. The show ran with a 50% SHR &lt;ref&gt;Est.hu [http://www.pestiest.hu/cikk/82831/az_x-faktor_megeszi_a_megasztart_reggelire] &quot;Az X-Faktor megeszi a MegasztÃ¡rt reggelire&quot; (The X Factor eats MegasztÃ¡r for breakfest)] September 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; among 18-49 demographic which is really high on the Hungarian television market. The Factor crashed the competitor talent show on TV2 so &quot;MegasztÃ¡r&quot; left the time slot of The X Factor after a few episodes. 
Because of the success of both format RTL Klub renewed both show for the 5th and 2nd season respectively. They started at the Fall season of 2011.

==Other formats==

* '''[[BarÃ¡tok kÃ¶zt]]''' (Among Friends): the most watched domestically produced television soap of Hungary. The show started in the fall of 1998, one year after the foundation of RTL Klub. The show remarkably resembles BBC soap-drama, [[Eastenders]]. Initially, it didn't have the expected ratings (however, bound by the contract), RTL Klub had to keep the show running. Since 2000, the third season, the show has been rarely beaten in ratings in its own timeslot. Today, the average rating of the show is about 2 million viewers, and it's a solid foundation of viewers the channel occasionally builds on. Each episode of the series is 10 minutes long, and every weekday 2 episodes are aired. In between the two episodes, there is a news session as well as the highest value commercial block in Hungarian television.
* '''X-Faktor''': the licensed version of the talent show [[The X Factor (TV series)|The X Factor]]. The first season started in the fall season of 2010. Because of the great success the 2nd season started one year later.
* '''ValÃ³ VilÃ¡g''' (Real World): the show is similar to the reality show Big Brother although there are some major differencies between the 2 format. VV first started on RTL Klub at 2002. At the same time the rivel TV channel (TV2) purchased the right of the successful Big Brother format. The 1st seasons of the 2 shows had similar ratings but BB was slightly ahead. Since the 2nd season VV crashed the rivel format so BB moved to the late night time slot and died quietly. The 2nd season of VV was followed with a 3rd one which had great ratings again. (The was no BB3). After the 3rd season of VV ended RTL Klub had the format rested for 6 years. In 2010 they relanched the format with some changes. VV4 was followed by VV5 in 2011. RTL Klub sold the format of VV to Czeck Republic and Slovakia where the show was called VyvolenÃ­. The Czech VV had 3 seasons while the Slovak had 2. In both countries VyVolenÃ­ (the chosen one) won the time slot against Big Brother.
* '''Csillag SzÃ¼letik''' (A Star is Born): the Hungarian licensed version of [[Britain's Got Talent]]. 3 seasons has been aired.
* '''Esti Showder''': a very popular talk show being broadcast every second week (except summer) at Thursdays 21:00. It loosely follows the format of NBC's [[Tonight Show]]. The show features an opening session with the host cracking somewhat actualized jokes and rapidfire humorous monologues, followed by a regular session of ''Design Center'', in which the host ironically presents absurd or downright ridiculous products created and sent to the show by viewers. After the design center, the show features a studio music session which presents successful or potentially successful Hungarian bands, and finally the show presents a talk session where FÃ¡bry sits down and talks to different Hungarian celebrities.
* '''FÃ³kusz''' (Focus): It is a daily report magazine.  It is on the air since the foundation of RTL Klub. (1997)
* '''GÃ¡lvÃ¶lgyi Show''': a parody show hosted by JÃ¡nos GÃ¡lvÃ¶lgyi, featuring short sketches which are parodies of TV shows, Hungarian and international celebrities, and commercials. The show also has several regular sketches, such as a conversation between two working-out rich men, which led to the birth of a decade-old Hungarian catchphrase &quot;GyÃºrunk vazze'&quot; (&quot;We're working out, damn it&quot;).
* '''HÃ¡zon kÃ­vÃ¼l''' (Outside the House): a political show, which deals with two or three actual political events or social problems every week.
* '''Heti Hetes''' (&quot;The Weekly Seven&quot;): a show where seven known Hungarian comedians (one host and 6 guests) talk about actual news, politics and public life.
* '''KÃ©sz ÃtverÃ©s''' (The Cheat): a show similar to the MTV's [[Punk'd]] where the host does pranks on Hungarian and currently visiting celebrities.
* '''A SzÃ©f''': A licensed version of [[Take It Or Leave It (game show)|Take it or Leave it]].  It began airing during the 2007 fall season.
* '''XXI. SzÃ¡zad''' (21st Century): a documentary series which usually deals with historical moments which happened in the 20th century. Recordings presented in the show usually originate from the communist era and therefore are black and white. RTL Klub purchases most of the presented material from Hungarian National TV ([[Magyar TelevÃ­ziÃ³|MTV]] or m1).

* '''BalÃ¡zs Show''': a daily tabloid talk show, which aired every weekday at 16:30. The show followed a slightly more lightened up format than its counterpart, MÃ³nika show. It ended in 2007 after years of success, cited reason being that the host became popular and wanted more serious challenges.

In it famous Hungarian people dance with professional dancers. This show is also very popular. The 2nd season finale had more viewers than the FIFA Football World Cup Final in Hungary. (Italy vs. France), it should however be noted that Hungary were not in the competition hence weakening interest. It had 3 seasons. 2 in 2006 (spring and fall) and 1 in 2008 (fall).
* '''GyÅzike''': a documentary-soap about a Hungarian [[Romani people|gypsy]] family. The head of the family called [[GyÅzÅ GÃ¡spÃ¡r]], husband and father of two girls, who is a pop/rap singer and he had a band but after the show started in 2005 the band broke up. It used to be a very popular show, bearing similarities to [[MTV]]'s ''[[the Osbournes]]''. It had 7 seasons but the return of the show is unlikely.
* '''Legyen Ãn is Milliomos''': The licensed version of [[Who Wants to be a Millionaire]]. The series lasted nine seasons, hosted by Hungary's esteemed quiz host, [[:hu:VÃ¡gÃ³ IstvÃ¡n]], but it was not going to be renewed after the licensor changed to RTL's major game show format. In September 2009, the show adopted a slightly different format; the host was changed to comedian [[:hu:FÃ¡bry SÃ¡ndor]], and the players are always a pair of celebrities. It is aired once a month.
* '''PÃ³kerarc''': The Hungarian adaption of the RTL format [[PokerFace (game show)|PokerFace]]. It debuted at November 2007 and broadcast every day at 19.00.

The host of the game is IstvÃ¡n VÃ¡gÃ³ (the host of the previous game show [[Who wants to be a Millionaire?]] and BalÃ¡zs SebestyÃ©n (the host of BalÃ¡zs show and KÃ©sz ÃtverÃ©s). The 2nd season started in fall 2008.
* '''A KÃ­sÃ©rtÃ©s''' (The Temptation): the licensed version of ''[[Temptation Island (TV series)|Temptation Island]]''. The show had one season on RTL Klub in 2004 and had moderate ratings and so it wasn't renewed for a second season.
* '''A RettegÃ©s Foka''' (Fear Factor): It is a licensed version of the American ''[[Fear Factor]]''. It was cancelled after 2 seasons, reruns however are still aired on Cool TV.
* '''Survivor â A sziget''' (Survivor - The Island): the licensed version of the famous hit reality show ''[[Survivor (TV series)|Survivor]]'', whose international format rights are held by RTL. RTL Klub aired two seasons. The major difference between the Hungarian Survivor and the original one was the winner was selected by a public vote (via SMS or phone calls).
* '''SzeszÃ©lyes''' (Capricious): a show similar to long-running ''SzeszÃ©lyes Ãvszakok'' (Capricious Seasons). After the cancellation of the original show, RTL Klub launched its own version with the host [[Imre Antal]], which ran until Antal's death of [[cancer]] in 2008. The channel didn't renew the license for the show because it had considerably lower ratings than the original.

==Sister TV channels==
RTL Klub has many sister Channels. One of the owners of RTL Klub is &quot;IKO KÃ¡beltÃ©vÃ© Kft.&quot; which also owns Cool TV, Film+, SportKlub, SportKlub+ (which is a non-airing channel since 2009), DoQ, F&amp;H, Sorozat+, PoÃ©n! (which became Prizma in December 2010), Reflektor and Film+2, all of which are in some way related to the IKO's primary channel, RTL Klub.

===Cool TV===
The target audience of Cool TV is 15â29 urban youths who love music, externals, clothes, trendy lifestyle and extravagance. The channel was launched in 2004 and it is available in the 46.7% of the country in 1.7 million households.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} The channel is on a [[24/7]] broadcast schedule, targeting audience not only during the day, but during the night as well. Cool TV airs reruns of series RTL Klub originally purchased or produced as well as series targeting today's youth. These include:
* ''[[South Park]]''
* ''[[Cobra 11]]''
* ''[[Married... with Children]]'' (''Egy rÃ©m rendes csalÃ¡d'')
* ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''
* ''[[Footballer's Wives]]'' (''Futbalista felesÃ©gek'')
* ''[[The L Word]]'' (''L'')
* ''[[Queer as Folk (US TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'' (''A fiÃºk a klubbÃ³l'')
* ''[[The Unit]]'' (''Az egysÃ©g'')
* ''[[Dead Like Me]]'' (''HalÃ¡li hullÃ¡k'')
* ''[[Weeds (TV series)|Weeds]]'' (''Spangli'')
* ''[[Skins (TV series)|Skins]]'' (''Skins'')
* ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' (''SzÃ¼letett felesÃ©gek'')
* Reruns of RTL Klub's reality programming.

In 2007, Cool TV launched a series of topical shows produced by the channel, such as Cool Live and Cool Night featuring younger hosts lent to Cool by RTL Klub. To date, only the mentioned pair of the shows survived, the earlier being a youth lifestyle show, and the latter being an adult show including interviews with Hungarian pornstars and producers, as well as occasionally shown softcore video clips.

In 2009, Cool TV purchased the airing rights of the successful Hungarian version of [[Whose line is it anyway?]], [[BeugrÃ³]].

===Film+===
Film+ was launched in 2004, the same time as Cool TV. The channel airs movies which previously aired on RTL Klub [[24/7]]. According to 2009 Hungarian television ratings, Film+ is the fifth most watched cable channel in Hungary.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Due to the early success of the channel, the parent company launched Film+2, which airs movies in the same fashion as Film+.

===SportKlub===
The channel was launched before the [[FIFA]] Football World Cup 2006. RTL Klub purchased the broadcasting rights of the World Cup but it didn't have enough airing time for all of the matches, and therefore Sport Klub was launched by the parent company to fill in. Now Sport Klub airs various sport activities, such as the German football league, tennis, poker, [[NCAA]], athletics, [[futsal]], box and reruns of the Formula-1 broadcast of the parent channel. It airs certain matches of the English and the Spanish league, however its main competitors, the sports channels ran by the Hungarian public service television [[Magyar TelevÃ­ziÃ³|MTV]], Sport1 and Sport2, have the first pick of the matches they would like to air. To easen up the load on Sport Klub, the parent company also launched the channel SportKlub+, which airs sports events deemed to attract less viewers than the parent channel.

Sport Klub is also available in countries in close proximity to Hungary in which countries IKO also operates, including [[Romania]], [[Poland]], [[Serbia]], [[Croatia]] and [[Slovenia]].

===Reflektor===
Reflektor TV is a spin-off of RTL Klub's celebrity news show which bears the same name. The channel airs a 24 hours news loop of celebrity news.
