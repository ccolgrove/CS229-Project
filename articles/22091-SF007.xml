&lt;tt&gt;'''ncurses'''&lt;/tt&gt; ('''n'''ew '''curses''') is a [[library (computer science)|programming library]] that provides an [[application programming interface|API]] which allows the programmer to write [[text user interface]]s in a terminal-independent manner. It is a toolkit for developing &quot;[[GUI]]-like&quot; [[application software]] that runs under a [[terminal emulator]]. It also optimizes screen changes, in order to reduce the [[Latency (engineering)|latency]] experienced when using remote [[Unix shell|shells]].

==History==
The ''N'' in '''n'''curses comes from the word '''''n'''ew''. This is because ncurses is a [[free software]] emulation (clone) of the System V Release 4.0 (SVr4) &lt;tt&gt;[[curses (programming library)|curses]]&lt;/tt&gt;, which was itself an enhancement over the discontinued classic 4.4 BSD curses.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Raymond&quot;/&gt; The XSI Curses standard issued by [[X/Open]] is explicitly and closely modeled on System V.

===curses===
The first curses library was developed at the University of California at Berkeley, for a [[BSD]] operating system, around 1980 to support a screen-oriented game. It originally used the [[termcap]] library, which was used in other programs, such as the [[vi]] editor.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Raymond&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

    |publisher=Linux Journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The success of the BSD curses library prompted Bell Labs to release an enhanced curses library in their System III and System V Release 1 [[Unix]] systems. This library was more powerful and instead of using termcap, it used [[terminfo]]. However, due to [[AT&amp;T]] policy regarding source-code distribution, this improved curses library did not have much acceptance in the BSD community.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Raymond&quot;/&gt;

===pcurses===
Around 1982, Pavel Curtis started work on a [[freeware]] clone of the Bell Labs curses, named '''pcurses''', which was maintained by various people through 1986.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Dickey&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

===ncurses===
The pcurses library was further improved when Zeyd Ben-Halim took over the development effort in late 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Raymond&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Dickey&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The [[README]] file in ncurses 1.8.1 states &quot;v0.1 July 31, 1992&quot; and &quot;v1.8.1 November 5, 1993&quot;, which agrees with the [http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/NEWS.gz NEWS (changelog) file]&lt;/ref&gt; The new library was released as '''ncurses''' in November 1993, with version 1.8.1 as the first major release. Subsequent work, through version 1.8.8 (1995), was driven by [[Eric S. Raymond]], who added the form and menu libraries written by Juergen Pfeifer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#who_did_it NCURSES - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Who wrote NCURSES?]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1996, it has been maintained by Thomas E. Dickey.&lt;ref name=&quot;ncurses Dickey&quot;/&gt;

Most ncurses calls can be easily ported to the old curses. System V curses implementations can support BSD curses programs with just a [[compiler|recompilation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/hackguide.html#abstract A Hacker's Guide to Ncurses Internals]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a few areas are problematic, such as handling terminal resizing, since no counterpart exists in the old curses.

==Terminal database==
Ncurses can use either [[terminfo]] (with extensible data) or [[termcap]].  Other implementations of [[Curses (programming library)|curses]] generally use [[terminfo]]; a minority use [[termcap]].  Few (mytinfo was an older exception&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

   |date=December 27, 1992
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) use both.

==License==
Ncurses is a part of the [[GNU Project]]. It is one of the few GNU files not distributed under the [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]] or [[GNU Lesser General Public License|LGPL]]; it is distributed under a [[permissive free software licence]], similar to the [[MIT License]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Is it GPL&quot;&gt;[http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#is_it_gpl NCURSES - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Is it GPL'd?]&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the agreement made with the [[Free Software Foundation]] at the time the developers assigned their copyright.

When the agreement was made to pass on the rights to the FSF, there was a clause that stated
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;The Foundation promises that all distribution of the Package, or of any work &quot;based on the Package&quot;, that takes place under the control of the Foundation or its agents or assignees, shall be on terms that explicitly and perpetually permit anyone possessing a copy of the work to which the terms apply, and possessing accurate notice of these terms, to redistribute copies of the work to anyone on the same terms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is it GPL&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to the maintainer Thomas E. Dickey, this precludes relicensing to the GPL in any version, since it would place restrictions on the programs that will be able to link to the libraries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Is it GPL&quot;/&gt;

However, because it is [[Free Software Foundation]] software, they may choose to GPL it in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://invisible-island.net/ncurses/ncurses.faq.html#relicensed NCURSES - Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ): Will it ever be GPL?]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs using ncurses==
There are hundreds of programs which use ncurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

   |title=Projects tagged âncursesâ
   |publisher=ohloh
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some, such as [[GNU Screen]] and [[w3m]], use only the [[termcap]] interface, performing screen management within the application.  Others, such as [[GNU Midnight Commander]] and [[Yet another Setup Tool|YaST]] use the curses programming interface.
