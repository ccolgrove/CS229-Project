'''Dianne Goldman Berman Feinstein''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|f|aÉª|n|s|t|aÉª|n}}; born June 22, 1933) is the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from [[California]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], she has served in the Senate since 1992. She also served as [[Mayor of San Francisco#List|38th]] [[Mayor of San Francisco]] from 1978 to 1988.

Born in [[San Francisco]], Feinstein graduated from [[Stanford University]]. In the 1960s she worked in city government, and in 1970 she was elected to the [[San Francisco Board of Supervisors]]. She served as the board's first female president in 1978, during which time the [[MosconeâMilk assassinations|assassinations]] of Mayor [[George Moscone]] and City Supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] drew national attention to the city. Feinstein, who was the first to discover the shootings, succeeded Moscone as mayor. During her tenure as San Francisco's first female mayor she took a politically moderate stance, leading a revamp of the [[San Francisco cable car system|city's cable car system]] and overseeing the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]].

After a failed gubernatorial campaign in 1990, she won a 1992 special election to the U.S. Senate. Feinstein was first elected on the same ballot as her peer [[Barbara Boxer]], and the two became California's first female U.S. Senators. Feinstein formerly chaired the [[United States Senate Committee on Rules and Administration|Senate Rules Committee]] (2007â2009) and has chaired the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence|Select Committee on Intelligence]] since 2009. She is also the first woman to have presided over a [[Inauguration of Barack Obama#Inaugural events|U.S. presidential inauguration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Feinstein plays key role|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/jan/21/1n21notebook002133-feinstein-plays-key-role/?uniontrib|work=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|date=January 21, 2009|publisher=[[Copley News Service]]|accessdate=2009-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Associated Press]] and [[Agence France-Presse]]|title=Millions witness moment|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking%2BNews/World/Story/STIStory_328905.html|date=January 21, 2009|work=[[The Straits Times]]|location=([[Singapore]])|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She is currently [[Seniority in the United States Senate|twenty-second]] in seniority in the United States Senate.

==Early life==
Feinstein was born '''Dianne Emiel Goldman'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fe |work=Real Names of Famous Folk |url=http://www.famousfolk.com/real/names-f/fe.shtml |accessdate=November 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in San Francisco to Betty (nÃ©e Rosenburg), a former model, and Leon Goldman, a nationally renowned [[surgery|surgeon]]. Feinstein's paternal grandparents were Jewish emigrants from [[Poland]], while her maternal grandparents, who were of the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodox]] faith, left [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], after the 1917 Russian Revolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;background&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Slater|first=Robert|authorlink= |coauthors=Elinor Slater|title=Great Jewish Women|publisher=Jonathan David Publishers|year=2004|location=Middle Village, New York|page=78|month= |url=http://books.google.com/books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother's surname, &quot;Rosenburg&quot;, originates from German ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=OtkjAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22DIANNE+FEINSTEIN%22+ROSENBURG+german&amp;dq=%22DIANNE+FEINSTEIN%22+ROSENBURG+german&amp;hl=en&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Feinstein graduated from [[Convent of the Sacred Heart High School (California)]] in 1951 and from [[Stanford University]] in 1955 with a B.A. in History.

In 1956, she married Jack Berman (died 2002), a colleague in the San Francisco [[District Attorney]]'s office. Feinstein and Berman divorced three years later.  Their daughter, Katherine Feinstein Mariano (b. 1957), is Presiding Judge of the San Francisco Superior Court.&lt;ref name=&quot;KatherineFeinsteinPJ&quot;&gt;

In 1962, shortly after beginning her career in politics, Feinstein married [[neurosurgery|neurosurgeon]] Bertram Feinstein; her second husband died of [[colon cancer]] in 1978.

In 1980, Feinstein married [[Richard C. Blum]], an investment banker. In 2003, Feinstein was ranked the fifth-wealthiest senator, with an estimated net worth of $26 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;millionairespopulatesenate&quot;&gt;{{cite news

==Early political career==
In 1961, Feinstein worked to end housing discrimination in San Francisco.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reputation&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/10/24/MN71927.DTL|title=PAGE ONE{{ndash}} It's Brown vs. Brown Ex-speaker's reputation helps, hinders him|author=Clarence Johnson|date=1995-10-24|accessdate=2008-02-23 | work=The San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to elected service, she was appointed by then-California Governor [[Pat Brown]] to serve as a member of the California Women's Parole Board.  Feinstein also served as a fellow at the [[Coro Foundation]] in San Francisco.

=== President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors ===
In 1969, Feinstein was elected to the [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] Board of Supervisors. She remained on the Board for nine years.

During her tenure on the Board of Supervisors, she unsuccessfully ran for mayor of San Francisco twice, in 1971 against mayor [[Joseph Alioto]], and in 1975, when she lost the contest for a runoff slot (against [[George Moscone]]) by one percentage point, to supervisor [[John Barbagelata]].

She was elected president of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors in 1978 with initial opposition from [[Quentin Kopp]].

On November 27, 1978, San Francisco mayor [[George Moscone]] and supervisor [[Harvey Milk]] were [[Moscone-Milk assassinations|assassinated]] by a rival politician, [[Dan White]], who had resigned from the Board of Supervisors only two weeks prior. Feinstein was close by in City Hall at the time of the shootings, and discovered Milk's body after hearing the gunshots and going to investigate. Later that day at a press conference originally organized by Moscone to announce White's successor, Feinstein announced the [[assassination]]s to the stunned public, stating: &quot;As president of the board of supervisors, it's my duty to make this announcement. Both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;timesofharveymilk&quot;&gt;{{cite web
  |title=The Times of Harvey Milk
  |publisher=Internet Movie Database
  |url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088275/
  |accessdate=2007-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinstein appears in archival footage and is credited in the [[Academy Award]]-winning documentary film ''[[The Times of Harvey Milk]]'' ([[1984 in film|1984]]). She appears again briefly in archival footage, announcing the death of Moscone and Milk in the 2008 film ''[[Milk (film)|Milk]]''. Feinstein and her position as President of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors are also alluded to several times in the movie, and a portrayal of her character has a few off-screen lines.

As president of the Board of Supervisors upon the death of Mayor Moscone, Feinstein succeeded to the mayoralty on December 4, 1978.

=== Mayor of San Francisco ===
{{main|Mayoralty of Dianne Feinstein}}
[[File:Mayor Diane Feinstein Cable Car.jpeg|right|thumb|As mayor of San Francisco, 1978-1988]]
Feinstein served out the remainder of Moscone's term. She made no staffing changes to his team until she was elected in her own right in 1979. She was re-elected in 1983 and served a second full term.

One of the first challenges to face Feinstein as mayor was the state of the [[San Francisco cable car system]]. In late 1979, the system had to be shut down for emergency repairs, and an engineering evaluation concluded that it needed comprehensive rebuilding at a cost of $60 million. Feinstein took charge of the effort, and helped win federal funding for the bulk of the rebuilding job. The system closed for rebuilding in 1982 and reopened in 1984 in time for the [[1984 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] that was held in the city that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;cablecar&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  |publisher=Market Street Railway
  |url=http://www.streetcar.org/mim/spotlight/yesterday/rejuvenation/index.html
  |accessdate=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Feinstein also oversaw planning policies to increase the number of high rise buildings in San Francisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.citymayors.com/mayors/sanfrancisco_mayor.html |title=Gavin Newsom Mayor of San Francisco |author=Andrew Stevens |publisher=[[City Mayors]] |date= |accessdate=2008-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps because of her statewide ambitions, Feinstein was seen as a relatively moderate Democrat in one of the country's most [[Liberalism|liberal]] cities. As a supervisor, she was considered part of the [[centrist]] bloc that included Dan White and was generally opposed to Moscone. As mayor, Feinstein angered the city's large [[gay]] community by refusing to march in a [[gay rights]] parade and by vetoing [[domestic partnership|domestic partner legislation]] in 1983. In the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]], while a majority of Bay Area Democrats continued to support Senator [[Ted Kennedy]]'s [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1980|primary challenge]] to [[President of the United States|President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] even after it was clear Kennedy could not win, Feinstein was a strong supporter of the Carter-[[Walter Mondale|Mondale]] ticket. She was given a high profile speaking role on the opening night of the August [[Democratic National Convention]], urging delegates to reject the Kennedy [[delegate]]s' proposal to &quot;open&quot; the convention, thereby allowing delegates to ignore their states' [[popular vote]], a proposal that was soundly defeated.

In the run up to the [[1984 Democratic National Convention]], there was considerable media and public speculation that Democratic presidential nominee Walter Mondale might pick Feinstein as his running mate. However, he chose [[Geraldine Ferraro]] instead. Also in 1984, Feinstein proposed banning [[handguns]] in San Francisco, and became subject to a recall attempt organized by the [[White Panther Party]]. She won the [[recall election]] and finished her second term as mayor on January 8, 1988.

In 1985, at a press conference, Feinstein revealed details about the hunt for [[serial killer]] [[Richard RamÃ­rez]], and in so doing angered detectives by giving away details of his crimes.&lt;ref name=&quot;nightstalker&quot;&gt;{{cite web

  |publisher=Court TV
  |url=http://www.crimelibrary.com/serial_killers/notorious/ramirez/delays_6.html
  |accessdate=2007-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, ''City and State'' magazine named Feinstein the nation's &quot;Most Effective Mayor.&quot; Feinstein served on the [[Trilateral Commission]] during the 1980s while mayor of San Francisco.

=== Governor's election ===
In 1990, Feinstein made an [[California gubernatorial election, 1990|unsuccessful bid]] for [[Governor of California]].  Although she won the Democratic Party's nomination for the office, she then lost in the general election to Republican Senator [[Pete Wilson]], who vacated his seat in the [[US Senate|Senate]] to assume the governorship. In 1992, she was fined $190,000 for failure to properly report campaign contributions and expenditures associated with that campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;cafppcenforcement&quot;&gt;{{cite web

==U.S. Senate career==
=== Elections ===

{{See also|United States Senate election in California, 2012}}
On November 3, 1992, Feinstein won a special election to fill the Senate seat vacated a year earlier when Senator [[Pete Wilson]] resigned to become governor. The election was held at the same time as the general election for U.S. President and other offices. [[Barbara Boxer]] was elected at the same time for the Senate seat to be vacated by [[Alan Cranston]]. Because Feinstein was elected to an unexpired term, she became a senator as soon as the election was certified in November while Boxer would not take office until the expiration of Cranston's term in January; thus Feinstein became California's [[Seniority in the United States Senate|senior senator]], even though she was elected at the same time as Barbara Boxer. Feinstein was re-elected in [[United States Senate election in California, 1994|1994]], [[United States Senate election in California, 2000|2000]], and [[United States Senate election in California, 2006|2006]].

[[File:Line for tickets-20090119.jpg|thumb|The line for unclaimed tickets to the [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|inauguration]] outside Feinstein's office]]
As a [[superdelegate]], Feinstein had declared that she would support [[Hillary Clinton]] for the Democratic presidential nomination. However, once [[Barack Obama]] became the presumptive nominee for the party, she fully backed his candidacy. Days after Obama amassed enough delegates to win the Democratic Party nomination, Feinstein lent her Washington, D.C. home to both Clinton and Obama to have a private one-on-one meeting.{{Dead link|date=September 2008}}&lt;ref name=&quot;superdelegate&quot;&gt;

Feinstein did not attend the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]] in [[Denver]] because she fell and broke her ankle.&lt;ref name=&quot;ankle&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/08/19/feinstein-breaks-ankle-cancels-convention-trip/|title=Feinstein Brakes Ankle, Cancels Convention Trip|date=2008-08-19|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2008-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She chaired the [[United States Congress Joint Committee on Inaugural Ceremonies]], and acted as mistress of ceremonies, introducing each participant at the [[Barack Obama 2009 presidential inauguration|2009 presidential inauguration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Davies, Frank|title=Obama warns of tough times, promises 'new era of responsibility'|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/ci_11505401|date=January 20, 2009|publisher=San Jose Mercury News|accessdate=2009-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feinstein voted for the extension of the PATRIOT ACT, and the FISA provisions.

Feinstein co-sponsored (along with [[Tom Coburn]], an Oklahoman Republican) an amendment through the Senate to the 'Economic Development Revitalization Act of 2011' that eliminated the 'Volumetric Ethanol Excise Tax Credit'. The Senate passed the amendment on June 16, 2011. Introduced in 2004, the subsidy provided a 45c per gallon credit on pure ethanol and a 54c per gallon tariff on imported ethanol. These subsidies had resulted in an annual expenditure of $6 billion, the removal of which will help to quash the escalating US debt crisis.

==2010 Gubernatorial election==
Feinstein had been reported as considering a run for [[Governor of California]] in [[California gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]] to replace [[term limits|term limited]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]. A private poll in July 2008 showed Feinstein far outpacing former governor [[Jerry Brown]], 50 percent to 24 percent, with Congressman [[John Garamendi]] at 10 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2008/08/29/MN6Q12K52Q.DTL | title=Feinstein considers run for governor in 2010 | accessdate=4 December 2008 | last=Coile | first=Zachary | date=29 August 2008 | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A February 2009 poll showed that 36 percent of Democrats sampled in the poll said they would support Feinstein if she ran for governor.
