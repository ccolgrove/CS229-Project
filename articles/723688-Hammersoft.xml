The '''Canada men's national soccer team''' represents [[Canada]] in international [[soccer]] competitions at the senior men's level. They are overseen by the [[Canadian Soccer Association]] and compete in the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football ([[CONCACAF]]).

Their most significant achievements are winning the [[1985 CONCACAF Championship]] to qualify for the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]] and winning the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] to qualify for the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup]]. Canada also won a gold medal in the [[Football at the 1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Summer Olympics]].

==History==
===Early years===
Soccer was being played in Canada with the '''Dominion Football Association''' (1877) and [[Western Football Association]] (1880) acting as precursors to the modern-day [[Canadian Soccer Association]]. In 1885, the WFA sent a representative team to [[New Jersey]] to take on a side put forth by the [[American Football Association]], the then-unofficial governing body of the sport in the [[United States]]. In an unofficial friendly, Canada defeated their hosts 1â0 in [[East Newark, New Jersey|East Newark]], New Jersey. The American team won 3â2 in a return match one year later. In 1888, a team represented the WFA in a tour of the British Isles, earning a record of nine wins, five draws, and nine losses. The squad comprised 16 Canadian-born players with the only exception being tour organizer [[David Forsyth (soccer)|David Forsyth]], who had immigrated to Canada one year after his birth.&lt;ref name=history&gt;[http://www.canadasoccer.com/eng/history/index.asp?sub2=14 &quot;History of Soccer in Canada&quot;]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 [[Galt Football Club]] represented the WFA at the [[Olympic Games]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St Louis]], [[Missouri]]. As just one of three teams competing, Galt defeated two American clubs, [[Christian Brothers College]] (7â0) and [[St. Rose Parish|St. Rose]] (4â0) to win the tournament.  The ''[[Toronto Mail and Empire]]'' of November 18, 1904 reports that &quot;Immediately after the game, the Galt aggregation, numbering about 50 persons, retired to the office of James W. Sullivan, chief of the Department of Physical Culture, where they received their prize.  After a short talk by Mr. James E. Conlon of the Physical Culture Department, Mayor Mundy, of the City of Galt, presented each player on the winning team with a beautiful gold medal.&quot;  The medals are clearly engraved with the name of the company in St. Louis that made them.

In 1905, a British team of touring amateurs nicknamed the &quot;Pilgrims&quot; toured Canada, with their match against Galt billed as the &quot;championship of the world&quot;. The match was played in front of almost 4000 fans in [[Galt, Ontario|Galt]], now part of [[Cambridge, Ontario|Cambridge]], [[Ontario]], and ended in a  3â3 draw. Earlier the Pilgrims had been beaten 2â1 by Berlin Rangers, in the city now known as Kitchener.

The Canadian national team toured [[Australia]] in 1924, playing a series of &quot;test&quot; friendlies against their hosts, including their first official match, a 3â2 friendly defeat to the [[Australian national football team]] in [[Brisbane, Australia|Brisbane]] on June 7, 1924.  In 1925, Canada played their old rivals, the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]], in [[Montreal]], winning 1â0 on [[Ed McLaine (footballer)|Ed McLaine]]'s goal. In a return match in November 1925 in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York]], Canada was defeated 1â5.  One year later, Canada lost 2â6 to the Americans in the same city before playing four internationals in a 1927 tour of [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

===1957 to 1986===
Following the lead of British football associations, Canada withdrew from [[FIFA]] in 1928 over a dispute regarding broken time payments to amateur players. They rejoined the confederation in 1946 and took part in World Cup qualifying in the [[NAFC|North American Football Confederation (NAFC)]] (a precursor to [[CONCACAF]]) for the first time in 1957, the first time they had played as a national team in 30 years.  Under the guidance of head coach [[Don Petrie]], Canada defeated the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] in [[Toronto]] 5â1 in their opening game, but lost two games in [[Mexico]] (failing to play a home game due to financial reasons) 0â2 and 0â3 before defeating the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] 3â2 in [[St. Louis]].  [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] advanced as group winners, meaning that Canada missed out on the [[World Cup 1958|World Cup]] in 1958 in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;

Canada withdrew from World Cup qualifying for [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] and did not enter a team for [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]].  They did compete in soccer however at the [[Football at the 1967 Pan American Games|1967 Pan American Games]], their first time to do so in the sixth edition of the games, which they hosted in [[Winnipeg]].  Canada finished a respectable fourth place, helped somewhat by defending champion Brazil's absence.

A 0â0 draw away to [[Bermuda national football team|Bermuda]] meant the Canadians, under manager [[Peter Dinsdale]], could not advance out of the first round of [[1970 FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying for the 1970 World Cup]]. Dinsdale was replaced by [[Frank Pike (soccer)|Frank Pike]].  In their [[Football at the 1971 Pan American Games|second participation in soccer at the Pan Am games]], held in [[Cali]], Canada did well to finish second in their opening round group (to hosts [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]).  In the final group round however, they managed only one win (over Colombia) and finished next to last.

Canada again failed at the first hurdle in qualifying for the [[1974 World Cup]].  Under German manager [[Eckhard Krautzun]], they finished second in a home and away qualifying group for the [[1973 CONCACAF Championship]] (to Mexico).  For the [[Football at the 1975 Pan American Games|1975 Pan Am Games]], Canada, along with most of the larger Pan Am countries, sent their Olympic team, which was amateur (and senior aged), to compete.  After narrowing qualifying out of the first round, the Canucks were soundly defeated by [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], and Mexico, conceding a total of 14 goals while scoring none.  At the [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]] the following year, under head coach [[Colin Morris (Canadian soccer)|Colin Morris]], Canada failed to get out of the first round, losing both of their games.  This despite the brilliant play of [[Jimmy Douglas (Canadian soccer)|Jimmy Douglas]], who scored a wonder goal against the [[Soviet national football team|U.S.S.R.]] and another goal against [[North Korea national football team|North Korea]], Canada's only two goals for the tournament.

At the [[1977 CONCACAF Championship]], with both group winners and runners-up now advancing, Canada, again under head coach Krautzun, qualified as runners-up after defeating the Americans 3â0 in a neutral site one-match play-off, played in [[Port-au-Prince]].  In the championship, played in [[Monterrey]] and [[Mexico City]], Mexico won all five of their matches with a plus 15 goals difference to win the tournament handily.  Canada finished fourth.

Matters were different however at the next [[1981 CONCACAF Championship|CONCACAF championship]], in 1981, played in [[Tegucigalpa]]. Canada entered the tournament raising eyebrows by winning their qualifying group over Mexico and the States. In tournament play, the Canadians opened strongly with a 1â0 win over [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]], with [[Mike Stojanovic]] the goal-scorer, and a 1â1 tie against Haiti, with Stojanovic scoring again.  They next lost to the hosts [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 1â2 and then drew with Mexico 1â1. A win in their final game against [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]] would have put them through to Spain, but they were held to a 2â2 draw, allowing El Salvador to qualify as tournament runners-up.

1981 through 1985 saw Canada develop under the guidance of English manager [[Tony Waiters]]. So close in 1981, Waiters would see the Maple Leafs through to their first World Cup finals appearance in 1985. A 1â1 away draw to [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]] was key in allowing them to eliminate ''Los Chapines'' in the first round group. The second round was also closely contested, in part as this Canadian squad was strong defensively but had limited ability to score goals.  The Canucks managed to eke out a 1â0 away win over Honduras, thanks to a [[George Pakos]] winner, hold [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] scoreless in [[San JosÃ©, Costa Rica|San JosÃ©]], and then in their final game, one they needed to draw to qualify, beat ''Los Catrachos'' a second time, 2â1 in [[St. John's, Newfoundland and Labrador|St. John's]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]], with Pakos and [[Igor Vrablic]] the goal scorers. The victory not only secured their first World Cup finals berth,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/topics/2273-13478/|title=Canada cracks the World Cup|date=May 30, 1986|publisher=CBC Sports|accessdate=July 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also the crown of CONCACAF champions for the first time, although Mexico did not compete, having already qualified automatically for the World Cup as hosts.

At the [[1986 FIFA World Cup]], Canada impressed defensively in their first game, allowing few chances and conceding a late [[Jean-Pierre Papin]]  goal to lose to [[French national football team|France]] 0â1.  They lost their next two matches to both [[Hungarian national football team|Hungary]] and the [[USSR national football team|USSR]] 0â2, however, to finish at the bottom of their group.

===1990s===
Qualification for [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990]] lasted all of two matches for Canada, a home-and-away series with Guatemala, played in October 1988.  The Central Americans won the first game 1â0 in [[Guatemala City]] while Canada prevailed in [[Vancouver]] 3â2.  Tied on goal difference, ''Los Chapines'' advanced on away goal rule.

1990 saw Canada take part in the first [[North American Nations Cup]], hosting the three-team tournament. [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and Canada sent their full squads, but the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] sent a 'B' team.  Canada won the [[1990 North American Nations Cup|tournament]] after a 1â0 win over the [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] on May 6 and a 2â1 win over [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] on May 13.  All three Canadian goals were scored by [[John Catliff]], the tournament's top scorer.

Canada came close to qualifying for the World Cup again in [[1994 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|1994]] under the guidance of a defender on the 1986 team, [[Bob Lenarduzzi]].  They entered the tournament at the second round stage and advanced as group runners-up. Canada competed strongly in the final qualifying round, drawing their first match in Tegucigalpa after a controversial penalty allowed the Hondurans to tie, winning their next two, over El Salvador and Honduras in Vancouver, losing convincingly at [[Azteca Stadium]], and winning 2â1 in San Salvador.  They went into their final group match against Mexico, in Toronto, needing a win to win the group and thus qualify directly for the World Cup. Canada went up 1â0 on a goal credited to [[Alex Bunbury]] off a corner, but Mexico scored twice in the second half to win, 2â1. The loss meant Canada finished second and advanced to an intercontinental play-off series where they needed to win two rounds to qualify for the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|USA 94 World Cup]]. The Reds went up against [[Oceania Football Confederation]]'s champions [[Australia national football team|Australia]]. Canada won the first leg 2â1 in Edmonton.  Australia led the second leg 2â1 at the end of 90 minutes, sending the tie to [[extra time]]. There was no score in the extra 30 minutes, meaning the series was decided by a [[penalty shootout (association football)|penalty shootout]] which Australia won 4â1 to eliminate Canada from contention. Australia went on to lose 2â1 on aggregate to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], who advanced to the World Cup.

With the World Cup to be played in the U.S., Canada had the opportunity to play a number of high-profile squads in tune-up matches.  The highlight of this set of matchesâplayed against [[Morocco national football team|Morocco]], Brazil, [[Germany national football team|Germany]], [[Spain national football team|Spain]], and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] all within 13 daysâwas Canada holding eventual World Cup champions Brazil to a 1â1 draw at [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]], on 69th minute equalizer by [[Eddy Berdusco]], on Canada's only real scoring chance in the game.  Also memorable were accusations by Dutch players after their match of the Canadians tackling too aggressively for a friendly.

With three countries set to qualify out of CONCACAF for the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]], and with Canada handily winning their second round group over El Salvador, [[Panama national football team|Panama]], and Cuba, expectations were high for a second qualification in 12 years in the spring of 1997.  The Canadians, however, fared miserably, losing their opening game to Mexico 0â4 and the following one to the U.S. 0â3.  At home in their next two matches to El Salvador and Jamaica they could only manage two 0â0 draws as they finished bottom of the group with 6 points from 10 games and a â15 goal difference.  Having overseen two consecutive World Cup campaigns end in the side failing to qualify, Lenarduzzi stepped down in 1997 and was replaced by interim manager [[Bruce Twamley]].

===21st century===
The Canadian Soccer Association turned to another German to lead the senior national team in 1999 with the signing to the post of [[Holger Osieck]].  Success came rather quickly with Canada winning the [[2000 CONCACAF Gold Cup|CONCACAF Gold Cup]] in February 2000.  After emerging from the first round on a coin-toss tiebreaker with invited side [[South Korean national football team|Republic of Korea]], the Canucks scored a quarter-final extra-time upset win over Mexico on [[Richard Hastings]]' [[golden goal]]. The win set the stage for an unprecedented run to the final, where Canada defeated [[Colombian national football team|Colombia]] 2â0 at [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]] in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. Canada swept the awards ceremony, with goalkeeper [[Craig Forrest]] winning MVP honours, [[Carlo Corazzin]] securing the Golden Boot and Hastings named Rookie of the Tournament.

Expectations were again high following the winter's result, but the campaign quickly and thoroughly sputtered, as several had done before. A positive 1â0 away result in [[Havana]] in June was followed by a listless 0â0 home draw against Cuba.  For the semi-final round two out of four teams advanced.  The [[Dwight Yorke]]-led [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] showed in their game against Canada, the opening one for both squads, that they were contenders, defeating ''les Rouges'' 0â2 in [[Edmonton]]. Canada managed just one goal in 6 games while conceding 8 to finish third in the standings, well adrift of advancing sides T&amp;T and Mexico.

Winning the Gold Cup, however, did earn Canada a place in the [[2001 FIFA Confederations Cup|2001 Confederations Cup]], where the highlight was holding [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] to a 0â0 draw. The Gold Cup victory also won them an invitation to compete in the [[Copa AmÃ©rica 2001]]. When security concerns prompted the cancellation of the tournament, Canada disbanded their training camp and Canadian players returned to their club teams. The tournament was then reinstated and held on schedule. The Canadian Soccer Association announced they would not be able to participate in the reinstated tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/tourneys/copa-america.htm |title=Copa America 2001 |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=July 30, 2001|accessdate=January 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canada had another strong showing in the [[2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], losing to the United States in the semi-finals in penalties, and then defeating South Korea in the third-place game, 2â1.  There was a Gold Cup held [[2003 CONCACAF Gold Cup|the following year]] as so as to hold the event in years between the World Cup and the Olympics, and Canada was eliminated in the first round on goal difference.  Head coach Osieck had seen the side progress but was unable to secure the inclusion of Canada's top scorer [[Tomasz Radzinski]] into the squad.  The manager resigned in September 2003 and former player [[Colin Miller (soccer)|Colin Miller]] was put in charge as an interim.

2004 marked the beginning of [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|qualifying for the 2006 World Cup]], and a new era under the guidance of former Canadian skipper [[Frank Yallop]]. He seemed just the man for the job after seeing the [[San Jose Earthquakes]] to two [[Major League Soccer]] championships in three years. Things began brightly, with the Canadians dispatching of [[Belize national football team|Belize]] handily in the Premilinary Round, 8â0 on aggregate, in a home-and-home series. Matters turned, however, just as they had done four years earlier, with Canada finishing bottom in a group featuring Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras. They managed only 5 points from 6 matches and a â4 goal difference.

Hard times continued under Yallop as the Canucks again went out at the first barrier in the [[2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]], losing to both the U.S. and Costa Rica, while defeating Cuba. The manager stayed on through 2005 into the following summer, overseeing a series a friendlies against European sides. He resigned on June 7, 2006 to become head coach of the [[Los Angeles Galaxy]], finishing with a win-lose record of 8â9â3.

Things turned around under interim coach [[Stephen Hart (soccer)|Stephen Hart]]'s guidance. Canada opened their [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup]] campaign with a 2â1 win over Costa Rica. A 1â2 upset loss to upstarts [[Guadeloupe national football team|Guadeloupe]] was followed by a convincing 2â0 victory over Haiti, securing Canada first-place in their group. They next beat Guatemala 3â0 in their quarter-final match setting up a semi-final showdown with the host Americans at [[Soldier Field]].  [[Frankie Hejduk]] scored first in the 39th minute and [[Landon Donovan]] added to the American tally, scoring on a penalty.  Substitute [[Iain Hume]] scored for Canada in the 76th minute. After the United States were reduced to ten men,  Canada pressed for the equalizer but were controversially denied when [[Atiba Hutchinson]]'s stoppage-time goal was incorrectly flagged offside by linesman Ricardo Louisville.

Prior to the Gold Cup, on May 18, 2007, the Canadian Soccer Association announced that former national team player [[Dale Mitchell (soccer)|Dale Mitchell]] would take over as head coach of the senior team after the [[2007 FIFA U-20 World Cup]]. Mitchell had previously served as an assistant coach under coach Frank Yallop. Mitchell was head coach of the [[Canada U-20 men's national soccer team|men's U-20 squad]] at three [[FIFA U-20 World Cup|Under 20 World Cups]]. Following the announcement, Canada's U-20's  went scoreless in the 2007 U-20 World Cup and were eliminated in first round play. 

The team faced criticism for its poor handling of goalkeeper [[Greg Sutton (soccer)|Greg Sutton]], who suffered a concussion during a practice in Miami prior to the start of the Gold Cup in May. Without a doctor accompanying the team, Sutton instead saw a local physician who cleared him to practice, resulting in Sutton suffering post-concussion syndrome. Sutton was lost to his professional club [[Toronto FC]] for nearly a year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Soccer/TorontoFC/2007/09/05/4471229-sun.html]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dale Mitchell (soccer)|Dale Mitchell]] then decided not to call up any Canadian players playing in North America for that summer's friendlies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.thestar.com/sports/article/246466--mitchell-passes-on--stars-for-friendly | location=Toronto | work=The Star | title=Mitchell passes on  stars for friendly | first=Morgan | last=Campbell | date=August 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Mitchell, Canada drew friendlies with [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]] away and against Costa Rica at home, lost 0â2 to [[South Africa national football team|South Africa]] in [[Durban]], had a 1â0 win over [[Martinique national football team|Martinique]], and a 0â2 defeat to [[Estonia national football team|Estonia]] in [[Tallinn]].  Optimism grew however as Canada played well in a 2â3 loss to Brazil, in a match played at [[Qwest Field]]. 

Despite defeating [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines national football team|Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]] 7â1 on aggregate in a second round seriesâthey had had a [[bye (sport)|bye]] in the firstâCanada did not play at the level they had showed at the Gold Cup and were eliminated from [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|qualifying for the 2010 World Cup]].  They conceded an equalizer shortly after scoring the opening goal in a 1â1 draw to [[Jamaica]] at [[BMO Field]], conceded two second half goals in quick succession in a 1â2 home loss to Honduras at [[Saputo Stadium]], and then lost away to Mexico and Honduras.  They finished last in the four-team group with just 2 points from 6 matches.

On March 27, 2009, head coach Dale Mitchell was fired. The president of the Canadian Soccer Association, [[Dominic Maestracci]], said that &quot;[the Canadian Soccer Association is] committed to the future of our menâs national team program. We have made this decision to move the program in a new direction.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Mitchell out as Canadian men's soccer coach |url= http://www.cbc.ca/sports/soccer/story/2009/03/27/sp-canada-mitchell.html |publisher= CBC Sports |date= March 27, 2009  |accessdate=June 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Technical director Stephen Hart was renamed as interim head coach.

On December 9, 2009 [[Stephen Hart (soccer)|Stephen Hart]] was named as Head Coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Stephen Hart named Canadaâs new menâs head coach |url= http://www.canadasoccer.com/news/viewArtical.asp?Press_ID=3904&amp;lang=en |publisher= Canadian Soccer Association |date= December 9, 2009  |accessdate=January 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stadiums==
Soccer-specific stadiums in Canada include [[BMO Field]] in Toronto (home to [[Toronto FC]]) and [[Saputo Stadium]] in Montreal (home to [[Montreal Impact]]) and [[King George V Park]] in St. John's. Canada played its [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2010 World Cup qualification]] home games at BMO Field, Saputo Stadium, and [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)|Commonwealth Stadium]] in Edmonton.

Canada has played all recent home games at [[BMO Field]].
