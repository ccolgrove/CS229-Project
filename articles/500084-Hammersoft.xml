'''University of Maryland Eastern Shore''' ('''UMES''') located on 776 acres (2.5&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) in [[Princess Anne, Maryland]], [[United States]], is part of the [[University System of Maryland]]. UMES is a [[historically black college|historically black university]], as well as an [[Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act|1890 Historically Black Land-Grant University]].

==History==
The school was founded in 1886 by through the offices of the Delaware Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and was known as the '''Delaware Conference Academy'''.  Later UMES came to be called '''Industrial Branch of Morgan State College and Princess Anne Academy'''.  The State of Maryland, in operating its Land-Grant program at the Maryland Agricultural College at College Park, which did not admit African American students, sought to provide a Land-Grant program for African Americans.  In 1919 the state of [[Maryland]] assumed control of the academy and changed its name to '''Eastern Shore Branch of the Maryland Agricultural College'''. In 1948 the name was again changed, this time to '''Maryland State College'''.  Finally, in 1970, the name became University of Maryland of Eastern Shore.

From its original campus building known as &quot;Olney,&quot;
which was constructed in 1798 during the era of President
George Washington, the University has grown to over 745
acres with 32 major buildings and 41 other units.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mht.maryland.gov/nr/NRDetail.aspx?HDID=1485&amp;COUNTY=Somerset&amp;FROM=NRCountyList.aspx?COUNTY=Somerset University of Maryland Eastern Shore, Somerset County], at Maryland Historical Trust&lt;/ref&gt;The
student population has increased to 4,500. Within the last decade, UMES has added 20 degree granting
programs to its academic roster.

==Academics==
The university comprises five schools:
*School of Agricultural and Natural Sciences
*School of Arts and Professions
*School of Business and Technology
*School of Pharmacy and Health Professions
*School of Graduate Studies

Signature undergraduate programs are hotel and restaurant management, fashion merchandising, construction management, professional golf management (sanctioned by the PGA), aviation science and teacher education. Business, criminal justice and biology are the most popular majors. UMES also has a four-year engineering program and a baccalaureate program for training physician assistants.

UMES offers master's degrees in applied computer science, criminology and criminal justice, food and agricultural science, rehabilitation counseling marine-estuarine and environmental science and toxicology. UMES also offers a Master of Education (M.Ed) in career and technology education, special education and counseling. A Master of Arts in teaching (MAT) in art education, agriculture, biology, business, chemistry, English, family and consumer sciences, math, music, social studies or technology education is offered through the Department of Education.

==Student life==
===Athletics===
[[File:Maryland-easternshore.png|thumb|right|Athletics logo]]
UMES was one of the founding members of the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference]] in 1970.  The school left the MEAC in 1979 but rejoined in 1981 and has been a member ever since. The Hawks compete in 15 sports at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] level: seven men's and eight women's.  Previous to 1970, UMES was a member of the [[Central Intercollegiate Athletic Association]].

The school was once a powerhouse in black college [[American football|football]], producing five undefeated seasons between 1947 and 1960, but like many smaller [[colleges]], the high costs associated with operating a Division I football program and complying with [[Title IX]] became too much of a burden, and the team was shut down after the 1979 season. In 1948, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) and [[Albright College]] played the first intercollegiate football game between an Historical Black Colleges and Universities (HBCU) institution and a majority-white institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Vernon &quot;Skip&quot; McCain/UMES Football Reinstatement Fund Second Quarter 2007 Report | url = http://www.umes.edu/football/Second%20Quarter%202007%20VSM%20Fund%20Annual%20Report.doc | accessdate = August 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
NFL player and coach [[Art Shell]] attended UMES.

UMES is tied with [[Florida State University|Florida State]] for the most alumni appearing in a single Super Bowl game. In the 1968 game (Super Bowl III) between the New York Jets and the Baltimore Colts, UMES was represented by five alumni: [[Earl Christy]] (1961â1964), [[Johnny Sample]] (1954â1957), [[Emerson Boozer]] (1962â1965), [[Charlie Stukes]] (1963â1967), and [[Jim Duncan (football player)|James Duncan]] (1968â1971).

UMES women's bowling team won the [[NCAA Bowling Championship]] in 2008 in Omaha, Nebraska against [[Arkansas State University]]. They won the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match). The team was led by All-Tournament players Jessica Worsley (who was named the tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez. With the series win, UMES became the first HBCU to win a women's NCAA national championship.  The UMES women also won their second 2011 NCAA Bowling Championship in Taylor, Michigan against [[Vanderbilt University]], also winning the series 4-2 (in a best of 7 match). Kristina Frahm (named tournament MVP) and Maria Rodriguez were named to the All-Tournament team en route to their victory. That season, along with the NCAA Championship, UMES also won the [[United States Bowling Congress|USBC]] Team Championships over [[Lindenwood University]] as well as the [[Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference|MEAC]] Championship.  In 2007 the women's bowling team came in 2nd at the NCAA National Championship (Orlando, Florida) who fell to Vanderbilt University in a 4-3 series. The team was led by All-Tournament players Marion Singleton and Jessica Worsley. The UMES women's bowling team also won the MEAC Conference Championship in 2000, 2006, 2007, and 2008.

UMES men's basketball is coached by [[Frankie Allen]], who led the Hawks to an 9-22 record in the 2010-2011 season.  The school led the nation in scoring during the 1973-1974 season with 97.6 points per game, including future NBA picks [[Rubin Collins]], [[Talvin Skinner]], William Gordon and [[Joe Pace]].  The team defeated [[Manhattan College]] 84-81 in the first round of the 1974 NIT and fell to [[Jacksonville University]] 85-83 in the quarterfinals.

During the 2010-11 season, UMES had a men's and women's basketball player surpass the 1,000-career point mark.  [[Hillary Haley]] passed the mark on the men's side with a 24-point performance against [[Coppin State University|Coppin State]] on February 19th, including his first season at [[St. Bonaventure University|St. Bonaventure]].  On the women's side, [[Casey Morton]] scored 10 points against [[Savannah State University|Savannah State]] to surpass the mark, finishing with 1,230 in four years with the Lady Hawks.

In 2011, the Hawks men's outdoor track team was ranked third in the Mid-Atlantic Region by the [[U.S. Track &amp; Field and Cross Country Coaches Association]], and subsequently was the highest ranked team in the state of Maryland.

The UMES Women's Volleyball Team won their first MEAC championship in the history of the University in November of 2011 and became eligible to compete in the NCAA tournament against UCLA in December of that same year.
