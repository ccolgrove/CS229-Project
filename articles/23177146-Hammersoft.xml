The '''Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies''' is the continuing education branch of the University of Chicago. The Graham School offers three Master's programs, over 18 certificate programs, and a variety of credit and noncredit courses for graduate students at large, returning scholars, and adult learners. In addition, the Graham School manages the University of Chicago Summer Session, a series of academic programs for high school students, visiting college students, and international students, and conducts lecture series and other programs throughout the year. The Graham School's administrative offices can be found on the University of Chicago's main campus in the Hyde Park neighborhood. Summer Session programs and some courses are also held on the main campus. The majority of Graham School courses are conducted at the University of Chicago Gleacher Center in downtown Chicago.

==History==

Founded alongside the University of Chicago in 1892 as âUniversity Extension,â the University's continuing education division operated in similar fashion to the Chautauqua movement at Oxford and Cambridge, with instructors traveling by train to teach in surrounding communities. The continuing education branch was reformed in 1997 with a $10 million dollar donation from William and Catherine Graham, upon which the name of the division was changed to the William B. and Catherine V. Graham School of General Studies. On July 1, 2011 the school updated its name to the University of Chicago Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies to better reflect its mission as a continuing education institution committed to both professional growth and personal, intellectual enrichment.

==Academics==

Per its vision state, &quot;The Graham School of Continuing Liberal and Professional Studies will be the standard of quality and innovation in continuing education, advancing the University of Chicago's scholarly values and commitment to learning in service to non-traditional students seeking to explore, understand, lead, and improve themselves and the world around them.&quot; To this end, the school lists a wide variety of academic programs encompassing both professional development and liberal education.&lt;ref name=&quot;About the Graham School&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=About the Graham School|url=https://grahamschool.uchicago.edu/php/about/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
