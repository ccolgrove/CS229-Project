The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Dallas Cowboys]] season''' was the 49th season for the team in the [[National Football League]].

It was the last season that the Cowboys played at Texas Stadium; they moved to [[Cowboys Stadium]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;New Stadium&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2695427|title=Cowboys unveil plans for new stadium|accessdate=June 19, 2008|publisher=ESPN|author=ESPN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite entering the last month of the season three games above .500, they failed to make the playoffs, finishing with a 9â7 record.

===Training camp===
{{seealso|Hard Knocks (TV series)}}

The Cowboys arrived in [[Oxnard]], [[California]] for training camp on July 24. [[HBO]] and [[NFL Films]] filmed the Cowboys for the fourth season of ''[[Hard Knocks (TV series)#Dallas Cowboys (2008)|Hard Knocks]]'' which premiered on August 6. The Cowboys began camp with all but three players: [[Felix Jones]], [[Mike Jenkins]], and [[Terry Glenn]]. Jones and Jenkins both signed contracts the next day, and flew out to California to report. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;Jones and Jenkins sign contracts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=5D7A29B0-9C47-3452-911137D37801B6F8|title=Two First-Round Picks Agree To Terms|accessdate=August 1, 2008|publisher=DallasCowboys.com|author=Josh Ellis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon afterward, Terry Glenn was released to waivers. Owner [[Jerry Jones]] explained that, &quot;I think at the end of the day, it had more to do with where we are right now, the managing of how he got to the field, the aspect of concentrating on the what ifs and how it might've impacted how we give our young players a chance, and how we evaluate that position.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Terry Glenn released&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url=http://www.dallascowboys.com/news/news.cfm?id=5D92EA7C-E815-41B1-22DBED7E74DC27A8|title=Glenn Waived; Cowboys Turn to Younger Receivers|accessdate=August 1, 2008|publisher=DallasCowboys.com|author=Rob Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main story lines in camp have revolved around the new addition of [[Adam &quot;Pacman&quot; Jones]], and the injury to Terence Newman. Jones was proving daily in camp that he is still worthy of being named one of the top cornerbacks in the league, but was not fully reinstated to the NFL until August 28. Newman injured his groin on July 28, and is expected to be out for three weeks.
The Cowboys cut the roster from 80 to 75 immediately after training camp, then waived more players following the final pre-season game to drop the roster count to league limit of 53, one of which was 6th-round draft pick Eric Walden. Walden was picked up on waivers by the Kansas City Chiefs. The following players made it through waivers to land spots on the practice squad: Danny Amendola, Alonzo Coleman, Tearrius George, Rodney Hannah, Mike Jefferson, Marcus Dixon and Julius Crosslin. Then, in a surprising turn of events, Dallas CB Evan Ogelsby was released to make room on the roster for Special Teams Ace, Keith Davis who returned to the Cowboys after being cut from the Dolphins.

The Cowboys began their 2008 campaign on the road against the [[Cleveland Browns]].  In the first quarter, Dallas got the first shot as RB [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]] got a 1-yard TD run.  In the second quarter, the Browns would respond with QB [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]] completing a 2-yard TD pass to TE [[Kellen Winslow II|Kellen Winslow]].  Afterwards, the Cowboys responded with QB [[Tony Romo]] completing a 35-yard TD pass to WR [[Terrell Owens]], along with another 1-yard TD run from Barber.  In the third quarter, Dallas pulled away with rookie RB [[Felix Jones]] getting an 11-yard TD run, which was his first carry in the NFL.  In the fourth quarter, Cleveland's only response would be kicker [[Phil Dawson]]'s 34-yard field goal.

Coming off their commanding road win over the Browns, the Cowboys played their Week 2 home opener under the MNF spotlight.  In the last MNF game at [[Texas Stadium]], Dallas would duel with their NFC East foe, the [[Philadelphia Eagles]].  In the first quarter, the Cowboys trailed early as Eagles kicker [[David Akers]] got a 34-yard field goal.  Dallas would answer in their first possession with QB [[Tony Romo]] completing a 72-yard TD pass to WR [[Terrell Owens]].  Philadelphia replied with Akers kicking a 44-yard field goal, yet the 'Boys immediately added to their lead with rookie RB [[Felix Jones]] returning a kickoff 98 yards for a touchdown. The Eagles would take the lead with QB [[Donovan McNabb]] completing a 6-yard TD pass to RB [[Brian Westbrook]], along with LB [[Chris Gocong]] recovering a Romo fumble in the Cowboys' endzone for a touchdown.  Dallas immediately responded with Romo and Owens hooking up with each other again on a 4-yard TD pass. 

On Philadelphia's next drive, the referees made two suspect decisions. The first was a non-call on a very obvious facemask on [[Brian Westbrook]] that would have given the Eagles a first down. The next call in question was a 40 yard passing interference penalty on [[Anthony Henry (American football)|Anthony Henry]]. Replays showed that it was [[Greg Lewis (wide receiver)|Greg Lewis]] who grabbed Henry's jersey and pulled him down, not the other way around. With that decision, the Eagles were awarded a first down on the 1 yard line. Westbrook immediately ran it in for a 1-yard TD. On their next possession, Akers' hit a 22-yard field goal. To make the game the highest scoring half ever on MNF, the Cowboys ended the half with kicker [[Nick Folk]] getting a 51-yard field goal, bringing the total points for both teams to 54. 

In the third quarter, the 'Boys regained the lead with Romo's 17-yard TD pass to RB [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]]. In the fourth quarter, the Eagles once again took the lead with Westbrook's 1-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Cowboys rallied with Folk nailing a 47-yard field goal and Barber getting a 1-yard TD run. The Eagles had a chance for a game winning drive, but Dallas' defense stiffened for the victory, sacking the very elusive McNabb twice.

In a game that had 9 lead changes, it also set different point records, including most first half points in MNF history (54) and most combined points in the rivalry's history (78).

Also, Terrell Owens (3 receptions for 89 yards and 2 touchdowns) reached 132 career touchdown catches, placing him 2nd on the NFL's all-time touchdown receptions list (behind only [[Jerry Rice]]'s record of 197).

Coming off the MNF divisional home win over the Eagles, the Cowboys flew to [[Lambeau Field]] for a Week 3 Sunday Night duel with the [[Green Bay Packers]]. Dallas had never won in [[Lambeau Field]] heading into the game, going 0â5 (although Green Bay did play several home games in Milwaukee where the Cowboys won a few times against the Packers).

In the first quarter, Dallas got the first shot as kicker [[Nick Folk]] got a 25-yard field goal.  The Packers responded with kicker [[Mason Crosby]] getting a 36-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, Green Bay took the lead with Crosby kicking a 38-yard field goal.  The 'Boys replied with rookie RB [[Felix Jones]] getting a 60-yard TD run, becoming the first player in franchise history to have a touchdown in each of his first three games with Dallas.  In the third quarter, the Packers tried to rally as Crosby got a 33-yard field goal, yet the Cowboys responded with RB [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]] getting a 2-yard TD run.  In the fourth quarter, Dallas managed to put the game out of reach as QB [[Tony Romo]] completed a 52-yard TD pass to WR [[Miles Austin]].  Green Bay tried to rally as QB [[Aaron Rodgers]] got a 1-yard TD run, yet the Big D's defense held.

With the win, not only did the Cowboys get a second-straight 3â0 start for the first time since 1976â77, but they also picked up their first-ever win at [[Lambeau Field]].

Coming off their Sunday night road win over the Packers, the Cowboys went home for a Week 4 NFC East showdown with the [[Washington Redskins]].  In the first quarter, the 'Boys shot first as QB [[Tony Romo]] completed a 21-yard TD pass to TE [[Jason Witten]].  In the second quarter, the Redskins took the lead as QB [[Jason Campbell]] completed a 3-yard TD pass to WR [[James Thrash]] and a 2-yard TD pass to WR [[Antwaan Randle El]], along with kicker [[Shaun Suisham]] getting a 20-yard field goal.  Dallas closed out the half with kicker [[Nick Folk]] getting a 36-yard field goal.

In the third quarter, the Cowboys tied the game with Romo completing a 10-yard TD pass to WR [[Terrell Owens]].  Washington would respond with Suisham kicking a 33-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Redskins increased their lead with Suisham nailing a 33-yard and a 29-yard field goal.  The 'Boys tried to rally as Romo completed an 11-yard TD pass to WR [[Miles Austin]].  However, Dallas' onside kick attempt failed, preserving the Redskins' win.

The Cowboys opened the game with a 5-play 71-yard drive that ended on a touchdown reception by rookie tight end [[Martellus Bennett]]. This effort marked the first time the Cowboys scored on their first drive since the last St. Louis game, and the sixth time to do so all season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cowboysblog.dallasnews.com/archives/2008/11/quick-start-for-the-offense.html|title=Quick start for the offense}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the ensuing drive, the Dallas defense forced a Seahawk fumble that was recovered by cornerback [[Anthony Henry (American football)|Anthony Henry]]. Dallas was able to drive deep into Seattle territory, and eventually gave the ball to running back [[Marion Barber III|Marion Barber]] for a 1-yard touchdown run. Following the Dallas drive, the Seahawks had to settle for a 44-yard field goal.

Once the second quarter began, the Cowboys successfully used their passing game to move to the endzone; tight end [[Jason Witten]] scored the touchdown on a 7-yard catch. The touchdown followed by the extra point extended Dallas' lead to 21â3. On the next drive, the Cowboys defense limited the Seahawks offense to a punt. Starting a fresh drive at the Cowboy 20, quarterback [[Tony Romo]] threw a 38-yard strike to [[Roy E. Williams]]. Three consecutive incompletions by Romo led the Cowboys to send in kicker [[Nick Folk]] to hit a 41-yard field goal through the uprights. After an unsuccessful offensive drive by the Seahawks, the Dallas offense returned to the field, though were forced to their first three-and-out. Once Seattle got the ball back, quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] found two of his receivers who both combined for a gain of 47 yards. The Seahawks, however, lost nine of those yards on two quarterback sacks. They had to settle again for another field goal to cut Dallas' lead to 24â6. Both of the team's offenses each had one three-and-out during the 1:31 left in the half. The Cowboys got the ball back, though did not have much time to engineer a successful drive. Romo kneeled to end the half. Overall, Dallas' four scoring drives in the first half consisted of 26 plays, 17 of which occurred on a first down; just three came on third down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldnet.com/article/20081127/SPORTS/811279995|title=Seahawks game a real turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the third quarter commenced, the Seahawks took the time to move the ball deep into the Dallas red zone. They were stopped on third down at the Dallas 7, and elected to go for their third field goal. This drive took 5:23, the longest drive thus far in the game. On Dallas' next possession, cornerback [[Marcus Trufant]] intercepted an endzone pass that was intended for wideout [[Terrell Owens]]. The Seahawks offense was unable to capitalize on the turnover, as they were unable to convert for the first down. Dallas followed with an unsuccessful drive that ended on their second punt of the game. The Seahawks faced their second three-and-out of the quarter on their ensuing possession; their punt led Dallas to field their offense at the Dallas 44. After two plays, Romo threw to Owens for a 33-yard gain. Owens scored a touchdown off a 19-yard catch on the next play, extending the Cowboys' lead to 31â9. Seattle failed again to produce a score during the two minutes left in the third quarter.

Dallas had the ball in possession once the fourth quarter began. The Cowboys gave the ball to rookie running back [[Tashard Choice]] to drain the clock. Choice contributed a total of 62 rushing yards to the drive, including long gain of 27. Despite Choice's help, Dallas had to score a field goal to complete the 6-minute drive. Trailing 34â9, the Seahawks still aimed to score a touchdown. Their effort was cut short when Cowboys cornerback [[Terrence Newman]] compiled an interception at the Dallas 2 on the Seahawks' third play of the drive. With 7:51 remaining in the game, Dallas was not able to convert for the first down and punted the ball, which the Seahawks retrieved at their 43. During the final six minutes of the game, the Seahawks pulled another three-and-out. Dallas then continued to run out the clock but had to give the ball back to Seattle. The Seahawks still had a chance to score in the final two minutes, but fell short again. The Cowboys won 34â9.

Linebacker [[DeMarcus Ware]] finished with 4 tackles and 3 sacks, which earned him the [[NFL on Fox]]'s 2008 [[Thanksgiving Classic#Game MVPs|Galloping Gobbler Award]].
