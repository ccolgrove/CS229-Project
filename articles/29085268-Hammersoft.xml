'''WYDR''' (94.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) is a [[radio station]] broadcasting a [[Classic Hits]] music format simulcasting co-owned [[WZDR]]..,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arbitron.com |date=Spring 2010 |title=Station Information Profile |publisher=[[Arbitron]] |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; licensed to both [[Neenah, Wisconsin|Neenah]] and [[Menasha, Wisconsin|Menasha]] (giving it and sister station [[WNCY-FM]] a rare dual [[city of license|cities of license]] situation) and transmitting from [[High Cliff State Park]] in Northwestern [[Calumet County, Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/fcc-bin/fmq?call=WYDR |title=WYDR Facility Record |work=United States [[Federal Communications Commission]], audio division |accessdate=2010-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;The Drive&quot; has its studios at Midwest Communications' facilities at 1420 Bellevue St in the Green Bay suburb of [[Bellevue, Wisconsin]], adjacent to the tower site of sister station [[WNFL]].

== History ==
The station that would eventually become WYDR was launched by Midwest Communications in 1971 under the [[call sign]] of WROE with a [[beautiful music]] format, a format found quite frequently on FM radio in that era.  In 1977, Midwest bought WBAY-AM and WBAY-FM (the current [[WTAQ]] and [[WIXX]], respectively), forcing the company to sell WROE due to [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] regulations limiting station ownership at the time.  Later ownership would change WROE in the 1980s to the [[Adult Contemporary|soft AC]] format that many people would associate with the frequency and its call sign.

In 1997, Midwest repurchased WROE and sister stations [[WNCY-FM]] and [[WNFL]] after loosening of radio ownership rules the year before.  From 1998 to 2001, WROE simulcast on sister station WLTM, with the stations branded as &quot;The Lite FM, 94.3 and 99.7.&quot;  During this time, WROE and WLTM would add [[Delilah|Delilah's]] nationally syndicated program (though it would eventually drop it later in the 2000s).  When WLTM dropped away from the simulcast in 2001 and launched its own format, WROE reverted back to using its [[call sign]] for on-air branding.

In March 2006, WROE made a shift toward an [[adult hits]] format, branded as &quot;94.3 The Bridge.&quot;  On November 14, 2008, the station dropped &quot;The Bridge&quot; and reverted back to its WROE branding and [[Soft AC]] format.  In August 2009, the station rejoined in a simulcast with 99.7 FM and its Green Bay translator at 101.9 FM, which dropped its own adult hits format.  WROE and WRQE would eventually add the [[John Tesh]] nightly radio program after the show's former home in the Fox Cities, [[WCHK-FM|WECB]], changed formats at the end of 2009.

At 5PM on September 3, 2010, Midwest Communications dropped the Soft AC format a second time, and with it WROE's longtime [[call sign]].  The stations became WYDR (94.3) and WZDR (99.7) and adopted a [[classic hits]]/[[classic rock]] hybrid format as &quot;The Drive,&quot; a format similar to that of [[WDRV]] in [[Chicago]] and sister station WOZZ, which adopted a more [[mainstream rock]] format at the same time and date as &quot;The Drive's&quot; debut (and using 99.7's former [[WRQE]] call sign).
