'''Michael 'Mick' Bermingham''' is a famous [[Irish people|Irish]] sportsperson. He played [[hurling]] for the [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Kilmacud Crokes]] club from 1951 until 1983 and was a member of the [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] senior inter-county team. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest players never to have won an [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] medal.

Mick was selected on the Rest of Ireland Team in 1965. This was like the fore-runner to the [[GAA All Stars Awards|All Stars]], a team sponsored by the now defunct âGaelic Weeklyâ. In 1971 he was selected at right-corner-forward in the first ever [[GAA All Stars Awards|All Stars]] team, Dublinâs first [[GAA All Stars Awards|All Star]], having finished the season as one of the top scorers. In 1984 he was named on the Centenary Team of players who hadnât won [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|All-Ireland]] honours. He was in good company with the likes of  Seanie Duggan, Josie Gallagher, Joe Salmon of Galway, Jimmy Smith, âGogglesâ Doyle of Clare, Wexfordâs Colm Doran and Martin Quigley, Kevin Armstrong of Antrim and Westmeathâs âJobberâ McGrath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilmacudcrokes-hurling.com/History/Personalities/MickBerminghamDublinsFirstAllstar/tabid/898/Default.aspx|title=Mick Bermingham, Dublin Hurling Legend|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playing career==
===Club===
Mick won ten club championships, seven of which while playing in New York between 1965 and 1974. He won two [[Dublin Senior Hurling Championship]]s in 1973 and 1975 and an [[Dublin Intermediate Hurling Championship|Intermediate Championship]] in 1982.

Mick played his first game for [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Kilmacud Crokes]] in 1951 and, with a few interruptions, continued to play for the club until 1983, when business pressures put him off the panel. As a juvenile, Mick played in many memorable games, at all ages. He was particularly proud to have played in the first ever Under 13 Juvenile Championships (beaten in the Irish Press Shield final). During the early 1950s he played [[Scoil UÃ­ Chonaill]] in the Under 15 Final. He also played on the Under 16Â½ team that won the championship in 1955.

There was a temporary split in the club in the early 1960s, which resulted in the formation of Dalcassians. Many younger [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Crokes]] players left to join the new club and even won a Minor Championship, captained by Mick, in 1960. Differences had been resolved by 1962 and in 1963, with forces joined afresh, a team (boasting a substantial majority of [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Crokes]] players) representing the Junior Hurling Board won the Senior Championship and the Intermediate Championship was also won by [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Crokes]] that year.

One of the biggest influences on Mick was the great John Howard. John Howard was also one of the reasons Mick didnât opt to play for [[Faughs]], despite the fact that his father Ned was a committed [[Faughs]] supporter and his cousin Mick Gill was a star of the team in the 1930s and 1940s. [[Faughs]] didnât have a juvenile team and, as the young [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Crokes]] stars developed and bonded under the guidance of John Howard, there was every incentive to stay put.

Mick continues to be involved in [[Kilmacud Crokes GAA|Crokes]] and was part of the Senior Team Management until 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kilmacudcrokes-hurling.com/History/Personalities/MickBerminghamDublinsFirstAllstar/tabid/898/Default.aspx|title=Mick Bermingham, Dublin Hurling Legend|accessdate=2010-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inter-county===
In 1961, [[Dublin GAA|Dublin]] beat [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] 7-5 to 4-8 in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship|Leinster Final]] and went on to play [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] in the [[1961 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|All-Ireland Final]] where they were narrowly beaten 0-16 to 1-12. However, due to injury, Mick did not get to play in either game.

===Inter-provincial===
Mick won six [[Railway Cup]] medals with [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]], these include a double (1964â65) and a four in a row (1971â74).
