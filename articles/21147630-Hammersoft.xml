The '''Florida Gators women's basketball''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[basketball]].  The Gators compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  The Gators play their home games at the [[O'Connell Center]] located on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Amanda Butler]].

== History ==

Women's basketball was approved as a sport by University of Florida in March 1972, and began play in 1973 as a club team.  In 1975, the Gators debuted as a varsity program under head coach Paula Welch.  They made local headlines in 1976 by winning the &quot;state championship&quot; by beating the other three women's teams in the state at that time.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatorzone.com/basketball/women/media/2006/pdf/history/florida.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While historically overshadowed by divisional (and national) basketball powers Tennessee and Georgia, the Gators have made several [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances and sent players to the WNBA, such as [[DeLisha Milton-Jones]].  The winningest coach at Florida is Carol Ross, who guided the team for twelve seasons but left Florida to coach the women's basketball team at her alma mater, [[University of Mississippi|Ole Miss]].

Florida's women's team was coached by [[Carolyn Peck]], a former [[WNBA]] coach who won a national title with [[Purdue Boilermakers|Purdue]], from 2002 to 2007.  Peck was fired midway through the 2006&amp;ndash;2007 season (though she was allowed to finish out the season), after enduring the worst losing streak of any Gator sports program.

Former University of Florida player and previous [[Charlotte 49ers|Charlotte]] coach [[Amanda Butler]] was named the new women's basketball coach on April 13, 2007.
