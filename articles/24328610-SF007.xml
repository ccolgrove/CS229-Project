In contrast, a [[free_software|free format]] is a format that is either not recognized as [[intellectual property]], or has had all claimants to its intellectual property release claims of ownership.  Proprietary formats can be either [[open format|open]] if they are published, or closed, if they are considered trade secrets.  In contrast, a [[free_software|free format]] is never closed.  

Proprietary formats are typically controlled by a private person or organization for the benefit of its applications, protected with [[patent]]s or as [[trade secret]]s, and intended to give the license holder exclusive control of the technology to the (current or future) exclusion of others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proprietary |title=Mirriam-Webster's Online Dictionary |accessdate=2008-07-11 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Typically such restrictions attempt to prevent [[reverse engineering]], though reverse engineering of file formats for the purposes of [[interoperability]] is generally believed to be legal by those who practice it. Legal positions differ according to each country's laws related to, among other things, [[software patent]]s.

==Privacy, ownership, risk and freedom== 
One of the contentious issues surrounding the use of proprietary formats is that of ownership of created content.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} If the information is stored in a way which the user's software provider tries to keep secret, the user may ''own'' the information by virtue of having created it, but they have no way to retrieve it except by using a version of the original software which produced the file. Without a standard file format or [[reverse engineered]] converters, users cannot share data with people using competing software. The fact that the user depends on a particular brand of software to retrieve the information stored in a proprietary format files increases barriers of entry for competing software and may contribute to [[vendor lock-in]] concept.

The issue of risk comes about because proprietary formats are less likely to be publicly documented and therefore less future proof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/sustain/sustain.shtml#disclosure |title=&quot;Sustainability&quot; Digital Preservation |accessdate=2008-07-08 |author= |date= |work= |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the software firm owning right to that format stops making software which can read it then those who had used the format in the past may lose all information in those files. This is particularly common with formats that were not widely adopted. However, even ubiquitous formats such as [[Microsoft Word]] can not be fully reverse-engineered.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}
