'''STUX''' is a [[Live CD]] [[Linux distribution]] based on [[Slackware]].

== Features ==

STUX is a bootable CD with a collection of software, automatic hardware detection, and support for many graphics cards, sound cards, SCSI and USB devices and other peripherals.

STUX also contains an installation wizard on the Live CD for putting the distro on a [[pen drive]] and thereby booting from it.  However, a 1GB pen drive is required to do this which is far larger than other USB Linux distributions.
