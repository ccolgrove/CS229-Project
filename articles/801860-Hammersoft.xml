He has illustrated numerous books - specializing in illustrations of animals and children's books, most notably the second and third book in the [[Harry Potter]] series - ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'' and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]'', and ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]''. 

He has also been an artist in advertising campaigns for numerous large organizations and corporations - including [[Greenpeace]] and [[Ikea]]. He has illustrated the ''Puppy'' series of [[board book]]s by [[Gerald Durrell]], commissioned by the [[Beanie Baby]] manufacturer [[Andrex]]. He has designed numerous posters and cards, and is noted for his illustrations of [[bear]]s and [[badger]]s for children.

Wright is an active campaigner for animal rights with [[International Animal Rescue]], and has participated in numerous book signings and auctions to raise money to help the [[dancing bear]]s of [[India]].

==Early career==
Wright was born in [[Brighton]], England in 1963, and still lives there. He graduated from the [[Brighton College of Art]] in 1986. Wright developed wildlife-based watercolours and children's book ideas in the early phase of his career. In 1989, he published the self-written and illustrated picture book for children titled &quot;When the World Sleeps&quot; ([[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]]). This was runner-up in the [[Mother Goose Award]] competition, 1989-1990. He followed this up by two more highly successful illustration projects - ''&quot;Crumbs!&quot;'' ([[Hutchinson (publisher)|Hutchinson]], 1990) and ''The Tanglewood Troll'' ([[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]], 1993).

==Harry Potter illustrations==
[[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] approached Cliff Wright for illustrating the British [[First edition]] cover for the second [[Harry Potter]] book. The cover illustration for the first book was drawn by [[Thomas Taylor (illustrator)|Thomas Taylor]], a young artist out of college. The popularity of the first book decided Bloomsbury to select a more experienced illustrator, and hence Cliff Wright was chosen. Wright was the obvious choice for the cover illustrator of the third Harry Potter book as well.

Wright was the first to illustrate the following Harry Potter concepts and characters:

''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' (1998):
*[[Hedwig (Harry Potter)|Hedwig]] the Owl
*[[Weasley]]s' [[Ford Anglia]]
*[[Hogwarts]] School of Witchcraft and Wizardry

''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'' (1999):
*The [[Hippogriff]] [[Buckbeak]]
*[[Sirius Black]] in his dog-form

Wright retains the rights to the illustrations. He refused to illustrate the [[Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire|fourth Harry Potter book]] after Bloomsbury lost his original front and back cover artwork for ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban''. The huge black market of the [[Harry Potter fandom]] has been rumoured to be the cause of the disappearance. He also sued [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] for offering insufficient compensation.

The original artwork for the second book ''Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets'' went on auction at [[Christie's]] in 2001 but was unsuccessful at meeting the reserve price of Â£ 30,000. The work has since been acquired by investor [[Luke Heron]] on behalf of illustration investment company Storyboard Assets Plc for an undisclosed sum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thescotsman.scotsman.com/business/-Picture-perfect--.4625919.jp] Scotsman - Picture Perfect Storyboard Draws on its Assets&lt;/ref&gt; The original art for the first book raised Â£ 85,000 at auction.

==Post-Harry Potter work==
Cliff Wright conducts an innovative drawing workshop annually, titled ''The Art of Seeing''. Wright has illustrated numerous books for the publishing houses of [[Ladybird Books]] and [[Oxford University Press]], in the 1990s and 2000s. He has also written and illustrated the &quot;Little Bear&quot; series of [[board books]] from ''Templar Publishing''.
