'''George Wilfred ('Wilf') Proudfoot''' (born 19 December 1921) is a retired [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] politician and former [[Member of Parliament]] (MP). He was also a prominent North Yorkshire businessman, well known for his ownership of the Proudfoot supermarket chain and [[Radio 270]]. In later life he embarked on a new career as a [[hypnotist]] and [[hypnotherapist]].

==Early life==

Proudfoot was born in [[Crook]], [[County Durham]] where his father was manager of the local Broughâs grocery shop. Broughâs was a family-owned retail chain serving Northern England. It was a British pioneer of the [[Piggly Wiggly|self-service]] model whereby customers took goods from open shelves and paid for them at a check-out desk rather than being served at a counter. Proudfoot (senior) held a temporary commission and had won the [[Military Cross]] while serving in the British army during the first world war. The older Proudfoot had political ambitions but these were restrained by Broughâs who refused to allow him to stand as a Conservative candidate in local council elections.

In his early years, Proudfoot helped his father in the shop by performing tasks such as filling blue bags with sugar. During the 1930s Crook experienced a level of unemployment approaching 40% and Proudfoot became familiar with the problems of retailing in a poor community.  He was educated at a local council primary school but failed the [[11 plus]] examination in spite of sitting it one year late after being âheld backâ a year. Subsequently, at age 14, he was sent to stay with two maiden aunts who ran a boarding house in Scarborough where he attended [[Scarborough College]], an independent school. After gaining the school certificate Proudfoot joined a [[Durham]] accounting practice as a trainee.

In 1940 Proudfoot was conscripted into the [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF). After a mixed career in the RAF, Proudfoot was commissioned and served in the education branch where he was responsible for providing basic instruction in English, mathematics and technical skills to new recruits, many of whom came from an educationally disadvantaged background. As a Training Instructor he ââ¦ taught hundreds of conscripts stuff they werenât really bothered about. He took it as a challenge to interest them and keep them entertained â an achievement he still remembers with prideâ - from the Proudfoot School of Hypnosis website.&lt;ref&gt;Introducing Wilf Proudfoot :[http://www.proudfoothypnosis.com/theschool.htm bio]&lt;/ref&gt;

After leaving the RAF in 1946, Proudfoot invested Â£1,750 from his RAF gratuity in buying a former foundry building in the village of [[Seamer, Scarborough|Seamer]] near Scarborough and fitting it out as a supermarket . He developed the business using the self service and high volume/low price model that he had observed at Broughâs in the 1930s. In 1954 he was able to open a second branch at [[Eastfield, North Yorkshire|Eastfield]] and by the 1960s the business had grown into a chain of 6 shops around [[North Yorkshire]]. Proudfoot acquired a large family house in Scalby Road, Scarborough and established his business headquarters in an annex of it. In 1964 he bought himself a villa in Spain for use as a holiday home.&lt;ref&gt;Trance-formations :[http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/features/3922588.Trance_formations/ Northern Echo, November 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

Control of the Proudfoot Supermarkets business eventually passed to Proudfootâs sons with Mark and Ian Proudfoot acting as managing directors. By 2008 some shops in the chain had been sold off (ââ¦ the massive boys made us offers we simply couldnât refuseâ), leaving the three at Seamer, Eastfield and [[Scalby, North Yorkshire|Scalby]] still in Proudfoot ownership.

==Political career==

In 1950 Proudfoot became the youngest member of Scarborough Borough Council when he was elected as a councillor for the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]. He soon became a prominent local politician although his informal personal style did not always endear him to some people. He was once asked to leave the Scarborough Conservative Club when he entered it wearing jeans and a cardigan.

Proudfoot stood unsuccessfully for [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] in [[Hemsworth (UK Parliament constituency)|Hemsworth]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 general election]] and in [[Cleveland (UK Parliament constituency)|Cleveland]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1955|1955 election]].

He was successful on his third attempt, winning the Cleveland seat from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] MP [[Arthur Palmer (politician)|Arthur Palmer]] at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1959|1959 general election]].  However, at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 election]], he was defeated by the Labour candidate [[James Tinn]].&lt;ref&gt;1964 general election :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge64/i06.htm results]&lt;/ref&gt; Proudfoot contested the seat again at the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]], but lost by a much wider margin.&lt;ref&gt;1966 general election :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge66/i06.htm results]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[United Kingdom general election, 1970|1970 general election]], he stood in the marginal [[West Yorkshire]] constituency of [[Brighouse and Spenborough (UK Parliament constituency)|Brighouse and Spenborough]], where he ousted the sitting Labour MP [[Colin Jackson (UK politician)|Colin Jackson]] by a majority of only 59 votes.&lt;ref&gt;1970 general election :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge70/i04.htm results]&lt;/ref&gt; However, at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]], Jackson won back the seat.  Proudfoot stood again at the [[United Kingdom general election, October 1974|October 1974 election]], but lost again.&lt;ref&gt;October 1974 general election :[http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge74b/i04.htm results]&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout his two terms in Parliament, Proudfoot was particularly vocal on matters relating to the retail sector. During his first term (1959 to 1964) he was an early advocate of decimal coinage and opposed the use of [[trading stamps]]. He supported capital punishment whenever that was debated. Proudfoot never held ministerial office although he served as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] to Sir [[Keith Joseph]] (minister of housing and local government) between 1961 and 1963. During his second term (1970 to 1974) he was very vocal on the subject of commercial radio while legislation to allow it was being enacted. Fellow MPs gave him the nickname &quot;Radio Proudfoot&quot;. In 1970 he engaged as his secretary one [[Christine Hamilton|Christine Holman]], who was later to marry the politician [[Neil Hamilton (politician)|Neil Hamilton]] and become famous under her married name.

==Radio 270==

In 1965 a group of local businessmen formed a consortium to promote a new [[Pirate radio in Europe|pirate radio]] station to serve the North East coast from a ship to be anchored off Scarborough. After reading about this venture in a local newspaper, Proudfoot joined it and soon became its managing director. He was credited with putting the venture on a sound business footing.&lt;ref&gt;Radio 270 :[http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/270.htm history]&lt;/ref&gt;

He established the business as a limited company (Ellambar Investments Ltd) and attracted a large number of investors after addressing a public meeting at a Scarborough hotel.&lt;ref&gt;Radio 270 :[http://www.cwgsy.net/private%2Foffshorepirateradio/rad270.html corporate details]&lt;/ref&gt; He warned investors that the venture was a high risk one and they should not expect a commercial return. Proudfootâs immediate influence on programming was to drop a plan to broadcast a mixture of light music and lifestyle material in favour of a simple Top 40 format. A 30 year old, 150 tonne fishing vessel named Ocean 7 was acquired and fitted out with a 10&amp;nbsp;kW radio transmitter for a total cost of Â£75,000. The radio station was named [[Radio 270]] and it was run from Proudfootâs business headquarters in Scalby Road, Scarborough. Ocean 7 was registered in Honduras in the name of Radio 270's programme director Noel Miller (an Australian national).

The station broadcast from June 1966 until August 1967. Although it attracted a large body of regular listeners (up to 4 million was claimed) its affairs were controversial. One issue was that Ocean 7 was too small to operate comfortably off the exposed North East coast. By way of comparison with Radio 270's operation, [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]] (&quot;the Big L&quot;) broadcast from the 650 tonne [[MV Galaxy (radio ship)|MV Galaxy]] in the sheltered Thames estuary. After Ocean 7 nearly sank in a winter storm, several of the shipâs crew and [[disc jockey]]s threatened to mutiny. There were ongoing arguments concerning the safety of the ship, terms of employment and financial policy.  Proudfoot resolved disputes with company officers, staff and fellow investors by dismissing those concerned. He also gave airtime to political causes, such as support for the white minority regimes in [[Rhodesia]] and [[South Africa]] being voiced by Conservative MP [[Patrick Wall]].

:âThe story of the station reads like a soap opera with staff mutinies, beleaguered DJs, technical nightmares, and power strugglesâ - BBC history of Radio 270&lt;ref&gt;BBC :[http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/yorkslincs/series1/pirate-radio.shtml Radio 270]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the [[Marine Broadcasting Offences Act]] of 1967 brought about an early end to Radio 270, its brief life served to raise Proudfootâs public profile considerably and this may have contributed to his return to Parliament in 1970. Some of its employees such as [[Roger Gale]], [[Paul Burnett]] and [[Philip Hayton]] went on to have distinguished careers in mainstream broadcasting. Maggie Lucas, the station's office manager later became secretary to the Chairman of the [[Australian Broadcasting Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;Radio 270 :[http://www.offshoreradio.co.uk/270b.htm history-2]&lt;/ref&gt; It has been claimed that Radio 270 formed the factual basis for the 2009 film &quot;[[The Boat That Rocked]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Yorkshire Post :[http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/features/The-boat-that-really-rocked.5127953.jp film review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypnotist==

After leaving Parliament in 1974, Proudfoot became a regular visitor to the US where he developed an interest in hypnotism.

:âStarting in 1977 he spent many months in America acquiring his Hypnosis and Therapeutic skills at the Hypnotism Training Institute of Los Angeles with Gil Boyneâ â from the Proudfoot School website

In a 2008 newspaper interview Proudfoot also stated that he had been given a [[facelift]] operation in Beverly Hills in 1977. He has lectured on hypnotism and hypnotherapy at venues around the world including ones in Spain, the US and the UK. He has established the Proudfoot School of Clinical Hypnosis and Psycotherapy based in Scarborough where training courses in various aspects of hypnotism are delivered.&lt;ref&gt;The Proudfoot School : [http://www.proudfoothypnosis.com/ website]&lt;/ref&gt;
