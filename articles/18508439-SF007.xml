'''remastersys''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source]] program
for [[Debian]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]-based, or derivative software systems that can:
* Create a customized Live CD/DVD (a [[Software remastering|remaster]]) of [[Debian]] and its derivatives.
* Back up an entire system, including user data, to an installable [[Live CD|Live CD/DVD]].

After a brief period of stopping development it has been made active again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remastersys.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It was initially created to be able to easily back up or create a distributable copy of an Ubuntu or derivative installation.  Inspiration for this tool came from the &lt;tt&gt;[[mklivecd]]&lt;/tt&gt; script that Mandriva uses and the &lt;tt&gt;remasterme&lt;/tt&gt; script that is in PCLinuxOS. Since those scripts were not very easy to port to Ubuntu, it was written from scratch.

==Uses==
remastersys is intended to serve as an easy way to create a customized Live CD/DVD version of Ubuntu. The resulting [[ISO image|iso]] can also be installed on a USB pendrive, creating a [[Live USB]] distro, using either a command-line approach&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Ubuntu 8.04 USB Hard Drive install|url=http://www.pendrivelinux.com/2008/04/14/ubuntu-804-usb-hard-drive-install/|publisher=pendrivelinux.com|accessdate=2008-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a graphical tool such as [[UNetbootin]].

It has a command line version and a [[GUI]] version.
