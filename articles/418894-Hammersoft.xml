'''''Stargate Atlantis''''' (often abbreviated '''''SGA''''') is a [[Canada|Canadian]]-[[United States|American]] [[Adventure film|adventure]] and [[military science fiction]] [[television series]] and part of [[MGM]]'s [[Stargate|''Stargate'' franchise]]. The show was created by [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] as a [[spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', which was created by Wright and [[Jonathan Glassner]] and was itself based on the feature film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' (1994). The first three seasons of ''Stargate Atlantis'' were broadcast by [[Syfy|The Sci-Fi Channel]] and [[The Movie Network]], while the final two seasons aired exclusively on Sci-Fi. The show premiered on July 16, 2004; its final episode aired on January 9, 2009. The series was filmed in and around [[Vancouver]], [[British Columbia]], Canada.

The story of ''Stargate Atlantis'' follows the events of ''Stargate SG-1's'' seventh [[season finale]] episode &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, in which the cast of that series discovered an Antarctic outpost created by the alien race known as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]]. In the pilot episode, Stargate Command sends an international team to investigate the outpost, where Dr. [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] discovers the location of [[Atlantis]], the legendary city created by the Ancients.

The series was a ratings success for the Sci Fi Channel, and was particularly popular in [[Europe]] and [[Australia]]. Although it received little critical response, ''Stargate Atlantis'' was honored with numerous awards and award nominations in its five-season run. After ''Stargate Atlantis'' was cancelled, the show's co-creators began working on the already-conceptualized ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' which the network had approved to have a bigger budget, be less [[Mythology (fiction)|mythology]]-dependent, and have more focus on character development; ''Stargate Universe'' premiered on October 2nd 2009, and was cancelled after two seasons. Merchandise for ''Stargate Atlantis'' includes games and toys, print media, and an original audio series. With the cancellation of ''Stargate Universe'', the intended direct-to-DVD ''Stargate Atlantis'' movie, entitled ''Stargate: Extinction'', was also cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Coll |first=Kevin |authorlink=|url=http://www.fusedfilm.com/2011/01/stargate-universe-cancellation-kills-stargate-atlantis-movie-possibility/ |title= ''Stargate Universe'' Cancellation Kills ''Stargate Atlantis'' Movie Possibility. |publisher=''Fused Film'' |date=January 3, 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=|url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2010/12/25/december-25-2010-christmas-marty-g-and-the-return-of-the-mailbag/ |title= Christmas!

==Series overview==
{{Main|List of Stargate Atlantis episodes|Mythology of Stargate|Atlantis (Stargate)|Stargate Program}}
''Stargate Atlantis'' follows the present-day adventures of [[John Sheppard (Stargate)|Lt. Colonel John Sheppard]] and his military team from Earth that, along with two dozen other teams, explore distant planets in the Pegasus Galaxy. They use an alien device known as a [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]] that was built millions of years ago by an advanced race of humans known as the [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]].  The expedition is based in the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]] on the planet &quot;Lantea&quot;. The city was built millions of years ago by the [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]]. Five to ten million years ago, due to a plague in the Milky Way Galaxy, they were forced to flee to the Pegasus Galaxy, and there they seeded life on hundreds of worlds as they had done to Earth in the Milky Way. After encountering a powerful enemy known as the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]] and going to war with them for one hundred years, the Ancients ultimately lost and were forced to submerge their city beneath Lantea's ocean, which, in the Stargate universe, is the source of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[mythology|myth]] of the Lost City of [[Atlantis]].

''Stargate: Atlantis'' episodes feature a self-contained story that also contributes to the larger storyline of the war against the Wraith and the Atlantis residents' search for the means to destroy their enemy. Each season has also featured a two-part episode, and a few episodes that, while not technically two-parters, feature direct continuity with the story of the previous episode (for example, season 3 &quot;[[Progeny (Stargate Atlantis)|Progeny]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Real World (Stargate Atlantis)|The Real World]]&quot;). Each episode begins with a [[cold open]], sometimes preceded by a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative. The [[opening credits]] feature an original theme by [[Joel Goldsmith]]. Though they were drastically cut at the start of season 2, the full credits were recovered after the mid-season two-parter. They were again cut short in the 5th season.

===Seasons 1â3===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis (season 1)|Stargate Atlantis (season 2)|Stargate Atlantis (season 3)}}
Season one began airing in the United States on July 16, 2004. The Atlantis expedition, led by [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Dr. Elizabeth Weir]], arrives at Atlantis, the city of the Ancients.  The expedition quickly finds itself in a dire situation that forces them to seek new friends, the [[Athosians]], but they also acquire a powerful new enemy: the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]. Due to the power requirements for reaching Lantea, they are unable to contact Earth.  The expedition must survive in a new galaxy, while deciphering the Ancients' technology in order to find a way to destroy the Wraith and to acquire important new knowledge. Major Sheppard puts together a team consisting of himself, Dr. Rodney McKay, Lt. Ford and the Athosian leader [[Teyla Emmagan]], who serve as Atlantis' first contact team. In one of their first missions, they make another enemy, the [[Genii (Stargate)|Genii]], a human militaristic civilization with a 1950s level of technology. After several more revelations about the Wraith are made, the expedition prepares to evacuate. Just before they do, however, a military contingent from Earth arrives to help defend the city against the impending Wraith attack long enough for Earth's latest battleship to arrive. The season ends with a cliffhanger, while the city is still under siege by the Wraith.

Season two began airing in the United States on July 15, 2005, and it picked up where Season 1 ended. The Atlantis expedition successfully avoids being culled by the Wraith by making them believe Atlantis had been destroyed, and they recover semi-regular contact with Earth, thanks to the [[Daedalus class battlecruiser|Daedalus]] and the new [[Zero Point Module]] (ZPM) recovered by SG-1. Sheppard is promoted to Lt. Colonel and former [[Runner (Stargate)|Runner]] [[Ronon Dex]] replaces Lt. Ford, who went [[missing in action]] (MIA) at the end of the battle with the Wraith. The central plot of the second season is the development of Dr. [[Carson Beckett|Beckett]]'s retrovirus, which can, theoretically, turn a Wraith into a human. While an incomplete version makes a [[Wraith characters in Stargate#Ellia|young Wraith girl]] lose all her humanity and almost turns Sheppard into an [[Iratus bug]], a more developed version is tested on a living Wraith, &quot;[[Wraith (Stargate)#&quot;Michael&quot;|Michael]]&quot;, with mixed results. Michael's Wraith faction proposes an alliance with Atlantis, but they betray the team. The season closes again with a cliffhangerâthe Wraith are heading for the rich feeding grounds of Earth.

Season three premiered in the United States on July 14, 2006, picking up where season 2 ended. Having stopped the Wraith from reaching Earth and having failed to develop a working Wraith retrovirus, the expedition faces its third year in the Pegasus galaxy with the Wraith still a threat and a new, powerful enemy bent on destroying the expedition and Atlantis: the [[Asuran (Stargate)|Asurans]], self-replicating nanobots, also known as Replicators. The situation becomes complicated when an experiment gone awry drains their only ZPM, leaving them without a power source for the city's shields. Soon thereafter, they find a lost Ancient vessel and subsequently lose the city of Atlantis when the crew of the Ancient ship reclaims it. The SGC sends General O'Neill and Richard Woolsey to try to negotiate an agreement between Earth and the Ancients to allow the expedition to return to Atlantis. O'Neill and Woolsey dial Earth and inform them that the Asurans are taking over the city. They kill the Ancient crew who reclaimed the city after 10,000 years. The main members of the Atlantis expedition on Earth disobey their orders and go back to the city, rescue O'Neill and Woolsey, and repel the Asuran invasion. The season finale starts off with Earth launching a first strike against the Asurans, who are building an armada to attack Earth. The Asurans counterattack by attacking Atlantis with a powerful beam weapon fired through a satellite housing a Stargate. As a last resort, the Atlantis team fires up the city's stardrive and escapes into space. The finale ends when the hyperdrive malfunctions, leaving the city flying through uncharted space with a day's worth of energy left in their sole ZPM and Dr. Weir critically injured.

===Seasons 4â5===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis (season 4)|Stargate Atlantis (season 5)}}
[[File:stargateatlantis4.png|260px|thumb|Season 4 cast from left to right: Dr. Rodney McKay, Col. Samantha Carter, Lt. Col. John Sheppard, Teyla Emmagan, and Ronon Dex.]]
Season four premiered in the USA on September 28, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2007/02/season_four_to_premiere_this_fal.shtml|title=Season Four to premiere this fall|work=GateWorld |date=February 20, 2007 |accessdate=2008-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the UK on October 9, 2007. The writers stated that season 4 would take the series in a new direction. As the 4th season begins where season 3 ended, the future seems bleak: Weir is incapacitated and the senior members of the expedition have suffered multiple injuries. With the city damaged, running out of power and drifting in space, cut off from Earth, the Atlantis expedition raids Asuras to obtain a ZPM and is able to travel to a nearby planet. Weir is captured by the Asurans and Colonel Samantha Carter joins as a regular and acts as the expedition leader.&lt;ref name=&quot;chevron26p76&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chevron26.com/enews/?p=76 |work=Chevron26.com |title=Carter Gates to Atlantis |accessdate=2008-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; She appears in the episode &quot;Lifeline&quot; after helping to find and land Atlantis on its new home planet; she is then ordered back to the SGC. In episode 3, under the IOA's orders, Carter returns to Atlantis as the new leader of the expedition after Atlantis lands. The season focuses on the main antagonists: the Asurans and the Wraith, as well as the pregnancy of Teyla Emmagan. The Asuran base code is reprogrammed by McKay, leading the nanobots to fulfill the purpose for which the Ancients created them: to wipe out the Wraith. Midway through the season, they are seemingly destroyed, and the remaining episodes concentrate mainly on Michael's efforts against both humans and the other Wraith.

In the fifth season, [[Richard Woolsey]] replaces Carter as the leader of the expedition. Teyla, who was held captive by Michael, gives birth to Torren John and escapes with her team, before they are able to cripple Michael. Eventually, he invades Atlantis with a commandeered Puddle Jumper to take Torren and destroy Atlantis but, thanks to the efforts of Sheppard, Teyla, and McKay, Michael is finally killed. The season also introduces a group of rogue [[Asgard (Stargate)|Asgard]], who unlike their Ida counterparts, actually experiment on humans to prolong their lives, and steal a device known as &quot;The Attero device&quot; to destroy the Wraith, though the side effect is that any Stargate activated after the device has been turned on will explode. The device is eventually destroyed. With the Attero device, Michael and the Hoffan drug, the Wraith have become weakened, and are no longer the power of the galaxy they once were; the falling gives the humans freedom enough to establish a coalition. McKay falls in love with Keller, who eventually reciprocates his feelings, and they become romantically involved. In the finale, Todd the Wraith alerts Atlantis to the fact that an underling wraith possesses a Hive Ship powered by a ZPM.  In the process of trying to retrieve the ZPM and disable the Hive, the Atlantis team is present when the Hive receives a communication sent from an alternate reality giving away Earth's location.  The Hive disables both the Daedalus and the Apollo, then heads straight to Earth. Thanks to the efforts of the expedition, the ship is finally destroyed over Earth, and Atlantis lands in the Pacific Ocean near the Golden Gate Bridge in  [[San Francisco]].

===Development===
[[File:Robertcooper.jpg|right|thumb|Cooper, writer and [[executive producer]] for the show with Wright]]
When producers [[Brad Wright]] and [[Robert C. Cooper]] thought the original ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' series was going to be cancelled after [[Stargate SG-1 (season 5)|season five]], due to [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s announcement that they were canceling the show, they came up with the idea of making a new feature film. However, as the ratings on its new home at the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] were quite good, the idea was pushed to [[Stargate SG-1 (season 6)|season six]] and then to [[Stargate SG-1 (season 7)|season seven]]. Wright had initially intended to set the new show in [[Antarctica]] under the ice. It would have replaced [[Stargate Command]] (SGC) as Earth's conduit to other worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Mallozzi |first=Joseph |authorlink=|url=http://josephmallozzi.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/january-2-2009-brad-wright-answers-your-questions/ |title=January 2, 2009: Brad Wright Answers Your Questions |publisher=josephmallozzi.wordpress.com |date=January 2, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in season seven of ''SG-1'', talks began of a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] series and the producers were left with a serious dilemma, since the seventh season of ''Stargate SG-1'' had been planned to lead up to the great discovery of the lost city of the [[Ancients (Stargate)|Ancients]], [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]]. The ''Stargate SG-1'' seventh season ended in a two parter episode, &quot;[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]&quot;, was supposed to be a bridge between ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and the new spin-off, either a show or a movie, which was not planned to run at the same time as ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Wright and Cooper rewrote the script as the two-part season seven finale, and moved the setting of the story. The city of Atlantis, originally planned to be on Earth under [[Antarctica]] in place of the SGC, was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]]. This change not only addressed the problem of fans wondering why the SGC would not be coming to the aid for the Atlantis Expedition with each episode, but it also gave the producers a chance to start afresh with new ideas instead of having an identical copy of the original show.&lt;ref name=&quot;watergate&quot;&gt;{{cite book| last = Gosling | first = Sharon | authorlink = | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate = | year = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 10â19 | chapter = Watergate }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series received the green light on November 17, 2003 and started shooting in February 2004. It premiered on July 16 of the same year. From the start, Wright and Cooper ruled out casting &quot;star names&quot;, on the basis of the financial pressures they were already experiencing with &quot;star names&quot; on ''Stargate SG-1''. The casting was made more complicated because ''Atlantis'' got the go-ahead in November, and had to compete with other networks during [[Television pilot|pilot]] season.&lt;ref name=&quot;watergate&quot; /&gt;

===Casting and cast changes===
[[File:Joeflanigan.jpg|thumb|right|[[Joe Flanigan]], one of many main characters, at Comic Con 2007]]
The character most difficult to cast was the then-called Dr. Ingram, an unexcitable scientist expert on the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]. As the first day of shooting drew nearer and they were unable to find the right actor, they came to realize they had brought in the wrong character. Longtime Stargate director [[Martin Wood]] and Brad Wright thought it should be Dr. [[Rodney McKay]], who had already appeared in a guest role in three episodes of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''. Actor [[David Hewlett]] was contacted and arrived at the set the day after filming had started.&lt;ref name=&quot;watergate&quot; /&gt; Dr. Ingram had already been written in to the pilot episode of the show and so the same script was used and the character's name simply changed to McKay. Later scripts were written with Dr. McKay in mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Taylor Brown |url=http://www.gateworld.net/atlantis/s1/reviews/101.shtml |title=Rising, part 1 |publisher=''GateWorld'' | language=| accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creators found themselves with a problem with the character of Lt. [[Aiden Ford]] ([[Rainbow Sun Francks]]) in [[Stargate Atlantis (season 2)|season two]], a first season regular that the producers, and the actor himself, felt had not worked as intended and was highly underused as a result. Unwilling to write him out, the writers came up with an idea to make the character more important, but that downgraded him to recurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Lynley Oram and Feli |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/ford_tough.shtml |title=Ford Tough |work=GateWorld |date= |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; To replace him, they created [[Ronon Dex]] as a sidekick for Lt. Col. [[John Sheppard (Stargate)|John Sheppard]], but finding an actor with the physical presence and the acting ability necessary was not easy until they saw [[Jason Momoa]]'s tape.&lt;ref name=&quot;into season 2&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last = Gosling | first = Sharon | authorlink = | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 2 | origdate = | year = 2006 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 1-84576-163-4 | pages = 10â17 | chapter = Into season 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[X-files]]'' veteran [[Mitch Pileggi]] and [[Kavan Smith]] were added to the cast in the recurring roles of Col. [[Steven Caldwell (Stargate)|Steven Caldwell]] and Maj. [[Evan Lorne]].&lt;ref name=&quot;into season 2&quot; /&gt; [[Paul McGillion]]'s character, Dr. [[Carson Beckett]], became a regular in season two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.gateworld.net/news/2004/12/mcgillionmadeiatlantisireg.shtml |title = McGillion made Atlantis regular | author= | work = GateWorld |date = December 8, 2004 | accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stargate Atlantis (season 3)|Seasons three]] and [[Stargate Atlantis (season 4)|four]] changed the cast lineup again. Paul McGillion's Dr. Carson Beckett was killed in the season three episode &quot;[[Sunday (Stargate Atlantis)|Sunday]]&quot;, then brought back at the end of season four as a recurring character. The new medical chief was [[Jennifer Keller]], played by [[Jewel Staite]], who was introduced in the Season 3 finale, was a recurring character in Season 4, and became a regular in Season 5. Jewel Staite had already played a guest role in Season 2 as Ellia, a female Wraith, and the producers agreed they wanted her for a more important role. [[Amanda Tapping]]'s [[Samantha Carter]] crossed from ''Stargate SG-1'' for 14 episodes in Season four, as the new leader of the expedition, while [[Torri Higginson]]'s [[Elizabeth Weir (Stargate)|Elizabeth Weir]] became a recurring character in season four instead of a regular.&lt;ref name=&quot;joinswrongcast&quot;&gt;{{cite news | author=| url=http://featuresblogs.chicagotribune.com/entertainment_tv/2007/02/amanda_tapping_.html |work=Chicago Tribune |title=Amanda Tapping joins 'Stargate Atlantis' | date=February 20, 2007 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Picardo]] became a regular in [[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)|season five]] as [[Richard Woolsey]] replaced [[Samantha Carter]] as the commander of the Atlantis Expedition.&lt;ref name=&quot;joinswrongcastds&quot;&gt;{{cite web | author= | url=http://www.courant.com/topic/zap-robertpicardostargateatlantis,0,996344.story |work=The Hartford Courant |title=Robert Picardo Joins 'Stargate Atlantis' | date=February 5, 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higginson declined to appear as a guest star; instead, her character Weir was portrayed by [[Michelle Morgan (actress)|Michelle Morgan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2008/02/higginson_out_for_season_five.shtml | author=Darren Sumner |title=Higginson Out for Season 5 |work=GateWorld |date=February 9, 2008 |accessdate=2009-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming and visual effects===
[[File:Bridge Studios.jpg|thumb|''Atlantis'' was filmed at The Bridge Studios in Vancouver, Canada.]]
''Stargate Atlantis'' was shot at [[Bridge studios]] in [[Vancouver]] and on location in several places in [[British Columbia]]. The Pemberton Glacier doubled for Antarctica during the opening flying sequence in series premiere &quot;[[Rising (Stargate Atlantis)|Rising]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gosling | first = Sharon | authorlink = | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | origdate = | year = 2005 | origmonth = July | publisher = Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 1-84576-116-2 | pages = 26 | chapter = Rising (I) }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lynn Canyon Park|Lynn Valley Canyon]] was, for example, where the episode &quot;[[Instinct (Stargate Atlantis)|Instinct]]&quot; was filmed.&lt;ref&gt;''Stargate Official Magazine'' issue 6&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the season, filming had become more expensive because of the [[Financial crisis of 2007â2010|financial crisis]], which again led to the decline of the [[American dollar]] and rise of the [[Canadian dollar]].&lt;ref name=&quot;risefallfilmingfall&quot;&gt;{{cite news |last=Brett | first=Love |title=Stargate Atlantis canceled, kind of |url=http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/08/21/stargate-atlantis-canceled-kind-of/ |format= |agency= |work= |publisher=''TV Squad'' |date=August 21, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; When tasked with moving the ''Stargate'' sets from Vancouver to [[Los Angeles]], [[Robert C.

[[Rachel Luttrell]] (portraying [[Teyla Emmagan]] in the series) used her time during the [[Stargate Atlantis (season 1)|''Stargate Atlantis'' season one]] hiatus to be trained in the martial arts by [[science fiction]] veteran [[Ray Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2004/12/luttrelltotrainwithraypark.shtml |title =Luttrell to train with Ray Park | author= David Read | work = GateWorld |date = December 5, 2004 | accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stargate Atlantis'' inherited ''[[Blade: Trinity]]'''s effects stage. The ''Blade: Trinity'' production gave the set to ''Stargate Atlantis'' to save the high cost of dismantling the massive construct. The set has appeared several times.

===Music===
''Stargate Atlantis'' features a [[symphonic orchestra]] soundtrack composed by [[Joel Goldsmith]]. Goldsmith's first task for the series was to compose the main title song, which was nominated in the category Outstanding Main Title Theme Music in the [[Primetime Emmy Awards]] in 2005. When composing the music, Goldsmith went for a more pastoral, [[Europe]]an and [[Americana]] approach, while keeping the adventurous, symphonic approach the producers wanted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Each season of ''Stargate Atlantis'' featured 20 episodes, and in the United States they are broadcast in two series of 10 episodes. The first 10 episodes air from mid-July to September in the United States, ending in the cliffhanger of a two-parter episode. The second half airs first in Canada, from November to January, ending also with a cliffhanger. In the United States, the second half aired from January to March during seasons 1 and 2, but season 3 aired from April to June 2007. Because of the offset, the show has often been bootlegged by American viewers.

[[Stargate Atlantis (season 4)|Season four]] chalked up a viewer average of 1.8 million in the United States, beating the average [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=john | last=Dempsey | url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117974591.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1&amp;query=stargate+atlantis |title=Sci Fi renews 'Stargate Atlantis' |work=Variety Magazine |accessdate=2008-09-28 | date=October 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final episode, &quot;[[Enemy at the Gate (Stargate Atlantis)|Enemy at the Gate]]&quot; got a Nielsen Rating of 1.5, which was also the highest rating in [[Stargate Atlantis (season 5)|season 5]].&lt;ref name=&quot;NRTWO&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/atlantis/s5/ratings.shtml |title=Season Five Ratings |publisher=''GateWorld'' |accessdate=2009-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Enemy at the Gate&quot; was viewed by 2.02 million people in the US, including 973,000 in the 18 to 49 demographic, and 1.12 million age 25 to 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Darren |last=Sumner |title=Atlantis finale scores 1.5 rating |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2009/01/atlantis-finale-scores-15-rating/ |format= |agency= |work= |publisher=''GateWorld'' |date=January 1, 2009 |accessdate=2009-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, the finale was viewed by 633,000, placing ''Stargate Atlantis'' third in the top ten for [[Sky 1]] in that week, behind ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and season seven premiere of ''[[24 (TV series)|24]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.barb.co.uk/viewingsummary/weekreports.cfm?RequestTimeout=500&amp;report=weeklytop30 |title=BARB's multichannel top 10 programmes (Go on w/e 18/01/09, and scroll down to Sky 1) |publisher=barb.co.uk |accessdate=2008-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
