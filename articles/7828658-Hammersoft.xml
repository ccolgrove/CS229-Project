'''Drew Meekins''' (born April 10, 1985) is an [[United States|American]] [[pairs skater]].  With former partner [[Julia Vlassov]], he is the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Junior Champion]].

==Early life==
Drew Meekins was born in [[Juneau]], [[Alaska]] to Edward Russell &quot;Russ&quot; Meekins, Jr. and Nancy Harvey.  His father, aunt and grandfather all served in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]] as [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] representing [[Anchorage]], and as such traveled to Juneau (Alaska's capital) for legislative sessions.  His father, the only one of the three to serve more than one term, played a key role in his final term during the 12th Alaska State Legislature (1981-1983) in two events which rank amongst the most significant in the history of the [[Alaska Legislature]]: the mid-session overthrow of the Democratic House leadership and its replacement with a multi-party coalition;  and the bribery conviction and subsequent expulsion of a member of the [[Alaska Senate]].  Russ Meekins, Jr. retired from elected office following that term, but remained in Juneau and worked as a lobbyist.  The family moved from Alaska to Massachusetts ca. 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Alaska Ear|first=Sheila|last=Toomey|newspaper=[[Anchorage Daily News]]|location=[[Anchorage]]|date=March 12, 2006|page=B2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His brother, [[Cam Meekins]], is a rapper.&lt;ref name=tie060311&gt;{{cite news | url = http://web.icenetwork.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20110603&amp;content_id=19970988&amp;vkey=ice_news | title = The Inside Edge with Sarah and Drew - June 3 | last = Brannen | first = Sarah S. | last2=Meekins | first2= Drew |date = June 3, 2011 | work = IceNetwork | accessdate = June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has an older half-brother named Rodney.

==Career==
Meekins began skating at age twelve because his sister was already skating. He started out as a single skater, but he switched to [[pair skating]] when he was sixteen.  

Meekins and Vlassov won the [[World Junior Figure Skating Championships|2006 World Junior Championships]]. In their first season of senior international competition, they won the silver at the [[Nebelhorn Trophy]], placed sixth at the [[2006 Cup of China]], and placed 5th at the [[2006 NHK Trophy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usfigureskating.org/event_story.asp?id=36873 Welcome to U.S. Figure Skating&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Vlassov and Meekins finished in 7th place in their senior debut at the [[2007 United States Figure Skating Championships|2007 U.S. Championships]]. They were fifth in the free program.

Vlassov and Meekins were assigned to two Grand Prix events for the 2007-2008 season; however, they were forced to withdraw from the [[2007 Skate Canada International]] before the event began due to an injury to Meekins's shoulder which occurred during an attempted lift in practice. Vlassov and Meekins announced the end of their partnership on November 8, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Pairs Team Vlassov and Meekins Announces Split |url=http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=39912 |work= |publisher=[[U.S. Figure Skating]] |date=2007-11-08  |accessdate=2007-11-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[U.S. Figure Skating]] announced on July 14, 2008 that Meekins had teamed up with [[Jessica Rose Paetsch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title= Pairs Team Jessica Rose Paetsch and Jon Nuss End Partnership |url= http://usfsa.org/Story.asp?id=41636 |work= |publisher= [[U.S. Figure Skating]] |date= 2008-07-14 |accessdate=2008-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paetsch and Meekins placed 10th at the [[2009 United States Figure Skating Championships|2009 U.S. Championships]]. 

After qualifying for the [[2010 United States Figure Skating Championships|2010 U.S. Championships]], Paetsch &amp; Meekins announced the end of their partnership in December 2009. Meekins is now a figure skating coach at the Broadmoor skating club in Colorado Springs, CO, but hopes to find another partner so he can compete again.
