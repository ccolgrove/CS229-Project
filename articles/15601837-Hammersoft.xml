The '''[[2008 NFL season|2008]] [[Tennessee Titans]] season''' was the 49th season for the team in the [[National Football League]], their twelfth in Tennessee, and their tenth as the Titans.

However, the Titans lost four of their last seven and were eliminated by the [[Baltimore Ravens]] in the divisional round.

The Titans pulled off an important divisional win behind the strong running of rookie RB [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]], who rushed for 93 yards in his NFL debut, and the arm of backup quarterback [[Kerry Collins]], who replaced starter [[Vince Young]] when he went down late in the 4th quarter. Young had been inconsistent, throwing 1 TD pass to Johnson and 2 INTs. However, Collins moved the ball down field effectively and that drive led to the eventual game winning touchdown run by [[LenDale White]]. Jacksonville trailed for much of the game and couldn't run the ball against a locked in Titans defense, who sacked Jaguars quarterback [[David Garrard]] 7 times. Both teams' defenses played well but the Titans held on. This game was also significant because the Jaguars, Texans, and Colts (in their debut at [[Lucas Oil Stadium]]) lost, so the Titans grabbed first place in the AFC South for the first week of the season, ending a 56 week streak of holding 1st place in the division by the Colts.

===Week 2: at Cincinnati Bengals===

The Titans stayed in 1st place thanks to the extremely strong wind from the remnants of [[Hurricane Ike]] (which interfered with an important field goal attempt by [[Shayne Graham]]) and a sloppy Cincinnati offense in a 24â7 rout. Chris Johnson ran for over 100 yards for the first time in his career and [[Kerry Collins]] had a good day filling in for the injured Vince Young. The Titans first scored on a 1-yd TD run by [[LenDale White]] after a scoreless 1st quarter and then Cincinnati scored its only touchdown with a [[Chris Perry (American football)|Chris Perry]] 13-yd TD run on 4th down. The Titans, with a little over a minute left, drove the ball downfield and took a 14â7 lead at the half thanks to an 11-yd TD reception by [[Justin Gage]]. The knockout punch was delivered early in the 4th quarter with the Titans leading 17â7. [[Keith Bulluck]] recovered a blocked punt in the endzone to finish off the Bengals and keep the Titans perfect.

The win also gave the Titans their first 2â0 start for the first time since 1999.

In the first quarter, Tennessee trailed early as Houston Texans kicker [[Kris Brown]] got a 44-yard field goal.  The Titans responded with RB [[LenDale White]] getting a 2-yard TD run.  Houston drew close as Brown kicked a 24-yard field goal, yet Tennessee answered with QB [[Kerry Collins]] completing a 9-yard TD pass to TE [[Bo Scaife]].  The Texans replied with RB [[Steve Slaton]] getting a 6-yard TD run (with a failed PAT), while the Titans closed out the half with White's 1-yard TD run.  In the third quarter, Tennessee increased its lead with kicker [[Rob Bironas]] nailing a 44-yard field goal.  In the fourth quarter, the Titans closed out the game with CB [[Cortland Finnegan]] returning an interception 99 yards for a touchdown.

In the second quarter, the Vikings responded with RB [[Adrian Peterson]] getting a 28-yard TD run.  Afterwards, the Titans answered with Bironas kicking a 32-yard field goal, along with RB [[LenDale White]] getting a 1-yard TD run.  Minnesota closed out the half with kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] getting a 42-yard field goal.

On [[Monday Night Football]], the Titans responded to the doubters and defeated the Colts for only the fourth time since formation of the [[AFC South]]; the final score was 31â21 and came after Indianapolis had been heavily favored to win. [[Rob Bironas]] got it started with a field goal but then [[Peyton Manning]] found [[Dallas Clark]] for a touchdown on the next drive. Bironas pulled the Titans to within one with another field goal, but missed one before the half to keep the Titans behind going into halftime. Manning found Clark once again the 3rd quarter for a 14â6 lead but that would be the last time they would lead as [[LenDale White]] scored and [[Ahmard Hall]] caught a two point conversion from [[Kerry Collins]]. Bironas hit another field goal to give the Titans the lead for good. Two key interceptions by the Titans put the Colts away as White scored again and rookie [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]] added his fourth rushing touchdown late. Manning would score a rushing touchdown in the final minute but it was too little too late. With the win, the Titans picked up their first 7â0 start in the franchise's overall history.

During halftime, former Titans [[Steve McNair]], [[Eddie George]], and [[Frank Wycheck]] were honored.

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the Texans, the Titans went home for a crucial Week 16 battle with the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], with the AFC's top seed on the line.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Titans got the second quarter lead as kicker [[Rob Bironas]] got a 42-yard field goal, along with quarterback [[Kerry Collins]] completing a 34-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Justin Gage]].  The Steelers would respond with quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]] completing a 31-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Santonio Holmes]].  In the third quarter, Pittsburgh took the lead as Roethlisberger completed a 21-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Hines Ward]], yet Tennessee struck back with rookie running back [[Chris Johnson (running back)|Chris Johnson]] getting a 21-yard touchdown run.  The Titans would then pull away in the fourth quarter with running back [[LenDale White]]'s 1-yard touchdown run and safety [[Michael Griffin (American football)|Michael Griffin]]'s 83-yard interception return for a touchdown. This was the first game of the year where the league-leading Steelers defense allowed more than 300 yards of total offense (allowing 332 yards)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/liveupdate/gamecenter/29761/TEN_Gamebook.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. As the game drew to a close, several Titans, including LenDale White, began to unceremoniously mock the Terrible Towel, one of the main symbols of the Steeler Faithful, by stomping on it and blowing their noses in it&lt;ref&gt;http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3787880&lt;/ref&gt;. This outraged Steeler fans, even more so in the wake of losing the #1 seed in the AFC. However, the Steelers would have the last laugh, eventually going on to beat the Arizona Cardinals in [[Super Bowl XLIII]]. The Titans would lose 8 straight games, stretching into the early half of the 2009 season. This would lead several people to declare that the Titans were suffering from the Curse of the Terrible Towel. The Titans only began winning when LenDale White and Keith Bulluck donated an autographed Terrible Towel to the Allegheny Public School System (the proceeds of Terrible Towel sales are all donated to the Allegheny Public School System)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wtae.com/r/21479256/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt;

With the win, not only did Tennessee improve to 13â2, but they also locked up the AFC's #1 seed.

Tennessee trailed early in the first quarter as Colts quarterback [[Peyton Manning]] completed a 55-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Joseph Addai]] followed by kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]]'s 28-yard field goal.  The Titans' deficit would increase in the second quarter as Vinatieri nailed a 21-yard and a 38-yard field goal.

Entering the postseason as the AFC's top seed, the Titans began their postseason run at home in the AFC Divisional round against the #6 [[Baltimore Ravens]], in a rematch of their Week 5 contest.

Matt Stover kicked a 43-yard field goal with 57 seconds remaining to send the Ravens into the AFC Championship Game at the expense of the Titans, as quarterback Joe Flacco became the first rookie quarterback to win two playoff games in a single postseason. Tennessee turned the ball over three times, which proved to be the difference between the two teams, as Baltimore never gave the ball away.

The Titans took the lead on their second drive of the game with Kerry Collins completing a 28-yard pass to rookie running back Chris Johnson and a 20-yarder to Justin Gage before Johnson finished the drive with an 8-yard touchdown run. But the Ravens answered back with a 48-yard touchdown Flacco pass to former Titan Derrick Mason.

Early in the second quarter, Tennessee drove to the Ravens 25-yard line, only to turn the ball over on downs due to a fumbled snap on a fourth down conversion attempt. Then after forcing a punt, their drive to the Ravens 32-yard line also ended with no points when a pass from Collins was picked off by former Titan Samari Rolle. Following another punt, the Titans moved the ball into scoring range for the third time in a row, this time driving to the Baltimore 22. But once again they came up empty after LenDale White's fumble was recovered by Ravens safety Jim Leonhard with 25 seconds left in the half.

In the second half, a 29-yard punt return by Leonard and a 37-yard reception by Mark Clayton set up a Stover field goal to take a 10â7 lead. Meanwhile the Titans failed to score again, as Rob Bironas missed a 51-yard field goal and after Stover's field goal, and Ravens cornerback Fabian Washington forced and recovered a fumble from tight end Alge Crumpler on Baltimore's 1-yard line.

However, the Ravens were unable to gain any yards with their ensuing drive and Tennessee got the ball back with great field position at the Ravens 42-yard line. This time, they managed to drive to the 10-yard line and score with a Bironas field goal to tie the game at 10.

Two plays after the ensuing kickoff, Baltimore faced 3rd down and 2. On the next play, the play clock appeared to expire before the snap, but no penalty flag was thrown and Flacco ended up completing a 23-yard pass to Todd Heap. Five plays later, Stover's 43-yard field goal gave the Ravens a 13â10 lead with 53 seconds left. Baltimore's defense then sealed the victory by forcing Tennessee to turn the ball over on downs on their own 40-yard line.
