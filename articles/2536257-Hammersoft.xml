A '''working holiday visa''' is a travel permit which allows travellers to undertake employment in the country issuing the visa for the purpose of supplementing their travel funds.

Most working holiday visas are offered under reciprocal agreements between certain countries, to encourage travel and cultural exchange between their citizens.

There are often several restrictions on this type of visa:
* many are intended for young travellers, and as such have an age restriction (usually 18-30 or 35)
* there are usually limits on the type of employment taken, or the length of time the traveller can be employed.
* the visa holder is expected to have sufficient funds to live on while they seek employment

The originating countries in this were [[Japan]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Canada]], which all wished to allow their young people to visit the [[United Kingdom]].

It allows young people to experience living in a foreign country, without undergoing the usual costly expenses of finding work sponsorship in advance, or going on expensive university exchange programmes.  

In [[Japan]] there is a Working Holiday Maker Alumni association, which gives seminars and orienteering to Japanese working holiday goers.
