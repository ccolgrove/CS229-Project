'''Bernard Cribbins''', [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (born 29 December 1928) is an [[England|English]] [[character actor]], [[voice-over]] artist and musical [[comedian]] with a career spanning over half a century who came to prominence in films in the 1960s, has been in work consistently since his professional debut in the mid 1950s, and as of 2010 is still an active performer.

He is particularly known to British audiences as the story-telling voice in ''[[The Wombles]]'', a children's programme which ran for 40 episodes between 1973 and 1975. He also recorded several hit [[novelty record]]s in the early 1960s and was a regular and prolific performer on ''[[Jackanory]]'' on BBC TV between 1966 and 1991. Cribbins' most recent prominent role has been as [[Wilfred Mott]], [[Companion (Doctor Who)|companion]] of the [[Tenth Doctor]] in ''[[Doctor Who]]''.

In 1962 he recorded two highly popular and well-remembered comic songs, &quot;Right Said Fred&quot; (in which a group of workmen struggle to relocate what would seem to be a piano) and &quot;Hole in the Ground&quot; (in which an embittered workman murders a bowler-hatted harasser).&lt;ref name=&quot;GavBark&quot;/&gt;
