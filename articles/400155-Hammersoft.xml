The '''Irish general election of 1948''' was held on 4 February 1948. The 147 newly elected [[members of the 13th DÃ¡il]] assembled on 18 February when the [[Government of the 13th DÃ¡il|First Inter-Party government]] in the history of the Irish state was appointed.

The general election took place in [[Parliamentary constituencies in the Republic of Ireland|40 parliamentary constituencies]] throughout [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] for 147 seats in the lower house of parliament, [[DÃ¡il Ãireann]]. For this election the membership of the DÃ¡il was increased to 147 seats, an increase of 9 since the previous election. The 1948 general election is considered an important election in 20th century Ireland, as it paved the way for the [[Government of the 13th DÃ¡il|First Inter-Party Government]].

==Campaign==
The general election of 1948 caused by a desire by the [[Taoiseach]] [[Ãamon de Valera]], to stop the rise of a new party, [[Clann na Poblachta]]. In 1947 the rapid rise of Clann na Poblachta threatened the position of [[Fianna FÃ¡il]]. The government of Ãamon de Valera introduced the [[Electoral Amendment Act, 1947]] which increased the size of the DÃ¡il from 138 to 147 and increased the number of three-seat constituencies from fifteen to twenty-two. The result was described by historian [[Tim Pat Coogan]] as ''&quot;a blatant attempt at [[Gerrymandering|gerrymander]] which no [[Northern Ireland|Six County]] [[Unionism in Ireland|Unionist]] could have bettered.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;coogan637&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of other issues were raised on the campaign that the parties didn't foresee. [[Fianna FÃ¡il]] had enjoyed an uninterrupted sixteen years of dominance in government. Many people believed that the party had become stale and there was a strong desire for a fresh change. Although [[World War II]] had ended three years earlier, [[rationing]] continued, and massive inflation plagued the economy. A prolonged teachers strike during the lifetime of the previous DÃ¡il damaged the government due to its inability to settle the dispute. Bad weather added to the woes of the farmers, and poor harvests resulted in anger at the ballot box. Allegations that Ãamon de Valera and [[SeÃ¡n Lemass]] were involved in bribery and corruption raised questions about certain public officials.

Despite these issues, Fianna FÃ¡il still expected to retain power.  This prospect seemed very likely; however, an unlikely coalition was soon to be formed.

*First Inter-party government formed.

When the votes were counted Fianna FÃ¡il remained the largest party in spite of dropping 8 seats.  Ãamon de Valera's gerrymandering tactics succeeded in limiting the seats won by Clann na Poblachta, which secured ten seats instead of the nineteen they would have received proportional to their vote.&lt;ref name=&quot;coogan637&quot; /&gt; The other parties remained roughly the same, with [[Fine Gael]] only gaining an extra seat. Fianna FÃ¡il remained the largest party and it looked as if it were the only one capable of forming a government.

==Formation of the Coalition==
The election left de Valera six seats short of a majority in the 147 seat DÃ¡il. Fianna FÃ¡il had long refused to enter a formal coalition with another party, instead preferring [[confidence and supply]] agreements with other parties when it was short of an outright majority.  This time, however, de Valera was unable to reach an agreement with National Labour and the Independents with a view to forming a government. It seemed unlikely that the other political parties could join together to oust Fianna FÃ¡il. However, a shared dislike of Fianna FÃ¡il and de Valera overcame all other difficulties to knock Fianna FÃ¡il from power for the first time in 16 years.

As the largest party in the government Fine Gael had the task of providing a nominee for [[Taoiseach]]. The natural choice was the party leader, [[Richard Mulcahy]]. However, [[Irish Republicanism|republicans]] such as [[SeÃ¡n MacBride]] refused to serve under the man who had been the commander of the [[Irish Free State|Free State]] forces during the [[Irish Civil War|civil war]]. Since the other parties would have been 17 seats short of a majority (and indeed, would have been 11 seats behind Fianna FÃ¡il) without MacBride, Mulcahy unselfishly stepped aside in favour of [[John A. Costello]], a relatively unknown politician and former [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]]. Mulcahy, who remained nominal leader of Fine Gael, became Minister for Education. [[William Norton]], the leader of the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] became [[TÃ¡naiste]] and Minister for Social Welfare.

On paper, this new coalition government looked weak and seemed unlikely to last. It consisted of a motley collection of political parties. There were young and old politicians, republicans and Free Staters, conservatives and socialists. The government's survival depended on a united dislike of Fianna FÃ¡il, the skill of Costello as Taoiseach and the independence of various ministers.

In all the coalition lasted over three years and was successful in several areas.
