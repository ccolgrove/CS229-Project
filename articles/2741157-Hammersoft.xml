'''William Henry Davis''' (April 15, 1940, [[Mineral Springs, Arkansas]] â March 9, 2010, [[Burbank, California]]) was a [[center fielder]] in [[Major League Baseball]] who played most of his career for the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]]. At the end of his career he ranked seventh in major league history in [[putout]]s (5449) and [[total chances]] (5719) in the outfield, and third in games in center field (2237); he was also ninth in [[National League]] history in total outfield games (2274), and won [[Gold Glove Award]]s from 1971 to 1973. He had thirteen seasons of 20 or more [[stolen base]]s, led the NL in [[triple (baseball)|triples]] twice, and retired with the fourth most triples (138) by any major leaguer since 1945. He holds Los Angeles club records (1958âpresent) for career [[hit (baseball)|hits]] (2091), [[run (baseball)|runs]] (1004), triples (110), [[at bat]]s (7495), [[total bases]] (3094) and [[extra base hit]]s (585). His 31-game [[hitting streak]] in {{By|1969}} remains the longest by a Dodger. At one point during the streak, when the team was playing at home, the big message board at [[Dodger Stadium]] quoted a message from a [[telegram]] sent to Davis and the team from [[Zack Wheat]], the team's former record holder, at his home in [[Missouri]].

==Career==
As a youngster, Davis moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], where he was a three-sport standout in [[baseball]], [[basketball]], and [[track &amp; field]] at [[Theodore Roosevelt High School (Los Angeles)|Theodore Roosevelt High School]]. He once ran a 9.5-second 100-yard dash, and set a city record in the [[long jump]] of 25 feet 5&amp;nbsp;inches (7.75 m).&lt;ref name=&quot;jcrowelat&quot;&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/sports/la-sp-crowe-20100310,0,2114104.column Crowe, Jerry. &quot;Few players were more exciting than Willie Davis,&quot; ''Los Angeles Times'', Wednesday, March 10, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; Discovered by the Dodgers [[scout (sport)|scout]], Kenny Myers, Davis signed with the ballclub upon graduating from Roosevelt in 1958.&lt;ref name=&quot;crazymccourt&quot;&gt;[http://losangeles.dodgers.mlb.com/news/press_releases//press_release.jsp?ymd=20100309&amp;content_id=8730216&amp;vkey=pr_la&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=la &quot;Statement from the Los Angeles Dodgers on the passing of Willie Davis (1940&amp;ndash;2010),&quot; Los Angeles Dodgers press release, Tuesday, March 9, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; While playing for Reno, he scored from first base on a [[single (baseball)|single]] nine times in one season.

Davis played his first game with the Los Angeles Dodgers in {{By|1960}}. The following season he replaced the former All-Star [[Duke Snider]] in center field, where Davis  stayed for 13 years. Widely considered to be one of the fastest baseball players of the 1960s, Davis had 20 or more [[stolen base]]s in eleven consecutive seasons. Davis's career-high in stolen bases was 42 in {{By|1964}}. Along with [[Maury Wills]], Davis put a lot of footspeed at the top of Dodgers' [[batting order (baseball)|lineup]], and this helped them to either win or tie for the National League lead at the ends of the baseball seasons of 1962, '63, '65, and '66. Also, in 1962, these two players &quot;set the plate&quot; for their teammate [[Tommy Davis]] to lead the National League with 153 [[runs batted in]] (RBI) -- the only time that a Los Angeles Dodger has ever accumulated 150 or more RBI in one baseball season.   

In {{By|1962}}, Davis [[batting average|batted]] 0.285 with 85 [[run batted in|runs batted in]], and he posted career highs in [[home run]]s (21), runs (103), and hits (171). In that same season, Davis and Wills set an National League record for stolen bases by two teammates in season with 136 (Wills with 104 and Davis with 32).

Davis batted a career-high 0.311 in {{By|1969}}. His hitting streak that year, from August 1 to September 3, was the longest one in the major leagues since [[Dom DiMaggio]] hit in 34 straight games in {{By|1949}}, and it broke [[Zack Wheat]]'s franchise record of 29, set in {{By|1916}}. In {{By|1970}}, Davis batted .305, and he had another hitting streak of 25 games in {{By|1971}}, ending with a 0.309 batting average and in double figures in [[double (baseball)|double]]s, 33; triples, 10;, home runs, 10; and stolen bases, 20. Davis also led the NL in triples in 1962 and 1970.

Davis was selected for the National League [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star]] teams in 1971 and in 1973, batting a combined 3-for-3, with a home run off the pitcher [[Nolan Ryan]]. Davis won a [[Gold Glove]] each year from 1971 to 1973. In the [[1965 World Series]], Davis set a record (since broken) of three stolen bases (including one during which he stumbled and fell, the pitcher hesitated throwing to first base, and Davis literally crawled into second base safely) in a single game. He led the league in put-outs twice, but also twice led the league in [[error (baseball)|errors]]. Unfortunately for him, Davis committed an all-time World Series record of three errors on just two consecutive plays in the fifth inning of Game Two of the [[1966 World Series]] (in the final game of [[Sandy Koufax]]'s great pitching career), first by losing a fly ball in the sun, then by dropping the next fly ball and overthrowing third base.  When questioned after the game, he said, &quot;It's not my wife; it's not my life.  It's just a game.&quot;

After {{By|1973}} season, Davia was traded to the [[Washington Nationals|Montreal Expos]] for the pitcher [[Mike Marshall (pitcher)|Mike Marshall]]. Davis batted 0.295 for Montreal before being traded to the [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] in December 1974. Davis batted just 0.249 for the Rangers in 42 games in 1975 before finishing the season with the [[St. Louis Cardinals]], batting 0.291. In 1976 he batted  0.268 for the [[San Diego Padres]], and then he spent two years in [[Nippon Professional Baseball|Japan]] with the [[Chunichi Dragons]] and [[Seibu Lions|Crown Lighter Lions]].

== Finishing up with baseball and moving on ==

A convert to Buddhism, Davis constantly fingered his prayer beads and chanted before games.&lt;ref name=Whiting&gt;Whiting, Robert. &quot;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1095410/1/index.htm You've Gotta Have 'wa']&quot; Sports Illustrated, Sep 24, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  He played his final major league season with the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|California Angels]] in {{By|1979}}, and made two pinch hitting appearances in the [[1979 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] before retiring. In an 18-season career, Davis accumulated a 0.279 batting average with 182 home runs and 1053 RBI in 2429 [[games played]]. He also collected 2561 hits and 398 stolen bases. His total of 2237 games in center field ranks behind only [[Willie Mays]] (2827) and [[Tris Speaker]] (2690) in major league history. In addition to the Los Angeles records he retains, his club mark of 1952 games was surpassed by [[Bill Russell (baseball)|Bill Russell]] in {{By|1984}}; [[Steve Garvey]] broke his records of 849 RBI and 321 doubles in {{By|1981}} and {{By|1982}} respectively. Garvey and [[Ron Cey]] passed his Los Angeles club record of 154 home runs in 1979; Davis' record for left-handed hitters was broken by [[Shawn Green]] in {{By|2004}}.

Willie also appeared in several TV programs, including ''[[Mr. Ed]]'', ''[[The Flying Nun]]'', and ''[[Owen Marshall: Counselor at Law]]''. He also was a co-star of the [[Jerry Lewis]] comedy film from 1970, ''[[Which Way to the Front?]]''.  In a 1969 episode of ''[[Bewitched]]'' Samantha, attending a game at [[Shea Stadium]] to see the [[New York Mets]] host the Dodgers, remarks &quot;Willie Davis just hit a grand slam!&quot; The episode was filmed August 22, 1969, a date when the Mets coincidentally beat the Dodgers at Shea.  In reality, Davis went 2 for 4 in the game, but did not hit a grand slam. 

Davis was found dead in his home in [[Burbank, California]] on March 9, 2010, by a neighbor who sometimes brought him breakfast.&lt;ref name=blankstein&gt;Blankstein, Andrew. &quot;[http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2010/03/former-dodger-willie-davis-found-dead-in-burbank-home.html Former Dodger Willie Davis found dead in Burbank home]&quot;, The Los Angeles Times, March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial indications show that he most likely died of natural causes.&lt;ref name=blankstein /&gt; Davis is survived by his two sons, Gregory and Casey, and two daughters, Kimberly and Jennifer.

Willie Davis an Arkansas native was voted #21 greatest Arkansas Sports Figure by Sports Illustrated. The list had the football player with the same name of the Packers listed, but he never even lived in Arkansas, this was a mistake and it was supposed to be William Henry Davis of baseball.
