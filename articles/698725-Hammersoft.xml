'''Yarra Trams''' is the trading name of the [[Trams in Melbourne|Melbourne tram network]], which is fully owned and registered by the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian State Government]]. The current franchise is operated by a consortium named [[KDR Melbourne]] which consists of a partnership between French company [[Keolis]] and Australian company [[Downer EDI Rail]]. 

Yarra Trams operates [[List of Melbourne tram routes|28 major tram routes]] and 501 vehicles of [[:Category:Melbourne tram vehicles|6 different classes]] in [[Melbourne]], Australia which consists of 70 [[A-class Melbourne tram|A-class]]; 132 [[B-class Melbourne tram|B-class]]; 36 three-section [[C-class Melbourne tram|C-class]], low-floor [[Citadis]]; 5 five-section [[C2-class Melbourne tram|C2-class]], low-floor [[Citadis]]; 38 three-section [[D-class Melbourne tram|D-class]], low-floor [[Combino]]; 21 five-section [[D-class Melbourne tram|D-class]], low-floor [[Combino]]; 52 [[W-class Melbourne tram|W-class]] and 147 [[Z-class Melbourne tram|Z-class]] type trams.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt; 

Yarra Trams currently employs around 1,900 staff which includes approximately 1150 tram drivers and 265 Authorised Officers.&lt;ref name=ff&gt;[http://yarratrams.com.au/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-47//74_read-117/ Facts &amp; Figures], accessed 2009-12-09&lt;/ref&gt; Yarra Trams operates the biggest tram network in the world with over 249 km of double track, over 1770 tram stops and 28 tram routes including Melbourne's free City Circle tourist tram.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt; 

A total of 141 million trips were taken in 2002 &amp; 2003, rising to nearly 150 million in 2004 and in 2007 &amp; 2008 over 158.3 million trips were taken on trams in Melbourne with trams travelling more than 24.8 million kilometres each year on timetabled services.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt;  Each week Yarra Trams operates 31,400 scheduled tram services, which results in trams operating for approximately 20 hours per day and a team of 24 hour operations staff completing network maintenance and cleaning.&lt;ref name=ff/&gt;

==History==
===1997 - 2002===
[[File:Acnewtram3.jpg|thumb|right|W6.983 on [[Victoria Parade, Melbourne]]]]

Yarra Trams was established in October 1997 when [[Met Tram]] was split into two business units in preparation for privatisation of the [[Public Transport Corporation]]. In August 1999, ownership of Yarra Trams was transferred to the private sector.&lt;ref name=centenary&gt;[http://www.100yearstrams.com.au/tram_history/history1.html 100 Years of Electric Trams in Melbourne], accessed 2008-08-30&lt;/ref&gt;

===2003 - 2009===
[[File:D1.3536ArtsCentre.jpg|thumb|right|D1.3536 in the [[Transdev TSL]] livery]]

After the collapse of [[M-Train|M&gt;Train]] and [[M-Tram|M&gt;Tram]] in December 2002,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/12/23/1040511007915.html Receivers take over train, tram group], accessed 2008-08-30&lt;/ref&gt; the State Government expressed interest in creating one metropolitan train operator and one tram operator. On 18 April 2004, [[Transdev TSL]] assumed operation of the whole Melbourne tram network, trading under a new [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian State Government]] owned and registered brand, Yarra Trams.&lt;ref name=centenary/&gt; On 25 June 2009, the Department of Transport of the [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Victorian State Government]] announced that the original [[Transdev TSL]] contract for running Melbourne's tram network, would not be renewed, resulting in a new operator being chosen. From 3.01am on 30 November 2009, [[KDR Melbourne]] a consortium led by [[Keolis]] &amp; [[Downer EDI Rail]]&lt;ref name=finished&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,25685294-661,00.html Connex and Yarra Trams dumped in favour of MTR and Keolis], accessed 2009-06-25 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; took control of Melbourne's tram network retaining the government owned brand, Yarra Trams.&lt;ref name=&quot;yarratramskeepname&quot;&gt;[http://www.news.com.au/heraldsun/story/0,21985,26014960-661,00.html New operators promise a smoother ride in time for summer], accessed 2009-09-01&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 - present===
Yarra Trams current metropolitan franchise started on 30 November 2009, and will last for eight years, with the option of a further seven years' extension on completion. The current CEO of Yarra Trams, [[Michel Masson]], launched at the changeover a new Yarra Trams logo along with a new modern tram livery featuring yellow doors.

==Operations==
===Fleet===

The Yarra Trams fleet consists of 501 trams, operated from eight depots located around the system. The bulk of the fleet is made up of Z-, A- and B-class trams, which were built by [[Comeng]] between 1975 and 1994. 

In October 2001, Yarra Trams took delivery of 36 [[Citadis]] trams which have primarily operated on route 109 to complement the extension to Box Hill. As part of the acquisition of the failed [[M-Tram|M&gt;Tram]] in 2004, Yarra acquired 39 [[Combino]] trams and oversaw the delivery of another 20 Combino trams originally ordered by National Express.

Yarra Trams also operate heritage [[W-class Melbourne tram|W-class]] trams, namely on the City Circle tourist service. W-class trams are also used on routes 30, 78 and 79. Due to these trams being limited to 40&amp;nbsp;km/h as a result of a series of modifications due to braking problems, their use is restricted to ensure limited interface with modern trams.

In 2003, Yarra Trams trialled a seating layout which became known as &quot;Apollo&quot;. The trial involved removing 30 seats from a B-class tram and replacing the removed seats with &quot;bum racks&quot; which are found in Citadis trams. This resulted in a higher capacity for standing passengers on crowded services during peak hours. A further ten trams received the seating layout during refurbishment.

The network must be compliant with disability legislation by 2011, which will require all trams to have the &quot;low floors&quot; that the Combino and Citadis trams have. To this end, the State Government are currently looking to invest in a sizable number of new trams to accommodate this need in time. One such example is the &quot;Bumblebee&quot; bright yellow trams that are currently on lease from France, operating exclusively on the light-rail route 96 to St Kilda.

Currently, Yarra Trams are giving all Z/A/B-class trams with the new livery which features yellow doors and a big green leaf in the center for Z/A-class trams and two big leaves on each end for the B class fleet. It is interesting to also note that the Z/A/B fleet are receiving new internal signs and seat covers whilst they are being re-branded. The seat covers are a green colour with leaf patterns. The C- and D-class fleet received a livery with new logos and yellow doors, but retaining there previous livery design. The interior of these trams have remained unchanged with only maps and signage getting the new logo.

===Ticketing===
{{Main|Metcard}}

Yarra Trams currently runs under the [[Metlink]] banner and utilises the [[Metcard]] ticketing system. Each tram has a coin only ticket machine on board. The on board machines currently sell City Saver, 2-Hour, Daily and Senior tickets. Trams are also equipped with a number of ticket validators.

Major superstops in the CBD also have coin-only ticket machines. Tickets can also be purchased from Railway Stations and retail outlets displaying a blue Metcard flag.

Most tram routes operate entirely within Zone 1, however Routes 75, 86 and 109 enter Zone 2.

It is expected that the entire tram network will be changing to the new [[myki]] smartcard fare collection system.

====Fare Enforcement====
[[File:FederationSquare-tramstop.jpg|thumb|right|Tram Stop outside [[Federation Square]]]]

Yarra Trams employs approximately 265 Authroized Officers, whose job is to report ticketing and behavioural offences onboard trams, tram lines, stops and other tram related properties to the Victorian [[Government of Victoria (Australia)#Department of Transport|Department of Transport]], and to provide customer service and assistance.&lt;ref name=&quot;doiao&quot;&gt;[http://www.doi.vic.gov.au/DOI/Internet/transport.nsf/AllDocs/82681CF0741763ADCA256DB70011EEE2?OpenDocument Department of Infrastructure: Authorised Officers]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Melbourne all public transport modes employ Authorised Officers, Authorised Officers have the right to exercise [[Police power|legislative powers]], similar to the police.&lt;ref name=&quot;doiao&quot;/&gt; They are permitted to arrest and detain offenders, if they believe an offence has been committed. Furthermore they are also allowed to exercise discretion in all cases and may choose to warn offenders instead of formally reporting them.&lt;ref name=&quot;doiao&quot;/&gt;

===Network expansion===
[[File:New tram stop on the way.jpg|thumb|right|New platform stop under construction]]

Since privatisation, the tram network has grown in size as a result of a number of extensions. The accessibility of the network has also been improved, with 330 [[Tram stop|platform stops]] built as of June 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| url=http://www.yarratrams.com.au/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-39/44_read-2893/ | work=[[Yarra Trams]] | title=330 and counting for platform stops | accessdate=2011-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In March 2000, trams reached the new [[Melbourne Docklands]] precinct for the first time. Since then, a line connecting LaTrobe St and Flinders St via Docklands has been constructed as well as a further extension along Docklands Drive to NewQuay, which opened in January 2005. Route 109 was extended 2.2&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mont Albert, Victoria|Mont Albert]] to [[Box Hill, Victoria|Box Hill]] in May 2003. The extension to Box Hill has provided a direct link between Box Hill and suburbs such as [[Balwyn, Victoria|Balwyn]], [[Kew, Victoria|Kew]] and [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]].

In July 2005, a 3&amp;nbsp;km extension of route 75 from [[East Burwood, Victoria|East Burwood]] to [[Vermont South, Victoria|Vermont South]] opened. Critics argue that the line should have been extended to [[Knox City Shopping Centre]] (as promised by the incumbent State Government in 1999). A shuttle bus service, operated by [[Ventura Bus Lines]], provides a service between Vermont South and Knox City which sees each tram met by a connecting bus.

===Think Tram===
[[File:Tram lane sign, Melbourne.jpg|thumb|right|Full time tram lane]]
{{Main|Think Tram}}

Yarra Trams is a partner in the Think Tram program, aimed at improving tram travel time and reliability. In conjunction with the Victorian government several initiatives are in place to run trams better on time.

Such idea implemented is the 'Part-time tram lane' - where trams have right of way on tram tracks often during peak hours. Several ideas such as raised curb dividers have also been in use to physically prevent cars from straying onto tram tracks. An example of these dividers can be seen on Spencer Street.

== Controversy ==

On September 14, 2005, it was reported that a young commuter suffered a minor injury when he was arrested by three Authorised Officers for assaulting a female officer with his skateboard after a request was made for his details. The alleged offender was remanded to appear in court on charges of assault, refusing to supply name and address, indecent language, and resisting arrest, as well as traveling without a valid ticket. However, some onlookers were not in agreement, claiming that the man was attempting to free himself and was pleading for the officers to stop hurting him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Up until 1 March 2010, Yarra Trams was the only main public transport operator in Melbourne to not have &quot;Meet Our Managers&quot; sessions. Connex senior management regularly held public feedback sessions at City Loop stations, while V/Line senior management also travel on regional trains at the rate of about once a month to have consultation sessions with their passengers. Yarra Trams have now decided to have a series of &quot;Meet the Manager&quot; sessions commencing 1 March 2010 at St Vincents Plaza Tram Stop (No. 12). Yarra Trams plan to make this a regular feedback event with further events being planned for the future on different routes within the network.

== Legislation and governance ==
=== Transport Integration Act===
The prime transport-related statute in Victoria is the [[Transport Integration Act]].  The Act establishes the [[Department of Transport (Victoria, Australia)|Department of Transport]] as the integration agency for Victoria's transport system.  The Act also establishes and sets the charters of the state agencies charged with providing public transport rail services and managing network access for freight services, namely the [[Director of Public Transport]] and [[V/Line]].  The Director of Public Transport is empowered by the Transport Integration Act to contract transport operators to provide rail and bus services and has used those powers to contract Yarra Trams to provide tram services in Melbourne&lt;ref&gt;[[Transport Integration Act 2010]], section 68(2)(b).&lt;/ref&gt;.

In addition, the Transport Integration Act establishes [[VicTrack]] which owns the public rail network and associated infrastructure.  Another important statute is the Rail Management Act 1996&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt3.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/742548D962C75039CA257761002C52FD/$FILE/96-79a050.pdf Rail Management Act 1996&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; which confers powers on rail operators and provides for an access scheme for the state's rail network.  The Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous Act) 1983 is also a relevant statute relating to public transport as it contains a number of offences relating to safety, ticketing and amenity.

=== Rail Safety Act ===
The safety of rail transport operations in Melbourne is regulated by the [[Rail Safety Act|Rail Safety Act 2006]] which applies to all commercial passenger operations.&lt;ref&gt;Official copy of the [[Rail Safety Act]] from the Victorian Government legislation web site - http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt3.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/6D4190C62DE6207FCA257761002C568A/$FILE/06-9a016.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The Act establishes a framework containing safety duties for all rail industry participants and requires operators who manage infrastructure and rolling stock to obtain accreditation prior to commencing operations.  Accredited operators are also required to have a [[Safety Management Systems|safety management system]] to guide their operations.  Sanctions applying to the safety scheme established under the [[Rail Safety Act]] are contained in the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]].&lt;ref&gt;See Part 7 of the Act.  Official copy of the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]] from the official Victorian Government legislation site - http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/7BB774D3E0245B77CA2577CE00030B90/$FILE/83-9921a153.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  The safety regulator for the rail system in Melbourne including trams is the [[Director, Transport Safety]] (trading as Transport Safety Victoria) whose office is established under the [[Transport Integration Act|Transport Integration Act 2010]].

=== Ticketing and conduct ===
Ticketing requirements for trains, trams and buses in Melbourne are mainly contained in the Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/LTObject_Store/LTObjSt5.nsf/DDE300B846EED9C7CA257616000A3571/C6D777772BB02CD3CA2577A5007CB77B/$FILE/06-86sr004.pdf Transport (Ticketing) Regulations 2006&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metlinkmelbourne.com.au/fares-tickets/victorian-fares-and-ticketing-manual Victorian Fares and Ticketing Manual - Metlink - Your guide to public transport in Melbourne and Victoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  Rules about safe and fair conduct on trains, trams and buses in Melbourne are generally contained in the [[Transport (Compliance and Miscellaneous) Act 1983]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/a12f6f60fbd56800ca256de500201e54/6ff43affd338ea35ca2577c60082b59c!OpenDocument Victorian Law Today Act&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Transport (Conduct) Regulations 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.vic.gov.au/Domino/Web_Notes/LDMS/PubLawToday.nsf/b12e276826f7c27fca256de50022686b/2e01dcbed2e5778cca2574e20017da2c!OpenDocument Victorian Law Today Statutory Rule&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
