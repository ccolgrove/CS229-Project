'''Social democracy''' is a [[political ideology]] of the [[center-left]] on the [[political spectrum]]. Social democracy is officially a form of [[Democracy|democratic]] [[evolutionary]] [[Reformism|reformist]] [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Steger, Manfred B. 1997.

Since the rise in popularity of the [[New Right]] and [[neoliberalism]], a number of prominent social democratic parties have abandoned the goal of the gradual evolution of [[capitalism]] to socialism and instead support [[welfare state]] capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;O'Hara, Phillip Anthony (ed.). ''Encyclopedia of political economy, Volume 2''. London, England, UK: Routledge, 1999 Pp. 539.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, several social democratic parties (in particular, the British [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]) have embraced more centrist, [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] policy positions. The development of Third Way social democracy has resulted in the rise of [[democratic socialism]] as a distinct break away ideology from social democracy. In many countries, social democrats continue to exist alongside [[democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]s, who stand to the left of them on the [[political spectrum]]. The two movements sometimes operate within the same political party, such as the [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Brazilian Workers' Party]]&lt;ref name=Lula&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4311957.stm BBC News: South America's leftward sweep, 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] of [[France]]. 

The [[Socialist International]] (SI) is the main international organization of social democratic and moderate socialist parties.{{citation}} It affirms the following principles: first, ''freedom''ânot only [[civil liberties|individual liberties]], but also freedom from [[discrimination]] and freedom from dependence on either the owners of the [[means of production]] or the holders of abusive [[political power]]; second, ''equality and [[social justice]]''ânot only before the law but also economic and socio-cultural equality as well, and equal opportunities for all including those with physical, mental, or social disabilities; and, third, ''solidarity''âunity and a sense of compassion for the victims of injustice and inequality. These ideals are described in further detail in the SI's Declaration of Principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistinternational.org/viewArticle.cfm?ArticleID=31 The SI's Declaration of Principles]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Original social democracy===

In the 19th Century, the term &quot;Social Democrat&quot; was used as a broad catch-all for international socialists owing their basic ideological allegiance to [[Karl Marx]] or [[Ferdinand Lassalle]], in contrast to those advocating various forms of [[utopian socialism]]. In one of the first scholarly works on European socialism written for an American audience, [[Richard T. Ely|Richard T. Ely's]] 1883 book, ''French and German Socialism in Modern Times,'' Social Democrats were characterized as &quot;the extreme wing of the socialists&quot; who were &quot;inclined to lay so much stress on equality of enjoyment, regardless of the value of one's labor, that they might, perhaps, more properly be called communists.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richard T. Ely, ''French and German Socialism in Modern Times.'' New York: Harper and Brothers, 1883; pg. 204.&lt;/ref&gt; Ely continued:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;They have two distinguishing characteristics. The vast majority of them are laborers, and, as a rule, they expect the violent overthrow of existing institutions by revolution to precede the introduction of the socialistic state. I would not, by any means, say that they are all revolutionists, but the most of them undoubtedly are. *  *  * &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;The most general demands of the social democrats are the following: The state should exist exclusively for the laborers; land and capital must become collective property, and production be carried on unitedly. Private competition, in the ordinary sense of the term, is to cease.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ely, ''French and German Socialism in Modern Times,'' pp. 204-205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many parties in this era described themselves as &quot;social democratic,&quot; including the [[General German Workers' Association]] and the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (which merged to form the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]]), the British [[Social Democratic Federation]], and the [[Russian Social Democratic Labour Party]]. The term &quot;social democracy&quot; continued to be used in this context up to the time of the [[Bolshevik Revolution]] of November 1917, at which time the term &quot;communist&quot; came into vogue for individuals and organizations espousing a revolutionary road to socialism.

===Contemporary social democracy===
[[File:Red rose.jpg|thumb|A red [[rose]] is often used as a symbol of social democracy, mostly adopted in the period after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/tam/aboutlogo.html Tament Library: About Our Logo]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The contemporary social democratic movement came into being through a break within the socialist movement in the early years of the twentieth century. Speaking broadly, this break can be described as a parting of ways between those who insisted upon political revolution as a precondition for the achievement of socialist goals and those who maintained that a gradual or evolutionary path to socialism was both possible and desirable.&lt;ref name=Berman&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www8.georgetown.edu/centers/cdacs//bermanpaper.pdf|title=Understanding Social Democracy|author=Berman, Sheri|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many related movements, including [[pacifism]], [[anarchism]], and [[syndicalism]], arose at the same time; these ideologies were often promulgated by individuals who split from the preexisting socialist movement, and held a variety of quite different objections to Marxism.

[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|right|[[Eduard Bernstein]], 1895.]]
One of the key founders of contemporary social democracy was [[Eduard Bernstein]], a proponent of [[Reformism|reformist]] socialism and a [[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]] of [[Marxism]]. Bernstein had originally been a Marxist and had held close association to [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]], but he saw flaws in Marxian thinking and began such criticism when he investigated and challenged the Marxian [[Materialism|materialist]] theory of history.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Sheri. ''Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein criticized Marxism's concept of &quot;irreconciliable [[class conflict]]s&quot; and Marxism's hostility to [[liberalism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Steger, Manfred B. 1997. Pp. 133&quot;&gt;Steger, Manfred B. ''The quest for evolutionary socialism: Eduard Bernstein and social democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Press Syndicate of the Cambridge University Press, 1997. Pp. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; Bernstein challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a &quot;socialist republic&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steger, Manfred B. 1997. Pp. 133&quot;/&gt;

On the issue of class conflict, Bernstein believed that economic class disparities between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]] would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steger, Manfred B. 1997. Pp. 133&quot;/&gt; Bernstein rejected the [[Marxism|Marxian]] principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms will improve the rights of the [[working class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Steger, Manfred B. 1997. Pp. 141&quot;/&gt; According to Bernstein, unlike orthodox Marxism social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society but instead sought to create a common development based on Western humanism.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell, Anthony Wright. ''Contemporary political ideologies''. 2nd edition. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000. Pp. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions but to act as an enterprise of extention and growth.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Eatwell, Anthony Wright. ''Contemporary political ideologies''. 2nd edition. Continuum International Publishing Group, 2000. Pp. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism, rather than class conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Berman, Sheri. ''Social Democracy and the Making of Europe's Twentieth Century''. Cambridge University Press, 2006. Pp. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; On the issue of class conflict and responding to the Marxian principle of dictatorship of the proletariat, Bernstein said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;No one thinks of destroying civil society as a community ordered in a civilized war. Quite to the contrary, Social Democracy does not want to break up civil society and make all its members proletarians together; rather, it ceaselessly labors to raise the worker from the social position of a proletarian to that of a citizen and thus make citizenship universal. It does not want to replace civil society with a proletarian society but a capitalist order of society with a socialist one.&quot; ''Eduard Bernstein''&lt;ref&gt;Steger, Manfred B. ''The quest for evolutionary socialism: Eduard Bernstein and social democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Press Syndicate of the Cambridge University Press, 1997. Pp. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Bernstein urged social democrats to be committed to a long-term agenda of transforming the capitalist economy to a socialist economy rather than a sudden upheaval of capitalism, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;Social democracy should neither expect nor desire the imminent collapse of the existing economic system â¦ What social democracy should be doing, and doing for a long time to come, is organize the working class politically, train it for democracy, and fight for any and all reforms in the state which are designed to raise the working class and make the state more democratic.&quot; ''Eduard Bernstein''&lt;ref&gt;Steger, Manfred B. ''The quest for evolutionary socialism: Eduard Bernstein and social democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Press Syndicate of the Cambridge University Press, 1997. Pp. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The social democrats, who had created the largest socialist organizations of that era, did not reject Marxism (and in fact claimed to uphold it), but a number of key individuals wanted to ''reform'' Marx's arguments in order to promulgate a less hostile criticism of capitalism. They argued that socialism should be achieved through evolution of society rather than revolution. Such views were strongly opposed by the revolutionary socialists, who argued that any attempt to reform capitalism was doomed to fail, for the reformers would be gradually corrupted and eventually turn into capitalists themselves.

Despite their differences, the reformist and revolutionary branches of socialism remained united through the [[Second International]] until the outbreak of [[World War I]]. A differing view on the legitimacy of the war proved to be the final straw for this tenuous union. The reformist socialists supported their respective national governments in the war, a fact that was seen by the revolutionary socialists as outright [[treason]] against the [[working class]]; in other words, the revolutionary socialists believed that this stance betrayed the principle that the workers of all nations should unite in overthrowing capitalism, and decried the fact that usually the lowest classes are the ones sent into the war to fight and die.

Bitter arguments ensued within socialist parties, as for example between [[Eduard Bernstein]], the leading reformist socialist, and [[Rosa Luxemburg]], one of the leading revolutionary socialists within the SPD in Germany. Eventually, after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917]], most of the world's socialist parties fractured. The reformist socialists kept the name social democrats, while many revolutionary socialists began calling themselves communists, and they soon formed the modern [[communism|Communist]] movement. These communist parties soon formed an exclusive Third Internationale known globally as the [[Comintern]].

By the 1920s, the doctrinal differences between social democrats and communists of all factions (be they Orthodox Marxists, Bolsheviks, or [[Mensheviks]]) had solidified.

===PostâWorld War II===
''See also [[History of socialism]]''.

Social democracy, as practiced in Europe in 1951, was a socialist movement supporting [[gradualism]]; the belief that gradual democratic reforms to capitalist economies will eventually succeed in creating a socialist economy,&lt;ref name=&quot;David Robertson 2004. Pp. 212&quot;&gt;David Robertson. ''A dictionary of modern politics''. 3rd edition. London, England, UK: Europa Publications, 2004. Pp. 212.&lt;/ref&gt; rejecting forcible imposition of socialism through revolutionary means.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Robertson 2004. Pp. 212&quot;/&gt; This gradualism has resulted in various [[far left]] groups, including [[Communism|communists]], of accusing social democracy of accepting the values of capitalist society and therefore not being a genuine form of socialism.&lt;ref name=&quot;David Robertson 2004. Pp. 212&quot;/&gt; Social democracy rejects the [[Marxism|Marxian]] principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] and the creation of a [[socialist state]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms will improve the rights of the [[working class]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Steger, Manfred B. 1997. Pp. 141&quot;&gt;Steger, Manfred B. ''The quest for evolutionary socialism: Eduard Bernstein and social democracy''. Cambridge, England, UK; New York, New York, USA; Melbourne, Victoria, Australia: Press Syndicate of the Cambridge University Press, 1997. Pp. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, a new international organization to represent social democracy and democratic socialism, the [[Socialist International]] in 1951. In the founding [[Frankfurt Declaration]], the Socialist International denounced both capitalism and [[Bolshevik]] communism. As for Bolshevik communism, the Declaration denounced it in articles 7, 8, and 9, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
* 7. Meanwhile, as Socialism advances throughout the world, new forces have arisen to threaten the movement towards freedom and social justice. Since the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Communism has split the International Labour Movement and has set back the realisation of Socialism in many countries for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialistinternational.org&quot;/&gt;

* 8. Communism falsely claims a share in the Socialist tradition. In fact it has distorted that tradition beyond recognition. It has built up a rigid theology which is incompatible with the critical spirit of Marxism.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialistinternational.org&quot;/&gt;

* 9. Where Socialists aim to achieve freedom and justice by removing the exploitation which divides men under capitalism, Communists seek to sharpen those class divisions only in order to establish the dictatorship of a single party.&lt;ref name=&quot;socialistinternational.org&quot;/&gt;

* 10. International Communism is the instrument of a new imperialism. Wherever it has achieved power it has destroyed freedom or the chance of gaining freedom. It is based on a militarist bureaucracy and a terrorist police. By producing glaring contrasts of wealth and privilege it has created a new class society. Forced labour plays an important part in its economic organisation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;socialistinternational.org&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the split between social democrats and communists, another split developed within social democracy, between those who still believed it was necessary to abolish capitalism (without revolution) and replace it with a socialist system through [[democracy|democratic]] [[parliamentary]] means, and those who believed that the capitalist system could be retained but needed dramatic reform, such as the [[nationalization]] of large businesses, the implementation of social programs ([[public education]], [[universal health care]], and the like) and the partial redistribution of wealth through the permanent establishment of a [[welfare state]] based on [[progressive taxation]].

Eventually, most social democratic parties have come to be dominated by the latter position and, in the postâ[[World War II]] era, have abandoned any commitment to abolish capitalism. For instance, in 1959, the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] adopted the [[Godesberg Program]], which rejected [[class struggle]] and [[Marxism]]. While &quot;social democrat&quot; and &quot;democratic socialist&quot; continued to be used interchangeably, by the 1990s in the English-speaking world at least, the two terms had generally come to signify respectively the latter and former positions.

In [[Italy]], the [[Italian Democratic Socialist Party]] was founded in 1947, and from 1948 on supported the idea of a centrist alliance. Since the late 1980s, many other social democratic parties have adopted the &quot;[[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]]&quot;, either formally or in practice. Modern social democrats are generally in favor of a [[mixed economy]], which is in many ways [[capitalism|capitalistic]], but explicitly defend governmental provision of certain social services.

Many social democratic parties have shifted emphasis from their traditional goals of social justice to [[human rights]] and [[environmentalism|environmental]] issues. In this, they are facing an increasing challenge from [[Green movement|Greens]], who view [[ecology]] as fundamental to peace, require reform of [[money supply]], and promote [[safe trade]] measures to ensure ecological integrity. In [[Germany]] in particular, Greens and Social Democrats have cooperated in so-called [[redâgreen alliance]]s. The present government in [[Norway]] is known as the [[Red-Green Coalition (Norway)|Red-Green Coalition]], whilst the opposition bloc in [[Sweden]] is the similarly titled [[Red-Greens (Sweden)|Red-Greens]], with social democratic parties forming the largest components of both alliances.

===Present===
Many of the policies espoused by social democrats in the first half of the 20th century have since been put into practice by social democratic governments throughout the industrialized world. Industries have been nationalized, public spending has seen a large long-term rise, and the role of the state in providing free-to-user or subsidized health care and education has increased greatly. Many of the reforms made by social democrats in Europe, such as the establishment of national health care services, have been embraced by liberals and conservatives, and there is no support outside of a radical fringe for a return to 19th-century levels of public spending and economic regulation. Even in the United States, where no major social democratic party exists, there are regulatory programmes (such as public health and environmental protection) and welfare programmes (such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medicarerights.org/maincontenthistory.html History of Medicare (United States)]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Medicaid]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/history/01_overview.asp? Brief History of Medicare and Medicaid (United States)]&lt;/ref&gt;) which enjoy bipartisan support.

However, since the 1980s, there has been a perception that social democracy has been on the retreat in the Western world, particularly in English-speaking countries, where social democratic values are arguably not as firmly rooted in local law and culture as elsewhere.  In recent years, a number of historically social democratic parties and governments have moved away from some traditional elements of social democracy by endorsing [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]] ideals and thus supporting both the [[privatization]] of certain state-controlled industries and services and the reduction of certain forms of regulation of the market.

The adoption of Third Way ideology by many social democrats has proved divisive within the broader social democratic community.  Traditional social democrats argue that Third Way ideology has caused the movement to become too [[centrism|centrist]], and even that the movement may be becoming [[centre-right]].  In general, apparent reversals in policy have encountered significant opposition among party members and core voters; many of the latter have claimed that their leaders have betrayed the principles of social democracy.&lt;ref name=sacrifices&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/uk_politics/2000/labour_centenary/651231.stm BBC News: Sacrifices in the scramble for power]&lt;/ref&gt;

Supporters of Third Way ideals argue that they merely represent a necessary or pragmatic adaptation of social democracy to the realities of the modern world: traditional social democracy thrived during the prevailing international climate of the post-war [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods consensus]], which collapsed in the 1970s. It has, moreover, become difficult for political parties in the developed world to win elections on a distinctively [[left-wing]] platform now that electorates are increasingly [[middle-class]], aspirational and [[consumerism|consumeristic]].

In Britain, where such an electorate rejected the Labour Party four times consecutively between 1979 and 1997, Third Way politician [[Tony Blair]] and his colleagues in the [[Labour Party (UK)|New Labour]] movement took the strategic decision to disassociate themselves publicly from the previous, explicitly democratic socialist incarnations of their party.  The Labour Government that came to power in 1997 continued the tradition that [[Margaret Thatcher]] started in the 1980s of selling out nationalized industries, and the income gap between the rich and the poor grew.  This challenge to traditional social democractic ideals alienated many [[backbenchers]], including some who advocated a less militant ideology of social democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/thinktanks/story/0,,1274517,00.html The Guardian: Rich-poor gap 'has widened under Blair' Monday August 2, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of new social democratic policies in this environment is the subject of wide-ranging debate within the left and centre-left. A number of political think-tanks, such as [[Policy Network]] and [[Wiardi Beckman Stichting]], have been active in facilitating and promoting this debate.

==Ideology==
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2007}}
In general, contemporary social democrats support:
* A [[mixed economy]] consisting of both private [[business|enterprise]] and publicly owned or subsidized programs of [[education]], [[universal health care]], [[child care]] and related [[social services]] for all citizens.
* An extensive system of [[social security]] (although usually not to the extent advocated by socialists), with the stated goal of counteracting the effects of poverty and insuring the citizens against loss of income following illness, unemployment or retirement.
* Government bodies that regulate private enterprise in the interests of [[worker]]s and [[consumer]]s by ensuring [[labor rights]] (i.e. supporting worker access to [[trade union]]s), [[consumer protection]]s, and fair market competition.
* [[Environmentalism]] and [[environmental protection]] laws; for example, funding for [[alternative energy]] resources and laws designed to combat [[global warming]].
* A value-added/[[progressive tax]]ation system to fund government expenditures.
* A [[Secularism|secular]] and a [[Social progressivism|socially progressive]] policy.
* [[Immigration]] and [[multiculturalism]].
* [[Fair trade]] over [[free trade]].
* A [[foreign policy]] supporting the promotion of [[democracy]], the protection of [[human rights]] and where possible, effective [[multilateralism]].
* Advocacy of [[social justice]], [[human rights]], [[social rights]], [[civil rights]] and [[civil liberties]].

==Political parties==
{{see also|List of social democratic parties}}
Social democratic [[political party|political parties]], which sometimes also include a democratic socialist element, operate in many developed and developing countries, including France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Spain, Australia, Israel and Brazil. Most European social democratic parties are members of the [[Party of European Socialists]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pes.org/content/view/11/48/lang,en/ PES Member Parties]&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the main political parties at the European level,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civitas.org.uk/eufacts/FSCIT/CIT3.htm EU facts: Party Politics in the EU]&lt;/ref&gt; and its parliamentary group the [[Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats]]. Globally, most social democratic parties worldwide are members of the [[Socialist International]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.socialistinternational.org/2Members/who.html#full Members of the Socialist International].&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cases, social democratic parties are the dominant (India, Portugal, Australia) or second-placed (Canada, Italy, Sweden, Germany, United Kingdom)&lt;ref&gt;In Canada, the CCF/NDP have been or are the government at the provincial level of governance, and as of [[Canadian federal election, 2011|2011]] form the [[Official Opposition (Canada)|Official Opposition]].&lt;/ref&gt; players within their respective political systems, though in some cases they are minor parties in federal politics (Ireland, Russia). The [[United States]] is the only industrial nation that does not currently have an official major social democratic party, although many consider large portions of the [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] and some liberal factions of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] to be social democratic. Some conservatives in the U.S. have accused President [[Barack Obama]] of being either a &quot;Democratic Socialist&quot; or &quot;Social Democrat&quot;, but Obama and the mainstream of the Democratic Party reject these accusations. Obama identifies with contemporary [[Progressivism in the United States|American Progressivism]]. Critics of Obama on the left identify him as generally holding [[centrism|centrist]] views.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/2010/01/21/the-trouble-with-barack.html The Trouble With Barack], [[Newsweek]], [[21 January]] [[2011]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newwest.net/main/article/obama_is_distressingly_centrist1/ Obama is Distressingly Centrist], Nick Grier, [[July 18]] 2010,New West&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/05/democrats-unhappy-with-ob_n_450754.html  Democrats Unhappy With Obama's Centrist Shift], [[Huffington Post]], 5 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1960s, many social democrats have broadened their objectives beyond the field of economic policy to include aspects of [[environmentalism]], [[feminism]], [[racial equality]] and [[multiculturalism]]. Another notable development is the tendency since the 1980s for social democratic parties to distance themselves from distinctively left-wing economic policies such as public ownership and [[dirigisme]], adopting instead policies that support a relatively lightly regulated economy and emphasize [[equality of opportunity]].

This trend, known as the [[Third Way (centrism)|Third Way]], is controversial among some of the left, many of whom argue that Third Way politicians (such as [[Tony Blair]] and [[Bill Clinton]])&lt;ref name=sacrifices/&gt; have moved too far to the centre, or even the centre-right. Others, such as the leadership of the UK Labour Party, reject this critique.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labour.org.uk/labour_policies Labour policies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
{{See also|Criticisms of welfare}}
Socialist critics of contemporary social democracy include [[Socialism|orthodox socialists]], [[Marxist socialism|Marxian socialists]], [[revolutionary socialists]], [[anarchists]] and various other schools of thought. The most common criticism leveled against social democracy by socialists is that social democratic programs maintain the capitalist system (and therefore retains its fundamental issues, such as [[Business cycle|cyclical fluctuations]] and social contradictions); these social democratic reformist policies are also used to help legitimize capitalism and exploitation by making it more equitable, thereby becoming an impediment to fundamental restructuring of the social and economic systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61&quot;&gt;''Market Socialism: The Debate Among Socialists'', by Schweickart, David; Lawler, James; Ticktin, Hillel; Ollman, Bertell. 1998. (P.60-61): &quot;The Marxist answers that market socialism cannot exist because it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the reserve army of labour, taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion).&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Marxists further argue that [[social democratic]] and welfare state policies limit the incentive system of the market by providing things such as minimum wages, unemployment insurance, taxing profits and reducing the reserve army of labor, resulting in reduced incentives for capitalists to invest in more production. In essence, social welfare policies cripple the capitalism and its incentive system and are thus unsustainable in the long-run.&lt;ref name=&quot;Market Socialism 1998. P.60-61&quot;/&gt; Marxists argue that the establishment of a [[Socialism (Marxism)|socialist mode of production]] is the only way to overcome these deficiencies.

Democratic socialists and [[libertarian socialists]] contend that social democracy has degenerated into pragmatic opportunism; rather than changing the world, social democracy merely changed itself to accommodate its tactics.&lt;ref name=sdvrds&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/anarchism/writers/anarcho/vote/vote2.html Socialism or Social democracy?] Anarchism WebSite.&lt;/ref&gt; These groups regard social democracy as an elitist and unrealistic movement for relying on electoral changes to reform capitalism, relying solely on liberal parliamentary (representation from above) rather than popular representation and spontaneous organization from the grassroots-level.&lt;ref name=sdvrds&gt;[http://www.socialistparty-usa.org/sdvrds.html Social Democracy Versus Revolutionary Democratic Socialism] by J. David Edelstein.&lt;/ref&gt;
