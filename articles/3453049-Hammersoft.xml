==Character development==
===Characterisation===
{{cquote|Lovely Laurel is not your typical vicar's wife but is very supportive of her husband Ashley. She's well known in the village for her quirky fashion sense. She's very determined and even though a lot of bad things have happened to her she still remains a happy, positive woman who enjoys hanging out with her mates, especially Nicola.|4=''[[itv.com]] on Laurel''.&lt;ref name=pro&gt;{{cite web|title=Laurel Thomas - Charlotte Bellamy|url=http://www.itv.com/emmerdale/characters/laurel-thomas/|work=''[[itv.com]]''|publisher=([[ITV plc]])|accessdate=19 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bellamy said Laurel is not your &quot;typical vicar's wife&quot; because she acts &quot;a bit daft and scatty&quot;. Bellamy said the best thing about Laurel is her drunken scenes.&lt;ref name=pro/&gt; As Laurel is married to a vicar, she has to be seen always act &quot;nice, sweet and kind&quot;. There are no limits to Laurel when she drinks and &quot;she really lets her hair down.&quot; Laurel's best friend is [[Nicola King|Nicola Blackstock]] ([[Nicola Wheeler]]). Bellamy said she is &quot;a bit horrible to her&quot; but Laurel really loves her.&lt;ref name=pro/&gt;

While interviewed by the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'', Bellamy said Laurel's likeability is her &quot;kind-hearted and unassuming&quot; persona. However, Laurel is not afraid to speak her mind but would never &quot;intentionally hurt someone&quot;.&lt;ref name=mail&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Laura|title=Cover Story: I won't rest on Laurels when it comes to big white wedding.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Cover+Story%3a+I+won't+rest+on+Laurels+when+it+comes+to+big+white...-a0127910535|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=30 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Laurel is often the serial's source for light comic relief. Bellamy opined that it played an important role in ''Emmerdale's'' sucsess.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; Laurel has many different elements. She is funny and makes people laugh. Having an &quot;emotional soul&quot; means she has the capacity to be very loving. These personality traits have made the role enjoyable for Bellamy to portray.&lt;ref name=wedding&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Laura|title=It's Laurel's dream day..but I'm glad she didn't design a dress; Charlotte Bellamy on the long-awaited Emmerdale nuptials|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/It's+Laurel's+dream+day..but+I'm+glad+she+didn't+design+a+dress%3b...-a0138102544|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=30 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellamy later said &quot;Laurel's a simple soul with a good heart and she deserves to be really happy.&quot;&lt;ref name=lol/&gt;

===Relationship with Ashley Thomas===
{{Quote box |width=20% |align=right |bgcolor=#cccfff |quote=&quot;They are the mismatched couple who have raised many of Emmerdale's laughs as viewers have followed their rocky road to romance.&quot;&lt;ref name=sad&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Laura|title=Dale vicar in hell as baby Dan dies; The big interview Soap star John reveals playing a grieving father left him shattered in real life|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Dale+vicar+in+hell+as+baby+Dan+dies%3b+The+big+interview+Soap+star+John...-a0174902245|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland){{!}}Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=7 September 2011|date=17 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;|source=âLaura Davidson of the ''[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]'' on Laurel and Ashley. (2008)}}
Laurel's first relationship develops when she falls in love with [[Ashley Thomas]] ([[John Middleton (actor)|John Middleton]]). He is initially oblivious to her feelings, though later develops feelings for her too.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; When Ashley proposes to Laurel, she tells him to wait until she returns from volunteer work in [[Tanzania]]. Bellamy said it proved Laurel had progressed into &quot;her own woman&quot; and became more confident. She hoped Laurel would marry Ashley because it has been &quot;all she's ever wanted in life.&quot; She added that Laurel deserved an happy ending, but highlighted the fact nothing is ever straightforward in Laurel's life.&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; Middleton said that Laurel and Ashley are well suited to one another, branding her as Ashley's soul mate.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt;

Upon Laurel's return, scriptwriters decided to complicate the storyline by introducing obstacles in their pursuit of marriage. One of these was using curate [[Ethan Blake]] (Liam O'Brien) to attempt to ruin their relationship. The next was the funeral of Laurel's surrogate grandfather [[Seth Armstrong]] ([[Stan Richards]]). Though Laurel decides to &quot;live life to the full&quot; and marry Ashley.&lt;ref name=wedding/&gt; Instead of having her own wedding dress, she wears a dress belonging to [[Betty Eagleton]] ([[Paula Tilbrook]]). Like Seth, Betty has been written and portrayed as a grandparent figure for Laurel. Bellamy said it was probably for the best because Laurel is &quot;not exactly understated in her dress sense.&quot; She also said she was glad to see her character get the happy ending due to the many &quot;ups and downs&quot; she has been forced to endure. Bellamy opined that Laurel would want children next and called her a good potential mother figure.&lt;ref name=wedding/&gt;

The serial later began scripting marital problems for the pair. Laurel helps Ashley's niece [[Jasmine Thomas]] ([[Jenna-Louise Coleman]]) with her sexuality issues. Laurel agrees to keep it a secret from Ashley. Coleman said Laurel acts like a mother figure for Jasmine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Laura|title=It wasn't easy telling my mum I was going to be a lesbian on TV|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/IT+WASN'T+EASY+TELLING+MY+MUM+I+WAS+GOING+TO+BE+A+LESBIAN+ON+TV+-+'+I...-a0146026401|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=21 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jasmine later has an affair with [[Cain Dingle]] ([[Jeff Hordley]]) and Laurel hides this from Ashley too. Ashley is furious with Laurel when he learns the truth, Middleton predicted it would have a bad effect on their marriage. He said &quot;Ashley really does love Laurel, although he feels really let down by her at the moment.&quot;&lt;ref name=cain&gt;{{cite web|last=Davidson|first=Laura|title=I though about becoming a priest but girls put paid to that; Emmerdale star John is more of an action man than mild vicar.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/showbiz%3a+I+THOUGHT+ABOUT+BECOMING+A+PRIEST+BUT+GIRLS+PUT+PAID+TO...-a0147708430|work=[[Sunday Mail (Scotland)|Sunday Mail]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=2 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2006, Laurel discovers that she is pregnant. Bellamy was not required to wear any padding to make the pregnancy appear legitimate, as she was pregnant off-screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Laws|first=Roz|title=TV &amp; Soaps: Emmerdale|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/tv+%26+soaps%3a+emmerdale.-a0155358587|work=[[Sunday Mercury]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=7 September 2011|date=3 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bellamy said it was a surprise that they both fell pregnant at the same time and &quot;you couldn't make it up&quot;.&lt;ref name=lol/&gt; Laurel was temporarily written out of the serial while Bellamy took her maternity leave.&lt;ref name=second/&gt; When Bellamy returned to filming she had lost her baby weight. She said it was strange to then have to wear &quot;a massive fake bump&quot; and be pregnant again.&lt;ref name=lol/&gt; Upon Laurel's return she gives birth. Middleton told the ''[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]'' that the birth is typical &quot;Laurel and Ashley - it's absolute chaos&quot;. After becoming stranded at the church she arrives to a maternity ward that is over capacity.&lt;ref name=birth/&gt; Bellamy added &quot;It wouldn't have been believable if Laurel had just given birth normally.

==Reception==
Laura Davidson of the ''Sunday Mail'' described Laurel as one of ''Emmerdale's'' most popular characters, citing &quot;dippy and loveable Laurel&quot; as a firm favourite. She opined Laurel remained true to her &quot;unpredictable&quot; nature when she left Ashley without an answer to his proposal. Though said &quot;teary-eyed viewers&quot; thought she would have said yes &quot;faster than you can say 'white wedding'.&quot;&lt;ref name=mail/&gt; Davidson later opined that the &quot;dippy cleaner makes a truly beautiful bride.&quot; She added that an army of fans cheered when the &quot;scatterbrain character finally tied the knot with her dream man.&quot;&lt;ref name=wedding/&gt; Jane Simon of the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' said ''Emmerdale'' had some &quot;fabulously random pairings&quot; and such as the &quot;unlikely&quot; love-trinagle with Laurel, Kelly and Ethan could be titled &quot;The Cleaning Lady, the Scrubber and the Dirty Little Liar.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simon|first=Jane|title=We Love Telly!: Soapwatch Emmerdale ITV1, 7pm.|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/We+Love+Telly!%3a+SOAPWATCH+EMMERDALE+ITV1%2c+7pm.-a0137655884|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=([[Trinity Mirror]])|accessdate=6 September 2011|date=18 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dek Hogan writing for [[Digital Spy]] said ''Emmerdale'' had done a good job tackling the issue of cot death. He noted that while Laurel has often been used for comic relief, Bellamy proved to be outstanding in the &quot;moving storyline&quot;. He also branded the episode as a &quot;tear-jerker&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hogan|first=Dek|title=Spare us the Cutter|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/dekstvdiary/a90087/spare-us-the-cutter.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hachette Filipacchi UK]])|accessdate=7 September 2011|date=25 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
