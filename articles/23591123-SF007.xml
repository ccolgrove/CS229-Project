===RUNZ Framework===

== Reception and adoption ==
Previous versions of Super OS has received some positive reviews, with [[Softpedia]] saying of Super Ubuntu 2008.11: &quot;The 'super powers' of Super Ubuntu can be translated into the inclusion of applications, tools and technologies that are missing from a standard Ubuntu 8.10 (Intrepid Ibex) installation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nestor, Marius. [http://news.softpedia.com/news/It-039-s-a-Bird-It-039-s-a-Plane-It-039-s-Super-Ubuntu-101085.shtml It's a Bird, It's a Plane, It's Super Ubuntu] on [[Softpedia]], January 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Super Ubuntu 2008.11 was a featured download on [[Lifehacker]], which said &quot;It's basically just a re-compiled version of the official Ubuntu distribution, but with a whole bunch of features included that save you the time of grabbing them yourself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Purdy, Kevin. [http://lifehacker.com/5123360/super-ubuntu-rolls-multimedia-and-helpful-extras-into-ubuntu Super Ubuntu Rolls Multimedia and Helpful Extras into Ubuntu] on [[Lifehacker]], January 5, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Super OS 9.10 was also announced on Softpedia as &quot;Karmic Koala with Muscles&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Nestor, Marius. [http://news.softpedia.com/news/Super-OS-9-10-Karmic-Koala-with-Muscles-130795.shtml Super OS 9.10 - Karmic Koala with Muscles] on [[Softpedia]], December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{As of|2011|09}}, Super OS ranked 38th on the twelve-month page hit ranking of [[DistroWatch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/stats.php?section=popularity DistroWatch - Linux Distributions - Facts and Figures]&lt;/ref&gt;  However, page hits on Distrowatch are not relative to the actual number of users of a distro, so are no indication of popularity.

==Future releases==
According to the main developer, Super OS 11.10 is expected to have more applications, better localization and better [[Virtual Machine]] support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hacktolive.org/blog/2011/preparing-super-os-11-10/ Preparing Super OS 11.10]&lt;/ref&gt;
