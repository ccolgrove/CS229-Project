'''Parallels Desktop for Mac''' by [[Parallels, Inc.]], is software providing [[hardware virtualization]] for [[Macintosh]] computers with [[Intel]] processors.

==Overview==
[[Parallels, Inc.]] is a developer of desktop and server [[Platform virtualization|virtualization]] software.

===Historical===
Released on June 15, 2006, it was the first software product to bring virtualization mainstream to Macintosh computers utilizing the [[AppleâIntel architecture]] ([[Connectix]] [[VirtualPC]] was released in 1997 for [[PowerPC]] Macs).

Its name initially was '[[Parallels Workstation]] for Mac OS X', which was consistent with the company's corresponding [[Linux]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] products. This name was not well received within the Mac community, where some felt that the name, particularly the term âworkstation,â evoked the aesthetics of a Windows product. Parallels agreed: â''Since we've got a great Mac product, we should make it look and sound like a Mac product...''â, it was therefore renamed âParallels Desktop for Macâ.&lt;ref name=&quot;pwfmoxinpdfmatrcirfd&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Parallels Workstation for Mac OS X is now Parallels Desktop for Macâand the release candidate is ready for download! |url=http://parallelsvirtualization.blogspot.com/2006/05/parallels-workstation-for-mac-os-x-is.html |author=Rudolph, Ben |work=The Official Parallels Virtualization Blog |date=2006-05-18 |accessdate=2006-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 10, 2007, Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac was awarded âBest in Showâ at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Rudolph, Ben |url=http://www.parallels.com/en/news/id,10614 |title=Parallels Desktop for Mac Update RC Wins MacWorld Expo 2007 &quot;Best in Show&quot; |publisher=Parallels, Inc. |accessdate=2007-01-10 |date=2006-05-18 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070116232507/http://www.parallels.com/en/news/id,10614 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Technical===
Parallels Desktop for Mac is a hardware emulation virtualization software, using [[hypervisor]] technology that works by mapping the host computerâs hardware resources directly to the virtual machineâs resources. Each virtual machine thus operates identically to a standalone computer, with virtually all the resources of a physical computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/files/upload/Parallels%20Desktop%20for%20Mac%20Updated%20Datasheet.pdf |title=Parallels Desktop for Mac Datasheet |publisher=Parallels, Inc. |accessdate=2007-01-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070307114844/http://www.parallels.com/files/upload/Parallels+Desktop+for+Mac+Updated+Datasheet.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all guest virtual machines use the same hardware drivers irrespective of the actual hardware on the host computer, virtual machine instances are highly portable between computers. For example, a running virtual machine can be stopped, copied to another physical computer, and restarted.

Parallels Desktop for Mac is able to virtualize a full set of standard PC hardware, including&lt;ref name=&quot;Feature&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/sr/ |title=System Requirements |publisher=Parallels, Inc. |accessdate=2007-01-02 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061221023133/http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/sr/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A virtualized [[Central processing unit|CPU]] of the same type as the host's physical processor,
* [[ACPI]] compliance system,
* A generic [[motherboard]] compatible with the [[Intel]] i965 chipset,

* Up to eight [[USB|USB 2.0]] devices and two USB 1.1 devices,
* An [[AC'97]]-compatible sound card.
* A 104-key Windows enhanced keyboard and a [[PS/2 connector|PS/2]] wheel mouse.

Note that no mention is made of support for the following host interfaces:
* [[Bluetooth]]
* [[Firewire]]
* [[Fibre Channel]]
* [[PC Card]]
* [[SCSI]]
* [[Serial Attached SCSI|SAS]]
* [[eSATA]]
* [[TOSLINK]]

==Version 2.5==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Parallels coherence.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Parallels Coherence]] --&gt;
The first official release of version 2.5 was on February 27, 2007, as build 3186.

Version 2.5 brought support for USB 2.0 devices, which expanded the number of USB devices supported at native speed, including support for built in [[iSight]] USB web-cams. The amount of video RAM allocated to the guest OS was made adjustable, up to 32MB. Full featured CD/DVD drives arrived in this version, which allowed the user to burn disks directly in the virtual environment, and play any copy-protected CD or DVD as one would in Mac OS X. In addition, a shared clipboard and drag-drop support between Mac OS X and the guest OS was implemented. This version brought the ability for users with a Windows XP installation to upgrade to Windows Vista from within the VM environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/ga/features/|title=Desktop Release Features|publisher=Parallels Web |accessdate=2007-02-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070302073922/http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/ga/features/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new feature known as '''Coherence''' was added, which removed the Windows chrome, desktop, and the virtualization frames to create a more seamless desktop environment between Windows and Mac OS X applications. This version also allowed users to boot their existing [[Boot Camp (software)|Boot Camp]] Windows XP partitions, which eliminated the need to have multiple Windows installations on their Mac. A tool called '''Parallels Transporter''' was included to allow users to migrate their Windows PC, or existing [[VMware]] or [[Virtual PC]] VMs to Parallels Desktop for Mac.

===Netsys lawsuit===

In 2007, the German company Netsys GmbH sued Parallels' German distributor Avanquest for copyright violation, claiming that Parallels Desktop and Parallels Workstation are directly based on a line of products called âtwoOStwoâ that Parallels developed on paid commission for Netsys, of which it says, Netsys has been assigned all copyrights.  Additionally, the lawsuit claimed that Parallels Desktop 2.5's compatibility with âtwoOStwoâ showed that the two software products are run by essentially the same functional core.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virtual-strategy.com/article/articleview/2042/1/2/ Virtual Strategy Magazine â Virtualization's Dirty Laundry Aired in German Court Room&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  When Netsys lost its initial urgency proceeding, in which it requested a temporary injunction from the Landgericht district court of Berlin, it filed a new suit.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/05/31/netsys.sues.avanquest MacNN | Netsys sues Parallels German distributor&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Version 3.0==
[[Image:Parallels Desktop graphics.jpg|thumb|right|260px|Parallels Desktop features hardware accelerated 3D graphics, and runs many Windows games, including [[Crysis]], shown here.]]

On June 7, 2007 build 4124 was released as the first publicly available version of Desktop 3.0.

Version 3.0 retained all of the functionality from previous versions and added new features and tools. Support for [[DirectX]] 8.1 and [[OpenGL]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/3d/ |title=Parallels Desktop for Mac 3.0 3D Graphics |publisher=SWSoft Parallels |date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; was added, allowing Mac users to play some Windows games without the need to boot into Windows with Boot Camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.insidemacgames.com/features/view.php?ID=486 |title=Inside Mac Games Interviews Parallels |last=Wang |first=Anthony |publisher=Inside Mac Games |date=2006-12-11 |accessdate=2006-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new feature called '''SmartSelect''' offers cross OS file and application integration by allowing the user to open Windows files with Mac OS X programs and vice versa. '''Parallels Explorer''' was introduced, which allows the user to browse their Windows system files in Mac OS X without actually launching Windows. A new snapshot feature was included, allowing one to restore their virtual machine environment to a previous state in case of issues. Further, Parallels added a security manager to limit the amount of interaction between the Windows and Mac OS X installations. This version included a long awaited ''complete'' âParallels tools'â driver suite for Linux guest operating systems. Therefore integration between Mac OS X and Linux guest-OS's has been greatly improved.&lt;ref name=3.0&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/features/ |title=Parallels Desktop for Mac 3.0 overview |publisher=SWSoft Parallels |date=2007-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the addition of numerous new features, tools and added functionality, the first iteration of Desktop for Mac 3.0 may be missing some of features that Parallels had planned for it. A Parallels, Inc. representative stated at [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|MacWorld]] in January 2007 that version 3.0 would bring accelerated graphics, âmulti-core virtual machines/virtual SMP, some SCSI support, a more Mac-like feel, as well as a more sophisticated coherence mode, dubbed Coherence 2.0â.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macworld&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/journals/apple.ars/2007/1/11/6582 |title=Ars at Macworld: Interview with Parallels |last=Chang |first=Jacqui |publisher=Arstechica |date=2007-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; While accelerated graphics have materialised,  Coherence, as well as the overall look and feel of Parallels Desktop for Mac has only changed slightly. Also, [[SCSI]] support has not been implemented.&lt;ref name=3d&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/3d/ |title=Parallels Desktop for Mac 3.0 overview |publisher=SWSoft Parallels |date=2007-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is currently unknown if these features have been abandoned altogether, or if they will show up in a later build of version 3.0.

Build 4560, released on July 17, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;Rudolph, Ben (2007-07-17).

Retrieved on 2007-07-17.&lt;/ref&gt; added an imaging tool which allowed users to add capacity to their virtual disks.

===Feature update===
[[Image:Parallels Coherence + Expose.png|thumb|right|260px|Parallels Coherence in ExposÃ©]]
Build 5160, released on September 11, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://parallelsvirtualization.blogspot.com/2007/09/parallels-desktop-30-feature-update-is.html |title=Parallels Desktop 3.0 Feature Update is LIVE! |publisher=Official Parallels Blog |date=2007-09-01 |accessdate=2007-09-12 |last=Rudolph |first=Ben}}&lt;/ref&gt;
added some new features and updated some current features.

The release focused on updates to Coherence, with support for [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]], window shadows, transparent windows, and the ability to overlap several Windows and Mac windows. Further, Parallels' Image Tool was updated to allow  one to change their virtual hard disk format between plain and expanding.
Parallels Explorer was updated to allow for one to automatically mount an offline VM hard drive to the Mac desktop. Some new features added are [[iPhone]] support in Windows, allowing [[iTunes]] in Windows to [[Synchronization|sync]] with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parallels.com/en/products/desktop/beta |title=Beta Announcement Parallels Desktop 3.0 for Mac Feature Update |publisher=Parallels, Inc. |date=2007-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can now mirror desktops or other folders. Further, Mac drives can now be mapped by Windows and sound devices can now be changed â[[on the fly]]â. Up to 2 GB of RAM can be allocated to a virtual machine, with a total of 4 GB of RAM available.&lt;ref name=MEM&gt;[http://forums.parallels.com/thread16150.html Parallels Desktop 3.0 build 5160 features and improvements]&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallels Desktop for Mac Build 5608 added support for guest Parallels Tools for Linux in the latest Linux distributions (including Ubuntu 8).  It also added support for running 3D graphics in Windows virtual machines on Mac OS X Leopard 10.5.3.

===Use of code from the Wine project===
According to Parallels' Licensing page, Desktop for Mac version 3.0 contains [[Direct3D]] code that was originally developed by the [[Wine (software)|Wine]] [[open source]] project.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parallels.com/en/support/desktop/licensing/ Licensing information].  Parallels, Inc.  Retrieved on 2007-07-16.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wine software is licensed under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]], which required Parallels to release the [[source code]].  Parallels released the modified source code on July 2, 2007, about 2 weeks after the promised release date.&lt;ref&gt;DÃ¶singer, Stefan (2007-07-03).
