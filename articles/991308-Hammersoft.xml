'''Sarikei''' is a town, and the capital of the ''Sarikei District'' (985 square kilometers) in [[Sarikei Division]], [[Sarawak]], east [[Malaysia]]. It is located on the [[Rajang River]], near where the river empties into the [[South China Sea]]. The district population (year 2010 census) was 56,798. The population is culturally mixed, with mostly [[Iban people|Iban]], [[Melanau]], [[Malay people|Malay]] and [[Overseas Chinese|Chinese]] predominating.

The economy of the town is primarily agricultural, and Sarikei is famed for its [[pineapples]] and its [[black pepper|pepper]]. The center of town has many old Chinese shophouses from the 1930s. It is also a major transportation hub for traffic on both the [[Pan Borneo Highway]] and the Rajang river. Anybody traveling by road or express boat from [[Kuching]] to [[Sibu]] must pass through Sarikei.

The most distinctive feature of the bustling waterfront is a 3.6 m high pineapple statue.

The town itself consists of a main road, Repok Road which is bisected by another road leading to the new development in Kampung Seberang.

==History and background==
The early history of Sarikei can be traced as far back as the early 19th century. There are many historical events to show its existence. For example, Rajah [[James Brooke]] first visited Sarikei on 30 April 1845. There were also resistance from the local people towards the Brookeâs administration, including the burning of Sarikei on 4.1.1856 and the Julau Expedition on 19 June 1856, which was led by Sir [[Charles Brooke]] to counter the native resistance in Julau.

The establishment of Sarikei as a new Division was mainly based on security consideration. Datu Wilson Baya Dandot, The Deputy State Secretary (Planning and Development) in his article entitled: Sarawakâs Unique Administrative Identity: Establishment of Divisional, District and Sub-District Machinery For Enhancing Development Administration said that the establishment of Sarikei as the Sixth Division then was due to the security threats posed by the communist insurgency which was at its height at that time. It was felt that with the establishment of a new Sarikei Division the government would be able to concentrate and focus more in its efforts to contain and counter the security problem in the area.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{

Also known as the &quot;food basket&quot; for the Land of the Hornbills, Sarikei started as a small village comprising the &quot;Segalang&quot; community and a few rows of Chinese shophouses. From a dead town, the once isolated and remote Sarikei has progressed and the people now enjoy infrastructural facilities and economic opportunities.

==Famous person==
* [Syarif Masahor]] - Malay warrior and the Resident of Sarikei during [[White Rajahs]] era
* [Panglima Rentap] - [[Rentap]](died 1863) was a famous Dayak (Iban) warrior in Sarawak, Malaysia during the Brooke White Rajahs era in that state. &quot;Rentap&quot; in Iban means &quot;Worldshaker&quot;. He was known as &quot;Raja Darat&quot; or &quot;Raja Ulu&quot;.

Essentially, Rentap's rebellion was due to the White Rajah's or James Brooke's action of eliminating the Ibans in Skrang because he thought they were pirates. Being a leader of the Ibans there, Rentap took the subsequent action of attacking James Brooke's fort at Skrang River called Nanga Skrang. Brooke then burnt Rentap's village after he successfully drove James Brooke's side out of Skrang. He retreated to Bukit Sadok and built himself a fort after a defeat at Sungai Lang, Ulu Skrang by James Brooke in 1854. There he gained a reputation and thwarted many plans by James Brooke to control the Skrang and Saribas areas. Only after many attempts and with the aid of bigger cannons did James Brooke defeat Rentap in 1861. Though defeated, Rentap never officially surrendered. He retreated to Bukit Sibau, Ulu Wak, Pakan District and died in same place. In Malaysia, he is not only renowned in Sarawak, but he is also a national hero in both Sabah and the Peninsula as both a national hero and a freedom fighter.

Rentap's battle cry was Agi Idup, Agi Ngelaban!! which means I will fight as long as I will live!!. This legendary battle cry later became Malaysia's Royal Ranger Regiment motto.
