The '''University of Alabama at Birmingham''' ('''UAB''') is a [[Public university#United States|public university]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] in the [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]]. Developing from an [[Agricultural extension|extension center]] established in 1936, the institution became an autonomous institution in 1969 and is today one of three institutions in the [[University of Alabama System]]. UAB offers some 140 programs of study through 12 academic divisions leading to various [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]], [[doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree]]s.

UAB offers over 140 programs of study in 12 academic divisions leading to [[bachelor's degree|bachelor's]], [[master's degree|master's]], [[doctorate|doctoral]] and [[professional degree|professional]] degrees in the [[social sciences|social]] and [[behavioral sciences]], [[liberal arts]], [[business]], [[education]], [[engineering]], health-related fields such as medicine, dentistry, optometry and nursing and public health. The school is highly renowned for its medical research and natural sciences programs. 

The '''UAB Health System''', one of the largest [[academic medical center]]s in the United States, is affiliated with the university.  [[UAB Hospital]] sponsors residency programs in various medical specialties, including [[internal medicine]], neurology, surgery, [[radiology]], and [[anesthesiology]]. UAB Hospital is the only ACS verified [[Level I trauma center]] in Alabama, as rated by the [[American College of Surgeons]] Trauma Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facs.org/trauma/verified.html American College of Surgeons Verified Trauma Centers]&lt;/ref&gt;

UAB is the state's largest employer, with more than 18,000 faculty and staff and over 53,000 jobs at the university and in the health system. An estimated 10 percent of the jobs in the [[Birmingham-Hoover Metropolitan Area]] and 1 in 33 jobs in the state of Alabama are directly or indirectly related to UAB. Overall, the university's overall annual economic impact was estimated to be $4.6 billion annual impact in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;about&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://main.uab.edu/show.asp?durki=699 |title=UAB â About â The University of Alabama at Birmingham |accessdate=December 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=econ-impact&gt;{{cite news |title=University of Alabama at Birmingham's impact on state tallied at $4.6 billion a year |author=Hannah Wolfson |url=http://blog.al.com/spotnews/2010/11/university_of_alabama_at_birmi_18.html |newspaper= |date= November 10, 2010 |accessdate=December 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Fall of 2011, the University of Alabama at Birmingham enrolled 17,575 students from over 110 countries, including 1,605 freshmen. The university president is [[Carol Garrison|Dr. Carol Z. Garrison]].

==History==
[[File:UAB Obelisk.jpg|thumb|right|UAB Obelisk]]
In 1936, in response to the rapid growth of the Birmingham metropolitan area and the need for the population to have easy access to a university education, the [[University of Alabama]] created a '''Birmingham Extension Center'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Chronology&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=UAB Chronology |url=http://www.uab.edu/archives/chron |accessdate=May 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The center initially operated in an old house in downtown Birmingham at 2131 6th Avenue North and enrolled 116 students.  In 1945, the newly-created four-year [[University of Alabama School of Medicine]] moved from the [[University of Alabama|Tuscaloosa campus]] to Birmingham and took over management of Jefferson and Hillman hospitals. In the post-war boom, enrollment at the extension center increased steadily; it stood at 1,856 by 1957.  The medical center also grew.  By 1959, research grants, training grants, and fellowships exceeded $1,000,000, and ground was broken for a new Children's Hospital.

By the 1960s, it grew readily apparent that the extension center was becoming a university in its own right.  An engineering building was built close to the medical center in 1962. In 1966, the Extension Center and the School of Medicine were merged into the '''University of Alabama in Birmingham'''.  An Advisory Board for UAB was created in 1967. In 1969, the legislature created the [[University of Alabama System]] and elevated UAB to the status of an autonomous institution within the system, which also included UA (in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]) and the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] (UAH) in [[Huntsville, Alabama|Huntsville]]. Dr. Joseph Volker was named the first president of UAB.

In the 1970s, the university began a period of rapid growth.  Enrollment at the beginning of the decade stood at 6,629, including 2,724 women.  To accommodate the growing student population, UAB acquired much land in the [[Southside (Birmingham)
Southside]] and began a steady expansion of the physical plant. UAB Mini Park (the predecessor to UAB Green) was dedicated in 1977. The university created an intercollegiate athletic program, joined the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and began fielding teams beginning with golf in 1970 and men's basketball in 1978.  The university's name was changed to the '''University of Alabama at Birmingham''' in 1984.

By 1990, UAB had awarded its 50,000th degree. In 1992, ''U.S. News and World Report'' named UAB as the #1 up-and-coming university in the United States. In 1993, UAB's economic impact on the Birmingham region was estimated at more than $1.5 billion per year (the figure would be $2 billion per year by 1998). In 1994, UAB became the first Alabama university to achieve &quot;Research University I&quot; status in the Carnegie Foundation classification.

UAB celebrated its 40th anniversary as an independent university in 2009. When classes began, UAB had the largest enrollment in the schoolâs 40-year history.  Freshman enrollment was up 19% and graduate student enrollment hit its largest number ever.  A record 18,047 students enrolled in courses at UAB.

==Campus==
[[File:Uab campbell hall fountain.jpg|thumb|right|A fountain in front of Campbell Hall]]

UAB is located in the [[Southside (Birmingham)|Southside]] neighborhood of downtown Birmingham. Spanning around 83 blocks, the UAB campus blends seamlessly with the urban character of the Southside.  The campus is roughly rectangular in shape with University Blvd serving as the main axis of the rectangle and Campus Green serving as the center of the campus.

The campus can be divided into three sections.  The medical center occupies most of the campus east of Campus Green.  The medical center is the home to the various health science schools and their teaching facilities, including the UAB Health System (UABHS). The medical center overlaps with the larger Birmingham Medical District where, in addition to UABHS, non-UAB affialiated hospitals such as the VA Medical Center Birmingham, Children's Hospital of Alabama and Cooper Green Mercy Hospital are located.

The part of campus from Campus Green west and University Boulevard south is the academic center of the campus, as well as the center of student life on campus.  The majority of the university's academic, student life, residential and cultural facilities are located on this part of campus.  It is anchored by Campus Green, which was developed between 2000 and 2007 as the centerpiece of the move to convert the school from its traditional commuter school feel into a traditional residential campus.

[[File:CAMPUS GREEN.jpg|thumb|Students relaxing on Campus Green]]

Athletics facilities, including [[Bartow Arena]], are located on the far western side of campus.  [[Legion Field]], located a few miles west of campus, is the current home of the football team, but planning is underway for an on-campus football stadium adjacent to Bartow Arena.

Since 1969, UAB has undergone extensive growth and is sometimes jokingly referred to as &quot;The University that Ate Birmingham&quot; {{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}, and construction projects are common across campus. Current projects that are in planning, recently completed, or under construction include:&lt;ref name=&quot;UAB Facilities&quot;&gt;{{cite report|title=Project Status Reports, UAB Facilities Division, Major Capital Projects |url=http://www.fab.uab.edu/Project%20Status%20Reports/Major%20Capital%20Projects_old.pdf |date=May 31, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part-time and transfer student comprise a sizable portion of the undergraduate student body. The undergraduate instructional program provided a balance between professional programs of study and the liberal arts (meaning the number of degrees awards in the two areas were similar), and there a high level of co-existence between the graduate and undergraduate programs (meaning that the majority of undergraduate program had graduate degree program counterparts).  The university has a &quot;very high level&quot; of research activity and has a graduate instructional program heavily emphasizing doctorates in [[STEM fields]] as well as health and veterinary sciences professional programs.  UAB is only one of 108 universities (and the only one of two in Alabama) with the &quot;very high level&quot; research rating in the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;carnegie2&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title= Carnegie Classifications - Standard Listings |url=http://classifications.carnegiefoundation.org/lookup_listings/srp.php?clq={%22basic2005_ids%22%3A%2215%22}&amp;start_page=index.php |accessdate=June 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academic calendar is based on the [[semester#United States|semester system]], which divides the [[academic year#Academic year|academic year]], lasting from mid-August to early May, into two 15-week semesters (fall and spring) and the summer.

===Greek life===
Seventeen Greek Letter Organization (GLOs) are currently active on campus, with one additional in process of colonizing.  Three governing bodies oversee the operations of university-sanctioned GLOs.  These bodies act as umbrella organizations over the member GLOs. Among the differences between the governing bodies, the most important distinction are recruitment process and policies.

The Interfraternity Council (IFC) governs men's GLOs (also known as fraternities).  Current members are [[Delta Sigma Phi|ÎÎ£Î¦]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha|ÎÎ§Î]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon|TKE]] and [[Pi Kappa Phi|Î KÎ¦]].

The National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC) governs historically black GLOs. Currently-active member fraternities are [[Alpha Phi Alpha]] (Iota Nu chapter, founded at UAB in 1974), [[Kappa Alpha Psi]] (Kappa Kappa chapter, 1980), [[Omega Psi Phi]] (Kappa Delta chapter, 1972) and [[Phi Beta Sigma]]. Currently-active member sororities are [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]] (Iota Phi chapter, 1975), [[Delta Sigma Theta]] (Iota Lambda chapter, 1972), [[Sigma Gamma Rho]] (Xi Mu chapter, 1996) and [[Zeta Phi Beta]] (1990).

===Student Media===
Kaleidoscope is the official student newspaper of The University of Alabama at Birmingham. Started in 1967, the weekly 8,000 circulation paper is a broadsheet published on Tuesdays during Fall, Spring and Summer semesters. The student editorial staff of the newspaper is lead by the editor, elected twice per year by the Board of Student Media. The Kaleidoscope online is updated weekly.

===Intramurals===
The school also has an intramural program that runs year-round.  Students and staff compete for league trophies in sports such as basketball, bowling, flag football, golf, soccer, softball, ultimate frisbee, and volleyball, or play to win special tournaments in billiards, racquetball, tennis, and other sports.

===Honors programs===
====University Honors Program====
The University Honors Program (UHP) is UABâs core liberal arts honors program. This program provides students with a variety of interdisciplinary courses that are designed to be more challenging, innovative, and personal than normal courses. The program only accepts a maximum of 50 students per year that represent a diverse range of majors and disciplines in order to create a unique and cultivating learning environment.

This program does not have any minimum requirements for admission. Applicants are considered if they demonstrate particular academic or creative talent and after having a personal interview.

The University Honors Program represents a unique program. The interdisciplinary fall course consists of a 9 hour block (equivalent to three classes) taken the fall of freshman and sophomore years. These classes have an overarching theme such as &quot;Bottom Up, Top Down,&quot; &quot;The Anatomy of Desire,&quot; and &quot;Paradigm Shifts&quot; and are team taught by at least five faculty members from varying disciplines. These courses have in the past featured faculty from psychology, literature, visual arts, physics, Egyptology, and applied neuroscience just to name a few. This class combines freshman and sophomores together in a small learning environment allowing them to explore curiosities and form friendships across age groups. The remaining portion of the honors curriculum is made of 5 seminars. These are also very diverse in subject and are taught in small class sizes of approximately 15.

[[File:Uab honors house.jpg|thumb|right|UAB Spencer Honors House]]

====Science and Technology Honors Program====
The Science and Technology Honors Program, otherwise known as Sci-Tech Honors or S&amp;T Honors, is UABâs research based honors program. This program prepares students for research careers and graduate school by connecting them with labs and mentors in their undergraduate years.

The first two years of the program focus primarily on teaching the methodologies and techniques used in scientific research, while the last two years are spent on developing the studentâs Honors Thesis, consisting of an individual research project and report that will be submitted for publication.

The program also encourages collaboration amongst students and boasts its tight-knit learning community, which is facilitated by numerous program meetings, activities, and summer retreats. In order to promote these ideas, the program only accepts a maximum of 50 students each year. The minimum requirements for application are a 3.5 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) and an ACT or SAT score at or above the 90th percentile in math and science. However, all applications are individually reviewed and there is no definite cut-off based on ACT or SAT scores.

====Experiential Learning Scholars Program====
ELSP is a new program on the UAB campus, started in the fall of 2009. The program is based around learning through experiences based on the students future goals. The program has only a few required courses allowing many different majors to be in this honors program. Like most of the other honors programs it has no definite cut-off for ACT requirements. All students accepted into ELSP must maintain a 3.0 GPA to graduate with honors.

====Global and Community Leadership Honors Program====
The Global Community and Leadership Honors Program (GCL Honors) is composed of students interested in community and global issues. Students in this program are commonly study foreign languages, culture, and international studies. The program is designed to facilitate student interest in being leaders in their community and in the world and to help them explore the issues facing the world today and apply them to their own goals. This program provides specialized curriculum and incorporates Study Away/Study Abroad programs into its required courses.

====Early Medical School Acceptance Program====
The Early Medical School Acceptance Program (EMSAP) is the most competitive honors program available at UAB. EMSAP serves as a magnet for academically superior high-school seniors, attracting them to UABâs undergraduate programs by offering guaranteed acceptance into the School of Medicine, Dentistry, or Optometry, after completion of their undergraduate degree at UAB.

EMSAP is a combination of three separate programs: the Early Medical School Acceptance Program (EMSAP), the Early Dental School Acceptance Program (EDSAP), and the Early Optometry School Acceptance Program (EOSAP). Currently, EMSAP accepts only 10 students per year into its program while EDSAP and EOSAP, both of which are new programs starting Fall 2008, are anticipated to accept only 1â2 students each per year.

The minimum requirements for application are a 3.5 GPA (on a 4.0 scale) and at least a 30 ACT or 1320 SAT (out of 1600). However, the average ACT score of those accepted ranges from 32 to 36.
The minimum academic requirements for remaining in good standing are a 3.5 GPA in natural science and math courses and a 3.6 GPA overall. Should a studentâs GPA drop below these minimums, the student is placed on probation and has one year to bring their GPA back up to the minimum, or be expelled from the program. In addition, EMSAP students must achieve a minimum score of 28 on the  MCAT examination before their matriculation into the School of Medicine, while EDSAP and EOSAP students must make at least average scores on the DAT and OAT.

The program is currently mentored by [[Gregory Pence]], a renowned bioethicist and both an undergraduate and medical school professor.

==Health System==
[[File:UABHospital.jpg|thumb|North Pavilion at UAB Hospital]]
The '''UAB Health System''' (UABHS) is a partnership between UAB and the ''University of Alabama Health Services Foundation'' (UAHSF), a private not-for-profit medical practice made up of the faculty of the UAB School of Medicine.

The UAB president is the ex officio chairperson of the UAB Health System. The CEO of the UABHS reports directly to the UAB Health System board and is appointed by the chairman of the board.

[[UAB Hospital]] is the central institution of UABHS. It was formed as University Hospital in 1945 from the merger of Jefferson Hospital and Hillman Hospital, two private hospitals in the Southside of Birmingham acquired by the University of Alabama Board of Trustees.  University Hospital was created to serve as the primary [[teaching hospital]] for the School of Medicine.  

The other major institutions of UABHS include:
* [[Kirklin Clinic]], the outpatient clinic of UAB Hospital
* Callahan Eye Foundation Hospital, founded independently as the Eye Foundation Hospital in 1963 and merged into UABHS in 1973, &lt;ref&gt;http://medicine.uab.edu/eyedoc/about/73714/&lt;/ref&gt;
* UAB Women and Infants Center 
* UAB Highlands. Formerly [[HealthSouth]]'s flagship medical center in the [[Southside (Birmingham)|Southside]], UABHS acquired it in 2006.  Highlands now serves as an acute care hospital (there is no emergency room). In 2010, UABHS announced plans to merge Highlands completely into UAB Hospital.
* Spain Rehabilitation Center 
* UAB Health Centers, clinics operated and staffed by UABHS located throughout central Alabama
* Viva Health, a [[health maintenance organization]] (HMO) which is a subsidiary of Triton Health Systems, a limited liability corporation based in Birmingham and owned by the UABHS
