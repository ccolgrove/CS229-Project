'''Daniel Mark Siegel''', or '''Dan Siegel''', is a civil-rights attorney at the Oakland-based law firm, [[Siegel &amp; Yee]].

Siegel was born and raised in [[New York City]] and on [[Long Island]]. He attended high school in New York, graduating second in his class. He attended [[Hamilton College (New York)]] in 1963-1967 majoring in Philosophy and Religion; he received his B.A. degree there in 1967,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.siegelyee.com/dansiegel.html |title= Dan Siegel's biography |publisher= Siegel &amp; Yee |location= [[Oakland, California]] |archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/63CuogxVI |archivedate= 2011-11-14 |deadurl= no |accessdate= 2011-11-14 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; graduating magna cum laude.

Siegel was a student activist in 1967-1970 while he attended the [[UC Berkeley School of Law|University of California, Berkeley, School of Law]].  He was also a leader in the local [[Students for a Democratic Society (1960 organization)|Students for a Democratic Society]].  As [[UC Berkeley]] Student President-Elect in 1969, Siegel is known for his role in the student rebellion on &quot;Bloody Thursday,&quot; when thousands of students clashed with hundreds of [[California Highway Patrol]] officers and Alameda County sheriff's deputies sent by the office of then-California governor [[Ronald Reagan]] to assert control over a piece of property known as &quot;[[People's Park (Berkeley)|People's Park]].&quot;  During a rally on [[Sproul Plaza]] on that day, May 15, 1969, Siegel received the microphone as the crowd of 3,000 agitated to reclaim their community space, and when he yelled &quot;Take the park!&quot; a riot ensued that ended with authorities firing at demonstrators, killing one.&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, Norman.

He received his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the University of California School of Law in 1970. He passed the California [[bar examination]], but was denied a license to practice law by a subcommittee of the [[State Bar of California]]. Siegel took his appeal to the [[California Supreme Court]], which overruled the State Bar and found that Siegel possessed the requisite &quot;moral character&quot; to practice law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://law.justia.com/cases/california/cal3d/10/156.html |title= Siegel v.
