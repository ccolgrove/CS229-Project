'''Cave of the Crystals''' or '''Giant Crystal Cave''' ({{Lang-es|Cueva de los Cristales}}) is a [[cave]] connected to the [[Naica Mine]] {{Convert|300|m}} below the surface in [[Naica]],  [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]. The main chamber contains giant [[Selenite (mineral)|selenite]] [[crystals]], some of the largest natural crystals ever found.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mystery&quot;/&gt; The cave's largest crystal found to date is {{Convert|11|m|abbr=on}} in length, {{Convert|4|m|abbr=on}} in diameter and 55 tons in weight. The cave is extremely hot with air temperatures reaching up to {{Convert|58|C}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/04/photogalleries/giant-crystals-cave/|title=Giant Crystal Cave Comes to Light|accessdate=2010-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 90 to 99 percent humidity. The cave is relatively unexplored due to these factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[BBC]] |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/8466493.stm |title=A rare glimpse of the cave of crystals | work= BBC News|date=19 January 2010 | accessdate=2010-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Without proper protection people can only endure approximately ten minutes of exposure at a time.&lt;ref name = &quot;Shea&quot;&gt;{{ cite web |first=Neil |last=Shea |url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2008/11/crystal-giants/shea-text/1 |title=Crystal palace | work=[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic magazine]] |date=November 2008 | accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of scientists known as the ''Naica Project'' have been heavily involved in researching these caverns.&lt;ref name = &quot;Project&quot;&gt;{{Cite web | last =  | first =  | authorlink =  | coauthors =

==Formation of the crystals==
Naica lies on an ancient fault and there is an underground [[magma]] chamber below the cave. The magma heated the ground water and it became saturated with minerals, including large quantities of gypsum. The hollow space of the cave was filled with this mineral rich hot water and remained filled for about 500,000 years. During this time, the temperature of the water remained very stable at over 50Â°C. This allowed crystals to form and grow to immense sizes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stormchaser.ca/Caves/Naica/Naica.html www.stormchaser.ca]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
In 1910 miners discovered a cavern beneath the Naica mine workings, the Cave of Swords ({{Lang-es|Cueva de las Espadas}}). It is located at a depth of 120 m, above the Cave of Crystals, and contains spectacular, smaller (1 m long) crystals.  It is speculated that at this level, transition temperatures may have fallen much more rapidly, leading to an end in the growth of the crystals.&lt;ref name = &quot;Mystery&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

The Giant Crystal cave was discovered in 2000 by miners excavating a new tunnel for the [[Industrias PeÃ±oles]] mining company located in Naica, Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;Map http://www.mindat.org/loc-2308.html&lt;/ref&gt; while drilling through the Naica [[Fault (geology)|fault]], which they were concerned would flood the mine.&lt;ref&gt;Crystal Links  http://www.crystalinks.com/mexicocrystals.html&lt;/ref&gt; The mining complex in Naica contains substantial deposits of [[silver]], [[zinc]], and [[lead]]. 

The Cave of Crystals is a horseshoe-shaped cavity in [[limestone]] rock. Its floor is covered with perfectly-faceted crystalline blocks. Huge crystal beams jut out from both the blocks and the floor. The caves are accessible today because the mining company's pumping operations keep them clear of water. If the pumping were stopped, the caves would again be submerged.  The crystals deteriorate in air, so the Naica Project is attempting to visually document the crystals before they deteriorate further. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naica.com.mx/english/internas/interna2_1.htm Visual Rescue] at Naica Project&lt;/ref&gt;

A further chamber was found in a drilling project in 2009. The new cave, named the Ice Palace, is 150 m deep and is not flooded, but its crystal formations are much smaller, with small 'cauliflower' formations and fine, threadlike crystals.&lt;ref name = &quot;IcePalace&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

== Future closure ==

The cave was featured on the [[Discovery Channel]] program ''[[Naica: Beyond The Crystal Cave]]'' in February 2011. Exploration hinted at the existence of further chambers, but further exploration would have required demolition of the crystals. It was stated that the cave would eventually be resealed and the water level allowed to rise again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=NAICA: BEYOND THE CRYSTAL CAVE and DEADLY DESCENT Reveal Worlds Beneath the Earthâs Surface, February 13 on Discovery Channel|publisher=ctvmedia.com|date=February 8, 2011|url=http://www.ctvmedia.ca/discovery/releases/release.asp?id=13468&amp;yyyy=2011|accessdate=18 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
