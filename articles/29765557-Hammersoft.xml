'''Frank Shifreen''' (born February 29, 1948) is an [[United States|American]] artist, curator, and teacher.

===''The Monumental Show'' (1981)===
In 1979 Shifreen began to have open-studio party shows at his [[Gowanus, Brooklyn]] studio, which was a nineteenth century [[munitions]] factory at 230 3rd Street, next to the [[Gowanus Canal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gowanus&quot;&gt;{{cite news

|accessdate=2010-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; There many artists began to network. Because his building was over 9,500 square feet, Shifreen asked his landlord to periodically use the un-rented space. Next to the property, on Smith and 5th Street in a &quot;[[Urban open space|Public Site]]&quot;, there was five acres of abandoned lot to be used as an art space.&lt;ref name=&quot;onceupontime&quot;&gt;{{cite news

Six months before the show, Shifreen began putting out posters to call for entries, and with a $1500 grant from the Brooklyn Council on the Arts and help from Gowanus Canal Community Development Corporation and Carroll Gardens Association,&lt;ref name=&quot;onceupontime&quot;/&gt; he and the organizers selected 150 artists out of the thousand proposals they received. The artists were each given a 20 by 20 foot space to create their art, which as &quot;monumental&quot; consisted of paintings, sculptures, mixed media, and anything one-and-a-half times normal size. 

The participants included well-established artists such as [[Carl Andre]] and [[Andy Warhol]]-sponsored [[Keith Haring]].&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;{{cite book

On June 8, 1981, ''[[New York Magazine]]'' did an article on the show entitled &quot;Gowanus Guerrillas&quot;, calling it &quot;the event of the season.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;frankling&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;rhizome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;google&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gowanus&quot;/&gt; On June 15, 1981, Shifreen made the cover of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

===''Monument Redefined'' (1982)===
[[File:MonumentRedefined.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Poster seen around New York]]
After the success of the first, Shifren began organizing a second show with artist Scott Siken.&lt;ref name=&quot;galleryview&quot;/&gt; Entitled ''The Monument Redefined'', the 1982 show was held in three locations. The outdoor site covered twelve acres with artwork visible from the window of Brooklyn's [[F (New York City Subway service)|F subway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;rhizome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt; The space for the two indoor sites was donated by the Downtown Brooklyn Cultural Center, while sponsors included the [[New York City Department of Parks and Recreation|Department of Parks and Recreation]], the Decentralization Program of the [[New York State Council on the Arts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;galleryview&quot;/&gt; The City of New York, [[Con Edison]], the [[F.W. Woolworth Company]], and the Organization of Independent Artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt; 

The stated theme of the exhibition was not size, but social responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt; Thousands of artists again submitted entrees, and the co-curators selected 400 proposals, including works by well-known artists such as [[Carl Andre]], [[Christo]], [[Vito Acconci]], [[Nancy Holt]], the controversial [[Chris Burden]], [[Dennis Oppenheim]], [[Nancy Spero]], [[Leon Golub]], and [[Boaz Vaadia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;galleryview&quot;/&gt; Some of Shifreen's co-jurors were [[Marcia Tucker]], the director of the New Museum, [[Henry Geldzahler]], the New York City Cultural Commissioner, and [[Mary Boone]], the gallery owner. As before, the show was a success, with multiple art publications publishing reviews. Three panel discussions were held at [[Cooper Union]], and artists as well as art critics took part.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt; On October 3, 1982, there was a review in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;galleryview&quot;/&gt;

Several New York artists, including Shifreen and Julius Vitali, have theorized that the [[East Village, Manhattan]] art movement in the 1980s may have resulted partly from the artist-organized and not-for-profit shows of the early 1980s, including ''The Monumental Show'' and ''Monument Redefined''. The shows made it possible for galleries and dealers to find and support emerging artists.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; From 1985 to 1986, Shifreen had five one-person shows as a result of these events, and became a successful grant writer.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

==Career==
===1983-1989===
In September 1983, he co-organized and exhibited in the ''Brooklyn Terminal Show'' with AAAArt committee.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhizome&quot;/&gt; Held at the [[Brooklyn Navy Yard]], over 550 artists assembled in what had previously been one of the largest buildings in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;

Shifreen co-founded the Pan Aats group with Michael Curtin in 1984. For a time he served as editor of ''PanArts Magazine'', which also served as a catalog for their ''Art and Ego'' show in 1984.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhizome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;

Shifreen helped organize the ''Art Against [[Apartheid]]'' exhibition in 1984, which was held at twenty six separate locations in New York. It was also coordinated by The Organization of Independent Artists, for whom Shifreen had written numerous grants.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

He has been a member of Group Scud, a New York-based portable exhibition group, who park in front of New York museums and galleries to display work.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; The 22 Wooster Gallery gave him the paid position of Program Director for the ''Artists Talk on Art'' series, where he organized well-attended panels on diverse topics from 1986 to 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;earts&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

From 1986 to 1989, he was involved with the international artists' organization Plexus, which created multicultural art environments. Some of these exhibitions traveled to [[Rome, Italy|Rome]] as well as other parts of Europe.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

===2000-2005===
;''Crayon Show'' (2001)
In early 2001 he began working with crayon, curating a traveling exhibition that winter called the ''Crayon Show''.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhizome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nyaj&quot;/&gt; It displayed at the Open Space Gallery in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] in June 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;earts&quot;/&gt;

;''Counting Coup'' (2001)
Shifreen found himself upset after the 2000 election of [[George W. Bush]] as [[American President|President of the United States]], and he put out a call to artists to hold the exhibit ''Counting Coup'' in response.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; Shifreen found listings of artists on the internet and sent over fifty emails.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; The Museum of New Art (MONA) in [[Detroit, Michigan]] had recently opened and was holding a beginning fundraiser, to which Shifreen donated some of his paintings. The director at the time, Jef Bourgeau, appreciated the donation and scheduled ''Counting Coup'' for exhibition at MONA.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; Shifreen co-curated the show with artist Scott Pfaffman, and it opened at the Scott Phaffman Gallery in New York City on January 21, 2001, the day after Bush officially became president.&lt;ref name=&quot;rhizome&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; The show, which included artists [[Leon Golub]] and [[Barbara Kruger]], traveled also to the Theater for a New City and the Center for Social Change in Northampton Massachusetts. However, the show attracted small crowds in some places, and the show ceased to travel when the events of [[9/11]] had cemented and legitimized George Bush's presidency.&lt;ref name=&quot;digitalmuseum&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;&gt;{{cite news

He changed his show ''Witness'', intended for October 1, to ''From the Ashes'', and opened in the five-story building in the middle of October. The show included over 150 visual artists, 200 performing groups, and multiple video artists and site specific installations. There were five curators involved, including [[Willoughby Sharp]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt; The show received press in publications such the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', ''[[The Village Voice]]'', and ''[[The Villager]]''. As a result, $7000 were donated to the [[Fireman's Fund]] and five fire houses.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wsws&quot;/&gt;

On July 28, 2010, Shifreen worked with [[Cultureinside.com]] to premiere an art exhibition entitled ''EUtopia - Artistic Visions of Europe'' at the Centre Culturel de Recontre Abbaye de Neumunster in [[Luxembourg]]. The dual theme was centered around the name and the context of &quot;poverty and social exclusion&quot; in Europe. CultureInside first organized the show using its base of 3100 online members. 70 pieces of diverse media, including paining, photography, sculpture, digital, video, and performance, were then chosen by a curatorial committee. The works came from 13 different countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;culrtureinside&quot;&gt;{{cite news
