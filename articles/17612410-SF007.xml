'''BullGuard''' is a UK-based, privately held [[software]] company that produces [[internet]] security products for home users and small businesses. It has offices in Denmark, Romania, The UK, Sweden, Benelux, France, Germany, Australia and the USA.

The BullGuard logo is a white bulldog on a red background. The watch dog supposedly symbolizes the protection provided by the company to its users and also stands for the claimed user-friendliness of the productsâ design. The bulldog is, however, not just a logo, but a real live dog called Winston, who belonged to an employee at BullGuard. Although Winston has now gone into retirement, he occasionally visits the BullGuard offices in Copenhagen.{{cn|date=October 2011}}

==History==
BullGuard was founded in 2002 by two Danish entrepreneurs, Morten Lund and Theis SÃ¸ndergaard. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dk.linkedin.com/in/theissondergaard |title=Theis SÃ¸ndergaard }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their aim was to create one PC internet security product that included all the security features necessary to protect the home user.

The first version of BullGuard Internet Security was launched in June 2002. In 2003 the companyâs customer base had already registered over 3 million users, and by 2009, its products had gained notoriety, especially in the UK market, and recognition from [[PC Pro]], [[Virus Bulletin]], Computer Buyer, [[PC Plus]] magazines.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.b2bmarketing.net/knowledgebank/search-marketing/case-studies/case-study-vertical-leaps-ppc-campaign-bullguard  |title=Recommended as best buy in PC and Internet security magazines }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from developing security products for computers, BullGuard has also been working with mobile security technologies since 2005, when the company was among the first to launch a mobile security product &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bullguard.com/news/latest-press-releases/press-release-archive/2010-12-20.aspx  |title=BullGuard Mobile Security 10 Launch }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In February 2011, it was announced that BullGuard had partnered with [[Juniper Networks]] to co-brand and sell the BullGuard Mobile Security 10 based on Junos Pulse Mobile Security Suite, Juniper's security software suite for mobile devices.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.juniper.net/us/en/company/press-center/press-releases/2011/pr_2011_02_13-13_00.html |title=BullGuard to co-brand and sell the BullGuard Mobile Security 10 based on Junos Pulse Mobile Security Suite }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==AV Tests==
Since June 2007, BullGuard has passed ten VB100 tests, failed two, and missed the entrance to fourteen tests, out of 26 tests conducted by [[Virus Bulletin]] over the 4-year period &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.virusbtn.com/vb100/archive/vendor?id=48 |title=VB100 Results Overview:  BullGuard }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==BullGuard Internet Security==
BullGuardâs flagship product is the all-in-one internet security suite, BullGuard Internet Security.

===Version 2004 (4.5)===

The beta program for BullGuard 4.5 starts in May 2004. The released product includes Antivirus, Firewall and Online Backup modules.
BullGuard 4.5 was officially discontinued on October 26, 2007. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bullguard.com/news/latest-press-releases/press-release-archive_old-temp/261007.aspx |title=BullGuard 4.5 Discontinued }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Version 2005 (5.0)===
BullGuard becomes a modular application with a possibility for new plug-ins to be integrated more efficiently.

BullGuard 5.0 comes with a new interface and Firewall engine powered by  [[Sygate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pcpro.co.uk/news/66314/bullguard-5-0-unites-bitdefender-and-sygate-offerings |title=BullgGuard 5.0 unites BitDefender and Sygate  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  to complement the Antivirus and Online Backup modules. The new Firewall provides Beginner and Advanced levels that allow customization of traffic rules.

BullGuard 5.1 comes with a new Spamfilter module that supports Microsoft Outlook and Outlook Express e-mail clients. The new Spamfilter uses a server-side Bayesian filter, which is personalized for each user and adapts automatically to changes in spam e-mail content, and a user-side local database with keywords characteristic to spam e-mail.

===Version 2006 (6.0)===
[[File:BullGuard 6.0.png|thumb|Alt=BullGuard Internet Security 6.0|BullGuard Internet Security 6.0]]
With the release of BullGuard 6.0, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/release?id=152761 |title=BullGuard 6.0 Launch }}&lt;/ref&gt;the Spamfilter becomes a permanent module for the Internet Security suite and the other modules gain in performance and usability. The new Antivirus e-mail scanning feature checks outgoing e-mails. 

===Version 2007 (7.0)===

Version 7.0 marks a new milestone for the BullGuard products, as it introduces module changes and a new user interface. The Sygate-based Firewall engine is replaced with a more capable Outpost engine that allows a better in-depth traffic management. The Antivirus gains improved features for detection and removal of spyware. The Online Backup module is modified to allow backup tasks for e-mail clients such as  [[Outlook Express]] and [[Microsoft Outlook]].

BullGuard 7.0 comes with a new Support module that provides instant access to the BullGuard technical support team by Live Chat or e-mail.

===Version 2008 (8.0)===

Version 8.0 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bullguard.com/news/latest-press-releases/press-release-archive_old-temp/180308.aspx |title=BullGuard 8.0 Launch }}&lt;/ref&gt; comes with several changes that extend the module performance and improve the user interface. The Spamfilter and the Online Backup module both support the [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] email client.

===Version 2009 (9.0)===
[[File:BullGuard 9.0.png|thumb|Alt=BullGuard Internet Security 9.0|BullGuard Internet Security 9.0]]
BullGuard 9.0 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bullguard.com/news/latest-press-releases/press-release-archive/2010_02-01.aspx |title=BullGuard 9.0 Launch }}&lt;/ref&gt;is the merge between the Internet Security suite and the former SteelSecurity suite designed to fine-tune the computer performance for gamers. The new module allows users to minimize the impact of the security suite by reducing pop-up messages and fine-tuning the modules for minimum interference.

Antiphishing is added to the Antivirus module, improving malware detection, catch rates and removal tools.

The Spamfilter now supports [[Windows Live Mail]] and [[IncrediMail]] e-mail clients. It also allows more customized settings than the previous version.

The Firewall is improved by adding a local whitelist for the most commonly used applications (e-mail clients, Internet browsers, text processors, games or multimedia applications).

The Online Backup module comes with a new wizard that provides customizable Backup profiles and automatic Backup profiles for commonly used computer locations (desktop items, e-mails and user account folders for documents or multimedia files). The users now have instant access to the Online Backup drive, as this is integrated in the Windows Explorer file manager.

The version is added a Game Mode feature that protects the gamer's PC without lowering the quality and speed of game play.



===Version 10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bullguard.com/news/latest-press-releases/press-release-archive/2010-10-21.aspx |title=BullGuard Internet Security Suite 10 Launch}}&lt;/ref&gt;===

BullGuard Internet Security 10 is improved so as to address the rapid expansion of online threats. The new additions are:
*the Behavioural Detection incorporated in the Antivirus module, along with the traditional Signature-based detection; the two technologies combined have resulted in malware catch rates that are 65% higher than those of traditional virus programs. The Behavioural Detection monitors the file, registry, process, and network events on a computer and if a program behaves abnormally, acting like malicious software, an alert will be raised and the program will be stopped and quarantined. Signature-based Detection, on the other hand, identifies viruses and other malware by comparing the contents of a file to a dictionary of virus signatures. Because viruses can embed themselves in existing files, the entire file is searched, not just as a whole, but also in pieces.{{cn|date=November 2011}} 

*Safe browsing as part of the Antiphishing module. This feature flags any registered, unsafe websites that come up in search results. It scans the links present on a webpage for possible threats and places an icon for each link notifying the user whether it is safe or not to access it. 

*the Inspector module that detects out-dated software. It is, in fact, a vulnerability scanner locating old software versions before hackers start exploiting it.
