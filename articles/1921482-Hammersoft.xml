Born in [[Glasgow]] yet growing up in [[Illinois]] after his family [[emigration|emigrated]] to the United States when he was eight years old, Barrowman was encouraged to further his love for music and theatre by his high school teachers. He studied performing arts at the [[United States International University]] in San Diego before visiting Britain and landing the role of Billy Crocker in [[Cole Porter]]'s ''[[Anything Goes]]'' in London's [[West End theatre|West End]].

Since his debut in professional theatre, Barrowman has played lead roles in various musicals both in the West End and on Broadway, including ''[[Matador (musical)|Matador]]'', ''[[Miss Saigon]]'', ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' and ''[[Sunset Boulevard (musical)|Sunset Boulevard]]''. After appearing in [[Sam Mendes]]' production of ''[[The Fix (musical)|The Fix]]'', he was nominated for the 1998 [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Musical]] and, in the early 2000s, returned to the role of Billy Crocker in the revival of ''Anything Goes''. His most recent West End credit was in the 2009 production of ''[[La Cage aux Folles (musical)|La Cage aux Folles]]''. 

Aside from his career in theatre, Barrowman has expanded his repertoire into film and television. He has appeared in various films including the musical biopic ''[[De-Lovely]]'' (2004) and musical comedy ''[[The Producers (2005 film)|The Producers]]'' (2005). On British television, he is known for his acting and presenting work for the [[BBC]], including his work for [[CBBC]] in its earlier years, his self-produced entertainment programme ''[[Tonight's the Night (TV series)|Tonight's the Night]]'', and his [[BAFTA Cymru]]-nominated role of [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], who appears in science fiction series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]''. Before venturing into British television, he featured on the American television dramas ''[[Titans (TV series)|Titans]]'' and ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]''. Since, Barrowman has had a number of guest roles in television programmes both in the United States and in the United Kingdom. He appeared as a contestant on the [[Dancing on Ice (series 1)|first series]] of celebrity [[ice skating]] show ''[[Dancing on Ice]]'' while his theatrical background allowed him to become a judge on [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s musical talent shows ''[[How Do You Solve A Problem Like Maria?]]'', ''[[Any Dream Will Do (TV series)|Any Dream Will Do]]'' and ''[[I'd Do Anything (BBC TV series)|I'd Do Anything]]''. In 2006, he was voted [[Stonewall (UK)|Stonewall]]'s Entertainer of the Year.

In addition to appearing in several feature films and television series, Barrowman has featured on more than a dozen musical theatre recordings including cover tunes found on his 2007 album ''[[Another Side (John Barrowman album)|Another Side]]'' and 2008's ''[[Music Music Music]]''. Both albums accrued places on the [[UK Albums Chart]], as did his self-titled ''[[John Barrowman (album)|John Barrowman]]'' (2010), which reached number 11, his highest chart placing to date. Furthermore, Barrowman has published two memoirs and autobiographies, ''Anything Goes'' (2008) and ''I Am What I Am'' (2009), with his sister as co-author.

==Early life==
John Scot Barrowman was born in 1967 in the [[Mount Vernon, Glasgow|Mount Vernon area]] of [[Glasgow]]; the youngest of three siblings.  Barrowman lived in Glasgow for the first eight years of his life.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=I don't want to be liked...just to get a little respect, says Doctor Who star John Barrowman |last=Johnston |first=Jenny |newspaper=[[Mail Online]] |date=2008-10-04 |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1067288/I-dont-want-liked--just-little-respect-says-Doctor-Who-star-John-Barrowman.html |accessdate=2009-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  His mother was a singer and worked as a clerk in a [[record shop]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Gale&quot;&gt;&quot;John Barrowman.&quot; (2009).

Farmington Hills, Michigan: Gale.&lt;/ref&gt; while his father was employed by the [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]] heavy machinery company in [[Uddingston]]. In 1976, his father's company relocated the family to [[Aurora, Illinois|Aurora]], [[Illinois]] in the [[United States]], where his father managed the Caterpillar tractor factory.  Barrowman recalls his family as loving, but strict and mindful of etiquette: always polite and respectful towards others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston&quot; /&gt;  Comparing the two countries where he was raised, Barrowman concludes: &quot;Scotland gave us, as a family, closeness; America gave us the get-up-and-go.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Johnston&quot; /&gt;  The family settled in [[Joliet, Illinois|Joliet]], [[Illinois]], where Barrowman attended [[Joliet West High School]] in the heart of a &quot;quintessentially middle-class conservative town&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Anstead2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Anstead |first=Mark |date=2007-05-11 |title=My Best Teacher |journal=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |issue= |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2382799 |issn=0040-7887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrowman's high school music and English teachers changed the future course of his life, his music tutor instilling in him the love of performing, and his English teacher encouraging Barrowman to realise his true potential.  His English teacher moved him into a Gifted Programme and coached Barrowman for the school's speech team.  With the support of his teacher, Barrowman competed with other schools in statewide speech competitions, where he sharpened his skills reading scenes from plays.

As a [[freshman]], Barrowman won parts in several musical productions and from 1983 to 1985 he performed in ''[[Hello, Dolly! (musical)|Hello, Dolly!]]'', ''[[Oliver!]]'', ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'', ''[[Li'l Abner (musical)|Li'l Abner]]'' and ''[[Anything Goes]]''.  Looking back, he acknowledges that &quot;without the support he received in high school, chances are that he would not now be appearing in royal command performances in the West End in front of the Royal Family or having Stephen Sondheim ask him to play opposite Carol Burnett.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;tes0314&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=2008-03-14 |title=People |journal=[[Times Educational Supplement]] |issue=4736 |url=http://www.tes.co.uk/article.aspx?storycode=2593581 |issn=0040-7887 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Barrowman spent his [[Twelfth grade|senior year]] shoveling coal for an Illinois power company.  His father had arranged the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of [[manual labour]].  Barrowman's father told him: &quot;If you want to do manual labour for the rest of your life you'll know that when you do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and â if you decide what you want to do â being good at your craft or your skill.&quot;  Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job.  Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Lee |last=Luaine |title=John Barrowman stars in BBC America's 'Torchwood' |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/272/story/216821.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927225929/http://www.miamiherald.com/272/story/216821.html |archivedate=2007-09-27 |work=[[The Miami Herald]] |date=27 August 2007 |accessdate=2007-08-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrowman graduated from high school in 1985, and became a [[naturalization|naturalised citizen]] of the United States&lt;ref name=&quot;Portantiere&quot; /&gt; (although he maintains [[Multiple citizenship|dual citizenship]] in the UK and the US).&lt;ref name=&quot;Portantiere&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Holden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://community.livejournal.com/ohnotheydidnt/14977127.html |title=ohnotheydidnt: David Tennant &amp; John Barrowman interviews, Doctor Who wins award |publisher=community.livejournal.com |accessdate=2010-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After he graduated from high school, he moved to [[San Diego]], [[California]], to study [[performing arts]] at the [[United States International University]] (USIU).

===Prime time drama===
Barrowman's television career began with several appearances in short-lived [[prime-time]] [[soap opera]]s.  Barrowman first starred as Peter Fairchild in ''[[Central Park West (TV series)|Central Park West]]'' (1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=1995-10-02 |title=Send in the clones |journal=[[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=44 |issue=14 |page=88 |issn=0093-7673}}  The article profiles Barrowman's role as Peter Fairchild in the show ''Central Park West'' and his reported similarity to [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], along with [[Steven Eckholdt]] in ''[[The Monroes (1995 TV series)|The Monroes]]''.  The article takes a very lighthearted look at the similarities between the two actors and JFK Jr. in table format.  Under an entry for &quot;Love Life&quot;, it says Barrowman &quot;has been linked with Cher.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; a show American film critic Ken Tucker calls &quot;a tale of ritzy, ditsy New York City careeristsâsome struggling to make it, others plotting to retain their status and power.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker1995&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=1995-09-22 |last=Tucker |first=Ken |title=Central Park West |journal=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |volume= |issue=293 |page=66 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Television critic David Hiltbrand called Barrowman's character a &quot;Prince Charming...a virtuous, hardworking assistant DA who keeps getting distracted by women who swoon in his path.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Hiltbrand&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=1995-09-18 |last=Hiltbrand |first=David |title=Central Park West |journal=[[People (magazine)|People]] |volume=44 |issue=12 |page=21 |issn=0093-7673}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tucker noted Barrowman's character of Peter Fairchild to be &quot;physically an eye-widening cross between John Kennedy Jr. and Hugh
Grant&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Tucker1995&quot; /&gt;  The show lasted for two seasons on [[CBS]], from September 1995 to June 1996.  Next, Barrowman appeared as Peter Williams in ''[[Titans (television series)|Titans]]'' (2000) alongside [[Yasmine Bleeth]] on [[NBC]].  According to writer Joanna Bober, in ''Titans'', Barrowman plays a &quot;ruthless mogul&quot; who gains &quot;control of the family's private aviation company (a fleet of 'Titans') from his semi-retired father&quot; while increasing the profitability of the company amidst a series of soap opera intrigues.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bober&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |date=Sept., 2000 |last=Bober  |first=Joanna |title=John Barrowman |journal=[[Interview (magazine)|Interview]] |volume=30 |issue=9 |page=84 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Titans'' lasted one season and was canceled after airing 11 episodes.  Barrowman was also considered for the role of Will in the popular US series ''[[Will and Grace]]'', but the producers felt he was &quot;too straight&quot; and the role eventually went to [[Eric McCormack]] instead.  Commenting on the decision, Barrowman remarked, &quot;The sad thing is it's run by gay men and women.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gay Doctor Who star was too straight for Will and Grace | publisher=Pink News | date =13 January 2006 | url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-327.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later expressed contempt for the idea that all gay men act the same way.&lt;ref name=&quot;Metro&quot;/&gt;

===''Doctor Who'' and ''Torchwood''===
Barrowman is best known in the UK for his role in the [[BBC]]'s [[science fiction]] drama ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  When the series was  revived in 2005, Barrowman came on board as recurring guest character [[Jack Harkness|Captain Jack Harkness]], a [[time travel]]ler from the 51st century.  His first appearance as Harkness was in the two-part story &quot;[[The Empty Child]]&quot;/&quot;[[The Doctor Dances]]&quot;, going on to appear in the next three episodes, &quot;[[Boom Town (Doctor Who)|Boom Town]]&quot;, &quot;[[Bad Wolf]]&quot; and &quot;[[The Parting of the Ways]]&quot;.  The character of Captain Jack Harkness became so popular, he was given his own show. ''[[Torchwood]]'', a ''Doctor Who'' spin-off series featuring a team of alien hunters based in modern day [[Cardiff]], premiered in 2006.  Ken Tucker describes Barrowman's role on ''Torchwood'' as &quot;dashing&quot; and &quot;celestially promiscuous&quot;, and &quot;like Tom
Cruise with suspenders, but minus the Scientology.&quot;  On the show, Captain Jack Harkness &quot;tracks downâand occasionally bedsâETs with the help of his quartet of bedazzled groupiesâslashâExperts in Their Fields: One's a doctor, one's a cop, one's a scientist, and one... makes tea piping hot.

In the book, Barrowman reveals that when he was just beginning his acting career, management sent a gay producer to talk to him. The producer told Barrowman that he should try to pretend to be heterosexual in order to be successful. Barrowman was offended by the incident, and it made him more aware of the importance of his role as a gay public figure: &quot;One of my explicit missions as an entertainer is to work to create a world where no one will ever make a statement like this producer did to me to anyone who's gay.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=&quot;He's a natural&quot;: Torchwood star John Barrowman delights audiences as he takes to the West End in drag|newspaper=[[Mail Online]] |date= 2009-10-04|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1218062/Hes-natural-Torchwood-star-John-Barrowman-delights-audiences-takes-West-End-drag.html |accessdate=2009-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
