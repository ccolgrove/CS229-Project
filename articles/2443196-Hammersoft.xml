==Acting career==
Garai's first professional acting role was in the 2000 BBC-[[HBO]] TV film ''[[The Last of the Blonde Bombshells]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent Nov 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Nina|last=Lakhani|title=Romola Garai: An actor's life for me â at least for now|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/romola-garai-an-actors-life-for-me-ndash-at-least-for-now-1820967.html|work=The Independent|date=15 November 2009|accessdate=15 November 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she played [[Judi Dench]]'s character as young. She then landed a part in the BBC 26-part television series ''[[Attachments (TV series)|Attachments]]'' (2000â2002).&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent Nov 2009&quot; /&gt; It was this production that prompted her to make the decision to stop her education and concentrate solely on her acting career.&lt;ref name=&quot;uni&quot;/&gt;

Garai's first major film role was in 2002's ''[[Nicholas Nickleby (2002 film)|Nicholas Nickleby]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent Nov 2009&quot; /&gt; She played Kate Nickleby, a supporting role, in the well-reviewed film.

''[[Dirty Dancing: Havana Nights]]'' (2004) was Garai's biggest critical flop to date. Her performance received mixed reviews â many critics felt let down after her previous impressive turns.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} Later that same year ''[[Vanity Fair (2004 film)|Vanity Fair]]'' was released. In ''Vanity Fair'', she played Amelia Sedley. Co-starring [[:Reese Witherspoon]], [[:Jim Broadbent]], and [[:James Purefoy]], the movie was based on the 19th century novel by [[:William Makepeace Thackeray]] and it was directed by [[:Mira Nair]].

In 2005, Garai received another BIFA nomination, this time for their Best Supporting Actress award, for her performance as Siobhan in the independent film ''[[Inside I'm Dancing]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIFA&quot; /&gt; Her portrayal earned her the British Supporting Actress of the Year award from the [[London Film Critics Circle]]. Also in 2005, she starred in a two-part drama made for television, entitled ''[[The Incredible Journey of Mary Bryant]]''. While critics hailed it as &quot;pleasingly old-fashioned adventure,&quot; it was her performance that won the most admiration and earn her two nominations: Best Lead Actress in Television from the [[Australian Film Institute]] and Most Outstanding Actress in a Drama Series from the [[Logie Awards]]. As ''The Observer'' noted: ''&quot;As for the tireless Garai, she once again demonstrated an instinctive understanding of the vital difference between overperforming and overacting.&quot;'' {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

She can be seen in [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s [[film adaptation]] of William Shakespeare's ''[[As You Like It]]'' (2006), as Celia.

In 2011, Garai starred in the four-part BBC drama ''[[The Crimson Petal and the White (TV miniseries)|The Crimson Petal and the White]]'' based on [[The Crimson Petal and the White|the novel]] by [[Michel Faber]]. She has commented on her racy part of Sugar, a 19th century mistress, that &quot;standing in pants and suspenders, waiting for someone to call action, is pretty cringy ... By the end everyone on the set was like, 'Please just put it away.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Deborah Feldman, ''Tatler'', July 2011&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 she played Bel Rowley in the TV drama ''[[The Hour (drama series)|The Hour]]'' leading with [[Dominic West]] and [[Ben Whishaw]], and the stage play ''[[The Village Bike]]'' at the Royal Court.

==Personal life==
Garai's great-grandfather emigrated from [[Budapest]] to New York in the 1910s with his English-born wife, then moved to London, where he founded the Keystone Press Agency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Aidan|last=Smith|title=Interview: Romola Garai, actress|url=http://www.scotsman.com/features/Interview-Romola-Garai-actress.5849358.jp|work=Scotsman.com|date=23 November 2009|accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=2ZI5AQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22BERNHARD+GARAI%22&amp;dq=%22BERNHARD+GARAI%22&amp;hl=en]&lt;/ref&gt; Most of her Hungarian-Jewish relatives were killed in the Holocaust. Garai admits she has &quot;not yet&quot; been to Hungary and feels modern, cosmopolitan, and British.&lt;ref name=&quot;Independent Nov 2009&quot; /&gt; She lives in London and in 2009 finished her degree in English Literature with the [[Open University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Preston|title=Romola Garai: on a roll|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/3558305/Romola-Garai-on-a-roll.html|work=Telegraph|date=10 August 2008|accessdate=15 November 2009|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Garai guards her private life, saying, ''&quot;It's too simplistic to say that people start to believe what's written about them. But what happens is that you become a certain way to please people, to be liked, to be what's expected of you, to change yourself so that you become the best possible version of yourself for people who don't know you. And I think that's a terrible, pernicious thing.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age Nov 2007&quot;&gt;{{cite news|first=Philippa|last=Hawker|title=Where angels fear not|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/film/where-angels-fear-not/2007/11/16/1194766927209.html|work=The Age|date=17 November 2007|accessdate=15 November 2009|location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt; She adds, ''&quot;In a way, I'd rather go into an interview and be disliked, and have unpleasant things written about me, than to have a wonderful, glowing article written that is in no way a reflection of who I am.&quot;''&lt;ref name=&quot;The Age Nov 2007&quot;/&gt;

She has visited Hong Kong, Malaysia, Italy, Austria, Morocco, and Switzerland, and the United States, &quot;To be the outsider for a period of time changes you for the better.
