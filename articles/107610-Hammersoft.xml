'''Cerritos''' (formerly known as '''Dairy Valley''' because of the preponderance of dairy farms in the area) is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California]], [[United States]], and is one of several cities that constitute the [[Gateway Cities]] of southeast Los Angeles County. It was incorporated on April 24, 1956. The current [[United States Office of Management and Budget|OMB]] [[metropolitan area|metropolitan]] designation for Cerritos is &quot;[[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]-[[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]]-[[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], CA.&quot; According to the [[2010 US Census]], the population was 49,041.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== History ==
Cerritos was originally inhabited by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] belonging to the [[Tongva people|Tongva]] people (or &quot;People of the Earth&quot;). Later, the Tongva would be renamed the &quot;GabrieleÃ±os&quot; by the [[Spanish people|Spanish]] settlers after the nearby [[Mission San Gabriel Arcangel]]. The GabrieleÃ±os were the largest group of [[Southern California]] Indians as well as the most developed in the region.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;&gt;

| pages = 11â19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The GabrieleÃ±os lived off the land, deriving food from the animals or plants that could be gathered, snared, or hunted, and grinding acorns as a staple.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

Beginning in the late 15th century, Spanish explorers arrived in the New World and worked their way to the [[California]] coast in 1542. The colonization process included &quot;civilizing&quot; the native populations in California by means of establishing various [[Spanish missions in California|missions]]. Soon afterwards, a town called ''El Pueblo de Nuestra SeÃ±ora la Reina de los Ãngeles de PorciÃºncula'' ([[Los Angeles]] today) would be founded and prosper with the aid of subjects from [[New Spain]] and Native American labor.&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

One soldier, JosÃ© [[Manuel Nieto]], was granted a large plot of land by the [[Spain|Spanish]] [[King Carlos III]], which he named [[Rancho Los Nietos]]. It covered {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}} of what are today the cities of Cerritos, [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]], [[Downey, California|Downey]], [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]], [[Santa Fe Springs, California|Santa Fe Springs]], part of [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], [[Huntington Beach, California|Huntington Beach]], [[Buena Park, California|Buena Park]], and [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]].&lt;ref name=&quot;book&quot;/&gt;

The rancho was divided five ways among Nieto's heirs during the [[nationalization]] of church property by the Mexican government, with Juan JosÃ© Nieto retaining the largest plot called [[Rancho Los Coyotes]]. Nieto called the area of Rancho Los Coyotes, where Cerritos is located today, &quot;cerritos&quot; or &quot;little hills&quot; although no natural hills exist in modern-day Cerritos.  In Spanish, the word cerritos means &quot;little hills.&quot;

After the [[Mexican-American war]], the rancho would eventually wind up in the hands of the [[Los Angeles and San Bernardino Land Company]] which encouraged development and rail lines to be built by [[Henry E. Huntington]] and his [[Pacific Electric Railway]] company. It is through rapid development combined with improved transportation systems that formed the modern-day city of [[Artesia, California|Artesia]] in Rancho Los Coyotes in 1875, and from it, the '''City of Dairy Valley'''.

A small general aviation airport was built around 1946 and was called Cranford Airport and consisted of two 2,300' runways, one oriented north/south &amp; the other northeast/southwest. Each runway had a parallel taxiway, and a ramp along the south side of the field had 2 building hangars. The site for Cranford Airport is located on the northwest corner of the intersection of South Street &amp; Carmenita Road. Cranford Airport closed at some point between 1953-54.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CA/Airfields_CA_LongBeach.htm#cranford Abandoned &amp; Little-Known Airfields: California: Long Beach area]&lt;/ref&gt;

The City of Dairy Valley was incorporated on April 24, 1956, as a reaction to nearby Artesia's rapid [[urbanization]]. The City's name symbolized the more than 400 dairies, 100,000 cows and 106,300 chickens found within its limits. The cows outnumbered the City's 3,439 residents by 29 to 1. The chickens outnumbered the residents by over 30 to 1.

Two years later, Dairy Valley voted to become a chartered California city. As land values and [[property taxes]] in California rose in the early 1960s, [[agriculture]] became increasingly unprofitable, and development pressures increased. In a special election held on July 16, 1963, residents voted to permit large-scale residential development. As a reflection of its newly planned suburban orientation, the City's name formally changed to &quot;Cerritos&quot; on January 10, 1967, after the nearby Spanish land grant [[Rancho Los Cerritos]], which figured prominently in the region and after [[Cerritos College]] in neighboring [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]].

Cerritos is a prime example of the &quot;fiscalization&quot; of California politics after the [[tax revolt]] of the 1970s and the passage of [[Proposition 13]]. The only way for California cities to raise long-term tax [[revenue]] in light of Proposition 13 was to create as many commercial zones as possible to take advantage of the percentage of county sales tax allocated back to [[municipalities]] as sales tax revenue. Cerritos was one of the first cities in [[Los Angeles County]] to develop large-scale retail zones, such as the [[Los Cerritos Center]] and [[Cerritos Auto Square]], and achieved stunning success. City leaders reinvested funds into the community with large public works projects and an increasing number of community services and programs.

The current [[progressivism|progressive]] nature of the Cerritos government and the unusually strong tax-base is best reflected in its facilities. In 1978, Cerritos dedicated the nation's first solar-heated [[City Hall]] complex. In 1993, the [[Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts]] opened its doors. In 1994, the City unveiled the [[Cerritos Towne Center]] project that combines office, retail, lodging, fine arts and dining in an open-air location. In 1997, the City opened the Cerritos Sheriff's Station/Community Safety Center to provide public safety services. In 2002, the City rededicated its [[Cerritos Millennium Library|public library]]. In 2006, the City celebrated its [[golden anniversary]] with memorials and the unveiling of a sculpture garden. The assessed valuation of the City of Cerritos is $7,177,428,066.&lt;ref name=&quot;cerritos.us&quot;&gt;[http://www.cerritos.us/_pdfs/state_of_the_city_2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1970 and 1972, Cerritos was the fastest growing city in California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Since the 1980s, Cerritos has attracted a large number of upper-middle class [[Filipino American|Filipino]], [[Korean American|Korean]], [[Indian American|Indian]], and [[Chinese American|Chinese]] immigrant families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://menu.ci.cerritos.ca.us/collections/local_history/cl_lhStory9.htm

On August 31, 1986, [[AeromÃ©xico Flight 498]] on approach to [[Los Angeles International Airport]] was struck by a small Piper aircraft that had strayed into an air traffic control zone reserved for commercial flights. Eighty-two people died, including 15 people on the ground. The Piper crashed into Cerritos Elementary School's unoccupied playground, but the [[Douglas DC-9]] fell inverted (upside-down) out of the sky and plowed into dense residential zones, immediately flattening four houses. Eight more houses were destroyed by the subsequent fire before firefighters could bring it under control. The incident is memorialized with a new sculpture installed in the [[Cerritos, California#Cerritos Sculpture Garden|Cerritos Sculpture Garden]].

==Geography==
Cerritos is located at {{Coord|33|52|6|N|118|4|3|W|type:city}} (33.868314, -118.067547).{{Geographic reference|1}}

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|8.9|sqmi|km2}}. {{convert|8.7|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.1|sqmi|km2}} of it (1.48%) is water.

Cerritos lies along the [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]] and [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] border. The cities bordering Cerritos on the Los Angeles County side include [[Artesia, California|Artesia]] in the center, [[Bellflower, California|Bellflower]], [[Lakewood, California|Lakewood]], [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]], [[Santa Fe Springs, California|Santa Fe Springs]], and [[La Mirada, California|La Mirada]].

The City of Cerritos, as well as most of coastal [[Southern California]], generally has a [[Mediterranean climate]] and shares the climate of areas along the [[Mediterranean Sea]]. Summers are warm to hot, and winters are cool, rarely falling below freezing. [[Precipitation (meteorology)|Precipitation]] in Cerritos occurs predominantly during the winter months.

Cerritos also has a unique &quot;semi-marine&quot; climate pattern within Los Angeles County. The fog that typically covers the beach cities rarely reaches Cerritos, but the breeze that comes along the [[San Gabriel River (California)|San Gabriel River]] from the Pacific Ocean has a significant cooling effect. As a result, Cerritos is rarely affected by the smog, [[Santa Ana winds]], and smothering heat of the [[Los Angeles Basin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/library/history/chapter1.html The Story of Cerritos]&lt;/ref&gt;

The period of April through November is warm to hot and dry with average high temperatures of {{convert|71|-|79|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|50|-|62|F|C}}. Due to the moderating effect of the ocean, temperatures are cooler than in more inland areas of Los Angeles, where temperatures can exceed {{convert|90|F|C}}.

The Los Angeles area is also subject to the phenomenon typical of a [[microclimate]]. As such, the temperatures can vary as much as 18&amp;nbsp;Â°F (10&amp;nbsp;Â°C) between inland areas and the coast, with a temperature gradient of over one degree per mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from the coast inland. California has also a weather phenomenon called &quot;[[June Gloom]]&quot; or &quot;May Gray&quot;, which sometimes gives overcast or foggy skies in the morning at the coast, but usually gives sunny skies by noon, during late spring and early summer.

Employment within Cerritos is primarily located in two districts, Los Cerritos Shopping Center and Cerritos Industrial Park. Businesses found in the Industrial Park provide jobs in light manufacturing and assembly of electronic and automotive parts, among other things. [[United Parcel Service]], the city's largest employer with a staff of 6,000, is located in the Industrial Park.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/atoz/statistical_profile.pdf Cerritos Statistical Profile]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Los Cerritos Center provided for 4,450 full and part-time positions and the Cerritos Auto Square employs 2,160 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;cerritos.us&quot;/&gt; Retail and industrial trades are responsible for Cerritos' $2 billion taxable retail sales and the $7.2 billion assessed property valuation.

According to the [[State Board of Equalization (California)|California State Board of Equalization]], Cerritos residents are the second highest retail spenders in California (second to [[Beverly Hills]]) averaging $36,544 per resident. Applied Development Economics, in a presentation for the Cerritos Economic Commission on February 14, 2006 states that total annual household spending on retail is about $365 million a year with new car dealerships, grocery stores, department stores, service stations and eating places having the strongest demands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cerritos.granicus.com/ViewPublisher.php?view_id=2#Economic Cerritos TV3]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Magnolia Power Project ===
The uncertain state of availability of electricity in California prompted the City of Cerritos on February 13, 2003, in conjunction with the cities of [[Anaheim, California|Anaheim]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Colton, California|Colton]], [[Glendale, California|Glendale]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], to participate in the Magnolia Power Project, which authorized the construction of a 310-[[megawatt]] power plant in the City of Burbank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/comnews/faqmagnolia.html Magnolia Power Project]&lt;/ref&gt; Cerritos receives 10 megawatts, or 4% of the total output, to power public facilities, park lighting, traffic signals and water wells. Excess power (approximately 5 megawatts) is sold to public and/or private agencies.

The facility also houses three additional meeting and banquet areas. The CCPA was designed by architect [[Barton Myers]].

The cost of the CCPA had reached over $60 million by the end of construction and scheduling. It was designed to serve as a cultural icon for people in the community and formally opened its doors on January 9, 1993 with a four-day performance by [[Frank Sinatra]].

The CCPA collected four awards for design shortly after its opening and has been named one of the top grossing theaters in its category in the United States.

=== Cerritos Millennium Library ===
{{Main|Cerritos Millennium Library}}
[[File:Cerritos Library 1.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Western facade of the Cerritos Millennium Library during the [[Christmas holiday season]]]]
The Cerritos Library originally opened to the public on September 17, 1973 with a &quot;First Ladies&quot; theme (in recognition of former [[First Lady]] [[Pat Nixon]]'s home in the community). Eight years later, the City made its first renovation to the library for $6.6 million. Twenty-one thousand square feet (2,000&amp;nbsp;mÂ²) were added for $5.4 million, and the remaining $1.2 million was spent on furniture and equipment.

In the late 1990s, Cerritos recognized the ever-changing innovation in [[information technology]] and the Internet and plans for a second renovation were approved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.cerritos.ca.us/library/libhistory.html#The%20Library%20Today Cerritos Library Today]&lt;/ref&gt; During the reconstruction, all materials were moved off site to temporary trailers in the parking lot of the Cerritos Towne Center for two years. The second renovation and expansion was completed on March 16, 2002.

At the time of its rededication, the newly renamed Cerritos Millennium Library was the first building in North America to be coated in [[titanium]] panels. This $40 million library features an elaborate interior design with themed reading rooms in a variety of Old World and ultramodern styles. A third floor was added to include several conference rooms and an outdoor terrace.

The Cerritos Library currently holds a Smithsonian Affiliation. It has been awarded ''American Library Association/American Institute of Architects'' &quot;Award of Excellence&quot; back in 1989. It was also honored with ''Reader's Digest's'' 2004 Best Library Award.
