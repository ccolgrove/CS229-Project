'''Giulietta da Vinci''' or the '''Cigar Girl''' is a [[fictional]] character from the opening sequence to the [[1999 in film|1999]] James Bond film ''The World Is Not Enough'', played by [[Maria Grazia Cucinotta]]. In the film the name is given by association only but in the novelisation of the film the character is called '''Giulietta da Vinci'''.

The Cigar Girl first appears in the Swiss banker's office in [[Bilbao]] where Bond was investigating the murder of 0012. She offers him a cigar, hence her name.  On Bond's attempt to force the banker to relay information about the death of the MI6 agent who obtained certain top secret documents from the Russian Atomic Energy Department, The Cigar Girl escapes after throwing a knife in the banker's neck as he is about to give away information.

Later in the opening sequence, after Sir Robert King was blown up with explosive money,
the Cigar Girl was waiting in a speedboat on the [[River Thames]] with a scoped rifle taking a shot at Bond for good measure and then attempting to escape. 007 went after her and the two eventually ended up in a hot air balloon. By then MI6, via helicopters, cornered her. Rather than face Renard's persecution, the Cigar Girl chose suicide by firing into the gas tanks forcing Bond to jump and land on the roof of the [[Millennium Dome]].

'''Last Conversation''' 

Bond : &quot;Listen to me! Don't do it! Don't blow us up: I can protect you! Do you understand? I can protect you!&quot;

Cigar Girl : &quot;Not from [[Renard (James Bond)|him]]!&quot;

'''Gabor''' is a [[List of James Bond villains|henchman]] in the James Bond film ''The World Is Not Enough''. He was portrayed by [[John Seru]].

He is [[Elektra King]]'s [[bodyguard]], and is usually seen accompanying her. It is unknown whether he is really an employee of [[Renard (James Bond)|Renard]], but nevertheless, as Elektra's and Renard's goals are the same, he assists both. He helped Elektra capture M after shooting her guards. He is shot dead by Bond after the agent escapes from Elektra's grasp and wastes no time in gunning Gabor down during the Maiden's Tower assault.

'''Bullion''' is a supporting villain in the James Bond film ''The World Is Not Enough'', portrayed by [[Drum and Bass]] artist [[Goldie]].

Bond first encounters him while on his way to speak to [[Valentin Zukovsky]], but had to apply a little force to get through Bullion to speak to his boss.  A seemingly loyal servant to [[Valentin Zukovsky]], Bullion ultimately double-crosses his boss by working for [[Elektra King]]. After tipping her off to Bond's location at the Caviare Factory and the failed assassination attempt, Bullion resorts to leaving his gold case behind in the [[KGB]] Headquarters. The bomb explodes but fails to kill Bond, [[Christmas Jones]] and Zukovsky, who ultimately gets his [[revenge]] by gunning him down during the Maiden's Tower assault. True to his name, Bullion is easily recognizable by the sheer amount of gold jewellery he sports, including gold-capped teeth (which prompts Bond to quip &quot;I see you put your money where your mouth is&quot;). His real name is '''Maurice Womasa''' from Somalia. Apparently, according to Valentin, he does not trust banks.

'''Last Words''' - &quot;Boss! You're alive... So glad to see you!&quot; - Zukovsky: &quot;Me too,&quot; [shoots him]

'''Sasha Davidov''' is a villain in the James Bond film ''The World Is Not Enough''. He was portrayed by Danish actor [[Ulrich Thomsen]].

Davidov is in effect [[Elektra King]]'s right-hand-man, as he is in charge of her personal security and also meets with [[Renard (James Bond)|Renard]] regularly. After Dr. Arkov is killed, he takes over the job of infiltrating the [[nuclear weapons|nuclear]] decommissioning site but only makes it as far as the airport. After having his devotion to the cause tested by Renard and his scalding rocks, Bond discovers Davidov's affiliation and shoots him twice before dropping him into a dumpster. It is later revealed that Elektra's men recovered Davidov's body at the airstrip when she contacts M on Bond's disappearance.

'''Lachaise''' is a villain in the [[James Bond]] film ''The World Is Not Enough''. He was portrayed by [[Patrick Malahide]]. A Swiss banker, he handed over Sir Robert King's recovered money to 007, and had information about the murder of an MI6 agent. Much to Bond's dismay, Lachaise said &quot;I'm just the middleman. Take the money.&quot; Lachaise did know who was the person whom killed the MI6 agent. Renard's employee, the Cigar Girl, killed him with a throwing knife before he could tell James Bond who had the money stolen from.

'''Dr. Mikhail Arkov''' is a villain in the James Bond film ''The World Is Not Enough''. He was portrayed by [[Jeff Nuttall]].

Arkov is a [[nuclear physicist]] stationed in [[Kazakhstan]]. He is Renard's contact within the Kazakhstan facility, and plans to supply Renard with the [[atomic bomb]] that he needs to blow up [[Istanbul]]. However, after Arkov shows himself to be afraid of Bond and orders the plan be abandoned, Renard orders his bodyguard to shoot him (which the aforementioned bodyguard does), and orders Davidov to impersonate him to get the bomb. According to Renard, Arkov has failed his test of devotion.

During his pursuit of Davidov, Bond finds Arkov's body in Davidov's car. After he kills Davidov, Bond takes Arkov's ID card to continue the ruse in an attempt to stop Renard.
