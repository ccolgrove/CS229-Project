'''Georgia''' {{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-Georgia.ogg|Ë|dÊ|Ér|dÊ|â±|É}} is a [[U.S. state|state]] located in the southeastern [[United States]]. It was established in 1732, the last of the original [[Thirteen Colonies]]. The state is named after [[George II of Great Britain|King George&amp;nbsp;II]] of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]]. Georgia was the fourth state to ratify the [[United States Constitution]], on January&amp;nbsp;2, 1788. It declared its secession from the Union on January&amp;nbsp;21, 1861, and was one of the original seven [[Confederate States of America|Confederate states]]. It was the last state to be restored to the Union, on July&amp;nbsp;15, 1870.

The [[2010 United States Census|2010 US Census]] reported 9,687,653 residents, making Georgia the ninth most populous state.&lt;ref name=&quot;2010Census&quot;/&gt;
From 2007 to 2008, 14 of [[List of counties in Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia's counties]] ranked among the nation's 100 fastest-growing, second only to [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.times-herald.com/Local/Coweta-is-the-41st-fastest-growing-county-in-United-States-690912 |title=Coweta is the 41st fastest growing county in United States |publisher=The Times-Herald |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia is known as the ''Peach State'' and the ''Empire State of the South''. [[Atlanta]] is the capital and the most populous city.

Georgia is bordered on the south by [[Florida]]; on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and [[South Carolina]]; on the west by [[Alabama]]; and on the north by [[Tennessee]] and [[North Carolina]]. The northern part of the state is in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], a [[mountain range]] in the vast [[Appalachian Mountains]] system. The central [[Piedmont (United States)|piedmont]] extends from the [[foothills]] to the [[fall line]], where the rivers cascade down in elevation to the continental [[coastal plain]] of the southern part of the state. The highest point in Georgia is [[Brasstown Bald]], 4,784&amp;nbsp;feet (1,458&amp;nbsp;m); the lowest point is [[sea level]].

With an area of {{convert|59,425|sqmi|km2}}, Georgia is ranked 24th in size among the 50 U.S. states. Georgia is the largest state east of the [[Mississippi River]] in terms of land area, although it is the fourth largest (after [[Michigan]], Florida, and [[Wisconsin]]) in total area, a term which includes expanses of water which are part of state territory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netstate.com/states/tables/st_size.htm States Ranked for Total Area, Land Area, and Water Area&amp;nbsp;â NETSTATE.com].

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

===Boundaries===
Beginning from the [[Atlantic Ocean]], the state's eastern border with South Carolina runs up the [[Savannah River]], northwest to its origin at the [[confluence]] of the [[Tugaloo River|Tugaloo]] and [[Seneca River (South Carolina)|Seneca River]]s. It then continues up the Tugaloo (originally Tugalo) and into the [[Chattooga River]], its most significant [[tributary]]. These bounds were decided in the 1797 [[Treaty of Beaufort]], and tested in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in the two ''Georgia v. South Carolina'' cases in 1923 and 1989.

The border then takes a sharp turn around the tip of [[Rabun County, Georgia|Rabun County]], at [[35th parallel north|latitude 35Â°N]], though from this point it diverges slightly south (due to inaccuracies in the original survey). This originally was the Georgia and North Carolina border all the way back to the [[Mississippi River]], until [[Tennessee]] was divided from [[North Carolina]], and [[Alabama]] and [[Mississippi]] (the [[Yazoo lands]]) were taken from Georgia.{{clarify|this seems to get into history which should be somewhere, but this needs to describe current boundaries not past ones|date=February 2011}}

The state's western border then departs in another straight line south-southeastward, at a point southwest of [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]], to meet the westernmost point of the [[Chattahoochee River]] near [[West Point, Georgia|West Point]]. It continues down to the point where it ends at the [[Flint River (Georgia)|Flint River]] (the confluence of the two forming Florida's [[Apalachicola River]]), and goes almost due east and very slightly south, in a straight line to the origin of the [[St. Marys River (Florida/Georgia)|St. Mary's River]], which then forms the remainder of the boundary back to the ocean.

It should be noted that the water boundaries are still set to be the original [[thalweg]] of the rivers. Since then, several have been inundated by lakes created by dams, including the [[ACF River Basin|Apalachicola/Chattahoochee/Flint]] point now under [[Lake Seminole]].

Georgia state legislators have claimed that the state's border with Tennessee has been erroneously placed one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) further south than intended in an 1818 survey, and proposed that the border should be corrected. This would allow Georgia, in the midst of a significant [[drought]], to access water from the [[Tennessee River]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-water10feb10,1,1546673.story?track=rss Drought-stricken Georgia eyes Tennessee's border â and river water] ''Los Angeles Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geology and terrain===
[[File:Map of Georgia elevations.png|thumb|Map of elevations in Georgia]]
{{Main|Geology of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

Each region has its own distinctive characteristics. For instance, the Ridge and Valley, which lies in the northwest corner of the state, includes limestone, sandstone, shale and other sedimentary rocks, which have yielded construction-grade limestone, barite, ocher and small amounts of coal.

===Flora===
{{Main|Ecology of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

Georgia has a diverse mix of flora and fauna. The State of Georgia has approximately 250 tree species and 58 protected plants. Georgia's native trees include [[Juniperus virginiana|red cedar]], a variety of pines, oaks, maples, [[cypress]], ''[[Liquidambar|sweetgum]]'' and scaly-bark and white [[hickory|hickories]], as well as many others.  [[Serenoa|Palmetto]]s and other subtropical flora are found in the southern and coastal regions.  [[Yellow jasmine]], and [[mountain laurel]] make up just a few of the flowering shrubs in the hi.

===Fauna===
[[White-tailed deer|White-tailed (Virginia) deer]] are in nearly all counties. The [[northern mockingbird]] and [[Brown Thrasher]] are among the 160 bird species that live in the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data&quot;&gt;[http://www.city-data.com/states/Georgia-Flora-and-fauna.html Georgia â Flora and fauna â city-data.com]. Retrieved February 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Reptiles include the [[eastern diamondback]], [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]], and [[Agkistrodon piscivorus|cottonmouth]], [[salamander]]s, [[frog]]s, [[alligator]]s and [[toad]]s. There are about 79 species of reptile and 63 amphibians known to live in Georgia.&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data&quot;/&gt;

The most popular freshwater game fish&lt;!---not sure that &quot;gamefish&quot; should be here per se. More under tourism perhaps---&gt; are [[trout]], [[bream]], [[bass (fish)|bass]], and [[catfish]], all but the last of which are produced in state hatcheries for restocking. Popular saltwater game fish include [[red drum]], [[spotted seatrout]], [[flounder]], and [[tarpon]], among many others.  [[Porpoise]]s, [[whale]]s, [[shrimp]], [[oyster]]s, and [[Callinectes sapidus|blue crabs]] are found inshore and offshore of the Georgia coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;city-data&quot;/&gt;

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Georgia (U.S. state)}}
[[File:National-atlas-georgia.PNG|thumb|right|320px|Map of Georgia]]

The majority of Georgia is primarily a [[humid subtropical climate]]. Hot and humid summers are typical, except at the highest elevations. The entire state, including the [[north Georgia mountains]], receives moderate to heavy precipitation, which varies from 45&amp;nbsp;inches (1143&amp;nbsp;mm) in central Georgia&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0346?from=search Monthly Averages for Macon, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.&lt;/ref&gt; to approximately 75&amp;nbsp;inches (1905&amp;nbsp;mm) around the northeast part of the state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/USGA0118?from=search Monthly Averages for Clayton, GA] ''The Weather Channel''.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree to which the weather of a certain region of Georgia is subtropical depends on the latitude, its proximity to the [[Atlantic Ocean]] or [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the elevation. The latter factor is felt chiefly in the mountainous areas of the northern part of the state, which are farther away from the ocean and can be 4500 feet (1350 m) above sea level.  The USDA Plant [[hardiness zone]]s for Georgia range from zone 6b (no colder than {{convert|-5|F}} ) in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]] mountains to zone 8b (no colder than {{convert|15|F}} ) along the [[Atlantic]] coast and [[Florida]] border.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plantmaps.com/interactive-georgia-usda-plant-zone-hardiness-map.php |title=Georgia USDA Plant Hardiness Zone Map |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2010-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest temperature ever recorded is 112 Â°F (44.4 Â°C) at [[Louisville, Georgia|Louisville]] on July 24, 1952,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wheat7.htm Each state's high temperature record] ''USA Today, last updated August 2004''.&lt;/ref&gt; while the lowest is â17 Â°F (â27.2 Â°C) at northern [[Floyd County, Georgia|Floyd County]] on January 27, 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/weather/wcstates.htm Each state's low temperature record] ''USA Today, last updated August 2006''&lt;/ref&gt; Georgia is one of the leading states in frequency of [[tornado]]es, though they rarely are stronger than [[Fujita scale|F1]]. A tornado hit downtown Atlanta on March 14, 2008, causing moderate to severe damage. With a coastline on the [[Atlantic Ocean]], Georgia is also vulnerable to [[hurricane]]s, although direct hurricane strikes were rare during the 20th century. Georgia often is affected by hurricanes that strike the Florida panhandle, weaken over land, and bring strong [[tropical storm]] winds and heavy rain to the interior, as well as hurricanes that come close to the Georgia coastline, brushing the coast on their way north.

==History==
{{Main|History of Georgia (U.S. state)}}

===Early history===
The local [[Mound builder (people)|moundbuilder]] culture, described by [[Hernando de Soto]] in 1540, completely disappeared by 1560. Early on, in the course of European exploration of the area, a number of Spanish explorers visited the inland region of Georgia.

The conflict between Spain and [[Kingdom of England|England]] over control of Georgia began in earnest in about 1670, when the English founded the [[Province of Carolina|Carolina]] colony in present-day South Carolina. Nearly a century earlier, the Spanish of [[Spanish Florida]] had established the missionary provinces of [[Guale]] and [[Mocama]] on the coast and [[Sea Islands]] of present-day Georgia. After decades of fighting, the Carolinians and allied Native Americans permanently destroyed the Spanish mission system during the invasions of 1702 and 1704.

After 1704, Spanish control was limited to [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]] and [[Pensacola, Florida|Pensacola]], both in present-day Florida. The Florida peninsula was subjected to raids as far as the [[Florida Keys]]. The coast of Georgia was occupied by now [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]]-allied Native Americans such as the [[Yamasee]] until the [[Yamasee War]] of 1715â1717, after which the region was depopulated, opening up the possibility of a new British
colony. In 1724, it was first suggested the British colony there be called [[Province of Georgia]] in honor of King [[George II of Great Britain|George II]].

British interest in establishing a colony below South Carolina came from varied sources.  [[Spanish Florida]] was a threat to South Carolina and a haven for runaway slaves. The French in the 1720s established a [[fort]] near present-day [[Montgomery, Alabama]], also a threat to British interests in the region. Traders from [[Charleston, South Carolina]], had established [[trading post]]s as far west as the [[Ocmulgee River]], near present-day [[Macon, Georgia]]. The British trading network kept the [[Muscogee (Creek)|Creek Indians]] allied with them; the French move threatened to wrest these Indians' trade away from the British. These strategic interests made the British government interested in establishing a new colony that would reinforce the British influence in the border country that had been open to Spanish and French penetration.

Meanwhile, many members of the [[British Parliament]] had become concerned about the plight of Britain's debtors. A parliamentary committee investigated and reported on conditions in Britain's debtor prisons. A group of [[philanthropist]]s organized themselves to establish a colony where the &quot;worthy poor&quot; of Britain could reestablish themselves as productive citizens. This goal was seen as both philanthropic, helping these distressed people, and patriotic, simultaneously relieving Britain of the burden of the imprisoned debtors and augmenting Britain's vital mercantile empire by planting new, industrious subjects to strengthen her trade.

In 1732, a group of these philanthropists were granted a royal charter as the Trustees of the Province of Georgia. They carefully selected the first group of colonists to send to the new colony. On 12 February 1733, 113 settlers aboard the ''Anne'' landed at what was to become the city of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]. This day is now known as [[Georgia Day]], which is not a [[public holiday]] but is observed in schools and by some local civic groups. [[James Oglethorpe]], one of the trustees of the colony, traveled with the first group of colonists, laid out the design of the town of Savannah, and acted as governor of the colony, although technically under the trustees there was no &quot;governor.&quot;  Oglethorpe acted as the only trustee present in the colony. When he returned to Britain, a series of disputes ended his tenure governing the colony; Georgia was then led by a series of presidents named by the trustees.

A large majority of the original settlers were English, but at the time Georgia was founded in 1732, the number of non-English immigrants to the 13 colonies was at an all time high. Although religious toleration was not valued in itself, the pragmatic need to attract settlers led to broad religious freedoms. South Carolina wanted German [[Lutherans]], Scottish [[Presbyterians]], [[Moravian Church|Moravians]], French [[Huguenot]]s and [[Jew]]s, and  English and Welsh Protestants whom they valued as a counter to the French and Spanish Catholic and absolutist presence to the south. When the Moravians turned out to be pacifists who refused to serve in the colonial defense against Spain, they were expelled by the British in 1738. Catholics were denied the right to own property.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patricia U. Bonomi 1986, p 32-33&quot;&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, &quot;Under the Cope of Heaven.

Jewish immigrants fleeing the [[Spanish Inquisition]], which was being carried out by the Spanish colonies in the New World, were allowed in after some debate, owing to the leadership of James Oglethorpe. In 1733, over forty Jews fleeing persecution arrived in Savannah, the largest such group to enter an American colony up to that time. Among them was [[Dr. Samuel Nunez]], who was the first doctor in Georgia. He immediately showed his value as a citizen by playing an invaluable role in curbing an epidemic that had already killed scores of English and Scottish settlers, and was credited with saving the colony by General Oglethorpe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patricia U. Bonomi 1986, p 32-33&quot;/&gt;

In 1752, after the government failed to renew subsidies that had helped support the colony, the Trustees turned over control to the [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|crown]]. Georgia became a [[Crown colony#History|crown colony]], with a governor appointed by the king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-816 |title=Trustee Georgia, 1732â1752 |publisher=Georgiaencyclopedia.org |date=2009-07-27 |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, even after Georgia eventually became a royal colony (1752), there were so many dissenters (Protestants of minority denominations, that is, non-Anglican) that the establishment of the Church of England was successfully resisted until 1752. These dissenting churches were the mainstay of the Revolutionary movement, culminating in the War for Independence from Britain, through the patriotic and anti-authoritarian sermons of their ministers, and the use of the churches to organize rebellion. Whereas the [[Anglican Church]] tended to preach stability and loyalty to the Crown, other Protestant sects preached heavily from the [[Old Testament]] and
emphasized freedom and equality of all men before God, as well as the moral responsibility to rebel against tyrants.&lt;ref&gt;Patricia U. Bonomi, &quot;Under the Cope of Heaven.

===Revolutionary War history===
{{Main|Georgia during the American Revolution}}

[[Province of Georgia]] was one of the [[Thirteen Colonies]] that revolted against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] rule in the [[American Revolution]] by signing the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]], despite a large population of people loyal to the crown. Since Georgia was a relatively new colony at the time compared to the other twelve colonies, Georgia was not as active in the war. Also, the Georgian militia was not fully developed, which led to the capture of [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] by British forces in December 1778.

American forces under the command of [[Benjamin Lincoln|General Benjamin Lincoln]] combined with French forces under the command of [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Charles Henri Comte dâEstaing]] to lay [[siege]] to [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] in 1779. The attempt was unsuccessful, and [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]] remained in British hands until the end of the war. During the war, nearly one-third of the slaves, more than 5,000 enslaved African Americans, exercised their desire for independence by escaping and joining British forces, where they were promised freedom. Some went to Great Britain or the Caribbean; others were resettled in Canada provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/hyperhistorian.cfm |title=Digital History |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other estimates show an even greater impact from the war, when slaves escaped during the disruption. &quot;The sharp decline between 1770 and 1790 in the proportion of the population made up of blacks (almost all of whom were slaves) [went] from 45.2 percent to 36.1 percent in Georgia.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter
Kolchin, ''American Slavery: 1619â1877'', New York: Hill and Wang, 1994, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the war, Georgia became the fourth state of the [[United States of America]] after ratifying the [[United States Constitution]] on 2 January 1788. Georgia established its first state constitution in 1777. The state established new constitutions in 1788, 1799, [[Georgia Constitutional Convention (1861)|1861]], 1865, 1868, 1877, 1945, 1976, and 1983, for a total of 10 â more constitutions than any other state, except for Louisiana, which has had 11.

In 1829, gold was discovered in the north Georgia mountains, resulting in the [[Georgia Gold Rush]], the second [[gold rush]] in U.S. history. A Federal mint was established in [[Dahlonega, Georgia]] and continued to operate until 1861. An influx of white settlers pressured the U.S. government to take the land away from the citizens of the [[Cherokee Nation (19th century)|Cherokee Nation]], who operated their own government, complete with a written constitution, and who did not recognize the authority of the state of Georgia.
[[File:Map of CSA - Georgia highlighted.png|thumb|left|A map of the Confederate States of America with Georgia's position highlighted]]
The dispute culminated in the [[Indian Removal Act]] of 1830, under which all eastern tribes were sent west to [[Indian reservation]]s in present-day Oklahoma. In [[Worcester v. Georgia]], the Supreme Court in 1832 ruled that states were not permitted to redraw the boundaries of Indian lands, but President [[Andrew Jackson]] and the state of Georgia ignored the ruling. In 1838, his successor, [[Martin Van Buren]] dispatched federal troops to round up the Cherokee and deport them west of the [[Mississippi River|Mississippi]]. This forced relocation, known as the [[Trail of Tears]], led to the death of over 4,000 Cherokees.

===Confederate history===
{{Main|Georgia in the American Civil War}}
On January 18, 1861, Georgia joined the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and became a major [[Theater (warfare)|theater]] of the [[American Civil War]]. Major battles took place at [[Battle of Chickamauga|Chickamauga]], [[Battle of Kennesaw Mountain|Kennesaw Mountain]], and [[Battle of Atlanta|Atlanta]]. In December 1864, a large swath of the state from Atlanta to Savannah was destroyed during General [[William Tecumseh Sherman]]'s [[Sherman's March to the Sea|March to the Sea]]. This event served as the historical background for the 1936 novel ''[[Gone with the Wind]]'' and the [[Gone with the Wind (film)|1939 film]] of the same name. On July 15, 1870, following [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], Georgia became the last former Confederate state to be reseated in Congress and restored to the [[United States|Union]]. On April 29, 2009, [[List of Governors of Georgia|Governor]] [[Sonny Perdue]] signed into law a bill that will make April Confederate History and Heritage month in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadafreepress.com/index.php/article/10742 |title=Governor Perdue signs Confederate History Month bill |publisher=Canadafreepress.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil War to World War II===
It took nearly 80 years to recover from the devastation of the Civil War. Georgia, along with the rest of the South had been destroyed financially. With job creation at a standstill, [[Jim Crow]] laws were politically popular to ensure that the better available jobs were filled by whites.

A new economy arose during World War II, one that needed a more highly skilled labor force, making the overturning of Jim Crow laws by the US Congress and US Supreme Court, less unpopular than might have been the case at an earlier time.

===Capitals===
Georgia has had five official [[List of capitals in the United States|state capitals]]: colonial [[Savannah, Georgia|Savannah]]; which later alternated with [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]]; then (for a decade) [[Louisville, Georgia|Louisville]] (pronounced Lewis-ville, {{IPA|/ËluÉªsvÉªl/}}); and [[Milledgeville, Georgia|Milledgeville]], from 1806 through 1868 (which included the [[American Civil War]] period). The [[Georgia General Assembly|state legislature]] also often met at temporary sites, including [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] (especially during the turmoil of the Civil War). In 1868, the capital was moved to the reconstructed city of Atlanta â one with better access by [[railroad]].

In 2007, Georgia had an estimated population of 9,544,750 which was an increase of 180,809 from the previous year, and an increase of 1,177,125 since 2000. This includes a natural increase since the last census of 438,939 people (that is 849,414 births minus 410,475 deaths) and an increase from net migration of 606,673 people into the state. Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 228,415 people, and migration within the country produced a net increase of 378,258 people.

The state stood sixth in the country for illegal immigrants. There were 35,000 in 1990; the count more than doubled from January 2000 to January 2009, at 480,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first=Associated Press | last= | title=Illegals on rise in Southeast | url=http://www.star-telegram.com/2010/02/23/1991912/illegal-immigrant-numbers-rise.html| work= | publisher=Florida Today | location=Melbourne, Florida | pages= 6A | date=24 February 2010 | id= | accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---footnote matches hardcopy, not url---&gt;

According to the [[2010 U.S. Census]], Georgia had a population of 9,687,653. In terms of race and ethnicity, the state was 59.7% White (55.9% Non-Hispanic White Alone), 30.5% Black or African American, 0.3% American Indian and Alaska Native, 3.2% Asian, 0.1% Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander, 4.0% from Some Other Race, and 2.1% from Two or More Races.

As of 2005, 90% of Georgia residents age 5 and older speak only English at home and 5.6% speak Spanish. [[French language|French]] is the third most spoken language at 0.9%, followed by [[German language|German]] at 0.8% and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] at 0.6%. As of 2004, 7.7% of its population was reported as under 5 years of age, 26.4% under 18, and 9.6% were 65 or older. Also as of 2004, females made up approximately 50.6% of the population and African Americans made up approximately 29.6%.

Historically, about half of Georgia's population was composed of African Americans who, prior to the Civil War, were almost exclusively enslaved. The [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of hundreds of thousands of blacks from the rural South to the industrial North from 1914â1970 reduced the African American population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/urban/pubs/20040524_Frey.pdf William H.

Georgia had the second fastest growing Asian population growth in the U.S. from 1990 to 2000, more than doubling in size during the ten-year period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oca-georgia.org/AtlantaProfile.pdf ]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to census estimates, Georgia ranks third among the states in terms of the percent of the total population that is African American (after [[Mississippi]] and [[Louisiana]]) and third in numerical Black population after [[New York]] and [[Florida]]. Georgia was the state with the largest numerical increase in the black population from 2006 to 2007 with 84,000. 

Georgia is the state with the third-lowest percentage of older people (65 or older), at 10.1 percent (as of 2008).&lt;ref&gt;[http://quickfacts.census.gov/qfd/states/13000.html Georgia census Quickfacts]{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The colonial settlement of large numbers of [[Scottish American]], [[English American]] and [[Scotch-Irish American]]s in the mountains and piedmont, and coastal settlement by some [[English American]]s and African Americans, have strongly influenced the state's culture in food, language and music. The concentration of Africans imported to coastal areas in the 18th century repeatedly from rice growing regions of West Africa led to the development of [[Gullah|Gullah-Geechee]] language and culture in the Low Country among African Americans. They share a unique heritage in which African traditions of food, religion and culture were continued more than in some other areas. In the creolization of Southern culture, their foodways became an integral part of all Southern cooking in the Low Country.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080504151611/http://www.georgia.org/Travel/Early+Mountain+Life.htm Early Mountain Life], [http://www.well.com/~mp/gAmOrigins.html Who are Americans]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Like most other Southern states, Georgia is largely Protestant Christian.

There are 15 Fortune 500 companies and 26 Fortune 1000 companies with headquarters in Georgia, including such names as [[Home Depot]], [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], [[Coca Cola]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[Aflac]], [[Southern Company]], and [[SunTrust Banks]]. Georgia has over 1,700 internationally headquartered facilities representing 43 countries, employing more than 112,000 Georgians with an estimated capital investment of $22.7 billion.

===Agriculture and industry===
Georgia's [[agricultural]] outputs are [[poultry]] and [[Egg (food)|eggs]], [[pecan]]s, [[peach]]es, [[peanut]]s, [[rye]], [[cattle]], [[Pig|hog]]s, [[dairy product]]s, [[turfgrass]], [[tobacco]], and [[vegetable]]s. Its industrial outputs are [[textile]]s and [[apparel]], [[transport]]ation equipment, [[cigarette]]s, food processing, [[paper]] products, [[chemical]] products, and [[electric]] equipment. [[Tourism]] also makes an important contribution to the economy. Atlanta has been the site of enormous growth in real estate, service, and communications industries.

[[Atlanta]] has a very large effect on the state of Georgia and the Southeastern United States. The city is an ever growing addition to communications, industry, transportation, tourism, and government.

Food is also a major industry in Georgia, with widespread farms producing peanuts, corn, and soybeans across middle and south Georgia. The state is the number one producer of pecans in the world, with the region around Albany in southwest Georgia being the center of Georgia's pecan production. Gainesville in northeast Georgia touts itself as the Poultry Capital of the World.

Industry in Georgia is quite diverse. Major products in the mineral and timber industry include a variety of pines, clays, stones, and sands. The clay [[palygorskite]], known as attapulgite, was named because of its abundance near the Decatur County town of Attapulgus in the deep southwest corner of the state. Attapulgite has numerous medical, cosmetic, and industrial uses. Textile industry is located around the cities of [[Rome, Georgia|Rome]], [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] and along the I-75 corridor between Atlanta and [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]] to include the towns of [[Cartersville, Georgia|Cartersville]], [[Calhoun, Georgia|Calhoun]], [[Ringgold, Georgia|Ringgold]], and [[Dalton, Georgia|Dalton]] (the Carpet Capital of the World). In November 2009, Kia started production at the first U.S. Kia Motors plant, [[Kia Design and Manufacturing Facilities#Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia (KMMG)|Kia Motors Manufacturing Georgia]] in [[West Point, Georgia|West Point]]. 

With its great population base and location along major transportation routes, Atlanta is a leading center of tourism, transportation, communications, government, and industry. Some industries there include automobile and aircraft manufacturing, food and chemical processing, printing, publishing, and large corporations. Some of the corporations headquartered in the metropolitan Atlanta area are: [[Arby's]], [[Chick-fil-A]], [[The Coca-Cola Company]], [[Georgia-Pacific]], [[Hooters]], [[ING Americas]], [[Cox Enterprises]], [[Delta Air Lines]], [[The Home Depot]], [[Newell Rubbermaid]], [[Primerica Financial Services]], [[United Parcel Service]], [[Waffle House]], and [[NCR Corporation]].  Major corporations in other parts of the state include: [[Aflac]], [[CareSouth]], [[Gulfstream Aerospace]], [[Mohawk Industries]], and [[Zaxby's]].

Georgia has one of the strongest military presences in the country. Several United States military installations are located in the state including [[Fort Stewart]], [[Hunter Army Airfield]], [[Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay]], [[Fort Benning]], [[Moody Air Force Base]], [[Robins Air Force Base]], [[Naval Air Station Atlanta]], [[Fort McPherson]], [[Fort Gillem]], [[Fort Gordon]], [[Marine Corps Logistics Base Albany]] [[Dobbins Air Reserve Base]], [[Coast Guard Air Station Savannah]] and Coast Guard Station Brunswick. However, due to the latest round of [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]] cuts, Forts Gillem and McPherson will be closing and NAS Atlanta will be transferred to the [[Georgia National Guard]].

===Energy use and production===
Georgia's electricity generation and consumption are among the highest in the United States, with coal being the primary electrical generation of fuel. However, the state also has two nuclear power plants which contribute less than one fourth of Georgia's electricity generation. The statistics are 75% coal, 16% nuclear, 7% oil and natural gas, and 1% hydroelectric/other. The leading area of energy consumption is the industrial sector because Georgia &quot;is a leader in the energy-intensive wood and paper products industry&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/state/state_energy_profiles.cfm?sid=GA Energy Information Administration]. Retrieved December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===State taxes===
Georgia's personal [[income tax]] ranges from 1% to 6% within six [[tax bracket]]s. There is a 4% state [[sales tax]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gppf.org/pub/Taxes/sales_tax.pdf Georgia Public Policy Foundation].&lt;/ref&gt; which is not applied to [[prescription drug]]s, certain medical devices, and [[groceries]]. Each county may add up to a 2% [[SPLOST]]. Counties participating in [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] have another 1%. The city of Atlanta (in two counties, roughly 90% in Fulton and 10% in Dekalb) has the only city sales tax (1%, total 8%) for fixing its aging sewers. Local taxes are almost always charged on groceries but never prescriptions. Up to 1% of a SPLOST can go to [[homestead exemption]]s (the HOST). All taxes are collected by the [[Georgia Department of Revenue]] and then properly distributed according to any agreements that each county has with its cities.

[[File:GeorgiaCapitolBuilding.jpg|thumb|The [[Georgia State Capitol]] Building in Atlanta with the distinctive gold dome.]]

The capital of Georgia is Atlanta. As with all other [[U.S. state]]s and the federal government, Georgia's government is based on the [[Separation of powers|separation of legislative, executive and judicial power]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legis.state.ga.us/legis/2007_08/senate/senkids.htm Senate Kids]. Retrieved December 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Executive authority in the state rests with the [[Governor (United States)|governor]], currently [[Nathan Deal]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]). (See [[List of Governors of Georgia]]). Both the [[List of Governors of Georgia|governor]] and [[Lieutenant Governor of Georgia|lieutenant governor]] are elected on separate ballots to four-year terms of office. Unlike the federal government, but like many other U.S. States, most of the executive officials who comprise the governor's cabinet are elected by the citizens of Georgia rather than appointed by the governor.

Legislative authority resides in the General Assembly, composed of the [[Georgia State Senate|Senate]] and [[Georgia House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. The Lieutenant Governor [[President of the Senate|presides over the Senate]], while the House of Representatives selects their own Speaker. The [[Georgia (U.S. state) Constitution|Georgia Constitution]] mandates a maximum of 56 senators, elected from single-member districts, and a minimum of 180 representatives, apportioned among representative districts (which sometimes results in more than one representative per district); there are currently 56 senators and 180 representatives. The term of office for senators and representatives is two years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/conart3.htm Constitution of Georgia Article III Section II].

State judicial authority rests with the state [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Supreme Court]] and [[Georgia Court of Appeals|Court of Appeals]], which have statewide authority.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gasupreme.us/scbroch.php Supreme Court Brochure]. Retrieved December 30, 2007. {{Wayback | url=http://www.gasupreme.us/scbroch.php &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; | date=20070927121254 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there are smaller courts which have more limited geographical jurisdiction, including State Courts, Superior Courts, Magistrate Courts and Probate Courts. Justices of the Supreme Court and judges of the Court of Appeals are elected statewide by the citizens in non-partisan elections to six-year terms. Judges for the smaller courts are elected by the state's citizens who live within that court's jurisdiction to four-year terms.

===Local government===
Georgia consists of 159 [[county (US)|counties]]; more than any other state except [[Texas]] which consists of 254 counties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cviog.uga.edu/Projects/gainfo/countyhistory.htm A Brief History of Georgia Counties].

Counties have been named for prominent figures in both American and Georgian history, but many bear names with Native American origin.  Counties in Georgia have their own elected legislative branch, usually called the Board of Commissioners, which usually also has executive authority in the county.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?path=/GovernmentPolitics/Government/LocalGovernment&amp;id=h-589 Georgia's County Governments]. Retrieved December 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Several counties have a [[Sole Commissioner]] government, with legislative and executive authority vested in a single person. Georgia is the only state with Sole
Commissioner counties. Georgia's Constitution provides all counties and cities with &quot;[[home rule]]&quot; authority, and so the county commissions have considerable power to pass legislation within their county as a [[municipality]] would.

{{See|list of Georgia counties}}

Besides the counties, Georgia only defines cities as local units of government. Every incorporated town, no matter how small, is legally a city. Georgia does not provide for [[township (United States)|townships]] or [[independent cities]] (though there is a movement in the Legislature to provide for townships){{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} but does allow [[consolidated city-county]] governments by local [[referendum]]. So far, only [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]], [[Augusta, Georgia|Augusta]], [[Athens, Georgia|Athens]], and [[Cusseta, Georgia|Cusseta]] have done this.  [[Conyers, Georgia|Conyers]] is studying possibly becoming consolidated with [[Rockdale County, Georgia|Rockdale County]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Recently, Savannah has consolidated its police department with the county [[police]] department and is currently studying possible [[Consolidated city-county|consolidation]] with [[Chatham County, Georgia|Chatham County]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

There is no true [[metropolitan government]] in Georgia, though the [[Atlanta Regional Commission]] and [[Georgia Regional Transportation Authority]] do provide some services, and the ARC must approve all major [[land development]] projects in the [[Atlanta metropolitan area]].

Until recently, Georgia's state government had the longest unbroken record of single-party dominance, by the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], of any state in the Union. This record was established partly by disfranchisement of most blacks and many poor whites in the early 20th century, lasting into the 1960s.

After Reconstruction, white Democrats regained power, especially by legal [[disfranchisement]] of most African Americans and many poor whites through erection of barriers to voter registration. In 1900, shortly before Georgia adopted a disfranchising constitutional amendment in 1908, blacks comprised 47% of the state's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1900 US Census, University of Virginia].

Retrieved 23 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; White, one-party rule was solidified.

For over 130 years, from 1872 to 2003, Georgians only elected white Democratic governors, and white Democrats held the majority of seats in the General Assembly. Most of the Democrats elected throughout these years were Southern Democrats or [[Dixiecrat]]s, who were very conservative by national standards. This continued after the segregationist period, which ended legally in the 1960s. According to the 1960 census, the proportion of Georgia's population that was African American had decreased to 28%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fisher.lib.virginia.edu/collections/stats/histcensus/php/state.php Historical Census Browser, 1960 US Census, University of Virginia]. Retrieved 13 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  After a Democratic-controlled Congress passed civil rights legislation to secure voting and civil rights in the mid-1960s, most African Americans in the South joined the Democratic Party.

Progress in civil rights was demonstrated with the election of former Georgia Governor [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 to the [[President of the United States|U.S. Presidency]].

The political dominance of Democrats ended in 2003, when then-Governor [[Roy Barnes]] was defeated by Republican [[Sonny Perdue]], a state legislator and former Democrat himself. While Democrats retained control of the State House, they lost their majority in the Senate when four Democrats switched parties. They lost the House in the 2004 election. Republicans now control all three partisan elements of the state government.

Even before 2003, the state had become increasingly supportive of Republicans in Presidential elections. It has supported a Democrat for president only three times since 1960. In 1976 and 1980, native son Jimmy Carter carried the state; in 1992, the former Arkansas governor [[Bill Clinton]] narrowly won the state. Generally, Republicans are strongest in the predominantly white suburban (especially the Atlanta suburbs) and rural portions of the state.&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN.com: Election 2004&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004//pages/results/states/GA/P/00/epolls.0.html |title=Election 2004 |publisher=CNN.com |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these areas were represented by conservative Democrats in the state legislature well into the 21st century. One of the most conservative of these was U.S. Congressman  [[Larry McDonald]], former head of the [[John Birch Society]] who was killed when the [[Soviet Union]] shot down [[KAL 007]] near [[Sakhalin Island]]. Democratic candidates have tended to win a higher percentage of the vote in the areas where black voters are most numerous,&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN.com: Election 2004&quot;/&gt; as well as in the cities (especially Atlanta and Athens), and the rural [[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]] region that travels through the central and southwestern portion of the state.

{{As of|2001|alt=As of the 2001}} [[reapportionment]], the state has 13 seats in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], which are currently held by 7 Republicans and 6 Democrats.

In recent events, Democrat [[Jim Martin (Georgia politician)|Jim Martin]] ran against incumbent Republican Senator [[Saxby Chambliss]]. Chambliss failed to acquire the necessary 50 percent of votes, a Libertarian Party candidate receiving the remainder of votes. In the [[runoff election]] held on December 2, 2008, Chambliss became only the second Georgia Republican to be reelected to the U.S. Senate.

During the 1960s and 1970s, Georgia made significant changes in civil rights, governance, and economic growth focused on Atlanta. It was a bedrock of the emerging &quot;[[New South]]&quot;.

In the 21st century, many conservative Democrats, including former U.S. Senator and governor [[Zell Miller]], have decided to support Republicans. The state's socially conservative bent results in wide support for such measures as restrictions on [[abortion]]. Its voters passed a ban on [[same-sex marriage]] with 76% voting yes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/wiki/index.php/Georgia_Constitutional_Amendment_1_%282004%29 |title=Georgia Marriage Amendment, Question 1 (2004) |publisher=Ballotpedia |date= |accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
