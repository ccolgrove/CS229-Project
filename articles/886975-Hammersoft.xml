'''Interstate 495''' (abbreviated '''I-495''') is the designation of an [[Interstate Highway]] half-[[beltway]] in [[Massachusetts]]. It was the longest auxiliary Interstate Highway of its kindâmeasuring 120.74 miles (194.40 kilometers)âuntil 1996, when the [[Pennsylvania Route 9|PA Route 9]] section of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] was redesignated as [[Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania)|Interstate 476]], making it about {{convert|11|mi|km}} longer than I-495.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paturnpike.com/news/1996/Nov/nr11-01-96.aspx Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission], November 1, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pahighways.com/interstates/I476.html Interstate 476, pahighways.com.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kurumi.com/roads/3di/long3di.html#longest Shortest and Longest 3-digit interstates, kurumi.com.] Note the discrepancy between the mileage listed on kurumi.com and the actual mileage indicated by the exit list from [[Interstate 476 (Pennsylvania)#Exit_list|Interstate 476]]. [http://maps.google.com/maps?f=d&amp;saddr=I-476+S+%4041.485973,+-75.686810&amp;daddr=Unknown+road+%4039.868198,+-75.344985&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=15303337189087951858,41.485973,-75.686810%3B15506315128338708761,39.867273,-75.343939%3B16313230114491641772,39.868198,-75.344985&amp;mra=ls&amp;sll=39.860472,-75.347328&amp;sspn=0.068388,0.154495&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=40.554244,-75.470324&amp;spn=2.165983,4.943848&amp;z=8 Google Maps] lists the distance as {{convert|130|mi|km}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
I-495 has its northern terminus at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] in [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]]. The highway, forming an arc approximately {{convert|30|mi|km}} from [[Boston]], intersects eight major radial [[expressways]] along its route: [[Interstate 93]], [[U.S. Route 3]], [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]], [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]], [[Interstate 90]] (The [[Massachusetts Turnpike]]), [[Route 24 (Massachusetts)|Route 24]] and Interstate 95 (twice). It has its southern terminus in [[Wareham, Massachusetts|Wareham]], where [[Interstate 195 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] and [[Route 25 (Massachusetts)|Route 25]] meet. Originally, the stretch from Route 24 to Interstate 195 was signed as Route 25; that status now only begins south of I-195.

I-495 is often regarded as the outermost boundary of the [[Greater Boston]] region: its northern segment parallels the border with New Hampshire, at one point coming as close as 400 feet; its southern end is just north of [[Cape Cod]]; west of I-495 is the [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] area and Central Massachusetts. In a more restricted sense, The [[Yankee Division Highway]] ([[Route 128 (Massachusetts)|Route 128]] and the first {{convert|6.5|mi|km}} of [[Interstate 93]]), which is parallel to I-495 but closer to the city, is sometimes regarded as the outer boundary of Boston's immediate [[suburb]]s.

The stretch of 495 north and east of [[Route 2 (Massachusetts)|Route 2]] until its terminus at [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] in Salisbury is also the main limited access highway connecting the communities of the more urbanized [[Merrimack Valley]] region, separate from its purpose as a beltway for Boston.

==Route description==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2010}}
Interstate 495 begins as the direct continuation of [[Massachusetts Route 25|Route 25]] at the intersection with [[Interstate 195 (Rhode Island-Massachusetts)|Interstate 195]] in [[Wareham, Massachusetts|West Wareham]].  The junction includes the unusual transition of shrinking from the six-lane Route 25 to the four-lane interstate, due to the third lane of Route 25 joining to and from I-195.  The road heads roughly northwest, passing through the towns of [[Rochester, Massachusetts|Rochester]] and [[Middleborough, Massachusetts|Middleborough]] (where the road meets [[U.S. Route 44]]) as a four lane highway before entering [[Bristol County, Massachusetts|Bristol County]], crossing the [[Taunton River]] at [[Raynham, Massachusetts|Raynham]].  There, it becomes a six-lane highway just southeast of the [[Massachusetts Route 24|Route 24]] interchange (which is actually in neighboring [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]]).

The road continues northwest through [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] and [[Norton, Massachusetts|Norton]] before entering [[Mansfield, Massachusetts|Mansfield]], where there is a short exit lane concurrency with [[Massachusetts Route 140|Route 140]].  Interstate 495 makes its southern junction with its parent route, [[Interstate 95 in Massachusetts|Interstate 95]] on the border between Mansfield in Bristol County and [[Foxborough, Massachusetts|Foxborough]] in [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County]].  The road continues through [[Plainville, Massachusetts|Plainville]] (where there is a junction with [[U.S. Route 1]], a popular exit for those heading to [[Gillette Stadium]]) and [[Wrentham, Massachusetts|Wrentham]] (where the Wrentham Village Premium Outlets lie beside the highway at [[Massachusetts Route 1A|Route 1A]]) before beginning to turn to a more northerly direction through [[Franklin, Massachusetts|Franklin]] and [[Bellingham, Massachusetts|Bellingham]].

Interstate 495 then begins to weave between far eastern [[Worcester County, Massachusetts|Worcester County]] and western [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex County]], passing through [[Milford, Massachusetts|Milford]] in Worcester County, to [[Hopkinton, Massachusetts|Hopkinton]] in Middlesex County (where the junction with the [[Massachusetts Turnpike]], or Interstate 90, is located).  It then passes back into Worcester County a second time, going through Westborough (where the road meets [[Massachusetts Route 9|Route 9]]) and [[Southborough, Massachusetts|Southborough]].  It then returns to Middlesex County briefly in the towns of [[Marlborough, Massachusetts|Marlborough]] (where the road meets [[U.S. Route 20]] and [[Interstate 290 (Massachusetts)|Interstate 290]]) and [[Hudson, Massachusetts|Hudson]] before making its final pass through Worcester County in the towns of [[Berlin, Massachusetts|Berlin]], [[Bolton, Massachusetts|Bolton]] (where the road finally begins to turn northeasterly) and [[Harvard, Massachusetts|Harvard]].

After weaving through the edge of Worcester County, the road finally re-enters Middlesex County, passing through [[Boxborough, Massachusetts|Boxborough]], [[Littleton, Massachusetts|Littleton]] (where there is an intersection with [[Massachusetts Route 2|Route 2]]), [[Westford, Massachusetts|Westford]] and [[Chelmsford, Massachusetts|Chelmsford]].  At the Chelmsford-[[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]] line lies the intersection with [[U.S. Route 3]] and the [[Lowell Connector]] (formerly Business Spur 495).  The road continues through Lowell and [[Tewksbury, Massachusetts|Tewksbury]] before entering [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]] at [[Andover, Massachusetts|Andover]].

In Andover, the road has a junction with [[Interstate 93]].  It then enters the city of [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], where the road turns due north, crossing the [[Shawsheen River]] into [[North Andover, Massachusetts|North Andover]] before crossing the [[Merrimack River]] at the O'Reilly Bridge back into Lawrence.  It then heads into [[Methuen, Massachusetts|Methuen]], where the road turns back to a northeasterly route after the junction with the [[Massachusetts Route 213|Loop Connector]] (Rte. 213).  The road heads into [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]], crossing the Merrimack twice more at a bend in the [[Bradford, Massachusetts|Bradford]] section of town.  It passes north of downtown Haverhill, coming within 150 yards of the [[New Hampshire]] state line, the closest the road comes to leaving the state.  Interstate 495 then passes through the towns of [[Merrimac, Massachusetts|Merrimac]] and [[Amesbury, Massachusetts|Amesbury]] before finally terminating as it merges with Interstate 95 in [[Salisbury, Massachusetts|Salisbury]], approximately {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} south of where that interstate enters New Hampshire.

Throughout its path, the road passes closely to several existing state highways.  From Wareham through to the Middleborough Rotary, it parallels [[Massachusetts Route 28|Route 28]].  For much of the stretch between Norton and Milford, the road is within a few miles of Route 140, with two junctions of that highway in Mansfield and Franklin.  From Milford to Bolton, the road passes just west of [[Massachusetts Route 85|Route 85]].  Much of the northern third of the route also roughly parallels [[Massachusetts Route 110]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bostonroads.com/roads/I-495_MA/ BostonRoads.com, ''Outer Circumferential Highway: Historical Overview'' Retrieved Jan. 24, 2010]{{Self-published inline|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Possible Improvements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
Some improvements expected to come to I-495 in the next few years include a project that will install fiber optic cable, traffic cameras &amp; VMS Signs on I-495 from I-90 (Hopkinton) to I-93 (Andover). The new ITS system will help commuters and the state better understand the traffic congestion on I-495.
