[[Image:War of Conquest logo.png|thumb]]'''War of Conquest''' (abbreviated '''WoC''') is a [[Massively multiplayer online real-time strategy|massively multiplayer online real-time strategy (MMORTS) game]] created by [[Rhode Island|Rhode Island based]] IronZog in April 2002.  The current version, [[Development stage#Beta|Beta]] Version 3, has been online since October 23, 2002.  The game is a two-dimensional [[Java (programming language)|Java]]-based landscape in which each user is a member of a nation.  Each nation has a maximum of six players, one of which is the [[Sovereignty|Sovereign]] and is responsible for determining the ranks of the other members.  

The main goal of a nation is to research new technologies by leveling up. Credits are used to purchase permanent and temporary technologies and fortifications for a nation. Players can deposit money into the game to purchase credits or can hold an &quot;Orb&quot; to receive money that can be exchanged for credits or cashed out. There are four kinds of orbs. Noontide orbs, being the least valuable. Shadow orbs which are more valuable, Along with Desitiny orbs which are slightly above. And the Fire orb which is located on a peninusla and big nations fight for this orb that offers high prizes. As of January 2010 Iron Zog has distributed over $119778 in prizes to its players since the game start. And a new auto updating client has been released in October 2006.A Large Update occurred in 2009 changing the display of the game increasing the resolution of the game. Another update was due in late 2009, but has since been stalled indefinitely for unknown reasons.

In May of 2011 Kete Games acquired the rights to further develop and publish War of Conquest.  The current plan is to close all servers on June 27th of 2011 for a period of redevelopment, with an expected re-release in Q4 2011. This will be followed by another major and related release in 2012.

We will soon be opening the forums to discussion of this event. We hope all your questions can be answered once the forums are re-opened.
