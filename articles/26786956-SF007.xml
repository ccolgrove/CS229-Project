'''''Les Chevaliers du ciel''''' ({{lang-en|Sky Fighters}}) is a 2005 French film directed by [[GÃ©rard PirÃ¨s]] about two air force pilots preventing a terrorist attack on the [[Bastille Day]] celebrations in [[Paris]]. It is based on ''[[Tanguy et Laverdure]]'', a [[Franco-Belgian comics|comics]] series by [[Jean-Michel Charlier]] and [[Albert Uderzo]] â of ''[[Asterix|AstÃ©rix]]'' fame, which was also made into a hugely successful [[television program|TV series]] from 1967 to 1969 making Tanguy and Laverdure, the two main heroes, part of popular [[Francophone]] culture.

== Plot ==
The film starts out at the [[Farnborough Airshow]] where a demo [[Dassault-Breguet Mirage 2000|Mirage 2000-5]] is stolen. Captains Antoine ''Walk'in'' Marchelli ([[BenoÃ®t Magimel]]) and SÃ©bastien ''Fahrenheit'' Vallois ([[Clovis Cornillac]]) are instructed to escort it back. They find the rogue Mirage flying stealthy under a [[Qatar Airways]] [[Airbus A340]]. They get the order to abort when the rogue Mirage is about to fire on ''Fahrenheit''. ''Walk'in'' is forced to shoot the demo Mirage down when it is about to fire a [[R550 Magic]] missile at his [[wingman]], disobeying an order which results in Marchelli being kicked out of the air force. Vallois resigns when informed by Marchelli.

They get a promise to be reinstated if they fly a [[Cannonball Baker Sea-To-Shining-Sea Memorial Trophy Dash|Cannonball race]] over hostile territory to the [[Horn of Africa]] for ''Special Missions'' to help sell the Mirage to an Asian customer.  Its competition consists of an [[F-16]].

During the race, their [[Tanker (aircraft)|tanker]] does not show up for in-flight refueling because terrorists have killed the crew.  This forces the Mirages to land in hostile territory where their aircraft are taken. ''Walk'in'' and ''Fahrenheit'' manage to escape with one of the planes and destroy another, one plane however remains in the hands of the terrorists.

The terrorists plan to shoot down a tanker over Paris during the Bastille Day celebrations but '''Walk'in'' and ''Fahrenheit'' intercept the rogue Mirage and shoot it down over an unpopulated area.

== Filming ==

''Les Chevaliers du Ciel'' was filmed in co-operation with the [[French Air Force]].  Initially the standard safety rules applied, but eventually the minimum allowed [[altitude]] was reduced to 3 m (10 ft) and the minimum distance between aircraft was reduced to 1 m (3 ft).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The filming of these flight sequences seen in the film were mainly done from the air, as opposed to ''[[Top Gun]]'' where most of the filming was done from the ground.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

To achieve this, one of the Mirage's external fuel tanks was modified to fit a camera.  A [[High-definition video|HD camera]] was considered for this purpose, but it did not fit in the fuel pod. [[Tracking shot]]s were done from a hired [[Lear Jet]].

Additionally, jet aircraft are not allowed to fly over Paris.  As a result of this, all the Paris filming had to be done on the actual Bastille Day (14 July) for which the filming crew got special permission.
