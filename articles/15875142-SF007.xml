The '''fit-PC''' is a small, light, fan-less [[nettop]] computer manufactured by the [[Israel]]i company CompuLab. 

Three fit-PC models are available - fit-PC 1.0 was introduced in July 2007, fit-PC Slim was introduced in September 2008, and fit-PC 2 was introduced in May 2009.  The [[Information appliance|device]] is power-efficient (about 5 W) and therefore considered{{by whom?|date=January 2011}} to be a [[green computing]] project, capable of using [[open source software]] and creating minimal [[electronic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tiniest Linux system, yet? | url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2102697273.html | publisher = LinuxDevices.com | date = September 16, 2008 | accessdate = 2008-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tiny PC sips power, runs Linux | url = http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS5551137361.html | publisher = LinuxDevices.com | date = July 19, 2007 | accessdate = 2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Fit PCâA Tiny Linux PC that Fits Anywhere | url = http://www.extremetech.com/article2/0,1697,2194862,00.asp | publisher = ExtremeTech | accessdate = 2008-02-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current models==

===fit-PC2===
On February 19, 2009, Compulab announced the fit-PC2, which is &quot;a major upgrade to the fit-PC product line&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = New fit-PC model - fit-PC2 | url = http://www.fit-pc.com/forum/viewtopic.php?t=778 | publisher = CompuLab | accessdate = 2009-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Detailed specifications for the fit-PC2 include an Intel Atom Z5xx ''[[Silverthorne (microprocessor)|Silverthorne]]'' processor (1.1/1.6/2.0&amp;nbsp;GHz options), up to 2GB of [[Random-access memory|RAM]], 160GB SATA Hard Drive, GigaBit LAN and more. The fit-PC2 is also capable of HD-playback. All still running on just 6W.With fit-PC2 you save 96% of the power used by a standard desktop. fit-PC2 is the most power efficient PC on the [[Energy_star|Energy-Star]] list.
The fit-PC2 is based on the [[GMA 500]] (Graphics Media Accelerator). Unfortunately the open source driver included in Linux kernel 2.6.39 does not support VA-API video or OpenGL/3D acceleration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = An Open-Source Intel GMA 500 Driver Appears | url = http://www.phoronix.com/scan.php?page=news_item&amp;px=OTE0NQ | publisher = Phoronix | accessdate = 2011-06-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
