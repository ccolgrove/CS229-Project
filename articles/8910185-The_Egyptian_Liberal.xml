== Criticism ==
In a August 2011 column on the [[United States debt ceiling crisis|US debt ceiling crisis]], Nocera compared &quot;[[Tea_Party_movement|Tea Party Republicans]]&quot; with [[terrorist]]s, and wrote that they &quot;have waged [[jihad]] on the American people&quot; and suggested that they &quot;can put aside their [[suicide vest]]s&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Nocera, [http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/02/opinion/the-tea-partys-war-on-america.html Tea Partyâs War on America], ''New York Times'', August 1, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This rhetoric was criticized by a number of media outlets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hotair.com/archives/2011/08/02/jay-carney-no-its-not-appropriate-to-compare-republicans-to-terrorists/], [http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/273444/hell-you-people-jonah-goldberg#], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/post/new-york-times-columnist-accuses-tea-party-of-waging-jihad/2011/03/29/gIQA5WrWrI_blog.html], [http://reason.com/blog/2011/08/02/tea-party-terrorists-satan-san]&lt;/ref&gt; In a followup column, Nocera writes &quot;[it] most surprised me is how darned liberal I sound sometimes.&quot;  He then apologized:

:''The words I chose were intemperate and offensive to many, and I've been roundly criticized. I was a hypocrite, the critics said, for using such language when on other occasions I've called for a more civil politics. In the cool light of day, I agree with them. I apologize.''

After comparing congressional negotiations with &quot;[[hand-to-hand combat]]&quot;, Nocera concluded the column with &quot;I won't be calling anybody names. That I can promise.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/06/opinion/the-tea-party-take-two.html The Tea Party, Take Two], ''The New York Times'', August 5, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
