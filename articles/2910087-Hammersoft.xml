'''Hamilton Heights''' is a neighborhood in the [[New York City]] [[borough (New York City)|borough]] of [[Manhattan]].  It lies between [[Manhattanville, Manhattan|Manhattanville]] to the south and [[Washington Heights, Manhattan|Washington Heights]] to the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot;&gt;Kenneth T. Jackson: ''[[The Encyclopedia of New York City]]'': [[New-York Historical Society]]; [[Yale University Press]]; 1995. P. 519-520.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the neighborhood of [[Sugar Hill, Manhattan|Sugar Hill]].

Hamilton Heights is bounded by 135th Street to the south, the [[Hudson River]] to the west, [[155th Street (Manhattan)|155th Street]] to the north, and Edgecombe Avenue to the east.  The community derives its name from Founding Father [[Alexander Hamilton]], who lived the last two years of his life in the area when it was still largely farmland; specifically, he lived in what is now known as [[Hamilton Grange]] National Monument.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot;/&gt; It is located within [[Manhattan Community Board 9]].

== Housing and demographics ==
Most of the housing dates from the extension of the elevated and subway lines at the end of the 19th and the start of the 20th Century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot;/&gt; This fairly elegant housing became less desirable to white residents in the 1930s and 1940s as the population changed from white to black, even though the black residents were just as affluent as the white residents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot;/&gt; There are spacious apartment buildings, [[brownstone]]s and other row houses prominently lining the leafy eastern streets of Hamilton Heights, an area traditionally home to a substantial black professional class. The brownstone revival of the 1960s and 1970s led to a new movement of middle-class blacks in the area. Latinos arrived in large numbers in the 1980s, with Dominicans making up the majority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Citycyclopedia&quot;/&gt; Today the local population is changing again, with [[Hispanic]]s constituting a majority of the population followed by [[African American]]s,  [[West Indies|West Indians]] and remainders of earlier times' ethnic whites. [[Gentrification]] since 2005 has dramatically increased the proportion of non-Hispanic whites. Many actors, artists, teachers, and other professionals now reside in Hamilton Heights.
