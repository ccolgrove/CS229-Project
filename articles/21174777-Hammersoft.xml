The following day, while the house is empty, he steals the valuables including many ornaments. Pearl sees him just as he is escaping, and by chance, David opens his car door which knocks Skin over. The police are called and David and Pearl make statements. When Leyla finds out what happened, she is surprised at what Skin did, but kisses David - who she has a crush on - to thank him.

The police investigate, but Will is later found by [[Jimmy King (Emmerdale)|Jimmy King]] hiding behind a bush in the estate grounds. 

In late August 2009, Will is kicked by a horse and is rushed to hospital where he makes a full recovery. In January 2010, Natasha tells Will that Mark was married to [[Faye Lamb]] and that her son [[Ryan Lamb (Emmerdale)|Ryan]] is his half-brother. Will is traumatized but still believes his father will come back. Will attempts to bond with Ryan but his older brother [[Nathan Wylde|Nathan]] forbids him from doing so.

Natasha had told Will to stay outside and to stop Maisie from torturing Nathan to get him to tell her the truth, Natasha confessed but Will enters the barn and overhears her. She tells Will that she loves him, but Will responds that he does not want her to love him, he wants his father back. After Natasha is arrested he continues to live with Maisie and Nathan at Home Farm until November, when he and Maisie find out that Nathan had framed Ryan. Will is disgusted with Nathan's lies and leaves with Maisie and goes to stay at Holdgate Farm with Maisie's former boyfriend [[Nikhil Sharma]], rejecting Nathan. Maisie and Ryan later order Nathan to stay away from her and Will. Nikhil and Maisie grow close much to Will's discomfort. Nikhil attempts to befriend Will and buys him gifts but Will rejects them. Nikhil later gives Will a letter from Natasha but Will loses his temper and tears it up saying that he never wants to hear from his mother again. Nathan later tries to call Will on his mobile phone and he breaks it in order to stop him. Nikhil then proposes to Maisie and she later accepts, wanting to give Will some stability but Will is angry and loses his temper with Belle when she tries to comfort him. He later speaks to Ryan and suggests that they be a family together and tells him that Maisie would want that but Ryan refuses, due to him and Maisie nearly sleeping together before they discovered that they were siblings.

On 11 January Will sits in the front seat of the Home Farm landrover and when Maisie goes to speak to him he reminisces about their father and asks Maisie why Natasha killed him. Later that evening, Maisie and Nikhil hold their engagement party at Home Farm and Nikhil tries to encourage him but Will loses his temper and shouts at Nikhil and bursts into tears. 

After Maisie tells Nikhil that she does not love him and breaks off their engagement, she decides that she and Will should leave Emmerdale and decide to go and stay with their Aunt in Dartford. Will goes to say goodbye to Belle and gives her a games console as a farewell present. She gives him a kiss on the cheek and he leaves. As they prepare to depart, Ryan comes to say goodbye and tells Will to call him whenever he wants. As Will and Maisie leave in their taxi, Belle runs up and shouts to Will that she loves him and he shouts back that he feels the same way about her. Their taxi drives away, taking Will and Maisie to the railway station.

She announces she is moving back in with Jai and Nikhil and later flirts with [[Cain Dingle]] in The Woolpack, who takes an interest in her return, although maybe for reasons more to do with his jealousy of Jai and Charity.

When [[Zak Dingle|Zak]] and [[Lisa Dingle|Lisa]] eventually discovered her, she was welcomed into the Dingle homestead and Sam got her a job working at the B&amp;B for [[Eric Pollard]]. Recently, however, she seems to have become uncomfortable at Sam's romantic advances. When Wishing Well Cottage was destroyed, she moved in with [[Marlon Dingle|Marlon]], [[Eli Dingle|Eli]] and [[List_of_minor_Emmerdale_characters_(2009)#Lizzie Lakley|Lizzie]]. In early April, Sam proposed to Olena, which she said no to, because she is doesn't have a passport. Later, Sam goes to Cain and asks him to help him get a fake passport for Olena. Zak soon learns about it and tells Olena to leave Sam alone and that when she gets her fake passport he wants her to leave the village. She and Eli soon realise that they have feelings for each other and share a kiss. Sam invites Olena to the Dingles' party celebrating Lisa's release from prison, which she accepts, but doesn't want to. Zak goes round to Tall Trees Cottage and tells her to stay away. When Olena doesn't come, Sam goes to look for her, and spots her and Eli kissing. Sam is heartbroken. Later, the UK Border Control arrive after getting an anonymous tip-off that Terry and Eric are employing people illegally. Terry doesn't know how they are employing people illegally but says Olena is polish, which he believes. Olena admits to Terry that she is [[Ukrainian people|Ukrainian]], not [[Poles|Polish]] and doesn't have any papers. Olena is taken away by the Border Control and Sam later confesses to having reported her.
