In fall 2011, the university had a record-high enrollment of 34,113 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;enrollment&quot; /&gt; 

It is the largest institution in the [[Texas State University System]], the [[List of largest Texas universities by enrollment|sixth-largest]] university in [[Texas]], and one of the fifty-five largest universities in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxStFacts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.umktg.txstate.edu/resources/facts.html |title=Texas State Facts |publisher=Institutional Research, Texas State University |date=January 22, 2009 |accessdate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For the 2009-2010 year, Texas State University was considered a top producer of [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright]] Fellows when two students became beneficiaries of research grants under the [[Fulbright Program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://us.fulbrightonline.org/documents/Chronicles/chronicle_ma_09.pdf  |title=Fulbright Recipients - Universities (Masters) |publisher=Fulbright |accessdate=October 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas State joined three other universities in its category to have all applicants receive fellowships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2009/10/FulbrightHonor102109.html |title=Texas State a &quot;Top Producer&quot; of Fulbright Fellows |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=October 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'s Best Colleges 2011 Texas State ranked 40th among all Regional Universities in the West and tied for 12th among western public Regional Universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/san-marcos-tx/texas-state-university-3615 |title=Best Colleges |publisher=US News and World Report |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/san-marcos-tx/texas-state-university-3615 |title=Texas State University Profile |publisher=US News and World Report |accessdate=August 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Texas State is also the lead school of a multi-institution teaching center offering undergraduate and graduate programs at the [[Round Rock Higher Education Center]] (RRHEC) in the greater north [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxStFacts&quot; /&gt; Additionally, the main campus in San Marcos serves as the location of the fictional school TMU (Texas Methodist University) in the [[NBC]] TV series ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txstatebobcats.com/genrel/040307aaa.html |title=Lights, Camera &amp; Action |publisher=txstatebobcats.com |date=April 7, 2007 |accessdate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the University is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]] (SACS).

Texas State University is the only university in the state to have a former [[President of the United States]] as an alumnus. President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] graduated from what was then Southwest Texas State Teachers College in 1930 with a teaching certificate and a Bachelor of Science in history. In 1965, he returned to Southwest Texas State College, as the school was known then, to sign the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.txstate.edu/news/news_releases/news_archive/2005/08/LBJStatue082605.html |title=Regents agree to statue honoring LBJ at Texas State |publisher=Texas State University |date=August 26, 2005 |accessdate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The bill to establish '''Southwest Texas State Normal School''' in San Marcos was first proposed on March 3, 1899 by Fred Cocke, representing the 98th Texas House District.  Texas State Senator J. B. Dibrell also supported the bill.  There was opposition, but the bill was approved and signed by Governor [[Joseph D. Sayers]] on May 10, 1899.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ecommons.txstate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&amp;context=jamcfacp |title=Fifty Years of Teacher Education: A Brief History of Southwest Texas State Teachers College, San Marcos, Texas, 1901-1951 |publisher= Journalism and Mass Communication, School of |accessdate=April 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, teachers were required to study at Coronal Institute at San Marcos or North Texas Normal School at Denton.  Upon passage of the bill, citizens of San Marcos allocated {{convert|11|acre|m2}} at the site of Chautauqua Hill for the site of the college. [[Old Main (Texas State University)|Old Main]] was not constructed until the twenty seventh legislature rationed out $25,000 for the upbringing of a facility. Once completed, the school opened its doors with an enrollment of 303, a faculty of seventeen, and a principal on September 9, 1903.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/TT/kct56.html |title=TEXAS STATE UNIVERSITYâSAN MARCOS |publisher=Texas State Handbook Online |accessdate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

It took 15&amp;nbsp;years for the school to become a senior college; in response, the name of the school was changed to '''Southwest Texas State Normal College'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt;  A similar name change, '''Southwest Texas State Teachers College''', was observed in 1923 when the college was admitted into the American Association of Teachers Colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt;

President John G. Flowers, in 1950, made a sizable step toward the university's overall goal which included a boost in curriculum and an addition of six new buildings. By this time, campus grounds had grown from {{convert|11|acre|m2}} to sixty five, faculty numbers were at an all-time high of 105, the campus had a 3.5&amp;nbsp;million dollar property value, and the college had an enrollment of 2,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt;
[[Image:HigherEduPlaque.jpg|right|thumb|[[Higher Education Act of 1965|Higher Education Act]] signing plaque rests in front of the College of Music.]]
The school's next name change did not come until 1959 when it was changed to '''Southwest Texas State College''' and later, '''Southwest Texas State University''', in 1969.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt; The next decade brought the school national recognition when Alumnus [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] claimed the presidency and the school's dance team, the Strutters, performed at his inauguration.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt; Johnson returned to Southwest Texas State Teachers College when he signed the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], part of the [[Great Society]]. During his 1965 remarks at [[Strahan Coliseum]], Johnson described living in a compact room atop Dr. Evans' garage and working dozens of jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/Johnson/lbjforkids/edu_whca370-text.shtm |title=Johnson signs legislation into law |publisher= LBJ Library and Museum |accessdate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, [[Westwood High School (Austin, Texas)|Westwood High School]], located in [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]], began hosting a number of the university's graduate night classes in Business Administration and Education.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt; Later, a {{convert|101|acre|km2|adj=on}} gift brought the program from a high school to the late constructed [[Round Rock Higher Education Center]] to occupy increasing popularity and employment.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxHandbook&quot; /&gt; 

The most recent name change took effect in September 2003. Leaders from the university's Associated Student Government (ASG) went to Senator Jeff Wentworth to propose a bill and convince
the [[Texas Legislature]] to change the university's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.senate.state.tx.us/75R/Senate/members/dist25/pr03/p030603a.htm |title=Bill filed today to change Southwest Texas State University's name |date=March 6, 2003 |accessdate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Overall, the five name changes are:&lt;ref name=&quot;TxStFacts&quot; /&gt;
*Southwest Texas State Normal School (1903&amp;ndash;1918)
*Southwest Texas State Normal College (1918&amp;ndash;1923)
*Southwest Texas State Teachers College (1923&amp;ndash;1959)
*Southwest Texas State College (1959&amp;ndash;1969)
*Southwest Texas State University (1969&amp;ndash;2003)
*Texas State UniversityâSan Marcos (2003&amp;mdash;)

==Campus==
[[Image:Elmcreek67.jpg|left|thumb|Campus from 2500&amp;nbsp;feet]]
The campus is located in [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], a community of nearly 50,000 people about halfway between [[Austin, Texas|Austin]] and [[San Antonio]] on [[Interstate 35 in Texas|Interstate 35]]. Its location on the banks of the [[San Marcos River]] provides students with recreational and leisure activities, such as [[human swimming|swimming]] and [[Tubing (recreation)|tubing]], throughout the year. Texas State's campus today consists of a {{convert|457|acre|km2|sing=on}} main campus and {{convert|4777|acre|km2}} more in recreational, instructional, farm and ranch land.&lt;ref name=&quot;TxStFacts&quot; /&gt;

The university operates [[Sewell Park]] which is on the banks of the spring fed [[San Marcos River]]. The banks, part of land leased by the [[U.S. Bureau of Fisheries]], were built up from the river bottom by university workers. Initially named Riverside Park, it was later renamed to Sewell Park in 1946 in honor of Dr. S.M. &quot;Froggy&quot; Sewell, a mathematics professor who helped form the park.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txstate.edu/about/history-traditions/sewell-park.html |title=Sewell Park |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=April 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bagels]], and Freshens Smoothie Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dineoncampus.com/txstate/?cmd=menus |title=Chartwells Service |publisher=Chartwells |accessdate=September 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Texas State formed an agreement with [[Wells Fargo]] to allow students to pair university identification cards with their checking accounts. While this option is not required, it is made convenient through several [[Wells Fargo]] locations on and near campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.auxiliaryservices.txstate.edu/idservices/bobcatcard.html |title=Bobcat Card |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=September 26, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Old Main===

===Mascot and Logo===
In 1920, Texas State adopted its first official mascot, the Bobcat, at the urging of Oscar Strahan, who became the school's athletic director in 1919. Strahan suggested the Bobcat because the cat is native to central Texas and is known for its fierceness. The Bobcat didn't get a name until 1964. At that time, Beth Greenless won the &quot;Name the Bobcat&quot; contest with the name Boko the Bobcat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.athletics.txstate.edu/spirit/history.htm |title=Boko's History |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2003, the Bobcat logo was designed by a Texas State student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pride-traditions.ua.txstate.edu/campus-traditions/logo.html |title=Bobcat Logo |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009, Texas State administrators refined its athletic mark by changing the font and placement of the SuperCat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txstatebobcats.com/genrel/081209aac.html |title=Texas State Refines Athletics Mark |date=August 12, 2009 |publisher=TxStateBobcats.com |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rivalries===

With the intentions to increase fans and numbers at games, Texas State University formed rivalries with various schools including The [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] and [[Nicholls State University]]. Texas State and The [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] originally started this rivalry competing in basketball with hopes of bringing attention to central Texas sports along the I-35 corridor. In the 2007-2008 season, the series was expanded to an &quot;all sport competition.&quot;  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pride-traditions.ua.txstate.edu/campus-traditions/i-35-rivalry.html |title=I-35 Maroon vs Orange Rivalry Series |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bobcat Stadium West Side.jpg|thumb|right|Fields West Side Complex at Bobcat Stadium completed in 2009]]
Annually, Bobcats and the Colonels face off in the Battle for the Paddle Rivalry game. While preparing for a football game against the [[Nicholls State University]] Colonels, a flood struck San Marcos soaking the Bobcat Stadium field. Together, Athletic Directors and coaches chose to continue the game, thus, the name &quot;Battle for the Paddle&quot; was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pride-traditions.ua.txstate.edu/campus-traditions/battle-for-the-paddle.html |title=Battle for the Paddle |publisher=Texas State University |accessdate=September 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transition to FBS===

With the continuing support for Texas State Athletics, there was an effort to promote the football team to Division I-FBS competition, the [[Football Bowl Subdivision#Football Bowl Subdivision|Football Bowl Subdivision]]. A student referendum was proposed on November 2007 and approved by the student body on April 2008. That referendum starting a move, dubbed âThe Drive to FBS,â and has led to the renovation of athletic facilities, including construction of new baseball and softball stadiums and expansion of [[Bobcat Stadium (Texas State)|Bobcat Stadium]]. Texas State's first 2009 season football game against [[Angelo State University]] opened '''The Jerry D. and Linda Gregg Fields Bobcat Stadium West Side Complex''' encompassing Club and Luxury level seating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.txstatebobcats.com/facilities/bobcat-stadium-west-side-complex.html |title=Jerry D. and Linda Gregg Fields Bobcat Stadium West Side Complex |publisher=TexasStateBobcats.com |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Athletics Director Larry Teis stated the next phase in renovating Bobcat Stadium cannot begin until the stadium's track is relocated, the university broke ground on a new Track and Field Complex with land purchased by the university behind [[Bobcat Stadium (Texas State)|Bobcat Stadium]]. Completion of the Track and Field Complex is expected Summer 2011. In May 2011, Texas State began construction connecting the east and west sides at [[Bobcat Stadium (Texas State)|Bobcat Stadium]]. Completion is expected in time for Texas Stateâs first home 2012 football game against [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]].  Recent athletic fee raises are helping fund the renovations. On November 11, 2010, it was announced that Texas State would be joining the [[University of Denver]] and the [[University of Texas at San Antonio]] in the [[Western Athletic Conference]] (WAC) beginning July 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncaa/news/story?id=5789078 |title=Sources: Denver University, Texas-San Antonio and Texas State to join WAC |publisher=ESPN |first=Andy |last=Katz |date=November 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
