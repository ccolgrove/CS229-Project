'''Billy Childish''' (born '''Steven John Hamper''', 1 December 1959) is an English artist, painter, author, poet, photographer, film maker, singer and guitarist. He is known for his explicit and prolific work â he has detailed his love life and childhood sexual abuse, notably in his early poetry and the novels ''My Fault'' (1996), ''Notebooks of a Naked Youth'' (1997), ''Sex Crimes of the Futcher'' (2004) â ''The Idiocy of Idears'' (2007), and in several of his songs, notably  in the instrumental &quot;Paedophile&quot; (1992) (featuring a photograph of the man who sexually abused him on the front cover) and &quot;Every Bit of Me&quot; (1993). From 1981 till 1985 Childish had a relationship with artist [[Tracey Emin]] and has also been associated with another British artist [[Stella Vine]].

He is a consistent advocate for amateurism and free emotional expression and was a co-founder of the [[Stuckism]] [[art movement]] with [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] in 1999, which he left in 2001. Since then a new evaluation of Childish's standing in the art world has been under way, culminating with the publication of a critical study of Childish's working practice by the artist and writer Neal Brown, with an introduction by [[Peter Doig]], which describes Childish as &quot;one of the most outstanding, and often misunderstood, figures on the British art scene&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;''Billy Childish a Short Study'' by Neal Brown published by The Aquarium, ISBN 1871894233&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==

[[File:Childish,-The-Drinker-600.jpg|thumb|left|120px|Billy Childish. ''The Drinker'', oil painting, 1996.]]

Billy Childish was born, lives and works in [[Chatham, Kent]], England. Although he had an early and extremely close association with many of the artists who became known as &quot;[[YBA]]&quot; artists he has resolutely asserted his independent status.  He was [[child sexual abuse|sexually abused]] when he was aged nine by a male family friend: &quot;We were on holiday. I had to share a bed with him. It happened for several nights, then I refused to go near him. I didn't tell anyone.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,22876-2475809.html | work=The Times | location=London | title=The importance of being Childish  | date=2 December 2006 | accessdate=26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left secondary school at 16, an undiagnosed [[dyslexia|dyslexic]]. Refused an interview at the local art college, he entered [[Chatham Dockyard]], Kent, as an apprentice stonemason. During the next six months (the artistâs only prolonged period of conventional employment), he produced some 600 drawings in &quot;the tea huts of hell&quot;. On the basis of this work he was accepted into [[Central Saint Martins College of Art and Design|St Martinâs School of Art]], where he was friends with the artist [[Peter Doig]], to study painting. However, his acceptance was short-lived and  he was expelled in 1982 before completing the course. He then lived on [[the dole]] for 15 years. In 2006 Childish turned down the offer to appear on Channel 4's [[Celebrity Big Brother UK]]. Childish has practised [[yoga]] and [[meditation]] since the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;''http://www.3ammagazine.com/litarchives/2002_feb/interview_billy_childish.html''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting==
[[Image:Robert Walsa by Childish 08.jpg|thumb|120px|left|[[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]] ''Dead in the Snow''. Billy Childish 2008]]

As a prospective student lacking the necessary entry qualifications, Childish was accepted into art school four times on the strength of his paintings and drawings. Childish studied foundation at Medway College of Design in 1977-78, and was then accepted onto the painting department of [[St Martins School of Art]] in 1978, before quitting a month later. He was reaccepted at St Martins in 1980, but was expelled in 1982 for refusing to paint in the art school and other unruly behaviour. At St Martins, Childish became friends with [[Peter Doig]] with whom he shared an appreciation of [[Edvard Munch|Munch]], [[Van Gogh]] and blues music. Doig later co-curated Childish's first London show at the Cubit Street Gallery. In the early/mid 1980s Childish was a &quot;major influence&quot; on the artist [[Tracey Emin]], who he met after his expulsion from St Martins when she was a fashion student at Medway College of Design. Childish has been cited as the influence for Emin's later confessional art. Childish paints in a personal style, which parallels his passion for the elemental in both writing and music.  He has exhibited extensively since the 1980s and was featured in the [[British Art Show]] in 2000. Since 2002 Childish has been represented in London by the L-13 Gallery, along with [[Jamie Reid]] and [[James Cauty]] (with whom sometimes collaborates). In 1996 Childish painted &quot;The Drinker&quot;, influenced by [[Hans Fallada]]'s [[The Drinker|novel of the same title]]. Childish has cited Fallada as a major influence on his own prose work, notably in the novel &quot;Sex Crimes of the Futcher&quot;. In 2008 Childish commenced a series of paintings based on the life and death of the Swiss author [[Robert Walser (writer)|Robert Walser]], whom Childish has also cited as an influence on his prose work.
In 2008 Childish made several paintings of the steam paddle tug ''[[John H Amos]]'' which was moored on a pontoon at Rochester. In 2010 a major exhibition of Childish's recent paintings, writing and music was held at The ICA London, with a concurrent painting show running at White Columns Gallery in NY. Childish is represented by neugerriemschneider Berlin, and Lehmann Maupin, NY.

==The British Art Resistance==
In 2008 Childish formed the &quot;non organisation&quot; The British Art Resistance, and held an exhibition under the title Hero of The British Art Resistance at The Aquarium L-13 gallery in London: A collection of paintings, books, records, pamphlets, poems, prints, letters, film, photographs made in 2008.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Music==
[[File:BillyChildish.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Childish at the Shinjuku loft, Japan (early 1990s) Photo: Masao Nakagami]]  
Childish made records of punk rock, blues, folk, classical/experimental, spoken word and nursery rhymes.  In a letter to Childish, the musician [[Ivor Cutler]] said of Childish: &quot;You are perhaps too subtle and sophisticated for the mass market.&quot; Childish's groups include TV21, later known as the Pop Rivets (1977â1980), sometimes spelled the Pop Rivits, with [[Bruce Brand]], [[Romas Foord]], [[Russell Wilkins]] and [[Russell Lax]]. He later formed Thee Milkshakes (1980â1984) with [[Micky Hampshire]], [[Thee Mighty Caesars]] (1985â1989), [[The Del Monas]] then [[Thee Headcoats]] (1989â1999). In 2000 he formed Wild Billy Childish &amp; The Friends of the Buff Medways Fanciers Association (2000â2006), named after a type of poultry bred in his home town. The Buffs, as they were sometimes affectionately known, split in 2006, and Wild Billy Childish &amp; the Musicians of the British Empire were born, recording a song about one of Billy's heroes [[George Mallory]] titled &quot;Bottomless Pit.&quot; In early 2007, Billy formed [[The Vermin Poets]] with former [[Fire Dept]] singer and guitarist [[Neil Palmer]] and A-Lines guitarist and singer [[Julie Hamper]], his wife. Thee Headcoats began their monthly residency at the Wild Western Room in the St John's Tavern, north London, in the early 1990s, and continued after moving to the Dirty Water Club in 1996. The Musicians of the British Empire (MBEs) played at the venue more or less once a month until feb 2011. Childish has not played live since then.

Childish has been [[Name-dropping#In_music|namechecked]] by a number of famous musicians including [[Kurt Cobain]], [[Graham Coxon]], [[The White Stripes]] ([[Jack White (musician)|Jack White]] had Billy's name written in large letters on his arm for an early ''[[Top of the Pops]]'' appearance) and [[Kylie Minogue]] who named the LP ''[[Impossible Princess]]'' after his book {{sic|''Poems to Break the Harts of Impossible Princesses''}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Frances | last = Whiting | authorlink = Frances Whiting | title = Princess Kylie on the Move | work = [[The Sunday Mail (Brisbane)]] | publisher = Queensland Newspapers | location = Australia | date = 26 April 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 11, 2009, Damaged Goods Records â Childish's current label â issued a message to subscribers stating that Childish's wife Julie (aka Nurse Julie, bassist in the MBEs) was pregnant.  Childish has since been recording as bass player with The Spartan Dreggs, with Neil Palmer on vocals and guitar and wolf Howard on drums.

==Poetry==

[[Image:MedwayPoets.jpg|thumb|left|[[Sexton Ming]], [[Tracey Emin]], [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], Billy Childish and musician Russell Wilkins at the Rochester Adult Education Centre 11 December 1987 to record [[The Medway Poets]] LP]]

Childish is  a confessional poet and has published over 40 collections of his work. In 1979, Childish was a founder member of [[The Medway Poets]], a poetry performance group, who read at the Kent Literature Festival and the 1981 international [[Cambridge Poetry Festival]]. There were, however, personality clashes in the group, particularly between Childish and [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]], who said: &quot;There was friction between us, especially when he started heckling my poetry reading and I threatened to ban him from a forthcoming TV documentary.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.3ammagazine.com/artarchives/2002_dec/interview_charles_thomson.html Interview with Charles Thomson on 3ammagazine.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, a TV South documentary on the group in 1982 brought them to a wider regional audience, though Childish's poetry was &quot;deemed unbroadcastable&quot;.
According to Childish: &quot;Me &amp; Charles were at war from 1979 until 1999. He even threatened having bouncers on the doors of Medway Poets' readings to keep me out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trakmarx.com/2004_02/10_billy.htm &quot;Billy Childish on Stuckism&quot;, trakmarx.com] Accessed 9 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Childish has twice won commendations in the National Poetry Prize.

==Hangman Books==

In 1981-82 Childish formed Hangman Books, publishing poetry and some fiction. (Associated projects are Hangman Films and Hangman Records.)
Hangman Books has published poetry books and pamphlets by Billy Childish, [[Tracey Emin]], [[Bill Lewis]], Vic Templer, Joe Corkwell, [[Sexton Ming]], [[Philip Absolon]], Chris Broderick, Mark Lowe, Neil Sparks, [[Louis-Ferdinand Celine]], Dan Melchior, Dan Belton, Alfie Howard, Simon Robson, Steve Prince, Joe Machine, [[Wolf Howard]] and Amanda Collier, among others.
1982â87 the daily running of the press was carried out by Traci Emin (later Tracey Emin). 1988â99 it was managed by Kyra De Coninck (one of Thee Headcoatees band). Since 2000 Julie Hamper, Childish's wife, has been overseeing it. From 1986 Hangman Records, also run by Childish, released more than 50 LP records, including spoken word, experimental works and punk rock. Many local Medway groups and artists had their first releases on Hangman.
Hangman Books and Hangman Records are both independent, non-profit-making and do not receive outside funding.

==Tracey Emin==
{{main | Tracey Emin}}
During the 1980s, Childish was an influence on the artist [[Tracey Emin]], whom he met in 1982, after his expulsion from the painting department at [[St Martin's School of Art]]. Emin was a fashion student at [[Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design|Medway College of Design]]. Emin and Childish were a couple until 1986-87, Emin selling his poetry books for his small press [[Hangman Books]]. In 1995 she was interviewed in the ''Minky Manky'' show catalogue by [[Carl Freedman]], who asked her, &quot;Which person do you think has had the greatest influence on your life?&quot; She replied:
:Uhmm... It's not a person really. It was more a time, going to Maidstone College of Art, hanging around with Billy Childish, living by the River Medway.

Her famous &quot;tent&quot; ''[[Everyone I Have Ever Slept With 1963â1995]]'' (1995) was first exhibited in the show, and Childish's name was displayed prominently in it. The tent was destroyed in a fire at the [[Momart]] warehouse, in Leyton, east London, in 2004.

Childish has said &quot;My relationship with Tracey Emin finished in 1987 â 21 years ago, to be exact. Whilst I like and respect Tracey, and wish her well, the relationship is not significant in respect of my current life, and therefore I choose not to discuss it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AQUARIUM L-13 Artist profile&quot;&gt;[http://www.theaquariumonline.co.uk/acatalog/copy_of_Billy_Childish_profile.html THE AQUARIUM L-13 Artist profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Stuckists==

{{main|Stuckism}}

[[Image:2000 Real Turner Prize Show.jpg|thumb|Billy Childish (far right) with the first Stuckists group at the Real Turner Prize Show, Pure Gallery, Shoreditch, London, in October 2000]]

In 1999 Childish and Thomson co-founded the [[stuckism|Stuckist]] [[art movement]]. Thomson coined the group name from Childish's ''Poem for a Pissed Off Wife'' (''Big Hart and Balls'' 1994), where he had recorded Emin's remark to him:
:Your paintings are stuck, you are stuck! â Stuck! Stuck! Stuck!&quot;
The group was strongly pro-figurative painting and anti-conceptual art. Childish wrote a number of manifestos with Thomson, the first of which contained the statement:
:Artists who don't paint aren't artists.
The Stuckists soon achieved considerable press coverage, fuelled by Emin's nomination for the [[Turner Prize]]. They then announced the inauguration of a cultural period of [[Remodernism]] to bring back spiritual values into art, culture and society. The formation of The Stuckists directly led to Emin severing her 14-year friendship with Childish in 1999.

Childish has said: &quot;The Stuckist art group was formed in 1999 at the instigation of Charles Thomson, the title of the group being taken from a poem of mine written and published in 1994. I disagreed with the way Charles presented the group, particularly in the media. For these reasons I left the Stuckists in 2001.  I never attended any Stuckist demonstrations and my work was not shown in the large Stuckist exhibition held in the Walker Art Gallery in 2004.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AQUARIUM L-13 Artist profile&quot;/&gt;

British artist [[Stella Vine]], who was a member of the Stuckists for a short time in 2001, first joined the group having developed a &quot;crush&quot; on Billy Childish while attending his music events.&lt;ref name=waldemar&gt;Januszczak, Waldemar.

Retrieved 12 December 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2000, Vine went to a talk given by Childish and fellow Stuckist co-founder [[Charles Thomson (artist)|Charles Thomson]] on Stuckism and [[Remodernism]], promoted by the [[Institute of Ideas]] at the Salon des Arts, Kensington.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;[http://www.stuckism.com/StellaVine/Salon.html &quot;Stella Vine the Stuckist in photos&quot;], [[Stuckism]].

==Conceptual art==

As a young man, Childish was highly influenced by Dada, and the work of [[Kurt Schwitters]] in particular. Childish has a Kurt Schwitters poem tatooed on his left buttock and made a short film on Schwitters's life, titled The Man with Wheels, (1980, directed by Eugean Doyan).&lt;ref&gt;Billy Childish a Short Study&quot; by Neal Brown published by The Aquarium ISBN 1871894233&lt;/ref&gt; In his poetry, Childish mentions that he once had a bank account under the name of Kurt Schwitters.
As to what is now termed conceptual art, Childish has said &quot;I respect the right of detractors and champions alike as we live in a democracy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;THE AQUARIUM L-13 Artist profile&quot;/&gt;

==The Chatham Super 8 Cinema==

In 2002, along with [[Wolf Howard]], Simon Williams and Julie Hamper, Childish formed The Chatham Super 8 Cinema. The group makes super 8 films on a second hand camera Wolf Howard bought at a local flea market. In 2004 Childish released a 30-minute documentary titled ''Brass Monkey'',  about a march undertaken in Great War uniform commemorating the 90th anniversary of the British retreat from Mons in 1914.
