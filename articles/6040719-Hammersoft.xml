'''Markos Rainer Rauffmann''' (born 26 February 1967) is a retired [[Germany|German]]-born [[Cyprus|Cypriot]] [[Association football|footballer]], who played as a [[Forward (association football)|striker]].

After having played mainly for modest clubs in his country, he revived his career in Cyprus, where he played with success for [[AC Omonia]], eventually representing the [[Cyprus national football team|Cypriot national team]], despite having already reached his 30's.

==Club career==
===Germany===
Born in [[Kleve]], [[North-Rhine Westphalia]], Rauffmann moved at the age of 16 to [[FC Amberg]], a local team playing in the [[Oberliga (football)|German third division]], but only managed to stay a season there, before moving to the seventh level. After five seasons in the amateur leagues, he returned to the club, now as a semi-professional.

In 1991, Rauffmann signed for [[SpVgg Blau-WeiÃ 1890 Berlin]], which at the time was playing in the [[2. FuÃball-Bundesliga|second division]], but spent most of his first professional spell as a [[Defender (association football)#Full back|right back]], still managing to score on six occasions, although the club eventually [[1991â92 2. FuÃball-Bundesliga|suffered relegation]].

For the next three seasons he continued to play in that category, now for [[SV Meppen]], where he made the transition to forward. In [[1995 in association football|1995]] Rauffmann made the biggest move of his career when he signed for [[Eintracht Frankfurt]] in the [[FuÃball-Bundesliga|top level]]. His competition debut came on August 12, in [[1995â96 FuÃball-Bundesliga|the season]]'s opener against [[Karlsruher SC]], and he netted in a 2â2 home draw; during the course of the campaign, he was fairly used, but again dropped down a level. 

In the ensuing summer, Rauffmann signed with [[Arminia Bielefeld]], but only lasted a few months, finishing the season on loan to [[Austria]]'s [[LASK Linz]].

===Cyprus===
In the summer of 1997, at age 30, Rauffmann moved to [[AC Omonia]] in [[Nicosia]], which had been unsuccessful in winning a [[Cypriot First Division]] title for four years. He made an immediate impact in his new team, scoring two goals on his debut. Reborn as a player, he bagged 42 league goals in [[1997â98 Cypriot First Division|his debut season]] (47 in total), a record in European domestic leagues in the year, but failed to win the [[European Golden Shoe]] because of the punctuation system of the trophy. 

Rauffmann forged a strong offensive partnership with the team's [[Captain (association football)|captain]] [[Costas Malekkos]]. However, a [[penalty kick]] miss in the 25th game of the season, against [[Anorthosis Famagusta FC]], eventually cost the team the title, lost to precisely that opponent.

The following year, he again had a great individual [[1998â99 Cypriot First Division|season]], but his 42 goals (35 in league) weren't enough to win Omonia any title, the league again being lost to Anorthosis, now on [[goal difference]]; his first club accolade arrived in 2000, with the conquest of the [[Cypriot Cup|domestic cup]], 4â2 against [[APOEL F.C.|APOEL FC]].

In the [[2000â01 Cypriot First Division|2000â01 season]], Rauffmann, now captain after Malekkos' departure, led Omonia to its first league title in eight years, in spite of a poor start, netting 30 league goals - the league was won in the last day of the season; in the following campaign, the player, who had won four consecutive topscorer trophies, had his worst scoring record of his six-year spell with the club, netting 16 times.

Rauffmann won his second championship with Omonia in [[2002â03 Cypriot First Division|2002â03]], at the age of 36, scoring a total of 41 goals in 40 official matches, and also reaching the [[Cyprus national football team|Cyprus national team]], playing five matches in one year. However, at the beginning of the following season, he injured his [[knee]] at [[Makario Stadium]] against [[Doxa Katokopia]], and retired before the end of 2003, with a total of 286 goals in 378 official matches for Omonia.

After the end of his playing career, Rauffmann had a brief spell as manager at [[Olympiakos Nicosia]] without much success. He returned to Omonia shortly after, working mainly with the club's scouting staff.
