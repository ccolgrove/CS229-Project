'''VueScan''' is an [[image scanning]] and [[optical character recognition]] computer program developed by Ed Hamrick since 1998.&lt;ref name=&quot;cnet&quot;&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It enables the user to tweak and fine-tune the scanning parameters. The program uses its own independent method to interface with scanner hardware. Therefore it is able to use an old scanner without a device driver on new x64 systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

VueScan is sold as one downloadable file with two different licenses (Standard and Professional). The license code determines which version is running. Without license the program runs in demo mode. The demo mode is identical to the professional license except that dollar-sign watermarks are superimposed on both saved and printed images.

By default VueScan only supports performing optical character recognition of English documents. However, 32 additional language packages are available for download from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adding OCR Languages|url=http://www.hamrick.com/ocr.html|work=VueScan|publisher=Hamrick Software|accessdate=26 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of September 2011 Ed Hamrick was &quot;selling $3M per year of VueScan licenses&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.snowhenge.net/pblog/article/Why_is_Vuescan_struggling|title = Why is Vuescan struggling ?|accessdate = 2011-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
