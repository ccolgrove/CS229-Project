'''''The Ant Bully''''' is a 2006 American [[computer-animated]] [[film]] written and directed by [[John A. Davis]] based on the 1999 [[The Ant Bully|children's book of the same name]] by [[John Nickle]]. The film features the voices of [[Zach Tyler Eisen]], [[Nicolas Cage]], [[Julia Roberts]], [[Meryl Streep]], [[Paul Giamatti]], [[Regina King]], [[Bruce Campbell]] and [[Ricardo MontalbÃ¡n]] (in his final film role), was produced by [[Tom Hanks]] and [[Gary Goetzman]]'s [[Playtone]], John A. Davis and [[Keith Alcorn]]'s [[DNA Productions]], [[Nicolas Cage]]'s [[Saturn Films]] and released in movie theatres on August 4, 2006 by [[Warner Bros.]] and [[Legendary Pictures]]. Concurrently with the general release, the film was offered in big screen [[IMAX]] 3D, the format also used with ''[[The Polar Express (film)|The Polar Express]]''. This is also the first animated film produced by [[Legendary Pictures]].

==Plot==
The film begins with a lonely 10-year-old named Lucas Nickle ([[Zach Tyler Eisen]]) being tormented by a bully and his gang. In turn, Lucas attacks an [[anthill]] with a squirt gun. This terrifies the [[ant]]s. One ant, an eccentric [[Wizard (fantasy)|wizard]] named Zoc ([[Nicolas Cage]]), tries to fight back. His girlfriend, a nurse ant named Hova ([[Julia Roberts]]), attempts to communicate with Lucas. She is almost crushed but is rescued by Zoc. The leaders of the colony decide to use a [[potion]] to shrink Lucas down to ant size. Lucas' parents, who fail to understand his problems, go to [[Puerto Vallarta]], leaving him with his older sister and his Grandmother, who obsesses over [[extraterrestrial life|aliens]]. 
 
Meanwhile, the local [[pest control|exterminator]], Stan Beals ([[Paul Giamatti]]), convinces Lucas to sign a contract to kill vermin. Later, Zoc and a small troop of ants pour the potion into his ear. Lucas wakes up and discovers that he is now tiny. He is carried to the anthill into a world of giant caves, [[caterpillar]]s and ants. Zoc insists that Lucas should be studied then eaten, but he is overruled by the Queen ([[Meryl Streep]]). She sentences Lucas to [[penal labour|hard labor]]. Hova volunteers to train Lucas, much to Zoc's mortification. Hova and Lucas both learn about the differences between ants and humans. But when she forces him to forage for [[jelly bean]]s with Kreela ([[Regina King]]) and her husband, Fugax ([[Bruce Campbell]]) Lucas is unsuccessful. The ants are attacked by [[wasps]]. Lucas finds a discarded firecracker and uses it to destroy the attacker wasp and scare the other wasps away. This earns him the admiration of all the ants â except Zoc.

Lucas is introduced to honeydew, the feces of caterpillars. He is shown a painting which depicts the Great Ant Mother and the evil &quot;Cloud-Breather&quot;, an exterminator. Lucas is told that the Great Ant Mother will return and shower the ants with honeydew, while the Cloud-breather will spell destruction for all of them. He and his friends go back the house, where he tries to call the exterminator to cancel the contract but dials a pizza restaurant instead. Then Lucas' sister comes home and they are forced into hiding until dark. When Zoc finds out that Lucas put Hova in possible danger, he accuses Lucas of further treachery and tells him that he should find another wizard because there is no way that he will give Lucas the potion to turn him back again. Lucas runs away, frightened, and Hova becomes angry with Zoc. But when Lucas is eaten by a [[frog]], Zoc frees him, starting to like him and realizing he was not so bad after all. Afterwards Zoc and Lucas discuss their differences. Zoc explains that ants work for the benefit of the colony. Lucas states that most humans work for personal gain. Zoc is confused as to how anything gets accomplished in Lucas' world.

The next morning, Lucas finds the Ant Mother approaching. He discovers that the 'Ant Mother' is actually a giant balloon strapped to Stan Beals' van used as a symbol for pest control. The ants enlist the aid of the [[wasp]]s; at first, the wasps want to eat Lucas, but hearing that their nest is destroyed by Beals, they agree to help. During the battle with the exterminator, Lucas saves the lives of Hova and an injured wasp. Both the ants and wasps were no match against [[pesticide]], but as he is about to exterminate the ant hill, a [[beetle]] and [[glowworm]] manage to bite Beals in his private area. Lucas injects him with a shrinking potion. He runs away using a tricycle. The queen then pronounces Lucas an ant in honor of his heroic actions. Zoc gives him the antidote. Lucas grows back to normal size and finally stands up to the bully who runs away. Lucas then showers the colony with jelly beans as a farewell gift.

==Production==
Hanks originally conceived the idea for an animated film adaptation after reading the book with his child. He then sent a copy of the book to Davis because of Davis' work on the computer-animated film ''[[Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Comingsoon.net, [http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15686], Hanks and Davis on the Ant Bully, July 27, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Davis came up with a potential take on the story within a few days. &quot;To be honest, when I first looked at it, I thought Oh, why does it have to be ants again?&quot; said Davis. &quot;But the more I thought about it, I said, So what? It's got as much to do with ''The Incredible Shrinking Man'' as it does the other bug movies. It's a completely different story.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jenny Donelan, Computer Graphics World, September 2002, Volume 29 Number 9, pages 24&amp;ndash;26&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Hanks agreed that the story could be expanded considerably (the original book being around only 2,000 words). Alcorn had a similar initial reaction to the project as Davis did. &quot;My first thought,â recalled Alcorn, âwas, ânot another ant movie.â But looking at the actual story, this was really about a little boy and how he learns about the world by having to live beneath the surface.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Cawley, Animation World Magazine, [http://mag.awn.com/index.php?article_no=2956], July 28, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Davis states that he felt like a something of a hypocrite when, while he was working on the script, carpenter ants infested his house and he called an exterminator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movingpicturesmagazine.com/features/themedarticle/johnadavis_antbully |title=John A. Davis: Ant Bullyâs Architect |accessdate=2008-11-24 |last=Kotek |first=Elliot V. |coauthors= |date=2006 |work= |publisher=Moving Pictures Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was rendered on DNA Productions' 1400-[[CPU]] [[render farm]], managed by the [[open source]] [[Sun Grid Engine]] [[job scheduler]]. The nodes started out with [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]] 2 [[Linux]] with a modern 2.6.x kernel, but the new [[AMD]] [[Opteron]] nodes are running Fedora Core 4. Most of the applications are commercial, including [[Maya (software)|Maya]], [[Houdini (software)|Houdini]], [[Massive (software)|Massive]] and the Pixar [[RenderMan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gridengine.info/pages/profile-DNA-Productions &quot;Making movies with Grid Engine&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with the theatrical release of ''The Ant Bully'', there was an IMAX 3D version presented in only some of the IMAX theaters. The others continued to run the 3D version of ''[[Superman Returns]]''. The special IMAX 3D version was remastered in 3D with IMAX DMR. Critics within the 3D motion picture community have given the film high marks, as unlike ''Superman Returns'', the entire film is projected in 3D stereo. The process to turn a pure animation film into 3D is much simpler than converting a film having live actors.

Some of the production took place at [[C.O.R.E. Digital Pictures]] in [[Canada]].

==Reception==
The film received mostly positive reviews and garnered a 63% positive rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. Tom Long of the Detroit News wrote that &quot;there's a sweet simplicity and humility to this film.&quot; Ruthe Stein of ''[[The San Francisco Chronicle]]'' wrote that &quot;the brilliance of ''The Ant Bully'' is in the crafty way it delves into the minds of ants as they plot to save themselves from extermination... Davis creates a marvelously labyrinthine society for them, right below the surface of a bland suburb.&quot; Lisa Schwarzbaum of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' liked Roberts and Cage in their roles, and referred to Streep's queen ant as &quot;excellently magisterial.&quot; She also wrote that &quot;the kind of life lessons that usually gum up the fun go down as easily as jelly beans in ''The Ant Bully''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Entertainment Weekly, July 26, 2006, [http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1219235,00.html]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jeffrey E. McCants of the [[Star Tribune|Minneapolis ''Star Tribune'']] wrote that &quot;the film's heavy-handed lessons turn it from a fun romp through a cartoonish insect world to a predictable and preachy snoozefest&quot;.  Lou Lumenick of the ''[[New York Post]]'' called the film &quot;generic&quot; and wrote that &quot;adults will be less than enchanted by its preachiness, talkiness and [[Communist]] Party-line political views&quot;. Bill Muller of ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' wrote that &quot;''The Ant Bully'', in trying to match ''[[Antz]]'' or ''[[A Bug's Life]]'', just digs itself into a big hole&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Azcentral.com, [http://www.azcentral.com/ent/movies/articles/0728antbully0728.html], accessed March 25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Jack Mathews of the New York ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]'' was positive about the film's lack of pop culture references and thought that the film does not &quot;talk down&quot; to children. Additionally, he noted that &quot;adults may be amused (or maybe not) by the [[Christian]] parallel in the ants' religion.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Rotten Tomatoes, Top Critic Reviews, [http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/ant_bully/?critic=creamcrop#mo], accessed March 25, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Box office===
''The Ant Bully'' closed on November 16, 2006, with $28 million in North America and a total of $55 million worldwide. The estimated production budget was $50 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://movies.yahoo.com/mv/boxoffice/weekend/2006/08/06 &quot;Weekend Box Office Actuals (U.S.) Aug 4 - 6 weekend&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that studios receive just over half of the final gross, this is viewed as a box office disappointment, for ''[[Monster House (film)|Monster House]]'' and ''[[Barnyard (film)|Barnyard]]'' both sold far more. The 3D version did considerably better per screen in its few playdates, though this is due partially to the higher admission prices of IMAX theaters.

==Soundtrack==
The soundtrack's music score was composed and conducted by [[John Debney]] and there are no songs in this film. The entire movie score was released by [[VarÃ¨se Sarabande]].

==Video game==
{{main|The Ant Bully (video game)}}
Games publisher [[Midway Games|Midway]] released ''The Ant Bully'', the official video game tie-in to the film on [[Nintendo GameCube|GameCube]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[IBM-PC|PC]], Wii and [[Game Boy Advance]] on July 24, 2006. The game was developed by the Montreal Studio [[Artificial Mind and Movement]] (A2M).
