'''Escuela de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de La Salette''', also known as ''La Salette La Salle'', is a private educational institution located in [[Dagupan City]], [[Philippines]].

==History==
The school was founded on March 26, 1989 by Dr. Lina Galvan-Tan and was named after the [[Our Lady of La Salette|Virgin Mary of La Sallete]] in [[France]]. The school's name is the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] translation of '''School of Our Lady of La Salette'''. It started as a kindergarten school and expanded its course offerings by opening the Grade School, High School, and the College level.

In November 2000, Escuela de Nuestra SeÃ±ora de La Salette became a De La Salle Assistancy School through the Lasallian Schools Supervision Services Association, Inc. (LASSAI).
