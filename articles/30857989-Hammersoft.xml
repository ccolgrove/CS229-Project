'''George Joseph O'Leary''' (born August 17, 1946) is the head [[American football|football]] coach of the [[UCF Knights football]] team that represents the [[University of Central Florida]] located in [[Orlando, Florida]]; he previously coached the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football]] team from 1994 to 2001, and served as an assistant coach for the [[Minnesota Vikings]] from 2002 to 2004. O'Leary is widely known for his success with the [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets]], his brief tenure as head coach for the [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish]], and for coaching the [[UCF Knights]] to the fourth-best turnaround in NCAA history in his second year with the team.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.ucf.edu/UCFnews/index?page=article&amp;id=00240041070ca5e3e010b382c8adf007ac7 UCF Football Coach OÂLeary Signs 10-Year Contract Extension]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal==
George O'Leary was born on August 17, 1946 in [[Central Islip, New York]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsinfo.nd.edu/news/6314-george-oleary-appointed-new-head-football-coach/ |title=George O'Leary appointed new head football coach |publisher=University of Notre Dame |date=2002-12-18 |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; O'Leary is married to Sharon O'Leary and they have four children; two daughters, Chris and Trish, and two sons, Tim and Marty. Marty was a senior [[free safety]] on the 2001 Georgia Tech team that his father coached.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ramblinwreck.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/oleary_george01.html |title=George O'Leary |publisher=Georgia Tech Athletic Association |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Leary earned a [[Bachelor's of Science]] degree in physical education from the [[University of New Hampshire]], where he graduated in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;nd&quot;/&gt;

==Coaching career==
===Early years===
He began his coaching career at [[Central Islip High School]] in New York, serving as their assistant coach from 1968-1974. From 1975-1976 he served as the head coach at Central Islip.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech&quot;/&gt; He then became head coach at [[Liverpool High School]] in New York from 1977-1979. During his time at the time two high schools, between 1975 and 1979, O'Leary amassed a 37-8-1 record, winning more than 82% of the games.&lt;ref name=&quot;nd&quot;/&gt;

His initial collegiate coaching job was as the [[defensive line]]s coach at [[Syracuse Orange|Syracuse]]. He served in this capacity from 1980â1984. Between 1985 and 1986, O'Leary took on the added responsibility of being the Orange's assistant head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech&quot;/&gt; His next assignment was at [[Georgia Tech]], serving as their [[defensive coordinator]] and defensive lines coach from 1987-1991. During this tenure, the team finished 11-0-1 in 1990 and won the national championship, defeating [[Nebraska Cornhuskers football|Nebraska]] at the [[Florida Citrus Bowl]]. Following his initial stint with the Yellow Jackets, O'Leary received his first coaching job in the NFL with the [[San Diego Chargers]], serving as the their defensive lines coach in 1992 and 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;nd&quot;/&gt; In 1994, O'Leary would return to the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets as their defensive coordinator and defensive lines coach, and eventual head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/oleary_george00.html|title=Biography: George O'Leary |publisher=UCF|date=2009-03-15|accessdate=2009-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Georgia Tech===
{{See also|Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football}}
In the 1994 season, O'Leary took over the program as interim head coach with three games remaining in the season, after then head coach [[Bill Lewis (football)|Bill Lewis]] was fired for the team's 1&amp;ndash;7 record just three years after winning the 1990 National Championship. He was later named the head coach prior to the 1995 season.  After two off years, O'Leary rebuilt the program into a consistent winner, leading the team to a victory in the 97 [[Carquest Bowl]] in [[Miami]], [[Florida]]. O'Leary's 1998 team went 10&amp;ndash;2, defeating its archrival the [[University of Georgia]] for the first time in 7 years, as well as the [[University of Notre Dame]] in the [[Gator Bowl]]. For the remainder of his tenure at Georgia Tech, the team went to a bowl game every season.

O'Leary won the Bobby Dodd National Coach of the year in 2000 and the ACC Coach of the Year Award in 1998 and 2000.  During his seven-year stint at Georgia Tech, O'Leary guided the Yellow Jackets to a 52&amp;ndash;33 (.612) record, including five bowl appearances. From 1995&amp;ndash;2001, Georgia Tech recorded five winning seasons in six years, including the 1998 ACC Co-championship and an appearance in the Toyota Gator Bowl on New Year's Day. O'Leary's Georgia Tech teams won at least seven games four times during his tenure, including a 10-win season in 1998 and a nine-win campaign in 2000.

During an NCAA investigation after he had left Georgia Tech and Chan Gailey was the Head Coach it was revealed that the Georgia Tech football program used ineligible players while O'Leary was head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www2.ncaa.org/portal/media_and_events/press_room/2005/november/20051117_georgiatech_infractions_rls.html|title=Georgia Tech Penalized for Allowing Academically Ineligible Student-Athletes to Compete, Lack of Institutional Control|publisher=NCAA|date=2005-11-17|accessdate=2007-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infractions were due to the deficiencies in the school's academic administration who had incorrectly accounted for student-athletes credit hours and were not attributed to O'Leary or his staff.  The initial requirement that Georgia Tech vacate the performances of the football team for games in which these ineligible players participated was overturned on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/459/ncaa-overturns-part-of-penalty-for-georgia-tech|title=NCAA Overturns Part of Penalty for Georgia Tech|publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=2006-05-18|accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, Georgia Tech was placed on probation and lost scholarships because of the violations.

===Notre Dame===
{{See also|Notre Dame Fighting Irish football}}
In 2001, O'Leary left Georgia Tech to take over as the head coach for the [[University of Notre Dame]]. A few days after he was hired, inaccuracies were discovered in his published biographical sketch.  In the biographical sketch, it stated that O'Leary had earned a master's degree from &quot;[[New York University|NYU]]-[[Stony Brook University]],&quot; a non-existent institution and actually two separate institutions over 50 miles apart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/12/15/2001-12-15_by_george__it_s_blarney_o_le.html |title=Dick Weiss, ''By George, It's Blarney'', N.Y. Daily News, Dec. 15, 2001 | location=New York | date=2001-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, he had taken only two courses at SUNY - Stony Brook, and never graduated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.espn.go.com/ncf/news/2001/1214/1295624.html |title=ESPN.com, ''Academic, Athletic Irregularities Force Resignation'', Dec. 14, 2001.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed that he had earned three letters in football at the [[University of New Hampshire]], when the school claimed he had not even played in one game.

O'Leary said in a statement released that day, &quot;Due to a selfish and thoughtless act many years ago, I have personally embarrassed Notre Dame, its alumni and fans.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/college/news/2001/12/14/oleary_notredame/ O'Leary out at Notre Dame after one week]&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Leary blamed the inaccuracies on &quot;[[resume padding]]&quot; that had followed him through his career, admitting: &quot;In seeking employment I prepared a resume that contained inaccuracies regarding my completion of course work for a master's degree and also my level of participation in football at my alma mater. These misstatements were never stricken from my resume or biographical sketch in later years.&quot;

===Minnesota Vikings===
In 2002, O'Leary was hired as the [[defensive coordinator]] and defensive line coach by [[Mike Tice]] for the [[Minnesota Vikings]] and served for two seasons. He was credited with improving the [[2002 Minnesota Vikings season|2002 Vikings]] defense to 10th in the [[NFL]], after it was ranked 30th in 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;tech&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2003/10/26/2003-10-26_o_leary_rewrites_resume_coac.html |title=O'Leary Rewrites Resume: Coach emerges from ND scandal to fix Vikings defense |publisher=Daily News |date= 2003-10-26 |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===University of Central Florida===
{{See also|UCF Knights football}}
[[File:UCF at the Texas goal line.jpg|right|thumb|UCF vs. Texas during the inaugural game at [[Bright House Networks Stadium]]]]
O'Leary left the Vikings in 2004 to become the head coach at the [[University of Central Florida]].  In his first season, the Knights posted their worst season in school history with an 0&amp;ndash;11 record. 

The team rebounded in 2005 after joining [[Conference USA]]. The team finished the season with an 8&amp;ndash;3 record (7&amp;ndash;1 in C-USA).  UCF defeated [[Rice Owls football|Rice]] to clinch the C-USA East Division and earned the right to host the first-ever C-USA Championship Game, a loss to [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]] that was played in front of more than 51,000 people. The team would then go on to play in the [[Hawaii Bowl]], barely losing to [[University of Nevada, Reno|Nevada]] after UCF kicker [[Matt Prater]] missed an extra point in overtime.  The Knights were just the sixth team in NCAA history to go to a bowl a year after going winless.  O'Leary was named Conference USA Coach of the Year in addition to being named National Coach of the Year by CBSSportsLine.com and SportsIllustrated.com. Facing an 11-game schedule with just four home games, O'Leary's UCF squad became just the fourth team in NCAA history to earn a bowl berth while playing seven road games in an 11-game schedule. 

During O'Leary's leadership, UCF has made more of an effort to improve the athletic facilities on campus.  On September 15, 2007, it opened its 45,000 seat on-campus football facility, [[Bright House Networks Stadium]] with a 3-point loss to the [[2007 Texas Longhorns football team|Texas Longhorns]] on ESPN.  O'Leary was instrumental in getting state-of-the-art practice fields and an indoor football practice facility, the only one of its kind in Florida.  UCF had opened the 2007 season on the road with a 25&amp;ndash;23 victory against ACC team [[North Carolina State Wolfpack football|NC State]].  This was the first victory over a [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] conference team in the O'Leary era. After a 64&amp;ndash;12 loss to cross-state rival USF, UCF successfully finished the season leading the C-USA East Division, and again earned the right to host the C-USA Championship in its first season at Bright House Networks Stadium. In a rematch of the 2005 Conference Championship game, the Knights would again face the University of Tulsa in the title game. This time, however, O'Leary would lead the Knights to their first ever Conference Championship, a feat that would land the Knights a bid to the 2007 Liberty Bowl in Memphis, TN. This was the second bowl berth in school history (the first coming in 2005 also under O'Leary) and the second one in three years.

O'Leary led the Knights to a eight-loss season in 2008. The losing season, in conjunction with the controversy surrounding the death of Ereck Plancher, led many to question whether O'Leary's tenure at UCF was coming to a close. O'Leary remained and made significant changes to his coaching staff for the 2009 season. George O'Leary once again lead UCF to bowl eligibility during the 2009 season, and on November 14, 2009, Coach O'Leary lead the Knights to their first win in program history against a nationally ranked opponent, defeating #13 Houston 37&amp;ndash;32 at Bright House Networks Stadium.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.centralfloridafuture.com/ucf-finally-beats-ranked-team-1.2083210 UCF finally beats ranked team&lt;/ref&gt; For the third time in five years the Knights were bowl eligible and faced the [[Rutgers Scarlet Knights]] in the [[2009 St. Petersburg Bowl]], losing 45&amp;ndash;24.

In 2010, for the first time in school history, the Knights were ranked following a nationally televised 40&amp;ndash;33 upset road victory against Houston. After winning 5 straight games, and posting an 11-game conference winning streak, UCF was ranked in all three major college polls released on November 7, 2010. The Knights were ranked 25 in the [[AP Poll]], 23 in the [[USA Today Coaches Poll]] and 25 in the [[Harris Poll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/sports_college_ucf/2010/11/ucf-ranked-no-23-in-coaches-poll-vaulting-into-top-25-for-first-time-in-school-history.html |title=UCF ranked No. 23 in coaches poll and No. 25 in AP, vaulting into Top 25 for first time in school history |work=Orlando Sentinel |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCF fell just short of garnering a BCS ranking, placing 27th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/bigeast/post/_/id/14672/big-east-and-the-bcs-standings |title=Big East and the BCS standings |publisher=ESPN |author= Bennett, Brian |date=2010-11-07 |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCF finished the 2010 regular season with a 10-3 record, after winning the [[2010 Conference USA Football Championship Game|Conference USA Championship]] over the [[SMU Mustangs]], 17&amp;ndash;7, and earning the Knights second invitation to the [[2010 Liberty Bowl (December)|Liberty Bowl]]. The Knights ranked 25th in the final BCS standings, marking the first time UCF has ever been ranked in the BCS standings. UCF also ranked 24th in Coaches Poll, 25th in Harris Poll, and were unofficially ranked 26th in the AP Poll. For the third time in his tenure at UCF, George O'Leary won C-USA Coach of the Year honors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://espn.go.com/blog/ncfnation/post/_/id/35118/oleary-wins-c-usa-coaching-award |title=O'Leary wins C-USA coaching award |publisher=ESPN.com |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then led the Knights to a 10&amp;ndash;6 Liberty Bowl victory over the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]]'s [[Georgia Bulldogs]] and final rankings of 20 and 21 in the Coaches and AP Polls, respectively. The bowl win and 11 total wins were two more firsts for the Knights, capping off the most successful year in team history.

====Ereck Plancher death====
On March 18, 2008, running back Ereck Plancher died after conditioning drills. According to four UCF football players interviewed by the [[Orlando Sentinel]], Coach O'Leary verbally abused Plancher throughout the workout, and continued to push the young man to perform despite what they reported to be obvious physical signs that Plancher was in no shape to continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=3341341|title=Report: Plancher showed signs of distress at end of workout|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-04-25|accessdate=2008-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the four unnamed players, O'Leary cursed at Ereck Plancher in a post-workout huddle.  Plancher collapsed shortly after the workout and was immediately attended by UCF athletic trainers.  He was then transported to a nearby hospital where he died approximately one hour later.

Subsequent to the Orlando Sentinel article, [[ESPN]]'s &quot;[[Outside The Lines]]&quot; program on November 2, 2008 interviewed players who were at the training session at which Plancher became ill and after which he died; they stated that the session was longer and far more rigorous than O'Leary and other UCF Athletics officials have admitted to publicly. They also alleged that O'Leary and other coaches had initially warned players against providing assistance to Plancher when he became visibly distressed. UCF medical records indicate that UCF coaches and trainers knew that Plancher had a [[Sickle-cell disease|sickle-cell]] trait which could lead to problems, and even death, during high-intensity workouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/otl/news/story?id=3672808|title=Report: Conditioned for death: Could UCF have prevented the Ereck Plancher tragedy?|publisher=ESPN.com|date=2008-11-02|accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Academic success====
George O'Leary has reshaped the UCF football program in regard to improved academic results in the classroom and overall team discipline on and off the football field.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncaa.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/082908aam.html UCF Football To Honor 66 For Academic Achievements&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ucfathletics.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/spec-rel/051809aab.html UCF Football Posts Another Strong Academic Semester&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://today.ucf.edu/blog/2009/11/05/knights-make-espn-academic-all-district-team/ Knights Make ESPN Academic All-District Team&lt;/ref&gt; Since O'Leary's arrival, UCF has posted its top two fall semester team grade point averages in the classroom. The Knights set a new school Division I-A history record with a 2.78 team GPA in 2004, only to break that mark with a 2.808 team GPA in the fall of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.ucf.edu/UCFnews/index?page=article&amp;id=00240041070ca5e3e010b382c8adf007ac7 UCF Football Coach OÂLeary Signs 10-Year Contract Extension&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, UCF placed 39 student-athletes on the Conference USA Commissioner's Honor Roll, the most of any football squad in the conference. O'Leary's first recruiting class showed 82 percent of the class receiving academic honor roll accolades. The impressive honor roll number was not limited to the newcomers as 40 percent of the entire team earned a 3.0 GPA or higher during the fall 2004 semester.

The Knights academic success continued during the Fall 2007 semester, when the Knights had an in-season team GPA of 2.753.  This brought the cumulative GPA of the Knights' roster to 2.838.  Furthermore, 44 members of the roster posted a GPA of 3.0 or higher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.orlandosentinel.com/sports/college/knights/orl-ucfbeat2207dec22,0,3881801.story &quot;Knights make the grade&quot; by Kyle Hightower, 12/22/2007&lt;/ref&gt; For the fall 2008 semester the Knights combined cumulative grade point average was 2.969, and has been as high as 3.035 following the 2007 summer semester.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.www.centralfloridafuture.com&quot;&gt;http://media.www.centralfloridafuture.com/media/storage/paper174/news/2008/09/08/News/Successful.StudentAthletes.Get.Decal-3418406.shtml &quot;Successful student-athletes get decal&quot; by Caitlin Smith, 09/08/08&lt;/ref&gt; The overall team cumulative GPA for the fall 2009 semester is 2.99.&lt;ref&gt;http://today.ucf.edu/blog/2009/08/21/scholar-baller-decal-on-69-helmets/ âScholar-Ballerâ Decal on 69 Helmets&lt;/ref&gt; According to UCF's associate director of Academic Services for Student-Athletes, UCF football players are required to attend 10 hours of study hall a week, with at least two hours completed each and every night.&lt;ref name=&quot;media.www.centralfloridafuture.com&quot;/&gt;
