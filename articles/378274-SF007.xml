'''Damn Small Linux''' or '''DSL''' is a computer [[operating system]] for the [[x86 architecture|x86]] family of [[personal computer]]s. It is [[free and open source software]] under the terms of [[GNU GPL]] and other free and open source licenses. It was designed to run [[Graphical user interface|graphical applications]] on older PC [[Computer hardware|hardware]]âfor example, machines with [[Intel 80486|486]]/early [[Pentium (brand)|Pentium]] [[Microprocessor|processors]] and very little [[Random access memory|memory]]. DSL is a [[Live CD]] with a size of 50 [[Megabyte|MB]]. What originally started as an experiment to see how much software could fit in 50 MB eventually became a full-fledged [[Linux]] distribution. It can be installed on storage media with small capacities, like [[bootable business card]]s, [[USB flash drive]]s, various [[memory card]]s, and [[Zip drive]]s.

== History ==
DSL was originally conceived and maintained by John Andrews. For five years the community included Robert Shingledecker, who created the MyDSL system, DSL Control Panel, and other features. After issues with the main developers, Robert was, according to himself, exiled from the project.&lt;ref name=&quot;distrowatch-interview&quot;/&gt; He currently continues his work on [[Tiny Core Linux]] which he created in April 2008.

DSL was originally based on Model-K, a 22 MB stripped down version of [[Knoppix]], but soon after was based on Knoppix proper, allowing much easier [[Remaster (software)|remastering]] and improvements.

== System requirements ==
DSL supports only [[x86 architecture|x86]] PCs. The minimum system requirements are a [[Intel 80486|486]] processor and 8 MB of RAM. DSL has been demonstrated browsing the web with [[Dillo]], running simple games and playing music on systems with a [[Intel 80486|486]] processor and 16 MB of RAM. The system requirements are higher for running [[Mozilla Firefox]] and optional add-ons such as the [[OpenOffice.org]] office suite. It is often used in [[virtual machine]]s due to its small size and modest RAM requirements.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}

== Features ==
The current version of DSL is 4.4.10, released November 18, 2008. DSL currently includes the following software:
* [[Text editor]]s: Beaver, [[Nano (text editor)|Nano]], [[Vim (text editor)|Vim]]
* [[File manager]]s: DFM, emelFM
* Graphics: mtPaint (raster graphics editor), [[xzgv]] (image viewer)
* [[Multimedia]]: gphone, [[XMMS]] with [[MPEG-1]] and [[Video CD|VCD]] support
* Office: [[Siag Office|SIAG]] ([[spreadsheet]] program), [[Ted (word processor)]] with [[spell checker]], [[Xpdf]] (viewer for [[Portable Document Format|PDF]] documents)
* Internet:
** [[Web browser]]s: [[Dillo]], [[Mozilla Firefox|Firefox]], Netrik
** [[Sylpheed]] ([[E-mail client]])
** [[Naim (chat program)|naim]] ([[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]], [[ICQ]], and [[IRC]] client)
** AxyFTP ([[File Transfer Protocol|FTP]] client,, BetaFTPD (FTP server)
** Monkey (web server)
** [[Server Message Block|SMB]] client
** [[Rdesktop]] ([[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP]] client), [[Virtual Network Computing|VNC]] viewer
* Others: [[Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol|DHCP]] client, [[Secure Shell|SSH]]/[[Secure copy|SCP]] client and server; [[Point-to-Point Protocol|PPP]], [[Point-to-Point Protocol over Ethernet|PPPoE]], [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] support; [[FUSE (Linux)|FUSE]], [[Network File System (protocol)|NFS]], [[SSHFS]] support; [[UnionFS]]; generic/[[Ghostscript]] printing support; [[PC card]], [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[Wi-Fi]] support; calculator, games, [[system monitor]]; many [[Command line interface|command-line]] tools

DSL has built-in scripts to download and install [[Advanced Packaging Tool]] (APT). Once APT is enabled, the user can install packages from [[Debian]]'s [[Software repository|repositories]]. Additionally, DSL hosts software ranging from large applications like [[OpenOffice.org]] and [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], to smaller ones such as [[aMSN]], by means of the &quot;MyDSL&quot; system, which allows convenient one-click download and installation of software. Files hosted on MyDSL are called &quot;extensions&quot;. As of June 2008, the MyDSL servers were hosting over 900 applications, plugins, and other extensions.

== Boot options ==
[[Image:DSL 4.0 cheatcodes F2.png|thumb|DSL boot options, called &quot;cheat codes&quot;]]

Boot options are also called &quot;cheat codes&quot; in DSL. Automatic hardware detection may fail, or the user may want to use something other than the default settings (language, keyboard, VGA, fail safe graphics, text mode...). DSL allows the user to enter one or more cheat codes at the boot prompt. If nothing is entered, DSL will boot with the default options. Cheat codes affect many auto-detection and hardware options. Many cheat codes also affect the GUI. The list of cheat codes can be seen at boot time and also at the DSL Wiki.
You can also Run PartyDisk on DSL.

== The MyDSL system ==
MyDSL is handled and maintained mostly by Robert Shingledecker and hosted by many organizations, such as [[ibiblio]] and Belgium's BELNET. There are 2 areas of MyDSL - regular and &quot;testing&quot;. The regular area contains extensions that have been proven stable enough for everyday use and is broken down into different areas such as &quot;apps&quot;, &quot;net&quot;, &quot;system&quot;, and &quot;uci&quot; (&quot;Universal Compressed ISO&quot; - Extensions in .uci format are [[Mount (computing)|mounted]] as a separate [[File system|filesystem]] to minimize RAM usage). The &quot;testing&quot; area is for newly submitted extensions that theoretically work 'as advertised', but may have any number of [[Software bug|bugs]].

The standard flavour of DSL is the [[Live CD]]. There are also other versions available:
* 'Frugal' installation: DSL's [[Cloop|'cloop' image]] is installed, as a single file, to a hard disk [[Disk partitioning|partition]]. This is likely more reliable and secure than a traditional hard drive installation, since the cloop image cannot be directly modified; any changes made are only stored in memory and discarded upon rebooting.
* 'dsl-''version''-embedded.zip': Includes [[QEMU]] for running DSL inside Windows or Linux.
* 'dsl-''version''-initrd.iso': Integrates the normally-separate cloop image into the [[initrd]] image; this allows [[network booting]], using [[Preboot Execution Environment|PXE]]. As a regular [[List of Linux distributions that run from RAM|toram]] boot, requires at least 128mb ram.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}
* 'dsl-''version''-syslinux.iso': Boots using [[SYSLINUX|syslinux]] floppy image emulation instead of [[SYSLINUX|isolinux]]; for very old PCs that cannot boot with isolinux.
* 'dsl-''version''-vmx.zip': A [[virtual machine]] hard drive image that can be run in [[VirtualBox]], [[VMware Workstation]] or [[VMware Player]].
* ''DSL-N'': A larger version of DSL that exceeds the 50 MB limit of [[Bootable business card|business-card CDs]]. DSL-N uses version 2 of the [[GTK+|GTK+ widget toolkit]] and version 2.6 of the [[Linux kernel]]. The latest release of DSL-N, 0.1RC4, is 95 MB in size. It is not actively maintained.

One can also boot DSL using a boot-floppy created from one of the available floppy images ('bootfloppy.img'; 'bootfloppy-grub.img'; 'bootfloppy-usb.img'; or 'pcmciabootfloppy.img') on very old computers, where the [[BIOS]] does not support the [[El Torito (CD-ROM standard)|El Torito Bootable CD Specification]]. The DSL [[Linux kernel|kernel]] is loaded from the floppy disk into RAM, after which the kernel runs DSL from the CD or USB drive.

DSL was [[Porting|ported]] to the [[Xbox]] [[video game console]] as X-DSL. X-DSL requires a [[Xbox#Modding|modified]] Xbox. It can run as a Live CD or be installed to the Xbox hard drive. Users have also run X-DSL from a USB flash drive, using the USB adaptor included with [[Phantasy Star Online]], which plugs into the memory card slot and includes one USB 1.1 port. X-DSL boots into a [[X Window System|X11]]-based GUI; the Xbox [[Game controller|controller]] can be used to control the mouse pointer and enter text using a [[virtual keyboard]]. X-DSL has a [[Fluxbox]] desktop, with programs for E-mail, web browsing, word processing and playing music. X-DSL can be customized by downloading extensions from the same MyDSL servers as DSL.

== Live USB ==
A [[Live USB]] of Damn Small Linux can be created manually or with [[UNetbootin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/ |title=UNetbootin - Homepage and Downloads}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current status of the project ==
Due to infighting among the project's originators and main developers, DSL development seems to be at a standstill, and the future of the project is uncertain, much to the dismay of many of the users.&lt;ref name=&quot;distrowatch-interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20090323&amp;mode=68#feature |title=Interview with Robert Shingledecker, creator of Tiny Core Linux |publisher=DistroWatch |work=DistroWatch Weekly, Issue 295 |date=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
