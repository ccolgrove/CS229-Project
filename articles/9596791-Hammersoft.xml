'''Tyne O'Connell''' (full name '''Clementyne Rose O'Connell''') is a British author. She has written for publications such as ''[[Ms. magazine|Ms.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, T: Ms. Magazine US, page 92. September/October 1998&lt;/ref&gt; ''Elle UK'' and ''Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell, T: &quot;Journal&quot;, page 46. IPC Magazines, March 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Her short stories appear in ''Girls' Night Out'' and ''Kid's Night In''. She is a contributor to ''Holiday Goddess''.

==Contemporary fiction==
O'Connell's first novel, ''Sex, Lies and Litigation'' was published in the UK in 1996 by Headline Review. Headline Review published five books by O'Connell, the most popular of which was ''What's A Girl to Do?''. In 2000 she made her US publishing dÃ©but with ''The Sex Was Great But...'', published by RDI and followed by ''Sex With The Ex''.

O'Connell's stories tend to feature British eccentrics and aristos at large.

==YA fiction==

In 2003 O'Connell began writing young adult fiction.  ''Pulling Princes'' published  by Bloomsbury US and Piccadilly UK, and translated into 13 languages was the first in the Calypso Chronicles. The series of four books focus on the adventures of a group of privileged and aristocratic teenagers attending two English single-sex [[boarding schools]] in Berkshire.

''Pulling Princes, Stealing Princes, Dueling Princes'' &amp; ''Dumping Princes'' were published by [[Bloomsbury US]] and Piccadilly UK. A further teen novel was published by Bloomsbury US in 2007: ''True Love, The Sphinx and Other Unsolvable Riddles'' which the [[School Library Journal]] referred to as &quot;This flirty, fun romcom, told from four distinctive points of view, reads like an old-time comedy of errors. O'Connell describes Egypt with such vitality and richness that it shines as a separate character. This novel is a trip worth taking..&quot;&lt;ref&gt;School Library Journal, 2008, Reed Business Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, coinciding with the Royal Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton, O'Connell's first two books from the Calypso Chronicles were published together in the UK, US and several other countries in a single volume entitled ''A Royal Match''.
