The '''culture of Australia''' is essentially a [[Western culture]] influenced by the unique geography of the [[Australian continent]] and by the diverse input of [[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples, and various waves of multi-ethnic migration which followed the [[British colonisation of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominance of the [[English language]], the existence of a [[democratic]] [[Westminster system]] of government, [[Christianity]] as the dominant religion and the popularity of sports such as [[cricket]] and [[Rugby football|rugby]] evidence a significant [[Anglo-Celtic]] heritage, but Australia today hosts a great diversity of cultural practices and pursuits.

[[Aboriginal Australians|Aboriginal people]] are believed to have arrived as early as 60,000 years ago, and evidence of [[Aboriginal art]] in Australia dates back at least 30,000 years. Several [[States and Territories of Australia|states and territories]] had their origins as penal colonies, with the [[First Fleet]] of British convicts arriving at [[Sydney Cove]] in 1788. Stories of outlaws like the [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] have endured in [[Australian music]], [[Australian cinema|cinema]] and [[Australian literature|literature]]. The [[Australian gold rushes]] from the 1850s brought wealth as well as new social tensions to Australia, including the miners' [[Eureka Stockade]] rebellion. The colonies established elected parliaments and rights for workers and women in advance of most other Western nations.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;&gt;Geoffrey Blainey; A Very Short History of the World; Penguin Books; 2004; ISBN 978-0-14-300559-9&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Federation|Federation]] in 1901 evidenced a growing sense of national identity - with the [[Heidelberg School]] painters and writers like [[Banjo Paterson]], [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Dorothea McKellar]]. The World Wars profoundly altered Australia's sense of identity - with [[World War I]] introducing [[ANZAC]], and [[World War II]] seeing a reorientation from Britain to the [[United States]] as a [[ANZUS|major ally]].  After the second war, 6.5 million migrants from 200 nations brought immense new diversity, and Australians grew increasingly aware of proximity to Asia.

[[Egalitarianism]], informality and an [[Australian comedy|irreverent sense of humour]] have been common themes of cultural commentary - exemplified by the works of [[C J Dennis]], [[Barry Humphries]] and [[Paul Hogan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/people_culture.html |title=About Australia: People, culture and lifestyle |publisher=Dfat.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fascination with the [[outback]] has persisted in the [[arts in Australia]] and [[Australian agriculture|agriculture]] has been an important economic sector, but the [[demographics of Australia]] show it to be one of the most urbanised populations in the world, with more than 75 per cent of people living an urban lifestyle, largely in the capital cities along the coast. These comprise the [[melting pot]]s of what has become known since the 1970s as ''[[Multiculturalism in Australia|multicultural Australia]]''.

The capital cities host such internationally renowned cultural institutions as the [[Sydney Opera House]] and [[National Gallery of Victoria]], and Australia has contributed many artists to international pop and classical culture, from hard [[rock music|rock]]'s [[AC/DC]] to [[opera]]'s [[Joan Sutherland]]. Australians also support or participate enthusiastically in a [[Sport in Australia|wide variety of sports]], including [[Australian Rules Football]] and a  vibrant [[surf culture]].

==From Indigenous Australia to multicultural Australia==
{{Main|History of Australia}}

[[File:Showing method of attack with boomerang - NMA-15147.jpg|thumb|left|A Luritja man demonstrating method of attack with [[boomerang]] under cover of shield (1920).]]

The oldest surviving cultural traditions in Australia â and some of the oldest surviving cultural traditions on earth â are those of Australia's [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islanders|Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. Their ancestors have inhabited Australia for between 40,000 and 60,000 years, living a [[hunter-gatherer]] lifestyle until the arrival of Europeans began to alter their patterns of living. Today, the Indigenous population is estimated at around 2.3 per cent of the total population - approximately 483,000 people. The traditional belief system of Australia's aborigines is known as [[The Dreamtime]]. Conflict and reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians has been a source of much art and literature in Australia, and ancient [[Aboriginal art]]istic styles and iconic inventions such as the [[boomerang]], the [[didgeridoo]] and [[Indigenous Australian music]] have become symbols of modern Australia.

The arrival of Europeans from 1788 onward profoundly disrupted Aboriginal life. According to the historian [[Geoffrey Blainey]], during the colonial period: &quot;In a thousand isolated places there were occasional shootings and spearings. Even worse, smallpox, measles, influenza and other new diseases swept from one Aboriginal camp to another&amp;nbsp;... The main conqueror of Aborigines was to be disease and its ally, demoralisation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceB&quot;/&gt;

The rest of Australia is descended from the more recent migrants who have arrived from around 200 countries since the [[First Fleet]] of British convicts arrived to establish the first European settlement at Sydney in 1788. The [[British Empire]] expanded across the whole continent and established six colonies.  [[South Australia]] established itself as a &quot;free colony&quot; with no convicts and a vision for a territory with political and religious freedoms, together with opportunities for wealth through business and pastoral investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Wentworth]] established Australia's first political party in 1835 to demand [[Parliamentary democracy|democratic government]] for New South Wales. From the 1850s, the colonies set about writing constitutions which produced democratically progressive parliaments as [[Constitutional Monarchy|Constitutional Monarchies]] with the [[British monarch]] as the symbolic head of state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm AEC.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Women's suffrage in Australia]] was achieved from the 1890s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/reform.htm AEC.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt;  Women became eligible to vote in South Australia in 1895.

The [[Commonwealth of Australia]] was founded by a series of referendums conducted in the British colonies of [[Australasia]] (although Fiji and New Zealand subsequently dropped out of the process)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our Constitution|last=Brodie|first=Scott|publisher=Franklin Watts Australia|year=1999|isbn=978-0-9585649-0-8|pages=4â8}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the [[Australian Constitution]] in 1901, which established a federal democracy and enshrined [[human rights]] such as sections 41 (right to vote), 80 (right to trial by jury), 116 (freedom of religion) as foundational principles of Australian law and included economic rights such as restricting the government to acquiring property  only &quot;on just terms&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/journals/MULR/1999/31.html Human Rights under the Australian Constitution by George Williams - [1999&amp;#93; MULR 31; (1999) 23 Melbourne University Law Review 817]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Labor Party]] was established in the 1890s and the [[Liberal Party of Australia]] in 1944, both rising to be the dominant political parties and rivals of [[Australian politics]], though various [[List of political parties in Australia|other parties]] have been and remain influential. Voting is compulsory in Australia and government is essentially formed by a group commanding a majority of seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives]] selecting a leader who becomes [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. Australia remains a [[Monarchy in Australia|constitutional monarchy]] in which the largely ceremonial and procedural duties of the monarch are performed by a [[Governor General of Australia|Governor General]] selected by the Australian government.

The colonies experienced a taste of multi-ethnic immigration during the [[Australian gold rushes]], but following Federation in 1901, the Parliament instigated the [[White Australia Policy]] that gave preference to British migrants and ensured that Australia remained a predominantly Anglo-Celtic society until well into the 20th Century. The post-[[World War II]] immigration program saw the policy dismantled by successive governments, permitting large numbers of Southern European, and later Asian and Middle Eastern migrants to arrive. The [[Menzies Government (1949-1966)]] and [[Holt Government]] dismantled the legal barriers to multi-ethnic immigration and  by the 1970s, the [[Whitlam Government|Whitlam]] and [[Fraser Government]]s were promoting [[multiculturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/08abolition.htm Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 8.

Some [[States and Territories of Australia]] retained discriminatory laws relating to voting rights for [[Indigenous Australians]] into the 1960s, at which point full legal equality was established. A [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]] to include all Aborigines in the national electoral roll census was overwhelmingly approved by voters. In the mid 1960s, [[Charles N. Perkins|Charles Perkins]] of the [[University of Sydney]], helped organise [[Freedom Ride (Australia)|freedom rides]] to expose discrimination in rural communities. In 1966, the [[Gurindji strike]] was led by [[Vincent Lingiari]] in a quest for equal pay and recognition of land rights at a cattle station.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Bolton (1990) p.193 and 195&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, Liberal Senator [[Neville Bonner]] became the first Aboriginal in the Federal Parliament.

Australia's contemporary immigration program has two components: a program for skilled and family migrants and a humanitarian program for refugees and asylum seekers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.immi.gov.au/media/fact-sheets/60refugee.htm Australian Immigration Fact Sheet 60 - Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Program] {{WebCite|url=http://www.webcitation.org/5adoXSVqA|date =2008-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2010, the post-war immigration program had received more than 6.5 million migrants from every continent. The population tripled in the six decades to around 21 million in 2010, comprising people originating from 200 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/aib/overview.html Australia in Brief: Australia - an overview - Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt; More than 43 per cent of Australians were either born overseas or have one parent who was born overseas. The population is highly urbanised, with more than 75% of Australians live in urban centres, largely along the coast.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

Contemporary Australia is a pluralistic society, rooted in [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] traditions - in which tolerance, informality and egalitarianism are seen as key societal values. Heavily influenced by [[Anglo-Celtic]] origins the culture of Australia has also been shaped by multi-ethnic migration which  has influenced all aspects of Australian life, including business, the arts, [[Australian cuisine|cooking]], [[Australian comedy|sense of humour]] and sporting tastes.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

==National symbols==
[[File:Flag of Australia (converted).svg|thumb|The [[Australian flag]].]]
When the Australian colonies federated on 1 January 1901, an official competition for a design for an [[Australian flag]] was held. The final design which was adopted contains the [[Union Flag]] in the left corner symbolising Australia's historical links to the [[United Kingdom]], the stars of the [[Southern Cross]] on the right half of the flag indicating Australia's geographical location and the seven pointed Federation Star in the bottom left representing the six [[states and territories of Australia|states and the territories of Australia]]. Other official flags include&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/symbols/otherflag.cfm It's an Honour - Symbols - Other Australian Flags]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Australian Aboriginal flag]], the [[Torres Strait Islander flag]] and the flags of the individual states and territories.

Green and gold were confirmed as Australia's national colours by the [[Governor General of Australia|governor general]] in 1984, though the colours had been adopted by many national sporting teams long before this. The [[golden wattle]] was officially proclaimed as the national floral emblem in 1988. The [[Australian Coat of Arms]] was granted by [[King George V]] in 1912 and consists of a shield containing the badges of the six states, within an ermine border. The crest above the shield and helmet is a seven-pointed gold star on a blue and gold wreath, representing the 6 states and the territories. The shield is supported by a [[red kangaroo]] and an [[emu]].  A revised version of the 19th century song â[[Advance Australia Fair]]â became Australiaâs official national anthem in 1984.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/australia_national_symbols.html Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Royal symbols==

{{Main|Australian Royal Symbols}}
[[File:Royal Standard of Australia.svg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Queen's Personal Australian Flag]].]]
Reflecting the country's status as a [[constitutional monarchy]], a number of royal symbols exist in Australia. These include symbols of the [[Monarchy in Australia|monarch of Australia]], as well as the monarch's [[Viceroy|Vice-regal]] representatives.

Despite the fact that the [[Queen of Australia]] is not resident in Australia itself, the Crown remains a visible part of the everyday lives of Australians. The birthday of the monarch is celebrated as a public holiday across all states and territories, although the dates vary. The [[Australian Dollar|Australian currency]], including all coins and the five dollar note, bear an image of the reigning monarch, [[Monarchy in Australia|Queen Elizabeth II]]. Around 12% of public lands in Australia are referred to as [[Crown land]], including reserves set aside for environmental conservation as well as vacant land. There are many geographic places that have been named in honour of a reigning monarch, including the states of [[Queensland]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], named after [[Queen Victoria]], with numerous streets, squares, parks and buildings carrying the names of past or present members of the Royal Family. Through royal [[patronage]] there are many [[List of Australian organisations with royal patronage|organisations in Australia]] that have been granted a ''Royal'' prefix. These organisations, including branches of the [[Australian Defence Force]], often incorporate royal symbols into their imagery.

==Language==
[[File:DennisWriting.jpg|thumb|left|[[C. J. Dennis]], poetic humourist of [[Australian English]].]]

{{See|Languages of Australia|Australian slang|Indigenous Australian languages|Regional variation in Australian English}}

Although Australia has no [[official language]], it is largely [[monoglottism|monolingual]] with English being the &quot;[[de facto]]&quot; [[national language]]. [[Australian English]] generally follows the [[Queen's English]] spelling and grammar norms, but has its own distinctive accent and vocabulary â including the distinctive &quot;[[g'day]]&quot;, a common and renowned greeting used in Australia. According to the 2001 census, English is the only language spoken in the home for around 80% of the population. The next most common languages spoken at home are Chinese (2.1%), Italian (1.9%), and Greek (1.4%). A considerable proportion of first- and second-generation migrants are bilingual. Australia has a sign language known as [[Auslan]], which is the main language of about 6,500 deaf people.

It is believed that there were between 200 and 300 Australian Aboriginal languages at the time of first European contact, but only about 70 of these languages have survived and all but 20 of these are now endangered. An indigenous language is the main language for about 50,000 people (0.25% of the population).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dalby |first=Andrew |authorlink=Andrew Dalby |title=Dictionary of Languages |year=1998 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing plc |isbn=978-0-7475-3117-3 |page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Comedy is an important part of the Australian identity. The &quot;Australian sense of humour&quot; is often characterised as dry, irreverent and ironic, exemplified by the works of performing artists like [[Barry Humphries]] and [[Paul Hogan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;australia.gov.au&quot;&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/austn-humour Australian humour - australia.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; The quirks of Australian multiculturalism have also provided fodder for comedy.

The convicts of the [[History of Australia (1788-1850)|early colonial period]] helped establish anti-authoritarianism as a hallmark of Australian comedy. Influential in the establishment of stoic, dry wit as a characteristic of Australian humour were the [[bush ballad]]eers of the 19th century, including [[Henry Lawson]], author of [[The Loaded Dog]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/henry-lawson Henry Lawson: Australian writer - australia.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; His contemporary, [[Banjo Paterson]], contributed a number of classic comic poems. [[CJ Dennis]] wrote humour in the Australian vernacular - notably in &quot;[[The Songs of a Sentimental Bloke]]&quot;. The ''[[Dad and Dave]]'' series about a farming family was an enduring hit of the early 20th century. The [[World War I]] [[ANZAC]] troops were said to often display irreverence in their relations with superior officers and dark humour in the face of battle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.awm.gov.au/exhibitions/1918/soldier/superiors.asp Australians in France: 1918 - Friends and Foe - Australian soldiers' relations with their superiors &amp;#124; Australian War Memorial]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian comedy  has a strong tradition of self-mockery, from the outlandish [[Barry McKenzie]] ''expat-in-Europe'' movies of the 1970s, to the quirky outback characters of the ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]'' films of the 1980s, the suburban parody of [[Working Dog Productions]]' 1997 film ''[[The Castle (film)|The Castle]]'' and the dysfunctional suburban mother-daughter sitcom ''[[Kath &amp; Kim]]''. In the 1970s, satirical talk-show host [[Norman Gunston]] (played by Garry McDonald), with his [[malapropism]]s, sweep-over hair and poorly shaven face, rose to great popularity by pioneering the satirical &quot;ambush&quot; interview technique (later employed by Britain's [[Sacha Baron Cohen]] as [[Ali G]]) and giving unique interpretations of pop songs. [[Roy and HG]] provide an affectionate but irreverent parody of Australia's obsession with sport. ''[[The Dream with Roy and HG]]'' has been a regular feature of Olympic television coverage since the [[2000 Sydney Olympics]].

Since the 1950s, the satirical character creations of [[Barry Humphries]] have included housewife &quot;gigastar&quot; [[Edna Everage]] and &quot;Australian cultural attachÃ©&quot; [[Les Patterson]], whose interests include boozing, chasing women and flatulence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://australia.gov.au/about-australia/australian-story/barry-humphries Barry Humphries - australia.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; For his delivery of dadaist and [[Absurdism|absurdist]] humour to millions, biographer Anne Pender described Humphries in 2010 as &quot;the most significant comedian to emerge since [[Charlie Chaplin]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/entertainment/books/absurd-moments-in-the-frocks-of-the-dame-20100914-15ar3.html Barry Humphries &amp;#124; Absurd moments: in the frocks of Dame Edna]&lt;/ref&gt;

The vaudeville talents of [[Graham Kennedy]], [[Don Lane]] and [[Bert Newton]] earned popular success during the early years of Australian television. The variety show ''[[Hey Hey It's Saturday]]'' screened for three decades. Among the best loved Australian sitcoms was ''[[Mother and Son]]'', about a divorcee who had moved back into the suburban home of his mother - but [[sketch comedy]] has been the stalwart of [[Australian television]]. ''[[The Comedy Company]]'', in the 1980s, featured the comic talents of [[Mary-Anne Fahey]], [[Ian McFadyen]], [[Mark Mitchell]], [[Glenn Robbins]], [[Kym Gyngell]] and others. Growing out of [[Melbourne University]] and ''[[The D-Generation]]'' came ''[[The Late Show (Australian TV series)|The Late Show]]'' (1991â1993), starring the influential talents [[Santo Cilauro]], [[Tom Gleisner]], [[Jane Kennedy]], [[Tony Martin]], [[Mick Molloy]] and [[Rob Sitch]] (who later formed [[Working Dog Productions]]); and during the 1980s and 1990s ''[[Fast Forward (TV series)|Fast Forward]]'' ([[Steve Vizard]], [[Magda Szubanski]], [[Marg Downey]], [[Michael Veitch]], [[Peter Moon (comedian)|Peter Moon]] and others) and its successor ''[[Full Frontal (TV series)|Full Frontal]]'', which launched the career of [[Eric Bana]] and featured [[Shaun Micallef]].

The perceptive wit of [[Clive James]] and [[Andrew Denton]] has been popular in the talk-show interview style. Representatives of the &quot;bawdy&quot; strain of Australian comedy include [[Rodney Rude]], [[Austen Tayshus]] and [[Chad Morgan]]. Quintessential [[Australian country music]] hits included the novelty songs [[A Pub with No Beer]] (1957) by [[Slim Dusty]] and [[Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport]] (1960s) by [[Rolf Harris]] which help define a comic tradition of [[Australian music]].

Cynical satire has had enduring popularity, with television series such as ''[[Frontline (Australian TV series)|Frontline]]'', targeting the inner workings of &quot;news and current affairs&quot; TV journalism, ''[[The Hollowmen]]'' (2008), set in the office of the Prime Minister's political advisory (spin) department, and ''[[The Chaser]]'' series, which cynically examines domestic and international politics.&lt;ref name=&quot;australia.gov.au&quot;/&gt; Actor/writer [[Chris Lilley (comedian)|Chris Lilley]] has produced a series of award winning &quot;mockumentary&quot; style television series about Australian characters since 2005.

Post-war immigration has seen migrant humour flourish: from ''[[They're a Weird Mob]]'' (1966) about an Italian immigrant adapting to Sydney life, to the works of Vietnamese refugee [[Anh Do]], Egyptian stand-up comic [[Akmal Saleh]]  and  [[Nick Giannopoulos]]' ''[[Wog Boy 2: Kings of Mykonos]]'' (2010) about second generation Australian Greeks returning to their ancestral home.

The annual [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]] is one of the largest comedy festivals in the world, and a popular fixture on the city's cultural calendar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfam.org.au/media/article.php?id=12 Media Releases &amp;#124; Oxfam Australia]&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian tastes can be eclectic when it comes to imported comedy from other English speaking countries, with American series like ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', and ''[[The Simpsons]]'' acquiring devoted followings in Australia - but so too such quintessentially British comedies  as  ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[The Goodies]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smh.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/entertainment/arts/young-crowd-goes-yum-yum-over-veteran-goodies/2009/10/17/1255624772594.html |title=Young crowd goes 'yum, yum' over veteran Goodies - Arts - Entertainment |publisher=Smh.com.au |date=17 October 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[arts in Australia]]â[[cinema of Australia|film]], [[music of Australia|music]], [[art of Australia|painting]], [[theatre]], [[dance in Australia|dance]] and craftsâhave achieved international recognition. While much of Australia's cultural output has traditionally tended to fit with general trends and styles in Western arts, the arts as practiced by [[indigenous Australians]] represent a unique Australian cultural tradition, and Australia's landscape and history have contributed to some unique variations in the styles inherited by Australia's various migrant communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;painters&quot;&gt;{{cite web

At the close of the 19th century, the art of the [[Heidelberg School]] began to capture the unique colours of the [[Australian bush]], famed writers [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]] presented conflicting views of the harshness and romance of life in Australia, and performing artists like Dame [[Nellie Melba]] succeeded internationally in the traditional European arts. During the 20th century, writers and performers like [[C J Dennis]], [[Barry Humphries]] and [[Paul Hogan]] both mocked and celebrated Australian cultural stereotypes, while shifting demographics saw a diversification of artistic output, with writers like feminist [[Germaine Greer]] challenging traditional cultural norms.

Australia's capital cities each support traditional  &quot;[[high culture]]&quot; institutions in the form of major art galleries, ballet troupes, theatres, symphony orchestras, opera houses and dance companies. Leading Australian performers in these fields have included the opera Dames [[Nellie Melba]] and [[Joan Sutherland]], dancers [[Edouard Borovansky]] and [[Robert Helpmann|Sir Robert Helpmann]], and choreographer/dancers such as [[Graeme Murphy]] and [[Meryl Tankard]]. [[Opera Australia]] is based in Sydney at the world renowned [[Sydney Opera House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/opera/ |title=Opera in Australia - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=23 February 1931 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Ballet]], [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra|Melbourne]] and [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra|Sydney]] symphony orchestras are also well regarded cultural institutions.

Organisations such as the [[Sydney Theatre Company]] and [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] have fostered students of theatre, film, and television several of whom have continued to international success, with actors like [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Geoffrey Rush]] having been associated with both institutions.

Independent culture thrives in all capital cities and exists in most large regional towns. The independent arts of [[music of Australia|music]], [[cinema of Australia|film]], [[art of Australia|art]] and [[street art]] are the most extensive. [[Melbourne]]'s independent music scene, is one of the largest in the world, whilst another can be found in the multitude of international street artists visiting Melbourne and, to a lesser extent, other major cities, to work for a period of time.

{{Main|Australian Literature}}

Australian writers who have obtained international renown include the [[Nobel Prize for Literature|Nobel winning]] author [[Patrick White]], as well as authors [[Peter Carey (novelist)|Peter Carey]], [[Thomas Keneally]], [[Colleen McCullough]], [[Nevil Shute]] and [[Morris West]]. Notable contemporary expatriate authors include the feminist [[Germaine Greer]], art historian [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] and humorists [[Barry Humphries]] and [[Clive James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/literature/ |title=Australian language, letters and literature - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the important authors of classic Australian works are the poets [[Henry Lawson]], [[Banjo Paterson]], [[C J Dennis]] and [[Dorothea McKellar]]. Dennis wrote in the Australian vernacular with such works as ''[[The Sentimental Bloke]]'', while McKellar wrote the iconic patriotic poem'' [[My Country]]'' which rejected prevailing fondness for England's &quot;green and shaded lanes&quot; and declared: &quot;I love a sunburnt country&quot;. At one point, Lawson and Paterson contributed a series of verses to ''[[The Bulletin]]'' magazine in which they engaged in a [[Bulletin Debate|literary debate]] about the nature of life in Australia. Lawson said Paterson was a romantic and Paterson said Lawson was full of doom and gloom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/lawson/ |title=Henry Lawson: Australian writer - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=2 September 1922 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawson is widely regarded as one of Australia's greatest writers of short stories, while Paterson's poems  [[The Man from Snowy River (poem)|The Man From Snowy River]] and [[Clancy of the Overflow]] remain amongst the most popular Australian bush poems. Significant political poets of the 20th century included Dame [[Mary Gilmore]] and [[Judith Wright]]. Among the best known contemporary poets are [[Les Murray (poet)|Les Murray]] and [[Bruce Dawe]].

Novelists of classic Australian works include [[Marcus Clarke]] (''[[For the Term of His Natural Life]]''), [[Rolf Boldrewood]] (''[[Robbery Under Arms]]''), [[Miles Franklin]] (''[[My Brilliant Career]]''), [[Mary Durack]] (''[[Kings in Grass Castles]]'' and ''Keep Him My Country'') and [[Jeannie Gunn]] (''[[We of the Never Never]]''). Franklin, Durack and Gunn are notable for their accounts of Outback living from a female perspective. [[Ruth Park]], author of ''[[The Harp in the South]]'', contributed a number of iconic fictional works about urban living.

In terms of children's literature,  [[Norman Lindsay]] (''[[The Magic Pudding]]'') and [[May Gibbs]] (''[[Snugglepot and Cuddlepie]]'') are among the Australian classics.

The extraordinary circumstances of the convict foundations of [[Theatre of Australia|Australian theatre]] are recounted in [[Thomas Keneally]]'s novel ''[[The Playmaker]]''. Eminent writers of Australian plays have included [[Steele Rudd]] (''[[On Our Selection]]''), [[David Williamson]], [[Alan Seymour]] and [[Nick Enright]].

Although historically only a small proportion of Australia's population have lived outside the major cities, many of Australia's most distinctive stories and legends originate in the [[outback]], in the [[Drover (Australian)|drovers]] and squatters and people of the barren, dusty plains.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seal 1989 50&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Seal|first=Graham|title=The Hidden Culture: Folklore in Australian Society|page=50|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1989|location=Melbourne|isbn=978-0-19-554919-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Unaipon]] is known as the first indigenous author. [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] was the first [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal Australian]] to publish a book of verse.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Oodgeroo Noonuccal.&quot; Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement, Vol. 27. Gale, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; A significant contemporary account of the experiences of Indigenous Australia can be found in [[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]'s ''[[My Place (book)|My Place]]''. Contemporary academics and activists including [[Marcia Langton]] and [[Noel Pearson (Australian lawyer)|Noel Pearson]] are prominent essayists and authors on Aboriginal issues.

[[Charles Bean]] (''The Story of Anzac: From the Outbreak of War to the End of the First Phase of the Gallipoli Campaign 4 May 191''5, 1921) [[Geoffrey Blainey]] (''The Tyranny of Distance'', 1966), [[Robert Hughes (critic)|Robert Hughes]] (''[[The Fatal Shore]]'', 1987), [[Manning Clark]] ''(A History of Australia'', 1962â87), and [[Marcia Langton]] (''First Australians'', 2008) are authors of important Australian histories.

The ceremonial dances of [[indigenous Australians]] which recount the stories of the [[Dreamtime]], comprise theatrical aspects and have been performed since time immemorial{{Quantify|date=September 2010}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/indigenous/ceremony/ |title=Australian Indigenous ceremony - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date=15 January 2008 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; European traditions came to Australia with the [[First Fleet]] in 1788, with the first production being performed in 1789 by convicts.&lt;ref name=&quot;olioweb.me.uk&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.olioweb.me.uk/plays/ |title=Our Country's Good: The Recruiting Officer |publisher=Olioweb.me.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two centuries later, the extraordinary circumstances of the foundations of Australian theatre were recounted in ''Our Country's Good'' by [[Timberlake Wertenbaker]]: the participants were prisoners watched by sadistic guards and the leading lady was under threat of the death penalty.&lt;ref name=&quot;olioweb.me.uk&quot;/&gt;

The [[Theatre Royal, Hobart]], opened in 1837 and it remains the oldest theatre in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatreroyal.com.au/history.html |title=a great night out! - Hobart Tasmania |publisher=Theatre Royal |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian gold rushes]] beginning in the 1850s provided funds for the construction of grand theatres in the Victorian style. A theatre was built on the present site of Melbourne's [[Princess Theatre, Melbourne|Princess Theatre]] in 1854. The present building now hosts major international productions as well as live performance events such as the [[Melbourne International Comedy Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marrinertheatres.com.au/venue_princess.jsp ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Melbourne Athenaeum]] was built during this period and later became Australia's first cinema, screening ''[[The Story of the Kelly Gang]]'', the world's first feature film in 1906. [[Mark Twain]], [[Nellie Melba]], [[Lawrence Olivier]] and [[Barry Humphries]] have all performed on this historic stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.melbourneathenaeum.org.au/content/view/20/37/ |title=Melbourne Athenaeum Library - History of the Melbourne Athenaeum |publisher=Melbourneathenaeum.org.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Queen's Theatre, Adelaide]] opened with [[Shakespeare]] in  1841 and is today the oldest theatre on the mainland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.sa.gov.au/queens/about.htm |title=Queen's Theatre |publisher=History.sa.gov.au |date=1 July 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Federation in 1901, theatre productions evidenced the new sense of national identity. ''On Our Selection'' (1912) by [[Steele Rudd]], told of the adventures of a pioneer farming family and became immensely popular. Sydney's grand [[Capitol Theatre, Sydney|Capitol Theatre]] opened in 1928 and after restoration remains one of the nation's finest auditoriums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.capitoltheatre.com.au/explore.htm ]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, ''[[Summer of the Seventeenth Doll]]'' by [[Ray Lawler]] portrayed resolutely Australian characters and went on to international acclaim. That same year, young Melbourne artist [[Barry Humphries]] performed as [[Edna Everage]] for the first time at [[Melbourne University]]'s Union Theatre. Humphries left for London in his early 20s and enjoyed success on stage, including in [[Lionel Bart]]'s musical, [[Oliver!]]. His satirical stage creations - notably Dame Edna and later [[Les Patterson]] - became Australian cultural icons. Humphries also achieved success in the USA with tours on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] and television appearances and has been honoured in Australia and Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6757531.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; The man behind Dame Edna Everage |publisher=BBC News |date=15 June 2007 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Institute of Dramatic Art]] was created in Sydney in 1958. This institute has since produced a list of famous alumni including [[Cate Blanchett]], [[Mel Gibson]] and [[Baz Luhrmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nida.edu.au/default.aspx?FolderID=15 |title=About Us - National Institute of Dramatic Art |publisher=NIDA |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Belvoir St Theatre]] presented works by [[Nick Enright]] and [[David Williamson]]. In 1973, the [[Sydney Opera House]] was inaugurated in Sydney - becoming perhaps{{Weasel-inline|date=September 2010}} the most famous theatre building in the world.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} [[Opera Australia]] made its home in the building and its reputation was enhanced by the presence of the diva [[Joan Sutherland]].

The Legend of The Wild One]]'').

In ''The One Day of the Year'', [[Alan Seymour]] studied the paradoxical nature of the [[ANZAC Day]] commemoration by Australians of the defeat of the [[Battle of Gallipoli]]. ''Ngapartji Ngapartji'', by [[Scott Rankin]] and Trevor Jamieson, recounts the story of the effects on the [[Pitjantjatjara people]] of nuclear testing in the Western Desert during the [[Cold War]].

{{Main|Architecture of Australia}}

Australia has three architectural listings on [[UNESCO]]'s [[World Heritage]] list: [[Australian Convict Sites]] (comprising a collection of separate sites around Australia, including [[Hyde Park Barracks, Sydney|Hyde Park Barracks]] in Sydney, [[Port Arthur, Tasmania|Port Arthur]] in Tasmania, and [[Fremantle Prison]] in Western Australia); the [[Sydney Opera House]]; and the [[Royal Exhibition Building]] in Melbourne. Contemporary Australian architecture includes a number of other iconic structures, including the [[Sydney Harbour Bridge|Harbour Bridge]] in Sydney and [[Parliament House, Canberra]]. Significant architects who have worked in Australia include Governor [[Lachlan Macquarie]]'s colonial architect, [[Francis Greenway]]; the ecclesiastical architect [[William Wardell]]; the designer of [[Canberra]]'s layout, [[Walter Burley Griffin]]; the [[modernist]] [[Harry Seidler]]; and [[JÃ¸rn Utzon]], designer of the Sydney Opera House. The [[National Trust of Australia]] is a non-governmental organisation charged with protecting Australia's built heritage.

Evidence of permanent structures built by [[indigenous Australians]] before [[European settlement of Australia]] in 1788 is limited. Much of what they built was temporary, and was used for housing and other needs. As a [[British colony]], the first European buildings were derivative of the European fashions of the time. Tents and [[wattle and daub]] huts preceded more substantial structures. [[Georgian architecture]] is seen in early government buildings of Sydney and [[Tasmania]] and the homes of the wealthy. While the major Australian cities enjoyed the boom of the [[Victorian Era]], the [[Australian gold rushes]] of the mid-19th century brought major construction works and exuberant [[Victorian architecture]] to the major cities, particularly Melbourne, and major provincials such as [[Ballarat, Victoria|Ballarat]] and [[Bendigo, Victoria|Bendigo]]. Other significant architectural movements in Australian architecture include the [[Federation style]] of the turn of the 20th century and the modern styles of the late 20th century which also saw many older buildings demolished. The [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] is a term which denotes the primarily residential style of warm climate architecture developed in Queensland and northern parts of New South Wales.

Religious architecture is also prominent throughout Australia, with large [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] or [[Catholicism in Australia|Catholic]] cathedrals in every major city and Christian churches in most towns. Notable examples include  [[St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne]] and  [[St Mary's Cathedral, Sydney]]. Other houses of worship are also common, reflecting the cultural diversity existing in Australia; the oldest Islamic structure in the [[southern hemisphere]] is the [[Central Adelaide Mosque]] (built in the 1880s),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_2_no2/notes_and_comments/australias_muslim_cameleer_heritage/ |title=reCollections - Australia's Muslim cameleer heritage |publisher=Recollections.nma.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the largest [[Buddhist Temple]]s in the southern hemisphere is [[Wollongong]]'s [[Nan Tien Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nantien.org.au/en/about/history.asp |title=Nan Tien Temple-History of Temple |publisher=Nantien.org.au |date=28 November 1991 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney's gothic design [[Great Synagogue (Sydney)|Great Synagogue]] was consecrated in 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatsynagogue.org.au/ |title=The Great Synagogue Sydney &gt; Home |publisher=Greatsynagogue.org.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, [[Australian pubs]] have also been noted for often distinctive designs.

Significant concern was raised during the 1960s, with developers threatening the destruction of historical buildings, especially in Sydney. Heritage concerns led to union-initiated ''[[green ban]]s'', which saved significant examples of Australia's architectural past. Green bans helped to protect historic 18th century buildings in [[The Rocks, New South Wales|The Rocks]] from being demolished to make way for office towers, and prevented the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Sydney|Royal Botanic Gardens]] from being turned into a car park for the [[Sydney Opera House]].

The visual arts have a long history in Australia and examples of ancient Aboriginal rock artworks can be found throughout the continent - notably in national parks such as those of the [[UNESCO]] listed sites at [[Uluru]] and [[Kakadu National Park]] in the Northern Territory, but also within protected parks in urban areas such as at [[Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park]] in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/kakadu/ |title=Kakadu National Park - Home |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date=7 January 2011 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment.gov.au/parks/uluru/index.html |title=Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park |publisher=Environment.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr7pRhpn | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.auinfo.com/Ku_Ring_Gai_National_park_Sydney.html |title=Ku Ring Gai Chase National Park, Sydney, Australia.

|accessdate=2010-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 1970s, indigenous artists have employed the use of acrylic paints - with styles such as that of the [[Western Desert Art Movement]] becoming globally renounced 20th century art movements.

Following the arrival of permanent European settlement in Australia in 1788, the story of early Australian painting has been described{{By whom|date=September 2010}} as requiring of artists a shift from a &quot;European sense of light&quot; to an &quot;Australian sense of light&quot;. The origins of distinctly Australian painting is often associated with the [[Heidelberg School]] of the 1880s-1890s. Artists such as [[Arthur Streeton]], [[Frederick McCubbin]] and [[Tom Roberts]] applied themselves to recreating in their art a truer sense of light and colour as seen in Australian landscape. Like the European Impressionists, they painted in the open air. These artists found inspiration in the unique light and colour which characterises the [[Australian bush]].

Among the first Australians artists to gain a reputation overseas was the impressionist [[John Peter Russell]] during the 1880s. Another notable expatriate artist of the era was [[Rupert Bunny]], a painter of landscape, allegory and sensual and intimate portraits.

Among the principle Australian artists of the 20th century are the [[surrealist]]s [[Sidney Nolan]], [[Arthur Boyd]] and [[Russell Drysdale]], the [[avant-garde]] [[Brett Whiteley]], the painter/sculptors [[William Dobell]] and [[Norman Lindsay]], the landscapists [[Albert Namatjira]] and [[Lloyd Rees]], the [[modernist]] photographer [[Max Dupain]], and the Aboriginal artist [[Emily Kame Kngwarreye]]. Each has helped to define the unique character of the visual arts in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;painters&quot;/&gt;

The first [[Archibald Prize]] was awarded by the Art Gallery of New South Wales in 1921, to [[WB McInnes]], for his portrait of Desbrowe Annear. This prize for [[portrait painting|portraiture]] of a man or woman &quot;distinguished in the Arts, Letters, Science or Politics&quot;  has grown to be Australia's most popular and prestigious art award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thearchibaldprize.com.au/history/chronology/ |title=Chronology of events &amp;#124; Archibald Prize 2010 |publisher=Thearchibaldprize.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modernism arrived in Australia early in the 20th century. Among the earliest exponents were [[Grace Cossington Smith]] and [[Margaret Preston]]. Artists such as [[Pro Hart]] and [[Ken Done]] contributed to the development of modern, popular style of Australian art - as has painter and performing artist [[Rolf Harris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/rolf-makes-the-queen-look-a-picture/2005/12/19/1134840800380.html |title=Rolf Harris makes the Queen look a picture - World |publisher=theage.com.au |date= 2005-12-20|accessdate=2011-01-29 |location=Melbourne |first1=James |last1=Button}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humorist [[Barry Humphries]] has been a provactive{{Clarify|date=July 2011|reason=pro-active? provocative?}} exponent of [[Dadaism]] in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes; ''The Art of Australia''; Penguin; Revised Edition 1970&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Leunig]] has been an Australian artist who has developed renowned style of poetic cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leunig.com.au/ |title=The Michael Leunig Website |publisher=Leunig.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has a long history of film production.

In 1933, ''[[In the Wake of the Bounty]]'' was directed by [[Charles Chauvel (film maker)|Charles Chauvel]], who cast Tasmanian born [[Erroll Flynn]] as the leading actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/features/wake-bounty/ |title=In the Wake of the Bounty (1933) on ASO - Australia's audio and visual heritage online |publisher=Aso.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flynn went on to a celebrated career in Hollywood. Chauvel directed a number of successful Australian films, the last being 1955's ''[[Jedda]]'', which was notable for being the first Australian film to be shot in colour, and the first to feature Aboriginal actors in lead roles and to be entered at the Cannes Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.festival-cannes.com/en/archives/ficheFilm/id/3702/year/1955.html |title=Festival de Cannes - From 11 to 22&amp;nbsp;may 2011 |publisher=Festival-cannes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until 2006 and [[Rolf De Heer]]'s ''[[Ten Canoes]]'' that a major feature length drama was shot in an indigenous language.

The first Australian Oscar was won by 1942's ''[[Kokoda Front Line!]]'', directed by [[Ken G. Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/kokoda-front-line/ |title=Kokoda Front Line!

During the late 1960s and 1970s an influx of government funding saw the development of a new generation of film makers telling distinctively Australian stories, including directors [[Peter Weir]], [[George Miller (filmmaker)|George Miller]] and [[Bruce Beresford]]. Films such as ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' and ''[[Sunday Too Far Away]]'' had an immediate international impact. The 1980s is often regarded{{By whom|date=October 2010}} as a golden age of Australian cinema, with many successful films, from the historical drama of [[Gallipoli (1981 film)|''Gallipoli'']], to the dark science fiction of ''[[Mad Max]]'', the romantic adventure of ''[[The Man from Snowy River (1982 film)|The Man From Snowy River]]'' or the comedy of ''[[Crocodile Dundee]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wwwmcc.murdoch.edu.au/ReadingRoom/film/Croc.html |title=&quot;Fair Dinkum Fillums&quot;: the Crocodile Dundee Phenomenon |publisher=Cc.murdoch.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major theme of Australian cinema has been survival in the harsh Australian landscape. A number of thrillers and horror films dubbed &quot;outback gothic&quot; have been created, including ''[[Wake in Fright]]'', ''[[Walkabout (film)|Walkabout]]'', ''[[The Cars That Ate Paris]]'' and ''[[Picnic at Hanging Rock (film)|Picnic at Hanging Rock]]'' in the 1970s, ''[[Razorback (film)|Razorback]]'' and ''[[Shame (1988 film)|Shame]]'' in the 1980s, and ''[[Japanese Story]]'', ''[[The Proposition]]'' &quot;[[Van Diemen's Land (film)|Van Diemen's Land]] and the world-renowned ''[[Wolf Creek (film)|Wolf Creek]]'' in the 21st century. These films depict the Australian bush and its creatures as deadly, and its people as outcasts and psychopaths. These concepts are combined with futuristic post-apocalyptic themes in the [[Mad Max (franchise)|Mad Max series]].

The 1990s saw a run of successful comedies such as ''[[Muriel's Wedding]]'', ''[[The Castle (film)|The Castle]]'' and ''[[Strictly Ballroom]]'', which helped launch the careers of [[Toni Collette]], [[P. J. Hogan]], [[Eric Bana]] and [[Baz Luhrmann]]. [[Australian humour]] features prominently in Australian film, with a strong tradition of self-mockery, from the ''[[Ozploitation]]'' style of the  [[Barry McKenzie]] ''expat-in-Europe'' movies of the 1970s, to the quirky outback characters of the ''Crocodile Dundee'' films and the [[Working Dog Productions]]' 1997 homage to suburbia ''The Castle''. Comedies like the barn yard animation ''[[Babe (film)|Babe]]'' (1995), directed by [[Chris Noonan]]; Baz Lurhmann's ''Strictly Ballroom'' (1992); [[Rob Sitch]]'s ''[[The Dish]]'' (2000); and [[Stephan Elliott]]'s [[The Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert]] (1994) all feature in the top ten box-office list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.australiamovie.net/2009/02/second-highest-grossing-australian-film-of-all-time/&lt;/ref&gt;  

During the 1990s, a new crop of Australian stars were successful in Hollywood, including [[Russel Crowe]], [[Cate Blanchett]] and [[Heath Ledger]] who all rose to international prominence and critical acclaim.

The domestic film industry is also supported by US producers who produce in Australia following the decision by Fox head [[Rupert Murdoch]] to utilise new studios in Melbourne and Sydney where filming could be completed well below US costs. Notable productions include ''[[The Matrix]]'', ''[[Star Wars]]'' episodes [[Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones|II]] and [[Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith|III]], and ''[[Australia (2008 film)|Australia]]'' starring [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Hugh Jackman]].

{{Main|Indigenous Australian music}}

Aboriginal song was an integral part of Aboriginal culture. The most famous feature of their music is the [[didgeridoo]]. This wooden instrument, used amongst the Aboriginal tribes of northern Australia, makes a distinctive droning sound and its use has been adopted by a wide variety of non-Aboriginal performers.

Aboriginal musicians have turned their hand to Western popular musical forms, often to considerable commercial success. Pioneers included [[Lionel Rose]], and [[Jimmy Little]], while notable contemporary examples include [[Archie Roach]], the [[Warumpi Band]], [[NoKTuRNL]] and [[Yothu Yindi]]. [[Geoffrey Gurrumul Yunupingu]] (formerly of Yothu Yindi) has attained international success singing contemporary music in English and in the language of the [[Yolngu]]. [[Christine Anu]] is a successful [[Torres Strait Islander]] singer.

[[Australian country music]] has been popular among indigenous communities, with performers including [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] rising to national prominence.

Amongst young Australian aborigines, [[African American|African-American]] and Aboriginal [[hip hop]] music and clothing is popular.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Folk music and national songs====
[[File:The Old Bush Songs by Banio Paterson.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Cover to [[Banjo Paterson]]'s seminal 1905 collection of [[bush ballad]]s, entitled ''Old Bush Songs''.]]

The early [[Anglo-Celtic]] immigrants of the 18th and 19th centuries introduced folk ballad traditions which were adapted to Australian themes: &quot;[[Botany Bay (song)|Bound for Botany Bay]]&quot; tells of the voyage of British convicts to Sydney, &quot;[[The Wild Colonial Boy]]&quot; evokes the spirit of the [[bushranger]]s, and &quot;[[Click Go the Shears]]&quot; speaks of the life of Australian shearers. The lyrics of Australia's best known folk song, &quot;[[Waltzing Matilda]]&quot;, were written by the bush poet [[Banjo Paterson]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/05/05/2235263.htm |title=Waltzing Maltida a little ditty, historians say - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=5 May 2008 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adopted by Australian soldiers during [[World War I]], this song remains popular and is often sung at sporting events, including the closure of the [[Sydney Olympics]] in 2000, by [[Australian country music]] singer [[Slim Dusty]].

Other well known singers of Australian folk music include [[Rolf Harris]] (who wrote &quot;[[Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport]]&quot;), [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]], and [[Eric Bogle]] whose 1972 song &quot;[[And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda]]&quot; is a sorrowful lament to the [[Gallipoli Campaign]]. [[Bush dance]] is a traditional style of dance from Australia with strong Celtic roots, and influenced [[country music]]. It is generally accompanied by such instruments as the [[fiddle]], [[accordeon]], [[concertina]] and [[percussion instruments]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.hiwaay.net/~lkseitz/Australia/bushdance.html |title=How to Do a Bush Dance |publisher=Home.hiwaay.net |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; A well known Bush band is [[The Bushwackers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=info@thebushwackers.com.au |url=http://www.thebushwackers.com.au/ |title=The Bushwackers |publisher=The Bushwackers |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[national anthem]] of Australia is &quot;[[Advance Australia Fair]]&quot;:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;
:Australians all let us rejoice,
:For we are young and free;
:We've golden soil and wealth for toil,
:Our home is girt by sea;

:Of beauty rich and rare;
:In history's page, let every stage
:Advance Australia fair!
:In joyful strains then let us sing,
:Advance Australia fair!
&lt;/div&gt;

Unofficial pop music anthems of Australia include [[Peter Allen]]'s &quot;[[I Still Call Australia Home]]&quot;, [[Men at Work]]'s &quot;[[Down Under (song)|Down Under]]&quot;, and [[Icehouse (band)|Icehouse]]'s &quot;[[Great Southern Land]].{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

International bawdy classics such as &quot;[[Eskimo Nell]]&quot; and &quot;Charlotte the Harlot&quot; can be heard at gatherings around the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seal 1989 50&quot;/&gt;

====Classical music====
[[File:Nellie Melba by Henry Walter Barnett.jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Dame [[Nellie Melba]] (1861-1931).]]
[[File:Joan Sutherland .jpg|thumb|upright|150px|Dame [[Joan Sutherland]] in 1990]]

The earliest Western musical influences in Australia can be traced back to two distinct sources: the first free settlers who brought with them the European classical music tradition, and the large body of convicts and sailors, who brought the traditional folk music of England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales.  The practicalities of building a colony mean that there is very little music extant from this early period although there are samples of music originating from [[Hobart]] and Sydney that date back to the early 19th century.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;&gt;Oxford, A Dictionary of Australian Music, Edited by Warren Bebbington, Copyright 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nellie Melba]] (1861â1931) travelled to Europe in 1886 to commence her international career as an opera singer. She became among the best know Australians of the period and participated in early gramophone recording and radio broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A100464b.htm |title=Melba, Dame Nellie (1861 - 1931) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online |publisher=Adb.online.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The establishment of choral societies (c. 1850) and symphony orchestras (c. 1890) led to increased compositional activity, although many Australian classical composers attempted to work entirely within European models. A lot of works leading up to the first part of the 20th century were heavily influenced by the folk music of other countries ([[Percy Grainger]]âs ''[[Country Gardens]]'' of 1918 being a good example of this) and a very conservative British orchestral tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt;

In the war and post-war eras, as pressure built to assert a national identity in the face of the looming superpower of the United States and the &quot;[[Metropole|motherland]]&quot; [[United Kingdom|Britain]], composers looked to their surroundings for inspiration. John Antill&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.australianmusiccentre.com.au/artist/antill-john |title=John Antill : Represented Artist Profile |publisher=Australian Music Centre |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Sculthorpe]] began to incorporate elements of Aboriginal music, and [[Richard Meale]] drew influence from [[south-east Asia]] (notably using the harmonic properties of the [[Balinese people|Balinese]] [[Gamelan]], as had Percy Grainger in an earlier generation).&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; [[Nigel Butterley]] combined his penchant for international modernism with an own individual voice.

By the beginning of the 1960s, Australian classical music erupted with influences, with composers incorporating disparate elements into their work, ranging from Aboriginal and south-east Asian music and instruments, to American [[jazz]] and [[blues]], to the belated discovery of European atonality and the [[avant-garde]]. Composers like [[Don Banks]], [[Don Kay (composer)|Don Kay]], [[Malcolm Williamson]] and [[Colin Brumby]] epitomise this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Oxford&quot;/&gt; In recent times composers including [[Liza Lim]], [[Nigel Westlake]], [[Ross Edwards]], [[Graeme Koehne]], [[Georges Lentz]], [[Elena Kats-Chernin]], [[Richard Mills]], [[Brett Dean]] and [[Carl Vine]] have embodied the pinnacle of established [[List of Australian composers|Australian composers]].

Well-known Australian classical performers include: sopranos [[Joan Sutherland|Dame Joan Sutherland]], Dame [[Joan Hammond]], [[Joan Carden]], [[Yvonne Kenny]], [[Sara Macliver]] and [[Emma Matthews]]; pianists [[Roger Woodward]], [[Eileen Joyce]], [[Michael Kieran Harvey]], [[Geoffrey Tozer]], [[Geoffrey Douglas Madge]], [[Leslie Howard (musician)|Leslie Howard]] and [[Ian Munro (pianist)|Ian Munro]]; guitarists [[John Williams (guitarist)|John Williams]] and [[Slava Grigoryan]]; horn player [[Barry Tuckwell]]; oboist [[Diana Doherty]]; violinists [[Richard Tognetti]] and [[Elizabeth Wallfisch]]; cellists [[John Addison (cellist)|John Addison]] and [[David Pereira]]; organist [[Christopher Wrench]]; orchestras like the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Melbourne Symphony Orchestra]], the [[Australian Chamber Orchestra]] and the [[Australian Brandenburg Orchestra]]; and conductors Sir [[Bernard Heinze]], Sir [[Charles Mackerras]], [[Richard Bonynge]], [[Simone Young]] and [[Geoffrey Simon]]. Indigenous performers like [[didgeridoo]] player [[William Barton (musician)|William Barton]] and immigrant musicians like Egyptian-born [[oud]] virtuoso [[Joseph Tawadros]] have stimulated interest in their own music traditions and have also collaborated with other musicians and ensembles both in Australia and internationally.

====Pop and rock====

{{Main|Australian rock}}

Australia has produced a large variety of popular music from the internationally renowned work of the [[Bee Gees]], [[AC/DC]], [[INXS]], [[Nick Cave]] or [[Kylie Minogue]] to the popular local content of [[John Farnham]] or [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/music/pop/ |title=Australian pop music - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the brightest stars of early Australian [[rock and roll]] was [[Johnny O'Keefe]], who formed a band in 1956; his hit ''Wild One'' made him the first Australian rock'n'roller to reach the national charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A150610b.htm |title=O'Keefe, John Michael (Johnny) (1935 - 1978) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online |publisher=Adb.online.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While US and British content dominated airwaves and record sales into the 1960s, local successes began to emerge â notably [[The Easybeats]] and the folk-pop group [[The Seekers]] had significant local success and some international recognition, while the bands the [[Bee Gees]] and [[AC/DC]] had their first hits in Australia before going on to international success.

The arrival of the 1961 underground movement into the mainstream in the early 1970s changed Australian music permanently. [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] were far from the first people to write songs in Australia by Australians about Australia, but they were the first ones to make good money doing it. The two best-selling Australian albums made up to that time put Australian music on the map. Within a few years, the novelty had worn off and it became commonplace to hear distinctively Australian lyrics and sounds side-by-side with imports{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}.

During the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s Australian performers continued to do well on the local and international music scenes, for example [[Cold Chisel]], [[INXS]], [[Men at Work]] and [[Kylie Minogue]], [[Dannii Minogue]], [[Natalie Imbruglia]], [[Savage Garden]] and [[Silverchair]]. Bands such as [[Jet (band)|Jet]], [[Wolfmother]], [[Eskimo Joe]], [[Grinspoon]], [[The Vines]], [[The Living End]], [[Pendulum (band)|Pendulum]] and [[Delta Goodrem]] have enjoyed success worldwide.

Domestically, [[John Farnham]] has remained one of Australia's best-known performers, with a career spanning over 40 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;McF&quot;&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]|last=McFarlane|first=Ian|authorlink=Ian McFarlane|publisher=[[Allen &amp; Unwin]]|location=[[St Leonards, New South Wales|St Leonards, NSW]]|year=1999|chapter=Encyclopedia entry for 'RenÃ©e Geyer'|chapterurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20040803174326/www.whammo.com.au/encyclopedia.asp?articleid=829|isbn=1864487682|accessdate=2009-05-07}}{{Failed verification|date=October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singer-songwriter [[Paul Kelly (musician)|Paul Kelly]] whose music style straddles folk, rock, and country has been described{{By whom|date=October 2010}} as the ''poet laureate'' of Australian music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.civicsandcitizenship.edu.au/cce/default.asp?id=15390 |title=Civics &amp;#124; Paul Kelly (1955â) |publisher=Civicsandcitizenship.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5yWGgEmZH | archivedate = 2011-05-08| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The national expansion of [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] youth radio station [[Triple J]] during the 1990s has increased the profile and availability of home-grown talent to listeners nationwide. Since the mid 1990s a string of successful alternative Australian acts have emerged; artists to achieve both underground (critical) and mainstream (commercial) success include [[You Am I]], [[Grinspoon]], [[Powderfinger]] and [[Jet (band)|Jet]].

{{Main|Australian country music}}

Australia has a long tradition of [[country music]], which has developed a style quite distinct from its US counterpart, influenced by Celtic folk ballads and the traditions of Australian bush balladeers like [[Henry Lawson]] and [[Banjo Paterson]]. Pioneers of popular country music in Australia included [[Tex Morton]] in the 1930s and [[Smoky Dawson]] from the 1940s onward. [[Slim Dusty]] (1927â2003) was known as the ''King of Australian Country Music''. His successful career spanned almost six decades and his 1957 hit &quot;[[A Pub With No Beer]]&quot;
was the biggest-selling record by an Australian to that time, the first Australian single to go [[Music recording sales certification|gold]], and the first and only 78 rpm record to be awarded a gold disc.&lt;ref&gt;Dave&quot; Laing, [http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2003/sep/20/guardianobituaries.artsobituaries &quot;Slim Dusty: Country singer famous for A Pub With No Beer&quot;], ''The Guardian (UK)'', 20 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty recorded and released his one-hundredth album in the year 2000 and was given the honour of singing ''[[Waltzing Matilda]]'' in the closing ceremony of the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympic Games]]. Dusty's wife [[Joy McKean]] penned several of his most popular songs.

Other popular performers of Australian country music include: [[John Williamson (singer)|John Williamson]] (who wrote the iconic song &quot;[[True Blue (John Williamson song)|True Blue]]&quot;), [[Lee Kernaghan]], [[Adam Brand]], [[Kasey Chambers]] and [[Sara Storer]]. In the United States, Australian country music stars including [[Olivia Newton John]] and [[Keith Urban]] have attained great success.

Country music has also been a particularly popular form of musical expression among the [[Australia]]n [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] peoples. [[Troy Cassar-Daley]] is among Australia's successful indigenous performers.

The [[Tamworth Country Music Festival]] is an annual country music festival held in [[Tamworth, New South Wales]]. It celebrates the culture and heritage of [[Australian country music]]. During the festival the [[Country Music Association of Australia]] holds the [[Country Music Awards of Australia]] ceremony awarding the [[Golden Guitar]] trophies.

{{Main|Television in Australia}}

Experiments with television began in Australia in the 1930s and television was officially launched on 16 September 1956, in Sydney.&lt;ref&gt;{{en}} http://www.news.com.au/couriermail/extras/federation/Timelines/CMFedTimelineNat3.htm {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en}} http://www.news.com.au/entertainment/story/0,23663,20357015-5007183,00.html&lt;/ref&gt; Colour TV arrived in 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{en}} http://www.televisionau.com/seventies.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Logie Awards]] are the major annual awards for Australian TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Logie_Awards/ Logie Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;

While US and British television is popular in Australia, locally produced content has had many successes. Successful local product has included ''[[Homicide (Australian TV series)|Homicide]]'' and ''[[Division 4]]'' in the late 1960s and early 1970s, ''[[Skippy the Bush Kangaroo]]'' in the late 1960s, ''[[Number 96 (TV series)|Number 96]]'' and ''[[The Box (soap opera)|The Box]]'' in the 1970s, ''[[Prisoner (TV series)|Prisoner]]'' in the 1980s and ''[[A Country Practice]]'' (1981â1993), ''[[Neighbours]]'' and ''[[Home and Away]]'' in the 1980s and 1990s. Many of the shows from the mid 1980s onwards have been exported and have sometimes been even more successful abroad, such as [[Steve Irwin]]'s ''[[The Crocodile Hunter]]''. Popular stars of Australian TV have included: the pioneer variety show hosts [[Graham Kennedy]], [[Bert Newton]], [[Don Lane]] and [[Daryl Somers]], and contemporary talk show hosts [[Andrew Denton]] and [[Rove McManus]]. Popular international exports have included: [[Dame Edna Everage]], [[Clive James]], [[Geoffrey Robertson]] and [[The Wiggles]].

While Australia has ubiquitous media coverage, the longest established part of that media is the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] (ABC), the Federal Government owned and funded organisation offering national TV and radio coverage. The ABC, like the BBC in Britain, CBC in Canada, and PBS in the United States, is a non-commercial public service broadcaster, showing many [[BBC]] or [[ITV]] productions from Britain.

Commercial broadcasters include the [[Seven Network]], the [[Nine Network]] and [[Network Ten]] on [[free-to-air]] broadcasting to the larger cities with affiliated regional networks like [[Prime Television]] and [[Win Television]] broadcasting to regional areas. [[Foxtel]], [[Austar]] and [[Optus Television]] have been the main providers of pay TV. [[Fox8|Fox 8]] and [[Sky News Australia]] are among the popular Pay TV channels. The [[Australia Network]], established in 2001, is Australia's international television service, beaming to more than 44 countries across Asia, the Pacific and the Indian subcontinent.

The publicly funded [[Special Broadcasting Service]] (SBS) has a multicultural focus, broadcasting TV and radio programmes in a variety of languages, as well as world news and documentary programming in English. It mixes highbrow programming along with popular non-English language television series broadcast in their original language, such as ''[[Inspector Rex]]'', ''[[Rex in Rome]]'', ''[[Don Matteo]]''. It also shows more controversial programs such as ''[[South Park]]'', ''[[Queer as Folk (North American TV series)|Queer as Folk]]'', and ''[[Oz (TV series)|Oz]]'' that would not be shown on Australian free-to-air TV otherwise. Less mainstream sports such as [[football (soccer)]] and [[cycling]] receive coverage.  SBS commenced as a commercial-free enterprise, but it has broadcast commercials of recent years{{When|date=October 2010}}, to less than universal approval.

In the 1990s and first decade of the 21st century, Australia's two publicly-funded national networks, ABC and SBS, received an increasing share of market ratings, although as of 2005 they only accounted for 15.7% and 6.1% of the national ratings, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.afc.gov.au/gtp/wftvratingsnetwork.html Get the Picture - Free-to-air TV - Ratings - By network]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ABC has made a significant contribution to television drama with popular series like ''[[Brides of Christ (TV miniseries)|Brides of Christ]]'', and to comedy with the 1970s hits ''[[Aunty Jack]]'' and ''[[The Norman Gunston Show]]'' and more recently [[Roy &amp; HG]], ''[[Kath &amp; Kim]]'' and ''[[The Chaser's War On Everything]]''. Debate about the role of the ABC continues; many assign it a marginal role, as commercial TV and radio stations are far more popular choices. Critics{{Who|date=December 2009}} claim that Australian children view television programs imported largely from the USA, however, the Australian Content Standard&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aba.gov.au/contentreg/codes/television/documents/ACS2004Fulltext.pdf {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; requires all free-to-air commercial networks to broadcast an annual minimum of 55% Australian content (between 6&amp;nbsp;a.m. and midnight). American dramas and comedies rate well on Australian TV. While Australian soap operas have found huge success in Britain, British comedies have been consistently popular in Australia, with programs such as ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'', ''[[The Goodies]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'' and ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' appealing to the Australian sense of humour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Smh.com.au&quot;/&gt;

Australia has no official state religion and Section 116 of the [[Australian Constitution]] prohibits the Commonwealth government from [[established church|establishing a church]] or interfering with the [[freedom of religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/senate/general/constitution/chapter5.htm |title=Parliament of Australia: Senate: Constitution - Chapter 5 |publisher=Aph.gov.au |date=21 May 2003 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 2006 [[Australian Census]], 63.9% of Australians were listed as [[Christian]]. Historically, this proportion has been higher and a growing proportion of the population define themselves as [[Irreligion in Australia|irreligious]], with 18.7% of Australians declaring 'no-religion' on the census. There are also growing communities of various other religions in Australia and 11.2% of people did not answer the question on the census.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/facts/religion.html |title=About Australia: Religious Freedom |publisher=Dfat.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the roughly 64% identifying as Christian, the largest proportions were either [[Roman Catholicism in Australia|Roman Catholic]] (25.8%) or [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] (18.7%), with the third largest group being the 5.7% affiliated with the [[Uniting Church in Australia|Uniting Church]]. Most other major religious faiths are also practised in Australia, reflecting the cultural diversity of the nation.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

At the time of Federation in 1901, 97% of Australians professed to be Christians and Christianity has had an enduring impact on Australia. The Anglican Church (formerly known as the [[Church of England]]) remained the largest denomination until 1986, when it was surpassed by the Roman Catholic Church. Australian Catholics were predominantly of Irish origin until the post-world war two immigration program brought more than a million Catholics from Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Germany, Croatia, Hungary and elswhere. The Christian festivals of [[Christmas]] and [[Easter]] are national public holidays in Australia and Christian charitable organisations, hospitals and schools have played a prominent role in welfare and education since colonial times. In 2008, 697 000 Australian children (20% of total students) attended [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] schools,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.webcitation.org/5qvDapIMe WebCite query result]&lt;/ref&gt; and 750 000 attended church affiliated schools more generally (some of these being independent Catholic schools). Christian organisations such as the [[Society of Saint Vincent de Paul|St. Vincent de Paul Society]], the [[Salvation Army]] and [[Anglicare]] povide high profile social services throughout Australia. Christians have played a prominent role in Australian history and two Christian preachers feature on the [[Australian dollar|Australian currency]]: [[David Unaipon]], an Aboriginal writer and the Reverend [[John Flynn (minister)|John Flynn]] who founded the [[Royal Flying Doctor Service]]. [[Mary MacKillop]], who co-founded an order of nuns in the 19th century, called the [[Sisters of St Joseph of the Sacred Heart|Sisters of St. Joseph]], became the first Australian canonised saint of the Catholic Church in October 2010 and Sir [[Douglas Nicholls]], a preacher and Aboriginal rights activist was the first indigenous Australian to be appointed Governor of an Australian State. Some Australian Prime Ministers in recent times have identified as religious, others as non-religious, and the [[separation of church and state]] is enshrined in Australian law and acknowledged as important in greater society.

The proportion of the total population who are Christian fell from 71% in 1996 to around 64% in 2006, while people affiliated with non-Christian religions increased from around 3.5% to 5.6% over the same period. [[Buddhism]] increased most rapidly from 1.1% to 2.1%. Increased immigration from South-East Asia has been a major factor in this growth, but Australians of Anglo-Celtic origin have also shown increasing interest in Buddhism. [[Islam]] increased during the period from 1.1% to 1.7% with diverse communities concentrated mainly in Sydney and Melbourne. The [[history of the Jews in Australia]] dates back to 1788 and the [[Jew]]ish [[convict]]s brought to Sydney aboard the [[First Fleet]]. Today, an estimated 120,000 Jews reside in [[Australia]], many of them originating as [[refugee]]s and [[Holocaust survivor]]s who arrived during and after [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jewishvirtuallibrary.org&quot;&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/australia.html The Virtual Jewish History Tour: Australia]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hindus]] came to Australia as labourers and merchants during the 19th century and numbers increased dramatically from the 1960s, more than doubling between 1996 and 2006 to reach 148 000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

The tradition and spirituality of [[Aboriginal Australians]] places great emphasis, as with every religious tradition, on the role of tribal Elders in passing down stories of the [[Dreaming (spirituality)|Dreaming]], and skills and lessons for survival (such as hunting and [[Aboriginal tracker|tracking]]). The creation story  and belief system of the Aboriginal tradition, known in English as the ''[[Dreamtime]]'', reverences the land and the animals and spirits that inhabit that land. European settlement introduced Indigenous Australians to Christianity, especially through 'missions'. There was a wide range of experiences of the 'missions' by Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name=&quot;dfat.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

==Public holidays==
[[File:RAS Grand Parade 2001 composite.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Grand Parade of the [[Sydney Royal Easter Show]]. Easter is an extended public holiday in Australia accompanied by many public events.]]

Australia's calendar of public holiday festivals begins with [[New Year's Day]], the first of January. This is also the day upon which the Australian Federation officially came in to being, however the national day, [[Australia Day]], is celebrated on 26 January, which was the date of the official foundation of the first British colony at Sydney in 1788, an important beginning in modern Australian immigrant history. [[Anzac Day]], 25 April is another day strongly associated with Australian nationhood, however it more particularly commemorates Australians who fought in wars and is named to honour the soldiers of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps who landed at Gallipoli, on that same day in 1915, during the [[First World War]].

The Christian festivals of [[Easter]] and [[Christmas]] are public holidays in Australia. Christmas Day, 25 December, falls during the [[Southern Hemisphere]] summer.

[[Labour Day]] is also a public holiday, but on different days throughout the nation. The [[Queen's Birthday]] is generally observed on the second Monday in June, except in Western Australia, where it usually observed in September or October to move it away from [[Foundation Day (Western Australia)|Foundation Day]]. On the Queen's Birthday holiday, as on Australia Day, national awards are distributed to distinguished citizens for services to the community.

{{Main|Australian cuisine}}

Contemporary Australian cuisine combines British and indigenous origins with Mediterranean and Asian influences. Australia's abundant natural resources allow access to a large variety of quality meats, and to barbecue beef or lamb in the open air is considered a cherished national tradition. The great majority of Australians live close to the sea and Australian seafood restaurants have been listed among the world's best.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theworlds50best.com/module/acms_winners?group_id=1 |title=The Top 50 Best Restaurants 1-50 &amp;#124; The Worldâs 50 Best Restaurants |publisher=Theworlds50best.com |date=15 February 2010 |accessdate=2011-01-29}} {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bush tucker]] is an Australian term used to describe the traditional diets of [[indigenous Australians]]. Much of this food may be considered as having been uniquely Australian - from such food items as [[macadamia nuts]] to [[kangaroo]] meat (which is undergoing a renaissance of interest on contemporary Australian menus). A popular modern exponent of bush tucker has been television personality [[Les Hiddins]], known as ''The Bush Tucker Man''.

Early British settlers brought familiar meats and crops with them from Europe and these remain important in the Australian diet. The British settlers found some familiar game - such as [[swan]], [[goose]], [[pigeon]] and fish - but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of [[Australian fauna|native fauna]] as a staple diet.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture.gov.au&quot;/&gt; They established agricultural industries producing more familiar [[Western culture|Western]] style produce. [[Queensland]] and [[New South Wales]] became Australia's main [[beef cattle]] producers, while  [[dairy cattle]] farming is found in the southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. [[Sugar cane]] is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/farms/ Australian farms and farming communities - australia.gov.au]&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[Meat and three veg]]&quot;, [[fish and chips]] and the [[Australian meat pie]] continue to represent traditional meals for many Australians. The post-[[World War II]] multicultural immigration program brought new flavours and influences, with waves of immigrants from Greece, Italy, Vietnam, China and elsewhere bringing about diversification of the typical diet consumed.

Australia's 11 million square kilometre fishing zone is the third largest in the world and allows for easy access to seafood which significantly influences Australian cuisine. Clean ocean environments produce high quality seafoods. [[Lobsters]], [[prawn]], [[tuna]], [[salmon]] and [[abalone]] are the main ocean species harvested commercially, while [[aquaculture]] produces more than 60 species for consumption, including [[oysters]], [[salmonoids]], [[southern bluefin tuna]], [[mussels]], [[prawns]], [[barramundi]], [[yellowtail kingfish]], and [[Freshwater fish of Australia|freshwater finifish]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dfat.gov.au/facts/seafoodindustry.html About Australia: The Australian seafood industry]&lt;/ref&gt; While inland river and lake systems are relatively sparse, they nevertheless provide some unique fresh water game fish and crustacea suitable for dining. Fishing and aquaculture constitute Australia's fifth most valuable agricultural industry after [[wool]], [[beef]], [[wheat]] and [[dairy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.daff.gov.au/fisheries Fisheries Home - DAFF]&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 600 varieties of marine and freshwater seafood species are caught and sold for both local and overseas consumption.  Popular seafoods of local origin include barramundi, [[flathead (fish)|flathead]], and the [[balmain bug]], while the popularity of Australian [[prawns]] led to a successful tourism campaign in the 1980s in which actor/comedian [[Paul Hogan]] invited Americans to come to Australia where he would &quot;throw a shrimp on the barbie for ya&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atme.org/pubs/archives/77_1898_11926.cfm |title=Come and Say GâDay! |publisher=Atme.org |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vegemite]] is a well-known spread originating from Australia, though currently produced by the US-owned food company [[Kraft Foods]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hildebrand | first = Joe | title = Old recipe jarred with new Mites | work = Daily Telegraph | date = 2009-10-02 | page = 15 | url = http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/the-real-reason-for-the-isnack-20-the-original-vegemites-falling-sales-among-migrants/story-e6freuy9-1225781813838 | accessdate = 2009-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Iconic Australian desserts include [[Pavlova (food)|pavlova]] and [[lamingtons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://abc.net.au/gnt/history/Transcripts/s1188249.htm Pavlova]&lt;/ref&gt; [[ANZAC biscuits]] recall the diet of Australia's [[World War I]] soldiers at the [[Battle of Gallipoli]].

Australia's reputation as a nation of heavy drinkers goes back to the earliest days of colonial Sydney, when [[Rum corps|rum was used as currency]] and grain shortages followed the installation of the first stills.

''[[Billy tea]]'' is the drink prepared by the ill-fated [[swagman]] in the popular Australian folksong [[Waltzing Matilda]]. Boiling water for tea over a camp fire and adding a gum leaf for flavouring remains an iconic traditional Australian method for preparing tea, which was a staple drink of the [[Australian history|Australian colonial period]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultureandrecreation.gov.au/ Australia's Culture Portal]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Australian Wine]] Industry is the fourth largest exporter of wine around the world and contributes $5.5 billion per annum to the nation's economy. In the early 21st century, Australians consume nearly 500 million litres of wine per year. Wine is produced in every state, however wine regions are mainly in the southern, cooler regions. Amongst the most famous wine districts are the [[Hunter Valley]] and [[Barossa Valley]] and among the best known wine producers are [[Penfolds]], [[Rosemount (wine)|Rosemount Estate]], [[Wynns Coonawarra Estate]] and [[Lindemans (wine)|Lindemans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/wine/ |title=Australia's wine industry - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Beer in Australia]] has been popular since colonial times. [[James Squires]] is considered to have founded Australia's first commercial brewery in 1798 and the [[Cascade Brewery]] in [[Hobart, Tasmania]] has been operating since the early 19th century. Since the 1970s, Australian beers have become increasingly popular globally - with [[Foster's Lager]] being an iconic export brand. Fosters is not however the biggest seller on the local market, with alternatives including [[Victoria Bitter]] outselling the popular export.

Australia has no official designated [[national dress]], but iconic local styles include ''bushwear''  and ''surfwear''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/fashion/nationaldress/ |title=Australian national dress - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australian designers and models also feature at international creative glamour fashion industry gatherings. The country's best-known fashion event is [[Australian Fashion Week]], a twice yearly industry gathering showcasing the latest seasonal collections from Australian and Asia Pacific Designers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/fashion/aussie-fashion-hits-new-york/2006/08/27/1156617212361.html |title=Aussie fashion hits New York - Fashion - Entertainment |publisher=smh.com.au |date= 2006-08-28|accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top Australian models include [[Elle McPherson]], [[Lara Bingle]] and [[Jennifer Hawkins]] ([[Miss Universe 2004]]).

Major examples of clothing brands associated with bushwear are the broad brimmed [[Akubra]] hats and [[R.M. Williams]] bushmen's outfitters (featuring in particular: [[moleskin]] trousers, [[riding boots]] and [[merino]] woolwear). [[Blundstone Footwear]] and [[Country Road]] are also linked to this tradition. The [[cork hat]] is a type of headgear strongly associated with Australia, and comprises [[Cork (material)|cork]] strung from the brim, to ward off insects. It is traditionally worn by [[Jackaroo (trainee)|jackaroos]] and [[swagman|swagmen]] in the [[blow-fly]] infested Australian [[outback]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/comedy/ Australian comedy], Australian Government culture and recreation portal.

Medal presenters during the 2000 Summer Olympic Games also wore Driza-Bone coats.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Man from Snowy River: Arena Spectacular]] â Theatre Programme&lt;/ref&gt;

Famous surfwear labels include [[Billabong (clothing)|Billabong]], [[Rip Curl]], [[Mambo Graphics|Mambo]] and [[Quiksilver]], which are sold and recognised around the world.

[[Ugg boots]] are unisex sheepskin boots, made of twin-faced sheepskin with fleece on the inside and with a tanned outer surface, often with a synthetic sole which were first developed in Australia or New Zealand. Traditionally worn for comfort and favoured by the working classes in Australia, since 2000 the boot style has experienced a world-wide growth in popularity as fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=By Alyssa Abkowitz, reporter |url=http://money.cnn.com/2009/08/18/pf/deckers_uggs_boots.fortune/index.htm |title=Investor Daily: Deckers finds its footing with Uggs - Aug.&amp;nbsp;19, 2009 |publisher=Money.cnn.com |date=19 August 2009 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[slouch hat]] was first worn by military forces in Australia in 1885, looped up on one side so that rifles could be held at the slope without damaging the brim. After federation, the slouch hat became standard Australian Army headgear in 1903 and since then it has developed into an important national symbol and is worn on ceremonial occasions by the Australian army.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, Peter, Grey, Jeffrey, Morris, Ewan, Prior, Robin.

[[File:Aussie rules wikipedia.jpg|thumb|[[Australian rules football]] at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|MCG]]]]

Many Australians are passionate about sport, and it forms a major part of the country's culture, particularly in terms of spectating, but also in terms of participation. Cricket is popular in the summer and [[football]] codes are popular in the winter, with different codes being more popular in [[Barassi Line|different areas]]. Some strong Australian traditions, such as [[grand final]]s and [[footy tipping]] are shared across all codes.

The sporting successes of Australians at elite levels in such events as the [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] and [[Commonwealth Games]], World Cup competitions in [[cricket]], [[rugby union]], [[rugby league]], [[field hockey]], [[netball]], and major tournaments in [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[surfing]] and other sports are a source of great pride for many people in Australia. Leading sportspeople such as [[Don Bradman]], [[Dawn Fraser]] and [[Cathy Freeman]] last in the cultural memory of Australia for decades and are accorded high civilian honours and public status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/sportinggreats/ |title=Sporting greats - Stories from Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Cultureandrecreation.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australian rules football===
{{Main|Australian rules football in Australia}}
[[Australian rules football]] (usually called &quot;Aussie rules&quot;, &quot;AFL&quot; or &quot;footy&quot;) is a popular spectator sport and a participation sport in all Australian states and territories, though its core support lies in four of the six states; [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]], [[Western Australia]] and [[Tasmania]]. The national competition, the [[Australian Football League]], evolved from a Victorian state competition and is in the process of expanding from 16 to 18 teams from all states except Tasmania.  The [[AFL Grand Final]] is traditionally played each year at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]]. [[Australian rules football culture]] has a strong set of rituals and traditions, many of which have crossed sporting boundaries in Australia. Traditional variations such as [[kick-to-kick]] are important aspects of the sporting culture, as is vocal support for a team, known as barracking.

===Cricket===
[[File:MCG-1864.JPG|thumb|Cricket being played at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] in the 1860s.]]

{{Main|Cricket in Australia}}

Cricket has been among the most popular sports in Australia since colonial times. The game is played during the summer months at a local, state and international level, with international matches drawing large crowds. It is featured and followed in all states and territories, unlike the football codes whose [[Barassi Line|popularity varies dramatically between regions]]. A census conducted on behalf of [[Cricket Australia]] found that in the 2003-04 season there were 471,329 male participants in Australian cricket programs and competitions, and 47,780 female participants.

The first recorded cricket match in Australia took place in Sydney in 1803. [[Intercolonial cricket in Australia]] started in 1851&lt;ref name=PictorialHistory&gt;{{cite book |last=Pollard |first= Jack|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=The Pictorial History of Australian Cricket (revised edition)|year=1986 |publisher= J.M Dent Pty Ltd &amp; Australian Broadcasting Corporation|location=Boronia |isbn=0867799432}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sheffield Shield]] inter-state cricket continues to this day. The 1876-77 season was notable for a match between a combined [[11 (number)#In sports|XI]] from New South Wales and Victoria and the touring Englishmen at the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]], which was later recognised as the first [[Test cricket|Test Match]].&lt;ref name=CricketColosseum&gt;{{cite book |last=Piesse |first= Ken|authorlink=Ken Piesse |coauthors= |title=Cricket Colosseum:125 Years of Test Cricket at the MCG|year=2003 |publisher= Hardie Grant|location=South Yarra|isbn=978-1-74066-064-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; A famous victory on the 1882 tour of England resulted in the placement of a satirical [[obituary]] in an English newspaper saying that English cricket had &quot;died&quot;, and the ''body will be cremated and the ashes taken to Australia''. The English media then dubbed the next English tour to Australia (1882â83) as the quest to &quot;regain the ashes&quot;.&lt;ref name=AshesAnthology&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold|first= Peter|authorlink= |coauthors=Wynne-Thomas, Peter |title=An Ashes Anthology:England v.

Successful cricket players become major and often long lasting celebrities in Australia. Sir [[Donald Bradman]], who made his Test debut in the 1928-29 series against England, remains a household name as the greatest batsman the game has ever known and a byword for sporting excellence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bradman&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Internationally, Australia has for most of the last century sat at or near the top of the cricketing world. The Australian media tycoon [[Kerry Packer]] altered the traditionalist ethos of the game in the 1970s, inventing [[World Series Cricket]] from which have evolved many aspects of the various modern international forms of the game.

Events on the cricket pitch have occasionally even been elevated to diplomatic incidents in Australian history â as occurred in the infamous [[Bodyline]] controversy of the 1930s, in which an English team bowled in a physically intimidating way leading to accusations of ''unsportsmanlike'' conduct.&lt;ref name=Jardine&gt;{{cite book

{{Main|Rugby league in Australia}}

In 1908, [[rugby league]] was established in Australia by former [[rugby union]] players and supporters as a breakaway professional code. The new code gained and has maintained a wider following in Australia than rugby union, which remained amateur until the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugby.com.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugby.com.au/about_the_aru/history_of_the_aru/history_of_the_aru,183.html#Rugby%20first%20kicks%20off%20in%20Australia |title=History of the ARU |publisher=rugby.com.au |date=25 November 1949 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has traditionally been seen as a &quot;working man's sport&quot; with its roots in the working class communities of the northern English counties of [[Lancashire]] and [[Yorkshire]] translating to similar areas of [[Western Sydney]] and [[Brisbane]].

Rugby league is the most popular winter sport in [[New South Wales]], [[Queensland]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}. The elite club competition is the [[National Rugby League]] (NRL), which features ten teams from New South Wales, three teams from Queensland, and one team each from Victoria, Australian Capital Territory and New Zealand. The season culminates in the premiership deciding game, the NRL [[Grand Final]], traditionally one of Australia's most popular sporting events and one of the largest club championship matches in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The New South Wales [[New South Wales rugby league team|Blues]] and Queensland [[Queensland rugby league team|Maroons]] play a representative series against each other every year, called the [[Rugby League State of Origin|State of Origin]] series, which is one of Australia's major sporting events. In addition, the [[Australian Kangaroos]] represent the country in international matches. Since its inception in 1954, the Australian team has dominated the [[Rugby League World Cup]], having won the competition nine times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_league/world_cup_2000/969083.stm |title=BBC SPORT &amp;#124; RUGBY LEAGUE WORLD CUP 2000 &amp;#124; WORLD CUP 2000 &amp;#124; World Cup history: 1954-92 |publisher=BBC News |date=17 October 2000 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rugby union===
[[File:Wallabies vs Springboks lineout.jpg|thumb|[[The Wallabies]] (Australian national rugby union team) compete for the ball in a [[Line-out (sports)|lineout]] in a match against the [[South Africa national rugby union team|South African Springboks]].]]

{{Main|Rugby union in Australia}}

Reports of [[rugby union]] being played in Australia date back to the 1820s, with local clubs established by the 1860s.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugby.com.au&quot;/&gt; The game has been especially popular as a winter sport in [[Queensland]], [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]. The [[Australian national rugby union team]] is called the Wallabies. In 1908, [[rugby league]] was established in Australia as a breakaway professional code which eventually gained a wider following than rugby union, which remained amateur until 1995. Since the 1920s the Wallabies have worn green and gold jerseys.&lt;ref name=&quot;rugby.com.au&quot;/&gt; Despite having a relatively small player base, mainly in NSW and Queensland, the national side has twice won the [[Rugby World Cup]] â in 1991 and 1999.  Australia hosted the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], which saw the Wallabies defeated by [[England national rugby union team|England]] in the final at [[Telstra Stadium]]. Other notable competitions include the annual [[Bledisloe Cup]] played against Australia's traditional rivals, the [[New Zealand All Blacks]] since 1931, and the [[Tri Nations (rugby union)|Tri-Nations]] competition involving [[South Africa national rugby union team|South Africa]] and New Zealand.

The [[New South Wales Waratahs]], [[Queensland Reds]], [[ACT Brumbies]], and WA's [[Western Force]] represent Australia in the [[Super Rugby]] provincial competition between southern hemisphere nations. The game's following is slowly growing out of traditional areas with new state teams established in Western Australia and Victoria to compete in the Super 14 competition â the [[Melbourne Rebels]] will join the competition in 2011.

Rugby [[Test match (rugby union)|test matches]] hold a significant place in the sports calendar of Australia, and have even at times become highly politicised; during the 1970s, in a significant move against South Africa's [[apartheid]] regime, many Australians (including Wallabies) demonstrated against tours by the racially selected South African team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aru.rugby.com.au/news/2001_july/mandela_to_honour_anti-apartheid_wallabies_o_11660,4273.html |title=rugby.com.au &amp;#124; MANDELA TO HONOUR ANTI-APARTHEID WALLABIES OF 71 |publisher=Aru.rugby.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has produced a number of notable rugby players of national stature, including Sir [[Edward Dunlop]], [[Mark Ella]] (one of the first indigenous Australians to captain a national side) and the prolific try scorer [[David Campese]].

===Soccer===
[[File:Harry Kewell.jpg|left|thumb|180px|[[Harry Kewell]] playing for Australia.]]

{{Main|Association football in Australia}}
Soccer is Australia's highest participation football code in the country with both boys and girls at junior level as well with men and women at senior level. A number of major international stars have played for the national team in recent years including [[Tim Cahill]], [[Mark Viduka]], [[Mark Schwarzer]] and [[Harry Kewell]].

Until recently, the most prominent [[soccer]] clubs were based around ethnic groups, mostly European. However, the national league was completely reformed in 2004, and the first season of the [[A-League 2005â06|A-League]] began in September 2005. Several major names now play in the A-League, such as [[Robbie Fowler]]. The newly franchised teams have been able to translate good sponsorship at the national level into development of the game and junior participation has boomed.

Australia's national team, the [[Socceroos]], as of 2010 has competed at three [[FIFA World Cup]]s. The Australian Government sought to host the event, the world's most watched sporting event, in either [[2018 FIFA World Cup|2018]] or [[2022 FIFA World Cup|2022]] but the bid failed. In order to seek a higher level of competition, the Australian national team moved from the [[Oceania Football Confederation]] to the [[Asian Football Confederation]] in 2006, a much stronger confederation which has guaranteed places in the World Cup, thereby avoiding repetition of a history of missed opportunities in forced sudden-death playoffs.

===Netball===
[[File:Australia v England netball 2008.jpg|thumb|Australia v England: Internationl netball test â Adelaide, October 2008.]]

[[Netball]] has the highest level of participation for a women's sport in Australia, and one of the largest numbers of participants for any [[Australian sport]]. The premier league is the [[ANZ Championship]], formed in 2008, which includes five teams each from Australia and New Zealand. Formerly the premier league was the [[Commonwealth Bank Trophy]], which began in 1997. The [[Australian National Netball Championships]] is an interstate youth competition.  The governing body for the sport is [[Netball Australia]], which was founded in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netball.asn.au/ Netball Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Netball World Championships]] is a quadrennial international [[netball]] world championship, inaugurated in 1963. Since its inception, the competition has been dominated primarily by the [[Australian national netball team]] (The Diamonds) and the [[New Zealand national netball team]] (the Silver Ferns).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.netball.org/ IFNA Homepage&lt;/ref&gt;

===Water sports===
[[File:Bondi at sunrise1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Bondi Icebergs Club at dawn]]

Australia's warm climate and long coastline of sandy beaches and rolling waves provide ideal conditions for water sports such as [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] and [[surfing]]. The majority of Australians live in cities or towns on or near the coast, and so beaches are a place that millions of Australians visit regularly.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture.gov.au&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://culture.gov.au/articles/surflifesaving/ |title=Surf Life Saving - Australia's Culture Portal |publisher=Culture.gov.au |date=6 February 1938 |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swimming is both a popular pastime for ordinary people and a sport in which Australian athletes have achieved success at a competitive level. The family of &quot;Swimming Professor&quot; Richmond Theophilus &quot;Dick&quot; Cavill (1884â1938) contributed significantly to the development of the sport of swimming; his son Arthur is credited by sports journalist W.F. Corbett with originating the [[front crawl|Australian crawl]] stroke, which now predominates in &quot;freestyle&quot; swimming races. Another son, Sydney, was the originator of the [[butterfly stroke]]. Youngest son Richmond Theophilus was the first to use the crawl in a competition, winning 100&amp;nbsp;yards State championship in 1899 and in England, in 1902, he was the first to swim 100&amp;nbsp;yards in under a minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A070720b.htm |title=Cavill, Richmond Theophilus (Dick) (1884 - 1938) Biographical Entry - Australian Dictionary of Biography Online |publisher=Adbonline.anu.edu.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Australia has generally been a world power in Olympic swimming since the [[1956 Melbourne Olympics]]; swimmers  like [[Dawn Fraser]], [[Kieren Perkins]] and [[Ian Thorpe]] have taken multiple gold medals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.olympics.com.au/sport/1/14/Swimming |title=Sport: Swimming - Australian Olympic Committee |publisher=Corporate.olympics.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beaches are public spaces in Australia, where people from all walks of life gather. Australians thus have a particular affinity for the sport of [[surf lifesaving]]. The world's first surf lifesaving club was founded at [[Bondi Beach]], Sydney, in 1906 and surf life savers have a revered status in the national culture. [[Surf Life Saving Australia]] has conducted hundreds of thousands of rescues around Australia. From the junior [[Nippers]] to the adult [[Ironman (surf lifesaving)|Ironmen]] and Ironwomen, tens of thousands of Australians compete in surf lifesaving training and competitions, with [[Australian Surf Life Saving Championships]] attracting large interest.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture.gov.au&quot;/&gt;

In the summer of 1915, [[Duke Kahanamoku]] of [[Hawaii]] introduced [[surf board]] riding to Sydney's [[Freshwater Beach]], amazing locals and starting a long term love affair with the sport in Australia.&lt;ref name=&quot;culture.gov.au&quot;/&gt; In 2007, both the male ([[Mick Fanning]]) and female ([[Stephanie Gilmore]]) [[Association of Surfing Professionals|ASP]] champions were Australian.

The [[Sydney to Hobart]] yacht race is a much anticipated fixture on the Australian sporting calendar. Australia won the [[America's Cup]] under skipper [[John Bertrand (Australian sailor)|John Bertrand]] in 1983.

===Other sports===
[[File:Kiandra carnival 1900 Charles Kerry.jpeg|thumb|The [[Kiandra]] Snowshoe Carnival in 1900. [[Skiing in Australia]] began in this goldmining town in the [[Snowy Mountains]] of New South Wales in the 1860s.]]
[[File:Woman-hat.jpg|thumb|The [[Melbourne Cup]] horserace is known as the &quot;race that stops a nation&quot;.]]
[[File:Hobart Wharfchancellor.jpg|thumb|Constitution Dock, in [[Hobart]], Tasmania - the final destination of the annual [[Sydney-Hobart]] Yacht race]]

Australians participate and excel in many other sports, including [[tennis]], [[golf]], [[basketball]] and [[motorsport]].

Since the 1970s, gambling has become more easily accessible to the public, and consequently many Australians take an interest in sports on which they can bet, including mainstream sports such as cricket and football as well as traditional mediums for &quot;punting&quot; such as [[horse racing]] and [[greyhound racing]].

Horse racing has had a prominent place in Australian culture since early days, with the first spectator sports event in Australia being NSW Governor Macquarie's race meeting at Hyde Park, Sydney in 1810.&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Gary and Heads, Ian (2010). ''And the Crowd Went Wild'', Playright Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The much loved [[Melbourne Cup]] is known as the &quot;race that stops a nation&quot; for the enthusiasm with which Australians natiowide tune in for the annual race. First run in 1861, by 1880 it was already known world-wide and was drawing crowds of 100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Cavanough, Maurice (1978). ''The Melbourne Cup'', p56, 8th ed. Jack Pollard Publishing&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia has its own unique motor racing organisation, known as the [[V8 Supercars]] Touring Series. It has a considerable following in New Zealand, and is steadily growing in popularity across the world, where television coverage allows.

Several non-mainstream sports in Australia still attract a high standard from Australian teams due the sporting culture. For example, it regularly raises world-beating [[field hockey]] teams. Australian [[Road bicycle racing|cyclists]] have recently been successful in the [[Tour de France]] and other international cycling competitions, most notably [[Cadel Evans]]' win in the [[2011 Tour de France]]. In 2008, Australia's only major international cycling race, the [[Tour Down Under]], centred around [[Adelaide]], became the first [[UCI ProTour]] cycling race to be held outside of Europe. Among young people and within schools nationwide, various forms of handball or [[downball]] games have been among the most prevalent sports games for some decades.

Snow sports are enjoyed in the [[Australian Alps]] and in [[Tasmania]]. [[Skiing in Australia]] was first introduced by Norwegian miners in the goldrush town of [[Kiandra, New South Wales]] around 1859, near today's [[Selwyn Snowfields]] ski resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selwynsnow.com.au/templates/sel/page/page_html_standard.php?secID=69 |title=Selwyn Snowfields - Your Winter Playground - History |publisher=Selwynsnow.com.au |date= |accessdate=2011-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport remains a popular winter activity in the south-eastern states and territories. Major [[alpine skiing]] resorts include [[Thredbo]], [[Perisher Ski Resort|Perisher]] and [[Charlotte Pass]] in New South Wales; [[Mount Hotham]], [[Falls Creek, Victoria|Falls Creek]] and [[Mount Buller]] in Victoria and [[Mount Ben Lomond]] in Tasmania. Extensive areas are available for cross country skiing within national parks including [[Kosciuszko National Park]] (NSW), [[Alpine National Park]] (VIC); [[Namadgi National Park]] (ACT) and in the [[Tasmanian Wilderness]]. Australia has long [[Australia at the Winter Olympics|participated in the Winter Olympics]] and in recent decades, Australians have enjoyed medal successes at the Games - particularly in the sport of [[aerial skiing]].

Australia's [[History of Australia|historical links]] to Britain have contributed to the establishment of strong traditions in sports of British origin, but in recent decades there has been a marked increase in interest and participation in American sports, particularly basketball. This has led to opportunities for Australians to play at the top level in sports such as [[baseball]], [[basketball]] and [[American football]]. [[Grant Balfour]] is a relief pitcher for the [[Tampa Bay Rays]], and played in the [[2008 World Series]]. Australian basketballers have done well at the Olympics, coming fourth four times. Australians such as [[Luc Longley]] and [[Andrew Bogut]] have had long careers in the US [[National Basketball Association]]. Australian women have made an even bigger impact in the US [[Women's National Basketball Association]], with [[Lauren Jackson]] captaining the [[Seattle Storm]], and the Australian women's basketball team have won three silver and one bronze medal at the Olympics. The skill set of Australian Rules footballers fits the mould of US [[National Football League]] (NFL) [[Punter (football)|punters]], and they stand out from their American peers with their ability to tackle returners. Two former [[Australian Football League|AFL]] footballers competed in the 2009 [[National Football Conference|NFC]] Championship game as punters, [[Saverio Rocca]] for the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[Ben Graham (football player)|Ben Graham]] for the [[Arizona Cardinals]]. Graham's appearance in [[Super Bowl XLIII]] made him the first Australian to play in the NFL's championship game.

==Attitudes, beliefs and stereotypes==
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2009}}
{{POV-section|date=October 2010}}

Australians have very strong attitudes and beliefs which are reinforced by the tenets of the country's society.

The Australian national character has been forged by the difficulty of subduing the land. Unlike other cultures based on a nurturing landscape that they seek to protect from others, Australian settlers experienced great hardship and had to support each other in order to survive. The battle against the elements led to the nickname of a member of Australia's working class being the 'Aussie battler'.

The need to laugh in the face of danger while battling the landscape has provoked a strange view of the world, with a distinctive upside-down sense of humour. Times of hardship or even disaster are ridiculed, and this extends to the Australian delight in dubbing a tall man &quot;Shorty,&quot; a quiet one &quot;Rowdy,&quot; a bald man &quot;Curly&quot; and a redhead &quot;Bluey&quot;.

===Mateship===
[[File:CanberraSimpsonMemorial.jpg|thumb|150px|A commemorative statue of [[John Simpson Kirkpatrick]], a famous stretcher bearer who was killed in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]].]]

&quot;[[Mateship]]&quot;, or loyal [[:wikt:fraternity|fraternity]], has been a central tenet of survival in the harsh landscape. Mateship can be defined as the code of conduct, particularly between men, although more recently also between men and women, stressing [[social equality|equality]] and [[friendship]]. Mateship is seen as an important element of the qualities that the [[Australian Defence Force]] values in its troops.
The glorification of Australia's early soldiers in the [[Boer War]] and [[World War I]] reinforces these values. This may also explain why sport plays such a central role in Australian culture.

An aspect of the mateship culture on language is that Australians have a propensity for the diminutive forms of names (e.g. Hargrave -&gt; Hargie; Wilkinson -&gt; Wilko; John -&gt; Johnno; David-&gt; Davo; Hogan -&gt; Hoges; James -&gt; Jimmy -&gt; Jim -&gt; Jimbo). This is a display of affection and acceptance rather than belittlement.

One result of the prevalence of the 'mateship' culture is that Australian society is stringently anti-hierarchical. Australians are expected to behave with humility and not think of themselves as better than their peers. Any disloyalty to their 'mates' is treated harshly, and is known as the [[tall poppy syndrome]], where people who grow greater than their peers are harshly criticised as being [[narcissism|narcissistic]], or 'up themselves'. Even the most successful and beautiful Australians are eager to proclaim how ordinary they are. This egalitarian social system makes Australian society appear 'laid-back', or relaxed to visitors. Most forms of address are by first name or nickname, and only children regularly use titles such as 'Mister' or 'Sir' for authority figures.

The mateship culture combined with the original convict and then colonial culture has created an irreverence for established authority, particularly if it is pompous or out of touch with reality. Politicians, or &quot;pollies&quot;, are generally disliked and distrusted. Politicians who seek to lead must comply to the views of the egalitarian electorate, who will punish any hint of arrogance or glory-seeking behaviour. Voter turnout at elections had in fact been so low that [[compulsory voting]] was introduced for the [[Australian federal election, 1925|1925 federal election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/pdf/voting/compulsory_voting.pdf |title=Compulsory Voting in Australia |publisher=[[Australian Electoral Commission]]|format=PDF |date=16 January 2006 |accessdate=2011-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phrase, &quot;[[Lucky Country|the lucky country]]&quot;, coined by [[Donald Horne]], is a sobriquet used to describe Australia in terms of weather, lifestyle and history.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/luckycountry/ The Lucky Country]&lt;/ref&gt; Ironically, Horne was using the term to criticise the complacency of Australian society in the early 1960s.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

===Folklore===

Australian stories and legends have a cultural significance independent of their empirical truth or falsehood. This can be seen in the national obsession with the almost mythological portrayal of [[bushranger]] [[Ned Kelly]] as a mixture of the underdog and [[Robin Hood]].

Australian history glorifies its sportsmen and its soldiers. Yet like many legends, truths do stem from it. Australia has shown, in the past and present, that for a country of just over 23 million people, it is capable of extraordinary things in the sporting arenas, such as the 49 medals won at the [[2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Athens Olympic Games]]. Militarily, Australians have served in numerous overseas wars, ranging from the [[Battle of Gallipoli]], through to recent regional security missions, such as [[East Timor]], [[Iraq]] and [[Afghanistan]].

Australian war culture is somewhat different from most other western cultures. It generally consists of sombre reflection and commemoration of all who have died in wartime and honouring those who lived. It focuses on noble sacrifice rather than glory. An annual national holiday, [[Anzac Day]] exists for this purpose.

The Australian experience of defeat in the [[Gallipoli Campaign]] of [[World War I]], which is viewed as the first iconic moment in modern Australian war involvement, is viewed by Australians with both pride for the fighting of the soldiers, and bitterness for the perceived negligence on the part of British commanders. The incidences of valour, bravery, and determination displayed during the campaign for Gallipoli, as well as the mutual respect for their [[Turkey|Turkish]] adversaries led by Kemal [[AtatÃ¼rk]], is seen as part of the [[ANZAC]] spirit. This experience of war was repeated at battles on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]], such as the [[Battle of Passchendaele]].

During the latter part of the First World War the legend of Australians being great soldiers was entrenched as the [[Australian Imperial Force]] was used as the shock troops of the [[British Empire]] forces. The [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Battle of Amiens]], known as the &quot;Black Day of the German Army&quot;, was a campaign in which Australian soldiers played a crucial role. The Australians were considered to be remarkably determined, united and hard-working soldiers. Many Australians knew how to ride and shoot prior to enlistment, making them talented recruits, but the Australian soldiers were infamous for their lax attitude towards formal parade ground discipline, a notoriety that the Australian soldiers revelled in. From this the notion of the larrikin [[Digger (soldier)|Digger]] emerged, an important part of contemporary Australian identity.

===Customs===
====Friendly rivalry====
Australians and New Zealanders have a rivalry, especially in certain sports such as [[rugby league]], [[rugby union]] and [[netball]]. The rivalry is often compared to brothers in the same family competing against each other.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The biggest sporting rivalry exists between Australia and England. As Australians see New Zealanders as their little brother they see the English as big brother, with more people, history and money. The sporting arena was a place where Australians could shine.

====The Australian dream====
{{Main|Australian Dream}}

The Australian dream of [[home ownership]] underpins suburban Australia. However, this has been challenged by the low affordability of housing in Australia.

====&quot;Underdog&quot; identity====
{{Main|Underdog (competition)}}
As well as the prevalence of the [[tall poppy syndrome]] bringing back to Earth the high fliers, the egalitarian Australian society has a traditional Australian support for the &quot;underdog&quot;. Australians will show support for those who appear to be at a disadvantage even when the underdog is competing against fellow Australians.

This underdog attitude is most evident in sport, as sport is also a large part of Australian culture. Should an Australian be asked to choose between two unknown competitors, very often they will choose the one least likely to win, such as swimmer [[Eric Moussambani|Eric the Eel]] during the 2000 Olympics. The success of [[Steven Bradbury]] in the 2002 Winter Olympics who won a skating gold medal after all his competitors crashed has coined the expression ''[[Steven Bradbury#&quot;Doing a Bradbury&quot;|'doing a Bradbury']]'' which underpins the spirit of the underdog, positive thinking and never giving up.

During the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]], the [[Georgia national rugby union team|Georgian rugby team]] arrived in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]] with a crowd of Perth residents welcoming them with colourful support, and a similar occurrence was noted in [[Townsville, Queensland]] where the Japanese rugby team was preferred to that of the French.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/sport/content/s970387.htm ABC Sport - Sport - Townsville has yen for Japanese rugby side] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====A &quot;fair go&quot;====
The belief in a &quot;fair go&quot; is a key part of Australian culture and Australian society, related to the support for the underdog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aad.org.au/advocacy/fairaward.php Fair Go Award] {{dead link|date=June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be seen in the existence of strong public health and education systems in Australia, and equal opportunity legislation to ensure people are not excluded from jobs or positions by their race, gender or sexual preference.

====Cultural cringe====
{{Main|Cultural cringe}}

The idea of cultural cringe was defined by Australian sociologists Brian Head and James Walter  as the belief that one's own country occupies a &quot;subordinate cultural place on the periphery&quot;, and that &quot;intellectual standards are set and innovations occur elsewhere&quot;. As a consequence, a person who holds this belief is inclined to devalue their own country's cultural, academic and artistic life, and to venerate the &quot;superior&quot; culture of another country.
