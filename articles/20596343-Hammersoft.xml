'''Milo  Anthony Ventimiglia''' (born July 8, 1977)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.yahoo.com/milo-ventimiglia/contributor/38190 |title=â Milo Ventimiglia â Yahoo!TV |publisher=Tv.yahoo.com |date=1977-07-08 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tvguide.com/celebrities/milo-ventimiglia/166819 â Milo Ventimiglia News, Milo Ventimiglia Bio and Photos | TVGuide.com&lt;/ref&gt; is an American television actor best known for his role of [[Peter Petrelli]] on the TV series ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''. Ventimiglia was first noticed by fans during his three year stint on the [[The WB Television Network|WB]] series ''[[Gilmore Girls]]'', playing [[Rory Gilmore]]'s love interest [[Jess Mariano]] from 2001 until his final guest appearance in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/character/ch0016756/filmoseries#tt0238784 Jess Mariano (Character) - Filmography by TV series&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

After his own WB series ''[[The Bedford Diaries]]'', a recurring role as [[Meg Pryor]]'s love interest on [[NBC]]'s ''[[American Dreams]]'', and playing [[Rocky Balboa]]'s son in the sixth and final installment of the [[Rocky (film series)|Rocky series]], ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'', Ventimiglia's big break came in 2006 when he received the part of nurse-turned-superhero [[Peter Petrelli]] for four seasons on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''.

==Early life==
Ventimiglia was born in [[Orange County, California|Orange County]], [[California]], the son of Carol ([[married and maiden names|nÃ©e]] [[Wilson (surname)|Wilson]]) and Peter Ventimiglia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ventimiglia&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Keck|first=William|title=Yo! Ventimiglia gets into the tough-guy act|publisher=USA Today|date=2006-12-18|url=http://www.usatoday.com/life/people/2006-12-18-milo-ventimiglia_x.htm| accessdate =2006-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father is of [[Sicilian American|Sicilian]] descent and his mother has [[English American|English]], [[Irish American|Irish]], [[Scottish American|Scottish]], [[French American|French]], and [[Cherokee]] Native American ancestry.&lt;ref name=&quot;chat1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Ventimiglia|first=Milo|authorlink=|coauthors=|title=Milo Ventimiglia AOL Chat|publisher=AOL|date=2002-05-14|url=http://asianfanatics.net/forum/lofiversion/index.php/t21610.html|accessdate=2007-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; His last name, [[House of Ventimiglia|Ventimiglia]], is the name of the town of [[Ventimiglia]] in [[Liguria]], Italy, which later gave its name to another city, [[Ventimiglia di Sicilia]]. The youngest of three children, he has two older sisters, one of whom is named Rose. He has explained in an interview with ''USA Today'' that his &quot;crooked mouth&quot; is a result of dead nerves on the left side, which cause that side to remain immobile, much like, incidentally, [[Sylvester Stallone]], with whom he worked in ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ventimiglia&quot;/&gt;

Ventimiglia attended [[El Modena High School]] in [[Orange, California]], where he wrestled, acted in drama productions and held the office of president in student government. He graduated in 1995. At eighteen years of age, Ventimiglia received a scholarship to study at the [[American Conservatory Theater]] for their summer program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.miloventimigliafan.com/milo/index.php?bio| title = Milo Ventimiglia Fan| accessdate = 2007-05-01| date = 2002-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended [[UCLA]] as an English major for four years, but did not graduate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uclalumni.net/AlumniStories/Notable/Milo.cfm |title=UCLA Alumni Association |publisher=Uclalumni.net |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
At 18 years of age, Ventimiglia started auditioning, booking jobs, and working his way up. His first starring role was as a gay teenager in ''Must Be The Music'', a short film released as part of Strand Releasing's ''[[Boys Life 2]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119735/ Must Be the Music (1996) - IMDb&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  From there, Ventimiglia studied at UCLA before landing a role on ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel Air]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morrow&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Morrow | first=Terry | title=Ventimiglia moves from super-rebel to superhero | publisher=Scripps Howard News Service | date=2006-12-20 | url =http://www.shns.com/shns/g_index2.cfm?action=detail&amp;pk=STARGAZING-12-20-06 | accessdate=2007-01-07
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventimiglia has also guest starred on such television series as ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', ''[[Sabrina, the Teenage Witch (TV series)|Sabrina, the Teenage Witch]]'', ''[[Law and Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' and ''[[Boston Public]].'' He had the part of the main character, Jed Perry, in the short-lived FOX TV series, ''[[Opposite Sex (TV series)|Opposite Sex]]''.  Milo also played a key role in an Apple advert for the Apple iBook.&lt;ref&gt;[http://macenstein.com/default/archives/923 Apple reunited with âHeroesâ (via time travel, ânatch)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2001 to 2004, Ventimiglia played brooding teen [[Jess Mariano]] on ''[[Gilmore Girls]]''. He signed on for a spin-off of ''Gilmore Girls'', entitled ''Windward Circle,'' which was going to be focused on the relationship between Jess and his estranged father (played by [[Rob Estes]]), but the proposed series never made it to air because of high filming costs. The season 3 episode ''Here Comes the Son'', was the pilot for the California-set spin-off, which would have starred Ventimiglia, Rob Estes and [[Sherilyn Fenn]]. Ventimiglia returned to ''Gilmore Girls'' for a few episodes in seasons four and six after his 2003 departure.

In the third and final season of the [[NBC]] drama ''[[American Dreams]]'', Ventimiglia played Chris Pierce, the rebellious boyfriend of [[Meg Pryor]] ([[Brittany Snow]]). Pierce and his single mother, Shelly ([[Daphne Zuniga]]), a [[Playboy bunny]], move into the house next to the Pryors. Chris Pierce evades the draft, fearing he would be forced to fight in the [[Vietnam War]], where Meg Pryor's older brother, [[John Pryor, Jr.|J.J.]] ([[Will Estes]]) was wounded. Chris and Meg escape [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] in the series finale to [[Berkeley, California]], much to the sadness of Meg's best friend, [[Roxanne Bojarski]] ([[Vanessa Lengies]]).

In 2005, he starred in the mid-season replacement series ''[[The Bedford Diaries]]'', for which he did not have to audition. The producers had only Ventimiglia in mind for the role. However, the show lasted only eight episodes and was one of several shows not picked up by the newly-formed network [[The CW]]. During his off-time from television and production work, he has had supporting roles in horror films such as ''[[Cursed (2005 film)|Cursed]]'' and ''[[Stay Alive]]'' as well as starring roles in the short-film ''[[Intelligence (film)|Intelligence]]'' and the full-length feature ''[[Dirty Deeds (2005 film)|Dirty Deeds]]''. Most recently, he played Robert &quot;Rocky Jr.&quot; Balboa, the son of Rocky Balboa, in the latest ''[[Rocky (film series)|Rocky]]'' installment ''[[Rocky Balboa (film)|Rocky Balboa]]'' which was released in December [[2006 in film|2006]]. Coincidentally, in the 2004 Gilmore Girls episode, ''&quot;Nag Hammadi Is Where they Found the Gnostic Gospels&quot;'', [[Lorelai Gilmore]] refers to Milo's character, Jess, as being able to &quot;pull off an extremely convincing 'Adrian'&quot;, a reference likening Jess to Rocky Balboa.

[[Image:Milo Ventimiglia.jpg|right|thumb|Ventimiglia at the ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'' season three premiere, September 2008]]

In his biggest role to date, he starred as [[Peter Petrelli]] in the NBC program ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]'', a show about &quot;ordinary&quot; people discovering they have superpowers. Alongside his work in ''Heroes'', Ventimiglia has also taken on other projects. In mid-2007 he starred as the love interest of pop/R&amp;B singer [[Fergie (singer)|Fergie]] in the music video for &quot;[[Big Girls Don't Cry (Fergie song)|Big Girls Don't Cry]]&quot;. In 2008, he starred in the horror film ''[[Pathology (film)|Pathology]].'' The movie co-starred ''[[Charmed]]'' actress [[Alyssa Milano]] and was directed by Marc Schoelermann for [[MGM]].

After working with writers Mark Neveldine and [[Brian Taylor (filmmaker)|Brian Taylor]] on ''Pathology'', Ventimiglia appeared in the pair's next film, ''[[Gamer (film)|Gamer]]''. He has called Neveldine and Taylor the &quot;next big thing&quot; in filmmaking and immediately agreed to play the part of Rick Rape in the futuristic thriller. When describing Rick Rape, Ventimiglia said that &quot;Moonraker, silver grill, with a latex outfit making him look like a bumblebee. With the perverse nature of a teenage boy on speed.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Jen Yamato | url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10008496-pathology/news/1722554/ | title=Milo Ventimiglia Gets Dark in Pathology, Talks Role In Neveldine &amp; Taylor's Game | publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] | date=2008-04-17 | accessdate=2008-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ventimiglia is set to star in the [[Xavier Gens]] apocalypse thriller film ''[[The Divide (film)|The Divide]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/20190 |title=Xavier Gens' Apocalypse 'The Divide' Encompasses Genre Cast |publisher=Bloody-disgusting.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He will be the voice of [[Wolverine (comics)|Wolverine]] in the upcoming English dub of the [[Marvel Anime|Marvel Anime: Wolverine]] anime series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|type= Press Release|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2011-04-02/marvel-television-announces-adrian-pasdar-and-milo-ventimiglia-for-iron-man-and-wolverine-anime-series-to-air-on-g4-july-2011|title= Marvel Television Announces Adrian Pasdar &amp; Milo Ventimiglia For Iron Man &amp; Wolverine Anime Series To Air On G4 July 2011|publisher= [[Anime News Network]]|date=2011-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Production work===
In addition to being hired as a second unit director for the 2003 and 2004 &quot;Image Campaigns&quot; for the former [[The WB Television Network|WB Network]], [[Divide Pictures]] (the production company he co-owns and operates with best friend Russ Cundiff), Ventimiglia is now producing and developing a mini web-series called ''[[It's a Mall World]]'' as part of a marketing campaign for [[American Eagle Outfitters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2007-05-08-american-eagle-usat_N.htm | work=USA Today | first=Theresa | last=Howard | title=American Eagle Outfitters plans Web comedy | date=2007-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The webisodes are due to start airing on American Eagle's official, during episodes of the new season of [[MTV]]'s ''[[The Real World]]'', and in American Eagle stores nationwide on August 2. According to American Eagle's website, Ventimiglia will be directing the series, while his friend Cundiff will be producing it.

In 2005, Divide Pictures created The DSC, or Divide Social Club, an online and global social network for like minded individuals&lt;ref name=dsc&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dividesocialclub.com |title=The Dsc â Divide Social Club |publisher=Dividesocialclub.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; co-founded by Ventimiglia with his best friends Cundiff and Dino DeMilio, a radio producer for &quot;The Tom Leykis Show&quot;. In addition to t-shirt production, Divide Social Club also produces &quot;internet content&quot; in the form of videos that have appeared on YouTube.

Ventimiglia, Russ Cundiff and Divide Pictures partnered with Top Cow to produce the comic series REST which will be a monthly limited series. The comic is about John Barret, a white-collar New Yorker whose life changes when he becomes addicted to a drug that prevents him from falling asleep. Divide also has a comic book called Berserker written by Rick Loverd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Woman |first=The |url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/35611/top-cow-preview-berserker-4 |title=Top Cow Preview: Berserker #4 |publisher=Dreadcentral.com |date=2010-01-29 |accessdate=2011-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ventimiglia will co-produce and appear in &quot;Ultradome,&quot; a web series which will debate the comparative merits of science fiction characters.  The project is a collaboration between Agility Studios and Ventimiglia's DiVide Pictures.  In the first episode, Ventimiglia will argue in favor of ''[[Lord of the Rings]]''' superiority over Star Wars.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Live Feed&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.thrfeed.com/2009/05/milo-ventimiglia-to-pit-stars-wars-vs-lotr.html|title = Milo Ventimigliaâs new project: Star Wars vs. LOTR| publisher = The Live Feed
