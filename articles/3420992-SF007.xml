'''Psychological thriller''' is a specific [[sub-genre]] of the broad ranged [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] with heavy focus on characters. However, it often incorporates elements from the [[Mystery fiction|mystery]] and [[drama film|drama]] [[genre]], along with the typical traits of the thriller genre. In addition to drama and mystery, many psychological thrillers contain elements of, and often overlap with, the [[horror film|horror]] genre, particularly [[psychological horror]].

==Definition==
{{sectOR|date=January 2011}}
*'''[[Psychology|Psychological]]''' â Elements that are related to the mind or processes of the [[mind]]; they are mental rather than physical in nature. Sometimes the suspense comes from within one solitary character where characters must resolve [[Emotional conflict|conflicts]] with their own minds. Usually, this conflict is an effort to understand something that has happened to them. These conflicts are made more vivid with physical expressions of the conflict in the means of either physical manifestations, or physical torsions of the characters at play.
*'''[[Thriller (genre)|Thriller]]''' â Generally, thrillers focus on [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] over [[fictional character|character]], and thus emphasize intense, physical action over the character's psyche. Psychological thrillers tend to reverse this formula to a certain degree, emphasizing the characters just as much, if not more so, than the plot.
*'''Psychological thriller''' â Characters are no longer reliant on physical strength to overcome their brutish enemies (which is often the case in typical action-thrillers), but rather are reliant on their mental resources, whether it be by battling wits with a formidable opponent or by battling for equilibrium in the character's own mind. The [[wikt:suspense|suspense]] created by psychological thrillers often comes from two or more characters preying upon one another's minds, either by playing deceptive games with the other or by merely trying to demolish the other's mental state

==Literary devices and techniques==
*'''[[Stream of consciousness writing|Stream of consciousness]]''' â a literary technique which seeks to describe an individual's point of view by giving the written equivalent of the character's thought processes. In psychological thrillers, the narrative tries to manifest the character's psyche through word usage, descriptions, or visuals.
*'''[[First-person narrative]]''' â a literary technique in which the story is narrated by one or more of the characters, who explicitly refers to him or herself in the first person, that is, &quot;I&quot;. This direct involvement that the characters have with the story in turn makes the reader more involved with the characters themselves, and thus able to understand the mechanics of the characters' minds.  This technique is often paired with the concept of the [[unreliable narrator]]. 
*'''[[Back-story]]''' â the history behind the situation extant at the start of the main story. This deepens the psychological aspect of the story since the reader is able to more fully understand the character; more specifically, what the character's motivations are and how his past has shaped his current cognitive perceptions.

== Themes ==
Many psychological thrillers have emerged over the past years, all in various media (film, literature, radio, etc.). Despite these very different forms of representation, general trends have appeared throughout the narratives. Some of these consistent themes include:

*'''[[Reality]]''' 
*'''[[Perception]]''' 
*'''[[Mind]]'''
*'''[[Existence]]/Purpose'''
*'''[[Identity (philosophy)|Identity]]''' 
*'''[[Death]]'''

These major subgenres help develop the plot of a psychological thriller film, shaping the characters'personalities.
eg. usually character will find the true identidy/ the devil side of himself/herself in psychological thriller, in which it is one of the architypes -  the loss of innocence.
