'''Helen Bates &quot;Penny&quot; Chenery Tweedy''' (born January 27, 1922) is an [[United States|American]] sportswoman who bred and raced [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], the 1973 winner of the [[United States Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|Triple Crown]]. The youngest of three children, she graduated from [[The Madeira School]] in 1939 and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] from [[Smith College]], then studied at the [[Columbia Business School]], where she met her future husband, John Tweedy, Sr., a [[Columbia Law School]] student.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=RM&amp;p_theme=rm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=1122A64776289408&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM nl.newsbank.com]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, [[Randolph-Macon College]] in [[Ashland, Virginia]] awarded Chenery an Honorary Doctor of Laws degree.  Married in May 1949, the couple had four children. In 1973 horseracing telecasts, CBS called her Penny Chenery, not Penny Tweedy.

==Meadow Farm Stable==
Chenery was born in [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]], [[New York]] and raised in [[Virginia]]. She was part of the family that owned Meadow Farm, a [[thoroughbred]] racing operation and [[horse breeding]] business in [[Caroline County, Virginia|Caroline County]] founded by her father, [[Christopher Chenery]]. Her father was admitted to [[New Rochelle, New York|New Rochelle]] Hospital in late February 1968 and remained there for nearly five years until his death in January 1973. Always profitable, the stable began losing money in the latter part of the 1960s, exacerbated by Christopher Chenery's illness. Therefore, Penny Chenery's siblings planned to sell the operation on his passing. However, Penny Chenery had other ideas. The housewife of eighteen years and mother to four children took over management of the {{convert|2798|acre|km2|adj=on}} farm. In 1969, she was confronted with a difficult problem when trainer Casey Hayes decided to retire after more than 25 years with her father. Chenery consulted with longtime family friend and business associate [[Arthur B. Hancock, Jr.|Bull Hancock]] of [[Claiborne Farm]], and on his advice hired Roger Laurin to train and manage the Meadow Stable horses. Laurin cut costs and returned the operation to profitability before accepting an offer to train for the powerful [[Phipps family]] stables. Penny Chenery then hired his father, [[Lucien Laurin|Lucien]], and in 1972 they guided the Meadow Farm's colt [[Riva Ridge]] to victory in the [[Kentucky Derby]] and [[Belmont Stakes]] and the two-year-old [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] to 1972 [[American Horse of the Year]] honors.  The following year, [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]] captured the imagination of racing fans worldwide when he became the first Triple Crown winner in 25 years. Both horses were inducted into the [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame]].

===The Breeding of Secretariat===
Although Christopher Chenery was recorded as the official breeder of [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], well-known racing columnist [[William Nack|Bill Nack]] wrote in his book on the racehorse that Penny Chenery made the decision to breed their [[mare]] [[Somethingroyal]] to [[Bold Ruler]] twice. The first mating in 1968 produced the filly The Bride. The second breeding, in 1969, resulted in [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]].

In 1983, Penny Chenery, [[Martha F. Gerry]], and [[Allaire du Pont]] became the first women to be admitted as members of [[The Jockey Club]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cs.bloodhorse.com/blogs/wgoh/archive/2009/09/15/classic-ladies-by-dan-liebman.aspx cs.bloodhorse.com] - 2009-09-15&lt;/ref&gt; From 1976 to 1984, Chenery served as president of the [[Thoroughbred Owners and Breeders Association]]. Also in 1976, she became a member of the Executive Committee of the [[American Horse Council]], the horse industry trade association in Washington, DC.  In 1983, she became the first woman elected as a member of [[The Jockey Club]] and has also served as a member of the judges' panel for the Dogwood Dominion Award. In addition, she helped found the [[Thoroughbred Retirement Foundation]], an organization dedicated to saving [[Thoroughbred]] horses no longer able to compete on the racetrack from possible neglect, abuse and slaughter.

In addition to breeding [[Secretariat (horse)|Secretariat]], Chenery bred [[Saratoga Dew]], who became the first [[New York]]-bred horse to ever win an [[Eclipse Award]] when the [[filly]] was voted the 1992 [[American Champion Three-Year-Old Filly]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://horseracing.about.com/b/a/232729.htm Horse racing.about.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 the [[Arlington Park]] track established the annual &quot;Penny Chenery Distinguished Woman in Racing Award&quot;. In 2006, the [[National Thoroughbred Racing Association]] honored her with the [[Eclipse Award|Eclipse Award of Merit]] for a lifetime of outstanding achievement in thoroughbred racing. In 2009, she was awarded the [[Smith College|Smith College Medal]] for extraordinary professional achievement and outstanding service to her community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smith.edu/newsoffice/releases/NewsOffice08_005.html Smith College] - news release&lt;/ref&gt;

A long-time resident of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], [[New York]], Chenery now lives near her children in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]]. 

Chenery was portrayed by actress [[Diane Lane]] in the [[2010 in film|2010]] motion picture ''[[Secretariat (film)|Secretariat]],'' released on October 8, 2010. Chenery herself appeared in a [[Cameo appearance|cameo]] role in the film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1028576/ imdb.com]&lt;/ref&gt;
