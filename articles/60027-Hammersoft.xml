The '''Battle of Iwo Jima''' (19 Februaryâ26 March 1945), or '''Operation ''Detachment''''', was a major battle in which the [[United States]] fought for and captured the island of [[Iwo Jima]] from the [[Empire of Japan]]. The U.S. invasion, charged with the mission of capturing the three [[airbase|airfields]] on Iwo Jima,&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; resulted in some of the fiercest fighting in the [[Pacific War|Pacific Campaign]] of [[World War II]].

The [[Imperial Japanese Army]] positions on the island were heavily [[Fortification|fortified]], with a vast network of bunkers, hidden artillery, and {{convert|18|km|mi|abbr=on}} of underground tunnels.&lt;ref name=WW2MMDb_Letters&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=|url=http://www.worldwar2database.com/html/letters_from_iwo_jima.htm|title=Letters from Iwo Jima|publisher=World War II Multimedia Database}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BattleFleet_IwoDefense&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=|url=http://www.battle-fleet.com/pw/his/Battle-Iwo-Jima-Defense.htm|title=Battle of Iwo JimaâJapanese Defense|work=World War II Naval Strategy}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Americans were covered by extensive naval and air support, capable of delivering an enormous amount of firepower onto the Japanese positions. The battle was the first American attack on the Japanese [[Japanese Archipelago|Home Islands]], and the Imperial soldiers defended their positions tenaciously. Iwo Jima was also the only [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] battle where the American overall casualties exceeded the Japanese,&lt;ref name= &quot;O'Brien&quot;&gt;{{cite web|first=Cyril J.|last=O'Brien|title=Iwo Jima Retrospective|url= http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,NI_Iwo_Jima2,00.html|accessdate=2007-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; although Japanese combat deaths numbered 3 times that of Americans. Of the more than 18,000 Japanese soldiers present at the beginning of the battle, only 216 were taken prisoner.&lt;ref name= Burrell83&gt;Burrell 2006, p. 83. [http://books.google.com/books?id=K8J4wkgcqCIC&amp;pg=PA83 Burrell talks] about how many historians have overestimated the number Japanese defenders, with 20,000 and even 25,000 listed. Burrell puts the range between 18,061 and 18,591, with exactly 216 of these taken prisoner. The rest were KIA or MIA.&lt;/ref&gt; The rest were killed or missing and assumed dead.&lt;ref name=Burrell83/&gt; Despite heavy fighting and casualties on both sides, Japanese defeat was assured from the start. The Americans possessed an overwhelming superiority in arms and numbers; this, coupled with the impossibility of Japanese retreat or reinforcement, ensured that there was no plausible scenario in which the U.S. could have lost the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian R. Lewis, ''The American Culture of War. The History of U.S. Military Force from World War II to Operation Iraqi Freedom'', New York 2007, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Iwo jima location map.png|thumb|left|Location of Iwo Jima]]

After the American [[Gilbert and Marshall Islands campaign|seizure of the Marshall Islands]] and devastating [[Operation Hailstone|air attacks]] against [[Truk]] in the [[Caroline Islands]] in January 1944, the Japanese military leadership reappraised the military situation. All indications pointed to an American drive towards the [[Mariana Islands|Marianas]] and [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]]. To counter such a move they established an inner line of defense extending generally northward from the Carolines to the Marianas, and thence to the [[Ogasawara Islands]]. In March 1944, the [[Thirty-First Army (Japan)|31st Army]], commanded by General [[Hideyoshi Obata]], was activated to garrison this inner line. The commander of the [[Chichi Jima]] garrison was placed nominally in command of Army and Navy units in the Ogasawara Islands.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; Daily bomber raids from the Marianas hit the mainland as part of [[Operation Scavenger|Operation ''Scavenger'']]. Iwo Jima served as an early warning station which radioed reports of incoming bombers back to mainland Japan, allowing Japanese air defenses to be prepared for the arrival of American bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt;

After the U.S. seized bases in the Marshalls in the battles of [[Battle of Kwajalein|Kwajalein]] and [[Battle of Eniwetok|Eniwetok]] in February 1944, Army and navy reinforcements were sent to Iwo Jima: 500 men from the naval base at [[Yokosuka]] and 500 from Chichi Jima reached Iwo Jima during March and April 1944. At the same time, with reinforcements arriving from Chichi Jima and the home islands, the Army garrison on Iwo Jima had reached a strength of over 5,000 men.&lt;ref name= &quot;morison&quot;/&gt; The loss of the Marianas during the summer of 1944 greatly increased the importance of the Ogasawaras for the Japanese, who were well aware that the loss of these islands would facilitate American air raids against the home islands, disrupting war manufacturing and severely damaging civilian morale.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; Final Japanese plans for the defense of the Ogasawaras were overshadowed by the fact that the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] had already lost most of its strength and could no longer prevent American landings. Moreover, aircraft losses throughout 1944 had been so heavy that, even if war production were not affected by American air attacks, combined Japanese air strength was not expected to increase to 3,000 aircraft until March or April 1945. Even then, these planes could not be used from bases in the home islands against Iwo Jima because their range was not more than {{convert|900|km|mi|abbr=on}}; besides, all available aircraft had to be hoarded for possible use on [[Taiwan]] and adjacent islands near land bases.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; 

In a postwar study, Japanese staff officers described the strategy applied in the defense of Iwo Jima in the following terms:

{{quotation|In the light of the above situation, seeing that it was impossible to conduct our air, sea, and ground operations on Iwo Jima toward ultimate victory, it was decided that in order to gain time necessary for the preparation of the Homeland defence, our forces should rely solely upon the established defensive equipment in that area, checking the enemy by delaying tactics. Even the [[Kamikaze|suicidal attacks]] by small groups of our Army and Navy airplanes, the surprise attacks by our submarines, and the actions of parachute units, although effective, could be regarded only as a strategical ruse on our part. It was a most depressing thought that we had no available means left for the exploitation of the strategical opportunities which might from time to time occur in the course of these operations.&lt;ref&gt;USA, FEC, HistDiv, &quot;Operations in the Central Pacific&quot; â Japanese Studies in World War II (Japanese Monograph No. 48, OCMH), p. 62.; cited in George W. Garand and Truman R. Strobridge (1971). [http://www.ibiblio.org/hyperwar/USMC/IV/USMC-IV-VI-1.html ''History of U.S. Marine Corps Operations in World War II'']. Historical Branch, G-3 Division, Headquarters, U.S. Marine Corps. Vol IV, Part VI, Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt;||Japanese Monograph No. 48}}

At the end of the [[Battle of Leyte]] in the [[Philippines]], the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] were left with a two month lull in their operations before the planned [[Battle of Okinawa|invasion of Okinawa]]. Iwo Jima was strategically important: it provided an airbase for Japanese aircraft to intercept long-range [[B-29 Superfortress]] bombers and provided a haven for Japanese naval units in dire need of any support available. In addition, it was used by the Japanese to stage [[Japanese air attacks on the Mariana Islands|air attacks on the Mariana Islands]] from November 1944-January 1945. The capture of Iwo Jima would eliminate these problems and provide a staging area for the [[Operation Downfall|eventual invasion of the Japanese mainland]]. The distance of B-29 raids would be cut in half, and a base would be available for [[P-51 Mustang]] fighters to escort and protect the bombers.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; Intelligence sources were confident that Iwo Jima would fall in a week. In light of the optimistic intelligence reports, the decision was made to invade Iwo Jima: the landing was designated Operation ''Detachment''.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; They were unaware that the Japanese were preparing a complex defensive posture, radically departing from any of their previous tactics. So successful was the Japanese preparation that it was discovered after the battle that the hundreds of tons of Allied bombs and thousands of rounds of heavy naval gunfire left the Japanese defenders almost unscathed and ready to inflict losses on the U.S. Marines unparalleled up to that point in the Pacific War.

==Planning and preparation==
{{Main|Planning for the Battle of Iwo Jima}}

===Japanese preparations===
By June 1944, Lieutenant General [[Tadamichi Kuribayashi]] was assigned to command the defense of Iwo Jima. Kuribayashi knew that Japan could not win the battle, but he hoped to inflict massive casualties on the American forces, so that the United States would reconsider the [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion of Japan]].

While drawing inspiration from the defense in the [[Battle of Peleliu]], Kuribayashi designed a defense that broke with Japanese military doctrine. Rather than establish his defenses on the beach to oppose the landings directly, he created strong, mutually supporting defensive [[defense in depth|positions in depth]] using static and heavy weapons such as heavy machine guns and artillery, while Colonel Baron [[Takeichi Nishi]]'s tanks were used as camouflaged artillery positions. Because the tunnel linking it to the main forces was never completed, Kuribayashi organized the southern area of the island in and around [[Mount Suribachi]] as a semi-independent sector, while the main defensive zone was built in the north. The expected American naval and air bombardment further prompted the creation of an extensive system of tunnels that connected the prepared positions, so that a pillbox that had been cleared could be reoccupied. The network of bunkers and pillboxes greatly favored the defender. Hundreds of hidden artillery and mortar positions along with land mines were placed all over the island. Among the Japanese weapons were [[320 mm Type 98 mortar|{{convert|320|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} spigot mortar]]s and a variety of rockets. Numerous Japanese snipers and camouflaged machine gun positions were also present. Kuribayashi had specially engineered the defenses so that every part of the island was subject to Japanese fire. He also received a handful of ''[[kamikaze]]'' pilots to use against the enemy fleet (318 Americans were killed by them throughout the battle). Against his wishes, however, Tokyo forced Kuribayashi to erect beach defenses which were the only part of the island's defenses destroyed in the pre-landing bombardment.

==Invasion==
[[File:USS New York-11.jpg|thumb|The battleship {{USS|New York|BB-34|6}} firing her {{convert|356|mm|in|abbr=on}} main guns on the island, February 16, 1945]]

Starting on 15 June 1944, the U.S. began routine strikes against Iwo Jima that would become the longest and most intense conflict in the Pacific theater.&lt;ref group=&quot;National Park Service&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Chronology of the Battle of Iwo Jima|url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/wapa/indepth/pactheatercamp/iwo/chronology.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; These would be a combination of naval assaults and bombings that would go on for almost one year. Major General Harry Schmidt requested for a ten day shelling of the island before the land invasion, but was given only three, which were impaired by the weather conditions. Each heavy ship was given an area to fire on which combined with all the ships covered the entire island. A ship would fire for approximately six hours before stopping for a certain amount of time. The bombing continued until 19 February 1945 â the day of the invasion, operationally known as &quot;[[D-Day_(military_term)|D-Day]]&quot;. The limited bombardment had questionable success on the enemy due to the Japanese being heavily holed in and fortified. Still many bunkers and caves were destroyed during the bombing giving it a limited success. The Japanese had been preparing for the battle since March 1944, which gave them a heavy advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naval Gunfire|url= http://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/hyperwar/USN/rep/Iwo/Cominch/Iwo-2.html|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of the land invasion, more than 450 American ships were located off of Iwo Jima which would involve around 60,000 American Marines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Marine Corps War Memorial|url=http://www.gwu.edu/~memory/issues/museums/IwoJima.html| publisher=The George Washington University|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At 08:59, one minute ahead of schedule, the first of an eventual 30,000 Marines of the [[3rd Marine Division (United States)|3rd]], [[4th Marine Division (United States)|4th]], and [[5th Marine Division (United States)|5th Marine]] divisions, under [[V Amphibious Corps]], landed on the beach.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The initial wave was not hit by Japanese fire for quite some time; it was the plan of Japanese General Kuribayashi to hold fire until the beach was full of Marines and equipment.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Many of the Marines who landed on the beach in the first wave speculated that perhaps the naval artillery and air bombardment of the island had killed all of the Japanese troops that were expected to be defending the island.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; In the deathly silence, they became somewhat unnerved as Marine patrols began to advance inland in search of the Japanese positions.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; Only after the front wave of Marines reached a line of Japanese bunkers defended by machine gunners did they take hostile fire. Many cleverly concealed Japanese bunkers and firing positions lit up and the first wave of Marines took devastating losses from machine guns.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; Aside from the Japanese defenses situated on the beaches, the Marines faced heavy fire from Mount Suribachi at the south of the island. It was extremely difficult for the Marines to advance because of the inhospitable terrain, which consisted of volcanic ash. This ash allowed for neither a secure footing nor the construction of defensive foxholes to protect the Marines from hostile fire. However, the ash did help to absorb a portion of the fragments that were expelled by the Japanese artillery.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The Japanese heavy artillery in Suribachi would open their reinforced steel doors to fire and then immediately close their doors following to prevent counterfire from the American forces. This made it extremely difficult for American units to destroy a piece of Japanese artillery.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; To make matters worse for the American troops, the bunkers were connected to the elaborate tunnel system so that bunkers that were cleared with flamethrowers and grenades were reoccupied shortly afterwards by Japanese troops moving through the tunnels. This Japanese tactic caused many casualties among the Marines, as they walked past the reoccupied bunkers without expecting to suddenly take fresh fire from them.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The Marines advanced slowly while taking heavy machine gun and artillery fire. Due to the arrival of armored units, and heavy naval artillery and air units maintaining a heavy base of fire on Suribachi, the Marines were eventually able to advance past the beaches.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; 760 Marines made a near-suicidal charge across to the other side of Iwo Jima that day. They took heavy casualties, but they made a considerable advance. By the evening, the mountain had been cut off from the rest of the island, and 30,000 Marines had landed. About 40,000 more would follow.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

In the days after the landings, the Marines expected a [[banzai attack|''banzai'' attack]] during the night. This had been the standard Japanese final defense strategy in previous battles against enemy ground forces in the Pacific (such as the [[Battle of Saipan]]), during which the majority of the Japanese attackers would be killed and the Japanese strength greatly reduced. However Kuribayashi had strictly forbidden ''banzai'' charges because he considered them futile.&lt;ref name= Allen/&gt; The fighting was extremely fierce. The Americans' advance was stalled by numerous defensive positions augmented by artillery, where they were ambushed by Japanese troops who occasionally sprang out of tunnels. At night, the Japanese would leave their defenses under cover of darkness to attack American foxholes, and battleships fired star shells to deny them cover of darkness. Many Japanese soldiers who knew English would deliberately call for Navy corpsmen, and then shoot them as they approached.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; The Marines learned that firearms were relatively ineffective against the Japanese defenders and effectively used flamethrowers and grenades to flush out Japanese troops in the tunnels. One of the technological innovations of the battle, the eight [[M4 Sherman|Sherman M4A3R3]] medium tanks [[Flame tank|equipped with a flamethrower]] (&quot;Ronson&quot; or &quot;Zippo&quot; tanks), proved very effective at clearing Japanese positions. The Shermans were difficult to disable, such that defenders were often compelled to assault them in the open, where the Japanese troops would fall victim to the superior numbers of Marines.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; [[Close air support]] (CAS) was initially provided by fighters from [[escort carrier]]s off the coast. This shifted over to the [[15th Fighter Group]], flying P-51 Mustangs, after they arrived on the island on 6 March. Similarly, illumination rounds (flares) which were used to light up the battlefield at night were initially provided by ships, shifting over later to landing force artillery. [[Code talker|Navajo code talker]]s were part of the American ground communications, along with [[walkie-talkie]]s and [[SCR-610]] backpack radio sets.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

After running out of water, food, and most supplies, the Japanese troops became desperate towards the end of the battle. Kuribayashi, who had argued against banzai attacks at the start of the battle, realized that Japanese defeat was imminent. Marines began to face increasing numbers of nighttime attacks; these were only repelled by a combination of machine gun defensive positions and artillery support. At times, the Marines engaged in hand-to-hand fighting to repel the Japanese attacks.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt; With the landing area secure, more troops and heavy equipment came ashore and the invasion proceeded north to capture the airfields and the remainder of the island. Most Japanese soldiers fought to the death.&lt;ref name=Allen/&gt;

==Raising the flag==

[[File:Stars and Stripes on Mount Suribachi (Iwo Jima).jpg|thumb|upright|U.S. flag over Mount Suribachi]]

&quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; is a historic photograph taken on 23 February 1945 by Joe Rosenthal. It depicts five Marines and a [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] [[corpsman]] raising the flag of the United States atop Mount Suribachi.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;/&gt; The photograph was extremely popular, being reprinted in thousands of publications. Later, it became the only photograph to win the Pulitzer Prize for Photography in the same year as its publication, and ultimately came to be regarded as one of the most significant and recognizable images of the war, and possibly the most reproduced photograph of all time.&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;/&gt; Of the six men depicted in the picture, three ([[Franklin Sousley]], [[Harlon Block]], and [[Michael Strank]]) did not survive the battle; the three survivors ([[John Bradley (Navy)|John Bradley]], [[Rene Gagnon]], and [[Ira Hayes]]) became celebrities upon the publication of the photo. For a while, it was believed that the man now known to be Block was actually [[Hank Hansen]], but Hayes set the record straight. The picture was later used by [[Felix de Weldon]] to sculpt the [[Marine Corps War Memorial]], located adjacent to [[Arlington National Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ap&quot;/&gt;

By the morning of 23 February, Mount Suribachi was effectively cut off from the rest of the island â above ground. By then, the Marines knew that the Japanese defenders had an extensive network of below-ground defenses, and knew that in spite of its isolation above ground, the volcano was still connected to Japanese defenders via the tunnel network. They expected a fierce fight for the summit. Two four-man patrols were sent up the volcano to reconnoiter routes on the mountain's north face. Popular legend (embroidered by the press in the aftermath of the release of the famous photo) has it that the Marines fought all the way up to the summit. The American riflemen expected an ambush, but none materialized. The Marines did encounter small groups of Japanese defenders on Suribachi, but the majority of the Japanese troops stayed in the tunnel network and only occasionally attacked in small groups and were generally all killed. The patrols made it to the summit and scrambled down again, reporting the lack of enemy contact to Colonel Chandler Johnson.&lt;ref name=Allen&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=Robert E.|year=2004|title=The First Battalion of the 28th Marines on Iwo Jima: A Day-by-Day History from Personal Accounts and Official Reports, with Complete Muster Rolls|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, N.C.|isbn=0786405600| oclc=41157682}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson then called for a platoon of Marines to climb Suribachi; with them, he sent a small American flag to fly if they reached the summit. Again, Marines began the ascent, expecting to be ambushed at any moment, but reached the top of Mount Suribachi without incident. Using a length of pipe they found among the wreckage atop the mountain, the Marines hoisted the U.S. flag over Mount Suribachi: the first foreign flag to fly on Japanese soil.&lt;ref name= LAT_20070626&gt;{{cite news|accessdate=November 30, 2008|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jun/26/local/me-lindberg26|title=Charles Lindberg, 86; Marine helped raise first U.S. flag over Iwo Jima|date=June 26, 2007|page=B8|work=The Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; A photograph of this &quot;first flag raising&quot; was taken by photographer [[Louis R. Lowery]].

As the flag went up, Secretary of the Navy [[James Forrestal]] had just landed on the beach at the foot of Mount Suribachi and decided that he wanted the flag as a souvenir. Popular legend has it that Colonel Johnson wanted the flag for himself, but, in fact, he believed that the flag belonged to the [[2nd Battalion 28th Marines]], who had captured that section of the island. Johnson sent Sergeant Mike Strank to take a second (larger) flag up the volcano to replace the first. As the first flag came down, the second went up. It was after the second flag went up that Rosenthal took the famous photograph &quot;Raising the Flag on Iwo Jima&quot; of the replacement flag being planted on the mountain's summit.

==Northern Iwo Jima==
[[File:Browning M1917 Marine Iwo Jima fixed.jpg|thumb|A U.S. Marine firing his [[M1917 Browning machine gun|Browning M1917]] machine gun at the Japanese]]

Despite Japan's loss of Mount Suribachi on the south end of the island, the Japanese still held strong positions on the north end. The rocky terrain vastly favored defense, even more so than Mount Suribachi. Coupled with this, the fortifications constructed by Kuribayashi were more impressive than at the Southern end of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Wheeler, ''THE ROAD TO TOKYO'', Time-Life Books, 1979, Alexandria, Virginia, p.50&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining under the command of Kuribayashi was the equivalent of eight infantry battalions, a tank regiment, and two artillery and three heavy mortar battalions. Also he had about 5,000 gunners and naval infantry. The most arduous task left to the Marines was the overtaking of the Motoyama Plateau with its distinctive Hill 382 and Turkey knob and the area in between referred to as the Amphitheater. This formed the basis of what came to be known as the &quot;meatgrinder&quot;. While this was being achieved on the right flank, the left was clearing out Hill 362 with just as much difficulty. The overall objective at this point was to take control of airfield no. 2 in the center of the island. However, every &quot;penetration seemed to become a disaster&quot; as &quot;units were raked from the flanks, chewed upâsometimes wiped out. Tanks were destroyed by interlocking fire or were hoisted into the air on the spouting fireballs of buried mines&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Leckie, DELIVERED FROM EVIL, Harper &amp; Row, 1987, New York, p870&lt;/ref&gt; As a result the fighting bogged down with Americans casualties piling up. Even capturing these points was not a solution to the problem since a previously secured position could be attacked from the rear by the use of the tunnels and hidden pillboxes. As such, it was said that &quot;they could take these heights at will, and then regret it&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Leckie, p.871&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marines nevertheless found ways to prevail under the circumstances. It was observed that during bombardments, the Japanese would hide their guns and themselves in the caves only to reappear when the troops would advance and lay devastating fire on them. The Japanese had over time learned basic American strategy which was to lay heavy bombardment before an infantry attack. Consequently, General Erskine ordered the [[9th Marine Regiment (United States)|9th Marine Regiment]] to attack under the cover of darkness with no preliminary barrage. This came to be a resounding success with many soldiers taken out while still sleeping. This was a key moment in the capture of hill 362.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Leckie, p.872&quot;&gt;Robert Leckie, p.872&lt;/ref&gt; It held such importance that the Japanese organized a counterattack the following night. Although Kuribayashi had forbidden the suicide charges familiar with other battles in the Pacific, the commander of the area decided on a banzai charge with the optimistic goal of recapturing Mount Suribachi. Captain Samaji Inouye and his 1,000 men charged the American position inflicting 347 casualties (90 deaths). The Marines counted 784 dead Japanese soldiers the next day.&lt;ref&gt;Keith Wheeler&lt;/ref&gt; There was also a ''kamikaze'' air attack (the only one of the battle) on the ships anchored at sea on 21 February, which resulted in the sinking of the escort carrier {{USS|Bismarck Sea|CVE-95|6}}, severe damage to {{USS|Saratoga|CV-3|6}} and slight damage to the escort carrier {{USS|Lunga Point||6}}, an LST and a transport.&lt;ref name=&quot;Robert Leckie, p.872&quot;/&gt;

Although the island was declared secure at 18:00 on 16 March, 25 days after the landings, the 5th Marine Division still faced Kuribayashi's stronghold in a gorge {{convert|640|m|yd|abbr=on}} long at the northwestern end of the island. On 21 March, the Marines destroyed the command post in the gorge with four tons of explosives and on March 24, Marines sealed the remaining caves at the northern tip of the island.&lt;ref&gt;Moskin, pp.372â373&lt;/ref&gt; However, on the night of 25 March, a 300-man Japanese force launched a final [[counterattack]] in the vicinity of Airfield No. 2. Army pilots, [[Seabee]]s and Marines of the 5th Pioneer Battalion and [[28th Marine Regiment|28th Marines]] fought the Japanese force for up to 90 minutes but suffered heavy casualties (53 were killed, and another 120 were wounded).{{citation needed|date=January 2009}} Two Marines from the 36th Depot Company, an all-African-American unit, received the [[Bronze Star]]. 1st Lieutenant [[Harry L.

Nalt|accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although still a matter of speculation because of conflicting accounts from surviving Japanese veterans, it has been said that Kuribayashi led this final assault,&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;/&gt; which unlike the loud ''banzai'' charge of previous battles, was characterised as a silent attack. If ever proven true, Kuribayashi would have been the highest ranking Japanese officer to have personally led an attack during World War II. Additionally, this would also be Kuribayashi's final act, a departure from the normal practice of the commanding Japanese officers committing [[seppuku]] behind the lines while the rest perished in the ''banzai'' charge, as happened during the battles of [[Saipan]] and [[Okinawa]]. The island was officially declared secure at 09:00 on 26 March.

==Weapons==
[[File:Flamethrower-iwo-jima-194502.jpg|thumb|left|upright|right|A flamethrower operator of Co. E, [[2nd Battalion 9th Marines]] runs under fire on Iwo Jima]]
A weapon heavily used in the Pacific was the United States [[M1A1 Flamethrower|M2A1]] flamethrower. Featuring two tanks containing fuel and compressed gas the mixture combines to produce a force shooting flame out of the tip.&lt;ref group=&quot;Division of Military History and Diplomacy, National Museum of American History&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Flamethrower|url=http://americanhistory.si.edu/militaryhistory/collection/object.asp?ID=246|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, these flamethrowers were used to kill Japanese holed into pillboxes, buildings and caves. A battalion would assign one flamethrower per platoon with one reserve flamethrower in each group. Flamethrower operators were usually in more danger than regular troops as the short range of their weapon required close combat, and the visibility of the flames on the battlefield made them a prominent target for snipers. Still they were essential to breaking the enemy and one battalion commander called the flamethrower the âbest single weapon of the operationâ&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flame Thrower in the Pacific: Marianas to Okinawa|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/chemsincmbt/ch15.htm|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marines later experimented putting flamethrowers on tanks which were also deployed during battle. Their effectiveness was more limited due to the rough terrain of Iwo Jima. A flamethrower tank would have a range of approximately {{convert|100|yd|m|abbr=on}}, carry 300 gallons of fuel and have a firing time of 150 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Flame Thrower in the Pacific: Marianas to Okinawa|url=http://www.history.army.mil/books/wwii/chemsincmbt/ch15.htm|accessdate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Captured Japanese flag on Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines pose on top of enemy pillbox with a captured Japanese flag]]

Of the 22,060 Japanese soldiers entrenched on the island, 21,844 died either from fighting or by ritual suicide. Only 216 were captured during the battle.  According to The official Navy Department Library website,âThe 36-day (Iwo Jima) assault resulted in more than 26,000 American casualties, including 6,800 dead.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/battleiwojima.htm|title=Battle for Iwo Jima, 1945 |publisher=The Navy Department Library |date=16 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To put that into context, the 82-day Battle for Okinawa lasted from early April until mid-June 1945 and U.S. (5 Army and 2 Marine Corps Divisions) casualties were over 62,000 of whom over 12,000 were killed or missing ; while the Battle of the Bulge lasted 40 days (16 Dec 44 â 25 Jan 45) with almost 90,000 U.S. casualties; 19,000 killed, 47,500 wounded, and 23,000 captured or missing.

Iwo Jima was also the only U.S. Marine battle where the American casualties exceeded the Japanese,&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Brien&quot;/&gt; although Japanese combat deaths numbered three times as many American deaths. 2 US Marines were captured as POWs during the battle, though neither of them survived their captivity. USS ''Bismarck Sea'' had also been lost, as the last U.S. aircraft carrier sunk in World War II.&lt;ref name=&quot;morison&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Morison|first= Samuel Eliot|authorlink=Samuel Eliot Morison|origyear=1960|year=2002|title=Victory in the Pacific, 1945|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Urbana, IL|isbn=0252070658|oclc=49784806| series=Volume 14 of ''[[History of United States Naval Operations in World War II]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because all the civilians had been evacuated, there were no civilian casualties at Iwo Jima, unlike at Saipan and Okinawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecom.usmc.mil/HD/This_Month_History/03_March.htm |title=Selected March Dates of Marine Corps Historical Significance|publisher=History Division, [[United States Marine Corps]]|accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Iwo Jima, it was estimated there were no more than 300 Japanese left alive in the island's warren of caves and tunnels. In fact, there were close to 3,000. The Japanese ''[[bushido]]'' code of honor, coupled with effective propaganda which portrayed American G.I.s as ruthless animals, prevented surrender for many Japanese soldiers. Those who could not bring themselves to commit suicide hid in the caves during the day and came out at night to prowl for provisions. Some did eventually surrender and were surprised that the Americans often received them with compassion, offering water, cigarettes, or coffee.&lt;ref name= Toland1970_p731&gt;{{cite book|first=John|last=Toland|title=The Rising Sun: The Decline and Fall of the Japanese Empire 1936â1945|location=New York|publisher=Random House|year=1970|page=731|oclc= 105915|isbn=0553264354}}&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these [[Japanese holdout|holdouts on the island]], two of Lieutenant Toshihiko Ohno's men, Yamakage Kufuku and Matsudo Linsoki, lasted six years without being caught and finally surrendered in 1951&lt;ref&gt;Toland, p. 737&lt;/ref&gt; (another source gives the date of surrender as January 6, 1949).&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanpela.com/holdouts/profiles/kufuku.html|first=Donald|last=Cook|title=Capture of Two Holdouts January 6, 1949|work=No Surrender: Japanese Holdouts|accessdate=2007-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategic importance==
Given the number of casualties, the necessity and long-term significance of the island's capture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/WW2Timeline/LUTZ/iwo.html|title=The Battle of Iwo Jima|publisher=History Department at the University of San Diego|accessdate= 2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the outcome of the war was a contentious issue from the beginning, and remains disputed. As early as April 1945, retired Chief of Naval Operations, William V. Pratt, asked in ''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine about the

{{bquote|expenditure of manpower to acquire a small, God-forsaken island, useless to the Army as a staging base and useless to the Navy as a fleet base ... [one] wonders if the same sort of airbase could not have been reached by acquiring other strategic localities at lower cost.&lt;ref name= Newsweek_Pratt_19450402&gt;{{cite news|first=William V.|last=Pratt|authorlink=William Veazie Pratt| title=What Makes Iwo Jima Worth the Price|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=April 2, 1945|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Pratt did not know, or else could not disclose, the need to take Iwo Jima for delivery of the atomic bomb. Iwo Jima was designated a crucial emergency landing point for the B-29s carrying the atomic bombs destined for Japan in late 1945, at least four months after the [[Invasion of Normandy|European D-Day]] (6 June 1944). The 509th Composite Group practiced mock emergency landings on Iwo Jima at its Utah base opened in December 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://afhra.maxwell.af.mil/rso/wings_groups_pages/0509og.asp|title=The 509CG Official History| publisher=Air Force Historical Studies Office|accessdate=2009-11-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; B-29s were not entirely reliable, and engine failure was common. Due to the scarcity of materials and engineering complexity, replacement of the bombs could take many months or even years. Thus planners feared that the loss of the bombs into the Pacific would have delayed the end of the war and potentially forced a full scale invasion of the Japanese mainland. Due to the extreme secrecy surrounding the [[Manhattan Project]], the [[United States Army Air Forces]] (USAAF) could not disclose or even hint at the critical need to take Iwo Jima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingproud.us/HistoryWhyIwoJima.html|title=Why Iwo Jima?|accessdate= 2009-11-30}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dinah Might at Iwo Jima.jpg|thumb|''Dinah Might'' surrounded by Marines and Seabees after emergency landing on Iwo Jima]]

The Japanese on Iwo Jima had [[radar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Newcomb|first=Richard F.|title=Iwo Jima |publisher=Holt Paperbacks|year=2002|page=59|url=http://books.google.com/?id=iPvmNzkuLn4C&amp;pg=PA59| isbn=0805070710}}&lt;/ref&gt; and were thus able to notify their comrades at home of incoming B-29 Superfortresses flying from the [[Mariana Islands]]. Fighter aircraft based on Iwo Jima sometimes attacked these planes, which were especially vulnerable on their way to Japan because they were heavily laden with bombs and fuel. Although the island was used as an [[air-sea rescue]] base after its seizure, the traditional justification for Iwo Jima's strategic importance to the United States' war effort has been that it provided a landing and refueling site for American bombers on missions to and from Japan. As early as 4 March 1945, while fighting was still taking place, the B-29 ''Dinah Might'' of the USAAF [[9th Bomb Group]] reported it was low on fuel near the island and requested an emergency landing. Despite enemy fire, the airplane landed on the Allied-controlled section of the island, without incident, and was serviced, refueled and departed. In all, 2,251 B-29 landings on Iwo Jima were recorded during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.506thfightergroup.org/iwotojapan.asp |title=Iwo To Japan|publisher=506th Fighter Group| accessdate=2010-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moskin records that 1,191 fighter escorts and 3,081 strike sorties were flown from Iwo Jima against Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The U.S. Marine Corps Story|author= Moskin, J.Robert|publisher=Little, Brown and Company|page=373|year=1992|edition=3rd Revised|isbn=044822688X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lessons learned on Iwo Jima served as guidelines for the following [[Battle of Okinawa]] and the [[Operation Downfall|planned invasion of the Japanese homeland]]. For example, &quot;because of the casualties taken at Iwo Jima on the first day, it was decided to make the preparatory bombardment the heaviest yet delivered on to a Pacific island&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, THE SECOND WORLD WAR, Penguin books, 1989, p.566&lt;/ref&gt; Also, in the plan for the attack on the main islands, it was taken into account that around a third of the troops committed to Iwo Jima and again at Okinawa had died.&lt;ref&gt;John Keegan, p.575&lt;/ref&gt; None of these calculations played much if any of a role in the original decision to invade, however, which was almost entirely based on the USAAF's belief that the island would be a useful base for long-range fighter escorts. These escorts proved both impractical and unnecessary, and only ten such missions were ever flown from Iwo Jima.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Assistant Chief of Air Staff|title=Iwo, B-29 Haven and Fighter Springboard|work=Impact|date=SeptemberâOctober 1945| pages=69â71}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other justifications are also debatable. Although some Japanese interceptors were based on Iwo Jima, their impact on the American bombing effort was marginal; in the three months before the invasion only 11 B-29s were lost as a result.&lt;ref name=Craven1953&gt;{{cite book| last=Craven|first=Wesley Frank|coauthors=James Lea Cate|title=The Army Air Forces in World War II| year=1953|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|oclc=704158|pages=5:581â82| isbn=0226119955}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Superfortresses found it unnecessary to make any major detour around the island.&lt;ref&gt;Craven and Cate, 5:559.&lt;/ref&gt; The capture of Iwo Jima did not affect the Japanese early-warning radar system, which continued to receive information on incoming B-29s from the island of [[Rota (island)|Rota]] (which was never attacked).&lt;ref&gt;Joint War Planning Committee 306/1, &quot;Plan for the Seizure of Rota Island,&quot; January 25, 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; Some downed B-29 crewmen were saved by air-sea rescue aircraft and vessels operating from the island, but Iwo Jima was only one of many islands that could have been used for such a purpose. As for the importance of the island as a landing and refueling site for bombers, Marine Captain Robert Burrell, then a history instructor at the [[United States Naval Academy]], suggested that only a small proportion of the 2,251 landings were for genuine emergencies, the great majority possibly being for minor technical checkups, training, or refueling. According to Burrell,

{{bquote|this justification became prominent only after the Marines seized the island and incurred high casualties. The tragic cost of Operation ''Detachment'' pressured veterans, journalists, and commanders to fixate on the most visible rationalization for the battle. The sight of the enormous, costly, and technologically sophisticated B-29 landing on the island's small airfield most clearly linked Iwo Jima to the strategic bombing campaign. As the myths about the flag raisings on Mount Suribachi reached legendary proportions, so did the emergency landing theory in order to justify the need to raise that flag.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert S.|last=Burrell|title=Breaking the Cycle of Iwo Jima Mythology: A Strategic Study of Operation ''Detachment''|journal=[[The Journal of Military History]]|volume=68|issue=4|month=October|year=2004|pages=1143â1186| doi=10.1353/jmh.2004.0175|oclc=37032245}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nevertheless, in promoting his expanded exploration of the issue, ''The Ghosts of Iwo Jima'', Burrell's publishers also claim that the very losses formed the basis for a &quot;reverence for the Marine Corps&quot; that not only embodied the &quot;American national spirit&quot; but ensured the &quot;institutional survival&quot; of the Marine Corps.&lt;ref name=&quot;tamu&quot;&gt;{{cite web|year=2006|url=http://www.tamu.edu/upress/BOOKS/2006/burrell.htm|title=The Ghosts of Iwo Jima|publisher=Texas A&amp;M University Press| accessdate=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
[[File:MemorialonMtSuribachi.jpg|thumb|left|The memorial on top of Suribachi]]
[[File:60th Reunion 2005.jpg|thumb|The 60th anniversary Reunion at the Japanese part of the memorial]]

The [[United States Navy]] has commissioned several ships of the name {{USS|Iwo Jima||6}}.

On February 19, 1985, the 40th anniversary of the landings, an event called the Reunion of Honor was held. The veterans of both sides who fought in the battle of Iwo Jima attended the event. The place was the invasion beach where U.S. forces landed. A memorial on which inscriptions were engraved by both sides was built at the center of the meeting place. Japanese attended at the mountain side, where the Japanese inscription was carved, and Americans attended at the shore side, where the English inscription was carved. After unveiling and offering of flowers were made, the representatives of both countries approached the memorial; upon meeting, they shook hands. The combined Japan-U.S. [[funeral|memorial service]] of the 50th anniversary of the battle was held in front of the monument in February 1995. Further memorial services have been held on later anniversaries.

The importance of the battle to Marines today is demonstrated in pilgrimages made to the island, and specifically the summit of Suribachi.&lt;ref name=&quot;MarinesMag&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.mcnews.info/mcnewsinfo/marines/2007/20072nd/onliberty/Suribachi.shtml|title=From Black Sands to Suribachiâs Summit: Marines Reflect on Historic Battle|last=Blumenstein|first=LCpl Richard |coauthors=Sgt.

==Medal of Honor awards==
{{Main|List of Medal of Honor recipients for the Battle of Iwo Jima}}

The Medal of Honor is the highest [[Awards and decorations of the United States military|military decoration]] awarded by the [[United States government]]. It is bestowed on a member of the United States armed forces who distinguishes himself by &quot;...conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States...&quot; Because of its nature, the medal is commonly awarded posthumously; since its creation during the American Civil War it has only been presented 3,464 times. During this one-month-long battle, 27 U.S. military personnel were awarded the Medal of Honor for their actions, 13 of them posthumously. Of the 27 medals awarded for the actions at Iwo Jima, 22 were presented to [[United States Marine Corps|Marines]] and five were presented to [[United States Navy]] sailors; this was 28% of the 82 Medals of Honor awarded to Marines in the entirety of World War II.&lt;ref name=MOHSTAT&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-06|url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/moh/mohstats.html|title=United States Army Center of Military History Medal of Honor Citations Archive |work=Medal Of Honor Statistics|publisher=[[United States Army Center of Military History]]|date= July 16, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
