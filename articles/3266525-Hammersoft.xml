The '''Blue Eagle Gym''' is a gymnasium located in the main campus of the [[Ateneo de Manila University]] in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]]. Unlike most gymnasiums, the basketball court is oriented perpendicular to the orientation of the building. For a time, it was officially known as the '''Loyola Center'''.

The stadium was built in 1949, three years before the Ateneo de Manila moved from its Manila campus to its current campus in Loyola Heights in 1952.

According to historical records, the gym was constructed under the direction of Ateneo Rector William F. Masterson, S.J., to be an alternative venue to the [[Rizal Memorial Coliseum]] for the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] games.

It is frequently a venue for sporting events of the [[University Athletic Association of the Philippines]] and the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association (Philippines)|National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (pre-[[1978]]). Ateneo's games, however, were played at the Rizal Coliseum to prevent any home-court advantage during the NCAA years.

It was also a venue for [[Philippine Basketball Association]] games in the league's early years. The [[Manila Metrostars]] of the defunct [[Metropolitan Basketball Association]] also used the Blue Eagle Gym as a temporary home court before moving to the [[Mail and More Arena]] in San Andres, Manila.

The stadium played host to the sepak takraw tournament of the [[1991 Southeast Asian Games]]. It was scheduled to be the venue for women's basketball in the [[2005 Southeast Asian Games]], but since the [[Basketball Association of the Philippines]] was suspended by [[FIBA]], the gymnasium was not able to host the event. 
The gymnasium is the home of the [[Ateneo Blue Eagles]], [[Ateneo de Manila University]]'s varsity team.
