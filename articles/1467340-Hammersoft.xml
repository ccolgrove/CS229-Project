The '''28th New Brunswick general election''' was held on November 18, 1974, to elect 58 members to the [[48th New Brunswick Legislative Assembly]], the governing house of the [[Provinces and territories of Canada|province]] of [[New Brunswick]], [[Canada]]. It saw [[Richard Hatfield]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick]] win its second [[majority government]] with a gain of one seat despite losing the [[popular vote]] to [[Robert J. Higgins|Robert Higgins']] [[New Brunswick Liberal Party]]. It was the second election in a row in which the Conservatives received a majority in the parlieament despite receiving fewer votes than the Liberals.

Despite the Hatfield government's involvement in the failed [[Bricklin SV-1]] automobile plant, and a series of kickback schemes, there were few surprises during the campaign. Hatfield had made inroads in the [[Acadian]] community since the [[New Brunswick general election, 1970|1970 election]], winning three [[francophone]] seats in [[by-election]]s. The Acadian support proved key during Hatfield's entire term as premier. 

This was the first election which saw candidates contest single member ridings; previous elections had each county as an electoral district electing a varying number of members based on their respective populations.
