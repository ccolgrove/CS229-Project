&quot;'''Garageland'''&quot; is a song by English [[punk rock]] band [[The Clash]] featured as the final track for their 1977 debut album ''[[The Clash (album)|The Clash]]''.

The song was penned by [[Joe Strummer]] as a response to music journalist [[Charles Shaar Murray]], who, after a gig in 1976, wrote a review saying that they were &quot;the kind of garage band who should be returned to the garage immediately&quot;, and also to both the fans and the record company, with which they had signed a contract for Â£100,000 on 25 January 1977,{{Sfn|Gray|2005|p=216}} that they would still remain the same as they were before the signing.{{Sfn|Coon|1977}}

 | quote  = I never want that to happen. After our second gig a critic in ''[[NME|New Musical Express]]'' wrote that we should be returned to the garage and locked in with a motor running so that we died. &quot;Garageland&quot; is about that. I was trying to say that this is where we come from and we know it, and we're not going to get out of our depth. Even though we've signed with [[Columbia Records|C.B.S.]] we arenât going to float off into the atmosphere like the [[Pink Floyd]] or anything.

 | quote  = Joe was really excited about this idea of a garage band, that led to the song &quot;Garageland&quot;. He really thought, âWe belong in a garage.â He'd hit on something like that and get very, very excited and live off that for a few days. Then he'd be depressed about something else and he'd come in and say, âWe're not really a garage band at all.â

Upon [[The Clash]]'s early appearance at the [[Sex Pistols]] [[The Screen On The Green|Screen on the Green]] concert, [[Charles Shaar Murray]], an ''[[NME]]'' critic, produced a damning review of the band:

:The Clash are the kind of garage band who should be returned to the garage immediately, preferably with the engine running,{{Sfn|Murray 2003}}{{Sfn|Westway 2001}}{{Sfn|Needs|2004}} which would undoubtedly be more of a loss to their friends and families than to either rock or roll.{{Sfn|Screen on the Green}}{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006|p=162}}

:Followed by:

:Their guitarist on the extreme left, allegedly known as [[Joe Strummer]], has good moves but he and the band are a little shaky on ground that involves starting, stopping and changing chords at approximately the same time.{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006|p=162}}

The Clash reacted immediately by writing the song &quot;Garageland&quot;,{{Sfn|Salewicz|2006|p=162}} whose opening verses are: &quot;''Back in the garage with my bullshit detector'' / ''[[Carbon monoxide]] makes sure it's effective''&quot;, followed by the chorus: &quot;''We're a garage band'' / ''We come from garageland''&quot;, and concluding with &quot;''Back in the garage''&quot;.{{sfn|Coon|1977}}

Another theme in the song is about the band signing to [[CBS Records]] on 25 January 1977 for Â£100,000.{{Sfn|Gray|2005|p=216}}  The music press and fans criticized The Clash for having &quot;sold out&quot; to the establishment.{{Sfn|Gray|2005|p=217}}  [[Mark Perry (musician)|Mark Perry]], founder of the leading London punk periodical, ''[[Sniffin' Glue]]'', let loose with what he would later call his &quot;big quote&quot;: &quot;Punk died the day The Clash signed to CBS.&quot;{{Sfn|Gray|2005|p=218}}  This was evidenced in the verses: &quot;''Meanwhile things are hotting up in the West End alright'' / ''Contracts in the offices and groups in the night'' / ''My bumming slumming friends have got new boots'' / ''And someone just asked me if the group would wear suits''&quot;, and, after the chorus, with the following lines: &quot;''I don't want to know about what the rich are doing'' / ''I don't want to go to where the rich are going'' / ''They think they're so clever, they think they're so right'' / ''But the truth is only known by gutter snipes''&quot;.{{sfn|Coon|1977}}

&quot;Garageland&quot;, as well as the majority of the band's [[The Clash (album)|debut studio album]], was conceived on the 18th floor of a [[Council house|council high rise]] on London's [[Harrow Road]], in a flat that was rented by [[Mick Jones (The Clash)|Jones]]' grandmother, who frequently went to see the band rehearsing.{{Sfn|NME 1991}}  The song was recorded at [[CBS]] Whitfield Street Studio No. 3 on 27 February 1977. The tapes for the entire album were delivered to CBS at the start of March and the recording was released in the United Kingdom through [[CBS Records]] on 8 April 1977. The album was engineered by CBS staff engineer Simon Humphrey and produced by Clash live [[Audio engineering|soundman]] Mickey Foote.{{Sfn|Mojo Classic|p=32}}

The song made its live debut on 10â11 March 1977, on the first and second night of an early gig at The Coliseum in [[Harlesden]], [[London]], where the band was supported by [[Subway Sect]], [[Buzzcocks]], and [[The Slits]].{{Sfn|Harlesden Roxy 1977}}  From that moment to 1985, the song has become a stable part of the setlists of their future tours and concerts, and has graced stages all over the world.
