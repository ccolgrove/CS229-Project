==Demographics==

Mott Haven is a high density neighborhood with a population roughly 50,000 within a square mile. The neighborhood consists primarily of Latin Americans, predominantly Puerto Ricans. Like most neighborhoods in New York City the vast majority of households are renter occupied. Over half the population lives below the poverty line and receives public assistance ([[Aid to Families with Dependent Children|AFDC]], Home Relief, [[Supplemental Security Income]], and [[Medicaid]]). However there is significant income diversity on a block by block basis. Around the turn of the century the non-Hispanic White population, consisting primarily of high income earners, has been on the rise along with a decline in the non-Hispanic Black population.

==Land use and terrain==

Mott Haven is dominated by tenement style apartment buildings and large public housing complexes. There are three historical district consisting of brownstone style rowhouses. In the last two decades, construction of modern 2 and 3 unit row-houses and apartment buildings have increased the percentage of owners versus renters. The neighborhood contains one of the highest concentrations of NYCHA projects in the Bronx. The total land area is roughly one square miles. The terrain is low laying and flat though somewhat hilly around St. Mary's Park.

[[File:1 Bruckner Blvd western jeh.jpg|thumb|left|1 Bruckner Boulevard]]
The area that is now called Mott Haven was originally owned by the Morris family. A small part of the larger swath of land known as [[Morrisania]], it was purchased by [[Jordan Lawrence Mott]] for his iron works in 1849. A vestige of the iron works can be seen just west of the Third Ave. bridge on E. 134th St. [[St. Ann's Church Complex (Bronx, New York)|St. Ann's Church]] ([[ECUSA]]) on St. Ann's Avenue is the resting place of [[Lewis Morris]], [[Gouverneur Morris]] and other members of that powerful colonial family, and a [[National Register of Historic Places listings in Bronx County, New York|Registered Historic Place]].

As the city below grew, the area quickly developed residentially. At the same time, an upper-middle class residential area, marked by brownstones built in an elaborate and architecturally daring fashion, started to grow along Alexander Avenue by the 1890s. (Doctors Row a/k/a the Irish Fifth Ave.) A series of brownstones on E. 134th St, east of Willis Ave., was known as Judges' Row. Soon after, the Bronx grew more quickly, especially with public transit into the area, including the [[IRT Ninth Avenue Line]]. By the early 20th century, the population density of the area supported the construction of many tenement style apartment buildings.

From the end of the 19th century through the 1940s, Mott Haven was a mixed German-American (north of E. 145th St.)and Irish-American neighborhood (south of E. 145th St), with an Italian enclave west of Lincoln Ave. The derogatory term &quot;pig&quot; for a policeman is thought to have originated here because of a tough Irish cop who wielded his night stick on Willis Ave. drunks without mercy, known as Paddy the Pig of the 40 Pct.

One of the largest parades in NYC took place here in the late 1940s and early 1950s. It was organized by Sean Oglaigh na hEirann, the veterans of the [[Irish Republican Army]], who marched every Easter Sunday, down Willis Ave. from the Hub to E. 138th st., thence west to St. Jerome's. The Star of Munster Ballroom at the NE corner of Willis Ave. and E. 138th St., was a center of Irish music for decades. It was speculated at one time that there were more bars on Willis Ave than on any other city street, given its short distance. More recorded Irish musicians lived in Mott haven than in any place outside of Ireland.

The first Puerto Rican settlements came in the late 1940s along the length of Brook Ave. African-Americans came into the area when Patterson Houses were built.

Mott Haven and Port Morris were the first neighborhoods to give rise to the term &quot;South Bronx&quot;. Together, they were originally known as the North Side or North New York. This area was part of New York County after the incorporation of Greater NY in 1898. The [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] at Third Ave. and E. 137th St., was originally the North Side Board of Trade Bldg (1912). It later became the North Side Savings Bank, which became Dollar Dry Dock, which became Chase.

In the 1940s when the Bronx was usually divided into the East Bronx and West Bronx, a group of social workers identified a pocket of poverty on East 134th Street, east of Brown Place and called it the South Bronx. This pocket of poverty would spread in part due to an illegal practice known as [[blockbusting]] and to [[Robert Moses]] building several housing projects in the neighborhood. The poverty greatly expanded northward, following the post-war phenomenon colloquially referred to as [[white flight]], reaching a peak in the 1960s when the socioeconomic North Bronx-South Bronx boundary reached Fordham Road. At this time a wave of arson destroyed or damaged many of the residential, commercial, and industrial structures in the area. 

Today the North Bronx-South Bronx distinction remains more common than the traditional East Bronx-West Bronx distinction, and some still regard [[Fordham Road]] as the boundary. Though crime has declined versus the highs of the crack epidemic and revitalization of former abandoned properties is taking place the neighborhood continues to deal with serious crime issues due to its significant population in poverty. There have been significant strides to increase gentrification of the neighborhood by those in the real estate sector however the primary newcomers have been poor and working class. There have been increasing populations of young professional high income earners taking advantage of the more affordable properties, but not close in comparison to that of Northern Brooklyn. The area will likely continue to be lower income for some time due to the fact most of the new housing being built has income ceilings along with all the rest of rent controlled property that already exist.

However Mott Haven was home to the Bronx first organic market and has seen significant improvements in terms of quality of life.

The area is patrolled by the 40th Precinct located at 257 Alexander Avenue. NYCHA property in the area is patrolled by P.S.A. 7 at 737 Melrose Avenue located in the [[Melrose, Bronx|Melrose]] section of the Bronx.
