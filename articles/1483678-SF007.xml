'''TelevisÃ£o Independente''' ('''TVI''')  is  [[Portugal]]'s fourth [[terrestrial television]] channel, launched in 1993. It has been leading audience ratings since 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mediacapital.pt/contentBusinessT1.aspx?hMenuID=25&amp;id=1&lt;/ref&gt; It competes directly with [[Sociedade Independente de ComunicaÃ§Ã£o|SIC]] and [[RTP1]].

==History==
TVI was the second private [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] TV channel to be launched, [[SIC (Portugal)|SIC]] having being launched five months before, and the fourth channel in all. Already under the name '''TVI''', but marketed as '''4''', in which the '4' was the sole element in its logo, TVI was initially owned by some prominent Catholic Church institutions, including [[RÃ¡dio RenascenÃ§a]], [[Universidade CatÃ³lica Portuguesa]] and UniÃ£o das MisericÃ³rdias; [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3 TelevisiÃ³n]], [[RTL Group|Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de TÃ©lÃ©diffusion]], [[Sonae]], [[SBS Broadcasting Group|SBS Broadcasting]], [[Yorkshire Television]] and many other media enterprises were minor stakeholders of TVI. This majority-Catholic ownership pushed TVI's programming in the direction of Christian values. In the first years of its existence, TVI assumed the role of an 'alternative' television broadcaster, dedicating segments of its airtime to distinct target audiences, with part of the morning dedicated to housewives and the elderly and part of the afternoon to the young.

During this period, TVI was known for its American series and movies, including ''[[The X-Files|X-Files]]'' and ''[[Baywatch]]'', and the Spanish show ''[[El gran juego de la oca]]'' (translated as ''O Jogo do Ganso'') imported from Antena 3. TVI also brought in some prominent names in Portuguese television, including [[Manuel LuÃ­s Goucha]] and [[Artur Albarran]], but the viewing figures had were always lower than expected and it entered into deep financial crisis.

TVI's recovery happened when it was totally acquired by [[Media Capital]] in 1999, one of the most important media conglomerates in Portugal, whereupon it started broadcasting more Portuguese-produced programmes, including soap operas. This helped to increase its audience significantly, but it was in September 2000, when [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]] started, that the channel gained a boost in popularity.

Now the most watched station in the country, TVI is known for having a large number of national reality shows and soap operas. It broadcasts a mix of local productions, such as soap operas, family series and reality shows, news programs and international movies and series (mostly American). It is currently owned by [[Media Capital]], which is owned by [[PRISA|Grupo Prisa]]. Until February 2007, Media Capital was co-owned by [[RTL Group]] and Grupo Prisa. The station works with Media Capital-owned production company Plural Entertainment to produce its national fictional content.

Unlike state broadcaster [[RÃ¡dio e TelevisÃ£o de Portugal|RTP]] and commercial rival [[Sociedade Independente de ComunicaÃ§Ã£o|SIC]], which have always shown foreign programmes in the original language with subtitles, TVI tried, unsuccessfully, to [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dub]] foreign programmes into [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] after achieving marginal success with Latin American Spanish-language soap operas dubbed in [[Brazilian Portuguese]]. Experiments of dubbing included the US series ''[[Dawson's Creek]]'' and other shows directed at younger audiences.

&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

== Criticism ==
TVI is much criticized as it broadcasts US television series such as [[House (TV series)|House]], [[The 4400]], [[Nip/Tuck]], [[NUMB3RS]], [[The Shield]] and [[The Office (US TV series)|The Office]] after midnight. TVI's prime time is reserved for in-house programming, mainly soap operas, [[quiz channel|viewer-participation quizzes]] and reality shows.

In July 2010, TVI censored a kiss between two male characters on the youth TV series [[Morangos com AÃ§Ãºcar]], due to pressure by a fundamentalist far-right organization, &quot;National Resistance&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cut has led to a major outcry, and has been widely perceived as an occurrence of [[homophobia]]. At least 10 [[civil society]] organizations called for the reinstatement of the cut scene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

TVI still broadcasts in [[4:3]] as of August 2011.
