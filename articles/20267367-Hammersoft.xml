The '''MarylandâPenn State football rivalry''' was an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played by the [[Maryland Terrapins football]] team of the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and the [[Penn State Nittany Lions football]] team of [[Pennsylvania State University]].

== Series history ==

The two teams first played in 1917. Penn State has thoroughly dominated this series throughout its entire existence, with Maryland winning only a single game and holding Penn State to a single tie. Penn State's record in the series is 35â1â1, with the longest winning streak being 24 games between 1962 and 1987.&lt;ref name=stassen&gt;[http://football.stassen.com/cgi-bin/records/opp-opp.pl?start=1869&amp;end=2007&amp;team1=Maryland&amp;team2=Penn+State Maryland vs. Penn State, 1869-2007], Stassen College Football Information, accessed 16 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The last game was played in 1993, when the series had run uninterrupted since 1984. There are currently no plans to revive the series, although inconclusive discussions between the schools have been conducted as recently as October 2008.&lt;ref name=disagree&gt;Jeff Barker, [http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/maryland_terps/blog/2008/10/marylandpenn_state_disagree_on_the_facts.html Maryland, Penn State disagree on the facts] ''Baltimore Sun'', October 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Penn State and Maryland met in briefly interrupted stretches between 1917 and 1993, with a near-consecutive run played all but three years between 1960 and 1993. The teams have not met since, most likely due to the disproportionate nature of the series. However, the one-sided record belies what was often a competitive match-up until its final years. While Maryland only compiled one win and one tie, numerous games were narrowly lost by missed [[field goal (football)|field goals]] and [[turnover (football)|turnovers]]. In 1985, for example, Maryland missed three field goals to eventually lose, 20â18.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=X3oUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=1QIEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5093,3262530 Penn State Staves Off Rally By Maryland To Win, 20-18], ''The Toledo Blade'', September 7, 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, a field goal attempt by placekicker Mike Sochko hit the upright with less than a minute remaining, and Maryland lost, 15â13.&lt;ref&gt;David Ungrady, [http://books.google.com/books?id=kty1Jvi1j0IC ''Tales from the Maryland Terrapins''], p. 198, Sports Publishing LLC, 2003, ISBN 1582616884.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from the painful memories for Maryland, both schools compete aggressively for recruits in the [[Baltimore-Washington metropolitan area]] and [[Delaware Valley|southeastern Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name=lure&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-103009.html Penn State's Lure Is Not A Good Sign for Maryland], ''The Washington Post'', February 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; When they did play, the game held recruiting implications for the entire mid-Atlantic. A more recent example of the recruiting competition is Baltimore-area player Antonio Logan-El, who made a verbal commitment to Maryland, but ultimately signed with Penn State on live television in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pennstate.scout.com/2/633051.html &quot;Antonio Logan-El Lowdown&quot;], ''Nittany Notes'', Scout.com, 05 April 2007, accessed 16 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.examiner.com/a-551406~The_signing_day_circus_arrives.html The signing day circus arrives], ''The Examiner'', February 7, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Penn State secured a large number of recruits from the Baltimore-Washington area with its 2006 class, including the 11th-overall [[2009 NFL Draft]] pick, defensive end [[Aaron Maybin]] of [[Ellicott City, Maryland]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtontimes.com/weblogs/d1scourse/2009/apr/30/ralphs-recruiting-address/ Ralph's recruiting class], ''[[The Washington Times]]'', April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; who had considered attending Maryland.&lt;ref name=lure/&gt;

While there are currently no known plans for future meetings, Maryland head coach [[Ralph Friedgen]] and Penn State athletic spokesman Jeff Nelson have both stated that the schools have undergone discussions in an attempt to schedule a rematch. For the time being, however, Maryland and Penn State have been unable to agree on the terms for a revival.&lt;ref name=disagree/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE2DE173EF93BA35752C1A961948260 &quot;College Football: East; Penn State Wins, 21-16&quot;], Associated Press, November 8, 1987, retrieved January 17, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Maryland officials alleged that Penn State demanded a two-to-one ratio of home games, which Penn State officials denied.&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Barker, [http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/maryland_terps/blog/2008/10/marylandpenn_state_disagree_on_the_facts.html Maryland, Penn State disagree on the facts], ''The Baltimore Sun'', October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
For Maryland, the lop-sided series has the lowest [[winning percentage]] (0.041) of any with more than four games played. This is considerably worse than the school's next least successful series: that against [[Florida State Seminoles football|Florida State]], with a winning percentage of 0.105 and record of 2â17. Not surprisingly, it is one of Penn State's most successful series (0.959).&lt;ref name=stassen/&gt;
