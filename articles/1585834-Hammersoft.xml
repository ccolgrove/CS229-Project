The '''Metropolitan Transport Corporation''' ({{lang-ta|à®®à®¾à®¨à®à®°à¯ à®ªà¯à®à¯à®à¯à®µà®°à®¤à¯à®¤à¯à®à¯à®à®´à®à®®à¯}}) (formerly known as '''Pallavan Transport Corporation Ltd.''') is the agency that operates the [[public transport]] [[bus]] service in [[Chennai]], [[India]]. It covers a maximum of 50&amp;nbsp;km radius around Chennai.

==History==
Metropolitan Transport Corporation ([[Chennai]] - Dn.I) Ltd was established on 1 January 1972 with a fleet strength of 1029 buses.  The operational [[jurisdiction]] is the [[Chennai]] Metropolitan area.  The Pallavan Transport Corporation was split into two and a new Corporation, namely, Dr. Ambedkar Transport Corporation Ltd. started functioning from 19 January 1994. Pallavan Transport Corporation was renamed as Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai Division â1) Limited,   Dr. Ambedkar Transport Corporation was re-named as Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai Division-II) Ltd., on 1 July 1997.  

In order to make the Corporations viable, and for better administrative control, Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai Division II) was amalgamated with Metropolitan Transport Corporation (Chennai Division I) Ltd in 10 January 2001. The fleet strength of the [[Corporation]] at 1 March 2009 was 3260 with 25 depots, a body building unit at [[Chromepet]], a ticket printing press at [[K.K.Nagar]] and Reconditioning Unit at Patullos Road.

* [http://www.thehindu.com/multimedia/dynamic/00214/Ajai_214855e.jpg  Number of MTC buses as on 24/08/2010]

'''Single-deckers'''

All the buses in the MTC are from either [[Ashok Leyland]] or [[Tata Motors]], with the former having a vast majority. These buses were launched since 1990s and even today many of those old-fashioned buses continue to receive overwhelming response. Most of the buses are BS-III compliant while the newly ordered Ashok Leyland Viking SLFs are BS-IV Compliant.

'''Semi-Low floor buses'''

The corporation has also introduced huge number of semi [[low floored]] and deluxe buses with improved passenger amenities like  improved lighting, [[plastic moulded]] seats and driver operated pneumatic, doors into its fleet from February 2007. These buses are from Ashok Leyland, with the body built by various body building shops which Ashok Leyland has partnered with - Prakash Coach (SM Kannappa Automobiles, Bangalore), Veera Vahana Udyog Ltd, Irizar-TVS, G.S.Body works etc. and account for the majority of the buses. The newer range of these semi-low floor buses feature BS-III engines and LED display while the older buses are BS-II compliant. The total number of buses in this segment is over 1800.

'''Vestibule Services'''

Apart from the regular and low-floor buses, MTC also runs articulated buses from Ashok Leyland to traverse the most-congested routes. The fares are similar to those of ordinary and express services. These buses have 2 conductors, plastic moulded seats and LED boards (Some of these buses still continue to have regular boards). However these buses do not have pneumatic doors nor feature the chassis of the semi-low floor buses.

'''Air-conditioned buses'''

MTC has launched the Volvo AC Bus services in Chennai on selected routes. It is expected that the number of AC buses running in the city is likely to increase many folds in the upcoming years. These [[B7RLE]]s have high-tech features such as ABS, Retarders, Kneeling, etc. and relatively better interiors. There about 100 of these buses running on select routes at regular intervals. All the busses are Euro V compliant. These buses are so popular that a 30 of them have been transferred to [[TNSTC]] and make trips to [[Pondicherry]], [[Vellore]], [[Coimbatore]], [[Tiruchirapalli]] and [[Hosur]].

Advertising facilities are available on these buses, which can be availed at reasonable costs. Advertisements are mainly print visuals that can be arrayed in the interiors and the exteriors.
