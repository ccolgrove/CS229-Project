'''Kan'ami Kiyotsugu''' (è¦³é¿å¼¥ æ¸æ¬¡; 1333 &amp;ndash; June 8, 1384), was a [[Japan]]ese [[Noh]] actor, author, and musician during the [[Muromachi period]]. Born YÅ«zaki Kiyotsugu (çµå´ æ¸æ¬¡) in [[Iga Province]], Kan'ami also went by the names 'Miyomaru' and 'Kanza Kiyotsugu' (è¦³ä¸ æ¸æ¬¡).

==Theater==
Kan'ami's career began in [[Obata, Mie|Obata]] when he founded a [[Sarugaku]] theater group. The troupe moved to [[Yamato Province|Yamato]] and formed the Yuzaki theater company, which would eventually become the [[Noh|school of Noh theater]]. He grew in popularity, and began making trips to [[Kyoto]] to give performances. In 1374, the [[shogun]] [[Ashikaga Yoshimitsu]] was in the audience of a performance and was so impressed by it that he became Kan'ami's patron.

Kan'ami was the first playwright to incorporate the [[Kusemai]] song and dance style and [[Dengaku]] dances from rustic harvest celebrations. He trained his son [[Zeami Motokiyo]] in his style, and was eventually succeeded by him as the director of the Kanze school of Noh. Kan'ami died in [[Suruga Province]].
