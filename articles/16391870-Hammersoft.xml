==Teams==
===Basketball===
The Lions burst onto the national basketball scene in the late 1980s under coach [[Paul Westhead]].  His teams led Division I in scoring in 1988 (110.3 points per game), 1989 (112.5) and 1990 (122.4).&lt;ref&gt;[[#ncaa2010|NCAA 2010, p.39]]&lt;/ref&gt; LMU's 122.4 point per game in 1990 was still a record as of October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ncaa2010|NCAA 2010, p.5]]&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2010, Loyola Marymount held the five highest combined scoring games in Division I history. Four of the five occurred during Westhead's career, including a record 331 in the 181â150 win over [[United States International University]] on January 31, 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[[#ncaa2010|NCAA 2010, pp.28â29]]&lt;/ref&gt;

LMU's current men's head coach is [[Max Good]].

====Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble====
[[Hank Gathers]] and [[Bo Kimble]] were recruited to the [[University of Southern California]] by Head Coach [[Stan Morrison]] and his top assistant, David Spencer. They were joined by high school All-American, Tom Lewis, and Rich Grande as the &quot;Four Freshmen&quot; star recruiting class.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNRAVELING&quot;&gt;Harvey, Randy - [http://articles.latimes.com/print/1986-05-13/sports/sp-6015_1_george-raveling Un-Raveling at USC: A Failure to Communicate].

It was reported that the players would not remain unless certain conditions were met, including having a say in the next coaching staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNRAVELING&quot; /&gt; USC hired [[George Raveling]] as the next head coach of the Trojans.&lt;ref&gt;Fleischman, Bill-[http://articles.philly.com/1986-03-28/sports/26082131_1_stan-morrison-george-raveling-usc Raveling Leaves Iowa To Take Reins At USC].

Lewis transferred to Pepperdine. Grande remained at USC.

In the 1988â89 season, Gathers became the second player in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] history to lead the nation in scoring and rebounding in the same season, averaging 32.7 points and 13.7 [[Rebound (basketball)|rebound]]s per game.&lt;ref name=hersch&gt;{{cite news |last=Hersch |first=Hank |title=Gathers 'round The Rim |date=February 13, 1989 |magazine=[[Sports Illustrated]] |url=http://cnnsi.printthis.clickability.com/pt/cpt?expire=&amp;title=Hank+Gathers+helped+Loyola+Marymount+win+181-150+-+02.13.89+-+SI+Vault&amp;urlID=412992972&amp;action=cpt&amp;partnerID=289881&amp;fb=Y&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsportsillustrated.cnn.com%2Fvault%2Farticle%2Fmagazine%2FMAG1126533%2Findex.htm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x1Aa0Pi1 |archivedate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=maxey&gt;{{cite news |last=Maxey |first=Wendell |title=Hank Gathers' legacy endures 20 years after tragic on-court death  |date=March 4, 2010 |newspaper=[[USA Today]] |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/college/mensbasketball/2010-03-04-hank-gathers_N.htm |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5x177Uo2X |archivedate=March 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1989â90 season, Kimble led the nation in scoring averaging 35.3 points per game.

The Loyola Marymount men's basketball team will forever be remembered for the death of star player [[Hank Gathers]] (#44), who collapsed during the second round of the [[West Coast Conference|WCC]] tournament on March 4, 1990, and for the team's subsequent run to the Elite Eight in the 1990 NCAA Men's Basketball Tournament.
