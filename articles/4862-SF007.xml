'''Bengal''' ({{lang-bn|à¦¬à¦¾à¦à¦²à¦¾}} {{audio|bangla.ogg|''Bangla''}}  or {{lang|bn|à¦¬à¦à§à¦}} ''BÃ´ngo'') is a historical and geographical region in the northeast region of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] at the apex of the [[Bay of Bengal]]. Today, it is mainly divided between the sovereign land of [[Bangladesh|People's Republic of Bangladesh]] (previously [[East Bengal]] / [[East Pakistan]]) and the [[States and territories of India|Indian state]] of [[West Bengal]], although some regions of the previous kingdoms of Bengal (during local monarchical regimes and [[British Empire|British rule]]) are now part of the neighboring Indian states of [[Bihar]], [[Jharkhand]], [[Assam]], [[Tripura]] and [[Orissa]]. The majority of Bengal is inhabited by [[Bengali people]] (à¦¬à¦¾à¦à¦¾à¦²à¦¿ ''Bangali'') who speak the [[Bengali language]] (à¦¬à¦¾à¦à¦²à¦¾ ''Bangla'').

The region of Bengal is one of the most densely populated regions on earth, with a population density exceeding 900/kmÂ². Most of the Bengal region lies in the low-lying [[Ganges]]â[[Brahmaputra]] River [[River delta|Delta]] or [[Ganges Delta]], the world's largest delta. In the southern part of the delta lies the [[Sundarbans]]&amp;mdash;the world's largest [[mangrove]] forest and home of the [[Bengal tiger]]. Though the population of the region is mostly rural and agrarian, two [[megacities]], [[Kolkata]] (previously Calcutta) and [[Dhaka]] (previously Dacca), are located in Bengal. The Bengal region is renowned for its rich literary and cultural heritage as well as its immense contribution to the socio-cultural uplift of Indian society in the form of the [[Bengal Renaissance]], and [[Revolutionary movement for Indian independence|revolutionary activities]] during the [[Indian independence movement]].

==Etymology==&lt;!--linked--&gt;
{{Main|Bengali people}}
The exact origin of the word ''Bangla'' or Bengal is unknown, though it is believed to be derived from the Dravidian-speaking tribe ''Bang'' that settled in the area around the year 1000 BC.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;&gt;{{cite book

[[Vanga Kingdom|Vanga]] was a known to be a kingdom during the times of [[Mahabharata]].

Other accounts speculate that the name is derived from ''Banga'' (à¦¬à¦à§à¦ ''bÃ´ngo''), which came from the [[Austric]] word &quot;Bonga&quot; meaning the Sun-god. The word ''Banga'' and other words speculated to refer to Bengal (such as [[Anga]]) can be found in ancient Indian texts including the [[Veda]]s, [[Jainism|Jaina]] texts, the [[Mahabharata]] and [[Purana]]s. The earliest reference to &quot;Bangala&quot; (à¦¬à¦à§à¦à¦¾à¦² ''bÃ´ngal'') has been traced in the Nesari plates (805 AD) of [[Rashtrakuta]] [[Govinda III]] which speak of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] as the king of Vangala.&lt;ref&gt;M.A. Amitabha Bhattacharyya, ''Historical Geography of Ancient and Early Mediaeval Bengal'', Sanskrit Pustak Bhandar, 1977, pp. 61â62.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some accounts claim that the word may derive from [[bhang]], a preparation of [[cannabis (spiritual use)|cannabis]] which is used in some religious ceremonies in Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Robinson|first=Rowan |title=The great book of hemp|publisher=Inner Traditions |year=1995|page=107|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Qq-A4A0KB0kC&amp;pg=PA107|isbn=9780892815418}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.druglibrary.org/schaffer/library/studies/inhemp/4chapt9.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern [[Bengali people]] are a blend of these people.  Smaller numbers of [[Pashtun people|Pathans]], [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Arab]]s and [[Turkic peoples|Turks]] also migrated to the region in the [[late Middle Ages]] while spreading Islam.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrival of [[Indo-Aryans]], the kingdoms of [[Anga]], [[Vanga]] and [[Magadha]] were formed by the 10th century BC, located in the Bihar and Bengal regions. Magadha was one of the four main kingdoms of [[India]] at the time of [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] and consisted of several [[Janapadas]].&lt;ref name=settlements/&gt; One of the earliest foreign references to Bengal is the mention of a land named [[Gangaridai]] by the [[Greeks]] around 100 BC, located in an area in Bengal.&lt;ref name=Gangaridai&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After a period of anarchy, the native [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] [[Pala Empire]] ruled the region for four hundred years, and expanded across much of the [[Indian subcontinent]] into [[Afghanistan]] during the reigns of [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala]]. The Pala dynasty was followed by the reign of the [[Hindu]] [[Saiva]] [[Sena dynasty]]. [[Islam]] made its first appearance in Bengal during the 12th century when [[Sufi]] missionaries arrived. Later, occasional Muslim raiders reinforced the process of conversion by building [[mosques]], [[madrassas]] and Sufi [[Khanqah]]. Beginning in 1202 a military commander from the [[Delhi Sultanate]], [[Muhammad Khilji|Bakhtiar Khilji]], overran [[Bihar]] and Bengal as far east as [[Rangpur, Bangladesh|Rangpur]], [[Bogra]] and the [[Brahmaputra River]]. Although he failed to bring Bengal under his control, the expedition managed to defeat [[Lakshman Sen]] and his two sons moved to a place then called [[Munshiganj District|Vikramapur]] (present-day [[Munshiganj District]]), where their diminished dominion lasted until the late 13th century.

During the 14th century, the former kingdom became known as the [[Sultanate of Bengal]], ruled intermittently with the [[Sultanate of Delhi]] as well as powerful [[Hindu Rashtra|Hindu state]]s and [[Landlord|land-lords]]-[[Baro-Bhuyan#Baro-Bhuyans of Bengal|Baro-Bhuyans]]. The Hindu [[Deva dynasty|Deva Kingdom]] ruled over eastern Bengal after the collapse [[Sena Empire]]. The [[Sultanate of Bengal]] was interrupted by an uprising by the Hindus under [[Raja Ganesha]]. The Ganesha dynasty began in 1414, but his successors converted to Islam. Bengal came once more under the control of Delhi as the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]]s conquered it in 1576. There were several independent Hindu states established in Bengal during the [[Mughal period]] like those of [[Pratapaditya|Maharaja Pratap Aditya]] of [[Jessore]] and [[Raja Sitaram Ray]] of [[Burdwan]]. These kingdoms contributed a lot to the economic and cultural landscape of Bengal. Extensive land reclamations in forested and marshy areas were carried out and  trade as well as commerce were highly encouraged. These kingdoms also helped introduce new music, painting, dancing and sculpture into Bengali art-forms as well as many temples were constructed during this period. Militarily, they served as bulwarks against Portuguese and Burmese attacks. [[Koch dynasty|Koch Bihar Kingdom]] in the northern Bengal, flourished during the period of 16th and the 17th centuries as well as weathered the Mughals and survived till the advent of the British.

In 1534, the Pashtun [[Sher Shah Suri]], or Farid Khan &amp;mdash; a man of incredible military and political skill &amp;mdash; succeeded in defeating the superior forces of the [[Mughals]] under [[Humayun]] at Chausa (1539) and [[Kannauj]] (1540). Sher Shah fought back and captured both [[Delhi]] and [[Agra]] and established a kingdom stretching far into [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. Sher Shah's administrative skill showed in his public works, including the [[Grand Trunk Road]] connecting [[Sonargaon]] in Bengal with [[Peshawar]] in the [[Hindu Kush]]. Sher Shah's rule ended with his death in 1545, although even in those five years his reign would have a powerful influence on Indian society, politics, and economics.                                     

Shah Suri's successors lacked his administrative skill, and quarreled over the domains of his empire. [[Humayun]], who then ruled a rump Mughal state, saw an opportunity and in 1554 seized [[Lahore]] and Delhi. When Humayun died in Jan.1556, [[Hemu]], also called [[Hem Chandra Vikramaditya]], the then Hindu Prime Minister-cum- Chief of Army, of the [[Sur dynasty]] had already won Bengal in the battle at Chapperghatta, killing Muhammad Shah the then ruler of Bengal. This was Hemu's 20th continuous win in North India.  Knowing of Humanyun's death, Hemu rushed to [[Delhi]] to win [[Agra]] and later on Delhi and established 'Hindu Raj' in North India on 6th Oct. 1556, after 300 years of Muslim rule, leaving Bengal to his Governor Shahbaz Khan. [[Akbar]], the greatest of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] emperors, who defeated the [[Karani]] rulers of Bengal in 1576. Bengal became a Mughal [[subah]] and ruled through [[subahdar]]s (governors). [[Akbar]] exercised progressive rule and oversaw a period of prosperity (through trade and development) in Bengal and northern India.                                           

Bengal's trade and wealth impressed the Mughals that they called the region the &quot;''Paradise of the Nations''&quot;. Administration by governors appointed by the court of the [[Mughal Empire]] court (1575â1717) gave way to four decades of semi-independence under the [[Nawabs of Murshidabad]], who respected the nominal sovereignty of the [[Mughal Empire|Mughals]] in Delhi. The Nawabs granted permission to the [[French East India Company]] to establish a trading post at [[Chandernagore]] in 1673, and the [[British East India Company]] at [[Calcutta]] in 1690. The most notable among them is [[Murshid Quli Khan]], who was succeeded by [[Alivardi Khan]]. Around the early 1700s, the [[Maratha Empire]] led [[expeditions in Bengal]]. The leader of the expedition was [[Maratha]] [[Maharaja]] [[Raghoji I Bhonsle|Raghuji]] of [[Nagpur Kingdom|Nagpur]]. Raghoji was able to annex [[Orissa]] and parts of Bengal permanently as he successfully exploited the chaotic conditions prevailing in the region  after the death of their Governor [[Murshid Quli Khan]] in 1727.&lt;ref&gt;SNHM. Vol. II, pp.&amp;nbsp;209, 224.&lt;/ref&gt; The expeditions  resulted in Bengal becoming a tributary region of the [[Maratha]]s for a period of time. 

[[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]] traders arrived late in the fifteenth century, once [[Vasco da Gama]] reached India by sea in 1498. European influence grew until the [[British East India Company]] gained taxation rights in Bengal ''[[subah]]'', or province, following the [[Battle of Plassey]] in 1757, when [[Siraj ud-Daulah]], the last independent Nawab, was defeated by the British.&lt;ref name=sirajbanglaped&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Calcutta was named the capital of [[British Raj|British India]] in 1772. The [[Bengal Renaissance]] and [[Brahmo Samaj]] socio-cultural reform movements had great impact on the cultural and economic life of Bengal. The failed [[Indian rebellion of 1857]] started near Calcutta and resulted in transfer of authority to the [[British monarchy|British Crown]], administered by the [[Viceroy of India]].&lt;ref name=baxter2&gt;{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=30â32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1905 and 1911, an [[Partition of Bengal (1905)|abortive attempt]] was made to divide the province of Bengal into two zones.&lt;ref name=baxter3&gt;{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=39â40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting from the [[Bengali Language Movement]] of 1952,&lt;ref name=baxter4&gt;{{Harv|Baxter|1997|pp=62â63}}&lt;/ref&gt; political dissent against [[West Pakistan]]i domination grew steadily.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The post independence history of Bangladesh was strife with conflict, with a long history of political assassinations and [[military coup|coups]] before parliamentary democracy was established in 1991. Since then, the political environment has been relatively stable.

[[West Bengal]], the western part of Bengal, became a state in India. In the 1960s and 1970s, severe power shortages, strikes and a violent [[Naxalite|Marxist-Naxalite]] movement damaged much of the state's infrastructure, leading to a period of economic stagnation. The [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] of 1971 resulted in the influx of millions of refugees to West Bengal, causing significant strains on its infrastructure.&lt;ref name=&quot;londonanthology&quot;&gt;{{Harv|Bennett|Hindle|1996|pp=63â70}}&lt;/ref&gt; West Bengal politics underwent a major change when the [[Left Front]] won the 1977 assembly election, defeating the incumbent [[Indian National Congress]].

The state's economic recovery gathered momentum after [[economic reforms in India]] were introduced in the mid-1990s by the [[Government of India|central government]], aided by election of a new reformist [[Chief Minister]] [[Buddhadeb Bhattacharya]] in 2000. In the [[West Bengal state assembly election, 2011]],in West Bengal, CPI(M) alliance with 62 seats suffered a setback after 34 years of continuous rule, losing to [[Trinamool Congress]] led alliance's 226 seats.

About 20,000 people live on chars. Chars are temporary islands formed by the deposition of sediments eroded off the banks of the Ganges in West Bengal which often disappear in the monsoon season. They are made of very fertile soil. The inhabitants of chars are not recognised by the Government of West Bengal on the grounds that it is not known whether they are Bengalis or Bangladeshi refugees. Consequently, no identification documents are issued to char-dwellers who cannot benefit from health care, barely survive due to very poor sanitation and are prevented from emigrating to the mainland to find jobs when they have turned 14. On a particular char it was reported that 13% of women died at childbirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wanderinggaia.com|title=Wandering Gaia|publisher=&quot;The Give and Take of the Ganges&quot; WordPress.com |date= |accessdate=2009-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common [[Bengali language]] and culture anchors the shared tradition of two parts of politically divided Bengal. Bengal has a long tradition in folk literature, evidenced by the ''[[Charyapada]]'', ''[[Mangalkavya]]'', ''[[Shreekrishna Kirtana]]'', ''[[Maimansingha Gitika]]'' or ''[[Thakurmar Jhuli]]''. Bengali literature in the medieval age was often either religious (e.g. [[Chandidas]]), or adaptations from other languages (e.g. [[Alaol]]). During the [[Bengal Renaissance]] of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, [[Bengali literature]] was modernized through the works of authors such as [[Michael Madhusudan Dutta]], [[Bankim Chandra Chattopadhyay]], [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar]] and [[Kazi Nazrul Islam]].

The [[Baul]] tradition is a unique heritage of Bangla folk music.&lt;ref name=baulbengalonline&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar saint Sri Anirvan loved Baul music, and in fact described himself as a simple Baul.&lt;ref&gt;http://banglapedia.search.com.bd/HT/A_0246.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Other folk music forms include [[Gombhira]], [[Bhatiali]] and [[Bhawaiya]]. Folk music in Bengal is often accompanied by the [[ektara]], a one-stringed instrument. Other instruments include the [[dotara]], [[dhol]], [[flute]], and [[tabla]]. The region also has an active heritage in [[Hindustani classical music|North Indian classical music]].

Bengal had also been the harbinger of [[modernism]] in [[Indian art]]s. Abanindranath Tagore, one of the important 18th century artist from Bengal is often referred to as the father of Indian modern art. He had established the first non-British art academy in India known as the Kalabhavan within the premises of [[Santiniketan]]. Santiniketan in course of time had produced many important Indian artists like [[Gaganendranath Tagore]], [[Nandalal Bose]], [[Jamini Roy]], [[Benode Bihari Mukherjee]] and [[Ramkinkar Baij]]. In the post-independence era, Bengal had produced important artists like [[Somenath Hore]], [[Meera Mukherjee]] and [[Ganesh Pyne]].

Rice and fish are traditional favorite foods, leading to a saying that in Bengali, ''mach ar bhaath bangali baanaay'', that translates as &quot;fish and rice make a Bengali&quot;.&lt;ref name=machhe&gt;{{cite web

Bengali women commonly wear the ''[[sari|shaÅi]]'' and the [[salwar kameez]], often distinctly designed according to local cultural customs. In urban areas, many women and men wear Western-style attire. Among men, European dressing has greater acceptance. Men also wear traditional costumes such as the ''[[kurta|panjabi]]'' with ''[[dhoti|dhuti]]'' or ''[[pyjama]]'', often on religious occasions. The [[lungi]], a kind of long skirt, is widely worn by Bangladeshi men.

The greatest religious festivals are the two [[religious festival|Eid]]s ([[Eid ul-Fitr]] and [[Eid ul-Adha]]) for the Muslims, and the autumnal [[Durga|Durga Puja]] for Hindus.&lt;ref name=durgapuja&gt;{{cite web

[[Bengali cinema]] are made both in Kolkata and Dhaka. The Kolkata film industry is older and particularly well known for its [[art film]]s. Its long tradition of film making has produced world famous [[Film director|directors]] like [[Satyajit Ray]], while contemporary directors include [[Buddhadev Dasgupta]] and [[Aparna Sen]]. Dhaka also has a vibrant commercial industry and more recently has been home to critically acclaimed directors like [[Tareque Masud]]. Mainstream Hindi films of [[Bollywood]] are also quite popular in both West Bengal and Bangladesh. Around 200 dailies are published in Bangladesh, along with more than 1800 periodicals. West Bengal had 559 published newspapers in 2005,&lt;ref name=rniindia&gt;{{cite web

Visa services are provided by Bangladesh's consulate at Kolkata's Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujibur Rahman Road and India's high commissions in [[Dhaka]], [[Chittagong]] and [[Rajshahi]]. [[India]] has a liberal [[Visa (document)|visa]] policy and nearly 500,000 visas&lt;ref name=natwarspeech/&gt; are issued every year to Bangladeshi [[student]]s, [[tourist]]s, health-tourists and others who visit West Bengal and often transit to other parts of India. People of West Bengal visit Bangladesh for limited numbers of tourism, pilgrimage, trade, expatriate assignments; there is significant potential for growth as Bangladesh's stability, economy, moderation in religion and tourist infrastructure improves. In addition [[West Bengal]] hosts the celebrated and controversial Bangladeshi author [[Taslima Nasreen]].

Undocumented [[immigration]] of Bangladeshi workers is a controversial issue&lt;ref name=natwarspeech/&gt; championed by right-wing nationalist parties in India but finds little sympathy in [[West Bengal]]. India has fenced the border to control this flow but immigration is still continuing.&lt;ref name=migrHindu&gt;{{cite journal

The official land border crossing at Petrapole-Benapole is the primary conduit for the over $1 billion trade between the two halves of Bengal. The volume of unofficial exports to Bangladesh from India is reportedly in the range of $350â500 million each year.&lt;ref name=hindubusiinformal&gt;{{cite news

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangladesh]] argues that [[India]] needs to open up its border more to Bangladeshi exports. Other landports between the two Bengals are Changrabandha-Burimari and Balurghat-Hili.

Cultural exchanges between the two parts of Bengal have been somewhat (but not fully) impacted by ups and downs in India-Bangladesh relations and in the influence of extremist Islamist groups in Bangladesh. [[West Bengal]] singers and actors complained about being rejected visas in previous years. West Bengal television channels are widely watched in Banglades, while no Bangladeshi channels are absent in West Bengal due to import policies. In foreign countries such as the [[U.S.]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom|Britain]], and [[UAE]], it is common for Bengalis from both sides to form joint cultural associations and friendships, although inter-marriage is not significant, especially across religious barriers.
