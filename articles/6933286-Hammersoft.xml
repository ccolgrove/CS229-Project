'''''Jornal Nacional''''' ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] for ''National Journal'') is a [[Brazil]]ian [[news program]] aired by [[Rede Globo]] since September 1, 1969. It was the first news program broadcast live by a television network throughout Brazil.

==History==
''Jornal Coval'' premiered on September 1, 1969, hosted by [[Hilton Gomes]] and [[Cid Moreira]].

During the [[1970s]], ''Jornal Nacional'' preferred to emphasize international news and sports. The [[United Kingdom|gales]] documentary ''[[Beyond Citizen Kane]]'' suggests that this happened so that Globo wouldn't have to report the repression of the [[military dictatorship (Brazil)|military dictatorship]], which would had provided a substantial part of the network's growth.

Through the [[1980s]], three episodes involving the program caused controversy. In 1982, ''Jornal Nacional'''s coverage of the state elections of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] was accused of participating in a plot to fraud the elections. According to former Rede Globo employee RomÃ©ro da Costa Machado, [[Leonel Brizola]], a candidate of the opposition to the military regime, was a politician historically persecuted by Rede Globo owner [[Roberto Marinho]]. Two years later, the program was accused of omitting information about the ''[[Diretas JÃ¡]]'', a popular campaign for the end of the dictatorship. Finally, in 1989, ''Jornal Nacional'' was accused of editing a presidential debate between runoff candidates [[Fernando Collor]] and [[Luis Inacio Lula da Silva]] in order to favour Collor. This episode is also extensively debated on ''Beyond Citizen Kane''.

In the [[1990s]], the quality of Rede Globo's journalism increased dramatically. ''Jornal Nacional'' presented its viewers breaking stories such as [[police brutality]] at [[favela]]s, an interview with [[Paulo CÃ©sar Farias]] when he was on the run from the law, corruption cases on the [[social security]], among several others.

In recent days, after the death of Marinho, Rede Globo's journalism again declined in quality. ''Jornal Nacional'' has preferred to broadcast stories produced on the [[Southeast Region, Brazil|Southeast]], in spite of Globo having affiliates in every Brazilian state. During the so-called [[MensalÃ£o scandal]] and the 2006 general elections, ''Jornal Nacional'' was once again accused of airing anti-Lula biased news. Meanwhile, it lost great part of its viewership to [[Rede Record]]'s ''[[Jornal da Record]]'' (Record Journal), which copied its style. On November 2005, host [[William Bonner (Brazilian newscaster)|William Bonner]] caused controversy after he compared the average ''Jornal Nacional'' viewer with [[Homer Simpson]], the ignorant main character of the [[United States|American]] animated series ''[[The Simpsons]]''.

==Hosts==
After almost 40 years of broadcast, several reporters hosted ''Jornal Nacional''. Hilton Gomes and Cid Moreira were the first hosts. Later on, [[SÃ©rgio Chapelin]] replaced Gomes and joined Moreira as the longest-running duo of ''Jornal Nacional'' hosts. In 1983, Chapelin was replaced by [[Celso Freitas]]. Chapelin returned in 1989, hosting again with Moreira until 1996. In that year, [[William Bonner (Brazilian newscaster)|William Bonner]] and [[LÃ­lian Wittefibe]] began serving as hosts. From 1998 on, Wittefibe was replaced by Bonner's wife, [[FÃ¡tima Bernardes]]. Bonner and Bernardes recently tied with Chapelin and Moreira as the longest-running duo of ''Jornal Nacional'' hosts.
