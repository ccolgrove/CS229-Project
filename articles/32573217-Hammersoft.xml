The '''Auburn&amp;ndash;Florida football rivalry''' is an American [[college football]] [[college rivalry|rivalry]] game played by the [[Auburn Tigers football]] team of [[Auburn University]] and the [[Florida Gators football]] team of the [[University of Florida]].  Both universities are founding members of the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC), and both were members of the [[Southern Conference]] before 1933.

Auburn holds the advantage in the overall win-loss-tie record in the rivalry series, 43&amp;ndash;38&amp;ndash;2.  The series has been marked by periods of alternating winning streaks by one team intermingled with stretches of home field dominance by both.  Auburn, however, has always led the series.  Thirty-three of the games in the series have been decided by seven points or fewer, including two ties.

== Series history ==

From its one-sided domination by Auburn in its early years, the Auburn&amp;ndash;Florida football rivalry has evolved into one of the mostly evenly matched and hardest fought in the Southeastern Conference.  The games have often had SEC title and national championship implications.  As described by ''Gainesville Sun'' sports columnist Pat Dooley following the 2007 game, &quot;Florida-Auburn delivered another game that made one side ecstatic and one side heartbroken.  That's what it does.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pat Dooley, &quot;[http://www.gatorsports.com/article/20070929/COLUMNISTS/70930003  What did you expect?  It's Auburn&amp;ndash;Florida.  It's college football],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (September 29, 2007).  Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first game in the series was played between coach [[Mike Donahue]]'s Tigers and coach [[George E. Pyle|George Pyle]]'s Gators in 1912, on the [[Auburn, Alabama]] campus of what was then called [[History of Auburn University#Post-Civil War|Alabama Polytechnic Institute]].&lt;ref name=aumediaguide&gt;''[http://grfx.cstv.com/photos/schools/aub/sports/m-footbl/auto_pdf/2011-12/misc_non_event/2011-fbguide.pdf  2011 Auburn Tigers Football Media Guide]'', Auburn Athletics Department, Auburn, Alabama, pp. 178&amp;ndash;189, 191 (2011).  Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Auburn was officially known as &quot;Alabama Polytechnic Institute&quot; or &quot;API&quot; from 1899 to 1960, although it was commonly known as &quot;Auburn&quot;&amp;mdash;a reference to the town in which it is located.  The Alabama legislature officially changed the institute's name to &quot;Auburn University&quot; in 1960.  ''See'' Auburn University, [http://www.ocm.auburn.edu/welcome/aboutauburn.html  History].  Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Auburn Tigers won the first six games played by the two teams from 1912 to 1917, dominating the Florida Gators by two or more touchdowns in five of the six games.&lt;ref name=aumediaguide/&gt;  When the series resumed in 1927, the Florida Gators were experiencing revived success under coaches [[Harold Sebring]] and [[Charlie Bachman]], and it was the Gators' turn for a streak, winning seven of the next eight.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide&gt;''[http://web.gatorzone.com/football/media/2011/media_guide.pdf  2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 116&amp;ndash;125 (2011).  Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning in 1935, the fortunes of the Gators and Tigers reversed again, with the Tigers compiling a 7&amp;ndash;2&amp;ndash;1 record in the next ten games played through 1947.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;

The Auburn&amp;ndash;Florida game has not always been played as a home-and-home series on the universities' respective campuses in Auburn and [[Gainesville, Florida]].  In the early years of the series, six games were played in [[Gator Bowl Stadium#Origins|Fairfield Stadium]] in [[Jacksonville, Florida]], five matches at the [[Cramton Bowl]] in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], and one each in [[Miami, Florida]]; [[Columbus, Georgia]]; [[Tampa, Florida]]; and [[Mobile, Alabama]].  Starting in 1950, every regular game has been played at either [[Jordan&amp;ndash;Hare Stadium]] (previously known as Auburn Stadium and Cliff Hare Stadium) in Auburn, or [[Ben Hill Griffin Stadium]] (also known as Florida Field) in Gainesville.  For the first and only time in the series history, the Gators and Tigers met for a second time during the same season in the [[2000 SEC Championship Game]] held at the [[Georgia Dome]] in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=cfdwseriesrecord/&gt;&lt;ref name=newberry12032000&gt;Paul Newberry, &quot;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dV5JAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cQoNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4663,1105969&amp;dq=auburn+florida&amp;hl=en  Dominant Florida rips Auburn on way to Sugar],&quot; ''The Post and Courier'', pp. 1-C &amp; 6-C (December 3, 2000).  Retrieved August 18, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the construction of Auburn Stadium in 1939, the Tigers started a remarkable 32-year streak on the Tigers' home field during which they would tie the Gators once and defeat them twelve consecutive times.  The Gators broke the Tigers' home-field winning streak in a hard-fought upset in 1973.

From 1945 to 2002, the Florida Gators and Auburn Tigers played forty-eight consecutive annual games;&lt;ref name=cfdwseriesrecord&gt;College Football Data Warehouse, [http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/div_ia/sec/auburn/opponents_records.php?teamid=1113  Auburn vs. Florida].  Retrieved August 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; since 2003, the two teams have been scheduled to meet twice every five years.  The Gators and Tigers have played eighty-two games in the past ninety-nine years, and the current all-time series record is forty-two victories for the Tigers, thirty-eight for the Gators, and two ties.&lt;ref name=aumediaguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=cfdwseriesrecord/&gt;  The Tigers hold a 21&amp;ndash;7&amp;ndash;1 edge in games played in their current stadium; the Gators have a 22&amp;ndash;9 advantage in games played on their present field.

The University of Arkansas and the University of South Carolina joined the SEC in 1991, and the conference was split into two six-team divisions in 1992.  Since then, Florida has been a member of the SEC Eastern Division, and Auburn has been a member of the SEC Western Division.  At first, every SEC team played two games every year against two permanent rivals in the other division and a third cross-divisional game that rotated among the other four teams in that division.  Auburn's original two cross-division rivals were Georgia and Florida; Florida's were LSU and Auburn.  In 2002, the SEC changed the cross-division format to one permanent rival and two rotating teams.  Since Auburn's rivalry with Georgia was even older, Georgia remained Auburn's lone cross-division rival while Florida retained their annual game against LSU, and the previously annual Auburn&amp;ndash;Florida football rivalry became an intermittent one.

[[Gene Chizik]], the Tigers' current head coach, is a University of Florida graduate and played for coach [[Charley Pell]]'s Gators in the 1980s.  The Gators' present head coach, [[Will Muschamp]], got his start in coaching as a Tigers graduate assistant in the 1990s, and served as the Tigers' defensive coordinator under [[Tommy Tuberville]] from 2006 to 2007.
