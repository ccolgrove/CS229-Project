'''Microsoft Windows''' is a series of [[operating system]]s produced by [[Microsoft]].

Microsoft introduced an [[operating environment]] named ''Windows'' on November 20, 1985 as an add-on to [[MS-DOS]] in response to the growing interest in [[graphical user interface]]s (GUIs).&lt;ref name=aboutcomnov&gt;{{cite web |url=http://inventors.about.com/od/mstartinventions/a/Windows.htm?rd=1 |title=The Unusual History of Microsoft Windows |accessdate=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft Windows came to [[Market dominance|dominate]] the world's [[personal computer]] market, overtaking [[Mac OS]], which had been introduced in 1984. As of August 2011, Windows has approximately 82.58% of the market share of the [[Client (computing)|client]] operating systems according to [[Usage share of operating systems]].

The most recent client version of Windows is [[Windows 7]]; the most recent [[Server (computing)|server]] version is [[Windows Server 2008 R2]]; the most recent [[Mobile operating system|mobile]] version is [[Windows Phone 7]].

==Versions==
{{See also|List of Microsoft Windows versions}}
The term ''Windows'' collectively describes any or all of several generations of [[Microsoft]] [[operating system]] products. These products are generally categorized as follows:

[[File:Windows 3.0 logo.svg|left|thumb|140px|The classic Windows logo, used until the release of [[Windows XP]] in 2001]]
===Early versions===
{{Main|Windows 1.0|Windows 2.0|Windows 2.1x}}
[[File:Windows1.0.png|thumb|300px|Windows 1.0, the first version, released in 1985]]
The history of Windows dates back to September 1981, when Chase Bishop, a computer scientist, designed the first model of an electronic device and project &quot;Interface Manager&quot; was started. It was announced in November 1983 (after the [[Apple Lisa]], but before the [[Macintosh]]) under the name &quot;Windows&quot;, but [[Windows 1.0]] was not released until November 1985.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petzold&quot;&gt;Petzold&lt;/ref&gt; The [[operating system shell|shell]] of Windows 1.0 was a program known as the [[MS-DOS Executive]]. Other supplied programs were [[Microsoft Calculator|Calculator]], [[Microsoft Calendar|Calendar]], [[Cardfile]], [[ClipBook Viewer|Clipboard viewer]], Clock, [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]], [[Notepad (Windows)|Notepad]], [[Microsoft Paint|Paint]], [[Reversi]], [[Terminal emulator|Terminal]], and [[Windows Write|Write]]. Windows 1.0 did not allow overlapping windows. Instead all windows were [[tiling window manager|tiled]]. Only dialog boxes could appear over other windows.

[[Windows 2.0]] was released in October 1987 and featured several improvements to the user interface and memory management.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petzold&quot;/&gt; Windows 2.0 allowed application windows to overlap each other and also introduced more sophisticated keyboard-shortcuts. It could also make use of [[expanded memory]].

Windows 2.1 was released in two different versions: [[Windows/386]] employed the [[386]] [[virtual 8086 mode]] to multitask several DOS programs, and the paged memory model to emulate expanded memory using available [[extended memory]]. [[Windows/286]] (which, despite its name, would run on the 8086) still ran in [[real mode]], but could make use of the [[high memory area]].

The early versions of Windows were often thought of as simply graphical user interfaces, mostly because they ran on top of [[MS-DOS]] and used it for [[file system]] services.&lt;ref name=&quot;Evolution&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.soft32.com/windows-evolution_1629.html |title=Windows Evolution |publisher=Soft32.com News}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, even the earliest 16-bit Windows versions already assumed many typical operating system functions; notably, having their own [[executable file format]] and providing their own [[device driver]]s (timer, graphics, printer, mouse, keyboard and sound) for applications. Unlike [[MS-DOS]], Windows allowed users to execute multiple graphical applications at the same time, through [[Computer multitasking|cooperative multitasking]]. Windows implemented an elaborate, segment-based, software virtual memory scheme, which allowed it to run applications larger than available memory: code segments and [[resource (Windows)|resource]]s were swapped in and thrown away when memory became scarce, and data segments moved in memory when a given application had relinquished processor control.

===Windows 3.0 and 3.1===
{{Main|Windows 3.0|Windows 3.1x}}
[[File:Windows 3.0 workspace.png|thumb|250px|Windows 3.0, released in 1990]]
[[Windows 3.0]] (1990) and [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]] (1992) improved the design, mostly because of [[virtual memory]] and loadable virtual device drivers ([[VxD]]s) that allowed them to share arbitrary devices between multitasked DOS windows.{{Citation needed|date=July 2007}} Also, Windows applications could now run in [[protected mode]] (when Windows was running in Standard or 386 Enhanced Mode), which gave them access to several megabytes of memory and removed the obligation to participate in the software virtual memory scheme. They still ran inside the same address space, where the segmented memory provided a degree of protection, and multi-tasked cooperatively. For Windows 3.0, Microsoft also rewrote critical operations from [[C (programming language)|C]] into [[Assembly language|assembly]].

===Windows 95, 98, and Me===
{{Main|Windows 95|Windows 98|Windows Me}}
[[File:Windows 95 Desktop screenshot.png|thumb|250px|[[Windows 95]], released in August 1995]]
[[Windows 95]] was released in August 1995, featuring a new user interface, support for [[Long filename|long file names]] of up to 255 characters, and the ability to automatically detect and configure installed hardware ([[plug and play]]). It could natively run 32-bit applications, and featured several technological improvements that increased its stability over Windows 3.1. There were several OEM Service Releases (OSR) of Windows 95, each of which was roughly equivalent to a [[service pack]].

Microsoft's next release was [[Windows 98]] in June 1998. Microsoft released a second version of Windows 98 in May 1999, named [[Windows 98 Second Edition]] (often shortened to Windows 98 SE).

In February 2000, [[Windows 2000]] (in the NT family) was released, followed by [[Windows Me]] in September 2000 (''Me'' standing for ''Millennium Edition''). Windows Me updated the core from Windows 98, but adopted some aspects of Windows 2000 and removed the &quot;boot in DOS mode&quot; option. It also added a new feature called [[System Restore]], allowing the user to set the computer's settings back to an earlier date.

===Windows NT family===
{{Main|Windows NT}}
The NT family of Windows systems was fashioned and marketed for higher reliability business use. The first release was [[Windows NT 3.1|NT 3.1]] (1993), numbered &quot;3.1&quot; to match the consumer Windows version, which was followed by [[Windows NT 3.5|NT 3.5]] (1994), [[Windows NT 3.51|NT 3.51]] (1995), [[Windows NT 4.0|NT 4.0]] (1996), and [[Windows 2000]], which is the last NT-based Windows release that does not include Microsoft [[Product Activation]]. Windows NT 4.0 was the first in this line to implement the &quot;Windows 95&quot; user interface (and the first to include Windows 95âs built-in 32-bit runtimes).

Microsoft then moved to combine their consumer and business operating systems with [[Windows XP]] that was released on October 25, 2001. It came both in home and professional versions (and later niche market versions for [[Microsoft Tablet PC|tablet PC]]s and [[Home theater PC|media centers]]); they also diverged release schedules for server operating systems. [[Windows Server 2003]], released a year and a half after Windows XP, brought [[Windows Server]] up to date with Windows XP. After a lengthy [[development of Windows Vista|development process]], [[Windows Vista]] was released on November 30, 2006 for volume licensing and January 30, 2007 for consumers. And its server counterpart, [[Windows Server 2008]] was released in early 2008. On July 22, 2009, [[Windows 7]] and [[Windows Server 2008 R2]] were released as RTM (release to manufacturing) while the former was released to the public 3 months later on October 22, 2009.

====64-bit operating systems====
[[Windows NT]] included support for several different platforms before the [[x86]]-based [[personal computer]] became dominant in the professional world. Versions of NT from 3.1 to 4.0 variously supported [[PowerPC]], [[DEC Alpha]] and [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4000, some of which were 64-bit processors, although the operating system treated them as 32-bit processors.

With the introduction of the [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] [[architecture]] (also known as IA-64), Microsoft released new versions of Windows to support it. Itanium versions of [[Windows XP]] and [[Windows Server 2003]] were released at the same time as their mainstream x86 (32-bit) counterparts. On April 25, 2005, Microsoft released [[Windows XP Professional x64 Edition]] and Windows Server 2003 x64 Editions to support the [[x86-64]] (or ''x64'' in Microsoft terminology) architecture. Microsoft dropped support for the Itanium version of Windows XP in 2005. [[Windows Vista]] was the first end-user version of Windows that Microsoft released simultaneously in x86 and x64 editions. Windows Vista does not support the Itanium architecture. The modern 64-bit Windows family comprises AMD64/Intel64 versions of Windows 7 and [[Windows Server 2008]], in both Itanium and x64 editions. Windows Server 2008 R2 drops the 32-bit version, although [[Windows 7]] does not.

===Windows CE===
{{Main|Windows CE|Windows Phone 7}}
[[File:WindowsCE7.png|thumb|250px|The latest current version of Windows CE, [[Windows Embedded CE 7.0|Windows Embedded Compact 7]], displaying a possible UI for what the media player can look like.]]
Windows CE (officially known as ''Windows Embedded Compact''), is an edition of Windows that runs on minimalistic computers, like satellite navigation systems and some mobile phones. Windows Embedded Compact is based on its own dedicated kernel, dubbed Windows CE kernel. Microsoft licenses Windows CE to [[OEM]]s and device makers. The OEMs and device makers can modify and create their own user interfaces and experiences, while Windows CE provides the technical foundation to do so.

Windows CE was used in the [[Dreamcast]] along with Sega's own proprietary OS for the console. Windows CE is the core from which [[Windows Mobile]] is derived. Microsoft's latest [[mobile OS]], [[Windows Phone 7]], is based on components from both [[Windows Embedded CE 6.0|Windows CE 6.0 R3]] and the current [[Windows Embedded Compact 7|Windows CE 7.0]].

Windows Embedded Compact is not to be confused with [[Windows XP Embedded]] or [[Windows NT 4.0 Embedded]], modular editions of Windows based on Windows NT kernel.

===Future of Windows===
[[File:Windows 8 Developer Preview Start Screen.png|thumb|250px|Screenshot of Windows 8 startscreen]]
[[File:Windows To Go USB Drive.png|thumb|Bootable [[Windows To Go]] USB flash drive|link=Windows To Go]]
[[Windows 8]], the successor to Windows 7, is currently in development. Microsoft posted a blog entry in Dutch on October 22, 2010 hinting that Windows 8 would be released in roughly 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Microsoft says Windows 8 roughly two years away |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13860_3-20020544-56.html?tag=mncol;title |work=CNET News |publisher=CNET |date=October 24, 2010 |accessdate=December 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, during the pre-[[Consumer Electronics Show]] keynote, [[Microsoft]]'s [[CEO]] announced that Windows 8 will also run on [[ARM Architecture|ARM]] [[CPU]]s. This Windows version will also be more suitable for [[Tablet computer|tablet]]s and netbooks, featuring a more touch-friendly interface. Several new features will also be introduced, such as support for USB 3.0 and the ability to run Windows from USB devices (like USB Hard Disks or USB Flash drives) with [[Windows To Go]].

==History==
{{Main|History of Microsoft Windows}}
[[File:Windows Family Tree.svg|thumb|center|500px|The Windows family tree.]] &lt;!-- File must be SVG format. --&gt;
The first version of Microsoft Windows, [[Windows 1.0|version 1.0]], released in November 1985, lacked a degree of functionality, achieved little popularity and was to compete with Appleâs own operating system.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Windows 1.0 is not a complete operating system; rather, it extends [[MS-DOS]]. Microsoft Windows [[Windows 2.0|version 2.0]] was released in November 1987 and was slightly more popular than its predecessor. Windows 2.03 (release date January 1988) had changed the OS from tiled windows to overlapping windows. The result of this change led to Apple Computer filing a suit against Microsoft alleging infringement on Apple's copyrights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lowendmac.com/orchard/06/apple-vs-microsoft.html |title=The Apple vs. Microsoft GUI Lawsuit |year=2006 |accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://home.earthlink.net/~mjohnsen/Technology/Lawsuits/appvsms.html |title=Apple Computer, Inc. v. MicroSoft Corp., 35 F.3d 1435 (9th Cir. 1994) |accessdate=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft Windows [[Windows 3.0|version 3.0]], released in 1990, was the first Microsoft Windows version to achieve broad commercial success, selling 2 million copies in the first six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.islandnet.com/~kpolsson/compsoft/soft1991.htm |title=Chronology of Personal Computer Software}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thocp.net/companies/microsoft/microsoft_company.htm |title=Microsoft Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; It featured improvements to the user interface and to multitasking capabilities. It received a facelift in Windows 3.1, made generally available on March 1, 1992. Windows 3.1 support ended on December 31, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?LN=en-us&amp;p1=3078&amp;x=10&amp;y=11 |title=Windows 3.1 Standard Edition Support Lifecycle |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 1993, Microsoft released [[Windows NT]] based on a new kernel. [[Windows NT 3.1]] was the first release of Windows NT. NT was considered to be the professional OS and was the first Windows version to utilize [[preemptive multitasking]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}} Windows NT would later be retooled to also function as a home operating system, with Windows XP.

On August 24, 1995, Microsoft released [[Windows 95]], a new, and major, consumer version that made further changes to the user interface, and also used preemptive multitasking. Windows 95 was designed to replace not only Windows 3.1, but also Windows for Workgroups, and MS-DOS. It was also the first Windows operating system to use Plug and Play capabilities. The changes Windows 95 brought to the desktop were revolutionary, as opposed to evolutionary, such as those in Windows 98 and Windows Me. Mainstream support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2000 and extended support for Windows 95 ended on December 31, 2001.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows 95 Support Lifecycle&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=7864 |title=Windows 95 Support Lifecycle |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next in the consumer line was Microsoft [[Windows 98]] released on June 25, 1998. It was followed with the release of Windows 98 Second Edition (Windows 98 SE) in 1999. Mainstream support for Windows 98 ended on June 30, 2002 and extended support for Windows 98 ended on July 11, 2006.&lt;ref name=&quot;Windows 98 Standard Edition Support Lifecycle&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=6513 |title=Windows 98 Standard Edition Support Lifecycle |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of its &quot;professional&quot; line, Microsoft released [[Windows 2000]] in February 2000. During 2004 part of the Source Code for Windows 2000 was leaked onto the Internet. This was bad for Microsoft as the same kernel used in Windows 2000 was used in Windows XP. The consumer version following Windows 98 was [[Windows Me]] (Windows Millennium Edition). Released in September 2000, Windows Me implemented a number of new technologies for Microsoft: most notably publicized was &quot;[[Universal Plug and Play]]&quot;. Windows Me was heavily criticized due to slowness, [[Freeze (computing)|freezes]] and hardware problems.

In October 2001, Microsoft released [[Windows XP]], a version built on the Windows NT [[Kernel (computer science)|kernel]] that also retained the consumer-oriented usability of Windows 95 and its successors. This new version was widely praised in computer magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206367.html |title=Your top Windows XP questions answered! (Part One) |author=David Coursey |date=August 31, 2001 |work=ZDNet |publisher=CNET |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071219121319/http://review.zdnet.com/4520-6033_16-4206367.html |archivedate=December 19, 2007 |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It shipped in two distinct editions, &quot;Home&quot; and &quot;Professional&quot;, the former lacking many of the superior security and networking features of the Professional edition. Additionally, the first &quot;Media Center&quot; edition was released in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.winsupersite.com/article/showcase/a-look-at-freestyle-and-mira.aspx |title=A Look at Freestyle and Mira |date=September 3, 2002 |work=Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows |publisher=Penton |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an emphasis on support for DVD and TV functionality including program recording and a remote control. Mainstream support for Windows XP ended on April 14, 2009. Extended support will continue until April 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/?p1=3223 |title=Windows XP Professional Lifecycle Support |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2003, [[Windows Server 2003]] was introduced, replacing the Windows 2000 line of server products with a number of new features and a strong focus on security; this was followed in December 2005 by Windows Server 2003 R2.

On January 30, 2007, Microsoft released [[Windows Vista]]. It contains a number of [[Features new to Windows Vista|new features]], from a redesigned shell and user interface to significant [[Technical features new to Windows Vista|technical changes]], with a particular focus on [[Security and safety features new to Windows Vista|security features]]. It is available in a number of [[Windows Vista editions and pricing|different editions]], and has been subject to [[Criticism of Windows Vista|some criticism]].

On October 22, 2009, Microsoft released [[Windows 7]]. Unlike its predecessor, Windows Vista, which introduced a large number of new features, Windows 7 was intended to be a more focused, incremental upgrade to the Windows line, with the goal of being compatible with applications and hardware which Windows Vista was not at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windows7/archive/2008/10/28/windows-7-unveiled-today-at-pdc-2008.aspx |title=Windows 7 Unveiled Today at PDC 2008 |author=Mike Nash |date=October 28, 2008 |work=Windows Team Blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows 7 has [[multi-touch]] support, a redesigned [[Windows shell]] with a new [[taskbar]], referred to as the Superbar, a home networking system called HomeGroup,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://windowsteamblog.com/blogs/windowsexperience/archive/2008/10/28/how-libraries-amp-homegroup-work-together-in-windows-7.aspx |title=How Libraries &amp; HomeGroup Work Together in Windows 7 |author=Brandon LeBlanc |date=October 28, 2008 |work=Windows Team Blog |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=November 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and performance improvements.

==Security==
Consumer versions of Windows were originally designed for ease-of-use on a single-user PC without a network connection, and did not have security features built in from the outset.&lt;ref&gt;Multi-user memory protection was not introduced until Windows NT and XP, and a computer's default user was an administrator until Windows Vista. Source: [http://blogs.msdn.com/uac/ UACBlog].&lt;/ref&gt; However, Windows NT and its successors are designed for security (including on a network) and multi-user PCs, but were not initially designed with Internet security in mind as much, since, when it was first developed in the early 1990s, Internet use was less prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0883396.html |title=Telephones and Internet Users by Country, 1990 and 2005 |publisher=Information Please Database |accessdate=June 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These design issues combined with programming errors (e.g. [[buffer overflow]]s) and the popularity of Windows means that it is a frequent target of [[computer worm]] and [[Computer virus|virus]] writers. In June 2005, [[Bruce Schneier]]âs ''Counterpane Internet Security'' reported that it had seen over 1,000 new viruses and worms in the previous six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram-0506.html |title=Crypto-Gram Newsletter |author=Bruce Schneier |authorlink=Bruce Schneier |date=June 15, 2005 |publisher=[[BT Counterpane|Counterpane Internet Security, Inc.]] |accessdate=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, [[Kaspersky Lab]] found around 11,000 malicious programsâviruses, Trojans, back-doors, and exploits written for Windows.&lt;ref name=&quot;Patrizio&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/3601946 |title=Linux Malware On The Rise |author=Andy Patrizio |date=April 27, 2006 |work=InternetNews |publisher=[[QuinStreet]] |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Microsoft releases security patches through its [[Windows Update]] service approximately once a month (usually the [[Patch Tuesday|second Tuesday]] of the month), although critical updates are made available at shorter intervals when necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Windows/Microsofts-Security-Response-Center-How-Little-Patches-Are-Made/ |title=Microsoft's Security Response Center: How Little Patches Are Made |author=Ryan Naraine |date=June 8, 2005 |work=[[eWeek]] |publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In versions of Windows after and including Windows 2000 SP3 and Windows XP, updates can be automatically downloaded and installed if the user selects to do so. As a result, Service Pack 2 for Windows XP, as well as Service Pack 1 for Windows Server 2003, were installed by users more quickly than it otherwise might have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/security/vulnerabilities/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=50900297 |title=Windows XP SP2 Distribution Surpasses 100 Million |author=John Foley |date=October 20, 2004 |work=[[InformationWeek]] |publisher=UBM TechWeb |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Windows 9x]] series offered the option of having profiles for multiple users, they had no concept of [[Principle of least privilege|access privileges]], and did not allow concurrent access; and so were not true [[multi-user]] operating systems. In addition, they implemented only partial [[memory protection]]. They were accordingly widely criticised for lack of security.

The [[Windows NT]] series of operating systems, by contrast, are true multi-user, and implement absolute memory protection. However, a lot of the advantages of being a true multi-user operating system were nullified by the fact that, prior to Windows Vista, the first user account created during the setup process was an [[Superuser#Windows NT|administrator]] account, which was also the default for new accounts. Though [[Windows XP]] did have limited accounts, the majority of home users did not change to an account type with fewer rights&amp;nbsp;â partially due to the number of programs which unnecessarily required administrator rights&amp;nbsp;â and so most home users ran as administrator all the time.

[[Windows Vista]] changes this&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft describes in detail the steps taken to combat this in a TechNet bulletin. Source: [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsvista/aa905073.aspx Windows Vista Security and Data Protection Improvements].&lt;/ref&gt; by introducing a privilege elevation system called [[User Account Control]]. When logging in as a standard user, a logon session is created and a [[Token (Windows NT architecture)|token]] containing only the most basic privileges is assigned. In this way, the new logon session is incapable of making changes that would affect the entire system. When logging in as a user in the Administrators group, two separate tokens are assigned. The first token contains all privileges typically awarded to an administrator, and the second is a restricted token similar to what a standard user would receive. User applications, including the [[Windows Shell]], are then started with the restricted token, resulting in a reduced privilege environment even under an Administrator account. When an application requests higher privileges or &quot;Run as administrator&quot; is clicked, UAC will prompt for confirmation and, if consent is given (including administrator credentials if the account requesting the elevation is not a member of the administrators group), start the process using the unrestricted token.&lt;ref name=&quot;kennykerr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://weblogs.asp.net/kennykerr/archive/2006/09/29/Windows-Vista-for-Developers-_1320_-Part-4-_1320_-User-Account-Control.aspx |title=Windows Vista for Developers&amp;nbsp;â Part 4&amp;nbsp;â User Account Control |author=Kenny Kerr |date=September 29, 2006 |accessdate=March 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===File permissions===
All Windows versions from Windows NT 3 have been based on a file system permission system referred to as AGLP (Accounts, Global, Local, Permissions) [[AGDLP]] which in essence where file permissions are applied to the file/folder in the form of a 'local group' which then has other 'global groups' as members. These global groups then hold other groups or users depending on different Windows versions used. This system varies from other vendor products such as [[Linux]] and [[NetWare]] due to the 'static' allocation of permission being applied directory to the file or folder. However using this process of AGLP/AGDLP/AGUDLP allows a small number of static permissions to be applied and allows for easy changes to the account groups without reapplying the file permissions on the files and folders.

===Windows Defender===
On January 6, 2005, Microsoft released a [[Beta version]] of Microsoft AntiSpyware, based upon the previously released [[GIANT Company Software|Giant]] AntiSpyware. On February 14, 2006, Microsoft AntiSpyware became [[Windows Defender]] with the release of Beta 2. Windows Defender is a freeware program designed to protect against spyware and other unwanted software. Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 users who have [[Windows Genuine Advantage|genuine]] copies of Microsoft Windows can freely download the program from Microsoft's web site, and Windows Defender ships as part of Windows Vista and 7.&lt;ref name=defendervista&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.Microsoft.com/Windowsvista/features/foreveryone/security.mspx |title=Windows Vista: Features |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=July 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third-party analysis===
In an article based on a report by Symantec,&lt;ref name=thereg&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/white_papers/ent-whitepaper_internet_security_threat_report_xi_03_2007.en-us.pdf |title=Symantec Internet Security Threat Report Trends for July&amp;nbsp;â December 2006 |date=March 2007 |work=Internet Security Threat Report Volume XI |publisher=Symantec |format=PDF |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; internetnews.com has described Microsoft Windows as having the &quot;fewest number of patches and the shortest average patch development time of the five operating systems it monitored in the last six months of 2006.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetnews.com/security/article.php/3667201 |title=Report Says Windows Gets The Fastest Repairs |author=Andy Patrizio |date=March 21, 2007 |work=InternetNews |publisher=QuinStreet |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study conducted by [[Kevin Mitnick]] and marketing communications firm Avantgarde in 2004 found that an unprotected and unpatched Windows XP system with Service Pack 1 lasted only 4 minutes on the Internet before it was compromised, and an unprotected and also unpatched Windows Server 2003 system was compromised after being connected to the internet for 8 hours.&lt;ref name=hackXP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avantgarde.com/ttln113004.html |title=Automated &quot;Bots&quot; Overtake PCs Without Firewalls Within 4 Minutes |date=November 30, 2004 |work=Avantgarde |publisher=Avantgarde |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is important to note that this study does not apply to Windows XP systems running the Service Pack 2 update (released in late 2004), which vastly improved the security of Windows XP.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} The computer that was running Windows XP Service Pack 2 was not compromised. The [[AOL]] National Cyber Security Alliance Online Safety Study of October 2004 determined that 80% of Windows users were infected by at least one [[spyware]]/[[adware]] product.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} Much documentation is available describing how to increase the security of Microsoft Windows products. Typical suggestions include deploying Microsoft Windows behind a hardware or software [[Firewall (computing)|firewall]], running [[anti-virus]] and [[anti-spyware]] software, and installing patches as they become available through Windows Update.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computer-security-news.com/0969/5-steps-to-securing-your-windows-xp-home-computer |title=5 Steps To Securing Your Windows XP Home Computer |author=Richard Rogers |date=September 21, 2009 |work=Computer Security News |publisher=Computer Security News |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Emulation software==

&lt;!-- Please do not put generic IBM PC emulators here. This section is for software that emulates Windows API. --&gt;

Emulation allows the use of some Windows applications without using Microsoft Windows. These include:
*[[Wine (software)|Wine]]&amp;nbsp;â a [[free and open source software]] implementation of the [[Windows API]], allowing one to run many Windows applications on x86-based platforms, including Linux and [[Mac OS X]]. Wine developers refer to it as a &quot;compatibility layer&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winehq.org/ Wine]&lt;/ref&gt; and make use of Windows-style APIs to emulate the Windows environment.
**[[CrossOver]]&amp;nbsp;â A Wine package with licensed fonts. Its developers are regular contributors to Wine, and focus on Wine running officially supported applications.
**[[Cedega (software)|Cedega]]&amp;nbsp;â [[TransGaming Technologies]]' proprietary [[Fork (software development)|fork]] of Wine, designed specifically for running games written for Microsoft Windows under Linux. A version of Cedega known as [[TransGaming Technologies#Cider|Cider]] is used by some video game publishers to allow Windows games to run on Mac OS X. Since Wine was licensed under the LGPL, Cedega has been unable to port the improvements made to Wine to their proprietary codebase. Cedega ceased its service in February 2011.
**[[Darwine]]&amp;nbsp;â A bundling of Wine to the [[PowerPC]] [[Macintosh|Macs]] running [[Mac OS X|OS X]] by running Wine on top of [[QEMU]]. Intel Macs use the same [[Wine (software)|Wine]] as other [[UNIX like|*NIX]] [[x86]] systems.
*[[ReactOS]]&amp;nbsp;â An open-source OS that is intended to run the same software as Windows, originally designed to simulate Windows NT 4.0, now aiming at Windows XP and Vista/7 compatibility. It has been in the [[development stage]] since 1996.
