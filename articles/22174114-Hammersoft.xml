'''College of St. John-Roxas''' (CSJ-R De La Salle), also known as ''St. John'', is a [[La Salle Supervised Schools | De La Salle]] supervised school located in [[Roxas City]], [[Philippines]]. It is formerly known as ''University of St. La Salle â Affiliate College'' and ''La Salle Affiliate College''. In June 2000, the school managed the high school department of [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Learning Center]] (Mount Carmel La Salle).

==History==
===Under the Supervision of the University of St. La Salle-Bacolod===

In the late 1990s, there was a growing demand for quality education in Capiz. It has been observed that many graduates in the local high schools go to big cities like [[Manila]], [[Cebu]], [[Bacolod]] and [[Iloilo]] to pursue college education. With this, concerned CapizeÃ±os in the persons of Mrs. Judy Roxas (mother of [[Mar Roxas]]), Atty. Antonio Ortiz, Dr. Abundio Balgos and Engr. Antonio Balgos met Br. Rolando Dizon FSC, then president of the [[University of St. La Salle| University of St. La Salle in Bacolod City]] and presented the idea of putting up a La Salle school in Roxas City. University of St. La Salle-Bacolod then supervised [[Our Lady of Mount Carmel Learning Center]] (also known as ''Mount Carmel La Salle''), the first [[De La Salle Supervised Schools|La Salle supervised school in Roxas City]] under Mrs. Norma Tagle of USLS-Bacolod. In June 1999, it was a dream made into reality when the '''University of St. La Salle â Affiliate College''' (USLS-AC) under the supervision of the University of St. La Salle in Bacolod City opened its doors to the youth of Capiz and the neighboring provinces in Panay Island. The first school building housed 10 classrooms, a science lab, a computer lab, a clinic, a prayer room, a library and administrative offices mostly located in the ground floor. The first school head and dean of the college was Dr. Teresita Atotubo, formerly the Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences at USLS- Bacolod. Br. Rolando Dizon FSC became its first President while Mrs. Judy Roxas was chosen as the first Chair of the Board of Trustees (BoT). The school initially offered four academic programs: Bachelor of Science in Accountancy, Bachelor of Science in Commerce with majors in Management Accounting, Business Management, Management Information Systems and Marketing, Bachelor of Science in Psychology, and Bachelor of Science in Biology. In that same school year, the school acquired a Multi-cab service car through the donation of [[De La Salle-College of St. Benilde]].

===The Turn Over of Mt. Carmel La Salle of its High School===

In June 2000, '''[[Mount Carmel La Salle]]''', also a University of St. La Salle supervised school in Roxas City, decided to turn over the management of its high school to USLS-AC due to the growing number of students and limited space of its school. Mount Carmel La Salle (OLMCLC) decided to retain and maintain its Pre-School and Grade School. The first principal of the high school department was Mrs. Marilyn Centillo. Mrs. Floramae Billanes was appointed principal effective SY 2001-2002. Also, USLS-AC started its application for the BS Nursing program. Consequently, DepEd granted approval for the opening of Pre â School and Grade 1 effective SY 2002-2003. Infrastructure improvements were the construction of basketball court, guard house, canteen, high school Home Economics room, and perimeter fence at the back of the main building.

===The Name Changed to La Salle Affiliate College===

At the start of SY 2002-2003, the name of the school was changed to La Salle Affiliate College. It was in that significant school year that the Preparatory School and Grade 1 were opened also under the management of Mrs. Billanes. The three academic programs in the college level were granted government recognition. The Commission on Higher Education (CHED) granted Government Permit to LSAC to operate the first year level of BS Nursing effective SY 2003-2004. Mrs. Judy Roxas visited LSAC to turn-over the proceeds of a benefit concert of [[Ogie Alcasid]], [[Randy Santiago]] and [[Zsa Zsa Padilla]] that was used in the construction of the Covered court roof.

===Under the Supervision of De La Salle University-Manila===

In May 2003, Dr. Rosemarie MontaÃ±ano became the Executive Vice-President and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences of LSAC and it was followed by the appointment of Atty. Antonio Ortiz as President of the school in July 26, 2003 since the post was vacated by Br. Rolando Dizon, FSC who was given the Chairmanship of the CHED. The supervision of the school was transferred to [[De La Salle University| De La Salle University-Manila]] and Br. Armin Luistro, FSC became the Chairman of the BoT. The BS Nursing Program was opened and Mrs. Ma. Ruby Fullon was appointed Dean. Ms. Rowena Banes became the Principal of the Integrated School succeeding Mrs. Billanes. For the first time LSAC submitted itself for Lasallian Schools Supervision Office (LASSO) Assessment Level 1. Also, in this school year, the second floor of the Pre-school building was completed.

In June 2004, Mrs. E. Regina Dabao was appointed Principal of the Pre-School, Grade School and High School. Infrastructure projects came to rise with the construction of the stage, and two classrooms of the Grade School. It was in this school year that Dr. Allyn Ricafuente was appointed Dean of the College of Nursing.

===The Name Changed to College of St. John-Roxas===

In April 2005, the BoT upon the advice of LASSO decided to change the name of the school into College of St. John - Roxas. Br. Armin Luistro, FSC came to Roxas to strengthen the decision. The administration decided to offer another program, the AB English. In 2006, the CSJ-R was assessed Level 1 by the LASSO.

For the school year 2006-2007, the College of Nursing had a new Dean in the person of Mr. Gilmore Solidum. The High School building was constructed and the Grade School building was completed. The first batch of BS Nursing graduated in April 2007.

In June 2007, Dr. Rosemarie MontaÃ±ano ended her term as EVP of CSJ-R. Dr. Emma A. Encarnacion became the Chancellor and Dean of the College of Arts and Sciences of CSJ-R. She was appointed by the BoT as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO) of the school. The transition paved the way to improving the schoolâs operation and instruction based on the Lasallian tradition and orientation. Some of her initial projects were the repainting and improvement of the buildings and school grounds; review of the vision-mission, core values and the formulation of the graduate attributes; review and revision of the curricula from Basic Education Unit (BEU) to College; and the Open House in the Basic Education Unit. In the college level, Mrs. Cora Diaz was appointed Dean of the College of Nursing by Dr. Encarnacion effective July 2007. The BSN pioneer batch took the December 2007 Nursing Licensure Exam garnering 68.75% against the national passing percentage of 43.3%. Also, the April 2007 batch of BS Accountancy got 66.67% against the national passing percentage of 40%, both the highest in Capiz.

Dr. Encarnacion together with the BoT reviewed and revised the organizational chart. For the first time in April 2008, there was an appointed dean other than the school head for the College of Arts, Sciences and Business (CASB) in the person of Ms. Roxanne IbaÃ±ez. The other new appointees are Ms. Jovi Albor as Finance Services Unit (FSU) Head, Mr. Mark Nel Venus as Assistant Dean for Students Affairs, Ms. Betty Miranda as Clinical Coordinator, Ms. Vanessa Rasco as Controller, Ms. Eimee Potato as Academic Support Services Office (ASSO) Director, Ms. Agatha Sheila Matutina as Office of Administrative Services (OAS) Director and Mr. Nestor Paul Pingil as Assistant Principal for Academic Affairs.
