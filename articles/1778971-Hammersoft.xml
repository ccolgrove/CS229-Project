{{Infobox KTM Komuter}}

'''KTM Komuter''' is a [[commuter train]] service in [[Malaysia]] operated by [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]] (KTMB). It was introduced in 1995 to provide local rail services in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and the surrounding [[Klang Valley]] suburban areas. It is popular with commuters into the city, who thus avoid being caught in road traffic congestion. The trains used are air-conditioned [[electric multiple units]]. 'Park &amp; Ride' facilities are provided at stations at a nominal charge.

KTM Komuter is currently the most profitable passenger service offered by KTMB, contributing RM84.63 million to group revenue in 2006, higher than [[KTM Intercity]]'s profit of 70.94 million in the same year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bizweek Back on track&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |last=Nathan |first=Darshini M. |title=Back on track: KTMB upgrades to be competitive |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|''Bizweek'', ''The Star'']]| location = Kuala Lumpur |date=6 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Ministry of Transport Malaysia 2008 Statistics, the ridership for the KTM Komuter is approximately 36.557 million passengers per annum&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Number of Passengers for Light Rail Transit (LRT) Services, 1999 - 2008 |url=http://www.mot.gov.my/stat/rel/2008/JADUAL_2.9_2008.pdf |publisher=Ministry of Transport}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

KTM Komuter's {{convert|175|km|mi|abbr=on}} network has 45 stations. It consists of two cross-city routes, namely the [[Sentul-Port Klang Route|Sentul-Port Klang]] and [[Rawang-Seremban Route|Rawang-Seremban]] lines, plus a [[Rawang-Seremban Route#Rawang-Tanjung Malim Shuttle Route|shuttle service from Rawang to Tanjung Malim]], which began in April 2007.

Transfers between the two main lines can be made at [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|KL Sentral]], [[Kuala Lumpur Railway Station|Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Putra Komuter station|Putra]] stations. Same-platform or [[cross-platform interchange]] is available at Kuala Lumpur. Passengers to and from stations between Rawang and Tanjung Malim must change trains at [[Rawang station]].

KTM Komuter has made shopping complexes and recreational centres more accessible. The [[Mid Valley Komuter station|Mid Valley station]], which opened in 2004 next to the [[Mid Valley Megamall]], has proved particularly popular.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Other shopping centres located near KTM Komuter stations are [[Subang Parade]], Carrefour Subang Jaya (near [[Subang Jaya Komuter station|Subang Jaya station]]) and [[The MINES]] ([[Serdang Komuter station|Serdang station]]).

Passengers for [[Kuala Lumpur International Airport]] (KLIA) may take the KTM Komuter to [[Nilai Komuter station|Nilai Komuter halt]] and change to an airport bus, or they may change at [[KL Sentral]] station on to the dedicated [[KLIA Ekspres]]. Interchange with the [[RapidKL Rail]] (KL city metro) network is available at [[Bandar Tasik Selatan station]] for the [[Ampang Line]] and at KL Sentral for the [[Kelana Jaya Line]]. Passengers may also transfer  to the Ampang Line in the city centre at [[Bank Negara Komuter station|Bank Negara station]] by means of a 200-metre walk to the [[Bandaraya LRT station]].

KTM Komuter tickets are sold at counters and via vending machines, available at all stations and halts.

The service is subject to overcrowding during rush hours. To help alleviate the problem, the operator introduced a new queuing system to help riders line up when the trains are coming. The lines are painted on the floor with three colour codes representing each of the train set. The system was first implemented at KL Sentral station on 17 October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=KTM implements new queuing scheme for passengers |url=http://thestar.com.my/metro/story.asp?file=/2008/10/24/central/2359467&amp;sec=central |newspaper=The Star |location= Kuala Lumpur |date=24 October 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-26 |author=Michael, Stuart}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operator is also considering introducing express services between [[Sungai Buloh]] and [[Kajang]] stations and between Kuala Lumpur and [[Shah Alam]] station during rush hours by the end of 2008.&lt;!----THIS NEEDS UPDATING-----&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Six trains for new services |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Sunday/National/2385838/Article/index_html |newspaper =New Straits Times |date=26 October 2008 |location= Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stations===

During the construction of the Komuter service, much of the existing lines were retained, with minor alterations (i.e. removal or abandonment of lines and replacement of wooden [[railroad tie|sleeper]]s with concrete ones). Relevant [[Railway platform|station platform]]s were required to be added and heightened to allow easier access to Komuter trains travelling on both directions.

Major pre-independence stations including [[Kuala Lumpur Railway Station|Kuala Lumpur station]], [[Klang Komuter station|Klang station]], [[Port Klang Komuter station|Port Klang station]] and [[Seremban station]] were retained and upgraded to support Komuter services. Smaller, wood-based stations and halts along the line that were built at around the same time as the aforementioned stations were either demolished and replaced by modern brick-and-concrete counterparts, or simply abandoned. The only exception to the rule is the old [[Sentul Komuter station|Sentul station]], which has remained in service years since KTM Komuter's launch, albeit with a replacement platform.

The layouts and sizes of the new station buildings, as of the launch of the service in 1995, vary by location but are generally divided into two classes:

*Railway halts, consisting of a small single-storey structure with only ticket counters (a ticket booth, ticket machines and [[Turnstile|faregate]]s). The stations are usually placed along straightforward dual-lane lines.
*Medium-sized and single-storey stations, housing both the ticket counters and station offices, and typically stationed along three or more lines. Such stations are typically intended to support additional responsibilities, such as managing [[railway signal]]s, controlling [[railroad switch|points]] and handling goods services. The stations themselves are similar in design to the original wood-based stations along the line with slight hints of Western colonial designs (arches, wooden-and-glass windows and wooden doors), but are larger and modernised.

The platforms of the 1995 stations are virtually standardised, down to the design of the passenger [[semicircle]]-crossed shelters, the use of similarly-styled foot crossings to link all platforms, and the diamonds-based brickwork of the platforms.

Depending on the amount of patrons through the years, each station has undergone upgrades or expansions that consist of either increasing the number of ticket counters or opening new facilities for use by passengers or railway staff. Taller, wider [[Canopy (building)|canopies]] were erected on the platforms of most stations to replace narrower, original versions in 2006 and 2007. The pace of the upgrades varies by location.

During the 2000s, new stations such as the [[Mid Valley Komuter station|Mid Valley station]] appeared in more modern designs, consisting primarily of high, curved canopies above the entire platforms. Certain new stations along dual-lane lines are also included with facilities typically reserved for medium-sized stations, such as the [[Rasa Komuter station|Rasa station]]. The [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral]] station, however, is housed under the concrete base of the transport hub, and is stark and utilitarian in design.

KTM Komuter serves the following stations:

==Rolling stock==
The rolling stock consists of three versions of three-car [[Electric multiple units|EMU]]s added over the course of three years, beginning in 1994. The EMUs were the first in KTM's history. All Komuter EMUs operate in [[multiple-unit]] formation, running from [[Overhead lines|overhead]] [[Single-phase electric power|single-phase]] 25kV [[Alternating current|AC]] 50&amp;nbsp;Hz [[Overhead lines#Overhead catenary|catenary]] supply, with two driving cars and 1 - 3 trailer cars in between. The EMUs were state-of-the-art, with remote-controlled pneumatic doors, Automatic Train Protection (ATP), train data recorder, wheel-slip control, GTO/IGBT traction electronics and regenerative braking. Up to the point of their introduction no other KTM motive power used these modern train control systems.

Designated by KTM as &quot;Class 8x&quot;s, the EMUs wear a yellow, blue and grey livery, a departure from the predominantly grey livery that KTM adopted on other locomotives and passenger coaches at the time. A handful of EMUs include full advertisements on the sides of their cars.

The original Komuter fleet consisted of the following models:
*18 [[KTM Class 81|Class 81 EMUs]] (designations EMU 01 to EMU 18) manufactured by [[Jenbacher Transport]] in Austria-Hungary (1994/1995)
*22 [[KTM Class 83|Class 83 EMUs]] (designations EMU 19 to EMU 40) manufactured by [[Hyundai Rotem|Hyundai]] (HPID) (1996/1997)
*22 [[KTM Class 82|Class 82 EMUs]] (designations EMU 41 to EMU 62) manufactured by [[Union Carriage &amp; Wagon]] in South Africa (1996/1997)

More rolling stock was ordered in 2010; 38 six-car EMUs were ordered from [[Zhuzhou Electric Locomotive Co., Ltd.|CSR Zhouzhou Electric Locomotive Co Ltd]]&lt;ref name=&quot;RG20101126&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.railwaygazette.com/nc/news/single-view/view/chinese-trains-to-expand-kl-komuter-fleet.html |accessdate=2010-11-28 |work=Railway Gazette International |title= Chinese trains to expand KL Komuter fleet |date=26 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the EMUs have since been decommissioned following serious accidents that affected their structural integrity, while another five are not listed as serviceable.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} On paper, the number of serviceable units stands at 53 out of the original 62, although there are reports of far fewer trains.&lt;ref name=&quot;RG20101126&quot;/&gt; However, the actual number of trains is set to rise back to the original, as trains are being reconditioned.

Future Komuter fleet is expected to include:
*38 [[KTM Class 92|Class 92 EMUs]] manufactured by China's Zhu Zhou Electric Locomotives Co Ltd

==Expansion and future plans==

===New routes and stations===
During the 2000s, the Komuter line saw the addition of seven more stations:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Construction of New Commuter Stations |url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1385 |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927051731/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1385 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Kuala Lumpur Sentral|Kuala Lumpur Sentral station]], opened 16 April 2001, includes platforms for both the Rawang-Seremban route and the Sentul-Port Klang route. While KL Sentral took over the [[Kuala Lumpur Railway Station]]'s role of interchange with Intercity train services, the latter remains a separate stop for KTM Komuter services.
*The [[Mid Valley Komuter station|Mid Valley station]], opened 23 August 2004, primarily serves users of the adjoining [[Mid Valley Megamall]] and adjacent commercial facilities.
*[[Kepong Sentral Komuter station|Kepong Sentral]], opened 1 July 2006, stands beside the [[Kuala Lumpur Middle Ring Road 2|Middle Ring Road Two]] in the KL suburb of Kepong, on the Rawang-Seremban route.
*The [[Serendah Komuter station|Serendah]], [[Batang Kali Komuter station|Batang Kali]] and [[Rasa Komuter station|Rasa]] stations, opened 21 April 2007, form part of a new stretch of electrified railway towards Ipoh from Rawang station. A shuttle service known as the Rawang-Rasa shuttle runs between Rawang and these three stations.
*The [[Kuala Kubu Bharu Komuter station|Kuala Kubu Bharu]] station, opened 5 January 2008. The Rawang-Rasa shuttle service is thus renamed as the Rawang-Kuala Kubu Bharu shuttle service.
*The shuttle route was extended to [[Tanjung Malim railway station|Tanjung Malim]] station on 1 June 2009.
* The [[Sentul-Port Klang Route]] has been extended to [[Batu Caves]] since 29 July 2010, with four new stations.

===Route expansion in progress===

Besides new stations, additional plans were made to extend the Komuter network outwards from it original route:
*The {{convert|179|km|mi|abbr=on}} Rawang-Ipoh electrification and double-tracking project will ultimately allow the KTM Komuter service to be extended to [[Tanjung Malim]] on the [[Selangor]]-[[Perak]] border, nearly {{convert|100|km|mi}} from Kuala Lumpur. The project has suffered several delays for various reasons, but has seen limited revitalisation. The first phase of the extension, which includes {{convert|22|km|mi}} of rebuilt railway lines and three new stations, became operational when a shuttle service from the Rawang stations was launched on 21 April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Electrified Double Track Project Between Rawang and Ipoh |url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=46 |accessdate=2007-06-17 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070915051950/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=46 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-15 |publisher=KTMB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The service was extended to Kuala Kubu Bharu on 5 January 2008&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ktmb.com.my/Article.asp?Id=2402 KTM Komuter New Route : Rawang - Kuala Kubu Bharu]&lt;/ref&gt;. Shuttle service to [[Tanjung Malim Komuter station|Tanjung Malim]] and Ipoh will begin by December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Friday/National/2135207/Article/index_html |title=3,000 squatters to be relocated for rail link |work =New Straits Times |location =Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!----INADEQUATE REFERENCE -- needs a publication date----&gt;
*A {{convert|7.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, four-station extension from the Sentul station to [[Batu Caves]] has been approved. The project - which will cost RM515&amp;nbsp;million - will include electrification, double-tracking and refitting the existing old track, signalling, and communications, as well as construction of new stations at [[Sentul Komuter station|Sentul]], Batu Cantonment, Batu Village, Taman Wahyu and Batu Caves. Site possession was given to contractor YTL Corporation Berhad on 17 November 2006, and the project is to be completed by April 2010. The Sentul station is part of the Sentul Raya masterplan development under YTL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landasan Berkembar Elektrik Sentul-Batu Caves (Sentul-Batu Caves double tracking and electrification) |url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1995 |accessdate= 2007-06-14 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927062032/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1995 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27 |publisher=KTMB}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Keretapi Tanah Melayu|KTMB]] also plans to extend {{convert|8.5|km|mi|abbr=on}} Komuter services to [[Senawang]] and [[Sungai Gadut]], [[Negeri Sembilan]]. Construction is expected to complete by 2011. This will be part of the Seremban-Gemas line.&lt;ref name=&quot;thestar 7 feb 08&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/2/7/nation/20261095&amp;sec=nation |title= KTMB spends RM200mil on new intercity and commuter trains |work =The Star |location =Kuala Lumpur |date= 7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other projects===
*'''Upgrading of KTM Komuter stations:''' In 2005, KTMB awarded a contract for the construction of roof canopies and the upgrading of facilities for 29 stations in the KTM Komuter network. The new roof design is similar to that used for the new Midvalley and Kepong Sentral stations. Previously, station roofing was limited and covered only part of the platform and did not extend over the tracks&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Upgrading of Existing Station Facilities |url=http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1568 |accessdate=2007-06-17 |publisher=KTMB |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927061746/http://www.ktmb.com.my/article.asp?id=1568 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Bank Negara Komuter station|Bank Negara halt]]'s upgrading is more major than those being carried out at the other stations, as it involves creating a new mezzanine floor above the current platforms. The RM6 million upgrading was expected to be completed by October 2007. However, it was only completed in April 2008.
*'''Electronic payment scheme:''' On 1 July 2005, all KTM Komuter stations began accepting the contactless [[Touch 'n Go]] electronic stored value card for fare payments. All stations opened after that date came ready with Touch 'n Go facilities, although at the four new stations on the [[Rawang-Seremban Route#Rawang-Kuala Kubu Bharu Shuttle Route|Rawang-Kuala Kubu Bharu Shuttle Route]], namely Serendah, Batang Kali, Rasa and Kuala Kubu Bharu, the readers are located at the counter window next to the manual lane rather than at the automatic fare gates. KTM Komuter's adoption of the Touch 'n Go system is part of the government's move to make the card the common ticket for all public transport. The contract to integrate the electronic fare collection system with KTM Komuter's existing fare collection system, and all related works such as the installation of farecard readers, was given to Pradonet Sdn Bhd in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=KTMB Komuter â Common Ticketing System |url=http://www.pradonet.com.my/home.php?op=8#ktm1 |accessdate=2007-06-18}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move to implement the common ticketing electronic payment scheme initially ran into problems, primarily over the inability of the transport providers and the Touch' n Go system operator, Rangkaian Segar Sdn Bhd, to agree on commissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |author= Leong Shen-li |title=Still no go |newspaper=[[The Star (Malaysia)|The Star]] |page=1 |date=22 April 2005 |location =Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Malaysian government had to step in and pushed for the common ticketing project to be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Rajendra |first=Edward |last2=Cheah |first2=Royce |title=No more excuses, says Chan |newspaper=The Star |location =Kuala Lumpur |page=4 |date=23 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''New coaches:''' As a part of its expansion program, KTM announced on 7 February 2008 that it would purchase new trains for intercity and commuter routes worth RM200 million. 20 intercity and 8 commuter train sets, with four cars per set, would provide increased passenger capacity compared with the three-car trains previously serving the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/2/7/nation/20261095&amp;sec=nation |title= KTMB spends RM200mil on new intercity and commuter trains |work=The Star |location =Kuala Lumpur |date=7 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 April 2008, KTM announced its intention to buy an additional five electric train sets, for delivery in 2010. The 13 electric trains will be used to serve Kuala Lumpur-Ipoh commuter routes, with a journey time of 2 hours 20 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=KTM to have five new commuter trains in two years |url=http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Monday/NewsBreak/20080428154739/Article/index_html |publisher=New Straits Times |location =Kuala Lumpur |date= 28 April 2008 |accessdate=2008-04-28 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080501193044/http://www.nst.com.my/Current_News/NST/Monday/NewsBreak/20080428154739/Article/index_html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents and accidents==
*On the evening of 3 March 2004, a [[Seremban]]-bound KTM Komuter train in the [[Rawang-Seremban Route]] collided with the rear of another Komuter train facing the same direction, which had been waiting at a signal between [[Tiroi Komuter station|Tiroi station]] and [[Seremban station]] for five minutes. Forty were injured, but no deaths were reported. The accident was ascribed to the faulty signal light (struck by lightning) that stopped the earlier train, though the driver of the rear-ending train is reported to have run a red light into the section occupied by the rear-ended train. The resulting crash disrupted KTM Komuter services along the line for a day. This is so far the worst accident involving the KTM Komuter service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Komuter crash |newspaper=The Star |location =Kuala Lumpur |page=1 |date=3 March 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 2 March 2007, a crane fell on to a KTM Komuter train track near the [[Sentul-Port Klang Route]]'s [[Shah Alam Komuter station]], stranding about 10,000 passengers and cancelling 40 trips. Alternative transport services were provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Crane Falls On Rail Tracks, 10,000 Passengers Stranded |agency=Bernama |date=2 March 2007 |url=http://www.bernama.com.my/bernama/v3/news.php?id=249428 |accessdate=2007-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 25 May 2007, a person was killed after he was hit by a KTM Komuter train while crossing the tracks illegally. Deaths in this manner have occurred along Komuter lines before.
*On 27 February 2008, overhead power cables between Subang Jaya and Petaling stations of the Sentul-Port Klang route broke, causing all train services to be modified to run on the Sentul-Petaling route instead.
*On 22 October 2009, a multipurpose vehicle plunged into the railway track as as it was heading from Kuala Lumpur towards [[Subang Jaya]]. Train services were disrupted, and the vehicle was towed away 3 hours after the accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=MPV plunges onto railway tracks |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2009/10/23/nation/4960100&amp;sec=nation |date=22 October 2009 |work=The Star |location =Kuala Lumpur}}&lt;/ref&gt;
