'''Stephen John''' &quot;'''Steve'''&quot; '''Nash''', [[Order of Canada|OC]], [[Order of British Columbia|OBC]] (born 7 February 1974) is a [[South Africa|South African]]-born [[Canadians|Canadian]] professional [[basketball]] player who plays [[point guard]] for the [[Phoenix Suns]] of the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA). Nash enjoyed a successful [[high-school]] basketball career, and he was eventually given a scholarship by [[Santa Clara Broncos#Men's Basketball|Santa Clara University]]. In his four seasons with the Broncos, the team made three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournament]] appearances, and Nash was twice named the [[West Coast Conference]] Player of the Year.

After graduating from Santa Clara as the team's all-time leader in [[assist (basketball)|assists]], Nash entered the [[1996 NBA Draft]] and was selected as the 15th pick by the Phoenix Suns. He made a minimal impact, and was traded to the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in 1998. By his third season with the Mavericks, he was voted into his first [[NBA All-Star Game]] and had earned his first [[All-NBA]] selection. Together with [[Dirk Nowitzki]] and [[Michael Finley]], Nash led the Mavericks to the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Finals the [[2002â03 NBA season|following season]]. However, he became a [[free agent]] after the {{nbay|2003|app=season}} and returned to the Phoenix Suns.

In the {{nbay|2004|app=season}}, Nash led the Suns to the Western Conference Finals, and was named [[NBA MVP|the league's Most Valuable Player]] (MVP). He was named MVP again in the {{nbay|2005|app=season}}, and missed out on a third consecutive MVP title to Nowitzki [[2006â07 NBA season|the next season]]. Named by [[ESPN]] in 2006 as the ninth greatest point guard of all time, Nash has led the league in assists and [[free-throw]] percentage at various points in his career. He is also ranked as one of the top players in NBA league history for [[three-point field goal|three-point shooting]], free-throw shooting, total assists and assists per game.

Nash has been honoured for his contributions to various philanthropic causes. In 2006, he was named by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. He also received the [[Order of Canada]] in 2007, and was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] by the [[University of Victoria]] in 2008.

== Early life ==
{{Quote_box|width=30%|align=left|quote=My heroes were [[Isiah Thomas]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[Magic Johnson]]. I think they were just so competitive and creative. Especially Isiah, he was somebody that wasn't very tall.

Nash was born in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]] to a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] mother and an [[English people|English]] father on 7 February 1974.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&amp;DocID=5252 Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada], gg.ca, accessed 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protocol.gov.bc.ca/protocol/news/BG-2006_OBC.pdf Stephen John Nash], protocol.gov.bc.ca, accessed 9 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;foundation&quot;&gt;[http://www.stevenash.org/html/about.html About Steve], stevenash.org, accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; His family moved to [[Regina, Saskatchewan|Regina]], [[Saskatchewan]], when he was 18 months old, then to [[Vancouver]], before finally settling in [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]], [[British Columbia]].&lt;ref name=jock&gt;[http://www.jockbio.com/Bios/Nash/Nash_bio.html Steve Nash], jockbio.com, accessed 6 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Nash played [[soccer]] and [[ice hockey]], often with his younger brother [[Martin Nash (soccer)|Martin]], he did not start playing basketball until he was 12 or 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;hero&quot;/&gt; However, in grade eight, he told his mother that one day he would play in the [[NBA]] and become a star.&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt;

== High school ==
Nash originally attended [[Mount Douglas Secondary School]], but after his grades began to drop, his parents decided to enroll him at [[St. Michaels University School]], a private [[boarding school]].&lt;ref name=kid/&gt; At St. Michaels, he starred in basketball, soccer, and [[rugby union]]. While playing basketball during his senior season, Nash averaged 21.3 [[point (basketball)|points]], 11.2 [[assist (basketball)|assists]], and 9.1 [[rebound (basketball)|rebounds]] per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/steve_nash/bio.html Steve Nash Bio Page], nba.com, accessed 8 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1991â92 season, he led his team in his final year to the British Columbia AAA provincial championship title, and was named the province's Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;Hyde-Lay, Ian, [http://www.smus.bc.ca/news_cal/review/050509nash.html Steve Nash - NBA MVP], smus.bc.ca, accessed 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== College career ==

Although Nash's high school coach, Ian Hyde-Lay, sent letters of inquiry and highlight reels on Nash's behalf to over 30 American universities, Nash was not recruited by any university,&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; until [[Santa Clara Broncos#Men's Basketball|Santa Clara]] coach Dick Davey requested video footage of the young guard. After watching Nash in person, Davey said he &quot;was nervous as hell just hoping that no one else would see him. It didn't take a [[Nobel Prize]] winner to figure out this guy's pretty good. It was just a case of hoping that none of the big names came around.&quot;&lt;ref name=kid/&gt; However, Davey also told Nash that he was &quot;the worst defensive player&quot; he had ever seen.&lt;ref name=kid/&gt;

Nash was awarded a scholarship by Santa Clara for the [[1993 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992â93 season]]. At that time, it had been five years since the Broncos appeared in the NCAA tournament. That changed when Nash led the Broncos to a [[West Coast Conference]] (WCC) Tournament title and an upset win over the No. 2 seeded [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]] in the first round of the NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament.&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; In that game, Nash scored six straight [[free throw]]s in the last 30 seconds of the contest.&lt;ref name=kid/&gt; Although Santa Clara was defeated by [[Temple Owls men's basketball|Temple]] in the next round, the 1992â93 campaign was considered a successful one. However, the Broncos failed to sustain the momentum the following season, and only managed a 5â7 record in the conference.&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; The team rebounded in the [[1995 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1994â95 season]], with Nash being named Conference Player of the Year and the Broncos topping the WCC.&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; Featuring the league leader for scoring and assists in Nash, the Broncos returned to the NCAA tournament, but they were defeated by [[Mississippi State Bulldogs men's basketball|Mississippi State]].&lt;ref name=jock/&gt; After the season, Nash contemplated turning professional, and decided against it when he learned that he would probably not be considered as a first-round pick in the [[1995 NBA Draft]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt;

In the [[1996 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1995â96 season]], Nash began attracting the attention of the national media and professional scouts. He had spent the summer before that honing his skills, playing with the [[Canada national basketball team|Canadian national team]] and working out with the likes of established NBA players [[Jason Kidd]] and [[Gary Payton]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt; Santa Clara again captured the WCC title, and for the second consecutive year, Nash was named Conference Player of the Year, the first Bronco to do so since [[Kurt Rambis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; He scored 28 points in leading the #10 seed Broncos to a first round upset win over #7 seed [[Maryland Terrapins men's basketball|Maryland]], but then the Broncos were eliminated by [[Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball|Kansas]].  Nash's performances ensured that he was named Honorable Mention [[All-America]] as a senior by [[The Associated Press]] and the [[USBWA]]. He also finished his career as Santa Clara's all-time leader in career assists (510), free-throw percentage (.862), and made and attempted [[three-pointer]]s (263â656).&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; He remains third on the school's all-time scoring list (1,689), and holds Santa Clara's single-season free-throw percentage record (.894).&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; In September 2006, Nash had his jersey (#11) retired, becoming the first Santa Clara student-athlete to receive that honour.&lt;ref name=&quot;sant&quot;&gt;[http://www.scu.edu/news/releases/release.cfm?month=0906&amp;story=Nash_PostConvocation Former SCU Basketball Star Steve Nash Honored by Alma Mater], scu.edu, 18 September 2006, accessed 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== NBA career ==
[[Image:Steve Nash 2.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nash averaged 10.5 minutes a game in his rookie year.]]

=== Phoenix Suns (1996â98) ===
After graduating with a degree in sociology,&lt;ref name=&quot;kid&quot;/&gt; Nash was selected 15th overall by the [[Phoenix Suns]] in the first round of the [[1996 NBA Draft]]. Upon hearing the draft announcement, Suns fans booed in disapproval of the relatively unknown player.&lt;ref name=&quot;kid&quot;/&gt; This was because despite his impressive college accomplishments, Nash had not played in one of the [[BCS conference|major college conferences]]. During his first two seasons in the NBA, Nash played a supporting role behind NBA star point guards [[Kevin Johnson]], [[Sam Cassell]], and later, [[Jason Kidd]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt; Both Johnson and Cassell had [[NBA Finals]] experience, while Kidd was the second overall pick in the [[1994 NBA Draft]] and already an All-Star when he arrived at Phoenix.  

In his rookie season, Nash only managed 10.5 minutes a game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; but in his second season, his playing time increased significantly and he was even ranked 13th in the league for three-point field-goal percentage.&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, the Canadian's tenure with the Suns did not last. While at [[Santa Clara Broncos#Men's Basketball|Santa Clara]], Nash had met and befriended [[Dallas Mavericks]] assistant coach [[Donnie Nelson]], who worked for the [[Golden State Warriors]] at that time. After moving to Dallas, Nelson was able to convince his father, [[Don Nelson]]âthen the Mavericks coach and general managerâto acquire the under-utilised Nash.&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt; Following the [[1998 NBA Draft]], Nash was traded from the Suns to the Mavericks in exchange for [[Martin MÃ¼Ã¼rsepp]], [[Bubba Wells]], the draft rights to [[Pat Garrity]] and a first-round draft pick (who later turned out to be future Phoenix team-mate [[Shawn Marion]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt;

=== Dallas Mavericks (1998â2004) ===
It was in Dallas that Nash established himself as a formidable point guard, beginning a decade as one of the game's top players. During his first year as a Maverick (the [[lockout (industry)|lockout]]-shortened {{nbay|1998|app=season}}) he started in all 40 games he played in, and averaged 7.9 points, 2.9 rebounds and 5.5 assists per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playerfile/steve_nash/career_stats.html Steve Nash Info Page - Career Stats and Totals], nba.com, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The 19â31 Mavericks failed to [[1999 NBA Playoffs|make the playoffs]] but in the [[1999â2000 NBA season|1999â2000 season]], the team's prospects improved considerably. Nash missed 25 mid-season games due to an ankle injury, but came back to record six [[Double (basketball)#Double-double|double-double]]s in the last month of play.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; He finished the season with averages of 8.6 points and 4.9 assists per game.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; More importantly for the team, second-year teammate and friend [[Dirk Nowitzki]] was blossoming quickly into a top player, veteran [[Michael Finley]] was having an [[National Basketball Association All-Star Game|All-Star]]-calibre year, and the team's new owner, billionaire [[Mark Cuban]], was bringing new energy and excitement to the franchise. Nash now had a supportive environment in which he could thrive.

In the {{nbay|2000|app=season}}, Nash averaged 15.6 points and 7.3 assists per game in a breakout season.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; With Nash directing the team's offense, Nowitzki and Finley playing at their best, and the acquisition of All-Star [[Juwan Howard]] complementing the high-scoring trio, the Mavericks [[2001 NBA Playoffs|earned a playoff berth]] for the first time in more than a decade. Dallas lost in the [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] Semifinals four games to one to the [[San Antonio Spurs]], but it marked the beginning of a memorable run for Nash and the Mavericks.&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press''. [http://www.nba.com/playoffs2001/semi/west1/recap_dal_sas_010514.html?nav=ArticleList Say Hello to Hollywood], nba.com, 14 May 2001, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In the {{nbay|2001|app=season}}, Nash posted career-highs of 17.9 points and 7.7 assists per game&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; and earned a spot in the [[NBA All-Star Game]] and on the [[All-NBA Third Team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;bref&quot;&gt;[http://www.basketball-reference.com/players/n/nashst01.html Steve Nash], basketball-reference.com, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/awards/20012002.html Postseason Awards - 2001-02], nba.com/history, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He was now an All-Star, increasingly appearing in television commercials and, with Finley and Nowitzki, a part of the Dallas Mavericks &quot;Big Three.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allposters.com/-sp/-Posters_i359298_.htm 2001-2002 Dallas Mavericks Big Three], allposters.com, accessed 12 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Dallas earned [[2002 NBA Playoffs|another trip to the playoffs]] but lost again in the Semifinals to the [[Sacramento Kings]] four games to one.&lt;ref&gt;''Ticker''. [http://www.nba.com/games/20020513/DALSAC/recap.html Sacramento Stampedes Into Conference Finals], nba.com, 13 May 2002, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash closely replicated his previous season's performance in the {{nbay|2002|app=season}}, averaging 17.7 points and 7.3 assists per game,&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; again earning All-Star and All-NBA Third Team honours.&lt;ref name=&quot;bref&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/history/awards/20022003.html Postseason Awards - 2002-03], nba.com/history, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nowitzki and Nash led the Mavericks from a 14-game winning streak to open the season all the way to the Western Conference Finals, where they lost to the eventual NBA champions, the San Antonio Spurs four games to two.&lt;ref&gt;''Ticker''. [http://www.nba.com/games/20030529/SASDAL/recap.html Kerr Spurs San Antonio to Finals], nba.com, 29 May 2003, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It was only the second Conference Finals appearance in the franchise's history. The {{nbay|2003|app=season}} saw an offensively boosted Mavericks roster (with the acquisitions of [[Antoine Walker]] and [[Antawn Jamison]]) but a dip in Nash's scoring contributions. As a result he was not selected for the All-Star and All-NBA team rosters even though he achieved new career highs in assists per game (8.8) and free-throw accuracy (91.6%).&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; In [[2004 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], the fifth-seeded Dallas failed to make progress yet again as the Sacramento Kings saw them off four games to one.&lt;ref&gt;''Ticker''. [http://www.nba.com/games/20040429/DALSAC/recap.html Kings Dismiss Mavericks], nba.com, 29 April 2004, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 2003â04 season, Nash became a [[free agent]]. He attempted to negotiate a long-term contract with Cuban, who was paying Walker, Finley, Nowitzki and Jamison nearly $50 million in combined salaries that season. Cuban wanted to build his franchise around the younger Nowitzki and did not want to risk signing the 30-year-old Nash to a long-term deal, and offered Nash a four-year deal worth about $9 million annually, with a fifth year partially guaranteed. The [[Phoenix Suns]] on the other hand offered the point guard a six-year, $63 million contract. Nash was reluctant to leave Dallas and returned to Cuban to see if he would match the deal; Cuban did not, and Nash signed for the Suns for the {{nbay|2004|app=season}}. The Canadian would go on to win two [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|League MVP]] awards with Phoenix, and on a 14 June 2006 appearance on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', Cuban wondered out loud, &quot;... you know Steve's a great guy and I love him to death, but why couldn't he play like an MVP for us?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Carlton, Chuck, [http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/spt/basketball/mavs/stories/061506dnspoletterman.e9ce.html &quot;Cuban takes his act to Letterman&quot;], ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'', 15 June 2006, accessed 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to Phoenix Suns (2004âpresent) ===
Nash joined a Suns team which had emerging young players in [[Shawn Marion]], [[Joe Johnson (basketball)|Joe Johnson]] and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]]. In the season before Nash arrived, the Suns had recorded a 29â53 winâloss record,&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt; and they were projected to have another poor season. Head coach [[Mike D'Antoni]] favoured an up-tempo style of basketball; this required smaller and more athletic players with the capability to outrun and outshoot their opponents. Nash's familiarity with this style combined with the athleticism of his teammates produced an NBA-best 62â20 record and a points-per-game average of 110.4, the highest in a decade.&lt;ref&gt;Faye, Brad and Greene, Josh, [http://www.nba.com/suns/history/0405_recap.html &quot;Back On The Right Track&quot;], nba.com/suns, accessed 10 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The catalyst of this turnaround, Nash averaged 11.5 assists per game while making 50.2% of his field goals and 43.1% of his three-pointers in the regular season.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kalb&quot;&gt;Kalb, Elliot, [http://www.nba.com/encyclopedia/suns_ontherise.html &quot;On the Rise?&quot;], nba.com, accessed 7 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He edged [[Shaquille O'Neal]] to win the {{nbay|2004}} [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA MVP award]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/news/nash_mvp_050508.html Steve Nash Named 2004-05 NBA MVP], nba.com, 8 May 2005, accessed 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; becoming the first Canadian to earn the honour, as well as the third point guard ever to be named MVP, along with [[Magic Johnson]] and [[Bob Cousy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; In [[2005 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], Phoenix swept the [[Memphis Grizzlies]] in four games before meeting the [[Dallas Mavericks]] in the second round.&lt;ref name=&quot;po&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2005/ataglance.html At a Glance], nba.com/playoffs2005, accessed 17 November 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash led the Suns to a 4â2 series win,&lt;ref name=&quot;po&quot;/&gt; and the Suns reached the Western Conference finals for the first time since 1993, but lost to the eventual NBA Champions and arch-rival, the [[San Antonio Spurs]], in five games.&lt;ref name=&quot;po&quot;/&gt;

In the {{nbay|2006|app=season}}, Nash had another stellar campaign, averaging 18.6 points and a career-high 11.6 assists per game while becoming the first person since Magic Johnson in {{nbay|1990}} to average 18 points and 11 assists per game during the regular season.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007allnba&quot;&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2866331 Bryant, Nowitzki, Duncan also part of All-NBA team], sports.espn.go.com, 14 May 2007, accessed 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash received the most votes for first-team All-NBA and was joined by teammate Stoudemire; the two were the first teammates to make the first team since [[Kobe Bryant]] and Shaquille O'Neal in {{nbay|2003}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007allnba&quot;/&gt; Nash received 129 first-place votes and 645 total points from the panel of 129 media members.&lt;ref name=&quot;2007allnba&quot;/&gt; He narrowly missed being MVP a third consecutive time, coming in second with 44 first place votes to 83 for [[Dirk Nowitzki]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/news/dirkmvp_2007.html &quot;Dirk Nowitzki Wins 2006-07 MVP Award&quot;], nba.com. accessed 16 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[2007 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]], the Suns eliminated the Lakers in five games, but were unable to overcome the Spurs in the Conference Semifinals, losing the series 4â2.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2007/series/index.html At a Glance 2007], nba.com, accessed 29 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shaq and Nash.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Nash with then-teammate [[Shaquille O'Neal]]]]
Nash played in 81 regular-season games during the {{nbay|2007|app=season}}; in this campaign, the Western Conference was especially competitive and he led the Suns to 55 wins and the sixth seed for the [[2008 NBA Playoffs]]. Although there was a dip in his regular-season output, Nash's shooting remained sharp; the accuracy of his shooting was on par with his 2005â06 MVP campaign (shooting at least 50% from the field, 40% from the three-point arc, and 90% from the free throw line).&lt;ref name=&quot;nashstats&quot;/&gt; On 31 January 2008, he collected his All-Star stripes for the sixth time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/allstar2008/reserves_080131.html Two Hometown Hornets Named as Reserves for 2008 NBA All-Star Game], nba.com, 31 January 2008, accessed 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nash continued to experience agony in the playoffs. Despite a mid-season trade that sent Shawn Marion to the [[Miami Heat]] and brought four-time NBA champion Shaquille O'Neal to the team, the Suns were defeated in the first round of [[2008 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] by the San Antonio Spurs for the third time in four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;out&quot;&gt;[http://www.nba.com/playoffs2008/series/series_w1s3.html Spurs KO Rattled Suns to Close Out Series], nba.com, 30 April 2008, accessed 1 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In the deciding Game 5, Nash was perceived to have suffered from &quot;elimination-game jitters&quot;, and turned over the ball twice in the final two minutes of what was a tight contest.&lt;ref name=&quot;out&quot;/&gt; Nevertheless, Nash was later named to the All-NBA Second Team for the 2007â08 season.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/news/all_nba_080508.html MVP Kobe Bryant Highlights All-NBA First Team], nba.com, 8 May 2008, accessed 9 May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the {{nbay|2008|app=season}} began, coach D'Antoni was replaced by [[Terry Porter]], who preferred a more defensive-oriented style of basketball. The Suns had difficulties adapting to this new system, and even a December trade involving sending stalwarts [[Raja Bell]] and [[Boris Diaw]] to the [[Charlotte Bobcats]] for athletic [[swingman]] [[Jason Richardson]]&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Marc, [http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3760914 Suns get high-scoring Richardson], sports.espn.go.com, 12 December 2008, accessed 14 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; saw the team continue to struggle. Porter was then replaced by [[Alvin Gentry]] in February after a 28&amp;ndash;23 record, but the Suns were unable to secure the final seed for the [[2009 NBA Playoffs|playoffs]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basketball-reference.com/leagues/NBA_2009.html 2008-09 NBA Season Summary], basketball-reference.com, accessed 19 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in Nash missing the playoffs for the first time since he returned to Phoenix for his second stint.

Nash and the Suns opened the {{nbay|2009|app=season}} with a series of strong performances, going 8â1 in their first nine games (a franchise-best since {{nbay|1980}}), with Nash producing two 20-assists games.&lt;ref&gt;Jasner, Andy, [http://www.nba.com/games/20091109/PHXPHI/recap.html &quot;Suns race by Sixers behind Nash's 21 points, 20 assists&quot;], nba.com, 9 November 2009, accessed 10 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 January 2010, Nash was named as the starting point guard for the West for the 2010 NBA All-Star Game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/allstar2010/news/story?id=4846991 All-Star starters announced Thursday], sports.espn.go.com, 21 January 2010, accessed 22 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; With him operating at the point, the Suns were the highest-scoring team in the league for the fifth season in a row, and were seeded third in the conference for [[2010 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]] with 54 wins. Behind solid performances by Richardson and veteran [[Grant Hill]], the Suns defeated the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] 4â2 in the first round of the playoffs, and swept the Spurs 4â0 in the second round. The Suns met the defending champions, Los Angeles Lakers, in the Conference Finals. After losing the first two games, Phoenix won the next two to tie the series. A [[Ron Artest]] buzzer-beater in Game 5 pushed the Lakers one game closer to the Finals, and [[Kobe Bryant]]'s 37 points in Game 6 completed the defeat of the Suns.

The Suns underwent two major roster changes in the {{nbay|2010|app=season}}. During the pre-season, Stoudemire left for [[New York Knicks|New York]], while longtime teammate [[Leandro Barbosa]] was traded for [[Hedo TÃ¼rkoÄlu]]. [[Josh Childress]] and [[Hakim Warrick]] were also recruited to join the Suns. Not long after the season began, TÃ¼rkoÄlu, Richardson, and [[Earl Clark]] were traded to [[Orlando Magic|Orlando]] for [[Vince Carter]], [[Marcin Gortat]], and [[MickaÃ«l PiÃ©trus]], while rising star [[Goran Dragic]] was traded to the [[Houston Rockets]] for [[Aaron Brooks (basketball)|Aaron Brooks]].&lt;ref name=2011repcard&gt;[http://www.nba.com/reportcard/midseason/2011/suns/ Phoenix Suns Report Card], nba.com, accessed 20 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The Suns had difficulty being even a .500 team, and for the second time since Nash returned to Phoenix, the Suns failed to make [[2011 NBA Playoffs|the playoffs]].

In 1993, while in college, Nash played for the [[Canada national men's basketball team|national team]] and competed in the [[Canada Games]] and [[World University Games]]. He won a bronze medal at the Canada Games and won a silver medal at the World University Games, losing to [[United States national basketball team|Team USA]], which included players such as [[Michael Finley]] and [[Damon Stoudamire]].&lt;ref name=&quot;jock&quot;/&gt;

Nash captained Canada at the [[Basketball at the 2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney Olympics in 2000]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/columns/newsmakers/steve_nash.html Hoser makes hoops history, again], cbc.ca, 8 May 2006, accessed 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; He led Canada to win their round robin group with a victory over [[Spain national basketball team|Spain]] and a stunning 83â75 win over favoured [[FR Yugoslavia national basketball team|Yugoslavia]] when he scored 26 points with eight rebounds and eight assists. Canada was eliminated in the quarterfinals with a loss to [[France national basketball team|France]] and Nash left the court in tears. Nash expressed disappointment with the result, saying &quot;It hurts a lot. I feel like I let everybody down. We could have been in the championship game. We were good enough.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Toronto Sun 2000-09-29'&quot;&gt;Daniels, Craig, [http://www.canoe.ca/2000GamesColumnists/daniels_sep29-sun.html &quot;Nash lays the groundwork&quot;], canoe.ca, 29 September 2000, accessed 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he did see a possible silver lining, saying &quot;Hopefully kids [in Canada] will be inspired to playâthat's what I really hope.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;'Toronto Sun 2000-09-29'&quot;/&gt; A victory in its final game of the tournament, a placement game against [[Russia national basketball team|Russia]], enabled Canada to salvage 7th place. Nash's Olympic performance propelled him to stardom in Canada and he finished fifth in voting for the 2000 [[Lionel Conacher Award]], which is handed out to the Canadian male athlete of the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/story/2000/12/28/weir001228.html Weir named Canadian male athlete of the year], cbc.ca, 28 December 2000, accessed 8 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash again led Team Canada during qualifying for the [[2004 Summer Olympics]] at the Americas Olympic Qualifying Tournament in [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. He was named tournament MVP,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidehoops.com/usa-basketball-090103.shtml USA Basketball wins Olympic Qualifying gold], insidehoops.com, 1 September 2003, accessed 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; but Canada finished fourth, missing out on the three Olympic spots available. That was the last time Nash played for Canada. In December 2007, he said, &quot;In my mind right now, I'm not going to play for Canada any more.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Arthur, Bruce, [http://www.nationalpost.com/news/story.html?id=142472 &quot;Nash era at an end for Canada&quot;], nationalpost.com, 4 December 2007, accessed 11 December 2007.{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash is most noted for his playmaking, ball-handling skills and shooting.

The next season, he led the Suns into the Conference Finals, despite the injuries of all three big men (Stoudemire, [[Kurt Thomas (basketball)|Kurt Thomas]] and [[Brian Grant]]); further, Nash was responsible for seven of his teammates attaining career-highs in season scoring.&lt;ref name=&quot;ofs&quot;/&gt; With Nash operating at the point, between the 2005â06 and 2009â10 seasons, the Suns led the league in field goal percentage.

=== Personal life ===

In 2001, Nash met Alejandra Amarilla in [[Manhattan]]. They married in June 2005 and have twin daughters, Lola and Bella, born on October 14, 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; and a son, Matteo Joel, born November 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Coro, Paul, [http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/2010/11/12/20101112phoenix-suns-beat-sacramento-kings-steve-nash.html &quot;Steve Nash leads Phoenix Suns past Sacramento Kings&quot;], azcentral.com, accessed 13 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; On the day of his son's birth, Nash made a statement to ''[[Life &amp; Style (magazine)|Life &amp; Style]]'' in which he announced the birth but called it a &quot;bittersweet moment&quot;, revealing that he and his wife had &quot;lived separately for the past several months&quot; and are &quot;in the process of dissolving&quot; their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/sports/basketball/story/2010/11/13/sp-nash-divorce.html Suns star Steve Nash announces divorce], cbc.ca, accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifeandstylemag.com/2010/11/steve-nash.html Life &amp; Style exclusive: NBA STAR STEVE NASH &amp; WIFE ANNOUNCE NEW BABY BOY...AND MARRIAGE SPLIT], lifeandstylemag.com, accessed 14 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash's younger brother, [[Martin Nash (soccer)|Martin Nash]], played soccer for the [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986â2010)|Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] and made 30 [[cap (sport)|appearances]] for the [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canadian national soccer team]].&lt;ref name=&quot;foundation&quot;/&gt; Their younger sister, Joann, was the captain of the [[University of Victoria#Athletics|University of Victoria]] [[Victoria Vikes|Vikes]] women's soccer team for three years and was named a [[Canada West Universities Athletic Association]] [[All-Star]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kid&quot;&gt;McPeek, Jeramie, [http://www.nba.com/suns/news/fastbreak_nash_cover.html &quot;The Canadian Kid&quot;], nba.com/suns, accessed 24 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulmer, Mike, [http://www.canoe.ca/2000GamesNash/nash_00sep27-sun.html &quot;Nash's roots extend to pub&quot;], canoe.ca, 27 September 2000, accessed 18 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; She is married to [[Manny Malhotra]] of the [[NHL]] [[Vancouver Canucks]].

Nash has a medical condition called [[spondylolisthesis]], which causes muscle tightness and [[back pain]]. Due to the condition, when he is not in the game he [[Supine position|lies on his back]]  rather than sitting on the bench to keep his muscles from stiffening.&lt;ref&gt;McCallum, Jack, [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/preview/siexclusive/2006/pr/subs/siexclusive/01/23/steve.nash0130/index.html?url=http%253A%252F%252Fpremium.si.cnn.com%252Fpr%252Fsubs2%252Fsiexclusive%252F2006%252Fpr%252Fsubs%252Fsiexclusive%252F01%252F23%252Fsteve.nash0130%252Findex.html Point Guard from Another Planet], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, accessed 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charity ===

In 2001, Nash formed the Steve Nash [[Foundation (nonprofit organization)|Foundation]]. Through grants to public service and nonprofit entities, the foundation aims to foster health in kids by funding projects that provide services to children affected by poverty, illness, abuse, or neglect, and create opportunity for education, play, and empowerment. It focuses its resources on communities in [[Phoenix, Arizona]], and [[British Columbia]], Canada. It was given charitable status in 2004.&lt;ref name=&quot;foundation&quot;/&gt; This foundation was awarded the Steve Patterson Award for Excellence in Sports Philanthropy in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/suns/news/nash_081120.html Steve Nash Honored For Off-the-Court Efforts], nba.com, 20 November 2008, accessed 21 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash also founded the Jim Jennings Memorial Endowment Fund, established in honour of a volunteer staff member at Santa Clara University who served the basketball team for more than 20 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;sant&quot;/&gt;

Elsewhere, Nash is the sponsor of the Steve Nash Youth Basketball League in British Columbia that has grown over 10,000 participants.&lt;ref name=&quot;nashbio&quot;/&gt; He has also become involved with [[GuluWalk]], a Canadian-operated charitable organization that raises awareness and funds for the war-affected children of northern [[Uganda]]. In September 2007, Nash and [[Yao Ming]] headlined a group of NBA players who travelled to China and played an exhibition game with the [[China national basketball team|Chinese national basketball team]]. The charity event reportedly raised 2.5 million dollars, earmarked for Chinese children in need.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessradio.com/node/1309 Steve Nash/Yao Ming Gala and Game Raise $2.5M], sportsbusinessradio.com, 14 September 2007, accessed 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In May 2006, Nash was named by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' as one of the 100 most influential people in the world. In the accompanying write-up by [[Charles Barkley]], Nash was lauded for his unselfishness on the basketball court, and being &quot;just a nice guy&quot; who had paid for a new [[pediatric]] [[cardiology]] ward in a [[Paraguay]]an hospital.&lt;ref&gt;Barkley, Charles, [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1187353,00.html &quot;Steve Nash&quot;], time.com, 30 April 2006, accessed 30 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 December 2007, it was announced that Nash would receive Canada's highest civilian honour, the [[Order of Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastvalleytribune.com/story/105451 Suns notebook: Nash receives Order of Canada], eastvalleytribune.com, accessed 30 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and on 3 June 2008, it was announced that Nash would receive a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080603/walk_fame_080603/20080603 Steve Nash, kd lang among new Walk of Fame inductees], ctv.ca, 3 June 2008, accessed 3 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 18 September 2009, he was awarded an Honorary [[Doctor of Laws]] degree by the [[University of Victoria]], in recognition of his athletic achievements and his philanthropic work on behalf of young people through the Steve Nash Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timescolonist.com/entertainment/star+Steve+Nash+gets+honourary+degree+court+performance/2009481/story.html NBA star Steve Nash gets honourary degree for his on and off-court performance], timescolonist.com, 18 September 2009, accessed 18 September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Endorsements ===

Nash is known to be selective about endorsing products, preferring to work with companies he deems socially responsible. After winning his first MVP award, he was approached to be the spokesperson for numerous products, including [[MDG Computers]], [[Raymond Weil]] watches, Vitamin Water, and Clearly Canadian bottled water.&lt;ref&gt;Coro, Paul, [http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0219allstarnb0219.html Nash signs to endorse watches for his charity], azcentral.com, 19 February 2007, accessed 1 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He also has a longstanding relationship with [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]].&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press''.

=== Soccer ===
[[File:Steve Nash Showdown in Chinatown 2010.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Nash contemplated a soccer career before deciding to focus on basketball full-time.]]

Nash grew up playing [[association football|soccer]]âhe stated in a 2005 interview that he could have played professionally if he had focused on it&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.com/features/gq_nash_051202.html GQâs Baller of the Year: Steve Nash], nba.com, 10 December 2005, accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;âand continues to hold an interest in the sport. When [[Dirk Nowitzki]] arrived in the NBA from Germany, he and Nash became close friends, in part because they enjoyed watching soccer together. Nash is friends with several professional soccer players, including [[Alessandro Del Piero]], [[Thierry Henry]], [[Owen Hargreaves]], [[Massimo Ambrosini]] and [[Steve McManaman]].&lt;ref&gt;Yates, Enric, [http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/soccer/20070516-9999-lz1s16nash.html &quot;Double Dribbler&quot;], signonsandiego.com, 16 May 2007, accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During his off-season, when he lives in [[New York City]], he has trained with the [[New York Red Bulls]] of [[Major League Soccer]],&lt;ref&gt;Havsy, Jane, [http://www.usatoday.com/sports/basketball/nba/suns/2006-08-10-nash-red-bulls_x.htm &quot;NBA's Nash gets his kicks with MLS&quot;], usatoday.com, 10 August 2006, accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and once tried to arrange a pick-up game in the city's [[Central Park]] with the Red Bulls and one of his local teams.&lt;ref&gt;Spangler, Adam, [http://www.thisisamericansoccer.com/frontlines/red-bulls-in-central-park/#more &quot;Red Bulls in Central Park&quot;], thisisamericansoccer.com, 7 August 2007, accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nashâwhose father was born in the [[Tottenham]] district of [[London]]âis a lifelong [[Tottenham Hotspur]] supporter, and has expressed interest in owning a minority stake in the club. &quot;I'd like to be an owner. It's something I could do for the rest of my life after my little window of popularity dies,&quot; he said in an interview with ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Adamson, Mike, [http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2201885,00.html &quot;Nash would like to be Tottenham owner&quot;], football.guardian.co.uk, 30 October 2007, accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash added, &quot;I've been a passionate supporter all my life. My parents are from north London and so it's not like I'm some Yank who wants to make a profit out of football. I don't care about making money. I just want to see Spurs succeed and, if I can help, that's great.&quot; However, he said any participation in Spurs would come after his basketball career is over, and he has had only &quot;casual contact&quot; with chairman [[Daniel Levy (businessman)|Daniel Levy]] and former director of football [[Damien Comolli]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2257929,00.html 'I'm not some Yank who wants to make a profit. I just want to see Spurs succeed'] football.guardian.co.uk 19 February 2008, accessed 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash is also a fan of Brazilian team [[Sport Club Corinthians Paulista]], which his former Suns teammate [[Leandro Barbosa]] supports. When Barbosa visited Corinthians in 2007, the club gave him a shirt with Nash's name and jersey number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/ESP/Noticia/0,,MUL55018-4271,00.html|title=Leandrinho visita memorial do TimÃ£o|publisher=[[Rede Globo|Globo Esporte]]|language=Portuguese|date=2007-06-19|accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash had also previously made statements about his intention to bring Major League Soccer to Vancouver as early as 2011, which he has succeeded in doing.&lt;ref&gt;Mallett, Peter, &quot;Nash 'pretty amazing' on a soccer pitch&quot;, ''Globe and Mail'', 24 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; He joined the [[USL-1]] [[Vancouver Whitecaps (1986â2010)|Vancouver Whitecaps FC]] team's ownership group in July 2008 and in March 2009, Vancouver was officially named as a future MLS expansion city, set to join the league in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/archive/feature03180901.aspx MLS awards Vancouver team for 2011], whitecapsfc.com, 18 March 2009, accessed 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitecapsfc.com/archive/feature07250801.aspx 'Caps pursue franchise in MLS], whitecapsfc.com, 25 July 2008, accessed 14 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nash, along with former [[Yahoo!]] president and fellow [[Victoria, British Columbia|Victoria]]-native [[Jeff Mallett]], are investors in [[Women's Professional Soccer]], a soccer league that was launched in March 2009. Nash cited his twin daughters and wanting to have role models for them to look up to as a reason for supporting the league.&lt;ref&gt;''Associated Press''. [http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/soccer/02/04/bc.soc.women.sleague.na.ap/index.html Nash on board for women's league], sportsillustrated.cnn.com, 4 February 2008, accessed 17 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash also co-hosted [[Showdown in Chinatown]] in 2008, an 8-on-8 charity soccer game held at [[Sara D. Roosevelt Park]]. He scored two goals in his team's 8â5 victory. Participants included [[Thierry Henry]], [[Jason Kidd]], [[Baron Davis]], and Suns teammates [[Raja Bell]] and Leandro Barbosa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=3458050 &quot;Nash, soccer star Henry among players in charity soccer match&quot;], sports.espn.go.com, accessed 26 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Nash wrote and produced an 81-second commercial for [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] titled &quot;Training Day&quot;, directed by [[Julian Schnabel]]'s daughter Lola, which gained popularity as a [[viral video]] on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref name=film&gt;Coro, Paul, [http://www.azcentral.com/sports/suns/articles/0320suns0321.html &quot;Nash sees filmmaking in future&quot;], azcentral.com, 20 March 2008, accessed 21 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Nash also started a film production company together with his cousin, filmmaker Ezra Holland, and intends to produce [[independent film]]s.&lt;ref name=film/&gt; The first creative effort to come from Meathawk was a 91-second commercial, titled &quot;The Sixty Million Dollar Man&quot;, for Nike's eco-friendly Trash Talk shoe, the first high-performance shoe to be madeâat the behest of the environmentally conscious Nashâfrom recycled materials. Nash has worn the shoe since February 2008 but Nike produced only 5,000 pairs for sale. The ad which broke virally on [[Earth Day]] 2008, was written by Nash and the directors of the spot, Danny Vaia and Ezra Holland. It is a spoof remake of the [[title sequence]] of the American television series ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]'' and plays on Nashâs numerous on-court collisions.
