==Governor of Tasmania==
During his period as Governor, he was called on to be the adjudicator of a sensitive constitutional problem following the inconclusive Tasmanian state election in 1989.  This led to the fall of the Liberal Government of Premier [[Robin Gray (Australian politician)|Robin Gray]] and its replacement with an [[Australian Labor Party]] Government led by [[Michael Field]], reliant on the support of five Green Members of Parliament in what was known as the [[Labor-Green Accord]].  Bennett's handling of this situation was regarded by constitutional experts as assured and impeccable.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
