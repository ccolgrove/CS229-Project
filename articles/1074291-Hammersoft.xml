'''Dungloe''' ([[Irish language|Irish]]: ''An ClochÃ¡n Liath'')&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioner.ie&quot;&gt;[http://www.commissioner.ie/downloads/An_tOrdu_Logainmneacha_(Ceantair_Ghaeltachta)_2004.pdf Placenames (Ceantair Ghaeltachta) Order 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[Gaeltacht]] [[town]] in [[County Donegal]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]. It is the main town in [[the Rosses]] and the largest in the Donegal Gaeltacht.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDI&quot;&gt;[http://www.logainm.ie/14628.aspx Placenames Database of Ireland]&lt;/ref&gt; Dungloe developed as a town in the middle of the 18th Century, and now serves as the administrative and retail centre for the west of Donegal, and in particular the Rosses, with the only mainland [[secondary school]] for the area.

==Name==
There is a river at the bottom of the town and years ago the only crossing was over a grey granite slab lying in the riverbed, hence the [[Irish language|Irish]] name of the town, ''an ClochÃ¡n Liath'', which means ''the grey stepping-stone''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDI&quot;/&gt; The bridge was built in 1762.

The name ''an ClochÃ¡n Liath'' was formerly anglicised as ''Cloghanlea''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDI&quot;/&gt; The name ''Dungloe'' or ''Dunglow'' is believed to come from the Irish ''DÃºn gCloiche''.&lt;ref name=&quot;PDI&quot;/&gt; This name came into common English usage in the later years of the 18th century when the monthly fair, formerly held at ''DÃºn gCloiche'' (five miles north of the nascent town) was transferred to an ClochÃ¡n Liath. In time the name of the fair and that of the town were subsumed. Today, an ClochÃ¡n Liath is the only officially recognised name of the town.&lt;ref name=&quot;commissioner.ie&quot;/&gt;

==Language==
Despite being within the [[Gaeltacht]] region, there are few native Irish speakers in Dungloe, and English is the everyday language of the locals.&lt;ref name=dun-na-ngall.com&gt;[http://www.dun-na-ngall.com/dungloe.html Dungloe / An ClochÃ¡n Liath] on www.dun-na-ngall.com&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, there are small Irish-speaking pockets outside the town.&lt;ref name=dun-na-ngall.com /&gt;

==Administration==
Dungloe is home to the Dungloe District Court, which covers the south-west area of [[County Donegal]]. There are a number of banks, a [[Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na|Garda]] station, and a [[credit union]] located on the main street. Also, there are pubs, convenience stores, supermarkets, cafes,and restaurants. The town is the current headquarters of [[the Rosses]]' indigenous supermarket chain, [[The Cope]].

==Tourism==
[[Image:Anclochanliath.JPG|right|262px|thumb|Dungloe Main Street.]]
The town attracts many tourists every August when the [[Mary from Dungloe (festival)|Mary From Dungloe International Festival]] takes place. It was founded in the 1960s and it has been frequented by many special guests over the years including [[Daniel O'Donnell (Irish singer)|Daniel OâDonnell]], [[Cliff Richard]], [[Gay Byrne]] and [[Sharon Shannon]]. The picturesque Dungloe Bay and surrounding hills have proved very popular with visitors and have enabled Dungloe to sustain a healthy tourism industry. There is also a festival dedicated to the socialist writer [[Peadar O'Donnell]] in Dungloe each autumn. A little to the north of the town is the site of the ancient church of Templecrone.

==Transport==
The town is serviced by a number of private bus companies, which provide a link to national [[Bus Ãireann]] routes through [[Donegal Town]], and to the north of the county and [[Derry]]. In 1903, the town was linked, through [[Dungloe railway station]], to the [[Londonderry and Lough Swilly Railway]]. However, the station was closed on 3 June 1940 as part of a process that saw the closure of all railways in the county.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Dungloe station | work=Railscot - Irish Railways | url=http://www.railscot.co.uk/Ireland/Irish_railways.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2007-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
