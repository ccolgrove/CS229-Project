==History==
=== Early history ===
{{expand section|date=July 2011}}
[[File:BowlingGreenNormalCollege1915.jpg|thumb|Bowling Green Normal School in 1915]]
The university was one of several institutions established in the [[Progressive Era]] to meet demands for training and professional development of [[teacher]]s when representatives of the [[Ohio]] chose Bowling Green in 1910 as the location for a northwest Ohio normal school.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohc&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=[[Ohio Historical Society]]|title=Ohio History Central|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=657|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;10timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1910/|title=Timeline: 1910's Decade|accessdate=July 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The representatives established the school at a site on the eastern side of the town on {{convert|82.5|acre|km2}} of land that included a town park.&lt;ref name=&quot;10timeline&quot;/&gt; The school opened in 1914 and was originally known as '''Bowling Green State Normal School''' and enrolled 304 students in 1914, primarily from [[Ohio]], [[Michigan]], and [[New York]] who were taught by the original faculty of 21.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohc&quot;/&gt; The school graduated 35 certified teachers in 1915, the same year that the campusâ first two buildings, University Hall and Williams Hall, opened their doors. Two years later the first baccalaureate degrees were awarded. Setting the pace for teacher education in Ohio with four-year degree programs, Bowling Green State Normal School achieved the status of college in 1929 and expanded its curriculum through the addition of the College of Liberal Arts, now known as the ''College of Arts and Sciences''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;a&amp;scollege&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|title=College of Arts and Sciences|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/as/page23385.html|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 28, 1927, the nickname âFalconsâ was originated by the sports editor of the Daily Sentinel-Tribune. He thought the [[Falcon]] was fitting because it was indicative of a powerful bird that was small in stature, its coloring represented the Bowling Green school colors, and like the athlete, the falcon is a bird that goes through a long period of training before battle. At the time the school was still named Bowling Green State Normal College, Common nicknames, used by sports writers throughout the state, were âB.G. Normals,â âTeachers,â and the âB.G. Pedagogues&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bowers|first1=Ann|last2=Swaisgood|first2=Linda K.|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/magazine/fall03/BGSU_History_and_Traditions.pdf|title=The History And Traditions of BGSU|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university was briefly in danger of closure in 1933, as the state legislature explored the idea of converting the school into a mental institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1930/ | title=BGSU::Timeline::1930's Decade | publisher=Bowling Green State University Alumni and Friends | accessdate=2011-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As word spread about the proposed closure and conversion, many students, faculty, and administrators worked together with the Bowling Green community to protest such a move by the state. The Student Protest Committee, coordinating with the faculty and administration, orchestrated a campus rally and subsequent march through the heart of Bowling Green. Members of the Protest Committee then engaged in a letter writing campaign to different community leaders in northwest Ohio, which helped convince the state legislature that the closure of the school would be counterproductive. Later, in 1935, the school was granted university status, which led to the addition of graduate programs and the College of Business Administration. Such additions helped to raise the status of the institution from the college level when it was designated Bowling Green State University.&lt;ref name=&quot;30timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1930/|title=Timeline: 1930s|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], Bowling Green was one of 131 colleges and universities nationally that took part in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] which offered students a path to a Navy commission.&lt;ref name=&quot;histCoEHD&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|work=College of Education and Human Development|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/colleges/edhd/page80935.html|title=Our History|accessdate=September 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; With continued growth in the post-war era, enrollment grew rapidly and by 1950, the university's enrollment reached 4,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;histCoEHD&quot;/&gt; The [[Graduate School]] was formed, and BGSU awarded its first doctoral degree in English in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;30timeline&quot;/&gt;

=== Recent history ===
{{expand section|date=July 2011}}
The 1970s represented a hallmark of progress with the addition of three new colleges. The [[Health|College of Health and Human Services]] opened in 1973 to offer degree programs in a variety of health and community services.&lt;ref name=&quot;setting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/registrar/cat99/front/intro/theu.html|title=History and setting of the University|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1975, the ''School of Music'' was elevated to the [[music|College of Musical Arts]].&lt;ref name=&quot;setting&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/registrar/cat05/University/University12.html|title=History and setting of the University|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The School of Technology was given college status in 1985 and renamed the [[technology|College of Technology]]. The university expanded many of the technology and science facilities during the 1980s, including constructing the Planetarium and Physical Sciences Building.&lt;ref name=&quot;80timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1980/|title=Timeline: 1980s|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985 [[Ronald Reagan]] became the seventh president or president to-be to visit the university after [[Warren G. Harding]], [[Theodore Roosevelt]], [[William Howard Taft]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], and [[Gerald Ford]]. The founding tradition of teacher preparation is now maintained in the university's ''College of Education and Human Development''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ohc&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;histCoEHD&quot;/&gt;

During the 1990s the university renovated and constructed a number of buildings on campus. The BGSU Fine Arts Center received a $9.8 million addition in the early 1990s. Founders Hall was reopened in 1994 after extensive renovations at a cost of $15 million, that same year BGSU opened Olscamp Hall.&lt;ref name=&quot;90timeline&quot;&gt;{{cite web|work=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/alumni/timeline/1990/|title=Timeline: 1990s|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 The university began construction on East Hall, which opened in 1998. All residence halls received wiring for [[Ethernet]] connections.&lt;ref name=&quot;90timeline&quot;/&gt; Following seven past presidents, [[Bill Clinton]] made two campaign stops at the university in 1993 and 1997.&lt;ref name=&quot;90timeline&quot;/&gt;

In 2008, the university began the first phase of a $200 million campus renovation project, as part of the master plan.

Bowling Green's sports teams are called the Falcons. The Falcons participate in [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] (Division I-A for [[american football|football]]) and in the [[Mid-American Conference]] and the [[Central Collegiate Hockey Association]]. BGSU is one of only 13 universities in the country offering NCAA division I-A football, division I men's and women's [[basketball]], and division I [[ice hockey]]. The Falcons have won three conference championships in a row in women's basketball in 2005, 2006, and 2007. In advancing to the [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship]] each of those years, the Falcons lost in the first round in 2005 and 2006, but then won their first two games on their way to the &quot;Sweet Sixteen&quot; in 2007. The women's soccer team won the conference crown in 2005.

The Falcons' main rivals are the Rockets of the [[University of Toledo]]. Separated by just {{convert|20|mi|km}} on [[Interstate 75]], the two schools celebrate a heated rivalry in several sports. The most well-known of these games is the [[Battle of I-75]], a football game held each year in which the winner takes home the [[Peace Pipe (college football)|Peace Pipe]], an American Indian peace pipe placed upon a wood tablet. The 1984 Falcons hockey team defeated the [[University of Minnesota-Duluth]], in the longest college hockey championship game in history, to win the NCAA National Championship. Former BGSU head football coach Doyt L. Perry lead the Falcons to a NCAA Football National Title in the year of 1959. Former BGSU head football coach [[Urban Meyer]] went on to great success at the [[University of Florida]], earning two [[BCS National Championship Game]] appearances in a three year span, winning in both [[2007 BCS National Championship Game|2007]] and [[2009 BCS National Championship Game|2009]].  Former BGSU head hockey coach Jerry York went on to become the winningest active coach in NCAA hockey and win three NCAA National Championships at [[Boston College]] in [[2001 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament|2001]], [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament|2008]], and [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament|2010]] after his first at Bowling Green in [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Ice Hockey Tournament|1984]].

In 2008, Bowling Green State University released plans for the new [[Stroh Center]], which is intended to be the new home for BGSU basketball and volleyball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://media.www.bgnews.com/media/storage/paper883/news/2008/12/05/Campus/University.Reveals.Plans.For.New.Stroh.Center-3571970.shtml | title=University reveals plans for new Stroh Center | publisher=BGNews | accessdate=2008-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media and publications==
The student operated, independent daily newspaper [[The BG News]], which has been published since 1920. The BG News's web portal BG Views was launched in 2009. The university's independent, student operated yearbook was first published in 1918 as the Bee Gee. Publication stopped after 1918 for 6 years and in 1924 the yearbook resumed production under a new name, The KEY and was published every year since 1924 as the only comprehensive record of students, activities, and events for a given year. In 2008, the yearbook was replaced with a magazine, The Key Magazine. This is the only magazine sponsored by BGSU and fully run by BGSU students and supported by local advertising only. The campus is home to two student-operated radio stations as part of the Department of Telecommunications. [[WBGU-FM|WBGU 88.1 FM]] serves as an [[independent radio]], [[non-commercial educational]] (NCE), FCC-licensed [[college radio]] station, while [[WFAL Falcon Radio]], formerly WFAL 1610 AM, is a student-run [[commercial radio]] station. Bowling Green Radio News Organization (BGRNO)-BGRNO provides up-to-the minute radio news coverage Monday-Friday on WBGU-FM AND WFAL-AM. Students write, produce, and report live on the air the latest local and national news, sports and weather stories. Bowling Green Radio Sports Organization (BGRSO)-BGRSO broadcasts BGSU's football, hockey, men's and women's basketball, and baseball games on WBGU-FM and WFAL-AM. WBGU-FM is also the flagship station for women's basketball and hockey. BGSU is also home to BG24 News, a student-run [[television news]]cast airing live at 5:30pm three days a week.

''[[Mid-American Review]]'' (MAR), published through the BGSU Department of English since 1980, is nationally recognized for publishing contemporary fiction, poetry, nonfiction, and translations. Preceding MAR was Itinerary, a magazine that was established by editor Robert Early in 1972 to publish the works of BGSU's MFA students. However, the students tired of publishing nothing but their own work and suggested broadening into an international publication. Itinerary was retired in 1980 when the first issue of MAR was released. No BGSU student work is included in MAR (with the exception of occasional reviews of newly released literary titles). ''Prairie Margins'' is a national undergraduate literary journal published by students in the Creative Writing Program at BGSU. The annual journal features literary work by both BGSU students and undergraduate creative writers from other institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/studentlife/organizations/prairiemargins/prairiemargins.html|title=Prairie Margins|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Projector'' is a peer-reviewed electronic journal on film, media and culture published twice a year by the Department of Theatre &amp; Film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|publisher=Bowling Green State University|url=http://www.bgsu.edu/departments/theatrefilm/projector/page30082.html|title=About The Projector|accessdate=September 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
