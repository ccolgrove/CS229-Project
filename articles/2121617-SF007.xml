'''SchilliX''' is a [[Live CD]] [[operating system]] distribution based on [[OpenSolaris]]&lt;ref&gt;jimgris/admin/&quot;unknown&quot;, [http://hub.opensolaris.org/bin/view/Main/downloads, &quot;Other Distros&quot;], &quot;Oracle Corporation and/or its affiliates&quot;, 2010/03/26 02:53. Retrieved 2010/13/08 16:32.&lt;/ref&gt;.  It was released on 17 June 2005, three days after the first release of OpenSolaris.  Its developers claim that it is the first OpenSolaris distribution.  The initial developers were [[JÃ¶rg Schilling]], Fabian Otto, Thomas Blaesing, and Tobias Kirschstein.

The release version is 0.7.1i &lt;small&gt;(September 6, 2010)&lt;/small&gt;, which uses the [[Illumos]]&lt;ref&gt;Anil Gulecha, [http://www.illumos.org/projects/site/wiki/FAQ, &quot;FAQ&quot;], &quot;Illumos.org&quot;, 08/03/2010 10:13A.M. Retrieved 08/13/2010 16:21P.M.&lt;/ref&gt; project for the build (once again being a first to make a release from a new open sourced build).

The current release is 0.7.2 which is the first OpenSolaris based redistributable distro that allows to compile the OpenSolaris source base (onnv / Illumos). The SchilliX project created a OSS replacement for the K&amp;R [[C preprocessor|cpp]] needed by [[rpcgen]], [[dtrace]] and the assembler.

Future releases will be based upon the Schillix-ON&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.berlios.de/projects/schillix-on/&lt;/ref&gt; project.
