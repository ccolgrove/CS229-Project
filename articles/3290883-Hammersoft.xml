'''Garrett Lucash''' (born September 21, 1978 in [[Attleboro, MA]]) is an American [[pair skater]]. With partner [[Katie Orscher]], he is the 2005 [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. National Champion]].

==Biography==
Lucash was brought together with Orscher because he was searching for a new partner, and he remembered Katie, so he gave her a call. They are both clockwise skaters and only a small portion of skaters skate in that direction. They skate at the [[ISCC]] in [[Simsbury, CT]].

In 2005, they won the gold medal at the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]]. The 2005-2006 season was a difficult one for them as Katie broke her foot over the summer and they missed a great deal of training time going into their most important season ever. In January 2006 at the US National Championships in St. Louis, MO they led the pack in Pairs after the short program. After the long program, they dropped to third and missed out on making the US Olympic team by .66 points.

Garrett is a die-hard [[Boston Red Sox]] fan. On August 1, 2007, Garrett was featured on the first episode of the Red Sox themed [[dating game show|dating show]] [[Sox Appeal]], in which he went on three blind dates at [[Fenway Park]] during a Red Sox game against the [[San Francisco Giants]].

Orscher and Lucash retired from competitive skating in 2006.  Garrett now is the co-creator and director of the National Figure Skating Academy in Boston, along with [[Dmitry Palamarchuk]].
