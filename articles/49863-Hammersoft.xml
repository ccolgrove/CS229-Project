'''Laputa''' is a [[Fictional country|fictional place]] from the book ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'' by [[Jonathan Swift]].

Laputa is a fictional [[flying island]] or rock, about 4.5 miles in diameter, with an [[adamant]]ine base, which its inhabitants can maneuver in any direction using [[magnetic levitation]]. Its population consists mainly of educated people, who are fond of [[mathematics]], [[astronomy]], [[music]] and [[technology]], but fail to make practical use of their knowledge (the rest are their servants). 

They had mastered magnetic levitation and discovered the two [[moons of Mars]] (which in reality would not be discovered for another 150 years). However, they were unable to construct well-designed clothing or buildings, because they took measurements with instruments such as [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]]s and a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] rather than with tape measures. 

It is a male-dominated society. Wives often request to leave the island to visit the land below; however, these requests are almost never granted because the women never want to return voluntarily.

The land beneath the floating island, within the region it can travel, is known as Balnibarbi and is controlled by the king of Laputa, with the ground capital being the city of [[Lagado]]. 

The tyrannical king controls the mainland mostly by threatening to cover rebel regions with the island's shadow, thus blocking sunlight and rain, or by throwing rocks at rebellious surface cities (which seems the first time that [[strategic bombing|aerial bombardment]] was conceived of as a method of warfare). In extreme cases, the island is lowered on the cities below in order to crush them, although this has not been successful every time, notably in the case of [[Lindalino]]. 

The rebellion of Lindalino against Laputa is an allegory of Ireland's revolt against England, and England's (meaning: the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] government's) violent foreign and internal politics (see [[Jonathan Swift]] for his political career).
The absurd inventions of the Laputans mock the [[Royal Society]].
