'''Nickelodeon's 24th Annual [[Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards|Kids' Choice Awards]]''' were held on April 2, 2011 at 8 p.m. ET&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nick.com/kids-choice-awards/news/jack-black-host-2011-kids-choice-awards.html 2011 Kids' Choice Awards Host Announced!!!], Nick.com, February 10, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Galen Center]] at the [[University of Southern California]] in [[Los Angeles]]'s [[University Park, Los Angeles|University Park]] neighborhood due to renovations disallowing use of traditional venue [[Pauley Pavilion]] until at least 2013. [[Jack Black]] returned as host for the third time since 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Annie Yuan, [http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/jack-black-host-kids-choice-98913 Jack Black to Host Kids' Choice Awards for Third Time], ''Hollywood Reporter'', February 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 telecast was the first Kids' Choice Awards to take place in the month of April since 2006, as the previous four Kids' Choice telecasts from 2007 to 2010 were held on the last Saturday in March. Nominees were announced on February 10, 2011 for twenty categories. During the show, the Big Green Help Award was presented to [[Justin Timberlake]], an honor given each year. More than 200 million record-breaking votes were casted for this year's 20-category awards.

Musical performances during the awards telecast included [[Big Time Rush (band)|Big Time Rush]], who performed their single &quot;[[Boyfriend (Big Time Rush song)|Boyfriend]]&quot; from their debut album ''[[B.T.R. (album)|B.T.R.]]'' with a surprise appearance by Snoop Dogg, who was slimed at the end of the song.  (This marked the second time a Nickelodeon act performed during the actual Kids' Choice telecast after [[The Naked Brothers Band (TV series)|The Naked Brothers Band]] in [[2008 Kids' Choice Awards|2008]]); [[The Black Eyed Peas]] and [[Willow Smith]] also performed during the awards telecast, and each sang a medley of some of their 2 latest hit singles.&lt;ref name=&quot;Willow&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20476559,00.html|title=Willow Smith to Perform at Kids' Choice Awards|last=Byrne|first=Alla|publisher=[[People (magazine)|''People'']]|date=March 28, 2011|accessdate=March 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the third year in a row, the award show was preceded by a ''Countdown to Kidsâ Choice!'' pre-show telecast, which aired live from 7 to 8 p.m. ET as wraparound segments during regularly scheduled programming; the preshow was hosted by ''[[BrainSurge]]'' host [[Jeff Sutphen]], ''[[Victorious]]'' cast member [[Daniella Monet]], ''[[iCarly]]'' cast member [[Noah Munck]] and recording artist Aaron Fresh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Train&quot;&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Train-Kids-Choice-1031188.aspx Exclusive: Train to Perform at Nickelodeon's Kids' Choice Awards], ''[[TV Guide]]'', March 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Train (band)|Train]] performed their 2010 hit single &quot;[[Hey, Soul Sister]]&quot; during the pre-show;&lt;ref name=&quot;Train&quot;/&gt; [[Victoria Justice]], who was also a presenter during the awards telecast, performed the single &quot;Beggin' on Your Knees&quot; from the upcoming soundtrack to her Nickelodeon series ''Victorious'' during the pre-show. The song was also featured during a new episode of ''Victorious'', also titled &quot;Begginâ on Your Kneesâ, which aired immediately following the awards at 9:35 p.m. ET/PT.

Like the previous year, Nickelodeon's sister channels [[TeenNick]] and [[Nicktoons (TV channel)|Nicktoons]] suspended regular programming during the 95-minute duration of the award show, allowing viewers to see the awards. A portion of [[Figueroa Street]] and [[Jefferson Boulevard]] fronting Galen Center was blocked off for the &quot;orange carpet&quot;, a stage and the [[grandstand]] for fans to watch the broadcasting of the pre-show. On April 1, Nickelodeon reported the slime was stolen as part of the [[April Fool's Day]] joke.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nick.com/kids-choice-awards/news/ THE KCA SLIME IS MISSING!!!], Kids' Choice Awards 2011 News, April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As with previous years, voting took place online via the [http://www.nick.com/kca11 program's official webpage] and [http://m.nick.com/kca11 mobile site] beginning on March 7, along with an [[iPhone]]/[[iPad]] application made specifically for the awards as introduced in the previous year.
