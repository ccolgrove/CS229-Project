{{nihongo|'''Osaka University'''|å¤§éªå¤§å­¦|Åsaka daigaku}}, or {{nihongo|Handai|éªå¤§|Handai}}, is a major national university located in [[Osaka]], Japan. It is the sixth oldest university in Japan as the '''Osaka Prefectural Medical College''', and formerly one of the [[Imperial university|Imperial Universities]] of Japan. Numerous prominent scientists worked at the Osaka University such as the Nobel Laureate in Physics [[Hideki Yukawa]].

==History==
{{Portal|Osaka University}}
Academic traditions of the university reach back to {{nihongo|'''''[[KaitokudÅ]]'''''|æå¾³å }}, an [[Edo period|Edo-period]] school for local citizens founded in 1724, and {{nihongo|'''''[[Tekijuku]]'''''|é©å¡¾|}}, a school of ''[[Rangaku]]'' for [[samurai]] founded by [[Ogata KÅan]] in 1838. The spirit of the university's humanity sciences is believed to be intimately rooted in ''Kaitokudo'', whereas that of the natural and applied sciences, including medicine, is widely believed to be based on ''Tekijuku''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = History of the University | publisher = Osaka University | url = http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/guide/about/history.html | accessdate = 2008-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osaka University traces its origin back to 1869 when '''Osaka Prefectural Medical School''' was founded in downtown [[Osaka, Osaka|Osaka]]. The school was later transformed into the '''Osaka Prefectural Medical College''' with university status by the University Ordinance (Imperial Ordinance No. 388 of 1918) in 1919. The college merged with the newly-founded College of Science to form '''Osaka Imperial University'''ï¼å¤§éªå¸åå¤§å­¦ï¼ in 1931. Osaka Imperial University was inaugurated as the sixth [[imperial universities|imperial university]] in Japan. As part of the University, '''Osaka Technical College''' was later included to form the school of Engineering two years later. The university was eventually renamed '''Osaka University''' in 1947.

Merging with [[Naniwa High School]] and Osaka High School as a result of the government's education system reform in 1949, Osaka University started its postwar era with five faculties: Science, Medicine, Engineering, Letters, and Law. After that, faculties, graduate schools, and research institutes have been successively established. Among these are the School of Engineering Science, the first of its kind among Japanese national universities, which draws upon the excellence of both sciences and engineering disciplines, and the School of Human Sciences, which covers its cross-disciplinary research interest as broadly as psychology, sociology, and education. Built on the then-existing faculties, 10 graduate schools were set up as part of the government's education system reform program in 1953. Two graduate schools, the Graduate School of Language and Culture and the cross-disciplinary and cross-institutional Osaka School of International Public Policy, add to the list, making the number of graduate schools reach 12 in 1994. 

[[Image:Osaka University Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|Osaka University Hospital]]
In 1993, [[Osaka University Hospital]] was relocated from the Nakanoshima campus in downtown Osaka to the Suita campus, completing the implementation of the university's plan to integrate the scattered facilities into the Suita and Toyonaka campuses. In October 2007, a merger between Osaka University and [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] was completed. The merger made Osaka University one of two national universities in the country with a School of Foreign Studies (with [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]]). In addition, the merger made the university the largest national university in the country. 

In 2009, Osaka University implemented a major revision of its website. The result is a site much more accessible and informative to persons not versed in the Japanese language â a site much more user-friendly to international exchange students, international researchers, and expatriates living in the Osaka area. Currently, thanks to the work of the &quot;Web Design Unit,&quot; virtually all Osaka University's web pages come in pairs â a Japanese page and the same page in English. These pairings include frequent updates on symposiums, seminars, and other events open to staff, students and, often, the general public.

==Campuses==
[[File:Osaka-univ_Toyonaka_frontgate.jpg|thumb|Toyonaka campus main entrance]]
Suita, Toyonaka and Minoh are the university's three campuses. Home to the university's headquarters, the Suita campus extends across [[Suita, Osaka|Suita city]] and [[Ibaraki, Osaka|Ibaraki city]] in Osaka prefecture. The Suita campus houses faculties of Human Sciences, Medicine, Dentistry, Pharmaceutical Sciences, and Engineering. It contains the Graduate School of Frontier Biosciences and a portion of the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. The campus is also home to the Osaka University Hospital and the Nationwide Joint Institute of Cybermedia Center and Research Center for Nuclear Physics. Because access to the campus by public transportation is relatively inconvenient, automobiles, motorcycles, and bicycles are commonly seen within the campus. While sports activities are primarily concentrated on the Toyonaka campus, tennis activities are concentrated on the Suita campus because of its many tennis facilities.

The Toyonaka campus is home to faculties of Letters, Law, Economics, Science, and Engineering Science. It is also the academic base for Graduate Schools of International Public Policy, Language and Culture, (a portion of) Information Science, and the Center for the Practice of Legal and Political Expertise. All freshmen attend classes on the Toyonaka campus during their first year of enrollment. 

The Minoh campus was incorporated following the merger with [[Osaka University of Foreign Studies]] in October 2007. The Minoh campus is home to School of Foreign Studies, Research Institute for World Languages, and Center for Japanese Language and Culture.

In addition to these three campus, the former Nakanoshima campus, the university's earliest campus located in downtown Osaka, served as the hub for the faculty of medicine until the transfer to the Suita campus was completed in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/guide/about/history.html History of Osaka University â Osaka University]. Osaka-u.ac.jp. Retrieved on 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from April 2004, the Nakanoshima campus has been transformed into the &quot;Nakanoshima Center&quot;, serving as a venue for information exchange, adult education classes, and activities involving academic as well as non-academic communities.

==Organization==
Osaka University has 11 faculties (å­¦é¨) for undergraduate programs and 15 graduate schools (å¤§å­¦é¢).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/academics/ Undergraduate and Graduate schools &amp; facilities â Osaka University]. Osaka-u.ac.jp. Retrieved on 2011-06-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic alliances==
Osaka University has completed academic exchange agreements with a large number of universities (in 2010, 78) throughout the world and also exchange agreements between schools at Osaka University and schools and institutes in other countries (in 2010, 323). These agreements facilitate international students studying at Osaka University and Osaka University students studying at overseas universities, schools, and institutes. In many cases, students are able to participate in these exchange agreements without paying any additional tuition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osaka-u.ac.jp/en/guide/international/exchange/ University Exchange Agreements â Osaka University].
