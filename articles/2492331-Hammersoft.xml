==History==
In 2004, Barrington Broadcasting launched [[The WB|WB]] affiliate WBSF which was offered exclusively on cable. The station was the [[Detroit Pistons]]' Mid-Michigan home from its inception until 2006. After that, fellow WB affiliate [[WMYD]] and NBC affiliate [[WDIV-TV]] in [[Detroit]] became the flagship stations. Until WBSF was formed, Mid-Michigan viewers watched Pistons games through another Detroit station, [[UPN]] affiliate [[WKBD]]. Prior to WBSF's opening in 2004, WB programming was seen on WEYI in the early-2000s mainly in the overnight periods. Before WEYI's involvement began, Mid-Michigan had no WB service other than from [[Chicago]]'s [[WGN America]] on cable when this aired WB programming nationwide until 1999. Like WMYD, WBSF was the last television station in its [[media market|market]] to air cartoons on weekday afternoons. Since December 30, 2005 what was then [[Kids' WB]] has been shown only on Saturday mornings replaced by the [[The CW Daytime|Daytime WB]] block on weekdays.

At some point in 2006, it was added to WEYI's new second digital subchannel. With the merger of The WB and UPN to become The CW, WBSF became the area's network affiliate in the fall of 2006. Because of this, a chance existed that WKBD (which along with [[WBKP]] are the only other over-the-air CW affiliates in [[Michigan]]) would be dropped from this market's cable systems as both WBSF and WKBD would be CW affiliates. However, in the case of [[Midland, Michigan|Midland]], two [[CBS]] affiliates do coexist on the same cable system. This occurred on [[Charter Communications|Charter]]'s [[Tri-Cities (Michigan)|Tri-Cities]] systems which replaced WKBD with [[MyNetworkTV]] affiliatwe [[WNEM-DT2]] that became the new home of Pistons basketball that year. As a result of the network change, WBSF rebranded from &quot;Mid-Michigan's WB&quot; to &quot;CW 46 Mid-Michigan&quot;. However, its call letters were not changed as the &quot;B&quot; in the calls also stands for Bay City which is the station's city of license. &quot;S&quot; and &quot;F&quot; stand for Saginaw and Flint, respectively. WBSF signed-on its analog channel on September 13, 2006 although it continues to be seen on WEYI-DT2.  

WBSF has served as an alternate NBC affiliate. The station aired a ''[[WWE Saturday Night Main Event]]'' on [[broadcast delay|tape delay]] in 2005 due to WEYI's Pistons coverage. In 2006, the channel aired an episode of ''[[Friday Night Lights (TV series)|Friday Night Lights]]'' (also on tape delay) due to WEYI's broadcast of the second Michigan gubernatorial debate. The station may air any preempted NBC program should the preemption occur on WEYI for a local special, breaking news story, or any other emergency.

WBSF once aired a weeknight newscast known as ''The 7 O'Clock News on CW 46'' which was produced by WEYI. This production was canceled in April 2008.

Because it was granted an original [[construction permit]] after the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) finalized the [[digital television]] allotment plan on April 21, 1997, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transmitter.com/FCC97115/chanplan.html FCC re-alocation plan]&lt;/ref&gt; WBSF did not receive a companion channel for a digital television station. Instead, after the [[DTV transition in the United States|DTV transition]] on June 12, 2009, it was required to turn off its [[analog signal]] and turn on its [[digital signal]] (an action called a &quot;[[flash-cut]]&quot;). &lt;ref&gt;[http://hraunfoss.fcc.gov/edocs_public/attachmatch/DA-09-221A5.pdf FCC.gov - Appendix B: All Full Power Television Stations by DMA, Indicating Those Terminating Analog Service on or before February 17, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;
