'''Georgia Blanche Douglas Camp Johnson''' better known as '''Georgia Douglas Johnson'''   (September 10, 1880 â May 14, 1966) was an [[United States|American]] [[poet]] and a member of the [[Harlem Renaissance]].

==Early life and education==

Much of Johnson's childhood was spent in [[Rome, Georgia]].  She received her education in both Rome and Atlanta, where she excelled in reading, recitations and physical education. She also taught herself to play the [[violin]], which developed into a lifelong love of music.

Johnson graduated from [[Atlanta University]]'s Normal School in 1896.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt; She taught school in [[Marietta, Georgia]] for a time, then returned to Atlanta to work as an assistant principal.  Johnson then traveled to [[Cleveland, Ohio]], to study [[piano]], [[harmony]], and voice.  From 1902 to 1903, she attended the [[Oberlin Conservatory of Music]].&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
On September 28, 1903, Johnson married Henry Lincoln Johnson, an Atlanta lawyer and prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party member. They had two sons, Henry Lincoln Johnson, Jr. and Peter Douglas Johnson (d. 1957).

==Career==

Johnson's husband accepted an appointment as the [[Recorder of Deeds]] from [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[William Howard Taft]], and the family moved to [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt; It was during this period that Johnson began to write poems and stories.  Johnson credits a poem written by [[William Stanley Braithwaite]] about a rose tended by a child, as her inspiration for her poems.

She began to submit her poems to newspapers and small magazines.  She published her first poem in 1916 when she was thirty-six.  She published four volumes of poetry, beginning in 1918 with ''The Heart of a Woman''. Johnson also wrote songs, taught music, and performed as an organist at her [[Congregational Church|Congregational church]].

There Johnson lived for the last fifty years of her life.  Johnson's husband died in 1925.  She struggled at first with some temporary jobs.  As a gesture of appreciation for her husband's loyalty and service to the Republican party, President [[Calvin Coolidge]] appointed Johnson as the [[Commissioner of Conciliation]] in the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]].

Soon after her husband's death, Johnson began to host what became forty years of weekly &quot;Saturday Salons&quot;, for friends and authors, including [[Langston Hughes]], [[Jean Toomer]], [[Anne Spencer]], [[Richard Bruce Nugent]], [[Alain LeRoy Locke|Alain Locke]], [[Jessie Redmon Fauset]], [[Angelina Weld Grimke]] and [[Eulalie Spence]]â all major contributors to the New Negro Movement, which is better known today as the [[Harlem Renaissance]].&lt;ref name=&quot;georgiaencyclopedia.com&quot;/&gt;  She was especially close to the writer Angelina Grimke.  Johnson called her home the &quot;Half Way House&quot; for friends traveling, and a place where they &quot;could freely discuss politics and personal opinions.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;umn.edu&quot;/&gt;

She died in Washington, D.C., in 1966.

In September 2009, it was announced that Johnson would be inducted into the Georgia Writers Hall of Fame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |title=Writers hall picks four inductees |url=http://www.onlineathens.com/stories/091909/uga_494743547.shtml |newspaper=Online Athens |publisher=''Athens Banner Herald'' |date=September 19, 2009 |accessdate=20 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
