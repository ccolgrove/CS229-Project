'''Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|h|Éª|l|Ér|i|_|d|aÉª|Ë|Ã¦|n|_|Ë|r|É|d|Ém|_|Ë|k|l|Éª|n|t|Én}}; born October 26, 1947) is the [[List of Secretaries of State of the United States|67th]] [[United States Secretary of State]], serving in the administration of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]. She was a [[United States Senator]] for [[New York]] from 2001 to 2009. As the wife of the [[List of Presidents of the United States|42nd]] [[President of the United States]], [[Bill Clinton]], she was the [[First Lady of the United States]] from 1993 to 2001. In the [[2008 United States presidential election|2008 election]], Clinton was a leading [[Hillary Rodham Clinton presidential campaign, 2008|candidate]] for the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|presidential nomination]].

A native of [[Illinois]], Hillary Rodham first attracted national attention in 1969 for her remarks as the first student [[Commencement speech|commencement speaker]] at [[Wellesley College]].  She embarked on a career in law after graduating from [[Yale Law School]] in 1973.  Following a stint as a [[United States Congress|Congressional]] legal counsel, she moved to [[Arkansas]] in 1974 and married [[Bill Clinton]] in 1975.  Rodham cofounded the [[Arkansas Advocates for Children and Families]] in 1977 and became the first female chair of the [[Legal Services Corporation]] in 1978. Named the first female partner at [[Rose Law Firm]] in 1979, she was twice listed as one of the 100 most influential lawyers in America. First Lady of Arkansas from 1979 to 1981 and 1983 to 1992 with husband Bill as Governor, she successfully led a task force to reform Arkansas's education system. She sat on the [[board of directors]] of [[Wal-Mart]] and several other corporations.

In 1994 as First Lady of the United States, her major initiative, the [[Clinton health care plan]], failed to gain approval from the U.S. Congress. However, in 1997 and 1999, Clinton played a role in advocating the creation of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]], the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]], and the [[Foster Care Independence Act]].  Her years as First Lady drew a [[Polarization (politics)|polarized]] response from the American public.  The only First Lady to have been [[subpoena]]ed, she testified before a federal [[grand jury]] in 1996 due to the [[Whitewater controversy]], but was never charged with wrongdoing in this or several other investigations during [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|her husband's administration]]. The state of her marriage was the subject of considerable speculation following the [[Lewinsky scandal]] in 1998.

After moving to the state of New York, Clinton was elected as a [[List of United States Senators from New York|U.S. Senator]] in 2000. [[United States Senate election in New York, 2000|That election]] marked the first time an American First Lady had run for public office; Clinton was also the first female senator to represent the state. In the Senate, she initially supported the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] on some foreign policy issues, including a vote for the [[Iraq War Resolution]]. She subsequently opposed the administration on its conduct of the [[war in Iraq]] and on most domestic issues. Senator Clinton was [[United States Senate election in New York, 2006|reelected by a wide margin in 2006]]. In the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 presidential nomination race]], Hillary Clinton won more primaries and delegates than any other female candidate in American history, but narrowly lost to Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]]. 

&lt;!-- Per WP:IAR, adding a fifth paragraph --&gt;As Secretary of State, Clinton became the first former First Lady to serve in a [[United States Cabinet|president's cabinet]]. She has put into place institutional changes seeking to maximize departmental effectiveness and promote the empowerment of women worldwide, and has set records for most-traveled secretary for time in office. She has been at the forefront of the U.S. response to the [[Arab Spring]], including advocating for the [[2011 military intervention in Libya|military intervention in Libya]].

== Early life and education ==
=== Early life ===
Hillary Diane Rodham&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex01&quot;&gt;In 1995, Hillary Clinton said her mother had named her after Sir [[Edmund Hillary]], who, with [[Sherpa Tenzing]], was the first mountaineer to scale [[Mount Everest]], and that was the reason for the unusual &quot;two L's&quot; spelling of her name. However, the Everest climb did not take place until 1953, more than five years after she was born. In October 2006, a Clinton spokeswoman said she was not named after the mountain climber. Instead, this account of her name's origin &quot;was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add.&quot; See {{Cite news |title=Hillary, Not as in the Mount Everest Guy |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/17/nyregion/17hillary.html |author=Hakim, Danny |work=The New York Times|date=October 17, 2006 |accessdate=April 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born at Edgewater Hospital in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehouse.gov&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.edgewaterhistory.org/articles/index.html?v14-3-4.html |title=Edgewater Hospital 1929â2001 |author=O'Laughlin, Dania |work=Edgewater Historical Society |date=Summer 2003 |accessdate=June 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was raised in a [[United Methodist]] family, first in Chicago and then, from the age of three, in suburban [[Park Ridge, Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=18, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her father, [[Hugh Ellsworth Rodham]] (1911â1993), was the son of [[Welsh people|Welsh]] and [[English people|English]] immigrants;&lt;ref name=&quot;nehgs&quot;&gt;{{cite web |author=Roberts, Gary Boyd |url=http://www.newenglandancestors.org/research/services/articles_ancestry_hillary_clinton.asp |title=Notes on the Ancestry of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton |publisher=[[New England Historic Genealogical Society]] |accessdate=May 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; he managed a successful small business in the textile industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=17â18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother, [[Dorothy Howell Rodham|Dorothy Emma Howell]] (1919â2011), was a homemaker of English, [[Scottish people|Scottish]], [[French people|French]], [[French Canadian]], and Welsh descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;nehgs&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;brock-4&quot;/&gt; Hillary grew up with two younger brothers, [[Hugh Rodham|Hugh]] and [[Tony Rodham|Tony]].

As a child, Hillary Rodham was a teacher's favorite at her public schools in Park Ridge.&lt;ref name=morris-113/&gt;&lt;ref name=bern-29&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; She participated in swimming, baseball, and other sports.&lt;ref name=morris-113&gt;Morris 1996, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bern-29/&gt; She also earned numerous awards as a [[Brownie (Girl Guides)|Brownie]] and [[Girl Scouts of the USA|Girl Scout]].&lt;ref name=bern-29/&gt; She attended [[Maine East High School]], where she participated in [[student council]], the school newspaper, and was selected for [[National Honor Society]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehouse.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton |url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/history/firstladies/hc42.html |publisher=[[The White House]] |accessdate=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bern-30&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=30â31}}&lt;/ref&gt; For her senior year, she was redistricted to [[Maine South High School]], where she was a [[National Merit Finalist]] and graduated in the top five percent of her class of 1965.&lt;ref name=&quot;bern-30&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Maraniss 1995, p. 255. She was also voted &quot;most likely to succeed&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;  Her mother wanted her to have an independent, professional career,&lt;ref name=&quot;brock-4&quot;/&gt; and her father, otherwise a traditionalist, was of the opinion that his daughter's abilities and opportunities should not be limited by gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Raised in a politically [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] household,&lt;ref name=&quot;brock-4&quot;&gt;Brock 1996, p. 4.  Her father was an outspoken Republican, while her mother kept quiet but was &quot;basically a Democrat.&quot;  See also {{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; at age thirteen Rodham helped canvass [[South side (Chicago)|South Side Chicago]] following the very close [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960 U.S. presidential election]], where she found evidence of [[electoral fraud]] against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; She then volunteered to campaign for Republican candidate [[Barry Goldwater]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1964|U.S. presidential election of 1964]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Middendorf, J. William |title=Glorious Disaster: Barry Goldwater's Presidential Campaign And the Origins of the Conservative Movement |publisher=[[Basic Books]] |year=2006 |isbn=0-465-04573-1 |authorlink=J. William Middendorf }} p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt;  Rodham's early political development was shaped most by her high school history teacher (like her father, a fervent [[anticommunist]]), who introduced her to Goldwater's classic ''[[The Conscience of a Conservative]]'',&lt;ref name=&quot;troy&quot;&gt;Troy 2006, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and by her [[Methodism|Methodist]] youth minister (like her mother, concerned with issues of [[social justice]]), with whom she saw and met [[civil rights]] leader [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], in Chicago in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 18â21. The teacher, Paul Carlson, and the minister, Donald Jones, came into conflict in Park Ridge; Clinton would later see that &quot;as an early indication of the cultural, political and religious fault lines that developed across America in the [next] forty years&quot; (Clinton 2003, p. 23).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== College ===
In 1965, Rodham enrolled at [[Wellesley College]], where she majored in [[political science]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Commencement/1992/speecheshrc.html |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton Remarks to Wellesley College Class of 1992 |author=Clinton, Hillary Rodham  |publisher=[[Wellesley College]] |date=May 29, 1992 |accessdate=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her freshman year, she served as president of the Wellesley [[Young Republicans]];&lt;ref name=&quot;living31&quot;&gt;Clinton 2003, p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/Activities/homepage/gop/history.html |title=Wellesley College Republicans: History and Purpose |publisher=Wellesley College |date=May 16, 2007 |accessdate=June 2, 2007 }} Gives organization's prior name.&lt;/ref&gt; with this [[Rockefeller Republican]]-oriented group,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author=Milton, Joyce |title=The First Partner: Hillary Rodham Clinton |publisher=[[William Morrow and Company]] |year=1999 |isbn=0-688-15501-4}} pp. 27â28&lt;/ref&gt; she supported the elections of [[John Lindsay]] and [[Edward Brooke]].&lt;ref&gt;Brock 1996, pp. 12â13.&lt;/ref&gt;  She later stepped down from this position, as her views changed regarding the [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1955-1968)|American Civil Rights Movement]] and the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name=&quot;living31&quot;/&gt; In a letter to her youth minister at this time, she described herself as &quot;a mind conservative and a heart liberal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=50.}} Bernstein states she believed this combination was possible and that no equation better describes the adult Hillary Clinton.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to the 1960s current that advocated radical actions against the political system, she sought to work for change within it.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg011293&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8210491.html |title=Hillary: The Wellesley Years: The woman who will live in the White House was a sharp-witted activist in the class of '69 |author=Kenney, Charles |work=The Boston Globe |date=January 12, 1993 |accessdate=February 7, 2008 |format=fee required}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In her junior year, Rodham became a supporter of the antiwar [[United States presidential election, 1968|presidential nomination campaign]] of Democrat [[Eugene McCarthy]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt090507&quot;/&gt;  Following the [[Martin Luther King, Jr. assassination|assassination of Martin Luther King, Jr.]], Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt090507&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |author=Leibovich, Mark |title=In Turmoil of â68, Clinton Found a New Voice |work=The New York Times |date=September 7, 2007 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/05/us/politics/05clinton.html |accessdate=September 6, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969;&lt;ref name=&quot;bg011293&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;wcaddr&quot;/&gt; she was instrumental in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled in the student disruptions common to other colleges.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg011293&quot;/&gt;  A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first woman President of the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg011293&quot;/&gt; So she could better understand her changing political views, Professor [[Alan Schechter]] assigned Rodham to intern at the [[House Republican Conference]], and she attended the &quot;Wellesley in Washington&quot; summer program.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt090507&quot;/&gt; Rodham was invited by moderate New York Republican Representative [[Charles Goodell]] to help Governor [[Nelson Rockefeller]]âs late-entry campaign for the Republican nomination.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt090507&quot;/&gt;  Rodham attended the [[1968 Republican National Convention]] in Miami. However, she was upset by how Richard Nixon's campaign portrayed Rockefeller and by what she perceived as the convention's &quot;veiled&quot; racist messages, and left the Republican Party for good.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt090507&quot;/&gt;

Returning to Wellesley for her final year, Rodham wrote her senior thesis about the tactics of radical community organizer [[Saul Alinsky]] under Professor Schechter (years later while she was First Lady, [[Hillary Rodham senior thesis|access to the thesis was restricted]] at the request of the White House and it became the subject of some speculation).&lt;ref name=&quot;msn030207&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Reading Hillary Rodham's hidden thesis |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17388372/ |author=Dedman, Bill |publisher=[[MSNBC.com]] |date=March 2, 2007 |accessdate=March 2, 2007 |authorlink=Bill Dedman }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1969, she graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]],&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-bio&quot;/&gt; with departmental honors in political science.&lt;ref name=&quot;msn030207&quot;/&gt; Following pressure from some fellow students,&lt;ref name=&quot;gvn-34&quot;/&gt; she became the first student in Wellesley College history to deliver its commencement address.&lt;ref name=&quot;wcaddr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Wellesley College 1969 Student Commencement Speech |url=http://www.wellesley.edu/PublicAffairs/Commencement/1969/053169hillary.html |author=Rodham, Hillary  |publisher=Wellesley College |date=May 31, 1969 |accessdate=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Her speech received a standing ovation lasting seven minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;bg011293&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Brooke Speech Challenged by Graduate |work=[[Fitchburg Sentinel]] |date=June 2, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Brooke Speech Draws Reply |work=Nevada State Journal |date=June 2, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She was featured in an article published in ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Class of '69 |publisher=''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' |date=June 20, 1969}} The article features Rodham and two student commencement speakers from other schools, with photos and excerpts from their speeches.&lt;/ref&gt; due to the response to a part of her speech that criticized Senator [[Edward Brooke]], who had spoken before her at the commencement.&lt;ref name=&quot;gvn-34&quot;&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 34â36.&lt;/ref&gt;  She also appeared on [[Irv Kupcinet]]'s nationally syndicated television talk show as well as in Illinois and New England newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That summer, she worked her way across [[Alaska]], washing dishes in [[Mount McKinley National Park]] and [[fish processing|sliming]] salmon in a fish processing cannery in [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] (which fired her and shut down overnight when she complained about unhealthy conditions).&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1996, p. 139; {{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=105}}. Clinton would later write, and repeat on the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'', that sliming fish was the best preparation she would ever have for living in Washington. Clinton 2003, pp. 42â43.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law school ===
Rodham then entered [[Yale Law School]], where she served on the editorial board of the ''[[Yale Review of Law and Social Action]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;arkhc&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2744 |title=Hillary Diane Rodham Clinton (1947â) |work=The Encyclopedia of Arkansas History &amp; Culture |accessdate=April 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During her second year, she worked at the [[Yale Child Study Center]],&lt;ref name=&quot;gerth-42&quot;&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 42â43.&lt;/ref&gt; learning about new research on early childhood brain development and working as a research assistant on the seminal work, ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child'' (1973).&lt;ref name=bernstein-75&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The authors of ''Beyond the Best Interests of the Child'' were Center director Al Solnit, Yale Law professor Joe Goldstein, and [[Anna Freud]].&lt;/ref&gt; She also took on cases of [[child abuse]] at [[Yale-New Haven Hospital]]&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein-75&quot;/&gt; and volunteered at New Haven Legal Services to provide free legal advice for the poor.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerth-42&quot;/&gt; In the summer of 1970, she was awarded a grant to work at [[Marian Wright Edelman]]'s Washington Research Project, where she was assigned to Senator [[Walter Mondale]]'s [[Subcommittee on Migratory Labor]].  There she researched [[migrant workers]]' problems in housing, sanitation, health and education.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 1996, pp. 142â143.&lt;/ref&gt; Edelman later became a significant mentor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=71â74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rodham was recruited by political advisor [[Anne Wexler]] to work on the 1970 campaign of Connecticut U.S. Senate candidate [[Joseph Duffey]], with Rodham later crediting Wexler with providing her first job in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/08/AR2009080800058.html |title=Anne Wexler, Political Adviser and Lobbyist, Dies at 79 |author=Weil, Martin |work=The Washington Post |date=August 8, 2009 |accessdate=August 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late spring of 1971, she began dating [[Bill Clinton]], also a law student at Yale. That summer, she interned at the [[Oakland, California]], law firm of [[Treuhaft, Walker and Burnstein]].&lt;ref name=bernstein-82&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=82â83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The firm was well-known for its support of [[constitutional rights]], [[civil liberties]], and [[Far left|radical causes]] (two of its four partners were current or former [[Communist Party USA|Communist Party members]]);&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein-82&quot;/&gt; Rodham worked on child custody and other cases.&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex02&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.nysun.com/national/hillary-clintons-radical-summer/66933/ |title=Hillary Clinton's Radical Summer |author=Gerstein, Josh |work=The New York Sun |date=November 26, 2007 |accessdate=May 9, 2009}} Gerstein finds it is unclear exactly which cases beyond child custody ones Rodham worked on at the Treuhaft firm. Anti-Clinton writers such as [[Barbara Olson]] would later charge Hillary Clinton with never repudiating Treuhaft's ideology, and for retaining social and political ties with his wife and fellow communist [[Jessica Mitford]]. (Olson 1999, pp. 56â57) Research by ''[[The New York Sun]]'' in 2007 revealed that Mitford and Hillary Clinton were not close, and had a falling out over a 1980 Arkansas prisoner case.

During her postgraduate study, Rodham served as staff attorney for Edelman's newly founded [[Children's Defense Fund]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=91â92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a consultant to the Carnegie Council on Children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Adults Urge Children's Rights |work=The Arizona Sentinel |date=October 4, 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1974, she was a member of the impeachment inquiry staff in [[Washington, D.C.]], advising the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] during the [[Watergate scandal]].&lt;ref name=bernstein-94&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=94â96, 101â103}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the guidance of Chief Counsel [[John Doar]] and senior member [[Bernard Nussbaum]],&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein-75&quot;/&gt; Rodham helped research procedures of impeachment and the historical grounds and standards for impeachment.&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein-94&quot;/&gt;  The committee's work culminated in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.&lt;ref name=&quot;bernstein-94&quot;/&gt;

By then, Rodham was viewed as someone with a bright political future; Democratic political organizer and consultant [[Betsey Wright]] had moved from Texas to Washington the previous year to help guide her career;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wright thought Rodham had the potential to become a future senator or president.&lt;ref&gt;Maraniss 1995, p. 277.&lt;/ref&gt;  Meanwhile, Clinton had repeatedly asked her to marry him, and she continued to demur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=90, 120}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after failing the [[District of Columbia]] [[bar exam]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=92.}} Two-thirds (551 of 817) of the candidates had passed, and Rodham did not tell even close friends of the failure until revealing it thirty years later in her autobiography.&lt;/ref&gt; and passing the Arkansas exam, Rodham came to a key decision.

He was then teaching law and running for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in his home state.

Following her husband's November 1978 election as [[Governor of Arkansas]], Rodham became First Lady of Arkansas in January 1979, her title for twelve years (1979â1981, 1983â1992).

Bill Clinton returned to the governor's office two years later by winning the election of 1982.

Hillary Clinton received sustained national attention for the first time when her husband became a candidate for the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1992|Democratic presidential nomination of 1992]]. Before the [[New Hampshire primary]], [[Tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] publications printed claims that Bill Clinton had had an extramarital affair with Arkansas lounge singer [[Gennifer Flowers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE5D61E31F936A15752C0A964958260 |title=Clintons to Rebut Rumors on &quot;60 Minutes&quot; |work=The New York Times |date=January 25, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the Clintons appeared together on ''[[60 Minutes]]'', where Bill Clinton denied the affair but acknowledged &quot;causing pain in my marriage.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/flowers012792.htm |title=In 1992, Clinton Conceded Marital 'Wrongdoing' |work=The Washington Post |date=January 26, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This joint appearance was credited with rescuing his campaign.&lt;ref&gt;Troy 2006, pp. 39â42; Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 94â96.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the campaign, Hillary Clinton made culturally disparaging remarks about [[Tammy Wynette]] and her outlook on marriage,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex05&quot;&gt;During the political damage control over the [[Gennifer Flowers]] episode during the 1992 campaign, Hillary Clinton said in the joint ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview, &quot;I'm not sitting here as some little woman 'standing by my man' like Tammy Wynette. I'm sitting here because I love him and I respect him, and I honor what he's been through and what we've been through together.&quot; The seemingly sneering reference to [[country music]] provoked immediate criticism that Clinton was culturally tone-deaf, and Tammy Wynette herself did not like the remark because her classic song &quot;[[Stand by Your Man]]&quot; is not written in the [[first-person narrative|first person]]. See {{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/november/7/newsid_4385000/4385582.stm |title=2000: Hillary Clinton is first First Lady in Senate |publisher=BBC News |date=November 7, 2000 |accessdate=October 1, 2007}}  Wynette added that Clinton had &quot;offended every true country music fan and every person who has 'made it on their own' with no one to take them to a White House.&quot; See Troy 2006, p. 42. A few days later, on ''[[Prime Time Live]]'', Hillary Clinton apologized to Wynette. Clinton would later write that she had been careless in her choice of words and that &quot;the fallout from my reference to Tammy Wynette was instant{{ndash}} as it deserved to be{{ndash}} and brutal.&quot;  See Clinton 2003, p. 108. The two women later resolved their differences, with Wynette appearing at a Clinton fund raiser.&lt;/ref&gt; and about women staying home and baking cookies and having teas,&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex06&quot;&gt;Less than two months after the Tammy Wynette remarks, Hillary Clinton was facing questions about whether she could have avoided possible conflicts of interest between her governor husband and work given to the Rose Law Firm, when she remarked, &quot;I've done the best I can to lead my life ... You know, I suppose I could have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas, but what I decided to do was fulfill my profession, which I entered before my husband was in public life&quot; (Clinton 2003, p. 109).  The &quot;cookies and teas&quot; part of this statement prompted even more culture-based criticism of Clinton's apparent distaste for women who had chosen to be homemakers; the remark became a recurring campaign liability (Bernstein 2007, pp. 205â206). Clinton subsequently offered up some cookie recipes as a way of making amends, and would later write of her chagrin: &quot;Besides, I've done quite a lot of cookie baking in my life, and tea-pouring too!&quot; (Clinton 2003, p. 109).&lt;/ref&gt; that were ill-considered by her own admission.  Bill Clinton said that in electing him, the nation would &quot;get two for the price of one&quot;, referring to the prominent role his wife would assume.&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2008, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beginning with [[Daniel Wattenberg]]'s August 1992 ''[[The American Spectator]]'' article &quot;The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock&quot;, Hillary Clinton's own past ideological and ethical record came under conservative attack.&lt;ref name=&quot;macbeth&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=The Lady Macbeth of Little Rock |author=Wattenberg, Daniel |work=The American Spectator |month=August |year=1992 |authorlink=Daniel Wattenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least twenty other articles in major publications also drew comparisons between her and [[Lady Macbeth]].&lt;ref&gt;Burns 2008, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some critics called it inappropriate for the First Lady to play a central role in matters of public policy.

Houston encouraged Clinton to pursue the Roosevelt connection, and while no psychic techniques were used with Clinton, critics and comics immediately suggested that Clinton was holding [[sÃ©ance]]s with Eleanor Roosevelt. The White House stated that this was merely a [[brainstorming]] exercise, and a private poll later indicated that most of the public believed these were indeed just imaginary conversations, with the remainder believing that communication with the dead was actually possible.

In 1998, the Clintons' relationship became the subject of much speculation when investigations revealed that the President had had extramarital sexual activities with White House intern [[Monica Lewinsky]].&lt;ref&gt;Troy 2006, pp. 176â177.&lt;/ref&gt; Events surrounding the [[Lewinsky scandal]] eventually led to the [[impeachment of Bill Clinton]].  When the allegations against her husband were first made public, Hillary Clinton stated that they were the result of a &quot;[[vast right-wing conspiracy]]&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Troy 2006, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; characterizing the Lewinsky charges as the latest in a long, organized, collaborative series of charges by Clinton political enemies&lt;ref group=&quot;nb&quot; name=&quot;ex08&quot;&gt;Clinton was referring to the [[Arkansas Project]] and its funder [[Richard Mellon Scaife]], Kenneth Starr's connections to Scaife, [[Regnery Publishing]] and its connections to [[Lucianne Goldberg]] and [[Linda Tripp]], [[Jerry Falwell]], and others.

She later said that she had been misled by her husband's initial claims that no affair had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;Troy 2006, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; After the evidence of President Clinton's encounters with Lewinsky became incontrovertible, she issued a public statement reaffirming her commitment to their marriage,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=517}}&lt;/ref&gt; but privately was reported to be furious at him&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|pp=512, 518}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was unsure if she wanted to stay in the marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bernstein|2007|p=521}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a variety of public reactions to Hillary Clinton after this: some women admired her strength and poise in private matters made public, some sympathized with her as a victim of her husband's insensitive behavior, others criticized her as being an [[Codependence|enabler]] to her husband's indiscretions, while still others accused her of cynically staying in a failed marriage as a way of keeping or even fostering her own political influence.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerth-195&quot;/&gt; Her public approval ratings in the wake of the revelations shot upward to around 70&amp;nbsp;percent, the highest they had ever been.&lt;ref name=&quot;gerth-195&quot;&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; In her 2003 memoir, she would attribute her decision to stay married to &quot;a love that has persisted for decades&quot; and add: &quot;No one understands me better and no one can make me laugh the way Bill does. Even after all these years, he is still the most interesting, energizing and fully alive person I have ever met.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clinton 2003, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the campaign, opponents accused Clinton of [[Parachute candidate|carpetbagging]], as she had never resided in New York nor participated in the state's politics before this race.  Clinton began her campaign by visiting every county in the state, in a &quot;listening tour&quot; of small-group settings.&lt;ref&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the campaign, she devoted considerable time in traditionally Republican [[Upstate New York]] regions.&lt;ref name = &quot;historic win&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/07/senate.ny/ |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton scores historic win in New York |publisher=CNN |date=November 8, 2000 |accessdate=August 22, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Clinton vowed to improve the economic situation in those areas, promising to deliver 200,000&amp;nbsp;jobs to the state over her term.

After the [[Iraq War]] began, Clinton made trips to Iraq and Afghanistan to visit American troops stationed there.

Senator Clinton voted against President Bush's two major tax cut packages, the [[Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001]] and the [[Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003]].&lt;ref name=&quot;pvs-hrc&quot;/&gt;  Clinton voted against the 2005 confirmation of [[John G.

Looking to establish a &quot;progressive infrastructure&quot; to rival that of [[American conservatism]], Clinton played a formative role in conversations that led to the 2003 founding of former Clinton administration chief of staff [[John Podesta]]'s [[Center for American Progress]], shared aides with [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]], founded in 2003, and advised the Clintons' former antagonist [[David Brock]]'s [[Media Matters for America]], created in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 267â269, 313, 401.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[United States Senate elections, 2004|2004 Senate elections]], she successfully pushed new Democratic Senate leader [[Harry Reid]] to create a Senate [[war room]] to handle daily political messaging.&lt;ref&gt;Gerth and Van Natta Jr. 2007, pp. 267â269&lt;/ref&gt;

Clinton led candidates competing for the Democratic nomination in [[Nationwide opinion polling for the Democratic Party 2008 presidential candidates|opinion polls for the election]] throughout the first half of 2007.

In a [[Gallup poll]] conducted during May 2005, 54&amp;nbsp;percent of respondents considered Clinton a [[American liberalism|liberal]], 30&amp;nbsp;percent considered her a [[moderate]], and 9&amp;nbsp;percent considered her a [[American conservatism|conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Poll: Mixed messages for Hillary Clinton |publisher=CNN |date=May 26, 2005 |url=http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/26/hillary.clinton/index.html |accessdate=February 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several organizations attempted to measure Clinton's place on the [[political spectrum]] scientifically using her Senate votes.
''[[National Journal]]'''s 2004 study of roll-call votes assigned Clinton a rating of 30 in the political spectrum, relative to the then-current Senate, with a rating of 1 being most liberal and 100 being most conservative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8573139/ |title=Clinton burnishes hawkish image |date=July 14, 2005 |publisher=MSNBC.com |author=Curry, Tom |accessdate=August 23, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''National Journal''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s subsequent rankings placed her as the 32nd-most liberal senator in 2006 and 16th-most liberal senator in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nj.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/ |title=Obama: Most Liberal Senator In 2007 |author=Friel, Brian  |coauthors=Cohen, Richard E.; Victor, Kirk |publisher=[[National Journal]] |date=January 31, 2008 |accessdate=April 25, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A 2004 analysis by political scientists Joshua D. Clinton of [[Princeton University]], Simon Jackman and Doug Rivers of [[Stanford University]] found her to be likely the sixth-to-eighth-most liberal Senator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |format=PDF |url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/TheMostLiberalSenator-Clinton.pdf |title=&quot;The Most Liberal Senator&quot;?

''[[The Almanac of American Politics]]'', edited by [[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] and [[Richard E.

[[Interest group]]s also gave Clinton scores based on how well her Senate votes aligned with the positions of the group.
Through 2008, she had an average lifetime 90&amp;nbsp;percent &quot;Liberal Quotient&quot; from [[Americans for Democratic Action]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adaction.org/pages/publications/voting-records.php |title=Voting Records |publisher=[[Americans for Democratic Action]] |accessdate=March 21, 2009}}  Average consists of a 95 in 2001 through 2004 and 2006, a 100 in 2005, a 75 in 2007, and a 70 in 2008 (the decline in the final two years was due to missed votes while campaigning for president).&lt;/ref&gt;
and a lifetime 8&amp;nbsp;percent rating from the [[American Conservative Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2008senate.htm |title=2008 U.S. Senate Votes |publisher=[[American Conservative Union]] |accessdate=March 21, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}} Lifetime rating is given. {{Dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings and recordings ==
As First Lady of the United States, Clinton published a weekly [[Print syndication|syndicated]] newspaper column titled &quot;Talking It Over&quot; from 1995 to 2000, distributed by [[Creators Syndicate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.creators.com/opinion/hillary-clinton.html |title=Hillary Rodham Clinton â Talking It Over |work=[[Creators Syndicate]] |accessdate=August 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It focused on her experiences and those of women, children and families she met during her travels around the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whitehouse.gov&quot;/&gt;

In 1996, Clinton presented a vision for the children of America in the book ''[[It Takes a Village|It Takes a Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us]]''.
