'''Wof''' is [[Quiero Club]]'s debut album was recorded between 2005 and 2006 and was released in December 2006 by [[Happy Fi Records]] and Labes ([[EMI Music Mexico]]).
Backstage Drama was the official first single, although No Coke made the band popular since December 2004. The second single was Let Da Music and the third and last single is LatinAmerica. 
The album has been described by the members of the band as a partying night, beginning with a &quot;Backstage Drama&quot; and ending with the epic &quot;Frogger&quot; that, according to them, would be like watching the sun rise after a massive rave.
