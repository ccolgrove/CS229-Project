'''Joe Beasman Hall''', better known as '''Joe B. Hall''' (born November 30, 1928 in [[Cynthiana, Kentucky|Cynthiana]], [[Kentucky]]) was the head [[basketball]] coach at the [[University of Kentucky]] from 1972 to 1985. He previously coached at [[University of Central Missouri|Central Missouri State University]] and [[Regis University]] before returning to UK in 1965 to serve as an assistant coach under [[Adolph Rupp]].  

Coach Hall was given a difficult task, to follow in the footsteps of his legendary predecessor, [[Adolph Rupp]]. In the [[1978 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1978 NCAA Tournament]], he coached the Wildcats to their fifth [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship]]. He was named National Coach of the Year in 1978 and [[Southeastern Conference]] Coach of the Year on four different occasions. His record at UK was 297 - 100, and 373-156 over his career.

Along with the 1978 title, Hall also guided Kentucky to a runner-up finish to UCLA in the [[1975 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1975 NCAA tournament]] (which included an upset of heavily-favored and previously undefeated Indiana in a regional final), a [[Final Four]] appearance in the [[1984 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1984 NCAA Tournament]] (losing to eventual champion [[Georgetown University|Georgetown]]), and an [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] championship in 1976. He won 8 [[Southeastern Conference]] regular season championships and one [[Southeastern Conference]] tournament championship (1984).

Coach Hall is one of only three men to win an NCAA championship as a player (1949- Kentucky) and coach (1978- Kentucky). The only others to achieve this feat are [[Bob Knight]] and [[Dean Smith]].

Coach Hall played one year of varsity basketball at Kentucky before transferring to the [[University of the South]] (Sewanee), where he completed his basketball playing eligibility but did not graduate.  After Sewanee, Hall toured with the [[Harlem Globetrotters]] and later returned to Kentucky to complete his undergraduate studies.  Hall graduated from Kentucky in 1955.

Coach Hall currently co-hosts a popular radio sports talk show with former [[University of Louisville]] basketball head coach [[Denny Crum]].
