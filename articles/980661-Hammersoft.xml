The '''North American Debating Championship''' is the official university [[debating]] championship of [[North America]], sanctioned by the national university debating associations in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]], the [[American Parliamentary Debate Association]] and the [[Canadian University Society for Intercollegiate Debate]].

It has been held on an alternating basis between the United States and Canada since 1991. The host university arranges all judging and is not allowed in the competition. The North American Public Speaking Championship is often held in parallel with the debating competition.

==Results==
In 20 championships from 1991 to 2011, a team from a university in the home country has won 15 times. The most successful university overall has been the [[University of Toronto]], with five championship victories. It is followed by [[Yale University]], with four victories, notably all in the last six years. After that, the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) and [[McGill University]] have two championships each, and no other university has won more than once.

No team has ever repeated as the top team at the championship. Three individuals have won the top team award twice: Matthew Wansley of [[Yale University]] won back-to-back championships from 2005-2007. Prior to that, [[Nathan MacDonald]] and Robert Silver won first together for the [[University of Western Ontario]] in 1997-1998, then MacDonald for the [[University of Guelph]] in 1998-1999, and Silver for the [[University of Ottawa]] in 1999-2000.

Two people have won the top individual debater award twice: Casey Halladay of the [[University of Ottawa]] in 1997-1998 and 1999-2000, and Rory Gillis of [[Yale University]] in two consecutive years from 2004-2006.

No individual has ever repeated as North American Public Speaking Champion. [[McGill University]] and the [[University of Ottawa]] have each had three public speaking champions, the most of any university.

Few universities outside Canada and the United States have ever competed, and none has ever won. The most frequent host has been [[McGill University]] in [[Montreal, Quebec]], which has hosted the championship three times. [[Bates College]], [[Cornell University]], [[Johns Hopkins University]], [[Queen's University]], and the [[University of Toronto]] have each hosted twice.
