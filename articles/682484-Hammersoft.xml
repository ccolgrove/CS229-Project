'''Highway 52''', known locally as the ''Heritage Highway'', is a 243&amp;nbsp;km (151&amp;nbsp;mi) long alternate loop route between [[Arras, British Columbia|Arras]], on the [[British Columbia Highway 97|John Hart Highway]] just west of [[Dawson Creek, British Columbia|Dawson Creek]], and [[Tupper, British Columbia|Tupper]], on the B.C.-[[Alberta]] boundary, via the community of [[Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia|Tumbler Ridge]], 98&amp;nbsp;km (61&amp;nbsp;mi) south of Arras and 145&amp;nbsp;km (90&amp;nbsp;mi) south of Tupper. The highway to Arras was first given the number 52 in 1988, and the highway to Tupper received the same number in the late 1990s.

In addition to Tumbler Ridge, the Heritage Highway provides access to [[Bearhole Lake Provincial Park and Protected Area]] and [[One Island Lake Provincial Park]].
