The '''Honam Line''' is a major railway line serving the [[Honam]] region ([[North Jeolla|North]] and [[South Jeolla]] Provinces) in [[South Korea]].  The line is served by frequent passenger trains from [[Seoul]] (via the [[Gyeongbu Line]]) to [[Gwangju]] and [[Mokpo]].

==History==

A Honam Railway from Seoul to Mokpo was first proposed in 1896 by a French company.&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.land.go.kr/document/info/honam/jl06.pdf |title=ì ë¼ì§ë°© - êµíµâíµì ì²´ê³ì ë°ë¬ |publisher=Land Portal |accessdate=2010-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the start of the [[Russo-Japanese War]], in May 1904, [[Imperial Japan]] forced Korea to sign an agreement granting the Japanese military control over railways, including the right to seize land.&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;/&gt;  Japan the seized much of the fertile Honam plain in advance of a planned Honam Line.&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;/&gt;  

The construction of the line started in 1910.&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;/&gt;  The first {{convert|39.9|km|mi|abbr=on}} between Daejeon and [[Yeonsan]] was opened in July 1911.&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;/&gt;  The line was extended to Ganggyeong in November 1911, to Iri (today [[Iksan Station|Iksan]]) in March 1912, to [[Gimje]] in October 1912 and to [[Jeongeup Station|Jeongeup]] in December 1912.&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;/&gt;  Construction continued from the other end of the line, with the section from Mokpo to Hakgyo (today [[Hampyeong]]) opened in May 1913; and extended to [[Naju]] in July 1913, to Songjeong-ri (today [[GwangjuÂ·Songjeong Station|GwangjuÂ·Songjeong]]) in October 1913, and finally to Jeongeup,&lt;ref name=&quot;land&quot;/&gt; completing the line on January 11, 1914.&lt;ref name=&quot;Korail-lines&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/kra/ope/ope08000/w_ope08606.jsp |title=ê²½ììì¹ &gt; ê²½ìê³µì &gt; ììíí© &gt; ììê±°ë¦¬íí© |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upgrade===&lt;!-- [[Korea Train Express#Phase 1: SeoulâDaegu and conventional line upgrades]] links here--&gt;

The Honam Line was upgraded to an electrified and double-tracked line for higher speeds in stages.

When Honam KTX services started on April 1, 2004, the shortest rail travel time between the capital and Mokpo was reduced from 4 hours 32 minutes to 2 hours 58 minutes. between Seoul and Gwangju, the time reduced from 3 hours 53 minutes to 2 hours 38 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;EffectofHSR2008&quot;/&gt;

At the Seoul end, since the December 15, 2004, timetable change, most Honam KTX services don't terminate in [[Seoul Station]], the terminus of the [[Gyeongbu High Speed Railway#Gyeongbu KTX|Gyeongbu KTX]] services, but in nearby Yongsan Station,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2004/11/12/2004111261021.html |title=Train Routes to Be Split Between Seoul, Yongsan Stations |date=2004-11-12 |publisher=The Chosun Ilbo |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where the travel distance to Mokpo Station is 404.4&amp;nbsp;km.  In addition, some services are extended beyond Yongsan, passing Seoul Station and continuing for 14.9&amp;nbsp;km along the [[Gyeongui Line]] to terminate at [[Haengsin Station]],&lt;ref name=&quot;booking&quot;/&gt; next to which KTX trains have a depot.&lt;ref name=&quot;LaunchHSR2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Kyung Chul |url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr48/pdf/f30_Lee.pdf |title=Launch of Korean High-Speed Railway and Efforts to Innovate Future Korean Railway |journal=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review |issue=48 |pages=30â35 |month=August |year=2007 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The service uses the Gyeongbu HSR until Daejeon, and the upgraded Honam Line from there. The service calls at the following stations:&lt;ref name=&quot;KTXTT-Nov2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/download/sta/1_korail_total_train_time_101101.xls |title=KTX Time Table 2010.11.01 |language=[[Korean language|Korean]] |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KTXfare-Nov2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://info.korail.com/2007/download/sta/KTX(20101101).xls |title=KTX 2010.11.01 |language=[[Korean language|Korean]] |publisher=Korail |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following general ticket price increases and the separation of weekday and weekend fares, as of November 2010, the standard one-way Seoul to Mokpo ticket price stands at 40,500 won on weekdays and 43,300 won on weekends, but with significant reductions on newly introduced non-reserved seats.&lt;ref name=&quot;KTXfare-Nov2010&quot;/&gt;  Another problem passenger surveys in the first months found was station access and the limited capacity of bus connections, leading to the frequent use of taxis.&lt;ref name=&quot;complaints&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2546780 |title=One year later, KTX faces rider shortfalls, complaints |date=2005-03-25 |publisher=JoongAng Daily |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Modal share====

After its first year of operation, on relations with significant distances along the conventional Honam Line, the Honam KTX service gained market share mostly at the expense of conventional trains, while the total share of rail was stagnant on some relations.&lt;ref name=&quot;EffectofHSR2008&quot;/&gt;  By 2008, between Yongsan and the cities mid-way along the Honam Line, rail's total modal share passed 50%.&lt;ref name=&quot;5years&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.railsafety.or.kr/web/FileDownload.do?file=/por/jsp/admin/board/PORAdminBoardR.jsp/KTX_%EA%B0%9C%ED%86%B5_5%EC%A3%BC%EB%85%84_%ED%94%84%EB%A0%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%82%B7.hwp |title=KTX ê°íµ 5ì£¼ë ë³´ëìë£ |language=Korean |date=2009-04-01 |publisher=Rail Safety Information System |archiveurl=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:bZP-jjME4i0J:www.railsafety.or.kr/web/FileDownload.do%3Ffile%3D/por/jsp/admin/board/PORAdminBoardR.jsp/KTX_%EA%B0%9C%ED%86%B5_5%EC%A3%BC%EB%85%84_%ED%94%84%EB%A0%88%EC%8A%A4%ED%82%B7.hwp |archivedate=2010-11-11 |accessdate=2010-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Strong gains at the expense of air transport and private cars were seen between Yongsan and Honam KTX service endpoints Mokpo and Gwangju, too.&lt;ref name=&quot;5years&quot;/&gt;

Starting from April 2011, the new Jeolla KTX service will share tracks with the Honam KTX until Iksan, and diverge from there to reach Yeosu along the [[Jeolla Line]].&lt;ref name=&quot;KTX-2011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://issue.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2010/05/12/2010051201015.html |title=ìë°ãêµíµãë¯¼ì ì¬ì ì´ëê¹ì§ ìë ì´ëë¥¼ ê°ë 'ì¬ìë ì§ê¸ ê³µì¬ì¤' 2ì¡°ì í¬ìí´ 2ëê° ë¨ê³ë³ ê±´ë¦½ ëì¬ì°ê²° ëë¡ë§ãêµíµí¼ì¡ì ìì  |language=[[Korean language|Korean]] |date=2010-05-12 |publisher=[[The Chosun Ilbo]] |accessdate=2010-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Korail also plans to run some through KTX services to [[Incheon International Airport]] on the [[AREX]] line from 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;plans2020&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://joongangdaily.joins.com/article/view.asp?aid=2925474 |title=Bullet trains coming to a town near you by 2020 |date=2010-09-02 |publisher=JoongAng Daily |accessdate=2010-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The planned travel time between Incheon International Airport and Gwangju is 3 hours.&lt;ref name=&quot;AREX-KTX&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electimes.com/home/news/main/viewmain.jsp?news_uid=78391 |title=ê³µí­ì² ë, KTX, ì§íì²  9í¸ì ê³¼ ì§ê²° íì±í ìí¨ë¤ |language=Korean |date=2010-09-30 |publisher=Electimes |accessdate=2010-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2014, the Honam KTX Line is to transfer to the future [[Honam Line (KTX)|Honam High Speed Railway]] between Osong on the Gyeongbu HSR and GwangjuÂ·Songjeong. By 2017, the service will transfer to the new line on the remaining section to Mokpo, too.
