'''John Vliet Lindsay''' (November 24, 1921 â December 19, 2000) was an American politician, lawyer and broadcaster who was a U.S. Congressman, Mayor of New York City, candidate for U.S. President and regular guest host of ''[[Good Morning America]]''.

During his political career, he served as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1959 to 1965 and as [[Mayor of New York|mayor]] of New York City from 1966 to 1973.  He switched from the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Party in 1971, and launched a brief but unsuccessful bid for the [[United_States_presidential_election, 1972#Democratic_Party_nomination|1972 Democratic presidential nomination]] as well as the 1980 Democratic nomination for Senator from New York.  He died from Parkinson's disease and pneumonia on [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina|Hilton Head Island]], South Carolina, December 19, 2000.

==Early life==
Lindsay was born in New York City on [[West End Avenue]] to George Nelson Lindsay and the former Florence Eleanor Vliet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/nyregion/john-v-lindsay-mayor-and-maverick-dies-at-79.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all|title=John V.

With the outbreak of World War II, Lindsay completed his studies early and in 1943 joined the [[United States Navy]]  as a gunnery officer.  He obtained the rank of [[Lieutenant#Lieutenant|lieutenant]], earning five [[battle stars]] through action in the [[invasion of Sicily]] and a series of landings in the [[Pacific Theater of Operations|Pacific theater]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0D15F63D5A117B93C1A81783D85F4C8585F9|title=LINDSAY LACKED PARTY'S BACKING; Surprise G.

Back in New York, Lindsay met his future wife, Mary Anne Harrison, at the wedding of [[Nancy Walker Bush Ellis|Nancy Bush]] (daughter of Connecticut's Senator [[Prescott Bush]] and sister of future President [[George H.W.

He started gravitating toward politics, serving as one of the founders of the Youth for Eisenhower club in 1951 and as president of the New York [[Young Republican]] club in 1952.&lt;ref name=&quot;congress&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00717FF3F59107B93C7A9178AD95F4C8585F9|title=LINDSAY VICTORY PUTS HIM IN FORE; He Is Seen as G.O.P.

While in Congress, Lindsay established a liberal voting record increasingly at odds with his party.&lt;ref name=&quot;Weaver&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20D15FF385812738DDDA90B94DD405B858AF1D3|title=Lindsay's Voting Veers From G.O.P.; House Record Also Shows a Shift From Conservatives|author=[[Warren Weaver]]|date=May 30, 1965|work=New York Times|pages=30|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was an early supporter of federal aid to education and [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]];&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannato &quot; /&gt; and advocated the establishment of a federal [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Urban Affairs]] and a [[National Endowment for the Humanities|National Foundation for the Arts and Humanities]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannato &quot; /&gt;  He was called a maverick,&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt;  casting the lone dissenting vote for a Republican- sponsored bill extending the power of the Postmaster General to impound obscene mail&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannato &quot; /&gt;  and one of only two dissenting votes for a bill allowing federal interception of mail from Communist countries.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannato &quot; /&gt;  Also known for his wit, when asked by his party leaders why he opposed legislation to combat communism and pornography, he replied they were the major industries of his district and if they were suppressed then &quot;the 17th district would be a depressed area&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;winner&quot; /&gt;

==Mayoralty==
In 1965, Lindsay was elected [[Mayor of New York City]] as a Republican with the support of the [[Liberal Party of New York]] in a three-way race. He defeated Democratic mayoral candidate [[Abraham D. Beame]], then City Comptroller, as well as ''[[National Review|National Review magazine]]''  founder [[William F. Buckley, Jr.]], who ran on the [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative]] line.  The unofficial motto of the campaign, taken from a [[Murray Kempton]] column, was &quot;He is fresh and everyone else is tired&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cannato &quot;&gt;{{cite book|last=Cannato |first=Vincent |title=The Ungovernable City |publisher=Basic Books; |date=June 20, 2001|pages=720 |isbn=0465008437 978-0465008438|url=http://books.google.com/?id=Upv5ezVPBOMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Ungovernable+City}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Remembering&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/nyregion/metro-matters-remembering-a-mayor-faults-and-all.html|title=Metro Matters; Remembering A Mayor, Faults and All|last=PURNICK|first=JOYCE |date=December 21, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johnvlindsay.jpg|thumb|left|Congressman Lindsay speaking at Board of Estimate meeting at City Hall in April 1963]]

Lindsay inherited a city with serious fiscal and economic problems left by outgoing Democratic Mayor [[Robert F. Wagner, Jr.]] The old [[manufacturing]] jobs that supported generations of uneducated immigrants were disappearing, millions of middle class residents were fleeing to the suburbs, and public sector workers had won the right to unionize.

===Labor issues===
{{further|[[1966 New York City transit strike]]|[[New York City teacher's strike of 1968]]}}
On his first day as mayor, Jan. 1, 1966,  the [[Transport Workers Union of America]] (TWU) led by [[Mike Quill]] shut down the city with a [[1966 New York City transit strike|complete halt of subway and bus service]]. The leader of the TWU had predicted a nine-day strike at most, but Lindsay's refusal to negotiate delayed a settlement and the strike lasted twelve days. Quill's mocking press conferences gave the city the impression that Lindsay was not tough enough to deal with the city's sources of power.

As New Yorkers endured the transit strike, Lindsay remarked, &quot;I still think it's a fun city,&quot;  and walked four miles (6&amp;nbsp;km) from his hotel room to City Hall in a gesture to show it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaap&quot;/&gt; [[Dick Schaap]], then a columnist for the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'', coined and popularized the sarcastic term in an article titled ''Fun City''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaap&quot;&gt;The Fun City, ''New York Herald Tribune'', January 7, 1966, , pg. 13:&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FYI Fun&quot;&gt;DANIEL B. SCHNEIDER ,[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B07E5DF113FF930A35752C0A96F958260 F.Y.I.] , ''NY Times'', January 3, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, Schaap sardonically pointed out that it wasn't.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schaap&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FYI Fun&quot;/&gt;  The term continued to carry with it a derisive tone as the city became more dangerous and corporate headquarters began moving to suburban locations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,899450,00.html Exodus from Fun City ], ''Time Magazine'',Feb. 24, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

The transit strike was the first of many labor struggles. In 1968 in an attempt to decentralize the city's school system, Lindsay granted three local school boards in the city complete control over their schools, in an effort to allow communities to have more of a say in their schools. The city's teachers union, the [[United Federation of Teachers]] (UFT), however, saw the breakup as a way of union busting, as a decentralized school system would force the union to negotiate with 33 separate school boards rather than with one centralized body. As a result in May 1968 several teachers working in schools located in the neighborhood of [[Ocean Hill, Brooklyn|Ocean Hill]]-[[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]], one of the neighborhoods were the decentralization was being tested, were fired from their jobs by the community run school board. Furious, the UFT demanded the reinstatement of the dismissed teachers citing that the teachers had been fired without [[due process]]. When their demands ignored the UFT called the first of three strikes leading ultimately to a [[New York City teachers' strike of 1968|protracted city-wide teachers' strike]], which stretched over seven-month period between May and November.&lt;ref&gt;Damon Stetson [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html,.=F4091EFE3555157493C6A81782D85F4C8685F9&amp;scp=3&amp;sq=teachers+strike+racial&amp;st=p A Most Unusual Strike; Bread-and-Butter Issues Transcended By Educational and Racial Concerns], ''NY Times'', September 14, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; The battle became a symbol of the chaos of New York City and the city's inability to deliver a functioning school system.  The strike was tinged with racial and anti-Semitic overtones, pitting Black and Puerto Rican parents against Jewish teachers and supervisors.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrospect&quot; /&gt;  Many thought the mayor had made a bad situation worse by taking sides against the teachers.&lt;ref name=&quot;retrospect&quot;&gt;Maurice Carroll [http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB061FFB3B5D127A93C3AA1789D95F478785F9 Lindsay in Retrospect], ''NY Times'', December 31, 1973, Page 7&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode left a legacy of tensions between blacks and Jews that went on for years,&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt; and Lindsay called it his greatest regret.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt;

That same year, 1968, also saw a three day Broadway strike and a nine day [[sanitation]] strike.&lt;ref name=&quot;GARBAGE STRIKE IS ENDED&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FB0A14FE3F5F127A93C3A81789D85F4C8685F9|title=GARBAGE STRIKE IS ENDED ON ROCKEFELLER'S TERMS;; MEN BACK ON JOB|last=STETSON|first=DAMON|date=February 11, 1968|work=New York Times|pages=1|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quality of life in New York reached a nadir during the sanitation strike, as mounds of [[Waste|garbage]] caught fire and strong winds whirled the filth through the streets.&lt;ref name=&quot;PERLMUTTER Garbage&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0C1EF73B5C147493C7A91789D85F4C8685F9|title=SHOTS ARE FIRED IN REFUSE STRIKE; FILTH LITTERS CITY; Shotgun Blasts Shatter 2 Panes at Home of Foreman Who Continues to Work MAYOR TOURS STREETS Mounting Garbage Is 'Very Serious,' Lindsay Says -Pact Talks Due Today Garbage Piles Up in Streets as Strike Grows 'Very Serious' |last=PERLMUTTER|first=EMANUEL |date=February 5, 1968|work=New York Times|pages=1|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1968, the New York City Police Department deployed snipers to protect Lindsay during a public ceremony, shortly after they detained a knife-wielding man who had demanded to meet the mayor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F60E15FD3E5D137A93C0A8178DD85F4C8685F9 &quot;Antisniper Police Protect City Hall; Lindsay Guard TightenedâMan With Knife Seized&quot;], ''The New York Times''.

Retrieved March 16, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; With the schools shut down, police engaged in a slowdown, firefighters threatening job actions, the city awash in garbage, and racial and religious tensions breaking to the surface, Lindsay later called the last six months of 1968 &quot;the worst of my public life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt; 

The summer of 1971 ushered in another devastating strike, as over 8,000 workers belonging to [[AFSCME]] District Council 37 walked off their jobs for two days. The strikers included workers on the city's [[drawbridge]]s and sewer plants. Drawbridges over the [[Harlem River]] were locked in the &quot;up&quot; position, barring transit by automobile, and hundreds of thousands of gallons of raw sewage flowed into area waterways.

In 1966 the settlement terms of the transit strike, combined with increased welfare costs and general economic decline, forced Lindsay to lobby the New York State legislature for a new municipal [[income tax]] and higher water rates for city residents, plus a new [[commuter tax]] for people who worked in the city but resided elsewhere.

===Re-election===
In 1969, a backlash against Lindsay caused him to lose the Republican mayoral [[primary election|primary]] to [[New York State Senate|state Senator]] [[John Marchi|John J. Marchi]], who was enthusiastically supported by [[William F. Buckley]] and the party conservatives. In the Democratic primary, the most conservative candidate, City Controller [[Mario Procaccino]], defeated several more liberal contenders and won the nomination with only a [[Plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the votes. &quot;The more the Mario,&quot; he quipped.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The More the Mario|last=Pileggi|first=Nicholas|date=April 14, 1969|publisher=New York Magazine|accessdate=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Despite not having the Republican nomination, Lindsay was still on the ballot as the candidate of the New York Liberal Party.  In his campaign he said &quot;mistakes were made&quot; and called being mayor of New York &quot;the second toughest job in America.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F5071EFB3E591A7493C3A8178AD95F4D8685F9|title=The 2d Toughest Campaign|last=DOUGHERTY|first=PHILIP|date=November 11, 1969|work=New York Times|pages=73|accessdate=September 19, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While losing White ethnic, working-class voters, Lindsay was able to win with support from three distinct groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;lizzi&quot; /&gt; First were the city's minorities, mostly African-Americans and Puerto Ricans, who were concentrated in [[Harlem]], the [[South Bronx]] and various Brooklyn neighborhoods, including [[Bedford-Stuyvesant]] and [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lizzi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KIHSS&quot; /&gt; Second were the White, educated and economically secure residents of certain areas of Manhattan.&lt;ref name=&quot;lizzi&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;KIHSS&quot; /&gt; Third were the Whites in the boroughs outside Manhattan who had a similar educational background and &quot;cosmopolitan&quot; attitude, namely residents of solidly middle-class neighborhoods, including Forest Hills and Kew Gardens in Queens and [[Brooklyn Heights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;lizzi&quot; /&gt; This third category included many traditionally Democratic Jewish Americans, who had been put off by Procaccino's conservatism.&lt;ref name=&quot;lizzi&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=LIZZI|first=MARIA C.|date=September 18, 2008|title='My Heart Is as Black as Yours': White Backlash, Racial Identity, and Italian American Stereotypes in New York City's 1969 Mayoral Campaign|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History |volume=27|issue=3|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/jaeh/27.3/lizzi.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Party switch and campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination==
In 1971, Lindsay and his wife cut ties with the Republican Party by registering with the Democratic Party. Lindsay said, &quot;In a sense, this step recognizes the failure of 20 years in progressive Republican politics. In another sense, it represents the renewed decision to fight for new national leadership.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1971/12295509436546-1/#title &quot;1971 Year in Review, UPI.com&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;  Lindsay then launched a brief and unsuccessful bid for the [[United_States_presidential_election, 1972#Democratic_Party_nomination|1972 Democratic presidential nomination]]. He attracted positive media attention and was a successful fundraiser. Lindsay did well in the early Arizona caucus, coming in second place&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F60F11FD3B591A7493C3AA178AD85F468785F9  Muskie Wins Arizona Vote As Lindsay Places Second], ''New York Times'', January 31, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; behind [[Edmund Muskie]] and ahead of eventual nominee [[George McGovern]]. Then in the March 14 Florida primary he placed a weak 5th place, behind [[George Wallace]], Muskie, [[Hubert Humphrey]], and [[Scoop Jackson]] (though he did edge out George McGovern).&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT March15&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F50615F63F591A7493C7A81788D85F468785F9|title=NIXON MARGIN BIG; Governor Captures 75 of 81 Delegates in Dramatic Victory Wallace Gets 42%,|last=WALDRON|first=MARTIN|date=March 15, 1972,|publisher=NY  Times|pages=1|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among his difficulties was New York City's worsening problems, which Lindsay was accused of neglecting; a band of protesters from [[Forest Hills, Queens]] who were opposed to his support for a low income housing project in their neighborhood, followed Lindsay around his aborted campaign itinerary to jeer and heckle him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F70D14FF3A5C1A7493CAAB1789D95F458785F9 LINDSAY 72' BASE CLOSED TO PRESS; Mayor's Supporters Work Behind Locked Doors], ''NY Times'', December 28, 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=FA0B15FF3F591A7493C4A81789D85F468785F9 LINDSAY ATTACKS NIXON OVER CRIME; Asserts He Is 'Soft' on Law Enforcementâ Mayor Is Heckled in Miami Beach], ''NY Times'', February 16, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; His poor showing in Florida effectively doomed his candidacy.  [[Meade Esposito]] called for Lindsay to end his campaign with the much-publicized comment &quot;I think the handwriting is on the wall; [[Come Back, Little Sheba (play)|Little Sheba]] better come home.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F10E13FD3A5C1A7493CAAB1788D85F468785F9 Esposito Advises Mayor to Quit Race], ''New York Times'', March 28, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; After a poor showing in the April 5 Wisconsin primary, Lindsay formally dropped out of the race.

==Assessment==
[[File:John Lindsay NYWTS 3.jpg|thumb|left|Lindsay at the first public hearing on proposed executive capital budget in February 1966]]
In a 1972 Gallup poll, 60% of New Yorkers felt Lindsay's administration was working poorly, nine percent rated it &quot;good,&quot; and not one person thought its performance excellent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Jeff Greenfield]] |title=3 Hail and farewell; Reading John Lindsay's face Lindsay |url=http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F20C14F83C54177388DDA00A94DF405B838BF1D3|quote= |work=New York Times |date=July 29, 1973 |accessdate=March 17, 2010 }} &lt;/ref&gt; By 1978, the New York Times called Lindsay &quot;an exile in his own city&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;exile&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/mem/archive/pdf?res=F00710FB385A13728DDDA10894D9405B888BF1D3|title=An Exile In His Own City; Lindsay|last=Stein|first=Howard|date=January 8, 1978, Sunday|work=New York Times|pages=The New York Times Magazine, Page SM3|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Lindsay's record remained controversial after he left politics.  Historian [[Fred Siegel]], calling Lindsay the worst New York City mayor of the 20th century, said &quot;Lindsay wasn't incompetent or foolish or corrupt, but he was actively destructive&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/15/nyregion/the-big-city-the-greatest-give-mayor-a-mirror.html|title=The Big City; The Greatest? Give Mayor A Mirror|author=[[John Tierney (journalist)|John Tierney]]|date=January 15, 2000|work=New York Times|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Stuart Weisman observed &quot;Lindsay's congressional career had taught him little of the need for subtle bureaucratic maneuvering, for understanding an opponent's self-interest, or for the great patience required in a sprawling government.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why Lindsay Failed as Mayor|last=Weisman|first=Steven R|date=April, 1972|publisher=The Washington Monthly|pages=50|accessdate=May 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Lindsay's budget aide Peter Goldmark told historian Vincent Cannato that the administration &quot;failed to come to grips with what a neighborhood is. We never realized that crime is something that happens to, and in, a community.&quot; Assistant Nancy Seifer said &quot;There was a whole world out there that nobody in City Hall knew anything about. . . If you didn't live on Central Park West, you were some kind of lesser being.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Cannato, 391&lt;/ref&gt; While many experts traced the city's mid-70's fiscal crisis to the Lindsay years, Lindsay disagreed, insisting that it may have come sooner if he had not imposed new taxes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot;/&gt;

An alternate assessment was made by journalist Robert McFadden who said that &quot;By 1973, his last year in office, Mr. Lindsay had become a more seasoned, pragmatic mayor.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt;  McFadden also credited him for reducing racial tensions, leading to the prevention of riots that plagued Detroit, Newark, Los Angeles, and other cities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Obit&quot; /&gt; Succeeded by Abraham Beame as Mayor, John Lindsay left the office of Mayor of New York on December 31, 1973. It was said that when he left, he broke down and cried over the fact he did not do more as Mayor.

==Later life==
After leaving office, Lindsay returned to the law, but remained in the public eye as a commentator and regular guest host for ABC's &quot;Good Morning America.&quot;  In 1975, Lindsay made a surprise appearance on ''[[The Tony Awards]]'' telecast in which he, along with a troupe of celebrity male suitors in tuxedos, sang &quot;Mame&quot; to [[Angela Lansbury]]. He presented the award for [[Tony Award for Best Direction of a Play|Best Director Of A Play]] to [[John Dexter]] for the play ''[[Equus (play)|Equus]]''.  Lindsay also tried his hand at acting, appearing in [[Otto Preminger]]'s ''[[Rosebud (film)|Rosebud]]'';&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0512245/bio&lt;/ref&gt;  the following year his novel, ''The Edge'', was published (Lindsay had earlier authored two non-fiction memoirs). Attempting a political comeback in 1980, Lindsay made a long-shot bid for the Democratic nomination for U.S. Senator from New York, and finished third.  He was also active in New York City charities, serving on the board of the Association for a Better New York, and as chairman of the Lincoln Center Theatre.  On his death the New York Times said he was credited with a significant role in the theatre's rejuvenation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/nyregion/john-v-lindsay-mayor-and-maverick-dies-at-79.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | title=John V. Lindsay, Mayor and Maverick, Dies at 79 | first=Robert D. | last=McFadden | date=December 21, 2000 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Medical bills from his Parkinson's Disease, heart attacks and stroke, depleted Lindsay's finances and he found himself without health insurance.  In 1996 Mayor [[Rudolph W. Giuliani]] appointed the former Mayor to two largely ceremonial posts to make him eligible for municipal health insurance coverage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9803E4D61739F930A35756C0A960958260&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=lindsay+giuliani+lawyer&amp;st=nyt Ailing Lindsay Is Given Posts To Get City Health Insurance], ''NY Times'', May 3, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; He and his wife Mary moved to a retirement community in [[Hilton Head Island, South Carolina]] in November 1999, where he died the next year at the age of seventy-nine of complications from [[pneumonia]] and [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Mcfadden&quot; /&gt;  His wife Mary died in 2004.

In 2000, Yale Law School created a fellowship program named in Lindsay's honor.   In 1998, a park in Brooklyn, Lindsay Triangle was named in his honor and in 2001, the East River Park was renamed in his memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/om/html/2001b/pr389-01.html Mayor Giuliani Signs Bill Renaming Manhattan's East River Park John V. Lindsay/East River Park]&lt;/ref&gt;  He is featured on a poster picture with Governor Rockefeller at the groundbreaking of the former [[World Trade Center]] in the city history section of the [[Museum of the City of New York]] at [[Fifth Avenue]] and 103rd Street. In the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, a Mitchell-Lama Development has been erroneously thought to be named after Mayor Lindsay (Lindsay Park). This development was actually named after Congressman [[George W. Lindsay]] (1865â1938)(no relation.)
