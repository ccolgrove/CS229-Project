The [[Character (arts)|fictional character]]s appearing in the [[manga]] and [[anime]] series ''[[xxxHolic]]'' were developed by [[Clamp (manga artists)|Clamp]], a group of four [[mangaka|manga artists]]. Taking place in a modern Japan, the series focuses on various [[supernatural]] themes, leading to various of the characters being spirits or mysterious creatures. Published at the same time of Clamp's ''[[Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle]]'' manga, ''xxxHolic'' often makes [[Fictional crossover|crossover]]s with it, leading to the appearances of various of its characters in the series.

The series' [[protagonist]] is [[#Kimihiro Watanuki|Kimihiro Watanuki]], a high school student plagued by [[yÅkai]] and [[ayakashi (monster)|ayakashi]], spirits with a strong attraction to him. When bothered by them, Watanuki accidentally enters into a shop that grants wish where he meets the witch [[#YÅ«ko Ichihara|YÅ«ko Ichihara]]. YÅ«ko decides to grant his wish of making his demons go away in exchange of having him work as her assistant in her shop. Working at YÅ«ko's shop, Watanuki comes to encounter various spirits as well as knowing more of his classmates [[#Shizuka DÅmeki|Shizuka DÅmeki]], a teenager who repels spirits and Watanuki dislikes, and [[#Himawari Kunogi|Himawari Kunogi]], Watanuki's crush who is said to give bad luck to people. Watanuki also meets various ghosts and other spiritual being that take the form of animals or people. Although Watanuki becomes happy with the new friendships he makes, he becomes concerned about YÅ«ko, promising he will try to grant her wish.

The characters from ''xxxHolic'' were designed by Clamp's members [[Mokona]] and [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] with some of their designs being inspired by [[Ukiyo-e]] art style. Positive critical reception has been given to the series' characters based on their interactions and personalities. The designs have also been well-received most notably in the manga, where Clamp's work was praised. On the other hand, the designs featured in the animated adaptations have received mixed criticism.
==Creation and conception==
As the artwork of ''xxxHolic'' is influenced by [[Ukiyo-e]] art style, it leads to the characters having longer limbs in various illustrations. However, Clamp pointed the Clamp also often uses one-eyed characters or people who lost their sight which is meant to express the feelings from them. This is also meant to serve as a connection with ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'', another Clamp's series which uses this method as well as the artwork influenced by Ukiyo-e.&lt;ref name=&quot;animexpointer&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |title=Anime Expo 15 Cosplay 2006 |publisher=John (Phoenix) Brown |date=January 11, 2009 |url=http://www.phoenixanime.com/ax06/page5.htm |accessdate=April 21, 2009 |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5unxRgAvf |archivedate=December 7, 2010 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series' female characters are designed by [[Mokona]] while [[Tsubaki Nekoi]] draws the male ones and all the spirits featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clamp |authorlink=Clamp (manga artists) |others=translanted and adapted by William Flanagan |title=The Official xxxHOLiC Guide |publisher=[[Del Rey Manga]] |year=2009|location=[[New York]] |pages=154â163 |isbn=978-0-345-51000-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters' names were made so that people would find different meanings to each of them.&lt;ref name=&quot;finalinter&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=CLAMP ï¼ãæ³åä»¥ä¸ã«å¤§å¤ã§ããã&quot;ÃÃÃHOLiC&quot;&quot;ãããµ&quot;ç°ä¾ã®ä¸¦è¡é£è¼7å¹´ãæ¯ãè¿ã|language=Japanese|publisher=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=March 5, 2011|url=http://mantan-web.jp/2011/03/05/20110305dog00m200014000c.html|trans_title=CLAMP: &quot;It was hard to imagine more &quot;ÃÃÃHOLiC&quot; &quot;Tsubasa&quot; looking back on an unprecedented 7 year simultaneous serialization|accessdate=March 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Main characters==
===Kimihiro Watanuki===
{{nihongo|Kimihiro Watanuki|åæä¸æ¥ åå°|Watanuki Kimihiro}} is a high school student plagued daily by spirits who are constantly attracted to him. After meeting [[#YÅ«ko Ichihara|YÅ«ko Ichihara]], she promises to remove this unwanted ability in exchange for working part-time in her shop until it equals the worth of his wish. He lives by himself due to his parents no longer being around, so he excels in cooking and cleaning, much to YÅ«ko's pleasure.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch1&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 1 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 1|isbn= 978-0-345-47058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch2&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 1 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 2|isbn= 978-0-345-47058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also sends him on various jobs that often have a spiritual nature. Watanuki is known for a having both a volatile and caring nature to him. While around [[#Himawari Kunogi|Himawari Kunogi]], he is very excited and speaks in a high-pitched voice,&lt;ref name=&quot;ch3&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 1 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 3|isbn= 978-0-345-47058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; while he expresses irritation while speaking to [[#Shizuka DÅmeki|Shizuka DÅmeki]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ch13&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 2 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 13|isbn= 978-0-345-47119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He generally gets enraged at the often insane requests of YÅ«ko, though he will pay close attention whenever she is serious with him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch13&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 8 |year= 2006|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 49|isbn= 978-0-345-48336-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watanuki is essentially an alternate self of the [[List of Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle characters#Tsubasa (Syaoran)|second Syaoran]] who appeared in the series, having been created to fill the gap left by Syaoran after he decided to turn back time and be imprisoned by the sorcerer [[Fei-Wang Reed]] as a payment. Watanuki became the child of Syaoran's parents, and fills all of the relationships Syaoran would have made.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch90&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 14 |year= 2009|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 90|isbn= 978-0-345-51843-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the series' start, Watanuki gave up the memories of his past in order to help YÅ«ko find Fei-Wang, and help Syaoran. As he then could not remember his parents, Watanuki developed a strong guilt, thinking his parents died due to his fault, and it led to the attraction of spirits.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch90&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch84&quot;/&gt;  

After YÅ«ko's death, Watanuki resolves to stay and take care of the shop until he sees her again.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch95&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 15 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 95|isbn= 978-0-345-52112-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to both stabilize the shop and break free of Fei-Wang's dying curse with the second Syaoran, Watanuki offers up the remainder of his &quot;existence&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;tsu233&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 28 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 233|isbn= 978-0-345-52164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Watanuki can no longer leave the shop. He becomes the new master of the shop and takes up YÅ«ko's role of granting wishes to those who come to the shop.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch96&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 16 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 96|isbn= 978-0-345-52412-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next several years, Watanuki's powers become stronger thanks to the fact he did not remove his ability to see spirits.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch101&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 16 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 101|isbn= 978-0-345-52412-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; His lifespan also increases and retains the appearance of a teenager for over a hundred years. Over a hundred years after taking over the shop, Watanuki's powers grow strong enough to allow him leave the shop, but decides to remain there.&lt;ref name=&quot;final&quot;/&gt;

===YÅ«ko Ichihara===
{{nihongo|YÅ«ko Ichihara|å£±å ä¾å­|Ichihara YÅ«ko}} is a woman who runs a shop that deals in granting wishes in exchange for something of equal value to the wish; sometimes this is referred to as a soul. She can take anything from a precious object to abstract concepts, such as love and luck in exchange.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch1&quot;/&gt; She usually displays an immature and free-spirited attitude, drinking sakÃ© at all hours of the day and forcing difficult tasks upon Watanuki.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch4&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 1 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 4|isbn= 978-0-345-47058-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While dealing with customers or giving Watanuki advice, she is much more stern and offers cryptic messages to warn him and others of impending danger. She constantly speaks of inevitability and how nothing is a coincidence.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch1&quot;/&gt;

YÅ«ko had a past relationship with the sorcerer [[Clow Reed]] and both created the two [[Mokona Modoki]] creatures in anticipation for the series' events.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch9&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 2 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 9|isbn= 978-0-345-47119-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; While she was on the verge of dying, Clow Reed accidentally used his powers to freeze time for her just by wishing for her to open her eyes. After that point, she opposes the sorcerer Fei-Wang Reed who controls the events happening in ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 9 |year= 2006|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 64|isbn= 978-0-345-48429-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of ''Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle'', YÅ«ko is revived by Fei-Wang and gives her life as a price to enable the clones of [[Syaoran (Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle)|Syaoran]] and [[Sakura (Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle)|Sakura]] be reborn as normal humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 27 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 215|isbn= 978-0-345-52071-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Volume 28 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapitre 220|isbn= 978-0-345-52164-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, YÅ«ko finds Watanuki and tells him her wish is or for him to continue existing just before her death as she is covered by shadows from the Dream World.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch95&quot;/&gt;

Over a hundred years later after her death and Watanuki has become the shop's owner, YÅ«ko appears as part of a dream she left to Watanuki, telling him he has stayed in the shop for a long time and now is able to leave it.&lt;ref name=&quot;final&quot;/&gt; In the ''Holic RÅ'' OVA, Watanuki receives a recorded tape from a girl. When Watanuki plays the tape, YÅ«ko's voice is heard saying &quot;I'm home,&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date = June 2010|title = xxxHolic RÅ|format = [[DVD]] |publisher = Kodansha}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{anime voices2|YÅ«ko|[[Sayaka Ohara]]|[[Colleen Clinkenbeard]]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;holicstaff&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;OVAengcast&quot;/&gt; YÅ«ko's character has well-received by Japanese readers of the series.

===Shizuka DÅmeki===
{{nihongo|Shizuka DÅmeki|ç¾ç®é¬¼ é|DÅmeki Shizuka}} is a schoolmate of Watanuki. He lives in a shrine owned by his late grandfather, [[#Haruka DÅmeki|Haruka DÅmeki]], a [[Shinto]] priest who taught DÅmeki about folklore and shinto practices during his childhood. However, despite his heritage, DÅmeki has a nearly null ability of seeing ghosts or spirits, though he can sense them, and he has a natural ability to exorcise them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch22&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 2 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 22|isbn= 978-0-345-47119-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is part of the school's [[kyÅ«dÅ]] club and often tops school competitions. DÅmeki barely speaks unless explaining folklore or asking Watanuki various of his meals which infuriates him.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch19&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 3 |year= 2004|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 19|isbn= 978-0-345-47181-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{anime voices2|DÅmeki|[[Kazuya Nakai]]|[[J. Michael Tatum]]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;holicstaff&quot;/&gt;

Despite Watanuki's hatred for him, YÅ«ko often makes DÅmeki join Watanuki in his jobs as his ability to exorcise spirits annulate the attraction that Watanuki has towards them.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch22&quot;/&gt; Utilizing YÅ«ko's shop, DÅmeki gives Watanuki half of his eye after he loses his right eye's vision to the spirits, which allows DÅmeki to see and experience what Watanuki goes through.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch49&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 8 |year= 2006|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 49|isbn= 978-0-345-48336-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch50&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 8 |year= 2006|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 50|isbn= 978-0-345-48336-2  }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also gives Watanuki a large amount of his blood, which YÅ«ko states is changing their personalities. YÅ«ko gives Domeki a magic egg obtained by Sakura while working for her, however DÅmeki does not know what it does or when he should use it.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch67&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 11 |year= 2008|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 68|isbn= 978-0-345-50163-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch96&quot;/&gt;

Four years after YÅ«ko's death, DÅmeki is a university student studying ancient history and often visits Watanuki in the shop. Because Watanuki cannot leave the shop, Domeki provides assistance both with Watanuki's work and by providing essentials, such as food.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch97&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 16 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 97|isbn= 978-0-345-52412-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; After six more years, DÅmeki graduates and has become an assistant to one of his professors at the university.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch106&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 18 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Kodansha]] |chapter=Chapter 106|isbn= 978-4-06-375979-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''xxxHolic RÅ Adayume'' OVA it is revealed that DÅmeki is engaged with [[#Kohane Tsuyuri|Kohane Tsuyuri]], having delivered his wedding's invitation to Watanuki.&lt;ref name=&quot;adayum&quot;&gt;{{cite video |date = March 2011|title = xxxHolic RÅ Adayume|format = [[DVD]] |publisher = Kodansha}}&lt;/ref&gt; After it has been over a hundred years since Watanuki inherited the shop, DÅmeki's great grandson is Watanuki's new assistant, keeping the egg YÅ«ko gave to DÅmeki.&lt;ref name=&quot;final&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 19 |year= 2011|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Kodansha]]|isbn= 978-4-06-376039-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Himawari Kunogi===
{{nihongo|Himawari Kunogi|ä¹è» èµ|Kunogi Himawari}} is Watanuki's [[love interest]] and classmate. She has a cheerful attitude and is very friendly around Watanuki and DÅmeki.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ch13&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 8 |year= 2006|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 49|isbn= 978-0-345-48336-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the fact that Watanuki is very open in showing his feelings and admiration for her, she seems very oblivious to the fact that he likes her. Watanuki always thinks that DÅmeki is more favored. Watanuki often invited her to join him for various outings, but Himawari characteristically has a prior engagement, comically and inadvertently leaving Watanuki with DÅmeki. {{anime voices2|Himawari|[[Shizuka ItÅ]]|[[Cherami Leigh]]}}&lt;ref name=&quot;holicstaff&quot;/&gt;

Watanuki originally believes that she is his &quot;goddess of good luck&quot;, though YÅ«ko states the opposite, often leaving cryptic statements about Himawari's true nature.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch3&quot;/&gt; It is eventually revealed that Himawari emanates misfortune that affects everyone around her except her parents, as they brought her into the world, and those with spiritual abilities, such as DÅmeki and YÅ«ko.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch60&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 10 |year= 2008|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 60|isbn= 978-0-345-49683-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her luck causes Watanuki fall from a second story window and is severely cut by the shattered window glass, nearly dying.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch62&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 10 |year= 2008|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 62|isbn= 978-0-345-49683-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; YÅ«ko has them rush Watanuki to her shop, where they manage to save his life.

She is the only one of the main cast not seen visiting Watanuki after he inherits the shop. She is attending a university far away from Watanuki's store.  Because her natural misfortune causes problems with the shop's magic, she has promised only to enter the shop once a year, always on Watanuki's birthday, though she calls occasionally. Himawari is married to a businessman whose identity is unknown.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch104&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 17 |year= 2010|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Kodansha]] |chapter=Chapter 104|isbn= 978-0-345-53071-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kohane Tsuyuri===
{{nihongo|Kohane Tsuyuri|äºæä¸æ¥å°ç¾½|Tsuyuri Kohane}} is a young girl known publicly as a [[child prodigy]], [[Mediumship|medium]] and [[exorcist]], having been featured on many paranormal-based TV shows.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch55&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 9 |year= 2008|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 55|isbn= 978-0-345-49639-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After first developing her powers, she helped her mother learn that her father was having an affair, causing a drastic change in her mother's personality. She soon stopped touching Kohane, does not refer to her by name, takes away any objects or food not considered &quot;pure&quot;, and cuts off all contact with other people. Nevertheless, Kohane states her mother's treatment is her fault for developing her powers.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch83&quot;&gt;{{cite book |title= xxxHolic, Volume 13 |year= 2009|author=Clamp |publisher= [[Del Rey Manga]] |chapter=Chapter 83|isbn= 978-0-345-50566-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; She focuses on having Kohane on as many television shows as possible, and buys large amounts of extravagant items. This treatment causes Kohane to have a quiet and lonely demeanor, though she attempts to stay strong for her mother's sake, blaming everything on herself.&lt;ref name=&quot;ch55&quot;/&gt; {{anime voices2|Kohane|[[Rina Hidaka]]}}
