{{about|the current day radio station|the first station which held these calls from 1960-1982|WXPK}}

'''WRNW''' is a [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] [[frequency modulation|FM]] [[radio station]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] which is located on the 97.3 frequency and is branded as &quot;Radio Now&quot;.  The station is owned and operated by [[Clear Channel Communications]].

==History==
===Early years===
The original call sign of this frequency was '''WISN-FM''', to match [[WISN (AM)|its AM sister station]]. WISN-FM had been playing an automated [[beautiful music]] format until 1978. 

In January 1978, the station flipped to [[album-oriented rock]] as '''WLPX''', using consultant [[Lee Abrams]]' &quot;SuperStars&quot; format.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=9yMEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT29&amp;dq=WLPX&amp;pg=PT29#v=onepage&amp;q=WLPX&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The station became an immediate success in the ratings, even pushing rival [[WJMR-FM|WZMF]] to tighten their format, and later drop it altogether for beautiful music. WLPX also sponsored future [[NASCAR]] driver [[Alan Kulwicki]] on local racetracks. 

In the summer of 1983, WLPX abruptly switched to [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]], first as 97X, then shortly after as '''WBTT''' (B97).

===Light 97.3===
Light [[adult contemporary]] became the format in April 1985 as &quot;Light 97.3&quot; with the '''WLTQ''' call sign.&lt;ref&gt;http://books.google.com/books?id=CyQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PT11&amp;dq=WLPX&amp;pg=PT11#v=onepage&amp;q=WLPX&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The station's DJ's, before the 1997 sale of WLTQ and WISN Radio from [[Hearst Communications]] to [[Clear Channel]], often appeared on [[WISN-TV]] in various roles, including hosting telethon and remote programming, and programs involving the [[Wisconsin Lottery]] in order to keep the line between the Channel 12 newsroom and other station operations clear from impropriety.

WLTQ featured the popular syndicated ''[[Delilah Rene|Delilah]]'' program in the evening shift. 

In 2004 Clear Channel sensed some fatigue from listeners dissatisfied with the playlists of [[WKLH]] and [[WHQG|WLZR]], long the FM market leaders and both owned by the competing [[Saga Communications]] and decided to test if would be appropriate to introduce a new spin on the [[classic rock]] format in the market. They first tweaked their [[oldies]] station, [[WRIT]] to better take on WKLH and used those results to fine-tune what they saw as a station which could compete with the Saga operations.

WLTQ was in a position where their ratings were fading as the station's AC format became less popular in the market, likely due to the station unable to stretch out of format very much due to their longtime marketing as a station perfect for an office setting when most other adult contemporary began airing music which went beyond the traditional AC playlist and might not be appropriate for the office. &quot;Office station&quot; competitor [[WLWK-FM|WKTI]] began to expand their playlist further and this contributed to a further slide in &quot;Light 97&quot;'s ratings. 

===97.3 The Brew===
With not much hope of getting new listeners, Clear Channel began [[Stunting (broadcasting)|stunting]] on WLTQ at midday on September 17, airing a continuous loop of songs featuring the words &quot;air&quot; and &quot;America&quot;, along with sound bites of [[Air America Radio]] host [[Al Franken]] and a suggestion that the following Monday (September 20), &quot;You'll be talking!&quot;  This was a ruse, however, designed to lead the station's competitors (and perhaps listeners) into thinking that it would change to a [[Progressive talk|progressive talk format]], which had recently been added to a Clear Channel station in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]] ([[WXXM]]).  On Monday morning, September 20, the real format revealed itself, and the [[1980s in music|80s-based]] [[classic rock]] format of &quot;The Brew&quot; was born, eventually changing their calls to '''WQBW'''.

&quot;The Brew's&quot; initial slogan was &quot;Rock of the '80s and More&quot;, and the new station experienced notable ratings success out of the gate, as they quickly became the top FM station in Milwaukee, second only to longtime market leader [[WTMJ (AM)|WTMJ]] overall. &quot;The Brew&quot; was effective in taking away listeners from WKLH, and the station's heavy dose of 1980s-era hard rock bands helped steal highly desired older listeners away from WLZR after their popular ''[[Bob and Brian]]'' morning show signed off for the day. 

WKLH tweaked their on-air imaging in response, and WLZR did a complete makeover, dropping much of the newer [[active rock|hard rock]], expanding the playlist by adding [[classic rock]] titles, and rechristening the station as &quot;102.9 The Hog&quot; ([[WHQG]]). WHQG was also a success from the start, and along with WKLH, stole listeners back from &quot;The Brew.&quot; The situation was helped as well by the heavy repetition of &quot;The Brew's&quot; tight playlist.  As a result, WQBW's ratings were virtually cut in half.

In response, &quot;The Brew&quot; went in a slightly different direction adding more 1980s [[pop music]] from artists like [[Richard Marx]] and more recent songs from bands such as [[Nickleback]] and [[Carlos Santana|Santana]], as the station went in a slight [[adult hits]] direction. The slogan changed to &quot;The Biggest Variety of Rock Hits&quot;. Their television and on [[billboard (advertising)|billboard]] advertising featured an obese shirtless man named &quot;Dancin' Kevin&quot;, inspired by commercials for [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]]'s [[WLUP]] &quot;97.9 The Loop&quot; from the 1980s.

&quot;The Brew's&quot; morning show was originally helmed by the duo of Sean Lynch and Joanie Meyers, until the two were dropped from the station in September 2008 and replaced by the &quot;Connie &amp; Fish&quot; show, imported from Clear Channel's [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40]]-formatted station in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]], [[WZEE]] &quot;Z104&quot;.  Based at WQBW, &quot;Connie &amp; Fish&quot; were heard simultaneously on &quot;The Brew&quot; and &quot;Z104&quot;, with the stations inserting their own separate playlists during the music breaks. The rest of &quot;The Brew's&quot; personalities appeared on via [[voicetracking]] from other markets.

However in December 2008, WKTI would decide to also adopt an [[adult hits]] format, changing over to a semi-automated format as &quot;The Lake&quot; under the new calls [[WLWK]]. This further eroded WQBW's audience, and with the market overwhelmed by four stations playing pop music from the 70's and 80's, The Brew ended up as the lower-rated among the four stations for the format it originated within the market.

===97-3 Radio Now===
At 9 AM on May 28, 2010, immediately following the Connie &amp; Fish morning program, the station ended &quot;The Brew&quot; format abruptly. It converted to a new [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] format with the branding &quot;97-3 Radio Now&quot;. The move was made quickly to preempt an expected format change by rival station [[WZBK-FM|WJZX]] (106.9). A day earlier, [[WZBK-FM|WJZX]] ended its smooth jazz format and began a stunt format known as &quot;Tiger Radio.&quot; The station's new format was likely to be [[Rhythmic contemporary|Rhythmic Top 40]] under the new callsign WNQW, which prompted Clear Channel to act quickly and claim the &quot;Now&quot; name and brand before WJZX owner [[Saga Communications]] could claim it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/entertainment/95130799.html &quot;Smooth Jazz, Brew and Radio Now Recap&quot;], [[Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel]] (May 28, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Radio Now had a DJ-free format, but eventually brought back the morning show, though the title changed to &quot;Connie and Curtis&quot; after &quot;Fish&quot; Calloway's departure a week after the format change.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channel3000.com/entertainment/23786948/detail.html&lt;/ref&gt; On July 26, the station began to have DJ's, again with voicetracking from other stations.

On June 10, 2010, the 97.3 [[call letters]] were officially changed to '''WRNW'''. These calls had previously been used from 1960 until 1982 for [[WXPK]] in the [[New York City]] suburb of [[Briarcliff Manor, New York|Briarcliff Manor]], the station where [[Howard Stern]] first came to the broadcasting industry.

WRNW's format change gives longtime top 40 powerhouse [[WXSS]] &quot;103.7 Kiss FM&quot; its first competition since its closest rival, adult Top 40 [[WKTI]], converted to an adult hits format as [[WLWK]] &quot;Lake FM&quot; in late 2008. WRNW's Top 40 musical direction favors a pop/rock approach, as it plays less Rhythmic/Hip-Hop than WXSS and most other large market [[Contemporary hit radio|Top 40 (CHR)]] stations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radio-info.com/programming/chrtop-40/punch-wars-5-milwaukees-new-chr-battle |title=Punch Wars #5 â Milwaukee's New CHR Battle |last=Ross |first=Sean |date=June 10, 2010 |work=Radio-Info.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; This musical direction both differentiates the station from [[WXSS]] and protects WRNW's dominant rhythmic [[Urban contemporary|Urban]] sister station, [[WKKV]].

==Current On-Air Lineup==

WRNW currently features Connie and Curtis in morning drive, [[simulcast]] with sister station [[WZEE]] Madison. The station also features Katie Sommers in middays, Riggs in afternoon drive and Jesse Mitchell evenings.

==WRNW-HD2==
On April 25, 2006, Clear Channel announced that WQBW's HD2 subchannel will carry ''Radio Radio'' from their Format Lab, a format focusing on classic [[modern rock]] hits.  It was later replaced by the ''Rock Nation'' feed from Format Lab, which features [[active rock]].

On February 28, 2011, the format of WRNW-HD2 changed to another national Clear Channel [[iHeartRadio]] feed called &quot;Spin Cycle,&quot; featuring remixed hit songs presented in a continuous mixshow format. Mixers include DJ Goofy WhiteKid and VJ Kidd Leow.
