'''Old-time photography''', also known as '''antique and amusement photography''', is a genre of novelty [[photography]].

Old-time photography allows consumers to pose as if for an antique photo in costumes and props from a particular period, sometimes printed in [[sepia tone]] to give the photo a vintage look.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;&gt;{{cite book

Popular themes include the [[American Old West|Old West]], the [[Victorian era]], or the [[Roaring Twenties]].

Some studios specialize in the genre, and others ply their trade at festivals and historical reenactment events. It is a popular family activity at [[amusement parks]] and other tourist destinations, mostly in the United States. Many of these old-time photography studios are located in historic cities that naturally draw visitors looking to experience how people lived in past eras. Some [[photo booth]]s will do sepia toned prints for a similar look.

Photographers in the genre originally used specialized [[Agfa]] and later [[Polaroid Corporation|Polaroid]] equipment, but have largely moved to [[digital photography]] along with the industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;Burgess&quot;/&gt;
