'''WKBT-DT''' is a [[television station]] owned and operated by [[Morgan Murphy Media]] and serving West Central [[Wisconsin]], including [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] (its [[city of license]]) and [[Eau Claire, Wisconsin|Eau Claire]].  The station is primarily affiliated with [[CBS]] and airs programming from [[MyNetworkTV]] on its [[digital subchannel]].

==History==
[[File:WKBTStudios.jpg|thumb|right|Studios of WKBT-DT]]WKBT launched on August 8, 1954 as sister station to WKBH, a radio station known today as as [[WIZM (AM)|WIZM]]. (The &quot;T,&quot; for &quot;television,&quot; replaced the &quot;H&quot; in the [[call sign]] to differentiate the stations.)  WKBT carried dual affiliation with [[CBS]] and [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], a set-up that continued until 1970, when WKBT became solely a CBS affiliate.  WKBT also briefly had secondary affiliations with DuMont (until 1956) and NBC (until 1958).&lt;ref&gt;[http://radioinsight.com/boards/index.php?t=tree&amp;th=8267&amp;start=0&amp;S=6c409f4aeab9555b176b62f83b344f58]&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 16th, 1965, during the worst of the famous 1965 flood, the downtown [[La Crosse, Wisconsin|La Crosse]] building that housed both WKBT and WKBH fell victim to fire; WKBT then rebuilt its current building on the same site.

In the 1970s, WKBT was sold to Harold F. Gross, a businessman from [[Lansing, Michigan]] who owned [[WJIM (AM)|WJIM-AM]]-[[WJIM-FM|FM]]-TV in that city.  WKBT and WJIM-TV were sold in the mid-1980s to Unicom Inc, a unit of [[Forstmann Little &amp; Company|Forstmann Little]], d.b.a. Backe Communications, following a licensing dispute involving WJIM-TV (which changed its call letters to [[WLNS-TV]]).  Unicom's ownership of the station was short-lived as in 1986 it sold WLNS and WKBT to [[Young Broadcasting]]. 

In March 2000, Young sold WKBT to Morgan Murphy Stations, whose QueenB Television subsidiary (now [[Morgan Murphy Media]]) became the licensee for the station.

WKBT-DT went on the air with digital broadcasting on channel 41 (UHF) on March 28, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;

WKBT-DT launched digital subchannel 8.2, ''UPN La Crosse/Eau Claire'', on Monday January 30, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3652/is_200603/ai_n17179469/&lt;/ref&gt;  (Rival station [[KQEG-CA]] had dropped its affiliation with [[UPN]] at the end of the previous week.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lacrossetribune.com/news/article_0b5326c6-5c9a-5f06-8f04-3f5914934aa3.html&lt;/ref&gt;)

Beginning September 5, 2006, with the demise of UPN, WKBT-DT2 subchannel 8.2 became an affiliate of the new [[MyNetworkTV]].

On the afternoon of Tuesday, February 17, 2009, WKBT-TV discontinued analog broadcasting on channel 8 (VHF), and the digital WKBT-DT signal was transitioned from channel 41 (UHF) to channel 8 (VHF), completing the station's digital broadcast transition.

In the summer of 2011, WKBT became the first station in the La Crosse/Eau Claire [[DMA]] to air newscasts in high definition.

==MyNetworkTV La Crosse/Eau Claire==
[[MyNetworkTV]] La Crosse/Eau Claire is slowly being developed.  It carries syndicated shows such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'', and programming with local interest, such as ''Racing Rewind'' (a show about weekly races at the La Crosse Fairgrounds Speedway), and a few one-time airings of local events. There is a newscast called ''My News at Nine'' shown weekdays at 9 pm. In 2009 WKBT stopped making ''My NewsChannel 8 at Nine'' and reaires the 5 pm news.

On the early snowy morning February 25, 2007, the channel aired a 2 hour 30 minute live newscast, to keep people informed of a snowfall that brought over 28 inches of snow to the area.

==Transmitter==

WKBT's transmitter is located in [[Galesville, Wisconsin]], about 30 miles north of the actual station in order to provide their signal to the entire market - it also serves as the CBS affiliate for the [[Chippewa Valley]].

If put up next to Chicago's [[Willis Tower]] (formerly known as the Sears Tower), the WKBT transmitter would surpass the upper roof and fall just about 100 feet short of the highest antenna on top.
