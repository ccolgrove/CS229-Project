The Waylon Jennings Boulevard is named in his honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jennings |first= Waylon |coauthors= Lenny Kaye|title= [[Waylon Jennings: An Autobiography]] |publisher= [[Grand Central Publishing]] |year= 1996 |month= September |isbn= 9780446518659}}&lt;/ref&gt; A celebration of Jennings' 73rd birthday was held on June 18, 2010, to raise funds for the Lands Duggan House Museum in Littlefield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/local-news/2010-06-11/fundraisers-be-held-museum|title=Barn dance to support Littlefield house museum and celebrate Waylon's birthday|publisher=''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', June 11, 2010|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The world's tallest [[windmill]] was said to be below Yellow Houses Bluff at nearby Yellow House Ranch from the early 1900s until 1926, when the {{convert|128|ft|m|adj=on}}-high structure was blown over.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Yellow House Ranch | publisher=Texas State Historical Association | work=The Handbook of Texas Online | url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/YY/apy1.html |accessdate=2010-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unsolved murder case==
On October 26, 1943, Littlefield was shocked by the murder of [[physician]] Roy Hunt and his wife, the former Mae Frank. Hunt, a [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]] native, graduated from the [[University of Texas Medical Branch|University of Texas Medical School at Galveston]] and opened the Littlefield Clinic in 1937. While Dr. Hunt died of a gunshot wound, Mrs. Hunt was bludgeoned to death by a gun. Their bodies, bound together, were found in bed by the couple's five-year-old daughter, who ran screaming to neighbors for help. An estimated 1,500 mourners attended the funerals in the First [[Methodist]] Church of Littlefield, which seated only 300. Some 1,200 hence stood outside the overflowing church to pay respects. A $15,000 reward was offered, and [[Governor of Texas|Governor]] [[Coke R. Stevenson]] took a personal interest in the case.&lt;ref name=wtha&gt;Christena Stephens of [[Sundown, Texas|Sundown]], Texas, &quot;The Hunt Murders in Littlefield, Texas, 1943&quot;, Annual meeting, [[West Texas Historical Association]], [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]], Texas, April 3, 2009; The paper was published under the title  &quot;Double Murder in a Small West Texas Town&quot; in the ''[[West Texas Historical Association]] Year Book''.&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation revealed that Dr. Hunt had also been shot twice in May 1942 by Dr. W.R. Newton, a former medical school classmate who claimed that Hunt was showing an interest in Newton's wife, Ruth. Another suspect, Jim Clyde Thomas, was gunned down in a personal disagreement on August 22, 1951, in [[Durant, Oklahoma|Durant]], [[Oklahoma]]. The murders, called the &quot;most heinous on the Texas [[South Plains]]&quot;, hence remain unsolved. The Hunts are interred at the City of Lubbock Cemetery. Their two young daughters were reared by Mrs. Hunt's sister.&lt;ref name=wtha/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christena Stephens is also writing a book on the Hunt murders.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Clovis Road - The Dr. Roy Hunt Murder - Littlefield, Texas 1942 - 1943'' was written in 2009 by Dana Middlebrooks Samuelson and Robert Samuelson, M.D. about the Hunt murders. Jerry Scott Hughes wrote the foreword; the book is dedicated to Judge Harold LaFont and his son, Bill LaFont. Christena Stephens of the Llano Estacado Heritage Foundation is also writing a book on the Hunt case. At a time when [[forensic science]] was hardly known in Texas, Stephens has uncovered clues to solving the case, including tire tracks and black tennis shoes.&lt;ref&gt;Christena Stephens, &quot;Catching a Criminal in Early West Texas,&quot; [[West Texas Historical Association]], annual meeting, April 1, 2011, Lubbock, Texas&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ralph Elmer Maurer''' (November 15, 1907&amp;mdash;February 23, 2007) was a [[physician]] and [[surgeon]], with a speciality in [[orthopedics]], who practiced in Littlefield from 1945 until his retirement in 1993. Maurer was born in Zborov, now part of the [[Ukraine]], to a businessman-landowning father. The senior Maurer, concerned about political turmoil in what was then Austria-Hungary, immigrated alone to the United States in 1913. He intended to bring his family to the United States the next year, but [[World War I]] broke out in Europe, The Maurer family was not able to join the elder Maurer, who lived in [[New York City]], until 1920.&lt;ref name=maurer&gt;Obituary of Ralph E. Maurer, ''[[Lubbock Avalanche-Journal]]'', February 25, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Maurer's boyhood years corresponded with the Great War. In late 1915, German and Austrian armies forced the Russian army to withdraw to a line near Zborov. Maurer remembered having seen the Russians dig defensive trenches through his family's land. He and his brother played in the trenches and once constructed a slingshot and hurled rocks at Russian soldiers. After the war, the family left by wagon for the nearest railroad line, having reached [[Rotterdam]] in the [[Netherlands]], where they boarded a [[steamship]] and arrived in New York City in August 1920 to reunite with the father.&lt;ref name=maurer/&gt;

Maurer was then twelve years of age and spoke no English. He learned the language quickly in school and attended DeWitt Clinton High School, named for the former New York governor and father of the Erie Canal. He then attended [[New York University]] and in 1937 earned his [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] degree from the [[University of Berne]] in [[Switzerland]]. Maurer, who was of [[Austro-Hungarian]] ethnicity, was inducted as a captain into the [[United States Army]] Medical Service and participated in the [[North African Campaign]], the invasion of [[Italy]], and the battle of [[Anzio]]. His military tenure introduced him to new orthopedic techniques learned from a [[Germany|German]] surgeon in a captured field [[hospital]]. He applied this knowledge to improving the surgical care of Allied soldiers and his subsequent patients in Littlefield. On leaving the military, Maurer accepted a position at the Payne-Shotwell Hospital. He recalled having arrived in Littlefield on the last day of 1945 during a blinding [[Dust storm|sandstorm]].&lt;ref name=maurer/&gt;

Maurer was married to the former Ethel Virginia Tweedy of [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], [[Virginia (U.S. state)|Virginia]]. He died of a sudden illness at the age of ninety-nine. In addition to his wife, he was survived by two sons and two daughters. Another son, Dr. Ralph Gerald Maurer (1943â2006) preceded him in death by nine months. &lt;ref name=maurer/&gt;

'''Flannery Lamar Newton''' (January 14, 1914&amp;mdash;June 26, 2009) was a Littlefield businessman and civic leader who was born in [[Rule, Texas|Rule]] in [[Haskell County, Texas|Haskell County]] and reared near [[Anton, Texas|Anton]] in [[Hockley County, Texas|Hockley County]]. From 1933-1940, he was an independent [[poultry]] processor. Thereafter, he was a machinist at the former [[Reese Air Force Base]] in Lubbock. From 1945-1995, he and his wife, Verna Mae &quot;Mary&quot; Newton, owned the [[State Farm Insurance]] agency in Littlefield, In 1951, Newton was recognized for having sold the most [[automobile]] policies in a single day in the history of State Farm. The couple also operated Newton's Ladies' Apparel from 1968-1981. Newton was a member of the Lion's Club for sixty-five years. He was active in the First [[United Methodist]] Church. He also served on the Littlefeld School Board. In addition to his wife, he was survived by a son, Alan Newton of Littlefield. Another son, Roger Newton, died in 2003. Interment was at the Anton Cemetery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/070109/obi_457036103.shtml|title=Obituary of Flannery L. Newton|publisher=''Lubbock Avalanche-Journal|accessdate=July 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James Edwin Shotwell''' (August 14, 1920 - August 2008) was a Littlefield [[dentist]], a captain in the [[United States Air Force]], and a former member of the Littlefield City Council. A native of [[Jacksonville, Texas|Jacksonville]], Texas, and a graduate of the [[Loyola University New Orleans|Loyola University]] Dental School in [[New Orleans]], he was an active member of [[Rotary International]] and the United Methodist Church. Shotwell is interred at Resthaven Cemetery in Lubbock.&lt;ref&gt;http://lubbockonline.com/stories/081808/obi_319880553.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;
