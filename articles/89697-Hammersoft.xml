'''William Wayne McMillan Rogers III'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/99/Wayne-Rogers.html |title=Wayne Rogers Biography (1933-) |publisher=Filmreference.com |date=1933-04-07 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born April 7, 1933) is an [[United States|American]] [[film]] and [[television]] [[actor]], best known for playing the role of [[Trapper John McIntyre|'Trapper John' McIntyre]] in the [[United States|U.S.]] television series, ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''.

He is a regular panel member on the [[Fox News Channel]] stock investment television program ''[[Cashin' In]]'', as a result of having built a highly successful and lucrative second career as an investor, investment strategist and advisor, and money manager.

== Life and career ==
The son of a [[Rhodes Scholar]], Rogers was born in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. He attended [[Ramsay High School (Birmingham, Alabama)|Ramsay High School]] in Birmingham and is a graduate of The [[Webb School (Bell Buckle, Tennessee)|Webb School]] in [[Bell Buckle, Tennessee]]. He later graduated from [[Princeton University]] with a history degree in 1954, where he was a member of the [[Princeton Triangle Club]], the Eating Club [[Tiger Inn]], and served in the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] before becoming an actor.

Prior to the role of 'Trapper John', Rogers appeared on television in various roles in both dramas and sitcoms such as ''[[The Invaders]]'', ''[[The F.B.I. (TV series)|The F.B.I.]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.]]'', ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'', and had a small supporting role in the 1967 movie ''[[Cool Hand Luke]]''. He had also been a co-star with [[Robert Bray]] and [[Richard Eyer]] in the western series ''[[Stagecoach West (TV series)|Stagecoach West]]'', a [[Four Star Television]] production on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] from 1960â1961. In 1959 he played Slim Davis on the [[soap opera]] ''[[Search for Tomorrow]]''. Rogers also played a role in ''[[Odds Against Tomorrow]]'' which was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] in 1960 as Best Film Promoting International Understanding.

=== ''M*A*S*H'' (1972â1975) ===
When Rogers was approached for ''M*A*S*H'', he planned to audition as Hawkeye Pierce. However, he found the character too cynical and asked to screen test as 'Trapper John,' whose outlook was brighter. Rogers was told that Trapper and Hawkeye would have equal importance as characters. This changed after [[Alan Alda]], whose acting career and rÃ©sumÃ© up to that point had outshone that of Rogers, was cast as Hawkeye, and proved to be more popular with the audience. Rogers did, however, still enjoy working with Alda and the rest of cast as a whole (Alda and Rogers quickly became close friends), but eventually chafed that the writers were devoting the show's best humorous and dramatic moments to Alda.

When the writers took the liberty of making Hawkeye a [[thoracic surgery|thoracic surgeon]] in the episode &quot;[[Dear Dad]]&quot; (December 17, 1972) even though Trapper was the unit's only thoracic surgeon in the movie and the novel, Rogers felt Trapper was stripped of his credentials.

On the ''M*A*S*H* 30th Anniversary Reunion Television Special'' aired by Fox-TV in 2002, Rogers once spoke on the differences between the &quot;Hawkeye&quot; and &quot;Trapper&quot; characters, &quot;Alan (Alda) and I both used to discuss ways on how to distinguish the differences between the two characters as to where there would be a variance... my character (Trapper John McIntyre) was a little more impulsive (than Hawkeye)&quot;.

Rogers considerably reduced his Alabama accent for the character of Trapper.&lt;ref&gt;Comments made by Rogers on ''[[The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded [[Elliott Gould]], who had played the character in the [[Robert Altman]] movie [[MASH (film)|''MASH'']], and was himself succeeded by [[Pernell Roberts]] on the ''M*A*S*H'' [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] ''[[Trapper John, M.D.]]''.

=== Departure from ''M*A*S*H'' ===
After three seasons, Rogers grew weary of the Trapper character being treated as more of a [[sidekick]] than an equal to Hawkeye, and decided to leave the show (as had [[McLean Stevenson]], who had played Lt. Colonel Blake).

=== ''House Calls'' (1979â1982) and other roles ===
Later he appeared as a Federal agent in the critically acclaimed 1975 NBC-TV movie ''[[Attack on Terror: The FBI vs. the Ku Klux Klan]]'', and as [[civil rights]] attorney [[Morris Dees]] in 1996's ''[[Ghosts of Mississippi]]''. He also starred in the short-lived but critically lauded 1976 period detective series ''[[City of Angels (1976 series)|City of Angels]]'' and the 1979â1982 CBS series ''[[House Calls (TV series)|House Calls]]'', first with [[Lynn Redgrave]], and then later with actress [[Sharon Gless]], who went on to co-star in the CBS-TV crime drama series ''[[Cagney and Lacey]]'' with actress [[Tyne Daly]]. Rogers also appeared in the 80's miniseries [[Chiefs (TV miniseries)]].

Rogers then guest-starred five times on CBS's ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]''. He has served as an [[executive producer]] and producer in both [[television producer|television]] and [[film producer|film]], a [[screenwriter]], and a [[television director|director]]. In addition, he has achieved some recognition as an investor, appearing frequently on [[Fox News Channel]] business shows. He also starred in ''Race Against the Harvest.''

He also starred in the movie ''The Gig'' (1985), alongside [[Cleavon Little]], as a jazz musician-hobbyist whose group has an opportunity to play a Catskills resort and must confront failure. Also in 1985 he starred opposite [[Barbara Eden]] in the televised reunion movie ''[[I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later]]'' based on the 60's television sitcom ''[[I Dream of Jeannie]]''. Rogers took on the role of Major Tony Nelson which was originally portrayed by [[Larry Hagman]] (of the CBS TV series ''[[Dallas (TV series)|Dallas]]'' fame) in the TV series when Hagman was unavailable to reprise the character he had originated. In 1986, Rogers  hosted the short-lived CBS television series ''[[High Risk (TV series)|''High Risk'']]''.

=== Fox News's ''Cashin' In'' ===
Rogers, who began to test the stock and real estate markets during his tenure as a ''M*A*S*H'' cast member, appears regularly as a panel member on the ''[[Fox Business Network]]'' cable TV stocks investment/stocks news program ''[[Cashin' In]]'', hosted by ''[[Fox News]]'' anchor [[Cheryl Casone]]. In August 2006, Rogers was elected to the Board of Directors of Intertechnology, Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;
