The '''University of Northern British Columbia''' (UNBC) is a small, primarily undergraduate [[university]] whose main [[campus]] is in [[Prince George, British Columbia|Prince George]], [[British Columbia]].  UNBC also has regional campuses in the northern British Columbia cities of [[Prince Rupert, British Columbia|Prince Rupert]], [[Terrace, British Columbia|Terrace]], [[Quesnel, British Columbia|Quesnel]], and [[Fort St. John, British Columbia|Fort St. John]]. The enabling legislation is the ''University Act.'' &lt;ref&gt;http://www.qp.gov.bc.ca/statreg/stat/U/96468_01.htm ''University Act''&lt;/ref&gt;  4177 students were enrolled at UNBC in the 2007-2008 academic year.&lt;ref name=&quot;studentstats&quot;&gt;[http://www.unbc.ca/about/guide/students.html UNBC - Facts &amp; Statistics: Our Students]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, the University obtained the [[trademark]] for &quot;Canada's Green University&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;green&quot;&gt;[http://www.unbc.ca/green/ UNBC - Canada's Green University]&lt;/ref&gt; The university press, The Over the Edge, is a member of the [[Canadian University Press]]. Because of its northern latitude, UNBC is a member of the [[University of the Arctic]].

==History==
The [[Legislative Assembly of British Columbia|British Columbia legislature]] passed Bill 40, (the UNBC Act) that formally established the university, on June 22, 1990&lt;ref name=&quot;unbchistory&quot;&gt;[http://www.unbc.ca/unbchistory/index.html UNBC History]&lt;/ref&gt; The university was established in response to a grass roots movement spearheaded by the [[Interior University Society]]. UNBC offered a limited number of courses in rented office space in 1992 and 1993 but was opened officially by Queen [[Elizabeth II]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bcarchives.gov.bc.ca/exhibits/jubilee/chronvisit.htm| last=British Columbia Archives| title=Chronology of Principal Royal Visits to British Columbia| publisher=Queen's Printer for British Columbia| accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 1500 students, in 1994 with the completion of the main Prince George campus &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title='Fitzhenry and Whiteside Book of Canadian Facts and Dates'  |last=Pound |first=Richard W. |publisher=Fitzhenry and Whiteside |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; after two years of construction.

The governance was modelled on the provincial University of Toronto Act of 1906 which established a [[bicameral]] system of university government consisting of a Senate (composed of members of the faculty), responsible for academic policy, and a board of governors (composed of members of the community) exercising exclusive control over financial policy and having formal authority in all other matters. The President, appointed by the board, was to provide a link between the two bodies and to perform institutional leadership.&lt;ref name=&quot;governance&quot;&gt;[http://www.unbc.ca/about/governance.html UNBC - Governance]&lt;/ref&gt; The current President is Dr. George Iwama, whose term as President began July 1, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;presidentpress&quot;&gt;[http://www.unbc.ca/releases/2009/02_03new_president.html Press release announcing George Iwama as President]&lt;/ref&gt;

The university has gained attention with the introduction of the Northern Medical Program (NMP), which is a collaboration between [[UBC]] and UNBC. Through this collaboration, several acadamic physicians have been attracted to the city, which has led to an emerging academic medical community. For example, the introduction of the BC Cancer Agency's Centre for the North has attracted academic oncologists, such as Dr. Robert Olson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Robert|coauthors=Brastianos P, Palma D.`|title=Prognostic and predictive value of epigenetic silencing of MGMT in patients with high grade gliomas: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Robert|coauthors=Iverson G, Carolan H, Parkinson M, Brooks B, McKenzie M|title=Prospective comparison of two cognitive screening tests: Diagnostic accuracy and correlation with community integration and quality of life|journal=Journal of Neuro-Oncology|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Olson|first=Robert|title=Selection bias potentially overestimates risk of breast pain from radiotherapy|journal=Radiotherapy &amp; Oncology|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caon|first=Julianna|coauthors=Olson R, Tyldesley S, Bergman A, Bobinski M, Fong M, Ma V, Vellani R, Goddard K|title=.

==Features and Buildings==
The campus is located on Cranbrook Hill, overlooking the city of Prince George from the west and is widely renowned for its innovative architecture. The separate buildings are linked by an [[agora]] that is partially below ground level. It is the efficient heating system connected to all the core campus buildings that permits UNBC to pursue its goal of heating the university by the gasification of clean-burning, renewable wood pellets, collected from the waste of pine trees killed by the mountain pine beetle epidemic.

UNBC's buildings are designed to represent the northern landscape. The 'Winter Garden' area has a flowing blue staircase below a ceiling of wooden lattices, representing the west coast rain forests. The cafeteria has a lighthouse design representative of the North's rugged coastline.  There are also other structures, such as triangular glass peaks, which represent mountains and act as sky-lights for the UNBC Bookstore.

On October 13th 2010, UNBC was co-awarded the Campus Sustainability Leadership Award by the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) for its bio-energy project which targets a reduction in fossil fuel use by supplying 85% of UNBC's heating needs. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.opinion250.com/blog/view/17893/3/unbc+wins+aashe+award&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mandate==
UNBC's motto'' 'En cha hunÃ¡'' literally means &quot;He/she also lives.&quot; in the [[Nak'azdli]] ([[Fort St. James]]) dialect of [[Dakelh|Carrier]]. It is said to be a saying meaning &quot;other people have their point of view&quot; or &quot;respect everyone's point of view&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unbcabout&quot;&gt;[http://www.unbc.ca/about/ University of Northern BC, About UNBC]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Student life==
NUGSS or the [http://nugss.unbc.ca/ Northern Undergraduate Students Society] represents the undergraduate students at the University of Northern British Columbia. A non-profit organization, the Student Society is the voice for students and facilitates various events.  The NUGSS executive composes of five executive directors and six associates who are elected to one-year terms. NUGSS as holds annual events for students the Backyard Barbecue and the Final Affair.

The [http://www.unbc.ca/firstnationscentre/ First Nations Centre] provides support services for aboriginal students, including bringing in elders, counselling, and events such as talking circles and sweats. The [http://www.northernpridesociety.com/ ''Northern Pride Centre Society] or PC offers a safe space, support, and resources to the LGBTQ and ally community, including a new Positive Space Campaign designed by UNBC students.''

A bi-monthly University Farmersâ Market is held on campus, a collaborative project between multiple stakeholders within the university including NUGSS, faculty, staff, students, Students for a Green University and the [http://pgpirg.tumblr.com/ Prince George Public Interest Research Group]. This innovative project brought easily accessible local foods onto campus, bringing UNBC populations together (faculty, staff and students) in a social atmosphere.

==UNBC Timberwolves==
The Timberwolves, UNBC's basketball team, were officially accepted into the Canada West Universities Athletic Association. An announcement, made on UNBC's website on September 20th, 2011, stated: &quot;The Canada West Universities Athletics Association has voted in favour of the University of Northern British Columbiaâs most recent application for full membership. A special meeting was called last week to revisit the University of Northern British Columbiaâs membership application. The positive outcome of this most recent vote means that UNBC will compete in Canadaâs top university athletic association in both basketball and soccer. UNBC will begin play in men's and women's soccer and basketball in September 2012&quot;.
