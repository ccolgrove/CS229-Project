'''Erie''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|ÉªÉr|i}}) is a city located in [[Northwest Region (Pennsylvania)|northwestern]] [[Pennsylvania]] in the [[United States]]. Named for the [[Lake Erie|lake]] and the [[Erie tribe|Native American tribe]] that resided along its southern shore, Erie is the state's fourth-largest city (after [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Allentown, Pennsylvania|Allentown]]), with a population of 102,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;county facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Erie County Government|url=http://www.eriecountygov.org/default.aspx?id=rec&amp;HeadlineID=394298488593750&amp;Action=ShowArticle|title=Interesting Facts about Erie County|accessdate=2007-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erie's Metropolitan Area consists of approximately 280,000 residents and an Urbanized Area population of approximately 195,000. The city is the [[county seat|seat of government]] for [[Erie County, Pennsylvania|Erie County]].

Erie is near [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]]; [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]]; and [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]. Once teeming with heavy industry, Erie's manufacturing sector remains prominent in the local economy, though healthcare, higher education, and tourism are emerging as greater economic drivers. Millions visit Erie for water recreation at [[Presque Isle State Park]], as well as attractions like a [[Presque Isle Downs|casino and horse racetrack]] named for the state park.

Erie is known as the ''Flagship City'' because of the presence of [[Oliver Hazard Perry]]'s flagship [[USS Niagara (1813)|''Niagara'']].&lt;ref name=&quot;city facts&quot;&gt;{{cite web |publisher=The City of Erie |year=2010 |url=http://www.erie.pa.us/AboutErie/Facts/tabid/80/Default.aspx|title=About Erie |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city has also been called the ''Gem City'' because of the &quot;sparkling&quot; lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;city facts&quot;/&gt; Erie won the [[All-America City Award]] in 1972. Erie, Pennsylvania is also occasionally nicknamed colloquilly as ''The Lake City'' because of its location on the southern, American shores of Lake Erie, from which the city is named.

== History ==
{{Main|History of Erie, Pennsylvania}}
The six nations of the [[Iroquois|Iroquois Confederacy]], which included the [[Seneca nation|Senecas]], originally occupied the lands in what is now Erie. Europeans first arrived in the region when the French constructed [[Fort Presque Isle]] near present-day Erie in 1753, as part of their effort to defend [[New France]] against the encroaching British. The name of the fort refers to that piece of land that juts into Lake Erie, now called [[Presque Isle State Park]], with the French word &quot;[[presque-isle]]&quot; meaning peninsula (literally &quot;almost an island&quot;). When the fort was abandoned by the French in 1760, it was their last post west of [[Niagara River|Niagara]]. The British occupied the fort at Presque Isle that same year, three years before the end of the [[French and Indian War]] in 1763.&lt;ref name=&quot;warner-beers 503&quot;&gt;''History of Erie County'', p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Present-day Erie is situated in what was the disputed [[Erie Triangle]], a triangle of land that was claimed by the states of [[New York]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Connecticut]] (as part of its [[Connecticut Western Reserve|Western Reserve]]), and [[Massachusetts]]. It officially became part of Pennsylvania on March 3, 1792, after Connecticut, Massachusetts and New York relinquished their claims to the federal government, which in turn sold the land to Pennsylvania for 75&amp;nbsp;cents per acre or a total of [[United States dollar|$]]151,640.25 in [[Continental (currency)|Continental currency]]. The Iroquois released the land to Pennsylvania in January 1789 for payments of $2,000 from Pennsylvania and $1,200 from the federal government. The [[Seneca Nation]] separately settled land claims against Pennsylvania in February 1791 for the sum of $800.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson 103-104&quot;&gt;Nelson, pp. 103&amp;ndash;104.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Battle erie.jpg|thumb|left|The Battle of Lake Erie played a role in the history of Erie.]]

The General Assembly of Pennsylvania commissioned the surveying of land near Presque Isle through an act passed on April 18, 1795. [[Andrew Ellicott]], who completed [[Pierre Charles L'Enfant]]'s survey of [[Washington, D.C.]] and helped resolve the boundary between Pennsylvania and New York, arrived to begin the survey in June 1795. Initial settlement of the area began that year.&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson 103-104&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;warner-beers 505-506&quot;&gt;''History of Erie County'', pp 505&amp;ndash;506.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Seth Reed]] and his family moved to the Erie area from [[Geneva, New York]] and became the first European settlers of Erie.

To wrest control of Lake Erie from the British during the [[War of 1812]], President [[James Madison]] ordered the construction of a naval fleet at Erie. Noted shipbuilders [[Daniel Dobbins]] of Erie and Noah Brown of New York led construction of four schooner&amp;ndash;rigged gunboats and two brigs. Commodore [[Oliver Hazard Perry]] arrived from [[Rhode Island]] and led the squadron to success in the historic [[Battle of Lake Erie]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;History of Erie County&quot;, pp. 299, 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Erie, Pennsylvania 1922.jpg|thumb|right|State and 9th Streets in downtown Erie during the early 1920s]]

Erie was an important railroad hub in the mid-19th century, the city was the site where three sets of [[track gauge]]s met. While the delays required to unload and load passengers and cargo were a problem for commerce and travel, they provided much needed local jobs in Erie. When a national [[standard gauge|standardized gauge]] was proposed, those jobs, and the importance of the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. The citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to attempt to stop the standardization in an event known as the [[Erie Gauge War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Rhodes |first=James Ford |authorlink=James Ford Rhodes |title=History of the United States from the compromise of 1850 |year=1900 |publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |location=New York, New York |url=http://www.archive.org/details/historyunitedst20rhodgoog |volume=3 |page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 1915, the [[Mill Creek (Lake Erie)|Mill Creek]] flooded downtown Erie when a [[culvert]], blocked by debris, gave out.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood&quot;&gt;{{cite web |title=Erie's Blackest Day &amp; Other Accounts of Phenomenal Weather |date=October 2008 |publisher=Erie County Historical Society |format=PDF |url=http://www.eriecountyhistory.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/10/eriesblackestday3.pdf |accessdate=August 29, 2010 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; A four block reservoir, caused by torrential downpours, had formed behind it. The resulting deluge destroyed 225&amp;nbsp;houses and killed 36&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood&quot;/&gt; After the flood, Mayor [[Miles Brown Kitts|Miles B. Kitts]] had the Mill Creek diverted to a {{Convert|22|x|19|ft}}, concrete tube that travels for over {{Convert|2|mi}} under the city, before emptying into to [[Presque Isle Bay]].

Erie's importance gradually faded during the second half of 20th Century as the age of lake trade, commercial fishing, and American manufacturing dominance drew to a close.&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;&gt;{{cite web|publisher=City-data.com|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Erie-History.html|title=Erie Detailed History|accessdate=2007-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Downtown Erie continued to grow for most of the 20th century, before taking a major population downturn in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;/&gt; With the advent of the automobile age, thousands of residents left Erie for suburbs such as [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]], which now has over 50,000 people.&lt;ref name=&quot;mary&quot;/&gt;

Erie has won the [[All-America City Award]] only once, in 1972, and was a finalist in 1961, 1994, 1995 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Frederick |first=Robb |title=Erie falls in award contest |newspaper=Erie Times-News |date=June 20, 2009 |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090620/NEWS02/306199871 |accessdate=November 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Past Winners of the All-America City Award |publisher=[[National Civic League]] |year=2011 |accessdate=February 3, 2011 |url=http://www.allamericacityaward.com/past-winners-of-the-all-america-city-award}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geography ==
[[File:Erie Zoo train bridge.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[Mill Creek (Lake Erie)|Mill Creek]] passes through the middle of the [[Erie Zoo]].]]

Erie is situated at {{Coord|42|6|52|N|80|4|34|W|city}} (42.114507, -80.076213),{{GR|1}} directly between [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], [[New York]], and [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]] on the south-central shores of Lake Erie. Erieâs bedrock is [[Devonian]] [[shale]] and [[siltstone]], overlain by glacial [[till]]s and [[Sandur|stratified drift]]. Stream drainage in Erie flows northward into [[Lake Erie]], then through [[Lake Ontario]], the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River]], and out to the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. South of Erie is a drainage divide, where most of the streams south of this divide in western Pennsylvania flow in a southward direction into the [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] or [[Ohio River|Ohio]] rivers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Glacial Geology of Northwestern Pennsylvania&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/topogeo/pub/generalgeology/G32/G32.aspx |title=General Geology Report 32 |accessdate=2007-11-02 |publisher=Pennsylvania Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of {{convert|28.0|sqmi}} with {{convert|22.0|sqmi}} being land and the remaining (21.54%) being water. Erie is home to [[Presque Isle State Park]] (known to the locals as &quot;The Peninsula&quot;), a [[peninsula]] that juts into [[Lake Erie]] and has {{convert|7|mi}} of public beaches, wetlands, and fishing sites.

Erie is laid out in a grid surrounding [[Perry Square]] in the downtown area.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;&gt;{{Cite map |title=City of Erie, Erie County |publisher=Pennsylvania Department of Transportation |date=September 23, 2008 |format=PDF |series=Type 5C |url=ftp://ftp.dot.state.pa.us/public/pdf/BPR_pdf_files/Maps/City/Erie/25302.pdf |accessdate=February 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The downtown buildings are separated from the waterfront by the Bayfront Parkway.&lt;ref name=&quot;map&quot;/&gt; The tallest structure in Erie is [[St. Peter Cathedral, Erie|St. Peter Cathedral]] at {{convert|265|ft}} and the tallest building is the Renaissance Centre at {{convert|198|ft}} tall. Erie has generally small ethnic neighborhoods including Little Italy. South of 38th Street, the grid gives way to curvilinear roads of post-1970 suburban development. [[Millcreek Township, Erie County, Pennsylvania|Millcreek Township]] and [[Peach Street]] are among Erie's newer areas.

Most of the cityscape includes renovated and refurbished factory buildings, mid&amp;ndash;rise housing, single family homes, and office buildings. Erie's waterfront includes the [[List of city parks of Erie, Pennsylvania|Pepsi Amphitheater]] and surrounding parkland, which hosts numerous festivals. The [[Bayfront Convention Center]] is on Sassafras Pier next to Dobbins Landing. The [[Bicentennial Tower]] is centrally located in the skyline when viewed from Presque Isle State Park, with the high-rise and mid-rise buildings flanking the higher ground behind and to the east and west sides. On the east end of the waterfront, the [[Erie Maritime Museum]] and the city's main library, and third largest in Pennsylvania, host the [[USS Niagara (1813)|''Niagara'']]. Docks and [[marina]]s fill the freshwater shoreline in between.

=== Climate ===
The climate of Erie is typical of the Great Lakes. Erie is located in the [[snow belt]] that stretches from [[Cleveland, Ohio|Cleveland]] to [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] and [[Watertown (city), New York|Watertown]]; accordingly, its winters are typically cold, with heavy [[lake effect snow]], but also with occasional stretches of mild weather that causes accumulated snow to melt. Erie lies in the [[Humid continental climate|humid continental]] zone ([[KÃ¶ppen climate classification|KÃ¶ppen]] ''Dfa'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kottek |first=Marcus |last2=Greiser |first2=JÃ¼rgen |last3=Beck |first3=Christoph |last4=Rudolf |first4=Bruno |last5=Rubel |first5=Franz |display-authors=2 |title=World Map of KÃ¶ppen&amp;ndash;Geiger Climate Classification |date=June 2006 |journal=Meteorologische Zeitschrift |volume=15 |issue=3 |page=261 |doi=10.1127/0941-2948/2006/0130}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city experiences a full range of weather events, including snow, ice, rain, thunderstorms and fog.

Erie is 6th on the list of snowiest places in the United States, averaging {{convert|78.7|in|cm}}.&lt;ref&gt;

Erie is the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania's primary access point to [[Lake Erie]], the Great Lakes, and the [[Saint Lawrence Seaway]]. The city emerged as a maritime center after the [[American Revolution]], then as a railroad hub during the great American westward expansion. Erie became an important city for iron and steel manufacturing during the [[Industrial Revolution]] and thrived well into the 20th century with big industry.

While only [[diesel-electric locomotive]] building remains from the ranks of the large manufacturers in the early 21st century, a more diverse mix of mid-sized industries has emerged. This broader economic base includes not only smaller and more agile steel and plastic plants, but also a vigorous service sector: health, insurance and tourism. {{As of|December 2010}}, Erie's unemployment rate was 8.9&amp;nbsp;percent, as compared to rates for Pennsylvania and the United States at 8.5 and 9.4&amp;nbsp;percent, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Jim |last=Martin |date=February 1, 2011 |newspaper=Erie Times-News |url=http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2011302019972 |title=Erie County's unemployment rate dips below 9 percent |accessdate=February 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
