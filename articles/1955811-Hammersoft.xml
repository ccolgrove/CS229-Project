The '''Department of Conservation and Recreation''' ('''DCR''') is a state agency of the [[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]], situated in the [[Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs (Massachusetts)|Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs]]. It is best known for its [[park]]s and [[parkway]]s.  As of May 24, 2011 the Commissioner of the DCR is [[Edward M. Lambert, Jr.]] The DCR's mission is &quot;To protect, promote and enhance our common wealth of natural, cultural and recreational resources.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mass.gov/dcr/aboutDCR.htm website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The agency is the largest landowner in Massachusetts.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sledmass.com/legislation.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

DCR lands and roads formerly belonged to the '''Metropolitan District Commission''' (MDC) and the '''Department of Environmental Management''' (DEM). Under Governor [[Mitt Romney]], the MDC and DEM were merged to form the DCR.

Ownership and management for non-pedestrian bridges was transferred to the [[Massachusetts Department of Transportation]] in 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;globe-bridges&quot; /&gt;

==Structure==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
The DCR is under the general management of the Commissioner of the DCR.  The general administration divisions; Human Resources Division, the Financial Division, and External and Legislative Affairs, report directly to the Commissioner.  Additionally, five operating units, under the general direction of a Deputy Commissioner of Operations, carry out the day to work and project execution of the agency.  The five operating units are:

* Bureau of State Parks and Recreation
* Bureau of Urban Parks and Recreation
* Bureau of Water Supply Protection
* Bureau of Engineering
* Bureau of Planning

===Bureau of State Parks and Recreation===
The Bureau of State Parks and Recreation is responsible for the maintenance and management of over {{convert|450000|acre|km2|-1}} of privately and state-owned forests and parks, nearly 10% of the Commonwealth's total land mass.  Within the lands managed by the Bureau of State Parks and Recreation are some 29 [[campgrounds]], over {{convert|2000|mi|km}} of trails, 87 beaches, 37 swimming, wading, and spray pools, 62 playgrounds, 55 ballfields, {{convert|145|mi|km|0}} of paved bike and rail trails and once private homes and estates that are now a part of the DCR's [[Historic Curatorship Program]].

===Bureau of Urban Parks and Recreation===
The Bureau of Urban Parks and Recreation is responsible for the maintenance and management of a variety of environments within the Greater Boston area, including urban wilds, historic sites, and other naturally aesthetic or significant environmental properties. The origins of the collective environments in the bureau date back to the creation of the Metropolitan Park Commission in 1893, forming the first such regional system in the United States. The jurisdiction of the bureau is referred to by the DCR as the [[Metropolitan Park System of Greater Boston]].&lt;ref name=&quot;mps-history&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/dcr/uphistory.htm|title=Division of Urban Parks and Recreation History|publisher=Commonwealth of Massachusetts|accessdate=8 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bureau of Water Supply Protection===
The Bureau of Water Supply Protection is responsible for the protection and management of drinking supply watersheds for the Greater Boston area.  This bureau monitors lakes and ponds, well drillers, and rainfall throughout the Commonwealth.

===Bureau of Engineering===
The Bureau of Engineering provides professional engineering, design, and construction management services in support of DCR properties. In addition to providing engineering services for over {{convert|450000|acre|km2}} of parks, forests, watersheds, beaches, 340 dams, and numerous recreational facilities, the Bureau of Engineering also manages over 525 lane miles of parkways and nearly 300 bridges and tunnels notable for their landmark stature and importance in the Commonwealthâs transportation system.

The Bureau operates under the direction of a Chief Engineer and is sub-divided into six operating units:

* Bridge and Parkway Engineering
* Facilities Engineering
* Dams and Waterways Engineering
* Stormwater and Environmental Engineering
* Construction Permitting
* Construction Services

The Bureau is responsible for the management of the majority of the DCR's annual capital budget which has declined in recent years from a $150â200 Million high to a current $70-80 Million.

====List of parkways====
