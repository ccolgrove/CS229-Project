'''Samford University''', founded as '''Howard College''' is a [[private university|private]], [[coeducation]]al, [[Alabama Baptist Convention]]-affiliated [[university]] located in [[Homewood, Alabama|Homewood]], a suburb of [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]], [[Alabama]], [[United States]]. It includes the [http://howard.samford.edu Howard College of Arts and Sciences], [[Cumberland School of Law]], [[McWhorter School of Pharmacy]], [[Brock School of Business]], [[Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing]], and [[Beeson Divinity School]]. In the 2011 report, Samford was ranked 104 out of 191 top tier doctoral universities by ''U.S. News &amp; World Report''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/national-universities-rankings/page+5 National Universities Rankings â Best Colleges 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Samford University2.jpg|right|450px|thumb|Bird's-eye view of the campus]]
Samford was founded in 1841 at [[Marion, Alabama]], when members of [[Siloam Baptist Church]] acquired land in the town and invited the Alabama Baptist Convention to build a new [[Baptist]] school there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Heritage of Perry County |last=Harris |first=W. Stuart  |year=1991 |publisher=Perry County Historical and Preservation Society |location=Marion, Alabama |isbn= |pages=70â92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Some Early Alabama Churches |last=Wilson |first=Mabel Ponder  |year=1973 |publisher=Alabama Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution |location=Marion, Alabama |isbn=978-0884280293 |pages=134â144}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They named it '''Howard College''' in honor of [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]], known for his work in [[prison reform]] in England. Among the charter trustees in 1841 was lawyer [[William Parish Chilton]] of Talladega. The new college opened its doors to students on January 3, 1842. In 1887 the school relocated to the East Lake community of Birmingham.&lt;ref name=&quot;samford.edu&quot;&gt;http://www.samford.edu/history/davis.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Women were first admitted to Howard College in 1895, and the college officially became coeducational in 1913. One year later the school established its Teacher Education Division. In 1920 the school joined the Southern Association of Colleges.  In 1927 it added its [[pharmacology|pharmacy]] school.

[[Image:Samford University Reid Chapel.JPG|thumb|left|175px|Reid Chapel]]

In 1961, the school acquired the [[Cumberland School of Law]] from [[Cumberland University]] in [[Lebanon, Tennessee|Lebanon]], [[Tennessee]].

Under the leadership of President Harwell Goodwin Davis, the college relocated.  On June 11, 1953 Howard College broke ground on its third campus in the Shades Valley just south of Birmingham.  The school occupied its new campus in 1957.

In 1965 Howard reinstituted its master's degree program.  This led to the college's elevation to university status on November 9, 1965.  The school was renamed in honor of Frank Park Samford, chairman of the Board of Trustees and up to that time, the institution's most generous individual benefactor.  (In addition, there was also a [[Howard University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].)

[[Image:Samford University Beeson Divinity School.JPG|thumb|225px|right|[[Beeson Divinity School]]]]

The Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing, owned by the Baptist Medical Center of Birmingham, was added to the University in 1973.  In 1988, the [[Beeson Divinity School]] was established through donations from Ralph W. Beeson.

The University consists of the Howard College of Arts and Sciences, Brock School of Business, Orlean Bullard Beeson School of Education and Professional Studies, School of Performing Arts, Ida V. Moffett School of Nursing, McWhorter School of Pharmacy, Beeson School of Divinity, and [[Cumberland School of Law]].

On January 29, 2004, in his Founder's Day Address, then-President Thomas E. Corts announced a multi-year improvement plan called, &quot;The Promise.&quot; He said, &quot;Samford University will be an academically vigorous Christian university that coordinates a strong, effective educational program and encouragement of Christian belief and service, within a community that respects its individual members and encourages each to highest and best levels of performance and conduct -- academically, socially, spiritually, physically.&quot;

[[Image:Cumberland School of Law Main Hall and Courtyard.jpg|thumb|225px|right|[[Cumberland School of Law]] in 2006]]

The plan calls for Samford to invest some $200 million to &quot;enrich and enhance the educational experience of its students.&quot;  Since June 1, 2003 more than $37 million has been contributed in philanthropic gifts toward the campaign.{{cn|date=September 2011}}

==Civil rights==
As a private, [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] institution, Samford University was to some degree insulated from the activities of leaders and protesters of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] in the 1950s and early 1960s.  Birmingham was the site of demonstrations led by the [[Southern Christian Leadership Conference]] (SCLC) and Dr. [[Martin Luther King]] to end segregation of public facilities and open city jobs to minorities.  The era was marked by nationally covered protests and the deaths of four young African-American girls in the Easter 1963 bombing of a Birmingham church.

A growing core of Samford faculty and students opposed segregation.  The officers of the Samford Student Government Association challenged a segregated concert held on campus by the Alabama Symphony by inviting as guests the student government officers of nearby [[Miles College]], a historically black school. University officials turned away the combined delegation from the concert.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

University president Leslie Stephen Wright resisted integration, but Samford's &quot;whites-only&quot; policy threatened Federal student aid and institutional accreditation.  Segregation by private universities was ended by the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act by the [[US Congress]]. [[Cumberland School of Law]] faced the greatest immediate risk of losing accreditation.  In 1967 it admitted Samford's first black student, Audrey Lattimore Gaston.  The entire university proceeded with integration.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.samford.edu/history/wright2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The interior of the dome contains paintings of prominent figures from Christian history, and was inspired by a passage in chapter 12 of Hebrews. It was painted by a modern Romanian fresco master named [[Petru Botezatu]]. The chapel also commemorates one 20th century Christian martyr from each of the six inhabited continents, and the sculptures portraying each of them are also the work of Botezatu.

==Demographics==
As of fall 2009, the last semester for which comprehensive data have been published, the university had an enrollment of 2,938 undergraduate students and 1,777 graduate and professional students.

Approximately 40% of the total undergraduate student body comes from [[Alabama]], 16% come from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and 15% come from [[Tennessee]]. As a result, Samford's flavor, though leavened with students from across the United States (40 states are represented, along with 18 foreign countries), is overwhelmingly Southern.

Almost 85% of Samford's students (graduate and undergraduate) are Caucasian, and about 7% are African American. About 15% of Samford students are minorities, and 40% are male.{{cn|date=September 2011}}

==Campus==
Samford's campus has moved several times during its history. Originally, Howard College was located in [[Marion, Alabama]], a black-belt  town between [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] and [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]]; it is the birthplace of [[Coretta Scott King]]. In 1887, the college moved to the East Lake community in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]].

The collegeâand now Universityâis presently located approximately {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} south of downtown Birmingham in [[Homewood, Alabama]]'s Shades Valley area. The campus lies along [[Alabama State Route 149|Lakeshore Drive]] in Homewood, just {{convert|2|mi|km|0}} from [[Interstate 65 in Alabama|Interstate 65]].

Besides its lush lawns and well-maintained gardens, Samford boasts a distinctive example of '''[[Georgian style]] architecture''' found in the United States. Samford's uniform style, based upon [[Colonial Williamsburg]], was the vision of President Harwell Davis when he moved the campus to the Shades Valley area in 1953-55.

==Student life==
===Organizations===
[[Image:Samford University Habitat for Humanity.jpg|thumb|right|255 px|Students participate in organizations like [[Habitat for Humanity]] to facilitate service learning.]]
According to Samford officials, co-curricular involvement is an important aspect of a total education. Because of this philosophy, Samford students are encouraged to select from more than 100 honors, religious, professional, educational, service and social student organizations. These groups, overseen by the Office of Student Involvement, offer Samford students an opportunity to explore their interests with like-minded individuals.

Samford's diversity of programming runs the gamut from a student-led group of [[Oxfam America]], a social justice organization, to the Samford [[Young Life]] chapter, an [[Evangelical Christian]] group.

===Greek life===
As of fall 2010, 33% of the undergraduate student body was affiliated with one of 9 social Greek organizations. Specifically, 29% of men were members of fraternities and 34% of women were members of sororities.

The local chapters are supported by active alumni bases that continue to involve former active members in both the life of the social organization and the life of the University. Many members of Samford's administration, along with several notable alums, were members of Greek organizations.

====Fraternities====
The fraternities represented on campus are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;&quot;

| [[Sigma Nu]] || 1879
|}

====Sororities====
The sororities represented on campus are:

|-
| [[Kappa Delta]] || 1968 (closed since 1985)
|-
| [[Phi Mu]] || 1924
|-
| [[Chi Omega]] || 1963
|}

Samford also houses chapters for [[Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonia]], the social fraternity for men of musicianly character; [[Delta Omicron]]; and [[Gamma Sigma Sigma]], a service sorority. These chapters are not affiliated with the Interfraternity Council or Panhellinic Council.

===Student housing===
All undergraduate students (with some exceptions) are required to live on campus until the age of 21 to the extent that on-campus student housing facilities can accommodate them.

Approximately 66% of undergraduates -â freshmen, sophomores, and many juniors -â live on campus. Many senior undergraduates also live on campus, and those who do not often join the graduate and professional students in living near campus. Consequently, student life at Samford is heavily intertwined with campus life.{{cn|date=September 2011}}

===Erskine Ramsay Hall===
On Sunday March 9, 2008 at 3:58 PM Ramsay Hall suffered structural damage. Rafters supporting the roof
collapsed unexpectedly. Residences heard a series of loud &quot;shots&quot; minutes before the roof collapsed. Campus safety responded promptly alerting fire departments and structural engineers. President Andrew Westmorland helped students the first night by providing a $100 gift card to each resident in order to purchase necessities until personal belongings could be recovered from the dormitory. All residences were reassigned dorm rooms the following week. As of April 20, 2009 the remainder of the dorm still stands on campus with no construction repairs done.

==Media==
There are several media outlines at Samford, with administration, faculty, and students producing different publications.

''Inside Samford'' is the official newsletter of the university administration and faculty. Published ten times each year, it does not publish opinion.
