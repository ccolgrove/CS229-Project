===UN weapons inspections resume===

The issue of [[Iraq disarmament crisis|Iraq's disarmament reached a crisis]] in 2002â2003, when Bush demanded a complete end to alleged [[Iraqi production of weapons of mass destruction]] and full compliance with [[UN Security Council Resolution]]s requiring UN weapons inspectors unfettered access to suspected weapons production facilities. The [[United Nations Resolutions concerning Iraq|UN had prohibited]] Iraq from developing or possessing such weapons after the [[Gulf War]] and required Iraq to permit inspections confirming compliance. During inspections in 1999, Iraq alleged that UN inspectors included U.S. intelligence agents that supplied the U.S. with a direct feed of conversations between Iraqi security agencies as well as other information. This was confirmed by the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/250808.stm |title=U.S. silence on new Iraq spying allegations |publisher=BBC News |date=1999-01-07 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2002, Bush repeatedly warned of military action unless inspections were allowed to progress unfettered. In accordance with [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|UN Security Council Resolution 1441]] Iraq reluctantly agreed to [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|new inspections in late 2002]]. A third weapons inspection team in 2003 led by [[David Kelly (weapons expert)]] viewed and photographed with the cooperation of Iraqis two alleged mobile weapons laboratories which were facilities for the production of hydrogen gas to fill balloons.

Shortly before the invasion [[Hans Blix]], the lead weapons inspector, advised the [[UN Security Council]] that Iraq was cooperating with inspections and that the confirmation of disarmament through inspections could be achieved in a short period of time if Iraq remained cooperative.&lt;ref name=&quot;BlixtoUN&quot;/&gt;

===Alleged weapons of mass destruction===
====Yellowcake uranium====
[[Image:WeaponsInspector.JPG|thumb|A UN weapons inspector in Iraq]]

Before the [[Gulf War]], in 1990, Iraq had stockpiled {{convert|550|ST}} of [[yellowcake]] [[uranium]] at the Tuwaitha nuclear complex about {{convert|20|km}} south of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saddam's uranium headed for Ontario processing plant|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-07-05|url=http://www.thestar.com/News/Ontario/article/455063 | work=The Star | location=Toronto | accessdate=March 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late February 2002, the CIA sent former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph Wilson]] to investigate [[Niger uranium forgeries|reports]] (later found to be forgeries) that Iraq was attempting to purchase additional yellowcake from [[Niger]]. Wilson returned and informed the CIA that reports of yellowcake sales to Iraq were &quot;unequivocally wrong.&quot; The Bush administration, however, continued to allege Iraq's attempts to obtain additional yellowcake were a justification for military action, most prominently in the January 2003, [[State of the Union]] address, in which President Bush declared that Iraq had sought uranium, citing [[British intelligence]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Duffy|first=Michael|coauthors=James Carney|title=A Question of Trust|publisher=Time|date=2003-07-13|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101030721-464405,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:State of the Union.jpg|thumb|[[2003 State of the Union Address]] given by [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]]]

In response, Wilson wrote a critical ''New York Times'' op-ed piece in June 2003 stating that he had personally investigated claims of yellowcake purchases and believed them to be fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last1=Roberts|first1=Pat|last2=Rockefeller|first2=John D., IV|contribution=Niger: Former Ambassador|contribution-url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/2004_rpt/iraq-wmd-intell_chapter2-b.htm|title=Report on the u.s. intelligence community's prewar intelligence assessments on iraq|year=2004|pages=39â47|place=United States Senate|publisher=Select Committee on Intelligence|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/2004_rpt/iraq-wmd_intell_09jul2004_report2.pdf|format=PDF|postscript=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Wilson's op-ed, Wilson's wife [[Valerie Plame]] was publicly identified as an undercover CIA analyst by a [[Robert Novak|columnist]]. This led to a [[Plame affair|Justice Department investigation]] into the source of the leak.

On May 1, 2005, the &quot;[[Downing Street memo]]&quot; was published in ''[[The Sunday Times]]''. It contained an overview of a secret July 23, 2002, meeting among [[British government]], [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]], and [[British intelligence]] figures who discussed the build-up to the Iraq warâincluding direct references to classified U.S. policy of the time. The memo stated, &quot;Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of [[terrorism]] and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rycroft|first=Matthew|title=The secret Downing Street memo|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=2005-05-01|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/election2005/article387390.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2002, the Bush administration, the CIA and the DIA said attempts by Iraq to acquire high-strength [[Iraqi aluminum tubes|aluminum tubes]] that were prohibited under the UN monitoring program and which they said pointed to a clandestine effort to make centrifuges to enrich uranium for nuclear bombs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document|last1=Silberman|first1=Laurence H.|last2=Robb|first2=Charles S.|contribution=Iraq|contribution-url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/2005/wmd_report_25mar2005_chap01.htm|title=Report to the President of the United States|year=2005|page=198|publisher=The Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/2005/wmd_report_31mar2005.pdf|format=PDF|postscript=}} &quot;Iraq was prohibited from possessing tubes composed of 7075 T6 aluminum alloy with outer diameters exceeding {{Nowrap|75 mm}} under Annex&amp;nbsp;III to United Nations Security Council Resolution 687 because of their potential use in gas centrifuges.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; This analysis was opposed by the [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) and [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research|INR]], which was significant because of DOE's expertise in such gas centrifuges and nuclear weapons programs. The DOE and INR argued that the Iraqi tubes were poorly suited for centrifuges, though it was technically possible with additional modification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/2005/wmd_report_25mar2005_chap01.htm |title=Commission on the Intelligence Capabilities of the United States Regarding Weapons of Mass Destruction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report released by the [[Institute for Science and International Security]] in 2002 reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium.&lt;ref name=isis/&gt;

An effort by the DOE to correct this detail in comments prepared for [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]]'s UN appearance was rebuffed by the administration&lt;ref name=isis&gt;[http://www.isis-online.org/publications/iraq/al_tubes.html The CIA's Aluminum Tubes' Assessment:] [[Institute for Science and International Security]] March 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/4corners/content/2003/transcripts/s976015.htm Spinning The Tubes] ''[[Four Corners (TV program)|Four Corners]]'' [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] air date October 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; and Powell, in his address to the [[UN Security Council]] just before the war, referenced the aluminum tubes, stating that while experts disagreed on whether or not the tubes were destined for a centrifuge program, the specifications of the tubes were unusually tight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iraqwatch.org/government/US/State/state-powell-un-020503.htm |title=Powell's remarks |publisher=Iraqwatch.org |date=2003-02-05 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Powell later admitted he had presented what turned out to be an inaccurate case to the UN on Iraqi weapons, and the intelligence he was relying on was, in some cases, &quot;deliberately misleading.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A36348-2002Sep18 &quot;Evidence on Iraq Challenged,&quot;] Joby Warrick, ''The Washington Post'', Sept. 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/transcripts/powelltext_020503.html Colin Powell's speech to the UN], Feb 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4992558/ ''Meet the Press''] NBC, May 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[United States presidential election, 2008]], and the election of [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic party]] nominee [[Barack Obama]], president Bush stated that &quot;[my] biggest regret of all the presidency has to have been the intelligence failure in Iraq&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/02/george-bush-iraq-interview|title=Iraq war my biggest regret, Bush admits|publisher=www.guardian.co.uk|accessdate=2 December 2008 | location=London | date=December 2, 2008 | first=Suzanne | last=Goldenberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Poison gas====
The CIA had contacted Iraq's foreign minister, [[Naji Sabri]], who was being paid by the French as an agent. Sabri informed them that Saddam had hidden poison gas among Sunni tribesmen, had ambitions for a nuclear program but that it was not active, and that no biological weapons were being produced or stockpiled, although research was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pincus|first=Walter|title=Ex-Iraqi Official Unveiled as Spy|publisher=Washington Post|date=2006-03-23|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/03/22/AR2006032202103.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Sidney Blumenthal]], George Tenet briefed Bush on September 18, 2002, that Sabri had informed them that Iraq did not have WMD. Bush dismissed this top-secret intelligence from Hussein's inner circle which was approved by two senior CIA officers. The information was never shared with Congress or CIA agents examining whether Saddam had such weapons.&lt;ref&gt;Blumenthal, S. (September 6, 2007) [http://www.salon.com/opinion/blumenthal/2007/09/06/bush_wmd/ &quot;Bush knew Saddam had no weapons of mass destruction&quot;] ''Salon.com''&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Tenet.jpg|thumb|left|Tenet (left, in pink tie) in the [[Oval Office]] with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]].]]

====Biological weapons====
Based on reports obtained by the German intelligence service from an Iraqi defector codenamed &quot;Curveball&quot;, Colin Powell presented evidence to the United Nations security council that Iraq had an active biological weapons programme. On February 15, 2011, the defectorâa scientist identified as Rafid Ahmed Alwan al-Janafiâadmitted to journalists working for ''The Guardian'' newspaper that he lied to the ''[[Bundesnachrichtendienst]]'' in order to strengthen the case against Saddam Hussein, whom he wished to see removed from power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Curveball: How US was duped by Iraqi fantasist looking to topple Saddam|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2011/feb/15/curveball-iraqi-fantasist-cia-saddam|publisher=guardian.co.uk|accessdate=3 March 2011|author=Martin Chulov|coauthors=Helen Pidd|date=15 February 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Result====
In December 2009, former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] [[Tony Blair]] stated that he &quot;would still have thought it right to remove [Saddam Hussein]&quot; regardless of whether Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/8409596.stm|title=Unashamed Blair confirms his critics' claims on Iraq |last=Reynolds |first=Paul |date=12 December 2009|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During 2002 the amount of ordnance used by British and American aircraft patrolling the no-fly zones of Iraq increased compared to the previous years&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2002/dec/04/iraq.richardnortontaylor|title=Britain and U.S. step up bombing in Iraq|last=Norton-Taylor|first=Richard |date=4 December 2002|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by August had &quot;become a full air offensive&quot;. [[Tommy Franks]], the allied commander, later stated that the bombing was designed to &quot;degrade&quot; the Iraqi air defense system before an invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article527701.ece|title=RAF bombing raids tried to goad Saddam into war|last=Smith|first=Michael|date=May 29, 2005 |publisher=The Sunday Times|accessdate=31 August 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, a few days before the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] voted on the [[Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq]], about 75 senators were told in [[closed session]] that Iraq had the means of attacking the Eastern Seaboard of the U.S. with biological or chemical weapons delivered by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]]s (UAVs.)&lt;ref name=&quot;nelson&quot;/&gt; On February 5, 2003, [[Colin Powell]] presented further evidence in his Iraqi WMD program presentation to the [[UN Security Council]] that UAVs were ready to be launched against the U.S. At the time, there was a vigorous dispute within the U.S. military and intelligence communities as to whether CIA conclusions about Iraqi UAVs were accurate&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, C. (December 16, 2003) [http://www.defensetech.org/archives/000690.html &quot;Senator: White House Warned of UAV Attack,&quot;] ''Defense Tech''&lt;/ref&gt; and other intelligence agencies suggested that Iraq did not possess any offensive UAV capability, saying the few they had were designed for surveillance and intended for [[reconnaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/reports/2005/wmd_report_25mar2005_chap01.htm |title=Commission of the Intelligence capabilities of the United States regarding weapons of mass destruction |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senate voted to approve the Joint Resolution with the support of large bipartisan majorities on October 11, 2002, providing the Bush administration with a [[Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|legal basis for the U.S. invasion]] under [[U.S. law]].

The resolution granted the authorization by the [[Constitution of the United States]] and the [[United States Congress]] for the President to command the [[U.S. military|military]] to fight anti-United States violence. Citing the [[Iraq Liberation Act of 1998]], the resolution reiterated that it should be the policy of the United States to remove the Hussein regime and promote a democratic replacement. The authorization was signed by President George W. Bush on October 16, 2002.

Chief UN weapons inspector [[Hans Blix]] remarked in January 2003 that &quot;Iraq appears not to have come to a genuine acceptanceânot even todayâof the disarmament, which was demanded of it and which it needs to carry out to win the confidence of the world and to live in peace.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IraqWatch-20030127&quot;&gt;[http://www.iraqwatch.org/un/unmovic/unmovic-blix-012703.htm Blix's remarks] January 27, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Among other things he noted that {{convert|1000|ST}} of chemical agent were unaccounted for, information on Iraq's [[VX (nerve agent)|VX nerve agent]] program was missing, and that &quot;no convincing evidence&quot; was presented for the destruction of {{convert|8500|l}} of anthrax that had been declared.&lt;ref name=&quot;IraqWatch-20030127&quot;/&gt;

In the [[2003 State of the Union address]], President Bush said &quot;we know that Iraq, in the late 1990s, had several mobile biological weapons labs&quot;. On February 5, 2003, Secretary of State Colin Powell appeared before the UN to present American evidence that Iraq was hiding unconventional weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Third State of the Union Address|author=George W.

In early 2003, the U.S., British, and Spanish governments proposed the so-called &quot;eighteenth resolution&quot; to give Iraq a deadline for compliance with previous resolutions enforced by the threat of military action. This proposed resolution was subsequently withdrawn due to lack of support on the UN Security Council. In particular, [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) members France, Germany and Canada and non-NATO member Russia were opposed to military intervention in Iraq, due to the high level of risk to the international community's security, and defended disarmament through diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pastel.diplomatie.gouv.fr/editorial/actual/ael2/bulletin.gb.asp?liste=20030211.gb.html Joint Declaration by Russia, Germany and France on Iraq] France Diplomatie February 10, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/Iraq/Story/0,2763,810093,00.html Russian/Ukrainian rebuff for Blair over Iraq] [[The Guardian]] October 11, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

A meeting between George W. Bush and [[Tony Blair]] took place on January 31, 2003, in the [[White House]]. [[Bush-Blair 2003 Iraq memo|A secret memo of this meeting]] purportedly showed that the Bush administration had already decided on the invasion of Iraq at that point. Bush was allegedly floating the idea of painting a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2 spyplane]] in UN colors and letting it fly low over Iraq to provoke Iraqi forces into shooting it down, thereby providing a pretext for the U.S. and Britain to invade. Bush and Blair made a secret deal to carry out the invasion regardless of whether WMD were discovered by UN weapons inspectors, in direct contradiction with statements Blair made to the [[British House of Commons]] afterwards that the Iraqi regime would be given a final chance to disarm. In the memo, Bush is paraphrased as saying, &quot;The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for 10 March. This was when the bombing would begin.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/4849744.stm|title=Bush-Blair Iraq war memo revealed|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|date=2006-03-27 | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush said to Blair that he &quot;thought it unlikely that there would be internecine warfare between the different religious and ethnic groups&quot; in Iraq after the war.

In October 2002 former U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] warned about possible dangers of pre-emptive military action against Iraq.

On January 20, 2003, [[Minister of Foreign Affairs (France)|French Foreign Minister]] [[Dominique de Villepin]] declared &quot;we believe that military intervention would be the worst solution.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2003/vilepin012003.asp|title=Press conference of Foreign affairs Minister Dominique de Villepin (excerpts)|accessdate=2007-02-13|date=2003-01-20|publisher=Embassy of France in the U.S |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060927144309/http://www.ambafrance-us.org/news/statmnts/2003/vilepin012003.asp |archivedate = September 27, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile [[List of anti-war organizations|anti-war groups]] across the world organised public protests. According to French academic [[Dominique ReyniÃ©]], between January 3 and April 12, 2003, {{Nowrap|36 million}} people across the globe took part in almost 3,000 protests against war in Iraq, with demonstrations on February 15, 2003, being the largest and most prolific.&lt;ref name=&quot;Difference&quot;&gt;[http://www.socialistworker.co.uk/article.php?article_id=6067 Anti-war protests do make a difference]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}, Alex Callinicos, Socialist Worker, March 19, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2003, the U.S. Army's top general, [[Eric Shinseki]], told the Senate Armed Services Committee that it would take &quot;several hundred thousand soldiers&quot; to secure Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-02-25-iraq-us_x.htm |title=â Army chief: Force to occupy Iraq massive |publisher=Usatoday.com |date=2003-02-25 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two days later, [[U.S. Defense Secretary]] [[Donald Rumsfeld]] said the post-war troop commitment would be less than the number of troops required to win the war, and that &quot;the idea that it would take several hundred thousand U.S. forces is far from the mark.&quot; Deputy Defense Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]] said Shineski's estimate was &quot;way off the mark,&quot; because other countries would take part in an occupying force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/ALLPOLITICS/02/27/sprj.irq.war.cost/ |title=â Administration fends off demands for war estimates â Mar. 3, 2003 |publisher=Cnn.com |date= 2003-02-26|accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2003, Hans Blix reported that &quot;No evidence of proscribed activities have so far been found&quot; in Iraq, saying that progress was made in inspections which would continue. He estimated the time remaining for disarmament being verified through inspections to be &quot;months&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;blix1&quot;/&gt; But the U.S. government announced that &quot;diplomacy has failed&quot;, and that it would proceed with a coalition of allied countriesânamed the &quot;[[coalition of the willing]]&quot;âto rid Iraq of its alleged WMD. The U.S. government abruptly advised UN weapons inspectors to leave [[Baghdad]] immediately.

There were serious [[Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq|legal questions]] surrounding the launching of the war against Iraq and the [[Bush Doctrine]] of [[preemptive war]] in general. On September 16, 2004, [[Kofi Annan]], the Secretary General of the United Nations, said of the invasion, &quot;I have indicated it was not in conformity with the [[UN Charter]]. From our point of view, from the Charter point of view, it was illegal.&quot;

In November 2008 [[Thomas Bingham, Baron Bingham of Cornhill|Lord Bingham]], the former British [[Lord of Appeal in Ordinary|Law Lord]], described the war a serious violation of [[international law]], and accused Britain and the U.S. of acting like a &quot;world [[vigilante]]&quot;. He also criticized the post-invasion record of Britain as &quot;an occupying power in Iraq&quot;. Regarding the treatment of Iraqi detainees in [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|Abu Ghraib]], Bingham said: &quot;Particularly disturbing to proponents of the rule of law is the cynical lack of concern for international legality among some top officials in the [[George W.

The first [[Central Intelligence Agency]] invasion team entered Iraq on July 10, 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;operation1&quot;&gt;Operation Hotel California, The Clandestine War inside Iraq, Mike Tucker and Charles Faddis, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; This team was composed of members of the CIA's [[Special Activities Division]] and was later joined by members of the U.S. military's elite [[Joint Special Operations Command]] (JSOC).&lt;ref name=&quot;plan2004&quot;&gt;Plan of Attack, Bob Woodward, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Together, they prepared for the invasion of conventional forces. These efforts consisted of persuading the commanders of several Iraqi [[military division]]s to surrender rather than oppose the invasion, and to identify all of the initial leadership targets during very high risk reconnaissance missions.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan2004&quot;/&gt;

Most importantly, their efforts organized the [[Kurd]]ish [[Peshmerga]] to become the northern front of the invasion. Together this force defeated [[Ansar al-Islam]] in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] before the invasion and then defeated the [[Iraqi army]] in the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;plan2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A NATION AT WAR: SECOND FRONT; Allied Troops Are Flown In To Airfields In North Iraq, By C.

Coalition forces also cooperated with Kurdish Peshmerga forces in the north. Approximately forty other governments, the &quot;[[U.S.-led coalition against Iraq]],&quot; participated by providing troops, equipment, services, security, and special forces, with 248,000 soldiers from the United States, 45,000 British soldiers, 2,000 Australian soldiers and 194 Polish soldiers from [[Special Forces]] unit [[GROM]] sent to Kuwait for the invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Department of Defence (2004).

The stated objectives of the invasion were; end the Hussein regime; eliminate whatever weapons of mass destruction could be found; eliminate whatever [[Islamist]] militants could be found; obtain intelligence on militant networks; distribute [[humanitarian aid]]; secure Iraq's [[petroleum]] infrastructure; and assist in creating a representative but compliant government as a model for other [[Middle East]] nations.

The invasion was a quick and decisive operation encountering major resistance, though not what the U.S., British and other forces expected. The Iraqi regime had prepared to fight both a conventional and irregular war at the same time, conceding territory when faced with superior conventional forces, largely armored, but launching smaller scale attacks in the rear using fighters dressed in civilian and paramilitary clothes. This achieved some temporary successes and created unexpected challenges for the invading forces, especially the U.S. military.

Coalition troops launched air and [[amphibious assault]] on the [[Al-Faw peninsula]] to secure the oil fields there and the important ports, supported by warships of the [[Royal Navy]], [[Polish Navy]], and [[Royal Australian Navy]]. The [[United States Marine Corps]]' [[15th Marine Expeditionary Unit]], attached to 3 Commando Brigade and the [[Poland|Polish]] Special Forces unit [[GROM]] attacked the port of [[Umm Qasr]], while the [[British Army]]'s [[16 Air Assault Brigade]] secured the oilfields in southern Iraq. Polish commandos captured offshore oil platforms near the port, preventing their destruction.

The heavy armor of the [[U.S. 3rd Infantry Division]] moved westward and then northward through the western desert toward Baghdad, while the [[1st Marine Expeditionary Force]] moved more easterly along Highway 1 through the center of the country, and [[1 (UK) Armoured Division]] moved northward through the eastern marshland. The U.S. 1st Marine Division fought through [[Nasiriyah]] in a battle to seize the major road junction and nearby [[Ali Air Base|Talil Airfield]]. The United States Army 3rd Infantry Division defeated Iraqi forces entrenched in and around the airfield and bypassed the city to the west in its drive up north through western Iraq.

With the Nasiriyah and Talil Airfields secured in its rear, the 3rd Infantry Division supported by [[101st Airborne Division]] continued its attack north toward Najaf and Karbala, but a severe sand storm slowed the coalition advance and there was a halt to consolidate and make sure the supply lines were secure. When they started again they secured the Karbala Gap, a key approach to Baghdad, then secured the bridges over the [[Euphrates River]], and the American forces poured through the gap on to Baghdad. In the middle of Iraq, the 1st Marine Division fought its way to the eastern side of Baghdad, and prepared for the attack into Badhdad to seize it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In the north, OIF-1 used the largest special operations force since the successful attack on the [[Taliban]] government of [[Afghanistan]] just over a year earlier. The Iraqi army was quickly overwhelmed in each engagement it faced with U.S. forces, with the elite [[Fedayeen Saddam]] putting up strong, sometimes suicidal, resistance before melting away into the civilian population.

On April 9 Baghdad fell, ending President Hussein's 24-year rule. U.S. forces seized the deserted [[Ba'ath Party]] ministries and stage-managed&lt;ref name=&quot;articles.latimes.com&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2004/jul/03/nation/na-statue3 |title= Army Stage-Managed Fall of Hussein Statue |publisher=LA Times |date=2004-07-03 |accessdate=2010-10-23 |first=David |last=Zucchino}}&lt;/ref&gt; the tearing down of a huge iron statue of Hussein, photos and video of which became symbolic of the event, although later controversial.

According to [[the Pentagon]], {{convert|250000|ST}} (of {{convert|650000|ST}} total) of ordnance was looted, providing a significant source of ammunition for the [[Iraqi insurgency]]. The invasion phase concluded when [[Tikrit]], Hussein's home town, fell with little resistance to the [[U.S. Marines]] of [[Task Force Tripoli]] and on April 15 the coalition declared the invasion effectively over.

In the invasion phase of the war (March 19-April 30), 9,200 Iraqi combatants were killed along with 7,299 [[Iraq Body Count project|civilians]], primarily by U.S. air and ground forces.&lt;ref&gt;Conetta, C.

[[File:Iraq 2003 occupation.png|right|thumb|300px|Occupation zones in [[Coalition Provisional Authority|Iraq]] as of September 2003.]]
Shortly after the invasion, which has resulted in the [[debellatio]] of Iraq, the multinational coalition created the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] (CPA) Ø³ÙØ·Ø© Ø§ÙØ§Ø¦ØªÙØ§Ù Ø§ÙÙÙØ­Ø¯Ø©, based in the [[Green Zone]], as a [[transitional government]] of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government. Citing [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483]] (May 22, 2003) and the [[laws of war]], the CPA vested itself with [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislative]], and [[judicial]] authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on April 21, 2003, until its dissolution on June 28, 2004.

The CPA was originally headed by [[Jay Garner]], a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted only until May 11, 2003, when President Bush appointed [[L. Paul Bremer]]. Bremer served until the CPA's dissolution in July 2004.

Another group created by the [[multinational force in Iraq]] post-invasion was the 1,400-member international [[Iraq Survey Group]] who conducted a fact-finding mission to find [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|Iraqi weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes]]. In 2004 the ISG's [[Duelfer Report]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/cia/reports/iraq_wmd_2004/index.html ISG's Duelfer Report]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; stated that Iraq did not have a viable WMD program.

===Post-invasion phase===
{{Main|Post-invasion Iraq, 2003âpresent}}
{{See|U.S. list of most-wanted Iraqis|Iraq War insurgent attacks}}

On May 1, 2003, President Bush staged a dramatic visit to the [[aircraft carrier]] [[USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)|USS ''Abraham Lincoln'']] operating a few miles west of [[San Diego, California]]. The visit climaxed at sunset with Bush's now well-known &quot;[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|Mission Accomplished]]&quot; speech. In this nationally televised speech, delivered before the [[sailors]] and [[airmen]] on the [[flight deck]], Bush effectively declared victory due to the defeat of Iraq's conventional forces. However, Saddam remained at large and significant pockets of resistance remained.

After President Bush's speech, coalition forces noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on its troops in various regions, especially in the &quot;[[Sunni Triangle]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Operation Iraqi Freedom Maps|publisher=GlobalSecurity.Org|date=Unavailable|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/iraqi_freedom-ops-maps.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial Iraqi insurgents were supplied by hundreds of weapons caches created before the invasion by the Iraqi army and [[Iraqi Special Republican Guard|Republican Guard]].

Initially, Iraqi resistance (described by the coalition as &quot;Anti-Iraqi Forces&quot;) largely stemmed from [[fedayeen]] and Hussein/[[Ba'ath Party]] loyalists, but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency. The three provinces with the highest number of attacks were [[Baghdad Governorate|Baghdad]], [[Al Anbar Governorate|Al Anbar]], and [[Salah ad Din Governorate|Salah Ad Din]]. Those three provinces account for 35% of the population, but as of December 5, 2006 were responsible for 73% of U.S. military deaths and an even higher percentage of recent U.S. military deaths (about 80%.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oif/Province.aspx|title=iCasualties: Iraq Coalition Casualty Count - Deaths by Province Year/Month|publisher=Icasualties.org|date=|accessdate=2008-10-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080708203616/http://icasualties.org/oif/Province.aspx |archivedate = July 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insurgents used [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla tactics]] including: mortars, missiles, [[suicide attack]]s, [[Juba (sniper)|snipers]], [[improvised explosive devices]] (IEDs), car bombs, small arms fire (usually with [[assault rifles]]), and RPGs ([[rocket propelled grenades]]), as well as sabotage against the [[petroleum]], water, and electrical infrastructure.

Meanwhile, coalition military forces launched several operations around the [[Tigris]] River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. Toward the end of 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the &quot;[[History of Iraqi insurgency#Ramadan Offensive (OctoberâNovember 2003)|Ramadan Offensive]]&quot;, as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of [[Ramadan]].

To counter this offensive, coalition forces begin to use air power and artillery again for the first time since the end of the invasion by striking suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Hussein's birthplace of [[al-Auja]] and the small town of [[Abu Hishma]] were surrounded by barbed wire and carefully monitored.

===Capturing former government leaders===
{{See also|Supreme Iraqi Criminal Tribunal|Trial of Saddam Hussein}}

In the summer of 2003, the multinational forces focused on [[Most-wanted Iraqi playing cards|capturing the remaining leaders]] of the former government. On July 22, a raid by the U.S. [[101st Airborne Division]] and soldiers from [[Task Force 20]] killed Hussein's sons ([[Uday Hussein|Uday]] and [[Qusay Hussein|Qusay]]) along with one of his grandsons. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former government were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.

Most significantly, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on December 13, 2003, on a farm near [[Tikrit]] in [[Operation Red Dawn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pentagon: Saddam is POW|publisher=CNN|date=2004-01-10|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/01/09/sprj.nirq.saddam/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation was conducted by the [[United States Army]]'s [[4th Infantry Division (United States)|4th Infantry Division]] and members of [[Task Force 121]]. Intelligence on Saddam's whereabouts came from his family members and former bodyguards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saddam 'caught like a rat' in a hole|publisher=CNN|date=2003-12-15|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/12/14/sprj.irq.saddam.operation/index.html?iref=newssearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the capture of Hussein and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. The provisional government began training the new Iraqi security forces intended to police the country, and the United States promised over {{Nowrap|$20 billion}} in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Oil revenue was also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.

Shortly after the capture of Hussein, elements left out of the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] began to agitate for elections and the formation of an [[Iraqi Interim Government]]. Most prominent among these was the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] cleric [[Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani]]. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Why the U.S. is Running Scared of Elections in Iraq|publisher=Guardian (London) via Common Dreams|date=2004-01-19|url=http://www.commondreams.org/views04/0119-08.htm|accessdate=2006-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around [[Fallujah]] and the poor [[Shia]] sections of cities from [[Baghdad]] ([[Sadr City]]) to [[Basra]] in the south.

The start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. Insurgent forces reorganised during this time, studying the multinational forces' tactics and planning a renewed offensive. However, violence did increase during the [[Iraq Spring Fighting of 2004]] with foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] (an affiliated [[al-Qaeda]] group), led by [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] helping to drive the insurgency.

As the insurgency grew there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings. An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Shia [[Mahdi Army]] also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.

The most serious fighting of the war so far began on March 31, 2004, when [[Iraqi insurgency|Iraqi insurgents]] in [[Fallujah]] ambushed a [[Blackwater USA]] convoy led by four U.S. [[private military contractor]]s who were providing security for food caterers [[Eurest Support Services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/warriors/contractors/highrisk.html |title=frontline: private warriors: contractors: the high-risk contracting business |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four armed contractors, [[Scott Helvenston]], Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona, and Michael Teague, were killed with grenades and small arms fire. Subsequently, their bodies were dragged from their vehicles by local people, beaten, set ablaze, and their burned corpses hung over a bridge crossing the [[Euphrates]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/03/31/iraq.main/ Residents hang slain Americans' bodies from bridge] â CNN.com&lt;/ref&gt;
Photos of the event were released to [[news agency|news agencies]] worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and [[moral panic|moral outrage]] in the United States, and prompting an unsuccessful &quot;pacification&quot; of the city: the [[First Battle of Fallujah]] in April 2004.
[[Image:USMC 469.jpg|thumb|right|[[United States Marine Corps|US Marines]] fight in the city of [[Fallujah]] during [[Operation Phantom Fury]]/[[Operation Phantom Fury|Operation Al Fajr (New Dawn)]] in November 2004.]]
The offensive was resumed in November 2004 in the bloodiest battle of the war so far: the [[Second Battle of Fallujah]], described by the U.S. military as &quot;the heaviest [[urban warfare|urban combat]] (that they had been involved in) since the [[battle of Hue City]] in [[Vietnam]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Jan2005/n01112005_2005011103.html ScanEagle Proves Worth in Fallujah Fight]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}, ''DefenseLINK News''&lt;/ref&gt; During the assault, U.S. forces used [[White phosphorus use in Iraq|white phosphorus]] as an incendiary weapon against insurgent personnel, attracting controversy. The 46-day battle resulted in a victory for the coalition, with 95 U.S. soldiers killed along with approximately 1,350 insurgents. Fallujah was totally devastated during the fighting, though civilian casualties were low, as they had mostly fled before the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 398â405&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major event of that year was the revelation of widespread [[prisoner abuse]] at [[Abu Ghraib]] which received international media attention in April 2004. First reports of the [[Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse]], as well as graphic pictures showing U.S. military personnel taunting and abusing Iraqi prisoners, came to public attention from a ''[[60 Minutes&amp;nbsp;II]]'' news report (April 28) and a [[Seymour M. Hersh]] article in ''[[The New Yorker]]'' (posted online on April 30.)&lt;ref&gt;Hersh, S.

Ricks (journalist)|Thomas Ricks]] claimed that these revelations dealt a blow to the moral justifications for the occupation in the eyes of many people, especially Iraqis, and was a turning point in the war.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas E.

On January 31, Iraqis [[Iraqi legislative election, January 2005|elected]] the [[Iraqi Transitional Government]] in order to draft a permanent constitution. Although some violence and a widespread Sunni [[boycott]] marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On February 4, [[Paul Wolfowitz]] announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. to pull out 15,000 from Iraq|publisher=BBC News|date=2005-02-04|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4235787.stm | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; February to April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.

Hopes for a quick end to the insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed in May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion. Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S. soldiers.

The summer of 2005 saw fighting around [[Baghdad]] and at [[Tall Afar]] in northwestern Iraq as U.S. forces tried to seal off the Syrian border. This led to fighting in the autumn in the small towns of the [[Euphrates]] valley between the capital and that border.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ricks-2006&quot;&gt;Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 413&lt;/ref&gt;

A referendum was held on October 15 in which the new [[Constitution of Iraq|Iraqi constitution]] was [[Iraqi constitutional referendum, 2005|ratified]]. An [[Iraqi National Assembly|Iraqi national assembly]] was [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|elected in December]], with participation from the Sunnis as well as the Kurds and Shia.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ricks-2006&quot;/&gt;

Insurgent attacks increased in 2005 with 34,131 recorded incidents, compared to a total 26,496 for the previous year.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Ricks (2006) ''Fiasco'': 414&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. Sectarian violence expanded to a new level of intensity following the [[al-Askari Mosque bombing (2006)|al-Askari Mosque bombing]] in the Iraqi city of Samarra, on February 22, 2006. The explosion at the mosque, one of the holiest sites in Shi'a Islam, is believed to have been caused by a bomb planted by al-Qaeda.

Although no injuries occurred in the blast, the mosque was severely damaged and the bombing resulted in violence over the following days. Over 100 dead bodies with bullet holes were found on February 23, and at least 165 people are thought to have been killed. In the aftermath of this attack the U.S. military calculated that the average homicide rate in [[Baghdad]] tripled from 11 to 33 deaths per day. In 2006 the UN described the environment in Iraq as a &quot;civil war-like situation.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Decrying violence in Iraq, UN envoy urges national dialogue, international support|publisher=UN News Centre|date=2006-11-25|url=http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=20726&amp;Cr=Iraq&amp;Cr1=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 6, five United States Army soldiers of the [[502nd Infantry Regiment]], raped the 14-year-old Iraqi girl [[Abeer Qasim Hamza al-Janabi|Abeer Hamza al-Janabi]], and then murdered her, her father, her mother Fakhriya Taha Muhasen and her six-year-old sister.

On June 6, 2006 The US was successful in tracking [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]], the leader of [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] who was killed in a [[targeted killing]], while attending a meeting in an isolated safehouse approximately {{convert|8|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of Baqubah. At 14:15 GMT two United States Air Force [[F-16]]C jets identified the house and the lead jet dropped two 500-pound (230&amp;nbsp;kg) guided bombs, a laser-guided GBU-12 and GPS-guided GBU-38 on the building where he was located at. Six othersâthree male and three female individualsâwere also reported killed. Among those killed were one of his wives and their child.

The current government of Iraq took office on May 20, 2006, following approval by the [[Members of the 1st Iraqi Council of Representatives|members]] of the [[Iraqi National Assembly]]. This followed the [[Iraqi legislative election, December 2005|general election in December 2005]]. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government which had continued in office in a [[caretaker government|caretaker capacity]] until the formation of the permanent government.

The [[Iraq Study Group Report]] was released on December 6, 2006. Iraq Study Group, made up of people from both of the major U.S. parties, was led by co-chairs [[James Baker]], a former Secretary of State (Republican), and [[Lee H. Hamilton]], a former U.S. Representative (Democrat). It concluded that &quot;the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating&quot; and &quot;U.S. forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end.&quot; The report's 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with [[Iran]] and [[Syria]] and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On December 18, a Pentagon report found that insurgent attacks were averaging about 960 a week, the highest since the reports had begun in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Attacks in Iraq at All-Time High, Pentagon Report Says|publisher=PBS|date=2006-12-19|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/july-dec06/iraq_12-19.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalition forces formally transferred control of a province to the Iraqi government, the first since the war. Military prosecutors charged eight U.S. Marines with the murders of 24 Iraqi civilians in [[Haditha]] in November 2005, 10 of them women and children. Four officers were also charged with [[dereliction of duty]] in relation to the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=8 Marines Charged With 24 Iraqi Slayings|publisher=FOX|date=2006-12-22|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2006Dec22/0,4670,MarinesHaditha,00.html | first=Thomas | last=Watkins}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam Hussein was hanged on December 30, 2006, after being found guilty of [[crimes against humanity]] by an Iraqi court after a year-long trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Saddam Hussein executed in Iraq|publisher=BBC|date=2006-12-30|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6218485.stm | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007: U.S. troop surge==
{{See|2007 in Iraq|Iraq War troop surge of 2007|Strategic reset}}

In a January 10, 2007, televised address to the U.S. public, Bush proposed 21,500 more troops for Iraq, a job program for Iraqis, more reconstruction proposals, and {{Nowrap|$1.2 billion}} for these programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/01/20070110-7.html|title=President's Address to the Nation|date=2007-01-10|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 23, 2007, in the [[2007 State of the Union Address]], Bush announced &quot;deploying reinforcements of more than 20,000 additional soldiers and Marines to Iraq.&quot;
[[File:Bush-anbar.jpg|thumb|250px|right|President [[George W. Bush]] visiting US troops in Iraq, September 2007.]]
On February 10, 2007, [[David Petraeus]] was made commander of [[Multinational Force Iraq|Multi-National Force â Iraq]] (MNF-I), the four-star post that oversees all coalition forces in country, replacing General [[George William Casey Jr.|George Casey]]. In his new position, Petraeus oversaw all coalition forces in Iraq and employed them in the new [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|&quot;Surge&quot; strategy]] outlined by the Bush administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=John|last=Holusha|title=Petraeus Calls Iraq Situation Dire|publisher=New York Times|date=January 23, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Michael|last=Gordon|title=Bush to Name a New General to Oversee Iraq|work=The New York Times|date=January 5, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2007 also saw a sharp increase in insurgent [[Chlorine bombings in Iraq|chlorine bombings]].

On May 10, 2007, 144 Iraqi Parliamentary lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition calling on the United States to set a timetable for withdrawal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,271210,00.html Iraq Bill Demands U.S. Troop Withdraw] Associated Press, ''[[Fox News]]'', May 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On June 3, 2007, the Iraqi Parliament voted 85 to 59 to require the Iraqi government to consult with Parliament before requesting additional extensions of the UN Security Council Mandate for Coalition operations in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1180960615762&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Iraqi parliament wants say in extension of U.S.-led forces]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}} Associated Press, ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', June 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the mandate was renewed on December 18, 2007, without the approval of the Iraqi parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush, Maliki Break Iraqi Law to Renew U.N.

Pressures on U.S. troops were compounded by the continuing withdrawal of coalition forces. In early 2007, [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|British Prime Minister]] Blair announced that following [[Operation Sinbad]] British troops would begin to withdraw from [[Basra Governorate]], handing security over to the Iraqis.&lt;ref&gt;BBC NEWS February 21, 2007, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/6380933.stm ''Blair announces Iraq troops cut'']&lt;/ref&gt; In July Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] also announced the withdrawal of 441 Danish troops from Iraq, leaving only a unit of nine soldiers manning four observational helicopters.&lt;ref&gt;[[Al-Jazeera]] ENGLISH, February 21, 2007, [http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/70F3CDDC-B326-45FC-9A2F-85F9E74FBF8C.htm Blair announces Iraq troop pullout]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Planned troop reduction===
In a speech made to Congress on September 10, 2007, Petraeus &quot;envisioned the withdrawal of roughly 30,000 U.S. troops by next summer, beginning with a Marine contingent [in September].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Flaherty, A. (September 10, 2007) [http://www.comcast.net/news/index.jsp?cat=GENERAL&amp;fn=/2007/09/10/759884.html &quot;Petraeus Talks of Troop Withdrawal,&quot;] ''Associated Press''&lt;/ref&gt; On September 14, Bush backed a limited withdrawal of troops from Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush pledges Iraq troop reduction|publisher=BBC News|date=2007-09-14|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/6993721.stm|accessdate=2007-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bush said 5,700 personnel would be home by Christmas 2007, and expected thousands more to return by July 2008. The plan would take troop numbers back to their level before the surge at the beginning of 2007.

===Effects of the surge on security===

By March 2008, violence in Iraq was reported curtailed by 40â80%, according to a Pentagon report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/06/23/iraq.security/|title=Pentagon: Violence down in Iraq since 'surge'|publisher=CNN|date=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent reports&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/6983841.stm U.S. surge has failed â Iraqi poll] [[BBC]] September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/US/story?id=3571504 Few See Security Gains] [[ABC News|ABC]] September 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; raised questions about those assessments. An Iraqi military spokesman claimed that civilian deaths since the start of the troop surge plan were 265 in Baghdad, down from 1,440 in the four previous weeks. The ''[[New York Times]]'' counted more than 450 Iraqi civilians killed during the same 28-day period, based on initial daily reports from [[Iraqi Interior Ministry]] and hospital officials.

Historically, the daily counts tallied by the ''NYT'' have underestimated the total death toll by 50% or more when compared to studies by the United Nations, which rely upon figures from the [[Iraqi Health Ministry]] and morgue figures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070315/NEWS/703150441/1052|title=www.telegram.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070315/NEWS/703150441/1052 &quot;Baghdad violence decrease debatable&quot;].

Investigative reporter [[Bob Woodward]] cites U.S. government sources according to which the U.S. &quot;surge&quot; was not the primary reason for the drop in violence in 2007â2008. Instead, according to that view, the reduction of violence was due to newer covert techniques by U.S. military and intelligence officials to find, target and kill insurgents, including working closely with former insurgents.&lt;ref&gt;BBC News, September 5, 2008, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7600077.stm &quot;U.S. 'Spying' on Iraqi Leadership&quot;] citing the book ''The War Within: A Secret White House History, 2006â2008'' by Bob Woodward&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Shia region near [[Basra]], British forces turned over security for the region to Iraqi Security Forces. Basra is the ninth province of Iraq's 18 provinces to be returned to local security forces' control since the beginning of the occupation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gW-7Ed_dRI4S2lsuyMWJ2-0GO7aw|title=AFP: Iraq takes control of Basra from British army|publisher=AFP via Google|date=2007-12-15|accessdate=2008-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political developments===
[[Image:Congbench.PNG|thumb|right|Official Iraq-benchmark of the Congress, 2007.]]
More than half of the members of Iraq's parliament rejected the continuing occupation of their country for the first time. 144 of the 275 lawmakers signed onto a legislative petition that would require the Iraqi government to seek approval from Parliament before it requests an extension of the UN mandate for foreign forces to be in Iraq, which expires at the end of 2008. It also calls for a timetable for troop withdrawal and a freeze on the size of foreign forces. The UN Security Council mandate for U.S.-led forces in Iraq will terminate &quot;if requested by the government of Iraq.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Abdul-Zahra, Q. (May 10, 2007) [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/05/10/AR2007051000387.html &quot;Iraqi Bill on Troop Pullout Discussed&quot;] ''Washington Post'' accessed May 10, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Under Iraqi law, the speaker must present a resolution called for by a majority of lawmakers.&lt;ref&gt;Jarrar, R. and Holland, J.

In mid-2007, the Coalition began a controversial program to recruit Iraqi Sunnis (often former insurgents) for the formation of &quot;Guardian&quot; militias. These Guardian militias are intended to support and secure various Sunni neighborhoods against the Islamists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US uses Sunnis to patrol streets|publisher=New York Times|date=2007-08-20|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/world/us-uses-sunnis-to-patrol-streets/2007/08/19/1187462082102.html | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensions with Iran===
{{See|United States-Iran relations|Karbala provincial headquarters raid}}
In 2007, tensions increased greatly between [[Iran]] and [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] due to the latter's giving sanctuary to the militant Kurdish secessionist group [[Party for a Free Life in Kurdistan]] (PEJAK.) According to reports, Iran had been shelling PEJAK positions in Iraqi Kurdistan since August 16. These tensions further increased with an alleged border incursion on August 23 by Iranian troops who attacked several Kurdish villages killing an unknown number of civilians and militants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Chris|coauthors=Yaseen Taha|title=Iranians attack Kurdish rebels in Iraq|publisher=McClatchy Washington Bureau|date=2007-08-23|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/iraq/story/19172.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coalition forces also [[Kill or Capture strategy|began to target]] alleged Iranian [[Quds force]] operatives in Iraq, either [[US raid on Iranian liaison office in Arbil|arresting or killing suspected members]]. The Bush administration and coalition leaders began to publicly state that Iran was supplying weapons, particularly [[Explosively formed penetrator|EFP]] devices, to Iraqi insurgents and militias although to date have failed to provide any proof for these allegations. Further sanctions on Iranian organizations were also announced by the Bush administration in the autumn of 2007. On November 21, 2007, Lieutenant General [[James Dubik]], who is in charge of training Iraqi security forces, praised Iran for its &quot;contribution to the reduction of violence&quot; in Iraq by upholding its pledge to stop the flow of weapons, explosives and training of extremists in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5gyE_23JcWcBZt06lpBqxSXqpkOXg|title=US general says Iran helping stop Iraq bloodshed|publisher=Agence France Presse|date=2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tensions with Turkey===
{{See|2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq}}
Border incursions by [[PKK]] militants based in Northern Iraq have continued to harass Turkish forces, with casualties on both sides. In the fall of 2007, the Turkish military stated their right to cross the Iraqi Kurdistan border in &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of PKK militants and began shelling Kurdish areas in Iraq and attacking PKK bases in the [[Mount Cudi]] region with aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB119203192366554757.html?mod=googlenews_wsj, link inactive]{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robertson|first=Nic|coauthors=Ingrid Formanek and Talia Kayali|title=Attacks cross Iraq-Turkey border|publisher=CNN|date=2007-10-14|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/meast/10/14/iraq.turkey/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, weapons that were given to Iraqi security forces by the U.S. military are being recovered by authorities in Turkey after being used by PKK in that state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cloud|first=David S.|coauthors=Eric Schmitt|title=U.S. Weapons, Given to Iraqis, Move to Turkey|publisher=New York Times|date=2007-08-30|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/30/washington/30contract.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Private security firm controversy===
{{Main|Blackwater Baghdad shootings}}
On September 17, 2007, the Iraqi government announced that it was revoking the license of the U.S. security firm [[Blackwater USA]] over the firm's involvement in the killing of eight civilians, including a woman and an infant,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Glanz|first=James|coauthors=Sabrina Tavernise|title=Blackwater Shooting Scene Was Chaotic|publisher=New York Times|date=2007-09-28|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/09/28/world/middleeast/28blackwater.html?em&amp;ex=1191124800&amp;en=4f97093bf0477829&amp;ei=5087%0A}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a firefight that followed a car bomb explosion near a State Department motorcade.

Throughout 2008, U.S. officials and independent think tanks began to point to improvements in the security situation, as measured by key statistics. According to the [[U.S. Defense Department]], in December 2008 the &quot;overall level of violence&quot; in the country had dropped 80% since before [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|the surge]] began in January 2007, and the country's murder rate had dropped to pre-war levels. They also pointed out that the casualty figure for U.S. forces in 2008 was 314 against a figure of 904 in 2007.&lt;ref name=&quot;DecDefLink&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=52539 |title=U.S. Deaths in Iraq Decrease in 2008 |publisher=Defenselink.mil |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Brookings Institution]], Iraqi civilian fatalities numbered 490 in November 2008 as against 3,500 in January 2007, whereas attacks against the coalition numbered somewhere between 200 and 300 per week in the latter half of 2008, as opposed to a peak of nearly 1,600 in summer 2007. The number of Iraqi security forces killed was under 100 per month in the second half of 2008, from a high of 200 to 300 in summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brookings.edu/saban/~/media/Files/Centers/Saban/Iraq%20Index/index20081120.pdf &quot;''Iraq Index: Tracking Variables of Reconstruction and Security in Post-Saddam Iraq''&quot;], [[Brookings Institution]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the proficiency of the Iraqi military increased as it launched a spring offensive against Shia militias which Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] had previously been criticized for allowing to operate. This began with a March [[Battle of Basra (2008)|operation]] against the [[Mehdi Army]] in Basra, which led to fighting in Shia areas up and down the country, especially in the [[Sadr City]] district of Baghdad. By October, the British officer in charge of Basra said that since the operation the town had become &quot;secure&quot; and had a murder rate comparable to [[Manchester]] in England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defenselink.mil/transcripts/transcript.aspx?transcriptid=4304 &quot;DoD News Briefing with Maj. Gen. Salmon from Iraq&quot;], U.S. Department of Defense news transcript&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. military also said there had been a decrease of about a quarter in the quantity of Iranian-made explosives found in Iraq in 2008, possibly indicating a change in Iranian policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. credits Iran for drop in Iraq roadside bombs|publisher=The Guardian|date=2008-12-12|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/dec/12/iran-iraq | location=London | first=Mark | last=Tran | accessdate=May 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the nine day long operation, around 10,000 Turkish troops advanced up to 25&amp;nbsp;km into Northern Iraq. This was the first substantial ground incursion by Turkish forces since 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bentley|first=Mark|title=Turkish Army Begins Ground Assault on PKK in Iraq|publisher=Bloomberg|date=2008-02-22|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601087&amp;sid=aAwz3G7kM9rE&amp;refer=home}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gov't gives no timetable for return|publisher=Turkish Daily News|date=2008-02-26|url=http://www.turkishdailynews.com.tr/article.php?enewsid=97414}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the incursion began, both the Iraqi cabinet and the Kurdistan regional government condemned Turkey's actions and called for the immediate withdrawal of Turkish troops from the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kamber|first=Michael|title=Iraq Cabinet Demands Turks Leave Kurdish Area in North|publisher=New York Times|date=2008-02-27|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/27/world/middleeast/27iraq.html?bl&amp;ex=1204261200&amp;en=0667d0ff53b714a8&amp;ei=5087%0A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Turkish troops withdrew on February 29.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Torchia|first=Christopher|title=Turkish Troops Withdraw from Iraq|agency=Associated Press|date=2008-02-29|url=http://ap.google.com/article/ALeqM5hHDG79AIius7McB6xz3lTQFLIdhQD8V479B00}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fate of the Kurds and the future of the ethnically diverse city of [[Kirkuk]] remained a contentious issue in Iraqi politics.

U.S. military officials met these trends with cautious optimism as they approached what they described as the &quot;transition&quot; embodied in the [[U.S.-Iraq Status of Forces Agreement]] which was negotiated throughout 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;DecDefLink&quot;/&gt; The commander of the coalition, U.S. General [[Raymond T.

At the end of March, the Iraqi Army, with Coalition air support, launched an offensive, dubbed &quot;Charge of the Knights&quot;, in Basra to secure the area from militias. This was the first major operation where the Iraqi Army did not have direct combat support from conventional coalition ground troops. The offensive was opposed by the [[Mahdi Army]], one of the militias, which controlled much of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dagher|first=Sam|title=Across Iraq, battles erupt with Mahdi Army|publisher=Christian Science Monitor|date=2008-03-26|page=2|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2008/0326/p01s13-woiq.html?page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=driveinbasra&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Farrell and Ahmar Karim|title=Drive in Basra by Iraqi Army Makes Gains|publisher=The New York Times|date=2008-05-12|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/12/world/middleeast/12basra.html?ref=middleeast|accessdate=2008-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fighting quickly spread to other parts of Iraq: including [[Sadr City]], [[Al Kut]], [[Al Hillah]] and others. During the fighting Iraqi forces met stiff resistance from militiamen in Basra to the point that the Iraqi military offensive slowed to a crawl, with the high attrition rates finally forcing the Sadrists to the negotiating table.

Following talks with Brig. Gen. [[Qassem Suleimani]], commander of the [[Quds Force|Qods brigades]] of Iran's [[Revolutionary Guard Corps]], and the intercession of the [[Iranian government]], on March 31, 2008, al-Sadr ordered his followers to ceasefire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Fadel|first=Leila|title=After Iranian mediation, firebrand Iraqi cleric orders halt to attacks|publisher=McClatchy Newspapers|date=2008-03-30|url=http://news.yahoo.com/s/mcclatchy/20080331/wl_mcclatchy/2895005_1}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The militiamen kept their weapons.

By May 12, 2008, Basra &quot;residents overwhelmingly reported a substantial improvement in their everyday lives&quot; according to ''[[The New York Times]]''. &quot;Government forces have now taken over Islamic militants' headquarters and halted the death squads and 'vice enforcers' who attacked women, Christians, musicians, alcohol sellers and anyone suspected of collaborating with Westerners&quot;, according to the report; however, when asked how long it would take for lawlessness to resume if the Iraqi army left, one resident replied, &quot;one day&quot;.&lt;ref name=driveinbasra/&gt;

U.S. contractors working for U.S. forces will be subject to Iraqi criminal law, while contractors working for the State Department and other U.S. agencies may retain their immunity. If U.S. forces commit still undecided &quot;major premeditated felonies&quot; while off-duty and off-base, they will be subject to the still undecided procedures laid out by a joint U.S.-Iraq committee if the U.S. certifies the forces were off-duty.&lt;ref name=Juris&gt;&quot;On the other hand, Iraq has primary legal jurisdiction over off-duty soldiers and civilians who commit &quot;major and premeditated crimes&quot; outside of U.S. installations. These major crimes will need to be defined by a joint committee and the United States retains the right to determine whether or not its personnel were on- or off-duty.

===Transfer of Green Zone===
[[File:Baghdad - airport and green zone.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Aerial view of the [[Green Zone]], Baghdad International Airport and the contiguous Victory Base Complex in Baghdad.]]
On January 1, 2009, the United States handed control of the [[Green Zone]] and Saddam Hussein's presidential palace to the Iraqi government in a ceremonial move described by the country's prime minister as a restoration of Iraq's sovereignty. Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said he would propose January 1 be declared national &quot;Sovereignty Day&quot;. &quot;This palace is the symbol of Iraqi sovereignty and by restoring it, a real message is directed to all Iraqi people that Iraqi sovereignty has returned to its natural status,&quot; al-Maliki said.

The U.S. military attributed a decline in reported civilians deaths to several factors including the U.S.-led &quot;troop surge&quot;, the growth of U.S.-funded [[Sunni Awakening|Awakening Councils]], and Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr's call for his militia to abide by a cease fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/meast/01/31/iraq.civilians/index.html?iref=newssearch |title=Iraqi civilian deaths down in January |publisher=CNN |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. withdrawal===
On February 17, 2010, U.S. Secretary of Defense [[Robert Gates]] announced that as of September 1, 2010, the name &quot;Operation Iraqi Freedom&quot; would be replaced by &quot;Operation New Dawn&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/02/exclusive-war-in-iraq-to-be-given-new-name.html Exclusive: War in Iraq to Be Given New Name] ''War in Iraq to Be Given New Name''&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 18, 2010, US and Iraqi forces killed [[Abu Ayyub al-Masri]] the leader of  [[al-Qaeda in Iraq]] in a joint American and Iraqi operation near [[Tikrit]], [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/world/2010/04/19/iraqi-al-qaeda-leader-killed-countrys-intelligence-team-pm-maliki-says/ &quot;2 Most Wanted Al Qaeda Leaders in Iraq Killed by U.S., Iraqi Forces&quot;] FoxNews, 19 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The coalition forces believed al-Masri to be wearing a suicide vest and proceeded cautiously. After the lengthy exchange of fire and bombing of the house, the Iraqi troops stormed inside and found two women still alive, one of whom was al-Masri's wife, and four dead men, identified as al-Masri,  [[Abu Abdullah al-Rashid al-Baghdadi]], an assistant to al-Masri, and al-Baghdadi's son.

Iraqi Prime Minister [[Nouri al-Maliki]] announced the killings of Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayyub al-Masri at a news conference in Baghdad and showed reporters photographs of their bloody corpses. &quot;The attack was carried out by ground forces which surrounded the house, and also through the use of missiles,&quot; Mr Maliki said. &quot;During the operation computers were seized with e-mails and messages to the two biggest terrorists, Osama bin Laden and [his deputy] Ayman al-Zawahiri,&quot; Mr Maliki added. U.S. forces commander Gen. [[Raymond Odierno]] praised the operation. &quot;The death of these terrorists is potentially the most significant blow to al-Qaeda in Iraq since the beginning of the insurgency,&quot; he said. &quot;There is still work to do but this is a significant step forward in ridding Iraq of terrorists.&quot;

US Vice-President [[Joe Biden]] stated that the deaths of the top two al-Qaeda figures in Iraq are &quot;potentially devastating&quot; blows to the terror network there and proof that Iraqi security forces are gaining ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/8630213.stm | work=BBC News | title=Iraqi al-Qaeda leaders 'killed' | date=19 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 June, Iraq's Central Bank was bombed in an attack that left 15 people dead and brought much of downtown Baghdad to a standstill.

Gates continued, &quot;This is one of the reasons that this war remains so controversial at home.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/02/world/middleeast/02iraq.html?hp| work=The New York Times | title=U.S. Formally Begins a New Era in Iraq | first=Michael | last=Gordon | date=September 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the same day Gen. [[Ray Odierno]] was replaced by [[Lloyd Austin]] as Commander of US forces in Iraq

However, there has been some controversy over whether the official declaration is accurate, with the issuance of a standards memo from the Associated Press stating &quot;combat in Iraq is not over, and we should not uncritically repeat suggestions that it is, even if they come from senior officials.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/03/ap-memo-iraq-war_n_705446.html |title=AP Issues Standards Memo: 'Combat In Iraq Is Not Over' |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ongoing tensions===
On September 7, 2010, two U.S. troops were killed and nine wounded in an incident at an Iraqi military base. The incident is under investigation by Iraqi and U.S. forces, but it is believed that an Iraqi soldier opened fire on U.S. forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/08/world/middleeast/08baghdad.html?_r=1&amp;ref=world | work=The New York Times | title=G.I.

===Iraqi security forces transition towards self reliance===
Preparing to buy 13 billion dollars worth of American arms, the [[Ministry of Defence (Iraq)|Iraq Defense Ministry]] intends to transform the country's degraded conventional forces into a state-of-the-art military and become among the worldâs biggest customers for American military arms and equipment. Part of the planned purchase includes 140 [[M1 Abrams]] [[main battle tank]]s. Iraqi crews have already begun training on them. In addition to the $13 billion purchase, the Iraqis have requested 18 [[General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon|F-16 Fighting Falcons]] as part of a $4.2 billion program that also includes aircraft training and maintenance, [[AIM-9 Sidewinder]] [[air-to-air missile]]s, [[laser-guided bomb]]s and reconnaissance equipment.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Security-Industry/2010/10/01/US-plans-42-billion-arms-sale-to-Iraq/UPI-31991285953914/ |title=U.S. plans $4.2 billion arms sale to Iraq |publisher=UPI.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; If approved by Congress, the first aircraft could arrive in spring 2013.

The Iraqi navy also inaugurated U.S.-built Swift Class patrol boat at Umm Qasr, Iraq's main port at the northern end of the gulf. Iraq is to take delivery of 14 more of these $20 million, 50-foot craft before U.S. forces depart. The high-speed vessels' main mission will be to protect the oil terminals at al-Basra and Khor al-Amiya through which some 1.7 million barrels a day are loaded into tankers for export. Two U.S.-built offshore support vessels, each costing $70 million, are expected to be delivered in 2011.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

The United States Department of Defense had issued notification of an additional $100 million proposed sales of arms from the US to Iraq. General Dynamics is to be the prime contractor on a $36 million deal for the supply of ammunition for Iraqâs Abrams M1A1 tanks. The sale consists of: 14,010 TP-T M831A1 120mm Cartridges; 16,110 TPCSDS-T M865 120mm Cartridges; and 3,510 HEAT-MP-T M830A1 120mm Cartridges. Raytheon is proposed as the prime contractor for a $68 million package of âCommand, Control, Communications, Computers, Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance ([[Battle Command|C4ISR]]) Systemsâ.

===UN lifts restrictions on Iraq===
In a move to legitimize the existing Iraqi government, the United Nations lifted the Saddam Hussein-era UN restrictions on Iraq. These included allowing Iraq to have a civilian nuclear program, permitting the participation of Iraq in international nuclear and chemical weapons treaties, as well as returning control of Iraq's oil and gas revenue to the government and ending the [[Oil-for-Food Programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/news/UN-Security-Council-Lifts-Some-Restrictions-On-Iraq-111951129.html |title=VOA &amp;#124; UN Security Council Lifts Some Restrictions On Iraq &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; English |publisher=Voanews.com |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 15, 2011, three U.S. troops were killed in Iraq. One of the troops was killed on a military operation in central Iraq, while the other two troops were deliberately shot by one or two Iraqi soldiers during a training exercise.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aolnews.com/2011/01/15/3-american-soldiers-killed-in-iraq/&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 2011, five U.S. troops were killed in an apparent rocket attack on Camp Victory, located near Baghdad International Airport.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2011/06/20116611830864342.html Five US troops killed in Iraq attack]&lt;/ref&gt; A sixth soldier, who was wounded in the attack, died 10 days later of his wounds.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defense.gov/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=14587 DOD Identifies Army Casualty]&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 29, 2011, three U.S. troops were killed in a rocket attack on a U.S. base located near the border with Iran. It was speculated that the militant group responsible for the attack was the same one which attacked Camp Victory just over three weeks before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-13976476|title=Three US soldiers killed in southern Iraq|publisher=BBC | date=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the three deaths, June 2011, became the bloodiest month in Iraq for the U.S. military since June 2009, with 15 U.S. soldiers killed, only one of them outside combat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/06/30/501364/main20075656.shtml June bloodiest month for U.S. in Iraq in 2 years]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Iraq signed a contract to buy 18 Lockheed Martin F-16 warplanes, becoming the 26th nation to operate the F-16. Because of windfall profits from oil, the Iraqi government is planning to double this originally planned 18, to 36 F-16s. Iraq is relying on the U.S. military for air support as it rebuilds its forces and battles a stubborn Islamist insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Iraq to buy US warplanes worth around $3 billion|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/44681548/ns/world_news-mideast_n_africa/#.ToHJrOxE5_A|work=MSN|publisher=MSNBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

See also [[Casualties of the Iraq War]], which has casualty numbers for coalition nations, contractors, non-Iraqi civilians, journalists, media helpers, aid workers, wounded, etc. The main article also gives explanations for the wide variation in estimates and counts, and shows many ways in which undercounting occurs. Casualty figures, especially Iraqi ones, are highly disputed. This section gives a brief overview.

There have been several attempts by the media, coalition governments and others to estimate the Iraqi casualties. The table below summarizes some of these estimates and methods.

The Bush Administration's [[rationale for the Iraq War]] has faced heavy criticism from an array of popular and official sources both inside and outside the United States, with many U.S. citizens finding many parallels with the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam war-eyewitness booksW.; ''Iraq and Vietnam: Differences, Similarities and Insights'', (2004: Strategic Studies Institute)&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[Center for Public Integrity]] alleges that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] made a total of 935 false statements between 2001 and 2003 about Iraq's alleged threat to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=18319248 |title=Group: 'Orchestrated Deception' by Bush on Iraq |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both proponents and [[Opposition to the Iraq War|opponents]] of the invasion have also criticized the prosecution of the war effort along a number of other lines. Most significantly, critics have assailed the U.S. and its allies for not devoting enough troops to the mission, not adequately planning for [[Post-invasion Iraq, 2003âpresent|post-invasion Iraq]], and for permitting and perpetrating widespread human rights abuses. As the war has progressed, critics have also railed against the high human and financial costs.

The [[court-martial]] of [[Ehren Watada]], the first U.S. officer to refuse to serve in Iraq, ended in a [[mistrial (law)|mistrial]] because the [[Judge Advocate General's Corps]] would not consider the question of whether orders could be illegal. A federal district court judge ruled that Watada cannot face [[double jeopardy]] on three of his five charges, but abstained from ruling on whether the two remaining charges of [[conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman|conduct unbecoming an officer]] may still go forward.&lt;ref&gt;Bernton, H. (October 22, 2008) [http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2008295492_watadaruling22m.html &quot;Watada won't be retried on 3 of 5 counts&quot;] ''Seattle Times''&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism of the initial intelligence leading up to the Iraq war comes from a former CIA officer who described the [[Office of Special Plans]] as a group of [[ideologue]]s who were dangerous to U.S. national security and a threat to world peace, and that the group lied and manipulated intelligence to further its agenda of removing Saddam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20030608/ai_n12583062 &quot;Revealed: The Secret Cabal Which Spun for Blair,&quot;] ''Sunday Herald'', Neil Mackay, June 8, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, in 2008, the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, a group partially funded by [[George Soros]] has enumerated a total of 935 allegedly false statements made by [[George W. Bush]] and six other top members of his administration in what it termed a &quot;carefully launched campaign of misinformation&quot; during the two year period following [[9/11 attacks]], in order to rally support for the invasion of Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicintegrity.org/WarCard/ False Pretenses,] [[Center for Public Integrity]] Jan 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/blog/2008/01/23/BL2008012301758.html?hpid=opinionsbox1/ 935 Iraq Falsehoods], Dan Froomkin, Jan 23, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[CNN]] report noted that the U.S. led interim government, the [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] lasting until 2004 in Iraq had lost $8.8 billion in the [[Development Fund for Iraq]].  In June 2011, it was reported by CBS News that six billion in neatly packaged blocks of US $100 bills was literally air-lifted into Iraq by the George W. Bush administration, which flew it into Baghdad aboard C-130 military cargo planes. In total, the Times says $12 billion in cash was flown into Iraq in 21 separate flights by May 2004.

The Foreign Policy Association reported that &quot;Perhaps the most perplexing component of the Iraq refugee crisis... has been the inability for the U.S. to absorb more Iraqis following the 2003 invasion of the country. To date, the U.S. has granted less than 800 Iraqis refugee status, just 133 in 2007. By contrast, the U.S. granted asylum to more than 100,000 Vietnamese refugees during the [[Vietnam War]].&quot; &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Global Views: Iraq's refugees, by R.

Former President George W. Bush consistently referred to the Iraq war as &quot;the central front in the [[War on Terrorism|War on Terror]]&quot;, and argued that if the U.S. pulled out of Iraq, &quot;terrorists will follow us here.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bush|first=President George W.|work=Global Message|publisher=The White House|date=2003-09-09|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030909.html|title=A Central Front in the War on Terror}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garamone|first=Jim|publisher=American Forces Press Service|date=2002-09-19|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/news/Sep2002/n09192002_200209194.html|title=Iraq Part of Global War on Terrorism, Rumsfeld Says}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bush|first=President George W.|url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/08/20060821.html|title=Press Conference by the President|date=2006-08-21|work=Peace in the Middle East|publisher=The White House}}&lt;/ref&gt; While other proponents of the war have regularly echoed this assertion, as the conflict has dragged on, members of the U.S. Congress, the U.S. public, and even U.S. troops have questioned the connection between Iraq and the fight against anti-U.S. terrorism. In particular, a consensus has developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq war has increased terrorism. [[Counterterrorism]] expert [[Rohan Gunaratna]] frequently refers to the invasion of Iraq as a &quot;fatal mistake.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gunaratna|first=Rohan|title=The Post-Madrid Face of Al Qaeda|journal=Washington Quarterly|volume=27|issue=3|date=Summer 2004|url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/016366004323090278|doi=10.1162/016366004323090278|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

London's conservative [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become &quot;a potent global recruitment pretext&quot; for [[mujahideen]] and that the invasion &quot;galvanised&quot; al-Qaeda and &quot;perversely inspired insurgent violence&quot; there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sengupta|first=Kim|title=Occupation Made World Less Safe, Pro-War Institute Says|publisher=[[The Independent]]|date=2004-05-26|url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0526-05.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[National Intelligence Council]] concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with &quot;a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills&amp;nbsp;... There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries.&quot; The Council's chairman [[Robert Hutchings]] said, &quot;At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Priest|first=Dana|title=Iraq New Terror Breeding Ground|publisher=Washington Post|date=2005-01-14|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A7460-2005Jan13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the 2006 [[National Intelligence Estimate]], which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, held that &quot;The Iraq conflict has become the 'cause celebre' for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of U.S. involvement in the [[Muslim world]] and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Declassified Key Judgments of the National Intelligence Estimate &quot;Trends in Global Terrorism: Implications for the United States&quot;|publisher=Office of the Director of National Intelligence|date=April 2006|url=http://www.dni.gov/press_releases/Declassified_NIE_Key_Judgments.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Iranian involvement==
Although some military intelligence analysts have concluded there is no concrete evidence, it has been claimed that Iran has provided training, weapons, money, and intelligence to Shiite insurgents in Iraq and that up to 150 Iranian intelligence agents, plus members of the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] are believed to be active in Iraq at any given time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/01/25/AR200701250199.html | work=The Washington Post}}{{Dead link|date=September 2010}} {{Dead link|date=July 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/19/AR2007081901394.html |title=Iran Trains Militiamen Inside Iraq, U.S. Says |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 2007-08-20|accessdate=2010-10-23 |first=Megan |last=Greenwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the Iranian [[Quds Force]] and the [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Iranian Revolutionary Guard]] are thought to have trained members of the Qazali terror network in explosives technology and also provided the network with arms, munitions, and military advisors. Many explosive devices, including improvised explosives ([[Improvised explosive device|IED]]s) and armor-piercing penetrators (EFPs), used by insurgents are claimed to be Iranian-made or designed.

In January 2008, [[Multi-National Force â Iraq]] (MNFI) initiated Task Force Troy to identify Iranian-made weapons. Their report was delivered in July 2008. Of 4,600 weapons caches discovered, only 98 contained at least one Iranian-made weapon with these representing less than one half percent of the total number of weapons recovered. No Iranian weapons were discovered in Karbala or Basra and of the 350 armor-piercing explosively formed penetrators (EFPs) found, none were of Iranian origin. Despite frequent claims that Iran is supplying weapons to insurgents, the MNFI report criticized official U.S. statements on Iranian weapons, stating; &quot;Iranian munitions found in Iraq were likely purchased on the open market.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/JK18Ak03.html U.S. again misfires on Iranian arms in Iraq] [[Asia times]] November 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

According to two unnamed U.S. officials, [[the Pentagon]] is examining the possibility that the [[Karbala provincial headquarters raid]], in which insurgents managed to infiltrate an American base, kill five U.S. soldiers, wound three, and destroy three humvees before fleeing, was supported by Iranians.
