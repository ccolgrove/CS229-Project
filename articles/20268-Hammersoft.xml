'''Microsoft Excel''' is a [[Proprietary_software|proprietary]] [[commercial software|commercial]] [[spreadsheet]] application written and distributed by [[Microsoft]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]]. It features calculation, graphing tools, [[pivot table]]s, and a macro programming language called [[Visual Basic for Applications]]. It has been a very widely applied spreadsheet for these platforms, especially since version 5 in 1993, and it has almost completely replaced [[Lotus 1-2-3]] as the industry standard for spreadsheets. Excel forms part of [[Microsoft Office]]. The current versions are 2010 for [[Microsoft Windows]] and 2011 for [[Mac OS X]].

==Basic operation==

&lt;/ref&gt; using a grid of ''cells'' arranged in numbered ''rows'' and letter-named ''columns'' to organize data manipulations like arithmetic operations. It has a battery of supplied functions to answer statistical, engineering and financial needs. In addition, it can display data as line graphs, histograms and charts, and with a very limited three-dimensional graphical display. It allows sectioning of data to view its dependencies on various factors from different perspectives (using ''[[pivot table]]s'' and the ''scenario manager''&lt;ref name=G_Harvey&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;). And it has a programming aspect, ''Visual Basic for Applications'', allowing the user to employ a wide variety of numerical methods, for example, for solving differential equations of mathematical physics,&lt;ref name=Levie&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and then reporting the results back to the spreadsheet. Finally, it has a variety of interactive features allowing user interfaces that can completely hide the spreadsheet from the user, so the spreadsheet presents itself as a so-called ''application'', or ''decision support system'' (DSS), via a custom-designed user interface, for example, a stock analyzer,&lt;ref name=Holsapple&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==VBA programming ==
{{Main|Visual basic for applications}}
The Windows version of Excel supports programming through Microsoft's [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA), which is a dialect of [[Visual Basic]]. Programming with VBA allows spreadsheet manipulation that is awkward or impossible with standard spreadsheet techniques. Programmers may write code directly using the Visual Basic Editor (VBE), which includes a window for writing code, debugging code, and code module organization environment. The user can implement numerical methods as well as automating tasks such as formatting or data organization in VBA&lt;ref name=Press&gt;

For example, by converting to Visual Basic the recipes in {{cite book |title=Numerical recipes: the art of scientific computing |author=William H. Press, SA Teukolsky,WT Vetterling &amp; BP Flannery |year=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521880688 |edition=3rd |url=http://books.google.com/?id=1aAOdzK3FegC&amp;printsec=frontcover}} Code conversion to Basic from Fortran probably is easier than from C++, so the 2nd edition (isbn=0521437210) may be easier to use, or the Basic code implementation of the first edition: {{cite book |title=Numerical recipes: routines and examples in BASIC |author=Julien C. Sprott |year=1991 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0521406897 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=3-BfpBw7AqQC}}.

&lt;/ref&gt; and guide the calculation using any desired intermediate results reported back to the spreadsheet.

VBA was removed from Mac Excel 2008, as the developers did not believe that a timely release would allow porting the VBA engine natively to Mac OS X. VBA was restored in the next version, Mac Excel 2011.

A common and easy way to generate VBA code is by using the [[Macro (computer science)|Macro]] Recorder.&lt;ref name=Walkenbach&gt;However an increasing proportion of Excel functionality is not captured by the Macro Recorder leading to largely useless macros.

{{cite book |title=Excel 2007 VBA Programming for Dummies |author=John Walkenbach |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2IBbPiP3wOIC&amp;pg=PA79 |chapter= Chapter 6: Using the Excel macro recorder |page=79 ''ff'' |edition=Revised by Jan Karel Pieterse |isbn=0470046740 |year=2007  |publisher=Wiley}}

&lt;/ref&gt;
The Macro Recorder records actions of the user and generates VBA code in the form of a macro. These actions can then be repeated automatically by running the macro. The macros can also be linked to different trigger types like keyboard shortcuts, a command button or a graphic. The actions in the macro can be executed from these trigger types or from the generic toolbar options. The VBA code of the macro can also be edited in the VBE. Certain features such as loop functions and screen prompts by their own properties, and some graphical display items, cannot be recorded, but must be entered into the VBA module directly by the programmer. Advanced users can employ user prompts to create an interactive program, or react to events such as sheets being loaded or changed.

VBA code interacts with the spreadsheet through the Excel ''Object Model'',&lt;ref name=Walkenbach2&gt;

{{cite book |title=cited work |author=John Walkenbach |url=http://books.google.com/?id=2IBbPiP3wOIC&amp;pg=PA53 |chapter= Chapter 4: Introducing the Excel object model |page=53 ''ff'' |isbn=0470046740 |date=2007-02-02}}

&lt;/ref&gt; a vocabulary identifying spreadsheet objects, and a set of supplied functions or ''methods'' that enable reading and writing to the spreadsheet and interaction with its users (for example, through custom toolbars or ''command bars'' and ''message boxes''). User-created VBA [[subroutine]]s execute these actions and operate like macros generated using the macro recorder, but are more flexible and efficient.

==Charts==
Excel supports [[chart]]s, [[Graph of a function|graphs]] or [[histogram]]s generated from specified groups of cells. The generated graphic component can either be embedded within the current sheet, or added as a separate object.

These displays are dynamically updated if the content of cells change. For example, suppose that the important design requirements are displayed visually; then, in response to a user's change in trial values for parameters, the curves describing the design change shape, and their points of intersection shift, assisting the selection of the best design.

==Using other Windows applications==
{{Expand section|date=April 2010}}
Windows applications such as [[Microsoft Access]] and [[Microsoft Word]], as well as Excel as can communicate with each other and use each others' capabilities.
The most common are 
[[Dynamic Data Exchange]]: although strongly deprecated by Microsoft, this is a common method to send data between applications running on Windows, with official MS publications referring to it as &quot;the protocol from hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://drdobbs.com/article/print?articleId=184409151&amp;siteSectionName=&lt;/ref&gt; As the name suggests, it allows applications to supply data to others for calculation and display. It is very common in financial markets, being used to connect to important financial data services such as [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] and [[Reuters]].

[[Object Linking and Embedding|OLE]] Object Linking and Embedding: allows a Windows application to control another to enable it to format or calculate data. This may take on  the form of &quot;embedding&quot; where an application uses another to handle as task that it is more suited to, for example a [[Powerpoint]] presentation may be embedded in an Excel spreadsheet or vice versa.&lt;ref name= Schmalz&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Using external data ==
{{Expand section|date=February 2010}}
Excel users can access external [[data source]]s via Microsoft Office features such as (for example) &lt;code&gt;.odc&lt;/code&gt; connections built with the Office Data Connection file format. Excel files themselves may be updated using a Microsoft supplied [[ODBC]] driver.

Excel can accept data in real time through several programming interfaces, which allow it to communicate with many data sources such as Bloomberg and Reuters.

*DDE : &quot;Dynamic Data Exchange&quot; uses the message passing mechanism in Windows to allow data to flow between Excel and other applications. Although it is easy for users to create such links, programming such links reliably is so difficult that Microsoft, the creators of the system, officially refer to it as &quot;the protocol from hell&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.drdobbs.com/184409151?pgno=3 JM Newcomer &quot;An alternative to the protocol from hell&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of its many issues DDE remains the most common way for data to reach traders in financial markets.

*Network DDE Extended the protocol to allow spreadsheets on different computers to exchange data. Given the view above, it is not surprising that in Vista, Microsoft no longer supports the facility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365135%28VS.85%29.aspx Microsoft discontinues support for network DDE]&lt;/ref&gt;

*Real Time Data : RTD although in many ways technically superior to DDE, has been slow to gain acceptance, since it requires non-trivial programming skills, and when first released was neither adequately documented nor supported by the major data vendors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/289150 How to set up RTD in Excel]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Quirks ==
A major complaint is finding relevant assistance from  the associated help system. Contributing to this issue is the Excel 2007 menu system, which adapts to the users' history of use. That adaptivity means that there may be no unique, or perhaps even straightforward, way to explain how to do a particular task. 

Other errors specific to Excel include [[#Statistical functions|misleading statistics functions]], [[#Excel MOD function error|mod function errors]], [[#Date problems|date limitations]] and the Excel 2007 error.&lt;ref name=fix&gt;[http://support.microsoft.com/kb/943075/ Fix of display error for a number from 65535.99999999995 to 65536]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Statistical functions===

&lt;/ref&gt; as mishandling missing data, as returning incorrect values due to inept handling of round-off and large numbers, as only selectively updating calculations on a spreadsheet when some cell values are changed, and as having a limited set of statistical tools. Microsoft has announced some of these issues are addressed in Excel 2010.&lt;ref name=corrections&gt;

[http://blogs.msdn.com/excel/archive/2009/09/10/function-improvements-in-excel-2010.aspx Function improvements in Excel 2010] Comments are provided from readers that may illuminate some remaining problems.

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graphing===
The menus related to graphs and graph formatting have been changed completely in Excel 2007. Some common activities in using graphs are less transparent than previously. For example, to add a curve to a graph, one can right click on the graph and choose &quot;select data&quot; from the drop-down menu, or use the &quot;chart tools/design&quot; tab. However, when there are other drop-down menus open, this menu doesn't appear and the &quot;select data&quot; option is grayed out (unavailable) from the toolbar. That facet of the menu system must be &quot;discovered&quot; by the user. These quirks and other nontransparent features contribute to a long learning curve, and to annoyance if one returns to Excel after an absence long enough to forget these little &quot;tricks&quot; of the menu system.

=== Excel MOD function error ===
Excel has issues with [[modulo operation]]s. In the case of excessively large results, Excel will return the error warning '''''&lt;tt&gt;#NUM!&lt;/tt&gt;''''' instead of an answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/119083 |title=XL: MOD() Function Returns #NUM!

=== Date problems ===
Excel includes January 0, 1900 and February 29, 1900, incorrectly treating 1900 as a [[leap year]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214058/EN-US/ |title=Days of the week before March 1, 1900 are incorrect in Excel |publisher=Microsoft |date= |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/214326/en-us |title=Excel 2000 incorrectly assumes that the year 1900 is a leap year |publisher=Microsoft |date= |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bug originated from [[Lotus 1-2-3]], and was purposely implemented in Excel for the purpose of [[backward compatibility]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/06/16.html |title=My First BillG Review |first=Joel |last=Spolsky |publisher=Joel on Software |date=June 16, 2006 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; This legacy has later been carried over into [[Office Open XML]] file format.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Contradictory Nature of OOXML&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consortiuminfo.org/standardsblog/article.php?story=20070117145745854|title=The Contradictory Nature of OOXML|publisher=ConsortiumInfo.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filenames===
Microsoft Excel will not open two documents with the same name and instead will display the following error:
:A document with the name '%s' is already open. You cannot open two documents with the same name, even if the documents are in different folders. To open the second document, either close the document that is currently open, or rename one of the documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ew/2004/08/02/stories/2004080200260401.htm The Hindu Business Line : Trouble with macros&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
The reason is for calculation ambiguity with linked cells. If there is a cell ='[Book1.xlsx]Sheet1'!$G$33, and there are two books named &quot;Book1&quot; open, there is no way to tell which one the user means.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.msdn.com/b/excel/archive/2009/01/07/why-can-t-i-open-two-files-with-the-same-name.aspx Microsoft Excel - Why Can't I Open Two Files With the Same Name?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Numeric precision ==
{{main|Numeric precision in Microsoft Excel}}
[[File:Excel fifteen figure.PNG|thumb|390px|Excel maintains 15 figures in its numbers, but they are not always accurate: the bottom line should be the same as the top line.]]

Despite the use of 15-figure precision, Excel can display many more figures (up to thirty) upon user request. But the displayed figures are ''not'' those actually used in its computations, and so, for example, the difference of two numbers may differ from the difference of their displayed values. Although such departures are usually beyond the 15th decimal, exceptions do occur, especially for very large or very small numbers. Serious errors can occur if decisions are made based upon automated comparisons of numbers (for example, using the Excel ''If'' function), as equality of two numbers can be unpredictable.

In the figure the fraction 1/9000 is displayed in Excel. Although this number has a decimal representation that is an infinite string of ones, Excel displays only the leading 15 figures. In the second line, the number one is added to the fraction, and again Excel displays only 15 figures. In the third line, one is subtracted from the sum using Excel. Because the sum in the second line has only eleven 1's after the decimal, the difference when 1 is subtracted from this displayed value is three 0's followed by a string of eleven 1's. However, the difference reported by Excel in the third line is three 0's followed by a string of ''thirteen'' 1's and two extra erroneous digits. Thus, the numbers Excel calculates with to obtain the third line are ''not'' the numbers that it displays in the first two lines. Moreover, the error in Excel's answer is not just [[round-off error]].

Excel works with a modified 1985 version of the [[IEEE 754-2008|IEEE 754 specification]].&lt;ref name=microsoft_spec&gt;

Microsoft's overview is found at: {{cite web |url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/78113/en-us |title=Floating-point arithmetic may give inaccurate results in Excel |publisher=Microsoft support |work=Revision 8.2 ; article ID: 78113 |date=June 30, 2010 |accessdate=2010-07-02}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Excel's implementation involves an amalgam of truncations and conversions between binary and decimal representations, leading to accuracy that sometimes is better than one would expect from simple fifteen digit precision, and sometimes much worse.  See the main article for details.

Besides accuracy in user computations, the question of accuracy in Excel-provided functions may be raised. Particularly in the arena of statistical functions, Excel has been criticized for sacrificing accuracy for speed of calculation.&lt;ref name=Altman&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

As many calculations in Excel are executed using [[Visual basic for applications|VBA]], an additional issue is the accuracy of VBA, which varies with variable type and user-requested precision.&lt;ref name=John_Walkenbach_0&gt;

== History ==
=== Excel 2.0 ===
Microsoft originally marketed a spreadsheet program called [[Multiplan]] in 1982. Multiplan became very popular on [[CP/M]] systems, but on [[MS-DOS]] systems it lost popularity to [[Lotus 1-2-3]]. Microsoft released the first version of Excel for the Mac in 30 September 1985, and the first Windows version (numbered 2.05 to line up with the Mac and bundled with a run-time Windows environment) in November 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Vi8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA30&amp;ots=VU7lrh9efW&amp;dq=macintosh%20spreadsheet%20arrow%20keys%20multiplan&amp;pg=PA30#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=InfoWorld First Look: Supercalc 4 challenging 1-2-3 with new tactic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lotus was slow to bring 1-2-3 to Windows and by 1988 Excel had started to outsell 1-2-3 and helped Microsoft achieve the position of leading PC software developer. This accomplishment, dethroning the king of the software world, solidified Microsoft as a valid competitor and showed its future of developing [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] software. Microsoft pushed its advantage with regular new releases, every two years or so.

Early in 1993 Excel became the target of a trademark lawsuit by another company already selling a software package named &quot;Excel&quot; in the [[finance industry]]. As the result of the dispute Microsoft had to refer to the program as &quot;Microsoft Excel&quot; in all of its formal press releases and legal documents. However, over time this practice has been ignored, and Microsoft cleared up the issue permanently when they purchased the trademark of the other program.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}} Microsoft also encouraged the use of the letters '''XL''' as shorthand for the program; while this is no longer common, the program's [[Icon (computing)|icon]] on Windows still consists of a stylized combination of the two letters, and the [[file extension]] of the default Excel format is ''.xls''.

Excel offers many [[user interface]] tweaks over the earliest electronic spreadsheets; however, the essence remains the same as in the original spreadsheet software, [[VisiCalc]]: the program displays cells organized in rows and columns, and each cell may contain data or a formula, with relative or absolute references to other cells.

Excel became the first spreadsheet to allow the user to define the appearance of spreadsheets (fonts, character attributes and cell appearance). It also introduced intelligent cell recomputation, where only cells dependent on the cell being modified are updated (previous spreadsheet programs recomputed everything all the time or waited for a specific user command). Excel has extensive graphing capabilities, and enables users to perform [[mail merge]].

=== Excel 5.0 ===
With version 5.0 (1993), Excel has included [[Visual Basic for Applications]] (VBA), a programming language based on [[Visual Basic]] which adds the ability to automate tasks in Excel and to provide user-defined functions (UDF) for use in worksheets. VBA is a powerful addition to the application and includes a fully featured [[integrated development environment]] (IDE). Macro recording can produce VBA code replicating user actions, thus allowing simple automation of regular tasks. VBA allows the creation of forms and in-worksheet controls to communicate with the user. The language supports use (but not creation) of [[Component object model|ActiveX]] ([[Component object model|COM]]) [[Dynamic-Link Library|DLL]]'s; later versions add support for class modules allowing the use of basic [[object-oriented programming]] techniques.

The automation functionality provided by VBA made Excel a target for [[Macro (computer science)|macro]] [[computer virus|viruses]]. This caused serious problems until antivirus products began to detect these viruses. [[Microsoft]] belatedly took steps to prevent the misuse by adding the ability to disable macros completely, to enable macros when opening a workbook or to trust all macros signed using a trusted certificate.

Versions 5.0 to 9.0 of Excel contain various [[Easter egg (virtual)|Easter eggs]], including a Hall of Tortured Souls, although since version 10 [[Microsoft]] has taken measures to eliminate such undocumented features from their products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Excel 2000===
{{See also|Microsoft Office 2000}}
For many users, one of the most obvious changes introduced with Excel 2000 (and the rest of the Office 2000 suite) involved a clipboard that could hold multiple objects at once. In another noticeable change the Office Assistant, whose frequent unsolicited appearance in Excel 97 had annoyed many users, became less intrusive.

[[Image:Excel2007.PNG|64px|thumb|Excel 2007 icon]] 
[[Image:Microsoft Office Excel 2007.png|thumb|250px|Microsoft Excel 2007]]

===Excel 2007 ===
The most obvious change is a completely revamped user interface called the [[Ribbon (computing)|Ribbon]] menu system, which means a user must abandon most habits acquired from previous versions. Some practical advantages of the new system are a decreased number of mouse-clicks needed to reach a given functionality (e.g. removing the gridlines now takes 2 mouse-clicks instead of 5), greatly improved management of named variables through the ''Name Manager'', and much improved flexibility in formatting graphs, which now allow (''x, y'') coordinate labeling and lines of arbitrary weight. The number of rows is now 1,048,576 and columns is 16,384. Several improvements to ''pivot tables'' were introduced. [[Office Open XML]] file formats were introduced, including ''.xlsm'' for a workbook with macros and ''.xlsx'' for a workbook without macros.&lt;ref name=Dodge&gt;{{cite book  |title=Microsoft Office Excel 2007 inside out |author=Mark Dodge, Craig Stinson |year=2007 |publisher=Microsoft Press |isbn=073562321X |chapter=Chapter 1: What's new in Microsoft Office Excel 2007|page=1 ''ff''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This version makes more extensive use of multiple cores for the calculation of spreadsheets, however VBA macros are not handled in parallel and XLL addins only are executed in parallel if they are thread-safe and indicate this at the time of registration.

===Excel 2010===

Microsoft Excel up until 2007 version used a proprietary binary file format called Binary Interchange File Format (BIFF) as its primary format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/840817/ |title=How to extract information from Office files by using Office file formats and schemas |publisher=Microsoft |date=February 26, 2008 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Excel 2007 uses [[Office Open XML]] as its primary file format, an XML-based format that followed after a previous [[XML]]-based format called &quot;XML Spreadsheet&quot; (&quot;XMLSS&quot;), first introduced in Excel 2002.&lt;ref name=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa140066(office.10).aspx |title=XML Spreadsheet Reference |work=Microsoft Excel 2002 Technical Articles |publisher=MSDN |date=August 2001 |accessdate=2008-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although supporting and encouraging the use of new XML-based formats as replacements, Excel 2007 remained backwards-compatible with the traditional, binary formats. In addition, most versions of Microsoft Excel can read [[comma-separated values|CSV]], [[DBase|DBF]], [[SYmbolic LinK (SYLK)|SYLK]], [[Data Interchange Format|DIF]], and other legacy formats. Support for some older file formats were removed in Excel 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.office.com/b/microsoft-excel/archive/2006/08/24/deprecated-features-for-excel-2007.aspx |title=Deprecated features for Excel 2007 |publisher=Microsoft&amp;nbsp;â David Gainer |date=August 24, 2006 |accessdate=2009-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The file formats were mainly from DOS based programs.

=== Binary ===
[[OpenOffice.org]] has created documentation of the Excel format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sc.openoffice.org/excelfileformat.pdf|title=OpenOffice.org's documentation of the Microsoft Excel File Format|date=2008-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Microsoft made the Excel binary format specification available to freely download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

===XML Spreadsheet===
{{main|Microsoft Office XML formats}}
The ''XML Spreadsheet'' format introduced in Excel 2002&lt;ref name=&quot;xml&quot;/&gt; is a simple, [[XML]] based format missing some more advanced features like storage of VBA macros. Though the intended file extension for this format is ''.xml'', the program also correctly handles XML files with ''.xls'' extension. This feature is widely used by third-party applications (e.g. ''[[MySQL]] Query Browser'') to offer &quot;export to Excel&quot; capabilities without implementing binary file format. The following example will be correctly opened by Excel if saved either as ''Book1.xml'' or ''Book1.xls'':

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot;?&gt;
&lt;Workbook xmlns=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:spreadsheet&quot;

    &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;String&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
   &lt;Row&gt;
    &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;String&quot;&gt;Value&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
    &lt;Cell&gt;&lt;Data ss:Type=&quot;Number&quot;&gt;123&lt;/Data&gt;&lt;/Cell&gt;
   &lt;/Row&gt;
  &lt;/Table&gt;
 &lt;/Worksheet&gt;
&lt;/Workbook&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Office Open XML ===
{{Main|Office Open XML}}

Microsoft Excel 2007, along with the other products in the [[Microsoft Office 2007]] suite, introduced new file-formats. The first of these (.xlsx) is defined in the [[Office Open XML]] (OOXML) specification.

The new Excel 2007 formats are:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|+New Excel 2007 formats
!Format
!Extension
!Description
|-
|Excel Workbook
|&lt;tt&gt;.xlsx&lt;/tt&gt;
|The default Excel 2007 workbook format. In reality a [[ZIP (file format)|ZIP]] compressed archive with a directory structure of [[XML]] text documents. Functions as the primary replacement for the former binary .xls format, although it does not support Excel macros for security reasons.
|-
|Excel Macro-enabled Workbook
|&lt;tt&gt;.xlsm&lt;/tt&gt;
|As Excel Workbook, but with macro support.
|-
|Excel Binary Workbook
|&lt;tt&gt;.xlsb&lt;/tt&gt;
|As Excel Macro-enabled Workbook, but storing information in binary form rather than XML documents for opening and saving documents more quickly and efficiently. Intended especially for very large documents with tens of thousands of rows, and/or several hundreds of columns.
|-
|Excel Macro-enabled Template
|&lt;tt&gt;.xltm&lt;/tt&gt;
|A template document that forms a basis for actual workbooks, with macro support. The replacement for the old .xlt format.
|-
|Excel Add-in
|&lt;tt&gt;.xlam&lt;/tt&gt;
|Excel add-in to add extra functionality and tools. Inherent macro support because of the file purpose.
|}

Excel 2010 continues with these new formats.

== Export and migration of spreadsheets ==
Programmers have produced [[Application programming interface|API]]s to open Excel spreadsheets in a variety of applications and environments other than Microsoft Excel. These include opening Excel documents on the web using either [[ActiveX]] controls, or plugins like the [[Adobe Flash|Adobe Flash Player]]. The [[Apache POI]] [[opensource]] project provides [[Java platform|Java]] libraries for reading and writing Excel spreadsheet files. [[ExcelPackage]] is another open-source project that provides server-side generation of Microsoft Excel 2007 spreadsheets. [[PHPExcel]] is a PHP library that converts Excel5, Excel 2003, and Excel 2007 formats into objects for reading and writing within a web application.
