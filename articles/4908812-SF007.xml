'''Ankur''' is working toward supporting [[Bengali language]] (Bangla) on [[GNU]]/[[Linux]] operating system. Most of Ankur's projects are focused on [[XFree86]].org's XServer. Some of its projects are in fact platform independent and add language support to other operating systems.

The group is also working on providing Bangla support for some major [[XServer]] applications such as office suites, databases, development tools and desktop environments such as [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]]. Ankur's intention is to help develop and maintain open source/free software targeted towards the Bangla speaking user and to provide a completely functional, user intuitive localised desktop that is easily usable and easily deployable.

==History==

Initially, Ankur started as the bengalinux-core mailing list. This later worked as the nucleus for forming Ankur.

[[Taneem Ahmed]] of Bangladesh, the founder of Ankur, was developing and maintaining the http://www.BengaLinux.Org website - a one stop mall for Unix based Bangla Free Software. He was also the author of the bn_BD [[locale]] for the [[GNU C library]]. This established his identity as major figure in the Bangla open source community. In October 2002, he launched the bengalinux-core mailing list. 

This list became a focus of Bangla related Open Source enthusiasts. In January, 2003, Taneem Ahmed announced the [[GNOME]] Bangla Translation Project and began recruiting for the project. The recruitment call was taken seriously and the project began to expand. After some discussion on a group name of discussion, 'Ankur', proposed by Kaushik Ghosh. On 3 March 2003, the name ''Ankur'' was officially adopted.
