'''Susan Delfino''' ([[nÃ©e]] '''Bremmer''', formerly '''Mayer''') is a [[fictional character]] played by [[Teri Hatcher]] on the [[American Broadcasting Company]] (ABC) [[television series]] ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''. The character was created by [[television producer]] and [[screenwriter]] [[Marc Cherry]] and first appeared in the [[Pilot (Desperate Housewives)|pilot episode]] of the series on October 3, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/detail/tv-show.aspx?tvobjectid=100118&amp;more=ucepisodelist&amp;episodeid=4250537 ''Desperate Housewives'' Episode: &quot;Pilot Episode&quot;]. ''[[TV Guide]]''. Retrieved December 24, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Susan resides on the fictional [[Wisteria Lane]] in [[Fairview (Desperate Housewives)|Fairview, Eagle State]], the primary setting of the show. One of four lead characters, Susan is characterized as being a &quot;notoriously clumsy&quot; romantic with a &quot;magnetic charm.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;official bio&quot;&gt;[http://abc.go.com/shows/desperate-housewives/bio/susan-mayer/24709 &quot;Susan Mayer (Teri Hatcher): Official Character Biography&quot;]. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]. Retrieved May 15, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Her storylines tend to focus on her romantic relationships, most notably with [[Mike Delfino]] ([[James Denton (actor)|James Denton]]), whom she marries twice in the series.

Cherry originally created Susan as a [[girl next door]] archetype and intended for the character to provide an emotional anchor for the series. When developing the character, Cherry drew upon his personal experiences as well as those of single women in his life. The role was originally written for [[Mary-Louise Parker]], who turned it down; as a result, Hatcher was cast in early 2004. Hatcher's portrayal of the character is both comedic and vulnerable. During the series' [[Desperate Housewives (season 1)|debut season]], both the character and Hatcher's performance received positive critical reception; however, as the series has progressed, the character has been received less favorably by critics and fans. Hatcher has received both a [[Golden Globe Award]] and [[Screen Actors Guild Award]] for her performance in the series.

==Development and casting==
While developing the series, ''Desperate Housewives'' creator Marc Cherry envisioned Susan as a [[girl next door]] and chose her to convey this image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pH4yOwp7dlM ABC.com's &quot;Ask ''Desperate Housewives'': Season 5, Part 3&quot;].

And then it occurred to me that one of these women should be divorced&amp;nbsp;...
