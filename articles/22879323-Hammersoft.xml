===Milestones===
{{Empty section|date=January 2011}}

==Injuries and surgeries==
[[Devin Harris]] missed 10 games at the beginning of November due to a groin strain before returning on November 21 against the [[New York Knicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Garcia|first=Julian|title=New Jersey Nets' Devin Harris can't do everything in return to lineup|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]]|date=2009-11-22|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/sports/basketball/2009/11/22/2009-11-22_new_jersey_nets_devin_harris_cant_do_it_all_in_return_to_lineup.html|accessdate=2009-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, at one point the entire starting lineup, with the exception of center Brook Lopez, was injured. For a considerable portion of the season the Nets were forced to play extremely short-handed, and multiple times were able to dress only the league-minimum seven players. This was a major contributor to the poor start the Nets had for the season, in addition to well-respected Head Coach Lawrence Frank being fired and replaced by Nets GM/rookie head coach Kiki Vandeweghe.
