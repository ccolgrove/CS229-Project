==Local TV Blackouts==
In 2009, once again the Raiders struggled to sell tickets, resulting in 7 of their 8 home games being blacked out on local television. The Raiders were able to sell out their season opener, on Monday Night Football against the Chargers, thanks to a deadline extension from the NFL. But, the remainder of their home games were not shown on local television, because the games didn't sell out. The Raiders finished the season tied with the Jacksonville Jaguars for most TV blackouts in 2009. But, blackouts are nothing new to Oakland fans, as the Raiders have sold out only 25 of 88 regular season games, since returning to Oakland. The Raiders had 3 games with attendances under 40,000, with their lowest attendance coming in week 11 against the Bengals when they drew only 34,112.

The Raiders began their season with a Week 1 AFL Legacy duel against their AFC West rival, the [[San Diego Chargers]], in the second game of an [[ESPN Monday Night Football|MNF]] doubleheader.  In the first quarter, Oakland got off to a surprising good start.  While the defense (led by newly acquired defensive lineman [[Richard Seymour]]) kept the Chargers offense in control, the Raiders offense struck first with running back [[Michael Bush]] getting a 4-yard touchdown run.  San Diego would respond in the second quarter as running back [[LaDainian Tomlinson]] got a 1-yard touchdown run.  Oakland would answer with what looked like a 19-yard touchdown pass to rookie wide receiver [[Louis Murphy]], but was overturned as he was unable to get full control of the ball.  The Raiders would have to settle with kicker [[Sebastian Janikowski]] making a 37-yard field goal, while the Chargers closed out the half with kicker [[Nate Kaeding]] getting a 47-yard field goal.

After a scoreless third quarter, Oakland regained the lead as Janikowski nailed a 35-yard field goal, but San Diego answered with quarterback [[Philip Rivers]] completing a 15-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Vincent Jackson]].
