The '''2005â06 Syracuse Orange men's basketball''' team represented [[Syracuse University]]. The Head Coach was [[Jim Boeheim]], serving for his 30th year. The team played its home games at the Carrier Dome in Syracuse, New York. The team finished with a 23â12 (7â9) record, while being eliminated in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.

The team was led by Gerry McNamara, the team's lone senior. Also seeing time in the starting lineup were juniors [[Darryl Watkins]], [[Louie McCroskey]], [[Demetris Nichols]] and [[Terrence Roberts (basketball)|Terrence Roberts]], and freshman [[Eric Devendorf]].

== Season Recap ==

Syracuse started off the season losing [[Josh Pace]], [[Hakim Warrick]] and [[Craig Forth]] to graduation, leaving McNamara as the only consistent returning starter from the 2004â05 team. After starting the season 15â2, Syracuse struggled, losing four in a row to [[Connecticut Huskies|Connecticut]], [[Villanova Wildcats|Villanova]], [[Pittsburgh Panthers|Pittsburgh]] and [[Seton Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/30/sports/ncaabasketball/30hoops.html | work=The New York Times | title=Seton Hall Contributes to Syracuse's Misery | date=2006-01-30 | accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orange would go 4â5 the rest of the way, including an emotional 92â82 loss to Villanova at the Carrier Dome, despite 29 points from McNamara in his final home game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/06/sports/ncaabasketball/06men.html | work=The New York Times | title=McNamara Shines, but Villanova Is Victorious | date=2006-03-06 | accessdate=2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After McNamara's home send-off, Syracuse then captured the most unlikely of its Big East Tournament Championships, fueled by the heroics of Gerry McNamara. Prior to the conference tournament two separate publications, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' and the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'' conducted polls of Big East players and assistant coaches. In each poll, McNamara was voted the Big East's &quot;Most Overrated&quot; player.&lt;ref name=overrated1&gt;{{cite web |title=McNamara's not overrated â just ask Boeheim |first=Kara |last=Yorio |date=2006-03-08  |url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=69931&amp;highlight=&amp;sid=ac61e8da8ab06a5c57ad802725ae9372 |work=The Sporting News |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=overrated2&gt;{{cite web |title=Is Gerry Overrated? |first=Ethan |last=Ramsey |date=2006-02-08  |url=http://media.www.dailyorange.com/media/storage/paper522/news/2006/02/08/Sports/Is.Gerry.Overrated.Ramsey.Weaknesses.There.All.Along-1603530.shtml |work=The Daily Orange |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=overrated3&gt;{{cite web |title=McNamara keeps 'Cuse alive ... and Boeheim explodes |first=Luke |last=Winn |date=2006-03-08  |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2006/writers/luke_winn/03/08/cuse/index.html |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first round he hit a running one-handed three-point shot with less than a second left in the game to spur Syracuse past the [[University of Cincinnati]], 74â73. Following the game Jim Boeheim unleashed a passionate defense of his star player to the attending media.&lt;ref name=boeheimcurse&gt;{{cite web |title=McNamara's miracle saves Syracuse |date=2006-03-08  |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060308_SYR@CIN |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next day McNamara hit a three-pointer in the closing seconds of regulation to tie number-one ranked [[University of Connecticut]] and eventually led Syracuse to an overtime 86â84 upset. McNamara finished with 17 points and 13 assists, one assist shy of the Big East Tournament record.&lt;ref name=uconnupset&gt;{{cite web |title=Gerry buries another clutch trey as Orange oust Huskies |date=2006-03-09  |url=http://www.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060309_SYR@CT |work=CNNSI.com |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Syracuse fell behind [[Georgetown University]] in the tournament's semi-finals, Syracuse's third game in three days. McNamara hit five three-pointers in the second halfâincluding one in the last minute of the gameâto slash the Hoyas' lead to one. He dished out an assist to freshman guard [[Eric Devendorf]] to put Syracuse in the lead following a Georgetown turnover and forced another turnover in the closing seconds to clinch the game, 58â57.&lt;ref name=BEgtownupset&gt;{{cite web |title=McNamara magical again as Orange rally to advance to final |date=2006-03-10  |url=http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/gamecenter/recap/NCAAB_20060310_SYR@GTOWN/rss |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

McNamara had 14 points and 6 assists in Syracuse's 65â61 championship game win over the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. Syracuse became the first team to win four games in four days and capture the Big East Tournament Championship.&lt;ref name=BEpittupset&gt;{{cite web |title=Syracuse knocks off No. 15 Pitt for Big East title |date=2006-03-12  |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11785432/ |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, the thrill of Syracuse's unlikely run to the Big East Championship was dampened by a first round of the 2006 NCAA Tournament. Severely hobbled by his leg injury and exhausted from the run in the Big East tournament, McNamara was only able to score two points in just 23 minutes of play as fifth-seeded Syracuse was upset by 12th-seeded [[Texas A&amp;M University]], 66â58.&lt;ref name=texasaandmupset&gt;{{cite web |title=Texas A&amp;M 66, Syracuse 58 |first=Mark |last=Long |date=2006-03-16  |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/sports/college_basketball/20060316-2200-bkc-ncaa-texasa&amp;m-syracuse.html |work=The Associated Press |accessdate=2007-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
