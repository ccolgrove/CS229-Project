'''win32-loader''' is a component of the [[Debian-Installer]] that runs on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and has the ability to load the actual installer either from the network (as in the version used in [http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/tools/win32-loader/stable/win32-loader.exe http://ftp.nl.debian.org/debian/tools/win32-loader/stable/win32-loader.exe]) or from [[CD-ROM]] media (as in the version included in [[Debian#Releases|lenny]] CD images).

win32-loader was born as an independent project, for which only the network version was available.  Later the code would go through a long review and polishing process to become part of the official [[Debian]] distribution.

== Influences ==
win32-loader strongly relies on projects such as [[Nullsoft Scriptable Install System|NSIS]], [[GNU GRUB|GRUB 2]], [[loadlin]] and [[Debian-Installer]] to perform its task.  Additionally, it has drawn inspiration and ideas from similar projects such as [[Wubi (installer)|Wubi]] and [[Instlux]].

== Features ==
* Auto-detects 64-bit ([[x86-64]]) support in host CPUs, and automatically selects x86-64 flavor of Debian whenever supported, completely transparently to the user.
* Detects a number of settings from Windows environment (timezone, proxy settings, etc) and feeds them to Debian Installer via ''preseeding'' mechanism so that user doesn't have to select them.
* Translated to 28 languages.  Selected language is displayed for user interaction since the first template, and is seamlessly passed on to Debian Installer via ''preseeding''.

==Similar projects==

* [[Topologilinux]]: uses [[coLinux]] to run on Windows.
* [[Instlux]], included on [[openSUSE]] since the 10.3 release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/Instlux Instlux - openSUSE&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Wubi (installer)|Wubi]].
