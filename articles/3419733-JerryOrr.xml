'''Don Falcone''' (born November 5, 1958) is an [[United States|American]] musician and producer.  Originally a poet-performer in Pennsylvania, he relocated to San Francisco at the beginning of the 1980s.  He was a member of Thessalonians and the original Melting Euphoria.&lt;ref&gt;[[Piero Scaruffi]], [http://www.scaruffi.com/vol5/falcone.html], ''History of Rock''&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also the co-founder of [[Noh Poetry Records]], a San Francisco, California based independent record label specializing in [[electronic music]], [[experimental music]], [[space rock]] and [[psychedelic music]].

During the early 1990s, as [[electronica]] and [[Ambient music|ambient]] was coming to prominence, [[Silent Records]] founder [[Kim Cascone]] included Falcone on the first Heavenly Music Corporation album. Falcone was subsequently asked to join Cascone in Thessalonians.  Along with fellow Thessalonians Paul Neyrinck, Falcone and Cascone recorded as a trio under various project names, debuting as Satellite IV on the ''Fifty Years of Sunshine'' CD. The majority of the trio's material was released under the name Spice Barons; they recorded two full-length albums and also contributed to the [[John C. Lilly]] ''E.C.C.O.'' album.

In 1994, Falcone formed Melting Euphoria with Mychael Merrill and Anthony Who.  Focusing on [[space rock]], their debut recording was &quot;Through the Strands of Time&quot;; Falcone left the group soon after its release.&lt;ref&gt;John Bush, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p174978|pure_url=yes}}], ''[[Allmusic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Falcone started a solo project in San Francisco called Spaceship Eyes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Piero Scaruffi]], [http://www.scaruffi.com/vol5/falcone.html], ''History of Rock''&lt;/ref&gt;  The project was included on several [[drum and bass]] compilations. The band released the single &quot;Cheebahcabra&quot; on [[Hypnotic Records]] in 1997, followed by the LPs &quot;Truth in the Eyes of a Spaceship&quot; in 1998 and &quot;Of Cosmic Repercussions&quot; in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Huey, [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p278919|pure_url=yes}}], ''[[Allmusic]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  Three of Falcone's Spaceship Eyes pieces appeared in the 1999 cult rave film ''[[Better Living Through Circuitry]]''.  Most notably, ''Mind The Alien'' from ''Truth In The Eyes Of A Spaceship'' was used as the film's opening track. 

His next project, [[Spirits Burning]], signed with French label [[Musea Records]] in 1998.  The group released two albums on Musea affiliate Gazul Records: ''New Worlds By Design'' (1998) and ''Reflections In A Radio Shower'' (2001).  These albums included contributions from over 30 musicians, including [[Daevid Allen]] of [[Gong (band)|Gong]], [[Porcupine Tree]]'s [[Steven Wilson]], and [[Hawkwind]]'s [[Robert Calvert]] (posthumously).  Spirits Burning's third CD, ''Found in Nature'' was released in 2006 by Italian label Mellow Records.  Contributors included [[Daevid Allen]], [[Acid Mothers Temple]] &amp; The Melting Paraiso U.F.O. and [[Judge Trev Thoms]]. Falcone's Spirits Burning project currently includes former [[Hawkwind]] members [[Bridget Wishart]] and [[Alan Davey (musician)|Alan Davey]], as well as Chicago multi-instrumentalist [[Karl E. H. Seigfried]].

Collaborating with [[Daevid Allen]], Falcone released ''Glissando Grooves'' on [[Voiceprint Records]] in 2006.  Falcone and Allen are also part of Weird Biscuit Teatime, which released their first album on Voiceprint in 2005. In addition, Allen has contributed to two other Falcone bands: Fireclan (which included other members of Melting Euphoria) and Quiet Celebration (an [[Ambient music|ambient]]-[[ethno-jazz]] quartet).

Various cable and TV network programs have also used Falcone's music: A&amp;E's ''Biography,'' History Channel's ''Beyond the DaVinci Code'' and VH1's ''Driven.'' &lt;ref&gt;Artist website, [http://www.home.earthlink.net/~falcone/filmtv.html], ''Don Falcone, Music for Film and Television ''&lt;/ref&gt;
