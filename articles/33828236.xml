'''Occupy Davis''' is an on-going protest in [[Davis, California]].  It was formed on September 17, 2011 as part of the [[Occupy Movement]].   Beginning October 15, protestors began an occupation of the city's Central Park.&lt;ref name=enterprise20111013&gt;{{cite news|last=Sakash|first=Tom|title=Occupy Davis chooses Central Park as its focus|url=http://www.davisenterprise.com/local-news/occupy-davis-chooses-central-park-as-its-focus/|accessdate=November 22, 2011|newspaper=Davis Enterprise|date=October 13, 2011|page=A5}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

Occupy Davis should not be confused with [[Occupy UC Davis]], the subsequent protest movement centered at the nearby university.

==Initial formation and occupation==
One supporter expressed the concerns about economic injustice, saying: &quot;There is a gigantic and increasing wealth disparity in this country that is only increasing because of the economic downturn, and (Wall Street) is making the economic downturn worse&quot;.

On October 13, about 150 people convened a General Assembly and voted to begin an occupation in the city's Central Park.   Unlike  Occupy Wall Street's occupation of [[Zucotti Park]], however, Occupy Davis did not set up semi-permanent encampments.  Instead, protestors organized to maintain a constant presence in the park, 24 hours a day, along with erecting a symbolic tent.&lt;ref name=enterprise20111013/&gt;
