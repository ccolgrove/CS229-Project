'''Lego.com''' (officially referred to as '''LEGO.com''') is the official website of the [[LEGO Group]] and Lego brand toys. The Lego website has developed over the years, and aims to provide many extra services for fans, as well as being simply a shop and product catalog.

==History==
Lego.com began in 1996, as a small site with an online shop, one game, and pages about current products. A huge milestone came in 2001, when the moderated Lego.com Message Boards were introduced. In 2005, These Message Boards were updated to the one existing today. In 2007, the whole site was updated, giving the home page a new layout, and changing &quot;Club&quot; to &quot;Play&quot;. Another large update came in May 2008, when My Lego Network was introduced. In 2009, the Lego Account became Lego ID. Soon the site was updated again in 2010 changing &quot;Play to Games&quot; and adding create and share to the front page.

==Products==
The Products page provides links to each of Lego's theme's web pages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lego.com/en-US/products/Page1.aspx Lego Products Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The current Lego themes represented there are:

===Lego Universe===
{{main|Lego Universe}}
Lego Universe is a [[massively multiplayer online game]] developed by [[NetDevil]]. It was released in October 2010. Its release has been delayed from original estimates of 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5056497/lego-universe-already-in-some-gamers-hands |title=A Visit to NetDevil |publisher=Kotaku.com |date=2008-09-29 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; late November 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lego.com/eng/info/default.asp?page=productsdetail&amp;contentid=36621 |title=The Lego Group announces Lego Universe as official title for branded MMOG |publisher=Lego.com |date=2007-06-07 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and mid-2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://loot-ninja.com/2007/06/01/lego-mmo-screens-and-info/ |title=Lego MMO Screens and Info |publisher=Loot-ninja.com |date=2007-06-01 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the first Lego [[computer game]] sold in which players can connect and play [[online]].

==Play==
Play began as CLUB in the year 2001, with few games and the then small Message Boards. These Message Boards are fully moderated by real people.&lt;ref&gt;http://messageboards.lego.com/en-US/home/default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, they were updated to the current form. In 2007, the name was changed to Play. There is also a Games section, a Downloads section, a Comics and Movies Section, and a Club Section containing news, movies, and building tips.

== My Lego Network ==

[[File:My LEGO Network logo.jpg|thumb|right|The My Lego Network Logo]]
My Lego Network (often just abbreviated MLN) is a child-oriented [[social networking site]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://mln.lego.com/en-us/Help/Gettingstarted.aspx MLN Getting Started]&lt;/ref&gt; that has replaced Lego Club pages. A member creates a public page with preset modules, customizing layout and colors. Some modules produce items, which can be sent to &quot;Networkers&quot; ([[Non-player character]]s) to move up in the ranks (0 - 10).&lt;ref&gt;[http://mln.lego.com/en-us/Help/Gettingstarted.aspx MLN Getting Started]&lt;/ref&gt; The website also has a built in inbox that contains prewritten messages that can be sent to friends also on MLN as well as Networkers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mln.lego.com/en-us/Help/Gettingstarted.aspx MLN Getting Started]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ranks ===

Each rank in My Lego Network has a specific Networker theme associated with it, as well as a final &quot;Masterpiece&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mln.lego.com/en-us/Help/MasterPieces.aspx MLN Masterpieces]&lt;/ref&gt; that allows you to move on to the next rank and befriend new Networkers. Ranks become progressively more challenging as you move on.

=== Networkers ===

My Lego Network consists of many networkers each with their own purpose. There are different types of networkers including:

====Rank networkers====
Help you advance through the ranks.

====Mini rank networkers====
Help advance through mini ranks. For completing a mini rank you usually earn a badge.

====Secret networkers====
Hidden networkers usually can help advance through the ranks easily. When befriended they do not show up on your friends list.

====Formerly secret/other networkers====
Usually to do with mini ranks.

==Shop==
Lego Shop at Home is the official shop for Lego brand products.
