The '''Green Bay Phoenix''', previously known as the '''UWâGreen Bay Phoenix''' and '''UWGB Phoenix''', are the athletic teams of the [[University of WisconsinâGreen Bay]]. A total of 16 Phoenix athletic teams compete in  the [[Horizon League]] of [[NCAA Division I]]. They do not sponsor a football team.

==Team highlights==
===Women's basketball===

The Green Bay women's basketball team has won or tied for the Horizon League regular-season championship nine times, including the last eight years.[http://horizonleague.cstv.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/110504aac.html] They have been to the NCAA tournament eight times, as well, including four of the last five years.  In 2007, they were seeded #9 and defeated the [[New Mexico Lobos|New Mexico]] in the first round before falling to the top seeded [[Connecticut Huskies women's basketball|Connecticut]] in the second round despite leading 40-38 at the half.  That loss ended their school-record and nation-leading 26-game winning streak. In 2009, they made it to the first round. In 2010, they made it to the second round, and in 2011, made it to the Sweet 16. They also received their first national ranking in 2003, when they were ranked as high as #16 in both the Associated Press poll and the Coaches' Poll.  In 2005, they also received a national ranking and a bid to the NCAA Tournament, but were knocked out in the first round by [[Maryland Terrapins women's basketball|Maryland]].  They have also made three appearances in the Women's NIT (National Invitational Tournament), most recently in 2008, where they lost to [[Drake Bulldogs|Drake]] in a first round game.
