The '''2009âpresent phase of the [[Somali Civil War]]''' is concentrated in southern [[Somalia]]. It began in early February 2009, with the conflict between, on the one hand, the forces of the Somali [[Transitional Federal Government]] assisted by [[African Union]] peacekeeping troops, and on the other, various militant Islamist and factions. The violence has displaced thousands of people residing in [[Mogadishu]], the nation's capital. The conflict has seen [[sectarian]] violence between the moderate [[Sufi]]s [[Ahlu Sunna Waljama'a|ASWJ]], and the Islamists [[Al-Shabaab]].

==Background==
{{main|War in Somalia (2006â2009)}}
Established in 2004 and internationally recognized, the [[Transitional Federal Government]]'s (TFG) support in Somalia was waning until the [[United States]]-backed 2006 intervention by the Ethiopian military, which helped drive out the rival [[Islamic Courts Union]] (ICU) in Mogadishu and solidify the TFG's rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/component/content/article/153/26334.html |title=Ethiopian Invasion of Somalia |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=2007-08-14 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this defeat, the ICU splintered into several different factions. Some of the more radical elements, including [[Al-Shabaab (Somalia)|Al-Shabaab]], regrouped to continue their insurgency against the TFG and oppose the Ethiopian military's presence in Somalia. Throughout 2007 and 2008, Al-Shabaab scored military victories, seizing control of key towns and ports in both central and southern Somalia. At the end of 2008, the group had captured [[Baidoa]] but not Mogadishu. By January 2009, Al-Shabaab and other militias had managed to force the Ethiopian troops to withdraw from the country, leaving behind an underequipped [[African Union]] (AU) peacekeeping force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees |url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/publisher,USCIRF,,,4a4f272bc,0.html |title=USCIRF Annual Report 2009 - The Commission's Watch List: Somalia |publisher=Unhcr.org |date=2009-05-01 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A power sharing deal ensued between an Islamist splinter group led by Sheikh Sharif Sheikh Ahmed's Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia Djibouti faction (ARS-D) and TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan in [[Djibouti]]. Al-Shabaab, which had separated from the moderate Islamists of the insurgency, rejected the peace deal and continued to take territories. It was joined by [[Hizbul Islam]], which is an amalgamation of four Islamist group including the Alliance for the Re-liberation of Somalia - [[Asmara]] faction. Another Islamist group, Ahlu Sunnah Waljama'ah, which was allied with the TFG and supported by Ethiopia, continues to attack al-Shabaab and take over towns as well although they have been effective only in the central region of [[Galguduud]], where they ousted al-Shabaab from most of the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monstersandcritics.com/news/africa/news/article_1456455.php/Moderate_Islamists_seize_town_from_Somali_insurgents_ |title=Moderate Islamists seize town from Somali insurgents |publisher=Monstersandcritics.com |date=2009-01-29 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mareeg.com/fidsan.php?sid=10277&amp;tirsan=3 |title=Moderate Islamic group claims victory over rival hardline group |publisher=Mareeg.com |date=1996-01-01 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethioforum.org/wp/archives/759 |title=Ahlu Suna Wal Jamea supported by Ethiopian government |publisher=Ethioforum.org |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the parliament took in 275 officials from the moderate Islamist opposition, ARS leader Sheikh Ahmed was elected TFG President on January 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/WORLD/africa/01/31/somalia.election.president/ |title=Moderate Islamist picked as Somali president |publisher=Edition.cnn.com |date=2009-01-31 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the al-Shabaab radical Islamists have accused the new TFG President of accepting the secular transitional government and have continued the civil war since he arrived in Mogadishu at the presidential palace in early February 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheikh |first=Abdi |url=http://in.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idINIndia-37897920090207 |title=Rebels target new president |publisher=In.reuters.com |date= 2009-02-07|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timeline==
{{main|2009 timeline of the War in Somalia|2010 timeline of the War in Somalia|2011 timeline of the War in Somalia}}

===Islamist-ARS/TFG coalition conflict===

On February 4, 2009, four Islamist groups, including Hassan Dahir Aweys' Eritrean branch of the [[Alliance for the Reliberation of Somalia|ARS]] merged and created the group [[Hisbi Islam]], to fight the new government of Sharif Ahmed. [[al-Shabaab (Somalia)|al-Shabaab]] also vowed to fight the government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200902050135.html Islamist Groups Merge to Fight Sheikh Sharif]&lt;/ref&gt; On February 8, 2009, they declared war on the new government of Sharif Ahmed and the AU peace-keepers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200902080003.html Islamic Party Insurgents Declare War On New Govt]&lt;/ref&gt;

New TFG President Sheik Sharif Sheik Ahmed arrived in Mogadishu as a president for the first time on February 7, 2009. The al-Shabaab and other radical Islamists began firing at the new TFG president hours later. They accused the new President of accepting the secular transitional government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g7OaI4_kjeHA-o4UhlmP7vlWmrrwD966RU880 Radical Islamists attack new president Ahmed's palace]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 8, heavy fighting broke out in southern [[Mogadishu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/Detail.aspx?id=85107&amp;sectionid=351020501 |title=No Operation |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[al-Shabaab (Somalia)|al-Shabaab]] leader Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur).
met with Sharif Ahmed for peace talks during his visit to [[Mogadishu]], while Omar Iman rejected the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail.aspx?id=85097&amp;sectionid=351020501 |title=Somali president gears up for peace |publisher=Presstv.ir |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; During these negotiations, Sharif Ahmed said that he would be prepared to enforce [[Sharia Law]] in Somalia, which is currently the radical groups' main demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200902091418.html&lt;/ref&gt; However, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow, a former Al-Shabab spokesman,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200905140395.html |title=Somalia: Al Shabaab Leader Speaks, More Fighting in Mogadishu |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2009-05-13 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; denied having talked to Sharif Ahmed and vowed to continue fighting until his demands for Sharia Law were met. Sheikh Mukhtar Robow warned [[Nigeria]] against sending peace keepers to Somalia, as al-Shabaab views the AU peace keepers as occupying forces and will continue fighting them until they withdraw from the country.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200902120738.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 10, al-Shabaab launched an offensive to take the Bakool province. Government officials who had been ousted from Baidoa had been amassing troops in the city of Hudur (Xudur) and planning a major offensive to re-take Baidoa. Islamist forces attacked the province and reached the capital were they started a battle against government forces.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200902110007.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200902100717.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 12, the spokesman for al-Shabaab, Sheikh Mukhtar Robow (Abu Mansur), rebuffed reports from several media outlets that a mutual agreement between him and newly elected president Sharif Ahmed was made. He also added that he had no intention to contact the president on any matters, and that they would continue fighting against foreign troops and what he described as an âapostate&quot; government.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hiiraan.com/news2/2009/Feb /al_shabaab_reiterates_opposition_to_new_somali_leader.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, they vowed war against the new government.&lt;ref&gt;http://allafrica.com/stories/200902120954.html&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 22, a double suicide bomb attack on an AU base in Mogadishu left 11 Burundian soldiers dead and another 15 wounded. Two days later heavy fighting erupted in the city as TFG and AU forces attempted to retake the city from radical Islamist forces. The fighting lasted for two days and killed 87 people, including: 48 civilians, 15 insurgents and 6 TFG policemen.

At the same time as the fighting raged in Mogadishu, al-Shabaab forces took the town of Hudor, to the north-west, in fighting that killed another 20 people: 10 TFG soldiers, 6 insurgents and 4 civilians.

On February 28, it appeared that [[Hisbi Islam]] would sign a ceasefire with the [[Transitional Federal Government]].&lt;ref name=&quot;HisbiPeace?&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/02/2009228161951283106.html|title=Somalia in truce with rebel group|date=2009-02-28|accessdate=2009-03-20|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by March 1, it was clear that no ceasefire would be given, despite President [[Sharif Ahmed]] having agreed to proposals for a [[truce]] and having offered to accept the implementation of [[Sharia|Sharia Law]] but refused to move troops from civilian areas despite the Islamists doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;NoHisbiPeace&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/03/20093117498433881.html|title=Somali rebels reject ceasefire|date=2009-03-01|accessdate=2009-03-20|publisher=[[Al Jazeera]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.somaliweyn.org/pages/news/Mar_09/4Mar23.html ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Battle of Mogadishu (2009)}}
On May 7, a fierce battle for control of Mogadishu started between al-Shabaab and Hizbul Islam against the TFG. Hundreds were killed and injured and tens of thousands were displaced.

===Al-Shabaab-Hizbul Islam conflict===
The armed conflict between Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab began due to a dispute between the faction of the Ras Kamboni Brigades led by Sheikh Ahmed &quot;Madoobe&quot; and al-Shabaab,&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSCSOM&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://somalitalkradio.com/2010/mar/un_report_somalia.pdf |pages= 16 &amp; 18|title=Etpu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; over a power sharing agreement in [[Kisimayo]]. Hizbul Islam and al-Shabaab had made a power sharing agreement for the city, where the power would rotate between the two factions, with each faction controlling the city for periods of six months. However, due to clan politics al-Shabaab refused to let the power rotation take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/africa/2009/10/200910185652850176.html |title=Somali factions battle in Kismayo |publisher=English.aljazeera.net |date=2009-10-01 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to internal problems within Hizbul Islam as it's ARS-A and [[JABISO]] factions, which were aligned with al-Shabaab in Hiran and Mogadishu, refused to support the Ras Kamboni Brigades, while Anole remained neutral. It also led to a split within the Ras Kamboni Brigades, with a faction led by Hizbul Islam's deputy chairman Sheikh Hassan &quot;Turki&quot; refusing to back Ahmad &quot;Madoobe&quot; and instead siding with al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSCSOM&quot;/&gt;

On October 1, [[Battle of Kisimayo (2009)|heavy fighting]] broke out. By the afternoon, al-Shabaab controlled most of the city with 12 dead and 70 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20091001/ap_on_re_af/af_somalia ]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least 17 people were killed in during a series of battles overnight on October 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;garoweonline.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_17_killed_in_renewed_clashes_near_Kismayo.shtml |title=17 killed in renewed clashes near Kismayo|publisher=Garowe Online |date=2009-10-05 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Hizbul Islam spokesman claimed that they had captured foreign fighters in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_Hizbul_Islam_claims_to_capture_foreign_fighters.shtml |title=Garowe Online |publisher=Garowe Online |date=2009-10-06 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The battle was decisively won by al-Shabaab which expelled Madbobe's Ras Kamboni Brigade forces from the city.&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200912090585.html |title=Somalia: Al-Shabaab's Encirclement Strategy |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout November 2009, fighting between the two factions continued in Southern Somalia&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSCSOM&quot;/&gt; and as result insurgent attacks in Mogadishu targeting TFG and AMISOM forces decreased.&lt;ref name=&quot;garoweonline.com&quot;/&gt; However [[Ahmed Mohamed Islam|Sheikh Ahmad Madobe]]'s forces were soon overpowered by al-Shabaab and it's local allies and forced to withdraw from the [[Jubbada Hoose|Lower Jubba region]] and most of Southern Somalia.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSCSOM&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;circle&quot;/&gt; In February 2010, Sheikh Hassan Turki's branch of the Ras Kamboni Brigades declared a merge with al-Shabaab.&lt;ref name=&quot;UNSCSOM&quot;/&gt; He encouraged other groups in Hizbul Islam also to join al-Shabaab.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201002020211.html |title=Somalia: Notorious Islamist Guerrilla Leader Joins Al Shabaab |publisher=allAfrica.com |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Battle of Gashandiga===
An early 2011 offensive was dubbed by AU Representative Wafula Wamunyinyi as the &quot;Battle of Gashandiga.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Gashandiga&quot; /&gt;

In February 20, 2011, it was reported that AMISOM troops destroyed a large complex of al-Shabaab trenches, and killed six al-Shabaab commanders in Mogadishu. Two AMISOM troops died in those battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Press_Releases_32/AMISOM_Smashes_Extremist_s_Urban_Trench_System.shtml |title=Garowe Online |publisher=Garowe Online |date=2011-02-20 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 21, at least 20 people, including TFG policemen were killed in a suicide car bomb attack in Mogadishu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Suicide_car_bomb_killed_20_people_in_Mogadishu.shtml |title=Suicide car bomb killed 20 people in Mogadishu|publisher=Garowe Online |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between February 21 and 22, twelve people were killed in heavy shelling in Mogadishu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_12_killed_in_continue_clashes_in_Mogadishu.shtml |title=12 killed in continued clashes in Mogadishu |publisher=Garowe Online |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 25, 15 people were killed as al-Shabaab fighters attempted to re-take lost territory in Mogadishu. Additionally, rebels displayed one wounded and five dead Burundian AMISOM soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.garoweonline.com/artman2/publish/Somalia_27/Somalia_15_civilians_killed_in_Mogadishu_clashes.shtml |title=15 civilians killed in Mogadishu_clashes |publisher=Garowe Online |date=2011-02-25 |accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 26, an offensive by TFG troops with support of Ethiopian soldiers was opened in the southern Somali town of [[Bula Hawo]]. Until February 28, 33 people were killed in TFG and Ethiopian shelling.

By March 5, AMISOM and TFG forces claimed to control seven of the city's districts, while six were contested and three were controlled by anti-government forces. Al-Shabaab responded to the government offensive by putting up roadblocks to prevent the movement of goods from the seaport. This adversely affected both sides of the conflict, as the TFG controlled the port and its profits, while the Bakaara Market, where many of the goods were bound to be sold, was controlled by the insurgents.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gashandiga&quot;&gt;[http://www.somaliareport.com/index.php/post/174/Ahlu_Sunna_Gedo_Leader_Dies_After_Ambush AMISOM Vows to Keep Fighting for Mogadishu]&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that by March 5, up to 53 AMISOM may have died in the clashes.

By March 16, AMISOM was bolstered by an additional 1,000 peacekeepers to assist in the TFG's renewed offensive against al-Shabaab, bringing the total manpower of AMISOM to nearly 9,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-12764412 | work=BBC News | title=Ugandan Amisom peacekeepers jailed for shooting Somalis | date=March 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of Al-Shabaab in Mogadishu===
On August 6, 2011, the Transitional Federal Government's troops and their AMISOM allies reportedly managed to capture all of Mogadishu from the Al-Shabaab militants. Witnesses reported Al-Shabaab vehicles abandoning their bases in the capital for the south-central city of [[Baidoa]]. The group's spokesman Sheikh Ali Mohamud Rage described the exodus as a tactical retreat, and vowed to continue the insurgency against the national government. Observers have suggested that the pullout may at least in part have been caused by internal ideological rifts in the rebel organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rsgdird&quot;/&gt;

After their withdrawal, al-Shabaab has however continued hit and run tactics in the North of the city as they vowed to continue guerilla attacks in Mogadishu.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/201108181054.html Govt Forces, Al Shabaab Fight in Mogadishu]&lt;/ref&gt; On October 4, 2011, a suicide bomb on a lorry detonated and killed more than 70&amp;nbsp;people near a compound housing several government ministries.

The Burundian military lost 51 soldiers in October, causing anger among Burundians, who believe that their country is sacrificing too much.  Many Burundians have urged other AU members to contribute troops to the Somalia mission.  [[Nigeria]], [[Djibouti]], and [[Guinea]] have indicated sending troops, but all have yet to contribute&lt;ref&gt;http://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5iDMfHWg3CtRLmqAzXlV7_HxRVhfw?docId=dac727053c55487784f0d0754adfd82f&lt;/ref&gt;

==Foreign involvement==
===United States and Other International Involvement===

As of October 2010, the U.S. State Department noted the United States directly obligated over $229 million to support AMISOM, and paid for other UN assistance for the mission indirectly through its obligations to the international body.&lt;ref name=&quot;US-State-Dept-Somalia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2863.htm|title=Background Note: Somalia |publisher=US State Department|date=2011-01-03|accessdate=2011-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United National Development Program]] for Somalia spends about $50 million each year,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.so.undp.org/index.php/Donors-and-partners.html UNDP in Somalia: Donors and Expenditures]&lt;/ref&gt; though these funds are not related to military aid. Instead these programs, such as Employment Generation for Early Recovery (EGER)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.so.undp.org/index.php/Somalia-Stories/Employment-Generation-for-Early-Recovery.html Employment Generation for Early Recovery]&lt;/ref&gt; are targeted to foster civil government institutions for the Transitional Federal Government, such as law enforcement, local governance, youth employment, watershed management, as well as AIDS/HIV programs.
