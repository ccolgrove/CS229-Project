'''Hurricane Madeline''' was a Category 4 hurricane that made landfall in [[Mexico]] in October 1976. Madeline formed on September 29, not far from [[Central America]]. The next day, the circulation dissipated, and as a result weakened to a [[low-pressure area|remnant low]]. Four days later, on October 3, the low regenerated into a tropical depression.  The system remained weak for three days as it drifted west-northwest. When it began to recurve towards Mexico on October 6, the cyclone rapidly intensified, eventually making landfall at peak intensity as a Category 4. Shortly after landfall, the cyclone rapidly dissipated.

Prior to the arrival of Madeline, 15,000 people evacuated form the coast, which had already been impacted by [[Hurricane Liza (1976)|Hurricane Liza]]. Heavy damage was reported, along with seven fatalities. Two dams were flooded; extensive crop damage was reported.

==Meteorological history==
{{storm path|Madeline 1976 track.png|alt text=Storm path of Hurricane Madeline}}
Early on September 27, 1976, the [[Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center]] (EPHC) reported that a tropical disturbance had formed about 770&amp;nbsp;km (480&amp;nbsp;mi) to the southwest of [[San Jose, Costa Rica]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|author=Emil B Gunther|volume=105|date=1977-04-01|title=Eastern Pacific Tropical Cyclones of 1976|journal=Monthly Weather Review|publisher=American Meteorological Society|pages=508â522|url=http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/pdf/10.1175/1520-0493%281977%29105%3C0508%3AEPTCO%3E2.0.CO%3B2|accessdate=2010-04-25|doi=10.1175/1520-0493(1977)105&lt;0508:EPTCO&gt;2.0.CO;2|issn=1520-0493|year=1977|issue=4|bibcode = 1977MWRv..105..508G }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the next two days the disturbance slowly developed while moving northwest. By the morning of September 29, the disturbance was upgraded to a 40&amp;nbsp;mph (65&amp;nbsp;km/h) tropical storm and based on ship reports and [[satellite imagery]]. Due to the fact that it attained tropical storm status, it was named Madeline. At this time, the cyclone had developed a center of circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;/&gt;{{EPAC hurricane best track}} Its intensification was short-lived and Madeline remained at [[tropical cyclone|tropical storm]] strength for just 12 hours before it was downgraded into a [[tropical cyclone|tropical depression]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAC HURDAT&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Eastern Pacific hurricane best track analysis 1949-2009|publisher=[[National Hurricane Center]]|date=2010-03-01|accessdate=2010-04-24|url=http://www.nhc.noaa.gov/tracks1949to2009_epa.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madeline remained at tropical depression strength until September 20. At that time, the EPHC reported that the circulation center was no longer visible and downgraded the system to a remnant low, while located 575&amp;nbsp;mi (925&amp;nbsp;km) to the southeast of [[Acapulco, Mexico]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;/&gt;

Over the following days, the low moved towards the west and started to regenerate with a circulation center becoming visible early on October 3. Based on this, the EPHC re-upgraded Madeline to a tropical depression.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAC HURDAT&quot;/&gt; Continuing to intensify, Madeline was soon upgraded to a tropical storm for the second time.&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAC HURDAT&quot;/&gt; During the next day or two, Madeline remained near stationary before turning towards the northeast on October 5.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot; /&gt; As the cyclone moved over an area of warm seas surface temperatures, the storm started to intensify. During the next day, Madeline slowly developed an [[eye (cyclone)|eye]] before intensifying into a hurricane. In addition, a [[Hurricane Hunter]] aircraft reported winds 75&amp;nbsp;mph (120&amp;nbsp;km/h) winds and a pressure of 984 millibars&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAC HURDAT&quot; /&gt;

During October 7, with warm water helping to fuel its intensification, Madeline quickly intensified into a Category 2 hurricane, and was upgraded to a major hurricane (Category 3 or higher on the [[Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale]]) early on October 8. Based on hurricane hunter reports, Madeline reached its peak [[maximum sustained winds|sustained winds]] of 145&amp;nbsp;mph (230&amp;nbsp;km/h) and a peak pressure of 940 [[bar (unit)|millibars]] early on the 8&amp;nbsp;. Upon reaching peak intensity, it peak gust from the powerful hurricane was 165&amp;nbsp;mph (270&amp;nbsp;km/h). This made Madeline a moderate Category 4 hurricane. Later that morning Madeline made landfall to the northwest of [[Zihuatanejo]] as a powerful Category 4 hurricane, before it rapidly dissipated over land.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seasonal summary&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;EPAC HURDAT&quot;/&gt;

Mexican army headquarters put in effect an emergency plan three days prior to the arrival of the hurricane.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM VI&quot; /&gt; An estimated 15,000&amp;nbsp;people evacuated from threatened areas in the path of Madeline.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM IX&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=W1AxAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=86EFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6170,2843183&amp;dq=hurricane+madeline&amp;hl=en|title=Measures keep toll low|date=1976-08-10|work=The Montreal Gazette|page=66|accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, evacuations prior to Madeline were considered a success.&lt;ref name=&quot;HM VI&quot;/&gt; [[Tropical cyclone warnings and watches|Hurricane warnings]] and [[Flood alert|flood warnings]] were issued along the coastlines of [[MichoacÃ¡n]] and [[Guerrero]].
