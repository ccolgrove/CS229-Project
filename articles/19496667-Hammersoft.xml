The '''Egyptian national futsal team''' represents [[Egypt]] during international [[futsal]] competitions. It is governed by the [[Egyptian Football Association]].

Egypt reached the [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] 4 times. Egypt attended their first [[FIFA Futsal World Cup]] in 1996, when they achieved the first victory for Africa in the competition's history by beating [[Australia national futsal team|Australia]] 8-2.
Four years later they earned Africa a quarter-final berth with notable victories over the likes of [[Uruguay national futsal team|Uruguay]]  and [[Russia national futsal team|Russia]]. Although a draw with [[Argentina national futsal team|Argentina]] would have granted them a place in the semis, they lost 3-4 to the South Americans.

The Pharaohs appeared for the third successive time in [[FIFA Futsal World Championship 2004|Chinese Taipei]] and despite a first-round exit, they made their mark with the biggest margin of victory in the tournament, 12-0 over the hosts. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fifa.com/futsalworldcup/teams/team=1883203/index.html Egypt Futsal Team(EGY)], September 2008.
