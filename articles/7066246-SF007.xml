'''DistroWatch''' is a [[website]] which provides news, popularity rankings, and other general information about various [[Linux distribution]]s as well as other [[free software]]/[[open source]] [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s such as [[OpenSolaris]], [[MINIX]] and [[BSD]]. It now contains information on several hundred distributions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/search.php?status=All Distrowatch: Current distributions on database.]&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally published on May 31, 2001, and is maintained by Ladislav Bodnar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/dwres.php?resource=about DistroWatch.com: Put the fun back into computing. Use Linux, BSD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; 

The site maintains extensive comparison charts detailing differences between the package sets and software revisions of different distributions. It also provides some general characteristics of distributions such as the price and the supported processor architectures.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. see the [[Red Hat Enterprise Linux]] page on the web site http://distrowatch.com/table.php?distribution=redhat&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a Distrowatch weekly (often abbreviated DWW) that comes out on Monday &quot;as a publication summarising the happenings in the distribution world on a weekly basis&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20081117&lt;/ref&gt; As of 17 November 2008, 5&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;/&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; years and 278 issues later, Ladislav has decided to step down from the post of the editor for DWW. Ladislav says he will still continue &quot;bringing you the latest release news and to keep all distribution pages up-to-date&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20081117&lt;/ref&gt; while the DWW will be written by [[Chris Smart]].&lt;ref&gt;http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20081124 DistroWatch.com: Put the fun back into computing. Use Linux, BSD.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distrowatch has a monthly donations programme, a joint initiative between DistroWatch and two online shops selling low-cost CDs and DVDs with Linux, BSD and other open source software. Since the launch of the Donations Programme in March 2004, DistroWatch has donated a total of $24,478 USD to various open source software projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20100607 DistroWatch.com: Put the fun back into computing. Use Linux, BSD&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accuracy ==
Despite Bodnar saying &quot;I'd like to believe that there is some truth in the figures, but in all honesty, they really don't mean all that much and should not be taken very seriously&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.groklaw.net/articlebasic.php?story=20070111043418436 Groklaw - Some Facts about openSUSE and Distrowatch Figures - A Correction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt; DistroWatch's statistics are often cited as a guide to the popularity of various distributions. Its &quot;page hit counter&quot; has been called &quot;the best '[[barometer]]' of Linux distributions on the [[Internet]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zenwalk.org/modules/tinycontent/index.php?id=7 www.zenwalk.org - Pages&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;].&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Distrowatch's own reviews are not updated for prolonged periods of time and are thus outdated.
