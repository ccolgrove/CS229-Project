'''Compiz''' is one of the first [[compositing window manager]]s for the [[X Window System]] that uses [[3D graphics]] hardware to create fast [[compositing]] desktop effects for window management. The effects, such as a minimization effect and a cube workspace are implemented as loadable plugins.  Because it conforms to the [[Inter-Client Communication Conventions Manual]] standard, Compiz can substitute for the default [[Mutter_(window_manager)|Mutter]] in [[GNOME]] or [[KWin]] in [[KDE]].

Compiz plugins include the cube effect (example to the right), [[Alt-Tab]] application-switching with live previews or icons, and a feature similar to [[ExposÃ© (Mac OS X)|ExposÃ©]].  The [[composite (graphics)|Composite extension]] to X is used, as is the [[OpenGL]] extension &lt;tt&gt;GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.opengl.org/registry/specs/EXT/texture_from_pixmap.txt&lt;/ref&gt; The first version of Compiz was released as [[free software]] by [[Novell]] ([[SUSE Linux distributions|SUSE]]) in January 2006 in the wake of the (also new) [[Xgl]].

==Hardware requirements==
Initially, Compiz only worked with 3D hardware which was supported by Xgl. Most [[NVIDIA]] and [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] graphics cards are known to work with Compiz on Xgl. Since May 22, 2006 Compiz works on the standard [[X.Org Server]], by using [[AIGLX]]. Besides the [[Intel GMA]] graphics cards, AIGLX also supports using the ATI graphics cards (including [[R300]], R400 and R500 cards) using the open-source radeon driver which supports &lt;tt&gt;GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap&lt;/tt&gt; since fall 2006.

NVIDIA's binary drivers (since Version [http://www.nvidia.com/object/linux_display_ia32_1.0-9629.html 1.0-9629]) support &lt;tt&gt;GLX_EXT_texture_from_pixmap&lt;/tt&gt; on standard X.Org server.&lt;br /&gt;
[[ATI]]/[[AMD]]'s binary drivers do since version 8.42.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.ati.com/drivers/linux/linux_8.42.3.html#188413 |title=AMD Proprietary Linux Release Notes |publisher=.ati.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
=== Merge of the Compiz and Beryl communities ===
On March 30, 2007, discussions between the [[Beryl (window manager)|Beryl]] (a fork of Compiz) and Compiz communities led to a merger of the two communities which results in two new software packages:

* Compiz, (also Compiz-core) which contains only the core functionality of compiz and base plugins
* Compiz Fusion, consisting of the plugins, decorators, settings tools and related applications from the Beryl and Compiz communities. Compiz Fusion concentrates on installation, configuration and additional plugins to add to the core functionalities of Compiz.

Outcomes include plans to fund a code review panel consisting of the best developers from each community who will see that any code included in a release package meets the highest standards and is suitable for distribution
in an officially supported package.&lt;ref name=&quot;BerylCompizMerge&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further branches===
In the fourth quarter of 2008, two separate branches of Compiz were created: ''compiz++'' and ''NOMAD''; compiz++ was geared toward the separation of [[Compositing window manager|compositing]] and [[OpenGL]] layers for the rendering of the window manager without compositing effects, and the port from [[C (programming language)|C]] to [[C++]] programming language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/compiz/2008-December/003227.html ''Compiz feature branch compiz++''], Dennis &quot;onestone&quot; Kasprzyk, Wed Dec 24 04:48:17 PST 2008&lt;/ref&gt; NOMAD was geared towards the improvement of [[remote desktop software|remote desktop]] performance for Compiz installations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.opensuse.org/Nomad NOMAD home page]&lt;/ref&gt;  However NOMAD is now defunct and the home page no longer exists.

=== Merge of the Compiz branches ===
On February 2, 2009 a conference call was held between developers of Compiz, Compiz++, NOMAD and Compiz Fusion where it was decided to merge the projects together into a unified project, simply named Compiz, with a unified roadmap.&lt;ref name=&quot;longlivecompiz&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blog.phpwnage.com/article.php?id=34|title=Compiz is Dead, Long Live Compiz! |accessdate=2009-02-04|last=Lange|first=Kevin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;compizfuturetwo&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kristianlyng.wordpress.com/2009/02/04/the-future-of-compiz-take-two/|title=The Future of Compiz - Take two|accessdate=2010-04-19|last=LyngstÃ¸l|first=Kristian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;compcouncil&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/compiz/2009-February/003284.html |title=Announcement: Creation of the Compiz Council and the road ahead |accessdate=2009-02-04 |last=LyngstÃ¸l |first=Kristian}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On July 4, 2010, Sam Spilsbury announced the release of Compiz 0.9.0, still in unstable release, with a new API, rewritten in C++.&lt;ref name=&quot;lists.freedesktop.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://lists.freedesktop.org/archives/compiz/2010-October/003446.html |title=[compiz&amp;#93; Compiz 0.9.2 is released! |publisher=lists.freedesktop.org |date= |accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Decorators ===
Compiz uses small programs called decorators which draw the window borders with the usual minimize, maximize and close buttons.  Compiz provides two window decorators.
* ''gtk-window-decorator'' uses either a basic [[Cairo (graphics)|cairo]] based rendering engine or can use [[metacity]] themes.
* ''kde-window-decorator'' uses native [[KDE]] themes

In addition, [[Emerald (window decorator)|Emerald]], [[Beryl (window manager)|Beryl]]'s custom decorator with its own theme format, has been ported to Compiz as part of the Compiz Fusion project (see below) and is available in unofficial packages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.opencompositing.org/viewtopic.php?f=14&amp;t=131 OpenCompositing forums - Compiz and Compiz Fusion GIT repository for Ubuntu]. Retrieved on 2007-06-21.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Patches ===
Along with plugins, the Compiz community developers often release code patches for existing plugins when the feature does not warrant a plugin of its own; or when it utilizes many of the portions of an existing plugin.  Code patches can then be sent to the mailing list for eventual inclusion in the main Compiz distribution.  The community provides a valuable testing ground for new ideas.

Since Ubuntu 7.10 (Gutsy Gibbon), Compiz Fusion is enabled by default.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arstechnica.com/journals/linux.ars/2007/09/12/ubuntu-technical-board-votes-on-compiz-for-ubuntu-7-10 Ubuntu Technical Board votes on Compiz for Ubuntu 7.10&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Linux Mint]]
*[[YOPER]] - installed but not activated in a default installation as well as on version 3 - Titanum's live CD.

Compiz (Aiglx and XGL) can also be set up on almost any other GNU/Linux-based distribution if the code is compiled correctly; however, there is no support available for this and it is not always a straight-forward procedure. In addition to these Linux distributions, [[PC-BSD]] also provides out of the box support for Compiz. However, this option is not enabled by default. [[FreeBSD]] is also capable, and the required sources are found in the ports tree.&lt;ref name=&quot;CompizFreeBSD&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsdforums.org/forums/showthread.php?p=217677&amp;postcount=8|title=bsdforums.org -- XGL/Compiz on FreeBSD|accessdate=2008-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
[[Canonical Ltd]]. has hired Sam Spilsbury, lead Compiz developer, to further develop Compiz for [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | quote = ...I was also hired by Canonical Ltd.... | url = http://smspillaz.wordpress.com/2010/10/25/a-bright-new-future-for-compiz/ | date = 2010-11-25 | title= A bright new future for Compiz | author = Sam Spilsbury}}&lt;/ref&gt;
