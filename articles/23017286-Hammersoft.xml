Together with [[Keith Simpson (pathologist)|Keith Simpson]] and [[Francis Camps]], Teare was one of the &quot;Three Musketeers&quot;, who dealt with almost all the suspicious deaths in the London area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8446356/Professor-David-Bowen.html | journal=[[Sunday Telegraph]] | title=Professor David Bowen | date=12 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor Teare was called to give evidence in many high profile criminal investigations, such as the murder of Beryl Evans and her baby Geraldine in the [[Timothy Evans]] case. Although Evans was convicted and hanged, three years later the real killer, [[John Reginald Christie]] confessed to the crimes and many others. He was hanged, and after many enquiries, Evans was declared innocent of the crime for which he had been hanged. Teare's accident investigations included the horrific [[Harrow and Wealdstone rail crash]] which occurred in 1952 killing 112 people.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}
