'''Calgary''' {{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|k|Ã¦|l|É¡|(É)|r|i}} is a city in the [[Alberta|Province of Alberta]], [[Canada]]. It is located in the south of the [[provinces and territories of Canada|province]], in an area of foothills and [[Great Plains|prairie]], approximately {{convert|80|km|abbr=on}} east of the front ranges of the [[Canadian Rockies]]. The city is located in the Grassland region of Alberta.

In 2006, the City of Calgary had a population of 988,193 making it the [[List of the 100 largest municipalities in Canada by population|third-largest]] municipality in the country and largest in [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name=statscan1&gt;{{cite web|title=Population and dwelling counts, for Canada and census subdivisions (municipalities), 2006 and 2001 censuses&amp;nbsp;â 100% data |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=301&amp;S=3&amp;O=D |publisher= [[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The entire metropolitan area had a 2006 population of 1,079,310, making it the [[List of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in Canada|fifth-largest]] [[census metropolitan area]] (CMA) in Canada.&lt;ref name=statscan2&gt;{{cite web|title=Population and dwelling counts, for census metropolitan areas and census agglomerations, 2006 and 2001 censuses â 100% data |url=http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/popdwell/Table.cfm?T=201&amp;S=3&amp;O=D&amp;RPP=150 |publisher= [[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Calgary's metropolitan population was estimated at 1,230,248, raising its rank to fourth-largest CMA in Canada.&lt;ref name=Estimate&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Population Estimates and Demographic Factors of Growth by Census Metropolitan Area, Canada, from July to June&amp;nbsp;â Population Estimates and Factors of Growth |url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91-214-x/2008000/t021-eng.htm |publisher= [[Statistics Canada]] |date=July 1, 2009 |accessdate=February 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Located {{convert|294|km|abbr=off}} south of [[Edmonton]], [[Statistics Canada]] defines the narrowly populated area between these cities as the &quot;[[CalgaryâEdmonton Corridor]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geodepot.statcan.ca/Diss/Highlights/Page9/Page9d_e.cfm|title=Calgary-Edmonton Corridor| publisher = [[Statistics Canada]] |accessdate=January 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic activity in Calgary is mostly centred on the [[Petroleum production in Canada|petroleum industry]], [[agriculture]], and [[tourism]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitcalgary.com/&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1988, Calgary became the first Canadian city to host the [[1988 Winter Olympics|Olympic Winter Games]].

==History==
{{Main|Timeline of Calgary history}}
===First settlement===
Before the Calgary area was settled by Europeans, it was inhabited by pre-[[Clovis culture|Clovis]] people whose presence has been traced back at least 11,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ucalgary.ca/~walde/testtime.html | title= Archaeology Timeline of Alberta| author= University of Calgary |authorlink= University of Calgary |accessdate= May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1787, [[cartography|cartographer]] [[David Thompson (explorer)|David Thompson]] spent the winter with a band of [[Northern Peigan|Peigan]] encamped along the [[Bow River]]. He was the first recorded European to visit the area, and [[John Glenn (Alberta)|John Glenn]] was the first documented European settler in the Calgary area, in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://tprc.alberta.ca/parks/fishcreek/glenns.asp| archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070927220124/http://tprc.alberta.ca/parks/fishcreek/glenns.asp| archivedate=September 27, 2007| title=The Glenns| author=Alberta Tourism, Parks, Recreation and Culture| accessdate=August 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The native way of life remained relatively unchanged until the late 1870s, when Europeans hunted the buffalo to near-extinction.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
[[File:Calgary Alberta circa 1885.jpg|thumb|left|Calgary as it appeared circa 1885]]

The site became a post of the [[North-West Mounted Police]] (now the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] or RCMP). The NWMP detachment was assigned in 1875 to protect the western plains from U.S. whiskey traders, and  protect the fur trade. Originally named [[Fort Brisebois]], after NWMP officer [[Ãphrem-A. Brisebois]], it was renamed [[Fort Calgary]] in 1876 by Colonel [[James Macleod]]. It was named after [[Calgary, Mull|Calgary]]  on the [[Isle of Mull]], Scotland. While there is some disagreement on the naming of the town, the Museum on the Isle of Mull explains that ''kald'' and ''gart'' are similar [[Old Norse]] words, meaning &quot;cold&quot; and &quot;garden&quot;, that were likely used when named by the Vikings who inhabited the [[Inner Hebrides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{full|date=August 2011}} Mull Museum, Tobermory, Isle of Mull, Scotland. Retrieved July 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the name might come from the [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]], ''Cala ghearraidh'', meaning 'beach of the meadow (pasture)'.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

With its inception in 1885,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/lhn-nhs/ab/caveandbasin/index.aspx |title=Parks Canada&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Cave and Basin National Historic Site |publisher= [[Parks Canada]] |date= May 21, 2010 |accessdate= July 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Banff National Park]] slowly grew to become an international tourist attraction, along with the [[Banff Springs Hotel]]. At first, the main access to the park was by the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]], builder of the Banff Springs Hotel, and the CPR heavily promoted tourism to the area.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Calgary International Airport is a staging point for people destined for the park.&lt;ref name=Getting2Banff&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.banff.ca/visiting-banff/maps-directions/banff-directions.htm | title=Getting to Banff | publisher=Town of Banff | accessdate=2011-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Calgary Fire of 1886]] occurred on November 7, 1886. Fourteen buildings were destroyed with losses estimated at $103,200. Although no one was killed or injured,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_766_240_0_43/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/About+Calgary/History/Calgary+Fire+Department+History/Late+1800s/The+Great+Fire+of+1886.htm|title=The Great Fire of 1886 |accessdate=December 17, 2008}}{{Dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; city officials drafted a law requiring all large downtown buildings to be built with [[Paskapoo Formation|Paskapoo]] [[sandstone]], to prevent this from happening again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/8857|title= The Sandstone City|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] reached the area in 1883, and a rail station was constructed, Calgary began to grow into an important commercial and agricultural centre. The [[Canadian Pacific Railway]] headquarters are still located in Calgary to this day.
Calgary was officially [[municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a town in 1884, and elected its first mayor, [[George Murdoch]]. In 1894, it was incorporated as &quot;The City of Calgary&quot; in what was then the [[North-West Territories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/City+Clerks+Department/Administration+Services/Corporate+Records/Archives/Historical+Information/index.htm| title= Historical Information|author=City of Calgary|accessdate=September 23, 2007}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the arrival of the railway, the Dominion Government started leasing grazing land at minimal cost (up to {{convert|100000|acre|km2}} for one cent per acre per year). As a result of this policy, large ranching operations were established in the outlying country near Calgary. Already a transportation and distribution hub, Calgary quickly became the center of Canada's cattle marketing and meatpacking industries.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Between 1896 and 1914 settlers from all over the world poured into the area in response to the offer of free &quot;[[Dominion Lands Act|homestead]]&quot; land. Agriculture and ranching became key components of the local economy, shaping the future of Calgary for years to come. The world famous [[Calgary Stampede]], still held annually in July, grew from a small agricultural show and rodeo started in 1912 by four wealthy ranchers to &quot;the greatest outdoor show on earth&quot;.{{citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=entire paragraph}}

===The oil boom===
[[File:69 Calgary.jpg|thumb|left|Calgary circa 1969]]
Oil was first discovered in Alberta in 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/alberta100/en_text/categories/oil_gas/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070523101604/http://www.cbc.ca/alberta100/en_text/categories/oil_gas/|archivedate=May 23, 2007|title=Oil and Gas in Alberta|author=CBC Article| authorlink=Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=January 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it did not become a significant industry in the province until 1947 when huge reserves of it were discovered. Calgary quickly found itself at the centre of the ensuing [[oil boom]]. The city's economy grew when oil prices increased with the [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of 1973. The population increased by 272,000 in the eighteen years between 1971 (403,000) and 1989 (675,000) and another 345,000 in the next eighteen years (to 1,020,000 in 2007). During these boom years, [[List of Calgary's 10 tallest skyscrapers|skyscrapers]] were constructed and the relatively low-rise [[Downtown Calgary|downtown]] quickly became dense with tall buildings,&lt;ref&gt;''Calgary architecture : the boom years, 1972â1982'', Pierre S Guimond;  Brian R Sinclair, Detselig Enterprises, 1984, ISBN 0-920490-38-7.&lt;/ref&gt; a trend that continues to this day.

Calgary's economy was so closely tied to the oil industry that the city's boom peaked with the average annual price of oil in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inflationdata.com/inflation/Inflation_Rate/Historical_Oil_Prices_Table.asp|title=Historical oil prices|author=Inflation Data|accessdate=January 6, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The subsequent drop in oil prices were cited by industry as reasons for a collapse in the oil industry and consequently the overall Calgary economy. However, low oil prices prevented a full recovery until the 1990s.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Recent history===
With the energy sector employing a huge number of Calgarians, the fallout from the economic slump of the early 1980s was understandably significant, and the [[unemployment|unemployment rate]]  soared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/1971econ.html | title= Calgary's History 1971â1991| author= University of Calgary| authorlink= University of Calgary| year= 1998| accessdate= June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the decade, however, the economy was in recovery. Calgary quickly realized that it could not afford to put so much emphasis on oil and gas, and the city has since become much more diverse, both economically and culturally. The period during this recession marked Calgary's transition from a mid-sized and relatively nondescript prairie city into a major cosmopolitan and diverse centre. This transition culminated in February 1988, when the city hosted the [[1988 Winter Olympics|XV Olympic Winter Games]].&lt;ref name=timeline&gt;{{cite web| url= http://calgarypubliclibrary.com/calgary/calgarytimeline.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070820041110/http://calgarypubliclibrary.com/calgary/calgarytimeline.htm| archivedate= August 20, 2007| title= Calgary Timeline| author= Calgary Public Library| authorlink= Calgary Public Library| accessdate= June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of these games&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| date = undated | url=http://archives.cbc.ca/IDD-1-41-1322/sports/calgary_olympic_games/|title=The Winter of '88: Calgary's Olympic Games|author = Staff |accessdate= September 1, 2011 | publisher = [[CBC Sports]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; essentially put the city on the world stage.

Thanks in part to escalating oil prices, the economy in Calgary and Alberta was booming until the end of 2008, and the region of nearly 1.1 million people was home to the fastest growing economy in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.conferenceboard.ca/press/2005/Metro_winter06_Natl.asp| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20071012204049/http://conferenceboard.ca/press/2005/Metro_winter06_Natl.asp| archivedate= October 12, 2007 | title= Western cities enjoy fastest growing economies | author= The Conference Board of Canada| year= 2005 | accessdate= March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the oil and gas industry comprise an important part of the economy, the city has invested a great deal into other areas such as tourism and high-tech manufacturing. Over 3.1 million people now visit the city annually&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alberta-canada.com/statpub/tourismStatistics/pdf/AB_Calgary04.pdf|format=PDF|title=Tourism in Calgary and Area; Summary of Visitor Numbers and Revenue|author=Alberta Tourism | year= 2004|accessdate=January 6, 2006}}{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; for its many festivals and attractions, especially the [[Calgary Stampede]]. The nearby  mountain resort towns of [[Banff, Alberta|Banff]], [[Lake Louise, Alberta|Lake Louise]], and [[Canmore, Alberta|Canmore]] are also becoming increasingly popular with tourists, and are bringing people into Calgary as a result. Other modern industries include light manufacturing, high-tech, film, e-commerce, transportation, and services.

Calgary is located at the transition zone between the [[Canadian Rockies]] foothills and the [[Canadian Prairies]]. Calgary's elevation is approximately {{convert|1048|m|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]] downtown, and {{convert|1083|m|abbr=on}} at the airport. The city proper covers a land area of {{convert|726.5|km2|abbr=on}} (as of 2006)&lt;ref name=statcan2006&gt;[[Statistics Canada]] [[Canada 2006 Census|2006 Census]] (March 13, 2007) [http://www12.statcan.ca/english/census06/data/profiles/community/Details/Page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=CSD&amp;Code1=4806016&amp;Geo2=PR&amp;Code2=48&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Calgary&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;B1=All&amp;GeoLevel=&amp;GeoCode=4806016 Calgary 2006 Community Profile]. Catalogue no. 92-591-XWE. Ottawa. Retrieved March 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; and as such exceeds the land area of the City of [[Toronto]].

There are two major rivers that run through the city. The [[Bow River]] is the largest and flows from the west to the south. The [[Elbow River]] flows northwards from the south until it converges with the Bow River near [[Downtown Calgary|downtown]]. Since the climate of the region is generally dry, dense vegetation occurs naturally only in the river valleys, on some north-facing slopes, and within [[Fish Creek Provincial Park]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The city is large in physical area, consisting of an inner city surrounded by communities of various density. Unlike most cities with a sizeable metropolitan area, most of Calgary's suburbs are incorporated into the city proper, with the notable exceptions of the City of [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]] to the north, [[Cochrane, Alberta|Cochrane]] to the northwest, [[Strathmore, Alberta|Strathmore]] to the east, and the [[Springbank, Alberta|Springbank]] and [[Bearspaw, Alberta|Bearspaw]] acreages to the west. Though it is not technically within Calgary's metropolitan area, the Town of [[Okotoks, Alberta|Okotoks]] is only a short distance to the south and is considered a suburb as well. The [[Calgary Region|Calgary Economic Region]] includes slightly more area than the [[Census Metropolitan Area|CMA]] and has a population of 1,251,600&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/liveWorkPlay/Live/demographics.cfm |title=Calgary Economic Development |publisher=Calgary Economic Development |date= |accessdate= August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2008.

The city has undertaken numerous land annexation procedures over the years to keep up with growth; the most recent was completed in July 2007 and saw the city annex the neighbouring hamlet of [[Shepard, Alberta|Shepard]], and place its boundaries adjacent to the hamlet of [[Balzac, Alberta|Balzac]] and within very short distances of the City of Airdrie and Town of [[Chestermere, Alberta|Chestermere]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= City of Calgary| url= http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Development+and+Building+Approvals+and+Land+Use+Planning+and+Policy/Land+Use+Planning/Current+Studies+and+Ongoing+Activities/Annexation+Information/Annexation+Information.htm |title=Annexation Information| accessdate=August 28, 2009}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this proximity, there are presently no plans for Calgary to annex either Airdrie or Chestermere, and in fact Chestermere's administration has a growth plan in the works that calls for it annexing the intervening land between the town and Calgary.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://chestermere.ca/images/uploads/TOC_GrowthStudy_032007.pdf Town of Chestermere Growth Study]'' March 2007, p. 26.

The City of Calgary is immediately surrounded by two municipal districts, [[Rocky View County, Alberta|Rocky View County]] to the north, west and east; and [[Foothills No. 31, Alberta|Foothills No. 31]] to the south.

=== Neighbourhoods ===
{{Main|List of neighbourhoods in Calgary}}
[[File:New-Brighton-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|[[New Brighton, Calgary|New Brighton]]]]
The [[Downtown Calgary|downtown region]] of the city consists of five neighbourhoods: [[Eau Claire, Calgary|Eau Claire]] (including the Festival District), the [[Downtown West End, Calgary|Downtown West End]], the [[Downtown Calgary|Downtown Commercial Core]], [[Chinatown, Calgary|Chinatown]], and the [[Downtown East Village]] (also part of the [[Beltline, Calgary|Rivers District]]). The commercial core is itself divided into a number of districts including the [[Stephen Avenue]] Retail Core, the Entertainment District, the Arts District and the Government District. Distinct from downtown and south of 9th Avenue is Calgary's densest neighbourhood, the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]]. The area includes a number of communities such as Connaught, Victoria Crossing and a portion of the Rivers District. The Beltline is the focus of major planning and rejuvenation initiatives on the part of the [[Local government|municipal government]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.calgary.ca/DocGallery/BU/planning/pdf/centre_city/beltline/beltline_plan_one.pdf|format=PDF|title=BeltlineâArea Redevelopment Plan| author=City of Calgary|accessdate=September 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; to increase the density and liveliness of Calgary's centre.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Adjacent to, or directly radiating from [[Downtown Calgary|the downtown]] are the first of the inner-city communities. These include [[Crescent Heights, Calgary|Crescent Heights]], [[Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill, Calgary|Hounsfield Heights/Briar Hill]], [[Hillhurst, Calgary|Hillhurst]]/[[Sunnyside, Calgary|Sunnyside]] (including [[Kensington, Calgary|Kensington]] [[List of Neighbourhoods in Calgary#Business revitalization zones|BRZ]]), [[Bridgeland, Calgary|Bridgeland]], [[Renfrew, Calgary|Renfrew]], [[Mount Royal, Calgary|Mount Royal]], [[Mission, Calgary|Mission]], [[Ramsay, Calgary|Ramsay]] and [[Inglewood, Calgary|Inglewood]] and [[Radisson Heights, Calgary|Albert Park/Radisson Heights]] directly to the east. The inner city is, in turn, surrounded by relatively dense and established neighbourhoods such as [[Rosedale, Calgary|Rosedale]] and [[Mount Pleasant, Calgary|Mount Pleasant]] to the north; [[Bowness, Calgary|Bowness]], [[Parkdale, Calgary|Parkdale]] and [[Glendale, Calgary|Glendale]] to the west; [[Park Hill, Calgary|Park Hill]], [[South Calgary, Calgary|South Calgary]] (including [[Marda Loop]]), [[Bankview, Calgary|Bankview]], [[Altadore, Calgary|Altadore]], and [[Killarney, Calgary|Killarney]] to the south; and [[Forest Lawn, Calgary|Forest Lawn]]/[[International Avenue, Calgary|International Avenue]] to the east. Lying beyond these, and usually separated from one another by highways, are suburban communities including Somerset, Country Hills, Sundance, and McKenzie Towne. In all, there are over 180 distinct neighbourhoods within the city limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_766_244_0_43/http;/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City%20Living/Communities/Community%20Profiles/Community%20Profiles.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20061113063512/http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_2_766_244_0_43/http;/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Living/Communities/Community+Profiles/Community+Profiles.htm| archivedate= November 13, 2006 | title= Community Profiles | author= City of Calgary | accessdate= February 14, 2007 | month= January |year= 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several of Calgary's neighbourhoods were initially separate municipalities that were annexed by the city as it grew. These include [[Bowness, Calgary|Bowness]], [[Montgomery, Calgary|Montgomery]], and [[Forest Lawn, Alberta|Forest Lawn]].

The climate is greatly influenced by the city's [[elevation]] and proximity to the [[Rocky Mountains]]. Calgary's winters can be uncomfortably cold; but warm, dry [[Chinook wind]]s routinely blow into the city from over the mountains during the winter months, giving Calgarians a break from the cold. These winds have been known to raise the winter [[temperature]] by up to {{convert|15|C-change|0}} in just a few hours, and may last several days. The chinooks are such a common feature of Calgary's winters that only one month (January 1950) has failed to witness a thaw over more than 100 years of weather observations.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} More than one half of all winter days see the daily maximum rise above {{convert|0|C|abbr=on}}.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

Calgary is a city of extremes, and temperatures have ranged anywhere from a record low of {{convert|-45|C|0|abbr=on}} in 1893 to a record high of {{convert|36|C|0|abbr=on}} in 1919. Temperatures fall below {{convert|-30|C|abbr=on}} on about five days per year, though extreme cold spells usually do not last very long. According to [[Environment Canada]], the average temperature in Calgary ranges from a January daily average of {{convert|-9|C|0|abbr=on}} to a July daily average of {{convert|16|C|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot;&gt;[[Environment Canada]]â[http://www.climate.weatheroffice.ec.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_e.html?Province=ALL&amp;StationName=calgary&amp;SearchType=BeginsWith&amp;LocateBy=Province&amp;Proximity=25&amp;ProximityFrom=City&amp;StationNumber=&amp;IDType=MSC&amp;CityName=&amp;ParkName=&amp;LatitudeDegrees=&amp;LatitudeMinutes=&amp;LongitudeDegrees=&amp;LongitudeMinutes=&amp;NormalsClass=A&amp;SelNormals=&amp;StnId=2205&amp; Canadian Climate Normals 1971â2000].

[[File:Chinook Arch-Calgary.JPG|thumb|250px|left|A [[chinook wind|chinook]] over Calgary.]]
As a consequence of Calgary's high elevation and aridity, summer evenings can be very cool. The average summer minimum temperature drops to {{convert|8|C|abbr=on}}. Calgary may experience summer daytime temperatures exceeding {{convert|29|C|abbr=on}} anytime in June, July and August, and occasionally as late as September or as early as May. With an average [[relative humidity]] of 55% in the winter and 45% in the summer, Calgary has a dry climate similar to other cities in the western [[Great Plains]] and Canadian [[Prairies]]. Unlike cities further east such as [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Ottawa]] or even [[Winnipeg]], humidity is rarely a factor during the Calgary summer.{{citation needed|date=August 2011|reason=entire paragraph without attribution}}

The city is among the sunniest in Canada, with 2,400 hours of annual [[sunshine]], on average. [[Calgary International Airport]] in the northeastern section of the city receives an average of {{convert|412.6|mm|abbr=on|2}}  of [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] annually, with {{convert|320.6|mm|abbr=on|2}} of that occurring in the form of [[rain]], and {{convert|126.7|cm|abbr=on|1}} as [[snow]].&lt;ref name=&quot;climate&quot; /&gt; Most of the precipitation occurs from May to August, with June averaging the most monthly rainfall. In June 2005, Calgary received {{convert|248|mm|abbr=on|2}} of precipitation, making it the wettest month in the city's recorded history.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Drought]]s are not uncommon and may occur at any time of the year, lasting sometimes for months or even several years. Precipitation decreases somewhat from [[west]] to [[east]]; consequently, groves of [[tree]]s on the western outskirts largely give way to treeless [[grassland]] around the eastern city limit.

Located in southern Alberta, Calgary can endure several very [[cold wave|cold spells]] in most winters (although they are punctuated by warm spells). Snow depths of greater than 1&amp;nbsp;cm are seen on about 88 days each year in Calgary, compared with about 74 days in Toronto. However, snowfall (and temperatures) can vary considerably throughout the Calgary region â mostly due to the elevation changes, and proximity to the mountains. The Town of [[High River, Alberta|High River]] (south of Calgary) receives on average 14â15&amp;nbsp;cm less snow a year than at the Calgary Airport in North-East Calgary (based on 1971â2000 Environment Canada averages), and less than the Toronto area. Temperatures tend to be slightly warmer in the southern areas of Calgary as well.

Calgary averages more than 22 days a year with [[thunderstorm]]s, with most all of them occurring in the summer months. Calgary lies on the edge of Alberta's [[hail]]storm alley and is prone to damaging hailstorms every few years. A hailstorm that struck Calgary on September 7, 1991, was one of the most destructive [[natural disaster]]s in [[History of Canada|Canadian history]], with over $400 million dollars in damage.&lt;ref&gt;

The district is home to many ethnic restaurants and stores.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

While many Calgarians continue to live in the city's suburbs, more central districts such as [[Beltline, Calgary|17 Avenue]], [[Kensington, Calgary|Kensington]], [[Inglewood, Calgary|Inglewood]], [[International Avenue, Calgary|Forest Lawn]], [[Marda Loop]] and the [[Mission, Calgary|Mission District]] have become more popular and density in those areas has increased.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} The nightlife and the availability of cultural venues in these areas has gradually begun to evolve as a result.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[Calgary Public Library]] is the city's public library network, with seventeen branches loaning books, e-books, CDs, DVDs, Blu-rays, audio books, and more.  Based on borrowing, the library is the second largest in Canada, and sixth-largest municipal library system in North America.  Nonetheless, the it ranks twenty-fourth in Canadian per capita municipal funding, according to the Urban Libraries Council.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}}

Calgary is the site of the [[Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium]] performing arts, culture and community facility. The auditorium is one of two &quot;twin&quot; facilities in the province, the other located in Edmonton, each being locally known as the &quot;Jube.&quot; The 2,538-seat auditorium was opened in 1957&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jubileeauditorium.com/southern/about/who_we_are.asp|title=Auditoria History|author=Southern Alberta Jubilee Auditorium|accessdate=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been host to hundreds of [[Musical theatre|Broadway musical]], theatrical, stage and local productions. The Calgary Jube is the resident home of the [[Alberta Ballet]], the [[Calgary opera]], the [[Kiwanis Music Festival]], and the annual civic [[Remembrance Day]] ceremonies. Both auditoriums operate 365 days a year, and are run by the provincial government.  Both received major renovations as part of the province's centennial in 2005.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The city is also home to a number of theatre companies; among them are [[One Yellow Rabbit]], which shares the [[EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts]] with the [[Calgary Philharmonic Orchestra]], as well as [[Theatre Calgary]], [[Alberta Theatre Projects]] and Theatre Junction Grand, culture house dedicated for the contemporary live arts. Calgary was also the birthplace of the [[improvisational theatre]] games known as [[Theatresports]]. The [[Calgary International Film Festival]] is also held in the city annually, as well as the [[International Festival of Animated Objects]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Visual and conceptual artists like the art collective [[United Congress]] are active in the city.

{{Main|Sport in Calgary}}
[[File:Cop.jpg|thumb|right|[[Canada Olympic Park]]]]
In large part due to its proximity to the [[Canadian Rockies|Rocky Mountains]], Calgary has traditionally been a popular destination for winter sports. Since hosting the [[1988 Winter Olympics]], the city has also been home to a number of major winter sporting facilities such as [[Canada Olympic Park]] ([[luge]], [[cross-country skiing]], [[ski jumping]], [[downhill|downhill skiing]], [[snowboarding]], and some summer sports) and the [[Olympic Oval]] ([[speed skating]] and [[ice hockey|hockey]]). These facilities serve as the primary training venues for a number of competitive athletes. Also, Canada Olympic Park serves as a mountain biking trail in the summer months.

In the summer, the [[Bow River]] is very popular among fly-fishermen. Golfing is also an extremely popular activity for Calgarians and the region has a large number of courses.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Calgary hosted the 2009 World Water Ski Championship Festival in August, at the Predator Bay Water Ski Club which is situated approximately {{convert|40|km|abbr=off}} south of the city.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

[[File:PengrowthSaddledomeNight.jpg|thumb|left|[[Scotiabank Saddledome]]]]
As part of the wider [[Battle of Alberta]], the city's sports teams enjoy a popular rivalry with their Edmonton counterparts, most notably the rivalries between the [[National Hockey League]]'s [[Calgary Flames]] and [[Edmonton Oilers]], and the [[Canadian Football League]]'s [[Calgary Stampeders]] and [[Edmonton Eskimos]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The city also has a large number of urban parks including [[Fish Creek Provincial Park]], [[Nose Hill Park]], [[Bowness, Calgary|Bowness Park]], [[Edworthy Park]], the [[Inglewood, Calgary|Inglewood]] [[Animal Sanctuary|Bird Sanctuary]], [[Confederation Park, Calgary|Confederation Park]], and [[Prince's Island Park]]. Nose Hill Park is the largest municipal park in Canada.

{{Main|List of attractions and landmarks in Calgary}}
[[File:CalgaryIsland.jpg|200px|left|thumb|Downtown Calgary seen from [[Prince's Island Park|Prince's Island]]]]
[[Downtown Calgary|Downtown]] features an eclectic mix of restaurants and bars, cultural venues, public squares (including [[Olympic Plaza (Calgary)|Olympic Plaza]]) and shopping.  Notable shopping areas include such as [[The Core Shopping Centre, Canada|The Core Shopping Centre]] (formerly [[Calgary Eaton Centre]]/[[TD Square]]), [[Stephen Avenue]] and [[Eau Claire Market]]. Downtown [[tourist attraction]]s include the [[Calgary Zoo]], the [[Telus World of Science, Calgary|Telus World of Science]], the [[Telus]] [[Convention center|Convention Centre]], the [[Chinatown, Calgary|Chinatown]] district, the [[Glenbow Museum]], the [[Calgary Tower]], the Art Gallery of Calgary (AGC), Military Museum and  the [[EPCOR Centre for the Performing Arts]]. At {{convert|2.5|acre|ha|lk=out}}, the [[Devonian Gardens (Calgary)|Devonian Gardens]] is one of the largest urban indoor gardens in the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_780_247_0_43/http%3B/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Living/Parks+and+Cemeteries/Parks/Devonian+Gardens/Devonian+Gardens.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20071013191918/http://calgary.ca/portal/server.pt/gateway/PTARGS_0_0_780_247_0_43/http;/content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Living/Parks+and+Cemeteries/Parks/Devonian+Gardens/Devonian+Gardens.htm|archivedate=October 13, 2007| title= Devonian Gardens|author=City of Calgary|accessdate=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is located on the 4th floor of TD Square (above the shopping). The [[Downtown Calgary|downtown region]] is also home to [[Prince's Island Park (Calgary)|Prince's Island Park]], an urban park located just north of the Eau Claire district. Directly to the south of downtown is [[Beltline, Calgary|Midtown]] and the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]]. This area is quickly becoming one of the city's densest and most active mixed use areas.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} At the district's core is the popular &quot;[[Beltline, Calgary|17 Avenue]]&quot;, which is known for its many bars and nightclubs, restaurants, and shopping venues. During the [[Calgary Flames]]' playoff run in 2004, 17 Avenue was frequented by over 50,000 fans and supporters per game night. The concentration of red jersey-wearing fans led to the street's playoff moniker, the &quot;[[Red Mile]].&quot; Downtown is easily accessed using the city's [[C-Train]] light rail (LRT) [[Public transport|transit system]].

Attractions on the west side of the city include the [[Heritage Park Historical Village]] historical park, depicting life in pre-1914 Alberta and featuring working historic vehicles such as a [[steam locomotive|steam train]], paddlewheel boat and electric streetcar. The village itself comprises a mixture of replica buildings and historic structures relocated from southern Alberta. Other major city attractions include [[Canada Olympic Park]], and [[Spruce Meadows]]. In addition to the many shopping areas in the city centre, there are a number of large suburban shopping complexes in the city. Among the largest are [[Chinook Centre]] and [[Southcentre Mall]] in the south, WestHills and Signal Hill in the southwest, South Trail Crossing and Deerfoot Meadows in the southeast, [[Market Mall]] in the northwest, [[Sunridge Mall]] in the northeast, and the newly built [[CrossIron Mills]] just north of the Calgary city limits, and south of the City of [[Airdrie, Alberta|Airdrie]].

[[File:Stephen-Ave-West-Szmurlo.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Stephen Avenue]]]]
[[Downtown Calgary|Downtown]] can be recognized by its numerous skyscrapers. Some of these structures, such as the [[Calgary Tower]] and the [[Scotiabank Saddledome]] are unique enough to be symbols of Calgary. Office buildings tend to concentrate within the commercial core, while residential towers occur most frequently within the Downtown West End and the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]], south of downtown. These buildings are iconographic of the city's booms and busts, and it is easy to recognize the various phases of development that have shaped the image of downtown. The first skyscraper building boom occurred during the late 1950s and continued through to the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} After 1980, during the recession, many high-rise construction projects were immediately halted.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} It was not until the late 1980s and through to the early 1990s that major construction began again, initiated by the [[1988 Winter Olympics]] and stimulated by the growing economy.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

In total, there are 10 office towers that are at least 150 metres (500&amp;nbsp;ft) (usually around 40 floors) or higher. The tallest of these is the [[Suncor Energy Centre]] (formerly known as the Petro-Canada Centre), which is the tallest office tower in Canada outside [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=emporis&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=112525| title= Petro-Canada CentreâWest Tower| author= Emporis | authorlink= Emporis| year= 2007| accessdate= April 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calgary's [[Bankers Hall]] Towers are also the tallest twin towers in Canada. Several larger office towers are planned for downtown: [[The Bow (skyscraper)|The Bow]], Jamieson Place, [[Eighth Avenue Place (Calgary)|Eighth Avenue Place]] (two towers), Centennial Place (two towers), City Centre (two towers), and the highly anticipated (although only rumoured) Imperial Oil and [[First Canadian Centre]] II towers.
As of 2008, there were 264 completed high-rise buildings, with 42 more under construction, another 13 approved for construction and 63 more proposed.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

To connect many of the downtown office buildings, the city also boasts the world's most extensive [[skyway]] network (elevated indoor pedestrian bridges), officially called the [[+15]]. The name derives from the fact that the bridges are usually {{convert|15|ft|m}} above grade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Living/Recreation+and+Leisure/Activities/Walking/Plus+15.htm|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070821194436/http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Living/Recreation+and+Leisure/Activities/Walking/Plus+15.htm|archivedate=August 21, 2007|title=Plus 15|author=The City of Calgary|month=February|year=2007|accessdate=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Government and politics==
[[File:Calgary city hall1.jpg|right|thumb|Calgary's New City Hall and Old City Hall]]
Calgary is generally considered a conservative city, dominated by traditional [[social conservatism|small-c social conservatives]] and [[conservatism|fiscal conservatives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/frontierpoli.html | title= Calgary's Politics 1895â1946| author= University of Calgary | authorlink= University of Calgary| year= 1997| accessdate= June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the city is a corporate power-centre, a high percentage of the workforce is employed in white-collar jobs. The high concentration of oil and gas corporation led to the rise of [[Peter Lougheed]]'s [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta|Progressive Conservative Party]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/calgary/1971poli.html| title= Calgary's Politics 1971â1991| author= University of Calgary | authorlink= University of Calgary| year= 1997| accessdate= June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1990s the city's mainstream [[political culture]] was dominated by the right-wing [[Reform Party of Canada]] federally, and the Progressive Conservatives provincially.

The [[Green Party of Canada]] has also made inroads in Calgary, exemplified by results of the [[Canadian federal election, 2004|2004 federal election]] where they achieved 7.5% of the vote across the city and 11.3% in the [[Calgary Centre-North|Calgary North Centre]] riding.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} The right-wing [[Alberta Alliance]] became active during the [[26th Alberta general election]] and campaigned for fiscally and socially conservative reforms.  However, the Alberta Alliance and its successor, the [[Wildrose Alliance]], did not manage to make inroads in the [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 provincial election]].

However, as Calgary's population has increased, so has the diversity of its politics. One growing alternative movement was recently active during the 2000 World Petroleum Congress demonstrations and the [[J26 G8 Protests|J26 G8 2002 protests]]. Protesters were a mix of locals and outsiders. The city has chapters of various activist organizations, as well as an [[Anti-Capitalist Convergence]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Municipal politics===
Calgary is governed in accordance with Alberta's Municipal Government Act (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/574.cfm?page=m26.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779756155&amp;display=html|author=Alberta Queen's Printer|title=Municipal Government Act|date=1994-2000|accessdate=August 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calgarians elect 14 ward [[Alderman#In Canada|aldermen]] and a mayor to [[Calgary City Council]] every three years. The next election is scheduled for October 2013, at which point the title of ''alderman'' will be changed to ''councillor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary+rejects+alderman+label+after+years/3972721/story.html |title=Calgary Rejects Alderman Label After 116 Years |author= Markusoff, Jason |date=December 14, 2010 | work = [[Calgary Herald]] |accessdate=December 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naheed Nenshi]] was elected mayor in the [[Calgary municipal election, 2010|2010 municipal election]].

The city has an [[operating budget]] of $2.1 billion for 2007, supported 41% by [[property tax]]es. Property taxes collected equal $757 million annually, with $386 million from residential and $371 million from non-residential properties. Fifty-four% of expenditures are for city employee salary, wages, and benefits.{{Update after|2007}}{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Two school boards operate independently of each other in Calgary, the public and the separate systems. Both boards have 7 elected trustees each representing 2 of 14 wards. The School Boards are considered to be part of municipal politics in Calgary as they are elected at the same time as City Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Election and Information Services|url=http://www.calgary.ca/election|publisher=City of Calgary|accessdate=September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provincial politics===
Calgary is represented by twenty-three [[Legislative Assembly of Alberta|provincial MLAs]], including sixteen members of the Progressive Conservatives, four members of the [[Alberta Liberal Party|Alberta Liberals]], two members of the Wildrose Alliance and one member of the [[Alberta Party]]. For exactly fourteen years (from December 14, 1992, to December 14, 2006), the provincial premier and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party of Alberta, [[Ralph Klein]], held the [[Calgary Elbow]] seat.  Klein was elected to the Legislative Assembly of Alberta in 1989 and resigned on September 20, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{subscription required|date=September 2011}} {{Cite news| url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20060331.wklein0401/BNStory/National/home| title= Klein Takes Devastating Blow to Leadership| work = [[The Globe &amp; Mail]] | accessdate=April 1, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded as provincial premier and leader of the Progressive Conservative Party by [[Ed Stelmach]], MLA for [[Fort Saskatchewan-Vegreville]].  Following this [[Progressive Conservative Association of Alberta leadership election, 2006|leadership change]], Calgary saw its leadership and representation on provincial matters further reduced as its representation on the provincial cabinet was reduced from eight to three&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.cbc.ca/canada/edmonton/story/2006/12/20/ed-cabinet-reax.html | title= New Alberta Cabinet Too White, Too Male, Too Tural: Critics | author= Staff | date = December 20, 2006 | accessdate= September 17, 2011 | publisher = [[CBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only one Calgary MLA, Greg Melchin, retaining a cabinet seat. In June 2007, Ralph Klein's old riding, a seat the PC Party held since it took office in 1971 fell to Alberta Liberal [[Craig Cheffins]] during a [[by-election]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20070613/alta_rx_070613/20070613?hub=Canada | title= Byelection Surprise Shakes Up Alberta Politics | publisher = [[CTV News]] | date = June 13, 2007 | accessdate= September 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run up to the 2008 general election, pundits predicted significant Tory losses in traditional stronghold that many felt was being taken for granted and ignored.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

The [[Alberta general election, 2008|2008 Alberta general election]] saw the Liberals increase their seat count in the city by one to five.  While the results in Calgary were not particularly surprising given the grievances especially in Central Calgary with the Stelmach administration, the fact that they happened in the face of significant PC gains in Edmonton was.  The Liberals were reduced to nine seats overall, meaning for the first time ever the majority of their caucus represented Calgary ridings.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

===Federal politics===
All eight of Calgary's [[Canadian House of Commons|federal MPs]] are members of the [[Conservative Party of Canada]] (CPC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.ca/scripts/OVR2006/25/table11.html|title=Voting results by electoral district|author=Elections Canada|year=2006|accessdate=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CPC's predecessors have traditionally held the majority of the city's federal seats. The federal [[electoral district (Canada)|electoral district]] of [[Calgary Southwest]] is held by Prime Minister and CPC leader [[Stephen Harper]]. Coincidentally, the same seat was also held by [[Preston Manning]], the leader of the [[Reform Party of Canada]], a predecessor of CPC. [[Joe Clark]], former [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] and former leader of the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Canada]] (also a predecessor of the CPC), held the riding of [[Calgary Centre]]. Of Canada's 22 prime ministers, two have represented a Calgary riding while prime minister. The first was [[R. B. Bennett]] from [[Calgary West]], who held that position from 1930 to 1935.

Calgary is recognized as a Canadian leader in the oil and gas industry as well as for being a leader in economic expansion.&lt;ref name=&quot;calgary.ca&quot;&gt;[http://www.calgary.ca/docgallery/bu/finance/economics/policy_analysis/briefing_note_4.pdf ]{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its high personal income,&lt;ref name=&quot;calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/relocate/calgarys-economy |title=Calgary's Economy |publisher=Calgary Economic Development |date= |accessdate= August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; low unemployment and high GDP per capita&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tableaudebordmontreal.com/comparons/activiteeconomique/pibpercapita.en.html?mode=print |title=GDP per capita |publisher=Tableaudebordmontreal.com |date= |accessdate= August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; have all benefitted from increased sales and prices due to a resource boom,&lt;ref name=&quot;calgary.ca&quot;/&gt; and increasing economic diversification. Because of these strengths, Calgary is designated as a [[global city]] by the Globalization and World Cities Research Network.&lt;ref name=Global2011 /&gt;

Calgary benefits from a relatively stronger job market in Alberta, is part of the Calgary-Edmonton Corridor, one of the fastest growing regions in the country. It is the head office for many major oil and gas related companies, and many financial service business have grown up around them. Small business and self-employment levels also rank amongst the highest in Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;calgaryheralddigitalmedia.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calgaryheralddigitalmedia.com/mediakit/calgary-ecomomy |title=Calgary Economy | work = [[Calgary Herald]] |date= |accessdate= August 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also a major distribution and transportation hub with high retail sales.&lt;ref name=&quot;calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com&quot;/&gt;

Calgary's economy is decreasingly dominated by the oil and gas industry, although it is still the single largest contributor to the city's GDP. In 2006, Calgary's real GDP (in constant 1997 dollars) was [[C$]]52.386 billion, of which oil, gas and mining contributed 12%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/relocateAndExpand/RECalgaryEconomy/gdp.cfm | title= Real GDP by Industry: Calgary Economic Region, 2006 | author= Calgary Economic Development | year= 2006 | accessdate= March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The larger oil and gas companies are [[British Petroleum Canada|BP]], [[Canadian Natural Resources Limited]], [[EnCana Corporation|EnCana]], [[Imperial Oil]], [[Suncor Energy]], [[Shell Canada]], [[TransCanada Corporation|TransCanada]], and [[Nexen Inc.]], making the city home to 87% of Canada's oil and [[natural gas]] producers and 66% of coal producers.&lt;ref name=AlbertaFirst&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.albertafirst.com/profiles/statspack/20366.html | title= Calgary | author = Alberta First | year= 2007 | accessdate = March 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levels of employment in Construction are both fairly high, exceed Canadian averages, and have grown 16% between 2006 and 2010.

Calgary has a number of unique schools, including the country's first high school exclusively designed for Olympic-calibre athletes,{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} the [[National Sport School (Canada)|National Sport School]]. Calgary is also home to many [[private school]]s including Mountain View Academy, Rundle College, [[Rundle Academy]], [[Clear Water Academy]], Chinook Winds Adventist Academy, Webber Academy,Delta West Academy, Masters Academy, Menno Simons Christian School, [[West Island College]] and [[Edge School]].

Calgary is also home to Western Canada's largest public high school, [[Lord Beaverbrook High School]], with 2,241 students enrolled in the 2005â2006 [[Academic term|school year]].{{update after|2006}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.cbe.ab.ca/schools/view.asp?id=75 | title= Lord Beaverbrook High School | author= Calgary Board of Education | authorlink= Calgary Board of Education | year= 2007 | accessdate= May 10, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently the student population of Lord Beaverbrook is 2013 students (2009) and several other schools are equally as large; [[Western Canada High School]] with 2035 students (2009) and Sir Winston Churchill High School with 1983 students (2009).

Calgary is the site of five major public post-secondary institutions.

==Transportation==
{{Main|Transportation in Calgary}}
[[File:CT SD160 2.jpg|right|thumb|Calgary's [[C-Train]] system.]]
Calgary is a transportation hub for much of central and western Canada. [[Calgary International Airport|Calgary International Airport (YYC)]], in the city's northeast, is the third largest in Canada by aircraft movements and is a major cargo hub. [[Non-stop flight|Non-stop]] destinations include cities throughout Canada, the United States, Europe, Central America, and Asia.  Calgary's presence on the [[Trans-Canada Highway]] and the [[Canadian Pacific Railway|Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR)]] mainline (which includes the [[CPR Alyth Yard]]) also make it an important hub for freight. The  [[Rocky Mountaineer]] and [[Royal Canadian Pacific]] operates railtour  service to Calgary; [[Via Rail]] no longer provides intercity rail service to Calgary.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Calgary maintains a major streets network and a freeway system.  Much of the system is on a grid where roads are numbered with avenues running eastâwest and streets running northâsouth.  Until 1904 the streets were named; after that date, all streets were given numbers radiating outwards from the city centre.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Odd History of Calgary's City Streets&quot;&gt;

  | accessdate = June 23, 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Roads in predominantly residential areas as well as freeways and expressways do not generally conform to the grid and are usually not numbered as a result.  However, it is a developer and city convention in Calgary that non-numbered streets within a new community have the same name prefix as the community itself so that streets can more easily be located within the city.

[[Calgary Transit]] provides public transportation services throughout the city with buses and light rail.  Calgary's rail system, known as the [[C-Train]] was one of the first such systems in North America (behind [[Edmonton LRT]] and [[San Diego Trolley]]) and consists of three lines (two routes) on {{convert|48.8|km|mi}} of track (mostly at grade with a dedicated [[Right-of-way (railroad)|right-of-way]] carrying 42% of the downtown working population).  In the fourth quarter of 2009, the C-Train system had an average of 266,100 riders per weekday, the third-busiest light-rail system in North America behind the [[Monterrey Metro]],&lt;ref name=&quot;INEGI-Monterrey&quot;&gt;

As an alternative to the over {{convert|260|km|mi}} of shared bikeways on streets, the city has a network of multi-use (bicycle, walking, rollerblading, etc.) paths spanning over {{convert|635|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name=pathway/&gt;

==Health care==
;Medical centres and hospitals

[[File:Rockyview-Szmurlo.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Rockyview General Hospital]] overlooking the [[Glenmore Reservoir]]]]

Calgary has three major adult [[acute care]] hospitals and one major pediatric acute care site; the [[Foothills Medical Centre]], which is the largest hospital in Alberta, the [[Peter Lougheed Centre]], the [[Rockyview General Hospital]], and the [[Alberta Children's Hospital]], which is the largest hospital in the prairie provinces for sick kids, respectively. They are all overseen by the [[Alberta Health Services]]: [[Calgary Health Region]]. Calgary is also home to the [[Tom Baker Cancer Centre]], the leading cancer centre in Alberta (located at the Foothills Medical Centre), the Grace Women's Health Centre, which provides a variety of care, and the [[Libin Cardiovascular Institute]]. In addition, the [[Sheldon M. Chumir Centre]] (a large 24 hour assessment clinic), and the Richmond Road Diagnostic and Treatment Centre (RRDTC), as well as hundreds of smaller medical and dental clinics operate in Calgary. The [[University of Calgary]] [[Faculty of Medicine of the University of Calgary|Medical Centre]] also operates in partnership with the Calgary Health Region, by researching cancer, cardiovascular, diabetes, joint injury, arthritis and genetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/liveWorkPlay/Live/health/calgaryHospitals.cfm | title= Medical Research | author= Calgary Economic Development | year= 2006 | accessdate= March 13, 2007| archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070204052250/http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/liveWorkPlay/Live/health/calgaryHospitals.cfm| archivedate = February 4, 2007}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The four largest Calgary hospitals have a combined total of more than 2,100 beds, and employ over 11,500 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.calgaryeconomicdevelopment.com/liveWorkPlay/Live/health/calgaryHospitals.cfm | title= Calgary Hospitals | author= Calgary Economic Development | year= 2006 | accessdate= March 13, 2007}}{{dead link|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Military==
{{Main|Military in Calgary}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}
The presence of the Canadian military has been part of the local economy and culture since the early years of the 20th century, beginning with the assignment of a squadron of [[Lord Strathcona's Horse (Royal Canadians)|Strathcona's Horse]]. After many failed attempts to create the city's own unit, the [[103rd Regiment &quot;Calgary Rifles&quot;]] was finally authorized on April 1, 1910. [[CFB Calgary|Canadian Forces Base (CFB) Calgary]] was established as Currie Barracks and Harvie Barracks following the Second World War. The base remained the most significant [[Department of National Defence (Canada)|Department of National Defence (DND)]] institution in the city until it was decommissioned in 1998, when most of the units moved to [[CFB Edmonton]]. Despite this closure there is still a number of [[Canadian Forces]] Reserve units, and cadet units garrisoned throughout the city. They include {{HMCS|Tecumseh}} Naval Reserve unit, [[The King's Own Calgary Regiment (RCAC)]], [[The Calgary Highlanders]] (and [[Regimental Pipes and Drums of The Calgary Highlanders|band]]), [[746 Communication Squadron]], 14 (Calgary) Service Battalion, 15 (Edmonton) Field Ambulance Detachment Calgary, 14 (Edmonton) Military Police Platoon Calgary, 41CER detachment Calgary (33 Engineer Squadron), along with a small cadre of Regular Force support.

==Contemporary issues==
The economic boom and rapid growth recently experienced in Calgary has led to issues such as [[urban sprawl]] and an [[infrastructure]] backlog. With no geographical barriers to its growth besides the [[Tsuu T'ina Nation 145, Alberta|Tsuu T'ina First Nation]], the city has seen suburbs spread increasingly further out at an accelerated rate. This has led to difficulties in providing necessary transportation infrastructure to Calgary's population.

[[File:Calgary West End.jpg|thumb|[[Condominium]]s in the [[Downtown West End, Calgary|Downtown West End]]]]
With the redevelopment of the [[Beltline, Calgary|Beltline]] and the [[Downtown East Village]] at the forefront, efforts are underway to vastly increase the density of the inner city, but this has not stopped the rate of sprawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url= http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/sprawl/0928a.html | title= Growing Pains Plague Calgary | work= [[The Globe and Mail]] | date = September 2000 | accessdate= June 28, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070930041738/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/series/sprawl/0928a.html|archivedate=September 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, the combined population of the downtown neighbourhoods ([[Downtown Calgary|the Downtown Commercial Core]], the [[Downtown East Village, Calgary|Downtown East Village]], the [[Downtown West End, Calgary|Downtown West End]], [[Eau Claire, Calgary|Eau Claire]], and [[Chinatown, Calgary|Chinatown]]) was just over 12,600. In addition, the Beltline to the south of downtown had a population of 17,200,&lt;ref name=popcalgary&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.calgary.ca/DocGallery/BU/cityclerks/popcomparisonbycomm.pdf |format=PDF| author= City of Calgary | title= Community Population Comparison | year=2006 | accessdate= July 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a total of around 30,000.

Because of the growth of the city, its southwest borders are now immediately adjacent to the [[Tsuu T'ina Nation 145, Alberta|Tsuu T'ina Nation Indian reserve]]. Recent [[residential development]]s in the deep southwest of the city have created a demand for a major roadway heading into the interior of the city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Transportation+Planning/Southwest+Ring+Road/Southwest+Ring+Road+Introduction.htm| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070617030902/http://content.calgary.ca/CCA/City+Hall/Business+Units/Transportation+Planning/Southwest+Ring+Road/Southwest+Ring+Road+Introduction.htm| archivedate= June 17, 2007 | title= Southwest Calgary Ring Road | publisher = City of Calgary | date = October 2006 | year= 2006 | accessdate= March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; but because of complications in negotiations with the [[Tsuu T'ina Nation|Tsuu T'ina]] about the construction, the  construction has not yet begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.infratrans.gov.ab.ca/INFTRA_Content/docType490/Production/SWCRRCommunityUpdateJuly06.pdf |format=PDF| title= Southwest Calgary Ring Road | author= Alberta Infrastructure and Transportation | date = July 2006 | accessdate= March 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city has many [[socioeconomics|socioeconomic]] issues including [[homelessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgary.ca/docgallery/bu/cns/homelessness/2006_calgary_homeless_count.pdf| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070605122544/http://www.calgary.ca/docgallery/bu/cns/homelessness/2006_calgary_homeless_count.pdf| archivedate= June 5, 2007 |format=PDF| title= Count of Homeless Persons in Calgary | year= 2006 | accessdate=February 27, 2007| author= City of Calgary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain portions of [[Downtown Calgary|downtown core]] and inner city have been singled out as being home to much higher proportions of disadvantaged residents, as well as some neighbourhoods in the city's east. The share of poor families living in very poor neighbourhoods increased from 6.4% to 20.3% between 1980 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.hrsdc.gc.ca/en/cs/sp/sdc/pkrf/publications/bulletins/1998-000028/page13.shtml | title= More Poor Families Living in Very Poor Neighbourhoods| author= Human Resources and Social Development Canada| date = May 1998 | accessdate= June 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Calgary and Alberta have traditionally been affordable places to live, substantial growth (much of it due to the prosperous energy sector and the northern [[Tar sands|oil sands]] projects) has led to increasing demand on [[real estate|real-estate]]. As a result, [[Real estate pricing|house prices]] in Calgary have increased significantly in recent years, but have stagnated  over the last half of 2007, and into 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.calgaryrep.com |title= Summary Listings &amp; Sales, Average Price Graphs | author= Calgary Real Estate Board | year= 2008 | accessdate=May 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of November 2006, Calgary is the most expensive city in Canada for commercial/downtown office space,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.colliersmn.com/prod/cclod.nsf/publish/61FCCBBD88CFB7DD852571B5006E26EB/$File/OfficeMarket.pdf| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20070605122544/http://www.colliersmn.com/prod/cclod.nsf/publish/61FCCBBD88CFB7DD852571B5006E26EB/$File/OfficeMarket.pdf| archivedate= June 5, 2007 |format=PDF| title= Calgary's Office Space Most Expensive in Canada | author= [[Colliers International]] | date = July 2006 |accessdate= February 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the second most expensive city (second to Vancouver) for residential real-estate. The cost of living and inflation is now the highest in the country, recent figures show that inflation was running at six per cent in April 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | url= http://www.canada.com/calgaryherald/news/calgarybusiness/story.html?id=7eb8cbf4-df63-4910-a4c3-c8a89e955750&amp;k=30022 | title= Calgary Country's Inflation Capital | work = [[Calgary Herald]] | date = June 20, 2007 |accessdate= September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crime===
In March 2008, City Council approved a pilot project to test [[closed-circuit television]] (CCTV) surveillance cameras. A total of sixteen CCTV cameras were to be installed in three downtown locations. They were to be deployed in the East Village and along the Stephen Avenue Mall. The project began in early 2009, primarily being led by Animal &amp; Bylaw Services.&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2011}} {{cite web|url=http://www.gov.calgary.ab.ca/citybeat/public/2009/01/release.20090113_121033_1694_0 |title= Citybeat&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; City of Calgary Press Release |accessdate=February 1, 2009 | author =Press Release |publisher=City of Calgary |date=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the city has a relatively low crime rate when compared to other North American cities, gangs and drug-related crime have increased along with the recent economy growth. In 2009, 62 additional police officers were deployed as foot patrols in the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = Staff | date = May 27, 2009 | url=http://calgary.ctv.ca/servlet/an/local/CTVNews/20090527/CGY_Beat_Downtown_090527/20090527?hub=CalgaryHome|title=Beat Cops Hit the Streets| publisher = [[CTV News]] |accessdate= September 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
