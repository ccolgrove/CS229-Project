'''Andrew Orlowski''' (born [[1966]]) is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[columnist]] for the online IT news and opinion website ''[[The Register]]''.

==Early career==
In 1992, Orlowski started an alternative newspaper in [[Manchester]], [[England]] called ''[[Badpress]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;badpress_background&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, [http://www.badpress.net/badpress/contents.html Badpress: Manchester 1992-93 contents], Badpress&lt;/ref&gt; He has also written for ''[[Private Eye]]'' magazine.&lt;ref name=&quot;prnewswire_page&quot;&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.co.uk/cgi/news/release?id=17458 Internet Porn: &quot;Government report suppressed&quot;], PR Newswire, 6 September 1996&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1990s, he worked at [[Dennis Publishing]], on the magazine ''[[PC Pro]]'', and at [[Ziff Davis UK]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==''The Register''==
Orlowski became a columnist based in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[United States|U.S.]] for ''[[The Register]]'' in 2000.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} In April 2003, he coined the term [[googlewashing]] to describe the potential for well-linked [[Blog|weblogs]] to obscure the original meaning of a controversial expression (e.g., &quot;the [[Second Superpower]]&quot;).&lt;ref name=&quot;antiwarslogan&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2003/04/03/antiwar_slogan_coined_repurposed/ Anti-war slogan coined, repurposed and Googlewashedâ¦ in 42 days], ''[[The Register]]'', 3 April 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Orlowski later classified this&lt;ref name=&quot;orlowski_faq&quot;&gt;[http://www.badpress.net/stories/faq.html Andrew Orlowski's FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; along with &quot;absurd [[intellectual property]] claims&quot; as an example of an unwarranted assumption of power or [[authority]] to gain [[Sociology|sociological]] advantage on behalf of a particular [[Lobbying|lobby]] group. &lt;!--This factor is the core of what makes a story &quot;great&quot;, he argues.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}--&gt; &lt;!--what does this mean?--&gt;

In December 2004, he was invited to assemble a panel on [[techno-utopianism]] at [[Harvard Law School]]'s [[Berkman Center for Internet and Society]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/is2k4/session_descriptions#orlowski Mistakes Techno Utopians Make: Fantasy Politics and the Disappearing Social] December 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Orlowski argues that this form of utopianism distracts attention and diverts capital away from solving real infrastructure problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;six_things_about_bubble&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, [http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/10/07/six_things_about_the_bubble/ Six Things you need to know about Bubble 2.0], ''The Register'', 7 October 2005&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Technology can help us,&quot; he writes on his FAQ page.&lt;ref name=&quot;orlowski_faq&quot;/&gt; &quot;But we venerate the machines we have, which aren't very good, and worse, limit ourselves to seeing the world through this machine metaphor. Technology is useful when it makes something we already like to do easier. Technology can't tell us something we don't know.  Technology cannot solve problems that don't exist.&quot;{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

===Criticism of Wikipedia===

After making passing references since Wikipedia was announced in 2001, Orlowski first criticized [[Wikipedia]] in ''The Register'' in mid-2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;bucky&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/14/buckminster_fuller_stamp/ Buckminster Fuller on stamp duty]&quot;, ''The Register'', July 14, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and what began as incidental mockery&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; often involving responses to reader's emails and characterised by his coinage of the neologism ''wiki-fiddler''&lt;ref name=&quot;big_book&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/07/23/wiki_fiddlers_big_book/ Wiki-fiddlers defend Clever Big Book]&quot;, ''The Register'', July 23, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; soon became a regular subject of his journalism. To Orlowski, Wikipedia is &quot;a hobby, a multiplayer game and a repository for fan trivia&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;cronky&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/16/wikipedia_britannica_science_comparison/ Wikipedia science 31% more cronky than Britannica's]&quot;, ''The Register'', December 16, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; with the accuracy of articles varying &quot;from the occasionally passable to the frequently risible, while its all-important readability is even worse &amp;mdash; and deteriorating.&quot;

By December 2005, several such articles were being published each week, with subject matter including the characterisation of Wikipedia's co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]] as a petty hypocrite and pornographer&lt;ref name=&quot;who_owns_bio&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/06/wikipedia_bio/ Who owns your Wikipedia bio?]&quot;, ''The Register'', December 6, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and average Wikipedians as rebellious children (&quot;He's 14, he's got acne, he's got a lot of problems with authority ... and he's got an encyclopedia on dar interweb.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;morality&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/12/wikipedia_no_responsibility/ There's no Wikipedia entry for 'moral responsibility']&quot;, ''The Register'', 12 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;), as well as a spoof article which announced that Wales had been shot.&lt;ref name=&quot;spoof&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/17/jimmy_wales_shot_dead_says_wikipedia/ Wikipedia founder 'shot by friend of Siegenthaler']&quot;, ''The Register'', December 17, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Orlowski's comments indicate he believes Wikipedia is undergoverned (and thus of poor quality and morally hazardous&lt;ref name=&quot;cronky&quot; /&gt;) and unnecessary (in that &quot;expensive databases&quot; of information will become publicly accessible in the near future&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; &quot;The good stuff will just come out of a computer network&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;morality&quot; /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; and well-capitalised enterprises will provide &quot;much more attractive&quot; alternatives&lt;ref name=&quot;manyone&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/12/19/sanger_onlinepedia_with_experts/ $10m for a Wikipedia for grown-ups]&quot;, ''The Register'', December 19, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;). In April 2006, Orlowski expanded on these themes in an article for ''[[The Guardian]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.guardian.co.uk/weekly/story/0,,1752257,00.html|title=A thirst for knowledge|publisher=The Guardian|author=Andrew Orlowski|date=2006-04-13|accessdate=2006-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he was the first{{cn|date=December 2011}} journalist to draw attention to a then-new web site, Wikitruth, critical of Wikipedia.

===Criticism of the Open Rights Group and peer-to-peer===
In a number of attack articles, he has dubbed activists of the [[Open Rights Group]], the UK [[Pirate Party]], as well as any user of [[peer to peer]] services 'freetards'.&lt;ref name=&quot;freetard&quot;&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/11/06/highfield_tactics/ BBC tech chief: You Freetards don't matter]&quot;, ''The Register'', November 6, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Orlowski, &quot;[http://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/03/25/org_demo_photo_album/ Freetards storm Westminster]&quot;, ''The Register'', March 25, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; This coinage has subsequently been taken up by other writers at The Register.
