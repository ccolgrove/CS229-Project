In the late 1980s, the Canadian recording industry continued to produce popular acts such as  [[Blue Rodeo]]. [[Alternative rock]] also emerged as an influential genre, with independent artists such as [[The Tragically Hip]], [[54-40]], [[Sarah McLachlan]], [[Spirit of the West]], [[The Waltons (Canadian band)|The Waltons]], [[Cowboy Junkies]], [[The Pursuit of Happiness (band)|The Pursuit of Happiness]], and [[The Grapes of Wrath (band)|The Grapes of Wrath]] all gaining their first widespread attention during this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;RPM&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Arts&quot; /&gt; Also a new wave of Canadian [[thrash metal]] bands began to rise up and earned a dedicated following like  [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]], [[Razor (band)|Razor]], [[Voivod (band)|Voivod]], [[Sword (band)|Sword]], [[Exciter (band)|Exciter]] and [[Annihilator (band)|Annihilator]], Canadian metal's biggest selling artist, with sales of close to 2 million units worldwide, with [[industrial music|industrial]] bands [[Skinny Puppy]] and [[Front Line Assembly]] in the mix, as well as black/death metal band [[Blasphemy (band)|Blasphemy]].

Canada's most successful rock artists by the late 1980s have worked in a relatively generic, mainstream pop rock style of the day. Some from the 70s, 80s and 90s, may be ascribed to more specific substyles like [[Colin James]],  [[David Wilcox (Canadian musician)|David Wilcox]] and [[Jeff Healey]] to blues-rock (see [[Canadian blues]]). With  [[Stompin' Tom Connors]],  [[Great Big Sea]] and  [[Ashley MacIsaac]] to folk rock, that saw the start for both styles, a very large following all across Canada.&lt;ref name=&quot;Arts&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stonyplainrecords.com/Web/about_us.asp Stony Plain Records: Canada's Roots, Rock, Country, Folk &amp; Blues Label].

At the start of the 1990s Canadian rock took a distinctive turn.

It can be difficult for an indie group to break through in Canada as there is no nationwide rock station. On the other hand, although rock bands may get some exposure from outlets such as MuchMusic and [[CBC Radio 3]], bands must largely rely on building an audience city by city, as each commercial radio station makes its playlist decisions independently. Similarly, it is more difficult to ''travel'' nationwide as well due to the vast size, creating regional communities that revolve around major music scenes in cities like Winnipeg, Vancouver, Toronto, Montreal or Halifax, each with a handful of offshoot suburban town scenes that produce the next wave of fresh bands. Most notable is [[Arcade Fire]], who have won numerous awards, including the 2011 [[Grammy Award for Album of the Year|Grammy for Album of the Year]], the 2011 [[Juno Award for Album of the Year]], and the 2011 [[Brit Award]] for Best International Album for their third studio album, ''[[The Suburbs (Arcade Fire album)|The Suburbs]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/13/AR2011021303447.html?hpid=top |title=Esperanza Spalding, Arcade Fire top a night of upsets at 2011 Grammys |first=Chris |last=Richards |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2011-02-14 |accessdate=2011-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Music of Quebec}}

In the 1960s, the [[French Canadians]] of Quebec were beginning to self-identify as ''QuÃ©bÃ©cois'' (Quebecers). See the [[Quiet Revolution]]. The tensions between Quebec and English Canada have, at times, played out on Quebec's music scene as well.&lt;ref&gt;ENCYCLOPEDIE DE LA MUSIQUE AU CANADA. 2. ed.

After the controversy caused by this incident, Dion had been careful not to clearly declare herself as either [[federalist]] or [[Quebec sovereignty|sovereignist]], but has in recent years made it clear that she is a federalist French-Canadian, after she was inducted to Canada's Walk of Fame and awarded the Order of Canada.
