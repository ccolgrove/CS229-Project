'''RTÃ One''' (Irish: ''RTÃ a hAon'') is the flagship television channel of [[RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann]] (RTÃ), and it is the most popular and most watched television channel in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].  It was launched as ''TelefÃ­s Ãireann'' on 31 December 1961, it was renamed ''RTÃ Television'' in 1966, and it was renamed as RTÃ One upon the launch of RTÃ Two in 1978.  RTÃ is funded partly by the licence fee, the remainder of the funding is provided by commercial advertising, because RTÃ is funded partly by the licence fee it shows considerably fewer advertisements than most other channels available in [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]].

Its  headquarters is at [[Donnybrook, Dublin]].

RTÃ One is almost universally available on the [[Very high frequency|VHF]] and [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] bands in the Republic of Ireland (though VHF has mostly been phased out), and it is also available on the most digital television services available in the Republic of Ireland such as [[Sky (UK &amp; Ireland)|Sky Ireland]], [[UPC Ireland]], [[Magnet Networks]], and [[Saorview]]. It is available in most of Northern Ireland via analogue overspill, Sky and [[Virgin Media]].

==History==
The station began life as ''TelefÃ­s Ãireann'' in 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1960s.html|title=TELEFÃS ÃIREANN, IRELAND'S NATIONAL TELEVISION STATION, GOES ON AIR: 31 DECEMBER 1961|publisher=RTÃ Archives|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The very first show of all to be pre-recorded for the new television service was The School Around the Corner a show created and presented by [[Paddy Crosbie]], produced by [[James Plunkett]] .&lt;ref&gt;Your Dinner's Poured Out! by Paddy Crosbie. 1st Published 1981 O'Brien Press Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt; It was renamed ''RTÃ Television'' in 1966, upon the renaming of the Radio Ãireann Authority to RTÃ, and became ''RTE1'' upon the launch of [[RTÃ Two|RTÃ2]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html|title=RTÃ LAUNCHES SECOND TELEVISION CHANNEL: 2 NOVEMBER 1978|publisher=RTÃ Archives|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally the station broadcast in black and white using the [[405-line television system]] in the North and East of the country but also across the country using the preferred European standard 625-line,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irish-tv.com/405.asp|title=405 Lines in Ireland (1961 - 1983)|publisher=Tech-tir|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but began 625-line [[PAL]] colour transmissions in 1968. The first Outside Broadcast made in colour for RTE Television was when Ireland hosted the Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTÃ Archives&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1970s.html|title=THE ADVENT OF COLOUR TELEVISION: 1971|publisher=RTÃ Archives|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK national broadcaster BBC provided RTÃ with an OB Unit which could broadcast in colour for the event. In 1972, the first studios in RTE's Donnybrook headquarters were equipped for colour, and this was followed by the news studios in 1974, drama studios in 1975 and finally Studio 1 (the largest Studio, hosting shows such as The Late Late Show) in 1976.&lt;ref name=&quot;RTÃ Archives&quot;/&gt;

RTÃ One was also the sole Irish TV channel until 1978, when [[RTÃ Two|RTÃ2]] (known as Network 2 between 1988 and 2004) was created. The Irish Language station [[TG4]] began in 1996 as TnaG.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/laweb/brc/brc_1990s.html|title=TEILIFÃS NA GAEILGE GOES ON AIR : 31 OCTOBER 1996|publisher=RTÃ Archives|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1998 RTÃ One also competes with [[TV3 Ireland|TV3]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv3.ie/corporate.php|title=About TV3|publisher=The TV3 Group|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÃ One since it began broadcasting has competed with [[BBC One]] and [[UTV]] and in 1980s RTÃ began competing with  other [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television|cable]] channels that are widely available across Ireland through [[cable television|cable]] subscription services due to the high take up of cable TV for UK channels since the 1960s, and the continued roll out of [[MMDS]] and [[satellite television|satellite]] during the 1980s and 1990s.

Unlike many other national broadcasters, RTÃ One was late to begin broadcasting in the mornings, and 24 hour transmission only began in the early 1990s. From 1961, RTÃ Television would only broadcast from 17:35 until around 23:30 during the Winter months. In 1975 this changed slightly with transmission starting at around 15:30 and concluding around midnight (00:00). In 1988 RTÃ One launched a schedule with a new news bulletin at 13:00. To this day RTÃ One still does not offer a &quot;breakfast television&quot; programme, content to let commercially run TV3 to broadcast ''[[Ireland AM]]'' since 1999. RTÃ One instead shows repeats of different home produced shows such as ''[[The Afternoon Show]]'', and imports such as ''[[Are You Being Served?]]'', ''[[Neighbours]]'', ''[[Dallas]]'' etc. [[Euronews]] provides RTÃ One viewers with early morning news coverage, with RTÃ One's first news bulletin of the day airing at around 10:00am. However during the Olympics and special breaking news or election coverage, RTÃ One would provide a special bulletin in the morning.

===RTÃ One +1===

A [[timeshift channel]] for RTÃ One (RTÃ One +1) was launched on 27 May 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thursday, May 26, 2011 - 07:47 AM |url=http://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/ireland/free-to-air-digital-television-service-to-be-launched-today-506470.html |title=Free-to-air digital television service to be launched today |publisher=Irish Examiner |date=2011-05-26 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and shares channel space with [[RTÃjr]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Saorview |url=http://www.saorview.ie/channels-services/television-channels-and-services/ |title=Television Channels and Services &amp;#124; SAORVIEW |publisher=Saorview.ie |date=2011-03-03 |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The channel is available on [[Saorview]].

It was referred to as RTÃ One Deferred in the Easy TV commercial [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] multiplex application, Easy TV was made up of RTÃ NL and [[UPC Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bci.ie/DTT/easy_tv/easy_app.pdf |title=Guide to Submissions for DTT Multiplex Contracts |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÃ had also plans to create a third channel called RTÃ Three along with RTÃ One Deferred as reported in the Sunday Business Post in May 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/businesspost/2008/05/18/story32957.asp|title=RTE aims to launch new channel|publisher=[[The Irish Post]]|date=2008-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÃ Three was dropped for the alternative RTÃ Plus/[[RTÃjr]]. RTÃ Plus would have initially been a time shift channel for RTÃ One's prime time schedule, starting each night at 7pm after RTÃjr ends for the night. This &quot;Phase 1&quot; of RTÃ plus will begin broadcasting in May 2011. &quot;Phase 2&quot; of RTÃ Plus was to be made up of an entirely different schedule to that of RTÃ One, RTÃ had hoped that this would be made available in May 2012.&lt;ref name=&quot;DCENRPubConn2010&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dcenr.gov.ie/NR/rdonlyres/C13536EC-C703-4110-9A07-2A5DB4107DE3/0/PVTConsultationDocument.pdf|title=PVT Consultation Document|publisher=Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources (Ireland)|pages=10â11|accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minister Pat Carey gave the go ahead for RTÃ One +1 for a maximum of 4 years at which point it will be reviewed. He did not give permission for the second phase in the channel as he was advised by the BAI that it may cause problems for commercial service providers such as TV3.

==Budget==

In more recent years they have produced literacy programmes for adults such as ''[[NALA|Read, Write, Now]]'' presented by [[Derek Mooney]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.readwritenow.ie/home.cfm |title=Read Write Now - Welcome to Read Write Now |publisher=Readwritenow.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The shows average audience for 2009 was 400,000 viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gala.ie/template1.php?page=advertising|title=Gala goes Nationwide|publisher=Gala Press Office|accessdate=24 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show began airing in the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alan Farquharson |url=http://indigo.ie/~alanf/cv.html |title=Alan Farquharson - Curriculum Vitae |publisher=Indigo.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999 RTÃ tested opt out for Dublin, Cork and Galway on UHF signals, however Chorus (a Dublin cable operator at the time) aired the Galway edition, while NTL (the other Dublin cable operator aired the Dublin version).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iolfree.ie/~icdg/local_rte.htm |title=RTE Local TV |publisher=Iolfree.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; RTÃ do not provide local opt-out or regional news.

===Drama===
====1960s====

In 1961 as TeilifÃ­s Ãireann got ready to begin broadcasting it appointed [[Hilton Edwards]] as head of Drama, he was heavily involved in Irish theatre at the time. At this early stage they produced many international and local plays for television audiences such as ''[[Antigone]], [[The Wild Duck]], [[The Fire Raisers (play)|The Fire Raisers]], [[The Government Inspector]], [[The Physicists]], [[Martine (play)|Martine]], [[The Well of the Saints]], [[Candida (play)|Candida]], [[The Man of Destiny]], [[In the Shadow of the Glen]], [[Church Street (play)|Church Street]], [[The Field]], [[The Plough and the Stars]], [[The Shadow of a Gunman]]'' and ''[[The Hostage (play)|The Hostage]]''. Both of Edwards' successors Jim Fitzgerald and Chloe Gibson would continue with stage play adaptations but would also look for original dramas for television. [[Hugh Leonard]] adapted [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Dubliners]]'' under the title Dublin and in 1966 he wrote ''[[Insurrection]]'' an 8 part real-time series which depicted the events of the [[1916 Easter Rising]] which was broadcast on Easter Week on the 50th anniversary of the rising, it was RTÃ biggest drama production of the 1960s, involving on location filming and the Army. In its first ten years on the air RTÃ produced 103 plays of which 66% were Irish and 50% began life as stage plays. Half of the drama produced came from serials such as the [[Dublin]] based urban soap ''[[Tolka Row]]'' which began broadcasting in 1964 and finished in 1968. In terms of population RTÃ was one of Europe's biggest producers of television drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webpages.dcu.ie/~sheehanh/60s-itvd.htm|title=Chapter 4: The 1960s: The Coming Of Television|last=Sheehan, Dr. H,|year=2001|accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Daytime===

In the early 1980s, RTÃ began testing daytime television for audiences on RTÃ One. This was a major commitment since [[RTÃ Two]] was failing to gain audience that it required. Their first daytime show was hosted by [[Thelma Mansfield]] - one of their regular continuity announcers - ''Good Afternoon'' was a mix of live interviews, music, children's television and soap operas.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelmamansfield.ie/images/press/VIP2_nov09.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, RTÃ debuted its new afternoon show which featured a mixture of daytime chat and children's television. In September the channel aired '''Live at 3''' broadcasting from 15:00 each weekday. This was followed by a new children's series [[The Den (television)|Dempsey's Den]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/listing-3735.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Live at 3 was presented by [[Derek Davis]] and Thelma Mansfield from 1986 to 1997. It included a broad range of topics (healthcare, cookery, DIY, fashion and culture). It was a major departure for the daytime schedule and in an interview with TV Now Derek Davis described how many other European broadcasters were travelling over to Ireland to visit this mix genre daytime TV chat show.

In 1997 with the departure of Derek Davis, Live at 3 was merged with another TV series called ''12 to 1''. ''12 to 1'' was similar in style to ''Live at 3'' only it concentrated on Light chat with hosts [[Marty Whelan]] and Ciana Campbell. Ciana Campbell had prior to this tested out a live afternoon phone in show (called ''Over to You''), similar in format to RTÃ Radio's successfully [[Liveline]], this eventually led to ''12 to 1''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tvlistings.thetvroomplus.com/listing-659.html ]{{dead link|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1990s Marty Whelan, Ciana Campbell and Thelma Mansfield all remained as part of the daytime TV line-up and featured on ''PM Live''. In 1999, Thelma Mansfield retired from RTÃ to concentrate on her art career.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thelmamansfield.ie/images/press/VIP_nov09.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; This later led to  the demise of ''PM Live'', which was replaced in September, 1999, with ''[[Open House (Ireland)|Open House]]''.

''Open House'' was the first time that RTÃ had an independent producer produce their daytime TV service. Tyrone Productions produced the show in the RTÃ studios and it was hosted by Mary Kennedy and Marty Whelan from 1999 to 2003.

In 2003, RTÃ revamped their daytime schedule and axed ''Open House'' and replaced it with two new shows, ''[[The Afternoon Show]]'' and [[The Big Bite]]. The Big Bite was an unusual departure for RTÃ's daytime schedule as it had heavier content than previous shows which aired in this time-slot, it was hosted by economist [[David McWilliams]]. The Big Bite was replaced with ''[[Seoige and O'Shea]]'', which was also produced by Tyrone Productions. Joe O'Shea and Grainne Seoige presented the show together for 2 seasons until Joe O'Shea left in 2007, he was replaced by Grainne's sister SÃ­le Seoige and the show was rename Seoige. ''[[Seoige]]'' lasted one season and was replaced by an extended version of ''The Afternoon Show'' produced by Green Inc Productions for RTÃ.

The Afternoon Show was first presented by [[Anna Nolan]], [[Blathnaid Ni Chofaigh]] and [[Sheana Keane]]. [[Anna Nolan]] left the show after a year to focus on more serious TV such as RTÃ's ''[[Would You Believe (TV series)|Would You Believe]]'' series of documentaries. Blathanid and Sheana both worked on the show together for a number of years until 2008 (when it was reported they had had a falling out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/tension-high-as-sheana-and-blaithnaid-meet-1752243.html|title=Tension high as Sheana and Blaithnaid meet|last=Nolan|first=Laura|date=27 May 2009|publisher=The Evening Herald|accessdate=5 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;), various presenters stepping into either Blathanid's or Sheana's shoes, with the final series being presented by Sheana and [[Maura Derrane]] (former ''[[Ireland AM]]'' presenter).

In 2010, RTÃ One revamped its afternoon schedule, which will debut in September 2010. RTÃ set about seeking tenders from independent producers, as a consequence of this process RTÃ axed ''The Afternoon Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iftn.ie/?act1=record&amp;aid=73&amp;rid=4282878&amp;sr=1&amp;only=1&amp;hl=afternoon+show&amp;tpl=archnews |title=RTÃ Reviews âAfternoon Showâ Slot &amp;#124; The Irish Film &amp; Television Network |publisher=Iftn.ie |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two new afternoon shows will begin in September 2010 they are ''[[4 Live]]'' and ''[[The Daily Show (Irish TV series)|The Daily Show]]''. ''4 Live'' will be presented by Maura Derrane (former co-presenter of ''The Afternoon Show''), while ''The Daily Show'' will be presented by TG4 Weather Man [[DÃ¡ithÃ­ Ã SÃ©]] and former ''Ireland AM'' presenter [[Claire Byrne]].

==On-air identity==

Throughout the years, RTÃ One has gone through many changes to its on-air identity, mostly in tune with the changing of the statutory logo of the cooperation that operates it, as in the early years. The average life of an RTÃ One [[television ident|ident]] is around three years, with modifications and changes along the way.

===1961 to 1978===
[[Image:RTE Logo 1961.jpg|thumb|right|Original TeilifÃ­s Ãireann logo]]

[[Image:RTE Logo 1969.jpg|thumb|right|Original RaidiÃ³ TeilifÃ­s Ãireann logo]]

Early idents prominently featured the original name of ''TelefÃ­s Ãireann'', and the [[Brigid's cross|St. Brigid's Cross]] which would become the symbol of the channel for years to come. In 1966, the radio and television stations adopted the common brand ''Radio TelifÃ­s Ãireann'' in line with the renamed broadcasting authority,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acts.ie/zza7y1966.1.html#zza7y1966s4 No. 7/1966: BROADCASTING AUTHORITY (AMENDMENT) ACT, 1966&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and the ident used the [[initialism]] RTE, with no [[sÃ­neadh fada]] [[diacritic]] over the E of ''Ãireann''.  The 1995 logo was the first to read ''RTÃ'' rather than ''RTE''.

===1978 to 1988===
As colour television was introduced. The station became ''RTE 1'' in 1978, when [[RTE 2]] was launched. A new ident in 1980 featured the characters &quot;RTE1&quot; wrapped within a stylized St. Brigid's Cross. This design, along with a variant with slight colour changes, were used until 1987, when another ident was formed. The ident featured the St. Brigid's Cross, which was blended into the &quot;T&quot; in &quot;RTE&quot;. The &quot;T&quot; also resembled the digit 1 of the channel's number.

The first time the channel left out the St. Brigid's Cross from its idents was in 1989, when an ident that featured the letters &quot;RTE&quot; revolving around the number 1, against an emerald green background, was released. This was to last until 1993, with minor revisions.

===1993 to 1998===
1993 saw the return of the St. Brigid's cross to the RTÃ One Idents. It was seen floating across a stone background that resembled cave walls. This ident lasted until 1995, when a new ident that featured the new corporate logo was released. The logo also saw the return of the fada on RTÃ's &quot;E&quot; in a stylistic manner. The ident started with a misty background, with the new RTÃ logo peering through, eventually fading into the station's name. At the beginning, the St. Brigid's Cross was left out, but it was restored to the screens after viewers complained.

===1998 to 2000===
1998 saw the end of single ident templates for RTÃ One. In a rebranding, three idents were released, and all revolved around nature. The St. Brigid's Cross continued to grace the screen, but now has to share its airtime with other idents. During this time, a special ident for overnight programmes and the celebration of the milliennium were created. The original three idents were gradually phased out in late 2000, but was featured in other new idents thereafter.

===2000 to 2003===
In September 2000, a new set of idents were gradually introduced to RTÃ One, with all the old idents from 1998 phased out by December of that year. The new idents featured Irish places and people, and all were set to a common set of background music. One of the original three idents were featured in seven of the new idents, subtly playing in the background.

A promotions video, featuring snippets of the idents, was shown as a part of the campaign.

===2003 to 2006===
On 1 September 2003, RTÃ One launched a new set of idents, with a new style for its &quot;RTÃ One&quot; branding. The ident showed Ireland's old face first, and then flashed into images of Ireland today. New ident sets were introduced in 2004, and deviated from the &quot;Ireland Old And New&quot; theme. Subsequent edits on the original idents also took away the &quot;old&quot; element from the idents.

As was before, a promotions video was aired before the launch of the new idents.

===2006 to present===
At 6:00 am on 3 November 2006, RTÃ One unveiled its basic set of new idents, designed by [[Red Bee Media]].
