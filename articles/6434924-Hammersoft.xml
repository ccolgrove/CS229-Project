'''DWGT-TV''', channel 4, is the [[Flagship (television)|flagship]] station of [[Philippines|Philippine]] [[television network]] [[People's Television Network]]. Its studios and transmitter are located at Broadcast Complex, Visayas Avenue, Diliman, [[Quezon City]].

==History==
The frequency rights of Channel 4 were previously owned by one of the [[ABS-CBN Corporation|ABS-CBN]] stations in Metro Manila (DZXL-TV 9) when the station moved from channel 9 to channel 4 in 1969.

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[Image:Gtvnetwork.JPG|150px|left|thumb|GTV Network logo from 1974-79.]] --&gt;
During the Martial Law era, the government seized the frequency of channel 4 of ABS-CBN, reopened it in October 1973 as Government Television (GTV) channel 4. By 1980, GTV became MBS (Maharlika Broadcasting System), a full-blown media machinery for former president [[Ferdinand E. Marcos]], and one of four TV stations in operation back then, and it also began its broadcasting in full color.  Surprising, though, as Marcos banned [[Voltes V]], MBS carried [[Daimos]].

On February 24, 1986, during a live news conference in [[MalacaÃ±ang]], rebel forces tried to capture channel 4 and eventually succeeded. At the heat of exchanges between Marcos and then Chief of Staff General [[Fabian Ver]], Channel 4 suddenly went off the air when its facilities were taken over by rebel forces and by that afternoon started broadcasting for the people. Once the government then attempted not to broadcast the situation made by the rebels, only to fail.

During the Aquino administration, it became known as People's Television 4. The years following its broadcast, PTV's facilities, then housed on a major part of ABS-CBN's present studio complex in Bohol Ave. (now Sgt. Esguerra Ave) Quezon City, became a subject of a legal battle between the Lopezes and the Government.

To end the scuffle, the Aquino government, through the Bureau of Broadcast Services, which then newly revived the pre-Martial Law era Philippine Broadcasting Service, decided to expand the former National Media Production Center building in Visayas Ave. to eventually accommodate Channel 4. By 1993, the station moved its studios to the said complex with transmitters and other equipment largely donated from a grant of the French government.

In 2001, People's Television was renamed on-screen as National Broadcasting Network. By that time it introduced the country's first two hour newscast [[Teledyaryo]], and adopted mostly programs that showcase the good side of the Arroyo administration and its programs.

As [[President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]] entered office in June 2010, once again, NBN-4 became part of PTNI to enhance its news and programing to viewers nationwide and worldwide until recently, NBN introduced its digital broadcast on [[ISDB|ISDB-T]] channel 48 as the transmitter was rehabilitated and upgraded its frequency using advanced transmitter equipment from [[Harris Corporation]] of the United States.

In his second [[State of the Nation Address (Philippines)|State of the nation Address]] last July 25, Aquino called the government to make plans in restrengthening PTV as a Government broadcaster.
