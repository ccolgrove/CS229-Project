'''WNYA''' is the [[MyNetworkTV]]-affiliated [[television station]] for the [[Capital District]] of [[New York State]] and Western [[New England]].  Licensed to [[Pittsfield, Massachusetts]], WNYA broadcasts a [[High-definition television|high definition]] digital signal on [[VHF]] channel 13 (remapped to [[virtual channel]] 51.1) from a transmitter northwest of [[New Salem, New York]], along with a repeater licensed to [[Albany, New York]], '''WNYA-[[Class A television service|CA]]''' channel 15 (its transmitter is co-located with the main signal).  Owned by Venture Technologies Group, WNYA is branded as &quot;My 4 Albany&quot; (the station's channel on area cable systems), and airs the full MyNetworkTV schedule along with [[Television syndication|syndicated]] programming including ''[[Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader? (U.S. syndicated game show)|Are You Smarter Than a 5th Grader?]]'', ''[[Family Feud]]'', and ''[[The Wendy Williams Show]]''; off-network reruns including ''[[According to Jim]]'', ''[[George Lopez (TV series)|George Lopez]]'', and ''[[South Park]]''; and [[New York Yankees]] games that are split between [[WWOR-TV]] and [[YES Network]].

==History==
===WNYA===
What today is WNYA can indirectly trace its history to '''WUVW''' an un-built station on channel 51. It was licensed to Pittsfield and was given a permit in the mid-1950s (this was canceled in the 1970s). The allocation that became WNYA was proposed in October 1996 by [[Pappas Telecasting]] but went without an owner for several years until it was auctioned off in February 2002. Venture Technologies ended up getting the winning bid for $1.3 million. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) granted the construction permit and the '''WNYA''' calls to Venture a year later.

===WNYA-CD===
What today is WNYA-CD signed on in 1996 known as '''WVBX-LP'''. The station was a low-powered repeater of [[WVBG-LP]] that was licensed to [[Easton, New York|Easton]] in [[Washington County, New York]] on channel 39. In September 1997, WVBG became a [[UPN]] affiliate although the station could never get carriage on [[Time Warner Cable]]. Instead, the cable system offered [[WSBK-TV]] from [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]. The UPN affiliation ended at the start of 2000 when cable-only &quot;[[WEDG-TV]]&quot; (known later as &quot;UPN 4&quot;) signed on as a joint operation between Time Warner Cable and [[Fox Network|Fox]] affiliate [[WXXA-TV]]. WVBX would then become an [[independent station]] before signing-off in early-2002. While dark, WVBX was upgraded to Class A status and had its license moved to Albany. A new transmitter was built northwest of New Salem. The station was given the call letters '''WNYA-CA''' and was announced as becoming a WNYA repeater. It is unusual for a repeater station to sign on earlier that its parent station.

===UPN Capital Region===
In April 2003, WNYA's owner signed a [[Local marketing agreement|joint sales agreement]] (JSA) with [[Freedom Communications]], owner of [[CBS]] affiliate [[WRGB]]. WNYA and WNYA-CA then announced a sign-on date of September 1. WNYA signed on-air in mid-July for testing purposes and WNYA-CA did the same in late-August. The official launch of the two stations came at 6 in the morning on September 1 with the stations using the branding &quot;UPN Capital Region&quot;. The main signal, WNYA, had an analog transmitter northwest of Pittsfield on Berry Mountain. It became the first full-powered, over-the-air UPN affiliate in the Capital District. 

Although the two stations did not sign-on broadcasting digital signals of their own, WRGB added a new second digital subchannel to serve as that purpose. From its sign-on, WNYA took the cable channel position of &quot;WEDG-TV&quot; on Time Warner, [[Charter Communications|Charter]], and independent Mid-Hudson Cablevision (in [[Greene County, New York]]). [[Adelphia Communications Corporation|Adelphia]] would replace WSBK with WNYA at the start of 2004 with [[DirecTV]] and [[Dish Network]] adding the station later that year. WNYA's original line-up included several new shows that had gone unclaimed in the [[media market|market]], some not previously cleared, and various older ones.

===MyNetworkTV===
On January 24, 2006, [[The WB]] and UPN announced that they would end broadcasting and merge. The newly combined network would be called [[The CW]]. The letters would represent the first initial of its corporate parents, CBS (the parent company of UPN) and the [[Warner Bros.]] unit of [[Time Warner]]. On February 22, [[News Corporation]] announced that it would start up another new broadcast television network called MyNetworkTV. This new network, which would be sister to Fox, would be operated by [[Fox Television Stations]] and its syndication division [[Twentieth Television]]. MyNetworkTV was created to give UPN and WB stations, not mentioned as becoming CW affiliates, another option besides becoming independent. It was also created to compete against The CW. 

It was announced that WEWB (now [[WCWN]]) would become the market's CW affiliate after owner Tribune signed a ten year affiliation deal with the new network on most of its WB stations. On March 9, it was said that WNYA would become an affiliate of MyNetworkTV. It then began airing ads for the new network on-air and put banner ads on its website in June. On July 30, the station's web address became a promotional website for the new network. There was no information about the station and its programming. Then on August 2, a new website was shown with a new MyNetworkTV logo. With UPN affiliation, the station's logo did not include a channel number in it. The new logo was based on WEDG-TV's channel position on Time Warner Cable systems. Ironically, nowhere in [[Berkshire County, Massachusetts]] is WNYA currently on channel 4. In [[North Adams, Massachusetts|North Adams]], that channel is the spot where Boston's CBS affiliate [[WBZ-TV]] is located. 

Despite its MyNetworkTV affiliation (which took effect on-air on September 5), WNYA aired the last two weeks of UPN programming. However, this aired from 1 to 3 in the morning from Tuesday to Saturday. WEWB began broadcasting The CW on September 18. On April 18, 2008, WNYA launched its high definition channel on Time Warner Cable in Albany despite being unable to broadcast HD over-the-air. This coincided with the first Yankee baseball broadcast it had the rights to. WNYA switched to digital broadcasting as part of the transition on June 12, 2009. The Albany repeater, WNYA-CA, had a construction permit to perform a &quot;[[flash-cut]]&quot; to a low-power digital signal. The calls became '''WNYA-DC''' and remained on the same broadcast channel. Due to its Class A status, it was not mandated by law to make the transition.

===Antenna TV===
Around April 20, 2011, WNYA launched their first [[digital subchannel]] in the form of [[Tribune Broadcasting]]'s [[Antenna TV]] over Channel 51.2.

==WRGB involvement==
The JSA between WNYA and WRGB led to some common involvement between the two stations. It was first apparent a mere six hours after WNYA signed on when the station aired CBS's coverage of the [[U.S. Open (tennis)|U.S. Open]] [[tennis]] tournament on [[Labor Day (United States)|Labor Day]] because WRGB aired the ''[[Jerry Lewis]] [[Muscular Dystrophy Association|MDA]] Telethon'' during that time. This arrangement continued in 2004, but due to a crop of syndication launches on Labor Day in 2005, it did not happen that year. U.S. Open Tennis did air on cable on Time Warner Cable channel 3 in the Capital District. There was also some swapping of syndicated programs between the two stations. Another byproduct of the JSA, WNYA aired replays of WRGB's weekday noon (at 1 p.m.) and weeknight 11 o'clock (at 11:35) newscasts. WRGB's public affairs program, known as ''Sunday Morning with Liz Bishop'', was also included. The practice ended in mid-2004. In late 2005, Freedom Communications signed an extension that was to have kept the JSA agreement in place until the end of 2008 (it had been set to expire on August 31, 2006). 

On April 17, 2006, it was announced that WNYA would begin airing an hour-long extension of WRGB's weekday morning show at 7 in the morning. The newscast was known as ''CBS 6 First News on My TV 4 Albany''. This could be seen as a pre-emptive move by WRGB to fend off a challenge by WXXA which had announced its plans to launch weekday morning news two weeks earlier. Rumors of WRGB producing a prime time newscast at 10 on WNYA circulated as well. However, the pickup of a second run of ''[[Dr. Phil (TV series)|Dr. Phil]]'' to air at that hour killed the rumors. 

On June 19, Freedom announced the purchase of WEWB from [[Tribune Broadcasting]] for $17 million dollars. This purchase was finalized on December 6 giving the Capital District its first duopoly. As a result, WRGB began to control three stations in the area. At the start of 2007, the news on WNYA moved to WCWN because that station had higher ratings overall and the broadcast became ''CBS 6 First News on The Capital Region's CW''. In February, the JSA with WRGB was terminated. As a result, WRGB-DT2's arrangement to broadcast as WNYA's digital signal ended as well. For a time after, WNYA's website listed WRGB's street address for advertising information.
