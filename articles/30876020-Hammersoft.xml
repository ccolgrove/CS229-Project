'''Amon Leopold GÃ¶th''' (11 December 1908&amp;nbsp;â 13 September 1946; {{IPA-de|ËÉ¡Ã¸Ët|pron}}) was an Austrian [[Nazi]] and the commandant of the Nazi [[concentration camp]] at [[KrakÃ³w-PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp|PÅaszÃ³w]], [[General Government]] (a German-occupied area of Poland). A ''HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer'' (Captain) of the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]], he was tried as a [[war criminal]] after the war.

After the war, the [[Supreme National Tribunal of Poland]] at KrakÃ³w found GÃ¶th guilty of murdering tens of thousands of people. He was executed by hanging on 13 September 1946, age 37, not far from the former site of the PÅaszÃ³w camp.

==Early life and career==
GÃ¶th was born in [[Vienna]], then the capital of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], to a family in the book publishing industry. GÃ¶th joined a Nazi youth group at the age of 17, moved to a nationalist paramilitary group at the age of 19, and at the age of 22, became a member of the Austrian branch of the [[Nazi Party]]. In September 1930, he was assigned the Party Number 510764. GÃ¶th simultaneously joined the [[Austrian SS]] and was appointed an [[SS-Mann]] with the SS Number 43673.

GÃ¶th's early activities are little known, largely because the Austrian SS was an illegal and underground organization until the [[Anschluss]] of Austria by [[Nazi Germany]] in 1938. Between 1932 and 1936, GÃ¶th was a member of an [[Allgemeine-SS]] company in Vienna and, by 1937, had risen to the rank of ''[[OberscharfÃ¼hrer|SS-OberscharfÃ¼hrer]]'' (Staff Sergeant). Between 1938 and 1941, he was a member of [[11th SS-Standarte]] operating from Vienna and was commissioned an ''[[UntersturmfÃ¼hrer|SS-UntersturmfÃ¼hrer]]'' (Second Lieutenant) on 14 July 1941.

==PÅaszÃ³w==
On 11 August 1942, GÃ¶th departed from his current position to join the staff of ''SS-[[BrigadefÃ¼hrer]]'' [[Odilo GloboÄnik]], the [[SS and Police Leader]] of the [[KrakÃ³w]] area.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowe&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed as a regular SS officer of the [[SS-TotenkopfverbÃ¤nde|Concentration Camp service]], and on 11 February 1943 was assigned to construct and command a [[KrakÃ³w-PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp|forced labour camp at PÅaszÃ³w]]. The camp took one month to construct using slave labour and, on 13 March 1943, the Jewish [[KrakÃ³w Ghetto|ghetto of KrakÃ³w]] was closed down (liquidated) with the surviving inhabitants imprisoned in the new slave labor camp. Approximately 2,000&amp;nbsp;people died during the evacuation. At his later war crimes trial, it was revealed that GÃ¶th had personally killed a little over 500 slave laborers during the PÅaszÃ³w camp's time in operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 September 1943, GÃ¶th was given the further task of shutting down the ghetto at [[TarnÃ³w]], where an unknown number of people were killed on the spot. On 3 February 1944, GÃ¶th closed down the concentration camp at [[Szebnie]] by ordering the inmates to be murdered on the spot or deported to other camps, again resulting in several thousand deaths.

[[Image:Amon GÃ¶th's house.jpg|right|thumb|The balcony of Amon GÃ¶th's house in [[PÅaszÃ³w]] â 2008]]

By April 1944, GÃ¶th had been promoted to the rank of ''[[HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer|SS-HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer]]'' (Captain), having received a double promotion and thus skipping the rank of ''[[HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer|SS-ObersturmfÃ¼hrer]]'' (First Lieutenant). He was also appointed a reserve officer of the [[Waffen-SS]]. His assignment as Commandant of the PÅaszÃ³w Labour Camp continued, now under the direct authority of the SS Economics and Administration Office.

GÃ¶th believed that the Jews themselves should pay for their own executions, so on 11 May 1942, in the small town of [[Szczebrzeszyn]], the Gestapo ordered the Jewish council to pay 2,000 [[zÅoty]] and 3 kilograms of coffee to cover the expenses for the ammunition used to kill the Jews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jewishgen.org/Yizkor/belzec1/bel070.html |title=The SS: A Government in Waiting
|year=2011 |publisher=JewishGen |work=Yizkor Book Project |accessdate=26 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During his tenure as commander of PÅaszÃ³w, GÃ¶th tortured and murdered prisoners on a daily basis. GÃ¶th is believed to have personally killed more than 500 imprisoned Jews and sent thousands more to be executed on [[Hujowa GÃ³rka]], a large hill that was used for mass killings along PÅaszÃ³w's grounds. [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], one of the [[Schindler Jews]], said, &quot;When you saw GÃ¶th, you saw death.&quot; According to PÅaszÃ³w survivor Helen Jonas, &lt;blockquote&gt;As a survivor I can tell you that we are all traumatized people. Never would I, never, believe that any human being would be capable of such horror, of such atrocities. When we saw him from a distance, everybody was hiding, in latrines, wherever they could hide. I can't tell you how people feared him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20090226]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

GÃ¶th spared the life of a Jewish prisoner Natalia Hubler, later famous as [[Natalia Karp]], after hearing her play a [[nocturne]] by [[Chopin]] on the piano the day after she arrived at the PÅaszÃ³w camp.

==Dismissal and capture==
On 13 September 1944, GÃ¶th was relieved of his position as Commandant of PÅaszÃ³w and was assigned to the [[SS-Wirtschafts-Verwaltungshauptamt|SS Office of Economics and Administration]]. Shortly thereafter, in Vienna around November 1944, GÃ¶th was charged with theft of Jewish property (which, according to Nazi legislation, belonged to the ''[[Third Reich|State]]''), and was arrested by the [[Gestapo]]. He was scheduled for an appearance before [[SS and Police Court|SS judge]] [[Georg Konrad Morgen]], but due to the progress of World War II, and Germany's looming defeat, a [[court martial]] was never assembled and the charges against him were summarily dismissed.

[[File:Amon GÃ¶th-prisoner 1945.jpg|right|thumb|Mug shot of GÃ¶th in 1945. ]]

He was next assigned to [[Bad TÃ¶lz]], Germany, where he was quickly diagnosed by SS doctors as suffering from mental illness and diabetes. He was committed to a [[mental institution]]. He remained there until he was arrested by the [[United States military]] in May 1945. At the time of his arrest, GÃ¶th claimed to have been recently promoted to ''[[SturmbannfÃ¼hrer|SS-SturmbannfÃ¼hrer]]'' and, during later interrogations, several documents listed him as &quot;SS-Major GÃ¶th&quot;. [[Rudolf HÃ¶ss]] was also of the opinion that GÃ¶th had been promoted and, when called to give testimony at GÃ¶th's trial, indicated that GÃ¶th was an SS-Major in the Concentration Camp service.

GÃ¶th's service record, however, does not support the claim of a late war promotion and he is listed in most texts as having held the rank of only ''[[HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer|SS-HauptsturmfÃ¼hrer]]'', equivalent to Captain.&lt;ref&gt;SS service record of Amon GÃ¶th, [[National Archives and Records Administration]], [[College Park, Maryland]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Execution==
[[File:Amon goeth 1946.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Amon GÃ¶th in 1946, shortly before his execution]]
After the war, the [[Supreme National Tribunal of Poland]] in KrakÃ³w found GÃ¶th guilty of murdering tens of thousands of people. He was hanged on 13 September 1946, at the age of 37, not far from the former site of the PÅaszÃ³w camp. At his execution, GÃ¶th's hands were tied behind his back. The executioner twice miscalculated the length of rope necessary to hang GÃ¶th, and it was only on the third attempt that the execution was successful.&lt;ref&gt;Isabelle Clarke and Danielle Costelle, '' La Traque des Nazis 1945â2005, soixante ans de traque'' (film documentary) {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
GÃ¶th was married and divorced twice. His first marriage was to Olga Janauschek in January 1934. They were divorced in July 1936. His second marriage was to Anny Geiger in October 1938; this ended in 1944. Soon after his second marriage ended, GÃ¶th was engaged to Ruth Irene Kalder, (nicknamed &quot;Majola&quot; in the PÅaszÃ³w camp during her stay in GÃ¶th's &quot;Red Villa&quot;), who had taken GÃ¶th's name shortly after his death. Through these relationships, GÃ¶th had two sons and two daughters. GÃ¶th's first child, a boy named Peter, died seven months after his birth from a [[diphtheria]] infection. GÃ¶th had two more children with Anny Geiger, a daughter named Ingeborg and a son named Werner. GÃ¶th's last child was a daughter named Monika (chosen mainly from GÃ¶th's childhood nickname, &quot;Mony&quot;) whom he had by Ruth Irene Kalder. Monika was born on 23 October 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crowe&quot;/&gt;

==In popular culture==
GÃ¶th's actions at PÅaszÃ³w Labor Camp became internationally known through his depiction by British actor [[Ralph Fiennes]] in the 1993 film, ''[[Schindler's List]]''. In a subsequent interview, Fiennes recalled, &lt;blockquote&gt;Evil is cumulative. It happens. People believe that theyâve got to do a job, theyâve got to take on an ideology, that theyâve got a life to lead; theyâve got to survive, a job to do, itâs every day inch by inch, little compromises, little ways of telling yourself this is how you should lead your life and suddenly then these things can happen. I mean, I could make a judgment myself privately, this is a terrible, evil, horrific man. But the job was to portray the man, the human being. Thereâs a sort of banality, that everydayness, that I think was important. And it was in the screenplay. In fact, one of the first scenes with [[Oskar Schindler]], with [[Liam Neeson]], was a scene where Iâm saying, ''You donât understand how hard it is, I have to order so many-so many meters of barbed wire and so many fencing posts and I have to get so many people from A to B.'' And, you know, heâs sort of letting off steam about the difficulties of the job.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushmm.org/museum/exhibit/focus/antisemitism/voices/transcript/?content=20100304]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fiennes won a [[BAFTA Award for Best Supporting Actor]] for his role and was also nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], and his portrayal ranked 15th on [[American Film Institute|AFI]]'s [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Heroes and Villains|list of the top 50 film villains of all time]]. Notably, he ranks as the highest non-fiction villain. When PÅaszÃ³w survivor Mila Pfefferberg was introduced to Fiennes on the set of the film, she began to shake uncontrollably, as Fiennes, attired in full SS dress uniform, reminded her of the real Amon GÃ¶th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the film's climax, GÃ¶th's hanging is dramatized. However, he is incorrectly shown patting his hair in place and saying &quot;[[Hitler salute|Heil Hitler]]&quot; moments before an officer in the [[People's Army of Poland]] kicks a chair out from under him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Louis|last=BÃ¼low|year=2007|url=http://www.auschwitz.dk/goeth.htm|title=The Nazi Butcher: Amon GÃ¶th|accessdate=12 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Monika GÃ¶th Hertwig published her memoirs under the name ''Ich muÃ doch meinen Vater lieben, oder?'' (&quot;I Must Still Love My Father, Mustn't I?&quot;). Monika also described the subsequent life of her mother, Ruth Kalder GÃ¶th, who unconditionally glorified her fiancÃ© until confronted with his role in [[the Holocaust]]. Ruth ultimately committed suicide in 1983 closely after giving an interview in Jon Blair's documentary &quot;Schindler&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kessler|first=Matthias|year=2002|language=German|publisher=Eichborn|title=Ich muÃ doch meinen Vater lieben, oder?|isbn=978-3821839141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monika Hertwig's experiences in dealing with her father's crimes are also detailed in ''Inheritance'', a 2006 documentary directed by [[James Moll]]. Also appearing in the documentary is [[Helen Jonas]], one of Amon GÃ¶th's former house slaves. The documentary details the meeting of the two women at the PÅaszÃ³w memorial site in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/pov/pov2008/inheritance/index.html |title=Inheritance |year=2011 |accessdate=26 April 2011 |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
