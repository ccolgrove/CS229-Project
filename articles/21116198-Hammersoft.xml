The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Seattle Seahawks]] season''' was the 34th season for the team in the [[National Football League]]. The Seahawks improved in [[Jim L. Mora|Jim Mora]]'s first season as their head coach, after a disappointing 4â12 record and a 3rd place finish in what was [[Mike Holmgren]]'s final season coaching the team.  However, Mora was fired January 8, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://msn.foxsports.com/nfl/story/seattle-seahawks-fire-jim-mora-010810&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of the [[2008 Seattle Seahawks season|2008 season]], then-head coach [[Mike Holmgren]] stated that 2008 would be his final season before retiring. On December 30, 2008, two days after the season ended, Holmgren officially retired and stepped down as head coach. [[Jim L. Mora|Jim Mora]], the team's assistant head coach and defensive backs coach, was officially selected as his replacement on January 13, 2009. The retirement and Jim Mora's accession had been originally announced on January 22, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mora named Seahawks head coach for 2009&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title=Mora named Seahawks head coach in 2009 | url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/seahawks/2004166684_hawk060.html | publisher=Seattle Times | date=2008-02-06 | accessdate=2009-05-23|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j0vwqjY5|archivedate=2009-08-14|deadurl=no | first=Danny | last=O'Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mora then began to replace most of the staff that Holmgren had last year. Defensive coordinator [[John Marshall]] and defensive line coach [[Dwaine Board]] were both fired on January 12, 2009. Subsequently, former [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] linebackers coach [[Casey Bradley]] was hired as the new defensive coordinator. Also, former [[New York Jets]] assistant [[Dan Quinn]] replaced Board as the defensive line coach and as the new assistant head coach.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seahawks hire Bradley as Defensive Coordinator, Quinn as new Defensive Line coach &quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Seahawks hire Bradley from Bucs to be D-Coordinator | url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/11251654 | publisher=CBS Sports | date=2008-01-12 | accessdate=2009-05-24|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j0vxFE8Q|archivedate=2009-08-14|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The offensive side was also revamped as well. Offensive coordinator [[Gil Haskell]] was dismissed after 8 years with the Seahawks. Former [[Oakland Raiders]] offensive coordinator [[Greg Knapp]], who had previously worked with Mora when he was the head coach of the [[Atlanta Falcons]], was hired as his replacement on January 14, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seahawks to hire Knapp as Offensive Coordinator&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Seahawks to hire Knapp as coordinator |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80df444e&amp;template=with-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true | publisher=National Football League | date=2009-01-24 | accessdate=2009-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mora also fired wide receivers coach [[Keith Gilbertson]] and was replaced with former [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] assistant receivers coach Robert Prince. Finally, tight ends coach [[Jim Lind (football)|Jim Lind]] and special teams assistant [[John Jamison]] both retired after the 2008 season. [[Mike DeBord]], formerly the offensive line assistant coach, replaced Lind although no replacement has been named for Jamison.

===Key departures===
Running back [[Maurice Morris]], who backed up starter [[Julius Jones]] last season, signed with the [[Detroit Lions]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Morris signs with Lions&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Morris signs with Lions | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80efeb66&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true | publisher=National Football league | accessdate=2009-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seahawks also lost defensive tackle [[Rocky Bernard]] to the [[New York Giants]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Giants sign Rocky Bernard&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Giants Sign DT Rocky Bernard | url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/sports/football/giants/Giants-Sign-Former-Seattle-DT-Rocky-Bernard.html | publisher=NBC New York | accessdate=2009-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fan favorite [[Bobby Engram]] was released and signed with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] after the Seahawks signed wide receiver [[T.J. Houshmandzadeh]].  The Seahawks were also in talks with fullback [[Leonard Weaver]] about a new contract, but ultimately he signed with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] instead. Also, the Seahawks traded away Pro Bowl linebacker [[Julian Peterson]] to the Lions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090314/ap_on_sp_fo_ne/fbn_lions_seahawks_trade;_ylt=AndsyYY44ci1X7NnnS96YRkLMxIF Lions Get Peterson in Return for Redding] Yahoo Sports, March 14, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  In all, the Seahawks lost a total of 14 players to free agency.

[[File:Leroy-Hill-2008-11-02-vsEagles.jpg|right|thumb|Seahawks placed the franchise tag on Linebacker Leroy Hill, but released him to free agency before signing him to a long-term deal.]]
Linebacker [[Leroy Hill]] was placed under the [[franchise tag]] on February 19, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seahawks placed franchise tag on Leroy Hill&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Seahawks puts franchise tag on Hill | url=http://www.seahawks.com/news/press/article-1/seahawks-place-franchise-tag-on-hill/614739de-3a3d-45dc-bc69-f11b61ceecf9 | publisher=Seattle Seahawks | accessdate=2009-02-19|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j0vvdaYw|archivedate=2009-08-14|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, discussions for a long term deal between Hill and the Seahawks were slow, and they continued to stall up to the draft. In a effort to speed up negotiations. the Seahawks removed their franchise tag on Hill less than 24 hours within the first draft day, thereby releasing him to free agency and allowing him to sign with other teams. However, on April 30, 2009, Hill agreed to a 6-year, 38 million dollar deal with the Seahawks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seahawks resign Hill to 6-year deal&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Seahawks resign Leroy Hill to long-term deal | url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/167755.asp| publisher=Seattle Post Intelligence| accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moments after signing [[Edgerrin James]] to a one-year deal, the Seahawks release running back [[T.J. Duckett]] to make room on their roster. Duckett previously led the team in rushing touchdowns last year.

Safety [[Brian Russell]] was also released on September 5, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Seahawks &amp;#124; Brian Russell out, Lawyer Milloy in as Seahawks free safety &amp;#124; Seattle Times Newspaper &lt;!-- BOT GENERATED TITLE --&gt;|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/seahawks/2009813491_hawk06.html|work=The Seattle Times|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jfcSxpJq|archivedate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no|accessdate=2009-09-07 | first=Danny | last=O'Neil | date=September 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell had started at safety for the Seahawks since coming in at the start of the 2007 season. [[Lawyer Milloy]], signed after Russell's departure, is expected to fill his spot along with [[Jordan Babineaux]].

===Key additions===
The Seahawks made big splashes during the offseason as well. On March 1, Seattle signed defensive tackle [[Colin Cole (American football)|Colin Cole]] from the [[Green Bay Packers]] to a 5-year contract to address problems on their defensive line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090302/ap_on_sp_fo_ne/fbn_seahawks_cole;_ylt=Ap2lZLs1O3j0xk.urj.6YgALMxIF DT Cole Agrees to Deal With Seahawks] Yahoo Sports, March 1, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; They also received defensive tackle [[Cory Redding]] and a fifth round pick in exchange for the Peterson trade mentioned above.

Perhaps the biggest move in free agency, however, was the signing of former Pro Bowl wide receiver [[T.J. Houshmandzadeh]] from the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] to a 5-year, $40 million deal with $15 million guaranteed two days after signing Cole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Clayton |first=John |title=Houshmandzadeh heads West |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3947108 |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-03-02 |accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Houshmandzadeh was rated as one of the top free agents available.

After rescinding their franchise tag on Hill, the Seahawks signed former [[Carolina Panthers]] corner back [[Ken Lucas (American football)|Ken Lucas]] to a one year deal in order to bolster their pass coverage. They also signed fullback [[Justin Griffith]] from the [[Oakland Raiders]] to address the departure of Weaver.&lt;ref name=&quot;Seahawks sign CB Lucas, also agree to terms with FB Griffith&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Seahawks sign CB Lucas, also agreed to terms with FB Griffith | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d81007005&amp;template=without-video-with-comments&amp;confirm=true| publisher=National Football League| accessdate=2009-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was known that releasing of Hill created some flexibility on the [[salary cap]] of where these two deals go into play.

On August 25, 2009, the Seahawks signed running back [[Edgerrin James]] to a 1-year, $2 million dollar deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johns |first=Greg |title=Done deal: Seahawks sign Edge, cut Duckett|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/177421.asp |publisher=Seattle Post Intelligencer |date=2009-08-25 |accessdate=2009-08-30|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jcZuKGjF|archivedate=2009-09-07|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; James last played with division rival [[Arizona Cardinals]] for the past three seasaons and played a vital role in their playoff run last year. The Seahawks also signed veteran safety [[Lawyer Milloy]] to a one-year deal, who is expected to make a big impact to the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Johns |first=Greg |title=Seahawks sign Milloy, add new offensive tackle|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlesports/archives/178479.asp|publisher=Seattle Post Intelligencer |date=2009-09-06 |accessdate=2009-09-07|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5jfcTSCvh|archivedate=2009-09-09|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Head Coach [[Jim L. Mora|Jim Mora]] era began his coaching debut for the Seahawks with a game at home against division rival [[St. Louis Rams]]. Quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] and the offense struggled early, turning over the ball three times (two interceptions and one fumble) on the first quarter alone. After Rams kicker [[Josh Brown (American football)|Josh Brown]] missed a 37-yard field goal for the lead, Hasselbeck led the Seahawks to their first score of the game after he connected with tight end [[John Carlson (American football)|John Carlson]] for a touchdown. With the second quarter coming to a close, St. Louis returned a blocked field goal for a touchdown, only to have it overruled by a penalty. This gave another chance for the Seahawks to score, as Hasselbeck threw his second touchdown of the game to [[Nate Burleson]] to put the Seahawks up 14â0 by halftime.

When the third quarter started, the Seahawks looked to increase its lead to win the game. Hasselbeck would lead the Seahawks to a 99-yard drive, capping it off 33-yard touchdown pass to Carlson. [[Julius Jones]] would seal the win with a 62-yard touchdown (and rushing 119 in total) run to put Seattle up by 28. The Seahawks defense would shutout the Rams, as they totaled only 247 total yards on offense and forcing two fumbles and three sacks. Seattle moved to 1â0 to start off the season, and beat the Rams for the ninth straight time.

Coming off their shutout home win over the Rams, the Seahawks flew to [[Candlestick Park]] for a Week 2 NFC West showdown with the [[San Francisco 49ers]].

Seattle would trail early in the first quarter as 49ers kicker [[Joe Nedney]] got a 37-yard field goal, along with running back [[Frank Gore]] getting a 79-yard touchdown run.  The Seahawks would respond in the second quarter as kicker [[Olindo Mare]] made a 36-yard field goal.  San Francisco would reply with Nedney making a 42-yard field goal. As the Seahawks looked to bounced back from the deficit, quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] received an injury as he was hit on the ground by 49ers linebacker [[Patrick Willis]]. Hasselbeck would leave the game with cracked ribs, yet Seattle closed out the half with backup [[Seneca Wallace]] completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Julius Jones]].

In the third quarter, the Seahawks deficit quickly increased as on the 49ers' first offensive play of the second half, Gore would explode for an 80-yard touchdown run.  San Francisco would close the game out in the fourth quarter as Nedney nailed a 39-yard field goal.

With the loss, Seattle fell to 1â1.

Hoping to rebound from their divisional road loss to the 49ers, the Seahawks went home, donned their alternate uniforms, and prepared for a Week 3 duel with the [[Chicago Bears]].  Due to quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]]'s rib injury, [[Seneca Wallace]] got the start for the game.

Seattle would take flight in the first quarter with Wallace's 39-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Julius Jones]] and kicker [[Olindo Mare]]'s 46-yard field goal.  The Seahawks would tack on Mare's 37-yard field goal in the second quarter, yet the Bears would answer with quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]'s 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Greg Olsen (American football)|Greg Olsen]].

Chicago would take in the lead in the third quarter with Cutler's 7-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Johnny Knox]], followed by kicker [[Robbie Gould]]'s 37-yard field goal.  The Seahawks would regain the lead in the fourth quarter with Mare's 39-yard and 46-yard field goal.  However, the Bears got the last laugh as Cutler hooked up with wide receiver [[Devin Hester]] on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver [[Earl Bennett]]).  Seattle tried to rally, but Chicago's defense held on for the win.

With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 1â2.

After missing two weeks with cracked ribs, quarterback [[Matt Hasselbeck]] played for the first time since week two at San Francisco. Trying to snap a three-game losing streak, Hasselbeck started the offense off quickly, with [[Olindo Mare]] completing two field goals  to put Seattle up by 6. The Seahawks defense also held its own, including a 4th-and-2 stop when the Jaguars threaten to score in the red zone. Later in the 2nd quarter, Hasselbeck would find wide receiver [[T.J. Houshmandzadeh]] for his first touchdown of the year, putting Seattle up 13â0. On their next offensive drive, Hasselbeck would connect with [[Nate Burleson]] for another touchdown, extending their lead to 20â0, which they took into halftime.

Starting the third quarter on offense, [[David Garrard]] and the Jaguars tried to put some points on the board. However, all of their hopes were dashed when defensive end [[Cory Redding]] recovered a key fumble for 26 yards. Taking advantage of this, Hasselbeck again found Houshmandzadeh for his second touchdown to seal the game at 27â0. The Seahawks would later score again as Matt Hasselbeck threw his fourth touchdown again to Burleson, while defensive end [[Nick Reed]] scored from 79 yards out from a fumble recovery, putting the Seahawks up 41â0.

With the win, the Seahawks improved to 2â3 for the season.
