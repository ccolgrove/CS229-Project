The '''Golden Quadrilateral'''  is a highway network connecting India's [[List of most populous metropolitan areas in India|four largest metropolises]]:  [[Delhi]], [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]] and [[Kolkata]], thus forming a [[quadrilateral]] of sorts. Four other top ten metropolises: [[Bangalore]], [[Pune]], [[Ahmedabad]], and [[Surat]], are also served by the network. The largest [[highway]] project in India, initiated by [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]], it is the first phase of the [[National Highways Development Project]] (NHDP), and consists of building {{convert|5846|km|mi|abbr=on}} of four/six lane express highways at a cost of {{INRConvert|60000|c|1}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhai.org/roadnetwork.htm] Road network-Source-The National Highways Authority of India (NHAI)&lt;/ref&gt;

The vast majority of the Golden Quadrilateral (GQ) is not [[Limited-access road|access controlled]], although safety features such as guardrails, shoulders, and high-visibility signs are used. As of 31 October 2010, {{convert|5806|km|mi|abbr=on}} of the entire work has been completed and work on remaining 40&amp;nbsp;km is under progress.&lt;ref name=&quot;nhai_progress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhai.org/gqmain_english.htm|title=National Highways Development Project Map|publisher=National Highways Institute of India}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2009, it was announced that the existing four-laned highways would be converted into six-lane highways.&lt;ref name=&quot;nh_expansion&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/09/21/india-ambassador-shankar-business-emerging-markets-economy.html|title=Ambassador: Indian Economy Will Grow|author=Megha Bahree|publisher=Forbes|date=September 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was reported at various stages to be behind schedule, mainly due to land acquisition constraints and disputes with contractors which had to be re-negotiated.&lt;ref name=&quot;financialexpress&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/fe_full_story.php?content_id=100459|title=Golden Quadrilateral still has miles to go|publisher=Financial Express}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes_india&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.in.com/article/briefing/crossing-the-chasm/4202/1|author=R.N. Bhaskar|publisher=Forbes India|title=Crossing the chasm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The GQ project is managed by the [[National Highways Authority of India]] (NHAI) under the [[Government of India#The Union Ministries|Ministry of Road, Transport and Highways]]. The [[Mumbai-Pune Expressway]], the first [[controlled-access]] [[toll road]] to be built in India is a part of the GQ Project though not funded by NHAI, and separate from [[National Highway 4 (India)|the main highway]]. [[Infrastructure Leasing &amp; Financial Services]] ([[IL&amp;FS]]) has been one of the major contributors to the infrastructural development activity in the GQ project.

== Economic benefits ==
The '''''GQ''''' project establishes better and faster transport networks between many major cities and ports. It provides an impetus to smoother movement of products and people within India. It enables industrial and job development in smaller [[town]]s through access to markets. It provides opportunities for farmers through better transportation of produce from the agricultural hinterland to major cities and [[ports]] for [[export]], through lesser wastage and spoils. Finally, it drives economic growth directly through construction as well as through indirect demand for cement, steel and other construction materials.It gives an impetus to Truck transport throughout India.

== Route ==
Only [[National Highway (India)|National Highways]] are used in the Golden Quadrilateral. The four legs use the following National Highways:
* Delhi â Kolkata: [[National Highway 2 (India)|NH 2]]
* Delhi â Mumbai: [[National Highway 8 (India)|NH 8]] (Delhi â [[Kishangarh]]), [[National Highway 79A (India)|NH 79A]] ([[Ajmer]] bypass), [[National Highway 79 (India)|NH 79]] ([[Nasirabad]] â [[Chittaurgarh]]), [[National Highway 76 (India)|NH 76]] (Chittaurgarh â [[Udaipur]]), [[National Highway 8 (India)|NH 8]] (Udaipur â Mumbai)
* Mumbai â Chennai: [[National Highway 4 (India)|NH 4]] (Mumbai â [[Bangalore]]), [[National Highway 7 (India)|NH 7]] (Bangalore â [[Krishnagiri]]), [[National Highway 46 (India)|NH 46]] (Krishnagiri â [[Ranipet]]), [[National Highway 4 (India)|NH 4]] (Ranipet â Chennai)
* Kolkata â Chennai: [[National Highway 6 (India)|NH 6]] (Kolkata â [[Kharagpur]]), [[National Highway 60 (India)|NH 60]] (Kharagpur â [[Balasore]]), [[National Highway 5 (India)|NH 5]] (Balasore â Chennai)

== Future plans ==
Sections of [[National Highway 2 (India)|NH 2]], [[National Highway 5 (India)|NH 5]] and [[National Highway 8 (India)|NH 8]] have now been prioritized for further widening to six lanes under DBFO (Design, Build, Finance, Operate) pattern and more sections would be six-laned in the near future. On NH 8 Six lanes work is completed from [[Vadodara]] to [[Surat]] and now the highway is 6-track

== Corruption allegations ==
{{Main|Satyendra Dubey}}

In August 2003, [[Jharkhand]]-based project director [[Satyendra Dubey]], in a letter to the Prime Minister, outlined a list of malafide actions in a segment of this highway in [[Bihar]]. Dubey's claims included that big contractors had inside information from NHAI officials,&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2003/dec/05bihar1.htm] Bihar govt wakes up to IITian's murder-Source-Rediff News&lt;/ref&gt; that the contractors for this stretch were not executing the project themselves (as stipulated in the contract) but subcontracting the work small builders who lacked technical expertise&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;/&gt; and that no follow-up was performed after awarding advances.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;/&gt;  Dubey's name was leaked by the PMO to the NHAI,&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;/&gt; and he was transferred against his wishes to [[Gaya, India|Gaya]], [[Bihar]], where he was murdered on November 27.&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2003&quot;/&gt;

The NHAI eventually admitted that Dubey's charges were substantiated, and implemented &quot;radical reforms&quot; in selection and contract procedures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/res/web/pIe/full_story.php?content_id=78880] NHAI report to CBI proves Dubey right, contract rules being rewritten-Source-Indian Express&lt;/ref&gt;  After a lengthy [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] investigation, Mantu Kumar and three accomplices were arrested and charged with murder.  Mantu escaped from court on September 19, 2005,&lt;ref name=&quot;rediff2005&quot;&gt;[http://www.rediff.com/news/2005/sep/13dubey.htm] Whistleblower in the 2004 National Highway Authority of India case escaped from police custody on Tuesday in Patna-Source-Rediff News&lt;/ref&gt; but was recaptured a month later.  In 2010, Mantu and two others were convicted murder and other offenses and sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.oneindia.in/2010/03/27/satyendranath-dubey-killers-get-life-imprisonment.html] Satyendranath Dubey killers get life imprisonment-Source-Oneindia.com&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accidents ==
In February 2006, a 600 meter stretch of the highway connecting [[Kolkata]] to [[Chennai]] subsided into the ground, opening up ten meter gorges near [[Bally (Howrah)|Bally]], [[West Bengal]].&lt;ref name=&quot;kolkatasink&quot;&gt;[http://www.indianexpress.com/full_story.php?content_id=87604] GQ: Howrah highway stretch caves in-Source-Indian Express]&lt;/ref&gt; This stretch had been completed a year back by a Malaysian multinational firm, selected after global tendering.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}
