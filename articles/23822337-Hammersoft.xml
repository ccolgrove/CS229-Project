'''MAN Turbo AG''' was a company based in [[Munich]], [[Germany]], that produced [[turbocharger]]s, and previously also turbine aeroengines.  It was owned by the German conglomerate [[MAN SE]].  In 2010, MAN Turbo and [[MAN Diesel]] were merged to form [[MAN Diesel &amp; Turbo]].

==History==
In 1954, [[BMW]] formed '''BMW Studienge-sellschaft fÃ¼r Triebwerkbau GmbH''' as part of West German efforts to resume aircraft engine production.&lt;ref name=&quot;75 Years&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.gbjyearbook.com/yb_news_story.html?release=4013 |title= 75 years: MTU Aero Engines celebrates anniversary |work= Global Business Jet |publisher= Stansted News Limited| accessdate= 20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was renamed '''BMW Triebwerkbau GmbH''' in 1957, and began producing  [[General Electric J79|General Electric J79-11A]] [[turbojet]]s for the [[Lockheed F-104 Starfighter|Lockheed F-104G Starfighter]] program.

In 1960, [[MAN AG]] acquired 50 percent of BMW Triebwerkbau GmbH. MAN AG purchased the remainder of the company in 1965, and merged it with MAN Turbomotoren GmbH to form MAN Turbo GmbH.&lt;ref name=&quot;75 Years&quot; /&gt;

In Autumn 1968, MAN Turbo and [[Daimler-Benz]] formed Entwicklungsgesellschaft fÃ¼r Turbomotoren GmbH ([[MTU Aero Engines|Motoren- und Turbinen-Union MÃ¼nchen GmbH]] from 1969) as a 50/50 joint venture, combining their aircraft engine development and manufacturing interests.&lt;ref name=&quot;75 Years&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Flight 1970&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1970/1970%20-%200036.html |date= 1 January 1970 |title= AERO ENGINES 1970 |work= Flight International |publisher= Flight International |accessdate= 20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAN Turbo remained a separate company under MAN AG.
