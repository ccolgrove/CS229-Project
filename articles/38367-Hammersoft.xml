==Early life and career==
Schindler was born on 28 April 1908 into a [[Sudeten German]] family in [[Svitavy|Zwittau]], [[Moravia]], [[Austria-Hungary]].  His parents, Hans Schindler and Franziska Luser, were divorced when he was 27. Oskar was always very close to his younger sister, Elfriede.  Schindler was brought up within the [[Roman Catholic Church]]. Although he never formally renounced his religion, Oskar was never more than an indifferent Catholic.&lt;ref name= NYTobit/&gt; After school he worked as a commercial salesman.

[[File:Oskar&amp;Emilie 1946.jpg|left|thumb|Oskar and Emilie in 1946]]
On 6 March 1928, Schindler married  [[Emilie Schindler|Emilie Pelzl]] (1907â2001), daughter of a wealthy [[Sudeten German]] farmer from [[MaletÃ­n|Maletein]]. A pious Catholic, Emilie had received most of her education in a nearby [[monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Emilie Schindler, 93, Dies; Saved Jews in War| date=October 8, 2001|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|url= http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0DE1DD133CF93BA35753C1A9679C8B63&amp;scp=8&amp;sq|accessdate=2009-01-20}} Schindler's wife [[Emilie Schindler|Emilie]] was born on 22 October 1907, the daughter of Josef and Maria Pelzl, and died on 5 October 2001, at age 93 in a hospital in Berlin. They did not have children.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the [[Great Depression]], Oskar changed jobs several times. He also tried starting various businesses, but always went bankrupt. He joined the separatist [[Sudeten German Party]] in 1935.  Though officially a citizen of [[Czechoslovakia]], Schindler also became a spy for the [[Abwehr]], then commanded by Admiral [[Wilhelm Canaris]].&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;  He was convicted of  espionage and imprisoned by the Czechoslovakian government in July 1938, but after the [[Munich Agreement]], he was released as a political prisoner. In 1939 Schindler joined the [[Nazi Party]]. One source contends that he also continued to work for Canaris and the Abwehr, paving the way for the [[Wehrmacht]]'s invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939.&lt;ref name=grunt&gt;Jitka GruntovÃ¡, ''Legendy a fakta o Oskaru Schindlerovi''. NaÅ¡e vojsko, 2002 (ISBN 80-206-0607-6).&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
{{The Holocaust}}
As an opportunistic businessman, Schindler was one of many who sought to profit from the [[Invasion of Poland (1939)|German invasion of Poland]] in 1939. He gained ownership from a bankruptcy court of an idle [[enamelware]] factory in [[KrakÃ³w]],&lt;ref name = maple /&gt; named Pierwsza MaÅopolska Fabryka NaczyÅ Emaliowanych i WyrobÃ³w Blaszanych &quot;Rekord&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Waldemar | last=Brzoskwinia | title= Spacerownik.

Schindler soon adapted his lifestyle to his income. He became a well-respected guest at [[Schutzstaffel|Nazi SS]] [[elite]] parties, having easy chats with high-ranking SS officers, often for his benefit.&lt;ref name=DC /&gt;  Initially Schindler may have been motivated by money, as Jewish labour cost less, but later he began shielding his workers without regard for cost. He would, for instance, claim that certain unskilled workers were essential to the factory.&lt;ref name=maple /&gt;

While witnessing a 1943 raid on the [[KrakÃ³w Ghetto]], where soldiers were used to round up the inhabitants for shipment to the [[concentration camp]] at [[KrakÃ³w-PÅaszÃ³w concentration camp|PÅaszÃ³w]], Schindler was appalled by the murder of many of the Jews who had been working for him.&lt;ref name = DC /&gt; He was a very persuasive individual, and after the raid, increasingly used all of his skills to protect his ''[[Schindlerjuden]]'' (&quot;Schindler's Jews&quot;), as they came to be called. Schindler went out of his way to take care of the Jews who worked at DEF, often calling on his legendary charm and ingratiating manner to help his workers get out of difficult situations.&lt;ref name=DC /&gt; Once, says author Eric Silver in ''The Book of the Just'', &quot;Two [[Gestapo]] men came to his office and demanded that he hand over a family of five who had bought forged Polish identity papers. 'Three hours after they walked in,' Schindler said, 'two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded{{' &quot;}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eric Silver|title=The book of the just &amp;ndash; the silent heroes who saved Jews from Hitler|publisher=Weidenfeld and Nicholson|location=London|year=1992|isbn=0802113478 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The special status of his factory (&quot;business essential to the war effort&quot;) became the decisive factor for Schindler's efforts to support his Jewish workers. Whenever &quot;Schindler Jews&quot; were threatened with deportation, he claimed exemptions for them.  Wives, children, and even handicapped persons were shown to be necessary mechanics and metalworkers.&lt;ref name=maple /&gt;

In the factory itself, Jewish workers were treated civilly, with none of the &quot;shouting, abuse and random killing&quot; that was going on in the PÅaszÃ³w camp next-door. The Jews were able to pray in a [[minyan]] daily, and gathered at night to learn [[Chumash (Judaism)|Chumash]] and exchange [[Torah study#D'var Torah|words of Torah]] and stories of [[Gedolim]]. At the close of [[Shabbat]], the workers gathered for [[Shalosh Seudos]] and sang ''[[zemirot]]'' (Shabbat-table songs), said words of Torah, and told stories of [[Tzadik|tzaddikim]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Songs of Hope |last=Werdyger |first=Duvid |year=1993 |place=Lakewood, N.J. |pages=161&amp;ndash;162|publisher=CIS Publishers |isbn=1560622261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Schindler was arrested three times on suspicion of [[black market]] activities and complicity in [[embezzlement]], as well as breaking the [[Nuremberg Laws]] by kissing a Jewish girl. [[Amon GÃ¶th]], the commandant of the PÅaszÃ³w camp, and other SS guards used Jewish property (such as money, jewellery, and works of art) for themselves, although according to law, it belonged to the Reich. Schindler arranged the sale of such items on the black market. None of his arrests led to a trial, primarily because he bribed government officials to avoid further investigation.&lt;ref name=NYTobit /&gt;&lt;ref name=maple /&gt;

As the [[Red Army]] drew nearer to [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] and the other easternmost concentration camps, the SS began evacuating the remaining prisoners westward. Amon GÃ¶th's personal secretary, [[Mietek Pemper]], alerted Schindler to the Nazis' plans to close all factories not directly involved with the war effort, including Schindler's enamelware facility.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt; Pemper also persuaded and encouraged Schindler to switch production from enamelware to anti-tank grenades in an effort to save Schindler's Jewish workers.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite news |first=|last=|title=Mietek Pemper |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/8578020/Mietek-Pemper.html |work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |publisher= |date=2011-06-15 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news |first=Douglas|last=Martin|title=Mietek Pemper, 91, Camp Inmate Who Compiled Schindlerâs List |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/19/world/europe/19pemper.html |work=[[New York Times]] |publisher=|date=2011-06-18 |accessdate=2011-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tipped off to the factory closure, Schindler persuaded the SS officials to allow him to move his 1,200 Jewish workers to [[BrnÄnec|BrÃ¼nnlitz]] ([[czech language|Czech]]: ''BrnÄnec''), in the [[German-speaking]] [[Sudetenland]], thus sparing them from certain death in the gas chambers. Mietek Pemper further aided Schindler's efforts by compiling and typing the list of 1,200 Jews - 1,000 of Schindler's workers and 200 other inmates - who were sent to BrÃ¼nnlitz in October 1944.&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; 

In BrÃ¼nnlitz, Schindler gained another [[Aryanization|former Jewish factory]], which was scheduled to produce hand grenades and parts for  [[V2 rocket]]s. It is unclear how much armament was actually produced there; Schindler and some of the workers claimed in the immediate post-war years that there had been no production that would have been useful to the German war effort, and even that some or all of the output had been deliberately faulty product.

==After the war==
Schindler and his wife fled to Austria's U.S. zone, escaping prosecution by dressing in prison clothes and carrying a letter testifying to their heroic actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gutman|title=Encyclopedia of the Holocaust|publisher=MacMillan Publishing Company|year=1995|isbn=0028645278}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of the war, Schindler had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black-market purchases of supplies for his workers. Virtually destitute, he moved briefly to [[Regensburg]] and later [[Munich]], but did not prosper in postwar Germany. In fact, he was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organizations. Eventually, Schindler emigrated to [[Argentina]] in 1948, where he went bankrupt. He left his wife Emilie in 1957 and returned to Germany in 1958, where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures.&lt;ref name=maple/&gt; Schindler settled down in a small apartment at Am Hauptbahnhof Nr. 4 in [[Frankfurt am Main]], West Germany and tried again&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; with help from a Jewish organization&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; to establish a cement factory. This, too, went bankrupt in 1961. His business partners cancelled their partnership.  In 1968 he began receiving a small pension from the West German government.

[[File:SchindlerHildesheim.jpg|thumb|right|Commemorative plaque at Goettingstrasse 30, [[Hildesheim]]]]
In 1971, Schindler moved to live with friends at Goettingstrasse Nr. 30 in [[Hildesheim]]. Due to a heart complaint he was taken to the Saint Bernward Hospital in Hildesheim on 12 September 1974, where he died on 9 October 1974, at the age of 66. At the time of his death, he was surrounded by friends and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/119912/Schindler-s-List/overview?scp=1&amp;sq=schindler%27s%20list&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times | first=Janet | last=Maslin | accessdate=20 May 2010 | title=Movies: About Schindler's List}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=April 2010}} He died penniless;&lt;ref name=&quot;life&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oskarschindler.com/ |title=Oskar Schindler: His List of Life |last=Bulow |first=Louis |year=2009 |accessdate=2010-07-04 |publisher=oskarschindler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; the costs for his stay in the hospital were paid from social welfare of the city of Hildesheim.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hildesheim&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=City of Hildesheim Archives (in German)|date=2 October 1999|url=http://www.stadtarchiv-hildesheim.de/publikationen/dok_35_schindler.htm|accessdate=2007-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlddu.de/index.php?id=244941&amp;middle=holidaycheck&amp;anz=mb&amp;bid=1155834312&amp;ch=ub Photos of house and plaque] located at GÃ¶ttingstr.30 in Hildesheim where Oskar Schindler lived from 1972 to his death in 1974.

[[File:Schindlergrave - side view.jpg|right|thumb|Side view of Schindler's grave, piled with small stones left by Jewish visitors]]
Schindler's grave is located on the mountainside below Zion Gate and the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City walls]]. Stones placed on top of the grave are a sign of gratitude from Jewish visitors, according to [[Bereavement in Judaism#Visiting the gravesite|Jewish tradition]], although Schindler himself was not Jewish. On his grave, the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] inscription reads: &quot;[[Righteous among the Nations]]&quot;, an [[honorific]] used by the [[State of Israel]] to describe non-Jews who risked their lives during [[the Holocaust]] to save [[Jews]] from extermination by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]]. The German inscription reads: &quot;The Unforgettable Lifesaver of 1200 Persecuted Jews&quot; 

No one knows what Schindler's motives were. He was quoted as saying &quot;I knew the people who worked for me... When you know people, you have to behave towards them like human beings.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;David M. Crowe, ''Oskar Schindler: The Untold Account of His Life, Wartime Activities, and the True Story Behind The List''. Philadelphia: Westview Press, 2004 (ISBN 0-8133-3375-X).&lt;/ref&gt;

The writer Herbert Steinhouse, who interviewed Schindler in 1948 at the behest of some of the surviving ''Schindlerjuden'' (Schindler's Jews), wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Oskar Schindler's exceptional deeds stemmed from just that elementary sense of decency and humanity that our sophisticated age seldom sincerely believes in. A repentant opportunist saw the light and rebelled against the sadism and vile criminality all around him. The inference may be disappointingly simple, especially for all amateur psychoanalysts who would prefer the deeper and more mysterious motive that may, if it is true, still lie unprobed and unappreciated. But an hour with Oskar Schindler encourages belief in the simple answer.&quot;&lt;ref name=maple /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Legacy==
===''Schindler's List'' (''Schindler's Ark'')===
Schindler's story, retold by Holocaust survivor [[Poldek Pfefferberg]], was the basis for [[Thomas Keneally]]'s book ''[[Schindler's Ark]]'' (the novel was published in America as ''Schindler's  List''), which was adapted into the 1993 movie ''[[Schindler's List]]'' by [[Steven Spielberg]]. In the film, he is played by [[Liam Neeson]], who was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his portrayal.  The film won seven [[Oscars]], including the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. The prominence of Spielberg's film introduced Schindler into popular culture. As the film is the sole source of most people's knowledge of Schindler, he is generally perceived much as Spielberg's film depicts him: as a man who was instinctively driven by profit-driven amorality, but who at some point made a silent but conscious decision that preserving the lives of his Jewish employees was imperative, even if requiring massive payments to induce Nazis to turn a blind eye.

Other film treatments have included a 1983 British television documentary produced by Thames Television, narrated by Sir [[Dirk Bogarde]] entitled, ''Schindler: The Documentary'' (released in the US in 1994 as ''Schindler: The Real Story''),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/60358/Schindler-The-Real-Story/overview | work=The New York Times | first=Ginia | last=Bellafante | accessdate=20 May 2010 | title=Test}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a 1998 [[A&amp;E Biography]] special, ''Oskar Schindler: The Man Behind the List''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tv.nytimes.com/show/57324/Oskar-Schindler-The-Man-Behind-the-List/overview | work=The New York Times | first=Walter | last=Goodman | accessdate=20 May 2010 | title=Test}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schindler's suitcase===
In late 1999 a suitcase belonging to Schindler was discovered, containing over 7,000&amp;nbsp;photographs and documents, including the list of Schindler's Jewish workers. The document, on his enamelware factory's letterhead, had been provided to the SS stating that the named workers were &quot;essential&quot; employees. Friends of Schindler found the suitcase in the attic of a house in [[Hildesheim]], where he had been staying at the time of his death. The friends took the suitcase to Stuttgart, where its discovery was reported by a newspaper, the ''[[Stuttgarter Zeitung]]''. The contents of the suitcase, including the list of the names of those he had saved and the text of his farewell speech before leaving his Jewish workers in 1945, are now at the Holocaust museum of [[Yad Vashem]] in [[Israel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oskarschindler.com/16.htm |title=The Suitcase |last=Bulow |first=Louis |year=2009 |publisher=oskarschindler.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Enamel factory.JPG|thumb|Schindler's enamel factory in 2009]]

===List of Schindlerjuden===
{{main|List of Schindlerjuden}}
In early April 2009, a second list was discovered at the [[State Library of New South Wales]], Australia by workers combing through boxes of materials collected by author Thomas Keneally.  The 13-page document, yellow and fragile, was filed between research notes and original newspaper clippings.  This list, given to Keneally in 1980 by [[Leopold Pfefferberg]], who was listed as worker number 173, differs slightly from the other list, but is nonetheless considered to be genuine and authentic.  It is believed that several lists were made during the war as the protected population changed. This particular list, dated 18 April 1945, was given to Keneally by Pfefferberg when he was persuading Keneally to write Schindler's story. In the last months of the war, German Nazi camps stepped up their extermination efforts.  This list is believed to have saved the lives of 801 people from death in the gas chambers. It was this list, taken with the surrounding events of the time, that inspired Keneally to write his novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | url = http://news.yahoo.com/s/afp/20090406/ts_afp/australiagermanyhistorywwiiholocaustschindler | publisher = Yahoo! | work = News | title = Schingler | date = 2009-04-06 | format = {{dead link|date=May 2010}} | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;
