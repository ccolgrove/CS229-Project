'''Lynda Jean Carter''' (born July 24, 1951) is an [[United States|American]] [[actress]] and singer, best known for being [[List of United States representatives at Miss World|Miss World USA]] and as the star of the 1970s television series ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|The New Original Wonder Woman]]'' (1975â77) and ''The New Adventures of Wonder Woman'' (1977-79).

==Early life==
Carter was born '''Lynda Jean Carter''' in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].&lt;ref name=TorStar&gt;{{cite news|title= Lynda Carter: Beauty and the creative fire|author= Micki Moore|newspaper= Toronto Star|date= January 30, 1990|page= E1|publisher= Torstar Syndication Services|location= Toronto|issn= 03190781|accessdate= 2011-9-23|quote= A dedicated, hard-working performer, Lynda Jean Carter was born in Phoenix, Ariz., 38 years ago, the youngest of three children.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her father, Colby Carter, is an art dealer of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent and her mother, Juana CÃ³rdova, is of [[Mexican American|Mexican]] descent with roots in [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latina.ms/linda_jean_cordova_carter.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and previously worked in the telephone industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;lifetime&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Lynda Jean Cardoba|work=Wonderland|url=http://www.wonderland-site.com/html/miscel/bios/bios1b.htm|accessdate=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Lynda speaks fluent Spanish.{{citation needed|date=October 2011}}
Carter grew up an avid reader of the [[Wonder Woman]] comic books. She went to [[Arcadia High School (Arizona)|Arcadia High School]] in Phoenix and Kachina Elementary School.
 
During high school, Carter performed in a band called Just Us, consisting of a marimba, a conga drum, an acoustic guitar, and a stand-up bass played by another girl. When she was 17, Lynda joined two of her cousins in another band called The Relatives. Actor [[Gary Burghoff]] was the drummer. The group opened at the [[Sahara Hotel and Casino]] lounge in [[Las Vegas, Nevada]], for three months; and, because Lynda was under 21, she had to enter through the kitchen. She attended [[Arizona State University]] and was a member of [[Alpha Xi Delta]]. After being voted &quot;Most Talented,&quot; she dropped out to pursue a career in music. In 1970, Carter sang with The Garfin Gathering with Lynda Carter. Their first performance was in a [[San Francisco]] hotel so new that it had no sidewalk entrance. Consequently, they played mostly to the janitors and hotel guests who parked their cars in the underground garage. She returned to Arizona in 1972.

==Career==
In 1972, Carter entered a local [[beauty contest]] and gained national attention in the United States by winning [[List of United States representatives at Miss World|Miss World USA]], representing Arizona;&lt;ref name=&quot;lifetime&quot;/&gt; in the international 1972 [[Miss World 1972|Miss World]] pageant, representing the U.S., she reached the semi-finals. After taking acting classes at several [[New York]] acting schools, she began making appearances on such TV shows as ''[[Starsky and Hutch]],'' ''[[Cos (TV series)|Cos]],'' and ''Nakia'' and in &quot;B-movies,&quot; including her only nude appearance, in ''[[Bobbie Jo and the Outlaw]]'' (1976).

===''Wonder Woman''===
[[Image:Wonder Woman bracelets.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Lynda Carter as [[Wonder Woman]], displaying her ability to deflect bullets using her bracelets.]] 
Carter's acting career took off when she landed the starring role in ''[[Wonder Woman (TV series)|The New Adventures of Wonder Woman]]'' as Wonder Woman and her alter ego Diana Prince. The savings her parents had set aside for her to pursue acting in Los Angeles was almost depleted, and she was close to returning to Arizona when her manager informed her that she had won the part. Her earnest performance endeared her to fans and critics, and the series lasted three seasons. Thirty years after first taking on the role, Carter continues to be closely identified with Wonder Woman.

As the program was winding down, Carter told ''[[Us (magazine)|US magazine]]'': &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I never meant to be a sexual object for anyone but my husband. I never thought a picture of my body would be tacked up in men's bathrooms. I hate men looking at me and thinking what they think. And I know what they think. They write and tell me.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
She was referring to the feedback she had received for her poster as Wonder Woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=0AgdAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=5p4EAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3088,5446489&amp;dq=i-hate-men-looking-at-me&amp;hl=en |title= What People Are Saying |publisher= The Tuscaloosa News|accessdate=2010-10-21|date= 1980-02-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carter was also upset with some of the marketing of her image. [[Warner Bros.]] worked out a deal with the toy company [[Mego Corporation|Mego]] to create a Wonder Woman doll while the series was still on the air. In 1987, on ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show with Joan Rivers]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Fox Network. Air date: February 9, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; Carter commented:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I think that you're probably familiar with a problem in Hollywood, and that is that they market you, and they use you. They did a mask of my face and put it on the doll, and they put my name on for the first run of it. And then they took my name off and said they didn't have to pay me anymore. So it's the kind of thing that you can be used so much in this industry. I make nothing. I don't even make anything from the reruns. Don't ever settle for net profits. It's called ''[[Hollywood accounting|creative accounting]]''.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1985, DC Comics named Carter as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication ''[[Fifty Who Made DC Great]]'' for her work on the Wonder Woman series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic| writer = Marx, Barry| cowriters = [[Joey Cavalieri|Cavalieri, Joey]] and Hill, Thomas| artist = Petruccio, Steven | editor = Marx, Barry| story = Lynda Carter Wonder Woman Stars on TV| title = Fifty Who Made DC Great| date = 1985| publisher = DC Comics| page = 45| panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, toy company [[DC Direct]] released a 13&quot; full-figure statue of Lynda Carter as Wonder Woman, limited to 5,000 pieces;&lt;ref&gt;[http://experiencethewonder.com/statues_busts/Lynda_Carter_Official_Statue.php Product information page]&lt;/ref&gt; it was re-released in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dccomics.com/dcdirect/?dcd=13499 DC Direct product page]&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2010, DC Direct began selling a 5Â½-inch [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Carter's rendition of Wonder Woman to celebrate the character's 75th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dccomics.com/dcdirect/?dcd=14432 DC Direct product page]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other credits===
During the late 1970s, she recorded an album, ''[[Portrait (Lynda Carter album)|Portrait]]''. Carter is credited as a co-writer on several songs, and she made numerous guest appearances on variety television programs at the time in a musical capacity. She also sang two of her songs in the 1979 ''Wonder Woman'' episode, &quot;Amazon Hot Wax&quot;.

In 1977, Carter released a promotional poster through [[Pro Arts Inc.]] at the suggestion of her then-husband and manager, [[Ron Samuels]]. The poster was very successful despite Carter's dissatisfaction with it. In 1981, during an interview on the [[NBC]] television special ''Women Who Rate a 10'', she said:&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;It's uncomfortable because I just simply took a photograph. That's all my participation was in my poster that sold over a million copies was that I took a photograph that I thought was a dumb photograph. My husband said, 'Oh, try this thing tied up here, it'll look beautiful'. And the photographer said 'the back-lighting is really terrific'. So dealing with someone having that picture up in their... bedroom or their... living room or whatever I think would be hard for anyone to deal with.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;NBC Network. Air date: February 15, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the early 1980s, Carter performed on the [[Las Vegas Strip]] and in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]], highlighting her musical talent. 

Carter's other credits include the title role in a [[biopic]] of [[Rita Hayworth]], titled ''Rita Hayworth, Love Goddess'' (1983) and a variety of her own TV specials: ''Lynda Carter's Special'' (1980), ''Encore!'' (1980), ''Celebration'' (1981), ''Street Life'' (1982), and ''Body And Soul'' (1984). She starred in a few short-lived TV series, including ''Partners in Crime'' (1984) with [[Loni Anderson]] and ''[[Hawkeye (TV series)|Hawkeye]]'' (1994â95) with [[Lee Horsley]]. During this time, she also became a celebrity promotional model for [[Maybelline]] cosmetics commercials.

Throughout the 1990s, Carter appeared in a string of [[Television movie|tv movie]]s that resulted in a resurgence in television appearances. Also, because of the re-syndication of ''Wonder Woman'' on such cable networks as [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] and [[SyFy]], Carter even participated in two scheduled on-line chat sessions with fans.&lt;ref&gt;Lens Express Chat: November 8th, 1999; PlanetRx Chat: February 3, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; It was around this time that Carter created her own production company, Potomac Productions. Throughout the 1990s, she has also appeared in commercials for [[Lens Express]] (now [[1-800 Contacts]]).

In 2001, Carter was cast in the independent comedy feature ''[[Super Troopers]]'' as Vermont Governor Jessman. The writers and stars of the film, the comedy troupe ''[[Broken Lizard]]'', with [[Jay Chandrasekhar]] directing, had specifically sought Carter for the role. Inspired by the character detour from her usual roles, she agreed to play a washed-up former beauty queen in ''[[The Creature of the Sunny Side Up Trailer Park]]'' (2004), directed by [[Christopher Coppola]]. Carter made her first appearance in a major feature film in a number of years in the big-screen remake of ''[[The Dukes of Hazzard (film)|The Dukes of Hazzard]]'' ([[2005 in film|2005]]), also directed by Chandrasekhar. She also appeared in the comedy ''[[Sky High (2005 film)|Sky High]]'' (2005) as &quot;Principal Powers&quot;, the head of a school for superheroes. The script allowed Carter to poke fun at her most famous character when she states: &quot;I can't do anything more to help you. I'm not Wonder Woman, y'know.&quot; In 2006, she guest-starred in the made-for-cable vampire film ''[[Slayer (film)|Slayer]]''. The following year, Lynda returned to the [[DC Comics]]' television world in the ''[[Smallville]]'' episode &quot;[[wikia:Smallville:Progeny|Progeny]]&quot; (2007) playing [[Chloe Sullivan]]'s [[Kryptonite]]-empowered mother.

Carter has also done [[voiceover]]s for video games, performing voices for the [[Races of The Elder Scrolls#Nord|nord]] and [[Races of The Elder Scrolls#Orsimer|orsimer]] (orc) females in three computer games of ''[[The Elder Scrolls]]'' series, ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind]]'', ''[[The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion]]'' and ''[[The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim]]''. These games were developed by [[Bethesda Softworks]]; her husband, businessman [[Robert A. Altman]], is Chairman and [[Chief Executive Officer|CEO]] of Bethesda's parent company, [[ZeniMax Media]].

From September to November  2005, Carter played Mama Morton in the [[West End theatre|West End London]] production of ''[[Chicago (musical)|Chicago]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title=The British Theater Guide
  | url=http://www.britishtheatreguide.info/news/N180905.htm
  | accessdate=2006-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, her rendition of &quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot; was officially released on the ''Chicago: 10th Anniversary Edition'' CD box set. In May 2007, Carter began touring the U.S. with her one-woman musical cabaret show, ''An Evening with Lynda Carter''. She has played engagements at such venues as Feinstein's At Loews Regency in New York, Jazz at Lincoln Center, and The Kennedy Center in Washington, DC. In June 2009, her second album, &quot;At Last&quot;, was released and reached #10 on ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'''s Jazz Albums Chart.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.billboard.com/column-chartbeat/chart-beat-the-black-eyed-peas-lynda-carter-1003985729.story#/column-chartbeat/chart-beat-the-black-eyed-peas-lynda-carter-1003985729.story Chart Beat: The Black Eyed Peas, Lynda Carter, Paulina Rubio]&lt;/ref&gt;.  
[[Image:Crazy Little Things Album Cover.jpg|thumb|200px|right|.]]
In June of 2011, Carter released her third album, &quot;Crazy Little Things&quot;, which she describes as  delightful mix of standards, country, and pop tunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Personal life==
Carter has been married twice. Her first marriage was to her former [[talent agent]] [[Ron Samuels]] from 1977 to 1982. In January 1984, Carter married [[Washington, D.C.]], [[Attorney at law|attorney]] [[Robert A. Altman]], law partner of [[Clark Clifford]] (and now CEO of ZeniMax Media). The Altmans have two children, James (born 1988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Wonder Woman becomes a mom|newspaper= The Globe &amp; Mail|publisher= The Globe &amp; Mail|location= Toronto|issn= 03190714|date= 1988-1-16|page= C.12|accessdate= 2011-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Jessica (born 1990&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Hurt in heaven with special jet|newspaper= The Province|publisher= CanWest Digital Media|location= Vancouver, B.C.| page= 14|accessdate= 2011-09-23|quote= NEW WONDERBABY: Lynda Carter, who starred in the Wonder Woman TV series in the 1970s, gave birth Sunday to her second child, Jessica.}}&lt;/ref&gt;),&lt;ref name=&quot;lifetime&quot;/&gt; and live in [[Potomac, Maryland]].

In 1992, after a lengthy and highly publicized [[jury]] trial stemming from his involvement with the [[Bank of Credit and Commerce International|BCCI]], Carter's husband was [[acquittal|acquitted]]. Carter was seen on the [[TV news]] with her arm around him, shouting, &quot;Not guilty! Not guilty!&quot; to the gathered reporters.

In 2003 Lynda revealed that her mother had suffered with [[Irritable bowel syndrome|IBS]] for over 30 years. Carter used her celebrity to spotlight the condition, touring the country as an advocate and spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/health/spotlighthealth/2003-01-17-lynda-carter-ibs_x.htm USA Today article]&lt;/ref&gt; Lynda is also a staunch advocate and supporter of [[Susan G.

In early June 2008, while rowing out of the Potomac Boat Club, Carter spotted a body floating in the [[Potomac River]]. She called out to some fishermen and waited for the police to arrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Wonder Woman finds body floating in river|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/07/wonder.woman.body.ap/index.html|publisher=CNN.com|accessdate=2008-06-08 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080607235433/http://edition.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/07/wonder.woman.body.ap/index.html |archivedate = June 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, she admitted in an interview to ''[[People magazine|People]]'' magazine that she had entered a [[drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation clinic]] for treatment of [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Wonder Woman Lynda Carter: 'I'm an Alcoholic' '|url=http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20210555,00.html|publisher=www.people.com|accessdate=2008-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
