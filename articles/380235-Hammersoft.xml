The '''''Flying Cloud''''' was a [[clipper|clipper ship]] that set the world's sailing record for the fastest passage between New York and San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours. She held this record for over 100 years, from 1854-1989.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruzelius1&quot; /&gt; 

''Flying Cloud'' was the most famous of the clippers built by [[Donald McKay]]. She was known for her extremely close race with the ''Hornet'' in 1853, for having a woman navigator, Eleanor Creesy, wife of Josiah Perkins Creesy who skippered the ''Flying Cloud'' on two record-setting voyages from New York to San Francisco, and for sailing in the Australia and timber trades.

==Construction==
[[File:Flyingcloudlines.jpg|thumb|left|Lines of ''Flying Cloud'']]
''Flying Cloud'' is popularly called an [[extreme clipper]], as are many of Donald McKay's ships, but as her dead rise was less than 40&quot; she was not. Donald McKay built many fast clipper ships but only one, the ''[[Stag Hound]]'' was an extreme clipper, even if others may have been advertised as such. It was popular to advertise clippers as &quot;extreme&quot; because of the popular conception of speed.

''Flying Cloud'' was built in [[East Boston, Massachusetts]], and intended for [[Enoch Train]] of [[Boston]], who paid $50,000 for her construction. While still under construction,she was purchased by [[Grinnell, Minturn &amp; Co|Grinnell, Minturn &amp; Co.]], of New York, for $90,000, which represented a huge profit for Train &amp; Co.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The Clipper ''Flying Cloud''&quot;, ''Era of the Clipper Ships'' (mirrored [http://www.myc.org/Boats/club/flying_cloud.htm here].&lt;/ref&gt;

A reporter for the Boston ''Daily Atlas'' of April 25, 1851 wrote, &quot;If great length [235 ft.], sharpness of ends, with proportionate breadth [41 ft.] and depth, conduce to speed, the ''Flying Cloud'' must be uncommonly swift, for in all these she is great. Her length on the [[keel]] is 208 feet, on deck 225, and over all, from the knightheads to the [[taffrail]], 235â extreme breadth of [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] 41 feet, depth of hold 21Â½, including 7 feet 8 inches height of between-decks, sea-rise at half floor 20 inches, rounding of sides 6 inches, and sheer about 3 feet.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

==World record voyage to San Francisco during Gold Rush==
Within six weeks of launch ''Flying Cloud'' sailed from New York and made San Francisco 'round [[Cape Horn]] in 89 days, 21 hours under the command of Captain [[Josiah Perkins Creesy]]. On July 31, during the trip, she made 374 miles in 3 days. In 1853 she beat her own record by 13 hours, a record that stood until 1989 when the breakthrough-designed sailboat ''[[Thursday's Child (racing yacht)|Thursday's Child]]'' completed the passage in 80 days, 20 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

&lt;/ref&gt;
The record was once again broken in 2008 by the French racing yacht ''[[Gitana 13]]'', with a time of 43 days and 38 minutes.

In the early days of the [[California Gold Rush]], it took more than 200 days for a ship to travel from New York to San Francisco, a voyage of more than 16,000 miles.  The ''Flying Cloud'''s better-than-halving that time (only 89 days) was a headline-grabbing world record that the ship itself beat three years later, setting a record that lasted for 136 years.
[[File:California Clipper 500.jpg|thumb|[[Clipper ship]]s were in great demand during the [[California gold rush]]]]

===''Flying Cloud'' vs. ''Andrew Jackson''===
In newspaper accounts of the day, the clipper ''Andrew Jackson'' was acclaimed as holding the record passage to San Francisco. After careful scrutiny of the logbooks, Cutler concludes that a case can be made for either ''Flying Cloud'' or ''Andrew Jackson'' holding the record. 

''Andrew Jackson'' holds the record for fastest passage pilot-to-pilot, arriving at the San Francisco pilot grounds in 89 days and 4 hours. Because ''Andrew Jackson'' spent all night between the [[Farallon Islands|Farrallones]] and the [[Golden Gate]] awaiting a harbor pilot, some will consider this figure as the appropriate indicator of fastest sailing performance around [[Cape Horn]].  

However, the ''Flying Cloud'' holds the record time for a completed voyage from New York to San Francisco, 89 days 8 hours anchor-to-anchor.&lt;ref name = &quot;cutler&quot;&gt;

==Woman navigator==
The ''Flying Cloud'''s achievement was remarkable under any terms. But, writes David W. Shaw,&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, David W. (2000) ''Flying Cloud, the True Story of America's Most Famous Clipper Ship and the Woman Who Guided Her''. New York: William Morrow ISBN 0-688-16793-4&lt;/ref&gt; it was all the more unusual because its navigator was a woman, [[Eleanor Creesy]], who had been studying oceanic currents, weather phenomena, and astronomy since her girlhood in [[Marblehead, Massachusetts]]. She was one of the first navigators to exploit the insights of [[Matthew Fontaine Maury]], most notably the course recommended in his ''Sailing Directions''. With her husband, ship captain Josiah Perkins Cressy, she logged many thousands of miles on the ocean, traveling around the world carrying passengers and goods. In the wake of their record-setting transit from New York to California, Eleanor and Josiah became instant celebrities. But their fame was short-lived and their story quickly forgotten. Josiah died in 1871 and Eleanor lived far from the sea until her death in 1900.

==Race with clipper ''Hornet'' in 1853==
''[[Hornet (clipper)|Hornet]]'' had a two day head start on the ''Flying Cloud'' in their famous 1853 race. She left New York for San Francisco, April 26, 1853, with the ''Flying Cloud'' departing two days later.

After the roughly 15,000 mile voyage around [[Cape Horn]], both ships arrived in San Francisco harbor 106 days later at almost the same time, with ''Hornet'' sailing in just 45 minutes ahead of the ''Flying Cloud''.&lt;ref name = &quot;bruzelius&quot;&gt;

==British clipper to Australia and New Zealand, New Brunswick timber trade==
[[File:Flyingcloudclipper.jpg|300px|thumb|left|'''''Flying Cloud''''']]
In 1862, Flying Cloud was sold to the [[Black Ball Line (trans-Atlantic packet)|Black Ball Line]], Liverpool, sailing under British colors without change of name, and was soon traveling between the mother country and Australia and New Zealand. Her latter years were spent in the log trade between Newcastle upon Tyne, England, and Saint John, New Brunswick, Canada.

==Loss of the ship==
On June 19, 1874 the ''Flying Cloud'' went ashore on the Beacon Island bar, [[Saint John, New Brunswick]], and was condemned and sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stephens-kenau.com/flying_cloud-product-view-8.html|title=Flying Cloud|last=Hough|first=Izak J. H.|publisher=Model Shipyard (The)|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following June she was burned for the scrap metal value of her [[copper]] and iron fastenings.&lt;ref name=&quot;NMAH&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://historywired.si.edu/object.cfm?ID=546|title=Flying Cloud Clipper Ship|publisher=National Museum of American History, Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=2008-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ballad==
A well-known ballad about a ship named ''Flying Cloud'' tells the story of an Irishman who was pressed into sailing on the ship on a slaving voyage from Baltimore via Bermuda to West Africa, which led to another voyage as a pirate ship that resulted in the execution of the crew at Newgate. However, these events are nothing to do with the actual history of the clipper ship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mudcat.org/@displaysong.cfm?SongID=6303|title=Flying Cloud|publisher=Mudcat|accessdate=20 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=537325|title=The Riddle of ''The Flying Cloud''|last=Beck|first=Horace P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laws K28. No historical basis known. Horace P. Beck, 'The Riddle of &quot;The Flying Cloud&quot;, ''Journal of American Folklore'', 66 (1953), pp. 123-33, is a thorough study of the ballad.&lt;/ref&gt;
