July 1, 2001
*A [[Habbush letter|handwritten message with this date]] purports to show a link between Al Qaeda and Iraq's Saddam Hussein government. The letter, purportedly from the head of Iraqi Intelligence to Saddam outines mission training which Mohammed Atta, one of the organizers of the September 11 attacks, has supposedly received in Iraq.  It also claims that Hussein accepted a shipment from Niger, presumably of uranium.

===February===
*The CIA sent former Ambassador [[Joseph C. Wilson|Joseph Wilson]] to investigate the yellowcake claims. He returned home and informed the CIA that the reports of yellowcake sales to Iraq were &quot;unequivocally wrong.&quot;  After the Bush administration repeatedly referenced the yellowcake claims as justification for war with Iraq, ambassador Wilson wrote a critical op-ed in ''The New York Times'' in which he explained the nature of the documents and the government's prior knowledge of their unreliability for use in a case for war.  Shortly after Wilson's op-ed, the identity of Wilson's wife, undercover CIA analyst [[Valerie Plame]], was revealed in a column by [[Robert Novak]], in apparent retribution for Wilson going public with doubts about the [[yellowcake forgery|yellowcake claims]].  It is a felony to reveal the identity of a CIA agent, yet no one has been convicted as a result of Novakâs column, though [[Lewis Libby|I. Lewis 'Scooter' Libby]], Dick Cheneyâs Chief of Staff, was convicted of perjury in the [[Plame affair|Plame leak]] investigation.

July 23, 2002
* A [[Downing Street memo|British government memo]] gives an overview of a secret meeting of United Kingdom Labour government, defense, and intelligence figures, who discuss the build-up to war in Iraq.  The head of [[MI6]], recently back from visiting Washington, is quoted as expressing the view that &quot;Bush wanted to remove Saddam, through military action, justified by the conjunction of terrorism and WMD. But the intelligence and facts were being fixed around the policy.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/election2005/article387390.ece &quot;The secret Downing Street memo,&quot;] ''The Sunday Times'', May 1, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

August 2002
* According to U.S. Intelligence, China, with help from France and [[Syria]], has secretly sold to [[Iraq]] the prohibited chemical [[Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]], or HTPB, which is used in making solid fuel for long-range missiles. France denies that the sale took place. U.S. intelligence traces the sale back to China's Qilu Chemicals company in Shandong province. The chemical sale involved a French company known as CIS Paris, which helped broker the sale of 20 tons of HTPB, which was then shipped from China to the Syrian port of Tartus. The chemicals were then shipped by truck from Syria to an Iraqi missile manufacturing plant.

* A letter from an Iraqi intelligence official urgently asks agents in Iraq to look for [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]] and another unnamed man. Two responses said, &quot;we found no information to confirm the presence of the above mentioned in our area of operation. Please review, we suggest circulating the contents of this message.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;translated letters linked as pdf files from [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi#Alleged links to Saddam Hussein]].

===September===

September 12, 2002
* US President [[George W. Bush]], addressing the UN General Assembly, challenges the UN to confront the &quot;grave and gathering danger&quot; of Iraq or stand aside as the United States and likeminded nations act. The UN Security Council begins discussion on drafting a new resolution to encourage Iraq to comply with the previous sixteen UN resolutions.

September 22, 2002
* The British government places [[September Dossier|a dossier]] before Parliament giving its intelligence assessment of Iraq's WMD capability.  The document alleges that Iraq possesses [[chemical weapons]] and [[biological weapons]], and has restarted its [[nuclear weapons]] program.  The document also asserts that Iraq has sought &quot;significant quantities of [[Niger uranium forgeries|uranium from Africa]]&quot;, and that some of the WMD would be ready within 45 minutes of an order to use them.  Claims later leaked in May 2003 that the dossier was &quot;sexed up&quot; under pressure from Downing Street will lead to a media furore, and the apparent suicide of weapons inspector [[David Kelly (weapons expert)|David Kelly]].

September 26, 2002
* Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]] accuses Iraq of harboring [[al Qaeda]] terrorists and aiding their quest for [[weapons of mass destruction]].
* The Bush administration says attempts by Iraq to acquire thousands of high-strength [[Iraqi aluminum tubes|aluminum tubes]] points to a clandestine program to make enriched uranium for nuclear bombs.  Indeed, [[Colin Powell]], in his address to the U.N. Security Council just prior to the war, made reference to the aluminum tubes.  But a report released by the [[Institute for Science and International Security]] in 2002 reported that it was highly unlikely that the tubes could be used to enrich uranium.  Powell later admitted he had presented an inaccurate case to the United Nations on Iraqi weapons, and that the intelligence presented was in some cases &quot;deliberately misleading.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A36348-2002Sep18 &quot;Evidence on Iraq Challenged,&quot;] Joby Warrick, ''The Washington Post'', Sept. 19, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/nation/transcripts/powelltext_020503.html Colin Powellâs speech to the UN], Feb 5, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/4992558/ '''Meet the Press,'''] NBC, May 16, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

* A few days before the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] vote on the [[Legality of the Iraq War#United States|Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution]], about 75 senators are told in [[closed session]] that [[Saddam Hussein]] has the means of delivering [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapons]] of mass destruction by [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) drones that could  be launched from ships off the Atlantic coast to attack [[East Coast of the United States|U.S. eastern seaboard cities]]. [[Colin Powell]] suggested in his presentation to the United Nations that UAVs were transported out of Iraq and could be launched against the U.S. In fact, Iraq had no fleet of UAVs nor any capability of putting UAVs on ships.&lt;ref&gt;Senator [[Bill Nelson]] (January 28, 2004) [http://www.fas.org/irp/congress/2004_cr/s012804b.html &quot;New Information on Iraq's Possession of Weapons of Mass Destruction&quot;,] ''Congressional Record''&lt;/ref&gt;  Iraq's UAV fleet consisted of less than a handful of outdated Czech training drones.&lt;ref&gt;Lowe, C.

November 13, 2002
* Iraq accepts U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441 and informs the UN that it will abide by the resolution.
* Weapons inspectors arrive in Baghdad again after a four-year absence.

===December===

December 7, 2002
* Iraq files a 12,000-page weapons declaration with the UN in order to meet requirements of resolution 1441. UN weapons inspectors, the UN security council and the U.S. feel that this declaration fails to account for all of Iraq's chemical and biological agents.
*Turkey moves approximately 15,000 soldiers to the border with Iraq
December 19, 2002
* UNMOVIC Chairman Hans Blix tells UNSC members that the Iraqi weapons declaration filed on December 7 &quot;is essentially a reorganized version&quot; of information Iraq provided UNSCOM in 1997, and that it &quot;is not enough to create confidence&quot; that Iraq has abandoned its WMD efforts.

===January===

January 2003
*Turkey invites at least five other regional countries to a &quot;'last-chance' meeting to avert a US-led war against Iraq.&quot;
*According to U.S. Intelligence, France has secretly sold prohibited spare parts to Iraq for its fighter jets and military helicopters.
January 18, 2003
* Global [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|protests against war on Iraq]] occur in cities around the world, including Tokyo, Moscow, Paris, London, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Cologne, Bonn, Goteborg, Istanbul, and Cairo. NION and ANSWER hold protests in Washington D.C. and San Francisco, California.
January 2003
* A statement released to various newspapers and signed by the leaders of [[United Kingdom|Britain]], Spain, Italy, Portugal, Hungary, Poland, Denmark and the Czech Republic shows support for the US, saying that Saddam should not be allowed to violate U.N. resolutions. The statement goes on to say that Saddam is a &quot;clear threat to world security,&quot; and urges Europe to unite with the United States to ensure that the Iraqi government is disarmed.
January 25, 2003
* An international group of volunteers leaves London, heading for Baghdad to act as human shields. Most will leave in March fearing that they would actually become human shields.
January 27, 2003
* Chairmen of the inspections effort report to the UN Security Council that, while Iraq has provided some access to facilities, concerns remain regarding undeclared material; inability to interview Iraqi scientists; inability to deploy aerial surveillance during inspections; and harassment of weapons inspectors.
January 31, 2003
* Tony Blair meets George Bush at the White House. In a [[Bush-Blair 2003 Iraq memo|memo written by Blair's chief foreign adviser]], Bush is paraphrased as saying: &quot;The start date for the military campaign was now pencilled in for March 10. This was when the bombing would begin.&quot;

===February===

February 5, 2003
* At the [[United Nations]] [[United States Secretary of State|US Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] presents the [[Government of the United States|US government]]'s case against the [[Saddam Hussein]] government of [[Iraq]], as part of the diplomatic side of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]]. The presentation includes tape recordings, [[satellite photography|satellite photograph]]s and other [[military intelligence|intelligence]] data, and aims to prove [[weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] production, evasion of [[disarmament of Iraq|weapons inspections]] and a link to [[Al-Qaida]].
February 7, 2003
* The chief [[United Nations]] arms inspector [[Hans Blix]] says [[Iraq]] appears to be making fresh efforts to cooperate with [[U.N.]] teams hunting [[weapons of mass destruction]], while Washington says the &quot;momentum is building&quot; for [[war]] with Iraq.
February 8, 2003
*  Sections of a [[Iraq Dossier|new 'dossier']] issued by the UK government, which purports to present the latest British intelligence about [[Iraq]], and which has been cited by [[Tony Blair]] and [[Colin Powell]] as evidence for the need for war, are criticized as plagiarisms.  Evidently they have been copied without permission from a number of sources including ''[[Jane's Intelligence Review]]'' and a 12-year-old doctoral thesis which was published in the US journal ''[[Middle East Review of International Affairs]]''. Some sentences appear copied word-for-word with even spelling mistakes being reproduced from the original articles. Downing Street responds by saying that the government had never claimed exclusive authorship and that the information was accurate.
February 10, 2003 
* France and Belgium break the [[NATO]] procedure of silent approval concerning the timing of protective measures for [[Turkey]] in case of a possible war with [[Iraq]]. Germany says it supports this veto. The procedure was put into operation on February 6 by secretary general [[George Robertson, Baron Robertson of Port Ellen|George Robertson]]. In response Turkey calls upon Article 4 of the NATO Treaty, which stipulates that member states must deliberate when asked to do so by another member state if it feels threatened.
February 12, 2003
* An audio tape attributed to [[Osama bin Laden]] is released by [[al Jazeera]] television. It recounts the battle of [[Tora Bora]] and urges Muslims to fight the United States and to overthrow the [[Iraq]] government of [[Saddam Hussein]].
February 13, 2003
*A [[UN]] panel reports that [[Iraq]]'s [[al-Samoud 2]] [[missile]]s, disclosed by Iraq to weapons inspectors in December, have a range of 180&amp;nbsp;km (above the 150&amp;nbsp;km limit allowed by the UN), splitting opinion over whether they breach [[UN Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSCR 1441]].
*Austria bars USA military units involved in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|attack on Iraq]] from entering into or flying over its territories without a [[UN]] mandate to attack [[Iraq]].
*The [[Washington Post]] claims that anonymous sources confirm that two [[Special Forces]] units have been operating on the ground inside [[Iraq]] for over a month, making preliminary preparations for a large-scale invasion.
February 14, 2003
*A very large demonstration is held in [[Melbourne]] to protest against the Australian government's support for the USA's policy on Iraq.  Organisers estimate that 200,000 people come out on to the streets, while some news sources put the number at &quot;up to 150,000&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://au.news.yahoo.com/030214/2/qcxe.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission|UNMOVIC]] chief weapons inspectors [[Hans Blix]] and [[Mohamed ElBaradei]] present their second report to the [[United Nations Security Council]].  They state that the Iraqis have been co-operating well with the inspectors and that no [[weapons of mass destruction]] have been found, but that the [[Saddam Hussein]] government had still to account for many banned weapons believed to have been in his arsenal. Mr Blix also expresses doubts about some of the conclusions in [[Colin Powell]]'s Security Council presentation of February 5, and specifically questions the significance of some of the photographic evidence that Mr Powell has presented.
February 15, 2003
* [[February 15, 2003 anti-war protest|Global protests against war on Iraq]]: People around the world demonstrate against the planning of war against [[Iraq]]. In Rome one million people take to the streets, in London one million. In Berlin there are half a million in the largest demonstration for some decades. There are also protest marches all over France as well as in many other smaller European cities. Protests are also held in South Africa, [[Syria]], India, Russia, Canada and in the USA, in around 600 cities in total.
February 18, 2003
* Hours before the first ships transporting heavy United States military equipment to [[Turkey]] were supposed to reach port, the Turkish government announces that it will withhold approval to dock unless the United States increases a reciprocal $6 billion foreign aid grant to $10 billion. The [[George W. Bush|Bush administration]] indicates that no substantial changes will be made to the proposed aid package.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A27320-2003Feb18.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
February 22, 2003
* Bush meets with the Spanish president, Aznar, to discuss the Security Council situation. According to a [[Bush-Aznar memo|leaked transcript of the meeting]], Bush was using foreign aid and trade agreements to put pressure on Security Council members to support US policy. The transcript also revealed that Saddam had offered to go into exile if he was allowed to keep $1 billion and information on weapons of mass destruction.
February 24, 2003
* Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] states at a meeting in Beijing that &quot;It is time to take action. The evidence is clear ... We are reaching that point where serious consequences must flow.&quot; His speech appears to imply that military action is likely to follow within three weeks, based on previous briefings from [[The Pentagon]].
February 25, 2003
* The United States, [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and Spain present to the [[UN Security Council]] a much-anticipated second resolution stating that Iraq &quot;has failed to take the final opportunity&quot; to disarm, but does not include deadlines or an explicit threat of military force.  Meanwhile, France, Germany, and Russia offer a counter-proposal calling for peaceful disarmament through further inspections.
* Both major parties of [[Kurdistan]], an autonomous region in Northern [[Iraq]], vow to fight [[Turkey|Turkish]] troops if they enter [[Kurdistan]] to capture [[Mosul]] or interfere in Kurdish self-rule.  Between them the two parties can mobilize up to 80,000 guerillas â most likely no match for the modern Turkish army, but a severe blow to the unity of U.S. allies on the Northern front expected in the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. plan to invade Iraq]].
February 26, 2003
* Hans Blix states that Iraq still has not made a &quot;fundamental decision&quot; to disarm, despite recent signs of increased cooperation. Specifically, Iraq has refused to destroy its [[al-Samoud 2]] long range [[missile]]s. (These are not a WMD, and Iraq is permitted &quot;battlefield&quot; missiles. However, Iraq's missiles were limited by UN instruction to a diameter of 600mm, and the Al-Samoud II has a diameter of 760mm). These missiles are deployed and mobile. Also, an [[R-400]] aerial bomb was found that could possibly contain biological agents. Given this find, the UN Inspectors have requested access to the [[Al-Aziziyah]] weapons range to verify that all 155 R-400 bombs can be accounted for and proven destroyed. Blix also expresses skepticism over Iraq's claims to have destroyed its stockpiles of anthrax and VX nerve agent in ''[[Time magazine]]''. Blix said he found it &quot;a bit odd&quot; that Iraq, with &quot;one of the best-organized regimes in the Arab world,&quot; would claim to have no records of the destruction of these illegal substances. &quot;I don't see that they have acquired any credibility,&quot; Blix said
* [[George W. Bush|George Bush]] commits publicly to a post-invasion democracy in Iraq, saying it will be &quot;an example&quot; to other nations in [[Arabia]]
* [[Tony Blair]] passes a motion in the [[British House of Commons]] supporting a new resolution at the [[UN Security Council]] and presumably authorizing a war (although the motion carefully avoids saying so).  120 [[Labour Party (UK)|UK Labour Party]] MPs dissent and vote against it â double the number who opposed the previous such motion â but the [[Conservative Party (UK)|UK Conservative Party]] backs the government's motion.
* [[Saddam Hussein]], in an interview with [[Dan Rather]], rules out exile as an option.
February 27, 2003
* [[UN]] [[Security Council]] meeting on Iraq ends without forming an agreement on timeline for further weapons inspections or future reports.
February 28, 2003
* Iraq is expected to begin the process of destroying Al Samoud two missiles on Saturday. [[Hans Blix]], U.N. chief weapons inspector says &quot;It is a very significant piece of real disarmament&quot;. However, White House spokesman Ari Fleischer declares that the Iraq commitment to destroying these missiles is a fraud that President [[George W. Bush]] had predicted, and indicates that the United States wants a total and complete disarmament of Iraq. He also repeats that if the United Nations does not act to disarm Baghdad, the United States will lead a coalition of voluntary countries to disarm Saddam Hussein.

===March===

March 1, 2003
*Under UN supervision, Iraq begins destroying four of its Al Samoud missiles.
*The [[Turkey|Turkish]] speaker of [[Parliament]] voids the vote accepting U.S. troops involved in the planned invasion of Iraq into Turkey on constitutional grounds. 264 votes for and 250 against accepting 62,000 US [[military]] personnel do not constitute the necessary majority under the Turkish constitution, due to 19 abstentions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21613-2003Mar1.html ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[United Arab Emirates]] calls for Iraqi president Saddam Hussein to step down to avoid war.  The sentiment is later echoed by [[Kuwait]].
*Many of the &quot;human shields&quot; begin to return to their home countries because the Iraqi government actually wanted to use them as human shields. The human shields that fled the country told reporters that the Iraqi government wanted them to sit at locations (power stations) that were quite likely to be bombed, not the hospitals they'd intended to defend. (The following year, at least one hospital was razed &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3988433.stm |title=US strikes raze Falluja hospital |publisher=BBC News |date=November 6, 2004 |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;).
March 2, 2003
*The country of [[Bahrain]] becomes the third Arab country to call for Iraqi president Saddam Hussein to step down. Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates had previously made similar announcements.
*''[[The Observer]]'' publishes what it claims is a leaked memo dated January 31, 2003 ordering members of the [[NSA]] to spy on UN Security Council members, focussing especially on members from [[Angola]], [[Cameroon]], [[Chile]], Mexico, [[Guinea]], and [[Pakistan]] to try to determine how they will vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.observer.co.uk/iraq/story/0,12239,905936,00.html |title=Revealed: US dirty tricks to win vote on Iraq war |publisher=The Observer |date=March 2, 2003 |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The memo's authenticity was questioned by many within the US, including pundit [[Matt Drudge]]. Drudge's critique was also cited by others, such as the [[Washington Times]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://washingtontimes.com/world/20030303-14680312.htm ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drudge pointed out that website's transcription of the memo contained several errors, namely a misspelling of the name of the memo's author (Kozu instead of Koza), a misspelling of the NSA's &quot;top secret&quot; stamp (with a &quot;1&quot; instead of an &quot;L&quot;), and several words written with a non-US spelling, as well as a date-stamp in the European format. ''The Observer'' said that it altered the memo to include British spellings so that its readers were not confused, but did not address the other inaccuracies. ''The Observer'' also corrected the spelling of the author's name on their website after the problem was pointed out, and stands by its story.  Wayne Madsen, who had been a communications security analyst with the NSA in the mid-1980s, has been quoted as saying that he believes the memo is authentic.  He speculates that the memo was directed at the security agencies of the other nations that constitute the [[Echelon]] network, namely Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom.  This news story was picked up by newspapers in Europe and Canada, but initially ignored by the American press. Additionally, a member or Britain's [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) was arrested in connection with the leaking of the memo.
*Iraq destroys six more Al Samoud missiles, bringing the total destroyed to 10 out of an estimated 100 missiles ordered eliminated by the UN.  The White House continues to dismiss Iraq's actions as &quot;part of its game of deception.&quot;  Iraq indicates that it may halt destruction of the missiles if the U.S. indicates it will go to war anyway.
*''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' reported  that military action against Iraq could begin as soon as March 13, hours after the UN is likely to vote on the proposed second resolution put forth by the United States, Britain, and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/article/0,,2-2003100298,00.html |title=It'll be soon, it'll be swift and it'll be short |publisher=The Sun |date=March 3, 2003 |accessdate=December 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
March 3, 2003
*Under intense American pressure, [[Turkey]] indicates that its [[Parliament]] will consider a second vote on whether to allow U.S. troops to use Turkish bases for a military attack on Iraq.
*Iraqi technicians use bulldozers to crush six more of the banned Al-Samoud 2 missiles, bringing to 16 the number destroyed in three days.
March 4, 2003
*Iraq destroys three more Al Samoud 2 missiles, bringing to 19 the number Baghdad has crushed out of 100 ordered destroyed by the UN.  Iraq also destroys a launcher and five engines in a rush to prove it is disarming before a crucial U.N. report on March 7.  UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan calls the new actions &quot;a positive development&quot; while the White House remains unconvinced saying, &quot;Despite whatever limited head-fakes Iraq has engaged in, they continue to fundamentally not disarm.&quot;
March 5, 2003
*[[Pope John Paul II]] calls on Catholics to commemorate Ash Wednesday by fasting and praying for peace.  He sends an envoy, Cardinal Pio Laghi, to President Bush, to urge him not to go to war.   Laghi tells Bush that the Pope believes that a war would be a &quot;defeat for humanity&quot; and would be neither morally nor legally justified.
* Two days before his scheduled update to the United Nations on Iraqi cooperation with inspection, Hans Blix credits Iraq with &quot;a great deal more of cooperation now&quot;, although still expressing some skepticism as to whether or not the cooperation would continue.  Among the examples of cooperation that he cites are Iraq's destruction of Samoud 2 missiles, which he calls &quot;the most spectacular and the most important and tangible&quot;.  He adds that &quot;here weapons that can be used in war are being destroyed in fairly large quantities.&quot;  In general, he states, &quot;you have a greater measure of cooperation on interviews in general.&quot; These statements help to harden the opposition to the US-led war by several other Security Council members. (It was later found that Blix had found and destroyed almost the only illegal weapons in Iraq â and they were not WMD).
* Secretary of State [[Colin Powell]] says that US intelligence has indicated that Hussein has ordered the production of more Al Samoud 2 missiles parts and engines. The Iraqi government does not deny the claim but simply says once again that they considered the missiles to be legal.  Powell also points out that Iraq has delivered &quot;some documents that have not been found before&quot;
*  Iraq destroys nine more Al Samoud 2 missiles, bringing to 28 the total number of missiles scrapped.
March 6, 2003
*United States intelligence reports that the Iraqi government has ordered US military uniforms with plans of carrying out attacks on Iraqi citizens which would then be blamed on US soldiers. (Reuters) &lt;ref&gt;[http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story2&amp;cid=564&amp;e=3&amp;u=/nm/20030306/ts_nm/iraq_usa_uniforms_dc ]{{dead link|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Iraqi exiles testify in Washington about the brutal crimes committed against Iraqi citizens by the Hussein government. One Iraqi woman says that the Iraqi people are &quot;patiently waiting&quot; for the US to liberate the country.
