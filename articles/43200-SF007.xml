'''Nemertea''' is a [[phylum]] of [[invertebrate]] [[animal]]s also known as &quot;ribbon worms&quot; or &quot;proboscis worms&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;ITIS&quot;&gt;{{ITIS |id=57411 |taxon=Nemertea |accessdate=February 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternative names for the phylum have included '''Nemertini''', '''Nemertinea''' and '''Rhynchocoela'''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Scott&quot; /&gt; Although most are less than {{convert|20|cm|in}} long, one specimen has been estimated at {{convert|54|m|ft}}, which would make it the longest animal ever found.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; Most are very slim, usually only a few millimeters wide, although a few have relatively short but wide bodies. Many have patterns of yellow, orange, red and green coloration.

&lt;!--
Under the skin are usually at least three layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The mouth is [[ventral]] and a little behind the front of the body.
--&gt;
The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body, the [[anus]] is at the tip of the tail, and the mouth is under the front. A little above the gut is the [[rhynchocoel]], a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. All species have a [[proboscis]] which lies in the rhynchocoel when inactive but [[wikt:eversion|everts]] (turns inside-out) to emerge just above the mouth and capture the animal's prey with poisons. A very stretchy muscle in the back of the rhynchocoel pulls the proboscis in when an attack ends. A few species with stubby bodies [[Filter feeders|filter feed]] and have suckers at the front and back ends, with which they attach to a [[Host (biology)|host]].

The brain is a ring of four [[ganglia]], positioned around the rhynchocoel near its front end. At least a pair of [[ventral nerve cord]]s connect to the brain and run along the length of the body. Most nemerteans have various [[chemoreceptors]], and on their heads some species have a number of pigment-cup [[ocelli]], which can detect light but not form an image. Nemerteans [[Respiration (physiology)|respire]] through the skin. They have at least two [[Lateral (anatomy)|lateral]] vessels which are joined at the ends to form a loop, and these and the rhynchocoel are filled with fluid. There is no heart, and the flow of fluid depends on contraction of muscles in the vessels and the body wall. To filter out soluble waste products, [[flame cell]]s are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels, and remove the wastes through a network of pipes to the outside.

All nemerteans move slowly, using their external [[cilia]] to glide on surfaces on a trail of [[Mucus|slime]], while larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some swim by [[Anatomical_terms_of_location#Directional_terms|dorso-ventral]] undulations. A few live in the open ocean while the rest find or make hiding places on the bottom. About a dozen species inhabit freshwater, mainly in the tropics and subtropics, and another dozen species live on land in cool, damp places. Most nemerteans are [[carnivores]], feeding on [[annelid]]s, [[clam]]s and [[crustacean]]s. A few species are [[scavenger]]s, and a few species live [[commensal]]ly inside the [[Mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] cavity of [[mollusc]]s. Some species have devastated commercial fishing of clams and crabs. Nemerteans have few predators. Two species are sold as fish bait.

In most species the sexes are separate, but all the freshwater species are [[hermaphroditic]]. Nemerteans often have numerous temporary [[gonad]]s ([[ovary|ovaries]] or [[testes]]), and build temporary gonoducts (ducts from which the ova or sperm are emitted), one per gonad, when the ova and sperm are ready. The eggs are generally fertilised externally. Some species shed them into the water, and others protect their eggs in various ways. The fertilized egg divides by [[spiral cleavage]] and grows by [[determinate development]], in which the fate of a cell can usually be predicted from its predecessors in the process of division. The embryos of most [[taxon|taxa]] develop either directly to form juveniles (like the adult but smaller) or to form [[planula|planuliform]] larvae, in which the larva's long axis is the same as the juvenile's. However, some form a [[pilidium]] larva, in which the developing juvenile has a gut which lies across the larva's body, and usually eats the remains of the larva when it emerges. The bodies of some species fragment readily, and even parts near the tail can grow full bodies. 

It has been suggested that three [[fossil]] species may be nemerteans, but none is confirmed. Traditional [[taxonomy]] divides the phylum in two [[Class (biology)|classes]], [[Anopla]] (&quot;unarmed&quot; â their probosces do not have a little dagger) with two [[Order (biology)|orders]], and [[Enopla]] (&quot;armed&quot; with a dagger) with two orders. However, it is now accepted that Anopla are [[polyphyletic]] (combine two or more separate groups), as one order is more closely related to Enopla than to the other order of Anopla. The phylum Nemertea is [[monophyletic]], whose [[synapomorphy|synapomorphies]] include the rhynchocoel and eversible proboscis. Traditional taxonomy says that nemerteans are closely related to [[flatworm]]s and that both are relatively &quot;primitive&quot; [[acoelomate]]s. Now both phyla are regarded as members of the [[Lophotrochozoa]], a very large &quot;super-phylum&quot; that also includes [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]]s, [[brachiopod]]s, [[bryozoa]] and many other [[protostome]]s.

==History==

[[File:Nemertea Basiodiscus mexicanus.png|right|thumb|250px|''Basiodiscus mexicanus'' at Los Arcos, near Puerto Vallarta, Mexico]]In 1555 [[Olaus Magnus]] wrote of a marine worm which was apparently {{convert|17.76|m|ft}} long (&quot;40 cubits&quot;), about the width of a child's arm, and whose touch made a hand swell. [[William Borlase]] wrote in 1758 of a &quot;sea long worm&quot;, and in 1770 [[Johan Ernst Gunnerus|Gunnerus]] wrote a formal description of this animal, which he called ''Ascaris longissima''. Its current name, ''[[Lineus longissimus]]'', was first used in 1806 by Sowerby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cedhagen|first=Tomas|coauthors=Per Sundberg|year=1986|title=A previously unrecognized report of a nemertean in the literature|journal=[[Archives of Natural History]] |publisher=Edinburgh University Press|volume=13|pages=7â8|issn=0260-9541|doi=10.3366/anh.1986.13.1.7|url=http://www.euppublishing.com/doi/abs/10.3366/anh.1986.13.1.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, a total of 1,149 species had been described and grouped into 250 genera.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;&gt;{{cite journal |author=R.

The outermost layer of the body has no [[cuticle]] but consists of a [[cilia]]ted and [[gland]]ular [[epithelium]] containing [[rhabdite]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; which form the [[mucus]] in which the cilia glide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Gary G.|year=1978|title=A new function of rhabdites: mucus production for ciliary gliding |journal=[[Zoomorphology]] |publisher=[[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]] |volume=91|issue=3|pages=235â248|doi=10.1007/BF00999813|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n42771510846j53l/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each ciliated cell has many cilia and [[microvilli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; The outermost layer rests on a thickened [[basement membrane]], the [[dermis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; Next to the dermis are at least three layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; The combinations of muscle types vary between the different [[Class (biology)|classes]], but these are not associated with differences in movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which flatten the animals, especially in the larger species.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is [[mesenchyme]], a kind of [[connective tissue]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; In [[pelagic zone|pelagic]] species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt;

The mouth is ventral and a little behind the front of the body. The foregut, stomach and intestine run a little below the midline of the body and the [[anus]] is at the tip of the tail.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NutritionDigestive&quot;&gt;{{cite book
| author=Ruppert, E.E., Fox, R.S., and Barnes, R.D. | title=Invertebrate Zoology | chapter=Nemertea | pages=274â275 | publisher=Brooks / Cole | edition=7 | isbn=0030259827 | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Above the gut and separated from the gut by mesenchyme is the [[rhynchocoel]], a cavity which mostly runs above the midline and ends a little short of the rear of the body. The rhynchocoel of class [[Anopla]] has an orifice a little to the front of the mouth, but still under the front of the body. In the other class, [[Enopla]], the mouth and the front of the rhynchocoel share an orifice.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; The rhynchocoel is a [[coelom]], as it is lined by [[epithelium]].&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt;

=== Proboscis and feeding ===

The [[proboscis]] is an infolding of the body wall, and sits in the rhynchocoel when inactive.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; When muscles in the wall of the rhynchocoel compress the fluid in the rhynchocoel, the pressure makes the proboscis jump inside-out to attack the animal's prey along a canal called the rhynchodeum and through an orifice, the proboscis pore. The proboscis has a muscle which attaches to the back of the rhynchocoel, and which can stretch up to 30 times its inactive length and then retract the proboscis.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt;

The proboscis of the [[Class (biology)|class]] [[Anopla]] (&quot;unarmed&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004Diversity&quot; /&gt;) exits from an orifice which is separate from the mouth,&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; coils around the prey and immobilizes it by sticky, toxic secretions.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NutritionDigestive&quot; /&gt; The Anopla can attack as soon as they move into the range of the proboscis.&lt;ref name=&quot;McDermottRoe1985&quot; /&gt; Some Anopla have branched probosces which Ruppert, Fox and Barnes describe as &quot;a mass of sticky spaghetti&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; The animal then draws its prey into its mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt;

[[Image:Amphiporus ochraceus stylet region.jpg|Stylet-containing part of proboscis of &quot;armed&quot; nemertean ''Amphiporus ochraceus''.|245px|right|thumb]]
In most of the class [[Enopla]] (&quot;armed&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004Diversity&quot; /&gt;), the proboscis exits from a common orifice of the rhynchocoel and mouth. A typical member of this class has a [[Stylet (anatomy)|stylet]], a [[calcareous]] barb,&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; with which the animal stabs the prey many times to inject toxins and digestive secretions. The prey is then swallowed whole or, after partial digestion, its tissues are sucked into the mouth.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NutritionDigestive&quot; /&gt; The stylet is attached about one-third of distance from the end of the [[wikt:eversion|evert]]ed proboscis, which extends only enough to expose the stylet. On either side of the active stylet are sacs containing back-up stylets to replace the active one as the animal grows or an active one is lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; Instead of one stylet, the [[Polystilifera]] have a pad that bears many tiny stylets, and these animals have separate orifices for the proboscis and mouth, unlike other Enopla.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004Diversity&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Roe|first1=Pamela |last2=Norenburg|first2=Jon L. |last3=Maslakova|first3=Svetlana |editor=Sol Felty Light, James T.

=== Respiration and circulatory system ===
Nemerteans lack specialized [[gills]], and respiration occurs over the surface of the body, which is long and sometimes flattened. Like other animals with thick body walls, they use fluid [[Circulatory system|circulation]] rather than [[diffusion]] to move substances through their bodies. The circulatory system consists of the rhynchocoel and peripheral vessels,&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004RespirationCirculatoryExcretion&quot; /&gt; while blood of other invertebrates is contained in the main body cavity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Moore&quot; /&gt; The fluid in the rhynchocoel moves substances to and from the proboscis, and functions as a fluid [[skeleton]] in everting the proboscis and in burrowing. The vessels circulate fluid round the whole body and the rhynchocoel provides it own local circulation.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004RespirationCirculatoryExcretion&quot;&gt;{{cite book

In the simplest type of circulatory system, two lateral vessels are joined at the ends to form a loop. However, many species have additional long-wise and cross-wise vessels. There is no heart nor pumping vessels,&lt;ref name=&quot;Anderson1998InvertebratePhyla&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=D.T.|editor=D.T.

[[image:Flamecell.jpg|thumb|right|A schematic representation of a [[flame cell]] and other associated structures]]
Nemertea use organs called [[protonephridia]]&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004RespirationCirculatoryExcretion&quot; /&gt; to excrete soluble waste products, especially [[nitrogen]]ous by-products of cellular [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004BilateriaExcrete&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nemertean protonephridia, [[flame cell]]s which filter out the wastes are embedded in the front part of the two lateral fluid vessels. The flame cells remove the wastes into two collecting ducts, one on either side, and each duct has one or more [[nephridiopore]]s through which the wastes exit. Semiterrestrial and freshwater nemerteans have many more flame cells than marines, sometimes thousands. The reason may be that [[osmoregulation]] is more difficult in non-marine environments.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004RespirationCirculatoryExcretion&quot; /&gt;

=== Nervous system and senses ===

[[Image:Amphiporus ochraceus brain.jpg|245px|Brain and neural cords of hoplonemertean ''Amphiporus ochraceus''. Several clusters of dark eyespots and the opening of one cerebral organ are also visible.|thumb]]

The [[central nervous system]] consists of a [[brain]] and paired [[ventral nerve cord]]s that connect to the brain and run along the length of the body. The brain is a ring of four [[ganglia]], masses of nerve cells, positioned round the rhynchocoel near its front end&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NervousSenses&quot; /&gt; â while the brains of most [[protostome]] invertebrates encircle the foregut.&lt;ref name=&quot;Maslakova2010Invention&quot; /&gt; Most nemertean species have just one pair of nerve cords, many species have additional paired cords, and some species also have a dorsal cord.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NervousSenses&quot; /&gt; In some species the cords lie within the skin, but in most they are deeper, inside the muscle layers.&lt;ref name=IZ/&gt; The central nervous system is often red or pink because it contains [[hemoglobin]]. This stores [[oxygen]] for peak activity or when the animal experiences [[Hypoxia (medical)|anoxia]], for example while [[burrowing]] in oxygen-free [[sediment]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NervousSenses&quot;&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some species have paired [[cerebrum|cerebral]] organs, sacs whose only only openings are to the outside. Others species have unpaired evertible organs on the front of their heads. Some have slits along the side of the head or grooves obliquely across the head, and these may be associated with paired cerebral organs. All of these are thought to be [[chemoreceptor]]s, and the cerebral organs may also aiding [[osmoregulation]]. Small pits in the epidermis appear to be sensors.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NervousSenses&quot; /&gt; On their head some species have a number of pigment-cup [[ocelli]],&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NervousSenses&quot; /&gt; which can detect light but not form an image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Peter J. |last2=Wolfe|first2=Stephen L. |last3=Hertz|first3=Paul E. |coauthors=Cecie Starr|title=Biology: the dynamic science|volume=3|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9780495010340|pages=894â895|chapter=Photoreceptors and vision | url=http://books.google.com/?id=VqkrMPg6E7EC&amp;pg=PA894&amp;lpg=PA894&amp;dq=Russell,+Peter+J.;+Wolfe,+Stephen+L.;+Hertz,+Paul+E.;+Cecie+Starr+pigment-cup+ocelli#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate=31 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most nemerteans have two to six ocelli, although some have hundreds.&lt;ref name=IZ&gt;{{cite book |author= Barnes, Robert D. |year=1982 |title= Invertebrate Zoology |publisher= Holt-Saunders International |location= Philadelphia, PA|pages= 252â262|isbn= 0-03-056747-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few tiny species that live between grains of sand have [[statocyst]]s,&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004NervousSenses&quot; /&gt; which sense balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=Peter J. |last2=Wolfe|first2=Stephen L. |last3=Hertz|first3=Paul E. |coauthors=Cecie Starr|title=Biology: the dynamic science|volume=3|year=2008|publisher=Cengage Learning |isbn=9780495010340|page=889|chapter=Photoreceptors and vision | url=http://books.google.com/?id=VqkrMPg6E7EC&amp;pg=PA894&amp;lpg=PA894&amp;dq=Russell,+Peter+J.;+Wolfe,+Stephen+L.;+Hertz,+Paul+E.;+Cecie+Starr+pigment-cup+ocelli#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | accessdate=31 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Movement ===
[[File:Lineus longissimus Grevelingen.jpg|200px|thumb|right|''Lineus longissimus'' in [[Grevelingen]]]]
All nemerteans move slowly.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; Most nemerteans use their external cilia to glide on surfaces on a trail of [[Mucus|slime]], some of which is produced by glands in the head. Larger species use muscular waves to crawl, and some aquatic species swim by dorso-ventral undulations. Some species burrow by means of muscular [[peristalsis]], and have powerful muscles.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; Some species of the [[Order (biology)|suborder]] [[Monostilifera]], whose proboscis have one active stylet, move by extending the proboscis, sticking it to an object and pulling the animal towards the object.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004Diversity&quot; /&gt;

Most nemerteans are marine animals that burrow in sediments, lurk in crevices between shells, stones or the [[holdfasts]] of [[algae]] or [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] animals. Some live deep in the open oceans, and have gelatinous bodies. Others build semi-permanent burrows lined with [[mucus]] or produce [[cellophane]]-like tubes. Mainly in the tropics and subtropics, about 12 species appear in freshwater,&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FormBodyProboscis&quot; /&gt; and about a dozen species live on land in cool, damp places, for example under rotting logs.&lt;ref name=&quot;MooreOverhill2006&quot; /&gt;

The terrestrial ''Argonemertes dendyi'' is a native of [[Australia]] but has been found in the [[British Isles]], in [[SÃ£o Miguel Island|Sao Miguel]] in the [[Azores]], in [[Gran Canaria]], and in a [[lava]] tube cave at [[Kaumana]] on the [[Hawaii (island)|Island of Hawaii]]. It can build a cocoon, which allows it to avoid desiccation while being transported, and it may be able to build populations quickly in new areas as it is a [[protandrous]] [[hermaphrodite]], in other words each individual starts as a male but later becomes a female.&lt;ref name=&quot;HowarthMoore1983&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howarth|first=Francis G.|coauthors=Janet Moore|year=1983|title=The land nemertine ''Argonemertes dendyi'' (Dakin) in Hawaii (Nemertinea: Hoplonemertinea: Prosorhochmidae) |journal=[[Pacific Science]] |publisher=University of Hawaii Press|volume=37|issue=2|pages=141â144|url=http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/10125/654/1/v37n2-141-144.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another terrestrial [[genus]], ''[[Geonemertes]]'', is mostly found in [[Australasia]] but has species in the [[Seychelles]], widely across the [[Indo-Pacific]], in [[Tristan da Cunha]] in the South Atlantic, in [[Frankfurt]], in the [[Canary Islands]], in [[Madeira]] and in the Azores.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gibson&quot;/&gt;

=== Fossil record ===
&lt;!-- No fossil nermeteans were known in late 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;WalkerAnderson1998Nemertea&quot; /&gt; --&gt;
Although one might expect stylets to be fossilized since they are made of the mineral [[calcium phosphate]], none have been found.

The [[Middle Cambrian#Subdivisions|Middle Cambrian]] fossil ''[[Amiskwia]]'' from the [[Burgess Shale]] has been classed as a nemertean, based on a resemblance to some unusual deep-sea swimming nemerteans, but few paleontologists accept this classification as the Burgess Shale fossils show no evidence of rhynchocoel nor intestinal caeca.&lt;ref name=&quot;Waggoner&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dzik|first=Jerzy |editor=Gyula PÃ¡lyi, Luciano Caglioti, Claudia Zucchi|title=Advances in BioChirality|url=http://books.google.com/?id=DS68n3zIqwAC&amp;pg=PA165&amp;dq=amiskwia+nemertean+nemertini#v=onepage&amp;q=amiskwia%20nemertean%20nemertini&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 Feb 2011|year=1999|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080434049|page=165|chapter=Evolutionary origin of assymetry in early metazoan animals}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some ways ''[[Vetustovermis planus]]'' from the early [[Cambrian]] [[Maotianshan Shale]] resembles some planktonic nemerteans.

==== Relationships with other phyla ====
English-language writings have conventionally treated nemertean as &quot;primitive&quot; acoelomate bilaterians that are most closely related to flatworms (Platyhelminthes). These pre-[[cladistics]] analyses emphasised as shared features: multiciliated (with multiple cilia per cell), glandular epidermis; rod-shaped secretory bodies or rhabdites; frontal glands or organs; [[protonephridia]]; and acoelomate body organization.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turbeville2002&quot; /&gt; However, multiciliated epidermal cells and epidermal gland cells are also found in [[Ctenophora]], [[Echiura]], [[Sipuncula]], [[Annelida]], Mollusca and other [[taxon|taxa]]. The rhabdites of nemertea have a different structure from those of flatworms at the microscopic scale. The frontal glands or organs of flatworms vary a lot in structure, and similar structures appear in small marine annelids and [[entoproct]] larvae. The protonephridia of nemertea and flatworms are different in structure,&lt;ref name=&quot;Turbeville2002&quot; /&gt; and in position â the [[flame cell]]s of nemertea are usually in the walls of the fluid vessels and are served by &quot;drains&quot; from which the wastes exit by a small number of tubes through the skin,&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004RespirationCirculatoryExcretion&quot; /&gt; while the flame cells of flatworms are scattered throughout the body.&lt;ref name=&quot;RFB2004FlatwExcret&quot;&gt;{{cite book

According to more recent analyses, in the development of nemertean embryos, ectomesoderm (outer part of the mesoderm, which is the layer in which most of the internal organs are built) is derived from cells&lt;!-- blastomeres --&gt; labelled 3a and 3b, and endomesoderm (inner part of the mesoderm) is derived from the 4d cell. Some of the ectomesoderm in [[annelids]], [[echiuran]]s and [[mollusc]]s is derived from cells 3a and 3b, while the ectomesoderm of [[polyclad]] [[flatworm]]s is derived from the 2b cell and [[acoel]] flatworms produce no ectomesoderm. In nemerteans the space between the epidermis and the gut is mainly primarily by well-developed muscles embedded in noncellular [[connective tissue]]. This structure is similar to that found in larger flatworms such as [[polyclad]]s and [[triclad]]s, but a similar structure of body-wall muscles embedded in noncellular connective tissue is widespread among the [[Spiralia]] (animals in which the early cell divisions make a spiral pattern) such as [[sipuncula]]ns, [[echiura]]ns and many annelids.&lt;ref name=&quot;Turbeville2002&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | last=Turbeville | first=J.

Nemerteans' affinities with Annelida (including Echiura, [[Siboglinidae|Pogonophora]], [[Vestimentifera]] and perhaps Sipuncula) and Mollusca make the ribbon-worms members of [[Lophotrochozoa]], which &lt;!-- include more animal phyla than any other [[metazoan]] clade than [[Animalia]] and --&gt; include about half of the extant animal phyla.&lt;ref name=&quot;Giribet2008&quot; /&gt; Lophotrochozoa groups: those animals that feed using a [[lophophore]] ([[Brachiopoda]], [[Bryozoa]], [[Phoronida]], [[Entoprocta]]); phyla in which most members' embryos develop into [[trochophore]] larvae (for example Annelida and Mollusca); and some other phyla (such as Platyhelminthes, Sipuncula, Nemertea, Gastrotricha, Gnathostomulida, Micrognathozoa, Nemertea, [[Phoronida]], Platyhelminthes and [[Rotifera]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Halanych2004NewView&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Halanych, K.
