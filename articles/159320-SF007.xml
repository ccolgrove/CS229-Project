'''''Tux Racer''''' is a [[Free Software]] 3D [[Video game|computer game]] starring the [[Linux]] [[mascot]], [[Tux]] the [[penguin]]. In the game, the player controls Tux (or one of three other characters) as he slides down a course of snow and ice collecting [[herring]]. Sliding on ice makes Tux go faster, while sliding on snow allows for more maneuverability and sliding on rocky patches will slow Tux down. There are also trees to block Tux's path and flags for the sake of marking out the course.

==Gameplay==
The left/right steering controls are typical of a racing simulation game, except that the up arrow key causes Tux to âpaddleâ with his flippers. Correct use of the paddle command is essential to getting good race times.  Paddling slows Tux down when at a high speed but speeds him up at slow speeds. Paddling when in mid-air may also be used to increase the length of a jump. Jumps can be caused by the shape of the landscape or by holding down the &quot;energy&quot; key (usually '''e''') and releasing it. Releasing the key when a jump is imminent will naturally make a larger jump. Versions with other controls instead of keyboard exist; for example, [[Wii Remote|wiimote]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Rosenlund |date=2008-10-15 |title=World of VÃ¥rdcraft |url=http://www.nyteknik.se/nyheter/it_telekom/dataspel/article427827.ece |work=NyTeknik |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt; and an arcade version with a steering wheel.

Points are also scored by collecting [[herring]] that are scattered along the various courses.  In order to progress to the next level of the game you have to both collect sufficient herring and reach the end of the course within a preset time limit. Like many open-source games, the [[replay value]] of ''Tux Racer'' is extended by easy modification of the game. New maps can be created by making three [[Raster graphics|raster]] images to indicate height, surface, and object placement.

==Development==
[[Image:WaterlooMathBuilding.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''Tux Racer'' was developed in the [[University of Waterloo]] Computer Graphics Lab.]]
''Tux Racer'' was originally developed by Jasmin Patry, a [[student]] attending the [[University of Waterloo]] (UW) in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], where he aimed to begin a career in the video game industry by pursuing a [[computer systems analyst]] (CSA) degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tuxracer.fubaby.com/articles.php?ArticleID=4|title=Interview with Jasmin Patry from Sunspire Studios|year=2002|author=Yarwood, Arthur J.|publisher=''Tuxracer Belly Rub''|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of the game as a project began in August 1999 as a final [[computer graphics (computer science)|computer graphics]] project in Computer Graphics Lab (CGL).&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Waterloo&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.student.cs.uwaterloo.ca/~cs488/gallery-A5-98-99.html &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|title=University of Waterloo CS488/688 1998-1999 Gallery|date=2000-03-09|publisher=[[University of Waterloo]]|accessdate=2010-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint&quot;/&gt; The game was completed and presented in three days; a [[webpage]] for the game was then started, when one of Patry's classmates, having enjoyed the presentation, suggested he released the software as [[open source]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint&quot;/&gt; Patry felt releasing the game as open source &quot;made sense&quot; due to Tux being the mascot for [[Linux kernel|Linux]], an open source software, and continued to work on the game throughout the year, hoping fellow students would join in on developing the game.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;

In December 1999, Patry and his former classmates Patrick Gilhuly, Eric Hall, Rick Knowles, Mark Riddell, and Rob Kroeger announced the foundation of the company Sunspire Studios to develop a [[video game]] project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; Patry stated the game &quot;would feature a [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game|massively multiplayer]], persistent universe with [[real-time strategy]] and [[first-person shooter]] components,&quot; &quot;[...] something that would make the ''[[Quake 3]]'' or ''[[Unreal]]'' [[game engine|engine]] look tame in comparison.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt; Fine arts undergraduate classmate Roger Fernandez was chosen as the [[video game artist|artist]]; however, the project was eventually abandoned due to limitations in current [[3D computer graphics software|graphical software]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint&quot;/&gt; In August 2000, Knowles suggested the company resume working on ''Tux Racer'', which became their first official project.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint&quot;/&gt; The game was released as [[free software]] under the [[GNU General Public License]] on October 2, 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;release&quot;/&gt;

In August 2000, Patry and his two friends Rick Knowles and Mark Riddell announced the [[video game developer|development]] of an enhanced version of ''Tux Racer'' under a [[Proprietary software|closed source]] commercial license.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/issues/110300/3Science/science01.shtml |title=An equation for success - Waterloo grads create fun-filled game for all|date=2000-11-03|author=Ganthan, Durshan|publisher=''[[Imprint (newspaper)|Imprint]]''|accessdate=2010-03-23 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20010127144700/http://imprint.uwaterloo.ca/issues/110300/3Science/science01.shtml |archivedate = 2001-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, a [[game demo|demo version]] of the software was included with a January 2001 issue of ''[[PC Gamer]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Imprint&quot;/&gt; In 2002, the game was released for [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] operating systems. Patry states that had the game sold better, ports for the [[Nintendo GameCube]] and [[Xbox]] would be &quot;fairly logical&quot; choices.&lt;ref name=&quot;Interview&quot;/&gt;

In 2003, Sunspire Studios ceased business. Their [[Internet]] domains&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040612081649/http://www.sunspirestudios.com/ Sunspire Studios]&lt;/ref&gt; are now commercially [[cybersquatting|cybersquatted]]. According to [[archive.org]], there had been no significant changes to their site since September 22, 2002, when the Tux Racer 1.1.1 Linux Patch was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040210112210/http://tuxracer.com/ Tux Racer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the site continued to exist almost unchanged until 2004. Their demo of version 1.1 can still be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fileplanet.com/files/80000/84323.shtml FilePlanet: Tux Racer 1.1 Demo (Linux)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Despite the game ceasing production, certain [[fork (software development)|forks]] of ''Tux Racer'' exist, including ''Open Racer'', an open source fork of the original ''Tux Racer'' created by Nathan Matias for [[SourceForge]] in 2001;&lt;ref name=&quot;Linux Today&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxtoday.com/news_story.php3?ltsn=2001-08-02-011-20-NW-GM|title=Tux Racer to be closed source - GPL Project Continues|date=2001-08-02|author=Matias, Nathan J.|publisher=''Linux Today''|accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; this version was eventually abandoned. A fork entitled ''PlanetPenguin Racer'', an enhanced version of the GPL-licensed version of ''Tux Racer'', was created;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=4044|title=Asus Eee PC Initial Hands On and Video Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|date=2007-10-25|author=Jackson, Jerry, O'Brien, Kevin &amp; Baxter, Andrew|publisher=''Notebook Review''|accessdate=2010-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, it was discontinued in 2006, with the latest release being in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060101094408/projects.planetpenguin.de/racer/ Projects@PlanetPenguin :: Racer&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A new project based on ''PlanetPenguin Racer'' entitled ''Extreme Tux Racer'' was developed on March 2007, and is currently in development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://extremetuxracer.com Extreme Tux Racer]&lt;/ref&gt; An [[arcade game|arcade]] [[redemption game]] entitled ''Tux Racer Arcade'' has been released by [[Roxor Games]]; a sequel entitled ''Tux 2 Arcade'' has also been released, featuring  four courses and four characters from the commercial version, namely Tux, his friend Trixi, a female penguin, Boris, a [[bear]], and Samuel, a [[Pinniped|seal]].
