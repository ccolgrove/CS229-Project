'''Software Freedom Day''' (SFD) is an annual worldwide celebration of [[Free Software]].  SFD is a public education effort with the aim of increasing awareness of Free Software and its virtues, and encouraging its use.

Software Freedom Day was established in 2004 and was first observed on 28 August of that year. Over 70 teams participated in the first Software Freedom Day. Since that time it has grown in popularity and organisers anticipated more than 1,000 teams in 2010&lt;ref&gt;[http://fred.dao2.com/?p=273 Fred Muller's blog] (President of Software Freedom International)&lt;/ref&gt; (though only half of this number was actually achieved, representing a 30% decrease over 2009).

Since 2006 Software Freedom Day has been held on the third Saturday of September, it has occasionally coincided with [[International Talk Like a Pirate Day]].

==Software Freedom International==

&quot;Software Freedom International&quot; (SFI) is a [[non-profit organisation]] that acts as the official organiser of Software Freedom Day, and is the legal body that handles donations, sponsorship contracts, and accounting. SFI has successfully obtain a tax-exempt status in the USA where it is registered, in order to make donations tax-deductible. The name Software Freedom International was chosen to distinguish the organisational body from the event of Software Freedom Day itself.

== The day itself ==

Each event is left to local teams around the world to organise. Pre-registered teams (2 months before the date or earlier) receive free [[promotional item|schwag]] sent by SFI to help with the events themselves. The [http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org SFD wiki] contains individual team pages describing their plans as well as helpful information to get them up to speed. Events themselves varies between conferences explaining the virtues of Free and Open Source Software, to workshops, demonstrations, games, planting tree ceremonies, discussions and [[Linux_User_Group#Installfests|InstallFests]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.softwarefreedomday.org/StartGuide#What_should_we_do.3F SFD Startup Guide (What should we do)]&lt;/ref&gt;
