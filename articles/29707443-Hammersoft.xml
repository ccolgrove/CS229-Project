&quot;'''Walkaway Lover'''&quot; is a [[Pop music|pop]] song performed by Australian actress/singer [[Toni Pearen]], released as the third single from her debut album ''[[Intimate (Toni Pearen album)|Intimate]]'' in October 1994. 

Toni Pearen's first two singles &quot;[[In Your Room (Toni Pearen song)|In Your Room]]&quot; and &quot;[[I Want You (Toni Pearen song)|I Want You]]&quot; both peaked at number ten on the [[ARIA Singles Chart]] and were each certified gold. &quot;Walkaway Lover&quot; debuted at number fifty and eventually peaked at number thirty-five, spending a total of eleven weeks in the charts. The single was issued to coincide with the much anticipated release of the album ''Intimate''. Some could cite that the single's underperformance was because it was released more than one year after the successful second single &quot;I Want You&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://poptrashaddicts.blogspot.com/2007/07/toni-pearens-pop-legacy.html Pop Trash Addicts: Toni Pearen's Pop Legacy&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This could also be seen as a reason the album itself also did not chart well.
