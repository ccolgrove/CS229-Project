==History==
WRIC-FM was originally on 100.7 FM, but switched frequencies with sister station [[WMJD]] in [[Grundy, Virginia]] in 2005.

The WRIC calls were originally parked at AM 540 in Richlands, now [[WGTH (AM)|WGTH-AM]].

In April 2009, WRIC-FM began simulcasting [[WSTG]], located out of [[Princeton, West Virginia]], which carries an [[Adult Hits]] format.  Around the same time, WRIC-FM's ownership changed from Peggy Sue Broadcasting Corporation to RR &amp; WT Broadcasting, Inc.

WRIC is not related to [[WRIC-TV]] in [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]].
