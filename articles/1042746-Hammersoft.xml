[[General (Australia)|General]] '''Peter John Cosgrove''' [[Companion of the Order of Australia|AC]], [[Military Cross|MC]] (born 28&amp;nbsp;July 1947) is a retired [[Australian Army]] officer. He was the [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] from 3&amp;nbsp;July 2002 to 3&amp;nbsp;July 2005, when he retired from active service. In May 2010 he was appointed Chancellor of the [[Australian Catholic University]],&lt;ref name=ACU&gt;[http://www.acu.edu.au/246442 General Peter Cosgrove appointed Chancellor of ACU â 25 May 2010]&lt;/ref&gt; taking up this post on 28 November 2010.

==Military service==
Cosgrove was educated at [[Waverley College]], then followed his father, a [[Warrant Officer]], into the [[Australian Army]] by attending the [[Royal Military College, Duntroon]] in 1965. Early in his career, Cosgrove fought in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] with the [[9th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]], where he served with great distinction, receiving the [[Military Cross]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1091561&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an honour entry â Military Cross â 12 February 1971] Citation: Infantry â 9 RAR â Vietnam&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 he was awarded the National Medal.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=907859&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an honour entry â National Medal â 16 October 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;  In the mid-1980s he commanded the [[1st Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment]].&lt;ref name=AM&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=878976&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an honour entry â Member of the Order of Australia â 26 January 1985] Citation: In recognition of service as Commanding Officer 1st Battalion, The Royal Australian Regiment&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Cosgrove came to national fame in 1999 when, as a [[Major General (Australia)|Major General]], he led the international forces ([[INTERFET]]) in a peacekeeping mission to [[East Timor]]. The mission's success made Cosgrove one of Australia's most respected and popular military leaders.&lt;ref name=AC&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=879182&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an honour entry â Companion of the Order of Australia â 25 March 2000] Citation: For eminent service to the Australian Defence Force as the Commander of the International Force East Timor.&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted in 2000 to [[Lieutenant General (Australia)|Lieutenant General]] as [[Chief of Army (Australia)|Chief of the Army]] (CA) and in 2002 to [[General (Australia)|General]] as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF).&lt;ref name=CM&gt;[http://www.itsanhonour.gov.au/honours/honour_roll/search.cfm?aus_award_id=1116107&amp;search_type=quick&amp;showInd=true It's an honour entry â Centenary Medal â 1 January 2001] Citation: For service to Australian society as Chief of the Defence Force&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, then Foreign Minister [[Alexander Downer]] queried the judgement of Federal Police Commissioner [[Mick Keelty]].&lt;ref name=Keelty&gt;[http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/03/18/1079199363688.html ''Honest copper emerges victor'', The Age, 2004-03-18.] During a &quot;doorstop&quot; interview, Downer said Mr Keelty was &quot;expressing a view which reflects a lot of the propaganda we're getting from al-Qaeda&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt; Following a joint interview with then Defence Minister [[Robert Hill (Australian diplomat)|Robert Hill]], Cosgrove was accused of &quot;playing politics&quot; when he said that, on this occasion, he disagreed with Keelty's point of view. However, Cosgrove expressed strong support for the Police Commissioner in his memoir published in 2006.&lt;ref name=MyStory&gt;''My Story'' ([[HarperCollins]] Publishers Australia, October 2006, ISBN 0732283841)&lt;/ref&gt; On 3&amp;nbsp;July 2005, Cosgrove's three year appointment as [[Chief of the Defence Force (Australia)|Chief of the Defence Force]] (CDF) was completed, and he was succeeded by then-[[Chief of Air Force (Australia)|Chief of Air Force]] (CAF) [[Air Marshal (Australia)|Air Marshal]] [[Angus Houston]].

There was some speculation that after retirement he would take up the post of [[Governor-General of Australia]], or run for parliament. He has firmly ruled out all such possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bulletin.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=140889]{{Deadlink|date=September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2011}} He consequently wrote an autobiography, ''My Story'',&lt;ref name=MyStory/&gt; which was a bestseller in Australia.

==Cyclone Larry Taskforce==
On 23 March 2006, Cosgrove was selected to lead the [[Queensland Government]] taskforce of rebuilding communities damaged by [[Cyclone Larry]], a [[Australian tropical cyclone severity category|Category 5]] tropical cyclone that devastated the [[Innisfail, Queensland|Innisfail]] region of northern [[Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cabinet.qld.gov.au/MMS/StatementDisplaySingle.aspx?id=45250 ''General Cosgrove to lead Cyclone Larry taskforce''], Premier of Queensland press release, 2006-03-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;In recognition of the important contribution General Cosgrove made to the community of North Queensland following Cyclone Larry&quot;, on 11 October 2008, [[Premiers of Queensland|Queensland Premier]] [[Anna Bligh]] announced that the new residential suburb in the [[Bohle River Aerodrome|Bohle Plains]] area of [[Townsville, Queensland|Townsville]] will be named Cosgrove.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/10/11/2388426.htm ''Townsville suburb named in honour of General Cosgrove''], ABC News, 11 October 2008.
