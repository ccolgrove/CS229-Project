Alesha Anjanette Dixon was born in [[Welwyn Garden City]], [[Hertfordshire]], on 7 October 1978, to an English mother, Beverly Harris, and [[Jamaica]]n father, Melvin Dixon; she is [[Mixed (United Kingdom ethnicity category)|mixed race]]. Dixon has five half-brothers named Adrian, Mark, John, Jeroame, Callum and one half-sister called Leyanne. She was educated at [[Monk's Walk School]], Welwyn Garden City, Hertfordshire. Dixon's mother and father split up when Dixon was four years old and Dixon's father moved away, resulting in Dixon later describing her family life as &quot;very dysfunctional&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Andrew Billen  |url= http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/music/article6917710.ece|title= Alesha Dixon: I'm no pushover, you'll see |publisher=''[[The Times]]''|date= 2009-11-16|accessdate=2009-12-11 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the ages of eight and ten, Dixon witnessed her mother suffer [[domestic abuse]] from her partner;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattison&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author= Kelly Mattison |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/society/2010/nov/16/alesha-dixon-documentary-domestic-violence |title= Alesha Dixon presents BBC show on domestic violence|publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''|date= 2010-11-16|accessdate=2011-01-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; she only spoke publicly about the issue 21 years later, in 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattison&quot;/&gt; Dixon created a documentary for the [[BBC]], ''Don't Hit My Mum'', regarding the issue of domestic abuse from a child's perspective, and remarked upon her own childhood: &quot;When I think about that time, I don't remember living in harmony, I don't remember any fun times, I suppose because the negativity has clouded it. The negative times and the scary times have blocked anything that was good [...] I believe that every child has the right to grow up in an environment where they feel secure and fearless going into the world, and I didn't really feel that&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mattison&quot;/&gt;

Her first job was at [[Ladbrokes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Alesha Dixon career&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/money/2009/may/30/alesha-dixon-career |title=Love your work: Alesha Dixon &amp;#124; Money &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 2009-05-30|accessdate=2009-07-12 | location=London | first=Deany | last=Judd}}&lt;/ref&gt; although she aspired to become a [[Physical education|PE]] teacher after leaving college.

Upon the release of The Entertainer, the album charted poorly only peaking at number eighty-four on the [[UK Albums Chart]]. The second single released with the album also charted lowly, only peaking at number forty-six on the [[UK Singles Chart]]. Subsequently, Alesha and her record label Atlantic/Asylum parted ways.

In early 2011, rumours began to surface that Dixon's band, [[Mis Teeq]] would be reforming.

In January 2008, less than a month after her profile was raised due to her victory on ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'', Dixon signed a deal with [[Ford]] to endorse the new [[Ford Focus (International)|Ford Focus]], an ad campaign featuring her was made, and a track called '4 U I Will' was recorded using real car parts. Dixon said, &quot;When Ford first showed me the original TV ad and the incredible instruments I immediately wanted to get involved.&quot; Some of the instruments being used were the 'door harp', the 'clutch guitar' and the 'hatchback kick drum', in total 21 parts were taken from the car and transformed into unique looking instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cakegroup.com/archive/lib/pdf/171_strictly-star-fronts-ford-focus-or-car-stra.pdf Press Release: Ford - Strictly Star Fronts Ford Focus Or-Car-Stra]([[Portable Document Format|PDF]]) Cakegroup.com.

When asked by ''[[The Observer]]'' in 2010 whether celebrities have a responsibility to do good works, Dixon replied: &quot;Absolutely. There are so many things you could reel off as negatives â your private life is exposed, every move is scrutinised â at the same time, you can think: 'Wow, I'm in a position to shine a light into these areas.'

The members of the ACLT freely volunteer their time in attempting to raise awareness in the Black community; enabling potential donors to come forward and be involved in the process of offering hope and a healthy future to someone whose disorder may otherwise prove fatal.

Speaking in August 2010 to noted UK urban writer Pete Lewis - Assistant Editor of ''[[Blues &amp; Soul]]'' - about her all-round positive attitude towards her philanthropic work, Dixon said: &quot;Being in the entertainment industry I do feel I have a responsibility that comes with my fame. And, while some celebrities may spend their time moaning about the negative things that come along with being famous, my thing is, if you ''are'' in the limelight then why not try to find ''positive'' things that come with it? And for me the most positive thing is shedding light on subjects that matter but don't normally get a look-in!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluesandsoul.com/feature/581/alesha_dixon_diverse_diva/ Alesha interview by Pete Lewis, 'Blues &amp; Soul' September 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2011, it has been rumoured that Dixon may possibly replace [[Cheryl Cole]] on the upcoming season of the British [[The X Factor (UK)|X Factor]]. However she turned down the role due to her commitment to [[Strictly Come Dancing]]. In July 2011, Alesha Dixon was announced as associate producer for short film 'Victims' about domestic violence and its consequences, which has been nominated for the Film London Best of Borough Film Awards and is now online.&lt;ref&gt;[http://filmlondon.org.uk/best_of_boroughs/victims/ Alesha Dixon, associate producer of film 'Victims', now online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Alesha is a supporter of the [http://www.league.org.uk/content.ASpx?CategoryID=497 League Against Cruel Sports], a charity which works to end cruelty to animals in the name of sport.

==Modelling and television career==
As a model, Dixon is represented by [[Select Model Management]] and has appeared on the cover of ''Cosmopolitan'', ''FHM'', ''Arena'', ''Company'', ''Bliss'' and other magazines and in various other [[editorial]] fashion shoots. In 2008 a poll showed that Dixon had &quot;Britain's sexiest legs&quot; beating [[Alexandra Burke]], [[Naomi Campbell]], [[Tiana Benjamin]], [[Lily Cole]] and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Post to: |url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/12/18/alesha-dixon-s-legs-voted-best-in-britain-115875-20979112/ |title=Alesha Dixon's legs voted best in Britain |publisher=mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon was cast as the lead female in the music video for &quot;[[She Wants to Move]]&quot; by [[N.E.R.D]].

In 2009 it was reported that Dixon was in talks with television companies about a possible [[chatshow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/a157395/alesha-dixon-to-host-new-chatshow.html |title=Television - News - Alesha Dixon to host new chatshow |publisher=Digital Spy |date=2009-05-28 |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 she co-presented [[Children in Need]] alongside [[Terry Wogan]] and [[Tess Daly]], she also presented 2008's coverage from BT Tower.

Dixon took part in series 5 of hit TV show ''[[Strictly Come Dancing]]'' in 2007, partnered with professional dancer [[Matthew Cutler]]. Dixon was at first hesitant to join, fearing that snobbery within the [[music industry]] would damage her career. In a later interview she said, &quot;Thereâs always this preconceived idea that people do [[reality TV]] shows because they want to kick-start their careers whereas I was actually worried that it would affect it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c3g7wX1cQPk |title= [[The Justin Lee Collins Show]] |publisher=[[ITV2]] | date=9 May 2009 |accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had been the favourite from the third week, receiving the most points from the judges on numerous occasions. Dixon herself gained high appraisal from the judges, even being likened to a &quot;young [[Josephine Baker]]&quot; by [[Bruno Tonioli]].&lt;ref name=&quot;A star is born&quot;/&gt; They received 4.5 million votes in the final, beating actor [[Matt Di Angelo]] and professional dancer [[Flavia Cacace]] to win the glitter disco ball.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/12_december/22/strictly.shtml |title=Alesha Dixon wins Strictly Come Dancing 2007 |publisher=BBC News |date= 22 December 2007|accessdate=30 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was revealed in July 2009 that Alesha would be joining the Strictly Come Dancing judging panel in September 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/8142139.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; Dixon joins Strictly dance judges |publisher=BBC News |date= 2009-07-09|accessdate=12 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; She replaced [[Arlene Phillips]], which led to the [[BBC]] being accused of [[ageism]] and [[sexism]] by the media,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/5787653/BBC-in-ageism-row-after-axing-Strictly-judge-Arlene-Phillips-in-favour-of-Alesha-Dixon.html |title= BBC in ageism row after axing Strictly judge Arlene Phillips in favour of Alesha Dixon |publisher= [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2009 | location=London | first1=Urmee | last1=Khan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Strictly Backlash&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://tv.sky.com/strictly-backlash |title= Strictly Backlash |publisher= [[British Sky Broadcasting|Sky]] | date=13 July 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Dixon herself faced criticism by newspaper columnists such as [[Amanda Platell]] and [[Janet Street-Porter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Amanda Platell |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-1194301/Platells-People-Little-Miss-Cleavage-Beebs-bias.html |title=Platell's People: Little Miss Cleavage and the Beeb's against bias &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2009-06-20|accessdate=12 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Janet Street-Porter |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1194618/Why-I-wont-wear-wacky-T-shirts-raise-cash-charity.html |title=Why I won't wear wacky T-shirts to raise cash for charity &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=23 June 2009 |accessdate=12 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon, having a conflicting schedule also had to rearrange three dates on her upcoming tour, [[The Alesha Show (tour)|The Alesha Show]] in order to do the show, which is broadcast live on Saturday nights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.aleshadixon.co.uk/blog,alesha-confirmed-as-new-strictly-come-dancing-judge_121.htm |title= Alesha confirmed as new Strictly Come Dancing judge |publisher= Alesha Dixon official site | date=9 July 2009 |accessdate=4 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The replacement of Arlene Phillips for Alesha Dixon even became dubbed &quot;Alesha-gate&quot; by some (the &quot;[[List of scandals with &quot;-gate&quot; suffix|-gate]]&quot; suffix being a reference to the [[Watergate Scandal]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;Jim Shelley&quot;&gt;{{cite web|author=Jim Shelley |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/shelleyvision/2009/09/strictly-come-dancings-alesha.html |title=Strictly Come Dancing's Alesha Dixon is still better than Cheryl Cole|publisher=''[[Daily Mirror]]'' |date=2009-11-28 |accessdate=2010-06-05 |authorlink=Jim Shelley (TV critic)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dixon's judging debut was met by criticism by some viewers, and 272 complaints were received by the BBC, according to ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Complaints&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephen Brook|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/tv-and-radio/2009/sep/21/alesha-dixon-strictly-come-dancing |title=Alesha Dixon's debut as Strictly judge draws more than 250 complaints |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-06-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the complaints, television critic [[Jim Shelley (TV critic)|Jim Shelley]] commented that &quot;the lynch-mob was such you'd have thought she had strangled a kitten&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Jim Shelley&quot;/&gt; Despite the complaints, the BBC stated they were &quot;delighted&quot; with Dixon.&lt;ref name=&quot;Complaints&quot;/&gt; Arlene Phillips herself stated in response to the claims that &quot;[The BBC] hired Alesha because they wanted a different opinion - a voice of the viewer - and that's what she does. She was never hired to give a technical viewpoint [...] It is very hard for her - she must be incredibly nervous. The judges had all worked together for six series and she is new and on her own.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucy Connolly|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/strictly_come_dancing/2646543/Arlene-Phillips-Strictly-Come-Dancings-lost-some-sparkle.html |title=Strictly's lost some sparkle|publisher=''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' |date=2009-09-21 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fellow judge [[Bruno Tonioli]] accused critics of hypocrisy, saying &quot;this time last year people were calling for Arlene to be sacked on the spot for being rude about [[John Sergeant (journalist)|John Sergeant]] [...] She was the [[Wicked Witch of the West]], now all of a sudden she is [[Mother Teresa]]. What's going on here?&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url= http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/strictly_come_dancing/2718664/Bruno-Tonioli-slams-whingeing-fans.html|title=Frank Bruno |publisher=''[[The Sun (newspaper)|The Sun]]'' |date=2009-11-07 |accessdate=2010-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite Dixon's debut causing hundreds of complaints, critics praised some of her later judging as the series progressed, with Richard Simpson of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' stating, &quot;it seems Miss Dixon has finally found her voice and is making up for lost time on that point&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Simpson|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-1226148/Straight-talking-Alesha-Dixon-doesnt-pull-punches-Strictly.html |title=Straight-talking Alesha Dixon doesn't pull any punches on Strictly |publisher=''[[Daily Mail]]'' |date=2009-11-09 |accessdate=2010-06-05 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In June 2005, after a five-year relationship, Dixon married artist [[Michael Harvey (artist)|MC Harvey]], formerly of [[So Solid Crew]], in a private ceremony at [[Brocket Hall]], [[Hertfordshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-503760/Why-I-walked-Strictlys-Alesha-unfaithful-husband.html |title='Why I walked out on Strictly's Alesha,' by her unfaithful husband &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2007-12-21 |accessdate=2009-07-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon filed for divorce just over a year later after MC Harvey had an affair with [[Javine Hylton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fametastic.co.uk/archive/20071029/8255/alesha-dixon-mc-harvey-regrets-his-affair-but-i-dont/ |title= Alesha Dixon: MC Harvey regrets his affair but I donât |publisher= Fametastic |date=2007-10-29 |accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have no children together.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/mis-teeq%20star%20distraught%20at%20husbands%20alleged%20infidelity_1012869 ContactMusic.com]&lt;/ref&gt; She then dated [[West Ham United]] and former [[Valencia CF]] Norwegian international [[John Carew]]; they split in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2008/05/30/alesha-dixon-splits-from-aston-villa-striker-john-carew-115875-20588291/ |title= Alesha Dixon splits from Aston Villa striker John Carew |publisher= The Daily Mirror |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2010-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After her marriage broke down and her record label dumped her within the space of two weeks, Dixon suffered from depression. In a later interview she said, &quot;It was the lowest point of my life. I just kept thinking, 'What have I done to deserve this?' I didn't see the point in living.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-504345/Alesha-Ive-gone-suicidal-Strictly-Come-Dancing-queen--Im-set-make-5m.html |title=Alesha: 'I've gone from suicidal to Strictly Come Dancing queen â now I'm set to make Â£5m' &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date=2007-12-24 |accessdate=2009-07-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; She decided to move on and to turn around her life, saying &quot;When you are knocked down you have two choices - stay down or get back up, stronger.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Exclusive Interview with: Alesha Dixon |url=http://blogs.mirror.co.uk/the-ticket/2009/05/exclusive-interview-with-alesh.html |title=Exclusive Interview with: Alesha Dixon - The Ticket - TV &amp; Entertainment - Mirror.co.uk |publisher=Blogs.mirror.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said that ''Strictly Come Dancing'' helped her overcome her problems and gave her a &quot;Zest for life&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ok.co.uk/celebnews/view/231/Alesha-Strictly-Come-Dancing-saved-me/?printer=1 |title=OK!

Dixon cut all contact with her older brother, Mark Harris, after he sold his story of their &quot;terrible&quot; childhood, claiming that they &quot;often went to bed hungry&quot; and that her mother, Beverley neglected them in favour of sometimes violent boyfriends, he also accused Dixon of turning her back on her family in the pursuit of fame and fortune.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-504077/Why-Aleshas-troubled-past-desperate-win-Strictly-Come-Dancing.html |title=Why Alesha's troubled past has made her desperate to win Strictly Come Dancing &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2007-12-21|accessdate=2009-07-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to the comments about her mother, Dixon said, &quot;I cherish her. If anyone is rude about her or says a bad word about her they won't be a part of my life. Unfortunately, that's how I feel about my brother.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-504551/Strictly-Come-Dancing-queen-Alesha-heartbreaking-family-feud.html |title=Strictly Come Dancing queen Alesha on her heartbreaking family feud &amp;#124; Mail Online |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 2007-12-26|accessdate=2009-07-12 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2009, in an interview with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Alesha spoke about her [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive behaviour]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;My friends call me [[Monica Geller|Monica]] because she's the one in ''[[Friends]]'' who's obsessed with cleaning. I always think the house looks messy; a messy house can depress me. It can make me feel messy. If my house is clean and everything is in order, I feel better.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rebecca Hardy&quot;&gt;{{cite news|author=Rebecca Hardy |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1137278/Strictly-winner-Alesha-Dixon-obsessive-compulsive-disorder-shes-rebuilt-life-divorce.html|title=Strictly winner Alesha Dixon on her obsessive-compulsive disorder and how she's rebuilt her life after her divorce|publisher=Mail Online |date=February 6, 2009 |accessdate=2009-02-18 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

She is currently living with her two dogs, a [[collie]] cross-breed called Roxy and a puppy called Daisy, both were adopted from an [[RSPCA]] animal centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/4523685.Alesha_Dixon_gives_Southridge_puppy_a_new_home/ |title=Alesha gives Southridge puppy a new home|publisher=This is local London | date=2006-08-07 |accessdate=2009-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon has stated that she hates her own laugh, describing it as sounding like a &quot;[[Crow]]&quot; or &quot;[[Sid James]]&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=March 9, 2009 |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdVZVzzTyg |title=Alesha Dixon - funny laughter |publisher=YouTube |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and saying &quot;I'd change it if I could but it's become a trademark.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/celebs/news/2009/05/08/alehsa-dixon-reveals-all-about-her-rollercoaster-career-115875-21342665/ |title=Alehsa Dixon reveals all about her rollercoaster career |publisher=mirror.co.uk |date=2009-05-08 |accessdate=2009-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon in an interview also said &quot;somebody stole my laugh and made it into a ringtone&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author= |title=Senkveld med Thomas &amp; Harald|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdVZVzzTyg|work=|date= |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
