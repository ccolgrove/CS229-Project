'''V''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] privately-owned [[French language|French-language]] [[television network]]. The network has [[owned-and-operated]] and affiliated stations existing throughout [[Quebec]], although it can also be seen over-the-air in some bordering markets in the provinces of [[Ontario]] and [[New Brunswick]]. It can also be received in some other parts of [[Canada]] by [[satellite television|satellite]], [[cable television|cable]] and [[IPTV]]. 

The network launched in 1986 as '''TQS''', and was known by that name until current owner [[Remstar Corporation|Remstar]] rebranded it as V on August 31, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cyberpresse.ca/arts/television-et-radio/200908/19/01-894055-tqs-enterree-place-a-v.php &quot;TQS enterrÃ©e: place Ã  Â«VÂ»&quot;] {{fr}}. ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'', August 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The history of V goes back to 1968, when the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) first expressed interest in the establishment of a third French-language commercial television service in the province of [[Quebec]] along with the existing [[TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada]] and the loose association of independent stations that eventually became [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]]. However, at that time, the CRTC did not call on applications for licences.

In 1972, the CRTC said it was prepared to receive licence applications in order to authorize a third commercial television service in Quebec, although it was not until 1974 when the CRTC granted licences to TÃ©lÃ© Inter-CitÃ© QuÃ©bec LtÃ©e. to operate TV stations in [[Montreal]] and in [[Quebec City]]. However nothing came of this project.

[[File:TQS logo 1993.svg|thumb|150px|right|1993-1998 logo]]

On November 15, 1984, the CRTC launched another call for applications, and in 1985 it held public hearings in Montreal to examine competing applications from partners Cogeco Inc. (60.3%) and [[Moffat Communications]] (39.7%), and another application by the Pouliot family, owners of Montreal's [[CTV Television Network|CTV]] affiliate, [[CFCF-TV]] and radio stations CFCF-AM (later [[CINW]], now defunct) and CFQR-FM (now [[CKBE-FM]]). Both applications applied to launch television stations in both Montreal and Quebec City. On September 6 of that year, the CRTC approved the application of the Pouliot family and its company, RÃ©seau de TÃ©lÃ©vision Quatre-Saisons Inc. TQS was authorized to operate a French-language TV station in Montreal with an effective radiated power of 566,000 watts on channel 35. While it was denied an application for a station in Quebec City, it was allowed to set up a repeater there.

[[File:TQS LOGO.png|thumb|1998-2006 logo, the logo would sometimes feature a black sheep, to coincide with its slogan, &quot;Le mouton noir de la tÃ©lÃ©&quot; ''(The Black Sheep of Television)''.|120px|left]]

The network was launched in 1986 as '''TÃ©lÃ©vision Quatre-Saisons''' (&quot;Four Seasons Television&quot;). The network spent most of its earlier years in severe financial trouble; at one point, the revenues from CFCF-TV were all that were keeping the network afloat. It was, however, able to upgrade its Quebec City repeater to a full-fledged station in 1989. In its early years, it was known for advertising in English on its then-sister radio stations.

In 1995, the Pouliots sold TQS to Quebec cable company [[VidÃ©otron]], who already owned [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]], Quebec's other private commercial network. Due to monopoly ownership concerns, VidÃ©otron immediately turned around and sold TQS to [[Quebecor]], a newspaper publisher.

Quebecor acquired VidÃ©otron itself in 2001, and put TQS back on the market. Later in 2001, TQS was bought by a joint venture of [[CTVglobemedia]] (then known as Bell Globemedia) and [[Cogeco]], another cable company. Cogeco owned 60% of the venture and handled most of the operations, while CTVglobemedia owned 40%. The acquisition, in a sense, reunited it with CFCF, which had been bought by CTV a year earlier.

===Bankruptcy protection===
[[File:TQS logo.svg|thumb|Used from late 2006 to late 2008|120px|right]]

On December 18, 2007, TQS filed for protection from its creditors in a bankruptcy-court filing. At this point the network was given 30 days in which to reorganize and revamp itself, with the goal of finding a viable solution to pay off its creditors. On January 16, 2008, a judge extended the grace period for an additional 45 days.

Montreal's newspaper ''[[La Presse (Canadian newspaper)|La Presse]]'' reported on January 15 that [[Rogers Communications]] and [[RNC Media]] were each interested in acquiring some individual stations within the network, although RNC Media later denied the report and Rogers declined to comment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5gDKIurFgAmjFM1DmLF_SplB4ejaw &quot;French-language television network TQS facing potential bidding war&quot;], [[The Canadian Press]], January 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On February 25, 2008, the network confirmed that it had received four purchase bids, although it did not disclose the identities of the bidders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.570news.com/news/business/article.jsp?content=b0225164A &quot;TQS receives four formal bids for troubled Quebec TV network&quot;], [[CKGL (AM)|CKGL]], February 25, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remstar's takeover and rebranding of the network===
On March 10, 2008, the [[Superior Court of Quebec|Quebec Supreme Court]] approved the sale of TQS to Remstar Corporation, a Montreal-based television and film producer and distributor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080310.wtqs0310/BNStory/Business &quot;Judge approves Remstar acquisition of TQS&quot;], [[Report on Business]], March 10, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Creditors, who were owed more than $33 million, voted to accept the Remstar proposal in May.&lt;ref&gt;[http://canadianpress.google.com/article/ALeqM5hoUDZ0gh4SG3t1NHOdzL5JPgsEEQ &quot;TQS creditors accept deal that would see them get $7 million of $33 million&quot;], [[The Canadian Press]], May 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The CRTC approved the application on June 26, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/n2008-5.htm CRTC Notice of Public Hearing 2008-5].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/db2008-129.htm Broadcasting Decision CRTC 2008-129]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:TQS remstar.png|thumb|The last logo of TQS, used from 2008-2009|150px|left]]

Remstar announced on April 23, 2008 that 270 jobs would be cut at TQS, while the information services division would be abolished entirely&amp;nbsp;â thus eliminating all newscasts from the network starting in September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.canoe.com/infos/quebeccanada/archives/2008/04/20080424-150044.html &quot;Les employÃ©s de TQS Ã  fleur de peau&quot;], [[Canadian Online Explorer|canoe.com]], April 24, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; While the CRTC ultimately ordered Remstar to retain local news programming on the network, it did take the network's precarious financial situation into account by allowing a reduced amount of local news programming until the network's license renewal hearing in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2008/db2008-129.htm CRTC Decision 2008-129]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the network's fall [[upfronts]] presentation for 2009, the network announced a repositioning plan, including a shedding of the TQS moniker and its black sheep logo in favour of the name &quot;V&quot;, complete with a black-and-gold circle logo with a stylized letter V.  The V name reflects the channel's new mission of &quot;vedettes&quot; (stars), &quot;vitesse&quot; (speed), &quot;voyages&quot; (trips), and &quot;vice ou vÃ©ritÃ©&quot; (vices or truths).

The new program lineup includes the daily news and discussion programs ''Le show du matin'', hosted by [[Gildor Roy]], and ''[[Dumont 360]]'', hosted by [[Mario Dumont]]. V's rebranding took effect on August 31, 2009 at 6am [[Eastern Time Zone|ET]] after the infomercial block.&lt;ref&gt;{{fr}} [http://www.cyberpresse.ca/le-soleil/arts-et-spectacles/television-et-radio/200906/02/01-862395-tqs-changera-de-nom.php &quot;TQS changera de nom&quot;].

==Programming==
{{see|List of programs broadcast by V}}

V has long been a distant third in the ratings to [[TVA (TV network)|TVA]] and [[SociÃ©tÃ© Radio-Canada]].  Most of its affiliates are on [[UHF]], and operate at moderate-to-low power compared to their TVA and Radio-Canada counterparts. However, it has produced a number of major hit series in Quebec.

===News===
From the network's launch to its 2008 restructing, the nightly ''[[Le Grand Journal (TQS)|Le Grand Journal]]'' formed the core of V's news programming. [[Jean-Luc Mongrain]] anchored the program from 1999 until its final edition aired on August 29, 2008. [[BenoÃ®t Dutrizac]] also anchored a 10 p.m. news talk show, ''[[Dutrizac]]'', in the later half of the 2000s.

News programming continues in a reduced form on V, now produced by independent producer ADN5. News summaries of approximately three minutes are inserted into the network's morning and noontime programming, along with a 30-minute newscast weekend evenings.

===Sports===
V has long aired a nighttime sports show, beginning with ''Sports Plus'' (1986â1998), then ''110%'' (1998â2009), followed by ''L'attaque Ã  5'' (2009â2010).

Its carriage of live sporting events began with [[Super Bowl XXI]] in 1987. It has carried games of the [[National Hockey League]], including the [[Quebec Nordiques]] from 1988 to 1994 and the [[Montreal Canadiens]] from 1994 to 2002.  It also aired games of the [[Montreal Expos]] from 1994 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In February 2005, V (and then sister-broadcaster [[RÃ©seau des sports|RDS]]) was part of the consortium that won the Canadian broadcast rights to the [[Vancouver]] [[2010 Winter Olympics]] and the [[2012 Summer Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

  | accessdate = 2009-08-21 }} {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to V not being carried on many cable systems outside of the province, unlike previous rights holder [[TÃ©lÃ©vision de Radio-Canada]], the non-profit public affairs network [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]] gained special authorization from the CRTC to allow its French coverage of the 2010 games to be simulcast on the network, which enjoys mandatory cable coverage across Canada.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpac.ca/forms/index.asp?dsp=template&amp;act=view3&amp;section_id=21&amp;template_id=1302&amp;lang=e CPAC and CTV Team Up to Deliver French Olympic Coverage], CPAC / COBMC press release, 2010-02-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2010/lb100211.htm CRTC letter to CPAC], 2010-02-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://vivezvancouver.radio-canada.ca/vivezvancouver/CultureSociete/2010/02/11/004-JO-tele-CPAC-APTN.shtml CPAC desservira les francophones hors-QuÃ©bec], Radio-Canada, 2010-02-11 {{fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Movies===
The network is known to many English Canadian viewers for ''[[Bleu Nuit]]'', a showcase of softcore [[pornography]] which formerly broadcast late Saturday nights, similar to the old ''[[Baby Blue Movies]]'' that once aired on [[Toronto]]'s [[Citytv]]. In fact, V was once considered the French counterpart of [[Citytv]].

===Prime time===
{{main|2010â2011 Canadian network television schedule}}

===Programming on V's O&amp;O stations outside Montreal and Quebec City===
Since the rebranding of the TQS network to V, on August 31, 2009, all V's [[owned and operated station]]s (O&amp;O) outside [[Montreal]] and [[Quebec City]] dropped all non-network programming and become a de facto repeater of Montreal's V O&amp;O, [[CFJP-DT]]. Unlike O&amp;O stations, non-owned affiliates of the V network, such as [[CFGS-DT]] in [[Gatineau]], [[CJPC-TV]] in [[Rimouski]], [[CFTF-DT]] in [[RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup]] and [[CFVS-DT]] in [[Val-d'Or]], continue to broadcast local programming.

==Coverage==
Unlike TVA, V does not have mandatory cable carriage rights outside of Quebec, but may be offered at a cable company's discretion if there is a sufficient local market for French language television programming. Consequently the network is not widely available outside of Quebec, although some communities in [[Ontario]],  [[New Brunswick]] and [[Nova Scotia]] receive V affiliates on cable.

The network's affiliate in [[Gatineau]] is part of the [[Ottawa]] television market, and is carried in both analog and digital on cable systems in nearly all of [[Eastern Ontario]]. [[Rogers Cable]] systems in [[Central Ontario]], [[Southwestern Ontario]] and the [[Greater Toronto Area]] offer the channel on their [[digital cable]] tier, but not in analog, while those in New Brunswick carry V in both analog and digital. [[EastLink (company)|EastLink]] systems in [[Northeastern Ontario]] also carry V in both analog and digital.

The network affiliate in [[RiviÃ¨re-du-Loup]] also has a [[rebroadcaster]] in [[Edmundston]], [[New Brunswick]], the network's only over-the-air transmitter outside of Quebec.

To ensure that the network's coverage of the [[2010 Winter Olympics]] reached the vast majority of Canada's francophones, the network was simulcast on [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]], which has mandatory carriage on the basic service of all Canadian cable and satellite providers, from February 12 to 28, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpac.ca/forms/index.asp?dsp=template&amp;act=view3&amp;section_id=21&amp;template_id=1302&amp;lang=e CPAC and CTV Team Up to Deliver French Olympic Coverage], CPAC / COBMC press release, 2010-02-11&lt;/ref&gt;

==V HD==
On June 4, 2007, TQS launched an [[High-definition television|HD]] simulcast of its Montreal station [[CFJP-TV|CFJP]] for cable subscribers. In December 2007, TQS officially launched a transmitter in Montreal making the HD simulcast of CFJP available over-the-air.

V HD is available nationally via satellite and on digital cable as well as for free via [[Digital terrestrial television|DTT]] using a regular TV antenna and a digital tuner (included in most new TVs) on the following channels:

* Montreal: [[CFJP-DT]] 42 ([[PSIP]] virtual channel 35.1)
* Trois-RiviÃ¨res: [[CFKM-DT]] 34 ([[PSIP]] virtual channel 16.1)

==Identity and slogans==
Beginning in 1997, TQS branded itself as ''le mouton noir de la tÃ©lÃ©'' ({{lang-en|the [[black sheep (term)|black sheep]] of television}}), a slogan that could have served as the network's acknowledgment (or perhaps a badge of pride) that its history of financial difficulties, edgy programming, and limited availability outside Quebec had not always given it a prestigious place in the TV industry or in the eyes of the viewing public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://madnessbrewing.com/2008/07/ from madnessbrewing.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  The black sheep slogan was discontinued with the network's rebranding from TQS to V at the end of August 2009.

*1987-1989: On grandit ensemble! ''(We grow together!)''
*1989-1995: TQS Au coeur de l'action! ''(TQS in the middle of action!)
*1995-1997: AllumÃ©e! ''(Turned on!)'' (Literally, &quot;Lit up!&quot;)
*1997-2007, 2008-2009: Le mouton noir de la tÃ©lÃ© ''(The black sheep of television)''
*2007: Parce que vous Ãªtes... diffÃ©rent! ''(Because you are... different!)''
*2009-2010: Laissez-vous divertir ''(Let yourself be entertained)'', to coincide with the rebranding to V on August 31, 2009.
*2010: Le divertissement Ã  la puissance V ''(Entertainment with power, V)''
