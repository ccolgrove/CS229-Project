'''Occupy Boston''' is a [[protest]] that began on September 30, 2011 in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], on [[Dewey Square]] in the [[Financial District, Boston|Financial District]] opposite the [[Federal Reserve Bank of Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/blogs/thenextgreatgeneration/2011/10/occupy_boston_takes_over_dewey.html Occupy Boston Takes Over Dewey Square].&quot; Boston Globe, October 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Boston protesters: End corporate control of govt.&quot; Associated Press/Wall Street Journal, Oct. 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stephen Dwyer &quot;[http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/culturefashion/who-is-occupying-boston-and-why/ Who is occupying Boston, and why?] Blast Magazine, October 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Tran. &quot;[http://www.boston.com/yourtown/news/downtown/2011/10/at_bostons_dewey_square_a_prot.html At Boston's Dewey Square, a protest of varied voices].&quot; Boston Globe, October 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement that began in New York City on September 17,&lt;ref&gt;http://occupyboston.com/&lt;/ref&gt; also protesting against [[Equity (economics)|economic inequity]], [[corporate greed]], and the influence of corporations and [[lobbying|lobbyists]] on government.

==Overview==
On October 9, the protest hosted supporters of [[Tarek Mehanna]], a [[Sudbury, Massachusetts|Sudbury]] pharmacist accused of supporting [[Al Queda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=McConville|first=Christine|title=âOccupyâ protesters branch out|url=http://www.bostonherald.com/news/regional/view.bg?articleid=1372233|publisher=''[[Boston Herald]]''|accessdate=2011-10-12|date=2011-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, the Boston demonstrators expanded their [[tent city]] onto an additional portion of the [[Rose Kennedy Greenway]]; starting around 1:20 am the following morning, 141 people were arrested by the officers of the [[Boston Police Special Operations Unit]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.boston.com/Boston/metrodesk/2011/10/boston-mayor-says-sympathizes-with-protesters-but-they-can-tie-the-city/GFmOU1qwApiGhBNsNSzMIL/index.html More than 100 arrested in Occupy Boston protests].&quot; Boston Globe, 2011-10-11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. David Goodman. &quot;[http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/11/video-shows-protesters-arrested-in-boston-and-washington/?scp=1&amp;sq=%22occupy%20boston%22&amp;st=cse Video Shows Protesters Arrested in Boston and Washington].&quot; New York Times, October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Stephen Dwyer. &quot;[http://blastmagazine.com/the-issue/129-arrested-in-occupy-boston-protest/ 141 arrested in Occupy Boston protest] Blast Magazine, October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-15262310 Occupy Wall Street: 100 arrests at Boston protest].&quot; BBC News, October 11, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

As of October 15, 2011, the camp itself has consisted of about 90 tents on either side of a path the protestors have named, &quot;Main Street,&quot; plus another two dozen or so tents divided up between the &quot;Student Village&quot; area and a strip of lawn the protestors have named &quot;Weird Street&quot;.&lt;ref name=blastweek2&gt;John Stephen Dwyer. &quot;[http://blastmagazine.com/the-magazine/features/enterprise-articles/entrenched-in-occupy-boston-at-the-end-of-week-two/ Entrenched in Occupy Boston at the end of week two], Blast Magazine, October 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; 

A local [[WFXT|Fox 25 News]] article reported on October 13 that a [[U.S. Coast Guard]] member was harassed and spat upon near Dewey Square. A spokesperson for Occupy Boston said the person was not certainly not part of the movement; the Coast Guard also confirmed that there are no allegations that this assault was committed by an Occupy Boston participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/local/occupy-boston-protesters-spit-on-coast-guard-member-20111013 |title=Coast Guard member spit on near Occupy Boston tents |publisher=Myfoxboston.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.enewspf.com/opinion/27826-occupy-boston-statement-on-bad-behavior.html |title=Occupy Boston Statement On Bad Behavior |publisher=Enewspf.com |date=2011-10-15 |accessdate=2011-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A group of Occupy Boston participants protested in the lobby of the building where the Israeli Consulate of Boston is located. They protested the illegal Israeli military blockade of the occupied Palestinian [[Gaza Strip]]. The Israeli military intercepted civilian aid ships with the [[Free Gaza Movement]] attempting to enter the Gaza's territorial waters on their way to Gaza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Occupy Boston' takes Israeli consulate|url=http://www.presstv.ir/detail/208568.html|work='Occupy Boston' takes Israeli consulate|publisher=Press TV Iran|accessdate=11/12/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupy' protestors storm Israeli consulate|url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/tabid/178/nid/23006/language/en-US/Default.aspx|work=Occupy' protestors storm Israeli consulate|publisher=Israel Today Magazine|accessdate=11/12/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Occupy Boston Occupies Israeli Consulate|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xd1uO29UWzY|work=Occupy Boston Occupies Israeli Consulate|publisher=Dennis Trainor, Jr|accessdate=11/14/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Occupy Bostonâs laptops and cellphones have been powered by [[Electric_generator#Human_powered_electrical_generators|bicycle generator]]s&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenation.com/article/164497/capitalism-vs-climate ''Capitalism vs. the Climate; What the right gets - and the left doesn't - about the revolutionary power of climate change'' by [[Naomi Klein]] November 9, 2011. [[The Nation]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Granted legal protection==
On November 17, a judge issued an order prohibiting the eviction of protestors from Occupy Boston.   A hearing is scheduled for December 1.  &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/Boston/metrodesk/2011/11/judge-issues-temporary-order-barring-occupy-boston-evictions/PHTNf1ZmtDtzKVYti6DRlL/index.html Judge issues order barring Occupy Boston evictions]&lt;/ref&gt;
