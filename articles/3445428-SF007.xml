'''GIANT AntiSpyware''' was a spyware detection and removal application developed by [[GIANT Company Software, Inc]].

GIANT Company Software, Inc. was acquired by [[Microsoft Corporation]] on December 16, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2004/dec04/12-16GIANTPR.mspx |title=Microsoft Acquires Anti-Spyware Leader GIANT Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; GIANT AntiSpyware is no longer sold and Microsoft stopped releasing spyware definition updates for it in August 2006.

Microsoft's [[Windows Defender]] (formerly Microsoft AntiSpyware) program is built upon a restructured version of GIANT AntiSpyware.

Sunbelt's [[Counterspy]] was based on GIANT and is still usable this day.
But, the code is completely different now than GIANT.
