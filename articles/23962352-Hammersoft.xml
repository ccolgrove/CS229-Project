}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is an institution of higher learning located in [[Rolla, Missouri]], [[United States]], and part of the [[University of Missouri System]]. Most of its 7,206 students (Fall 2010 enrollment) study [[engineering]], [[computer|computing]], [[mathematics]] and the sciences. Although known primarily as an engineering school, Missouri S&amp;T has numerous majors in humanities, social sciences, arts, sciences and business.

The school is famous for its repeated success in national engineering design competitions and its century-long tradition of aggrandized celebrations surrounding [[Saint Patrick's Day]].

==History==
[[Image:Norwood Hall at Missouri S&amp;T.jpg|thumb|right|Norwood Hall, from the southwest]]
Missouri S&amp;T was originally a [[University of Missouri]] offspring called the ''Missouri School of Mines and [[Metallurgy]]'' (MSM), founded in 1870 as the first technological learning institution west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Early in its beginnings, the School of Mines was focused primarily on [[mining]] and metallurgy, but by the 1920s, had expanded into [[civil engineering|civil]], [[electrical engineering|electrical]], [[mechanical engineering|mechanical]] and [[chemical engineering]] as well as [[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]] and [[geology]]. The school became home to Missouri's first operational [[nuclear reactor]] in 1961. 

In 1964, the School of Mines, although always a part of the University of Missouri system, changed its name to ''University of Missouri at Rolla''. The curriculum was expanded to include most of the science and engineering disciplines, as well as social sciences and [[liberal arts]] such as psychology and history. In 1968, the campus name was slightly altered to the ''University of MissouriâRolla'', thus conforming to the naming scheme of the other three campuses.  Business and management programs were gradually added in the following years.  On January 1, 2008 UMR became known as ''Missouri University of Science and Technology'' or ''Missouri S&amp;T'' for short.&lt;ref name=namechange /&gt;

===Missouri S&amp;T Stonehenge===
[[Image:umr stonehenge.jpg|right|frame|Missouri S&amp;T Stonehenge, next to U.S. Highway 63.]]

[[Stonehenge replicas and derivatives|Missouri S&amp;T Stonehenge is a partial reconstruction]] of the original [[Stonehenge]] monument located on [[Salisbury Plain]], west of [[London]]. Missouri S&amp;T's version of the ancient structure is located on the [[Ordinal directions|northwest]] corner of campus, and was dedicated on June 20, 1984 during the summer [[solstice]]. It features a 50 foot (15 m) diameter ring of 30 stones around a horseshoe of five [[trilithon]]s through which various sightings of [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]] can be made. About 160 tons of [[granite]] were used to construct the monument. The rock was cut by Missouri S&amp;T's [[water jet cutter]] equipment, which used two waterjets cutting at a pressure of 15,000 pounds of force per square inch (103 MPa), slicing across the surface just like a conventional saw. The cutter moved at a speed of about 10 feet per minute (50&amp;nbsp;mm/s) and cut between one-quarter and one-half inch (6 and 13&amp;nbsp;mm) on each pass.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockmech.mst.edu/stonehenge/ Missouri S&amp;T Stonehenge Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

After completion, Missouri S&amp;T Stonehenge received an award from the National Society of Professional Engineers for being one of 1985's Ten Outstanding Engineering Achievements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rockmech.mst.edu/stonehenge/answerspage4.html Missouri S&amp;T Stonehenge FAQ page]&lt;/ref&gt;

A few years after its construction, a new health center building was erected that blocked the sightings of the sun throughout much of the year.

===Millennium Arch===
[[Image:UMR Stonehenge night.jpg|right|thumb|200px|The Millennium Arch, in front of Castleman Hall.]]

The university worked with artist [[Edwina Sandys]] to develop a new way to make deep cuts in granite and used the method to create the Millennium Arch sculpture, across the campus from Stonehenge. The Arch is a single [[trilithon]] with a vague silhouette of a man and a woman on each of its supporting megaliths several meters from the arch (and can be seen in the distance between the two silhouettes in the image to the left). The monument is located on 10th Street, facing Castleman Hall, in Rolla. The project was developed in the High Pressure Waterjet Laboratory of the Rock Mechanics &amp; Explosive Research Center at Missouri S&amp;T.

There are two similar but smaller megaliths showing the same silhouette on each side of the sidewalk entrance to the Rock Mechanics &amp; Explosive Research Center.

===Curtis Laws Wilson Library===
The Curtis Laws Wilson Library is the main academic library on the campus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.mst.edu Curtis Laws Wilson Library]. Missouri S&amp;T. ''URL retrieved April 4, 2007''.&lt;/ref&gt; The library is open from 8:00 A.M. to midnight each day.  The third floor of the library is strictly a quiet study area with multiple rooms circling around the main area. The IT Helpdesk Walk-In Center for campus is located in the library on the first floor. A snack bar is also located in the back left corner of the first floor and recently celebrated its two year anniversary.

=== Student Engineering Projects ===
The Student Design &amp; Experiential Learning Center (SDELC)&lt;ref name=SDELC&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://design.mst.edu/index.html |title=Student Design &amp; Experiential Learning Center |work=design.mst.edu |publisher=Missouri University of Science and Technology |accessdate=July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; was established in 2000 to better support the various multi-disciplinary student design teams. In 2004, the Center's mission expanded to provide experiential learning in academic courses, identify and support student service learning projects within the curriculum, and support ad-hoc student teams in specialty academic events involving multi-disciplinary student research.

By 2006 the SDELC had expanded to ten student design teams. The center's expanded mission involved better funding and offering support and resources to multi-disciplinary project teams that had a research base to their activities. The SDELC provided academic credit opportunities in the form of three, one-hour classes on design, leadership and communication. The center also offers a half-credit course on experiential design through the Residential College (RC) program which has a per-semester enrollment of over 100 students engaged in hands-on learning projects. The SDELC's student design teams, research teams and projects, and academic courses are the foundation of experiential learning at Missouri S&amp;T.&lt;ref name=SDELC/&gt;

They also promote scholarship and leadership amongst their members.

Fraternities at Missouri S&amp;T include: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Beta Sigma Psi]], [[Delta Lambda Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Phi]] ([http://deltasig.mst.edu Delta Epsilon Chapter]), [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Theta Xi]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Phi Kappa Theta]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], and [[Triangle Fraternity|Triangle]]. Sororities on campus include: [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Zeta Tau Alpha]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Phi Sigma Rho]], [[Chi Omega]].

=== Traditions ===

[[St. Patrick's Day]] is the largest annual celebration and predominant cultural event at Missouri S&amp;T, with each year's observance touted as the &quot;Best Ever!&quot;. During St. Pat's, students wear green sweatshirts (which are sold as fund-raisers throughout the season), carry [[shillelagh (weapon)|shillelagh]]s and [[party]] (including drinking green beer). One tradition, observed primarily among fraternities, is the &quot;killing&quot; of rubber snakes in commemoration of [[St. Patrick]]'s mythical banishing of snakes from [[Ireland]]. Along with snake invasion comes the tradition of Follies. Students meet daily at &quot;the Puck&quot; (a short cylindrical stage bearing a large shamrock) to hear jokes and participate in short competitions. On the third day of Follies, students move to the town's band-shell to participate in the ceremonial arrival of St. Pat's Court. The day after Follies, students participate in &quot;Gonzo and Games&quot;. Gonzo and Games are two days of elaborate games in which different organizations compete. Friday of St. Pat's week is concluded with [[Coronation]], a ceremony where the Queen of Love and Beauty is announced. The final event of St. Pat's week is a Saturday morning parade on Pine Street, which is painted green by St. Pat's Board Alumni. This parade is known throughout the United States and boasts well over one hundred floats and participating groups. The rationale for the celebration is the notion that St. Patrick is the [[patron saint]] of engineers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
