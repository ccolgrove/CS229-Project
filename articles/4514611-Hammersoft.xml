The album was met with mixed reactions. Reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia of [[Allmusic]] gave the album a 1.5 of 5 saying &quot;Dark Angel's arrogantly titled debut We Have Arrived is as primitive as it gets.&quot; and &quot;The album will only interest serious thrash enthusiasts.&quot; 

An anonymous reviewer from [[Metal Storm]] gave the album a 7.3 of 10 rating saying &quot;It is good, aggressive thrash metal, with rather varied riffs.&quot;
