'''Whittier''' is a city in [[Los Angeles County, California]] about {{convert|12|mi|km|0}} southeast of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The city had a population of 85,331 at the 2010 census, up from 83,680 as of the 2000 census, and encompasses 14.7 square miles (38.0 square kilometers). Like nearby [[Montebello, CA|Montebello]], the city constitutes part of the [[Gateway Cities]]. Whittier was incorporated in February 1898, although it was first settled in 1887, and became a [[charter city]] in 1955.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofwhittier.org/ |title=Whitter Web - Homepage |publisher=Cityofwhittier.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city is named for the poet [[John Greenleaf Whittier]] and is home to [[Whittier College]].

==History==
Whittier's roots can be traced to Spanish soldier [[Manuel Nieto]].&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;&gt;[http://www.cityofwhittier.org/content/AW01.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1784, Nieto received a [[Spain|Spanish]] land grant of {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}}, [[Rancho Los Nietos]], as a reward for his military service and to encourage settlement in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt; The area of Nieto's land grant was reduced in 1790 as the result of a dispute with [[Mission San Gabriel]].  Nonetheless, Nieto still had claim to {{convert|167000|acre|km2|-1}} stretching from the hills north of Whittier, [[Fullerton, California|Fullerton]] and [[Brea, California|Brea]], south to the Pacific ocean, and from what is known today as the [[Los Angeles River]] east to the [[Santa Ana River]]. Nieto built a rancho for his family near  Whittier, and purchased cattle and horses for his ranch and also planted cornfields. When Nieto died in 1804,  his children inherited their father's property.
[[Image:Whittier old.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Whittier, California, late 19th century]]
At the time of the [[Mexican-American War]], much of Whittier was owned by [[Pio Pico]], a rancher and the last Mexican governor of California.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt; Pio Pico built an hacienda in Whittier on the San Gabriel River, which today is known as [[Pio Pico State Historic Park]]&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;  Following the Mexican-American war, German immigrant [[Jacob F. Gerkens]] paid $234 to the U.S. government to acquire {{convert|160|acre|km2|1}} of land under the [[Homestead Act]] and built a cabin  known today as the Jonathan Bailey House. Gerkens would later become the first chief of police of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]]. Gerkens' land was owned by several others before a group of Quakers purchased it and expanded it to {{convert|1259|acre|km2|0}}, with the intent of founding a Quaker community. The area soon became known as a thriving citrus ranching region, with &quot;Quaker Brand&quot; fruit being shipped all over the United States. Later, walnut trees were also planted, and Whittier became the largest walnut grower in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;  In addition to walnuts and citrus, Whittier was also a major producer of [[pampas grass]].

[[Southern Pacific Railroad]] built the first railroad spur to Whittier in 1887.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt; The railroad spur helped promote the boom of the 1880s. By 1906, 650 carloads of oranges and 250 carloads of lemons were shipped annually by rail.  In 1904, the [[Pacific Electric]] opened the trolley line known as &quot;Big Red Cars&quot; from Los Angeles to Whittier. In the first two decades over a million passengers a year rode to and from Los Angeles on the Whittier line.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt; Groves of walnuts were planted  in 1887 and  eventually Whittier was known as the primary walnut growing town in the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;History&quot;/&gt;
After [[World War II]] Whittier grew rapidly and the sub-dividing of orange groves began, driven by housing shortages in southern California. In 1955 the new Civic Center complex was completed and the City Council met in new chambers for the first time on March 8, 1955. The City continued to grow as the City annexed portions of Whittier Boulevard and East Whittier, the 1961 annexation added over 28,000 people to the population, bringing the total to about 67,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;

===Origin of name===
[[Image:Jonathan Bailiey House, Whittier.JPG|thumb|left|150px|Jonathan Bailey House]]
In the founding days of Whittier, when it was a small isolated town, Jacob Bailey and his wife, Rebecca, were among the first residents. They followed the [[Quaker]] religion, and held religious meetings on their porch. As the city grew, the citizens named it after [[John Greenleaf Whittier]], a respected Quaker [[poet]]. Whittier wrote a dedication poem, and is honored today with statues and a small exhibit at the Whittier museum; a statue of him sits in the park, and another representing his poem ''The Barefoot Boy'' used to reside by the City Hall.   Whittier never set foot there, but the city still bears his name and is rooted in the Quaker tradition.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;

===College history===
In 1887 the Pickering Land and Water Company set aside a {{convert|20|acre|m2|adj=on}} parcel of land for the development of a college, but a collapse in the land boom stalled construction. Progress on developing a college was sporadic, but on July 30, 1896 the Whittier Academy, operating since 1891, officially changed its name to [[Whittier College]] with 100 students enrolled.  The school mascot is &quot;The Poet.&quot;  By 1906, Whittier College was an educational institution with laboratories, boarding halls, a large gymnasium and athletic fields. Due to an economic depression in the 1890s, the first bachelors degrees were not awarded at the college for 17 years.&lt;ref name=&quot;city&quot;/&gt;

The Mendenhall Building at Whittier College was donated by Leona May Mendenhall in honor of her husband Oscar. The Mendenhalls were among the founding families of Whittier. Oscar's brother, Samuel Mendenhall, helped bring in the water system and post office. The Mendenhalls were large growers for [[Sunkist Growers, Incorporated|Sunkist]] oranges and [[Blue Diamond Growers|Blue Diamond]] walnuts.

===Quaker history in Whittier===
The first Quaker meeting house was built on the corner of Comstock Avenue and Wardman Street in 1887. The meeting soon outgrew this 100 seat meeitng house and new, larger building was erected on the corner of Philadelphia Street and Washington Avenue in 1902. By 1912, membership had grown to 1,200 and a third building was dedicated on the same site in 1917. With a capacity of 1,700, the 1917 meeting house featured a balcony and was constructed of brick with mahogany paneling and pews. The present meeting house, dedicated in 1975, features many architectural elements and materials from the 1917 building including the stained glass windows and mahogany interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nelson|first=Carl|title=Whittier Friends Church: Eighty-Eight Years of Service|year=1975|publisher=First Friends Church|location=Library of William Wright|pages=2â9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whittier Narrows earthquake===
On Oct. 1, 1987, at 7:42 a.m., the [[Whittier Narrows earthquake]] struck, the epicenter six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) north by northwest of Whittier. The seismic event, which registered 5.9 on the Richter scale, resulted in eight casualties and massive damage to uptown Whittier's historic buildings. Three days later , on 4th Oct 1987 , @ 03:59 , a major aftershock ( 5.2 ) hit causing further damage . Buildings and residential structures which were already borderline unsafe were now deemed unsafe / uninhabitable . In the years following the earthquake, the city's deteriorating uptown business district, which suffered substantial damage in the earthquake, became the focus of renewed development, which met with opposition from many Whittier citizens. Out of the rubble of the earthquake the [[Whittier Conservancy]] was formed in 1987 in an effort to stop the demolition of many historic buildings and residences after the disaster. The city also created a [[Historic Resources Commission]] to oversee the approval of historic designations, historic districts and [[Mills Act]] proposals.

==Police and fire departments==
===Police===
The Whittier Police Department provides patrol service to the communities of Whittier and Santa Fe Springs. Currently, over 100&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whittierdailynews.com/ci_16442382 |title=New era for Police Department |publisher=Whittier Daily News |date= |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; officers are assigned to patrol the city streets.  The Patrol Division includes the Traffic Bureau, Special Enforcement Team, Code Enforcement, and School Resource Officers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whittierpd.org/aboutpatrol.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The Police Services Division consists of the Records Bureau, [[9-1-1]] Communications Center, Property and Evidence, and the Jail. The Services Division operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, staffing communications and records functions around the clock.  This permits continuous support to patrol and investigational activities.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whittierpd.org/aboutservices.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, the dedication of the new, spacious police station was held. It is a {{convert|53000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility, built at a cost of $35 million.  Police Chief David Singer said he has been working towards a new station since 2002, but the project has been in the works for three decades, because the old station, built in 1955, at only {{convert|20000|sqft|m2}}  was so small. Voters had previously rejected a raise in their utility tax, so the delay in building was a matter of finding funding. Included in the new station is a more modern jail, air conditioning, upgraded radio and 9-1-1 communications systems and more space for the department offices and private interview rooms.  Chief Singer celebrated his efforts by retiring that day, and leaving behind the attractive new building for his officers and  community.&lt;ref name=&quot;Whit&quot;/&gt;

==Library==
On April 17, 1900, the Whittier Public Library Board of Trustees held its first meeting in Landrum Smith's drugstore. With an initial collection of 60 books and 200 magazines, the library facilities began in the Woody Building as a reading room, maintained by Mr. Hester in exchange for space for his telegraph office. In 1907, a Carnegie grant funded the construction of the building at Bailey and Greenleaf that many Whittierites fondly remember. As the city expanded, a larger library was needed, and the Friends of the Library organized in 1956 to raise money for a new building. Through their efforts, and those of the board members, librarians, and citizen fund raising groups, the new library was completed at the Washington Avenue site in May 1959. In 1968, service was further expanded with the construction of the Whittwood Branch Library on Santa Gertrudes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whittierlibrary.org/about_the_library.html ]{{dead link|date=March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&quot;My Name I Give To Thee&quot;'''&lt;br /&gt;
''Dear Town, for whom the flowers are born,&lt;br /&gt;
''Stars shine, and happy songbirds sing,&lt;br /&gt;
