'''Franklin Runyon Sousley''' (September 19, 1925 â March 21, 1945) was one of the six men in the famous [[photograph]] of United States Marines [[raising the flag on Iwo Jima]] in [[World War II]].

==Childhood==
Sousley was born in Hilltop, [[Fleming County, Kentucky]], the second child born to Merle Duke Sousley (1899â1934) and Goldie Mitchell (1905â1988). When he was three years old, his five-year-old brother, Malcolm Brooks Sousley (1923â1928), died due to [[appendicitis]].  Franklin attended a two-room schoolhouse in nearby Elizaville, and attended Fleming County High School in nearby [[Flemingsburg]] from ninth to twelfth grade. His younger brother Julian was born in May 1933, and his father died due to [[diabetes]] complications a year later, at age 35. At only nine years old, Franklin was the sole male-figure in the family, and assisted his mother in raising Julian. Julian died in a car accident on 4 October 1951, at the age of 18.

==Military service==

Sousley graduated from Fleming County High School in May 1943, and resided in [[Dayton, Ohio]] as a worker in a refrigeration factory. He received his draft notice, and chose to join the [[United States Marine Corps]] in early 1944, and underwent extensive combat training as a member of the [[U.S. 5th Marine Division]]. Sousley landed on [[Battle of Iwo Jima|Iwo Jima]] in February 1945, and participated in the battle for the island. Alongside [[John Bradley (Iwo Jima)|John Bradley]], [[Ira Hayes]], [[Rene Gagnon]], [[Harlon Block]], and [[Michael Strank]], he assisted in raising a replacement flag on [[Mount Suribachi]], an iconic photograph immortalized by [[Joe Rosenthal]]. 

Sousley was to be returned to [[Washington, D.C.]] for a [[War bond]] tour alongside John Bradley and Rene Gagnon. (At that time Gagnon, under threat from Ira Hayes, had not revealed Hayes' participation in the flag raising.)  According to ''[[Shadow of Suribachi: Raising the Flags on Iwo Jima]]'' by Parker Bishop Albee, Jr. and Keller Cushing Freeman, when the word reached Iwo Jima, Sousley was on a dangerous part of the island, and his company commander, Captain Dave Severance, decided it was safer to leave him where he was than attempt an extrication under the conditions.

==Death in battle==
According to [[James Bradley (author)|James Bradley]]'s ''[[Flags of Our Fathers]]'', on March 21, 1945, [[Private First Class|PFC]] Sousley was shot in the back by a Japanese [[sniper]], as he was walking down an open road on the nearly-secured island. A fellow Marine witnessed Sousley lying on the ground and asked, &quot;How bad are you hit?&quot;  Sousley's reply and last words were reportedly, &quot;Not bad, I can't feel a thing.&quot;  However, [[Ron Elliott (author)|Ron Elliott]]'s ''[[From Hilltop to Mountaintop]]'' shows an affidavit signed by Rene Gagnon reporting that &quot;Sousley was killed instantly.&quot;  Originally buried on the island of Iwo Jima, his remains were reinterred on May 8, 1947, in Elizaville Cemetery in Fleming County, Kentucky.
