<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="3274786" ns="0" title="Beheading video"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Beheading video''' is a colloquial term in the U.S. popularized during the &quot;[[War on Terror]]&quot; for videos released by [[Islamist]] militant groups depicting interviews by hostages taken by said groups.  The prelude to these videos usually show the subject alive and pleading for their lives sometimes accompanied by their captors, sometimes not.  The demands made are usually broad and general, such as total withdrawal of the hostage's nation's military forces from a particular Middle Eastern country, usually [[Iraq]]. Invariably a video depicting the actual beheading is released a few days later.&lt;ref&gt;Stannard, Matthew B. [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/c/a/2004/05/13/MNG6E6KL791.DTL Beheading video seen as war tactic].&quot; ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Thursday May 13, 2004. Retrieved on November 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

These videos are often uploaded to the internet by alleged [[terrorists]] then discussed and distributed by traditional journalistic media or by web-based outlets such as [[blogs]] and [[shock sites]].

==Hoax==
A hoax beheading video by Benjamin Vanderford received wide attention by the American press.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5629119/ American fakes own decapitation in tape ].&quot; ''[[Associated Press]]'' at ''[[MSNBC]]''. August 7, 2004. Retrieved on November 23, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The creators of the video claimed to have released the video to point out how uncritically the mainstream media  would accept an anonymous video (the video turned up on U.S. media outlets immediately).
