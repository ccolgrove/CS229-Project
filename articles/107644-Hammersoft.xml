'''La Mirada''' is a city in southeast [[Los Angeles County]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csac.counties.org/default.asp?id=49 Cities Within Each County], California State Association of Counties&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityoflamirada.org/factsht.htm City of La Mirada Web Site Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; [[California]], [[United States]], and is one of the [[Gateway Cities]]. The population was 48,527 at the 2010 census, up from 46,783 at the 2000 census.

It is the home of [[Biola University]] (formerly the [[Bible Institute of Los Angeles]]), an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] institution of higher education. It is also the home of the [[La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts]].

The city of La Mirada was listed on CNN [[Money Magazine]]'s âBest Place to Liveâ list. La Mirada placed 34th on the list, with the La Mirada Theatre for the Performing Arts and the Splash! La Mirada Regional Aquatics Center as two of its main attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Best Places to Live: Top 100 | url = http://money.cnn.com/galleries/2007/moneymag/0707/gallery.BPTL_top_100.moneymag/34.html | accessdate = 2008-10-15 | work=CNN | first1=Kate | last1=Ashford | first2=Andrea | last2=Bartz | first3=Jeff | last3=Cox | first4=Asa | last4=Fitch | first5=Stephen | last5=Gandel | first6=Josh | last6=Hyatt | first7=Rob | last7=Kelley | first8=Kathleen | last8=Knight | first9=Joe | last9=Light}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
La Mirada ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''The View'') was the creation of two men, [[Andrew McNally]], a printer and mapmaker from Chicago (see [[Rand McNally]]) and his son-in-law Edwin Neff.

In 1888, McNally purchased over {{convert|2200|acre|km2}} of [[Rancho Los Coyotes]],&lt;ref name=&quot;History of La Mirada&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title = History of La Mirada | url = http://www.cityoflamirada.org/history.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-15 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080530212144/http://www.cityoflamirada.org/history.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; south of [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], for $200,000. He developed {{convert|700|acre|km2}} into his own home called [[McNally's Windermere Ranch Headquarters|Windermere Ranch]] and surrounded it with olive, orange and lemon groves. McNally built a plant to process the olive oil, which was of the best quality, as well as a railroad station on Stage Road.  From here his olive oil and fruit were shipped all over the U.S.

In 1896, McNally turned his property over to his daughter and his son in law. McNally and Neff formed the La Mirada Land Company, which published a booklet entitled &quot;The Country Gentleman in California&quot;, advertising parcels of land for sale including pictures, a map and descriptions of the scenic olive, alfalfa, lemon and grapefruit groves.

In 1946, &quot;Along Your Way&quot;, a &quot;Station by Station Description of the Santa Fe Route Through the Southwest,&quot; describes La Mirada with a population of 213, surrounded by orange, lemon, walnut and olive groves; oil wells; olive oil factory; and fruit packing houses.

The city received a lot of attention for the fact that it was going to be completely structured and planned out. Referred to as &quot;the Nation's completely planned city&quot; during the early 1950s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Postcard from State Fair | url = http://ourlamirada.com/lamirada/modelhome1953.html/history.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the city of La Mirada received a lot of attention from the [[California State Fair|State Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 1953 State Fair Article | url = http://ourlamirada.com/lamirada/calstatefair1953.html/history.htm | accessdate = 2008-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fair praised the city for planning for the future while still maintaining practicality for today.

In 1953, the land was sold to subdivisions for 5.2 million dollars, one of the largest real estate transactions in California. By 1960, the year the city was incorporated, La Mirada had grown from a mere 100 homes to over 8,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;History of La Mirada&quot;/&gt; The city was incorporated as &quot;Mirada Hills&quot; on March 23, 1960. On  November 8, 1960, voters approved a change of name to the current La Mirada, which was officially certified on December 15, 1960.

Today, the current population is just over 50,000 with the addition of a new subdivision on the eastern portion of the town.

Calderon]], and in the 60th [[California State Assembly|Assembly]] District, represented by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Curt Hagman]]. Federally, La Mirada is located in [[California's 39th congressional district]], which has a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index|Cook PVI]] of D +13&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Will Gerrymandered Districts Stem the Wave of Voter Unrest? | publisher = Campaign Legal Center Blog | url=http://www.clcblog.org/blog_item-85.html | accessdate = 2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is represented by Democrat [[Linda SÃ¡nchez]].

The city is governed by a five-member [[council-manager government]], each elected [[at-large]] (i.e., by the entire city's voting population, not by districts) to four year terms. Each year the five members vote one of themselves to be the Mayor and Mayor Pro Tem.

The [[Los Angeles County Department of Health Services]] operates the Whittier Health Center in [[Whittier, California|Whittier]], serving La Mirada.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://publichealth.lacounty.gov/phn/docs/HealthCenter/whittier.pdf Whittier Health Center].&quot; [[Los Angeles County Department of Health Services]]. Retrieved on March 18, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emergency services===
The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) operates the Norwalk Station in [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]], serving La Mirada.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.lasd.org/stations/for3/norwalk/index.html Norwalk Station].&quot; [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. Retrieved on January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition the department operates the La Mirada Substation.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.lasd.org/stations/for3/norwalk/lamirada.html La Mirada Substation].&quot; [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. Retrieved on January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwalk Station is also responsible for providing contracted police services to the city of Norwalk as well as [[unincorporated area|unincorporated]] [[South Whittier, California|South Whittier]]. The department has a substation in La Mirada located adjacent to City Hall. Many deputies assigned to La Mirada drive [[patrol car]]s marked with the La Mirada logo, but wear Los Angeles County uniforms.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The city also employs a civilian Public Safety team to support the LASD. Public Safety Officers are unarmed and do not have [[arrest]] powers. They carry out ancillary duties such as issuing animal/bicycle licenses, fingerprinting, and writing reports on non-hazardous matters (e.g., forgery, vandalism). They are also charged with enforcing parking and municipal codes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

Fire protection and [[paramedic]] services are provided by the [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] (LACoFD). The department maintains [[fire station|Station]] #49 in La Mirada adjacent to City Hall, provides coverage to the central parts of the city. Station 49 also serves as the headquarters for Battalion 21.

In May 2010 a second fire station, #194 opened at 1401 S. Beach Blvd. at the east city boundary it shares with [[La Habra]]. The placement of the new station filled a gap in coverage for the newer Hillsborough neighborhoods that were built several decades after Station 49 was built.

Funding for construction of Station 194 was shared equally by the fire department and the city of [[La Habra]], which benefits at having a fourth engine company in its city limits at no further expense after the station opened.

Land constraints necessitated a unique two-story firehouse design which will initially house one engine company and four personnel including one paramedic. 

Personnel for Engine 194 were obtained without adding any budgeted firefighter positions. 12 of the 27 firefighters positions at the [[Los Angeles County]] fire station near [[La Mirada]] City Hall at the time were shifted to a temporary station 194 when La Habra disbanded it's municipal fire agency in 2005 in favor of becoming a contract city. 

The construction of the new fire station which was a key component of this agreement was completed in just over four years after a series of design and construction delays. Neighborhoods in eastern La Mirada that once experienced six minute response times can be reached in three minutes or less today.

Crews from two nearby stations also include parts of [[La Mirada]] as their first-in district. Engine 35 stationed in [[Cerritos]] on Artesia Blvd covers most of the industrail areas of the city that are south of [[Interstate 5]].  

Station 15 located in [[East La Mirada]] on Santa Gertrudes Avenue handles the north and northeast sections of town. The four person crew assigned to [[Quint]] 15 now staff the only truck company in the area. In addition to ladder truck duties a [[Quint]] also has the ability to pump water at a fire.  Prior to the 2005 reduction of staff at the La Mirada Blvd station there was a truck staffed as well as the engine and paramedic squad currently staffed.

==Education==
[[Public education]] in a majority of La Mirada is governed by the [[Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District]], headquartered in neighboring [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]]. La Mirada has one public secondary school, [[La Mirada High School]]

The Creek Park and Granada Heights neighborhoods in northern La Mirada are within the boundaries of the [[East Whittier City School District]] K - 8th grade, the [[Whittier Union High School District]], and [[Rio Hondo College]] District all with campuses in nearby Whittier..

Several [[private school]]s are located in La Mirada:
* St. Paul of the Cross School in the Foster Park neighborhood
* Beatitudes of Our Lord School

The city is home to one private [[higher education]] institution, [[Biola University]].

==Transportation==
La Mirada's main arterial streets are Rosecrans Avenue and [[Imperial Highway]]. Valley View Avenue, La Mirada Boulevard, and Santa Gertrudes Avenue are other important arterials. [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate 5]] passes through the southwest corner of the city, while [[California State Route 39|Beach Boulevard (CA-39)]] passes through the east end of the city.

Freight [[railroad]] traffic through the city is handled by [[BNSF Railway]] on its [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] in the southwest portion of the city. [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] operates [[commuter rail]] service on this right-of-way; the nearest stations to La Mirada are [[Buena Park (Metrolink station)|Buena Park]] and [[Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs (Metrolink station)|Norwalk/Santa Fe Springs]].
