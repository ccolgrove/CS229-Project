The '''Nevada Senate''' is the [[upper house]] of the [[Nevada Legislature]], the [[state legislature (United States)|state legislature]] of [[U.S. state]] of [[Nevada]]. The Senate consists of 21 members from 19 districts, two of which are multimember. Each senator represented approximately 94,700 people as of the [[United States Census, 2000|2000 census]], although 2006 [[United States Census Bureau|Census Bureau]] estimates suggest an average population of 118,800 per senator. Senators serve four-year terms. [[Term limits in the United States|Term limits]], limiting senators to three 4-year terms (12 years), took effect in 2010. Seven senators were termed out in 2010 and four will be termed out in 2012.

The Senate met at the [[Nevada State Capitol]] in [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]] until 1971, when a separate Legislative Building was constructed south of the Capitol.  The Legislative Building was expanded in 1997 to its current appearance to accommodate the growing Legislature.  

==Composition==
:''76th Legislature (2011-2012)''

The President Pro Tempore is elected to the position by the majority party. The other partisan Senate leadership positions, such as the [[Majority Leader|Majority]] and [[Minority Leader|Minority]] leaders, are elected by their respective party caucuses to head their parties in the chamber.

The [[President of the Senate]] is [[Lieutenant Governor of Nevada|Nevada Lieutenant Governor]] [[Brian Krolicki]] of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

The Secretary of the Senate is [[David Byerman]].  The Secretary of the Senate serves as the Parliamentarian and Chief Administrative Officer of the Nevada Senate.&lt;ref name=&quot;NNB&quot;&gt;[http://www.nevadanewsbureau.com/2010/08/18/nevada-senate-majority-leader-picks-census-bureau-liaison-to-serve-in-top-administrative-post/] http://www.nevadanewsbureau.com/2010/08/18/nevada-senate-majority-leader-picks-census-bureau-liaison-to-serve-in-top-administrative-post/&lt;/ref&gt;  The Secretary of the Senate is a non-member officer of the body, elected by the members.
