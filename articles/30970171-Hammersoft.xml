|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The service runs hourly Monday-Saturday daytime on its full route and also runs hourly to Diggle via Dobcross. The two hourly journeys are complemented by an additional two journeys an hour between Uppermill and Manchester. Combined with its sister service, the '''180''', which runs between [[Greenfield, Greater Manchester|Greenfield]] and Manchester, there is a service every 10 minutes between [[Greenfield railway station]] and Manchester. During evenings, the 184 runs an hourly service between Uppermill and Manchester and during the day on Sundays, the service run on from Uppermill to Huddersfield every two hours.

== History ==
The service started as the 14 on 15 May 1929, running between Uppermill and Manchester and was operated by '''Oldham, Manchester and North Western'''. A couple of months later, the 13 (later re-numbered 183) was introduced running between Uppermill and Manchester via [[Delph]], with journeys running as a 13 changing into a 14 at Uppermill and vice-versa&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;

|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the years, the service did not go through many changes to the service, with its only changes being the terminus in Manchester, using Lower Mosley Street, Parker Street, Chorlton Street and Piccadilly Gardens, and the name of the operator, which changed from North Western to SELNEC (during which was re-numbered to 184), and then to Greater Manchester Transport and to Greater Manchester Buses.

Following [[bus deregulation in Great Britain]] on 26 October 1986, the route was taken over by [[GM Buses]]. On 31 December 1993, GM Buses was split into two, GM Buses North and GM South Buses, the former of which became the main operator of the 184 route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.selnec.org.uk/gmt_beyond.htm |title=Greater Manchester Transport And Beyond |publisher=The SELNEC Preservation Society |accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1996, GM Buses North was bought by [[First Group]] and was originally renamed '''Greater Manchester Firstbus''' before eventually changing its name to [[First Manchester]]. In 2001, the service was extended from Uppermill to Diggle via Dobcross, replacing the 427, which was an all-stopping equivalent to the 184. The extension saw the end of the workings with the 183, which was extended to Greenfield to compensate for the loss&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;.

In October 2004, the 184 underwent its biggest change, changing from an hourly express service, to an all-stopping service, running four buses an hour between Uppermill and Manchester, with one bus an hour extending to Diggle via Dobcross, while one bus an hour extended to Huddersfield via Marsden, replacing the [[West Yorkshire]] service 365&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;. Due to the length of the route, First Manchester would jointly run the Huddersfield service with First West Yorkshire, alternating between the two operators every two hours (First Manchester ran the first two journeys to Huddersfield, First West Yorkshire ran the first two journeys from Huddersfield).

The Huddersfield route ran slightly differently from the 365 route, as the 184 ran into Diggle village instead of by-passing it via Standedge Road and also originally diverted via Hard End in Marsden&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot; /&gt;. The Hard End diversion stayed in played until January 2005. A Sunday service to Huddersfield was introduced in April 2006, replacing [[Speedwellbus]]'s 365 Sunday service. This meant in an 18 month period, the Huddersfield-Oldham route had changed from the 365 to the 184.

== Route ==
=== Uppermill-Manchester ===
The service begins near to [[Piccadilly Gardens]] on Oldham Street. From here, it runs out along the [[A62 road (England)|A62]], travelling through [[Newton Heath]], [[Failsworth]] and [[Hollinwood, Greater Manchester|Hollinwood]]. The service then turns off the A62 onto Hollins Road into Oldham town centre before continuing via [[Lees, Greater Manchester|Lees]], [[Grotton]], [[Grasscroft]] into [[Uppermill]] terminating outside the Commercial Hotel and using the nearby turning circle to return to Manchester. Journeys that terminate at Uppermill are wholly run by First Manchester&lt;ref name=&quot;route1&quot;&gt;

|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Diggle-Manchester ===
Services that terminate at Diggle follow the same route to Uppermill before running via the village of [[Dobcross]] and into Diggle via Huddersfield Road, before terminating at the old railway station, using the turning circle to return to Manchester. These journeys are only run by First Manchester&lt;ref name=&quot;route1&quot; /&gt;.

=== Huddersfield-Manchester ===
Services to Huddersfield follow the same route to Uppermill before running a different route to Diggle than the terminating services in Diggle, by running via Wool Road and through Diggle before returning onto the A62 into West Yorkshire via [[Marsden, West Yorkshire|Marsden]], [[Slaithwaite]] and [[Cowlersley]] before terminating in [[Huddersfield]] at the bus station. The service runs hourly Monday-Saturday daytime by First Manchester and First West Yorkshire and every two hours Sunday daytime by First Manchester only &lt;ref name=&quot;route1&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Vehicles ==
The main type of vehicle used on First Manchester journeys on service 184 are [[Volvo B9TL]]'s, which were acquired in 2009. Most of the buses have route branding for the 184&lt;ref&gt;

|accessdate=16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its sister service, the 180. The main alternative vehicle used by First Manchester on the route is [[Volvo B7RLE]]'s, which were the previous prominent vehicle on the route and also had route branding&lt;ref&gt;

First West Yorkshire also use B9TL's on their workings of the 184. Two buses were obtained from First Manchester to be primarily used on the 184&lt;ref&gt;
