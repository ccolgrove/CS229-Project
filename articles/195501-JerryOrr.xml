==Organizational information==
On behalf of the Center for Media and Democracy, the Center's then-Research Director [[Sheldon Rampton]] started SourceWatch on January 15, 2003 and launched it publicly with 200 articles created by the Center on March 10, 2003.  According to SourceWatch's own statistics, it included almost 50,000 articles as of August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:Purpose.&lt;/ref&gt; The site's content is licensed under the [[GNU Free Documentation License]].

The publisher of SourceWatch is Lisa Graves, the [[executive director]] of the [[Center for Media and Democracy]] and the [[managing editor]] of the site is Anne Landman.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:ContactSourceWatch (accessed August 29, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editorial and security policies==
The stated goals for registered users who are permitted to edit SourceWatch are &quot;accuracy and fairness&quot;.&lt;ref name=artguide&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:Article_guidelines SourceWatch: Article guidelines&quot;], ''SourceWatch'', accessed June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its editorial guidelines stress the importance of maintaining the accuracy of its source citations and admonish its editors to create articles that are &quot;fair, accurate, and documented&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:Contributing (accessed August 30, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sourcewatch is available on the web as a [[wiki]], maintained by a community of interested users worldwide. When SourceWatch began, any visitor to the site could edit existing articles and create new ones. In April 2006, however, SourceWatch changed its policy, requiring users to register and log in before editing its articles and restricting unregistered visitors to reading articles only.&lt;ref name=edpol&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:Editorial_policy &quot;Editorial policy,&quot;] ''SourceWatch'', last updated December 20, 2009, accessed April 20, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Center for Media and Democracy]] sets the editorial and &quot;security policies&quot; under which SourceWatch operates. SourceWatch provides recommended editorial guidelines to its users. Some users, designated as &quot;sysops&quot;, can protect individual articles so that they can be edited only by other sysops, as in [[Wikipedia]]. Sysops can also block other users.&lt;ref name=edpol/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fix&gt;For further information about editing and security policies, see also: [http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:How_Fix_An_Error &quot;SourceWatch: How to Fix an Error&quot;], ''SourceWatch'': &quot;Errors and Complaints&quot;, and [http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:Editorial_policy#Security &quot;Security&quot;], both accessed June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mission statement===
According to SourceWatch, it aims:
&lt;blockquote&gt;to produce a directory of the people, organizations and issues shaping the public agenda.  A primary purpose of SourceWatch is documenting the [[Public relations|PR]] and [[propaganda]] activities of public relations firms and public relations professionals engaged in managing and manipulating public perception, opinion and policy. SourceWatch also includes profiles on [[think tanks]], industry-funded organizations and industry-friendly experts that work to influence [[public opinion]] and [[Policy|public policy]] on behalf of [[corporation]]s, [[government]]s and [[lobby group]]s. Over time, SourceWatch has broadened to include others involved in public debates including [[mass media|media outlets]], [[journalist]]s and [[Government agency|government agencies]]. Unlike some other [[wikis]], SourceWatch has a policy of strict referencing, and is overseen by a paid editor.&lt;ref name=AboutHist&gt;[http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=SourceWatch:About#History About SourceWatch (Site history)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
