{{Politics of Malaysia}}

'''Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia''' ({{lang-ms|Timbalan Perdana Menteri Malaysia}}) is the second highest political office in [[Malaysia]]. There has been ten deputy prime ministers since the office was created in 1957. Although there has always been a Deputy Prime Minister since independence, there is nothing preventing a Prime Minister from not taking a Deputy, as the post itself is not mentioned in the [[Constitution of Malaysia]]. Likewise, it would not be impossible for there to be more than one Deputy Prime Minister, as has occurred before in [[Singapore]]. It was the first Prime Minister of Malaysia, [[Tunku Abdul Rahman]], who started the convention of appointing a Deputy Prime Minister.

Under an unwritten, tacit agreement among component parties of the ruling Barisan Nasional of which the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) is the principal party, the post of Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia is automatically attributed to the Deputy President of UMNO of the moment.  The current Deputy Prime Minister is [[Muhyiddin Yassin|Tan Sri Muhyiddin Yassin]], since April 10, 2009.

== Official residence ==
The official residence for Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia is Seri Satria in Putrajaya. Before Seri Satria, the first Deputy Prime Minister official residence is Seri Taman.
