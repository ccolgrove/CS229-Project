'''Code::Blocks''' is a [[free software|free]] and [[open source software|open source]], [[cross-platform]] [[Integrated Development Environment|IDE]] which supports multiple [[compilers]] including [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]] and [[MSVC]]. It is developed in [[C++]] using [[wxWidgets]] as the GUI toolkit. Using a plugin architecture, its capabilities and features are defined by the provided plugins.
Currently, Code::Blocks is oriented towards [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]]. It can also be used for creating [[ARM]], [[AVR]], [[D (programming language)|D]], [[DirectX]], [[FLTK]], [[Fortran]], GLFW, [[OpenGL Utility Toolkit|GLUT]], [[GTK+]], [[Irrlicht Engine|Irrlicht]], Lightfeather, [[MATLAB]], [[OGRE]], [[OpenGL]], [[Qt (framework)|Qt]], [[Simple DirectMedia Layer|SDL]], SFML, [[STL]], SmartWin and [[wxWidgets|wx]] programs and applications. Although, in some cases, the respective [[SDK]] of [[framework]] installation is required for development on a specific technology.

Code::Blocks is being developed for [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], and [[Mac OS X]] and has been ported to [[FreeBSD]].&lt;ref&gt;Code::Blocks in FreeBSD's ports collection: [http://www.freshports.org/devel/codeblocks/ devel/codeblocks].&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest stable version, Code::Blocks 10.05, was released on May 30, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php/topic,12644.msg85618/ Code::Blocks forum - 10.05 release announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

After releasing two release candidate versions, 1.0rc1 on July 25, 2005 and 1.0rc2 on October 25, 2005, instead of making a final release, the project developers started adding many new features, with the final release being repeatedly postponed. Instead, there were binary packages of the latest [[Subversion (software)|SVN]] version made available on a daily basis, called &quot;nightly builds&quot;. These were supported better than the latest official 1.0rc2 release. While this approach provided users with bleeding-edge improvements and allowed developers to get constant feedback, it created an outside illusion that the project was stagnant (because no new releases have been made).{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The first stable release was finally made on February 28, 2008, with the version number changed to 8.02. The versioning scheme was changed to that of [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], with the major and minor number representing the year and month of the release.

Instead of creating a branch in the code tree where bugs are fixed in the stable release and new features are added in a separate branch the project continued as before; new features and bug fixes are all added into the same code space. Version 10.05 is the latest stable release; however for the most up-to-date version, the user has to download the relatively stable &quot;[http://forums.codeblocks.org/index.php?board=20.0 nightly build]&quot;.

[[Jennic Limited]] distributes a version of Code::Blocks customized to work with its microcontrollers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jennic.com/jennic_support/user_guides/jn-ug-3028_codeblocks_ide JN-UG-3028 Code::Blocks IDE User Guide]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
===Compilers===
Code::Blocks supports multiple compilers, including [[MinGW]] / [[GNU Compiler Collection|GCC]], [[Digital Mars]], [[Visual C++|Microsoft Visual C++]], [[Borland C++]], [[Watcom C compiler|Watcom]], [[LCC (compiler)|LCC]] and the [[Intel C++ compiler]]. Although the IDE was designed for the C++ language, there is some support for compilers of other languages, including GNU Fortran, Digital Mars [[D (programming language)|D]] and [[GNU D Compiler|GNU GDC]]. Besides, the plug-in system can provide support for many programming languages.

===Code Editor===
The IDE features syntax highlighting and [[code folding]] through the use of the [[Scintilla (editing component)|Scintilla]] editor component, C++ code completion and class browser and an integrated to-do list. All of the open files are organized into tabs, which can be closed and opened at the user's will with the navigation pane or the close (X) button on the tabs. The code editor supports font and font size selection, this allows the user to choose the font and font size with which he is comfortable. In addition, it can provide specific syntax highlighting color theme that can be personalized.

===Debugger===
The Code::Blocks debugger has full breakpoint support. It also allows the user to debug their program by having access and using the local function symbol and argument display, user-defined watches, call stack, [[disassembly]], custom memory dump, thread switching, [[CPU]] registers, GNU [[GDB]] Interface and MS [[CDB]] (not fully supported yet).

===GUI Designer===
Code::Blocks comes with a [[GUI]] designer called wxSmith. It is a derivative version of [[wxWidgets]]. To make a complete wxWidgets application, the appropriate wx SDK must be installed with set environment variables.

===User Migration===
Some of Code::Blocks' features are targeted at users migrating from other IDEs - these include [[Dev-C++]] and Microsoft Visual C++ project import, and Dev-C++ Devpak support.

===Project Files and Build System===
Code::Blocks uses a custom build system, which stores its information in XML-based project files, but can optionally use external makefiles, which simplifies interfacing with projects using the GNU and [[Qt Software|Qt Software's]] [[qmake]] build systems.
