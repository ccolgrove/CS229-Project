'''Indlinux''' is a project that attempts to [[Software localization|localise]] tools used under Linux and other free software environments into all [[Indian languages]]. Indlinux is a combination of the words ''[[India]]'' and ''[[Linux]]''.

== Languages ==
The languages currently aimed at include [[Hindi]], [[Marathi language|Marathi]], [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Oriya language|Oriya]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Bengali language|Bengali]].

Support for most languages are ready with a Bengali distribution [[Ankur Bangla]], Tamil being included with quite a few Linux distributions with almost complete support and Hindi localization is also 90% complete. 

More languages are being pushed into mainstream distributions like [[Red Hat Linux]] which recently released [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]] 3 with complete support for Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Punjabi, and Tamil.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

There has been consistent updating of language related packages into other distributions like [[Mandriva]], [[SuSE]], and [[Debian]] too through this group of volunteers.
