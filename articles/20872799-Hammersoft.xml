The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Cincinnati Bengals]] season''' was the 40th season for the team in the [[National Football League]] and their 42nd overall. They finished the season at 10â6â0, and sweeping the entire AFC North division, they improved on their 2008 record of 4â11â1, winning the AFC North Division and making the playoffs for the first time since [[2005 Cincinnati Bengals season|2005]]. Their season ended with a 24â14 loss against the [[New York Jets]] in the AFC Wild Card Playoff Round.

The head coach was [[Marvin Lewis]], who has coached the team since 2003. He was chosen by the [[Associated Press]] as its [[National Football League Coach of the Year Award|NFL Coach of the Year]] following the season. Lewis was recognized for turning around the Bengals in the face of serious off-the-field adversity. First, three players were personally affected by the [[2009 Samoa earthquake|tsunami]] that hit [[American Samoa]] in late September. Shortly after this disaster, Vikki Zimmer, the wife of defensive coordinator [[Mike Zimmer]], unexpectedly died. Finally, wide receiver [[Chris Henry (wide receiver)|Chris Henry]], who suffered a season-ending injury in Week 9, died in December from injuries suffered when he fell from the back of a pickup truck during a domestic dispute.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis COY&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4831442 |title=Lewis named coach of year |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''ESPN.com'' |date=2010-01-16 |accessdate=2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Coming off the win the previous week in Green Bay, the Bengals faced the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers back home in Cincinnati. The game was scoreless until halfway into the opening quarter, when Steelers kicker Jeff Reed kicked a 19 yard field goal to put the Steelers on the scoreboard 3â0. 6 minutes later, Steelers QB Ben Roethlisberger threw a 27 yard touchdown pass to RB Willie Parker to increase Pittsburgh's lead to 10â0 at the end of the first quarter.

They would add to that lead 3 minutes into the second quarter with another field goal by Reed, this one from 24 yards. Not until the final seconds of the first half would the Bengals make a mark on the scoreboard, with a 34 yard field goal by Cincinnati K Shayne Graham. At halftime the score was 13â3.

In the second half, the Bengals took advantage of the Steelers mistakes, when Bengals CB Johnathan Joseph intercepted a Ben Roethlisberger pass, returning it 30 yards for a TD. The PAT would not be successful because of a bad snap by Bengals LS Brad St. Louis. The Bengals had cut down the Steeler lead to 4 points, 13â9. At the 3 minute mark in the third quarter the Steelers would extend the lead on a quarterback sneak by Roethlisberger to put Pittsburgh ahead by 11 points, 20â9.

In the fourth quarter, with 9 minutes left in the game, Bengals RB Cedric Benson ran 23 yards for a Bengals touchdown, cutting the deficit to 5 points, 20â15. In the final two minutes of the game, Bengals QB Carson Palmer drove his team down the field converting both fourth down opportunities, one being a 4th and 10 completion to RB Brian Leonard for 11 yards. With 18 seconds left in the game, on the Steeler 4, Carson Palmer threw a touchdown pass to WR Andre Caldwell, putting the Bengals in the lead for good, with a successful two-point conversion by Leonard.

With the win, not only did the Bengals improve to 2â1, but they acquired their first home victory against the Steelers since 2001.

Emerging from their divisional home win over the Steelers, the Bengals flew to [[Cleveland Browns Stadium]] for a Week 4 AFC North duel with the [[Cleveland Browns]] in Round 1 of 2009's [[Battle of Ohio (NFL)|Battle of Ohio]]. Cincinnati would start out fast in the first quarter with quarterback [[Carson Palmer]]'s 5-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Chad Ochocinco]].  In the second quarter, the Bengals would add to their lead with defensive end [[Robert Geathers]] returning a fumble 75 yards for a touchdown.  The Browns would then close out the half with quarterback [[Derek Anderson (American football)|Derek Anderson]]'s 1-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Steve Heiden]].

Cleveland would tie the game in the third quarter with Anderson's 1-yard touchdown run.  In the fourth quarter, the Browns would take the lead with kicker [[Billy Cundiff]]'s 26-yard and 31-yard field goals.  Afterwards, Cincinnati would tie the game with Palmer and Ochocinco hooking up with each other again on a 2-yard touchdown pass (yet the following PAT was blocked).  In a back-and-forth overtime, both Ohio teams fought each for possession.  In the end, the Bengals would emerge on top as kicker [[Shayne Graham]] kicked the game-winning 31-yard field goal.

With the win, Cincinnati improved to 3â1, and, with the [[2009 Baltimore Ravens season|Baltimore Ravens]] loss later that day, tied the Ravens for first place in the division.

Following this victory, the Bengals earned the nickname the &quot;Cardiac Cats&quot; for pulling through in the clutch and coming from behind in three straight games for a victory.

For three Bengals players, this game was overshadowed by events that took place thousands of miles away. [[Jonathan Fanene]], [[Rey Maualuga]], and [[Domata Peko]] all have family in [[American Samoa]], which was hit by [[2009 Samoa earthquake|a major tsunami]] the Tuesday before the game. All three struggled to contact their families in the aftermath of the disaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;Lewis COY&quot;/&gt;

Coming off their overtime win over the Browns, the Bengals looked to win for [[Defensive Coordinator]] [[Mike Zimmer]] who had lost his wife during the week as they flew to [[M&amp;T Bank Stadium]] for a Week 5 AFC North duel with the [[Baltimore Ravens]].  The winner of this game would take the lead in the division after five weeks.

After a scoreless first quarter, the Bengals would trail in the second quarter with Ravens safety [[Ed Reed]] returning an interception 52 yards for a touchdown.  Cincinnati would begin to build steam as kicker [[Shayne Graham]] nailed a 32-yard field goal.  The Bengals would take the lead in the third quarter with a 28-yard touchdown run from running back [[Cedric Benson]].

With the win, not only did the Bengals take the division lead at 4â1, but Benson (27 carries, 120 yards, 1 TD) would snap the Ravens defense's 40-game streak of not allowing a 100-yard rusher.

The Bengals would get on the board in the second quarter with running back [[Cedric Benson]]'s 10-yard touchdown run.  Houston would retake the lead with Schaub's 38-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Steve Slaton]], yet Cincinnati would get the halftime lead with quarterback [[Carson Palmer]]'s 8-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Laveranues Coles]] and kicker [[Shayne Graham]]'s 50-yard field goal.

However, the Texans struck back in the third quarter as Schaub completed a 23-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Jacoby Jones]], followed by a 7-yard touchdown pass to Daniels.  Try as they might, the offense could not produce another miraculous win as Houston's defense held on for the win.

Still looking to clinch the AFC North Division after a disappointing road loss in Minnesota, the Bengals traveled west to take on the San Diego Chargers at Quallcomm Stadium. During the week, Chris Henry had died, and to honor him, the team all wore the number 15 on their helmets. [[Chad Ochocinco]] paid tribute to his teammate by kneeling for a prayer after he scored a touchdown in the first quarter.

The Chargers were the first to score, when [[Antonio Gates]] caught a 3-yard touchdown pass from [[Philip Rivers]]. The Bengals answered back with a 26 yard field goal by [[Shayne Graham]] to make the score 7â3. In the second quarter, [[Chad Ochocinco]] caught a 49-yard touchdown pass from [[Carson Palmer]], and the Bengals took the lead, 10â7. Following the Bengals' touchdown, the Chargers also got a touchdown, to put the Chargers back on top, 14â10. Near the end of the first half, [[Shayne Graham]] kicked another field goal, this time from 25 yards, to make the score 14â13 at halftime. The Bengals could not manage to score in the 3rd quarter, while the Chargers got a touchdown and a field goal. The score was 24â13 at the end of the 3rd quarter. The Bengals finally managed to score in the 4th quarter when [[Laveranues Coles]] caught a 2-yard touchdown pass from [[Carson Palmer]]. The Bengals went for a two-point conversion, and were successful, making the score 24â21. Later in the quarter, [[Shayne Graham]] kicked another field goal, tying the game at 24 points for each team. The Chargers were then able to reach field goal range, and Nate Kaeding kicked a long 52-yard field goal to win the game.

With a second straight loss, Cincinnati fell to 9â5.

At the end of the first half, [[Ryan Succop]] kicked a 30-yard field goal for the chiefs, making the halftime score a tie, 3â3.
