The '''University of Illinois College of Law''' ('''UIUC Law''') is the [[law school]] of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]], the flagship campus of the [[public]] [[University of Illinois]] [[university system]].  The College of Law was established in 1897, and offers the J.D., LL.M., and J.S.D. degrees in law.  Known for its academic rigor and considered to be among the country's leading law schools, the College of Law also hosts visiting scholars, visiting researchers and a number of legal research centers.  The school's prestige, small class size, and strong placement into Chicago law firms make its admissions process highly selective.  The school offers 10 scholarly areas of research, teaching, and coursework, called specialty programs.  These are not majors or concentrations in the traditional sense but areas of academic interest and strength within the College of Law.  The specialty programs include; Business Law and Policy; Comparative Labor and Employment Law Policy; Constitutional Theory, History and Law; Criminal Law and Procedure; Health Law and Policy; Intellectual Property and Technology Law; International and Comparative Law; Law, Behavior and Social Sciences; Law and Philosophy; and Legal History.  The school boasts the 14th largest law library in the country, and a long list of notable alumni in law firms, politics, the judiciary, and academia, including: Albert Jenner, Jr., name partner at law firm Jenner &amp; Block, LLC., and Philip McConnaughay, Dean of Penn State University Dickinson School of Law.  In the 2010 [[U.S. News and World Report]] ranking of American law schools, the College of Law was ranked 21st in the country.

==History==
[[File:Illinois College of Law.png|thumb|right|Law Building, North Side]]
The College of Law was founded in 1897 and is a charter member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]].&lt;ref name=&quot;law.illinois.edu&quot;&gt;University of Illinois College of Law, Accessed May 7, 2009, College Profile.  http://www.law.illinois.edu/prospective-students/college-profile.asp&lt;/ref&gt; The law [[honor society]] known as the [[Order of the Coif]] was founded at the University of Illinois College of Law in 1902.

University of Illinois College of Law is one of the most prestigious law schools in the Midwest and one of the best public law schools in the country. It is on the south end of the main University of Illinois campus in Champaign, near the football stadium and Assembly Hall. In this relatively quiet setting, the College of Law has built up a strong reputation for itself, earning a great measure of respect among members of the legal community, especially in the fields of Bankruptcy, Intellectual Property law, Law and Economics, International Trade law, Antitrust, and Human Rights law. Accordingly, Chicago firms, only a few hours away, look to the law school each year to hire top-quality graduates.

===2011 Restatement of Numbers===

On September 11, 2011, the News-Gazette reported that the University of Illinois College of Law posted inaccurate information on its website about the LSAT scores and GPAs of its incoming first-year law students.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wood (9/11/11)[http://www.news-gazette.com/news/education/2011-09-11/ui-withdraws-inaccurate-info-about-incoming-law-school-class.html UI withdraws inaccurate info about incoming law school class] News-Gazette&lt;/ref&gt; The school removed the inaccurate information and placed an assistant dean on administrative leave.  However, the school declined to reveal that person's identity.  On September 19, 2011, the University of Illinois College of Law posted the corrected information on its website. The actual LSAT and GPA medians for the class of 2014 were 163 and 3.70, respectively. The numbers that had previously been disseminated were a median LSAT of 168 and a median GPA of 3.81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corrected Student Profile Data for the Class of 2014|url=http://www.law.illinois.edu/news/article/1614|accessdate=19 September 2011|author=University of Illinois College of Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On November 8, 2011, the law school announced that the manipulation had been the work of an Assistant Dean of Admissions alone, who would no longer work for the College.
