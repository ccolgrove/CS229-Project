'''Disney Channel Latin America''' is an [[cable television]] [[Television channel|channel]] and is an edition of [[The Walt Disney Company]]-owned [[Disney Channel]], broadcasting to [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean. It is broadcast in five feeds, ''North Zone'', ''Center Zone'', ''South Zone'',and the ''Pacific Zone''. It is marketed to mostly children; however, in recent years the diversity of viewers has increased with an older audience. Disney Channel Latin America is operated by ''Disney &amp; ESPN Media Networks Latin America'' and ''The Walt Disney Company Latin America Inc.'', which are owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] ({{NYSE|DIS}}). It started broadcasting in 2000 as a ''premium'' channel and it became a ''basic cable'' channel in 2004.

Chris Ross, president of ''Disney Channel Worldwide'' has stated that the channel might be launched on [[Digital Terrestrial Television]] someday soon.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/09/12/comunicacion/1221219878.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 2000, while [[Disney Channel]] from the United States was changing from ''premium'' to ''basic'', the channel began broadcasting in [[Latin America]] with the same look as [[Disney Channel (UK &amp; Ireland)|Disney Channel UK]] but same programming from the U.S. version, and being ''premium''. In the beginning, the channel was transmitted in three different feeds, the ''North Zone Feed'',and the ''South Zone Feed'', each one with different schedules according the countries. The channel also launched its first original production, ''[[Zapping Zone]]'', with hosts bringing news and introducing the [[Disney Channel Original Series]]. In 2004, [[Anne Sweeney]], a veteran cable executive, took control of Disney-ABC Television Group and changes the design from the channels worldwide. The same year, Disney Channel Latin America becomes a ''basic'' cable channel and uses the 2002 look of [[Disney Channel|Disney Channel US]].

Along with the new look, the channel started to air new series, mainly focused on [[teenagers]] and placing the original [[animated cartoon]]s in earlier schedules. The new series includes the very successful [[Disney Channel Original Series]] ''[[Lizzie McGuire]]'' and ''[[Even Stevens]]''. In the morning schedule, ''[[Playhouse Disney]]'' was aired with programming for children from age 2-6.

In 2005, the channel became one of the most viewed channels from the region, premiering [[Disney Channel Original Series]] as ''[[That's So Raven]]'', ''[[Phil of the future]]'' and some others. A fourth feed, known as ''Central Zone Feed'' was also created for Central America and the north part of South America.
In 2006, very successful series and films as ''[[Hannah Montana]]'', ''[[The Cheetah Girls (film)|The Cheetah Girls]]'', ''[[High School Musical]]'' and ''[[Jump In!]]'' premiered.

In 2007 the channel changed once more to a more &quot;hip&quot; look, as it now uses the ''Ribbon'' branding of Disney Channel US. Successful series and films as ''[[Cory in the House]]'' and ''[[High School Musical 2]]'' premiered that year.

On June 1, 2008 ''The Walt Disney Company Latin America'' launches ''Playhouse Disney Channel'' a 24-hour independent channel focused on young children in age from 2 to 6. The [[Playhouse Disney]] block in the morning is still broadcast in the same schedule.

In 2008, ''Disney Mobile'' is re-branded ''Disney Mobile Studios'' with content of the channel for cell-phones.

On October 1, 2008 the channel launches its fifth feed, ''Pacific Zone Feed'' and changes schedules, idents and promos in all the feeds.

A new alternate logo featuring the current logo within a box resembling that of a smartphone application icon came into use on August 30, 2010 (though the logo was first seen in July 2010, and at the time was exclusively used on the weekend evening lineup). Disney Channel Latin America also started their campaign &quot;It's On!&quot; in July as part of their Summer 2010 lineup.

===Wonderful World of Disney===
{{Main|Wonderful World of Disney}}

''&quot;El Maravilloso Mundo de Disney&quot;''/''&quot;O Maravilhoso Mundo de Disney&quot;'' (''Wonderful World of Disney&quot;'') is the block after the ''Zapping Zone'' where different [[Walt Disney Pictures]] are aired. The block is dispensable, so it is used when specials need to be aired. In normal seasons from Monday to Thursday it is aired after the Zapping Zone, and on Fridays it is replaced with ''&quot;PelÃ­cula Disney Channel&quot;''/''&quot;Filme Disney Channel&quot;'' (''Disney Channel Movie'') and it's aired after this(but regular films air during the mornings every weekday). The early-afternoon weekday film block is named ''Cool After School''. On [[weekends]], an all-day film block named ''Cine MÃ¡gico'' (''Magic Theater'') is aired. Movies can occasionally be aired on the early morning hours as part of the [[Playhouse Disney]] block.

In winter and summer specials, it also airs at noon. Most films airing on Disney Channel usually run in the 95 to 105-minute range, promos included.

Because of this, Disney airs programming following the film:

* If it lasts 1:25 to 1:35, an Original Series will air (series as ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' or ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'' are often aired).
* If it lasts 1:40 to 1:45, a miniature episode of an Original Animated Series will air (most likely an 11-minute episode of an Animated Original Series, the most common to air are ''[[Phineas and Ferb]]'' and ''[[American Dragon: Jake Long]]''. Sometimes, ''[[Art Attack]]'' is air instead).

It also had sections for DVD releases (called ''En DVD''), the different parks of Disney, the [[Radio Disney]] section, live shows and mobile content.

In September 2009 the website had a major change with all the site getting a new design.
