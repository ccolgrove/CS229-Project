{{1993 ACC football standings}}
The '''1993 [[Florida State Seminoles football]] team''' was the national champion of the [[1993 NCAA Division I-A football season|1993 college football season]].  The team finished with a 12-1 record.

==Regular season==
FSU beat its first five opponents by scores of 42&amp;ndash;0, 45&amp;ndash;7, 57&amp;ndash;0, 33&amp;ndash;7, and 51&amp;ndash;0. Through five games, linebacker [[Derrick Brooks]] had outscored all the other teams by himself. The Seminoles' first real contest didn't come until October 9, when the third ranked [[1993 Miami Hurricanes football team|Miami Hurricanes]] came to Tallahassee with a 31 game regular season win streak. That game was sealed when FSU safety [[Devin Bush]] picked off a [[Frank Costa]] pass and ran it back 40 yards for a Florida State touchdown, making the score 28-10 with 4:59 to play.

On November 13, 1993, Florida State played [[1993 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team|Notre Dame]] in a matchup of unbeaten teams. [[Florida State University|FSU]] was ranked #1 and Notre Dame was ranked #2.  The winner of this game, at [[Notre Dame Stadium]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]], was certain to play #3 [[1993 Nebraska Cornhuskers football team|Nebraska]] (which would then move up to #2) in the [[1994 Orange Bowl]] for the National Championship.&lt;ref name=&quot;fsu&quot;&gt;[http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N59/argue.59s.html Fighting Irish Win Game of the Century] The Tech (MIT newspaper) Mike Duffy and Andrew Heitner. Volume 113, Issue 59 : Friday, November 19, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;
In a matchup hailed as the &quot;Game of the Century&quot;, the Seminoles bid for a perfect season fell short as Notre Dame prevailed, 31-24. As luck would have it, #1 Notre Dame lost the following week to #17 Boston College 41-39 on a last second field goal, putting the Seminoles back in the Orange Bowl
