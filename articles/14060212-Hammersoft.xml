'''Adynaton''' (plural '''adynata''') (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: ''a-'': without and ''dynasthai'': to be powerful) is a [[figure of speech]] in the form of [[hyperbole]] taken to such extreme lengths as to suggest a complete impossibility:
*''I will sooner have a beard grow in the palm of my hand than he shall get one of his cheek'' [[Shakespeare]] [[Henry IV, Part 2]]

==Classical and Medieval usage ==
Adynaton was a widespread literary and [[rhetoric]]al device during the [[Classical antiquity|Classical Period]] and was known in [[Latin]] as ''impossibilia''. A frequent usage was to refer to one highly unlikely event occurring ''sooner'' than another:

:''One can expect an agreement between philosophers sooner than between clocks.'' [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], &quot;''[[The Pumpkinification of Claudius]]''&quot;.

However it largely fell into disuse during the [[Middle Ages]] before undergoing a minor revival in the works of romantic poets, who would boast of the power of their love, and how it could never end.

: ''Together, we shall sooner see, I, &amp; you, The RhÃ´ne tarry, &amp; reverse its course, The SaÃ´ne roil, &amp; return to source, Than this my fire ever die down'' [[Maurice ScÃ¨ve]]

== Fiction, folklore and drama ==
Adynata are sometimes used within works of fiction or drama:

::''Part heat from fire, then, by that notion,''
::''Part frost from snow, wet from the ocean!''
::''Ask less!''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;[[Henrik Ibsen]], ''[[Brand (play)|Brand]]''

Impossible tasks appears often in [[legend]]s and [[folklore]], such as the tale of &quot;[[The Spinning-Woman by the Spring]]&quot;, and can form elements of [[ballad]]s, [[riddle]]s and [[proverb]]s.

== Modern usage ==

When Brazil eventually declared war on [[Nazi Germany]] and a contingent of about [[Brazilian Expeditionary Force|25000 Brazilians]] were sent to join Allied forces in the invasion of Italy, the Brazilian force called themselves ''Cobras Fumantes'' (literally, ''Smoking Snakes''). They adopted as their symbol [[:pt:Ficheiro:Distintivo da FEB.PNG|a snake smoking a pipe.]] Since then, the expression has reversed meaning in Brazil, as &quot;''a cobra vai fumar!''&quot; (&quot;snakes will smoke!&quot;) now implies that something is about to happen in a furious and destructive way
