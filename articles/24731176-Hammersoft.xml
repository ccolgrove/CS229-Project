'''Chazwick Bundick''' better known by his stage name '''Toro Y Moi''', is an American recording artist and producer. His music has taken on many forms since he began recording, but he is often identified with the [[chillwave]] movement of summer 2010. As of 2011, his sound has struck out toward progressive rock, especially in a live setting.

The name &quot;Toro y Moi&quot; can be roughly translated to &quot;Bull and Me&quot;.

Bundick was born on 7 November 1986, in [[Columbia, South Carolina]], and attended Ridge View High School where he formed well-known Columbia [[indie rock]] band The Heist and the Accomplice with three schoolmates. He is of [[Filipino people|Filipino]] descent from his mother and [[African-American]] descent from his father.

Bundick graduated from the [[University of South Carolina]] in spring of 2009 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[graphic design]]. Late in his school career, Bundick formed a close musical relationship with fellow chillwave luminary Ernest Greene who plays under the name [[Washed Out]].   

He has since been signed to [[Carpark Records]], on which he released his first full-length album ''[[Causers of This]]'' in January 2010.

His second album, ''[[Underneath the Pine]]'', was released on February 22, 2011. He has been chosen by [[Caribou (musician)|Caribou]] to perform at the [[All Tomorrow's Parties (music festival)|ATP Nightmare Before Christmas]] festival that they co-curate in December 2011 in Minehead, England.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atpfestival.com/events/nightmare2011.php ATP Nightmare Before Christmas]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 13, Toro Y Moi released an EP titled ''Freaking Out''. The EP features a cover of &quot;[[Saturday Love]]&quot; by [[Alexander O'Neal]] &amp; [[Cherrelle]].

===Other===
Contrary to popular belief, Sides of Chaz is not a Toro y Moi demo, but a collection of Bundick's experimental &quot;stream of consciousness&quot; recordings under his side project &quot;Sides of Chaz&quot;. In addition to this, Chaz also feels as though he has moved beyond the &quot;chillwave&quot; genre, and that &quot;chillwave&quot; was a point where many similar artists started off. He said in an interview At The Sinema that &quot;all that stuff is really good music, like Ernest Green (Washed Out) and Neon Indian. Iâm a big fan of all of that, but I think [chillwave] was just a small little period where we all were, coincidentally making the similar music.&quot; Chaz is also a multi-instrumentalist.

Chaz also has a side project focusing more on dance-style music called &quot;Les Sins.&quot;
