'''LinuxForums.org''' is a community-driven website owned by MAS Media Inc. for Linux users needing free help and support with their Linux distributions and software, and computer hardware.  With more than 200,000 registered members &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linuxforums.org/forum/ 200,000 Registered Users!]&lt;/ref&gt;, it is one of the most active Linux forums and [[free software community]] sites on the Internet.

Support is given in different ways in specific forums, such as on a [[linux distribution|distribution]] level (for major distribution such as [[Red Hat]]/[[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]], [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]], [[Suse]], [[Slackware]], [[Debian]], [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]], [[Arch Linux|Arch]]), but also on an operational level (for areas such as [[Wireless network|Wireless]], [[Computer Programs|Applications]], [[Server (computing)|Server]]s, [[Computer network|Networking]], [[Desktop environment|Desktop]] / [[X Window System|X Window]], [[Programming]] &amp; [[Scripting]]).

In November, 2008 the forum changed ownership and did a complete overhaul of the site.
