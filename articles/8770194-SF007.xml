'''aptosid''' is a desktop-oriented [[operating system]] based on the &quot;unstable&quot; branch of [[Debian]], which uses the codename ''Sid''. It was known as '''sidux''' until September 2010. The distribution consists of a [[Live CD]] (bootable CD-ROM) for the [[x86]] architecture installable to a hard drive through a graphical installer. The goal of the distribution is to provide a stable, easy-to-use and cutting-edge [[Free and open source software|free and open source]] operating system.&lt;ref name='linux.com 2008 article'&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www.linux.com/archive/feature/149400 | title = Sidux grows on you | accessdate = 2010-05-27 | last = Linton | first = Susan | date = 2008-10-08 | publisher = [[Linux.com]] | quote = The developers strive for an easy-to-install and easy-to-use modern Debian derivative}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='sidux wiki intro'&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://sidux.com/index.php?module=Wikula&amp;tag=welcome | title = Welcome to the sidux wiki | accessdate = 2010-05-27 | date = 2006-12-09 | publisher = [http://sidux.com sidux.com] | quote = We love Debian sid (aka &quot;unstable&quot;) and believe in its innovative power.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

sidux was maintained by a team of developers including former [[Kanotix]] developer Stefan Lippers-Hollmann (slh). Initial administration was managed by ''The sidux Foundation, Inc.'' located in the [[United States]]. The Berlin, Germany based non-profit organization ''sidux e.V.'' was administering and supporting the project.

Due to disagreement between sidux e.V. and the sidux developers, all development of sidux was halted in summer 2010 until September 2010. The project was renamed as '''aptosid''', announced on September 11, 2010. aptosid is a direct upgrade from sidux. The first time a user runs an apt-get dist-upgrade in sidux, they are asked if they want their repositories changed to the new aptosid site and the system will be seamlessly upgraded to aptosid.

==Features==
aptosid and sidux are based on Debian's most modern branch, sid. They include a manual&lt;ref name='sidux manual'&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://manual.aptosid.com/ | title = The aptosid Operating System Manual | accessdate = 2010-11-14 | publisher = [http://manual.aptosid.com aptosid.com]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a collection of tools and scripts to make desktop administration easier.

One of aptosid's and sidux's more notable features, unlike most other Linux distributions, they utilize a true [[Rolling release|'rolling-release-cycle']], and thus continue to remain current. Users can update all of the system's packages via the command 'apt-get dist-upgrade'. Through this model, there should not, in theory, ever be a need to overwrite a aptosid or sidux system by installing an entirely new version. Other Linux distributions that use the rolling release model include [[Arch Linux]] and [[Gentoo Linux|Gentoo]].

===Live media===
Each release comes as a [[Live CD]] or [[Live DVD]], booting to a graphical desktop without installation. On the Live CD a USB installer is provided to create a [[Live USB]] system, but the [[Live USB]] can be created easily from the [[Live CD]] ISO file.&lt;ref name='liveusb'&gt;{{Cite web| title = How to make a Live USB from the Live CD ISO file | date = 2010-05-25 | url = http://manual.aptosid.com/en/hd-ins-opts-oos-en.htm#raw-ms | name = Aptosid user manual }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Installer===
The graphical [[Installation (computer programs)|installation]] can be started directly from live mode, without rebooting. aptosid and sidux can be installed to USB-connected hard disks and [[USB flash drive]]s, as well as to internal [[Hard disk drive|hard disks]].

===Updates===
Once aptosid or sidux is installed, it can be kept up-to-date with updates from the Debian Sid and aptosid repositories.  Updates are typically run from command line using [[apt-get]].  Because post and pre install scripts in the Debian packages may restart your display manager during updates and cause conflicts with running userspace applications, it is recommended that users upgrade their system outside of X (i.e. while NOT running the 'GUI').  This is achieved by applying all updates at 'run-level 3'.

Warnings regarding upgrades are posted on the main website and in the Upgrade Warnings section of the forum.

===Support===
*The IRC channel #aptosid at irc.oftc.net, port 6667 gives fastest response.
*The forum is also a good place for questions and talks, however the reaction time is longer, but it is a good source for searches.

===Multilingual===
The default language of aptosid releases is English, however German, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, Greek, English (GB), French, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese (BR and PT), Romanian, Russian and Spanish localisations ([[i18n]] support) are also provided within the DVD, selectable at boot prompt.

===Packages===
aptosid comes with a selection of programs, covering system rescue and web surfing.
To mention a few: [[KDE]] / [[Xfce]] desktop, [[OpenOffice.org]], [[iceweasel]], [[Amarok (software)|amarok]], [[digikam]], [[gparted]], [[gwenview]], [[k3b]], [[kaffeine]], [[koffice]], [[krita]], [[krusader]], [[Scanner Access Now Easy|sane]], [[Video Disk Recorder|vdr]],  [[virtualbox]], [[Wireless tools for Linux|wireless-tools]], [[xawtv]], [[yakuake]], ...

The complete package list is available for each release in the project download directory,&lt;ref name='download directory'&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://debian.tu-bs.de/project/aptosid/ | title = aptosid release download page | accessdate = 2010-09-14 | publisher = [http://debian.tu-bs.de debian.tu-bs.de]}}&lt;/ref&gt; named &lt;release-name&gt;.manifest.

==Releases==
The releases were usually available in 4 CD versions, however since release 2007-04.5 a fully equipped DVD and two light CDs will be offered [ftp://debian.tu-bs.de/project/aptosid/release here].
Since 2008-02 also an ~420 MB large Xfce variant is available.
DVD Versions at the end of a year contain more programs and preinstalled languages.

==Derivatives==
Like many other Linux distributions, aptosid has spinoffs, mainly versions of different languages.
Some to be named here:

* celtux&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://celtux.signal2noise.ie | title=celtux - sidux in Irish language}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Irish, Irish/Gaeilge localization
* Deb-on-Air&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://clampin.free.fr/sidux/manuel/fr/ | title=Deb-on-Air french version of sidux}}&lt;/ref&gt; - French localization
* myrinix&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.myrinix.com/www/ | title=myrinix - Digital Home Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; - Digital Home Edition
* lxde-sid-lite&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://cap.gediam.de/index-en.htm  | title=lxde-sid-lite}}&lt;/ref&gt; - resources saving graphical system, for use in netbooks, like [[eeepc]]

==Name==
The part ''sid'' of the distribution name is derived from Debian Sid (Named after the [[Sid Phillips]] character in [[Toy Story]] - who destructively experiments with his sister Hannahâs toys.) and the common use of -x for [[Unix]] derivatives. The part ''apto'' of the new name aptosid derives from the latin word ''apto'' from ''aptus'' which means ''to fit'', ''to adapt'', ''to adjust'' or ''make ready''.&lt;ref&gt;http://manual.aptosid.com/en/welcome-en.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Another interpretation comes from the greek phrase ''Î±Ï'ÏÎ¿ sid'' (''ap'to sid'') that means ''(coming) from sid''.&lt;ref&gt;http://aptosid.com/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=viewtopic&amp;t=19&lt;/ref&gt;  The names of the releases are taken from the [[Greek mythology]].&lt;br /&gt;
When typed or written, sidux and aptosid are always presented in lower-case letters.

==History==
The sidux project appeared on 2006-11-24,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article2.html | title=initial-sidux-announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the goal of providing a hard disk installable Debian Sid-based Live CD distribution. The first sidux preview appeared on the 2007-01-24&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article73.html | title=sidux-pre1-announce}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://distrorankings.com/project/view/id/214 | title=distrorankings.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the finished release appearing on 2007-02-22,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article116.html | title=2007-01-announcement}}&lt;/ref&gt; codenamed 2007-01 âÎ§Î¬Î¿Ï&quot;(chaos). In February 2007 sidux was awarded by [[DistroWatch]] with the donation of US$350.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://distrowatch.com/weekly.php?issue=20070305#donation | title=distrowatch donation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second sidux Live CD was released on the 2007-05-28,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sidux.com/Article237.html | title=sidux-2007-02_release}}&lt;/ref&gt; codenamed sidux-2007-02 &quot;Î¤Î¬ÏÏÎ±ÏÎ¿Ï&quot;(tartaros). During the linuxtag 2007 (an open source fair in Berlin) a special linuxtag-edition was distributed at the shared booth of KDE e.V. and sidux. On the 2007-05-31 sidux e.V.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sidux-ev.org | title=sidux_e.V.}}&lt;/ref&gt; (foundation) has been officially registered  with the German authorities. On 2007-11-15 sidux e.V. was accepted as [[non-profit organization]] by German law,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://sidux-ev.de/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=26 | title=sidux e.V. accepted as non-profit organisation}}&lt;/ref&gt; retroactively as of 2007-04-01.

==Software==
aptosid and sidux releases contain only [[free software]] as defined by the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines|Debian Free Software Guidelines (DFSG)]]. To aid proof of compliance, a monolithic tarball containing the source for all packages used in the release is provided alongside the Live CD ISOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://debian.tu-bs.de/project/aptosid/release/ | title=release-source-repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Access to non-free software such as codecs, plugins and wlan firmware can be enabled by configuring contrib and non-free Debian repositories in /etc/apt/sources.list.d

In keeping with the evolutionary nature of the &quot;unstable&quot; Debian branch, aptosid and sidux releases do not provide an upgrade path from previous release versions. Rather, once they are installed, incremental updates are performed via regular &quot;dist-upgrades&quot;. The idea of a &quot;release&quot; is instead to improve Live CD hardware support, performance, flexibility and reliability, built from the current debian unstable repository.&lt;ref&gt;http://sidux.com/module-News-display-sid-519.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==System recommendations==
aptosid is officially supported for the [[P6 (microarchitecture)|i686]] [[computer architecture]] and the [[amd64]] [[computer architecture]]

==sidux e.V.==
For permanent support and financing - on April 1, 2007 the non-profit association &quot;sidux e.V.&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;[http://verein.sidux.com/Downloads-req-viewdownload-cid-3.html sidux e.V. - constitution / Satzung]&lt;/ref&gt; seated in Berlin, Germany, was founded. Its constitution and goals go beyond the aims of the support and spreading of sidux. The cooperation between sidux e.V. and the sidux developers ended in summer 2010 due to disagreement.
