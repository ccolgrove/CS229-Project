'''TinTin++''' is a [[MUD client]] primarily written for [[Unix]]-like systems. It is one of the oldest MUD clients in existence and a successor of the TINTIN client.&lt;ref name=&quot;shahromine&quot;&gt;{{cite book

== About ==
[[Image:TinTin++ Lost Souls.png|thumb|right|TinTin++ being used to play ''[[Lost Souls (online game)|Lost Souls]]''; the display in the upper [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] was constructed by TinTin++'s automapper]]
TinTin++ is a [[terminal emulator|console]] [[telnet]] client enhanced with features that work particularly well for playing [[MUD]]s, though it allows connecting to Linux and [[Bulletin Board System]] servers as well.  To enhance game play on MUDs, the client can create a [[Split screen (computer graphics)|split screen]] arrangement, which divides the interface into input, output, and status areas.&lt;ref name=&quot;shahromine&quot; /&gt; Input handling is enhanced with [[readline]]-like input editing, [[Macro (computer science)|macro]], and [[Alias (Unix shell)|alias]] support. Text received from the server can be highlighted or set to execute triggers written in the TINTIN scripting language, which resembles the [[C programming language]].&lt;ref name=&quot;busey&quot;&gt;{{cite book

  | quote = Tintin++ is a variation of the original tintin, but with many new features and bug fixes. Some of the many features of tintin++ are triggers, aliases, high-lighting, gags, substitutions, and split-screen mode (Figure 5-3).

TinTin++ has various other features that are commonly found in modern MUD clients, such as automapping, [[MCCP]], [[friend-to-friend]] messaging, logging in [[HTML]], and a [[TELNET]] event handler.

== History == 

TINTIN originated as a single file containing 700 lines of C code, allowing triggers and aliases, that was posted on [[Usenet]] by Peter Unold on April 1, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |date=1992-04-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 6 1992 Peter Unold made his final release, TINTIN III, which was a much more matured and feature rich program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the development of TINTIN was continued by Bill Reiss who announced the release of TinTin++ v1.0 on July 3, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 |accessdate=2008-07-08
 |date=1993-06-03
}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 25, 1994 TinTin++ 1.5 was announced, which was a joint effort by Bill Reiss, David A. Wagner, Rob Ellsworth, and Jeremy C. Jack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://groups.google.com/group/rec.games.mud.announce/msg/b8f43b74e9df9a70
 |title=Tintin++ v1.5 ready for release
 |author=Robert Ellsworth
 |accessdate=2008-07-09
 |date=1994-04-24
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the 1.5 release in 1994 active development came to a halt. TinTin++ 1.5 had gained significant popularity however, and being public domain this resulted in many derivative works like [[zMUD]], yTin, Lyntin, Pueblo, WinTin95, and GGMud.&lt;ref name=&quot;koster&quot;&gt;{{cite web

 | quote = Given that writing a vanilla Telnet client is very easy, it was not long before there were dedicated clients that wrapped Telnet with additional functionality. The best known of these were TinyFugue and TinTin, and today it seems like zMud is still retaining dedicated users.
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998 development was continued briefly by Rob Elsworth who incorporated several patches by Sverre Normann before handing over development to Davin Chan who re-licensed the software to [[GNU General Public License|GNU GPL]] on July 12th, 2001 in his final release of TinTin++ 1.86b.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Distribution ==

TinTin++ is currently distributed under the [[GNU General Public License]], and the source code can be compiled on most [[Unix-like]] operating systems. A port for [[Microsoft Windows]] called WinTin++ bundles TinTin++ with the [[mintty]] terminal emulator. A [[universal binary]] is available for [[Mac OS X]].
