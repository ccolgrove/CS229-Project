'''Secret Story 2010 (Portugal)''' ''(Casa dos Segredos)'' was the first season of the Portuguese version of the reality show [[Secret Story]], based on the original French version. The series started on October 3, 2010 and the finale was on December 31, which took place on [[Campo Pequeno]], [[Lisbon]]. It aired on [[TelevisÃ£o Independente|TVI]] and was produced by [[Endemol]] Portugal. The show lasted three months and was hosted by Julia Pinheiro, Pedro Granger, and Leonor Poeiras. 

The eviction shows (also called Galas) took place on Sundays and, on the other days of the week, there was a daily diary of what happened in the house. Both were on at prime time. Also, a sister show called &quot;Secret Story Extra&quot;, showing late-night, showed more of the events that took place in the house. On cable TV channel [[TVI Direct]], the show was broadcast 24/7. Since November the 15th, another hour of Secret Story begun to be broadcasted on late afternoon, therefore making 3 programmes per day plus an 24/7 channel. In that space, since Week 8, the public could vote for secret missions that houseamtes would make. At Saturdays only one show aired, a special one with the best moments of the week called &quot;Secret Story Fim-de-Semana&quot;(Secret Story Weekend). A special CD was made with the theme song and housemates' favorite songs.

The format is based on the French one, although this version had more secret missions. These missions were imposed by &quot;a Voz&quot; ('The Voice'). &quot;A Voz&quot; acted similarly to Big Brother in other Big Brother versions. If a housemate found out another housemate's secret, he or she would win the total money of that housemate. The money prizes for each mission was different. Only the four finalists received their account money. Nominations followed the standard [[Big Brother (TV series)|Big Brother]] format, with the only difference being that nominations alternated weekly, with boys nominating one week and the girls nominating the other week. Only two housemates could be up for eviction in each round. This means that if there was a tie in the nominations, there had to be a 2nd round, and in that round only the tied housemates could be nominated. Along the series, housemates developed friendships, dividing into two groups: Boi Marinho and Toupeira. Although at the end of Week 8, when VÃ­tor was expelled, all the housemates became closer.

There were rumors that would be adapted for an English version, but yet they were just rumors.

In a strategic move, Hugo M. tried to discover Joana's secret (strategic because their secret is that they are a fake couple).

She will win 500â¬ if she passes. On Day 19, all the housemates lost half of their money because of two reasons: The first, is that some people thrown tennis balls to the garden with information about Ana and Vitor's secret or saying things about Ana Isabel and Vitor. Daniela and Andreia grabbed the balls and read it to most of the people. The other reason is that everyone keeps talking about secrets with each other, but the secrets have to be discovered by clicking in the Button of Secrets.

They take turns in being in the house both under the name Renato. If the other housemates find out before Day 2, they will be both up for eviction. If they succeed, both will stay in the house. Their secret was discovered on Day 2 by Ana Isabel, and therefore they went up for eviction. MÃ¡rio was eliminated on day 4.&lt;/small&gt;

In that round, both received two votes and tied, and therefore are up with Hugo F. . In bold are the nominations that housemates made in the 2nd round.&lt;/small&gt;
