''The Ruined Map'' is the story of an unnamed detective, hired by a beautiful, alcoholic woman, to find clues related to the disappearance of her husband. In the process, the detective is given a map (a ruined one), supposedly to help him, but which turns out in the end to be more like a metaphor of the guidelines one should have in life. The impossibility to find relevant clues to help him solve the mystery leads the main character to an [[existential crisis]], which builds slowly from inside and finally puts him in the position of identifying himself with the man he was supposed to find.

A film adaptation of the story was made by [[Hiroshi Teshigahara]] and released in 1968.
