'''Frank Steunenberg''' (August 8, 1861{{ndash}} December 30, 1905) was the [[List of Governors of Idaho|fourth Governor]] of the [[U.S. state|State]] of [[Idaho]], serving from 1897 until 1901. He is perhaps best known for his 1905 [[assassination]] by one-time union member [[Albert Horsley|Harry Orchard]], who was also a paid informant for the [[Cripple Creek, Colorado|Cripple Creek]] [[Mine Owners' Association]].&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 119.&lt;/ref&gt; Orchard attempted to implicate leaders of the radical [[Western Federation of Miners]] in the assassination. The labor leaders were found not guilty&lt;ref&gt;Roughneck, The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood, Peter Carlson, 1983, page 135.&lt;/ref&gt; in two trials,&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 224 ppbk.&lt;/ref&gt; but Orchard spent the rest of his life in prison.

==Early career==

Born in [[Keokuk, Iowa|Keokuk]], [[Iowa]], Steunenberg attended [[Iowa State University|Iowa State College]] at [[Ames, Iowa|Ames]] and then went on to become a printer's apprentice and publisher. In 1881 he was hired by the ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' in [[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]. Steunenberg later published a newspaper in [[Knoxville, Iowa|Knoxville]] until 1886, when he moved west and settled in [[Caldwell, Idaho]], where he joined his brother in taking over the ''[[The Idaho Press-Tribune|Caldwell Tribune]]'' for six years.&lt;ref&gt;Idaho State Historical Society Public Archives Research Library. http://www.idahohistory.net/Reference%20Series/0402.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In Caldwell Steunenberg became active in politics and was elected to the first Idaho Legislature in 1890 at age 29 as a [[Electoral fusion|fusion]] candidate, endorsed by both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and [[Populist Party (United States)|Populist]] Parties.

==Governor==
With [[labor union]] support, in 1896 Steunenberg was nominated as both the Democratic and Populist candidate for [[Governor of Idaho|governor]]. He won the November election and became the first non-[[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] elected to that office and was re-elected to second two-year term in 1898. Steunenberg served during a period of considerable labor unrest, particularly in the mining industry in [[Idaho Panhandle|northern]] Idaho. As a result, many corporations, fearing that Steunenberg's government would not support them if there was a [[Strike action|strike]], increased their wages for workers.

The [[Bunker Hill Mining Company]], however, did not. In April 1899 striking members of the [[Western Federation of Miners]] destroyed the company's mill at [[Wardner, Idaho|Wardner]]. In response Steunenberg declared [[martial law]] and asked [[President of the United States|President]] [[William McKinley]] to send federal troops to quell the unrest. (''See also: [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor confrontation of 1899]].'') This action was seen as a betrayal by Steunenberg's union supporters. Martial law remained in place through the end of his term, and Steunenberg did not seek a third term in 1900.

==Assassination==

Four years after he left office, Steunenberg was killed outside his house in Caldwell by a bomb rigged to the front gate. [[Harry Orchard]] was arrested shortly after for the assassination, and the investigation was conducted by [[Pinkerton National Detective Agency|Pinkerton]] agent [[James McParland]]. With the promise of a lighter sentence, McParland compelled Orchard to write a confession in which he implicated [[Bill Haywood|&quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood]], general secretary of the Western Federation of Miners, [[Charles Moyer]], president of the Western Federation of Miners, and [[George Pettibone]], a labor activist who had a prior conviction related to an [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho labor strike of 1892|1892 dispute]] in [[Coeur d'Alene, Idaho|Coeur d'Alene]], as co-conspirators. McParland arrested the three in [[Colorado]] in February 1906.

The nationally publicized trial took place in [[Boise, Idaho|Boise]] in 1907 and included [[United States Senator|Senator]] [[William Borah]] for the prosecution and [[Clarence Darrow]] for the defense. There was a lack of evidence in a case that was supported only by Orchard's testimony. Darrow, a lawyer who specialized in defending trade union leaders, won an [[acquittal]] for Haywood. Pettibone was defended in a separate trial by [[Orrin N. Hilton|Judge Hilton]] of [[Denver, Colorado|Denver]] and was also acquitted, and charges were dropped against Moyer.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bil Haywood, William Dudley Haywood, 1929, page 224 ppbk.&lt;/ref&gt; Orchard received a death sentence in a separate trial, but the sentence was commuted to life in prison.
