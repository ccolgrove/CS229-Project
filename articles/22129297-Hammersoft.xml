The '''NCAA Division III Men's Soccer Championship''' is played since 1974.

It is the largest of the three [[NCAA]] divisions' championships, with the most complicated selection process. The tournament is a 57-team, single-elimination tournament. Teams are divided into three pools. Pool A consists of the 36 conference champions, who all receive automatic bids to the tournament. Pool B consists of all teams which are not in conferences or are in conferences which do not meet the requirements to be awarded an automatic bid. Four teams are selected from Pool B. Pool C consists of all the other teams, plus those Pool B teams not already selected. 17 teams are selected from Pool C. The seven highest teams receive first round byes, and the rest of the bracket is filled by geographical proximity. The first two rounds of the championship are played at campus sites with the higher seeded team hosting the match. The next two rounds are group by four-team sites, with the highest seed acting as host. The semifinals and finals are played at a predetermined campus site. The 2010 Division III final rounds were held at Blossom Soccer Complex in [[San Antonio]].
