It can be spent at any Hub Culture Pavilion or used for [[micropayments]] on the Internet at large.&lt;ref&gt;http://blogs.wsj.com/economics/2009/09/09/the-currency-revolution/ Wall street journal blog article about Ven&lt;/ref&gt; The value of Ven is determined on the financial markets from a basket of currencies, commodities and carbon futures.  It trades against other major currencies at [[floating exchange rate]]s. Ven first appeared as an application in [[Facebook]] on 4 July 2007. In late 2008, the currency became tradeable to anyone with an email address, making it the first global [[digital currency]] to move from an online social network into the real world.&lt;ref name=&quot;DGC Magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2009-08-21|url=http://www.dgcmagazine.com/blog/index.php/2009/07/14/ven-is-hubcultures-cool-social-currency/|title=Hub Culture: Ven is Hub Culture's cool social currency |work=DGC Magazine|date=2009-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2011, Thomson Reuters became the independent calculating agent for Ven, making it the first digital currency to be tracked by the global financial markets, with live market pricing appearing on over 500,000 financial data terminals worldwide. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.finextra.com/news/fullstory.aspx?newsitemid=22985&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2009 Hub Culture began using Ven as a micropayment system for the distribution of content produced by members in the network, allowing users to charge access to individual groups, articles or videos available online. In May 2010, carbon pricing contracts were introduced to the weighted basket that determines the value of Ven. The introduction of carbon to the calculation price of the currency made Ven the first and only currency that is linked to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hubculture.com/groups/237/news/486/ Hub / Ven - Global Digital Currency / News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An open API for Ven arrived in January 2011, providing new forms of distribution and access to the currency for the web at large via a developer interface at [http://VenMoney.net VenMoney.net].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.venmoney.net Ven, by Hub Culture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
