===1948 NFL Draft===

==The 1947 national championship dispute==
While Notre Dame was voted national champion in the final official AP poll, Michigan went on to beat USC, 49â0, in the [[1948 Rose Bowl]], a greater margin that by which Notre Dame had beaten USC. Notre Dame and [[1947 Michigan Wolverines football team|Michigan]] had traded the top spot in the polls through much of the season. Michigan took the #1 spot in the AP poll on November 16, 1947, and Notre Dame moved into the #1 spot on November 23, 1947, by a margin of 1,410 points to 1,289 points.&lt;ref name=Chandler&gt;{{cite news|author=Chandler, John|title=Writers Rate Irish Second to Wolverines|publisher=The Kingsport (Tenn.) News|date=1948-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chandler, John|title=Scribes of Nation PIck Michigan: A.P.'s Poll Favors Wolverines; Final Vote Stands at 226-119|publisher=The Salt Lake Tribune|date=1948-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; This last regular season poll determined the recipient of the AP's national championship trophy.  

Debate arose among some prominent sports writers, among them football writer [[Pete Rozelle]]&quot;&lt;ref name=Rozelle&gt;{{cite news|author=Rozelle, Pete|title=Scribes Warble Praises of Mighty Big Nine Kings|publisher=Long Beach Press-Telegram|date=1948-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Grantland Rice]], the dean of the nation's sports writers. Rice lauded the Wolverines, saying, &quot;It is the best all-around college football team I've seen this year...&quot;&lt;ref name=Rozelle/&gt; [[Red Smith]] of the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' said, &quot;No other team that I have seen this season did things with so little effort.  Crisler has so many that do so much.&quot;&lt;ref name=Rozelle/&gt;

Notre Dame supporters argued that the post-season AP poll was final and should not be revisited. They contended that Michigan had run up the score on USC, noted that Notre Dame had not had an opportunity to play in a bowl game, and asserted that Michigan and other Big Nine schools were unwilling to schedule Notre Dame in the regular season.&lt;ref name=Warden/&gt;

''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' Sports Editor Lyall Smith argued the debate should be answered by comparing the two team's performance against common opponents. Smith noted: &quot;They played three common foes. Notre Dame beat Pitt, 40&amp;ndash;6, a margin of 34 points: Michigan beat Pitt 59&amp;ndash;0.  Notre Dame defeated Northwestern, 26 to 19, a margin of seven points: Michigan beat the 'Cats 49 to 21, for a 28-point advantage. Notre Dame dropped USC, 36 to 7, in what Coach [[Frank Leahy]] termed his team's 'greatest game of the year,' while Michigan slaughtered the same Trojans, 49 to 0.  Against those three common opponents the Irish scored 104 points to 32. Michigan's margin was 167 to 21.&quot;&lt;ref name=Lyall&gt;{{cite news|author=Smith, Lyall|title=Michigan or Notre Dame? Hot Argument Still Raging Throughout U.S.|publisher=Florence (S.C.) Morning News|date=1948-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the debate over which team truly deserved to be recognized as the nation's best, an unofficial post-bowl ballot was held, with the only two options being Michigan and Notre Dame. The AP reported on the rationale for the special poll this way: &quot;The Associated Press is polling sports editors of its member papers throughout the country to help settle the argument as to which is the better football team -- Michigan or Notre Dame. The AP's final poll of the top ten teams, released Dec. 8 at the conclusion of the regulation season, resulted in Notre Dame winning first place with 1,410 points. Michigan was second with 1,289. . . . Returns so far received indicate that voting in this latest poll is likely to be the heaviest ever recorded.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=AP to Conduct Special Poll|publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe|date=1948-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another AP report indicated the special poll was &quot;conducted by popular demand&quot; to answer &quot;the burning sports question of the day&quot; and to do so &quot;at the ballot box.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Michigan Winner Nearly 2-1 Over Irish in AP Poll|publisher=Albuquerque Journal|date=1948-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Grimsley, Will|title=Michigan the Uncrowned National Grid Champion: Wolves Win 2-1 In Special Poll; 119 Ballots Cast for Irish, 226 for Mich.|publisher=Ironwood Daily Globe|date=1948-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the post-Rose Bowl poll, Michigan coach [[Fritz Crisler]] said &quot;the men who voted couldn't have made a mistake if they had picked either team.&quot;  He described Notre Dame coach [[Frank Leahy]] as a &quot;superb coach.&quot;&lt;ref name=Leahy&gt;{{cite news|author=Liska, Jerry|title=Leahy Praises Wolverines After Voting|publisher=The Kingsport (Tenn.) News|date=1948-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notre Dame President, Father John Cavanagh said, &quot;We at Notre Dame feel grateful for the magnanimous statement of Coach Crisler. I listened to Michigan against Southern California and have only praise for the skill and accomplishment of your fine team.&quot;&lt;ref name=Leahy/&gt;

Despite the magnanimous statements of Coach Crisler and Father Cavanagh, the reversed decision in the post-Rose Bowl poll only stoked the  debate over which team was best. Said one columnist: &quot;Hottest argument of the moment is the one over which had the better football team, Michigan or Notre Dame. To settle it the Associated Press polled better than 350 sports writers in 48 states . . . with a two to one nod for the Wolverines.&quot;&lt;ref name=Warden&gt;{{cite news|author=Warden, Al|title=Patrolling the Sport Highway with Al Warden|publisher=The Ogden Standard-Examiner|date=1948-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forty years later, the debate was still ongoing. In 1988, Michigan All-American [[Dan Dworsky]] noted: &quot;Notre Dame still claims that national championship and so do we.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Florence, Mal|title=''The Magicians: Split Personality in 1947 Helped Michigan Drive Everyone Crazy'' | publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]]| date=1988-12-27|accessdate=2007-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The NCAA, the governing body for college athletics, presently cites Notre Dame as the official AP title winner.&lt;ref name=&quot;FBS Past National Champions&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/ia_football_past_champs.html |title = Past Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (Division I FBS) National Champions (formerly called Division I-A) | publisher= ncaa.org | accessdate=2008-07-27 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080325105535/http://www.ncaa.org/champadmin/ia_football_past_champs.html |archivedate = 2008-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Associated Press also does not recognize the special poll and the special poll does not supersede the original final poll. &lt;ref name=&quot;college football poll.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.collegefootballpoll.com/champions_national.html|title = College Football national champions | publisher= collegefootballpoll.com | accessdate=2011-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AP Polls&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepages.cae.wisc.edu/~dwilson/rfsc/history/APpolls.txt|title = AP Polls | publisher= wisc.edu | accessdate=2011-10-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
