'''Skype''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|s|k|aÉª|p}}) is a [[application software|software application]] that allows users to make [[voice over IP|voice and video calls and chat over the Internet]]. Calls to other users within the Skype service are free, while calls to both traditional [[landlines|landline telephones]] and [[mobile phone]]s can be made for a fee using a [[debit]]-based user account system.  Skype has also become popular for its additional features which include [[instant messaging]], [[file transfer]], and [[videoconferencing]].  Competitors include [[SIP]] [[H.323]] based free software [[Empathy (software)|Empathy]], [[Linphone]], [[Ekiga]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ostatic.com/blog/bye-bye-skype-top-3-free-replacements |title=Bye Bye Skype, Top 3 Free Replacements |publisher=Ostatic.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; but primarily the [[Google Talk]] interface supported by [[Google Chrome]] and released as the [[WebRTC]] standard proposal is expected to provide Skype's long term competition, as it is based on the same codec technology (developed by Global IP solutions) as Skype itself.

Skype has 663 million registered users as of September 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telecompaper.com/news/skype-grows-fy-revenues-20-reaches-663-mln-users
 | title=Skype grows FY revenues 20%, reaches 663 mln users
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The network is operated by [[Microsoft]], which has its Skype division headquarters in [[Luxembourg]]. Most of the development team and 44% of the overall employees of the division are situated in the offices of [[Tallinn]] and [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Skype development&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Unlike other [[VoIP]] services, Skype is a [[peer-to-peer]] system rather than a [[Clientâserver model|clientâserver]] system, and makes use of [[background process]]ing on computers running Skype software; the original name proposed&amp;nbsp;â Sky peer-to-peer&amp;nbsp;â reflects this.

== Microsoft acquisition ==

On 10 May 2011, [[Microsoft|Microsoft Corporation]] agreed to acquire [[Microsoft Skype Division|Skype Communications, S.Ã  r.l]] for US$8.5 billion.&lt;ref name=&quot;SkypeMicrosoftPressRelease&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://about.skype.com/press/2011/05/microsoft_to_acquire_skype.html#more|title=Microsoft to acquire Skype|date=10 May 2011|accessdate=10 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was incorporated as a division of Microsoft, and Microsoft acquired all of the company's technologies with the purchase. This was completed on 13 October 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;SkypeMicrosoftPressRelease&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Toor|first=Amar|title=Microsoft finalizes acquisition of Skype, [[Tony Bates]] shares his thoughts (video)|url=http://www.engadget.com/2011/10/14/microsoft-finalizes-acquisition-of-skype-tony-bates-shares-his/|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=14 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


==Features==
{{Main|Features of Skype}}
&lt;!-- This section is long and detailed. Most details can be added to the main article instead. --&gt;

Registered users of Skype are identified by a unique Skype Name, and may be listed in the Skype directory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title=Usernames, aliases and nicknames&amp;nbsp;â your Skype passport
| url=http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/skypename/
| publisher=Skype.com
| accessdate=27 August 2009
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skype allows these registered users to communicate through both instant messaging and voice chat. Voice chat allows [[telephone call]]s between pairs of users and conference calling, and uses a proprietary audio [[codec]]. Skype's text chat client allows group chats, [[emoticon]]s, storing chat history and editing of previous messages. Offline messages were implemented in version 5, but removed after a few weeks without notification. The usual features familiar to instant messaging users&amp;nbsp;â user profiles, online status indicators, and so on&amp;nbsp;â are also included.

The ''Online Number'', a.k.a. SkypeIn, service allows Skype users to receive calls on their computers dialed by conventional phone subscribers to a local Skype phone number; local numbers are available for Australia, Belgium, Chile, Colombia, Denmark, the Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Poland, Romania, South Africa, South Korea, Sweden, Switzerland, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and the United States.&lt;ref name=&quot;skypeincountries&quot;&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate=10 October 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Skype user can have local numbers in any of these countries, with calls to the number charged at the same rate as calls to fixed lines in the country.

[[Video conferencing]] between two users was introduced in January 2006 for the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Mac OS X]] platform clients. Skype 2.0 for [[Linux]], released on 13 March 2008, also features support for video conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skype for Windows, starting with version 3.6.0.216, supports &quot;High Quality Video&quot; with quality and features, ''e.g.'', full-screen and screen-in-screen modes, similar to those of mid-range videoconferencing systems.&lt;ref&gt;Skype User Guide {{cite web | url = http://www.HL7.com.au/Skype-Video-Conferencing.htm | title = Using Skype for Desk-top Video-Conferences }} (official site)&lt;/ref&gt; Skype audio conferences currently support up to 25 people at a time, including the host.

Skype does not provide the ability to call [[Emergency telephone number|emergency numbers]] such as [[9-1-1|911]] in the [[United States]] and Canada, [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] in the United Kingdom and many other countries, 111 in New Zealand, 000 in Australia, or 112 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skype.com/allfeatures/no911/ |title=Skype and Emergency Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has ruled that, for the purposes of section 255 of the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996|Telecommunications Act]], Skype is not an &quot;interconnected VoIP provider&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.access-board.gov/sec508/refresh/teitac8th/tf-report.htm |title=Draft Report from TEITAC Task Force on 255/508 differences, with proposals for TEITAC discussion |accessdate=13 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the U.S. [[National Emergency Number Association]] recommends that all VoIP users have an analog line available as a backup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.911voip.org/faqs.htm |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher=911VoIP.org |date=|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Skype partnered with Comcast to bring its video chat service to Comcast subscribers via their HDTV sets.&lt;ref&gt; Ryan Lawler, GigaOm. &quot;[http://gigaom.com/video/comcast-skype-video-chat/ Comcast bringing Skype video chat into the living room].&quot; June 13, 2011.

Users may have more than one account; it is not possible to count users, only accounts.

The volume of international traffic routed via Skype is significant. It has become the largest international voice carrier (by minutes of calls).&lt;ref name=&quot;networkworld.com&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.networkworld.com/news/2009/032509-skype-is-largest-international-voice.html |title=Skype is largest international voice carrier, says study |author=RicknÃ¤s, Mikael |date=25 March 2009 |work=Network World |publisher=IDG News Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]], using an official application released on 31 March 2009. As of version 2.x, the iPhone application is capable of placing voice calls over 3G and [[EDGE]] networks.

On August 2 2011, Skype officially released an iPad app named 'Skype for iPad' which allows the user to have video calls using [[iPad 2]]'s front and back cameras. The original [[iPad]] is also allowed to make calls but only voice calls, The other person on the other side can make a video call if they have a camera, and the original [[iPad]] can only receive the video but not send.
* A variety of BlackBerry and Android 3G Smartphones, through Verizon Wireless' Skype mobile service. Customers can receive Skype calls, instant messages and see friends' presence any time the phone is on. Skype usage isn't charged against customersâ monthly Verizon Wireless minute allowance when calling another Skype account (Skype-to-Skype).

Some devices are made to work with Skype by talking to a desktop Skype client or by embedding Skype software into the device. These are usually either tethered to a PC, or have a built-in [[Wi-Fi]] client to allow calling from Wi-Fi hotspots like the [[Netgear]] SPH101 Skype Wi-Fi Phone, the [[SMC Networks|SMC]] WSKP100 Skype Wi-Fi Phone, the [[Belkin]] F1PP000GN-SK Wi-Fi Skype Phone, the [[Panasonic]] KX-WP1050 Wi-Fi Phone for Skype Executive Travel Set, the [[IPEVO]] So-20 Wi-Fi Phone for Skype and the [[Linksys]] CIT200 Wi-Fi Phone. There are also embedded cordless Skype phones based on DECT, which do not need a PC either, like the DUALphone 3088 from [[RTX]]. Netgear and SMC's Wi-Fi phones are considered the two major competitors in the market, with reviews of the Wi-Fi phones giving them equal coverage.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The Skype Wi-Fi Phone is a wireless mobile phone that allows users to make Skype calls, using a wireless Internet connection. The Skype Wi-Fi Phone has an on-screen menu that lets Skype users see who is online and available to talk, similar to what is seen on a PC. It can also be used to talk with non-Skype users. SkypeOut minutes can be used to call any phone for a low price and no monthly fee. The Skype Wi-Fi phone does not contain a web browser and so can not access hotspots, which require web-based login or authentication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Third-party developers, such as [[Truphone]], [[Nimbuzz_IM]] and [[Fring]], have allowed Skype to run in parallel with several other competing VoIP/IM networks ([[Truphone]] and Nimbuzz provide truphoneOut and NimbuzzOut as a competing paid service) in any Symbian or Java environment. Nimbuzz has made Skype available to [[BlackBerry]] users. In July 2010, however, Fring disabled users from accessing Skype despite claiming that Skype themselves disabled the access;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.skype.com/en/2010/07/fring.html|title=Skype&amp;nbsp;â The Big Blog&amp;nbsp;â Fring's mis-use of Skype software was damaging to our brand and reputation|accessdate=3 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fring had provided mobile video calling over Skype as well as support for the Android platform. Nimbuzz discontinued support on request of Skype in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nimbuzz.com/2010/10/25/what-the-skypenimbuzz-breakup-means-to-you/|title=What the Skype/Nimbuzz Breakup Means To You|accessdate=25 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==System and software==
===Protocol===
{{Main|Skype protocol}}

Skype uses a [[proprietary protocol|proprietary]] Internet telephony ([[VoIP]]) network called the [[Skype protocol]]. The protocol has not been made publicly available by Skype and official applications using the protocol are [[closed-source]]. Part of the Skype technology relies on the [[Global Index P2P]] protocol belonging to the [[Joltid Ltd.]] corporation. The main difference between Skype and standard VoIP clients is that Skype operates on a [[peer-to-peer]] model (originally based on the [[Kazaa]] software&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/ip-telephony/?p=988 |title=StreamCast sues Kazaa, Skype: here's my take |publisher=Blogs.zdnet.com |date=27 March 2006 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;), rather than the more usual [[clientâserver]] model (note that the very popular [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]] model of VoIP is also peer-to-peer, but implementation generally requires registration with a server, as does Skype).

===Protocol detection and control===
Many networking and security companies claim to detect and control Skype's protocol for enterprise and carrier applications. While the specific detection methods used by these companies are often private, [[Pearson's chi-squared test]] and [[Naive Bayes classifier|Naive Bayes classification]] are two approaches that were published in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dpacket.org/articles/revealing-skype-traffic-when-randomness-plays-you |title=Dario Bonfiglio et al. &quot;Revealing Skype Traffic: When Randomness Plays with You&quot;, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review, Volume 37:4 (SIGCOMM 2007), p. 37-48 |publisher=Dpacket.org |date=30 May 2008 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Combining statistical measurements of payload properties (such as byte frequencies and initial byte sequences) as well as flow properties (like packet sizes and packet directions) has also shown to be an effective method for identifying Skype's TCP- and UDP-based protocols.&lt;ref name=&quot;breaking&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iis.se/docs/hjelmvik_breaking.pdf|title=Breaking and Improving Protocol Obfuscation|last1=Hjelmvik|first1=Erik|last2=John|first2=Wolfgang|date=27 July 2010|issn=|1652-926X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Audio codecs===
Skype uses an array of different audio compression methods including [[G.729]] and [[SVOPC]]. Skype added a Skype-created codec called [[Silk (codec)|SILK]] to Skype 4.0 for Windows and other Skype clients. SILK is intended to be &quot;lightweight and embeddable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wirevolution.com/2009/01/13/skypes-new-super-wideband-codec/ |title=Skype's new super wideband codec |publisher=Wirevolution.com |date=2009-01-13 |accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before and during the Microsoft acquisition, Skype withdrew licensing from several third parties producing software and hardware compatible with Skype. The [[Skype for Asterisk]] product from [[Digium]] was withdrawn as &quot;no longer available for sale&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digium.com/en/docs/SFA/sfa_faq.php |title=Phone Systems to Power Your Business - Sfa_faq - DigiumÂ® The Asterisk Company |publisher=Digium.com |date= |accessdate=2011-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Senao]] SN358+ long-range (10-15km) cordless phone were discontinued due to loss of licenses to participate in the Skype network as peers.  In combination these two products made it possible to create roaming cordless mesh networks with robust handoff.


==Security and privacy==
{{Main|Skype security}}
Skype is claimed to be a [[secure communication]]; encryption cannot be disabled, and is invisible to the user. Skype reportedly uses publicly-documented, widely trusted encryption techniques: [[RSA (algorithm)|RSA]] for key negotiation and the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] to encrypt conversations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.skype.com/intl/en/legal/privacy/general/ | title=Skype Privacy FAQ | publisher=Skype | accessdate=5 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is impossible to verify that these algorithms are used correctly, completely and at all times as there is no public review possible without a protocol specification and/or the program source code. Skype provides an uncontrolled registration system for users with no proof of identity. Instead, a free choice of nicknames permits users to use the system without revealing their identity to other users. It is trivial to set up an account using any name; the displayed caller's name is no guarantee of authenticity. A third party paper analyzing the security and methodology of Skype was presented at [[Black Hat]] Europe 2006. It analyzed Skype and found a number of security issues with the current security model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.blackhat.com/presentations/bh-europe-06/bh-eu-06-biondi/bh-eu-06-biondi-up.pdf |format=PDF| title=Silver Needle in the Skype | author=Philippe Biondi and Fabrice Desclaux | publisher=blackhat | accessdate=2 March 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Skype incorporates some features which tend to hide its traffic, but it is not specifically designed to thwart [[traffic analysis]] and therefore does not provide [[Anonymous P2P|anonymous communication]]. Some researchers have been able to [[Digital watermarking|watermark]] the traffic so that it is identifiable even after passing through an [[Tor (anonymity network)|anonymizing network]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ise.gmu.edu/~xwangc/Publications/CCS05-VoIPTracking.pdf |title=George Mason University |format=PDF |date=|accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview Kurt Sauer, the Chief Security Officer of Skype, said, &quot;We provide a safe communication option. I will not tell you whether we can listen or not.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ZDNet.de |url=http://www.zdnet.de/mobiles_internet_drahtloses_arbeiten_telefonieren_uebers_internet_wie_sicher_ist_skype_wirklich_story-39001620-39151472-1.htm |title=Telefonieren Ã¼bers Internet: Wie sicher ist Skype wirklich?&amp;nbsp;â Telekommunikation &amp;#124; Mobile Business |publisher=ZDNet.de |date=|accessdate=31 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skype's client uses an undocumented and proprietary protocol. The [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) is concerned by user privacy issues arising from using proprietary software and protocols and has made a replacement for Skype one of their high priority projects.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html#skypereplacement FSF High Priority Projects]&quot;, [[Free Software Foundation]]. Retrieved 26 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Security researchers Biondi and Desclaux have speculated that Skype may have a [[Backdoor (computing)|back door]], since Skype sends traffic even when it is turned off and because Skype has taken extreme measures to obfuscate their traffic and functioning of their program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Austrian public broadcasting service [[Ãsterreichischer Rundfunk|ORF]], citing minutes from the meeting, reported that &quot;the Austrian police are able to listen in on Skype connections&quot;. Skype declined to comment on the reports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The United States [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) has interpreted the [[Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act]] (CALEA) as requiring digital phone networks to allow [[wiretapping]] if authorized by an FBI warrant, in the same way as other phone services. In February 2009 Skype said that, not being a telephone company owning phone lines, it is exempt from CALEA and similar laws which regulate US phone companies, and in fact it is not clear whether Skype could support wiretapping even if it wanted to.&lt;ref name=voipnews&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voip-news.com/feature/skype-secrecy-attack-022409 |title=Skype Secrecy Under Attack Again |publisher=VoIP News |date=24 February 2009 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The saved messages contain [[personally identifiable information]] about the messages' senders and recipients, including IP addresses, usernames, land line phone numbers, and the entire content of the text messages, including the time and date of each message. Information about Skype users outside China who were communicating with a TOM-Skype user was also saved.

There is no e-mail or phone number for complaints about billing errors.

In January 2010 Skype rescinded their policy of seizing funds in Skype accounts that have been inactive (no paid call) for 180 days. This was in settlement to a class action lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2010/01/14/skype-lawsuit-to-yield-credit-for-customers/|title=WSJ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Sarmad | last=Ali | date=14 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A settlement of up to US$4 was paid to persons who opted in to the action.
