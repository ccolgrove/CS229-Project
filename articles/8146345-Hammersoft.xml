'''[[California]]'s transportation system''' is complex and dynamic. Although known for its [[car culture]] and extensive network of freeways and roads, the state also has a vast array of rail, sea, and air transport. However, in a state with over 37 million people, rapid population expansion, and diverse terrain and weather, that system is under pressure to stay ahead of population growth and transportation needs.

==Roads and highways==
===Overview===
[[File:Arroyo Seco Parkway from Marmion Way.jpg|thumb|250px|Along the historic [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]] between [[Los Angeles]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]]]

California is known for its [[car culture]], and its residents typically take to the roads for their commutes, errands, and vacations, giving California's cities a reputation for severe [[traffic congestion]]. California has some of the worst roads in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baycitizen.org/blogs/pulse-of-the-bay/read-while-you-are-waiting-traffic-clear/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.economist.com/node/9621456 | work=The Economist | title=A bridge too far gone | date=2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

California's vast terrain is connected by an extensive system of [[freeway]]s, [[Limited-access road|expressway]]s, and [[highway]]s, all maintained by the [[California Department of Transportation]] (Caltrans) and patrolled by the [[California Highway Patrol]] (CHP), except for the numbered expressways in [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] which were built and maintained by the county itself. The main north-south arteries are [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]], which runs close to the coast from the state's border with [[Oregon]], across the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], to downtown [[Los Angeles]], and [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]], which runs inland from the Oregon to [[Mexico]] borders, bisecting the entire state.  In addition, a major north-south artery is [[California State Route 99|State Highway 99]], which runs from near [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]] to near [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]]; Highway 99 is largely parallel to Interstate 5, and connects the Central Valley cities not connected by Interstate 5.

Perhaps it is a testament to California's sheer size that although it has one of the most extensive freeway systems in the United States, it contains many of the largest cities in the United States not served by an [[Interstate Highway]], including the two largest, [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] (pop. 471,479) and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] (pop. 247,057).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interstate-guide.com/future.html Future Interstates and Potential Interstate Corridors @ Interstate-Guide.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These cities, along with [[Modesto, California|Modesto]] and [[Visalia, California|Visalia]], are passed by as [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] veers west to avoid the congestion of the populated eastern side of the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] as it connects [[Sacramento]] and [[Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publicpurpose.com/pp-is2000.htm Interstate 2000: Improvement for the Next Millenium (sic)&lt;!-- PLEASE NOTE that &quot;Millenium&quot; is deliberately spelled incorrectly here, reflecting the mistake on the external page. --&gt;&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all California highways are non-toll roads. However, there are four toll roads in [[Southern California]], and eight toll bridges in the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. These toll facilities, along with several [[High occupancy/toll and express toll lanes|high occupancy toll lanes]], use the statewide electronic toll collection system known as [[FasTrak]]. The state's most famous highway bridge is the [[Golden Gate Bridge]], though there are a number of major non-toll bridges elsewhere in [[Sacramento]], Los Angeles, and [[San Diego]].

The state's freeway network has expanded every since the [[Arroyo Seco Parkway]], the first freeway in the Western United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Pool |first= Bob |title= Pasadena Freeway getting a new look and a new name |work= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date=June 25, 1010 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jun/25/local/la-me-parkway-20100625 |accessdate= August 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; connecting Los Angeles and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]], opened in 1940. However, the state is not immune to [[freeway revolts]], such as those that have prevented a freeway in San Francisco between the Golden Gate Bridge and the [[San Francisco â Oakland Bay Bridge]], and an expansion of [[Interstate 710]] through [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]].

In March 2011, California ranked as second best state in the American State Litter Scorecard (after [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington State]]), for overall effectiveness and quality of its public space cleanliness from state and related litter/debris removal efforts.&lt;ref&gt;S. Spacek, 2011 American State Litter Scorecard.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interstate Highways===
[[Image:I-5 near Shasta.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Along southbound Interstate 5 approaching [[Mount Shasta]]]]

Primary [[Interstate Highway]]s in California include:
*[[Image:I-5 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 5]]: Bisects the state from the [[Mexico â United States border|Mexican border]] to [[Oregon]], linking the major cities of [[San Diego]], [[Santa Ana, California|Santa Ana]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Stockton, California|Stockton]], [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]], and [[Redding, California|Redding]].
*[[Image:I-8 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 8]]: Runs east from San Diego to the [[Imperial Valley (California)|Imperial Valley]] before crossing into [[Arizona]] west of [[Yuma, Arizona|Yuma]].
*[[Image:I-10 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 10]]: Heads east from [[Santa Monica, California|Santa Monica]] through Los Angeles, [[San Bernardino, California|San Bernardino]], and the [[Coachella Valley]] to Arizona.
*[[Image:I-15 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 15]]: Originating from San Diego, serves as the major route from Southern California to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].
*[[Image:I-40 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 40]]: Heads east from [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] across the [[Mojave Desert]] to [[Needles, California|Needles]] before entering into Arizona.
*[[Image:I-80 (CA).svg|20px]] [[Interstate 80]]: Runs northwest from [[San Francisco]] through [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountain range before crossing into [[Nevada]] west of the [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]].

A number of auxiliary (three-digit) Interstates are located in the Bay Area, Greater Los Angeles area, and San Diego.

===U.S. Routes===
[[File:US395descending intobishop.JPG|thumb|right|250px|U.S. Route 395 descending from the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] into [[Owens Valley]]]]

The following are [[United States Numbered Highways]] in California:
*[[Image:US 6 (CA).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 6]]: Runs from [[Bishop, California|Bishop]] east to Central Nevada.
*[[Image:US 50 (CA).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 50]]: Heads east from the Sacramento area through the [[South Lake Tahoe, California|South Lake Tahoe]] area before crossing into Nevada en route to [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]].
*[[Image:US 95 (CA).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 95]]: Enters into California from Arizona through a concurrency with Interstate 10. US 95 then splits from I-10 in [[Blythe, California|Blythe]], then runs north to [[Needles, California|Needles]] before crossing into Nevada en route to Las Vegas
*[[Image:US 97 (CA).svg|20px]] [[U.S. Route 97]]: Serves as the primary connection from the [[Weed, California|City of Weed]] to [[Klamath Falls, Oregon]].
*[[Image:US 101 (CA).svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 101]]: The primary north-south U.S. Highway in California, connecting Los Angeles with the Central Coast, the San Francisco Bay, and the North Coast.
*[[Image:US 199 (CA).svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 199]]: Serves as the primary connection from the [[Crescent City, California|Crescent City]] area to [[Grants Pass, Oregon]].
*[[Image:US 395 (CA).svg|25px]] [[U.S. Route 395]]: A major north-south route in the eastern areas of the state, connecting the [[Mojave Desert]] with the [[Owens Valley]] and the Eastern [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]]. The route then clips into [[Nevada]] to pass through Carson City and Reno, before returning to California to serve the [[Honey Lake]] and [[Modoc Plateau]] areas.

===State Routes===
{{main|State highways in California|List of state highways in California}}
[[File:California 1.svg|100px|thumb|right|The standard California state route marker consists of a white numeral on a green shield&lt;!-- in the shape of a miner's [[spade]] to honor the [[California Gold Rush]].{{citation needed}}--&gt;]]

[[State highway]]s in California range from one-lane rural roads to full urban freeways. Each state highway is assigned a ''Route'' (officially ''State Highway Route''&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 230-233|California Streets and Highways Code, Section 231]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Caltrans]], [http://www.dot.ca.gov/hq/transprog/stip/2004%20ITIP/other.htm Other State Highway Routes]&lt;/ref&gt;) number in the [[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 301-635|Streets and Highways Code (Sections 300-635)]]. However, the state is also currently relinquishing a number of non-freeway segments, especially in [[urban area]]s, and turning them over to local control.&lt;ref&gt;[[wikisource:California Streets and Highways Code/Section 301-635|California Streets and Highways Code, Sections 301-635]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rail and bus travel==
{{Main|Rail transport in California}}
[[File:Amtrak California.JPG|250px|thumb||left|An Amtrak California train at [[San Jose Diridon Station]]]]

Intercity rail travel is provided by [[Amtrak California]], which manages the three busiest intercity rail lines in the US outside the [[Northeast Corridor]]. The [[Capitol Corridor]] connects the San Francisco Bay Area to Sacramento. The [[Pacific Surfliner]] runs along the coast of Southern California from San Diego to San Luis Obispo. And the [[San Joaquin (Amtrak)|San Joaquin]] connects the major cities of the Central Valley.

National Amtrak lines include the [[California Zephyr]] from [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]] to [[Chicago, Illinois]]; the [[Coast Starlight]] from Los Angeles to [[Seattle, Washington]]; the [[Southwest Chief]] and the [[Texas Eagle]] from Los Angeles to Chicago; and the [[Sunset Limited]] from Los Angeles to [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].

Integrated [[Rapid transit|subway]] and [[light rail]] networks are found in Los Angeles ([[LACMTA|Metro Rail]]) and San Francisco ([[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] and [[San Francisco Municipal Railway|MUNI Metro]]). Light rail systems are also found in San Jose ([[Santa Clara VTA Light-rail|VTA]]), San Diego ([[San Diego Trolley]]), Sacramento ([[Sacramento Regional Transit District|RT Light Rail]]), and Northern San Diego County ([[Sprinter (San Diego)|Sprinter]]). Furthermore, [[commuter rail]] networks serve the San Francisco Bay Area ([[Caltrain]], [[Altamont Commuter Express|ACE]]), Greater Los Angeles ([[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]]), and San Diego County ([[San Diego Coaster|Coaster]]).

Nearly all counties operate bus lines, and many cities operate their own bus lines as well. Intercity bus travel is provided by [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]] and [[Amtrak Thruway Motorcoach]].

==Air travel==

{{double image|right|LAX LA.jpg|175|SFO international terminal.jpg|175|The airports of [[Los Angeles International Airport|Los Angeles]] (l) and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] (r) are two of the major air hubs in the United States}}
[[Los Angeles International Airport]] and [[San Francisco International Airport]] are major hubs for trans-Pacific and transcontinental traffic. There are about a dozen important commercial [[List of airports in California|airport]]s and many more [[general aviation]] airports throughout the state's 58 counties.

==Seaports and harbors==
[[File:LA-port+Long-Beach1.jpg|left|thumb|250px|View of the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach]]
California also has several important [[seaport]]s. The giant seaport complex formed by the [[Port of Los Angeles]] and the [[Port of Long Beach]] in Southern California is the largest in the country and responsible for handling about a fourth of all container cargo traffic in the United States. The [[Port of Oakland]] handles most of the ocean containers passing through Northern California.  The [[Port of Redwood City]], the [[Port of Richmond (California)|Port of Richmond]], and the [[Port of San Diego]] are also significant ports for freight shipments. The [[Port of Sacramento]] and the [[Port of Stockton]] are two major inland deepwater ports located in the [[California Central Valley|Central Valley]], and thus only accessible via the [[Sacramento â San Joaquin River Delta]].

A number of ferry services take commuters across San Francisco Bay from San Francisco to other communities in the Bay Area. Ferry service is also available for commuters crossing [[San Diego Bay]] from San Diego to [[Coronado, California|Coronado]]. Passenger ferries also serve the offshore city of [[Avalon, California|Avalon]] on [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Santa Catalina Island]]. There is no regular vehicle ferry service to Avalon, however, since the city restricts the use of cars and trucks within its borders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cityofavalon.com/content/2542/2582/2586/default.aspx | title=City of Avalon - FAQ | accessdate=2011-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous local harbors are spread out across the Pacific Coast, San Francisco Bay, San Diego Bay, and the Sacramento â San Joaquin River Delta for commercial fishing or recreational use.

Because of the state's population growth, many settlements that were once small or rural communities about half a century ago, when much of California's transportation infrastructure was original designed, are now thriving [[suburbs]] and [[exurbs]]. According to a 2011 study by ''[[Forbes]]'', the cities of [[Lake Elsinore, California|Lake Elsinore]], [[Los Banos, California|Los Banos]], [[Adelanto, California|Adelanto]], and [[Brentwood, California|Brentwood]] were ranked as the top four longest commutes in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.forbes.com/2011/02/22/los-angeles-washington-san-francisco-business-worst-commutes.html | title=America's Worst Commutes | first=Nathan | last=Vardi | publisher=''[[Forbes]]'' | date=2011-02-22 | accessdate=2011-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; A regularly recurring issue in California politics is whether the state should continue to aggressively expand its freeway network or concentrate on improving mass transit networks in urban areas. 

The [[California High Speed Rail]] Authority was created in 1996 by the state to implement an extensive 700 mile (1127&amp;nbsp;km) rail system. Voters approved [[California Proposition 1A (2008)|Proposition 1A]] in November 2008, approving a $9 billion state bond. The system would provide a [[TGV]]-style high-speed link between the state's four major metropolitan areas, and would allow travel between Los Angeles' [[Union Station (Los Angeles)|Union Station]] and the [[San Francisco Transbay Terminal]] in two and a half hours.
