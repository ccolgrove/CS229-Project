==History==
[[File:Viuss.JPG|right|thumb|250px|VIU Student Service Building]]

Vancouver Island University was founded in 1969 as Malaspina College, named after Captain [[Alexandro Malaspina]], who explored [[Vancouver Island]]. Following a 1988 government initiative designed to increase access to degree programs in [[British Columbia]], five community colleges in BC were granted authority to offer baccalaureate degrees, and these five institutions â Malaspina, [[University of the Fraser Valley|Fraser Valley]], [[Kwantlen Polytechnic University|Kwantlen]], [[Thompson Rivers University|Cariboo]] and [[Okanagan University College|Okanagan]] â were renamed university colleges. Initially, they offered degrees through one or another of the three provincial universities. 

Malaspina College had regional campuses in Nanaimo, Duncan, and Powell River by 1990.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=U1ARTU0000768 The Encyclopedia of Music in Canada&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 they were awarded the authority to offer degrees in their own right.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0010058 University College&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the province of British Columbia enacted legislation changing the institution's name to Malaspina University-College and allowing it to begin granting academic degrees and college diplomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2005-2009/2008OTP0096-000572.htm BC Ministry of Advanced Education]&lt;/ref&gt; Malaspina University-College's Arms and Badge were registered with the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] on May 20, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.gg.ca/heraldry/pub-reg/project.asp?lang=e&amp;ProjectID=529 Arms and Badge&lt;/ref&gt; 

Malaspina University-College was upgraded to a university under an amendment of the ''University Act'' and officially began operation as VIU on September 1, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.news.gov.bc.ca/news_releases_2005-2009/2008ALMD0083-001899.htm VANCOUVER ISLAND UNIVERSITY EVENT CELEBRATES NEW STATUS]&lt;/ref&gt;

The B.A. Major and Minor in First Nations Studies are products of a collaboration between Vancouver Island University and the First Nations of Vancouver Island and Coastal British Columbia. Their purpose is to provide comprehensive, high-quality education respectful of the cultures of Aboriginal peoples, while meeting their diverse needs.  The Child and Youth Care Diploma Program based at the Cowichan Campus (Duncan) works with Elders and Firsts Nations leaders from the Coast Salish tradition to prepare graduates to work with children, youth, families and communities in a manner that is described as bi-cultural.
