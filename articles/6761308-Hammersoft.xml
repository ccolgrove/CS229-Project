==Career==
Prior to her role in ''[[Jane Eyre (2006 TV serial)|Jane Eyre]]'', Wilson had only one professional screen credit, in ''[[Suburban Shootout]]'', a [[situation comedy]]. Since then, Wilson has stated she is &quot;going to better auditions. People are starting to see me, when they wouldn't have done, beforeâsuddenly you have done a big show, and have got a bit more standing.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/4780841.stm |title=Jane Eyre star's fast-rising fame |accessdate=2008-08-30 |work=[[BBC News]] |author=Stephen Robb  | date=10 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006â7 she filmed the second series of ''Suburban Shootout'', a new ''[[Marple (TV series)|Marple]]'' mystery for [[ITV]], and [[Stephen Poliakoff]]'s [[BBC]] television drama ''[[Capturing Mary]]'' as the young Mary.

During the winter of 2007 Wilson took six months off. She said: &quot;I simply want to take a break and catch my breath.  But I also think that, sometimes, the bravest thing you can do is to deliberately keep some time free and see what the world throws at you.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Knight, Kathryn. &quot;Bye Bye Bonnets&quot;, ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ''Weekend'', 2007-11-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 23 July to 3 October 2009 she appeared as Stella in the [[Donmar Warehouse|Donmar]] revival of ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]].''&lt;ref name= &quot;Donmar Warehouse&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.donmarwarehouse.com/pl102info.html | publisher = Donmar Warehouse | title = Past Productions}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On November 15, 2009 [[AMC (TV network)|AMC Television]] and [[ITV]] premiered the 2009 TV [[miniseries]] remake of ''[[The Prisoner (2009 miniseries)|The Prisoner]]'', in which Wilson played the Village doctor, &quot;Number 313.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;AMC&quot;&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.amctv.com/originals/the-prisoner/ | publisher = AMC TV | series = Originals | title = The Prisoner}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Starting on BBC1 on 6 December 2009, she played &quot;Queenie&quot; in an adaptation of [[Andrea Levy|Andrea Levy's]] ''[[Small Island (television drama)|Small Island]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/comingup/smallisland/|title=BBC - Small Island|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also aired in the United States on [[PBS]] in 2010.

From 4 August to 8 October 2011, alongside [[Jude Law]], Wilson is starring in the title role of [[Eugene O'Neill]]'s ''[[Anna Christie]]'' at the [[Donmar Warehouse]], a performance which prompted  ''[[The Guardian]]'' to devote an [[editorial]] to Wilson's &quot;courageous, edgy and compelling talent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In praise of â¦ Ruth Wilson|date=16 August 2011|work=[[The Guardian]]|page=30|accessdate=16 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
