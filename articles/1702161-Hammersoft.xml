'''Peter Thomas Barton''' (born July 19, 1956) is an American actor. In the 1980s and 1990s, he starred in ''[[The Powers of Matthew Star]]'', with [[Louis Gossett, Jr.]]; ''[[Burke's Law]]'' with [[Gene Barry]]; and the [[soap opera]] ''[[Sunset Beach (TV series)|Sunset Beach]]''.  Named one of the 10 sexiest guys in soaps by ''[[Playgirl]]'',&lt;ref&gt;IMDb&lt;/ref&gt; Barton is probably best known as Dr. Scott Grainger on the daytime drama ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''.

==Early life==
Originally from Valley Stream, Long Island, as a youngster, he was terrified of [[Cruella De Vil]] from ''[[One Hundred and One Dalmatians]]'' (1961). He was a graduate of [[Valley Stream North High School]], where he played soccer and wrestled. After graduation he attended [[Nassau Community College]] and was later accepted into [[St. John's University's medical school]]. But, just before signing up for classes, he got cold feet and instead decided to pursue a career in modeling and acting. 

==Career==
Even though he had no formal acting training, in 1979 he starred as Bill Miller in the short-lived [[television program|TV series]], ''Shirley'', starring [[Shirley Jones]], [[Rosanna Arquette]], and [[Tracey Gold]]. The show only ran for 13 episodes, but was great family entertainment. The studio connected him with prominent acting coach [[Vincent Chase]], and when the series ended, he was cast as the lead in another NBC series, ''[[The Powers of Matthew Star]]''.  He beat out [[Tom Cruise]] for the role. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where Is He Now: Peter Barton (Actor) as Matthew Star - The Powers of Matthew Star|url=http://www.celebritynooz.com/Peter_Barton.aspx|work=CelebrityNooz.com|publisher=EVTV1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, teen magazines were looking for the next big cover and he was that hearthrob.   He was on the cover of every teen magazine available, typicallly in some sort of sexy pose without his shirt on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where are they now?|url=http://www.fridaythe13thfilms.com/saga/part4/peterbarton.html|work=Peter Barton - &quot;Doug&quot;|publisher=Friday the 13th Films|accessdate=8/13/2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also appeared on many TV shows and daytime soap operas like the Young and the Restless. 

Dr. Scott Grainger showed up on the scene in Genoa City in the late 80â²s and fell in love with one of his patientâs daughters. They became engaged until they discovered that he was her half-brother. Gross. Scott moved on and married Lauren but also messed around with crazy nurse Sheila. Slut. Both women became pregnant with Scottâs child. Crazy Sheilaâs baby was born stillborn so of course she stole Laurenâs baby and pretended it was her own. Scott married Sheila and then he eventually died. Scott Grainger is still mentioned from time to time on The Young &amp; the Restless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Henry, PhD.|first=Rev. Stephen B.|title=Peter Barton|url=http://ztams.msmalls.com/?p=813|work=Blog|publisher=TZams}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quote From Peter Barton==

&quot;I started acting in 1979. By the end of '80, I was under contract with NBC. Then the teen magazines were so hungry for the next heartthrob that they pummeled me. I was on the cover of Tiger Beat, 16 Magazine, all of them. And here I was, twenty-two years old and NBC was saying I'm only nineteen. Then, just as my contract was running out, under obligation, they cast me in a series called ''[[The Powers of Matthew Starr]]''. Amy Steel was in it. Then I did some guest spots on ''[[The Fall Guy]]'' and ''[[The Love Boat]]''.

By the end of '83, it had all dried up. That whole experience - I was going up and down, like on a roller coaster. I was on such an incredible high - no drugs, just high - that when I came out the other side I crashed. That's when I wanted to give up acting, and that's when The Final Chapter came along. I had just been talked into doing this movie called Hell Night, with [[Linda Blair]]. I didn't even want to do it - they had to get me drunk to convince me. So it was a miserable time, and it was a great time. I wouldn't exchange the experience of making Hell Night, even though I was petrified all the way through it. So when The Final Chapter was offered to me, I was like, 'I don't really want to do Friday the 13th.' Eventually, I only did it because of Amy Steel - she talked me into it. And I thought it was really cool because it was The Final Chapter. In my mind, I thought, 'Oh, I'll be in the last one. That's kind of cool. These things are famous.' Little did I know.&quot; p.102 &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bracke|first=Peter|title=Crystal Lake Memories: The Complete History of Friday The 13th|year=2006|publisher=Titan Books|isbn=1845763432|pages=320|url=http://fridaythe13thfilms.com/media/books/crystallakebook.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
