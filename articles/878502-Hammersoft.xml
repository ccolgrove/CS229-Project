'''Michael James &quot;Mike&quot; Boddicker''' (born August 23, 1957,  [[Cedar Rapids]], [[Iowa]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.desmoinesregister.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20000813/SPORTS11/50623021 ''Des Moines Register'' article]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a right-handed [[Major League Baseball]] [[pitcher]] for the [[Baltimore Orioles]] (1980â1988), [[Boston Red Sox]] (1988â1990), [[Kansas City Royals]] (1991â1992), and [[Milwaukee Brewers]] (1993). He was the [[1983 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] MVP in [[1983 in baseball|1983]] and was an American League All-Star in 1984.  He is currently an announcer for the Orioles.

==Early years==
Boddicker was born in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]] on August 23, 1957.&lt;ref name=&quot;mboddickerbbref&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/b/boddimi01.shtml Mike Boddicker (statistics &amp; history) &amp;ndash; Baseball-Reference.com.]&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestors emigrated in 1861 from the [[Province of Westphalia]], which was situated in current-day [[Germany]], and were among the original settlers of [[Norway, Iowa]], where he was raised. He was the youngest of five children to Harold and Dolly. His [[father]], who was commonly known as Bus, operated a travelling [[hammermill]] for [[cereal|grain]] milling before becoming a [[janitor|custodian]] at the local [[elementary school]].&lt;ref name=&quot;swulfsi&quot;&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1121583/1/index.htm Wulf, Steve. &quot;He Has Returned To His Roots,&quot; ''Sports Illustrated'', December 19, 1983.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball career==
Boddicker's pitching repertoire, once called &quot;[[Little League Baseball|Little League]] slop&quot; by [[Rod Carew]], featured [[off-speed pitch]]es and deception to compensate for a lack of power.&lt;ref name=&quot;mklingamantdbs&quot;&gt;[http://weblogs.baltimoresun.com/sports/thetoydepartment/2010/04/catching_up_with_former_oriole_7.html Klingaman, Mike. &quot;Catching Up With...former Oriole Mike Boddicker,&quot; ''The Toy Department'' (''The Baltimore Sun'' sports blog), Thursday, April 8, 2010.]&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to throw from three different [[arm]] angles. He had a [[fastball]] that never came close to reaching 90 miles per hour. The one pitch that made him famous was the fosh, which he called &quot;a glorified [[changeup]].&quot; Another one he used with success was the [[slurve]]. [[Tony Phillips]] once commented, &quot;What I noticed about him is that he lets you get yourself out. I find myself sometimes actually jumping at his pitches, being overanxious because he doesn't throw very fast, and I wind up popping the ball up.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;iberkownyt&quot;&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/1988/10/09/sports/sports-of-the-times-mike-boddicker-and-his-fosh-ball.html?pagewanted=1 Berkow, Ira. &quot;Sports of The Times; Mike Boddicker And His Fosh Ball,&quot; ''The New York Times'', Sunday, October 9, 1988.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Boddicker had a W-L record of 134-116 with a 3.80 ERA during his career. His best season was [[1984 in baseball|1984]] when he went 20-11 with a 2.79 [[Earned run average|ERA]] (leading the [[American League]] in both wins and ERA). He also won the [[List of AL Gold Glove Winners at Pitcher|Gold Glove Award]] in [[1990 in baseball|1990]].

In the 1983 postseason with the Baltimore Orioles, Boddicker pitched brilliantly.  With his team down 1-0 in both the ALCS and World Series, Boddicker pitched his team out of the hole by winning Game 2 of the ALCS 4-0 vs the Chicago White Sox (complete game shutout) and Game 2 of the World Series 4-1 vs the Philadelphia Phillies en route to a world championship.

On July 29, 1988, Boddicker was traded from the Orioles to the [[Boston Red Sox]] for OF [[Brady Anderson]] and pitcher [[Curt Schilling]]. Boddicker went 7-3 down the stretch for the Sox, helping them win the AL East crown that year. He went 15-11 in [[1989 in baseball|1989]] and had a stellar season in 1990, going 17-8 with a 3.36 ERA while helping the Red Sox win another division title.

After signing with the Royals, he finished 12-12 with a 4.08 ERA in 1991, his last full season (30 games). After his contract was purchased by the Brewers, he pitched 54 innings for them in 1993, his final year. He finished 3-5 with a 5.67 ERA that year.

==Family==
Mike has a wife, Lisa and four children: daughters, Stephanie and Brittany, and sons, Cory and James. He has two grandchildren.
