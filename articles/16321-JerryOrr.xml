'''Joseph Raymond &quot;Joe&quot; McCarthy''' (November 14, 1908{{ndash}} May 2, 1957) was an [[United States|American]] politician who served as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] from the state of [[Wisconsin]] from 1947 until his death in 1957. Beginning in 1950, McCarthy became the most visible public face of a period in which [[Cold War]] tensions fueled fears of widespread [[Communist party|Communist]] [[Subversion (politics)|subversion]].&lt;ref&gt;

He was noted for making claims that there were large numbers of Communists and [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] spies and sympathizers inside the United States federal government and elsewhere. Ultimately, McCarthy's tactics and his inability to substantiate his claims led him to be [[Censure in the United States|censured]] by the United States Senate.

The term ''[[McCarthyism]],'' coined in 1950 in reference to McCarthy's practices, was soon applied to similar [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] activities. Today the term is used more generally in reference to [[demagogy|demagogic]], reckless, and unsubstantiated accusations, as well as public attacks on the character and/or patriotism of political opponents.&lt;ref&gt;
''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language|The American Heritage Dictionary]]'' (2000) defines &quot;McCarthyism&quot; as &quot;the practice of publicizing accusations of political disloyalty or subversion with insufficient regard to evidence&quot; and &quot;the use of unfair investigatory or accusatory methods in order to suppress opposition&quot;. [[Webster's Dictionary|''Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Unabridged'' (1961)]] defines it as &quot;characterized chiefly by opposition to elements held to be subversive and by the use of tactics involving personal attacks on individuals by means of widely publicized indiscriminate allegations especially on the basis of unsubstantiated charges&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born and raised on a Wisconsin farm, McCarthy earned a law degree at [[Marquette University Law School|Marquette University]] in 1935 and was elected as a [[Wisconsin Circuit Court|circuit]] judge in 1939, the youngest in state history.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; At age 33, McCarthy volunteered for the [[United States Marine Corps]] and served during [[World War II]]. He successfully ran for the United States Senate in 1946, defeating [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]] After three largely undistinguished years in the Senate, McCarthy rose suddenly to national fame in February 1950 when he asserted in a speech that he had a list of &quot;members of the Communist Party and members of a spy ring&quot; who were employed in the [[United States Department of State|State Department]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|title = Communists in Government Service, McCarthy Says  |publisher = United States Senate History Website|url = http://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Communists_In_Government_Service.htm|accessdate = 2007-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy was never able to prove his sensational charge.

In succeeding years, McCarthy made additional accusations of Communist infiltration into the State Department, the administration of President [[Harry S. Truman]], [[Voice of America]], and the [[United States Army]]. He also used charges of communism, communist sympathies, or disloyalty to attack a number of politicians and other individuals inside and outside of government. With the highly publicized [[ArmyâMcCarthy hearings]] of 1954, McCarthy's support and popularity began to fade. On December 2, 1954, the Senate voted to [[Censure in the United States|censure]] Senator McCarthy by a vote of 67 to 22, making him one of the few senators ever to be disciplined in this fashion. McCarthy died in [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda Naval Hospital]] on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. The official cause of death was acute [[hepatitis]]; it is widely accepted that this was exacerbated by [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name=causeofdeath&gt;

==Early life and career==
McCarthy was born on a farm in the [[Political subdivisions of Wisconsin#Town|town]] of [[Grand Chute, Wisconsin]], near [[Appleton, Wisconsin|Appleton]], the fifth of seven children.&lt;ref&gt;

His mother, Bridget Tierney, was from [[County Tipperary]], Ireland. His father, Timothy McCarthy, was born in the United States, the son of an Irish father and a German mother. McCarthy dropped out of junior high school at age 14 to help his parents manage their farm. He entered Little Wolf High School, in [[Manawa, Wisconsin]], when he was 20 and graduated in one year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.myhistorymuseum.org/mccarthy/student.htm McCarthy as Student&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 

McCarthy worked his way through college, from 1930 to 1935, studying first engineering, then law, and eventually earning a law degree at [[Marquette University]] in [[Milwaukee]].&lt;ref&gt;In ''A Conspiracy So Immense,'' Oshinsky states that McCarthy chose Marquette University rather than the [[University of WisconsinâMadison]] partially because Marquette was under Catholic control and partially because he enrolled during the Great Depression, when few working-class or farm-bred students had the money to go out of state for college.

  |origyear= 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was admitted to the [[Bar association|bar]] in 1935. While working in a law firm in [[Shawano, Wisconsin]], he launched an unsuccessful campaign to become [[district attorney]] as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in 1936. In 1939, McCarthy had better success: he successfully vied for the elected post of the non-partisan 10th District [[Wisconsin Circuit Court|circuit]] judge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.galenfrysinger.org/judge_on_trial.htm Judge on Trial, McCarthy - A Documented Record, The Progressive, April 1954&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'Wisconsin Blue Book 1940,' pg. 382, 627&lt;/ref&gt; During his years as an attorney, McCarthy made money on the side by gambling.&lt;ref&gt;
Oshinsky explains this (p. 17) as resulting partially from the financial pressures of the Great Depression. He also notes (p. 28) that even during his judgeship, McCarthy was known to have gambled heavily after hours.

McCarthy's judicial career attracted some controversy due to the speed with which he dispatched many of his cases. He had inherited a docket with a heavy backlog and he worked constantly to clear it. At times he compensated for his lack of experience by demanding, and relying heavily upon, precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The [[Wisconsin Supreme Court]] reversed a relatively low percentage of the cases he heard.&lt;ref&gt;

===Military service===
[[File:JosephMcCarthyMilitary.jpg|right|thumb|Joseph McCarthy in his U.S. [[Marine Corps Uniforms|Marine Corps uniform]]]]
In 1942, shortly after the U.S. entered World War II, McCarthy was commissioned into the [[United States Marine Corps]], despite the fact that his judicial office exempted him from compulsory service. His education qualified him for an automatic [[officer (armed forces)#Commissioned officers|commission]] as an officer, and he became a [[Second Lieutenant#United States|second lieutenant]] after completing [[The Basic School|basic training]]. He served as an [[military intelligence|intelligence]] briefing officer for a [[dive bomber]] squadron in the [[Solomon Islands]] and [[Autonomous Region of Bougainville|Bougainville]]. McCarthy reportedly chose the Marines with the hope that being a veteran of this branch of the military would serve him best in his future political career.&lt;ref name=Arthur1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;  

He would leave the Marines with the rank of [[Captain (United States)|captain]].
It is well documented that McCarthy lied about his war record. Despite his automatic commission, he claimed to have enlisted as a &quot;buck private&quot;. He flew twelve combat missions as a gunner-observer, earning the nickname of &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot; in the course of one of these missions.&lt;ref&gt;Oshinsky describes the nickname &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot; as the result of McCarthy's wish to break the record for most live ammunition discharged in a single mission.

He later claimed 32 missions in order to qualify for a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]], which he received in 1952. McCarthy publicized a letter of commendation which he claimed had been signed by his commanding officer and countersigned by Admiral [[Chester W. Nimitz]], then Chief of Naval Operations. However, it was revealed that McCarthy had written this letter himself, in his capacity as intelligence officer. A &quot;war wound&quot; that McCarthy made the subject of varying stories involving airplane crashes or antiaircraft fire was in fact received aboard ship during a [[Line-crossing ceremony|ceremony for sailors crossing the equator for the first time]].&lt;ref name=Arthur1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

McCarthy campaigned for the Republican Senate nomination in Wisconsin while still on active duty in 1944 but was defeated for the GOP [[nomination]] by [[Alexander Wiley]], the incumbent. He resigned his commission in April 1945, five months before the end of the Pacific war in September 1945. He was then reelected unopposed to his circuit court position, and began a much more systematic campaign for the 1946 Republican Senate [[Primary election|primary]] nomination. In this race, he was challenging three-term senator and [[Wisconsin Progressive Party]] icon [[Robert M. La Follette, Jr.]]

===Senate campaign===

La Follette, Jr.]], in the 1946 Republican primary in Wisconsin. Drawn by Clifford K. Berryman. {{deletable image-caption}}]] --&gt;

In his campaign, McCarthy attacked La Follette for not enlisting during the war, although La Follette had been 46 when [[Pearl Harbor]] was bombed. He also claimed La Follette had made huge profits from his investments while he, McCarthy, had been away fighting for his country. In fact, McCarthy had invested in the stock market himself during the war, netting a profit of $42,000 in 1943. La Follette's investments consisted of partial interest in a radio station, which earned him a profit of $47,000 over two years.&lt;ref&gt;

The suggestion that La Follette had been guilty of [[war profiteering]] was deeply damaging, and McCarthy won the primary nomination 207,935 votes to 202,557. It was during this campaign that McCarthy started publicizing his war-time nickname &quot;Tail-Gunner Joe&quot;, using the slogan, &quot;Congress needs a tail-gunner&quot;. [[Arnold Beichman]] later stated that McCarthy &quot;was elected to his first term in the Senate with support from the Communist-controlled [[United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America|United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers]], [[Congress of Industrial Organizations|CIO]]&quot;, which preferred McCarthy to the anti-communist Robert M. La Follette.&lt;ref&gt;

In the general election against Democratic opponent [[Howard J. McMurray]], McCarthy won 61.2% to Democrat McMurray's 37.3%, and thus joined Senator Wiley, whom he had challenged unsuccessfully two years earlier, in the Senate.

==United States Senate==
McCarthy's first three years in the Senate were unremarkable. McCarthy was a popular speaker, invited by many different organizations, covering a wide range of topics. His aides and many in the Washington social circle described him as charming and friendly, and he was a popular guest at cocktail parties. He was far less well liked among fellow senators, however, who found him quick-tempered and prone to impatience and even rage. Outside of a small circle of colleagues, he was soon an isolated figure in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

He was active in labor-management issues, with a reputation as a moderate Republican. He fought against continuation of wartime price controls, especially on sugar. His advocacy in this area was associated by critics with a $20,000 personal loan McCarthy received from a [[Pepsi]] bottling executive, earning the Senator the derisive nickname &quot;The Pepsi Cola Kid&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

In an incident for which he would be widely criticized, McCarthy lobbied for the commutation of death sentences given to a group of [[Waffen-SS]] soldiers convicted of war crimes for carrying out the 1944 [[Malmedy massacre]] of American prisoners of war. McCarthy was critical of the convictions because of allegations of torture during the interrogations that led to the German soldiers' confessions. He charged that the U.S. Army was engaged in a coverup of judicial misconduct, but never presented any evidence to support the accusation.&lt;ref&gt;

===Wheeling speech===
McCarthy experienced a meteoric rise in national profile on February 9, 1950, when he gave a [[Lincoln Day]] speech to the Republican Women's Club of [[Wheeling, West Virginia]]. His words in the speech are a matter of some debate, as no audio recording was saved. However, it is generally agreed that he produced a piece of paper that he claimed contained a list of known Communists working for the [[United States Department of State|State Department]]. McCarthy is usually quoted to have said: &quot;The State Department is infested with communists. I have here in my hand a list of 205âa list of names that were made known to the [[Secretary of state (U.S. state government)|Secretary of State]] as being members of the Communist Party and who nevertheless are still working and shaping policy in the State Department.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

There is some dispute about whether or not McCarthy actually gave the number of people on the list as being &quot;205&quot; or &quot;57&quot;. In a later telegram to President Truman, and when entering the speech into the [[Congressional Record]], he used the number 57.&lt;ref name=&quot;CongRec81&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The origin of the number 205 can be traced: In later debates on the Senate floor, McCarthy referred to a 1946 letter that thenâ[[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[James F. Byrnes|James Byrnes]] sent to Congressman [[Adolph J. Sabath]]. In that letter, Byrnes said State Department security investigations had resulted in &quot;recommendation against permanent employment&quot; for 284 persons, and that 79 of these had been removed from their jobs; this left 205 still on the State Department's payroll.  In fact, by the time of McCarthy's speech only about 65 of the employees mentioned in the Byrnes letter were still with the State Department, and all of these had undergone further security checks.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of McCarthy's speech, communism was a growing concern in the United States. This concern was exacerbated by the actions of the Soviet Union in [[Eastern Europe]], the [[Chinese Civil War#Fighting in mainland China (1946â1950)|fall of China]] to the communists, the Soviets' development of the [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]] the year before, and by the contemporary controversy surrounding [[Alger Hiss]] and the confession of Soviet spy [[Klaus Fuchs]]. With this background and due to the sensational nature of McCarthy's charge against the State Department, the Wheeling speech soon attracted a flood of press interest in McCarthy.

===Tydings Committee===
McCarthy himself was taken aback by the massive media response to the Wheeling speech, and he was accused of continually revising both his charges and his figures. In [[Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]], a few days later, he cited a figure of 57, and in the Senate on February 20, he claimed 81.{{citation}} During a five-hour speech,&lt;ref&gt;Also reported as up to 8 hours in length.&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy presented a case-by-case analysis of his 81 &quot;loyalty risks&quot; employed at the State Department. It is widely accepted that most of McCarthy's cases were selected from the so-called &quot;Lee list&quot;, a report that had been compiled three years earlier for the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]]. Led by a former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] agent named Robert E. Lee, the House investigators had reviewed security clearance documents on State Department employees, and had determined that there were &quot;incidents of inefficiencies&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

in the security reviews of 108 employees. McCarthy hid the source of his list, stating that he had penetrated the &quot;iron curtain&quot; of State Department secrecy with the aid of &quot;some good, loyal Americans in the State Department&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Millardetydings.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Senator [[Millard Tydings]]]]

In response to McCarthy's charges, the [[Tydings Committee]] hearings were called. This was a subcommittee of the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]] set up in February 1950 to conduct &quot;a full and complete study and investigation as to whether persons who are disloyal to the United States are, or have been, employed by the Department of State&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Many [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] politicians were incensed at McCarthy's attack on the State Department of a Democratic administration, and had hoped to use the hearings to discredit him. The Democratic chairman of the subcommittee, Senator [[Millard Tydings]], was reported to have said, &quot;Let me have him [McCarthy] for three days in public hearings, and he'll never show his face in the Senate again.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

During the hearings, McCarthy moved on from his original unnamed Lee list cases and used the hearings to make charges against nine specific people: [[Dorothy Kenyon]], Esther Brunauer, Haldore Hanson, [[Gustavo DurÃ¡n]], [[Owen Lattimore]], [[Harlow Shapley]], Frederick Schuman, [[John S. Service]], and [[Philip Jessup]]. Some of them no longer worked for the State Department, or never had; all had previously been the subject of charges of varying worth and validity. Owen Lattimore became a particular focus of McCarthy's, who at one point described him as a &quot;top Russian spy&quot;. Throughout the hearings, McCarthy employed colorful rhetoric, but produced no substantial evidence, to support his accusations.{{citation needed|date=June 2009}}

From its beginning, the Tydings Committee was marked by partisan infighting. Its final report, written by the Democratic majority, concluded that the individuals on McCarthy's list were neither Communists nor pro-communist, and said the State Department had an effective security program. The Tydings Report labeled McCarthy's charges a &quot;fraud and a hoax&quot;, and said that the result of McCarthy's actions was to &quot;confuse and divide the American people [...] to a degree far beyond the hopes of the Communists themselves&quot;. Republicans responded in kind, with [[William E. Jenner]] stating that Tydings was guilty of &quot;the most brazen whitewash of treasonable conspiracy in our history&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Fame and notoriety===
From 1950 onward, McCarthy continued to exploit the [[Red Scare|fear of Communism]] and to press his accusations that the government was failing to deal with Communism within its ranks. These accusations received wide publicity, increased his approval rating, and gained him a powerful national following.

[[File:Herblock1950.jpg|thumb|250px|left|[[Herblock|Herbert Block]], who signed his work &quot;Herblock&quot;, coined the term &quot;[[McCarthyism]]&quot; in this cartoon in the March 29, 1950 ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]].'']]

McCarthy's methods also brought on the disapproval and opposition of many. Barely a month after McCarthy's Wheeling speech, the term &quot;McCarthyism&quot; was coined by ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' cartoonist [[Herblock|Herbert Block]]. Block and others used the word as a synonym for [[demagogy|demagoguery]], baseless defamation, and mudslinging. Later, it would be embraced by McCarthy and some of his supporters. &quot;McCarthyism is Americanism with its sleeves rolled,&quot; McCarthy said in a 1952 speech, and later that year he published a book titled ''McCarthyism: The Fight For America.''

McCarthy has been accused of attempting to discredit his critics and political opponents by accusing them of being Communists or communist sympathizers. In the 1950 Maryland Senate election, McCarthy campaigned for [[John Marshall Butler]] in his race against four-term incumbent [[Millard Tydings]], with whom McCarthy had been in conflict during the Tydings Committee hearings. In speeches supporting Butler, McCarthy accused Tydings of &quot;protecting Communists&quot; and &quot;shielding traitors&quot;. McCarthy's staff was heavily involved in the campaign, and collaborated in the production of a campaign tabloid that contained a composite photograph doctored to make it appear that Tydings was in intimate conversation with Communist leader [[Earl Russell Browder]].&lt;ref&gt;

A Senate subcommittee later investigated this election and referred to it as &quot;a despicable, back-street type of campaign&quot;, as well as recommending that the use of defamatory literature in a campaign be made grounds for expulsion from the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;

In addition to the Tydings-Butler race, McCarthy campaigned for several other Republicans in the [[United States Senate elections, 1950|1950 elections]], including that of [[Everett Dirksen]] against Democratic incumbent and Senate Majority Leader [[Scott W. Lucas]]. Dirksen, and indeed all the candidates McCarthy supported, won their elections, and those he opposed lost. The elections, including many that McCarthy was not involved in, were an overall Republican sweep. Although his impact on the elections was unclear, McCarthy was credited as a key Republican campaigner. He was now regarded as one of the most powerful men in the Senate and was treated with new-found deference by his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;

===McCarthy and the Truman administration===
McCarthy and [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] clashed often during the years both held office. McCarthy characterized Truman and the Democratic Party as soft on, or even in league with, Communists, and spoke of the Democrats' &quot;twenty years of treason&quot;. Truman, in turn, once referred to McCarthy as &quot;the best asset the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] has&quot;, calling McCarthy's actions an attempt to &quot;sabotage the foreign policy of the United States&quot; in a cold war and comparing it to shooting American soldiers in the back in a hot war.&lt;ref&gt;

It was the Truman Administration's State Department that McCarthy accused of harboring 205 (or 57 or 81) &quot;known Communists&quot;. Truman's [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[George Marshall|George Catlett Marshall]] was the target of some of McCarthy's most vitriolic rhetoric. Marshall had been [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] during World War II and was also Truman's former [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. Marshall was a highly respected General and statesman, remembered today as both the architect of victory and the architect of peace, the latter based on the [[Marshall Plan]] for post-war reconstruction of Europe, for which he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1953. McCarthy made a lengthy speech on Marshall, later published in 1951 as a book titled ''America's Retreat From Victory: The Story Of George Catlett Marshall.'' Marshall had been involved in American foreign policy with China, and McCarthy charged that Marshall was directly responsible for the loss of China to Communism. In the speech McCarthy also implied that Marshall was guilty of treason;&lt;ref name=&quot;Retreat&quot;&gt;

===Support from Catholics and Kennedy family===
One of the strongest bases of anti-Communist sentiment in the United States was the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although the great majority of Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.&lt;ref&gt;

McCarthy established a bond with the powerful [[Kennedy family]], which had high visibility among Catholics. McCarthy became a close friend of [[Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr.]], himself a fervent anti-Communist, and was a frequent guest at the Kennedy compound in [[Hyannis Port, Massachusetts|Hyannis Port]]. He dated two of Kennedy's daughters, [[Patricia Kennedy Lawford|Patricia]] and [[Eunice Kennedy Shriver|Eunice]],&lt;ref&gt;

Mindful of the anti-Catholic prejudice [[Al Smith]] faced during his [[United States presidential election, 1928|1928 campaign]] for that office, Joseph Kennedy supported McCarthy as a national Catholic politician who might pave the way for a younger Kennedy's presidential candidacy.

Unlike many Democrats, [[John F. Kennedy]], who served in the Senate with McCarthy from 1953 until the latter's death in 1957, never attacked McCarthy. McCarthy had refused to campaign for Kennedy's [[United States Senate election in Massachusetts, 1952|1952 opponent]], Republican incumbent [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], due to his friendship with the Kennedys.&lt;ref name=amex&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/kennedys/ ''The Kennedys''].

===McCarthy and Eisenhower===
[[File:Dwight D Eisenhower official photograph.jpg|thumb|right|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], 34th President of the United States]]
During the [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952 presidential election]], the Eisenhower campaign toured Wisconsin with McCarthy. In a speech delivered in [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]], Eisenhower declared that while he agreed with McCarthy's goals, he disagreed with his methods. In draft versions of his speech, Eisenhower had also included a strong defense of his mentor, George Marshall, which was a direct rebuke of McCarthy's frequent attacks. However, under the advice of [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] colleagues who were fearful that Eisenhower could lose Wisconsin if he alienated McCarthy supporters, he deleted this defense from later versions of his speech.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated15&quot;&gt;

The deletion was discovered by a reporter for ''[[The New York Times]]'' and featured on their front page the next day. Eisenhower was widely criticized for giving up his personal convictions, and the incident became the low point of his campaign.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated15&quot;/&gt;

With his victory in the 1952 presidential race, Dwight Eisenhower became the first Republican president in 20 years. The Republican party also held a majority in the House of Representatives and the Senate. After being elected president, Eisenhower made it clear to those close to him that he did not approve of McCarthy and he worked actively to diminish his power and influence. Still, he never directly confronted McCarthy or criticized him by name in any speech, thus perhaps prolonging McCarthy's power by giving the impression that even the President was afraid to criticize him directly. Oshinsky disputes this, stating that &quot;Eisenhower was known as a harmonizer, a man who could get diverse factions to work toward a common goal&amp;nbsp;... Leadership, he explained, meant patience and conciliation, not 'hitting people over the head.'&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

McCarthy won reelection in 1952 with 54% of the vote, defeating former Wisconsin State Attorney General [[Thomas E. Fairchild]] but badly trailing a Republican ticket which swept the state of Wisconsin; all the other Republican winners, including Eisenhower himself, received at least 60% of the Wisconsin vote.&lt;ref&gt;

Those who expected that party loyalty would cause McCarthy to tone down his accusations of Communists being harbored within the government were soon disappointed. Eisenhower had never been an admirer of McCarthy, and their relationship became more hostile once Eisenhower was in office. In a November 1953 speech that was carried on national television, McCarthy began by praising the Eisenhower Administration for removing &quot;1,456 Truman holdovers who were&amp;nbsp;... gotten rid of because of Communist connections and activities or perversion&quot;. He then went on to complain that [[John Paton Davies, Jr.]] was still &quot;on the payroll after eleven months of the Eisenhower Administration&quot;, even though Davies had actually been dismissed three weeks earlier, and repeated an unsubstantiated accusation that Davies had tried to &quot;put Communists and espionage agents in key spots in the [[Central Intelligence Agency]]&quot;. In the same speech, he criticized Eisenhower for not doing enough to secure the release of missing American pilots shot down over China during the Korean War.&lt;ref&gt;

As McCarthy became increasingly combative towards the Eisenhower Administration, Eisenhower faced repeated calls that he confront McCarthy directly.

===Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations===
With the beginning of his second term as senator in 1953, McCarthy was made chairman of the Senate Committee on Government Operations. According to some reports, Republican leaders were growing wary of McCarthy's methods and gave him this relatively mundane panel rather than the [[United States Senate Subcommittee on Internal Security|Internal Security Subcommittee]]&amp;mdash;the committee normally involved with investigating Communists&amp;mdash;thus putting McCarthy &quot;where he can't do any harm&quot;, in the words of Senate Majority Leader [[Robert Taft]].&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the Committee on Government Operations included the [[United States Senate Homeland Security Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations|Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations]], and the mandate of this subcommittee was sufficiently flexible to allow McCarthy to use it for his own investigations of Communists in the government. McCarthy appointed [[Roy Cohn]] as chief counsel and 27-year-old [[Robert F. Kennedy]] as an assistant counsel to the subcommittee.

This subcommittee would be the scene of some of McCarthy's most publicized exploits. When the records of the closed executive sessions of the subcommittee under McCarthy's chairmanship were made public in 2003â4,&lt;ref&gt;See &quot;Transcripts, Executive Sessions...&quot; under Primary sources, below.&lt;/ref&gt; Senators [[Susan Collins]] and [[Carl Levin]] wrote the following in their preface to the documents:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Senator McCarthyâs zeal to uncover subversion and espionage led to disturbing excesses. His browbeating tactics destroyed careers of people who were not involved in the infiltration of our government. His freewheeling style caused both the Senate and the Subcommittee to revise the rules governing future investigations, and prompted the courts to act to protect the Constitutional rights of witnesses at Congressional hearings&amp;nbsp;... These hearings are a part of our national past that we can neither afford to forget nor permit to reoccur.&lt;ref&gt;

The subcommittee first investigated allegations of Communist influence in the [[Voice of America]] (VOA), at that time administered by the State Department's [[United States Information Agency]]. Many VOA personnel were questioned in front of television cameras and a packed press gallery, with McCarthy lacing his questions with hostile innuendo and false accusations.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA&quot;&gt;

A few VOA employees alleged Communist influence on the content of broadcasts, but none of the charges were substantiated. Morale at VOA was badly damaged, and one of its engineers committed suicide during McCarthy's investigation. Ed Kretzman, a policy advisor for the service, would later comment that it was VOA's &quot;darkest hour when Senator McCarthy and his chief hatchet man, Roy Cohn, almost succeeded in muffling it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;VOA&quot;/&gt;

The subcommittee then turned to the overseas library program of the International Information Agency. Cohn toured Europe examining the card catalogs of the State Department libraries looking for works by authors he deemed inappropriate. McCarthy then recited the list of supposedly pro-communist authors before his subcommittee and the press. The State Department bowed to McCarthy and ordered its overseas librarians to remove from their shelves &quot;material by any controversial persons, Communists, [[fellow traveler]]s, etc.&quot; Some libraries actually burned the newly forbidden books.&lt;ref&gt;

Soon after receiving the chair to the Subcommittee on Investigations, McCarthy appointed Joseph Brown Matthews (generally known as [[J. B. Matthews]]) as staff director of the subcommittee. One of the nation's foremost anti-communists, Matthews had formerly been staff director for the [[House Un-American Activities Committee]]. The appointment became controversial when it was learned that Matthews had recently written an article titled &quot;Reds And Our Churches&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;
Often misidentified as &quot;Reds ''In'' Our Churches;&quot; see [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22Reds+and+Our+Churches%22+Matthews&amp;btnG=Search+Books this] versus [http://books.google.com/books?lr=&amp;q=%22Reds+in+Our+Churches%22+Matthews&amp;btnG=Search+Books this].&lt;/ref&gt;
which opened with the sentence, &quot;The largest single group supporting the Communist apparatus in the United States is composed of Protestant Clergymen.&quot; A group of senators denounced this &quot;shocking and unwarranted attack against the American clergy&quot; and demanded that McCarthy dismiss Matthews. McCarthy at first refused to do this. But as the controversy mounted, and the majority of his own subcommittee joined the call for Matthews' ouster, McCarthy finally yielded and accepted his resignation. For some McCarthy opponents, this was a signal defeat of the senator, showing he was not as invincible as he had formerly seemed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Investigating the Army===
In autumn 1953, McCarthy's committee began its ill-fated inquiry into the [[United States Army]]. This began with McCarthy opening an investigation into the [[Signal Corps (United States Army)|Army Signal Corps]] laboratory at [[Fort Monmouth]]. McCarthy, newly married to Jean Kerr, cut short his honeymoon to open the investigation. He garnered some headlines with stories of a dangerous spy ring among the Army researchers, but after weeks of hearings, nothing came of his investigations.&lt;ref&gt;

Unable to expose any signs of subversion, McCarthy focused instead on the case of [[Irving Peress]], a New York dentist who had been drafted into the Army in 1952 and promoted to major in November 1953. Shortly thereafter it came to the attention of the military bureaucracy that Peress, who was a member of the left-wing [[American Labor Party]], had declined to answer questions about his political affiliations on a loyalty-review form. Peress' superiors were therefore ordered to discharge him from the Army within 90 days. McCarthy subpoenaed Peress to appear before his subcommittee on January 30, 1954. Peress refused to answer McCarthy's questions, citing his rights under the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McCarthy responded by sending a message to [[United States Secretary of the Army|Secretary of the Army]], [[Robert Ten Broeck Stevens|Robert Stevens]], demanding that Peress be court-martialed. On that same day, Peress asked for his pending discharge from the Army to be effected immediately, and the next day [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Ralph Wise Zwicker|Ralph W. Zwicker]], his commanding officer at [[Camp Kilmer]] in [[New Jersey]], gave him an honorable separation from the Army. At McCarthy's encouragement, &quot;Who promoted Peress?&quot; became a rallying cry among many anti-communists and McCarthy supporters. In fact, and as McCarthy knew, Peress had been promoted automatically through the provisions of the Doctor Draft Law, for which McCarthy had voted.&lt;ref&gt;

McCarthy summoned General Zwicker to his subcommittee on February 18. Zwicker, on advice from Army counsel, refused to answer some of McCarthy's questions and reportedly changed his story three times when asked if he had known at the time he signed the discharge that Peress had refused to answer questions before the McCarthy subcommittee. McCarthy compared Zwicker's intelligence to that of a &quot;five-year-old child&quot;, and said he was &quot;not fit to wear that uniform&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

This abuse of Zwicker, a battlefield hero of World War II, caused considerable outrage among the military, newspapers, civilian veterans, senators of both parties and, probably most dangerously for McCarthy, President Eisenhower himself.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated138&quot;&gt;

Army Secretary Stevens ordered Zwicker not to return to McCarthy's hearing for further questioning. Hoping to mend the increasingly hostile relations between McCarthy and the Army, a group of Republicans, including McCarthy, met with Secretary Stevens over a luncheon that included fried chicken and convinced him to sign a &quot;memorandum of understanding&quot; in which he capitulated to most of McCarthy's demands. After &quot;The Chicken Luncheon&quot;, as it came to be called, McCarthy later told a reporter that Stevens &quot;could not have given in more abjectly if he had got down on his knees&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated30&quot;&gt;

Reaction to this agreement was widely negative. Secretary Stevens was ridiculed by Pentagon officers,&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated138&quot;/&gt;
and ''[[The Times]]'' of London wrote: &quot;Senator McCarthy achieved today what [[John Burgoyne|General Burgoyne]] and [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] never achievedâthe surrender of the American Army.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated30&quot;/&gt;

A few months later, the Army, with advice and support from the Eisenhower Administration, would launch a counterattack against McCarthy. It would do this not by directly challenging and criticizing McCarthy's behavior toward Army personnel, but by bringing charges against him on an unrelated issue.

===ArmyâMcCarthy hearings===
{{Main|ArmyâMcCarthy hearings}}
Early in 1954, the U.S. Army accused McCarthy and his chief counsel, [[Roy Cohn]], of improperly pressuring the Army to give favorable treatment to [[G. David Schine]], a former aide to McCarthy and a friend of Cohn's, who was then serving in the Army as a private.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, Frederick D. (November/December 2004). [http://americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/ah/2004/6/2004_6_84.shtml &quot;1954 50 Years Ago: The Demagogueâs Downfall&quot;]. ''[[American Heritage (magazine)|American Heritage]]''. Retrieved July 29, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; McCarthy claimed that the accusation was made in bad faith, in retaliation for his questioning of Zwicker the previous year. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, usually chaired by McCarthy himself, was given the task of adjudicating these conflicting charges. Republican Senator [[Karl Earl Mundt|Karl Mundt]] was appointed to chair the committee, and the [[ArmyâMcCarthy hearings]] convened on April 22, 1954.

[[File:McCarthy Cohn.jpg|left|thumb|300px|McCarthy chats with [[Roy Cohn]] (right) at the [[Army-McCarthy hearings]].]]
The hearings lasted for 36 days and were broadcast on [[live television]] by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]], with an estimated 20 million viewers. After hearing 32 witnesses and two million words of testimony, the committee concluded that McCarthy himself had not exercised any improper influence on Schine's behalf, but that Cohn had engaged in &quot;unduly persistent or aggressive efforts&quot;. The committee also concluded that Army Secretary Robert Stevens and Army Counsel John Adams &quot;made efforts to terminate or influence the investigation and hearings at Fort Monmouth&quot;, and that Adams &quot;made vigorous and diligent efforts&quot; to block subpoenas for members of the Army Loyalty and Screening Board &quot;by means of personal appeal to certain members of the [McCarthy] committee&quot;.

Of far greater importance to McCarthy than the committee's inconclusive final report was the negative effect that the extensive exposure had on his popularity. Many in the audience saw him as bullying, reckless, and dishonest, and the daily newspaper summaries of the hearings were also frequently unfavorable.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[Gallup polls]] of January 1954, 50% of those polled had a positive opinion of McCarthy. In June, that number had fallen to 34%. In the same polls, those with a negative opinion of McCarthy increased from 29% to 45%.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated138&quot; /&gt;

An increasing number of Republicans and conservatives were coming to see McCarthy as a liability to the party and to anti-communism. Congressman [[George H. Bender]] noted, &quot;There is a growing impatience with the Republican Party. McCarthyism has become a synonym for witch-hunting, [[Star Chamber]] methods, and the denial of&amp;nbsp;... civil liberties.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

The most famous incident in the hearings was an exchange between McCarthy and the army's chief legal representative, [[Joseph N. Welch|Joseph Nye Welch]]. On June 9, the 30th day of the hearings, Welch challenged Roy Cohn to provide [[United States Attorney General|U.S. Attorney General]] [[Herbert Brownell, Jr.]] with McCarthy's list of 130 Communists or subversives in defense plants &quot;before the sun goes down&quot;. McCarthy stepped in and said that if Welch was so concerned about persons aiding the Communist Party, he should check on a man in his [[Boston]] law office named [[Fred Fisher (lawyer)|Fred Fisher]], who had once belonged to the [[National Lawyers Guild]], which Brownell had called &quot;the legal mouthpiece of the Communist Party&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Welch responded, &quot;Until this moment, Senator, I think I never really gauged your cruelty or your recklessness&amp;nbsp;...&quot; When McCarthy resumed his attack, Welch interrupted him: &quot;Let us not assassinate this lad further, Senator.

===Edward R. Murrow, ''See It Now''===
[[File:Edward r murrow challenge of ideas screenshot 2.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Edward R. Murrow]], pioneer in broadcast journalism]]
One of the most prominent attacks on McCarthy's methods was an episode of the television documentary series ''[[See It Now]]'', hosted by journalist [[Edward R. Murrow]], which was broadcast on March 9, 1954. Titled &quot;A Report on Senator Joseph R. McCarthy&quot;, the episode consisted largely of clips of McCarthy speaking. In these clips, McCarthy accuses the Democratic party of &quot;twenty years of treason&quot;, describes the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] as &quot;listed as 'a front for, and doing the work of', the Communist Party&quot;, and berates and harangues various witnesses, including General Zwicker.

In his conclusion, Murrow said of McCarthy:
{{quote|His primary achievement has been in confusing the public mind, as between the internal and the external threats of Communism. We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. We must remember always that accusation is not proof and that conviction depends upon evidence and due process of law. We will not walk in fear, one of another. We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason, if we dig deep in our history and our doctrine, and remember that we are not descended from fearful men&amp;nbsp;...

We proclaim ourselves, as indeed we are, the defenders of freedom, wherever it continues to exist in the world, but we cannot defend freedom abroad by deserting it at home. The actions of the junior Senator from Wisconsin have caused alarm and dismay amongst our allies abroad, and given considerable comfort to our enemies. And whose fault is that? Not really his. He didn't create this situation of fear; he merely exploited it&amp;mdash;and rather successfully.&lt;ref&gt;

The following week ''See It Now'' ran another episode critical of McCarthy, this one focusing on the case of [[Annie Lee Moss]], an African-American army clerk who was the target of one of McCarthy's investigations. The Murrow shows, together with the televised ArmyâMcCarthy hearings of the same year, were the major causes of a nationwide popular opinion backlash against McCarthy, in part because for the first time his statements were being publicly challenged by noteworthy figures. To counter the negative publicity, McCarthy appeared on ''See It Now'' on April 6, 1954, and made a number of charges against the popular Murrow, including the accusation that he colluded with the &quot;Russian espionage and propaganda organization&quot; [[VOKS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Censure and the Watkins Committee===
[[File:Ralph Edward Flanders.jpg|right|thumb|Senator [[Ralph Flanders]], who introduced the resolution calling for McCarthy to be censured]]
Several members of the U.S. Senate had opposed McCarthy well before 1953. Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]], a [[Maine]] Republican, delivered her &quot;[[Declaration of Conscience]]&quot; on June 1, 1950, calling for an end to the use of smear tactics without mentioning McCarthy or anyone else by name. Six other Republican Senators &amp;mdash; [[Wayne Morse]], [[Irving Ives]], [[Charles W. Tobey]], [[Edward John Thye]], [[George Aiken]], and [[Robert C. Hendrickson]] &amp;mdash; joined her in condemning McCarthy's tactics. McCarthy referred to Smith and her fellow Senators as &quot;Snow White and the six dwarfs&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

On March 9, 1954, [[Vermont]] Republican Senator [[Ralph Flanders#The censure of Joseph McCarthy|Ralph E. Flanders]] gave a humor-laced speech on the Senate floor, questioning McCarthy's tactics in fighting communism, likening McCarthyism to &quot;housecleaning&quot; with &quot;much clatter and hullabaloo&quot;. He recommended that McCarthy turn his attention to the worldwide encroachment of Communism outside North America.&lt;ref&gt;

In a June 1 speech, Flanders compared McCarthy to [[Adolf Hitler]], accusing him of spreading &quot;division and confusion&quot; and saying, &quot;Were the Junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the Communists he could not have done a better job for them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

On June 11, Flanders introduced a resolution to have McCarthy removed as chair of his committees. Although there were many in the Senate who believed that some sort of disciplinary action against McCarthy was warranted, there was no clear majority supporting this resolution. Some of the resistance was due to concern about usurping the Senate's rules regarding committee chairs and seniority. Flanders next introduced a resolution to [[censure]] McCarthy. The resolution was initially written without any reference to particular actions or misdeeds on McCarthy's part. As Flanders put it, &quot;It was not his breaches of etiquette, or of rules or sometimes even of laws which is so disturbing,&quot; but rather his overall pattern of behavior. Ultimately a &quot;bill of particulars&quot; listing 46 charges was added to the censure resolution. A special committee, chaired by Senator [[Arthur Vivian Watkins]], was appointed to study and evaluate the resolution. This committee opened hearings on August 31.&lt;ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Vivian Watkins.jpg|thumb|left|Senator [[Arthur Vivian Watkins|Arthur V. Watkins]]]]
After two months of hearings and deliberations, the Watkins Committee recommended that McCarthy be censured on two of the 46 counts: his contempt of the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration, which had called him to testify in 1951 and 1952, and his abuse of General Zwicker in 1954. The Zwicker count was dropped by the full Senate on the grounds that McCarthy's conduct was arguably &quot;induced&quot; by Zwicker's own behavior. In place of this count, a new one was drafted regarding McCarthy's statements about the Watkins Committee itself.&lt;ref&gt;

The two counts on which the Senate ultimately voted were:
*That McCarthy had &quot;failed to cooperate with the Subcommittee on Rules and Administration&quot;, and &quot;repeatedly abused the members who were trying to carry out assigned duties&amp;nbsp;...&quot;
*That McCarthy had charged &quot;three members of the [Watkins] Select Committee with 'deliberate deception' and 'fraud'&amp;nbsp;... that the special Senate session&amp;nbsp;... was a 'lynch party{{'&quot;}}, and had characterized the committee &quot;as the 'unwitting handmaiden', 'involuntary agent' and 'attorneys in fact' of the Communist Party&quot;, and had &quot;acted contrary to senatorial ethics and tended to bring the Senate into dishonor and disrepute, to obstruct the constitutional processes of the Senate, and to impair its dignity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

The word &quot;censure&quot; was then removed from the title of the resolution, though it is generally regarded and referred to as a censure of McCarthy, both by historians&lt;ref&gt;

==Final years==
After his censure, McCarthy continued senatorial duties for another two and a half years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in the Senate avoided him; his speeches on the Senate floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.&lt;ref&gt;

The press that had once recorded his every public statement now ignored him, and outside speaking engagements dwindled almost to nothing. President Eisenhower, free of McCarthy's political intimidation, quipped to his Cabinet that McCarthyism was now &quot;McCarthywasm&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;

Still, McCarthy continued to rail against Communism. He warned against attendance at summit conferences with &quot;the Reds&quot;, saying that &quot;you cannot offer friendship to tyrants and murderers&amp;nbsp;... without advancing the cause of tyranny and murder.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

He declared that &quot;coexistence with Communists is neither possible nor honorable nor desirable. Our long-term objective must be the eradication of Communism from the face of the earth.&quot; In one of his final acts in the Senate, McCarthy opposed President Eisenhower's nomination to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] of [[William J. Brennan]], after reading a speech Brennan had given shortly beforehand in which he characterized McCarthy's anti-Communist investigations as &quot;witch hunts&quot;. McCarthy's opposition failed to gain any traction, however, and he was the only Senator to vote against Brennan's confirmation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Justice for All: William J.

McCarthy's biographers agree that he was a changed man after the censure; declining both physically and emotionally, he became a &quot;pale ghost of his former self&quot; in the words of Fred J. Cook.&lt;ref&gt;

It was reported that McCarthy suffered from [[cirrhosis|cirrhosis of the liver]] and was frequently hospitalized for [[alcoholism]].
Numerous eyewitnesses, including Senate aide [[George Reedy]] and journalist [[Tom Wicker]], have reported finding him alarmingly drunk in the Senate.
Journalist [[Richard Rovere]] (1959) wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;He had always been a heavy drinker, and there were times in those seasons of discontent when he drank more than ever. But he was not always drunk. He went on the wagon (for him this meant beer instead of whiskey) for days and weeks at a time. The difficulty toward the end was that he couldn't hold the stuff. He went to pieces on his second or third drink. And he did not snap back quickly.&lt;ref&gt;

There are those who observed McCarthy closelyâincluding such harsh critics as Jack Anderson and George Reedyâwho had a different version:  The McCarthy they knew early on was a drink-nurser, concerned to keep his wits about him and thus gain a competitive edge over others who were imbibing.  Although, he may have slid down that path after censure, there are those who knew him well at this period who also deny the image of chronic drunkard.&lt;ref&gt;Blacklisted By History by M.

===Death===
[[File:Tombstone of Joseph McCarthy from left.jpg|thumb|Tombstone of Joseph McCarthy with the [[Fox River (Wisconsin)|Fox River]] in the background]]
McCarthy died in [[National Naval Medical Center|Bethesda Naval Hospital]] on May 2, 1957, at the age of 48. The official cause of his death was listed as acute [[hepatitis]], an inflammation of the liver. It was hinted in the press that he died of alcoholism, an estimation that is accepted by contemporary biographers.&lt;ref name=causeofdeath/&gt; He was given a state funeral attended by 70 senators, and a [[Pontifical High Mass|Solemn Pontifical]] [[Requiem]] Mass was said before more than 100 priests and 2,000 others at [[Cathedral of St. Matthew the Apostle|St. Matthew's Cathedral]]. Thousands of people viewed the body in Washington. He was buried in [[St. Mary's Parish (Appleton, Wisconsin)|St. Mary's Parish]] Cemetery, [[Appleton, Wisconsin]], where more than 30,000 filed through St. Mary's Church to pay their last respects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apl.org/history/mccarthy/photos3.html Joseph McCarthy Photographs: The Funeral&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Three senatorsâ[[George W. Malone]], [[William E. Jenner]], and [[Herman Welker]]âhad flown from Washington to Appleton on the plane carrying McCarthy's casket. [[Robert F. Kennedy]] quietly attended the funeral in Wisconsin. McCarthy was survived by his wife, Jean, and their daughter, Tierney.

In the summer of 1957, a special election was held to fill McCarthy's seat.  In the [[primary election|primaries]], voters in both parties turned away from McCarthy's legacy. The Republican primary was won by [[Walter J. Kohler, Jr.]], who called for a clean break from McCarthy's approach; he defeated former Congressman [[Glenn Robert Davis]], who charged that Eisenhower was soft on Communism. The Democratic winner was [[William Proxmire]], who called the late McCarthy &quot;a disgrace to Wisconsin, to the Senate and to America&quot;. On August 27, Proxmire won the election.&lt;ref&gt;

==Ongoing debate==
{{Undue-section|date=April 2011}}
In the view of a few modern authors, McCarthy's place in history should be reevaluated. [[Ann Coulter]] devotes a chapter of ''[[Treason: Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism]]'' to a defense of McCarthy, and much of the book to a defense of McCarthyism. For example, she states:&lt;ref&gt;

These authors frequently cite new evidence, in the form of [[Venona project|Venona]] decrypted Soviet messages, Soviet espionage data now opened to the West, and newly released transcripts of closed hearings before McCarthy's subcommittee, asserting that these have vindicated McCarthy by showing that many of his identifications of Communists were correct. These and other authors have said that Venona and the Soviet archives have revealed that the scale of Soviet espionage activity in the United States during the 1940s and 1950s was larger than many scholars suspected,&lt;ref&gt;

and that this too is a vindication of McCarthy.

After reviewing evidence from Venona and other sources, historian [[John Earl Haynes]] concluded that, of 159 people identified on lists used or referenced by McCarthy, evidence was substantial that nine had aided Soviet espionage efforts. He suggested that a majority of those on the lists could legitimately have been considered security risks, but that a substantial minority could not.&lt;ref&gt;

[[William Bennett]], former [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan Administration]] [[U.S. Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]], opined in his 2007 book ''America: The Last Best Hope'':
{{quote|The cause of anti-communism, which united millions of Americans and which gained the support of Democrats, Republicans and independents, was undermined by Sen. Joe McCarthy&amp;nbsp;... McCarthy addressed a real problem: disloyal elements within the U.S. government. But his approach to this real problem was to cause untold grief to the country he claimed to love&amp;nbsp;... Worst of all, McCarthy besmirched the honorable cause of anti-communism. He discredited legitimate efforts to counter Soviet subversion of American institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thomma|first=Steven|title=Not satisfied with U.S. history, some conservatives rewrite it|publisher=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy Newspapers]]|date=April 1, 2010|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2010/04/01/91478/some-right-wingers-ignore-facts.html?storylink=MI_emailed|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==HUAC==
McCarthy's hearings are often incorrectly conflated with the hearings of the [[House Un-American Activities Committee|House Committee on Un-American Activities]] (HUAC). HUAC is best known for the investigation of [[Alger Hiss]] and for its investigation of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film industry]], which led to the [[Hollywood blacklist|blacklisting]] of hundreds of actors, writers, and directors. HUAC was a House committee, and as such had no formal connection with McCarthy, who served in the Senate.

==McCarthy in popular culture==
From the start of his notoriety, McCarthy was a favorite subject for political cartoonists. He was traditionally depicted in a negative light, normally pertaining to McCarthyism and his accusations. Herblock's cartoon that coined the term ''[[McCarthyism]]'' appeared less than two months after the senator's now famous February 1950 speech in Wheeling, West Virginia. In 1953, the popular daily comic strip ''[[Pogo (comics)|Pogo]]'' introduced the character [[Pogo (comics)#Simple J. Malarkey|Simple J. Malarkey]], a pugnacious and conniving [[wildcat]] with an unmistakable physical resemblance to McCarthy. (After worried newspaper editors protested to the syndicate that provided the strip, creator Walt Kelly henceforth depicted the Malarkey character with a bag of garbage over his head, concealing his features.)

As his fame grew, McCarthy increasingly became the target of ridicule and parody. He was impersonated by nightclub and radio [[Impressionist (entertainment)|impressionists]] and was satirized in ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine, on ''[[The Red Skelton Show]]'', and elsewhere. Several comedy songs lampooning the senator were released in 1954, including &quot;Point of Order&quot; by [[Stan Freberg]] and [[Daws Butler]], &quot;Senator McCarthy Blues&quot; by [[Hal Block]], and unionist folk singer [[Joe Glazer]]'s &quot;Joe McCarthy's Band&quot;, sung to the tune of &quot;[[McNamara's Band]]&quot;. Also in 1954, the radio comedy team [[Bob and Ray]] parodied McCarthy with the character &quot;Commissioner Carstairs&quot; in their soap opera spoof &quot;Mary Backstayge, Noble Wife&quot;. That same year, the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] radio network broadcast a satire, ''[[The Investigator]]'', whose title character was a clear imitation of McCarthy. A recording of the show became popular in the United States, and was reportedly played by President Eisenhower at cabinet meetings.&lt;ref&gt;

A more serious fictional portrayal of McCarthy played a central role in the 1959 novel ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' by [[Richard Condon]]. The character of Senator John Iselin, a [[demagogy|demagogic]] anti-communist, is closely modeled on McCarthy, even to the varying numbers of Communists he asserts are employed by the federal government. In the [[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|1962 film version]], the characterization remains; in this version, a [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]] ketchup bottle inspires Iselin and his wife to settle on &quot;57&quot; as the number of subversives he claims are on the federal payroll.

McCarthy was portrayed by [[Peter Boyle]] in the 1977 Emmy-winning television movie ''[[Tail Gunner Joe]]'', a dramatization of McCarthy's life. American band R.E.M. feature the song &quot;Exhuming McCarthy&quot; on their 1987 album ''[[Document (album)|Document]]''. Archival footage of McCarthy himself was used in the 2005 movie ''[[Good Night, and Good Luck]]'' about Edward R. Murrow and the ''See It Now'' episode that challenged McCarthy.&lt;!--Please don't add mention of the unsubstantiated (though widely reported) rumor that test audiences felt that the &quot;performer&quot; who &quot;played&quot; McCarthy was overacting in the absence of a well-documented and/or first-hand account of where and when such a reaction actually occurred.--&gt;
&lt;!--Please don't add a note about Arthur Miller's play &quot;The Crucible&quot; here. It's relevant to McCarthyism rather than Joseph McCarthy, and it is already mentioned in the McCarthyism article. --&gt;
