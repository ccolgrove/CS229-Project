The '''Italian election of 1979''' was held on [[June 3]]. The '''eighth''' Parliament of republican Italy was selected. This election was called just a week before the [[European Parliament election, 1979 (Italy)|European vote]]: the lack of matching between the two elections caused much controversy for wasting public money.

Terroristic attacks by the [[Red Brigades]] caused a result which was quite opposite than [[Italian general election, 1976|three years before]]: for the first time the [[Italian Communist Party]] lost a lot of votes, delaying that government change that was seeming imminent in 1976, and the Communist defeat gave a new strength to all the minor parties, a concentration of vote on the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]] seeming less urgent to stop the red progress. However, the catholic party remained stable, while neo-fascist [[Italian Social Movement]] was weakened by its spin-off [[National Democracy (Italy)|National Democracy]].

==Electoral system==
[[File:1979 Italian Senate election map.png|thumb|left|220px|Regional pluralities in Senate]]
The pure [[party-list proportional representation]] had traditionally become the electoral system for the Chamber of Deputies. [[Italian province]]s were united in 32 constituencies, each electing a group of candidates. At constituency level, seats were divided between [[open list]]s using the [[largest remainder method]] with [[Imperiali quota]]. Remaining votes and seats were transferred at national level, where they was divided using the [[Hare quota]], and automatically distributed to best losers into the local lists.

For the Senate, 237 single-seat constituencies were established, even if the assembly had risen to 315 members. The candidates needed a landslide victory of two thirds of votes to be elected, a goal which could be reached only by the German minorities in South Tirol. All remained votes and seats were grouped in party lists and regional constituencies, where a [[D'Hondt method]] was used: inside the lists, candidates with the best percentages were elected.

==Results==
Even this eighth legislature of the Italian Republic was a period of great instability. After the election, the Christian-Democratic leadership instructed moderate [[Francesco Cossiga]] to form a [[centrism|centrist]] minority government with the PSDI and the PLI, which accepted an official engagement into the government for the first time since 1973; however, when in 1980 [[Benigno Zaccagnini]] was fired as Secretary of the DC and socialist leader [[Bettino Craxi]] offered his help, Cossiga suddenly resigned and formed a new [[centre-left]] government with the PSI and the PRI, underling that the catholic leaders had no more problems to choose their allies from anywhere. However, Cossiga later fell on a budget project, and a traditional centre-left government led by [[Arnaldo Forlani]] was formed. The great scandal of the [[masonic lodge]] [[Propaganda Due|P2]] sank Forlani in 1981.

This deep political crisis marked the birth of a new political formula which ruled Italy during the 80's: the ''[[Pentapartito]]'' (''Pentaparty'', or ''five parties''), which was no more than the fusion of the two main alliances that DC had used to rule Italy since 1947, the ''centrism'' and the ''centre-left''. This formula became possible because [[Bettino Craxi]]'s [[Italian Socialist Party]] and [[Valerio Zanone]]'s [[Italian Liberal Party]] accepted to form their first republican government together, moderating their positions and passing the opposition that had always divided them. But the ''Pentaparty'' pact had another important condition: the DC accepted to recognize a pair role with the other four parties, alternating into the government leadership. The Secretary of the [[Italian Republican Party]], [[Giovanni Spadolini]], so became the first non-DC [[Prime Minister of Italy]] since 1945. However, his little party was unable to stop the quarrels between their great allies, and after a little crisis during summer 1982, Spadolini resigned in autumn of the same year. Former-PM [[Amintore Fanfani]] formed a new government without the offended republicans, but the PSI, which had good surveys, imposed the final crisis in 1983 and a new general election.
