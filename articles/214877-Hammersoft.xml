{{Politics of Minnesota}}

The '''Governor of Minnesota''' is the chief executive of the [[U.S. state]] of [[Minnesota]], leading the state's [[executive branch]].  Forty different people have been governors of the state, though historically there were also three governors of [[Minnesota Territory]].  [[Alexander Ramsey]], the first territorial governor, also served as state governor several years later.  State governors are elected to office by popular vote, but territorial governors were appointed to the office by the [[President of the United States|United States president]]. The current governor of Minnesota is [[Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|DFL'er]] [[Mark Dayton]].

==Powers and qualifications==
Like the [[President of the United States|U.S. President]], the governor has [[veto]] power over bills passed by the [[Minnesota State Legislature]].  As in most states, but unlike the U.S. President, the governor can also make [[line-item veto]]es, where specific provisions in bills can be stripped out while allowing the overall bill to be signed into law.

The minimum required age of a candidate for the Governor of Minnesota is 25 years (having been a Minnesota resident for one year before the election).

Since a 1958 amendment to the [[Minnesota Constitution]] governors are elected to four-year terms. Previously, they served two-year terms. There is no [[term limit]] for governor of the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = The Green Papers: Minnesota 2006 Midterm Election| publisher = Richard E.
