==Biography==
Henry's father is from [[Hong Kong]] and his mother from [[Pingtung]], [[Taiwan]]. Henry's areas of expertise lie in [[violin]], [[piano]], [[popping]], guitar playing and singing. Henry started to learn to play the piano from his mother at the age of 5, and also learned to play the violin at the age of 6. He also learned a unique form of dancing called boogaloo [[popping]] while in high school.  After only one year of dancing, Henry was competing in dance (popping) competitions and shows. Henry has gained many performance awards, such as the [[The Royal Conservatory of Music|Canadian Royal Conservatory of Music]] (RCM) Silver Medal for Level 10 Violin. Henry said he had planned to become a professional violinist, but never expected to become an idol star before being selected by [[S.M. Entertainment]] in 2006. and also said that he chose to join S.M. because if he turned to be a classical musician, he wouldn't be able to sing, dance, play the piano, and play the violin all together (Source:ilikeradio). 

He was born and raised in [[Willowdale]], Toronto where is one of the most affluent areas of the city of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located in the district of North York. He attended Steelesview Public School, [[Zion Heights Junior High School]], then [[North Toronto Collegiate Institute]] in grade 9, and attended [[A.Y. Jackson Secondary School (Toronto)]] for the rest of his high school years before being chosen at the 2006 [[S.M. Entertainment]] Global Audition in Toronto, Ontario. He briefly attended [[University of Toronto]] (Music Performance Major) in 2007. He also attended [[Berklee College of Music]] in Boston From May 2010 to August 2010.

His first appearance was in Super Junior's &quot;[[Don't Don (song)|Don't Don]]&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;ent.sina.com.cn&quot;&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://ent.sina.com.cn/y/2007-09-21/15171725620.shtml Sina.com - Super Junioråå½èå° ä¸ä¸­å½ç±æ°äººåå°(å¾)] Retrieved May 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; music video in September 2007. A few months later, Don't Don became a number one hit in Korea. In 2008, Henry was added to Super Junior-M&lt;ref&gt;{{zh icon}}[http://ent.jinghua.cn/c/200804/08/n921675.shtml/ Jinghua.cn - ç¬å®¶ï¼SuperJuniorMä»æ¥æ­£å¼åºé é©åºä»»éé¿] Retrieved May 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the group debuted in China on April 8, 2008, releasing their [[U (Super Junior song)|&quot;U&quot;]] remake music video and an album entitled [[Me (Super Junior-M album)|&quot;è¿· [Me]&quot;]] soon after that incorporated Henry's violin.

Henry returned to the music industry after a year-long break when [[Super Junior-M]] and their first mini-album: [[Super Girl (EP)]]  was released in China on September 25, 2009. In the mini-album, Henry does not display his violin playing. Henry did mixes and beats, such as for other members' (Donghae, Hangeng and Heechul) solo performances for their fan parties and Super Show 3 (Heechul) in 2009-2010.

In 2010, Henry composed a song called 'ì§ì¬(All My Heart)' for [[Super Junior]]'s 4th repackage album, with [[Leeteuk]]. And for [[Super Show 2]], he solely produced and wrote a song titled &quot;Sick Of Love&quot; which was written in English and hasn't been officially recorded yet. He was also featured in a [[Jonghyun]] and Jino R&amp;B duet &quot;Don't Lie&quot; by [[SM The Ballad]] in which he raps in the song.
Also, Henry rearranged [[Justin Bieber]]'s &quot;[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]&quot; and used the song to perform for the [[Super Show 3 Tour]].

In February 2011, Henry's new solo song called 'è¡¨ç½(BiÇobÃ¡i - Off My Mind)' was released.  The song is included in [[Super Junior-M]]'s second EP, '[[Perfection (EP)]]'. The song showcases Henry's talent in composing, arranging and producing as most of the work on the song was done solely by him.

In September 2011, Henry composed a song called 'ìë¨í(Andante)' for [[Super Junior]]'s 5th repackage album, with [[Leeteuk]].  

His fans are known as ç´å¼¦ (QÃ­n xiÃ¡n - Strings).
