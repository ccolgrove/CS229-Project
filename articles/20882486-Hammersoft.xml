The '''[[2009 NFL season|2009]] [[Washington Redskins]] season''' is the 77th season for the team in the [[National Football League]]. They failed to improve upon their 8â8 record from [[2008 Washington Redskins season|2008]], which resulted in Jim Zorn being fired after two seasons.

===Movement===
The Redskins released [[linebacker]] [[Marcus Washington]] on February 20, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redskins.com/gen/articles/Redskins_Release_Washington_32222.jsp |title=Redskins Release Washington |publisher=Redskins.com |date=February 20, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 27, the first day of 2009 free agency, the Redskins made four personnel moves.  Five hours into the new free agency period, the team signed a seven-year, $100 million contract with [[unrestricted free agent]] [[Albert Haynesworth]].  The deal included $41 million guaranteed and could reach $115 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3939011 |title=Albert Haynesworth, Washington Redskins agree on seven-year deal |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |first=John |last=Clayton|date=January 1, 2008 |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Haynesworth spent the first seven seasons of his career playing [[defensive tackle]] for the [[Tennessee Titans]]; the Titans asked the NFL to look into claims that Redskins management [[tampering (sport)|tampered]] with Haynesworth by beginning negotiations with him before the start of the free agent period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090402/SPORTS01/904020373/1027|title=Titans claim Redskins tampered| publisher=The Tennessean|date=2009-04-02| accessdate=2009-04-09|last=Wyatt|first=Jim}}{{Dead link|date=August 2009|bot=WebCiteBOT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Redskins also released [[cornerback]] [[Shawn Springs]];&lt;ref name=ESPN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/teams/transactions?team=was|title=Washington Redskins Transactions â NFL Football â ESPN| publisher=sports.espn.go.com|accessdate=2009-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; agreed to terms with former [[Buffalo Bills|Buffalo]] guard (and previous Redskin) [[Derrick Dockery]] on a five-year, $26 million contract with $8.2 million in guaranteed money;&lt;ref name=dockery&gt;{{cite web | work=NationalPost.com | url=http://nationalpost.pa-sportsticker.com/default.aspx?s=nfl-news-display&amp;nid=A216501235844165A | title=Redskins agree to terms with OG Dockery | accessdate=March 1, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and agreed with unrestricted free agent [[DeAngelo Hall]] on a new six-year, $54 million contract.

On March 2, 2009, the Redskins released defensive end [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] after he refused to add a clause to his contract that would have required him to participate in the team's off-season workout program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.redskins.com/gen/articles/Redskins_Release_Taylor_32597.jsp |title=Redskins Release Taylor |publisher=Redskins.com |date=March 2, 2009 |accessdate=March 2, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of Taylor's release the Redskins re-signed defensive end [[Phillip Daniels]], who had started at left end before a 2008 [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|ACL tear]] on the first day of [[training camp (National Football League)|training camp]] led to Taylor's acquisition, and brought back [[Renaldo Wynn]], who had played defensive end for the Redskins between 2002 and 2006.

In late March and early April 2009, Redskins officials attempted to include starting [[quarterback]] [[Jason Campbell]] in a trade to acquire [[Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]; they also attempted to trade Campbell to at least one other team for a second-round pick in the [[2009 NFL Draft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/02/AR2009040204148.html|title=After Failed Bid to Acquire Jay Cutler, Redskins Move to Reassure Jason Campbell|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-04-08|date=2009-04-03|coauthors=Jason Reid|last=La Canfora|first=Jason|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5j6aGDlJ8|archivedate=2009-08-17|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After Cutler was traded to the [[Chicago Bears]] on April 2, Redskins [[head coach]] [[Jim Zorn]] publicly re-asserted his commitment to Campbell.

On Dec. 16 the team announced the selection of Bruce Allen as Executive Vice President of Operations and General Manager, replacing Vinny Cerrato.  Allen is the son of former Redskins head coach (1971â77) George Allen and brother of former Virginia Governor and U.S. Senator George Allen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/12/17/AR2009121704384.html|title=After Redskins name Bruce Allen, son of their former coach, their new executive vice president/general manager|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=2009-12-18|author=Rick Maese | date=December 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
