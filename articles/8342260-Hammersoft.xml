Colonel '''Oleg Ivanovich Pantyukhov''' ({{lang-ru|ÐÐ»ÐµÐ³ ÐÐ²Ð°Ð½Ð¾Ð²Ð¸Ñ ÐÐ°Ð½ÑÑÑÐ¾Ð²}}; 25 March 1882&lt;ref name=Pravoveriye&gt;[http://parus.pravoverie.ru/Pantuhin.doc Biography of Pantuhin on side pravoverie.ru] {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; â 1973&lt;ref name=Uch&gt;[http://www.ug.ru/02.30/t20.htm Oleg Pantyukhov ''U Lukomorya''] publication in Uchitel'skaya Gazeta with preface of Vsevolod Kuchin {{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was the founder of [[Russian Association of Scouts/Navigators|Russian Scouting]].

==Early years==

Oleg Pantyukhov was born in [[Kiev]] to a family of a military physician and an anthropologist. From 1892 to 1899 he studied at [[Tifflis]] [[Cadet Corps (Russia)|cadet school]]. During his studies he became a member of the group named ''[[Alexander Pushkin|Pushkin]] club''. The group was somehow similar to the modern [[Boy Scout]]s, e.g. every weekend they were having a [[hiking]] trip with [[camping]] in the mountains.&lt;ref name=Pravoveriye/&gt;

From 1899 to 1901, Pantyukhov studied in Pavlovsk Military School. After graduation he became an officer of the [[Leib Guard]] 1st infantry battalion stationed in [[Tsarskoye Selo]]. In 1908 he married Nina Mikhaylovna Dobrovolskaya, who later became one of pioneers of the [[Girl Guides|Guiding]] movement in Russia.&lt;ref name=Pravoveriye/&gt;
In 1910 their son Oleg Olegovich Pantyukhov, who served during World War II as [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|General EisenhowerÂ´s]] official Russian interpreter, was born in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]].&lt;ref name=&quot;K102&quot;/&gt;

==Formation of Russian Scouting==

In 1908â09 Pantyukhov became acquainted with the works of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden-Powell]] and decided to try these ideas on Russian soil. He organized the first Russian Scout troop ''Beaver'' ({{lang|ru|ÐÐ¾Ð±Ñ}}, ''Bobr'') in [[Pavlovsk, Saint Petersburg|Pavlovsk]], a town near [[Tsarskoye Selo]], on 30 April 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On the return he wrote the first Russian Scouting books &quot;ÐÐ°Ð¼ÑÑÐºÐ° Ð®Ð½Ð¾Ð³Ð¾ Ð Ð°Ð·Ð²ÐµÐ´ÑÐ¸ÐºÐ°&quot; (Handbook of a Young Scout) and &quot;Ð Ð³Ð¾ÑÑÑÑ Ñ ÐÐ¾Ð¹-ÑÐºÐ°ÑÑÐ¾Ð²&quot; (Visiting Boy Scouts) (both 1912). In 1913 he wrote a book named &quot;Ð¡Ð¿ÑÑÐ½Ð¸Ðº ÐÐ¾Ð¹ÑÐºÐ°ÑÑÐ°&quot; (a companion of boy scout). Pantyukhov met [[Nicholas II of Russia|Nicholas II]] and gifted a Scouting badge for [[Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich of Russia|Tsarevich Alexei]], who formally became a Scout.&lt;ref name=Pravoveriye/&gt;

In 1914, Pantyukhov established a society called ''Russian Scout'' ({{lang|ru|Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¡ÐºÐ°ÑÑ}}, ''Russkiy Skaut''). The first Russian Scout campfire was lit in the woods of Pavlovsk Park. A Russian Scout song exists to remember this event. [[Scouting]] spread rapidly across Russia and into [[Siberia]], and by 1916 there were about 50,000 Scouts in Russia.

During [[World War I]] Pantyukhov received a [[Cross of St. George]], was treated in [[Crimea]] and became the commander of the &quot;Third [[Moscow]] School of [[Praporshchik]]s&quot;. During the [[October Revolution]] he was the leader of the cadets who unsuccessfully defended the [[Kremlin]] from [[Bolshevik]]s.&lt;ref name=Uch/&gt; In 1919 in [[Novocherkassk]] (controlled at the time by the [[White Army]]), Pantyukhov was unanimously elected the Chief Scout of Russia.&lt;ref name=Pravoveriye/&gt;

==Disbandment and banning of Russian Scouting==
With the advent of [[communism]] after the [[October Revolution]] of 1917, and during the [[Russian Civil War]] from 1918 to 1920, most of the Scoutmasters and many Scouts fought in the ranks of the [[White movement|White Army]] and interventionists against the [[Red Army]]. In [[Soviet]] Russia the Scouting system started to be replaced by [[Scouting#Breakaway and nonaligned organisations|ideologically-altered Scoutlike organizations]], such as {{lang|ru|&quot;Ð®Ð&quot;}} ({{lang|ru|&quot;Ð®Ð½ÑÐµ ÐÐ¾Ð¼Ð¼ÑÐ½Ð¸ÑÑÑ&quot;}}, or ''young communists''; pronounced as ''yuk''), that were created since 1918. There was a purge of the Scout leaders, many of whom perished under the Bolsheviks. Those Scouts who did not wish to accept the new Soviet system either left Russia for good, like Pantyukhov and others, or went underground. However, [[Clandestine operation|clandestine]] Scouting did not last long. On May 19, 1922, all of those newly created organizations were united into the [[Young Pioneer organization of the Soviet Union]] (it existed until 1990). Since that year, Scouting in the [[Soviet Union]] was banned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Russian Scouting in exile==
{{Main|Scouts-in-Exile}}
The organization '''Ð ÑÑÑÐºÐ¸Ð¹ Ð¡ÐºÐ°ÑÑ''' then went into exile, and continued in many countries where fleeing [[White Emigre|White Russian Ã©migrÃ©s]] settled, establishing groups in [[France]], [[Serbia]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], and [[Paraguay]]. A much larger mass of Russian Scouts moved through [[Vladivostok]] to the east into [[Manchuria]] and south into [[China]].

Pantyukhov, his wife Nina and their son Oleg Jr. went to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Kroonenberg 83&quot;&gt;{{cite book

There were a Russian Scout Bureau in Constantinople and Russian Scout groups were founded in Turkey.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kroonenberg 83&quot;/&gt;
On March 22, 1921 a General Russian [[Scout Leader|Scoutleaders]] congress took place in Constantinople under the leadership of Pantyukhov.&lt;ref name= &quot;K84&quot;&gt;{{cite book

As [[Chief Scout]] of this association, which later changed its name to [[National Organization of Russian Scouts (Scouts-in-Exile)|National Organization of Russian Scouts]], served the Founder of Russian Scouting Pantyukhov.
His wife Nina and later his son Oleg Jr. were also heavily involved in Russian Scouting in Exile.&lt;ref name=&quot;K102&quot;/&gt; Oleg Pantyukhov Sr. and Nina were personal friends of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Robert Baden-Powell]] and [[Olave Baden-Powell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;K102&quot;/&gt;

In 1922 Pantyukhov and his family to moved to the [[United States]]&lt;ref name=&quot;K102&quot;/&gt;,, where large troops of Russian Scouts were established in such [[California]] cities as [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]], [[Burlingame, California|Burlingame]], [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], etc. Pantyukhov is credited with creation of the first Russian Scout group abroad on March 25, 1920. He worked for the Scouting movement up to his death.&lt;ref name=Pravoveriye/&gt;

He took part in the [[3rd World Scout Jamboree]] in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Oleg Pantyukhov was appointed to the Chief Scout of the [[Organization of Russian Young Pathfinders (Scouts-in-Exile)|Organization of Russian Young Pathfinders]] in November,1945 and so he was at this time the Chief Scout of both Russian Scouts-in-exile associations. He tried to unite the associations, but it failed and so he resigned as Chief Scout from ORYuR in 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
