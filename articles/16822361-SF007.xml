'''Google App Engine''' (often referred to as '''GAE''' or simply '''App Engine''', and also used by the acronym '''GAE/J''') is a [[platform as a service]] (PaaS) [[cloud computing]] platform for developing and hosting [[web application]]s in Google-managed data centers. It virtualizes applications across multiple servers.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/runtime.html&lt;/ref&gt; App Engine offers automatic scaling for web applicationsâas the number of requests increases for an application, App Engine automatically allocates more resources for the web application to handle the additional demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sanderson |first=Dan |title=Programming Google App Engine: Build and Run Scalable Web Apps on Google's Infrastructure |publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-0596522728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Google App Engine is free up to a certain level of consumed resources. Fees are charged for additional storage, bandwidth, or CPU cycles required by the application.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was first released as a [[beta software|beta]] version in April 2008, and came out of beta in September 2011.

==Supported features/restrictions==
Currently, the supported [[programming language]]s are [[Python (programming language)|Python]], [[Java (software platform)|Java]], and [[Go (programming language)|Go]] (and, by extension, other [[JVM languages]] such as [[Groovy (programming language)|Groovy]], [[JRuby]], [[Scala (programming language)|Scala]], [[Clojure]], [[Jython]] and [[PHP]] via a special version of [[Quercus (software)|Quercus]]) [http://code.google.com/appengine/casestudies.html#caucho].  Python web frameworks that run on Google App Engine include [http://www.gaeframework.com GAE framework], [[Django_(Web_framework)|Django]], [[CherryPy]], [[Pylons (web framework)|Pylons]], [[Flask (programming)|Flask]], [[web2py]] and [http://webapp-improved.appspot.com/ webapp2], as well as a custom Google-written webapp framework and several others designed specifically for the platform that emerged since the release.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/tipfy/wiki/AppEngineFrameworks&lt;/ref&gt; Google has said that it plans to support more languages in the future, and that the Google App Engine has been written to be language independent.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} Any Python framework that supports the [[Web Server Gateway Interface|WSGI]] using the CGI adapter can be used to create an application; the framework can be uploaded with the developed application. Third-party libraries written in pure Python may also be uploaded.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/whatisgoogleappengine.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/webapp/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bulk downloading===
SDK version 1.2.2 adds support for bulk downloads of data using Python.&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/tools/uploadingdata.html#Downloading_Data_from_App_Engine&lt;/ref&gt; The open source Python projects gaebar, &lt;ref&gt;http://github.com/aral/gaebar/tree/master&lt;/ref&gt; approcket,&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/approcket/&lt;/ref&gt; and gawsh&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/p/gawsh/&lt;/ref&gt; also allow users to download and backup App Engine data. No method for bulk downloading data from GAE using Java currently exists.

===Restrictions===
*Developers have read-only access to the filesystem on App Engine. Applications can use only virtual filesystems, like [http://code.google.com/p/gae-filestore/ gae-filestore].
*App Engine can only execute code called from an HTTP request (scheduled background tasks allow for self calling HTTP requests).
*Users may upload arbitrary Python modules, but only if they are pure-Python; [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pyrex (programming language)|Pyrex]] modules are not supported.
*Java applications may only use a subset ([http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/jrewhitelist.html The JRE Class White List]) of the classes from the JRE standard edition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/java/jrewhitelist.html The JRE Class White List]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Java applications cannot create new threads.
*Does not support 'naked' domains (without www) like http://example.com. The required alias to ghs.google.com is implemented with a DNS [[CNAME record]] in order for changes in Google server IP addresses not to impact the service. This record cannot be used with other DNS records (RFC 1034 section 3.6.2, RFC 1912 section 2.4), including the required [[List of DNS record types#SOA|Start of Authority]] for the example.com [[DNS zone]]. Suggested workaround is to use the domain registrar HTTP redirection to a subdomain, e.g. &quot;www.example.com&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=777 Officially Support Naked Domains for GAE Apps]&lt;/ref&gt;
*SSL/HTTPS is only available via *.appspot.com domains and not via Google Apps Domains.&lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/p/googleappengine/issues/detail?id=792 Issue 792]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Datastore cannot use inequality filters on more than one entity property per query.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aleatory.clientsideweb.net/2009/11/28/google-app-engine-datastore-gotchas/ Google App Engine Datastore Gotchas]&lt;/ref&gt;
*A process started on the server to answer a request can't last more than 30 seconds. (with the 1.4.0 release, this restriction does not apply to background jobs anymore)
*Does not support sticky sessions (a.k.a. session affinity), only replicated sessions are supported including limitation of the amount of data being serialized and time for session serialization.

==Major differences==
===Differences with other application hosting===

Compared to other scalable hosting services such as [[Amazon EC2]], App Engine provides more infrastructure to make it easy to write scalable applications, but can ''only'' run a limited range of applications designed for that infrastructure.

App Engine's infrastructure removes many of the system administration and development challenges of building applications to scale to hundreds of requests per second and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/runtime.html#Quotas_and_Limits | title = Python Runtime Environment - Google App Engine | accessdate = 2009-11-10| date = 2009-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Google handles deploying code to a cluster, monitoring, failover, and launching application instances as necessary.

While other services let users install and configure nearly any *NIX compatible software, App Engine requires developers to use only its [[Google App Engine#Supported programming languages and frameworks|supported languages, APIs, and frameworks]]. Current APIs allow storing and retrieving data from a [[BigTable]] non-relational database; making HTTP requests; sending e-mail; manipulating images; and caching. Existing web applications that require a relational database will not run on App Engine without modification.

Per-day and per-minute quotas restrict bandwidth and CPU use, number of requests served, number of concurrent requests, and calls to the various APIs, and individual requests are terminated if they take more than 60 seconds or return more than 32MB of data.

===Differences between SQL and GQL===

Google App Engine's datastore has a SQL-like syntax called &quot;GQL&quot;. GQL intentionally does not support the [[Join (SQL)|Join]] statement, because it seems to be inefficient when queries span more than one machine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oG6Ac7d-Nx8 Introducing Google App Engine part 3]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, one-to-many and many-to-many relationships can be accomplished using ReferenceProperty().&lt;ref&gt;http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/modeling.html&lt;/ref&gt;  This shared-nothing approach allows disks to fail without the system failing.&lt;ref&gt;http://highscalability.com/google-architecture&lt;/ref&gt; Switching from a relational database to the Datastore requires a paradigm shift for developers when modelling their data.

Unlike a [[relational database]] the Datastore API is not relational in the SQL sense.

The Java version supports asynchronous non-blocking queries using the [http://code.google.com/p/twig-persist/ Twig Object Datastore] interface.  This offers an alternative to using threads for parallel data processing.

==Portability concerns==
Developers worry that the applications will not be portable from App Engine and fear being locked into the technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/04/analysis-google-app-engine-alluring-will-be-hard-to-escape.ars&lt;/ref&gt; In response, there are a number of projects to create open-source back-ends for the various proprietary/closed APIs of app engine, especially the datastore. Although these projects are at various levels of maturity, none of them is at the point where installing and running an App Engine app is as simple as it is on Google's service.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.notdot.net/2009/04/Announcing-BDBDatastore-a-replacement-datastore-for-App-Engine A blog post that lists such efforts as it announces another one.]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[ AppScale ]] is one of the open source efforts.

[[Web2py]] web framework offers migration between SQL Databases and Google App Engine, however it doesn't support several App Engine-specific features such as transactions and namespaces.&lt;ref&gt;http://web2py.com/book/default/section/11/13&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Django (web framework)|Django web framework]] and applications running on it can be used on App Engine with modification. [http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/django-nonrel Django-nonrel] aims to allow Django to work with non-relation databases and the project includes support for App Engine.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.allbuttonspressed.com/projects/djangoappengine&lt;/ref&gt;

Applications developed for the [[Grails (framework)|Grails web application framework]] may be modified and deployed to Google App Engine with very little effort using the [http://grails.org/plugin/app-engine App Engine Plugin].

The GAE [[Java Servlet|Java servlet]] container uses the [[Jetty (web server)|Jetty Web Server]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.infoq.com/news/2009/08/google-chose-jetty&lt;/ref&gt; an open source project that implements the 2.5 servlet specification.

[[AppScale]] can run Python, Java, and Go GAE applications on EC2 and other cloud vendors.

[[Spring Roo]] also offers a cross-platform ability to develop.

==Backends==
In [[Google I/O]] 2011, Google announced ''App Engine Backends'', which are allowed to run continuously, and consume more memory. &lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=-kepYfCBg6w||title=Google I/O 2011: App Engine Backends}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;[http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/python/backends/overview.html Backends Python API Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike normal App Engine instances, backends are billed for uptime rather than CPU usage.

==Google Cloud SQL==
In Oct 2011, Google previews a zero maintenance SQL database, which supports JDBC and DB-API. &lt;ref&gt;[http://googlecode.blogspot.com/2011/10/google-cloud-sql-your-database-in-cloud.html Google Cloud SQL: your database in the cloud]&lt;/ref&gt;. This service allows you to create, configure, and use relational databases with App Engine applications. Database engine is MySql Version 5.1.59 and database size must be no larger than 10GB&lt;ref&gt;[http://cnapagoda.blogspot.com/2011/10/sample-application-with-google-cloud.html Google Cloud SQL: Sample Application]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Usage quotas==
Google App Engine requires a Google account to get started, and an account may allow the developer to register up to 10 applications. This limit can be increased by Google staff.

Google App Engine defines usage quotas for free applications. Extensions to these quotas can be requested, and application authors can pay for additional resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Quotas&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/quotas.html | title = Understanding Application Quotas with Google App Engine | accessdate = 2010-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Below are limit and quotas defined per application:

===Free quotas===
Application creators who enable billing pay only for CPU, bandwidth, storage, and e-mails used in excess of the free quotas.  Limits marked with * are increased for application authors who enable billing, even if their application never uses enough resources to incur charges. Free quotas were reduced on May 25, 2009&lt;ref&gt;Google, Inc., [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html#Free_Changes Upcoming Changes to the Free Quotas], accessed February 26, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;, reduced again on June 22, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Google, Inc., [http://code.google.com/appengine/docs/quotas.html#Free_Changes], accessed June 17, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; but then revised in May 2011 to allow for more infrastructure and pricing changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googleappengine.blogspot.com/2011/05/year-ahead-for-google-app-engine.html|title=Google App Engine Blog: The Year Ahead for Google App Engine!|work=Google App Engine blog|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.google.com/enterprise/appengine/appengine_pricing.html|title=Google App Engine - Pricing and Features|work=[[Google]]|accessdate=11 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competition==

The service competes with [[Amazon Web Services]], a set of application services that enable web sites to host files and execute code on Amazon's servers.

Other competitors include Microsoft's [[Azure Services Platform]], Salesforce.com's [[Force.com]] Platform, Sina.com's [[Sina App Engine]] (Chinese) and [[Heroku]].

[[AppScale]] is an open-source framework for running Google App Engine applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://appscale.cs.ucsb.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
