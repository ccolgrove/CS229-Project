==Early life==
Born in [[Providence, Rhode Island]], Liebrich was the second girl of four children into the family of George and Lillian (Leicht) Liebrich. As a child, she grew up in a baseball household as his father was a semi-professional [[pitcher]] for many years, although she began playing [[softball]] with the [[Hudson Motor Car Company]] team after high school graduation in 1940, appearing in national tournaments in [[Detroit]] in 1941 and 1943.&lt;ref name=OBIT&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tangled.roots.angelfire.com/fl-a-m.htm  |title= Tangled Roots, March 30, 2007 â Florida Obituaries Extractions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia of Women and Baseball'' â Leslie A. Heaphy, Mel Anthony May. Publisher: McFarland &amp; Company, 2006. Format: Paperback, 438pp. Language: English.

Format: Paperback, 295 pp. Language: English. ISBN 0786437472&lt;/ref&gt;

==AAGPBL career==
A late bloomer, Liebrich did not start playing professionally until she joined the AAGPBL as a rookie 25-year-old in 1948. She spent the year with the [[Rockford Peaches]] and the [[Kenosha Comets]], but did not get much playing time, batting a .250 average in three games as a replacement at [[second base]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseballhistorian.com/html/american_heroes.cfm?page=171 Baseball Historian â American Heroes]&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebrich became a chaperone for the expansion [[Springfield Sallies]] in 1948. The team, managed by [[Carson Bigbee]], finished in last place with a 41-84 record, 35 and a half games behind the [[Racine Belles]] in the Western Division. In 1949, the Sallies joined the [[Chicago Colleens]] as touring player development teams, while Leibrich replaced Bigbee as the team's manager.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL-History&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aagpbl.org/league/history.cfm |title= All-American Girls Professional Baseball League History}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

From 1951 through 1954 Liebrich worked as a chaperone for the [[Kalamazoo Lassies]]. In 1954, she was selected chaperone for the All-Star team and also was a member of the champion Lassies, managed by [[Mitch Skupien]], during what turned out to be the league's final season.&lt;ref name=AAGPBL-History/&gt;
