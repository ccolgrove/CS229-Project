The '''Championnat de France de Football FÃ©minin''', primarily referred to as the '''Division 1 FÃ©minine''', is the French semi-professional [[Association football|football]] league for association [[women's association football|women's football]] clubs in France. It is the country's primary female football competition and serves as the top division of the women's French football league system. The league is the female equivalent to the men's [[Ligue 1]] and is contested by 12 clubs. Seasons run from September to June, with teams playing 22 games each totaling 132 games in the season. Most games are played on Saturdays and Sundays, with a few games played during weekday evenings. Play is regularly suspended after the second week in December before returning in the third week of January. The Division 1 FÃ©minine is one of the top women's domestic leagues in Europe currently ranked third behind Germany's [[FuÃball-Bundesliga (women)|FuÃball-Bundesliga]] and Sweden's [[Damallsvenskan]].&lt;ref name=&quot;List of Players&quot;&gt;{{cite web

== History ==

The Division 1 FÃ©minine was originally created in 1918 and was managed by the ''FÃ©dÃ©ration des SociÃ©tÃ©s FÃ©minines Sportives de France'' (FSFSF), a women's football organization in France that was led by women's football pioneer [[Alice Milliat]]. The league lasted for twelve seasons before disbanding following the prohibition of women's football. In 1975, women's football was officially re-instated and the Division 1 FÃ©minine returned with funding from the [[French Football Federation]]. Beginning with the [[2009â10 Division 1 FÃ©minine|2009â10 season]], female football players in France began signing professional contracts with their clubs, most notably [[Olympique Lyonnais (Ladies)|Olympique Lyonnais]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Statut pro pour ces dames |url=http://www.lequipe.fr/Football/breves2009/20090306_081943_statut-pro-pour-ces-dames.html |work=L'Equipe |publisher=L'Equipe|date=6 March 2009|accessdate=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Foot fÃ©minin, la lueur d'un statut professionnel|url=http://footamat.fr/foot-feminin-statut-professionnel_2001.html |work=FootAmat |publisher=FootAmat |date=14 March 2009|accessdate=16 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contracts were previously [[semi-professional]]. The [[2009â10 Division 1 FÃ©minine|defending champions]] are [[Olympique Lyonnais (Ladies)|Olympique Lyonnais]] who won the league this season by one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Lyon pip Juvisy to French title |url=http://www.uefa.com/womenschampionsleague/news/newsid=1497798.html |work=UEFA |publisher=UEFA |date=14 June 2010|accessdate=15 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition format ==

There are 12 clubs in the Division 1 FÃ©minine. During the course of a season, usually from September to June, each club plays the others twice, once at their home stadium and once at that of their opponents, for a total of 22 games, though clubs are allowed to host &quot;big&quot; matches at the home venues of their male counterparts, such as when [[Paris Saint-Germain F.C.|Paris Saint-Germain]] hosted [[FCF Juvisy|Juvisy]] at the [[Parc des Princes]] during the [[2009â10 Division 1 FÃ©minine|2009â10 season]]. The female leagues are ran similarly to the men's amateur leagues in France with teams receiving four points for a win and two points for a draw. One point is awarded for a loss. Teams are ranked by total points, then [[goal difference]], and then goals scored. At the end of each season, the club with the most points is crowned champion. If points are equal, the goal difference and then goals scored determine the winner. If still equal, teams are deemed to occupy the same position. If there is a tie for the championship, for relegation, or for qualification to other competitions, a play-off match at a neutral venue decides rank. The two lowest placed teams are relegated to the Division 2 FÃ©minine and the winners of the two groups in D2 FÃ©minine are promoted in their place.

Between the years 2001â2004, the league adopted a playoff system. The top four clubs in the league table were inserted into a playoff table following the completion of the season with the winner being crowned champions. From 1974â1992, the league consisted of several groups with the winners of each group entering a playoff phase to determine the champion.

===European qualification===

Currently, as determined by the [[UEFA coefficient|UEFA women's coefficient]], the top two teams in the Division 1 FÃ©minine qualify for the [[UEFA Women's Champions League]], with the champions of the league proceeding directly to the main round. The second-placed team enters in the qualifying round. As of today, the winner of the [[Challenge de France]], the female equivalent of the [[Coupe de France]], does not qualify for European competition.
