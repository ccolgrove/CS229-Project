'''Clendon''' is a suburb of [[Auckland]] city in northern [[New Zealand]]. It is located to the west of [[Manurewa]]. The suburb is in the Manurewa-Papakura ward, one of the thirteen administrative divisions of Auckland City.

Clendon is named after Captain [[James Reddy Clendon]] who in 1840 traded land he owned in the [[Bay of Islands]] with the newly formed New Zealand Government for 10,000 acres (40&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of land, then south of [[Auckland CBD]].

Clendon has a young, diverse and rapidly growing population. As of the 2001 census, 35.6% of Clendon's population is made up of people under the age of 15, compared to the New Zealand average of 22.7%. The population is made up largely of Pacific peoples and [[MÄori people|MÄori]], with the remaining approximately 30% of people stating a connection to either European, NZ [[PÄkehÄ]], Asian or 'other'. The rate of unemployment in the Clendon community is 19.6%, compared to the New Zealand average of 7.5%.
