'''Funny or Die''' is a comedy video website founded by [[Will Ferrell]] and [[Adam McKay]]'s production company, [[Gary Sanchez Productions]] with original and user-generated content. Funny or Die contains exclusive material from a number of famous contributors (e.g. [[Judd Apatow]], [[James Franco]]) and also has its own Funny or Die Team, which creates original material for the site. Many clips on the site feature well-known actors (examples include [[Charlie Sheen]], [[Patrick Stewart]], [[Daniel Radcliffe]], [[Lindsay Lohan]] and [[Jerry Seinfeld]]).
Michael Kvamme, an aspiring young comedian, came up with a concept for a new kind of comedy site and the site was developed by [[Randy Adams]]. Videos are voted on by users of the site; those that are deemed funny stay, but those that are not &quot;die&quot; and are relegated to the site's &quot;crypt&quot;.
The title is a reference to the well known political cartoon, [[Join, or Die]].

The site's first video, &quot;[[The Landlord (film)|The Landlord]],&quot; has received over 70 million views and features Ferrell confronted by a swearing, beer-drinking two-year-old landlord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.com/videos/74 |title=The Landlord video page |publisher=Funnyordie.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2007, they received venture capital funding from [[Sequoia Capital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sequoiacap.com/company/funny-or-die/|title=Sequoia Capital funds Funny or Die}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in June 2008, they announced a partnership with [[HBO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117987248.html?categoryid=14&amp;cs=1|title=HBO Joining Forces with FunnyorDie | work=Variety | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton | date=2008-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Voting System ==
Unlike other viral video sites, members of Funny or Die are encouraged to vote on videos which they view, with the options of &quot;Funny&quot; or &quot;Die&quot;. The video then gets a score of the total percent of people who voted the video &quot;Funny&quot;. If the video receives an 80% or greater &quot;Funny&quot; rating after 100,000 views, it gets an &quot;Immortal&quot; ranking. If the video receives a 20% or less &quot;Funny&quot; rating after 1,000 views, it is relegated to the Crypt section of the site. 

The Funny or Die staff can also select a rating of &quot;Chosen One&quot;, which hides the score from the public, merely saying &quot;Chosen One&quot; instead.

==Funny or Die Comedy Tour==
In February 2008, Funny or Die launched &quot;Will Ferrellâs Funny or Die Comedy Tour Presented by âSemi-Proâ&quot;, in conjunction with the promotion of the movie [[Semi Pro]]. The tour featured Ferrell, members of the FOD Team and comedians [[Zach Galifianakis]], [[Demetri Martin]], [[Nick Swardson]] and [[Andrea Savage]]. Adam McKay and [[Will Arnett]] served as tour announcers. The eight-city tour hit college campuses in Kansas, Michigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, North Carolina and New York.

==Funny or Die Presents==
{{Main|Funny or Die Presents}}
In June 2008, HBO and Funny or Die announced that HBO had purchased a stake of less than 10% in Funny Or Die. With this, Funny or Die will be responsible for developing at least 10 half-hour episodes for HBO, and the companies may organize future comedy tours together. Regarding the agreement, Will Ferrell said, &quot;I don't want to overstate the importance of this deal, but this is the missing link moment where TV and Internet finally merge. It will change the way we as human beings perceive and interact with reality. Okay, I overstated it. But it is an exciting deal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9965649-7.html|title=HBO invests in Will Ferrell's Funnyordie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, FunnyorDie hired Andrew Steele, a twelve year veteran of [[Saturday Night Live]], and one of three head writers in recent years, to oversee content production and development for the site and for the HBO partnership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1117990102.html?categoryid=1238&amp;cs=1|title=Funny or Die made of Steele | work=Variety | first=Cynthia | last=Littleton | date=2008-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
