'''SpywareBlaster''' is a [[killbit]] program for [[Microsoft Windows]] designed to block the installation of [[ActiveX]] [[malware]].

==Features==
SpywareBlaster blocks the installation of most ActiveX-based [[spyware]], [[adware]], [[browser hijacker]]s, [[dialer]]s and other unwanted programs from the user's computer. SpywareBlaster works by blacklisting the [[CLSID]] of known malware programs, effectively preventing them from infecting a protected computer. This approach differs from many other anti-spyware programs, which typically offer the user a possibility to &quot;scan&quot; the memory and hard drive of the computer and remove the unwanted software, after it has been installed.

SpywareBlaster also allows the user to prevent privacy hazards such as tracking cookies. Another feature is the ability to restrict the actions of websites known to distribute adware and spyware.
SpywareBlaster supports several [[web browser]]s, including [[Internet Explorer]], [[Netscape Navigator|Netscape]], [[Mozilla]] and [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Mozilla Seamonkey]], and [[Flock (web browser)|Flock]].

==License==
SpywareBlaster is currently released as [[freeware]], for personal and educational uses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=SpywareBlaster Freeware Guidelines |publisher=JavaCool Software  |url=http://www.javacoolsoftware.com/sbfreewareguidelines.html |accessdate=2008-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a feature called AutoUpdate is available for a price. The AutoUpdate feature simply checks for and installs any updates for SpywareBlaster. This feature is not included in the freeware due to the required high bandwidth, but users can still update manually without requiring to pay anything.
