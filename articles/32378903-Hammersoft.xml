'''Buckman''' is a privately held, ISO-certified, global [[specialty chemical]] company headquartered in [[Memphis]], [[Tennessee]], USA.  Buckman had revenue of more than $500 million in fiscal year 2010.  The company conducts business in over 90 countries, operates 10 manufacturing sites (Memphis, TN; Cadet, MO; Canada, Europe, Mexico, Brasil, Australia, South Africa, Singapore, and China), and employs approximately 1500.  Core industries are pulp and paper, leather, and water technologies.  Secondary industries include performance chemicals (paint, coatings, plastics, water formulators, wood treatment, and agriculture).
==History==
The company was founded in 1945 in Memphis, TN, USA, by Dr. Stanley J. Buckman with one product that was used to control microbiological problems in paper mills. Three years later in 1948, Buckman Laboratories of Canada was established as a warehouse and marketing company. During the 1950s, the company developed a number of biocides for use in the leather, sugar, and paint industries. Two new fungicides were developed in the 1960s.  During this decade, commercial and industrial water treatment became a new market with the development of products for bacterial and algae control in swimming pools, cooling water systems, and fresh water. In addition to the Memphis plant, a new manufacturing facility was built in Cadet, MO, in 1963.  Looking beyond Canada and the U.S., Buckman also formed a company in Mexico in 1963 and a year later a firm was established in Belgium, which served as the European headquarters.  

Significant growth and expansion occurred in the seventies.  In 1971 new companies were formed in South Africa, Australia, and Brazil. The influence of international growth during this period could be clearly seen by the end of the decade as customers outside the US contributed almost 50% of total sales.  

Founder Dr. Stanley J. Buckman died in 1978, and leadership passed to his son Robert H. Buckman who became CEO. Robertâs cousin Steven B. Buckman was elected President and Chief Operating Officer in 1987.  In the 1980s and 1990s, Robert H. Buckman pushed for greater global communications within the company to enhance business operations.  He recounted these efforts in a book he wrote entitled âBuilding a Knowledge-Driven Organizationâ.&lt;ref&gt;Buckman, Robert H. Building A Knowledge-Driven Organization. Mc-Graw Hill Companies, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the second half of 1991, two new companies were created to establish a presence in the Asia-Pacific region. One company was formed in New Zealand and the other was opened in Singapore. 

In April 2000 Robert H. Buckman retired and Steven B. Buckman assumed the CEO position. Robertâs daughter Katherine Buckman Gibson was elected Chairman of the Board.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Dave.
