Afilias also provides ancillary support to other domains, including .SG (Singapore).

==History==
Afilias was formed in September 2000 by a group of industry-leading domain name registrars in recognition of the need for increased competition in the domain name industry at the registry level. Afilias was selected by [[ICANN]] in November 2000 to launch .info, the first new generic Top Level Domain supported by EPP and based on a &quot;thick&quot; registry model. .info remains the most successful new generic Top Level Domain launched since .com.&lt;ref name=&quot;info&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.info.info/news/2010/09/20/north-america-leads-info-distribution |title=North America Leads .INFO Distribution |publisher=Afilias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2008, Afilias supports over 14 million domain names, making it the second largest registry service provider in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;icann&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dotandco.net/ressources/icann_registries/index.en |title=ICANN Registries |publisher=Dot and Co}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;osbr&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.osbr.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/article/viewArticle/1142/1093|title= Plumbing the Internet with PostgreSQL: An Open Source Case Study |publisher=Open Source Business Resource}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2010 Afilias acquired mTLD Top Level Domain Ltd., the sponsoring organization and registry operator for the .mobi top-level domain (known publicly as dotMobi).  While dotMobi continue to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary, Afilias is now the registered Registry Operator for the .mobi domain.

Afilias is headquartered in [[Dublin]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] with [[United States|US]] offices near [[Philadelphia]], sales offices in [[London]], [[United Kingdom|UK]], an operations center in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]], and operational offices in [[New Delhi]], [[India]].
