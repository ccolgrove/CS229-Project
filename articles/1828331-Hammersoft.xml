'''''Hearts and Minds''''' is a 1974 American [[documentary film]] about the [[Vietnam War]] directed by [[Peter Davis (director)|Peter Davis]]. The film's title is based on a quote from President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]]: &quot;the ultimate victory will depend on the hearts and minds of the people who actually live out there&quot;.&lt;ref name=TheAge/&gt; The movie was chosen as [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] at the [[47th Academy Awards]] presented in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;NY Times&quot;&gt;{{cite news |url=http://movies.nytimes.com/movie/21924/Hearts-and-Minds/details |title=NY Times: Hearts and Minds |accessdate=2008-11-15|work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film premiered at the 1974 [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Commercial distribution was delayed in the United States due to legal issues, including a temporary [[restraining order]] obtained by one of the interviewees, former [[National Security Advisor (United States)|National Security Advisor]] [[Walt Rostow]] who had claimed through his attorney that the film was &quot;somewhat misleading&quot; and &quot;not representative&quot; and that he had not been given the opportunity to approve the results of his interview.&lt;ref name=Dugas&gt;Dugas, David via [[United Press International]].

==Critical reception==
''Hearts and Minds'' has attracted extensive critical attention, almost all of it either glowingly positive or damningly negative, but rarely anything in between, with reviewers tending to treat it either as a masterpiece in political documentary film making or as a hatchet job anti-Vietnam War propaganda film, one that has received &quot;passionately opposing views&quot;.&lt;ref name=NewSchool/&gt;

Vietnam War films from the 1960s to the 1970s reflected deep divisions at home over the war. Some reflected pro-war sentiments and vilified anti-war protesters, while others stood at the opposite end and criticized government officials and policies. &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; was one of the first of the latter to have been produced and released before the war's end in 1975.&lt;ref name=&quot;Schulzinger, Robert D. page 155&quot;/&gt; 

[[Vincent Canby]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called it an &quot;epic documentary ... [that] recalls this nation's agonizing involvement in Vietnam, something you may think you know all about, including the ending. But you don't.&quot;&lt;ref name=canby/&gt; Canby included the film among his ten best of 1975, calling it a &quot;fine, complex, admittedly biased meditation upon American power&quot; and a movie &quot;that will reveal itself as one of the most all-emcompassing records of the American civilization ever put into one film.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Canby, Vincent. [http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10712F63D5916768FDDA10A94DA415B858BF1D3&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=ten%20best%20films%201975&amp;st=cse &quot;FILM VIEW; The Ten Best Films of 1975&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 28, 1975. Accessed August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Desson Thomson]] of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described it as &quot;one of the best documentaries ever made, a superb film about the thoughts and feelings of the era, the whole festering, spirited animus of it.&quot;&lt;ref name=WashPost/&gt; [[Rex Reed]] called it that year's &quot;best film at the Cannes Film Festival&quot; and stated that &quot;[t]his is the only film I have ever seen that sweeps away the gauze surrounding Vietnam and tells the truth.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Rex Reed|Reed, Rex]].

Accessed August 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other reviewers have criticized the movie for its biased presentation. [[Roger Ebert]] for the ''[[Chicago Sun Times]]'' wrote: &quot;Here is a documentary about Vietnam that doesn't really level with us ... If we know something about how footage is obtained and how editing can make points, it sometimes looks like propaganda ... And yet, in scene after scene, the raw material itself is so devastating that it brushes the tricks aside.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Hearts and Minds  |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19740101/REVIEWS/401010317/1023 |quote= |work=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |date=January 1, 1974 |accessdate=2008-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Walter Goodman of ''The New York Times'' in an article titled ''False Art of the Propaganda Film'', pointed out Davis' technique of showing only one side of the interview, pointing out that [[Walt Rostow]]'s response may have been in response to &quot;some provocation, a gesture, a facial expression, a turn of phrase&quot; from his interrogator.&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Walter.

Accessed August 14, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  To this criticism, actress [[Shirley MacLaine]] responded, &quot;[Mr. Goodman] displays the very deception and distortion that is usually associated with the pejorative meaning of propaganda.  For example, Mr. Goodman starts out by claiming that in most countries, propaganda is a monopoly of the state, but that in the United States the most notable examples of propaganda 'come from the state's adversaries.'  This is ridiculous. In America, the state spends millions of dollars every year on propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=MacLaine, Shirley.  |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F10D15FE3A5C107B93C4A9178FD85F418785F9&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=Propaganda%27%20is%20What%20You%20Don%27t%20Agree%20With&amp;st=cse |title='Propaganda' is What You Don't Agree With |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=April 6, 1975 |accessdate=November 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Dugas of [[United Press International]], in a 1975 review printed in ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Pacific Stars and Stripes]]'', saw that &quot;Davis' approach clearly is one-sided and is not likely to impress Vietnam hawks. But his film is brilliantly assembled, biting and informative.&quot;&lt;ref name=Dugas/&gt;

Colin Jacobson wrote in his review of the movie for the DVD Movie Guide: &quot;Probably the biggest criticism one can level at [Hearts and Minds] stems from its editorial bent. Without question, it takes the anti-war side of things, and one could argue it goes for a pro-Vietnamese bent as well....In the end, Hearts and Minds remains a flawed film that simply seems too one-sided for its own good.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;DVDmg&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdmg.com/heartsandminds.shtml|title=Hearts and Minds: Criterion (1974)|last=Jacobson|first=Colin|year=1974|publisher=DVD Movie Guide|accessdate=2008-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review, David Ng of the online ''Images: A Journal of Film and Popular Culture'' wrote: &quot;The documentary is clearly anti-war in both tone and content.&quot;&lt;ref name=Ng&gt;{{citeweb |author=Ng, David. |url=http://www.imagesjournal.com/2002/reviews/heartsminds/ |title=''Images: A Journal of Film and Popular Culture'' |date=2002. |accessdate=2007-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[M.

It is mind that is missing. Perhaps the deepest flaw lies in the method: the Viet Nam War is too convoluted, too devious to be examined in a style of compilation without comment.&quot;&lt;ref name=Time/&gt; 

[[Michael Moore]] has cited ''Hearts and Minds'' as the one movie that inspired him to become a film maker, calling it &quot;not only the best documentary I have ever seen, it may be the best movie ever&quot;.&lt;ref name=TheAge&gt;Schwartz, Larry.

==Academy Award==
After [[Columbia Pictures]] refused to distribute the picture, the producers [[Bert Schneider]] and [[Henry Jaglom]] purchased back the rights and released the film in March 1975 through [[Warner Bros.]] A planned December 18, 1974 opening in [[Los Angeles, California]] was canceled after the production company had been unable to pay the $1 million needed to buy the rights from Columbia Pictures. The film was ultimately shown in Los Angeles for the one week it needed to be eligible for consideration in the 1974 Academy Awards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F30B17F835551A7493CBA81789D95F408785F9 &quot;Documentary on Vietnam Fails to Open; 'Somewhat Misleading&quot;], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 19, 1974.
