==Info==
With the likes of Nashat Akram and striking sensation Younis Mahmoud contained within their ranks, Iraq are by no means short of firepower. However, the team's managerial staff are well aware that, if this attacking-minded side are to compete successfully against the world's best in the FIFA Confederation Cup at South Africa 2009, they will first have to shore up their defence. Crucial to this will be 22-year-old Fareed Majeed, who was brought into the senior squad as recognition of his solid and dependable performances at club level. 
Majeed's physical energy has marked him out as a dependable stalwart on the domestic scene during stints with Iraqi clubs such as Al Talaba, Al Quwa Al Jawiya, Najaf FC and Al Shorta. Before earning his senior debut with the national team in 2007, he had played an active part with Iraq at age group levels, including winning the 2002 West Asia Football Federation (WAFF) Championship with Iraq's Olympic side.
