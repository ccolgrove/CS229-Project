{{Censorship}} 

'''Banned books''' are [[books]] to which free access is not permitted. The practice of banning books is a form of [[censorship]], and often has political, religious or moral motivations.

Bans on books can be enacted at the national or subnational level, and can carry legal penalties for their infraction. Books may also be [[Challenge (literature)|challenged]] at a local, community level. As a result, books can be removed from schools or libraries, although these bans do not extend outside of that area. Similarly, religions may issue lists of banned books â a historical example being the [[Roman Catholic Church]]'s [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] â which do not always carry legal force.

==Background==
&quot;Almost every country places some restrictions on what may be published, although the emphasis and the degree of control differ from country to country and at different periods (1966).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/1966/censorship-of-books/1 A.H. McLintock, An Encyclopaedia of New Zealand: ''Censorship of Books'']&lt;/ref&gt;There are a variety of reasons for which books may be banned. Materials are often suppressed due to the perceived notion of obscenity. This obscenity can apply to materials that are about sexuality, race, drugs, or social standing.
 
Governments have also sought to ban certain books which they perceive to contain material that could threaten, embarrass, or criticize them.&lt;ref&gt;

Other leaders outside of the government have banned books, including religious authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia
 | title = Index Librorum Prohibitorum
 | encyclopedia = Encyclopedia Britannica Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders who prohibit members of their faith from reading the banned books may want to shelter them from perceived obscene, immoral, or profane ideas or situations.

But even religious materials have been subject to censorship. For example, various [[religious text|scriptures]] have been banned (and sometimes burned at several points in history).  The [[Bible]], and other religious scriptures have all been subjected to censorship and have been banned by various governments.  Similarly, books based on the scriptures have also been banned, such as [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[The Kingdom of God Is Within You]]'', which was banned in the [[Russian Empire]] for being [[anti-establishment]].

==Canada==
Banning books is not a common practice in Canada at the current time. While many organizations acknowledge [[Banned Books Week]], the title is something of a misnomer as the programs focus on raising public awareness about challenged, not banned, books. This is a short list of books once banned by various levels of government in [[Canada]]. Follow the link on the right to view the main list for more information on each title.
