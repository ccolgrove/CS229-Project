The '''War on Terror''' (also known as the '''Global War on Terror''' or the '''War on Terrorism''') is a term commonly applied to an international military campaign led by the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] with the support of other [[North Atlantic Treaty Organisation]] (NATO) as well as non-NATO countries. Originally, the campaign was waged against [[al-Qaeda]] and other militant organizations with the purpose of eliminating them.&lt;ref name=&quot;WH 10-07-01&quot;&gt;[[ETA]]

The phrase 'War on Terror' was first used by US President [[George W. Bush]] and other high-ranking US officials to denote a global military, political, legal and ideological struggle against organizations designated as [[terrorist]] and regimes that were accused of having a connection to them or providing them with support or were perceived, or presented as posing a threat to the US and its allies in general. It was typically used with a particular focus on [[Islamic terrorism|militant Islamists]] and al-Qaeda.

Although the term is not officially used by the administration of US President [[Barack Obama]] (which instead uses the term '''Overseas Contingency Operation'''), it is still commonly used by politicians, in the media and officially by some aspects of government, such as the [[United States Armed Forces|United States']] [[Global War on Terrorism Service Medal]].

The origins of [[al-Qaeda]] as a network inspiring terrorism around the world and training operatives can be traced to the [[Soviet War in Afghanistan]] (December 1979 â February 1989).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cooley|first=John K.|authorlink=John K.

==Terminology==
The phrase &quot;War on Terror&quot; has been used to specifically refer to the ongoing military campaign led by the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]] and their allies against organizations and regimes identified by them as [[terrorist]], and excludes other independent [[counter-terrorism|counter-terrorist operations and campaigns]] such as those by [[Russia]] and [[India]]. The conflict has also been referred to by names other than the War on Terror.  It has also been known as:

In 1984 the [[Reagan Administration]] used the term &quot;war against terrorism&quot; as part of an effort to pass legislation that was designed to freeze assets of terrorist groups and marshal the forces of government against them. Author Shane Harris asserts this was a reaction to the [[1983 Beirut barracks bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Silver |first=Alexandra |url=http://www.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,1973131,00.html |title=How America Became a Surveillance State |publisher=Time Magazine - Time.com |date=2010-03-18 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 16, 2001, at [[Camp David]], President George W. Bush used the phrase ''war on terror'' in an unscripted and controversial comment when he said, &quot;This crusade â this war on terrorism â is going to take a while, ... &quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/17/2001-09-17_a_fight_vs__evil__bush_and_c.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100505200651/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2001/09/17/2001-09-17_a_fight_vs__evil__bush_and_c.html|archivedate=2010-05-05 |title=Kenneth R.

The word ''crusade'' was not used again.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Lyons, &quot;Bush enters Mideast's rhetorical minefield&quot; (Reuters: September 21, 2001). [http://hv.greenspun.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg.tcl?msg_id=006SM3 Greenspun.com]&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 20, 2001, during a televised address to a joint session of congress, Bush launched the war on terror when he said, &quot;Our 'war on terror' begins with al-Qaeda, but it does not end there.  It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped and defeated.&quot;&lt;ref name=cnntranscript&gt;{{cite news|title=Transcript of President Bush's address |publisher=CNN |date= 2001-09-20 |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2001/US/09/20/gen.bush.transcript/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bush did not say when he expected this would be achieved. &quot;

US President [[Barack Obama]] has rarely used the term, but in his inaugural address on January 20, 2009, he stated &quot;Our nation is at war, against a far-reaching network of violence and hatred.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/Inauguration/story?id=6689022&amp;page=1 |title=FULL TRANSCRIPT: President Barack Obama's Inaugural Address|publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009 the Defense Department officially changed the name of operations from &quot;Global War on Terror&quot; to &quot;Overseas Contingency Operation&quot; (OCO).&lt;ref name=oco-wapost&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/24/AR2009032402818.html 'Global War On Terror' Is Given New Name], Scott Wilson and Al Kamen, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', March 25, 2009; Page A04&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] requested that [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] staff members avoid use of the term, instead using &quot;Overseas Contingency Operation&quot;.&lt;ref name=oco-wapost/&gt;

Both the term and the policies it denotes have been a source of ongoing controversy, as critics argue it has been used to justify unilateral [[preventive war]], [[human rights]] abuses and other violations of [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;Borhan Uddin Khan and Muhammad Mahbubur Rahman, âCombating Terrorism under Human Rights and Humanitarian Law Regimeâ, Mediterranean Journal of Human Rights, Vol. 12 (Double Issue), 2008, pp.379â397.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

===Operation Active Endeavour===
{{Main|Operation Active Endeavour}}
Operation Active Endeavour is a [[Navy|naval operation]] of NATO started in October 2001 in response to the September 11 attacks. It operates in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and is designed to prevent the movement of militants or [[weapons of mass destruction]] and to enhance the security of shipping in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nato.int/cps/en/natolive/topics_7932.htm |title=Operation Active Endeavour |publisher=[[NATO]] |date=10 November 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operation has also assisted [[Greece]] with its prevention of [[illegal immigration]].

===Operation Enduring Freedom===
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom}}
Operation Enduring Freedom is the official name used by the Bush administration for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|War in Afghanistan]], together with three smaller military actions, under the umbrella of the Global War on Terror. These global operations are intended to seek out and destroy any al-Qaeda fighters or affiliates.

On September 20, 2001, in the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], [[George W. Bush]] delivered an ultimatum to the Taliban government of Afghanistan to turn over Osama bin Laden and [[al-Qaeda]] leaders operating in the country or face attack.&lt;ref name=cnntranscript/&gt; The [[Taliban]] demanded evidence of bin Laden's link to the September 11 attacks and, if such evidence warranted a trial, they offered to handle such a trial in an Islamic Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Taliban rejects president Bush's demands |publisher=PBS |date= 2001-09-21 |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/updates/september01/taliban_9-21.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US refused to provide any evidence.

Subsequently, in October [[2001 in Afghanistan|2001]], US forces (with UK and coalition allies) invaded Afghanistan to oust the Taliban regime. On October 7, 2001, the official invasion began with British and US forces conducting [[airstrike]] campaigns over enemy targets. Kabul, the capital city of Afghanistan, [[Fall of Kabul|fell by mid-November]]. The remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants fell back to the rugged mountains of eastern Afghanistan, mainly Tora Bora. In December, Coalition forces (the US and its allies) [[Battle of Tora Bora|fought within that region]]. It is believed that Osama bin Laden escaped into [[Pakistan]] during the battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/29/world/asia/29torabora.html?_r=1 |title=Senate Report Explores 2001 Escape by bin Laden From Afghan Mountains |publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' |date=28 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Scott |last=Shane}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/nov/29/osama-bin-laden-senate-report |title=Rumsfeld let Bin Laden escape in 2001, says Senate report |date=29 November 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Ed |last=Pilkington |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]'' |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March [[2002 in Afghanistan|2002]], the United States and other [[NATO]] and non-NATO forces launched [[Operation Anaconda]] with the goal of destroying any remaining al-Qaeda and Taliban forces in the [[Shah-i-Kot Valley]] and [[Arma Mountains]] of Afghanistan. The Taliban suffered heavy casualties and evacuated the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.atimes.com/c-asia/DC12Ag01.html |publisher=''[[Asia Times Online]]'' |date=12 March 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |first=Syed Saleem |last=Shahzad |title=Taliban find unlikely allies}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taliban regrouped in western Pakistan and began to unleash an insurgent-style offensive against Coalition forces in late 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=CNN |date=26 March 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-03-26/us/ret.war.facts_1_taliban-fighters-al-qaeda-afghanistan?_s=PM:US |title=Al Qaeda, Taliban may be regrouping}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout southern and eastern Afghanistan, firefights broke out between the surging Taliban and Coalition forces. Coalition forces responded with a series of military offensives and an increase in the amount of troops in Afghanistan. In February [[2010 in Afghanistan|2010]], Coalition forces launched [[Operation Moshtarak]] in southern Afghanistan along with other military offensives in the hopes that they would destroy the Taliban insurgency once and for all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/asia/2010/02/201021343536129252.html |publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]] |date=13 February 2010 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |title=Operation Moshtarak: At a glance}}&lt;/ref&gt; Peace talks are also underway between Taliban affiliated fighters and Coalition forces.

====Operation Enduring Freedom â Philippines====

[[Image:SF Soldier in Philippines.jpg|thumb|[[US Special Forces]] soldier and infantrymen of the [[Philippine Army]]]]

In January 2002, the [[United States Special Operations Command|United States Special Operations Command, Pacific]] deployed to the [[Philippines]] to advise and assist the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]] in combating Filipino Islamist groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.socpac.socom.mil/default.aspx |title=Guardians of the Pacific |date=3 January 2009 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[Special Operations Command, Pacific]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The operations were mainly focused on removing the [[Abu Sayyaf Group]] (ASG) and [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] (JI) from their stronghold on the island of [[Basilan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/agency/dod/jsotf-p.htm |title=Joint Special Operations Task Force â Philippines (JSOTF-P) |publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second portion of the operation was conducted as a humanitarian program called &quot;Operation Smiles.&quot; The goal of the program was to provide medical care and services to the region of Basilan as part of a &quot;Hearts and Minds&quot; program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ait.org.tw/infousa/enus/government/forpolicy/docs/ijpe1104.pdf |title=Improving Lives: Military Humanitarian and Assistance Programs |publisher=[[American Institute in Taiwan]] |date = November 2004|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Operation Enduring Freedom â Philippines |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/enduring-freedom-philippines.htm |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[GlobalSecurity.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This extension of Operation Enduring Freedom was titled OEF-HOA. Unlike other operations contained in Operation Enduring Freedom, OEF-HOA does not have a specific organization as a target. OEF-HOA instead focuses its efforts to disrupt and detect militant activities in the region and to work with willing governments to prevent the reemergence of militant cells and activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=COMBINED JOINT TASK FORCEâHORN OF AFRICA |publisher=United States Africa Command |url=http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090426223216/http://www.hoa.africom.mil/AboutCJTF-HOA.asp |archivedate=2009-04-26 |accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, the [[Combined Joint Task Force - Horn of Africa]] (CJTF-HOA) was established in [[Djibouti]] at [[Camp Lemonnier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10504.pdf |title=DOD Needs to Determine the Future of Its Horn of Africa Task Force |publisher=[[Government Accountability Office]] |date = April 2010|accessdate=19 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contains approximately 2,000 personnel including US military and special operations forces (SOF) and coalition force members, [[Combined Task Force 150]] (CTF-150).

Task Force 150 consists of ships from a shifting group of nations, including [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Pakistan]], [[New Zealand]] and the United Kingdom. The primary goal of the coalition forces is to monitor, inspect, board and stop suspected shipments from entering the Horn of Africa region and affecting the US' [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]].

Included in the operation is the training of selected armed forces units of the countries of Djibouti, [[Kenya]] and [[Ethiopia]] in [[counter-terrorism]] and [[counter-insurgency]] tactics. Humanitarian efforts conducted by CJTF-HOA include rebuilding of schools and medical clinics and providing medical services to those countries whose forces are being trained.

The program expands as part of the [[Trans-Saharan Counterterrorism Initiative]] as CJTF personnel also assist in training the armed forces of [[Chad]], [[Niger]], [[Mauritania]] and [[Mali]]. However, the War on Terror does not include [[Sudan]], where over 400,000 have died in an ongoing civil war.

On July 1, 2006, a Web-posted message purportedly written by Osama bin Laden urged [[Somalis]] to build an [[Islamic state]] in the country and warned western governments that the [[al-Qaeda]] network would fight against them if they intervened there.&lt;ref name=BIN-LADEN-MESSAGE-IRAQ-SOMALIA&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-07-01-bin-laden-plans-message_x.htm Bin Laden releases Web message on Iraq, Somalia] USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

Somalia has been considered a &quot;[[failed state]]&quot; because its official central government was weak, dominated by warlords and unable to exert effective control over the country. Beginning in mid-2006, the [[Islamic Courts Union|Islamic Courts Union (ICU)]], an Islamist faction campaigning on a restoration of &quot;law and order&quot; through [[Sharia]] law, had rapidly taken control of much of southern Somalia.

On December 14, 2006, the US Assistant Secretary of State [[Jendayi Frazer]] claimed al-Qaeda cell operatives were controlling the Islamic Courts Union, a claim denied by the ICU.&lt;ref name=US-SAYS-AL-QAEDA-BEHIND-SOMALI-ISLAMISTS&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20080204082431/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L14556061.htm US says al Qaeda behind Somali Islamists] Reuters&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 2006, the UN-backed [[Transitional Federal Government]] (TFG) of Somalia had seen its power effectively limited to [[Baidoa]], while the Islamic Courts Union controlled the majority of southern Somalia, including the capital of [[Mogadishu]]. On December 20, 2006, the Islamic Courts Union launched an [[Battle of Baidoa|offensive]] on the government stronghold of Baidoa, and saw early gains before [[Ethiopia]] intervened in favor of the government.

By December 26, the Islamic Courts Union retreated towards Mogadishu, before again retreating as TFG/Ethiopian troops neared, leaving them to take Mogadishu with [[Fall of Mogadishu|no resistance]]. The ICU then fled to [[Kismayo]], where they fought Ethiopian/TFG forces in the [[Battle of Jilib]].

The Prime Minister of Somalia claimed that three &quot;terror suspects&quot; from the [[1998 United States embassy bombings]] are being sheltered in Kismayo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2004/jun/13/usa.terrorism | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Secret world of US jails | first=Jason | last=Burke | date=June 13, 2004 | accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 30, 2006, al-Qaeda deputy leader [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] called upon Muslims worldwide to fight against Ethiopia and the TFG in Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/cfr/world/slot2_20090227.html?_r=1|title= Backgrounder: Al-Shabaab |work=www.nytimes.com|author=Stephanie Hanson|date=March 2, 2009|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 8, 2007, the US launched the [[Battle of Ras Kamboni]] by bombing [[Ras Kamboni]] using [[AC-130]] gunships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,242460,00.html |title=U.S. Launches Attack on Suspected Al Qaeda Members in Somalia |publisher=FOXNews.com |date=2007-01-09 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 14, 2009, [[US Special Forces]] killed two men and wounded and captured two others near the Somali village of [[Baraawe raid|Baarawe]].  Witnesses claim that helicopters used for the operation launched from French-flagged warships, but that could not be confirmed.

====Operation Enduring Freedom â Trans Sahara====
{{Main|Operation Enduring Freedom â Trans Sahara}}
Operation Enduring Freedom â Trans Sahara (OEF-TS) is the name of the military operation conducted by the United States and partner nations in the Sahara/Sahel region of Africa, consisting of counter-terrorism efforts and policing of arms and drug trafficking across central Africa.

===Iraq===

[[Iraq]] had been listed as a State sponsor of international terrorism by the United States since 1990,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iraq accuses US, Turkey of 'illegally' meeting with Kurds |publisher=CNN |date=2000-03-09 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2000/WORLD/meast/03/09/un.iraq/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; when [[IraqâUnited States relations|Saddam Hussein fell out of US favor]]. The regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] proved a continuing problem for the UN and Iraqâs neighbors in its use of [[chemical weapons]] against [[Iran]]ians and [[Kurds]].

====Iraqi no-fly zones====
After the [[Gulf War]], the US, French and British militaries instituted and began patrolling [[Iraqi no-fly zones]], to protect Iraq's Kurdish minority and [[Shi'a]] [[Arab]] populationâboth of which suffered attacks from the Hussein regime before and after the Gulf Warâin Iraq's northern and southern regions, respectively. US forces continued in combat zone deployments through November 1995 and launched [[Operation Desert Fox]] against Iraq in 1998 after it failed to meet US demands of &quot;unconditional cooperation&quot; in weapons inspections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Clinton: Iraq has abused its final chance |publisher=CNN |date=1998-12-16 |url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/12/16/clinton/index.html?eref=sitesearch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to Operation Desert Fox, US president [[Bill Clinton]] predicted &quot;And mark my words, he will develop weapons of mass destruction. He will deploy them, and he will use them.&quot; Clinton also declared a desire to remove Hussein from power and in the same speech said, &quot;The hard fact is that so long as Saddam remains in power, he threatens the well-being of his people, the peace of his region, the security of the world.&quot; In the aftermath of Operation Desert Fox, during December 1998, Iraq announced that it would no longer respect the no-fly zones and resumed its attempts to shoot down US aircraft.

Air strikes by the British and US against Iraqi anti-aircraft and military targets continued over the next few years. Also in 1998, Clinton signed the [[Iraq Liberation Act]], which called for regime change in Iraq on the basis of its alleged possession of weapons of mass destruction, oppression of Iraqi citizens, and attacks on other Middle Eastern countries.

The George W. Bush administration called for the [[United Nations Security Council]] (UNSC) to again send weapons inspectors to Iraq to find and destroy the alleged weapons of mass destruction and called for a UNSC resolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bush's remarks after UN passes Iraq resolution |publisher=CNN |date=2002-11-08 |url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/US/11/08/bush.transcript/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSC Resolution 1441]] was passed unanimously, which offered Iraq &quot;a final opportunity to comply with its disarmament obligations&quot; or face &quot;serious consequences.&quot;

Resolution 1441 did not authorize the use of force by member states. The Iraqi government subsequently allowed UN inspectors some access to Iraqi sites, while the US government continued to assert that Iraq was being obstructionist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/iraq/resolution2_2-24-03.html |title=The Second UN Resolution|date=February 24, 2003|work=www.pbs.org|accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, a large bipartisan majority in the [[United States Congress]] authorized the president to use force if necessary to disarm Iraq in order to &quot;prosecute the war on terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Joint Resolution to Authorize the Use of United States Armed Forces Against Iraq |date=2002-10-02 |publisher=[[White House]] |url=http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/10/print/20021002-2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to overcome opposition from [[France]], [[Russia]], and [[China]] against a UNSC resolution that would sanction the use of force against Iraq, and before the UN weapons inspectors had completed their inspections (which were claimed to be fruitless by the US because of Iraq's alleged deception), the United States assembled a &quot;[[Coalition of the Willing]]&quot; composed of nations who pledged support for its policy of regime change in Iraq.

====Operation Iraqi Freedom====

The [[Iraq War]] began in March [[2003 in Iraq|2003]] with an air campaign, which was immediately followed by a [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S.-led ground invasion]]. The Bush administration stated the invasion was the &quot;serious consequences&quot; spoken of in the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1441|UNSC Resolution 1441]]. The Bush administration also [[Iraq War and U.S. Global War on Terror|stated the Iraq war]] was part of the War on Terror, something later [[Criticism of the War on Terror|questioned or contested]].

[[Battle of Baghdad (2003)|Baghdad, Iraqâs capital city, fell]] in April 2003 and [[Saddam Hussein|Saddam Husseinâs]] government quickly dissolved. On May 1, 2003, [[2003 Mission Accomplished speech|Bush announced]] that major combat operations in Iraq had ended.&lt;ref&gt;

Other elements of the insurgency were led by fugitive members of President Hussein's [[Ba'ath]] regime, which included Iraqi nationalists and [[pan-Arabist]]s.

[[Execution of Saddam Hussein|He was executed]] in [[2006 in Iraq|2006]].

In [[2004 in Iraq|2004]], the insurgent forces grew stronger. The United States conducted attacks on insurgent strongholds in cities like [[Battle of Najaf (2004)|Najaf]] and [[Second Battle of Fallujah|Fallujah]].

In January [[2007 in Iraq|2007]], President Bush presented a new strategy for [[Operation Iraqi Freedom]] based upon [[counter-insurgency]] theories and tactics developed by General [[David Petraeus]]. The [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]] was part of this &quot;new way forward&quot; and, along with US backing of [[Sunni]] groups it had previously sought to defeat, has been credited with a widely recognized dramatic decrease in violence by up to 80%.

====Operation New Dawn====
The war entered a new phase on September 1, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2010/0819/Iraq-war-Last-US-combat-brigade-crosses-into-Kuwait |title=Iraq war: Last US combat brigade crosses into Kuwait |publisher=CSMonitor.com |date=2010-08-19 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the official end of US combat operations. However, 50,000 US troops remain in an advise and assist role to provide support for Iraqi security forces.

[[Image:BritishPatrolHelmand01.jpg|thumb|right|The [[United Kingdom]] is the second largest contributor of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001âpresent)|Afghanistan]].]]
The invasion of Afghanistan is seen to have been the first action of this war, and initially involved forces from the [[United States]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the Afghan [[Northern Alliance]]. Since the initial invasion period, these forces were augmented by troops and aircraft from [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Norway]] amongst others. In 2006, there were about 33,000 troops in Afghanistan.

On September 12, 2001, less than 24 hours after the September 11 attacks in New York City and Washington, D.C., [[NATO]] invoked Article 5 of the [[North Atlantic Treaty]] and declared the attacks to be an attack against all 19 NATO member countries. [[Australian]] [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] [[John Howard]] also declared that Australia would invoke the [[ANZUS]] Treaty along similar lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] |date=14 September 2001 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |url=http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2001/s367069.htm |title=PM speaks on Ansett collapse, Anzus treaty}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following months, NATO took a wide range of measures to respond to the threat of terrorism. On November 22, 2002, the member states of the [[Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council]] (EAPC) decided on a Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism which explicitly states that &quot;EAPC States are committed to the protection and promotion of fundamental freedoms and human rights, as well as the rule of law, in combating terrorism.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Partnership Action Plan against Terrorism |url=http://pfpdev.ethz.ch/SCORMcontent/72234/scos/93/documents/0.pdf |date=22 November 2002 |accessdate=19 January 2011 |publisher=[[NATO]]}}{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; NATO started naval operations in the [[Mediterranean Sea]] designed to prevent the movement of terrorists or weapons of mass destruction as well as to enhance the security of shipping in general called Operation Active Endeavour.

Support for the United States cooled when America made clear its determination to invade Iraq in late 2002. Even so, many of the &quot;coalition of the willing&quot; countries that unconditionally supported the US-led military action have sent troops to Afghanistan, particular neighboring [[Pakistan]], which has disowned its earlier support for the Taliban and contributed tens of thousands of soldiers to the conflict. Pakistan was also engaged in the [[War in North-West Pakistan]] (Waziristan War). Supported by US intelligence, Pakistan was attempting to remove the Taliban insurgency and al-Qaeda element from the northern tribal areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New frontline in the war on terror.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Security Assistance Force===

:{{Main|International Security Assistance Force}}

December 2001 saw the creation of the NATO-led [[International Security Assistance Force]] (ISAF) to assist the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] and the first post-Taliban elected government. With a renewed Taliban insurgency, it was announced in 2006 that ISAF would replace the US troops in the province as part of Operation Enduring Freedom.

The British [[16th Air Assault Brigade]] (later reinforced by [[Royal Marines]]) formed the core of the force in southern Afghanistan, along with troops and helicopters from Australia, Canada and the Netherlands. The initial force consisted of roughly 3,300 British, 2,000 Canadian, 1,400 from the Netherlands and 240 from Australia, along with special forces from Denmark and [[Estonia]] and small contingents from other nations. The monthly supply of cargo containers through Pakistani route to ISAF in Afghanistan is over 4,000 costing around 12 billion in Pakistani Rupees.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenewstribe.com/2011/01/29/war-on-terror-cost-of-us-taxpayers-patience/#.TtjwPLLNllk Afghan war cost rise tests US taxpayersâ patience]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UK troops take over Afghan duties|date=2006-06-01|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4961368.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Canada set for longer Afghan stay |date=2006-06-16 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4984880.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Australia outlines Afghan force|date=2006-05-08|publisher=BBC|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/4983540.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=More Dutch troops for Afghanistan |date=2006-02-03 |publisher=BBC |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4673026.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, former President of Pakistan [[Pervez Musharraf]] sided with the United States against the Taliban government in Afghanistan after an ultimatum by US President George W. Bush.  Musharraf agreed to give the United States the use of three airbases for Operation Enduring Freedom. [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] and other administration officials met with Musharraf. On September 19, 2001, Musharraf addressed the people of Pakistan and stated that, while he opposed military tactics against the Taliban, Pakistan risked being endangered by an alliance of India and the US if it did not cooperate. In 2006, Musharraf testified that this stance was pressured by threats from the US, and revealed in his memoirs that he had &quot;war-gamed&quot; the United States as an adversary and decided that it would end in a loss for Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/news/world/2006-09-25-pakistan-memoir_x.htm  Musharraf's book says Pakistan faced US 'onslaught' if it didn't back terror war] 9/26/2006 USA Today&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 12, 2002, Musharraf gave a speech against Islamic extremism. He unequivocally condemned all acts of terrorism and pledged to combat Islamic extremism and lawlessness within Pakistan itself. He stated that his government was committed to rooting out extremism and made it clear that the banned militant organizations would not be allowed to resurface under any new name. He said, &quot;the recent decision to ban extremist groups promoting militancy was taken in the national interest after thorough  consultations. It was not taken under any foreign influence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.dawn.com/dawnftp/72.249.57.55/dawnftp/fixed/arch/arch_2003.html |title=Musharraf vows to root out extremism: Banned outfits wonât be allowed to resurface|publisher=Dawn.Com |date=December 5, 2003|first=Rafaqat|last= Ali |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, the Musharraf-led government took a firm stand against the jihadi organizations and groups promoting extremism, and  arrested [[Maulana Masood Azhar]], head of the [[Jaish-e-Mohammed]], and [[Hafiz Muhammad Saeed]], chief of the [[Lashkar-e-Taiba]], and took dozens of activists into custody. An official ban was imposed on the groups on January 12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/South_Asia/DH20Df07.html |title=Musharraf braced for jihadi backlash |publisher=Atimes.com |date=2002-08-20 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the [[Saudi Arabia|Saudi]] born [[Abu Zubaydah|Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah]] was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint US-Pakistan raids. Zubaydah is said to have been a high-ranking al-Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al-Qaeda training camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/asiapcf/south/04/01/pakistan.alqaeda/ | work=CNN | title=Officials: Captured man says he's al Qaeda brass | date=April 1, 2002 | accessdate=April 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent al-Qaeda members were arrested in the following two years, namely [[Ramzi bin al-Shibh]], who is known to have been a financial backer of al-Qaeda operations, and [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], who at the time of his capture was the third highest ranking official in al-Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the September 11 attacks.

In 2004, the [[Pakistan Army]] launched a campaign in the [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of Pakistan's [[Waziristan]] region, sending in 80,000 troops. The goal of the conflict was to remove the [[al-Qaeda]] and Taliban forces in the region.

After the fall of the Taliban regime many members of the Taliban resistance fled to the Northern border region of Afghanistan and Pakistan where the Pakistani army had previously little control. With the logistics and air support of the United States, the Pakistani Army captured or killed numerous al-Qaeda operatives such as Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, wanted for his involvement in the USS Cole bombing, the [[Bojinka plot]], and the killing of ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter [[Daniel Pearl]].

The United States has carried out a campaign of [[Drone attacks in Pakistan|Drone attacks]] on targets all over the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. However, the [[Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan|Pakistani Taliban]] resistance still operates there. To this day itâs estimated that 15 US soldiers were killed while fighting al-Qaeda and Taliban remnants in Pakistan since the War on Terror began.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://icasualties.org/oef/ |title=Operation Enduring Freedom &amp;#124; Afghanistan |publisher=iCasualties |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. Military aid to other countries==
{{See also|United States military aid|United States Foreign Military Financing}}
;Pakistan
In the three years before the attacks of September 11, Pakistan received approximately $9 million in American military aid. In the three years after, the number increased to $4.2 billion, making it the country with the maximum funding post 9/11.

Such a huge inflow of funds has raised concerns in the Indian press that these funds were given without any accountability, as the end uses not being documented, and that large portions were used to suppress civilians' human rights and to purchase weapons to contain domestic problems like the [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] unrest. Pakistan has stated that India has been supporting terror groups within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] with the aim of creating unrest within the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[India Today]] |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/24792/Cover+Story/Tackling+Pakistan.html |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20091124135535/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/site/Story/24792/COVER%20STORY/Tackling+Pakistan.html |archivedate=2009-11-24 |title=Tackling Pakistan |date= January 9, 2009 |accessdate=12 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Lebanon
{{See also|2007 Lebanon conflict}}
On May 20, 2007, a conflict began in north [[Lebanon]] after fighting broke out between [[Fatah al-Islam]], an [[Islamism|Islamist]] [[List of designated terrorist organizations|militant organization]], and the [[Lebanese Armed Forces]] in [[Nahr al-Bared]], a [[Palestinian refugee|Palestinian]] [[List of Palestinian refugee camps|refugee camp]] near [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]]. The conflict evolved mostly around the Siege of Nahr el-Bared, but minor clashes also occurred in the [[Ain al-Hilweh]] refugee camp in southern Lebanon and several bombings took place in and around Lebanon's capital, [[Beirut]].

Fatah-al-Islam has been described as a militant [[mujahid]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Figaro_20070416&quot;&gt;Le Figaro (April 16, 2007). [http://www.lefigaro.fr/english/20070416.WWW000000477_fatah_al_islam_the_new_terrorist_threat_hanging_over_lebanon.html &quot;Fatah Al-Islam: the new terrorist threat hanging over Lebanon&quot;].

On September 7, 2007, Lebanese government forces captured the camp and declared victory.

{{further|[[Detentions following the September 11, 2001 Terrorist Attack]] and [[Aftermath of the September 11 attacks]]}}

In addition to military efforts abroad, in the aftermath of 9/11 the Bush Administration increased domestic efforts to prevent future attacks. Various government bureaucracies which handled security and military functions were reorganized. A new cabinet level agency called the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] was created in November 2002 to lead and coordinate the largest reorganization of the US federal government since the consolidation of the armed forces into the Department of Defense.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

The Justice Department launched a [[Special Registration]] procedure for certain male non-citizens in the US, requiring them to register in person at offices of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]].

{{main|USA PATRIOT Act}}
The [[USA PATRIOT Act]] of October 2001 dramatically reduces restrictions on law enforcement agencies' ability to search telephone, e-mail communications, medical, financial, and other records; eases restrictions on foreign intelligence gathering within the United States; expands the [[Secretary of the Treasury]]âs authority to regulate financial transactions, particularly those involving foreign individuals and entities; and broadens the discretion of law enforcement and immigration authorities in detaining and deporting immigrants suspected of terrorism-related acts. The act also expanded the definition of terrorism to include domestic terrorism, thus enlarging the number of activities to which the USA PATRIOT Act's expanded law enforcement powers could be applied. A new [[Terrorist Finance Tracking Program]] monitored the movements of terrorists' financial resources (discontinued after being revealed by [[The New York Times]] newspaper). Telecommunication usage by known and suspected terrorists was studied through the [[NSA electronic surveillance program]]. The Patriot Act is still in effect.

Political interest groups have stated that these laws remove important restrictions on governmental authority, and are a dangerous encroachment on civil liberties, possible [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] violations of the [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]]. On July 30, 2003, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) filed the first legal challenge against Section 215 of the Patriot Act, claiming that it allows the [[FBI]] to violate a citizen's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights, [[Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourth Amendment]] rights, and right to [[due process]], by granting the government the right to search a person's business, bookstore, and library records in a terrorist investigation, without disclosing to the individual that records were being searched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/ala/alonline/currentnews/newsarchive/2003/august2003/firstpatriot.cfm |title=American Libraries â First Patriot Act Challenge Filed by ACLU |publisher=ALA |date=2003-08-04 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, governing bodies in a number of communities have passed symbolic resolutions against the act.

In a speech on June 9, 2005, Bush said that the USA PATRIOT Act had been used to bring charges against more than 400 suspects, more than half of whom had been convicted. Meanwhile the ACLU quoted Justice Department figures showing that 7,000 people have complained of abuse of the Act.

The Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ([[DARPA]]) began an initiative in early 2002 with the creation of the [[Total Information Awareness]] program, designed to promote information technologies that could be used in counter-terrorism. This program, facing criticism, has since been defunded by Congress.

By 2003, 12 major conventions and protocols were designed to combat terrorism. These were adopted and ratified by a number of states. These conventions require states to co-operate on principal issues regarding unlawful seizure of aircraft, the physical protection of nuclear materials, and the freezing of assets of militant networks.&lt;ref&gt;Cindy C Combs (2003), Terrorism in the Twenty First Century, (3rd Edition, New Jersey: Pearsons Educ. Inc.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 the UN Security Council adopted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1624|Resolution 1624]] concerning incitement to commit acts of terrorism and the obligations of countries to comply with international [[human rights]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/sc/ctc/ |title=UN Security Council Counter-Terrorism Committee |publisher=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both resolutions require mandatory annual reports on [[counter-terrorism]] activities by adopting nations, the United States and [[Israel]] have both declined to submit reports. In the same year, the [[United States Department of Defense]] and the [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] issued a planning document, by the name &quot;National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism&quot;  which stated that it constituted the &quot;comprehensive military plan to prosecute the Global War on Terror for the [[Military of the United States|Armed Forces of the United States]]...including the findings and recommendations of the [[9/11 Commission]] and a rigorous examination with the Department of Defense&quot;.

On January 9, 2007, the House of Representatives passed a bill, by a vote of 299â128,  enacting many of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission The bill passed in the US Senate,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=110&amp;session=1&amp;vote=00073 US Senate: Legislation &amp; Records&lt;!-- Bot generated   title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; by a vote of 60â38, on March  13, 2007 and it was signed into law on August 3, 2007 by President Bush. It became Public Law 110-53.

The [[Office of Strategic Influence]] was secretly created after 9/11 for the purpose of coordinating propaganda efforts, but was closed soon after being discovered. The Bush administration implemented the [[Continuity of Operations Plan]] (or Continuity of Government) to ensure that US government would be able to continue in catastrophic circumstances.

Since 9/11, extremists made various attempts to attack the US homeland, with varying levels of organization and skill. For example, vigilant passengers aboard a transatlantic flight prevented [[Richard Reid (shoe bomber)|Richard Reid]], in 2001, and [[Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab]], in 2009, from detonating an explosive device.

Other terrorist plots have been stopped by federal agencies using new legal powers and investigative tools, sometimes in cooperation with foreign governments.

Such thwarted attacks include:
*The [[2001 shoe bomb plot]]
*A plan to crash airplanes into the [[U.S. Bank Tower (Los Angeles)|US Bank Tower]] (aka Library Tower) in Los Angeles
*The 2003 plot by [[Iyman Faris]] to blow up the [[Brooklyn Bridge]] in New York City
*The [[2004 Financial buildings plot]] which targeted the [[International Monetary Fund]] and [[World Bank]] buildings in [[Washington, DC]], the [[New York Stock Exchange]] and other financial institutions
*The 2004 [[Columbus Shopping Mall Bombing Plot]]
*The [[2006 Sears Tower plot]]
*The [[2007 Fort Dix attack plot]]
*The [[2007 John F. Kennedy International Airport attack plot]]
*The [[Najibullah Zazi|New York Subway Bombing Plot]] and [[2010 Times Square car bombing attempt]]

The Obama administration has promised the closing of the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], increased the number of troops in [[War in Afghanistan (2001-present)|Afghanistan]], and promised the withdrawal of its troops from [[War in Iraq|Iraq]].

This estimate counts only &quot;impact deaths&quot;âdeaths that occurred in the immediate aftermath of an explosion or shootingâand does not count deaths that occurred later as a result of injuries sustained, or deaths that occurred as an indirect consequence of the US airstrikes and invasion.

:*In an opinion article published in August 2002 in the magazine [[The Weekly Standard]], [[Joshua Muravchik]] of the [[American Enterprise Institute]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2006/10/10/the_fp_memo_operation_comeback |title=The FP Memo: Operation Comeback â By Joshua Muravchik |publisher=Foreign Policy |date=2006-10-10 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; questioned Professor Herold's study entirely on the basis of one single incident that involved 25â93 deaths.

:*In a pair of January 2002 studies, Carl Conetta of the Project on Defense Alternatives estimates that &quot;at least&quot; 4,200â4,500 civilians were killed by mid-January 2002 as a result of the US war and airstrikes, both directly as casualties of the aerial bombing campaign, and indirectly in the resulting humanitarian crisis.

==Costs==
A March 2011 Congressional Research Service report, âThe Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Other Global War on Terror Operations Since 9/11,&quot; analyzed the financial outlays that have been made for the conflicts during this nearly decade-long period. The report focuses on expenditures related to Operation Enduring Freedom (OEF) Afghanistan and other counter terror operations; Operation Noble Eagle (ONE), providing enhanced security at military bases; and Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF). The reportâs total does not include supplementary economic, food and military aid to Pakistan or assistance to several countries in Africa. The report states that the price tag through fiscal year 2011 for such purposes as military operations, base security, reconstruction, foreign aid, embassy costs, and veteransâ health care will be $1.283 trillion. If the fiscal year budget for 2012 is approved, the total global security and conflict-related costs will be $1.415 trillion. If deployed troop levels come down to 45,000 by 2015 and stay there through 2021, the total two-decade cost is estimated to be $1.8 trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/international/cost-iraq-afghanistan-terror/ |title = &quot;Cost of Iraq, Afghanistan, and Anti-Terrorism Operations&quot; |publisher = Journalist's Resource.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of a &quot;war&quot;  against &quot;terror&quot; or &quot;terrorism&quot; has proven highly contentious, with critics charging that it has been exploited by participating governments to pursue long-standing policy objectives, reduce [[civil liberties]], and infringe upon [[human rights]]. Some argue that the term ''war'' is not appropriate in this context, since they believe there is no  identifiable enemy, and that it is unlikely international terrorism can  be brought to an end by military means.&lt;ref name=&quot;Richissin&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html|title=&quot;War on terror&quot; difficult to define|last=Richissin|first=Todd|date=2004-09-02|publisher=''The Balitmore Sun''|accessdate=2009-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] and head of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] in the United Kingdom, [[Ken Macdonald|Ken McDonald]] has stated that those responsible for acts of terror such as the [[7 July 2005 London bombings]] are  not &quot;soldiers&quot; in a war, but &quot;inadequates&quot; who should be dealt with by the [[criminal justice system]].&lt;ref&gt;&quot;There is no war on  terror in the UK, says DPP&quot;, [[The Times]], January 24, 2007, p.12, [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-2563401,00.html  TimesOnline.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics, such as [[Francis Fukuyama]], note that &quot;[[Definition of terrorism|terrorism]]&quot; is not an enemy but a tactic;  calling it a &quot;war on terror&quot; obscures differences between conflicts.

The term terrorism has been characterized as unacceptably vague. The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] stated that there is lack of agreement on a definition of terrorism and that has proven to be an obstacle to meaningful international countermeasures. It proceeds to declare that &quot;Some have often commented that one state's 'terrorist' is another state's 'freedom fighter'&quot;. Governments in [[Iran]], [[Lebanon]], and [[Venezuela]] consistently use the term &quot;terrorism&quot; to describe actions taken by the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailystar.com.lb/Opinion/Commentary/Aug/03/An-open-letter-to-the-American-president.ashx |title=&quot;An open letter to the American president&quot; |publisher=Lebanon '&amp;#39;Daily Star' |date=2006-08-03 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of state terrorism by the US and the inherent hypocrisy of the term have been commented upon by Americans as well, including 3 star general [[William Odom]], formerly President Reagan's [[National Security Agency|NSA]] Director, who wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;As many critics have pointed out, terrorism is not an enemy. It is a tactic. Because the United States itself has a long record of supporting terrorists and  [[United States and state terrorism|
using terrorist tactics]], the slogans of today's war on terrorism merely makes the United States look hypocritical to the rest of the world. A prudent American president would end the present policy of &quot;sustained hysteria&quot; over potential terrorist attacks..treat terrorism as a serious but not a strategic problem, encourage Americans to regain their confidence, and refuse to let al Qaeda keep us in a state of fright.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;odom_terrorismtactic&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middlebury.edu/media/view/214721/original/OdomPaper.pdf |title=American Hegemony: How to Use It, How to Lose It by Gen.

Further criticism maintains that the War on Terror provides a framework for [[perpetual war]]; the announcement of such open-ended goals produces a state of endless conflict, since &quot;terrorist groups&quot; can continue to arise indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;Richissin, Todd. &quot;&lt;cite&gt;[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002023596_russanal02.html 'War on terror' difficult to define]&lt;/cite&gt;&quot; [[Baltimore Sun|The Baltimore Sun]], 2 September 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; George W.

The War on Terror has been criticized as inefficient, with a number of security experts, politicians, and policy organizations having claimed that the War on Terror has been counterproductive, that it has consolidated opposition to the US, aided terrorist recruitment, and increased the likelihood of attacks against the US and its allies. In a 2005 briefing paper, the [[Oxford Research Group]] reported that &quot;Al-Qaida and its affiliates remain active and effective, with a stronger support base and a higher intensity of attacks than before 9/11. ...Far from winning the 'war on terror', the second [[George W. Bush administration]] is maintaining policies that are not curbing paramilitary movements and are actually increasing violent anti-Americanism.&quot; On September 19, 2008, the [[RAND]] Corporation presented the results of a comprehensive study for &quot;Defeating Terrorist Groups&quot; before the United States House Armed Services Committees, which said that &quot;by far the most effective strategy against religious groups has been the use of local police and intelligence services, which were responsible for the end of 73 percent of [terrorist] groups since 1968.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/testimonies/CT314/ |title=Defeating Terrorist Groups |publisher=RAND |date= |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The RAND Corporation recommended &quot;[The US military] should generally resist being drawn into combat operations in Muslim countries where its presence is likely to increase terrorist recruitment.&quot;  They stated that &quot;moving away from military references would indicate that there was no battlefield solution to countering terrorism.&quot;

Others have criticized the US for [[double standard]]s in its dealings with key allies that are also known to support terrorist groups, such as [[Pakistan]]. [[Afghanistan|Afghan]] President [[Hamid Karzai]] has repeatedly stated that in the &quot;war against terrorism,&quot; âthe central front is Pakistan&quot;; Pakistan has also been alleged to provide [[Taliban]] operatives with covert support via the [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=2006%5C11%5C16%5Cstory_16-11-2006_pg7_23 |title=âPakistan must not harbour Talibanâ By Khalid Hasan |publisher=Dailytimes.com.pk |date=2006-11-16 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; These accusations of double dealing apply to civil liberties&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lemann |first=Nicholas |url=http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/12/08/031208ta_talk_lemann |title=Democracy Hypocrisy |publisher=The New Yorker |date=2003-12-08 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and human rights as well as terrorism. According to the [[Federation of American Scientists]], &quot;[i]n its haste to strengthen the &quot;frontline&quot; states' ability to confront transnational terrorist threats on their soil, and to gain the cooperation of regimes of geostrategic significance to the next phases of the &quot;War on Terrorism&quot;, the administration is disregarding normative restrictions on US aid to human rights abusers.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/terrorism/at/docs/Aid&amp;Humanrights.html |title=&quot;The War on Terrorism&quot; and Human Rights: Aid to Abusers |publisher=Fas.org |date=2008-05-30 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a sample survey conducted by the [[Pew Research Center]], international support of the War on Terror has also faced a substantial decline, both in public opinion and by foreign state officials. In 2002, strong majorities supported the US-led War on Terror in [[UK|Britain]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Japan]], [[India]], and [[Russia]]. By 2006, supporters of the effort were in the minority in Britain (49%), France (43%), Germany (47%), and Japan (26%). Although a majority of Russians still supported the War on Terror, that majority had decreased by 21%. Whereas 63% of the Spanish population supported the War on Terror in 2003, only 19% of the population indicated support in 2006. 19% of the Chinese population supports the War on Terror, and less than a fifth of the populations of [[Turkey]], [[Egypt]], and [[Jordan]] support the effort. The report of the Pew Research Center also indicates that the Indian public support for the War on Terror has been stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewglobal.org/2007/03/14/americas-image-in-the-world-findings-from-the-pew-global-attitudes-project/ |title=Pew Global Attitudes Project: Americaâs Image in the World: Findings from the Pew Global Attitudes Project |publisher=Pewglobal.org |date=2007-03-14 |accessdate=2011-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Kohut, speaking to the U.S. House Committee on Foreign Affairs, noted that, according to the [[Pew Research Center]] polls conducted in 2004, &quot;majorities or pluralities in seven of the nine countries surveyed said the US-led war on terror was not really a sincere effort to reduce international terrorism. This was true not only in Muslim countries such as Morocco and Turkey, but in France and Germany as well. The true purpose of the war on terror, according to the people surveyed, is American control of Middle East oil and US domination of the world.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.au.af.mil/au/awc/awcgate/congress/koh111005.pdf|title=Testimony of Andrew Kohut, House of Representatives International Relations Committee|work=www.au.af.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stella Rimington]], former head of the British intelligence service [[MI5]], has criticized the war on terror as a &quot;huge overreaction&quot;, and had decried the militarization and politicization of the US efforts as being the wrong approach to terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Norton-Taylor |first=Richard |title=Response to 9/11 was &quot;hugh overreaction&quot; |journal=[[The Guardian]] |issue=October 18 |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2008/oct/18/stella-rimington-9-11-mi5 |accessdate=2008-10-22 | location=London | date=October 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2009, the  British [[Foreign Secretary]], [[David Miliband]], wrote that &quot;ultimately, the notion is misleading and mistaken&quot; and later said &quot;Historians will judge whether [the notion] has done more harm than good&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Julian |last=Berger |title='War on Terror' was a mistake, says Milliband |work=[[The Guardian]] |page= |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=15 January 2009|quote=democracies must respond to terrorism by championing the rule of law, not subordinating it |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2009/jan/15/war-on-terror-miliband | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Milliband |title='War on Terror' was wrong |work=[[The Guardian]] |page= |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=15 January 2009|quote= The call for a &quot;war on terror&quot; was a call to arms, an attempt to build solidarity for a fight against a single shared enemy. But the foundation for solidarity between peoples and nations should be based not on who we are against, but on the idea of who we are and the values we share. Terrorists succeed when they render countries fearful and vindictive; when they sow division and animosity; when they force countries to respond with violence and repression. The best response is to refuse to be cowed.

Kuypers]] illustrated &quot;how the press failed America in its coverage on the War on Terror.&quot; In each comparison, Kuypers &quot;detected massive bias on the part of the press.&quot; The researcher called the mainstream news media an &quot;anti-democratic institution&quot; in his conclusion. The findings of the research suggest that the public is misinformed about government justification and plans concerning the war on terror.

Others have also suggested that press coverage has contributed to a public confused and misinformed on both the nature and level of the threat to the US posed by terrorism. In his book ''Trapped in the War on Terror''&lt;ref&gt;

political scientist Ian S. Lustick states &quot;the media have given constant attention to possible terrorist-initiated catastrophes and to the failures and weaknesses of the government's response.&quot; Lustick alleged that the War on Terror is disconnected from the real but remote threat terrorism poses, and that the generalized War on Terror began as part of the justification for invading Iraq, but then took on a life of its own, fueled by media coverage.

contains many examples of controversies concerning mainstream reporting of the War on Terror. Cooper found that bloggers' criticisms of factual inaccuracies in news stories or bloggersâ discovery of the mainstream press's failure to adequately check facts before publication caused many news organizations to retract or change news stories.

[[David Barstow]] won the 2009 [[Pulitzer Prize for Investigative Reporting]] by connecting the Department of Defense to over 75 retired generals supporting the Iraq War on TV and radio networks. The Department of Defense recruited the retired generals to sell the war to the American public. Barstow also discovered undisclosed links between some retired generals and defense contractors. Barstow reported &quot;the Bush administration used its control over access of information in an effort to transform the analysts into a kind of media Trojan horse.&quot;
