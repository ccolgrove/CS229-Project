'''Charleroi-West''' ({{lang-fr|Charleroi-Ouest}}) is a secondary [[railway station]] serving [[Charleroi]], [[Belgium]]. It is one of two railway stations located in downtown Charleroi, the other one being the much larger [[Charleroi-South railway station]]. Charleroi-West is also a station of the [[Charleroi Pre-metro|Charleroi metro]].

==Rail station==

Charleroi-West is a small, unstaffed station with no building or other services of its own, served only by [[Belgian railway line 140]] linking Charleroi to [[Ottignies]]. Charleroi-West used to be a dead-end station (and thus the terminus of line 140) until 27 [[May]] [[1987]], when a rail connection to [[Charleroi-South railway station|Charleroi-South]] was opened. The 6&amp;nbsp;km industrial line 260 links Charleroi-Ouest with the freight [[classification yard]] of [[Monceau-sur-Sambre]].

Because of its proximity to [[Charleroi-South railway station|Charleroi-South]] and the limited train service, Charleroi-West sees very little passenger traffic, with a weekday average of 75 boarding passengers on weekdays (20 on Saturdays, 30 on Sundays) in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treintrambus.be/images/stories/reizigerstellingen_2007.pdf &quot;Comptages voyageurs 2007&quot;], ''SNCB/NMBS'', Brussels, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original station, inaugurated in [[1855]], was located slightly to the South.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charleroi-decouverte.be/index.php?id=143 &quot;Charleroi dÃ©couverte! | Rue du Grand Central&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The current station was built between [[1884]] and [[1886]].

West ({{lang-fr|Ouest}}) is a [[Charleroi Metro]] station, located at the western end of [[Charleroi]] downtown, in fare zone 1. The station is accessible through three distinct street entrances leading to a mezzanine, giving access to the central platform via escalators.

The station has been renovated in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;Marie Adam, [http://www.lalibre.be/actu/hainaut/article/478258/l-art-s-installe-dans-le-metro.html &quot;Lâart sâinstalle dans le mÃ©tro&quot;], ''La Libre'', Brussels, 29 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; with a new decoration based on works of local artist Charles Szymkowicz. The mezzanine level hosts 11 reproductions of Szymkowicz's watercolor paintings depicting [[Tuscany]] landscapes, made by Belgian ceramist Maurice Joly. One of the station entrances is adorned with a 3.5 x 4m fresco depicting Szymkowicz and his mother passing the so-called &quot;viaduct&quot; bridge where the station is now located.
