'''Culver City''' is a city in western [[Los Angeles County, California]].  As of the 2010 census, the city had a population of 38,883, up from 38,816 at the 2000 census. It is mostly surrounded by the city of [[Los Angeles]], but also shares a border with [[unincorporated area]]s of Los Angeles County. Culver City's mayor is Christopher Armenta.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlCulver City :: City Council Members&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.culvercity.org/council/council.asp?sec=gov |title=Culver City :: City Council Members |work= |accessdate=}}{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the years since the city was incorporated, over forty annexations of adjoining areas have occurred.  As a result the city now comprises approximately five square miles.

Since the 1920s, Culver City has been a significant center for [[motion picture]] and later television production, in part because it was the home of [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer|MGM Studios]]. It was also the headquarters for the [[Hughes Aircraft Company]] from 1932 to 1985. [[National Public Radio]] West and [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] now have headquarters in the city. The [[NFL Network]] studio is also based in Culver City.

=== Early History ===
The area of present day Culver City was the homeland of the [[Tongva people|Tongva-GabrieliÃ±o]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], who held a presence in the region for over 8,000 years.&lt;ref name=Culver&gt;{{cite book|last=Cerra|first=Julie Lugo|title=Culver City|publisher=Arcadia Publishing|year=2004|page=7|isbn=9780738528939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laokay.com/halac/RanchoLosEncinos.htm laokay: History of Rancho Los Encinos.] accessed 8/20/2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/discoveries/2006-03-03-prehistoric-mill_x.htm |title=Prehistoric milling site found in California |publisher=Usatoday.Com |date=2006-03-04 |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city was founded primarily on the lands of the former [[Rancho La Ballona]], [[Rancho Rincon de los Bueyes]], and [[Rancho La Cienega o Paso de la Tijera]].&lt;ref name=Culver/&gt;

=== Camp Latham ===
From 1861 to 1862, during the [[American Civil War]], ''Camp Latham'' was established by the [[1st California Infantry]] under Col. [[James H. Carleton]] and the [[1st California Cavalry]] under Lt. Col. [[Benjamin F. Davis]]. Camp Latham was named for California Senator [[Milton S. Latham]] and was the first staging area for the training of Union troops and their operations in [[Southern California]].  It was located on land of the Rancho La Ballona, on the South side of [[Ballona Creek]], near what is now the intersection of Jefferson and Overland Boulevards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~caehmduv/2006Events.htm |title=Camp Latham Marker Unveiling |publisher=Rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/FtMoore.html |title=The California State Military Museum, Historic California Posts: Fort Moore (Post at Los Angeles, Fort Hill and including Camp Fitzgerald), reprinted with permission from Colonel Herbert M.

=== Culver City ===
[[Harry Culver]]'s first attempt to establish Culver City was in 1913, and the city was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] on September 20, 1917. (His first ads read &quot;All roads lead to Culver City&quot; indicating a main transportation route via the city.&lt;ref name=Culver/&gt;)

The first film studio in Culver City was built by [[Thomas H. Ince|Thomas Ince]] in 1918. In the 1920s, [[silent film]] comedy producer [[Hal Roach]] and [[Metro Goldwyn Mayer]] (MGM) built studios there. During [[Prohibition]], [[speakeasies]] and nightclubs such as the [[Cotton Club]] lined [[Washington Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Washington Boulevard]].

=== Movie and television production ===

[[Image:MGM-studios-1922.jpg|thumb|left|[[MGM Studios]] (now [[Sony Pictures Studios]]), 1922.]]

Hundreds of movies have been produced on the lots of Culver City's studios: [[Sony Pictures Studios]] (originally MGM Studios), [[Culver Studios]], and the former [[Hal Roach Studios]]. These include ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'', ''[[The Thin Man (film)|The Thin Man]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Citizen Kane]]'', ''[[Rebecca (1940 film)|Rebecca]]'', the ''[[Tarzan]]'' series, and the original ''[[King Kong]]''. More recent films made in Culver City include ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'', ''[[Raging Bull]]'', ''[[E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial]]'', ''[[City Slickers]]'', ''[[Air Force One (film)|Air Force One]]'', ''[[Wag the Dog]]'', and ''[[Contact (film)|Contact]]''. Television shows made on Culver City sets have included ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', ''[[Gunsmoke]]'', ''[[Cougar Town]]'', ''[[Mad About You]]'', ''[[Lassie (1954 TV series)|Lassie]]'', ''[[Batman (TV series)|Batman]]'', ''[[Arrested Development (TV series)|Arrested Development]]'', ''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'', ''[[Jeopardy!]]'', ''[[The Nanny]]'', and the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version of ''[[Wheel of Fortune (U.S. game show)|Wheel of Fortune]]''.

[[John Travolta]]'s &quot;Stranded at the Drive-In&quot; sequence in ''Grease'' was filmed at the Studio Drive-In on the corner of Jefferson and Sepulveda. It served as a set for many other films, including ''[[Pee-wee's Big Adventure]]''. The theater was closed in 1993 and was demolished in 1998; it is now a housing subdivision featuring large homes on small lots, as well as being home to the [[Kayne-ERAS]] center, a school and community center for the disabled and mentally challenged.

[[Image:Culver City,1920.jpg|thumb|Downtown Culver City, about 1920]]
Culver City's streets have been featured in many films and television shows. Since much of the architecture has not changed in decades, particularly in residential areas of town, the nostalgic sitcom ''[[The Wonder Years]]'' set many of its outdoor scenes in the neighborhoods of Culver City. The 1970s show ''[[CHiPs]]'' also featured many chase scenes through the streets. The [[Nicolas Cage]] film ''[[Matchstick Men (film)|Matchstick Men]]'' included scenes made at Veterans Memorial Park, which was also featured in the opening scenes of the sitcom ''[[The Hogan Family]]''.

[[Image:Sonypicturesentertainmentoffices.jpg|thumb|right|Sony Pictures Plaza]]
''[[The Aviator (2004 film)|The Aviator]]'', a film about [[Howard Hughes]], featured several mentions of Culver City in connection with Hughes. The [[Hughes Aircraft|Hughes Aircraft Company plant]] had a Culver City mailing address but was actually in the adjacent [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] neighborhood of [[Westchester, Los Angeles, California|Westchester]] at a site now called [[Playa Vista, Los Angeles, California|Playa Vista]]. Scenes from ''[[Bewitched]]'' (2005) with [[Nicole Kidman]] and [[Will Farrell]] were also filmed in the Culver City streets.
The 2005 film, ''[[Fun with Dick and Jane]],'' starring [[Jim Carrey]] was filmed there.
The closing aerial sequence of ''[[Get Shorty (film)|Get Shorty]]'' (1995) starring [[John Travolta]] and [[Danny DeVito]] is also filmed in Culver City, at the [[Sony Studios]].

=== Decline of the studios (1960s and 1970s) ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2009}}
In the late 1960s, much of the [[MGM]] back lot acreage (lot 3 and other property on Jefferson Boulevard), and the nearby 28.5 ac (11.5 ha) of the somewhat inaccurately named [[RKO Forty Acres|&quot;back forty&quot;]], once owned by RKO Pictures and later Desilu Productions, were sold by their owners. In 1976, the sets were razed to make way for redevelopment. Today the &quot;back forty&quot; is the southern expansion of the Hayden Industrial Tract, while the MGM property has been converted to a subdivision and a shopping center known as Raintree Plaza.

=== Rebirth of downtown (1990s and 2000s) ===
[[Image:Culvercenterentrance.jpg|thumb|right|Culver Center]]
In the 1990s, Culver City launched a successful revitalization program in which it renovated its downtown as well as several shopping centers in the [[Sepulveda Boulevard]] corridor near [[Fox Hills Mall]]. Around the same time, the relocation of [[Sony]]'s motion picture operations (known as Columbia Pictures)&lt;ref&gt;According to http://www.culvercity.org/cityinfo/history/10202.html, Columbia Pictures was the subsidiary of Sony that moved into the old MGM lot. Retrieved August 3, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; to the former MGM studios at [[Washington Boulevard (Los Angeles)|Washington Boulevard]] and Overland Avenue brought much-needed jobs to the city.

The influx of many art galleries and restaurants to the eastern part of the city, formally designated as the Culver City Art District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Culver City Art District|url=http://www.ccgalleryguide.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; prompted ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 2007 to praise the new art scene and call Culver City a &quot;nascent [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]].&quot;

== Transportation ==

The first phase of the [[Expo Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Expo line]], a [[light rail]] line from Downtown Los Angeles to a terminal station at the Culver Junction near Venice and Robertson Boulevards in Culver City started in 2006, with an estimated completion date in 2012. The line mostly follows the right-of-way the [[Pacific Electric]] [[Santa Monica Air Line (Pacific Electric)|Santa Monica Air Line]] used. The intent of the [[Los Angeles Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] is that the line eventually be extended westward to [[Santa Monica]], again mostly along the existing right of way.

[[Culver City Bus]] currently operates bus service within Culver City.&lt;ref name=&quot;urlmetro.net | Transit Services and Information for Los Angeles County&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mta.net/projects_plans/exposition/default.htm |title=metro.net | Transit Services and Information for Los Angeles County |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city is served by the [[Los Angeles International Airport]], which is located about {{convert|7|mi|km}} south of the city.
