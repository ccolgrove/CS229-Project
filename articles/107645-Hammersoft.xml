[[Image:La Puente Valley Women's Club.JPG|thumb|left|200px|La Puente Valley Women's Club is listed on the National Register of Historic Sites]]
In 1769, the [[Gaspar de PortolÃ ]] expedition (the first [[Europe]]an exploration party in the [[Los Angeles]] area), along with Father [[JunÃ­pero Serra]], built a bridge over the [[San Jose Creek (California)|San Jose Creek]].  In 1884, the area was named ''Puente'' (''bridge'' in Spanish; in old Spanish the noun was often feminine,&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://buscon.rae.es/draeI/SrvltConsulta?TIPO_BUS=3&amp;LEMA=puente Diccionario de la Real AcadÃ©mia EspaÃ±ola].&quot; Online edition.&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to modern Spanish ''el puente'').  The community began in 1841 when [[John A. Rowland|John Rowland]] and [[Workman-Temple family|William Workman]] were granted the {{convert|48000|acre|km2|sing=on}} [[Rancho La Puente]].

The area was known for its fruit and [[walnut]] groves during the 1930s.  The city was even home to the world's largest walnut packing plant.
