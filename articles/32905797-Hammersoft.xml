'''Parc''' is a [[Charleroi Metro]] station, located in downtown [[Charleroi]], in fare zone 1. It is an underground station featuring a central platform, with street access at both ends.

Interior decoration, themed around the [[Lucky Luke]] [[Belgian comics]] character, features a fresco of the comics main characters on one side, and a short comics strip depicting a train attack by the [[The Daltons (Lucky Luke)|Daltons]] on the other side. There's also a Lucky Luke statue outside of the station, near the park's eastern entrance.

Parc is a dead-end station (terminus of lines [[Charleroi Metro line 55|55]] and [[Charleroi Metro line 88|88]]), where trams arrive from [[Janson (Charleroi Pre-metro station)|Janson]] on the western side of the central platform, then park in a short tunnel section south of the station, before coming back in the station for departure on the eastern side of the platform. Parc will no longer be a terminus when current works to finish the downtown loop are completed.

The station name (French for ''Park'') comes from the adjacent municipal park.
