'''DVD-Video''' is a consumer video format used to store digital video on [[DVD]] discs, and is currently the dominant consumer video format in [[Asia]], [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Anna | last=Bakalis | title = It's unreel: DVD rentals overtake videocassettes | publisher = [[Washington Times]] | date = 2003-06-20 | url = http://washingtontimes.com/business/20030620-113258-1104r.htm | accessdate = 2006-12-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Europe]], and [[Australia]]. Discs using the DVD-Video specification require a DVD drive and a [[MPEG-2]] decoder (e.g., a DVD player, or a computer DVD drive with a software DVD player). Commercial DVD movies are encoded using a combination of MPEG-2 compressed video and audio of varying formats (often multi-channel formats as described below). Typically, the data rate for DVD movies ranges from 3&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] to 9.5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, and the [[bit rate]] is usually adaptive. It was first available for retail around 1997.

The DVD-Video specification was created by [[DVD Forum]] and can be obtained from DVD Format/Logo Licensing Corporation for a fee of $5,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdbook-subscribe&quot;&gt;DVD FLLC (2009) [http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/format/f_nosbsc.html DVD Format Book], Retrieved on 2009-08-14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DVD FLLC (2009) [http://www.dvdfllc.co.jp/license/l_howto.html How To Obtain DVD Format/Logo License (2005-2009)], Retrieved on 2009-08-14&lt;/ref&gt; The specification is not publicly available, because every subscriber must sign a [[non-disclosure agreement]]. Certain information in the DVD Book is proprietary and confidential.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvdbook-subscribe&quot; /&gt;

==Frame size and frame rate==
To record moving pictures, DVD-Video uses either [[MPEG-2]] compression at up to 9.8&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]] (9,800&amp;nbsp;[[kbit/s]]) or [[MPEG-1]] compression at up to 1.856&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s (1,856&amp;nbsp;kbit/s).

The following formats are allowed for MPEG-2 video&lt;ref name=&quot;videohelp&quot;&gt;{{cite_web| url=http://www.videohelp.com/dvd| title=What is DVD?| publisher=Videohelp.com| accessdate=2011-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;:
* At 25&amp;nbsp;[[frames per second]] (commonly used in regions with [[576i|50&amp;nbsp;Hz image scanning]] frequency):
: 720 Ã 576 pixels (same resolution as [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]])
: 704 Ã 576 pixels
: 352 Ã 576 pixels (same as the [[China Video Disc]] standard)
: 352 x 288 pixels

* At 29.97&amp;nbsp;frames per second (commonly used in regions with [[480i|60&amp;nbsp;Hz image scanning]] frequency):
: 720 Ã 480 pixels (same resolution as [[D-1 (Sony)|D-1]])
: 704 Ã 480 pixels
: 352 Ã 480 pixels (same as the [[China Video Disc]] standard)
: 352 x 240 pixels

The following formats are allowed for MPEG-1 video:
* 352 Ã 288 pixels at 25&amp;nbsp;frame/s, [[Progressive scan|progressive]] (Same as the [[Video cd|VCD]] Standard)
* 352 Ã 240 pixels at 29.97&amp;nbsp;frame/s, progressive (Same as the [[Video cd|VCD]] Standard)

Video with [[4:3]] frame aspect ratio is supported in all video modes. [[anamorphic DVD|Widescreen]] video is supported only in full D1 resolutions.

MPEG-1 formats do not support interlaced video; content must be progressive-scan only. MPEG-2 formats support both interlaced and progressive-scan content.

MPEG-2 also supports numerous video stream flags, used to note scan type, field order, and other effects.  In particular, this allows the encoding of 23.976 frame per second video using [[Telecine#Frame rate differences|pulldown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite_web| url=http://www.zerocut.com/tech/pulldown.html| title=Pulldown Explained| author=Alan Stewart| accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because MPEG-1 video lacks these flags, it cannot be used to encode 23.976 frame/s content for DVD-Video.

MPEG-2 video flags also have numerous additional uses. A DVD player uses these flags to convert progressive content into interlaced video suitable for interlaced TV sets. These flags also help reproducing progressive content on progressive-scan television sets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/the-dvd-benchmark/177-dvd-benchmark-part-5-progressive-scan-dvd.html Home Theater High Fidelity: DVD Benchmark - Part 5 - Progressive Scan DVD]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hometheaterhifi.com/volume_9_2/mrg-87-june-2002.html#A%20Beautiful%20Mind Home Theater High Fidelity: A Beautiful Mind, review]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audio data==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:DVD Video (File structure).png|250px|thumb|right|Contents of a video DVD as seen in [[Microsoft Windows]].]] --&gt;

The audio data on a DVD movie can be [[Pulse-code modulation|PCM]], [[Digital Theatre System|DTS]], [[MPEG-1 Audio Layer II]] (MP2), or [[Dolby Digital]] (AC-3) format. In countries using the [[PAL]] system standard DVD-Video releases must contain at least one audio track using the PCM, MP2, or AC-3 format, and all standard PAL players must support all three of these formats. A similar standard exists in countries using the [[NTSC]] system, though with no requirement mandating the use of or support for the MP2 format. DTS audio is optional for all players, as DTS was not part of the initial draft standard and was added later; thus, many early players are unable to play DTS audio tracks. The vast majority of commercial DVD-Video releases today employ [[Dolby Digital|AC-3]] audio.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} The official allowed formats for the audio tracks on a DVD Video are:
* PCM: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 16 bit or 24 bit [[Linear PCM]], 2 to 6 channels, up to 6,144 kbit/s. N.B. 16-bit 48&amp;nbsp;kHz 8 channel PCM is allowed by the DVD-Video specification but is not well-supported by authoring applications or players.
* AC-3: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 1 to 5.1 (6) channels, up to 640&amp;nbsp;kbit/s
* DTS: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz or 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 2 to 6.1 channels, Half Rate (768&amp;nbsp;kbit/s) or Full Rate (1,536&amp;nbsp;kbit/s)
* MP2: 48&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate, 1 to [[MPEG Multichannel|7.1 channels]], up to 912&amp;nbsp;kbit/s

DVDs can contain more than one channel of audio to go together with the video content, supporting a maximum of 8 simultaneous audio tracks per video. This is most commonly used for different audio formatsâDTS 5.1, AC-3 2.0 etc.âas well as for commentary and audio tracks in different languages.

==Data rate==
DVD-Video discs have a raw bitrate of 11.08&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, with a 1.0&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s overhead, leaving a payload bitrate of 10.08&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s. Of this, up to 3.36 Mbit/s can be used for subtitles and a maximum of 9.80 Mbit/s can be split amongst audio and video. In the case of multiple angles the data is stored interleaved, and so there's a bitrate penalty leading to a max bitrate of 8 Mbit/s per angle to compensate for additional seek time. This limit is not cumulative, so each additional angle can still have up to 8 Mbit/s of bitrate available.

Professionally encoded videos average a bitrate of 4-5&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s with a maximum of 7â8&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s in high-action scenes. This is typically done to allow greater compatibility amongst players, and to help prevent [[buffer underrun]]s in the case of dirty or scratched discs.

[[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment]] has created a line of DVDs (dubbed &quot;[[Superbit]]&quot;) aiming to maximize picture quality by eliminating multiple languages, angles, and audio tracks. This allows average bitrates closer to 6&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.

==Other features==
Some DVD hardware or software players may play discs whose MPEG files do not conform to the above standards; commonly this is used to support discs authored with formats such as [[Video CD|VCD]] and [[Super Video CD|SVCD]]. While VCD and [[China Video Disc|CVD]] video is supported by the DVD standard, neither SVCD video nor VCD, CVD, or SVCD audio is compatible with the DVD standard.

Some hardware players will also play DVD-ROMs or [[CD-ROM]]s containing &quot;raw&quot; MPEG video files; these are &quot;unauthored&quot; and lack the [[Computer file|file]] and header structure that defines DVD-Video. Standard DVD-Video files contain extra information (such as the number of video tracks, chapters and links to extra features) that DVD players use to navigate the disc.

The maximum chapters allowed per title is 99 and the maximum titles allowed per DVD is 99.

===Filesystem===
Almost all DVD-Video discs use the ''UDF bridge'' format, which is a combination of the DVD MicroUDF (a subset of [[Universal Disc Format|UDF]] 1.02) and [[ISO 9660]] file systems.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd-books-overview&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;demystified&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.2 |title=DVD Demystified - What are the features and speeds of DVD drives? |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/creating-dvds.html#AEN23376 |title=FreeBSD Handbook - Burning a DVD-Video |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The UDF bridge format provides backwards compatibility for operating systems that support only ISO 9660.&lt;ref name=&quot;demystified&quot; /&gt; Most (and new) DVD players read the UDF filesystem from a DVD-Video disc and ignore the ISO9660 filesystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cdburnerxp.se/help/Appendices/filesystem |title=CDBurnerXP help - File System |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Directory and file structure===
A DVD volume for the DVD-Video format has the following structure of directories and files:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/ifo.html |title=DVD-Video Information - Video Manager and Video Title Set IFO file headers |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.manifest-tech.com/links/dvd_terms.htm |title=DVD Authoring Terminology |author=Douglas Dixon |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifoedit.com/dvdfiles.html |title=IfoEdit Guides - What files are contained on a DVD? |author=Decision Developments |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:DVD-Video Layout.svg|thumb|alt=Layout of files for DVD-Video|Layout of files for DVD-Video]]

* AUDIO_TS directory: empty or not present on DVD-Video discs; contains files only on [[DVD Audio]] discs; a.k.a. Audio Title Sets directory; included on DVD-Video discs for compatibility reasons
* VIDEO_TS directory: stores all data for the DVD-Video; a.k.a. Video Title Sets directory. This directory is required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc.
* ''Video Manager (VMG) files:''
** VIDEO_TS.IFO file: the Video Manager (VMG) information file â stores control and playback information for the entire DVD â e.g. the First Play PGC (Program Chain),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/vmgfp.php |title=First-Play PGC |author=DVD-Replica Media |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; locations of all Video Title Sets (VTS), table of titles, number of volumes, domains for multiple languages and regional and parental control settings, information about subtitles, audio tracks, etc. This file is required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/vmgguide.php |title=DVD Video Manager (VMG) |author=DVD-Replica Media |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** VIDEO_TS.BUP file: the backup copy of the VIDEO_TS.IFO file. It is part of Video Manager (VMG).
** VIDEO_TS.VOB file: the first-play Video Object of the DVD-Video disc, usually a copyright notice or a menu. It is part of Video Manager (VMG). This file is not required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc.
* ''Video Title Set (VTS) files:''
** VTS_01_0.IFO file: stores control and playback information for the Video Title Set 01 â e.g. information about chapters, subtitles and audio tracks. A &quot;VTS_zz_0.IFO&quot; file (where &quot;zz&quot; is from 01 to 99) is required to be present on each VTS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/vtsguide.php |title=Video Title Set (VTS) |author=DVD-Replica Media |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** VTS_01_0.BUP file: a backup copy of the VTS_01_0.IFO file. This file is required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc. It is part of Video Title Set (VTS).
** VTS_01_0.VOB file: Video Title Set 01, Video Object 0, contains the menu for this title. This file is not required to be present on a DVD-compliant disc.
** VTS_01_1.VOB file: Video Title Set 01, Video Object 1, contains the video for this title. At least one file &quot;VTS_zz_1.VOB&quot; is required in the VTS and each &quot;VTS_zz_x&quot;. DVD-Video can contain up to 99 (1â99) titles with max 10 (0â9) VOB files each. The last possible VOB file is VTS_99_9.VOB.
** ... etc.

[[IFO]] files store control and playback information â e.g. information about chapters, subtitles and audio tracks. They do not store any video or audio data or subtitles.

[[BUP]] files are only backups of the IFO files.

====Domains====
Data structures recorded on a DVD-compliant disc are components of one of the four data groups called domains:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvd-replica.com/DVD/domains.php |title=Domains and System Space |author=DVD-Replica Media |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpucoder.com/Muxman/mxp/pgc.shtml |title=Muxman MXP files - PGC Object |author=MPUCoder |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.matroska.org/technical/specs/chapters/index.html |title=Menu features - DVD menu |author=Matroska |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mediachance.com/dvdlab/Helppro/vts.htm |title=VTS, VMG and other stuff |author=Mediachance |accessdate=2011-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First-play (FP) â First Play PGC located in the VIDEO_TS.IFO file
* Video Manager (VMG) â contains VIDEO_TS.IFO, VIDEO_TS.BUP and VIDEO_TS.VOB
* Video Title Set (VTS) â contains &quot;VTS_zz_x.IFO&quot;, &quot;VTS_zz_x.BUP&quot; and &quot;VTS_zz_x.VOB&quot; files (where &quot;x&quot; is from 1 to 9)
* Video Title Set Menu (VTSM) â uses &quot;VTS_zz_0.VOB&quot; files

===Container===
{{Main|VOB}}
Video, audio, subtitle and navigation streams are [[multiplexed]] and stored on a DVD-Video disc in the [[VOB]] [[container format (digital)|container format]] (Video Object). VOB is based on the [[MPEG program stream]] format, but with additional limitations and specifications in the private streams.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatisvob&quot;&gt;[http://www.mpucoder.com/DVD/vobov.html What is a VOB file], Retrieved on 2009-07-26&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mpeg-dvd&quot;&gt;[http://dvd.sourceforge.net/dvdinfo/dvdmpeg.html DVD - MPeg differences], Retrieved on 2009-07-24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dvdpro.com/dvd.htm |title=Is it easy to understand DVD format? |accessdate=2011-02-26 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20011024182535/http://dvdpro.com/dvd.htm |archivedate=2001-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The MPEG program stream has provisions for non-standard data (as AC-3, DTS, LPCM or subtitles used in VOB files) in the form of so-called private streams. VOB files are a very strict subset of the MPEG program stream standard. While all VOB files are MPEG program streams, not all MPEG program streams comply with the definition for a VOB file.&lt;ref name=&quot;whatisvob&quot; /&gt;

[[DVD recorder]]s can use [[DVD-VR]] or [[DVD+VR]] format instead of DVD-Video. DVD-VR format store multiplexed audiovisual content in VRO containers.&lt;ref name=&quot;VRO&quot;&gt;DVD Demystified (July 13, 2009) [http://dvddemystified.com/dvdfaq.html#4.10 What are .IFO, .VOB, .AOB, and .VRO files? How can I play them?], Retrieved on 2009-07-28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Doom9's forum (2002-2005) [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=15908 DVD-RAM *.VRO File Conversion], Retrieved on 2009-07-28&lt;/ref&gt; VRO file is an equivalent to a collection of DVD-Video VOB files.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pixelbeat.org/docs/DVD-VR/ DVD-VR Application format notes], Retrieved on 2009-07-28&lt;/ref&gt; Fragmented VRO files are not widely supported by hardware or software players and video editing software.&lt;ref name=&quot;VRO&quot; /&gt; DVD+VR standard defines a logical format for DVD-Video compliant recording on optical discs and is commonly used on DVD+R/RW media.
{{See also|DVD-VR|DVD+VR}}

===Subtitles===
DVD Video may also include up to 32 [[subtitle (captioning)|subtitle]] or ''subpicture'' tracks. Subtitles are usually intended as a visual help for the [[deaf]] and [[hearing impaired]] and for translating dialogs.

Subtitles can serve other purposes as well. For example, in the DVD release of ''[[Thirteen Days (film)|Thirteen Days]]'' one of the subtitle tracks includes history notes, giving additional information timed to the events depicted in the film. In the release of ''[[For All Mankind]]'' subtitles display names of the NASA missions and names of the people shown on the screen.

Subtitles are stored as [[bitmap]] images and therefore can contain messages in any language. Subtitles are restricted to four colors, including transparent &quot;color&quot;, and thus tend to look cruder than permanent subtitles on film.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sonic.com/products/Consumer/CinePlayer/Technology/variability.aspx CinePlayer Variability], Sonic.&lt;/ref&gt; Transparency allows laying subtitles over the video during playback.&lt;ref name=&quot;dvd-subtitles&quot;&gt;MPEG.org (July 21, 1996) [http://www.mpeg.org/MPEG/DVD/Book_B/Subpic.html DVD Technical Notes - Subpictures], Retrieved on 2009-07-24&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle tracks are contained within the [[VOB]] file of the DVD. 

DVD Video may also contain [[closed captioning]] material which can only be viewed on a television set with a decoder.

===Chapters and angles===
DVD Video may contain chapters for easy navigation (and continuation of a partially watched film). If space permits, it is also possible to include several versions (called &quot;angles&quot;) of certain scenes, though today this feature is mostly used&amp;mdash;if at all&amp;mdash;not to show different angles of the action, but as part of internationalization to, for example, show different language versions of images containing written text, if subtitles will not do (e.g., the Queen's spell book in ''[[Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937 film)|Snow White]]'', and the scrolling text in the openings of the ''[[Star Wars]]'' films). Multiple angles have found a niche in markets such as [[yoga]] and [[erotica]].

===Extra features===
A significant selling point of DVD Video is that the storage capacity allows for a wide variety of extra, or bonus, features in addition to the feature film. These extra features can include [[audio commentary (DVD)|audio commentary]]; [[Documentary film|documentary]] features, commonly about the making of the main title; [[deleted scene]]s; photo galleries; [[storyboards]]; isolated [[film score|music scores]]; trivia text commentary; simple games; [[film short]]s; [[TV spots]]; [[radio spots]]; [[movie trailers|theatrical trailers]] which were used to promote the main title; and [[teaser trailer]]s advertising related movies or DVDs.

Extra features often provide entertainment or add depth and understanding to the film.  Games, bloopers, and galleries provide entertainment, especially for younger ages.  Deleted scenes and alternative endings allow the audience to view additional content which was not included in a theatrical release. Directors cuts allow the audience to see how the director envisioned the main title without the constraints which are placed on a theatrical release.

Other extras that can be included on DVDs are motion menus, still pictures, up to 32 selectable subtitles, [[seamless branching]] for multiple storylines, up to 9 camera angles, and [[DVD-ROM]] / data files that can be accessed on a computer.

Extra features require additional storage space, which often means encoding the main title with lower than possible data rate to fit both the main title and the extras on one disc. Lower data rate may decrease visual and sound quality, which manifests itself in various [[digital artifact]]s. To maintain quality the main title and the extras may be released on several discs, or the extras may be omitted completely like in the &quot;[[Superbit]]&quot; line of DVDs.

==Restrictions==
DVD-Video has four complementary systems designed to restrict the DVD user in various ways: [[Macrovision]], [[Content Scramble System]] (CSS), [[regional lockout|region codes]], and [[User operation prohibition|disabled user operations]] (UOPs). There are also anti-ripping techniques intended to foil [[DVD ripper|ripping software]].

===Content Scramble System===
Many DVD-Video titles use Content Scramble System (CSS) encryption, which is intended to discourage people from copying the disc. Usually, users need to install software provided on the DVD or downloaded from the Internet such as [[MPlayer]], [[Arcsoft TotalMedia Theatre|TotalMedia Theatre]], [[PowerDVD]], [[VLC media player|VLC]] or [[WinDVD]] to be able to view the disc in a computer system.

CSS does not make it more difficult (anymore) to copy the digital content now that a decoder ([[DeCSS]]) has been released, nor possible to distinguish between legal and illegal copies of a work, but it does restrict the playback software that may be used.

CSS has caused major problems for the inclusion of DVD players in any [[open source]] operating systems, since open source player implementations are not officially given access to the decryption keys or license to the [[patent]]s involved in CSS. [[Proprietary software]] players were also difficult to find on some platforms. However, a successful effort has been made to write a decoder by [[reverse engineering]], resulting in [[DeCSS]]. This has led to long-running legal battles and the arrest of some of those involved in creating or distributing the DeCSS code,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; through the use of the controversial U.S. [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] (DMCA), on the grounds that such software could also be used to facilitate unauthorized copying of the data on the discs. The [[Videolan]] team, however, went on to make the [[libdvdcss]] library. Unlike DeCSS, libdvdcss can access a CSS-encypted DVD without the need of a cracked key, thus enabling playback of such discs on opensource players without legal restraints (although DVD rippers using this library may still be subject to restrictions).

The DMCA currently affects only the [[United States]], however many other countries are signatories to the similar [[World Intellectual Property Organization Copyright Treaty|WIPO Treaty]]. In some countries it is not illegal to use de-scrambling software to bypass the DVD restrictions. A [[List of video players (software)|number of software programs]] have since appeared on the Web to view DVDs on a number of different platforms.

Other measures such as anti-ripping, as well as U.S. and non-U.S. [[copyright]] law, may be used to prevent making unauthorized copies of DVDs. CSS decrypting software, or ripping software, such as [[DVD Decrypter]], [[AnyDVD]], [[MacTheRipper]], and [[DVD Shrink]] allows a disc to be copied to hard disk unscrambled. Some DeCSS applications also remove [[Macrovision]], [[regional lockout|region codes]], and disabled user operations (UOPs).

===Anti-ripping===
After DeCSS ripping software became available, companies developed techniques to introduce errors in DVD-Video discs that do not normally affect playback and navigation of a disc, but can cause problems in software that attempts to copy the entire disc. These approaches, which are not part of the official DVD-Video specification, include Sony [[ARccOS Protection]], Macrovision [[Macrovision#RipGuard|RipGuard]], [[X-protect]], ProtectDisc [[SecureBurn]], Anaho,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anahoproductions.com Anaho]&lt;/ref&gt; Fortium, and others. All of these methods have been circumvented (as might have been expected, since all standard DVD players naturally circumvent them to play and navigate the discs normally).  [[Riplock]] is a feature that reduces drive noise during playback but inadvertently reduces ripping speed.

===Disabled user operations===
{{main|User operation prohibition}}
DVD-Video allows the disc to specify whether or not the user may perform any operation, such as selecting a menu, skipping chapters, forwarding or rewinding&amp;mdash;essentially any function on the remote control. This is known as User Operation Prohibitions, or Prohibited User Operations (UOPs or PUOs). Most DVD players respect these commands (e.g., by preventing skipping or fast-forwarding through a copyright message or an advertisement at the beginning of a disc). However, [[grey market]] players ignore UOPs and some DVD &quot;re-authoring&quot; software packages allow the user to produce a copy without these restrictions. The legality of these activities varies by jurisdiction and is the subject of debate. (See [[fair use]].)

===Region codes===
{{main|DVD region code}}
[[Image:DVD-Regions with key-2.svg|thumb|right|300px|DVD region codes across the world]]
Each DVD-Video disc contains one or more '''region codes''', denoting the area(s) of the world in which distribution and playback are intended. The commercial DVD player specification dictates that a player must only play discs that contain its region code. In theory, this allows the motion picture studios to control the various aspects of a release (including content, date and price) on a region-by-region basis, or ensure the success of &quot;staggered&quot; or delayed cinema releases from country to country. For example, the British movie ''[[28 Days Later]]'' was released on DVD in Europe several months prior to the film's release in North American movie theaters. Regional coding kept the European DVD unplayable for most North American consumers, thereby ensuring that ticket sales would be relatively unaffected. &lt;!-- Not a good example because the British DVD would be in PAL format, so most US consumers would not be able to use it in any event, regardless of region-encoding. --&gt;

In practice, many DVD players allow playback of any disc, or can be modified to do so. Entirely independent of encryption, region coding pertains to [[regional lockout]], which originated in the [[video game]] industry.

From a worldwide perspective regional coding may be seen as a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Paul | last=Rubens | title = Border controls crumble in DVD land | publisher = [[BBC News]] | date = 2002-08-19 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/in_depth/sci_tech/2000/dot_life/2197548.stm | accessdate = 2007-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; A huge percentage of players outside of North America can be easily modified (and are even sold pre-modified by mainstream stores such as Amazon.co.uk) to ignore the regional codes on a disc. This, coupled with the fact that almost all televisions in Europe and [[Australasia]] are capable of displaying NTSC video (at the very least, in black and white), means that consumers in these regions have a huge choice of discs. Contrary to popular belief, this practice is not illegal and in some countries that strongly support free trade it is encouraged.

A normal DVD player can only play region-coded discs designated for the player's own particular region. However, a code-free or region-free DVD player is capable of playing DVDs from any of the six regions around the world.

The [[Content Scramble System|CSS]] license prohibits manufacturing of DVD players that are not set to a single region by default. While the same license prohibits manufacturers from including prominent interfaces to change the region setting it does not clearly prevent them from including &quot;hidden&quot; menus that enable the player's region to be changed; as such, many high-end models in the U.S. include password-protected or otherwise hidden methods to enable multi-region playback. Conversely in the UK and Ireland many cheap DVD players are multi-region while more expensive systems, including the majority of [[home cinema]] systems, are preset to play only region 2 discs.

In China, DVD-Videos for [[television series]] are usually released in MPEG-1 video, with MP2 audio.  By forgoing Dolby standards, manufacturers cut costs considerably; encoding in lower bit-rates also allows a TV series to be squeezed onto fewer discs.  There are no region coding in such cases.

There are also two additional region codes, region 7, which is reserved, and region 8, which is used exclusively for passenger transport such as airlines and cruise ships.

==Programming interface==
A [[virtual machine]] implemented by the DVD player runs [[bytecode]] contained on the DVD. This is used to control playback and display special effects on the menus. The [[instruction set]] is called the Virtual Machine (VM) DVD command set. There are 16 general parameter registers (GPRM) to hold temporary values and 24 system parameters (SPRM). As a result of a moderately flexible programming interface, DVD players can be used to play games, such as the DVD re-release of ''[[Dragon's Lair]]'', along with more sophisticated and advanced games such as ''[[Scene It]]'', all of which can be run on standard DVD players.

== Players and recorders ==
{{Main|DVD player|DVD recorder}}
Modern [[DVD recorder]]s often support additional formats, including DVD+/-R/RW, CD-R/RW, [[MP3]], [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]], [[Super Video CD|SVCD]], [[JPEG]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], [[Scalable Vector Graphics|SVG]], [[Karaoke|KAR]] and [[MPEG-4]] ([[DivX]]/[[Xvid]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdrecorderworld.com/articles/choosing_a_dvd_recorder.php|title=DVD Recorder Formats dvdrecorderworld.com|accessdate=2007-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some also include [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] ports or [[flash memory]] readers. Player prices range from as low as [[United States dollar|US$]]20 ([[Pound sterling|GBÂ£]]10){{Citation needed|reason=July 9, 2008|reason=Amazon is hardly an authoritative source and these prices do not match the source quoted anyway|date=July 2008}} to as high as US$2,700 (GBÂ£1,350).{{Citation needed|reason=July 9, 2008|reason=Amazon is hardly an authoritative source and these prices do not match the source quoted anyway|date=July 2008}}

DVD drives for computers usually come with one of two kinds of [[Regional Playback Control]] (RPC), either RPC-1 or RPC-2. This is used to enforce the publisher's restrictions on what regions of the world the DVD can be played. (See [[Regional lockout]] and [[DVD region code]]s.) While [[Open source]] software DVD players allow everything, commercial ones (both standalone models and software players) come further encumbered with restrictions forbidding the viewer from skipping (or in some cases fast-forwarding) certain content such as copyright warnings or advertisements. (See [[User operation prohibition]].)

Video game systems with DVD-Video playback functionality are [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[Xbox]] (additional remote required), [[Xbox 360]], [[Panasonic Q]], and [[Wii]] (with an unsupported hack).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&lt;!-- In progress and all that jazz --&gt;
In April 2000, Sonic Solutions and Ravisent announced hDVD, a [[High-definition video|high-definition]] extension to DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On November 18, 2003, the Chinese news agency [[Xinhua News Agency|Xinhua]] reported the final standard of the Chinese government-sponsored [[Enhanced Versatile Disc]] (EVD) which is another extension of standard DVD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD===
{{ See also|High definition optical disc format war }} 
Two competing high-definition (HD) optical-disc formats, [[HD DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]], were introduced in 2006. The HD DVD format, promoted by Toshiba, had the backing by the [[DVD Forum]], which voted to make it the official successor to DVD. Opposing HD DVD was the Blu-ray format, led by the [[Blu-ray Disc Association]], which shares many of the same members. 

Despite HD DVD's slight market lead and earlier introduction to the retail market (March 2006 vs June 2006), both formats engaged in a brief [[format war]]. Industry analysts likened the situation to the [[Videotape format war|VHS/Betamax format war]] of the 1980s. But this time, consumer awareness of either high-definition format was severely limited, with the end result that most consumers avoided both formats, already content with DVD. Toshiba capitulated in February 2008, citing low demand for HD DVD and the faster growth of Blu-ray, among other reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=E-commerce and VÃ­deo Distribution:DVD and Blu-ray |url=http://ecommerceandvideodistributiondvd.blogspot.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toshiba ended production of their HD DVD players and discontinued promotion of the format, while the HD DVD movie release schedule concluded by June 2008. 

As of February 2009, Blu-ray disc is the ''de facto'' high-definition optical disc format. However, sales figures suggest DVD is in no immediate danger of disappearing. Until households acquire high-definition-capable displays, they have no reason to switch to Blu-ray (other than more data capacity and less disc scratching), while households which are already equipped with HD-capable displays overwhelmingly have access to competing sources of HD video, from traditional subscription-based cable or satellite TV, to the fast growing market of Internet-hosted video-download services.

All standard DVDs will play on existing Blu-ray players, making the switch to Blu-ray much easier than the switch from VHS to DVD.  In addition, a growing number of hardware vendors are enhancing their Blu-ray players with Internet connectivity for subscription-based video downloads.

===CBHD===
{{main|China Blue High-definition Disc }}
China Blue High-definition Disc (CBHD) was introduced in September 2007. This format is based on [[HD DVD]]. While the Blu-ray format is marketed internationally, CBHDs have sold significantly in the Chinese market.
