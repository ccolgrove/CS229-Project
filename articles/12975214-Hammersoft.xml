=== Season overview ===

The [[1980 college football season]] was the [[Florida Gators football]] team's second season under new [[head coach]] [[Charley Pell|Charles B. &quot;Charley&quot; Pell]], and marked a remarkable one-year turnaround for the Gators from their 0&amp;ndash;10&amp;ndash;1 record in [[1979 Florida Gators football team|1979]].&lt;ref name=carlson9596&gt;Norm Carlson, ''University of Florida Football Vault: The History of the Florida Gators'', Whitman Publishing, LLC, Atlanta, Georgia, pp. 95&amp;ndash;96 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;  The winless 1979 season was the worst season in Gators history, and it was Pell's first campaign as the new head coach of the Gators, after the Gators' previous head coach, [[Doug Dickey]], was fired in the aftermath of a 4&amp;ndash;7 season in [[1978 Florida Gators football team|1978]].&lt;ref name=carlson9596/&gt;  Pell's 1980 Florida Gators posted an 8&amp;ndash;4 overall record and a [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) record of 4&amp;ndash;2, tying for fourth place in the ten-team SEC.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide&gt;''[http://web.gatorzone.com/football/media/2011/media_guide.pdf  2011 Florida Gators Football Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 116&amp;ndash;125 (2011).  Retrieved August 17, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Gators capped their season with a 35&amp;ndash;20 bowl victory over the [[Maryland Terrapins football|Maryland Terrapins]] in the [[Capital One Bowl|Tangerine Bowl]], marking the first time in the history of major college football that a winless team received a bowl bid the following season.&lt;ref name=carlson9596/&gt;

=== Season overview ===

The [[1984 college football season]] was [[Charley Pell]]'s sixth and last as the [[head coach]] of the [[Florida Gators football]] team; after the third game of the season, Pell was replaced as the Gators' head coach by his new [[offensive coordinator]], [[Galen Hall]].  After the Gators began the season as a 1&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 team under Pell, Hall's 1984 Florida Gators posted a 9&amp;ndash;1&amp;ndash;1 overall record and a [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC) record of 5&amp;ndash;0&amp;ndash;1 (8&amp;ndash;0&amp;ndash;0 and 4&amp;ndash;0&amp;ndash;0, respectively, under Hall), finishing first among ten SEC teams,&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt; and were recognized as the SEC champions.  The Gators finished third in both the [[Associated Press]] Poll and Coaches Poll, and were also named national champions by twenty-two publications including ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Sporting News]]''.

On May 30, 1985, the presidents of the ten SEC-member universities voted 6&amp;ndash;4 to vacate the Gators' 1984 SEC title and declared the team ineligible for the SEC championship during the upcoming 1985 and 1986 seasons because of the rule violations committed under Pell.  The retroactive vacating of the 1984 championship, six months after the 1984 football season ended, drew an angry response from University of Florida president [[Marshall Criser]], as well as Gators coaches, players and fans due to the retroactive nature of the decision and its perceived unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, &quot;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=KGkeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ycgEAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=1984%20sec%20title%20florida%20hall%20vacate%20football&amp;pg=4222%2C7996257  SEC Presidents swipe Florida of football title],&quot; ''Times Daily'', p. 5B (May 31, 1985).
