The '''Electronic Frontier Foundation''' ('''EFF''') is an international [[non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[digital rights]] [[advocacy organization|advocacy]] and legal organization based in the [[United States]]. Its stated mission is to:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |title=Electronic Frontier Foundation Mission Statement|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Engage in and support educational activities which increase popular understanding of the opportunities and challenges posed by developments in [[computing]] and [[telecommunications]].
* Develop among policy-makers a better understanding of the issues underlying free and open telecommunications, and support the creation of legal and structural approaches which will ease the assimilation of these new technologies by society.
* Raise public awareness about [[civil liberties]] issues arising from the rapid advancement in the area of new computer-based [[media (communication)|communications media]].
* Support litigation in the public interest to preserve, protect, and extend [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] rights within the realm of computing and telecommunications technology.
* Encourage and support the development of new tools which will endow non-technical users with full and easy access to computer-based telecommunications.
The EFF is supported by donations and is based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], with staff members in [[Washington, D.C]]. They are accredited observers at the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/IP/WIPO/ |title=WIPO Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of the participants of the [[Global Network Initiative]].&lt;ref&gt;

EFF has taken action in several ways. It provides funds for legal defense in court, presents [[amici curiae]] briefs, defends individuals and new [[technologies]] from what it considers baseless or misdirected legal threats, works to expose [[government]] malfeasance, provides guidance to the government and [[courts]], organizes political action and mass mailings, supports some new technologies which it believes preserve [[personal freedom]]s, maintains a [[database]] and web sites of related news and information, monitors and challenges potential [[legislation]] that it believes would infringe on [[personal liberty|personal liberties]] and [[fair use]], and solicits a list of what it considers [[patent misuse|patent abuses]] with intentions to defeat those that it considers without [[merit (legal)|merit]].

{{triple image|right|MitchKapor.jpg|100|John Gilmore.jpg|93|John Perry Barlow cropped.jpg|111|Electronic Frontier Foundation founders Kapor, Gilmore and Barlow|||Mitch Kapor|John Gilmore|John Perry Barlow}}

===Foundation===
The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formed in July 1990 by [[John Perry Barlow]] and [[Mitch Kapor]] in response to a series of actions by law enforcement agencies that led them to conclude that the authorities were gravely uninformed about emerging forms of online communication,&lt;ref name=j1/&gt; and that there was a need for increased protection for [[Internet]] [[civil liberties]].

In April 1990, Barlow had been visited by a U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] agent in relation to the theft and distribution of the source code for a series of Macintosh ROMs. Barlow described the visit as &quot;complicated by [The Agent's] fairly complete unfamiliarity with computer technology. I realized right away that before I could demonstrate my innocence, I would first have to explain to him what guilt might be.&quot; Barlow felt that his experience was symptomatic of a âgreat paroxysm of governmental confusion during which everyone's liberties would become at riskâ.

Barlow posted an account of this experience to [[WELL (virtual community)|The WELL]] online community and was contacted by Mitch Kapor, who had had a similar experience. The pair agreed that there was a need to defend civil liberties on the internet. Kapor agreed to fund any legal fees associated with such a defense and the pair contacted New York lawyers Rabinowitz, Boudin, Standard, Krinsky and Lieberman about defending several computer hackers from a ''Harper's'' magazine forum on computers and freedom who had been the target of [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] raids.&lt;ref name=j1&gt;{{Harvnb|Jones|2003|p=172}}&lt;/ref&gt; This generated a large amount of publicity which led to offers of financial support from  [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]] and [[Steve Wozniak]]. Barlow and Kapor continued to research conflicts between the government and technology and in June 1990 Barlow posted online the influential article entitled &quot;Crime &amp; Punishment&quot; in which Barlow announced his and Kapor's plans to create an organization to &quot;raise and disburse funds for education, lobbying, and litigation in the areas relating to digital speech and the extension of the Constitution into Cyberspace.&quot; {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

This generated further reaction and support for the ideas of Barlow and Kapor. In late June, Barlow held a series of dinners in San Francisco with major figures in the computer industry {{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} to develop a coherent response to these perceived threats. Barlow considered that: &quot;The actions of the FBI and Secret Service were symptoms of a growing social crisis: Future Shock. America was entering the Information Age with neither laws nor metaphors for the appropriate protection and conveyance of information itself.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://w2.eff.org/Misc/Publications/John_Perry_Barlow/HTML/not_too_brief_history.html |title= A Not Terribly Brief History of the Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate=Jan 12, 2010|first=John |last=Barlow}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barlow felt that to confront this a formal organization would be needed and hired [[Cathy Cook]] as press coordinator and began to set up what would become the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

The Electronic Frontier Foundation was formally founded on July 10, 1990, by Kapor, Gilmore and Barlow.  Initial funding was provided by Kapor, Wozniak, and an anonymous benefactor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/legal/cases/SJG/?f=eff_creation.html |title=

In 1990, [[Mike Godwin]] joined the organization as the first staff counsel. Then in 1991 [[Esther Dyson]] and Jerry Berman joined the EFF Board. By 1992 Cliff Figallo became the new director of EFF-Cambridge and in December 1992 Jerry Berman became Acting Executive Director.

===Early cases===
The creation of the organization was motivated by the massive [[search and seizure]] on [[Steve Jackson Games]] executed by the [[United States Secret Service]] early in 1990. Similar but officially unconnected law-enforcement raids were being conducted across the United States at about that time as part of a state-federal task force called [[Operation Sundevil]]. However, the [[Steve Jackson Games, Inc. v. United States Secret Service|Steve Jackson Games case]], which became EFF's first high-profile case, was the major rallying point where EFF began promoting computer and Internet-related civil liberties. In 1993, their offices moved to 1001 G Street in [[Washington, D.C.]] That same year ''Big Dummy's guide to the Internet'', an Electronic Frontier Foundation publication, was made available for free download.

EFF's second big case was ''[[Bernstein v. United States]]'' led by [[Cindy Cohn]], where programmer and professor [[Daniel J. Bernstein]] sued the government for permission to publish his [[encryption]] software, [[Snuffle]], and a paper describing it. More recently the organization has been involved in defending [[Edward Felten]], [[Jon Lech Johansen]] and [[Dmitry Sklyarov]].

===Expansion and development===
[[File:Electronic Frontier Foundation 20th anniversary mecha poster.jpg|thumb|In early 2010, EFF released this poster in celebration of its founding 20 years before.]]

The organization was originally located at [[Mitch Kapor]]'s Kapor Enterprises, Inc offices in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. By the fall of 1993, the main EFF offices were housed in [[Washington, D.C.]], headed up by Jerry Berman. During this time, some of EFF's attention focused on the business of influencing national policy, a business that was not entirely palatable to parts of the organization. In 1994, Mr. Berman parted ways with EFF and formed the [[Center for Democracy and Technology]]. EFF moved offices across town, where Drew Taubman briefly took the reins as director. In 1995, under the auspices of director [[Lori Fena]], after some downsizing and in an effort to regroup and refocus on their base support, the organization moved offices to San Francisco, California. There, it took up temporary residence at [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore's]] Toad Hall, and soon afterward moved into the Hamm's building at 1550 Bryant St. After Fena moved onto the EFF board of directors for a while, the organization was led by [[Tara Lemmey]]. Just prior to the EFF's move into its new and present offices at 454 Shotwell St. in SF's Mission District, long-time EFF Legal Director [[Shari Steele]] became, and remains as of late 2010, the Executive Director. In the spring of 2006, EFF announced the opening of an office in [[Washington, D.C.]] with two new staff attorneys.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Declan | last=McCullagh | pages= | title=EFF reaches out to D.C. with new office | date=April 27, 2006 | publisher=CNET News.com | url=http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-6065860.html | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070226221245/http://news.zdnet.com/2100-9595_22-6065860.html | archivedate=February 26, 2007 |accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===DES Cracker===
{{see|EFF DES cracker}}
By the mid-90s the EFF was becoming seriously concerned about the refusal of the US Government to license any secure encryption product for export unless it utilizes key recovery and claims that governments cannot decrypt information when protected by [[Data Encryption Standard|DES]], continuing even after the public breaking of the code in the first of the [[DES Challenges]]. They coordinated and supported the construction of the ''EFF DES cracker'', using special purpose hardware and software and costing only $210,000.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_descracker_pressrel.html|title=&quot;EFF DES CRACKER&quot; MACHINE BRINGS HONESTY TO CRYPTO DEBATE|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Crypto/Crypto_misc/DESCracker/HTML/19980716_eff_des_faq.html#sources|title=Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) About the Electronic Frontier Foundation's &quot;DES Cracker&quot; Machine|accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This brought the record for breaking a message down to 56 hours on 17 July 1998 and to under 24 hours on 19 Jan 1999 (in conjunction with [[distributed.net]]).

The EFF published the plans and source code for the cracker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cracking DES - Secrets of Encryption Research, Wiretap Politics &amp; Chip Design|author=Electronic Frontier Foundation|isbn=1-56592-520-3|publisher=Oreilly &amp; Associates Inc|year=1998|url=http://cryptome.org/cracking-des/cracking-des.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within four years the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] was standardized as a replacement for DES.

==Activities==
===Litigation===
[[File:2010 RSA Conference - EFF booth.jpg|thumb|EFF booth at the 2010 RSA Conference]]
{{Main|List of litigation involving the Electronic Frontier Foundation}}
The EFF regularly brings and defends lawsuits at all levels of the US legal system in pursuit of its goals and objectives. Many of the most significant technology law cases have involved the EFF, including ''[[MGM Studios, Inc. v. Grokster, Ltd.]]'', ''[[Apple v. Does]]'', and others.

===Awards===
The EFF organises two sets of awards to promote work in accordance with its goals and objectives:

The [[EFF Pioneer Award]]s are awarded annually to recognise individuals who in its opinion are &quot;leaders who are extending freedom and innovation on the electronic frontier.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Eff Pioneer Awards Website&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/awards/pioneer |title=EFF Pioneer Awards |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the honourees were [[Limor Fried]], [[Harri Hursti]] and [[Carl Malamud]]

The EFF Cooperative Computing Awards are a series of four awards meant &quot;to encourage ordinary Internet users to contribute to solving huge scientific problems,&quot; to be awarded to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with a significant record number of decimal digits. The awards are funded by an anonymous donor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/awards/coop |title= EFF Cooperative Computing Awards|accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The awards are:
* $50,000 to the first individual or group who discovers a [[megaprime|prime number with at least 1,000,000 decimal digits]] â Awarded April 6, 2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=Katina | last= Bishop | pages= | title=EFF Gives $50,000 to Finder of Largest Known Prime Number | date=April 6, 2000 | publisher=eff.org | url=https://w2.eff.org/awards/20000406_coopaward_pr.html |accessdate=December 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* $150,000 to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with at least 100,000,000 decimal digits
* $250,000 to the first individual or group who discovers a prime number with at least 1,000,000,000 decimal digits.

==Support==
The foundation receives support from its board members&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/about/board |title=Board of Directors}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Buckman]] (Chairman), [[Pamela Samuelson]] (Vice-Chairman), [[John Perry Barlow]], [[Lorrie Cranor]], [[David J. Farber]], [[Edward Felten]], [[John Gilmore (activist)|John Gilmore]], [[Brewster Kahle]], [[Joe Kraus]] and [[Brad Templeton]]. The organization often receives additional [[pro bono publico|pro bono]] legal assistance from Prof. [[Eben Moglen]].

On February 18, 2004, the EFF announced that it had received $1.2 million from the estate of [[Leonard Zubkoff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/about/20040218_eff_pr.php |title=EFF: Internet Pioneer Gives Over $1.2 Million to EFF to Defend Online Freedom|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It will use $1 million of this money to establish the EFF Endowment Fund for Digital Civil Liberties.

In April 2011 [[George Hotz]] donated $10,000 the remainder of his legal defense money in his case against Sony.

The [[agitprop]] art group Psychological Industries has independently issued buttons with [[pop culture]] [[trope (literature)|tropes]] such as the logo of the Laughing Man from the [[anime]] series [[Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex]] (with the original [[Catcher in the Rye]] quotation replaced with the slogan of [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]]), a bleeding [[Roller derby|roller derby jammer]], and [[Rosie the Riveter]] on a series of buttons on behalf of the EFF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com/ |title=Home |publisher=Onemillionbuttonsfordigitalfreedom.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charity Navigator]] has given EFF four out of four stars for its financial efficiency and capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm/bay/search.summary/orgid/7576.htm|title= Electronic Frontier Foundation|accessdate= June 5, 2007|publisher= [[Charity Navigator]]|accessdate=March 6, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In literature==
The EFF is featured in [[Dan Brown]]'s [[techno-thriller]] novel [[Digital Fortress]]. The book was released in 1998, the same year as the [[EFF DES cracker]] was built.
