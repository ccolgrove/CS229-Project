==History==
[[Image:Old Central.jpg|thumb|left|[[Old Central]] at Oklahoma A&amp;M, 1894]]
On December 25, 1890, the [[Oklahoma territory|Oklahoma Territorial]] Legislature finally gained approval for '''Oklahoma Territorial Agricultural and Mechanical (A&amp;M)''' College, the [[land-grant]] university established under the Morrill Act of 1862. It specified that the college was to be within [[Payne County, Oklahoma|Payne County]]. Such an ambiguous description created rivalry between towns within the county, with Stillwater ultimately winning out. Upon statehood in 1907, &quot;Territorial&quot; was dropped from its title.
[[Image:OklahomaA&amp;MSeal.png|105px|thumb|left|Oklahoma A&amp;M seal]]
The first students assembled for class on December 14, 1891. Classes were held for two and one-half years in local churches until the first academic building, later known as [[Old Central]], was dedicated on June 15, 1894, on the southeast corner of campus, which at the time was flat plowed prairie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.okstate.edu/scua/exhibit/campusbeg/index.htm |title=Campus Beginnings: 1890â1940 â SCUA Online Exhibit â OSU Library |publisher=Library.okstate.edu |date=January 29, 2007 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1896, '''Oklahoma A&amp;M''' held its first commencement with six male graduates. The first Library was established in Old Central in one room shared with the English Department.  The first campus building to have electricity, Williams Hall, was constructed in 1900. With its turreted architecture it was referred to as the &quot;Castle of the Prairies&quot;;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.okstate.edu/about/history.htm |title=OSU Library History |publisher=Library.okstate.edu |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It remained standing until 1969. One of the earliest campus buildings was also a barn, used as part of an agricultural experiment station, which was served by a large reservoir pond created in 1895.  The barn burned in 1922, but the pond, enlarged and remodeled in 1928 and 1943, is now known as Theta Pond, a popular campus scenic landmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.okstate.edu/scua/exhibit/theta/index.htm |title=Special Collections: Theta Pond |publisher=Library.okstate.edu |date=September 22, 2008 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1906, Morrill Hall was completed and became the principal building on campus. A fire gutted the building in 1914, but the outside structure survived intact, and the interior was reconstructed. The first dormitory for women was completed in 1911. It contained a kitchen, dining hall, some classrooms, and a women's gymnasium.  It is now the Bartlett Center for the Studio Arts and houses the [http://art.okstate.edu/facilities/gardiner.php Gardiner Art Gallery]. By 1919 the campus included Morrill Hall, the Central Building, the Engineering Building (now Gunderson Hall), the Women's building, the Auditorium (replaced later by the [http://music.okstate.edu/sereteancenter.php Seretean Center for Performing Arts]), the Armory-Gymnasium (now the Architecture Building) and the Power Plant.&lt;ref&gt;[A History of the Oklahoma State University Campus, by J. Lewie Sanderson, R. Dean McGlamery, and David C. Peters]&lt;/ref&gt;


[[Image:OSUStudentUnion2.jpg|thumb|right|Student Union Building at OSU]]
Much of the growth of Oklahoma A&amp;M and the campus architectural integrity can be attributed to work of [[Henry G. Bennett]], who served as the school's president from 1928 to 1950. Early in his tenure Dr. Bennett developed a strategic vision for the physical expansion of the university campus. The plan was adopted in 1937 and his vision was followed for more than fifty years, making the university what it is today, including the [[Georgian architecture]] that permeates the campus. The focal point of his vision was a centrally located library building, which became a reality when the [[Edmon Low Library]] opened in 1953. Another major addition to the campus during the Bennett years was the construction of the Student Union, which opened in 1950. Subsequent additions and renovations have made the building one of the largest student union buildings in the world at {{convert|611000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://union.okstate.edu/renovation/BuildingHistory.htm |title=OSU Student Union Building History |publisher=Union.okstate.edu |date=September 9, 1950 |accessdate=February 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete renovation and further expansion of the building began in 2010.

[[Image:HenryBennettStatueatOSU.jpg|thumb|left|Statue of Henry G. Bennett near Library Lawn at OSU]] 
On May 15, 1957, '''Oklahoma A&amp;M''' changed its name for the final time to '''Oklahoma State University''' to reflect the broadening scope of curriculum offered. (Oklahoma Gov. Raymond Gary signed the bill authorizing the name change passed by the 26th Oklahoma Legislature on May 15, 1957. However, the bill only authorized the Board of Regents to change the name of the college, a measure they voted on at their meeting on June 6. The official name - Oklahoma State University of Agricultural and Applied Sciences - took effect July 1. The latter portion of the name was dropped in 1980.) Subsequently, the [[Oklahoma State University System]] was created, with the Stillwater campus as the flagship institution and several outlying branches: [[Oklahoma State University - Okmulgee|OSU-Institute of Technology]] in [[Okmulgee, OK|Okmulgee]] (1946), [[Oklahoma State University - Oklahoma City|OSU-Oklahoma City]] (1961), [[Oklahoma State University - Tulsa|OSU-Tulsa]] (1984) and the [[Oklahoma State University - Center for Health Sciences|Center for Health Sciences]] also in [[Tulsa]] (1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://osu.okstate.edu/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=280&amp;Itemid=96 &quot;OSU History&quot;]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, OSU announced its &quot;Campus Master Plan&quot;, a campaign to enhance academic, athletic, and administrative facilities. Over $800 million is ear-marked for campus construction and renovation over twenty years. The Plan calls for an &quot;athletic village&quot; where all of the university's athletic facilities will be located on the main campus. To accomplish this goal, the athletic department bought all (or nearly all) the property north of [[Boone Pickens Stadium]] up to McElroy between Knoblock and Washington streets. This drew criticism from the city of Stillwater and property owners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Pickens's Donation to Oklahoma State Spurs Fight on Land Grab | work=Boone State | url=http://clerestoryav.com/boonestate/bloomberg.html| accessdate=May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While the vast majority of the real estate was rental property targeting college students, a few owners were longtime residents. There was a lone holdout in this parcel of land, who sued OSU over their right to use [[eminent domain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Lone Holdout Blocks Pickens's Vast Sports Project at Oklahoma State U. | work=The Chronicle of Higher Education | url=http://chronicle.com/news/article/1063/lone-holdout-blocks-pickenss-vast-sports-project-at-oklahoma-state-u| accessdate=May 24, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was decided in favor of the University. The project includes the construction of an indoor practice facility for most sports, a soccer stadium/outdoor track, a tennis complex, and a baseball stadium.

In 2006, OSU become the recipient of a gift of $165 million from alumnus [[T.

==Student life==
===Housing===
Current university-owned housing options include 26 residence halls, more than 15 dining options, and seven family-first apartment complexes. In recent years, on-campus housing has been undergoing significant transformation. Student living was previously dominated by traditional dormitories; however, apartment-style buildings now comprise approximately half of the living quarters. In 2005, the high-rise Willham North and South residential halls that once dominated the Stillwater skyline were demolished and replaced with the Village suites on its site. Iba Hall, another traditional dorm, was closed in 2007 but is being reopened in 2011 due to an increase of incoming freshman. Parker Hall is also slated to be closed at the end of the 2008â2009 school year for temporary use as offices for departments that will be displaced by renovations of the Student Union.

===Greek life===
Oklahoma State University's fraternities and sororities celebrated 100 years of existence at OSU in 2008.

Social fraternities and sororities at Oklahoma State are divided among four councils: Panhellenic, Interfraternity, National Pan-Hellenic and Multicultural. 

Eleven national Panhellenic sororities have chapters at OSU. They are: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]. 

Twenty-one fraternities make up the Interfraternity Council. Member fraternities include: [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[FarmHouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Phi Epsilon]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], [[Theta Chi]], and [[Kappa Alpha Order]].

NPHC member organizations are historically black fraternities and sororities. As of the 2010 - 2011 school year, [[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], and [[Zeta Phi Beta]] have chapters at OSU.

The Multicultural Greek Council is the umbrella organization for additional minority Greek letter groups. Member organizations include [[Alpha Pi Omega]], the nation's first Native American sorority; [[Delta Epsilon Psi]], a south Asian fraternity; [[Phi Sigma Nu]], the nation's first Native American fraternity and a colony of [[Sigma Lambda Gamma]], a Latina sorority.

Other Greek letter organizations not affiliated with a governing council include [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], a Christian fraternity; [[Omega Phi Alpha]], a service-based sorority; and [[Sigma Phi Lambda]], a Christian sorority.

[[Theta Alpha Phi]] National Theatre Honor Fraternity, [[Kappa Kappa Psi]] and [[Tau Beta Sigma]], (the national honorary fraternity and sorority for college band members) were founded at Oklahoma State in 1919 and 1946, respectively.
