'''Pidgin''' (formerly named '''Gaim''') is an [[open-source]] multi-platform [[instant messaging]] [[client (computing)|client]], based on a [[library (computing)|library]] named '''libpurple'''. Libpurple has support for many commonly used instant messaging [[Protocol (computing)|protocols]], allowing the user to log into various services from one application.

The number of Pidgin users was estimated to be over 3 million in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pcworld.idg.com.au/index.php/id;1641709366;pp;1;fp;2;fpid;4 &quot;Luke Schierer discusses Pidgin, Open source and life&quot;]. [[PC World (magazine)#Countries|PC World]] Australia, 10 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==
[[Image:Pidgin Screenshot Ubuntu.png|thumb|200px|left|Pidgin running on [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]]]

Pidgin provides a graphical [[Front-end and back-end#Computer science|front-end]] for libpurple using [[GTK+]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/WhatIsLibpurple |title=What Is Libpurple - Pidgin - Trac |publisher=Pidgin.im |accessdate=2009-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Libpurple supports multiple instant-messaging [[Network protocol|protocols]].

Pidgin supports multiple [[operating system]]s, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] as well as many [[Unix-like]] systems such as [[Linux]], [[BSD]], [[Mac OS X]], and [[AmigaOS]] (through the [[X11]] engine). It has built-in support for [[Network Security Services|NSS]], offering client-to-server message encryption for protocols that support it. The program is extendable through [[plugins]], including &quot;[[Off-the-Record Messaging]]&quot; and Pidgin encryption,&lt;ref&gt;[http://pidgin-encrypt.sourceforge.net/ &quot;Pidgin-Encryption&quot;].  Sourceforge.&lt;/ref&gt; providing end-to-end message encryption.

Pidgin features some of the standard tools for an instant-messaging client, such as a [[contact list]], file transfer on supported protocols, and conversation and chat logging. Tabbed conversations is an optional feature on Pidgin. The IM window consists of the message window, formatting tools, and an edit box.

Users can add contacts (usually known as &quot;Buddies&quot;) in the &quot;Buddy List&quot; window or in the IM window. As a client that supports IRC and other chat programs, Pidgin can also add different IRC channels and IM Chats. Contacts with multiple protocols can be grouped into one single contact instead of managing multiple protocols, and contacts can be given aliases or placed into groups.

To reach users as they log on or a status change occurs (such as moving from &quot;Away&quot; to &quot;Available&quot;), Pidgin supports on-action automated scripts called ''Buddy Pounces'' to automatically reach the user in customizable ways.

Pidgin supports some file transfers, with the ability to cancel transfers and observe multiple transfers in a separate window, while lacking some protocol-specific features like the folder sharing available from Yahoo.  Older versions of Pidgin did not support direct, peer-to-peer file transfers over the MSN protocol and instead relayed file transfers over a slower connection via the MSN servers however direct connection support has been added since Pidgin 2.7.

As of version 2.6 (released on August 18, 2009) Pidgin has a voice/video framework which uses [[Farsight|Farsight2]] and is based on Mike Ruprecht's Google Summer of Code project from 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ChangeLog |title=Changelog |publisher=pidgin.im |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; That release provides the ability to have voice/video conversations using the XMPP protocol (including Google Talk), though the implementation is not yet fully complete. The framework will also allow for voice/video conversations on other protocols, such as MSN and Yahoo, in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/vv |title=Voice and Video |publisher=pidgin.im|accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further features include support for themes, [[emoticon]]s, [[Spell checker|spell checking]], and notification area integration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pidgin.im/about/ |title=About Pidgin |accessdate=2010-09-22 |url=http://www.pidgin.im/about/|publisher=pidgin.im}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supported protocols ===
The following protocols are officially supported by libpurple 2.9.0, without any extensions or plugins:&lt;ref name=&quot;homepage&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/Protocol%20Specific%20Questions|title=Protocol Specific Questions|author=Pidgin developers|accessdate=2011-06-30|publisher=pidgin.im}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM (AOL Instant Messenger)]]
* [[Bonjour (software)|Bonjour]] (Apple's implementation of [[Zeroconf]])
* [[Gadu-Gadu]]
* [[Internet Relay Chat]] (IRC)
* [[Lotus Sametime]]
* [[MySpaceIM]]
* [[MXit]]
* [[.NET Messenger Service]] (commonly known as ''[[MSN Messenger]] or [[Windows Live Messenger]]''; no multimedia support)
* [[Novell GroupWise]]
* [[OSCAR protocol|OSCAR]] ([[AOL Instant Messenger|AIM]]/[[ICQ]]/[[.Mac]])
* [[SIMPLE]]

* [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] ([[Google Talk]], [[LiveJournal|LJ Talk]], [[Gizmo5]], [[Facebook Chat]], ...)
* [[Yahoo Messenger|Yahoo]] (only basic chat and file transfers)
* [[Zephyr (protocol)|Zephyr]]

Some XMPP servers provide [[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol#Connecting to other protocols|transports]], which allow users to access networks using non-XMPP protocols without having to install plugins or additional software. Pidgin's support for XMPP means that these transports can be used to communicate via otherwise unsupported protocols, including not only instant messaging protocols, but also protocols such as SMS or E-mail.

Additional protocols, supported by third-party plugins, include [[QQ]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://code.google.com/p/libqq-pidgin/|title=libqq|accessdate=2011-06-14|publisher=code.google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Skype]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eion.robbmob.com|title=Skype &quot;API Plugin for Pidgin/libpurple/Adium&quot;|accessdate=2009-07-06|publisher=RobbMob.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Xfire]] gaming network (requires the [[Gfire]] plugin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins#AdditionalProtocols|title=Third Party Plugins|publisher=pidgin.im|accessdate=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plugins ===
Various other features are supported using third-party [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/ThirdPartyPlugins |title=Pidgin Third-Party Plugins |accessdate=2009-09-22|publisher=pidgin.im}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such features include:

* [[Encryption]] and privacy, through [[Off-the-Record Messaging]]
* Notifications (such as showing &quot;toaster&quot; popups or [[Snarl (software)|Snarl]] notifications, or lighting LEDs on laptops)
* Showing contacts what you are listening to in various media players
* Adding [[mathematical formula]]s written in [[LaTeX]] to conversations
* Watching videos directly into your conversation when receiving a video sharing website link ([[YouTube]], [[Vimeo]])

== History ==
[[Image:Gaim-buddylist-2.0.0b6.png|thumb|230px|right|Gaim 2.0.0 beta 6 running under [[GNOME]] 2.16.0]]
The program was originally written by [[Mark Spencer (computer engineer)|Mark Spencer]], an [[Auburn University]] sophomore, as an emulation of AOL's IM program [[AOL Instant Messenger]] on Linux using the [[GTK+]] toolkit.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;&gt;Herper, Matthew (July 16, 2002). [http://www.forbes.com/2002/07/16/0716tentech.html &quot;Better Instant Messaging Through Linux&quot;] [[Forbes.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest archived release was on December 31, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=User Guide |author=Crawford, J. |year=1999 |publisher=marko.net |quote=As of now, the most recent sources are [ftp://ftp.marko.net/pub/gaim/gaim-19981231.tar.gz here] ''(the file date is 1998-12-31)'' |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990508005552/http://www.marko.net/gaim/uguide.html |archivedate=1999-05-08 |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was named '''GAIM''' (''GTK+ AOL Instant Messenger'') accordingly. The emulation was not based on [[reverse engineering]], but instead relied on information about the protocol that AOL had published on the web; development was also assisted by some of AOL's technical staff.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GAIM: GTK+ America OnLine Instant Messenger | work=Original project home page |publisher=marko.net |first=Mark|last=Spencer|year=1998 |url=http://www.marko.net |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/19990210175349/http://www.marko.net/gaim/ |archivedate=February 10, 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for other IM protocols was added soon thereafter.&lt;ref name=&quot;forbes&quot;/&gt;

=== Naming dispute ===
In response to pressure from [[AOL]], the program was renamed to the acronymous-but-lowercase '''gaim'''. As AOL Instant Messenger gained popularity, AOL trademarked its acronym, &quot;AIM&quot;, leading to a lengthy legal struggle with the creators of GAIM, who kept the matter largely secret.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pidgin.im/~seanegan/cgi-bin/pyblosxom.cgi/momentum2 &quot;Sean Egan's Blog - The Power of Momentum (continued)&quot;]. pidgin.im. May 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 6, 2007, the project development team announced the results of their settlement with AOL, which included a series of name changes: ''Gaim'' became ''Pidgin'', ''libgaim'' became ''libpurple'', and ''gaim-text'' became ''finch''. The name Pidgin was chosen in reference to the term &quot;[[pidgin]]&quot;, which describes communication between people who do not share a common language.&lt;ref name=&quot;Important&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pidgin.im/index.php?id=177 |title=Important and Long Delayed News |publisher=pidgin.im |date=April 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070408150853/http://www.pidgin.im/index.php?id=177 |archivedate=2007-04-08|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name &quot;purple&quot; refers to &quot;prpl&quot;, the internal libgaim name for an IM '''pr'''otocol '''pl'''ugin.

Due to the legal issues, version 2.0 of the software was frozen in beta stages. Following the settlement, it was announced that the first official release of Pidgin 2.0.0 was hoped to occur during the two weeks from April 8, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pidgin.im/index.php?id=177 |title=Important and Long Delayed News |publisher=pidgin.im |date=April 6, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070408150853/http://www.pidgin.im/index.php?id=177 |archivedate=2007-04-08|accessdate=2011-10-15 |quote=Now that the settlement is signed, we hope to have the final Pidgin 2.0.0 release late this week or early next.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pidgin 2.0 was not released as scheduled; Pidgin developers announced on April 22, 2007 that the delay was due to the preferences directory &quot;&lt;tt&gt;.gaim&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pidgin.im/index.php?id=178  |publisher=pidgin.im |title=Working towards 2.0.0 |date=April 22, 2007 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070425193748/http://pidgin.im/index.php?id=178 |archivedate=2007-04-25|accessdate=2007-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pidgin 2.0.0 was released on May 3, 2007. Other visual changes were made to the interface on 2.0.0, including updated icons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://pidgin.im/~seanegan/blog/identity.html|title= Identity vs. Account Orientation|date=April 30, 2007 |first=Sean|last=Egan|publisher=pidgin.im |accessdate=2007-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticisms ==
* [[Password]]s are stored in a [[plaintext]] file. This password file is readable by anyone who has physical access to the computer, access to the user or administrative accounts, or (potentially) to anyone who is able to exploit security vulnerabilities on that computer. The developers recognize this as a security concern, but believe that the requirements of Pidgin (and the nature of instant messaging) make it infeasible to encrypt the password file, though they have said that they welcome solutions to integrate Pidgin with application-level security solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/wiki/PlainTextPasswords |title=Plain Text Passwords|publisher=pidgin.im |date=August 26, 2010 (last modified)|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pidgin does not currently support resuming paused or incomplete file transfers in any of the applicable chat protocols.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/5769 |title=Ticket #5769 (new enhancement) - Resume broken file transfers |date=May 11, 2008 |publisher=pidgin.im |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/7486 |title=Ticket #7486 (closed enhancement: duplicate) - xdcc download-resuming-support |date=November 7, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/1425 |title=Ticket #1425 (new enhancement)- No ability to resume in IRC file transfers|date=May 30, 2007 |publisher=pidgin.im |accessdate=2008-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As of version 2.4 and later, the ability to manually resize the text input box of conversations has been alteredâPidgin now automatically resizes between a number of lines set in 'Preferences' and 50% of the window depending on how much is typed. Some users find this an annoyance rather than a feature and find this solution unacceptable. The inability to manually resize the input area eventually led to a [[fork (software)|fork]], Carrier (originally named Funpidgin).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.pidgin.im/ticket/4986 |title=Ticket #4986 (closed enhancement: wontfix) - automatic chat input field resizing should be optional, regression from 2.3 |date=March 1, 2008 |publisher=pidgin.im |accessdate=2008-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/04/in-response-to.html|title=In Response to User Demand, Pidgin Forks|date=April  2008|publisher=Wired.com|first=Paul |last=Adams|date=April 22, 2008|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080519204346/http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/04/in-response-to.html |archivedate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malda, Rob (April 30, 2008).
