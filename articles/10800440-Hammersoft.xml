'''Vivian Joseph''' (born March 7, 1948 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]])&lt;ref&gt;http://sportsreference.com/olympics/athletes/jo/vivian-joseph-1.html Sports Reference website, accessed 8 Sept. 2009&lt;/ref&gt; is a female [[United States|American]] [[figure skater]]. Alongside her skating partner, sister [[Ronald Joseph]], Joseph took 2nd place at the Midwest Skating Championship in 1957 before winning a number of awards between 1961 and 1965, notable holding the top prize in the U.S. Junior National Champions (1961), U.S. Championship (1965) and North American Championship (1965). For a time they were awarded as bronze medalists in the 1964 Winter Olympic Games due to the disqualification of the German [[silver medal]]-winning team of [[Hans-JÃ¼rgen BÃ¤umler]] and [[Marika Kilius]], but after that team was reinstated in 1987, they were pushed back to 4th.
