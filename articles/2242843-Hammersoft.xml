&quot;'''You Can't Do That'''&quot; is a song written by [[John Lennon]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=106â107}}{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=715}}{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=164}} (credited to [[LennonâMcCartney]]) and released by [[The Beatles]] as the [[A-side and B-side|B-side]] of their sixth British single &quot;[[Can't Buy Me Love]]&quot;.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}}

==Composition==

One of Lennon's semi-autobiographical songs{{sfn|Miles|1997|p=164}} You Can't Do That &quot;contradicted the genial tone with its tense threats, sexual paranoia and nagging, dragging groove&quot; ... so wrote Robert Sandall.{{sfn|Sandall|2000|p=114}} The song's jealousy theme was re-visited in other Lennon compositions, such as &quot;[[Run for Your Life]]&quot; and &quot;[[Jealous Guy]]&quot;.
Lennon played the guitar solo, which he also conceived.{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=106â107}}  Influenced by the then relatively unknown [[Wilson Pickett]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=106â107}} the song is rooted in twelve-bar, with Lennon introducing a [[discordant]] Sharp 9th (F) on the D7th chord, pointedly emphasising ''&quot;â¦I told you beforeâ¦&quot;'' and then pushing this note for the exasperated ''&quot;Oh!&quot;'' before resolving to the song's key of G.{{sfn|Complete Scores|1993|p=1077}}

With filming due to begin on ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' film director [[Dick Lester]] needed the Beatles to provide him with original material ahead of production and &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; was selected as part of the [[Scala Theatre]] &quot;live performance&quot; scene in the film, but was dropped for the final cut along with [[I'll Cry Instead]] and [[I Call Your Name]]. The recording took nine takes to complete, and was considered for the A-side of their next single until McCartney wrote Can't Buy Me Love.

==Recording and release==

&quot;You Can't Do That&quot; was recorded on Tuesday, 25 February 1964, in [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=39}} An early [[take]] with a guide vocal is included on ''[[Anthology 1]]''.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1995|p=34}} It was the first song completed in the week before the Beatles began filming A Hard Day's Night, though &quot;[[I Should Have Known Better]]&quot; and &quot;[[And I Love Her]]&quot; were also started on the same day.

While in New York for ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' guitarist [[George Harrison]] was presented with a [[Rickenbacker]] 360 Deluxe electric 12-string guitar worth (in 1964) $900{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=715}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|p=81}}. Only the second one produced, it was heard for the first time on &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; (although actually used for the first time on &quot;[[Can't Buy Me Love]]&quot; but lost in the mix) and gave the song its distinctive chiming sound.{{sfn|Harry|1992|p=715}} It would be played extensively on the ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' LP, greatly influencing [[Roger McGuinn]], who later went on to form [[The Byrds]].{{sfn|Palmer|1977|p=243}}

The song was first released as the B-side of the &quot;Can't Buy Me Love&quot; single on 16 March 1964 in the United States by [[Capitol Records]] and on 20 March 1964 in the United Kingdom by [[Parlophone]]. it was the seventh US single and sixth UK single.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}} It was later included in the ''[[A Hard Day's Night (album)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' album in the UK, and ''[[The Beatles' Second Album]]'' in the US.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=200}}

The Beatles were filmed miming to &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; as part of the final concert sequence in the ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' film. The filming took place on 31 March 1964 at the [[Scala Theatre]], [[London]], but was not used. It was, however, broadcast on ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]'' on 24 May.{{sfn|The Beatles Bible|2008}} The performance is included in the documentary ''The Making of &quot;A Hard Day's Night&quot;''.

The Beatles recorded &quot;You Can't Do That&quot; four times for BBC radio in 1964. It also became a part of the group's live repertoire that year, and was the second song in their set&amp;mdash;after &quot;[[Twist And Shout]]&quot;&amp;mdash;during their [[Australia]]n and [[North America]]n tours.{{sfn|The Beatles Bible|2008}}

According to [[Mark Lewisohn]]'s ''The Beatles Recording Sessions'' book, George Martin overdubbed a piano track to Take 9 on 22 May 1964 ostensibly for the album version of this song, but it was never used.

==Personnel==

*[[John Lennon]] â lead vocal, lead guitar
*[[Paul McCartney]] â backing vocal, bass guitar, cowbell
*[[George Harrison]] â backing vocal, 12 string rhythm guitar 
*[[Ringo Starr]] â drums, conga
:Personnel per [[Ian MacDonald]]{{sfn|MacDonald|2005|p=106â107}}

==Nilsson version==

&quot;You Can't Do That&quot; was covered by [[Harry Nilsson]] for his debut album ''[[Pandemonium Shadow Show]]'' (1967). Nilsson re-arranged the song making it somewhat slower. He also worked references to 20 other Beatles tunes in the mix, usually by quoting snippets of Beatles lyrics in the multi-layered backing vocals. 

The track was Nilsson's first hit as a performer; though it stalled at #122 on the US charts, it hit top 10 in Canada. It also (along with the rest of the album) established Nilsson as a favourite performer of the Beatles. Famously, Lennon listened to ''Pandemonium Shadow Show'' for 36 hours straight after being given a copy by [[Derek Taylor]]; he then called Nilsson to congratulate him, which started a friendship that would last for the rest of Lennon's life. Later, in a 1968 press conference to announce the formation of [[Apple Corps]], Lennon was asked to name his favourite American artist. He replied, &quot;Nilsson&quot;. McCartney was then asked to name his favourite American group. He replied, &quot;Nilsson&quot;.

==Other covers==

* [[Vanilla Fudge]] covered it on their second album, ''[[The Beat Goes On (Vanilla Fudge album)|The Beat Goes On]]''.
* [[Andy Ellison]] recorded a version.
* [[Amanda Overmyer]] sang a faster rendition of the song on the Top 12 show of ''[[American Idol (season 7)]]'' and likewise recorded a studio version of the song.
* [[The Punkles]] did a cover of this song on their ''1998-2003'' album.
* [[The Supremes]] covered the song on their 1964 album ''[[A Bit of Liverpool]]''.
* [[The Head Cat]] covered on their latest album ''[[Walk the Walk...Talk the Talk]]''.
