In the '''[[United States]]''', the appearance of '''[[Vehicle registration plate|license plates]]''' is frequently chosen to contain staples, cultures, or slogans associated with the issuing [[jurisdiction]], which are the 50 [[U.S. state]]s and the [[District of Columbia]], each of which independently registers [[motor vehicle]]s.

'''Formats for license plate numbers''', which are usually alphanumeric, are chosen to provide enough unique serials for all motor vehicles a jurisdiction expects to register. For example, less-populous states such as [[Vehicle registration plates of Delaware|Delaware]] and [[Vehicle registration plates of Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] are able to use formats of 123456 and 123-456, respectively, while several populous states use seven-character formats, including 1ABC234 in [[Vehicle registration plates of California|California]], AB1-C234 in [[Vehicle registration plates of Texas|Texas]],&lt;ref name=&quot;plateshack.com&quot;&gt;[http://www.plateshack.com/y2k/Texas2/tx2009.jpg].&lt;/ref&gt; ABC-1234 in [[Vehicle registration plates of New York|New York]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Ohio|Ohio]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Vehicle registration plates of North Carolina|North Carolina]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Virginia|Virginia]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Washington|Washington]], and [[Vehicle registration plates of Arizona|Arizona]], 1A/B2345 in [[Vehicle registration plates of Maryland|Maryland]], and A12-3456 in [[Vehicle registration plates of Illinois|Illinois]].&lt;ref&gt;Northup, John B. ''License Plates of America''. River Pointe Publications, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some states, info such as the month of expiration or the [[County (United States)|county]] of registration is incorporated into the plate's serial. The last number on a [[Vehicle registration plates of Massachusetts|Massachusetts license plate]] indicates the month the vehicle's registration expires (for example, ''1234 AB'' would expire in April, the fourth month; ''0'' indicates October expirations; and ''X'' and ''Y'' were used for November and December expirations, respectively, on [[commerce|commercial]] plates and pre-1978 passenger plates), as does the first number or letter on [[Vehicle registration plates of West Virginia|West Virginia plates]] (''1'' to ''9'' and ''O'', ''N'', and ''D'' for January through September and October, November, and December expirations, respectively). In [[Vehicle registration plates of Alabama|Alabama]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Montana|Montana]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Nebraska|Nebraska]], [[Vehicle registration plates of South Dakota|South Dakota]], and [[Vehicle registration plates of Wyoming|Wyoming]], a one- or two-digit number representing the county of issue begins a license plate number. Standard-issue [[Vehicle registration plates of Idaho|Idaho license plate]] numbers begin with a [[Vehicle registration plates of Idaho#County coding|single-letter or a number-letter code]] representing the county of issue. County codes have been based on historical population figures, the county names in alphabetical order, or some combination thereof.

Several statesâ[[Vehicle registration plates of Florida|Florida]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Indiana|Indiana]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Iowa|Iowa]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Kentucky|Kentucky]], [[Vehicle registration plates of Mississippi|Mississippi]], and [[Vehicle registration plates of Tennessee|Tennessee]]âplace the full name of the county of registration explicitly on their standard-issue plates but not as part of the plate serial. Florida allows its residents to choose either &quot;Sunshine State&quot; or &quot;In God We Trust&quot; slogans instead of their county, and in [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade County]], all plates are issued with one of these slogans due to the targeting for crimes of [[car]]s registered there in the early 1990s. Florida also terminated a practice by which plates registered to [[Car rental|rented vehicles]] had the letter ''Y'' or ''Z'' as their first digit, which also led to targeting of cars for theft due to the ease of replacement and the softer hit on the affected driver. The State of Georgia, as of 2011, allows drivers to choose the slogan &quot;In God We Trust&quot; in place of the [[county]] name where the vehicle is registered.  [[Vehicle registration plates of Kansas|Kansas plates]] display a sticker bearing a [[Vehicle registration plates of Kansas#County coding|two-letter county code]] and [[Vehicle registration plates of Ohio|Ohio plates]] a sticker with a [[Vehicle registration plates of Ohio#County coding|two-number county code]], but neither is a part of the plate serial. [[Vehicle registration plates of Texas|Texas]] places the county name on the windshield registration sticker, but it likewise is not part of the plate serial.

In most states, plates for vehicles, other than passenger cars, such as [[truck]]s and [[trailer (vehicle)|trailers]], may use different numbering formats, either with or without the vehicle type appearing explicitly on the plate.

License plate numbers are usually assigned in ascending order, beginning with a starting point such as AAA-001. Thus an observer familiar with the sequence can determine roughly when the plate was issued. In a few cases, numbers have been assigned in descending order. For example, when [[Vehicle registration plates of Virginia|Virginia]] switched to seven characters for its standard issue in 1993, numbers beginning with AAA-1000 were already in use for extra-cost, optional-issue plates; therefore, the new standard license plates were issued in descending order from ZZZ-9999. Virginia's &quot;400th Anniversary&quot; plate series, issued from 2003 until 2007, was numbered in ascending order from JAA-1001, commemorating the colony at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]].

In the states, [[handicapped tag|special plates]] displaying the [[International Symbol of Accessibility]] are issued to persons with disabilities that entitle them to special parking privileges. Alternately, a [[placard]], which in some jurisdictions can be hung from the [[rear view mirror]], is issued and has the advantage of being transferred from vehicle to vehicle.

== Current standard-issue passenger plate designs and serial formats ==

The following tables give information on license plates currently being issued, with 2009 or later expiration dates, for private (non-[[commerce|commercial]]) use on passenger vehicles by the governments of the fifty [[U.S. states]], the [[District of Columbia]], and the [[U.S. territories]]. Information on [[serial number]]ing patterns is also given. Older designs and serial formats previously issued may still be valid for continued usage in certain jurisdictions; these are noted in a separate table below.

In addition to &quot;regular&quot; passenger plates, all jurisdictions also provide plates for other types of vehicles that may only be roughly similar in design and layout. Additionally, there has been a recent explosion in the field of what are called &quot;specialty&quot; plates to promote specific causes or interests. These plates are usually offered at an additional cost when the motorist registers his or her vehicle. To keep this table as simple as possible, most of these alternate types of plates will not be noted. More information may also be found within the individual articles for each state, as linked within the table. Exceptions to this guideline may be made for specialty plates that are available at no extra cost to the motorist, as these tend to be seen more commonly on the roads.
