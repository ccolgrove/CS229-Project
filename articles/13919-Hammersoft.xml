===1980s===
{{Main|South Lebanon conflict (1982â2000)}}
Ending [[Israel]]'s occupation of Southern Lebanon was the primary focus of Hezbollah's early activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc-hi-me&quot;/&gt; Israel had become militarily involved in Lebanon in [[Operation Litani|combat with]] the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]], which had been invited into Lebanon after [[Black September in Jordan]]. Israel had been attacking the PLO in Southern Lebanon in the lead-up to the [[1982 Lebanon War]], and Israel had invaded and occupied Southern Lebanon and besieged [[Beirut]].&lt;ref&gt;Avi Shlaim (2001) ''The Iron Wall: Israel and the Arab World'' W.W. Norton, ISBN 0393321126 Chapter 10; The Lebanese Quagmire 1981â1984 pp 384â423&lt;/ref&gt;

===After 1990===
In the 1990s, Hezbollah transformed from a revolutionary group into a political one, in a process which is described as the Lebanonisation of Hezbollah. Unlike its uncompromising revolutionary stance in the 1980s, Hezbollah conveyed a lenient stance towards the Lebanese state.&lt;ref&gt;

 |title=The strategy and tactics of Hizballah's current 'Lebanonization process}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, Hezbollah decided to participate in elections, and [[Ali Khamenei]], [[Supreme Leader of Iran|supreme leader]] of [[Iran]], endorsed it. Former Hezbollah secretary general, [[Subhi al-Tufayli]], contested this decision, which led to a schism in Hezbollah. Hezbollah won all twelve seats which were on its electoral list. At the end of that year, Hezbollah began to engage in dialog with Lebanese Christians. Hezbollah regards cultural, political, and religious freedoms in Lebanon as sanctified, although it does not extend these values to groups who have relations with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Alagha (2006), pp.41â44&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Hezbollah formed multi-confessional Lebanese Brigades to Fighting the Israeli Occupation, which was an attempt to revive national and secular resistance against Israel, which marks the Lebanonisation of resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Alagha (2006), p.47&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islamic Jihad Organization===
Whether the [[Islamic Jihad Organization]] (IJO) was a ''[[nom de guerre]]'' used by Hezbollah or a separate organization, is disputed.

Hezbollah leaders reportedly admitted their involvement in IJO's attacks and the nominal nature of &quot;Islamic Jihad&quot; â that it was merely a &quot;telephone organization,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Marius Deeb, Militant Islamic Movements in Lebanon: Origins, Social Basis, and Ideology, Occasional Paper Series (Washington, DC, Georgetown University, 1986) p.19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;al-Nahar, September 7, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;LaRevue du Liban, July 27 â August 3, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; whose name was &quot;used by those involved to disguise their true identity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''al-Nahar al-Arabi'', June 10&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Ma'aretz'', December 16, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Le Point'', July 30, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''al-Shira'', August 28, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Nouveau Magazine'', July 23, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2003 decision by an American court found IJO was the name used by Hezbollah for its attacks in [[Lebanon]], and parts of the Middle East, and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;see also {{Cite journal

Therefore, Hizballah maintains that it is a legitimate resistance movement fighting for the liberation of Lebanese territory.

Wistrich]], a historian specializing in the study of anti-Semitism, described Hezbollah's ideology concerning Jews: &lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;The anti-Semitism of Hezbollah leaders and spokesmen combines the image of seemingly invincible Jewish power ... and cunning with the contempt normally reserved for weak and cowardly enemies. Like the [[Hamas]] propaganda for holy war, that of Hezbollah has relied on the endless vilification of Jews as 'enemies of mankind,' 'conspiratorial, obstinate, and conceited' adversaries full of 'satanic plans' to enslave the Arabs. It fuses traditional Islamic anti-Judaism with Western conspiracy myths, Third Worldist anti-Zionism, and Iranian Shiite contempt for Jews as 'ritually impure' and corrupt infidels. [[Sheikh Fadlallah]] typically insists ... that Jews wish to undermine or obliterate Islam and Arab cultural identity in order to advance their economic and political domination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert S.

In November 2009, Hezbollah pressured a private English-language school to drop excerpts from [[The Diary of Anne Frank]], a book of the writings from the diary kept by the Jewish child Anne Frank while she was in hiding with her family during the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2009/11/09/1009038/hezbollah-heavies-school-into-pulling-anne-frank ''Hezbollah presses school into pulling Anne Frank''] ''[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]]'' November 9, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP&quot;&gt;Yazbeck, Natacha [http://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5itf1-VAct-8J9HM60sa5sFwpqWBg ''Anne Frank Diary offends Lebanon's Hezbollah''] ''[[Agence France-Presse]]'' November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; after Hezbollah's [[Al-Manar]] television channel complained, asking how long Lebanon would &quot;remain an open arena for the Zionist invasion of education&quot;?&lt;ref name=&quot;AFP&quot;/&gt;

==Organization==
[[File:HezbollahOrgChart.svg|thumb|450px|Organizational chart of Hezbollah, by Ahmad Nizar Hamzeh.]]
At the beginning many Hezbollah leaders have maintained that the movement was &quot;not an organization, for its members carry no cards and bear no specific responsibilities,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''al-Nahar al-Arabi walduwali'', June 10â16, 1985; and ''La Revue du Liban'', July 27 â August 3, 1985. quoted in Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p.41&lt;/ref&gt; and that the movement does not have &quot;a clearly defined organizational structure.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays, as Hezbollah scholar [[Magnus Ranstorp]] reports, Hezbollah does indeed have a formal governing structure, and in keeping with the principle of [[Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists]] (''velayat-e faqih''), it &quot;concentrate[s] ... all authority and powers&quot; in its religious leaders, whose decisions then &quot;flow from the [[Ulema|ulama]] down the entire community.&quot;

&lt;Blockquote&gt;The supreme decision-making bodies of the Hezbollah were divided between the Majlis al-Shura (Consultative Assembly) which was headed by 12 senior clerical members with responsibility for tactical decisions and supervision of overall Hizballah activity throughout Lebanon, and the Majlis al-Shura al-Karar (the Deciding Assembly), headed by Sheikh Muhammad Hussein Fadlallah and composed of eleven other clerics with responsibility for all strategic matters. Within the Majlis al-Shura, there existed seven specialized committees dealing with ideological, financial, military and political, judicial, informational and social affairs. In turn, the Majlis al-Shura and these seven committees were replicated in each of Hizballah's three main operational areas (the [[Beqaa Governorate|Beqaa]], [[Beirut]], and the South).&lt;ref name = &quot;Ranstorp-p45&quot;&gt;Ranstorp, ''Hizb'allah in Lebanon,'' (1997), p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since the [[Supreme Leader of Iran]] is the ultimate clerical authority, Hezbollah's leaders have appealed to him &quot;for guidance and directives in cases when Hezbollah's collective leadership [was] too divided over issues and fail[ed] to reach a consensus.&quot;&lt;ref name = &quot;Ranstorp-p45&quot;/&gt; After the death of Iran's first Supreme Leader, Khomeini, Hezbollah's governing bodies developed a more &quot;independent role&quot; and appealed to Iran less often.&lt;ref name = &quot;Ranstorp-p45&quot;/&gt; Since the [[Second Lebanon War]], however, [[Iran]] has restructured Hezbollah to limit the power of [[Hassan Nasrallah]], and invested billions of dollars &quot;rehabilitating&quot; Hezbollah.&lt;ref&gt;Nahmias, Roee.

Structurally, Hezbollah does not distinguish between its political/social activities within Lebanon and its military/''jihad'' activities against Israel. &quot;Hezbollah has a single leadership,&quot; according to [[Naim Qassem]], Hezbollah's second in command. &quot;All political, social and jihad work is tied to the decisions of this leadership ... The same leadership that directs the parliamentary and government work also leads jihad actions in the struggle against Israel.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Daragahi, Borzou.

In 2010, Iran's parliamentary speaker [[Ali Larijani]] said takes &quot;pride in Lebanon's Islamic resistance movement for its steadfast Islamic stance. Hezbollah nurtures the original ideas of Islamic Jihad.&quot; While he also praised the group for &quot;steadfast Islamic stance.&quot; He also instead turned charge on the West for having accused Iran with support of terrorism and said &quot;The real terrorists are those who provide the Zionist regime with military equipment to bomb the people.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siasat.com/english/news/larijani-iran-proud-backing-hezbollah |title=Larijani: Iran proud of backing Hezbollah |publisher=Siasat |date=2010-07-30 |accessdate=2011-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 7, 2008 [[Lebanon]]'s [[2006â2008 Lebanese political protests|17-month long political crisis]] spiraled out of control. [[2008 unrest in Lebanon|The fighting]] was sparked by a government move to shut down Hezbollah's telecommunication network and remove [[Beirut Airport]]'s security chief over alleged ties to Hezbollah.

===Armed strength===
Hezbollah has not revealed its armed strength. It has been estimated by Mustafa Alani, security director at the Dubai-based Gulf Research Centre that Hezbollah's military force is made up of about 1,000 full-time Hezbollah members, along with a further 6,000â10,000 volunteers.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hezbollah force&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.iiss.org/whats-new/iiss-in-the-press/press-coverage-2006/july-2006/hezbollah-a-force-to-be-reckoned-with |title= Analysis: Hezbollah a force to be reckoned with|agency=Agence France Presse |publisher=Iiss.org |date=July 18, 2006 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezbollah possesses the [[Katyusha rocket launcher|Katyusha-122]] rocket, which has a range of 29&amp;nbsp;km (18&amp;nbsp;mi) and carries a 15-kg (33-lb) warhead. Hezbollah also possesses about 100 long-range missiles. They include the Iranian-made [[Fajr-3]] and [[Fajr-5]], the latter with a range of {{convert|75|km|mi|abbr=on}}, enabling it to strike the Israeli port of [[Haifa]], and the [[Zelzal-1]], with an estimated {{convert|150|km|mi|abbr=on}} range, which can reach [[Tel Aviv]]. Fajr-3 missiles have a range of {{convert|40|km|mi|abbr=on}} and a 45-kg (99-lb) warhead, and Fajr-5 missiles, which extend to {{convert|72|km|mi|abbr=on}}, also hold 45-kg (99-lb) warheads.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hezbollah force&quot;/&gt; It was reported that Hezbollah is in possession of [[Scud]] missiles that were provided to them by Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harel |first=Amos |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1162658.html |title=Syria is shipping Scud missiles to Hezbollah |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=April 13, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reports were denied by Syria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1163279.html |title=Syria: Israel's Scud accusation may be pretense for attack |work=Haaretz |location=Israel |date=October 25, 2008 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to various reports, Hezbollah is armed with [[anti-tank guided missile]]s, namely, the Russian-made [[AT-3 Sagger]], [[AT-4 Spigot]], [[AT-5 Spandrel]], [[Metis-M|AT-13 Saxhorn-2 'Metis-M']], [[9M133 Kornet|ÐÐ¢-14 Spriggan 'Kornet']]; [[Iran]]ian-made [[RAAD (missile)|Ra'ad]] (version of [[AT-3 Sagger]]), Towsan (version of [[AT-5 Spandrel]]), [[Toophan]] (version of [[BGM-71 TOW]]); and European-made [[MILAN]] missiles.

===Current estimates===
{{asof|2010}}, the Israeli government believed Hezbollah had an arsenal of more than 15,000 long-range rockets stationed on its border with Lebanon. Some of these missiles were said to be capable of penetrating cities as far away as [[Eilat]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Jpost&quot;&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=187022 Israeli US envoy: Hizbullah has 15,000 rockets on border].

===Public opinion===
According to [[Michel Samaha]], Lebanonâs minister of information, Hezbollah is seen as a legitimate resistance organization that has defended its land against an Israeli occupying force and has consistently stood up to the Israeli army.&lt;ref name=nybooks/&gt;

According to a survey released by the &quot;Beirut Center for Research and Information&quot; on July 26 during the [[2006 Lebanon War]], 87 percent of Lebanese support Hezbollah's &quot;retaliatory attacks on northern Israel&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Beirut Center for Research and Information (July 29, 2006).

===Designation as a terrorist organization or resistance movement===
Hezbollahâs status as a legitimate political party, a terrorist group, a resistance movement, or some combination thereof is a contentious issue.

In 1999, Hezbollah was placed on the US State Department list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.

During the [[2011 Bahraini protests]], Bahrain [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Bahrain)|foreign minister]] [[Khalid ibn Ahmad Al Khalifah]] labeled Hezbollah a terrorist group and accused them of supporting the protesters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/143281|title=Bahrain: Hizbullah a Terrorist Group|last=Queenann|first=Gavriel|date=March 31, 2011|work=Israel National News|publisher=Arutz Sheva|accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bahrain&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Spangler |first=Timothy |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=213829 |title=Bahrain complains over Hezbollah comments on protests |publisher=Jpost.com |date=2011-03-25 |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2011 Syrian uprising]] Hezbollah's has voiced support for Syrian President [[Bashar Assad]]'s government, which has prompted criticism from anti-government Syrians. As Hezbollah supported other movements in the context of the [[Arab Spring]], anti-government Syrians have stated that they feel &quot;betrayed&quot; by a double standard allegedly applied by the movement. When during the summer of 2011 the violence in Syria escalated further, Hezbollah avoided talking about Syriaâs uprising.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karam&quot; /&gt;

====In Lebanon====
Following the 2006 Lebanon war, other Lebanese including the government were resentful of the large damage sustained by the country and saw Hizbullahâs actions as unjustified &quot;dangerous adventurism&quot; rather than legitimate resistance. They accused Hezbollah of acting on behalf of Iran and Syria.&lt;ref&gt;Bologna Center Journal of International Affairs, Volume 13 / Spring 2010, Hizbullah and Lebanese Nationalism, Faysal Itani [http://bcjournal.org/2007/hizbullah-and-lebanese-nationalism/]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, Lebanon's cabinet completed a policy statement which recognized &quot;the right of Lebanon's people, army, and resistance to liberate the Israeli-occupied Shebaa Farms, Kafar Shuba Hills, and the Lebanese section of Ghajar village, and defend the country using all legal and possible means.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nafez Qawas, ''[[Daily Star (Lebanon)|The Daily Star]]'' (August 6, 2008).

[[Gebran Tueni]], a conservative, Orthodox Christian editor of [[an-Nahar]], referred to Hezbollah as an &quot;Iranian import and said âthey have nothing to do with Arab civilization.â TuenÃ­ believed that Hezbollahâs evolution is cosmetic, concealing a sinister long-term strategy to Islamicize Lebanon and lead it into a ruinous war with Israel. âAsk Mr. Nasrallah whether there would be a place for Christians in the Islamic Republic of Lebanon,â he said, âYou might remind him that we are not an external force. Weâve been here longer than the Muslimsâwe are not [[Afrikaners]]!&quot;&lt;ref name=nybooks/&gt;

Tueni was assassinated in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freemedia.at/singleview/5664/ FEATURE: In Lebanon, Murdered Journalists Also Deserve Justice]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demonstrators were shouting, âSyria wants freedom,â âAnyone who kills his people is a murderer and a coward,â and âthe people want an end to the regime.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spangler |first=Timothy |url=http://www.jpost.com/MiddleEast/Article.aspx?id=233279 |title=Syria uprising stirs old divisions in neighboring Lebanon |publisher=Jpost.com |date= |accessdate=2011-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scholarly views====
Some American and Israeli academics specializing in a wide variety of the social sciences believe that Hezbollah is an example of an Islamic terrorist organization. The Americans include former U.S. Secretary of State and current political science professor [[Condoleezza Rice]], Lebanese-born terrorism scholar [[Walid Phares]], historian [[Mark LeVine]], and journalist Donna Rosenthal.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Iran has been the country that has been in many ways a kind of central banker for terrorism in important regions like Lebanon through Hezbollah.&quot; Rice, Condoleezza. qtd. by Bruno, [http://www.cfr.org/publication/9362/state_sponsors.html &quot;State Sponsors: Iran.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Walid Phares|Phares, Walid]].

In 2011, a bipartisan group of American congresspersons introduced the Hezbollah Anti-Terrorism Act.  The act ensures that no American aid to Lebanon will enter the hands of Hezbollah.  On the day of the act's introduction, Congressman [[Darrell Issa]] said, &quot;Hezbollah is a terrorist group and a cancer on Lebanon.
