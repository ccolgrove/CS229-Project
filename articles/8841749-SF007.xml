The '''iPhone''' ({{pron-en|ËaÉªfoÊn}} {{respell|EYE|fohn}}) is a line of Internet and [[multimedia]]-enabled [[smartphone]]s marketed by [[Apple Inc.]] The [[iPhone (original)|first iPhone]] was unveiled by [[Steve Jobs]], then CEO of Apple, on January 9, 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.macworld.com/article/54769/2007/01/iphone.html |title=Apple unveils iPhone |date=January 9, 2007 |accessdate=April 6, 2008 |author=Honan, Mathew |work=[[Macworld]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and released on June 29, 2007. The 5th generation iPhone, the [[iPhone 4S]], was announced on October 4, 2011, and released on October 14, 2011.

An iPhone can function as a [[video camera]] (video recording was not a standard feature until the [[iPhone 3GS]] was released), a [[camera phone]], a [[portable media player]], and an Internet client with email and [[web browser|web browsing]] capabilities, can send [[text messaging|texts]] and receive [[visual voicemail]], and has both [[Wi-Fi]] and [[3G]] connectivity. The [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]] rather than a physical one. Third-party as well as Apple [[application software]] is available from the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], which launched in mid-2008 and now has over 500,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple Inc. |url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/ios4/ |title=iPhone â Learn about apps available on the App Store |publisher=Apple |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;apps&quot; approved by Apple. These apps have diverse functions, including [[Video game|games]], [[reference work|reference]], [[GPS navigation software|GPS navigation]], [[Social network service|social networking]], security and advertising for television shows, films, and [[Celebrity|celebrities]].

There are five [[List of iOS devices#iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the five major releases of [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] (formerly iPhone OS). The [[iPhone (original)|original iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone that established design precedents like screen size and button placement that have persisted through all models. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] cellular network capabilities and [[A-GPS]] [[W3C Geolocation API|location]]. The [[iPhone 3GS]] added a compass, faster [[Central processing unit|processor]], and higher resolution camera, including video recording at [[480p]]. The [[iPhone 4]] has a rear facing camera ([[720p]] video) and a front facing camera (at a lower resolution) for [[FaceTime]] video calling and for use in other apps like [[Skype]]. The iPhone 4 featured a higher-resolution 960x640 display; it was released on June 24, 2010. In the U.S., [[AT&amp;T]] was the only authorized carrier until February 10, 2011, when a [[CDMA2000|CDMA]] version of the iPhone 4 launched for [[Verizon Wireless|Verizon]]. On October 4, 2011, Apple announced the [[iPhone 4S]].&lt;ref&gt;iPhone 4S launched by Apple http://www.skoolboyz.in/2011/10/iphone-4s-next-iphone-launched-in-lets.html&lt;/ref&gt; The [[iPhone 4S]] added a higher resolution camera (8 [[megapixel]]) with [[1080p]] video recording, [[face detection]], and [[Image stabilization|video stabilization]], a faster, dual core processor, multi-standard wireless support (allowing a single handset to operate on networks based on both GSM/UMTS and CDMA technologies), [[GLONASS]] support and a [[Natural language processing|natural language]] [[voice control]] system called [[Siri (software)|Siri]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apple.com/iphone/compare-iphones/ iPhone â Compare].

{{Main|History of the iPhone}}
{{See also|List of iOS devices}}
Development of the iPhone began in 2005 with Apple CEO [[Steve Jobs]]' direction that Apple engineers investigate touchscreens.&lt;ref name=&quot;keynoteMacworld&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=Peter|url=http://www.macworld.com/news/2007/01/09/liveupdate/index.php|title=Macworld Expo Keynote Live Update|work=Macworld|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also steered the original focus away from a tablet, like the [[iPad]], and towards a phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Murtazin|first=Eldar|url=http://mobile-review.com/articles/2010/iphone-history3-en.shtml|title=Apple's Phone: From 1980s' Sketches to iPhone.

Jobs unveiled the iPhone to the public on January 9, 2007 at the [[Macworld Conference &amp; Expo|Macworld]] 2007 convention at the [[Moscone Center]] in San Francisco. The iPhone went on sale in the United States on June 29, 2007, at 6:00&amp;nbsp;pm local time, while hundreds of customers lined up outside the stores nationwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;AppleQ32007&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://images.apple.com/pr/pdf/q307data_sum.pdf|title=Apple Inc.

On July 11, 2008, Apple released the iPhone 3G in twenty-two countries, including the original six.&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone 3G launch countries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipod.about.com/od/iphone3g/a/iphone_3g_rel.htm|title=Initial iPhone 3G Country Availability List|last=Costello|first=Sam|publisher=about.com|accessdate=January 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple released the iPhone 3G in upwards of eighty countries and territories.&lt;!--A precise number would be great!--&gt;&lt;ref name=3G_countries&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/countries/|title=iPhone 3G Coming to countries everywhere|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|accessdate=April 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple announced the iPhone 3GS on June 8, 2009, along with plans to release it later in June, July, and August, starting with the U.S., Canada and major European countries on June 19. Many would-be users objected to the iPhone's cost,&lt;ref name=&quot;NPD demographics&quot;/&gt; and 40% of users have household incomes over US$100,000.&lt;ref name=&quot;Nielsen demographics&quot; /&gt; In an attempt to gain a wider market, Apple retained the 8&amp;nbsp;GB iPhone 3G at a lower price point. When Apple introduced the iPhone 4, the 3GS became the less expensive model. Apple reduced the price several times since the iPhone's release in 2007, at which time an 8&amp;nbsp;GB iPhone sold for $599. An iPhone 3GS with the same capacity now has no cost to the customer, as of the release of the iPhone 4S. However, these numbers are misleading, since all iPhone units sold through AT&amp;T require a two-year contract (costing several thousand dollars and including an early termination fee&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Broache|first=Anne|title=Democrats criticize AT&amp;T's exclusive iPhone deal|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10784_3-9742441-7.html{{!}}title=Democrats|publisher=cnet news|accessdate=March 14, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and a [[#SIM unlocking|SIM lock]].

They both are now discontinued. The iPhone 3GS was available in both colors, regardless of storage capacity. The white model was discontinued in favor of a black 8&amp;nbsp;GB low-end model. The iPhone 4 has an [[aluminosilicate]] glass front and back with a [[stainless steel]] edge that serves as the [[Antenna (radio)|antennas]]. It was at first available in black; the white version was announced, but not released until April 2011, 10 months later.

From left to right, sides: wake/sleep button, SIM card slot, headphone jack, silence switch, volume controls. Top: earpiece, screen.]]

The iPhone has a minimal hardware user interface, featuring only four or five [[Push-button|buttons]], depending on the generation. The only physical menu button is situated directly below the display, and is called the &quot;Home button&quot; because it closes the active app and navigates to the home screen of the interface. The home button is denoted not by a house, as on many other similar devices, but a [[Squircle|rounded square]], reminiscent of the shape of icons on the home screen. A multifunction sleep/wake button is located on the top of the device. It serves as the unit's power button, and also controls [[#Phone|phone calls]]. When a call is received, pressing the sleep/wake button once silences the ringtone, and when pressed twice transfers the call to voicemail. Situated on the left spine are the volume adjustment controls. The iPhone 4 has two separate circular buttons to increase and decrease the volume; all earlier models house two switches under a single plastic panel, known as a rocker switch, which could reasonably be counted as either one or two buttons. Directly above the volume controls is a ring/silent switch that when engaged mutes telephone ringing, alert sounds from new &amp; sent emails, text messages, and other push notifications, camera shutter sounds, Voice Memo sound effects, phone lock/unlock sounds, keyboard clicks, and spoken autocorrections. This switch does not mute alarm sounds from the Clock application, and in some countries or regions it will not mute the camera shutter or Voice Memo sound effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf manuals.info.apple.com/en_US/iphone_user_guide.pdf]. (PDF) . Retrieved on 2011-11-06.&lt;/ref&gt; All buttons except Home were made of plastic on the original iPhone and metal on all later models. The touchscreen furnishes the remainder of the [[#Interface|user interface]].

The display responds to three sensors (four on the iPhone 4). A [[proximity sensor]] deactivates the display and [[touchscreen]] when the device is brought near the face during a call. This is done to save battery power and to prevent inadvertent inputs from the user's face and ears. An ambient light sensor adjusts the display brightness which in turn saves battery power. A 3-axis [[accelerometer]] senses the orientation of the phone and changes the screen accordingly, allowing the user to easily switch between [[page orientation|portrait and landscape]] mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Johnson|first=R.

The 3.0 update added landscape support for still other applications, such as email, and introduced shaking the unit as a form of input.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot; /&gt; The accelerometer can also be used to control [[#Third-party applications|third-party apps]], notably games.

The iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4 employ [[Assisted GPS|A-GPS]], and the iPhone 3GS and 4 also have a [[digital compass]].&lt;ref name=Compass/&gt; iPhone 4S supports [[GLONASS]] global positioning system in addition to GPS.

===Audio and output===
[[File:IPhone-bottom.jpg|thumb|One of two speakers (left) and the microphone (right) surround the [[dock connector]] on the base of the original iPhone. If a headset is plugged in, sound is played through it instead.]]

The bottom of the iPhone sports a speaker (left) and a microphone (right) flanking the dock connector. One loudspeaker is located above the screen as an earpiece, and another is located on the left side of the bottom of the unit, opposite a microphone on the bottom-right. The iPhone 4 includes an additional microphone at the top of the unit for [[Noise-canceling microphone|noise cancellation]], and switches the placement of the microphone and speaker on the base on the unitâthe speaker is on the right.&lt;ref name=&quot;4_tech_specs&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;â Size, weight, battery life, and other specs|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=July 1, 2010|archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5quBTT6io|archivedate=July 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Volume controls are located on the left side of all iPhone models and as a slider in the iPod application.

The 3.5&amp;nbsp;mm [[TRRS connector]]&lt;!--Not a typo, two Rs--&gt; for the headphones is located on the top left corner of the device.&lt;ref name=&quot;TRRS&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Tip+and+ring|title=tip and ring|work=Computer Desktop Encyclopedia|publisher=The Computer Language Company Inc.|accessdate=March 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The headphone socket on the original iPhone is recessed into the casing, making it incompatible with most headsets without the use of an adapter.&lt;ref name=&quot;Original Cnet review&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/Apple/?p=828|title=That damned recessed iPhone headphone jack|publisher=[[ZDNet]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent generations eliminated the issue by using a flush-mounted headphone socket. Cars equipped with an [[Jack (connector)|auxiliary jack]] allow for handsfree use of the iPhone while driving as a substitute for [[Bluetooth]].

While the iPhone is compatible with normal headphones, Apple provides a [[Headset (telephone/computer)|headset]] with additional functionality. A multipurpose button near the microphone can be used to play or pause music, skip tracks, and answer or end phone calls without touching the iPhone. A small number of third-party headsets specifically designed for the iPhone also include the microphone and control button.&lt;ref name=&quot;Review: iPhone headsets&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/133445/2008/05/iphoneheadsets.html|title=Review: iPhone headsets|last=Frakes|first=Dan|date=May 14, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current headsets also provide volume controls, which are only compatible with more recent models.&lt;!--3GS &amp; 4--&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Earbuds with volume&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/us/product/MB770G/B?fnode=MTY1NDA1MA&amp;mco=MTM3NTI1ODk|title=Apple Earphones with Remote and Mic|publisher=Apple Store|accessdate=May 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These features are achieved by a fourth ring in the audio jack that carries this extra information.

The built-in [[Enhanced Data Rate|Bluetooth 2.x+EDR]] supports wireless earpieces and headphones, which requires the [[Bluetooth profile#Headset Profile (HSP)|HSP]] [[Bluetooth profile|profile]]. Stereo audio was added in the 3.0 update for hardware that supports [[A2DP]].&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot; /&gt; While non-sanctioned third-party solutions exist, the iPhone does not officially support the [[OBEX]] [[Bluetooth protocols#Object exchange (OBEX)|file transfer]] [[Bluetooth protocols|protocol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/news/2009/01/ibluetooth-team-achieves-obex-file-transfer.ars|title=iBluetooth team achieves OBEX file transfer|last=Sadun|first=Erica|date=January 26, 2009|publisher=Ars Technica|accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of these profiles prevents iPhone users from exchanging multimedia files, such as pictures, music and videos, with other bluetooth-enabled cell phones.

===Battery===
[[File:IPhone Internals.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Replacing the battery requires opening the iPhone unit and exposing the internal hardware]]
The iPhone features an internal rechargeable lithium-ion battery. Like an iPod, but unlike most other mobile phones, the battery is not user-replaceable.&lt;ref name=&quot;Original Cnet review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/smartphones/apple-iphone-8gb-at/4505-6452_7-32309245.html|title=Apple iPhone&amp;nbsp;â 8&amp;nbsp;GB (AT&amp;T)|last=German|first=Kent|coauthors=Donald Bell |date=June 29, 2007|publisher=Cnet review|pages=1 and 2|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Mobile Burn review&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobileburn.com/review.jsp?Id=3526|title=Review: Apple iPhone, In-Depth|last=Oryl|first=Michael|date=July 3, 2007|publisher=Mobile Burn|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone can be charged when connected to a computer for syncing across the included USB to dock connector cable, similar to [[IPod - connectivity|charging an iPod]]. Alternatively, a USB to AC adapter (or &quot;wall charger,&quot; also included) can be connected to the cable to charge directly from an [[AC power plugs and sockets|AC outlet]]. A number of third-party accessories (car chargers, portable chargers, battery cases, stereo dock chargers, and even [[Solar power|solar]] chargers) are also available.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Apple runs tests on preproduction units to determine battery life. Apple's website says that the battery life &quot;is designed to retain up to 80 percent of its original capacity after 400 full charge and discharge cycles&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/batteries/iphone.html|title=BatteriesâiPhone|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is comparable to iPod batteries.

The battery life of early models of the iPhone has been criticized by several technology journalists as insufficient and less than Apple's claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arstechnica.com/apple/reviews/2008/07/iphone3g-review.ars/6|title=The Second Coming: Ars goes in-depth with the iPhone 3G|publisher=Ars Technica|author=Cheng, Jacqui|coauthors=Chartier, David; Ecker, Clint|date=July 14, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5024412/iphone-3g-review|title=iPhone 3G Review|author=Lam, Brian|publisher=Gizmodo|date=July 11, 2008|unused_data=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/09/AR2008070900177.html|title=First iPhone 3G Reviews: Mossberg: Battery 'Significant Problem'; Pogue: Limited 3G, Good Audio|author=Kramer, Staci D.|work=The Washington Post |date=July 9, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://ptech.allthingsd.com/20080708/newer-faster-cheaper-iphone-3g|title=Newer, Faster, Cheaper iPhone 3G|author=Mossberg, Walter S|authorlink=Walter Mossberg|work=The Wall Street Journal |date=July 8, 2008|accessdate=June 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also reflected by a [[J.

These kits often include a small screwdriver and an instruction leaflet, but as with many newer iPod models the battery in the original iPhone has been [[solder]]ed in. Therefore a soldering iron is required to install the new battery. The iPhone 3G uses a different battery fitted with a connector that is easier to replace.&lt;ref name=&quot;3G quasi-replaceable battery&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gizmodo.com/5023983/the-iphone-3g-battery-is-quasi+replaceable|title=The iPhone 3G Battery Is Quasi-Replaceable|last=Wilson|first=Mark|date=July 10, 2008|work=Gizmodo|accessdate=January 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Camera===
The original iPhone and iPhone 3G feature a built-in [[Fixed focus]] 2.0&amp;nbsp;[[megapixel]] camera located on the back for still digital photos. It has no optical zoom, flash or [[autofocus]], and does not support video recording (iPhone 3G does support video recording via third-party App available on the App Store), however [[#Third-party applications|jailbreaking]] allows users to do so. Version 2.0 of iPhone OS introduced the capability to [[geotagging|embed location data]] in the pictures, producing [[geocoded photograph]]s.

The iPhone 3GS has a 3.2&amp;nbsp;megapixel camera, manufactured by [[OmniVision Technologies|OmniVision]], featuring autofocus, auto white balance, and auto macro (up to 10&amp;nbsp;cm). It is also capable of capturing 640x480 ([[Display resolution|VGA]] resolution) video at 30 frames per second,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/iphone3gs-specs.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone 3Gs&amp;nbsp;â Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=June 21, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; although compared to higher-end [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] based video cameras it does exhibit the [[rolling shutter]] effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.handheldhollywood.com/latest-news/foundrys-rollingshutter-can-fix-iphone-jellocam.html|title=Foundry's RollingShutter can Fix iPhone Jellocam|date=November 16, 2009|publisher=Hand Held Hollywood|accessdate=February 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video can then be [[video editing|cropped]] on the device itself and directly uploaded to YouTube, [[MobileMe]], or other services

The iPhone 4 introduced a 5.0&amp;nbsp;[[megapixel]] camera (2592x1936 pixels), also located on the back, which is equipped with a [[Backside illumination|backside illuminated]] sensor capable of capturing pictures in low-light conditions, as well as an [[Light-emitting diode|LED]] [[Flash (photography)|flash]] capable of staying lit for video recording at [[720p]] resolution, considered [[High-definition video|high-definition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/specs.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;â Technical Specifications|publisher=Apple Inc|accessdate=June 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the iPhone 4 has a second camera on the front capable of [[Display resolution|VGA]] photos and [[Standard-definition television|SD]] video recording.

Regardless of the source, saved recordings may be synced to the host computer, attached to email, or (where supported) sent by [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]]. Videos may be uploaded to YouTube directly.

The camera on the iPhone 4S is capable of shooting 8MP stills and recording 1080p videos. The camera can now be accessed directly from the lock screen, and the volume up button as a shutter trigger. The built-in gyroscope is able to stabilize the camera while recording video.

Beta code pulled from iOS 5 suggests that the next feature to be released will allow users to capture a panoramic photo on their iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;Josh Lowensohn, CNET. &quot;[http://news.cnet.com/8301-27076_3-20079537-248/more-signs-of-an-iphone-panorama-tool-emerge/ More signs of an iPhone panorama tool emerge].&quot; July 14, 2011.

===Storage and SIM===
[[File:Iphonesimcard.JPG|thumb|An iPhone 3G with the SIM slot open. The SIM ejector tool is still placed in the eject hole.]]

The iPhone was initially released with two options for internal storage size: 4&amp;nbsp;GB or 8&amp;nbsp;GB.

The iPhone 3GS came in 16&amp;nbsp;GB and 32&amp;nbsp;GB variants and still is available in 8&amp;nbsp;GB. The iPhone 4 is available in 16&amp;nbsp;GB and 32&amp;nbsp;GB variants, as well as a newly introduced 8 GB variant to be sold along side the iPhone 4S at a reduced price point. The iPhone 4S is available in three sizes: 16&amp;nbsp;GB, 32&amp;nbsp;GB and 64&amp;nbsp;GB.  All data is stored on the internal flash drive; the iPhone does not support expanded storage through a memory card slot, or the SIM card.

[[GSM]] Models of the iPhone use a [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM card]] to identify themselves to the GSM network. The SIM sits in a tray, which is inserted into a slot at the top of the device. The SIM tray can be ejected with a paperclip or the &quot;SIM eject tool&quot; (a simple piece of die-cut sheet metal) included with the iPhone 3G and 3GS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1438|title=Removing SIM card|publisher=Apple Inc|date=July 10, 2008|accessdate=June 11, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diaz|first=Jesus|title=iPhone 3G's New SIM Ejector Tool Makes It Instant Must-Buy|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=June 9, 2008|url=http://gizmodo.com/5014767/iphone-3gs-new-sim-ejector-tool-makes-it-instant-must+buy|accessdate=June 24, 2008}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most countries, the iPhone is usually sold with a [[#SIM unlocking|SIM lock]], which prevents the iPhone from being used on a different mobile network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrier unlocking list&quot;/&gt;

The [[GSM]] iPhone 4 features a [[MicroSIM]] card that is located in a slot on the right side of the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Apple Inc. |url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html |title=iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;â Size, weight, battery life, and other specs |publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[CDMA]] model of the iPhone, like all CDMA phones, does not use a SIM.

===Liquid contact indicators===
The iPhone is equipped with liquid contact indicators which change from white to red in color when they come in contact with water. These suggest whether water damage has affected the device. The indicators on the iPhone include a small disc which is located at the bottom of the headphone [[jack (connector)|jack]] and with the iPhone 3G and all later models an additional one is located at the bottom of the [[dock connector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=iPhone and iPod: Liquid damage is not covered by warranty|work=[[Apple Inc.]]|date=August 27, 2010|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT3302?viewlocale=en_US|accessdate=December 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The indicators are often used by Apple employees to determine whether the device [[AppleCare|qualifies]] for a warranty repair or replacement. If the indicators show that the device was exposed to water, they may determine that the device is not covered by Apple. However, the liquid contact indicators may be triggered through routine use, and if a device is worn while exercising, the sweat from an owner may dampen the indicators enough to indicate water damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=David Martin|title=Sweaty workouts killing iPhones?|publisher=[[Cnet]]|date=April 8, 2009|url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10214153-233.html|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On many other mobile phones from different manufacturers, the liquid contact indicators are located in a protected location, such as beneath the battery behind a battery cover, but the indicators on an iPhone are directly exposed to the environment. This has led to criticism of the placement of the indicators, which may also be affected by steam in a bathroom or other light environmental moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lisa Respers|title=Moisture, cold irritate some smart phone users|publisher=CNN|date=April 14, 2009|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/14/smart.phones.buggy/index.html|accessdate=November 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to these criticisms, Apple made a silent change to their water damage policy for iPhones and similar products. This new policy allows the customer to request further internal inspection of the phone to verify if internal liquid damage sensors were triggered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bgr.com/2010/11/09/apple-amends-internal-ipod-water-damage-policy/|title=Apple Amends Internal iPod Water Damage Policy|last=Epstein|first=Zach|date=November 9, 2010|work=Boy Genius Report|accessdate=January 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:IPhone 4 box no lid.JPG|thumb|The contents of the box of an iPhone 4. From left to right: iPhone 4 in plastic holder, written documentation, and (top to bottom) headset, USB cable, wall charger.]]
All [[iPhone models]] include written documentation, and a [[dock connector]] to [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cable. The original and 3G iPhones also came with a cleaning cloth. The original iPhone included stereo [[Headset (telephone/computer)|headset]] ([[headphones|earbuds]] and a microphone) and a plastic dock to hold the unit upright while charging and syncing. The iPhone 3G includes a similar headset plus a SIM eject tool (the original model requires a paperclip).

==Software==
{{Main|iOS (Apple)|iOS version history}}
[[File:IOS43GS.PNG|thumb|upright|The default Home screen of iOS 4.2.1 shows most of the applications provided by Apple. Users can download additional applications from the App store, create Web Clips, rearrange the icons, and create and delete folders.]]
The iPhone, [[iPod Touch]] and [[iPad]] run an [[operating system]] known as [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] (formerly iPhone OS). It is a variant of the same [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]] operating system core that is found in [[Mac OS X]]. Also included is the &quot;[[Core Animation]]&quot; software component from [[Mac OS X v10.5]] Leopard. Together with the [[PowerVR]] hardware (and on the iPhone 3GS, [[OpenGL ES]] 2.0), it is responsible for the interface's [[motion graphics]]. The operating system takes up less than half a [[gigabyte]].&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash&gt;{{cite web|last=Haslam|first=Karen|url=http://www.macworld.co.uk/ipod-itunes/news/index.cfm?newsid=16927|title=Macworld Expo: Optimised OS X sits on 'versatile' flash|work=Macworld|date=January 12, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is capable of supporting bundled and future applications from Apple, as well as from third-party developers. Software applications cannot be copied directly from Mac OS X but must be written and compiled specifically for iOS.

Like the iPod, the iPhone is managed from a computer using [[iTunes]]. The earliest versions of the OS required [[iTunes version history|version 7.3 or later]], which is compatible with Mac OS X version 10.3.9 Panther or later, and 32-bit [[Windows XP]] or [[Windows Vista|Vista]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305703|title=iPhone: Minimum system requirements|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=July 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The release of iTunes 7.6 expanded this support to include 64-bit versions of XP and Vista,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple's iTunes 7.6 plays nice with 64 bit Vista|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/01/15/apples-itunes-7-6-plays-nice-with-64-bit-vista/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=January 15, 2008|accessdate=January 22, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a workaround has been discovered for previous 64-bit Windows operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planetamd64.com/index.php?showtopic=35132&amp;st=0&amp;p=327771&amp;#entry327771|title=iTunes is now 64-bit|publisher=PlanetAMD64}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple provides free updates to the OS for the iPhone through iTunes,&lt;ref name=VersatileFlash/&gt; and major updates have historically accompanied new models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworldcanada.ca/news/feature/to-upgrade-or-not-the-iphone-3g-s-dilemma/130d25f1c0a8000600b4bb6582434a58/pg001.htm|title=To Upgrade or Not: the iPhone 3G S Dilemma|work=Macworld Canada|date=June 24, 2009|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such updates often require a newer version of iTunes&amp;nbsp;â for example, the 3.0 update requires iTunes 8.2&amp;nbsp;â but the iTunes system requirements have stayed the same.

===Interface===
The [[Graphical user interface|interface]] is based around the home screen, a graphical list of available applications. iPhone applications normally run one at a time (not including iOS 4 and iOS 5, which includes running applications in the background),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techie-buzz.com/mobile-news/how-to-multitask-in-ios4-on-iphone-ipod-touch.html |title=How To Multitask in iOS4 on iPhone, iPod Touch |publisher=Techie-buzz.com |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed at any time by a hardware button below the screen, closing the open application in the process.&lt;ref name=&quot;home screen&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/homescreen.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Features&amp;nbsp;â Home screen|year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By default, the Home screen contains the following icons: Messages ([[Short message service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings, [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], and (on the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4) [[Compass]]. Docked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and iPod ([[multimedia]]) delineate the iPhone's main purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create &quot;Web Clips&quot;, home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.&lt;ref name=&quot;Update 1.1.3&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Users can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. Each home screen holds up to sixteen icons, and the dock holds up to four icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time, and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs, however, may not be removed. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot;/&gt;

Almost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands [[multi-touch gestures|complex gestures using multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction techniques]] enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as &quot;[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]&quot;. Scrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface simulates the physics of a real object. Other [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program, but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a &quot;back&quot; button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.

===Phone===
[[File:IPhone call screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options; including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]
The iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out, and fades back in when the call has ended. The [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches. The iPhone does not support [[Videophone|video calling]] or [[videoconferencing]] on versions prior to the fourth generation, as there is only one camera on the opposite side of the screen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/08/13/mirror-based-video-conferencing-developed-for-iphone/|title=Mirror-based video conferencing developed for iPhone|first=Donald|last=Melanson|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=September 13, 2007|accessdate=December 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone 4 supports video calling using either the front or back camera over Wi-Fi, a feature Apple calls [[FaceTime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/facetime.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone 4&amp;nbsp;â One-tap video calling with FaceTime on iPhone 43|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first two models only support [[voice command device|voice dialing]] through third-party applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137421/2008/12/voicedialers.html|title=Review: iPhone voice dialers|last=Tessler|first=Franklin|date=December 12, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice control, available only on the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4, allows users to say a contact's name or number and the iPhone will dial.&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice_Control&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/voice-control.html|title=iPhone: Make calls and play music using voice control|date=June 10, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 10, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone includes a [[visual voicemail]] (in some countries)&lt;ref name=&quot;VV_abroad&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilounge.com/index.php/news/comments/iphone-3g-carriers-apple-vary-on-visual-voicemail/|title=iPhone 3G carriers, Apple vary on Visual Voicemail|last=Starrett |first=Charles|date=June 11, 2008|publisher=[[iLounge]]|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; feature allowing users to view a list of current voicemail messages on-screen without having to call into their voicemail. Unlike most other systems, messages can be listened to and deleted in a non-chronological order by choosing any message from an on-screen list.

A music [[ringtone]] feature was introduced in the United States on September 5, 2007. Users can create custom ringtones from songs purchased from the iTunes Store for a small additional fee. The ringtones can be 3 to 30 seconds long from any part of a song, can fade in and out, pause from half a second to five seconds when looped, or [[infinite loop|loop continuously]]. All customizing can be done in iTunes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/09/05itunes.html|title=Apple Unveils the iTunes Wi-Fi Music Store|date=November 5, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; or alternatively with Apple's [[GarageBand]] software 4.1.1 or later (available only on [[Mac OS X]])&lt;ref name=GarageBand1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=307108|title=How to create custom ringtones in GarageBand 4.1.1|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; or third-party tools.&lt;ref name=&quot;third party ringtones&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilbertson|first=Scott|title=How to Make Custom IPhone Ringtones Without Paying Apple $2|url=http://www.wired.com/software/coolapps/news/2007/09/ringtone_hacks|work=[[Wired magazine]]|date=September 12, 2007|accessdate=March 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multimedia===
The layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]] or current [[Symbian OS|Symbian]] [[S60 platform|S60]] phones. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are always presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection. Users can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Voice_Control&quot;/&gt;

The iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797|title=What is Gapless Playback?|accessdate=May 13, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[fullscreen]] video playback.

The iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone. The feature originally required a Wi-Fi network, but now{{When|date=July 2010}} can use the cellular data network if one is not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://daringfireball.net/linked/2007/september#thu-27-wifi|title=The Reason It's Called the Wi-Fi Music Store|date=September 30, 2007|accessdate=January 6, 2008|first=John|last=Gruber|publisher=[[Daring Fireball]]|authorlink=John Gruber|work=Linked List}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The iPhone includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the [[#Camera|camera]]. The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from [[iPhoto]] or [[Aperture (photography software)|Aperture]] on a Mac, or [[Adobe Photoshop|Photoshop]] on a Windows [[personal computer|PC]].

===Internet connectivity===
[[File:Wikipedia on iPhone's Safari.png|thumb|Wikipedia Main Page on the iPhone [[Safari (web browser)|Safari web browser]] in landscape mode]]

Internet access is available when the iPhone is connected to a local area [[Wi-Fi]] or a wide area [[GSM]] or [[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution|EDGE]] network, both second-generation ([[2G]]) wireless data standards. The iPhone 3G introduced support for third-generation [[Universal Mobile Telecommunications System|UMTS]] and [[High-Speed Downlink Packet Access|HSDPA]] 3.6,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearlog.com/2008/07/apples_joswiak_iphone_3g_runs.php|title=Apple's Joswiak: iPhone 3G Runs Fast HSDPA 3.6, Not Slower 1.8|publisher=Gearlog|accessdate=October 12, 2008}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only the iPhone 4S supports [[High-Speed Uplink Packet Access|HSUPA]] networks (14.4 Mbps), and only the iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 support HSDPA 7.2.&lt;ref name=&quot;Macworld_3G_S&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141031/2009/06/iphone3gs.html |title=iPhone 3GS offers speed boost, video capture|last=Michaels|first=Philip|coauthors=Jason Snell|date=June 8, 2009|work=Macworld|accessdate=June 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; AT&amp;T introduced [[3G]] in July 2004,&lt;ref name=&quot;3G rollout&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2004/07/20/at-t-wireless-introduces-3g-wireless/|title=AT&amp;T Wireless introduces 3G wireless|last=Rojas|first=Peter|date=July 20, 2004|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=December 17, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as late as 2007, [[Steve Jobs]] stated that it was still not widespread enough in the US, and the chipsets not energy efficient enough, to be included in the iPhone.&lt;ref name=pogueFAQ /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macnn.com/articles/07/09/18/jobs.uk.cell.carrier.qa/|title=Jobs: battery life issues delaying 3G iPhone|publisher=MacNN|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for [[802.1X]], an authentication system commonly used by university and corporate Wi-Fi networks, was added in the 2.0 version update.&lt;ref name=&quot;802.1x&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/au/iphone/enterprise/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Enterprise|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2008}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By default, the iPhone will ask to join newly discovered [[Wi-Fi]] networks and prompt for the password when required. Alternatively, it can join closed Wi-Fi networks manually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306249|title=iPhone: About Connections Settings|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone will automatically choose the strongest network, connecting to Wi-Fi instead of EDGE when it is available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305711|title=iPhone: Connecting to the Internet with EDGE or Wi-Fi|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the iPhone 3G, 3GS and 4 prefer [[3G]] to [[2G]], and Wi-Fi to either.&lt;ref name=&quot;3GSpeeds&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/wireless.html|title=Apple -iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Features&amp;nbsp;â 3G |year=2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wi-Fi, [[Bluetooth]], and 3G (on the iPhone 3G, 3GS, and 4) can all be deactivated individually. [[Flight mode|Airplane mode]] disables all wireless connections at once, overriding other preferences. However, once in Airplane mode, one can explicitly enable Wi-Fi and/or Bluetooth modes to join and continue to operate over one or both of those networks while the cellular network transceivers remain off.

The iPhone 3GS has a maximum download rate of 7.2&amp;nbsp;[[Mbit/s]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/141092/2009/06/iphone3gs_72&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s.html|title=iPhone 3G S features 7.2&amp;nbsp;Mbit/s, AT&amp;T's network does not|date=June 10, 2009|accessdate=May 16, 2010|work=Macworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, email attachments as well as apps and media from Apple's various stores must be smaller than 20&amp;nbsp;MB to be downloaded over a cellular network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/story/apple-raises-iphone-download-limit-to-20&amp;nbsp;mb/19365036/|title=Apple Increases iPhone Download Limit to 20&amp;nbsp;MB|date=February 19, 2010|accessdate=May 16, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger files, often email attachments or podcasts, must be downloaded over Wi-Fi (which has no file size limits). If Wi-Fi is unavailable, one [[workaround]] is to open the files directly in [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]].&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone: Beat 10&amp;nbsp;MB 3G download limit&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://reviews.cnet.co.uk/natelanxon/0,139102300,49300138,00.htm|title=iPhone: Beat 10&amp;nbsp;MB 3G download limit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] is the iPhone's native [[web browser]], and it displays pages similar to its Mac and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] counterparts. Web pages may be viewed in portrait or landscape mode and the device supports automatic zooming by pinching together or spreading apart fingertips on the screen, or by double-tapping text or images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=305899|title=iPhone: Zooming In to See a Page More easily|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 4, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://solution.allthingsd.com/20070626/the-iphone-is-breakthrough-handheld-computer/|title=The iPhone Is a Breakthrough Handheld Computer|author=Walter S.

The maps application can access [[Google Maps]] in map, [[satellite imagery|satellite]], or hybrid form. It can also generate directions between two locations, while providing optional real-time traffic information. During the iPhone's announcement, Jobs demonstrated this feature by searching for nearby [[Starbucks]] locations and then placing a [[prank call]] to one with a single tap.&lt;ref name=keynoteMacworld /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;keynoteEngadget&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Block|first=Ryan|url=http://www.engadget.com/2007/01/09/live-from-macworld-2007-steve-jobs-keynote/|title=Live from Macworld 2007: Steve Jobs keynote|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for walking directions, public transit, and [[Google Street View|street view]] was added in the version 2.2 software update, but no voice-guided navigation.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.2&quot; /&gt; The iPhone 3GS and iPhone 4 can orient the map with its digital compass.&lt;ref name=&quot;Compass&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/maps-compass.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Get directions with GPS maps and a new compass|date=June 8, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple also developed a separate application to view YouTube videos on the iPhone, which streams videos after encoding them using the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC|H.264]] codec. Simple weather and [[stock quote]]s applications also tap in to the Internet.

iPhone users can and do access the Internet frequently, and in a variety of places. According to [[Google]], in 2008, the iPhone generated 50 times more search requests than any other mobile handset.&lt;ref name=&quot;GoogleSearches&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Lane|first=Slash|url=http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/08/02/14/google_iphone_usage_shocks_search_giant.html|title=Google iPhone usage shocks search giant|publisher=[[AppleInsider]]|date=February 14, 2008|accessdate=February 18, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Deutsche Telekom]] CEO [[RenÃ© Obermann]], &quot;The average [[Internet usage]] for an iPhone customer is more than 100&amp;nbsp;[[megabyte]]s.

With the introduction of the Verizon iPhone in January 2011, the issue of using internet while on the phone has been brought to the public's attention. Under the two US carriers, internet and phone could be used simultaneously on ATT networks, whereas the Verizon networks only support for the use of each separately.&lt;ref name=&quot;TUAW&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuaw.com/2011/01/11/verizon-iphone-cant-handle-data-and-voice-simultaneously|title=Verizon iPhone Can't Handle Data and Voice Simultaneously|last=Sande|first=Steven|date=January 11, 2011|work=The Unofficial Apple Weblog|publisher=AOL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Text input===
[[Image:IPhone keyboard unblurred.jpg|thumb|The [[virtual keyboard]] on the original iPhone [[touchscreen]].]]

For text input, the iPhone implements a [[virtual keyboard]] on the touchscreen. It has automatic [[spell checker|spell checking]] and correction, [[Predictive text|predictive word]] capabilities, and a dynamic dictionary that learns new words. The keyboard can predict what word the user is typing and complete it, and correct for the accidental pressing of keys near the presumed desired key.&lt;ref name=hasAKeyboard&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=John Markoff|last=Markoff|first=John|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/13/technology/13phone.ready.html|title=That iPhone Has a Keyboard, but It's Not Mechanical|work=The New York Times |date=June 13, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The keys are somewhat larger and spaced farther apart when in [[landscape mode]], which is supported by only a limited number of applications. Touching a section of text for a brief time brings up a [[magnifying glass]], allowing users to place the [[cursor (computers)|cursor]] in the middle of existing text. The virtual keyboard can accommodate 21 languages, including character recognition for Chinese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keyboard&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/keyboard.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Features&amp;nbsp;â Keyboard|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate characters with accents can be typed from the keyboard by pressing the letter for 2 seconds and selecting the alternate character from the popup.&lt;ref name=&quot;KeyboardAlternateLetters&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/tips/|title=Apple â iPhone â Tips and Tricks|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 3.0 update brought support for [[cut, copy, and paste|cut, copy, or pasting]] text, as well as landscape keyboards in more applications.&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 official&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;3.0 Macworld&quot; /&gt; On iPhone 4S, Siri allows dictation.

===Email and text messages===
The iPhone also features an email program that supports [[HTML email]], which enables the user to embed photos in an email message.

Text messages are presented chronologically in a mailbox format similar to Mail, which places all text from recipients together with replies. Text messages are displayed in speech bubbles (similar to [[iChat]]) under each recipient's name. The iPhone has built-in support for emailmessage forwarding, drafts, and direct internal camera-to-email picture sending.

===Third-party applications===
:''See also: [[iOS SDK]] and [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]]'' &lt;!--Not templated due to piped link.--&gt;

At [[Worldwide Developers Conference#WWDC 2007|WWDC 2007]] on June 11, 2007, Apple announced that the iPhone would support [[third-party developer|third-party]] &quot;web applications&quot; written in [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] that share the look and feel of the iPhone interface.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web apps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2007/06/11iphone.html|title=iPhone to Support Third-Party Web 2.0 Applications|date=June 11, 2007|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 17, 2007, Steve Jobs, in an open letter posted to Apple's &quot;Hot News&quot; [[weblog]], announced that a [[software development kit]] (SDK) would be made available to third-party developers in February 2008. The iPhone SDK was officially announced and released on March 6, 2008, at the Apple Town Hall facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2008/03/06/live-from-apples-iphone-press-conference/|title=Live from Apple's iPhone SDK press conference|publisher=[[Engadget]]|date=March 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a free download, with an Apple registration, that allows developers to develop native applications for the iPhone and iPod Touch, then test them in an &quot;iPhone simulator&quot;. However, loading an application onto a real device is only possible after paying an [[Apple Developer Connection]] membership fee. Developers are free to set any price for their applications to be distributed through the [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]], of which they will receive a 70% share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Michelle |last=Quinn |title=Apple will open App Store in bid to boost iPhone sales |url=http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-iphone10-2008jul10,0,3798678.story |work=Los Angeles Times |date=July 10, 2008 |accessdate=July 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Developers can also opt to release the application for free and will not pay any costs to release or distribute the application beyond the membership fee. The App Store was launched with the release of iOS 2.0, on July 11, 2008.&lt;ref name=releasedate&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/06/09iphone.html|title=Apple Introduces the New iPhone 3G|quote=iPhone 2.0 software will be available on July 11 as a free software update via iTunes 7.7 or later for all iPhone customers|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=June 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The update was free for iPhone users; owners of older iPod Touches were required to pay US$10 for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/134502/2008/07/ipodtouch.html|title=Is the iPod touch 2.0 update worth $10?|last=Breen|first=Christopher|date=July 15, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a developer has submitted an application to the App Store, Apple holds firm control over its distribution. Apple can halt the distribution of applications it deems inappropriate, for example, [[I Am Rich]], a US$1000 program that simply demonstrated the wealth of its user.&lt;ref name=&quot;wsj_article&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://wsj.com/article/SB121842341491928977.html| title=IPhone Software Sales Take Off: Apple's Jobs |accessdate=September 3, 2008 |archiveurl=http://justamp.blogspot.com/2008/08/iphone-software-sales-take-off-apples.html|archivedate=August 11, 2008 |work=The Wall Street Journal | date=August 11, 2008 | first=Nick | last=Wingfield}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has been criticized for banning third-party applications that enable a functionality that Apple does not want the iPhone to have: In 2008, Apple rejected [[Podcaster]], which allowed iPhone users to download podcasts directly to the iPhone claiming it duplicated the functionality of iTunes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/135527/2008/09/appstore.html|date=September 12, 2008|title=Podcasting app rejected from App Store|work=Macworld|accessdate=January 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple has since released a software update that grants this capability.&lt;ref name=&quot;2.2&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/137023/2008/11/iphone_22.html|title=Apple releases iPhone 2.2 update|last=Snell|first=Jason|date=November 21, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=June 10, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NetShare, another rejected app, would have enabled users to [[Tethering|tether]] their iPhone to a laptop or desktop, using its cellular network to load data for the computer.&lt;ref name=&quot;Banned apps&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcworld.com/staffblog/archives/007748.html|title=Apple App Store Ban: Android, Here's Your Chance |last=Raphael|first=JR|date=September 15, 2008|work=[[PC World (magazine)|PC World]]|accessdate=December 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many carriers of the iPhone later globally allowed tethering before Apple officially supported it with the upgrade to the iOS 3.0, with [[AT&amp;T Mobility]] being a relative latecomer in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2010/06/att-adds-iphone-tethering-kills-unlimited-data-for-ipad-smartphones |title=AT&amp;T Adds iPhone Tethering, Kills Unlimited Data for iPad, Smartphones &amp;#124; Gadget Lab |publisher=Wired.com |accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most cases, the carrier charges extra for tethering an iPhone.

Before the SDK was released, third-parties were permitted to design &quot;Web Apps&quot; that would run through Safari.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/webapps/whatarewebapps.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â Web apps|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=May 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unsigned native applications are also available for &quot;jailbroken&quot; phones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Healey|first=Jon|title=Hacking the iPhone|work=Los Angeles Times |date=August 6, 2007|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oew-healey6aug06,0,3456267.story|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to install native applications onto the iPhone outside of the App Store is not supported by Apple, the stated reason being that such native applications could be broken by any software update, but Apple has stated it will not design software updates specifically to break native applications other than those that perform SIM unlocking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gearlog.com/2007/09/apples_joswiak_we_dont_hate_ip.php|title=Apple's Joswiak: We Do not Hate iPhone Coders|date=September 2007|publisher=gearlog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of January 2011, Apple has passed 10&amp;nbsp;billion app downloads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techcrunch.com/2011/04/14/google-3-billion-android-apps-installed-up-50-percent-from-last-quarter/?utm_source=feedburner&amp;utm_medium=feed&amp;utm_campaign=Feed%3A+Techcrunch+%28TechCrunch%29 |title=Google: 3 Billion Android Apps Installed; Downloads Up 50 Percent From Last Quarter |publisher=TechCrunch |date=2011-04-14 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessibility===
The iPhone can enlarge text to make it more [[accessibility|accessible]] for vision-impaired users,&lt;ref name=&quot;access vision&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/vision.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â Accessibility&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Vision|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can accommodate hearing-impaired users with [[closed captioning]] and external [[Telecommunications device for the deaf|TTY]] devices.&lt;ref name=&quot;access hearing&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/accessibility/iphone/hearing.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â Accessibility&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Hearing|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The iPhone 3GS also features white on black mode, [[VoiceOver]] (a [[screen reader]]), and zooming for impaired vision, and mono audio for [[hearing loss|limited hearing]] in one ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/iphone-3g-s/accessibility.html|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Accessibility|date=June 8, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 8, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple regularly publishes Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates which explicitly state compliance with the US regulation &quot;[[Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973|Section 508]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/accessibility/resources/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â Voluntary Product Accessibility Templates|date=July 18, 2009|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=July 18, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vulnerability===
In 2007, 2010, and 2011, developers released a series of tools called [[JailbreakMe]] that used security vulnerabilities in Mobile Safari rendering in order to [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreak]] the device (which allows users to install any compatible software on the device instead of only App Store apps).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reviews.cnet.com/8301-19512_7-10115225-233.html |title=One-step method for adding third-party apps to iPhone 1.1.1, iPod Touch debuts |date=October 29, 2007 |publisher=CNET |author= Ben Wilson |accessdate=August 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.engadget.com/2010/08/01/official-iphone-4-jailbreak-hits-from-iphone-dev-team/ |title=Official: iPhone 4 jailbreak hits from iPhone Dev Team (updated with video) |publisher=Engadget |date= August 1, 2010 |author=  Sean Hollister |accessdate=September 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jailbreakme-informationweek&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Apple iOS Zero-Day PDF Vulnerability Exposed |author= Mathew J.

Theoretically these flaws could have also been used for malicious purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news-record.com/content/2011/07/08/article/security_holes_discovered_in_iphones_ipads|title=Security holes discovered in iPhones, iPads|last=Robertson|first=Jordan|work=[[News &amp; Record]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=2011-07-08|accessdate=2011-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, Apple released iOS 4.3.5 (4.2.10 for CDMA iPhone) to fix a security vulnerability with certificate validation.

==Intellectual property==
Apple has filed more than 200 [[patent application]]s related to the technology behind the iPhone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ishimaru|first=Heather|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kgo/story?section=news/business&amp;id=4920783|title=Apple Options Not An Issue At Macworld|publisher=[[KGO-TV|abc7news.com]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=January 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/features/index.html#technology|publisher=Apple Inc.|title=iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Features&amp;nbsp;â High Technology|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LG Electronics claimed the design of the iPhone was copied from the [[LG Prada (KE850)|LG Prada]]. Woo-Young Kwak, head of LG Mobile Handset R&amp;D Center, said at a press conference: &quot;we consider that Apple copied Prada phone after the design was unveiled when it was presented in the iF Design Award and won the prize in September 2006.&quot;&lt;ref name=am&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.applematters.com/article/the-iphone-lawsuits/|title=The iPhone Lawsuits|publisher=Apple Matters|first=Aaron|last=Wright|date=February 20, 2007|accessdate=June 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2002, Apple applied for the &quot;iPhone&quot; trademark in the United Kingdom, Australia, Singapore, and the European Union. A Canadian application followed in October 2004, and a New Zealand application in September 2006. As of October 2006, only the Singapore and Australian applications had been granted. In September 2006, a company called Ocean Telecom Services applied for an &quot;iPhone&quot; trademark in the United States, United Kingdom and Hong Kong, following a filing in Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/tm/t-find/t-find-number?detailsrequested=C&amp;trademark=E5341301|title=Case details for Community Trade Mark E5341301|publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office]]|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the Ocean Telecom trademark applications use exactly the same wording as the New Zealand application of Apple, it is assumed that Ocean Telecom is applying on behalf of Apple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://10layers.com/2006/10/apple-filing-for-iphone-trademarks-worldwide/|title=Apple filing for iPhone trademarks worldwide|publisher=10layers.com|date=October 17, 2006|accessdate=January 28, 2007|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070113014820/http://10layers.com/2006/10/apple-filing-for-iphone-trademarks-worldwide/|archivedate=January 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Canadian application was opposed in August 2005, by a Canadian company called [[Comwave]] who themselves applied for the trademark three months later. Comwave has been selling VoIP devices called iPhone since 2004.&lt;ref name=CiscoFacesiPhone /&gt;

Shortly after Steve Jobs' January 9, 2007 announcement that Apple would be selling a product called iPhone in June 2007, Cisco issued a statement that it had been negotiating trademark licensing with Apple and expected Apple to agree to the final documents that had been submitted the night before.&lt;ref name=AppleHelloiPhone&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Owen Thomas (journalist)|last=Thomas|first=Owen|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/01/09/technology/apple_jobs/index.htm|title=Apple: Hello, iPhone|publisher=[[CNN|CNN Money]]|date=January 9, 2007|accessdate=January 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 10, 2007, Cisco announced it had filed a lawsuit against Apple over the infringement of the trademark iPhone, seeking an injunction in federal court to prohibit Apple from using the name.&lt;ref name=CiscoTrademark&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://newsroom.cisco.com/dlls/2007/corp_011007.html|title=Cisco Sues Apple for Trademark Infringement|publisher=[[Cisco Systems]]|date=January 10, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, Cisco claimed that the trademark lawsuit was a &quot;minor skirmish&quot; that was not about money, but about interoperability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.cnet.com/2100-1047_3-6153339.html|title=Report: Cisco CEO calls iPhone suit 'minor skirmish'|publisher=[[News.com]]|author=[[Reuters]]|date=January 25, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2010, [[Reuters]] reported that some iPhone and [[iPad]] users were suing [[Apple Inc]] because some applications were passing user information to third-party advertisers without permission. Some makers of the applications such as Textplus4, [[Paper Toss]], [[Weather Channel]], [[Dictionary.com]], Talking Tom Cat and Pumpkin Maker have also been named as co-defendants in the lawsuit.&lt;ref name=&quot;Thomson Reuters&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6BR1Y820101228|title=IPhone and iPad users sue Apple over privacy issues|date=December 28, 2010|agency=Reuters  |publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=December 28, 2010|unused_data=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since April 20, 2011, a [[hidden file|hidden]] [[encryption|unencrypted]] file on the iPhone and other iOS devices has been widely discussed in the media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.csvance.com/?p=136 | title=Consolidated.db : Final Thoughts | author=Christopher Vance | date=April 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Wired1&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2011/04/iphone-tracks/ | title=iPhone Tracks Your Every Move, and Thereâs a Map for That | publisher=[[Wired.com]] | date=April 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Chen, Brian X.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was alleged that the file, labeled &quot;consolidated.db&quot;, constantly stores the iPhone user's movement by approximating geographic locations calculated by triangulating nearby cell phone towers, a technology proven to be inaccurate at times.&lt;ref name=&quot;O'Reilly&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2011/04/more-iphone-tracking-research.html | title=Additional iPhone tracking research | publisher=[[O'Reilly Media]] | date=April 24, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011 | author=Warden, Pete}}&lt;/ref&gt; The file was released with the June 2010 update of Apple [[iOS4]] and may contain almost one year's worth of data. Previous versions of iOS stored similar information in a file called &quot;h-cells.plist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://alexlevinson.wordpress.com/2011/04/21/3-major-issues-with-the-latest-iphone-tracking-discovery/ | title=3 Major Issues with the Latest iPhone Tracking &quot;Discovery&quot; | author=Alex Levinson | date=April 21, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[F-Secure]] discovered that the data is transmitted to Apple twice a day and postulate that Apple is using the information to construct their global location database similar to the ones constructed by Google and [[Skyhook Wireless|Skyhook]] through [[wardriving]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.f-secure.com/weblog/archives/00002145.html | title=Actually, iPhone sends your location to Apple twice a day | author=[[Mikko Hypponen]] | date=April 21, 2011 | accessdate=April 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, unlike the [[Google]] &quot;Latitude&quot; application, which performs a similar task on [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones, the file is not dependent upon signing a specific [[EULA]] or even the user's knowledge, but it is stated in the 15,200 word-long [[terms and conditions]] of the iPhone that ''&quot;Apple and [their] partners and licensees may collect, use, and share precise location data, including the real-time geographic location of [the user's] Apple computer or device&quot;''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2011/apr/20/iphone-tracking-prompts-privacy-fears | title=iPhone keeps record of everywhere you go |work=The Guardian |location=UK | date=April 20, 2011 | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Arthur, Charles}}&lt;/ref&gt; The file is also automatically copied onto the user's computer once synchronized with the iPhone. An [[open source]] application named &quot;iPhoneTracker&quot;, which turns the data stored in the file into a visual map, was made available to the public in April 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;GitHub&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://petewarden.github.com/iPhoneTracker/ | title=iPhone Tracker | publisher=[[GitHub]] | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Allan, Alasdair/Warden, Pete}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the file cannot be erased without [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbreaking]] the phone, it can be encrypted.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://techland.time.com/2011/04/22/how-to-encrypt-your-iphones-location-data-consolidated-db/ | title=How to Encrypt The Location Data of your iPhone (Consolidated.db) |work=Time magazine | date=April 22, 2011 | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Aamoth, Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple gave an official response on their web site on April 27&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-location-FAQ&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2011/04/27location_qa.html|date=April 27, 2011|accessdate=June 7, 2011|publisher=[http://www.apple.com/ Apple web site]|title=Apple Q&amp;A on Location Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; after questions were submitted by users, [[The Associated Press]] and others.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forbes&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2011/04/21/technology-technology-hardware-amp-equipment-us-apple-iphone-tracking_8429038.html | title=iPhone, iPad tracking causes alarm |work=Forbes | date=April 21, 2011 | accessdate=April 22, 2011 | author=Robertson, Jordan}}{{dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple indicated that the data is a crowd-sourced location database cache, used to make location services faster, and that the volume of data retained was an error; they issued an update for [[IOS (Apple)|iOS]] (version [[IOS version history#4.3.3|4.3.3]], or [[IOS version history#4.2.8|4.2.8]] for the CDMA iPhone 4) which reduced the size of the cache, stopped it being backed up to iTunes, and erased it entirely if whenever location services were turned off.&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple-location-FAQ&quot; /&gt;

==Restrictions==
[[File:iPhone unlock v3.png|thumb|upright|Jailbroken iPod Touch on iOS 3.0. The serial number and Wi-Fi address have been removed from the image.]]
Apple tightly controls certain aspects of the iPhone. The [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hacker]] community has found many workarounds, most of which are disallowed by Apple and threaten to void the device's warranty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iphonealley.com/news/do-iphone-hacks-void-your-warranty|title=Do iPhone Hacks Void Your Warranty?|last=Johnston|first=Michael|date=October 20, 2007|publisher=iPhone Alley|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;[[iOS jailbreaking|Jailbreaking]]&quot; allows users to install apps not available on the App Store or modify basic functionality. SIM unlocking allows the iPhone to be used on a different carrier's network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/132675/2008/03/iphone_sdk_jailbreak.html|title=iPhone hackers look to an uncertain future|last=Moren|first=Dan|date=May 28, 2008|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Activation===
The iPhone normally prevents access to its media player and web features unless it has also been activated as a phone with an authorized carrier. On July 3, 2007, [[Jon Lech Johansen]] reported on his blog that he had successfully bypassed this requirement and unlocked the iPhone's other features with a combination of custom software and modification of the iTunes binary. He published the software and offsets for others to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://nanocr.eu/2007/07/03/iphone-without-att/|title=iPhone Independence Day|publisher=nanocr.eu|first=Jon Lech|last=Johansen|authorlink=Jon Lech Johansen|date=July 3, 2007|accessdate=June 6, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike the original, the iPhone 3G must be activated in the store in most countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.maclife.com/article/iphone_3g_in_store_activation_only|title=iPhone 3G&amp;nbsp;â In-Store Activation Only|publisher=[[MacLife]]|first=Roberto|last=Baldwin|date=June 9, 2008|accessdate=June 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This makes the iPhone 3G more difficult, but not impossible, to hack. The need for in-store activation, as well as the huge number of first-generation iPhone and [[iPod Touch]] users upgrading to iPhone OS 2.0, caused a worldwide [[Web server#Overload causes|overload]] of Apple's [[server (computing)|servers]] on July 11, 2008, the day on which both the iPhone 3G and iPhone OS 2.0 updates as well as [[MobileMe]] were released. After the update, devices were required to connect to Apple's servers to authenticate the update, causing many devices to be temporarily unusable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/12/business/12iphone.html |title=iPhone Users Plagued by Software Problems.|work=The New York Times |first=John|last=Markoff | authorlink = John Markoff |date=July 12, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A year later, Apple released the 3.0 software two days before the iPhone 3GS to avoid such issues.

Users on the [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]] network in the United Kingdom, however, can buy the phone online and activate it via iTunes as with the previous model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone |title=iPhone 3G|publisher=Apple Store (U.K.)|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even where not required, vendors usually offer activation for the buyer's convenience. In the U.S., Apple has begun to offer free shipping on both the iPhone 3G and the iPhone 3GS (when available), reversing the in-store activation requirement. [[Best Buy]] and [[Wal-Mart]] will also sell the iPhone.&lt;ref name=&quot;Buy iPhone&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apple.com/iphone/buy/|title=Apple&amp;nbsp;â iPhone&amp;nbsp;â Buy iPhone 3G|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Unapproved third-party software and jailbreaking===
{{See also|iOS jailbreaking|iPhone Dev Team}}

The iPhone's operating system is designed to only run software that has an Apple-approved [[code signing|cryptographic signature]]. This restriction can be overcome by &quot;jailbreaking&quot; the phone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-9806428-37.htm|title=iPhone jailbreak for the masses released|last=Krazit|first=Tom|date=October 19, 2007|publisher=CNET news|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; which involves replacing the iPhone's [[firmware]] with a slightly modified version that does not enforce the signature check. Doing so may be a circumvention of Apple's [[technical protection measures]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/politics/onlinerights/commentary/circuitcourt/2007/08/circuitcourt_0829|title=Legal or Not, IPhone Hacks Might Spur Revolution|last=Granick|first=Jennifer|date=August 28, 2007|work=Wired|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple, in a statement to the [[United States Copyright Office]] in response to [[Electronic Frontier Foundation|EFF]] lobbying for a DMCA exception for this kind of hacking, claimed that jailbreaking the iPhone would be [[copyright infringement]] due to the necessary modification of system software.&lt;ref name=&quot;iphone-dmca&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10163675-37.html|title=Apple: iPhone jailbreaking violates our copyright|last=Krazit|first=Tom|date=February 23, 2009|publisher=News.com|accessdate=February 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However in 2010 Jailbreaking was declared officially legal in the [[US]] by the [[DMCA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.redmondpie.com/jailbreak-unlock-iphone-officially-legal/ | title=Jailbreaking and Unlocking is Now Officially Legal in United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Jailbroken iPhones may be susceptible to computer viruses, but few such incidents have been reported.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2009/11/09/2737673.htm Australian admits creating first iPhone virus], Brigid Andersen, [[ABC Online]], November 9, 2009.

===SIM unlocking===
====United States====
[[File:File-Top and left side of iPhone 3G white showing the standby button, sim tray, headphone plug, silent switch and volume buttons showing the sim tray half pulled out.JPG|thumb|iPhone 3G shown with the [[Subscriber Identity Module|SIM]] tray partially ejected.]]

Most iPhones were and are still sold with a [[SIM lock]], which restricts the use of the phone to one particular carrier, a common practice with subsidized [[GSM]] phones. Unlike most GSM phones however, the phone cannot be officially unlocked by entering a code. The locked/unlocked state is maintained on Apple's servers per [[IMEI]] and is set when the iPhone is activated.

While the iPhone was initially [[AT&amp;T, the iPhone, and Tying of Smartphones and Service Providers|sold in the US only on the AT&amp;T network]] with a SIM lock in place, various hackers have found methods to &quot;[[Unlock phone|unlock]]&quot; the phone from a specific network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/60045/iphone_sim_unlocking.html?loomia_ow=t0:s0:a38:g26:r1:c0.001557:b21009213|title=Unlocking an iPhone|last=Farivar|first=Cyrus|date=November 14, 2007|work=Macworld|accessdate=May 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although AT&amp;T, Sprint and Verizon are the only authorized iPhone carriers in the United States, unlocked iPhones can be used with other carriers after unlocking.&lt;ref name=bw&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessweek.com/technology/content/sep2008/tc2008091_106953.htm?chan=top+news_top+news+index_news+++analysis|title=What's Hot: Used Apple iPhones: After the iPhone 3G launch, consumers want the original, hackable iPhone, and vendors are springing up to sell themâfor a premium|last=Kharif|first=Olga|work=BusinessWeek  |date=September 2, 2008|accessdate=March 17, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than a quarter of the original iPhones sold in the United States were not registered with AT&amp;T. Apple speculates that they were likely shipped overseas and unlocked, a lucrative market before the iPhone 3G's worldwide release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/7214873.stm|publisher=BBC News |date=January 28, 2008|title=Quarter of US iPhones 'unlocked'}}&lt;/ref&gt; iPhones are unlocked by users who wish to use networks other than AT&amp;T or Verizon's.&lt;ref name=&quot;NPD demographics&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.npd.com/press/releases/press_090622.html|title=iPhone 3G Price Decrease Addresses Key Reason Consumers Exhibit Purchase Resistance|date=June 22, 2009|publisher=[[NPD Group]]|accessdate=June 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=May 2010}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://unlockiphone.org|title=Unlock iPhone Team|date=January 3, 2010|accessdate=January 6, 2010|publisher=unlockiphone}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AT&amp;T has stated that the &quot;iPhone cannot be unlocked, even if you are out of contract&quot;.&lt;ref name=bw /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wireless.att.com/answer-center/main.jsp?t=solutionTab&amp;ft=searchTab&amp;ps=solutionPanels&amp;locale=en_US&amp;_dyncharset=UTF-8&amp;solutionId=61097&amp;isSrch=Yes|title= Answer Center: What is the unlock code for my iPhone?|publisher=AT&amp;T|accessdate=May 13, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 26, 2009, AT&amp;T in the United States began selling the iPhone without a contract, though still SIM-locked to their network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13579_3-10200602-37.html|title=AT&amp;T: No-contract iPhones coming next week|last=Krazit|first=Tom|date=2009-13-19|publisher=CNET News|accessdate=May 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The up-front purchase price of such iPhone units is often twice as expensive as those bundled with contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcretailmag.com/news/29052/Orange-to-sell-iPhone-SIM-free-for-749|title=Orange to sell iPhone SIM-free for â¬749|date=November 29, 2007|accessdate=January 6, 2008|publisher=PC Retail Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Outside of the United States, policies differ, especially in US territories and insular areas like [[Guam]], where [[GTA TeleGuam]] is the exclusive carrier for the iPhone, since neither AT&amp;T nor Verizon has a presence in the area.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gta.net/guam-cell-phones/phones/iPhone/]{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other countries====
In the [[United Kingdom]], carriers [[O2 (United Kingdom)|O2]], [[Orange (telecommunications)|Orange]], [[Hutchison 3G|3]], [[Vodafone U.K.|Vodafone]], [[T-mobile (UK)|T-Mobile]], as well as [[mobile virtual network operator|MVNO]] [[Tesco Mobile]] sell the device under subsidised contracts, or for use on pay as you go. They are locked to network initially, though are usually able to be unlocked either after a certain period of contract length has passed, or for a small fee. The iPhone 4 in the UK is also currently sold unlocked without a contract for full retail price for use on any network the user chooses, but only when bought directly from Apple (either online or in their physical shops).&lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone is sold SIM free and customer can choose carrier.&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/uk/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone |title=Buy iPhone 4 and iPhone 3GS â Apple Store (UK) |publisher=Store.apple.com |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Five major carriers in [[Australia]], ([[Hutchison 3G|Three]], [[Optus]], [[Telstra]], [[Virgin Mobile Australia|Virgin Mobile]], and [[Vodafone Australia|Vodafone]]),&lt;ref name=&quot;Apple Store Australia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://store.apple.com/au/browse/home/shop_iphone/family/iphone |title=iPhone 3G &amp; iPhone 3GS&amp;nbsp;â Apple Store (Australia) |publisher=Store.apple.com |accessdate=May 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; offer legitimate unlocking, now at no cost for all iPhone devices, both current and prior models. The iPhone 3GS and the iPhone 4 can also be bought unlocked from a Apple Retail Store, or the Apple Online Store.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrier unlocking list&quot; /&gt;

All new mobile phones sold by carriers in [[Canada]] are locked, and none of the major carriers ([[Rogers Wireless]], [[Telus]], [[Bell Mobility]]) unlock iPhones, even after service contracts have come to an end. [[Cell Phone Freedom Act (Bill C-560)|Legislation]] has been introduced that would compel carriers to unlock mobile phones (including iPhones) outside of contract, upon customer request.  iPhone 3GS, iPhone4 and iPhone4s can be bought unlocked from Apple Retail stores or from Apple Online Store. 

Internationally, policies vary, but many carriers sell the iPhone unlocked for full retail price.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carrier unlocking list&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1937|title=About activating iPhone 3G with a wireless carrier|date=December 13, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

iPhone 4S entered Indian market with Aircel and Airtel starting pre orders on 18 Nov 2011. The phones will be available in stores from 25 Nov 2011 with a price tag of Rs. 44,500 for the 16GB version and Rs. 50,900 for the 32GB version. Its still not clear if the 64GB version will come to India any time soon. &lt;ref name=&quot;iPhone 4S in India&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gadgetronica.com/blog/iphone-4s-preorder-aircel-airtel-price.html|title=Apple iPhone 4S: Rs. 50900 for 32GB !|date=November 19, 2011|publisher=Gadgetronica}}&lt;/ref&gt;
