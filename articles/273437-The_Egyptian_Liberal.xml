'''Keith Theodore Olbermann''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|oÊ|l|b|Ér|m|Én}}; born January 27, 1959) is an American [[political commentator]] and [[writer]]. He has been the chief news officer of the [[Current TV]] network and the host of Current TV's weeknight political commentary program, ''[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann]]'', since June 20, 2011. He hosted a program with the same title and a similar format on [[MSNBC]] from March 2003 to January 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;breaks silence&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;new show&quot;/&gt;

During his time at [[MSNBC]], Olbermann established a niche in [[United States cable news|cable news]] commentary, gaining note for his pointed criticism of mainly [[Right-wing politics|right-leaning]] politicians and public figures&lt;ref name=niche/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;olbermannfactor&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;honest&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodrick&quot; /&gt; such as [[Fox News Channel]] commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]],&lt;ref name=feud/&gt;&lt;ref name=shouting/&gt; [[Presidency of George W. Bush|President]] [[George W. Bush]] and [[John McCain presidential campaign, 2008|2008 Republican presidential nominee]], [[John McCain]].&lt;ref name=replaced/&gt; Though he has been called a &quot;[[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]]&quot;, he has resisted being labelled politically.&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;will use&quot;/&gt;

Olbermann spent the first twenty years of his career in sports journalism. He was a sports correspondent for [[CNN]] and for local TV and radio stations in the 1980s, winning the ''Best Sportscaster'' award from the California [[Associated Press]] three times. He co-hosted [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'' from 1992 to 1997. From 1998 to 2001, he was a producer and anchor for [[Fox Sports Net]] and a host of [[Major League Baseball on Fox]].

==Early life==
Olbermann was born January 27, 1959, in New York City to Marie Katherine (nÃ©e Charbonier),&lt;ref name=&quot;6apr2009&quot;/&gt; a preschool teacher, and Theodore Olbermann, a commercial architect,&lt;ref name=&quot;boyer&quot;/&gt; and is of [[German American|German]] descent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2007&quot;/&gt; He has one younger sister, Jenna, who was born in 1968.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008&quot;/&gt; Olbermann grew up in a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]] household&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008a&quot;/&gt; in the town of [[Hastings-on-Hudson, New York|Hastings-on-Hudson]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2006&quot;/&gt; in [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], and attended [[Hackley School]]&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodrick&quot;/&gt; in nearby [[Tarrytown, New York|Tarrytown]].

Olbermann became a devoted fan of [[baseball]] at a young age, a love he inherited from his mother who was a lifelong [[New York Yankees]] fan.&lt;ref name=&quot;6apr2009&quot; /&gt; As a teenager, he often wrote about baseball card-collecting and appeared in many sports card-collecting periodicals of the mid-1970s. He is also referenced in ''Sports Collectors Bible'', a 1979 book by [[Bert Sugar]], which is considered one of the important early books for [[trading card]] collectors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steinberg1997&quot;/&gt;

While at Hackley, Olbermann began his broadcasting career as a play-by-play announcer for WHTR. After graduating from Hackley in 1975, Olbermann enrolled at [[Cornell University]] at the age of 16&lt;!--PLEASE DISCUSS BEFORE CHANGING THIS--&gt;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Counting_Down_w_KO&quot;/&gt; At college, Olbermann served as sports director for [[WVBR-FM|WVBR]], a student-run commercial [[radio station]] in [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Counting_Down_w_KO&quot;/&gt; Olbermann graduated from Cornell in 1979 with a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]] in communications arts.&lt;ref name=&quot;offbio&quot;/&gt;

==Sports broadcasting==
Olbermann began his professional career at [[United Press International|UPI]] and the [[RKO Radio Network]] before joining then nascent [[CNN]] in 1981. Among the early stories he covered was the [[1980 Winter Olympics]] at [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]] including the &quot;[[Miracle on Ice]].&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Counting_Down_w_KO&quot;/&gt; In the early-to-mid '80s he was a sportscaster on the old WNEW 1130-AM radio station in New York City. Also in the mid-1980s, he did the voice-over on the USA Cable Network's &quot;Cartoon Express&quot;, with cheering kids heard in the background. In 1984, he briefly worked as a sports anchor at [[WCVB-TV]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], before heading to Los Angeles to work at [[KTLA]] and [[KCBS-TV|KCBS]]. His work there earned him 11 [http://www.rtna.org/ Golden Mike Awards], and he was named best sportscaster by the California [[Associated Press]] three times.&lt;ref name=imdb_bio/&gt;

===ESPN===
In 1992, Olbermann joined [[ESPN]]'s ''[[SportsCenter]]'', a position he held until 1997 with the exception of a period from 1993â1994 when he was at [[ESPN2]] on ''[[SportsNight]]''. He joined ESPN2 as their &quot;marquee&quot; personality to help launch the network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_d&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_e&quot;/&gt; He often co-hosted ''SportsCenter'' 11 PM show with [[Dan Patrick (sportscaster)|Dan Patrick]], the two becoming a popular [[anchor]] team. In 1995, Olbermann won a [[Cable ACE Awards|Cable ACE award]] for Best Sportscaster.&lt;ref name=&quot;offbio&quot;/&gt; Olbermann later co-authored a book with Patrick called ''The Big Show'' about their experiences working at ''SportsCenter''; he also said that the short-lived [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[dramedy]] ''[[Sports Night]]'' was based on his time on ''SportsCenter'' with Patrick.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2004&quot;/&gt; He made $350,000 at the end of his tenure at ESPN.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt;

Early in 1997, Olbermann was suspended for two weeks after he made an unauthorized appearance on ''[[The Daily Show]]'' on [[Comedy Central]] with then-host and former ESPN colleague [[Craig Kilborn]]. At one point in the show, he referred to [[Bristol, Connecticut]] (ESPN's headquarters), as a &quot;'Godforsaken place.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt; Later that year, Olbermann abruptly left ESPN under a cloud of controversy, apparently burning his bridges with the network's management;&lt;ref name=&quot;scorchedbridges&quot;/&gt; this began a long and drawn-out feud between Olbermann and ESPN. Between 1997 and 2007, incidents between the two sides included Olbermann's publishing an essay on [[Salon.com]] in November 2002, titled &quot;Mea Culpa&quot;, in which he stated: &quot;I couldn't handle the pressure of working in daily long-form television, and what was worse, I didn't know I couldn't handle it.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;meaculpa&quot;/&gt; The essay told of an instance when his former bosses remarked he had &quot;too much backbone,&quot; a claim that is literally true, as Olbermann has six [[lumbar vertebrae]] instead of the normal five.&lt;ref name=&quot;meaculpa&quot;/&gt;

In 2004, Olbermann was not included in ESPN's guest lineup for its 25th anniversary ''[[SportsCenter]]'' &quot;Reunion Week,&quot; which saw [[Craig Kilborn]] and [[Charley Steiner]] return to the ''SportsCenter'' set. In 2007, ten years after Olbermann's departure, in an appearance on ''[[The Late Show with David Letterman]]'', he said: &quot;If you burn a bridge, you can possibly build a new bridge, but if there's no river any more, that's a lot of trouble.&quot; During the same interview, Olbermann stated that he had recently learned that as a result of ESPN's agreeing to let him return to the airwaves, he was banned from ESPN's main ([[Bristol, Connecticut]]) campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;burnedrivers&quot;/&gt;

===Post-''SportsCenter''===
In 1998, Olbermann joined [[Fox Sports Net]] as anchor and executive producer for ''The Keith Olbermann Evening News'', a sportscast similar to ''SportsCenter'', airing weekly on Sunday evenings. While at Fox, he again hosted the [[2000 World Series]] as well as [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox Broadcasting]]'s baseball ''[[Major League Baseball Game of the Week|Game of the Week]]''. In May and July 1999, Olbermann also guest starred ten times on the ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_f&quot;/&gt;

According to Olbermann, he was fired from Fox in 2001 after reporting on rumors that [[Rupert Murdoch]], whose [[News Corporation]] owns Fox, was planning on selling the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2004a&quot;/&gt; When asked about Olbermann, Murdoch said: &quot;I fired him...He's crazy.&quot;&lt;ref name=murdoch/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian2011&quot;/&gt; News Corp. went on to sell the Dodgers to [[Frank McCourt (executive)|Frank McCourt]] in 2004. That year, Olbermann remarked, &quot;Fox Sports was an infant trying to stand [in comparison to ESPN], but on the broadcast side there was no comparisonâESPN was the bush leagues.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Counting_Down_w_KO&quot;/&gt;

After Olbermann left Fox Sports in 2001, he provided twice-daily sports commentary on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC Radio Network]], reviving the &quot;Speaking of Sports&quot; and &quot;Speaking of Everything&quot; segments begun by [[Howard Cosell]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Sandomir2002&quot;/&gt;

In 2005, Olbermann made a return to ESPN on the radio when he began co-hosting an hour of the syndicated ''[[Dan Patrick Show]]'' on [[ESPN radio]], a tenure that lasted until Patrick left ESPN on August 17, 2007.&lt;ref name=patrick/&gt; Olbermann and Patrick referred to this segment as &quot;The Big Show,&quot; just as their book was known. Patrick often introduced Olbermann with the tagline &quot;saving the democracy,&quot; a nod to his work on ''Countdown''.

On April 16, 2007, Olbermann was named co-host of ''[[Football Night in America]]'', NBC's NFL pre-game show that precedes their [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night NFL game]], a position which reunited him in 2008 with his former ''[[SportsCenter]]'' co-anchor [[Dan Patrick]]. Olbermann left the show prior to the start of the 2010 season.&lt;ref name=&quot;Shain2010&quot;/&gt;

==News journalism==
In 1997, Olbermann left ESPN to host a primetime show on [[MSNBC]], ''The Big Show with Keith Olbermann'' (ESPN objected to the use of the title).&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt; The news-driven program, with substantial discussion, relied on Olbermann to carry the 8 to 9 PM hour.&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt; The show typically covered three or four topics in a one-hour broadcast. Olbermann also hosted two Sunday editions of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' and once co-anchored a Saturday edition of the ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]'' show.&lt;ref&gt;A search of the [http://tvnews.vanderbilt.edu/ Vanderbilt University Television News Archive] shows that Olbermann anchored ''NBC Nightly News'' on April 12, 1998 (Easter Sunday) and May 9, 1998. On his ''Nightly News'' debut, Olbermann led with coverage of the [[April 1998 Birmingham tornado]] and introduced stories about observances of Easter at the [[Holy See|Vatican]], the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], and [[Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement]] among other subjects.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bill moyer's chair&quot;/&gt; During that period, Olbermann along with [[Hannah Storm]], also co-hosted [[NBC Sports]]' [[Major League Baseball on NBC|pre-game coverage]] of the [[Major League Baseball|MLB]] [[1997 World Series]].

When the [[Lewinsky scandal|Monica Lewinsky scandal]] broke in 1998, ''The Big Show with Keith Olbermann'' morphed into ''White House in Crisis''. Olbermann became frustrated as his show was consumed by the Lewinsky story. In 1998, he stated that his work at MSNBC would &quot;make me ashamed, make me depressed, make me cry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;scorchedbridges&quot;/&gt; Olbermann left MSNBC for Fox Sports Net shortly thereafter.

After leaving Fox Sports in 2001, Olbermann returned once more to news journalism. In 2003, his network won an [[RTNDA Edward R. Murrow Award|Edward R. Murrow Award]] for writing on the &quot;Keith Olbermann Speaking of Everything&quot; show.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_g&quot;/&gt; In addition, Olbermann wrote a weekly column for [[Salon.com]] from July 2002 until early 2003,&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_h&quot;/&gt; worked for [[CNN]] as a freelance reporter,&lt;ref name=&quot;Counting_Down_w_KO&quot;/&gt; and was a fill-in for newscaster [[Paul Harvey]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_i&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_j&quot;/&gt;

Olbermann revived his association with MSNBC in 2003 briefly as a substitute host on ''[[Jerry Nachman|Nachman]]'' and as an anchor for the network's coverage of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|war in Iraq]].

===''Countdown with Keith Olbermann''===
{{main|Countdown with Keith Olbermann}}
Olbermann's own show, ''Countdown'', debuted on March 31, 2003, in the 8 p.m. ET time slot previously held by programs hosted by [[Phil Donahue]] and, briefly, [[Lester Holt]]. On October 13, 2004, Olbermann launched ''[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/6210240/ Bloggermann]'', his ''Countdown'' [[blog]], hosted on MSNBC.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;welcome_to_bloggermann&quot;/&gt; Olbermann used the open format of the blog to expand on facts or ideas alluded to in the broadcast, to offer personal musings and reactions. However, in February 2007, Olbermann launched a new blog, ''[http://thenewshole.msnbc.msn.com/default.aspx The News Hole]''.

''Countdown's'' format, per its name, involves Olbermann ranking the five biggest news stories of the day or sometimes &quot;stories my producers force me to cover,&quot; as Olbermann puts it. This is done in numerically reverse order, counting down with the first story shown being ranked fifth but apparently the most important. The segments ranked numbers two and one typically are of a lighter fare than segments ranked five through three. The first few stories shown are typically oriented toward government, politics, and world events. His stories usually involve celebrities, sports, and, regularly and somewhere in the middle, the bizarre, in a segment he calls &quot;Oddball.&quot; Opinions on each are offered by Olbermann and interviewed guests. Olbermann has been criticized for only having guests that agree with his perspective. Former ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' television critic Howard Rosenberg stated that &quot;Countdown is more or less an echo chamber in which Olbermann and like-minded bobbleheads nod at each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rosenberg2008&quot;/&gt;

In a technique similar to that of former [[CBS News]] anchor [[Walter Cronkite]] in connection to the [[Iran Hostage Crisis]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Bliss1991&quot;/&gt; Olbermann for many years closed&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2009&quot;/&gt; the program by counting the days since May 1, 2003, the day that President George W. Bush declared the end of &quot;major combat operations&quot; in Iraq under a banner that read &quot;[[2003 Mission Accomplished Speech|Mission Accomplished]]&quot;, and then crumpling up his notes, throwing them at the camera and saying &quot;Good night and good luck&quot; in the mode of another former CBS newsman, [[Edward Murrow]]. Olbermann discounts this gesture to his hero as &quot;presumptuous&quot; and a &quot;feeble tribute.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;olbermann_murrow&quot;/&gt;

On February 16, 2007, MSNBC reported that Olbermann had signed a four-year extension on his contract with MSNBC for ''Countdown'' which also provided for his hosting of two ''Countdown'' specials a year to be aired on ''NBC'' as well as for his occasional contribution of essays on ''NBC's Nightly News with Brian Williams''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_k&quot;/&gt;

Olbermann co-anchored, with [[Chris Matthews]], MSNBC's coverage of the death of fellow [[NBC News]] employee [[Tim Russert]] on June 13, 2008.&lt;ref name=&quot;Elber2008&quot;/&gt; He presented a tribute, along with several fellow journalists, in honor of Russert.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_l&quot;/&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 U.S. presidential election]], Olbermann co-anchored MSNBC's coverage with Chris Matthews until September 7, 2008, when they were replaced by [[David Gregory (journalist)|David Gregory]] after complaints from both outside and inside of [[NBC]] that they were making partisan statements.&lt;ref name=replaced /&gt; This apparent conflict of interest had been an issue as early as May 2007, when [[Rudy Giuliani presidential campaign, 2008|Giuliani campaign officials]] complained about his serving in dual roles, as both a host and a commentator.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_m&quot;/&gt; Despite this, ''Countdown'' was broadcast both before and after each of the presidential and vice-presidential debates, and Olbermann and Matthews joined Gregory on MSNBC's Election Day coverage.&lt;ref name=electionnight/&gt; Olbermann and Matthews also led MSNBC's coverage of the inauguration of President [[Barack Obama]].&lt;ref name=inauguration/&gt;&lt;ref name=inauguration2/&gt;

In November 2008, it was announced that Olbermann had signed a four-year contract extension worth an estimated $30 million.&lt;ref name=&quot;tvnewsernov08&quot;/&gt;

====Feud with Bill O'Reilly====
{{Further|[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann#Feud with Bill O'Reilly|Feud with Bill O'Reilly]]}}

Since beginning ''Countdown''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s &quot;Worst Person in the World&quot; segment in July 2005, Olbermann has repeatedly awarded [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], host of ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]'' on [[Fox News Channel]], the dubious honor.&lt;ref name=niche/&gt; The feud between the anchors originated with Olbermann's extensive coverage of a 2004 [[sexual harassment]] suit brought against O'Reilly by former Fox News Channel producer [[Andrea Mackris]] during which Olbermann asked ''Countdown'' viewers to fund the purchase of lurid audio tapes allegedly held by Mackris.&lt;ref name=&quot;Hagan2004&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;mackris_lawsuit&quot;/&gt; In 2008 O'Reilly decided to avoid mentioning Olbermann's name on the air, and once cut off a caller who mentioned Olbermann.&lt;ref name=&quot;banned&quot;/&gt; O'Reilly has also led campaigns against MSNBC's political coverage without ever specifically mentioning Olbermann.&lt;ref name=niche/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2006a&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Carpenter&quot;/&gt; The rivalry continued when in 2006 at Television Critics' Association in California, Olbermann donned a mask of O'Reilly and made a [[Nazi]] salute, leading to a letter of protest from the [[Anti-Defamation League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_n&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;feud boils&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_o&quot;/&gt;

In an article on &quot;perhaps the fiercest media feud of the decade&quot;, the ''[[New York Times]]'s'' [[Brian Stelter]] noted that as of early June 2009 the &quot;combat&quot; between the two hosts seems to have abruptly ended due to instructions filtered down to Olbermann and O'Reilly from the chief executives of their respective networks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stelter2009&quot;/&gt; On the August 3, 2009 edition of ''Countdown'', Olbermann asserted that he had made statements to Stelter before the article was published denying that he was a party to such a deal, or that there was such a deal between NBC and Fox News, or that any NBC executive had asked him to change ''Countdown'''s content. Olbermann maintained that he had stopped joking about O'Reilly because of O'Reilly's attacks of [[George Tiller]], and soon resumed his criticism of O'Reilly.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2009a&quot;/&gt;

====Suspension====
On October 28, 2010, days before the [[United States elections, 2010|2010 U.S. elections]], Olbermann donated $2,400 each to three Democratic candidates for Congress: [[Kentucky]] Senate candidate [[Jack Conway (politician)|Jack Conway]], and [[Arizona]] Democratic Representatives [[Raul Grijalva]] and [[Gabrielle Giffords]].&lt;ref name='Suspended'/&gt; Grijalva had appeared on Olbermann's show immediately before Olbermann mailed the donations. In response, on November 5, MSNBC President [[Phil Griffin]] suspended him indefinitely without pay for violating a network policy which required employees to obtain approval from management before making political contributions.&lt;ref name=&quot;Danny2010&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NYT-suspend&quot;/&gt; An online petition calling for his reinstatement received over 250,000 signatures;&lt;ref name=&quot;Olbermann suspension ending&quot; /&gt; two days after the suspension began, Griffin announced that Olbermann would return to the air on November 9.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olbermann suspension ending&quot;/&gt;

====Departure====
On January 21, 2011, Olbermann announced his departure from MSNBC and the episode would be the final episode of ''Countdown''.&lt;ref name=&quot;EndCountdown&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;FinalCountdown&quot;/&gt; MSNBC issued a statement that it had ended its contract with Olbermann, with no further explanation. Additional reporting in the days immediately following suggested that the negotiations for the end of Olbermann's tenure at MSNBC had begun soon after the end of his suspension.&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith Olbermann -- The Rich Get Richer&quot;/&gt;

===Current TV and FOKNewsChannel.com===
On February 8, 2011, it was announced that Olbermann had taken the position of chief news officer for the [[Al Gore]]/[[Joel Hyatt]] owned public affairs channel [[Current TV]] and would begin hosting a one-hour prime time program on the network.&lt;ref name=&quot;Olbermann Said to Be Going to Current TV&quot;/&gt; The new show was scheduled to air at 8 PM Eastern â the same time slot that ''Countdown'' was in.&lt;ref name=&quot;show time&quot;/&gt; On April 26, 2011 it was announced that Olbermann's new show would debut on June 20 and would be named &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;unveils&quot;/&gt; Olbermann will also be heavily involved in the development of the rest of the network's news programming.&lt;ref name=&quot;coming to current&quot;/&gt; The deal also includes an equity stake in Current TV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://current.com/keith-olbermann/ Countdown with Keith Olbermann // Current TV&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the interim between shows, Olbermann launched an &quot;official not-for-profit&quot; blog called FOKNewsChannel.com, &quot;FOK&quot; being an abbreviation for &quot;Friends Of Keith&quot;. The blog featured political commentaries by Olbermannâincluding [[viral video]] versions of ''Countdown'''s &quot;Special Comment&quot; and &quot;Worst Person&quot; segments, as well as photographs of his outings at [[professional baseball]] games.&lt;ref name=&quot;website launches&quot;/&gt; On May 29, 2011, the FOKNewsChannel.com domain redirected to the Current website promoting the June 20 launch.&lt;ref name=&quot;foknews&quot;/&gt;

==Political positions==
===Viewpoints===
Although it began as a traditional newscast, ''Countdown with Keith Olbermann'' eventually adopted an opinion-oriented format. In a ''Countdown'' interview with [[Al Franken]] on October 25, 2005, Olbermann noted that in 2003, after having [[Janeane Garofalo]] and Franken on his show, a vice president of MSNBC had questioned him on inviting &quot;liberals&quot; on consecutive nights, contrasting that occurrence to the apparent ideological latitude he enjoyed at the time of the second Franken interview.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2005&quot;/&gt; In January 2007 ''[[The Washington Post]]'''s [[Howard Kurtz]] wrote that Olbermann was &quot;position[ing] his program as an increasingly [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] alternative to ''[[The O'Reilly Factor]]''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Kurtz2007&quot;/&gt; Much of the program has featured harsh criticism of prominent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and [[Right-wing politics|right]]-leaning figures, including those who worked for or supported the [[George W. Bush Administration]], 2008 Republican presidential nominee Senator [[John McCain]] and running mate Governor [[Sarah Palin]],&lt;ref name=replaced/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008b&quot;/&gt; and rival news commentator [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]], whom Olbermann has routinely dubbed the &quot;Worst Person In The World&quot;.&lt;ref name=olbermannfactor/&gt;

During the 2008 Democratic Party primaries Olbermann frequently chastised presidential aspirant [[Hillary Clinton]] for her campaign tactics against her principal opponent, Senator [[Barack Obama]], and made her the subject of two of his &quot;special comments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008c&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2008d&quot;/&gt; Olbermann has also posted on the liberal blog [[Daily Kos]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_p&quot;/&gt;

In November 2007, [[Great Britain|British]] newspaper ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' placed Olbermann at #67 on their Top 100 list of most influential US liberals. It said that he uses his MSNBC show to promote &quot;an increasingly strident liberal agenda.&quot; It added that he would be &quot;a force on the [[political left|Left]] for some time to come.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;mostinfluential&quot;/&gt; Avoiding ideological self-labeling, Olbermann described his reporting in 2006 to [[Salon.com]], &quot;I donât think in these issues that Iâm a liberal; I think that Iâm an American. I think Iâm acting almost as a historian on these particular things&quot;.&lt;ref name=olbermannfactor/&gt;

Before the [[2010 Massachusetts special election]], Olbermann called Republican candidate [[Scott Brown]] &quot;an irresponsible, homophobic, racist, reactionary, ex-nude model, [[Tea Party movement|Tea Bagging]] supporter of violence against women, and against politicians with whom he disagrees&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;roasts&quot;/&gt; This was criticized by his colleague [[Joe Scarborough]], who called the comments &quot;reckless&quot; and &quot;sad&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Barr2010&quot;/&gt; Yael T. Abouhalkah of the ''[[Kansas City Star]]'' said that Olbermann &quot;crossed the line in a major way with his comments&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Abouhalkah2010&quot;/&gt; [[Jon Stewart]] criticized him about this attack in his show by noting that it was &quot;the harshest description of anyone I've ever heard uttered on MSNBC&quot;, following which Olbermann apologized by noting, &quot;I have been a little over the top lately. Point taken. Sorry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shea2010&quot;/&gt;

He has accused the [[Tea Party movement]] of being racist due to what he views as a lack of racial diversity at the events, using photos that show overwhelmingly Caucasian crowds attending the rallies. In response, the Dallas Tea Party invited Olbermann to attend one of their events and also criticized his network for a lack of racial diversity, pointing out that an online banner of MSNBC personalities that appears on the website shows only white personalities. Olbermann declined the invitation, citing his father's prolonged ill health and hospitalization and noted that the network has minority anchors, contributors and guests.&lt;ref name=&quot;McCann2010&quot;/&gt;

===Criticism of the Bush administration===
In Olbermann's &quot;[[Countdown with Keith Olbermann#Special comments|Special Comment]]&quot; segment on July 3, 2007, he called [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s [[commutation of sentence|commutation]] of [[Lewis Libby|Lewis &quot;Scooter&quot; Libby]]'s prison sentence the &quot;[[last straw]]&quot; and called for the resignation of Bush and [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2007a&quot;/&gt;

On his February 14, 2008 &quot;Special Comments&quot; segment, Olbermann castigated Bush for threatening to veto an extension of the [[Protect America Act of 2007|Protect America Act]] unless it provided full [[immunity from prosecution|immunity]] from lawsuits to [[Telecommunication|telecom]] companies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Protect America Act&quot;/&gt; During the same commentary, Olbermann called Bush a [[fascism|fascist]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Protect America Act&quot; /&gt;

In a special comment on May 14, 2008, Olbermann criticized Bush for announcing that he had stopped playing [[golf]] in honor of American soldiers who died in the [[Iraq war]]. He stated that Bush never should have started the war in the first place, and he accused Bush of dishonesty and [[war crime]]s.&lt;ref name=boyer/&gt;

==Baseball fan==
Olbermann is a dedicated [[baseball]] fan and historian of the sport, with membership in the [[Society for American Baseball Research]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keith2006&quot;/&gt; In 1973, when he was only 14 years old, Card Memorabilia Associates published his book ''The Major League Coaches: 1921â1973''. The September issue of Beckett Sports Collectibles Vintage included a T206 card that depicted Olbermann in a 1905-era New York Giants uniform.&lt;ref name=&quot;beckett&quot;/&gt; He argues that [[San Francisco Giants|New York Giants]] baseball player [[Fred Merkle]] has been unduly criticized for his [[Merkle's Boner|infamous baserunning mistake]].&lt;ref name=&quot;justice_for_merkle&quot;/&gt; He contributed the foreword to ''More Than Merkle'' (ISBN 0-8032-1056-6), a book requesting amnesty for &quot;[[Merkle's Boner]]&quot;. Olbermann was also one of the founders of the first experts' [[fantasy baseball]] league, the ''[[USA Today]] [[Sports Weekly|Baseball Weekly]]'' [[LABR|League of Alternative Baseball Reality]], and he gave the league its nickname &quot;LABR&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;LABR&quot;/&gt; Olbermann wrote the foreword to the 2009 [[Baseball Prospectus]] Annual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_q&quot;/&gt;

In March 2009, Olbermann began a baseball-related blog entitled [http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/ Baseball Nerd]. He has also written a series of articles on baseball cards for the ''Sports Collectors Digest''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_r&quot;/&gt;

==Personal life==
In June 2006, Olbermann began dating Katy Tur, now a reporter with [[WNBC-TV]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rodrick&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Shister&quot;/&gt; According to Mediaite, the couple broke up in 2009 after three years of cohabitation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2010&quot;/&gt;

Olbermann suffers from a mild case of [[coeliac disease]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2005a&quot;/&gt; as well as [[restless legs syndrome]].&lt;ref name=&quot;boyer&quot; /&gt; In August 1980, he also suffered a head injury while &quot;leaping&quot; onto the NYC subway.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_2009b&quot;/&gt; This head injury permanently upset his [[Equilibrioception|equilibrium]], resulting in his avoidance of driving.&lt;ref name=boyer /&gt; Along with [[Bob Costas]], he supports the [[Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation]] as an honorary board member.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ref_s&quot;/&gt;

During a period in the mid-1990s, Olbermann appeared in a series of [[Boston Market]] advertisements, in which he would instruct a group of underweight models to &quot;Eat something!&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Solo&quot;/&gt;

Olbermann's father, Theodore, died on March 13, 2010 of complications from [[colon (anatomy)|colon]] surgery the previous September. His mother had died several months before.&lt;ref name=&quot;father death&quot;/&gt; Olbermann had cited the need to spend time with his father for taking a leave of absence shortly before his father's death, occasionally recording segments to air at the beginning of the shows which [[Lawrence O'Donnell]] guest hosted in his absence, giving his views on the state of the American [[Health care in the United States|health care system]] and updating viewers on his father's condition.&lt;ref name=&quot;mediaite&quot;/&gt;
