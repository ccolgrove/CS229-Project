*The stand-off between the CPI(M) and the Catholic Church in Kerala took another nasty turn with CPM state secretary Pinarayi Vijayan demanding that the church withdraw a controversial pastoral letter issued recently.The letter had recommended a &quot;liberation struggle&quot; on the lines of the one in the 1950s to liberate the education sector in Kerala from state control, so that the management can charge fees and capitation without government intervene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://archive.gulfnews.com/articles/07/07/18/10139983.html |title=Pinarayi wants pastoral letter retracted |publisher=Gulf News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*On 16 October 2007, Pinarayi had called Paul Chitilapally, the [[bishop]] of Thamarassery in Kerala, as a &quot;wretched creature&quot; for his lie. He was speaking in a [[memorial]] remembrance of Mathai Chacko, [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLA]] from Thamarassery and a CPM member.He said âA lie is a lie, and just because it is uttered by a bishop it does not become a holy lieâ . Later, the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Kerala is up in arms against the CPM leadership as his comments against the bishop. However, he repeated the wordings and stick with the comments he had mentioned. This made a heated discussion among the Catholic community across the state and has protested against his speech by closing all educational institutions and churches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/News/PoliticsNation/Unfazed_Pinarayi_continues_to_attack_bishop/articleshow/2465313.cms |title=Unfazed Pinarayi continues to attack bishop |publisher=The Economic Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/10/17/stories/2007101753550600.htm |title=Do not vitiate social climate, says Pinarayi |publisher=The Hindu | location=Chennai, India |date=17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
