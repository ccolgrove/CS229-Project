The '''United States men's national soccer team''' represents the [[United States]] in international [[association football]] (soccer) competitions. It is controlled by the [[United States Soccer Federation]] and competes in [[CONCACAF]] (the Confederation of North, Central American and Caribbean Association Football). The team is ranked 34th in the world according to the [[FIFA World Rankings]], and 37th in the [[World Football Elo Ratings]]. They have appeared in the last six [[FIFA World Cup]]s and hosted the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 edition]]. 

The men's national team competes in the FIFA World Cup and the FIFA Confederations Cup, in addition to the CONCACAF Gold Cup and other competitions by invitation. They achieved a [[CONCACAF]]-best 3rd place in the 1930 World Cup. After qualifying for the 1934 World Cup, and withdrawing in 1938, the next World Cup participation came in the 1950 tournament, causing an upset by [[England v United States (1950)|beating England 1â0]] in their second group match. After 1950, the USA didn't qualify for the World Cup again until 1990.

After the 1990 World Cup, the USA qualified automatically as hosts in the 1994 World Cup, losing to Brazil in the round of sixteen. From then on, the team has qualified for every World Cup since, up to and including the 2010 World Cup.

The national team has improved in international level, reaching the finals of the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup]], eliminating top ranked Spain in the semi-finals and narrowly losing to five times champion Brazil 3-2. 

==History==
===1880s to 1940s===
In 1884, the United States and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] played at [[Newark, New Jersey]], making it the first international match held outside of the United Kingdom; the Canadians won the match 1â0.  The following year, a fixture at the same venue resulted in the U.S. winning after scoring the only goal of the game. Neither match was officially recognized. Thirty years later, the United States played its first official international match under the auspices of [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] against [[Sweden national football team|Sweden]] in [[Stockholm]], which the U.S. won 3â2, with goals from [[Dick Spalding]], [[Charles Ellis (soccer)|Charles Ellis]] and [[Harry Cooper (soccer)|Harry Cooper]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Litterer|first=Dave|title=The Year in American Soccer â 1916 |url=http://homepages.sover.net/~spectrum/year/1916.html|accessdate=29 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. won both the silver and bronze medals in men's soccer at the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] held in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. The tournament featured only three teams: Galt F.C. from Canada and Christian Brothers College and St. Rose Parish from the United States. Galt defeated both American teams to win the gold. Christian Brothers defeated St. Rose in a third match after two scoreless draws.

In the [[1930 FIFA World Cup|1930 World Cup]], the U.S. finished third, beating [[Belgium national football team|Belgium]] 3â0 at [[Estadio Gran Parque Central]] in [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]].

In the next match, the United States earned a 3â0 victory over [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]]. For many years, FIFA credited [[Bert Patenaude]] with the first and third goals and his teammate [[Tom Florie]] with the second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=FIFA: USA â Paraguay match report| publisher=[[FIFA]] | url=http://fifaworldcup.yahoo.com/06/en/w/pwc/mr_1097.html| accessdate=2006-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources described the second goal as having been scored by Patenaude&lt;ref name=&quot;trick&quot;&gt;{{cite news | title= CNN/Sports Illustrated â Bert Patenaude | publisher=CNN | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/soccer/world/2002/world_cup/hof/patenaude/ | accessdate=2006-06-09| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1WAy14 | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;PWC&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Planet World Cup â World Cup Trivia | publisher=PlanetWorldCup.com | url=http://www.planetworldcup.com/STATS/statrecs.html | accessdate=2006-06-09| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1WayiN | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; or by Paraguayan Ramon Gonzales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Football Association 20 World Cup Facts | publisher=[[The FA]] | url=http://www.thefa.com/Features/EuropeanLeagues/Postings/2002/05/12004.htm | accessdate=2006-06-09 |archivedate=2009-02-01 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20090201094121/http://www.thefa.com/Features/EuropeanLeagues/Postings/2002/05/12004.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2006, FIFA announced that it had accepted evidence from &quot;various historians and football fans&quot; that Patenaude scored all three goals, and was thus the first person to score a [[hat trick]] in a World Cup finals tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = FIFA World Cup hat-tricks | publisher = [[FIFA]] | url=http://www.fifa.com/infoplus/IP-399_03A_hat-tricks.pdf |format=PDF| accessdate=2006-11-10 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061119092914/http://www.fifa.com/infoplus/IP-399_03A_hat-tricks.pdf  |archivedate = 2006-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having reached the semifinals with the two wins, the American side lost 6â1 to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]]. Using the overall tournament records, FIFA credited the U.S. with a third place finish ahead of fellow semi-finalist [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/edition=1/awards/index.html|title=1930 FIFA World Cup Uruguay â Awards|publisher=Fifa.com|accessdate=5 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The finish remains the team's best World Cup result and is the highest finish of any team from outside of [[CONMEBOL]] and [[UEFA]], the South American and European confederations, respectively.

Due to FIFA not wanting interference with the newly founded [[FIFA World Cup]] no official tournament was fielded in the [[1932 Summer Olympics|1932 Olympic Games]]. FIFA claimed the tournament would not be popular in the United States, so it would not be cost efficient to assist in the running of the tournament during struggling economic times. As a result, an informal tournament was organized{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}  including local rivals with the United States finishing first, followed by Mexico and Canada. The Olympic Tournament was reinstated in the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]].

===1950s to 1970s===
The [[1950 FIFA World Cup|1950 World Cup]] was the United States's first Wold Cup appearance since 1934. The USA lost its first match 3â1 against [[Spain national football team|Spain]], but then [[England v United States (1950)|won 1â0]] against [[England national football team|England]] at [[IndependÃªncia Stadium]], in the city of [[Belo Horizonte]]. The result is considered one of the greatest upsets in the history of sports. Months before the famous World Cup loss to the USA, England had beaten an all-star &quot;rest of Europe&quot; side 6â1 in an exhibition match.  Sports Illustrated and Soccer Digest have called World Cup upset by the Americans in 1950 the &quot;Miracle on Grass,&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=AFP/Getty Images |url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/0906/soccer.biggest.us.wins.in.history/content.10.html |title=1950 World Cup vs. England - Biggest Wins in U.S. Soccer History - Photos - SI.com |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1Wci5P | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the [[Miracle on Ice]]. In USA's third game of the 1950 tournament, a defeat to [[Chile national football team|Chile]] by a 5â2 margin saw the U.S. eliminated from the tournament. It would be four decades before the United States made another appearance at the World Cup Finals.

===1980s===
After the enthusiasm caused by the creation and rise of the [[North American Soccer League]] in the 1970s, it seemed as though the U.S. men's national team would soon become a powerful force in world soccer. Such hopes were not realized, however, and the United States was not considered a strong side in this era. From 1981 to 1983, only two international matches were played.

To provide a more stable national team program and renew interest in the NASL, U.S. Soccer entered the national team into the league for the 1983 season as [[Team America (NASL)|Team America]]. This team lacked the continuity and regularity of training that conventional clubs enjoy, and many players were unwilling to play for the team instead of their own clubs. Embarrassingly, Team America finished the season at the bottom of the league. Recognizing that it had not achieved its objectives, U.S Soccer cancelled this experiment, and the national team was withdrawn from the NASL.

U.S. Soccer made the decision to target the [[1984 Summer Olympics]] in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], [[California]] and the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]] as means of rebuilding the national team and its fan base. The [[International Olympic Committee]] provided what appeared to be a major boost to the United States' chances of advancing beyond the group stage when it declared that Olympic teams from outside [[UEFA|Europe]] and [[CONMEBOL|South America]] could field full senior teams as long as those senior players had never played in a World Cup, including professionals. U.S. Soccer immediately rearranged its [[United States at the 1984 Summer Olympics|Olympic roster]], cutting many collegiate players and replacing them with professionals. Despite this, the U.S. [[Football at the 1984 Summer Olympics|finished 1â1â1]] and failed to make the second round.

By the end of 1984, the NASL had folded and there was no senior outdoor soccer league operating in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F00C1EFA355C0C718EDDAD0894DD484D81&amp;n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fS%2fSoccer |title=U.S. Soccer Team Hindered |publisher=Select.nytimes.com |date= April 22, 1985|accessdate=2010-05-05 | first=Alex | last=Yannis}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, many top American players, such as [[John Kerr (soccer)|John Kerr]], [[Paul Caligiuri]], [[Eric Eichmann]], and [[Bruce Murray (soccer)|Bruce Murray]], moved overseas, primarily to Europe.

The United States did bid to host the 1986 World Cup after [[Colombia]] withdrew due to economic concerns. However, Mexico beat out the U.S. and Canada to host the tournament, despite concerns that the tournament would have to be moved again because of a major earthquake that hit Mexico shortly before the tournament.

In the last game of the qualifying tournament, the U.S. needed only a draw against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], whom the U.S. had beaten 3â0 in the Olympics the year before, in order to reach the final qualification group against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] and [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]]. U.S. Soccer scheduled the game to be played at [[El Camino College]] in [[Torrance, California|Torrance]], California, an area with many Costa Rican expatriates, and marketed the game almost exclusively to the Costa Rican community, even providing Costa Rican folk dances as halftime entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/inside_game/michael_lewis/news/2000/11/10/lewis_history/ |title=CNNSI.com â Inside Game â Michael Lewis â Offside Remarks â CNNSI.com's Lewis: Learning from history â Friday November 10, 2000 07:29&amp;nbsp;PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-05| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1Wh6Yt | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 35th minute goal by [[Evaristo Coronado]] won the match for Costa Rica and kept the United States from reaching its fourth World Cup finals.&lt;ref&gt;http://us-soccer.com/secured/articles/viewArticle.jsp_3063.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, U.S. Soccer attempted to re-implement its national-team-as-club concept, offering contracts to national team players in order to build an international team with something of a club ethos, while loaning them out to their club teams, saving U.S. Soccer the expense of their salaries. This brought many key veterans back to the team, while the success of the NASL a decade earlier had created an influx of talent from burgeoning grass-roots level clubs and youth programs. Thus U.S. Soccer sought to establish a more stable foundation for participation in the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] than had existed for previous tournaments.

===1990s: the rebirth of American soccer===

For the [[1990 FIFA World Cup|1990 World Cup]] in Italy, two of the team's more experienced players, [[Rick Davis]] and [[Hugo PÃ©rez (soccer)|Hugo Perez]], were recovering from serious injuries and unavailable for selection, and manager [[Bob Gansler]] selected many inexperienced players and recent college graduates. The U.S. lost all three games to [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]] and [[Austria national football team|Austria]].

In March 1991, the United States won the North America Cup, tying [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2â2 and beating [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] 2â0. This was followed in May by a 1â0 victory over [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] in the [[World Series of Soccer]]. The national team then went undefeated in the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1991 Gold Cup]], beating Mexico 2â0 in the semifinals and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 4â3 on [[penalty kick]]s after a 0â0 draw in the final. In 1992, the U.S. continued its run of success, taking the [[1992 U.S. Cup|U.S. Cup]] with victories over [[Republic of Ireland national football team|Ireland]] and [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], followed by a draw with Italy.

In 1989, FIFA named the United States as the host of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], but it did so under significant international criticism because of the perceived weakness of the national team and the lack of a professional outdoor league. This criticism diminished somewhat when a 1â0 win against Trinidad and Tobago, the U.S.'s first away win in nearly two years, in the last match of the [[1989 CONCACAF Championship]], earned the United States its first World Cup appearance in 40 years.

Having qualified automatically as the host of the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]], the U.S. opened its tournament schedule with a 1â1 draw against [[Switzerland national football team|Switzerland]] in the [[Pontiac Silverdome]] in the suburbs of [[Detroit]], the first World Cup game played indoors. In its second game, the U.S. faced [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]], then ranked fourth in the world, at the [[Rose Bowl (stadium)|Rose Bowl]]. Aided by an [[own goal]] from [[AndrÃ©s Escobar]], the United States won 2â1.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Michael.

) Despite a 1â0 loss to [[Romania national football team|Romania]] in its final group game, the U.S. made it to the knockout round for the first time since 1930.  In the group of 16, the U.S. lost 1â0 to the eventual champion [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Palmer |first=Kevin |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=370490&amp;root=worldcup&amp;&amp;cc=5901 |title=ESPNsoccernet â World Cup â 'Winning is the only option' |publisher=Soccernet.espn.go.com |date=2006-06-09 |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] in [[France]], the team lost all three group matches, 2-0 to {{nft|Germany}}, 2-1 to [[Iran national football team|Iran]], and 1-0 to {{nft|Yugoslavia}}, and so finished in last place in its group and 32nd in the field of 32. Head coach [[Steve Sampson]] received much of the blame for the performance as a result of abruptly cutting team captain [[John Harkes]], whom Sampson had ironically named &quot;Captain for Life&quot; shortly before, as well as several other players who were instrumental to the qualifying effort, from the squad.&lt;ref name=&quot;1998wc&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title= Sampson destroyed US unity with late changes to lineup | work=SoccerTimes.com | url=http://www.soccertimes.com/oped/1998/jun27.htm| accessdate = 2006-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It emerged in February 2010 that Sampson removed Harkes from the team due to Harkes allegedly having an affair with teammate [[Eric Wynalda]]'s wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Blum | first = Ronald | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/02/03/john-harkes-affair-soccer_n_447704.html | title= John Harkes Affair?

===21st century===
====2002 World Cup cycle====
The United States won the [[2002 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2002 Gold Cup]] to set up the team's best performance since 1930 in the [[2002 FIFA World Cup|2002 World Cup]], where the U.S. team reached the quarterfinals. The team reached the knockout stage after a 1â1â1 record in the group stage.  It started with a surprising 3â2 win over [[Portugal national football team|Portugal]], followed by a 1â1 tie with co-host and eventual fourth place finisher, [[Korea Republic national football team|South Korea]]. It then lost its third and final match 1â3 to Poland but still qualified for the second round when [[Park Ji-Sung]] of South Korea stunned Portugal with the eventual game winning goal.

This set the stage for a Second Round face-off with familiar continental rivals [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]]. Although the teams had played many times in both friendlies and in qualifying, they had never met in the World Cup.  The U.S. would win the game 2â0.  [[Brian McBride]] opened the scoring early in the match and [[Landon Donovan]] scored a second goal from a header off an [[Eddie Lewis]] cross.  That victory advanced the team to the quarterfinals, where they met [[Germany national football team|Germany]].  The team lost 1â0; after being denied a penalty when [[Torsten Frings]] handled the ball to prevent a [[Gregg Berhalter]] goal.  Germany went on to finish runners-up, losing to [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] in the final.

====2006 World Cup Cycle====
The United States followed up this success by winning its third Gold Cup, and second out of three, in [[2005 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2005]].

In the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]], after finishing top of the [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|CONCACAF qualification tournament]], the U.S. was drawn into [[2006 FIFA World Cup - Group E|Group E]] along with the [[Czech Republic national football team|Czech Republic]], [[Italy national football team|Italy]], and [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]].
The United States opened its tournament with a 3â0 loss to the Czech Republic. The team then drew 1â1 against Italy, thanks to an own goal from Zaccardo, ending up being the only opponent together along with France the Italian side failed to defeat in the tournament (officially, according to FIFA, France and Italy drew 1â1, although Italy won the tournament after a penalty shoot out).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/germany2006/results/matches/match=97410025/report.html |title=Match Report: Italy â USA |accessdate=June 16, 2006 |date=17 June 2006 |publisher=[[FIFA]] | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1Wje8R | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States was then knocked out of the tournament when beaten 2â1 by Ghana in its final group match.&lt;ref name=&quot;ghana06&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Ghana 2â1 USA |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/world_cup_2006/4853408.stm |work=[[BBC Sport]] |publisher=BBC |date=22 June 2006 |accessdate=12 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2010 World Cup Cycle====
After failing to maintain his 2002 success at the 2006 World Cup, [[Bruce Arena]] was eventually replaced by his assistant with the national team and [[C.D. Chivas USA|Chivas USA]] manager, [[Bob Bradley]], whose reign began with four wins and one draw in friendlies leading up to the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2007 Gold Cup]], hosted by the United States.

The U.S. won all three of its group stage matches, against [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]], [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], and [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]]. With a 2â1 win over [[Panama national football team|Panama]] in the quarterfinals, the U.S. advanced to face [[Canada men's national soccer team|Canada]] in the semifinals, winning 2â1. In the final, the United States came from behind to beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2â1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= U.S. defeats Mexico again in Gold Cup final | publisher=MSNBC| url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/19392141/ | accessdate=2007-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The team's disappointing [[Copa AmÃ©rica 2007]] campaign ended after three defeats in the group stage to [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]], [[Paraguay national football team|Paraguay]], and [[Colombia national football team|Colombia]]. The decision by U.S. Soccer to field what many considered a second-tier team was questioned by fans and media alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/news/story?id=443456&amp;cc=3888 |title=South American soccer federation miffed at U.S. |publisher=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |date=2007-07-04 |accessdate=2007-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the hallmarks of Bradley's tenure as national team manager has been his willingness to [[cap (sport)|cap]] a large number of players, many for their first time. This practice has been praised by those wanting to see a more diverse player pool for the national team, as well as criticized by those hoping for more consistency and leadership from core players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Krishnaiyer|first=Kartik|url=http://www.majorleaguesoccertalk.com/bob-bradleys-us-squad-stale-and-predictable/341|title=Bob Bradleyâs US Squad Stale and Predictable|date=2008-08-15|work=Major League Soccer Talk}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has coincided with many young American players like [[Freddy Adu]], [[Jozy Altidore]], [[Clint Dempsey]], [[Maurice Edu]], [[Brad Guzan]], [[Eddie Johnson (American soccer)|Eddie Johnson]], and [[Michael Parkhurst]] making their first moves from MLS to European clubs, meaning that more American players are gaining experience at the highest levels of club and international soccer than at any other time in the team's history.

In Summer 2009, the United States had one of the busiest stretches in its history.  For the [[2009 FIFA Confederations Cup|2009 Confederations Cup]] the U.S. was drawn into Group B with [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]], [[Egypt national football team|Egypt]], and [[Italy national football team|Italy]]. After losing 3â1 to Italy and 3â0 to Brazil, the United States made an unlikely comeback to finish second in the group and reach the semi-final on the second tie-breaker, goals scored, having scored four goals to Italy's three. This was achieved on the final day of group play when the United States beat Egypt 3â0 while Brazil beat Italy 3â0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8109905.stm|title=Egypt 3â0 USA |date=2009-06-21|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the semifinals, the U.S. defeated [[Spain national football team|Spain]] 2â0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8114585.stm|title=Spain 2â0 United States |date=2009-06-25|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=2009-06-30|first=Saj|last=Chowdhury}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, Spain was atop the [[FIFA World Rankings]] and was on a record run of 15 straight wins and 35 games undefeated (a record shared with Brazil).  With the win, the United States advanced to its first-ever final in a men's FIFA tournament; however, the team lost 3â2 to Brazil after leading 2â0 at half-time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/internationals/8120561.stm United States 3â2 Brazil] â BBC Sport&lt;/ref&gt;

Only a few days after the Confederations Cup Final, the United States hosted the [[2009 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2009 Gold Cup]], and was drawn into Group B with [[Grenada national football team|Grenada]], [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]].  Due to the fact that the U.S. had just played in the Confederations Cup and still had half of its World Cup qualifying campaign to go, Bob Bradley chose a side consisting of mostly reserves who had never really played together on the international stage and was criticized for selecting a &quot;B Side&quot; for the Continental tournament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/soccerinsider/2009/06/usa_gold_cup_roster.html | work=The Washington Post | title=USA Gold Cup Roster}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. began group play with a pair of victories over Grenada and Honduras, and won the group with a draw against Haiti.

In the quarterfinals, the United States defeated Panama 2â1 after extra time.  In the semifinals the U.S. faced Honduras for the second time in the tournament, and the third time in less than two months.  The United States beat Honduras 2â0 and advanced to its third consecutive Gold Cup final where the team faced Mexico in a rematch of the 2007 Gold Cup final.  The United States was beaten by Mexico 5â0, surrendering its 58-match unbeaten streak against CONCACAF opponents on U.S. soil. It was also the first home loss to Mexico since 1999.

* '''Qualification:'''
** The '''United States''' qualified for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]].

The U.S. won four of eight matches against [[Barbados national football team|Barbados]], [[Cuba national football team|Cuba]], [[Guatemala national football team|Guatemala]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] in the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Second Round|Second]] and [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Third Round|Third]] Rounds of [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Fourth Round|qualification]] for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup|2010 World Cup]] in [[South Africa]]. This qualified the United States for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification - CONCACAF Fourth Round|Fourth Round]], or Hexagonal, against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], [[El Salvador national football team|El Salvador]], [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], and [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]].

The U.S. began the Fourth Round by beating Mexico 2â0, a loss that extended the Mexican' losing streak against America on U.S. soil to 11 matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Noah |last=Davis |title=United States Rain On Mexico's World Cup Hopes |url=http://www.goal.com/en/news/8/main/2009/02/12/1105528/united-states-rain-on-mexicos-wc-hopes |work=[[Goal.com]] |date=2009-02-12 |accessdate=2009-06-25| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1Xk1bs | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Six weeks later, in the second match of the Fourth Round, the United States made a late rally to earn a 2â2 draw away to El Salvador.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Hejduk, Altidore lead U.S. rally for draw in El Salvador |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/national/2009-03-28-usa-elsalvador_N.htm |work=[[USA Today]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2009-06-25| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1XkSjM | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, Jozy Altidore became the youngest U.S. player to score a [[hat-trick]], and lead the United States to a 3â0 victory over Trinidad and Tobago.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Ronald |last=Blum |title=Altidore hat trick against Trinidad &amp; Tobago |url=http://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2009-04-01-3106056220_x.htm |work=USA Today |agency=Associated Press |date=2009-04-01 |accessdate=2009-06-25| archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/5mr1XlmxK | archivedate = 2010-01-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following another six week break from qualifying, the U.S. travelled to Costa Rica, where they were soundly defeated 3â1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first=Ives |last=Galarcep |title=U.S. team overwhelmed in every facet by Costa Rica |url=http://soccernet.espn.go.com/columns/story?id=652582&amp;sec=us&amp;root=us&amp;cc=5901 |work=[[ESPNsoccernet]] |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2009-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States rebounded three days later when they defeated Honduras 2â1. When qualifying resumed near the end of the summer of 2009, the United States suffered a 2â1 loss to Mexico at Estadio Azteca. A few weeks later, the United States came from behind to defeat El Salvador 2â1 at home after being down 1â0. The next week, the U.S. beat Trinidad and Tobago 1â0. On October 10, 2009, the United States secured qualification to the World Cup with a 3â2 win over Honduras.  Four days later, the U.S. secured first place in the Fourth Round with a dramatic 2â2 draw against Costa Rica.

====2010 FIFA World Cup====

{{2010 FIFA World Cup Group C|expanded=yes}}

After tying matches against [[England national football team|England]] (1â1) and [[Slovenia national football team|Slovenia]] (2â2), the US defeated [[Algeria national football team|Algeria]] through a Landon Donovan injury time goal and thus won the game, the first time that the USA has won its group in World Cup history. In the round of 16, the US lost to [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]], with Ghana once again winning 2â1, thus resulting in the elimination of the USA from the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=U.S. Falls to Ghana (in Soccer) |url=http://jumpinginpools.blogspot.com/2010/06/us-falls-to-ghana-in-soccer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, [[FIFA]] released their post tournament ranking of World Cup teams, and the USA finished in 23rd place. This finish was one spot above fellow Group C side England.

====2014 World Cup cycle====
As a result of his performance during the previous four-year cycle, [[Bob Bradley]] signed a four-year contract extension in early September 2010, though rumors emerged that Bradley had resigned and that, as in 2006, former Germany coach [[JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann]] would be hired to manage the team. However, these rumors were unfounded, and Bradley was officially re-signed by US Soccer. Prior to his re-appointment, Bradley and the US team got the cycle underway with a 2â0 defeat to Brazil in the [[New Meadowlands Stadium]]. This was followed by a 2â2 draw with Poland and a 0â0 draw with Colombia. The US played a B-team against South Africa and Chile, coming up with 1â0 and 1â1 results respectively. In preparation for the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the U.S. played three friendlies; a 2-1 defeat to Argentina, a 1-0 loss to Paraguay, and a 4-0 loss to Spain.

The United States hosted the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2011 Gold Cup]], and was drawn into Group C with Canada, Panama, and Guadeloupe. The U.S. advanced past the group stage with a pair of victories over Guadeloupe and Canada. However, the U.S. lost to Panama 2-1 in the second group stage match. This was the first defeat for the U.S. in a Gold Cup group stage match, and its first ever loss to Panama. In the quarterfinals, the United States defeated Jamaica 2â0. In the semifinals the U.S. avenged their group stage defeat with a 1-0 victory over Panama, and advanced to its fourth consecutive Gold Cup final where the team faced Mexico in a rematch of the 2009 Gold Cup final. The United States was beaten by Mexico 4-2, despite leading 2-0, extending Mexico's winning streak against the U.S. to three matches. It was also the second consecutive loss to Mexico on American soil.

On July 29, 2011, [[JÃ¼rgen Klinsmann]] was named by [[Sunil Gulati]] to be Bradley's successor as the national team's head coach. His first match, a friendly against Mexico on August 10, 2011, ended in a 1-1 draw.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ussoccer.com/News/Mens-National-Team/2011/08/MNT-Draw-Mexico-11-in-Klinsmann-Debut.aspx| title=MNT Draw Mexico 1-1 in Klinsmann Debut | date=10 August 2011 | work=ussoccer.com | accessdate=10 August 2011 | archiveurl = http://www.webcitation.org/61DA1pLQE | archivedate = 2011-08-25| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more friendlies against Costa Rica and Belgium in early September both ended in 1-0 losses. On October 8, the U.S. won its first game under Klinsmann 1-0 against Honduras. This was followed by a 1-0 defeat three days later to Ecuador. The United States traveled to Europe in November and lost 1-0 to France before coming up with a 3-2 win against Slovenia.

===Media coverage===
As with other national soccer federations in the world, [[United States Soccer Federation|U.S. Soccer]] owns the broadcast rights to all U.S. matches played in the United States, and all United States international friendlies.  It negotiates deals with media outlets to maximize revenue and exposure from the matches.

===Uniforms===
Since their first unofficial game against Canada, the uniforms have frequently featured white tops with blue shorts. In 1950, the US adopted a &quot;[[Peru national football team|Peru]]&quot; style kit by putting a diagonal stripe across their shirts. The stripe has been featured on &quot;third&quot; kits for 2003, 2004, and 2006, as well as on the current 2010 home, away and third uniforms. [[Adidas]] was the uniform provider for the United States from 1984 until 1994. Since 1995, [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] has been the uniform supplier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Better know a kit: A history of the modern U.S. soccer jersey| publisher=[Project 2010] | url=http://project2010.wordpress.com/2009/10/13/better-know-a-kit-a-history-of-the-modern-u-s-soccer-jersey/| accessdate=2010-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Supporters' groups===
The main [[supporter groups]] backing the United States men's national soccer team are [[Sam's Army]] and [[The American Outlaws]].  Sam's Army started shortly after the [[1994 FIFA World Cup|1994 World Cup]] in the United States, it now claims to have over 15,000 members.

The American Outlaws was started in [[Lincoln, Nebraska|Lincoln]], [[Nebraska]] as a local supporters' group. The group's membership attempted to address a lack of consistency from game to game in supporter organization and social events on match days.  To achieve this goal the American Outlaws became a nationwide, non-profit, supporters' group.

Sam's Army members wear red to matches, sing or chant throughout the match, and often bring huge American flags and other banners to the game.  The American Outlaws can be further distinguished by the fact that they wear American flag bandanas over their faces. The two groups are usually put together in a &quot;supporters' section&quot; at US home games.

==International rivalries==
===''North American Derby''===
{{Main|Mexico and United States association football rivalry}}
The [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] Soccer rivalry is a competitive [[sports rivalry]] that exists between the national teams of the two countries, widely considered as the two major powers of the [[CONCACAF]] federation. Matches between the two nations often attract much media attention, public interest and comment in both countries, but especially in Mexico. Although the first match was played in 1934, their rivalry was not considered major until recently, with the matches in the [[CONCACAF]] Gold Cups.

{{Main|United States men's national soccer team cup results}}

The United States has competed at the [[Summer Olympics]] (that tournament was considered a full international tournament), the [[FIFA World Cup]], the [[FIFA Confederations Cup]], as well as [[NAFC]] and [[CONCACAF]] regional tournaments. The U.S. has also played in the [[Copa AmÃ©rica]] by invitation, as well as several minor tournaments.

During the 2009 [[FIFA Confederations Cup]] the United States appeared in their first ever international tournament final. The United States upset top ranked Spain, 2â0, to advance to the final. In the final, the United States took an early 2â0 lead through goals from Clint Dempsey and Landon Donovan.  Brazil scored 3&amp;nbsp;second-half goals to defeat the United States, 2â3, and win the cup.

The best result for the United States in a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] came in 1930 when they finished in 3rd Place. In the [[FIFA Confederations Cup|Confederations Cup]], the United States has finished in third place in both 1992 and 1999, and were runner-up in the [[2009 Confederations Cup]].

In regional competitions, the United States had never finished higher than runner-up until the [[1991 CONCACAF Gold Cup]], the first competition in the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] format. Since then, they have finished as winners four times. Their best ever finish at the Copa AmÃ©rica came in a fourth place finish at the [[Copa AmÃ©rica 1995|1995 Copa AmÃ©rica]].
