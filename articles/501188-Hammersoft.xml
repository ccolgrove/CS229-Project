In [[vertebrate]]s, '''mucus''' ([[adjectival form]]: &quot;mucous&quot;) is a slippery secretion produced by, and covering, [[mucous membrane]]s. Mucous fluid is typically produced from mucous cells found in mucous glands.  Mucous cells secrete products that are rich in glycoproteins and water. Mucous fluid may also originate from mixed glands, which contain both [[serous]] and mucous cells. It is a [[viscous]] [[colloid]] containing [[antiseptic]] enzymes (such as [[lysozyme]]), [[immunoglobulin]]s, [[inorganic ions|inorganic salts]], proteins such as [[lactoferrin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = PK | last2 = Parsek | first2 = MR | last3 =  Greenberg | first3 = EP | last4 = Welsh | first4 = MJ | month = May | year = 2002 | title = A component of innate immunity prevents bacterial biofilm development | journal =  [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | volume = 417 | issue = 6888 | pages = 552â5 | pmid = 12037568 | doi = 10.1038/417552a}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[glycoprotein]]s known as [[mucins]] that are produced by [[goblet cell]]s in the mucous membranes and [[submucosal glands]]. This mucus serves to protect [[Epithelium|epithelial cells]] in the [[respiratory]], [[gastrointestinal]], [[urogenital]], visual, and auditory systems in [[mammals]]; the [[Epidermis (zoology)|epidermis]] in [[amphibians]]; and the [[gills]] in [[fish]]. A major function of this mucus is to protect against [[infectious agents]] such as [[fungi]], [[bacteria]] and [[viruses]]. The average human body produces about a litre of mucus per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://kidshealth.org/kid/talk/yucky/booger.html | title = What's a Booger? | work = KidsHealth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Osteichthyes|Bony fish]], [[hagfish]], [[snail]]s, [[slugs]], and some other [[invertebrates]] also produce external mucus. In addition to serving a protective function against [[infectious agents]], such mucus provides protection against [[toxins]] produced by [[predator]]s, can facilitate movement and may play a role in [[communication]].

==Respiratory system==
In the [[respiratory system]], mucus aids in the protection  of the [[lung]]s by trapping foreign particles that enter it, in particular, through the nose, during normal breathing. &quot;[[Phlegm]]&quot; is a specialized term for mucus that is restricted to the respiratory tract, whereas the term &quot;nasal mucus&quot; describes secretions of the [[nasal cavity|nasal]] passages. 

Nasal mucus is produced by the nasal [[mucosa]], and mucal tissues lining the [[airways]] ([[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]], [[bronchus]], [[bronchioles]]) is produced by specialized airway epithelial cells ([[goblet cells]]) and [[submucosal glands]]. Small particles such as dust, particulate [[pollutant]]s, and [[allergen]]s, as well as [[infectious agent]]s such as [[bacteria]] are caught in the viscous nasal or airway mucus and prevented from entering the system. This event along with the continual movement of the respiratory mucus layer toward the [[oropharynx]], helps prevent foreign objects from entering the lungs during breathing. In addition, mucus aids in moisturizing the inhaled air and prevents [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]] such as the [[Nasal cavity|nasal]] and [[respiratory epithelium|airway epithelia]] from drying out.&lt;ref name=&quot;annu-rev-physiol&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Increased mucus production in the respiratory tract is a symptom of many common illnesses, such as the [[common cold]] and [[influenza]]. Hypersecretion of mucus can occur in inflammatory respiratory diseases such as respiratory [[allergy|allergies]], [[asthma]], and [[chronic bronchitis]].&lt;ref name=&quot;annu-rev-physiol&quot; /&gt; The presence of mucus in the [[nose]] and [[throat]] is normal, but increased quantities can impede comfortable breathing and must be cleared by blowing the nose or [[expectoration|expectorating]] [[phlegm]] from the throat.

===Diseases involving mucus===
In general, nasal mucus is clear and thin,  serving to filter air during inhalation.  During times of infection, mucus can change colour to yellow or green either as a result of trapped [[bacteria]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/community/files/GetSmart_RunnyNose.htm|title=Runny Nose (with green or yellow mucus)|publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]]|work=Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080308233950/http://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/community/files/GetSmart_RunnyNose.htm|archivedate=Mar. 8, 2008|date=March 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; or due to the body's reaction to [[virus|viral]] infection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.health.arizona.edu/health_topics/general_health/phlegm.html | title = Yellow-green Phlegm and Other Myths | accessdate = 2007-10-22 | work = University of Arizona campus health services}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The green color of mucus comes from the heme group in the iron-containing enzyme [[myeloperoxidase]] secreted by white blood cells as a cytotoxic defense during a [[respiratory burst]].

In the case of bacterial infection, the bacterium becomes trapped in already-clogged [[Paranasal sinus|sinuses]], breeding in the moist, nutrient-rich environment.   [[Antibiotics]] may be used to treat the secondary infection in these cases, but will, in general, not help with the original cause.

In the case of a viral infection such as [[common cold|cold]] or [[influenza|flu]], the first stage and also the last stage of the infection cause the production of a clear, thin mucus in the nose or back of the throat. As the body begins to react to the virus (generally one to three days), mucus thickens and may turn yellow or green. Viral infections cannot be treated with antibiotics, and are a major avenue for their misuse. Treatment is generally symptom-based; often it is sufficient to allow the immune system to fight off the virus over time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.medterms.com/script/main/art.asp?articlekey=11557 | title = Definition of Viral Infection | accessdate = 2010-04-04 | work = MedicineNet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cystic fibrosis====
{{Main|Cystic fibrosis}}
[[Cystic fibrosis]] is an inherited disease that affects the entire body, but symptoms begin mostly in the lungs with extremely viscous (thick) production of mucus that is difficult to expel.

====Mucus as a medical symptom====
Increased mucus production in the upper respiratory tract is a symptom of many common ailments, such as the [[common cold]]. Nasal mucus may be removed by blowing the nose or by using traditional methods of [[nasal irrigation]]. Excess nasal mucus, as with a cold or [[allergies]] may be treated cautiously with [[decongestant]] medications. Excess mucus production in the bronchi and bronchioles, as may occur in [[asthma]], [[bronchitis]] or [[influenza]], may be treated with anti-inflammatory medications as a means of reducing the airway inflammation, which triggers mucus over-production. Thickening of mucus as a &quot;rebound&quot; effect following overuse of decongestants may produce nasal or sinus drainage problems and circumstances that promote infection.

===Cold weather and mucus===
During cold weather, the [[Cilium|cilia]], which normally sweep mucus away from the nostrils and toward the back of the throat (see [[respiratory epithelium]]), become sluggish or completely cease functioning.  This results in mucus running down the nose and dripping (a [[Rhinorrhea|runny nose]]).  Mucus also thickens in cold weather; when an individual comes in from the cold, the mucus thaws and begins to run before the cilia begin to work again.

==Digestive system==
In the digestive system, mucus is used as a lubricant for materials that must pass over membranes, e.g., food passing down the [[esophagus]].  A layer of mucus along the inner walls of the [[stomach]] is vital to protect the cell linings of that organ from the highly acidic environment within it. Mucus does not digest in the intestinal tract. Mucus is also secreted from glands within the rectum due to stimulation of the mucous membrane within. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Reproductive system==
In the female reproductive system, [[Cervix#Cervical mucus|cervical mucus]] prevents infection. The consistency of cervical mucus varies depending on the stage of a woman's menstrual cycle. At ovulation cervical mucus is clear, runny, and conducive to [[sperm]]; post-ovulation, mucus becomes thicker and is more likely to block sperm.{{citation needed|date=October 2009}}

In the male reproductive system, the [[seminal vesicles]] contribute up to 100% of the total volume of the [[semen]] and contain mucus, [[amino acid]]s, [[prostaglandin]]s, [[vitamin C]], and [[fructose]] as the main energy source for the sperm.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}
