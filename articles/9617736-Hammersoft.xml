<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="9617736" ns="0" title="List of successful U-boat commanders"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''List of successful U-boat commanders''' contains lists of the most successful [[Germany|German]] [[U-boat]] [[commander]]s in the two [[World War]]s based on total [[tonnage]].

The tonnage figures (and sometimes the number of ships sunk) is still being debated among historians. This is often due to [[convoy]] battles at night when an attacking &quot;[[Wolfpack (naval tactic)|wolfpack]]&quot; fired [[torpedo]]es into the convoy and two commanders claimed the same ship. Although post-war research has eliminated most of those doubtful victims, there are still some in question.

== World War I ==
This list contains the most successful German U-boats commanders during the [[First World War]] based on total tonnage. Only sunk commercial vessels are included, not military ([[warships]]) nor damaged ships.

== World War II ==
This list contains the most successful German U-boats commanders during the [[Second World War]] based on total tonnage. Only sunk commercial vessels are included, not military ([[warships]]) nor damaged ships.

With a higher score than Britainâs [[Malcolm David Wanklyn|Wanklyn]], in [[HMS Upholder (P37)|HMS ''Upholder'']], or Americaâs [[Richard O'Kane|OâKane]] in [[USS Tang (SS-306)|USS ''Tang'']] (both later sunk), [[Gianfranco Gazzana-Priaroggia]] and ''[[Italian submarine Leonardo da Vinci|Leonardo da Vinci]]'' were the most successful non-German submariner and submarine in the conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Blair p 740&lt;/ref&gt;

But the '''Aces of the Deep'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} were the ten [[Germany|German]] [[U-Boat]] commanders during [[World War II]] who sank the most enemy merchant ships during their naval services, ranked according to the total tonnage of the ships they sank. The term is related to [[flying ace]]{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}, a [[World War I]] name for a pilot who shot down five or more enemy planes. The currently accepted list is as follows:

The sinking caused dramatic publicity throughout the English-speaking world, while the German High Command systematically attempted to cover up this appalling error.
