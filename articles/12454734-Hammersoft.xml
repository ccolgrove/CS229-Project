'''4RK''', better known as '''ABC Capricornia''' is one of the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]]'s original regional radio stations, predating the Corporation's inception on 1 July 1932. 4RK, as it was known at the time, began broadcasting on 29 July 1931 and was owned by the [[Australian Broadcasting Company]]. The power was initially 2 kilowatts.  The transmitting equipment was established by Keith Thow of [[Standard Telephones and Cables|STC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=EP19310730.2.129.4|title=4RK Rockhampton|newspaper=Evening Post|Volume=CXII|issue=26|date=30 July 1931|Page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;
