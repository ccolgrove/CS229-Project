==Career==
===Live comedy===
While attending [[BYU]], Tufts joined The Garrens Comedy Troupe,&lt;ref name=&quot;Guyâs Apartment&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zqURtrG7tY0 &quot;Guyâs Apartment&quot;] by The Garrens Comedy Troupe, Provo, Utah, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ditch The Girl&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f7Vma_dazbA âDitch The Girl&quot;] by The Garrens Comedy Troupe, Provo, Utah, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; a popular sketch and improvisational troupe that performed live shows to often sold-out audiences nearly every weekend. It was on The Garrens that Tufts got his first professional experience writing and performing for paying audiences and was involved with the troupe for over two years. After graduation, Tufts was asked to help launch the Utah chapter of [[ComedySportz]], a national improvisational comedy franchise. Tufts became the first improvisational teacher for the new Utah cast and principal cast member for live shows. Tufts performed with ComedySportz for over two years.

In 2010, Tufts returned to ComedySportz and currently performs periodically.

===Writing===
After graduating from BYU, Tufts began his career as a professional writer, writing commercials and other forms or marketing, advertising, and promotions for [[advertising agencies]] and [[production companies]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Keep It Simple&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hoj5Scm7HaY âKeep It Simple&quot;] Tivoli - IBM, written by Daryn Tufts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Good Guys In, Bad Guys Out&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GJSg8TS8cmg âGood Guys In, Bad Guys Out&quot;] Tivoli â IBM, written by Daryn Tufts&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;How Important Is Your Vision To You&quot;&gt;[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOglvcgTbbU âHow Important Is Your Vision To You?&quot;] The Eye Institute of Utah, written and directed by Daryn Tufts&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after, he began to experiment with longer forms of writing, including [[screenplays]] and [[novels]].

===LDS Cinema===
Tuftsâ film career began in 2002 with the release of [[The Singles Ward]], regarded as the first LDS comedy feature film. Tufts played the role of Eldon, the Franklin Day Planner enthusiast and acted as [[script doctor]], writing and editing several scenes in the filmâs script. [[The Singles Ward]] was a [[box office]] success that launched the genre of LDS comedies as well as Tuftsâ acting career. 

After [[The Singles Ward]], Tufts went on to appear in the films [[The R.M.]], [[The Home Teachers]], [[Church Ball]], and [[The Singles 2nd Ward]], the sequel to the 2002 film.

===American Mormon===
In 2004, Tufts began working on [[American Mormon]], his first [[Documentary film|documentary]]. Partnering with local actor and businessman Jed Knudsen, Tufts began traveling across the United States, shooting the documentary. American Mormon was shot in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New York City]], [[New Orleans]], [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]], [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]] [[Los Angeles]] and other locations. Tufts, on camera, approached random people. Upon their consent, Tufts interviewed these people, âman on the streetâ style with one objective: find out what people across the United States know about [[Mormons]]. After several weeks of traveling and shooting, Tufts and Knudsen began to compile the footage which would become a comedic cross-section of people from all over the country. 

Released by [[Excel Entertainment Group]] in 2005, American Mormon took a unique look at the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|LDS]] religion and culture from an outside point of view. The documentary was highly successful and led Excel to partner with Tufts and Knudsen to produce a sequel - [[American Mormon in Europe]]. For it, the two men traveled across Western Europe, including [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. Along with discovering what people from different parts of the world knew about Mormons, Tufts and Knudsen decided to add a new element to this documentary. All over Europe, the two men also talked, on camera, with members of the LDS faith to document the experiences of people who are members of the LDS church outside of the United States.  This included an in-depth discussion with LDS members who lived in West and [[East Berlin]] when the [[Berlin Wall]] came down and a visit to the [[Gadfield Elm Chapel]], the oldest LDS chapel on earth, in [[Herefordshire, England]].

American Mormon in Europe was released by [[Excel Entertainment Group]] in 2006.

===Stalking Santa===
In 2006, Tufts released [[Stalking Santa]], his first national feature film that was not associated with any LDS characters, references, or themes. The film is a comedy centered around a manâs obsession to scientifically prove the existence of Santa Claus. Daryn was the screenwriter and co-producer of the project and acted in one of the lead roles. 

Stalking Santa was [[Executive Produced]] by [[William Shatner]], who also acted as narrator of the film. [[Greg Kiefer]], the other [[Executive Producer]], directed the film through [[Cosmic Pictures]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].

===Directing===
In 2009, Tufts directed his first feature film, ''[[My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010 film)|My Girlfriend's Boyfriend]]'', which he also wrote. Produced by Rick McFarland (FiftyFilms) and [[Alyssa Milano]] (Peace by Peace Productions), ''[[My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010 film)|My Girlfriend's Boyfriend]]'' stars [[Alyssa Milano]], [[Christopher Gorham]], [[Michael Landes]], [[Beau Bridges]], [[Carol Kane]], and [[Tom Lenk]].

In 2011, Tufts directed his second feature film, ''[[Inside (2012 film)|Inside]]'', which he also wrote. The movie stars [[Luke Goss]], [[Paul Rae]], [[Isaac C. Singleton, Jr.]], and [[Derek Phillips (actor)]].

===My Girlfriend's Boyfriend===
In ''[[My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010 film)|My Girlfriend's Boyfriend]]''', [[Alyssa Milano]] plays Jesse Young, a woman who must choose between two very different, yet seemingly ideal men: sexy but struggling writer Ethan [[Christopher Gorham]] and button-down advertising exec Troy [[Michael Landes]]. ''[[My Girlfriend's Boyfriend (2010 film)|My Girlfriend's Boyfriend]]'' is a funny, sweet-natured examination of modern sexual mores that asks the question: what happens when a girl meets Mr. Right, after already meeting the right guy?

''My Girlfriend's Boyfriend'' had its world premiere April 24, 2010 to a sold out audience at the [[Newport Beach Film Festival]] in [[Newport Beach, California]]. 

On October 22, 2010, the movie began a limited theatrical run in Salt Lake City, Utah, and scored $10,300 on its opening weekend on just two screens. That per-screen average, of $5,150, was higher than that of many of the weekend's top 10 films, resulting in the film's expansion to three other theaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Salt Lake Tribune|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogs/moviecricket/50551567-66/boyfriend-weekend-girlfriend-lake.html.csp|title=Utah-made &quot;Boyfriend&quot; plays a little wider|date=2010-10-27|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''My Girlfriend's Boyfriend'' also received positive critical reviews from several local critics, including [[The Salt Lake Tribune]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Salt Lake Tribune|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/entertainment/50496303-81/jesse-boyfriend-ethan-romantic.html.csp|title=Review: A âBoyfriendâ that has plenty of charm |date=2010-10-21|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Deseret News]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Deseret News|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700078068/My-Girlfriends-Boyfriend-is-a-sweet-romance.html|title='My Girlfriend's Boyfriend' is a sweet romance |date=2010-11-01|accessdate=2010-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Salt Lake City's two major newspapers. 

In December, 2010, ''My Girlfriend's Boyfriend'' experienced a national release through WB Digital's pay-per-view and VOD platforms. The movie is also currently available in High Definition through NetFlix Streaming Video On-Demand, Hulu, and iTunes. 

On March 1, 2011, ''My Girlfriend's Boyfriend'' was released on DVD. 

Outside of the United States, the film was released in Germany, Benelux, Spain, Portugal, Italy, Australia, New Zealand, the Mideast, the U.K., Latin America, Central and Eastern Europe, Indonesia, and other areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = The Hollywood Reporter|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/film/news/e3ic89e89e7caab6358e69d9cc5c0f04b9f|date=2010-09-06|title=Opus inks deals for Alyssa Milano film|accessdate=2010-09-09}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;
