==Events==
PACE has hosted and participated in a number of events worldwide to help raise awareness about [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|pneumococcal disease]].

On May 4, 2007, the launch of PACE was announced at a press conference in [[Washington, D.C.]] At the event, PACE gave its first annual Global Leadership Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabin.org/advocacy-education/pace/pace-global-leadership-award/ |title=PACE Global Leadership Award}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Global Leadership Award is given annually by PACE to recognize an individual, organization or country that has championed [[pneumococcal disease]] prevention and made a significant contribution towards policies that advance the introduction of [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]]s. PACE Global Leadership Award recipients include: Dr. Thomas Cherian, who has helped accelerate the surveillance of [[pneumonia]] throughout the developing world and contributed to research on the global [[pneumococcal]] [[disease burden]]. The Health Minister of [[Rwanda]] â the first country in [[Africa]] to introduce [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine]]s; and the Health Minister of [[Costa Rica]] â the first country in [[Latin America]] to implement a nationwide vaccination program.&lt;ref name=&quot;sabin.org&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabin.org/pressroom/releases/2007/05/07/global-health-experts-unite-combat-worlds-leading-vaccine-preventable/ |title=Global Health Experts Unite to Combat the Worldâs Leading Vaccine-Preventable Killer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2008, PACE along with the [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]], PATH and PneumoADIP, participated in the 6th International Symposium on Pneumococci and Pneumococcal Diseases (ISPPD-6)&lt;ref name=&quot;International Symposium on Pneumococci&quot;&gt;The Lancet (2009). [http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(09)61204-6/fulltext/ &quot;Burden of disease caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae in children younger than 5 years: global estimates&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Reykjavik]], [[Iceland]]. PACE issued a Global Call to Action on Pneumococcal Disease Prevention,&lt;ref name=&quot;PACE Call to Action&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabin.org/advocacy-education/pace/call-to-action/ |title=PACE Call to Action}}&lt;/ref&gt; urging governments to take steps to make financing available for access to [[pneumococcal vaccines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabin.org/pressroom/releases/2008/10/27/health-experts-call-global-leaders-ensure-access-life-saving-pneumococ/ |title=Health Experts Call on Global Leaders to Ensure Access to Life-Saving Pneumococcal Vaccines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24, 2008, over 100 professional medical societies, institutions and organizations from around the world had signed PACEâs Global Call to Action to urge governments, donors and industry to ensure access to [[pneumococcal vaccines]]. [[Rwanda]] announced that they would be one of the first two countries to introduce the [[pneumococcal vaccine]] into its national immunization program in the spring of 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabin.org/pressroom/releases/2008/10/24/medical-societies-join-forces-assure-equal-access-life-saving-vaccines/ |title=Medical Societies Join Forces to Assure Equal Access to Life-Saving Vaccines}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 3, 2009, PACE, in conjunction with the [[Sabin Vaccine Institute]], PneumoADIP and the [[World Health Organization|WHO]], hosted a media briefing at the Sabin Vaccine Institute's 4th Regional Pneumococcal Symposium&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabin.org/events/fourth-regional-pneumococcal-symposium/ |title=Sabin Vaccine Institute's 4th Regional Pneumococcal Symposium}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Johannesburg]], [[South Africa]], at which PACE released two new studies, ''Sequelae Due to Bacterial Meningitis among African Children: A Systematic Literature Review'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequelae Due to Bacterial Meningitis among African Children&quot;&gt;Ramakrishnan, Meenakshi, et al. (2009). [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/7/47/abstract/ &quot;Sequelae due to bacterial meningitis among African children: a systematic literature review&quot;], BMC Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bacterial Infections in Persons with Sickle Cell Disease: A Review of Data from Africa with a Focus on Pneumococcal Disease''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacterial Infections in Persons with Sickle Cell Disease&quot;&gt;[http://www.sabin.org/pressroom/releases/2010/04/28/vaccines-preventing-pneumococcal-disease-provide-vital-protection-afri &quot;Bacterial Infections in Persons with Sickle Cell Disease: A Review of Data from Africa with a Focus on Pneumococcal Disease&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The event also sought to highlight [[South Africa]]'s introduction of the [[pneumococcal vaccine]], with support from the [[GAVI Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sabin.org/pressroom/releases/2009/03/03/pace-studies-unveiled-sabins-4th-regional-pneumo-symposium-reinforce-n/ |title=PACE Studies Unveiled at Sabin's 4th Regional Pneumo Symposium Reinforce Need for Pneumococcal Vaccine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, PACE conducted a briefing and one-on-one meetings with members of the [[European Parliament]] and [[European Commission]] to recommend action on [[Streptococcus pneumoniae|pneumococcal disease]].

On November 1â2, 2009 PACE, a member of the World Pneumonia Day Coalition, sponsored a press conference, policymaker roundtable, rally, march and symposium to commemorate [[World Pneumonia Day]] in [[Bangladesh]] where the countryâs leaders and advocates focused their attention on the prevention and treatment of [[pneumonia]]. These events and activities were led by PACE member Dr. Samir K. Saha. PACE [http://worldpneumoniaday.org/ World Pneumonia Day] events also took place in [[Brazil]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[Kenya]], [[South Africa]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Israel]], [[Pakistan]], [[China]] and the [[Philippines]].

==Global Call to Action on Pneumococcal Disease==
In 2008, PACE launched its Global Call to Action on Pneumococcal Disease Prevention&lt;ref name=&quot;PACE Call to Action&quot;/&gt; in partnership with 114 professional medical societies, organizations and institutions from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sabin.org/advocacy-education/pace/partners |title=PACE Partners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==PACE Commissioned Studies==
PACE commissioned two studies, ''Sequelae Due to Bacterial Meningitis among African Children: A Systematic Literature Review'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequelae Due to Bacterial Meningitis among African Children&quot;&gt;Ramakrishnan, Meenakshi, et al. (2009). [http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7015/7/47/abstract/ &quot;Sequelae due to bacterial meningitis among African children: a systematic literature review&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Bacterial Infections in Persons with Sickle Cell Disease: A Review of Data from Africa with a Focus on Pneumococcal Disease'',&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacterial Infections in Persons with Sickle Cell Disease&quot;/&gt; that highlighted the increased risk for children in [[Africa]] of contracting [[pneumococcal disease]] and suffering its devastating consequences. It was found that African children who contract [[pneumococcal disease]] are 36 times as likely to have [[sickle-cell]] disease, a blood disorder prevalent in African children that increases the risk for infectious diseases and early death.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sequelae Due to Bacterial Meningitis among African Children&quot; /&gt; Inn addition, the research showed that up to one-half of all children in [[Africa]] who get [[pneumococcal meningitis]] will either die or be disabled as a consequence of the disease, even when treated with antibiotics in a hospital. As the three leading causes of bacterial [[meningitis]] in childhood are vaccine preventable, the regular use of [[pneumococcal conjugate vaccine|conjugate vaccines]] would reduce the high burden of morbidity and mortality in both epidemic and endemic settings.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bacterial Infections in Persons with Sickle Cell Disease&quot; /&gt;
