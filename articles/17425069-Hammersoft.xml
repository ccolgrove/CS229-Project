'''SM City Fairview''' is a large shopping mall in the Philippines owned and operated by [[SM Prime Holdings]]. It is located along Quirino Highway, Regalado Ave, Novaliches, Quezon City, Metro Manila. It is the second [[SM Supermall]] in Quezon City. It has a land area of 200,000 mÂ², a total gross floor area of approximately 182,000 mÂ² and a total area of 220,000 mÂ², making it the 6th largest shopping mall of SM in the Philippines after [[SM City North EDSA]], [[SM Megamall]], [[SM City Cebu]] and [[SM Southmall]] in terms of total floor area.

==Physical details==
SM City Fairview is a part of the SM malls triplets designed by Palafox and Associates --- a concept that was employed by SM at the height of Asian Financial Crisis, of building 3 shopping malls in different areas under one design template. Thus, the mall's exterior facade and interior has similarities to [[SM City Bacoor]] and [[SM City Iloilo]]. The mall was opened in October 1997 and underwent expansions in 2004 and 2009. The mall consists of a rectangle-shaped building and an outdoor parking. The mall features anchors like SM Department Store, The SM Supermarket, SM Hypermarket and SM Cinemas. It also features other anchors like National Bookstore, Watsons Personal Care Store, Our Home, Surplus Shop, SM Appliance Center and ACE Builders Center. Subsequent annex constructions and renovations were designed by Point Design and JRP Design Inc (Annex Two). SM City Fairview offers free Wi-Fi connectivity within its premises. SM City Fairview also has 4 major tenant zones. The SM Food Court on the Lower Ground Floor of the Main Building, SM Cyberzone at the Third Level of Main Building and the Health and Wellness Zones. The first Health and Wellness zone is located on the Lower Ground Floor of The New Annex. The second Health and Wellness Zone is located at the Second Floor of the Main Building and was launched on July 16, 2010 after the opening of the Cyberzone.
