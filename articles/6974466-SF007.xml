The '''free-software community''' is an informal term that refers to the users and developers of [[free software]] as well as supporters of the [[free-software movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Some examples showing that, and how, &quot;free-software community&quot; is used:

==Disagreements==
Some{{Which?|date=April 2011}} arguments take on the fervor of &quot;religious wars&quot;, such as the technical disputes from the 80s and early 90s over [[editor wars|which text editor is better]], [[Emacs]] or Vi/[[Vim (text editor)|Vim]], or even what ''version'' of a text editor is superior, [[GNU Emacs]] vs [[XEmacs]].

Other conflicts exist over naming.  These can occur because of differing opinions on historical accuracy{{Lopsided|date=April 2011}}, philosophical background or credit, such as the [[alternative terms for free software]] and the [[GNU/Linux naming controversy]].  And they can be caused by a conflict of business models and the use of trademarks, as is the case for the [[Naming conflict between Debian and Mozilla]].

==Companies entering the community==

With the advent of free software such as [[Linux]], [[Apache HTTP Server]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], and [[OpenOffice.org]], many companies such as IBM, Apple, Dell, HP, Google, Sun, Oracle and others too numerous to list, have begun interacting with the free-software community.  Difficulties include the choice of [[free software licences|free-software licences]], and the selection of what software will be released as free software.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

An example of a relatively successful{{Peacock term|date=April 2011}} entry to the free-software community is [[Sun Microsystems]]' July 19, 2000 release of the [[Star Office]] source code under the [[GNU Lesser General Public License]] and the successive development of [[OpenOffice.org]] on this foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.openoffice.org/FAQs/faq-overview.html OpenOffice.org FAQ]&lt;/ref&gt; This move was warmly{{Peacock term|date=April 2011}} received by the community since it did not have a mature office suite at the time.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Sun's use of the community's preferred licence was also welcome{{Peacock term|date=April 2011}}, because it allowed [[source code]] to be shared with other projects.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

An example of a more difficult{{Peacock term|date=April 2011}} entry was that of [[Real Networks]].  Real Networks wrote their own licence, and released only parts of their software suite.  Most notably{{Peacock term|date=April 2011}}, the [[codec]]âthe software needed to view [[Real Video]] filesâwas not released.
