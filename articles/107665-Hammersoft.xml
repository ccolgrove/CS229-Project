'''Palmdale''' is a [[city]] located in the center of northern [[Los Angeles County, California]], United States.

Palmdale was the first community within the [[Antelope Valley]] to incorporate as a city on August 24, 1962; 47 years later, voters approved creating a charter city in November, 2009. Palmdale is separated from [[Los Angeles]] by the [[San Gabriel Mountains|San Gabriel Mountain]] range. Palmdale's population was 152,750 at the 2010 census, up from 116,670 as of the 2000 census. Palmdale is the [[List of largest California cities by population|32nd most populous city in California]] and ranks [[List of United States cities by population|158th nationally]]. According to the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance report&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aveconomy.org/files/2010_rtr_Low_Res.pdf Greater Antelope Valley Economic Alliance]&lt;/ref&gt; of 2009 the ''Palmdale / [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]], CA Urbanized Area'' (a US Census Bureau defined term) has a population of 483,998.

==Palmdale today==
Over the last 25 years this city has consistently been ranked in the top 25 fastest growing cities in the United States (based on percentage change). As of the 2010 census, the population was 152,750, [[List of cities in California (by population)|sixth largest]], and fastest growing city in [[Los Angeles County]]. With {{convert|106|mi2|km2|0|sp=us}} of land in its incorporated boundaries, the city is in the top 100 largest cities in the United States in geographic area. Palmdale is also one of the largest cities in the United States that is not currently served by either an [[Interstate Highway System|Interstate]] Freeway or a [[U.S. Highway]]. [[Sierra Highway]] was at one time labeled as [[U.S. Highway 6]] until the State of [[California]] truncated it at [[Bishop, California|Bishop]]. 

[[File:Palmdale snow w.jpg|thumb|right|Looking south from the hills near Tierra Subida Avenue, late January snow can be seen at the higher elevations.]]
The city is known as a family-oriented community with a high quality of life. [[Palmdale Regional Medical Center]], a first class medical facility opened in 2010, includes an emergency department, a helipad, medical office towers, and a senior housing complex. A new multimodal transportation center, serving local and commuter bus and train services, opened in 2005. A voter-initiated and approved tax has funded major park and recreation expansions, including the Palmdale Amphitheater (capacity 10,000), two new pools, other recreation buildings, satellite library and Dry Town Water Park. Downtown revitalization includes hundreds of new senior housing units, a new senior center, and expanded open space. A new {{convert|48000|sqft|m2|-2|abbr=on}}. Sheriff station opened in July 2006, the largest in Los Angeles County. Two additional fire stations have been built, one on the east side and one on the west side.

While Palmdale is still a part of Los Angeles County, the urbanized centers of Palmdale and Los Angeles are separated by the San Gabriel mountain range, which is about {{convert|40|mi|km}} wide. This range forms the southern edge of the Antelope Valley portion of the [[Mojave Desert]]. Palmdale is the second largest city in the Antelope Valley, and the fifth largest city overall in the Mojave Desert by population, outstripped only by [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], [[Henderson, Nevada|Henderson]], [[North Las Vegas, Nevada|North Las Vegas]] and [[Lancaster, California]].

==History==
[[File:Palmdale CA and Antelope Valley and Environs Landsat7.jpg|thumb|left|This satellite image, looking toward the west, shows the Palmdale / Antelope Valley area in relation to Los Angeles with the San Gabriel Mountains separating them.]]
''Palmenthal'', the first European settlement within the limits of Palmdale, was established as a [[village]] on April 20, 1886 by westward Lutheran&lt;ref name=Durham&gt;{{cite book|last=Durham|first=David L.|title=California's Geographic Names - A Gazetteer of Historic and Modern Names of the State|year=1998|pages=1320|isbn=9781884995149|publisher=Quill Driver Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; travelers from the American [[Midwest]], mostly of German and [[Switzerland|Swiss]] descent. According to area [[folklore]], the travelers had been told they would know they were close to the [[ocean]] when they saw [[Arecaceae|palm trees]].  Never actually having seen palm trees before, they mistook the local [[Yucca brevifolia|Joshua tree]]s for palms and so named their settlement after them. (''Palmenthal'' is German for ''Palms Valley.'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://get.palmdalelibrary.org/?menu=1&amp;section=1&amp;page=6 Palmdale City Library]&lt;/ref&gt; According to David L. Durham Joshua trees were sometimes called yucca palms at the time, which was the reason for the name.&lt;ref name=Durham/&gt; The [[village]] was officially established upon the arrival of a [[post office]] on June 17, 1888.

By the 1890s (soon after the last of the indigenous [[antelope]]s, which the valley was named after, had died) [[farming]] families continued to [[human migration|migrate]] to Palmenthal and nearby ''Harold'' to grow [[grain]] and [[fruit]]. However, most of these [[settler]]s were unfamiliar with [[farming]] in a [[desert]] climate, so when the [[drought]] years occurred, most abandoned their [[Human settlement|settlement]]. By 1899, only one family was left in the original village. The rest of the settlers, including the post office, moved closer to the ''[[Southern Pacific Railroad|Southern Pacific]]'' [[railroad]] tracks. This new community was renamed Palmdale and was located where the present day [[civic center]] is. A [[railroad station]] was built along the tracks there. This railroad was operated by [[Southern Pacific]] and traveled between [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. There was also the ''[[Wells Fargo]]'' stagecoach line that ran between San Francisco and [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] that stopped there as well.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles County Public Library&quot;&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q8 Los Angeles County Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The only remaining pieces of evidence of the original settlements of Palmenthal and Harold are the old [[Palmdale Pioneer cemetery]] located on the northeast corner of Avenue S and 20th Street East, recently acquired and restored by the city as part of a future historical park, and the old [[school]]house now relocated to ''McAdam Park''.

As the population of Palmdale began to increase after relocation, water became scarce, until November 5, 1913 when the [[California Aqueduct|California â Los Angeles Aqueduct]] system was completed finally by William Mulholland, bringing water from the Owens Valley into Los Angeles County. During this period, crops of [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s and [[alfalfa]] became plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q9 Los Angeles County Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q10 Los Angeles County Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1915, Palmdaleâs first newspaper, the ''Palmdale Post'', was published. Today it is called the [[Antelope Valley Press]].

In 1921, the first major link between Palmdale and Los Angeles was completed, Mint Canyon/Lancaster Road, later designated [[U.S. Route 6 (California)|U.S. Route 6]]. Completion of this road caused the local agricultural industry to flourish and was the first major step towards defining the metropolis that exists today. Presently this road is known as [[Sierra Highway]].&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;[Book; Palmdale: How It All Began. Â© City of Palmdale, 1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the Littlerock Dam and the Harold Reservoir, present day [[Lake Palmdale]], were constructed to assist the agricultural industry and have enough water to serve the growing communities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Lake Palmdale-kmf.JPG|thumb|right|Picture of Lake Palmdale with the California Aqueduct in the foreground.]]

Agriculture continued to be the foremost industry for Palmdale and its northern neighbor [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] until the outbreak of [[World War II]]. In 1933, the United States government established [[Muroc Air Base]] (from an original founder name, Effie Corum, spelled backwards) six miles (10&amp;nbsp;km) north of Lancaster in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]], now known as [[Edwards Air Force Base]]. They also bought Palmdale Airport in 1952 and established an aerospace development and testing facility called [[Plant 42|United States Air Force Plant 42]]. One year later, in 1953, [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] established a facility at the airport. After this point in time, the aerospace industry took over as the primary local source of employment, where it has remained ever since. Today the city is even referred to as the âAerospace Capital of Americaâ because of its rich heritage in being the home of many of the aircraft used in the United States [[military]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles County Public Library&quot;/&gt;

In 1957, Palmdaleâs first high school, [[Palmdale High School]], was established, making it easier for youths to not have to travel to [[Antelope Valley High School]] in nearby Lancaster.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phsfalcons.org/information/information.htm Palmdale High School]&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1962, the township of Palmdale officially became the ''[[city]]'' of Palmdale with the incorporation of {{convert|2|mi2|km2|0|sp=us}} of land around the present day civic center.&lt;ref name=&quot;Los Angeles County Public Library&quot;/&gt;

In 1964, the [[Antelope Valley Freeway]], or State Highway 14, was completed as a link between Palmdale and Los Angeles. The [[freeway]] at this time ran all the way to present day Technology Drive. It was at this time that talk about the future ''Palmdale Intercontinental Airport'' was seen as the way of the future. By 1965 the new city had annexed an additional {{convert|20|sqmi|km2}} of land and industry was thriving.  Talk of the future commercial [[airport]] had many investors buying up large quantities of land.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Palmdale Freeway.jpg|thumb|left|Antelope Valley Freeway southbound in Downtown Palmdale with unusually sparse traffic.]]In 1970, the city of Los Angeles went forward with buying {{convert|17,750|acre|km2}} of land east of the city for its proposed intercontinental commercial airport. However, the United States Air Force desired to put a hold on the construction of this new facility until the existing airport reached its commercial capacity. So under a joint use agreement with the military, the Los Angeles Department of Airports, now called [[Los Angeles World Airports]], built a 9,000 square foot (800 mÂ²) terminal on leased land that opened in 1971, creating present day [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]] which the City of Palmdale has taken control of in an effort to establish reliable air service in the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lawa.org/pmd/pmdHistory.cfm Palmdale Regional Airport â History]&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1974, the Antelope Valley Freeway construction ended at the southern border of [[Mojave, California|Mojave]] in Kern County. In 1977, Palmdale built its first municipal building, the Palmdale City Library. This was the same year that its northern neighbor Lancaster incorporated itself into a city. Since the 1920s, Lancaster had been the much larger and principal community of the [[Antelope Valley]], as well as the rest of California's [[Mojave Desert]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colapublib.org/history/antelopevalley/faq.html#q7 Los Angeles County Public Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Central Palmdale.jpg|thumb|right|Central Palmdale looking north along 10th Street West toward Rancho Vista Blvd.]]The 1980s and 1990s were the decades that really started to define the two Antelope Valley cities. [[Affordable housing]] in the area caused a dramatic spike in the [[population]]. The city became a bedroom community for those employed in Los Angeles. Palmdale's population continued to approach Lancaster's. Throughout the eighties and even the nineties, Palmdale was the fastest growing city in California and second fastest growing city in the nation. In 1980, Palmdale's population was 12,227.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

By 1990, it had soared to 68,842. During that same year the [[Antelope Valley Mall]] opened at Avenue P (present day Rancho Vista Blvd.) and 10th Street West, presently the busiest intersection in the entire Mojave Desert. In 1991, the Palmdale Auto Center complex opened. Throughout the 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century, central Palmdale has become the retail and commercial center of the [[High Desert (California)|California High Desert]]. In 2000, the city's population was 116,670. In 2002, Palmdale's population finally eclipsed its northern neighbor Lancaster. With over 150,000 residents today, the City Planning Commission continues to attempt a form of managed growth in the early part of 21st century.  The recent [[subprime mortgage crisis]] has affected the city with a tremendous number of foreclosures, much like other cities in California.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pr.com/press-release/79870 pr.com]&lt;/ref&gt; However, even with the high number of foreclosures, the city remains the fastest growing city in [[Los Angeles County, California|Los Angeles County]], and the fastest growing ''large'' city in the State of [[California]].&lt;ref name=&quot;dof.ca.gov&quot;&gt;[http://www.dof.ca.gov/research/demographic/reports/estimates/e-1/2008-09/documents/E-1%202009%20Internet%20Version.xls/ California Department of Finance 2010 Population Estimate]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
===Kindergarten â Grade 12 schools===
Palmdale has three separate elementary school districts and one high school district:

*The [[Palmdale School District]] is one of the largest elementary school districts in the nation consisting of 29 schools with about 28,000 students. This school district covers the majority of the cityâs Kindergarten through 8th grade students.  One of the unique parts of this school district was its practice of naming schools after desert flora and fauna.  For instance, there are Tumbleweed, Juniper, and Sage schools.

*The [[Westside Union School District]] covers the schools on the far west-side of Palmdale and its western suburbs. This school district has over 8,250 students and 11 schools for K-8 education.

*The [[Keppel Union School District]] covers the schools on the far east-side of Palmdale and its eastern suburbs. This school district has 6 schools and nearly 3,000 students for K-8 education.

*The [[Antelope Valley Union High School District]] covers nearly all of the 9-12th grade education for the entire metropolitan area, with the exception of private high schools. It has 12 schools with over 25,000 students.

===Colleges and universities===
*The [[Antelope Valley Community College District]] currently has a satellite campus in Palmdale with a student population of about 470. This temporary campus was set up until a permanent community college campus could be established within the city, which is being planned for the southside of the city on 25th Street East, south of Avenue S.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailynews.com/news/ci_9100777?source=rss Daily News â Antelope Valley]&lt;/ref&gt; The district has one full service campus in nearby [[Lancaster, California|Lancaster]] with about 14,000 students.
*The [[California State University]] system also has a satellite campus from its [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]] facility in nearby Lancaster at the Antelope Valley College main campus.
* [[DeVry University]] has a campus in Palmdale that includes its [[Keller Graduate School of Management]].
* [[Chapman University]] has a satellite campus in Palmdale.
* [[University of La Verne]] has a satellite campus in Palmdale.
* [[University of Phoenix]] has a satellite campus in nearby Lancaster.
* The [[AERO Institute]] at the Palmdale Institute of Technology is a facility in Palmdale at the Civic Center. It is operated by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA), and the City of Palmdale, and distance learning through a number of universities is available including [[Purdue]], [[University of Southern California|USC]], [[University of San Diego]], [[Pepperdine University]], [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], [[Caltech]] and [[Cal Poly Pomona]]. This specialized school offers [[graduate school|graduate]] and [[undergraduate]] education in aerospace science, engineering, and technical skills.

==Law and government==
===Local government===
Palmdale is a Charter City governed under the [[Local Government|council]] / [[City manager|manager]] form of local [[government]]. The [[mayor]] is elected every two years for a two-year term. Also every two years, two of the four [[councillors|council members]] are elected to serve four-year terms. Palmdale does not have term limits for council and mayor. The current mayor, James C. Ledford, is serving his tenth term in office. The City Council appoints the City Manager and City Attorney.

The city also has an appointed Planning Commission divided into four separate districts. The Planning Commission was organized to help with the planning, zoning, and development of various city areas in different districts and to give the residents of those particular districts a greater voice in local land use decisions. There is also an appointed  Board of Library Trustees, and Youth Council.

On November 3, 2009, local residents voted in favor of a measure to change Palmdale's general law city status to that of a [[Charter City]]. This allowed Palmdale to draft a city charter and constitution, enabling it to make more decisions at the local level without interference or rules from the [[California|state]] government.

===Municipal services===
The city provides a number of municipal services, including a Planning Department, Economic Development Department and Redevelopment Agency, Building and Safety Department, Public Works Department, Parks and Recreation Department, and Library Department. The city also operates the Palmdale Transportation Center which serves as the hub for public transit services including [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] trains, [[Antelope Valley Transit Authority]], [[Amtrak California]]'s [[Thruway Motorcoach]] and [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound]]. Palmdale was selected as a stop for the California High Speed Rail System, currently undergoing environmental review, that will link Northern and Southern California. City officials have formed the Palmdale Airport Authority, as they pursue regional air service from a joint use facility at USAF Plant 42.

Recreation and cultural services include the Palmdale City Library,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Palmdale City Library|url=http://www.cityofpalmdale.org/library/|work=City of Palmdale}}&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.cityofpalmdale.org/departments/parks/senior_center.html Legacy Commons], Larry Chimbole Cultural Center, [http://www.cityofpalmdale.org/departments/playhouse/ Palmdale Playhouse and Art Gallery],  [[Dry Town Water Park]], [http://www.cityofpalmdale.org/departments/parks/amphitheater.html Palmdale Amphitheater], Best of the West Softball Complex, [[Hammack Activity Center]], [[Dry Town Water Park|Palmdale Oasis Park Recreation Center]], Marie Kerr Park Recreation Center, Joe Davies Heritage Airpark at Palmdale Plant 42, and four swimming pools.

===Public safety===
The city is policed by the [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] under a formal contract with the [[Los Angeles County, California|County of Los Angeles]] and has its municipal judicial system intertwined with the [[Superior Courts of California|Los Angeles County Superior Court]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

The [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]] (LASD) operates the Palmdale Station in Palmdale.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.lasd.org/stations/for1/palmdale/index.html Palmdale Station].&quot; [[Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department]]. Retrieved on January 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Palmdale has the largest Sheriff's Station in Los Angeles County. Palmdale's innovative Partners Against Crime (PAC) Program, a cooperative effort between law enforcement, landlords and community members, has successfully focused on quality of life issues and crime suppression, reducing the crime rate annually. Recently, the Partners for a Better Palmdale program was initiated by the City Council, to further engage residents, schools, community groups and law enforcement in improving community quality of life. The city pioneered the use of municipal Community Service Officers for low level incidents to free up Deputies for higher priority matters, and employ high-tech tools, such as Automated License Plate Recognition Systems on patrol cars, to increase officer productivity.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

[[File:Palmdale Hospital.jpg|thumb|Palmdale Regional Medical Center handles the city's medical services.]]

The city is served by the [[Los Angeles County Fire Department]] for its fire and paramedic services through the Consolidated Fire Protection District. Palmdale downtown Station #37 is one of the busiest fire stations in the United States.  Two new fire stations went into service in late 2008 on the east and west sides of Palmdale.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

===Public utilities===
Utility services within the city are provided by several public and private agencies.

Federally, Palmdale is located in [[California's 25th congressional district]], which has a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index|Cook PVI]] of R +7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Will Gerrymandered Districts Stem the Wave of Voter Unrest? | publisher = Campaign Legal Center Blog | url=http://www.clcblog.org/blog_item-85.html | accessdate = 2008-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is represented by Republican [[Howard McKeon|Buck McKeon]].

==Transportation==
According to the latest U.S. Census report released in Sept. 2009, Palmdale has the longest average commute time in the United States at 41.5 minutes. This commute time exceeds that of even New York City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090922/ap_on_go_ot/us_census_recession_s_impact_15]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Area highways===
The [[Antelope Valley Freeway]] (SR 14) is the major North-South highway connecting Palmdale to Los Angeles and Mojave.

[[California State Route 138|State Route 138]] (SR 138) is the major east-west highway connecting Palmdale to the [[Inland Empire, California|Inland Empire]] and [[Frazier Park, California|Frazier Park]].

[[California State Route 18|State Route 18]] (SR 18) heads eastward out of the Antelope Valley connecting it to [[Victorville, California|Victorville]] and via [[Interstate 15 (California)|I-15]] the [[Barstow, California|Barstow]] area. This road is commonly used as a route to [[Las Vegas, Nevada]].

'''[[Unconstructed state highways in California|Future Highways]]:'''

Cash-strapped [[Caltrans]] only recently began upgrades to SR 138 (nicknamed &quot;Blood Alley&quot;). CalTrans has had plans on the table for several years for SR 138 and SR 18 to create an east/west freeway between Palmdale and I-15. Due to State funding constraints, this expressway will probably not be completed until near 2020 as the planning, design and construction process can take as many as 10â15 years. There has been discussion of creating a the High Desert Corridor tollway in its place. There is also a long-lost plan to continue the freeway from Palmdale along the southern foothills of the Antelope Valley to I-5 in Gorman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vvdailypress.com/news/sought-14599-corridor-victorville.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[State Route 48 (California)|State Route 48]] (SR 48) is a planned east / west freeway connecting from the Antelope Valley Freeway (SR 14) at Avenue D, the current segment terminus for the western SR 138 branch, to [[Interstate 5 (California)|Interstate 5]] in [[Gorman, California|Gorman]]. This freeway is planned to come after SR 138 has its new southern realignment through Palmdale completed, and will follow the existing SR 138 right of way.

[[State Route 122 (California)|State Route 122]] (SR 122) is a planned north / south freeway from eastern Palmdale, passing east of [[Edwards Air Force Base]] to SR 58 near [[California City, California|California City]].

[[State Route 249 (California)|State Route 249]] (SR 249) is a planned north / south freeway from southern Palmdale to [[Interstate 210 (California)|I-210]] in [[La Canada Flintridge, California|La Canada Flintridge]], near [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].

===Public transportation===
[[File:Palmdale Transportation Center.jpg|thumb|left|The Palmdale Transportation Center serves at the regional transit hub for the Antelope Valley.]]The [[Palmdale Transportation Center]], completed in March 2005, is the central mass transit center for the [[Antelope Valley]]. It serves as the transit hub for the [[Antelope Valley Transit Authority]], the city's public bus system, as well as an [[Amtrak]], [[Greyhound Lines|Greyhound Bus]], and commuter rail [[Metrolink (Southern California)|Metrolink]] station. The station is also designated a stop on the proposed [[California High Speed Rail System]] and the proposed [[Orangeline Maglev]] rail from [[Irvine, California|Irvine]].

===Airport===
The [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]]/[[Plant 42|Air Force Plant 42]] (PMD) has two runways, each over {{convert|2.25|mi|km}} in length, although there is currently no commercial airline service at the airport. PMD's commercial terminal is owned and operated by [[Los Angeles World Airports]] (LAWA), a municipal department of the City of [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], on leased land from the U.S. Air Force. Airline service has been sporadic since commercial flights were first offered in 1971. Most recently, [[United Express]]/[[SkyWest Airlines]] flew between PMD and [[San Francisco International Airport|San Francisco]] from June 7, 2007, to December 6, 2008. The city of Palmdale formed the Palmdale Airport Authority to move forward to control the facilities and the lease with the USAF, to better develop regional air service in the [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]].

[[File:Palmdale Airport Terminal.jpg|thumb|right|LA/Palmdale Regional Airport Terminal]] LAWA also owns {{convert|17500|acre|km2|0}} of land adjacent to the existing airport. The land was acquired between 1970 and 1983 to be developed into &quot;Palmdale Intercontinental Airport&quot;, intended to surpass the air traffic of [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]]. The land remains undeveloped. LAWA is currently developing a Master Plan for Palmdale that will guide airport land use and development decisions through 2030.

The [[FAA]]'s [[Los Angeles Air Route Traffic Control Center]] is located adjacent to the airport.

NASA has consolidated its research, environmental and training aircraft, support services and facilities at the Dryden Air Operations Facility in Palmdale. From the over-sized runway and the massive hangar located at Air Force Plant 42 Site 9, NASA conducts worldwide environmental research with its ER-1 (a U-2 variant) and cutting edge deep space imaging with the 747-based SOPHIA infrared telescope.

===Cycling===
Palmdale is developing a network of  bike lanes and bike paths throughout its boundaries. The backbone of the system is a new, grade separated Class A bike path on Avenue S, between 5th Street East and 25th St East, that was included as part of a $20 million highway improvement project, and a similar path on Sierra Highway, that runs from Technology Drive (Avenue P-8) north to meet with the Lancaster segment up to Avenue J. There are also bike lanes on some local streets, leading to parks and schools, as well.

Cycling in certain areas of Palmdale carries an increased risk due to higher speed limits for vehicles and also due to the presence of large vehicles.

===Street system===
The street system in the Antelope Valley is set out in a grid. Unless otherwise named or curved around due to terrain, east-west roads are called avenues and north-south roads are called streets. The city is essentially on a perfect grid, and the traffic signals are coordinated by a central processing facility at the Civic Center.

'''East-west avenues''' are lettered mile-by-mile from north to south, starting with Avenue A on the Los Angeles-Kern County line. One mile south of Avenue A is Avenue B, and so on. Smaller roads between major avenues carry suffixes &quot;-1&quot; (nearest to the lettered avenue) through &quot;-15&quot; (nearest to the next lettered avenue). Some &quot;-8&quot; avenues can be major thoroughfares, for example, Avenue R-8 is halfway between Avenue R and Avenue S.

'''North-south streets''' are numbered with an &quot;east&quot; or &quot;west&quot; suffix with respect to their distances from Division Street. The number increases by 10 for each mile, so a mile east and west of Division Street lie &quot;10th Street East&quot; and &quot;10th Street West&quot; respectively. Some streets like 5th or 15th can also be major thoroughfares.

'''House addresses''' on east-west &quot;avenues&quot; are numbered according to the &quot;streets&quot;. For example, &quot;2001 East Palmdale Boulevard&quot; is just east of 20th Street East, and &quot;6066 West Avenue M-2&quot; is just west of 60th Street West on Avenue M-2, which is 2/16 of a mile south of Avenue M.

On north-south streets, numbers are counted from Downtown Los Angeles (thus increase from south to north), and while in the Antelope Valley, the difference is 800 per mile. For example, Palmdale Boulevard (geographically &quot;Avenue Q-8&quot;) is 38400, Avenue Q is 38800, Avenue P is 39600, and so on. &quot;37200 25th Street East&quot; would be at the corner of Avenue S.

In accordance with Los Angeles County standards, odd numbers are on west and north sides of the road, and even numbers are on east and south sides of the road.

Avenue M is the general border of the connected population between Palmdale and Lancaster. Avenue L is actually the longer border between the two cities, east of Challenger Way, but is not as heavily populated. Avenue M has recently been named Columbia Way out of respect for the astronauts onboard the [[Space Shuttle Columbia]] that disintegrated on re-entry in 2003. 10th Street East north of Columbia Way was renamed Challenger Way in 1987, in honor of those lost in the [[Challenger Disaster]]. (All of the shuttles were built in Palmdale.)

==Climate==
Palmdale is located in the [[High Desert (California)|High Desert]], where the summers are very hot and dry, and winters are cool and windy. Palmdale has over 300 days of sunshine per year. The same weather pattern that brings the marine layer stratus and afternoon sea breeze to the Los Angeles Basin brings gusty winds to Palmdale, especially near the foothills on the south side. Except during Santa Ana (northeast) wind events (usually fall and winter), gusty southwest winds blow over Palmdale almost every afternoon and evening all year round. The wind is so reliable that [[wind turbine]]s are used to generate [[electricity]].

'''Winter''' &amp;ndash; Relatively chilly, wet and windy. Temperatures have gone into the single-digits at times. The [[wind chill factor]] can be below zero. This is Palmdale's rainy season and is prone to flash flooding during this time. On occasion, it will snow, sometimes with several inches of accumulation. Average day time highs are in the upper 50s to low 60s while being in the low to mid 30s overnight.

'''Spring''' &amp;ndash; Moderate temperatures. Still occasionally wet. Very windy. Transitional period from winter to summer temperatures is very short. Average daytime highs are in the upper 70s to low 80s while being in the upper 40s to low 50s overnight.

'''Summer''' &amp;ndash; Very hot, dry heat with little or no precipitation. Temperatures frequently soar into triple-digits. However, the high desert where Palmdale is located allows for the temperatures to cool down somewhat at night, unlike the low desert cities of [[Palm Springs, California|Palm Springs]] and [[Blythe, California|Blythe]]. Average day time highs are in the upper 90s while dropping into the mid to upper 70s after midnight.  Local electrical bills spike during this period with air-conditioning units running day and night, until early October. Despite the hot temperature, it is very common to experience &quot;summer storms&quot; in which temperatures are consistent but there is heavy rain and thunderstorms.

'''Fall''' &amp;ndash; Moderate temperatures with little or no precipitation. Transitional period from summer to winter temperatures is very short. As a result, the [[deciduous tree]]s in Palmdale will lose their [[leaf|leaves]] very rapidly, seemingly overnight, with a short color change. Average day time highs are in the upper 70s and low 80s while dropping into the mid 40s to mid 50s overnight.

==Geography==
Downtown Palmdale is located at {{Coord|34|34|46|N|118|07|00|W|type:city_region:US-CA}},{{GR|1}} at an elevation of {{convert|2655|ft|m|0}} above sea level.

According to the [[United States Census Bureau]] the city has a total area of {{convert|106.2|sqmi|km2}}, of which, {{convert|106.0|sqmi|km2}} of it is land and {{convert|0.3|sqmi|km2}} of it is water (including man-made Lake Palmdale, the most visible and scenic part of the municipal water supply system) .  The total area is 0.24% water.

The city lies in close proximity to the [[San Andreas Fault]], making it, like many other regions of California, prone to strong earthquakes.  This faultline cuts across the [[Antelope Valley Freeway]] just north of the Avenue S off-ramp; running westward along the old Butterfield Stage Line (now Elizabeth Lake Road) into Leona Valley.

==Economy==
The most important industry for Palmdale is the [[aerospace]] industry. However in recent times, other [[manufacturing]] companies have relocated to Palmdale seeking more affordable land, proximity to [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport|Palmdale Airport]], and special tax breaks.

The special tax breaks granted for companies that relocate to Palmdale is due to the city having the '''Antelope Valley [[Enterprise Zone]]''' and the '''Palmdale Federal [[Foreign Trade Zone]]'''. These are special zoning areas within the city that are given various state and federal tax breaks and municipal grant incentives to relocate their business there. These zones were put in effect to help Palmdale and nearby Lancaster draw more jobs to the area so that they would be less dependent on the [[Los Angeles Basin]] area for employment, thus relieving pollution and traffic congestion and stabilizing the local economy on several industries. The aerospace industry is known for having âfeast or famineâ seasons.

Palmdale refers to itself with the nickname the &quot;[[aerospace]] capital of the United States&quot;, and has been the site of research, development, final assembly, flight testing and/or servicing/modifications  of the [[Space Shuttle]], [[X-15]], [[B-2 Spirit]], [[F-117 Nighthawk]], [[F-35 Lightning II]], [[SR-71 Blackbird]], [[Lockheed L-1011|Lockheed L-1011 Tristar]], and many other aircraft that have been used in the [[United States Air Force]], [[NASA]] and air forces and airlines around the world.   [[USAF Plant 42]], where the aforementioned aerospace projects occurred / occur is home to major operations of the following aerospace companies:  [[Boeing]], [[Lockheed Martin]] and its famed [[Skunk Works]], and [[Northrop Grumman]].  The Los Angeles World Airports owns the former Boeing hangar (formerly North American Rockwell) at Plant 42 near [[LA/Palmdale Regional Airport]] which is one of the largest buildings in the world. The hangar was used for the set of the 2004 film ''[[The Terminal]]'', which featured an enormous replica of a [[John F. Kennedy International Airport|JFK International Airport]] terminal. [[NASA]]'s [[Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy|SOFIA]] program relocated its operation to this hangar at Site 9 from [[Edwards Air Force Base]].

A number of world class corporations and manufacturing firms have made Palmdale home, helping to diversify the local economy. Delta Scientific, a world leader in high strength vehicle barrier systems, supplying protection for many federal, state and local buildings, and a prime supplier to the military and US State Department for embassies and other installations worldwide, and US Pole, a major manufacturer of street lighting poles, are major anchor tenants in the Fairway Business Park. The Palmdale Trade and Commerce Center is home to many other major manufacturing, industrial, corporate offices and other employers, as well as home to the Palmdale Auto Mall. A number of medical and related support offices are coming on-line to meet the needs of the new Palmdale Regional Medical Center. On July 8, 2009 Quallion LLC, which manufactures lithium ion cells and battery packs, announced plans to build a battery manufacturing plant in Palmdale if it won a government grant being offered by the U.S. Department of Energy.

The Antelope Valley Mall is the preeminent retail shopping destination in the region, with a wide variety of dining choices on its restaurant row.

Beginning in the 1960s, Palmdale was home to [[Don Babb]]'s The Model A Ford Company, which became [[Classic Manufacturing and Supply]], builder of exact reproduction and custom steel bodies and parts for [[hot rod]]s and [[custom car|custom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;''Street Rodder'', 7/94, pp.132-40.&lt;/ref&gt;
