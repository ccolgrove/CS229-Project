The '''Portugal national under-23 football team''' (also known as '''Portugal Olympic football team''') represents [[Portugal]] in international [[association football|football]] competitions (final stage and qualifiers) in [[Olympic Games]], as well as in underâ23 football tournaments. The selection is limited to players under the age of 23, except three over-age players. The team is controlled by the [[Portuguese Football Federation]] (FPF). In three participations, Portugal's highest place was fourth, in 1996. This team also competed in the now-defunct Underâ23 European Championship. The first time Portugal participated in the Olympic Football Tournament, they fielded main team players since the [[International Olympic Committee]] rules allowed to do so back then and in the 1980s, the team was composed of semi-professional players. The team currently qualifies in accordance to their [[Portugal national under-21 football team|underâ21 team]] position in the [[UEFA European Under-21 Football Championship|UEFA Underâ21 Championship]]. The results bellow comprise both the under-23 team as well as the Olympic team.

==History==
=== 1928 Summer Olympics in Amsterdam ===
Portugal was invited to enter the [[Football at the 1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Summer Olympics Football Tournament]], which was, at that time, contested by the best national &quot;A&quot; teams in the world and, therefore, considered to be the best international footballing tournament until the [[FIFA World Cup]] started, two years later, in 1930.

The Portuguese team was drawn in the preliminary round against [[Chile national football team|Chile]] for a place in the first round. After falling 2â0 behind, Portugal scored four goals, winning the game 4â2 in what was their first win away from home soil. After their fantastic win against Chile, they faced off [[Yugoslavia national football team|Yugoslavia]] and won 2â1 thanks to a late goal in the 90th minute.

[[Egypt national football team|Egypt]] was the team that followed in the quarter-finals. Here the Portuguese adventure ended after a 2â1 defeat. In the following games, the Egyptians lost against [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]] 6â0 in the semi-final and [[Italy national football team|Italy]] 11â3 for the bronze medal match, which bittered the players. This was the first tournament the Portuguese team had ever competed.

===1972 European Uâ23 qualifiers===
Portugal was drawn to Group Five, along with [[Denmark national football team|Denmark]], to play in a two-legged Play-off. After a 1â1 tie in [[Lisbon]], the Portuguese lost the return leg in [[Aalborg]] 2â1, ending with a 3â2 aggregate result.

===1974 European Uâ23 qualifiers===
For the next tournament, Portugal was put in Group Six with [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]]. The playoff result was 2â1 (0â0 in the first leg in [[Porto]] and 2â1 in [[Pleven]]) for the Bulgarians.

===1976 European Uâ23 qualifiers===
With [[England national football team|England]] and [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]] in Group One, Portugal ended second with three points (four less than England) coming from a win and a draw against the central Europeans (2â0 in [[Faro, Portugal|Faro]] and 1â1 in [[Teplice]]). Both games against the English were loses (3â2 in Lisbon and 2â0 in [[London]]).

===1984 Summer Olympics qualifiers===
Portugal was to play in Subgroup A of Group Four with [[Israel national football team|Israel]] and [[West Germany Olympic football team|West Germany]] for a place in the second qualifying round. They finished second behind the Germans (six points) with four points. After an initial win (3â1 in Lisbon), they lost in [[OsnabrÃ¼ck]] 3â0, followed by a 1â0 defeat in [[Tel Aviv]] and a 2â1 win against the Israelis in Lisbon. The team was made up with semi-professional players.

===1988 Summer Olympics qualifiers===
With strong sides to play with ([[East Germany national football team|East Germany]], [[Iceland national football team|Iceland]], Italy, and the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]]) the Portuguese qualification was seen has merely a dream. With wins against Iceland (2â1 in [[Leiria]] and 1â0 in [[ReykjavÃ­k]]), two away defeats (1â0 in [[Lecce]], Italy and 3â0 in [[Aue]], [[East Germany]]) and all other games tied, they ended up in third place with eight points (five behind group winners and qualifiers Italy). Again, this team was composed with semi-professional players.

===1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta===
Portugal participated in the [[Football at the 1996 Summer Olympics|Atlanta Games]] and after a win over [[Tunisia national football team|Tunisia]] (2â0) and 1â1 draws against Argentina and the [[USA men's national soccer team|United States]], they ended in second place in Group A with the same points and goal difference as the first-placed Argentinians (but with lesser goals scored). Then in the quarter-finals, a win over [[France national football team|France]] (2â1) after [[extra-time]] assured them a place in the semi-finals. Once again, they played against Argentina, but this time the South Americans won 2â0. For the bronze medal match, they faced a strong [[Brazil Olympic football team|Brazil]] full of world stars such as [[Bebeto]], [[Roberto Carlos (footballer)|Roberto Carlos]], [[Ronaldo]], [[Rivaldo]], among others. Portugal was heavily defeated by a score of 5â0. This participation remains to this day as their best ever ending with the fourth place.

===2004 Summer Olympics in Athens===
In the [[Football at the 2004 Summer Olympics â Men's tournament|2004 Games]], the Portuguese were seen as major contenders for Olympic gold, but they didn't make it past the group stage. This disappointing performance started with a 4â2 defeat at the hands of [[Iraq national football team|Iraq]]. The second game ended in a 2â1 win over [[Morocco national football team|Morroco]] and in the third game, Portugal were once again defeated 4â2 by an inferior team ([[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]). The team was accused of wanting out of the tournament due to their respective club's pressure.
