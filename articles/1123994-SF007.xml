'''LAN Manager''' was a [[Network operating system|Network Operating System]] (NOS) available from multiple vendors and developed by [[Microsoft]] in cooperation with [[3Com Corporation]].  It was designed to succeed 3Com's [[3+Share]] network server software which ran atop a heavily modified version of [[MS-DOS]].

==Development history==
LAN Manager was based on the [[OS/2]] operating system co-developed by [[IBM]] and Microsoft.  It originally used the [[Server Message Block]] protocol atop either the [[NetBIOS Frames protocol]] (NBF) or a specialized version of the [[Xerox Network Systems]] (XNS) protocol. These legacy protocols had been inherited from previous products such as [[MS-NET]] for [[MS-DOS]], [[Xenix-NET]] for [[Xenix|MS-Xenix]], and the afore-mentioned 3+Share. A version of LAN Manager for Unix-based systems called '''LAN Manager/X''' was also available.

In 1990, Microsoft announced LAN Manager 2.0 with a host of improvements, including support for TCP/IP as a transport protocol. The last version LAN Manager, 2.2, which included an MS-OS/2 1.31 base operating system, remained Microsoft's strategic server system until the release of [[Windows NT 3.1|Windows NT Advanced Server]] in 1993.

Many vendors shipped licensed versions, including:
*[[3Com Corporation]] [[3+Open]]
*[[HP]] LAN Manager/X
*[[IBM]] [[LAN Server]]
*Tapestry Torus

==Security vulnerability==
{{main|LM hash}}
LAN Manager authentication uses a particularly weak method of [[Cryptographic hash function|hashing]] a user's [[password]] known as the [[LM hash]] algorithm. This makes the authentication crackable in a matter of seconds using [[rainbow table]]s or in few hours using [[Brute-force attack|brute force]]. Its use in [[Windows NT]] was replaced by [[NTLM]], which is still vulnerable to rainbow tables, but less vulnerable to brute force attacks.  Both protocols have subsequently been deprecated in favor of [[Kerberos (protocol)|Kerberos]], but remain in use for backward compatibility and inter-operability.
