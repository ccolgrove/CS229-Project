[[File:Prince logo.svg|15px]] is the fourteenth [[studio album]] by American recording artist [[Prince (musician)|Prince]], released October 13, 1992 on [[Paisley Park Records|Paisley Park]] and [[Warner Bros. Records]].&lt;ref name=Discogs&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Prince+%26+The+New+Power+Generation |title=Prince &amp; The New Power Generation Discography |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate={{date|2009-04-15}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its official title being an unpronounceable symbol, which Prince later adopted as his name, the album has been referred to as the '''''Love Symbol Album''''', or simply '''''Symbol'''''.  It is Prince's second album to feature his backing group, [[The New Power Generation]], which received co-billing for the release. The album contains elements of musical styles including [[funk]], [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]], [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], [[jazz]], [[reggae]], and [[synthpop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.discogs.com/Prince-The-New-Power-Generation-Untitled-Symbol/release/1662802 |title=Prince And The New Power Generation* â Untitled (Symbol) |publisher=[[Discogs]] |accessdate={{date|2009-04-16}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The album's first two singles, &quot;[[My Name Is Prince]]&quot; and &quot;[[Sexy MF]]&quot;, achieved modest success on the US pop charts, though both made the top ten in the UK. Conversely, the third single, &quot;[[7 (song)|7]]&quot;, was not as successful as the first two singles in the UK, but was a top ten hit in the US. The album was originally conceived as a &quot;fantasy rock soap opera&quot; with various spoken [[segue]]s throughout.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last =Willman| first = Chris| title = Prince's Latest Fleshed-Out Fantasy| newspaper = [[Los Angeles Times]] | date = {{date|October 11, 1992}} |publisher=Tribune Company |issn=0458-3035 |oclc=3638237 |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61717569.html?dids=61717569:61717569&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Oct+11%2C+1992&amp;author=CHRIS+WILLMAN&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Prince's+Latest+Fleshed-Out+Fantasy+**+PRINCE+%26+THE+N.P.G.+%22(genders+merging+symbol)+%22+Paisley+Park%2FWarner+Bros.&amp;pqatl=google}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a last-minute attempt to add an additional song (Wanna Melt With U which was originally considered to be a b-side), most of the segues had to be cut for album length. The few that remained were somewhat confusing in context. The album debuts [[Mayte Garcia]], who plays a part in the album's storyline and would become Prince's wife in 1996.
 
''[[3 Chains o' Gold]]'', a direct-to-video film produced and directed by Prince, was released in 1994. The film is based on the plotline and songs of the ''Love Symbol Album'' and contained some of the original segues which were planned to be on the album..
