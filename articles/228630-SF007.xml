'''Eudora''' {{IPAc-en|ju:|Ë|d|ÉÉr|É}} is an [[e-mail client]] used on the [[Mac OS|Apple Macintosh]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] [[operating system]]s. It also supports several [[Personal Digital Assistant|palmtop]] computing platforms, including [[Apple Newton|Newton]] and the [[Palm OS]]. 
The software was named after American author [[Eudora Welty]], because of her short story ''Why I Live at the P.O.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://art-bin.com/art/or_weltypostoff.html &quot;Why I Live at the P.O.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eudora.com/presskit/backgrounder.html#name Eudora Background Documents]&lt;/ref&gt; Eudora was developed in 1988 by [[Steve Dorner]], who worked at the Computer Services Organization of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.archives/msg/e3bcb4c240c5827e?dmode=source&amp;hl=en|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[appletalk]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Re: PopMail+GatorBox+MacTCP|publisher=comp.archives|date=1990-07-09}} USENET posting with Steve Dorner's announcement of Eudora.&lt;/ref&gt; Eudora was acquired by [[Qualcomm]] in 1991. In 2006 Qualcomm stopped development of the commercial version, and sponsored the creation of a new open-source version based on [[Mozilla Thunderbird]], code-named [[Penelope (e-mail client)|Penelope]].

==History==
Originally distributed for free, Eudora was commercialized and offered in a Light ([[freeware]]) and Pro (commercial) product. Between 2003 and 2006, the full-featured Pro version was also available as a &quot;Sponsored mode&quot; ([[adware]]) distribution.

Eudora (6.0.1) added support for [[Bayesian spam filtering|Bayesian filtering]] of [[Spam (electronic)|spam]] with a feature called ''SpamWatch''. Eudora (6.2) added a scam watch feature that flags suspicious links within e-mails in an attempt to thwart [[phishing]]. Eudora (7.0) added Ultra-Fast Search, which finds any emails using single or multiple criteria in seconds.

Eudora has support for 'Stationery', a standard message or reply prepared ahead of time to a common question. Eudora stores e-mails in the [[mbox]] format, which uses plain [[text file]]s instead of a database as [[Microsoft Outlook]] does.  This allows the user to back up portions of their e-mail correspondence without backing up the entire [[database]].

Eudora supports the [[Post Office Protocol|POP3]], [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] and [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] protocols. Eudora also has support for SSL and, in Windows, S/MIME authentication, allowing users to sign or encrypt email communications for greatest security.

Eudora is noteworthy for its extensive variety of settings to customize its behavior, many of which are not available in the user interface but are accessed using numbered &quot;x-eudora-setting&quot; URIs that must be pasted into a message and clicked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eudora.com/techsupport/mac/download/X-Eudora-Settings.txt X-Eudora-Settings URIs]&lt;/ref&gt;

At one time, Eudora also offered a [[webmail]] version at eudoramail.com. This service was run by [[Lycos]] as part of Mailcity, later renamed [[Lycos Mail]]. As of 2006, Eudoramail addresses for users still work (and are redirected to Lycos Mail accounts), but new users cannot sign up for the service.

===Successors===
On October 11, 2006, [[Qualcomm]] announced&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qualcomm.com/press/releases/2006/061011_project_collaboration_mozilla.html Qualcomm Press Center- Qualcomm Launches Project in Collaboration with Mozilla Foundation to Develop Open Source Version of Eudora Email Program&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; that future versions of Eudora would be based on the same technology platform as [[Mozilla Thunderbird]] and be [[open source]]. The codename for this project is &quot;''[[Penelope (e-mail client)|Penelope]]''&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Penelope Penelope - MozillaWiki&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Penelope is developed by the [[Mozilla Foundation]], and the project is being led by the former Qualcomm team, including original developer [[Steve Dorner]]. Eudora, although based on Open Source Thunderbird software, is not wholly open source.

Penelope is available as an [[Mozilla Thunderbird#Extensions|extension]] to Mozilla Thunderbird. The Paid mode commercial version of Eudora is no longer available as of May 1, 2007. The Light/Sponsored mode versions of Eudora continue to be available for download.

As of July 2, 2010, the name was changed to Eudora OSE (Open Source Edition) and the version number was reset to 1.0 when it was released.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Eudora_Releases#Eudora_OSE_1.0rc1_.28release_candidate_1.29_.282_Jul_2010.29]&lt;/ref&gt;  From the beta 1.0 release candidate 1 readme.txt: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Beta versions of Eudora OSE were originally named just Eudora with a version number of 8.0.  This caused some confusion in that some users expected the new version to be a regular update to Classic Eudora.  Since Eudora OSE uses an entirely different code base from Classic Eudora, in an effort to reduce the confusion the application was renamed to Eudora OSE (Open Source Edition). The version number was also reset to 1.0, which has the added benefit that it is synchronized with the Penelope version number.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The first release version of Eudora OSE 1.0 became available on September 13, 2010. Since that time, all activity and development has ceased and developers continue to ignore queries about future updates much less the future of Eudora. 

Eudora OSE does not retain the original mbox data structure, which stores all attachments as individual files together in one folder. It uses the same modern mbox file used by Apple Mail and others. No software is currently developed/supported that can access old Eudora mail archives directly, without import/conversion. 

Many Eudora users responded poorly&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.mozilla.org/Talk:Penelope]&lt;/ref&gt; to the direction Penelope took. Similarly, reception to Eudora OSE continues to be lukewarm months after the release. As it stands, the intended updates&lt;ref&gt;https://wiki.mozilla.org/Penelope#Release_Cycle&lt;/ref&gt; to be released in parallel with new Thunderbird releases have not materialized and continue to lead to frustration and disappointment in the Eudora community. Rather than make pronouncements and calling Eudora &quot;Open Source&quot;, it is more correct to call it limited Open Source. The source code to Eudora OSE cannot be downloaded in any form.

This does not constitute a classic OSE scenario for an expired product.  (ie. Eudora 7's complete and actual code being made available for GPL or OSE development by a community of users). This is however identical to the [[Netscape]] Gecko transition, eventually resulting in Firefox. 

Instead Thunderbird is given a Eudora skin, leaving the entire back-end to be Thunderbird/Mozilla. Part of Eudora's popularity was arguably the ease of which utilities could be built for it. This encouraged users and businesses to adapt it to a variety of integrated solutions. Thunderbird's backend is incompatible with these utilities.
