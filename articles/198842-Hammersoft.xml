'''Grasslands''' are areas where the [[vegetation]] is dominated by [[grass]]es ([[Poaceae]]) and other [[herbaceous]] (non-woody) plants ([[forb]]s). However, sedge ([[Cyperaceae]]) and rush ([[Juncaceae]]) families can also be found. Grasslands occur naturally on all continents except [[Antarctica]]. In [[temperate]] [[latitude]]s, such as [[northwestern Europe]] and the [[Great Plains]] and [[California]] in [[North America]], native grasslands are dominated by perennial [[bunch grass]] species, whereas in warmer [[climate]]s annual species form a greater component of the vegetation.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot;&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Laboratory/Biome/biograssland.html NASA Earth Observatory webpage]. Earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grasslands are found in most [[ecoregion]] of the [[Earth]]. For example there are five [[terrestrial ecoregion]] classifications (subdivisions) of the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands]] [[biome]] ('[[ecosystem]]'), which is one of eight [[terrestrial ecozone]]s of the Earth's surface.

==Vegetation==
Grassland vegetation can vary in height from very short, as in chalk where the vegetation may be less than {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} high, to quite tall, as in the case of [[North America]]n [[tallgrass prairie]], [[South America]]n grasslands and [[Africa]]n [[savanna]].

Woody plants, shrubs or trees, may occur on some grasslands â forming savannas, scrubby grassland or semi-wooded grassland, such as the African savannas or the [[Iberia]]n [[Dehesa (pastoral management)|dehesa]]. Such grasslands are sometimes referred to as wood-pasture or [[woodland]].&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;[http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/exhibits/biomes/grasslands.php University of California Museum of Paleontology Grasslands website]. Ucmp.berkeley.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As flowering [[plant]]s, grasses grow in great concentrations in [[climate]]s where annual [[rain]]fall ranges between {{convert|500|and|900|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated2&quot; /&gt; The root systems of perennial grasses and [[forb]]s form complex mats that hold the [[soil]] in place.

==Evolution==
The appearance of mountains in the [[western United States]] during the [[Miocene]] and [[Pliocene]] epochs, a period of some 25 million years, created a continental climate favorable to the evolution of grasslands. Existing forest biomes declined, and grasslands became much more widespread. Following the [[Pleistocene]] [[Ice Ages]], grasslands expanded in range in the hotter, drier climates, and began to become the dominant land feature worldwide.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt;

== Climate ==
Natural grasslands primarily occur in regions that receive between {{convert|250|and|900|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year, as compared with [[deserts]], which receive less than {{convert|250|mm|abbr=on}} and [[tropical rainforests]], which receive more than {{convert|2000|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot; /&gt; [[human impact on the environment|Anthropogenic]] grasslands often occur in much higher rainfall zones, as high as {{convert|200|cm|abbr=on}} annual rainfall. Grassland can exist naturally in areas with higher rainfall when other factors prevent the growth of forests, such as in [[serpentine barrens]], where minerals in the soil inhibit most plants from growing.

Average daily temperatures range between â20 and 30 Â°C.&lt;ref&gt;[http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Laboratory/Biome/biograssland.html EO Experiments: Grassland Biome]. Earthobservatory.nasa.gov. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Temperate grasslands have warm summers and cold winters with rain or some snow.

== Biodiversity and conservation ==
Grasslands dominated by unsown wild-plant communities (&quot;unimproved grasslands&quot;) can be called either natural or 'semi-natural' habitats. The majority of grasslands in temperate climates are 'semi-natural'. Although their plant communities are natural, their maintenance depends upon anthropogenic activities such as low-intensity farming, which maintains these grasslands through grazing and cutting regimes. These grasslands contain many species of wild plants â grasses, sedges, rushes and herbs â 25 or more speerican prairie grasslands or lowland wildflower meadows in the UK are now rare and their associated wild flora equally threatened. Associated with the wild-plant diversity of the &quot;unimproved&quot; grasslands is usually a rich invertebrate fauna; also there are many species of birds that are grassland &quot;specialists&quot;, such as the [[snipe]] and the [[Great Bustard]]. Agriculturally improved grasslands, which dominate modern intensive agricultural landscapes, are usually poor in wild plant species due to the original diversity of plants having been destroyed by cultivation, the original wild-plant communities having been replaced by sown monocultures of cultivated varieties of grasses and clovers, such as [[Perennial ryegrass]] and [[White Clover]]. In many parts of the world &quot;unimproved&quot; grasslands are one of the least threatened habitats, and a target for acquisition by wildlife conservation groups or for special grants to landowners who are encouraged to manage them appropriately.

== Human impact and economic importance ==

Grasslands are of vital importance for raising livestock for human consumption and for milk and other dairy products.

Grassland vegetation remains dominant in a particular area usually due to grazing, cutting, or natural or manmade fires, all discouraging colonisation by and survival of tree and shrub [[seedling]]s. Some of the world's largest expanses of grassland are found in African savanna, and these are maintained by wild herbivores as well as by nomadic pastoralists and their cattle, sheep or goats.

Grasslands may occur naturally or as the result of human activity. Grasslands created and maintained by human activity are called '''anthropogenic grasslands'''. Hunting peoples around the world often set regular fires to maintain and extend grasslands, and prevent fire-intolerant trees and shrubs from taking hold. The tallgrass [[prairie]]s in the American Midwest may have been extended eastward into [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], and [[Ohio]] by human agency. Much grassland in northwest Europe developed after the Neolithic Period, when people gradually cleared the forest to create areas for raising their livestock.

== Grassland types ( biomes ) ==
=== Tropical and subtropical grasslands ===
These grasslands are classified with tropical and subtropical [[savanna]]s and [[shrubland]]s as the [[tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|tropical and subtropical grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome]]. Notable tropical and subtropical grasslands include the [[Llanos]] grasslands of northern [[South America]].

=== Temperate grasslands ===
Mid-latitude grasslands, including the [[Prairie]] and [[California native plants#Common Grasses of California|Pacific Grasslands]] of [[North America]], the [[Pampas]] of [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]] and [[Uruguay]], calcareous [[downland]], and the [[steppe]]s of [[Europe]]. They are classified with temperate savannas and shrublands as the [[temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands|temperate grasslands, savannas, and shrublands biome]]. Temperate grasslands are the home to many large [[herbivores]], such as [[bison]], [[gazelle]]s, [[zebra]]s, [[rhinoceros]]es, and [[wild horse]]s. [[Carnivores]] like [[lion]]s, [[wolf|wolves]] and [[cheetah]]s and leopards are also found in temperate grasslands. Other animals of this region include: [[deer]], [[prairie dog]]s, [[mouse|mice]], [[jack rabbit]]s, [[skunk]]s, [[coyote]]s, [[snake]]s, [[fox]], [[owl]]s, [[badger]]s, blackbirds (both [[Common Blackbird|Old]] and [[New World blackbird|New World]] varieties), [[grasshopper]]s, [[meadowlark]]s, [[sparrow]]s, [[quail]]s, [[hawk]]s and [[hyena]]s.

=== Flooded grasslands ===
Grasslands that are flooded seasonally or year-round, like the [[Everglades]] of [[Florida]], the [[Pantanal]] of [[Brazil]], [[Bolivia]] and [[Paraguay]] or the [[Esteros del Ibera]] in [[Argentina]].They are classified with flooded savannas as the [[flooded grasslands and savannas|flooded grasslands and savannas biome]] and occur mostly in the tropics and subtropics.

[[Watermeadow]]s are grasslands that are deliberately flooded for short periods.

=== Montane grasslands ===
High-altitude grasslands located on high [[mountain ranges]] around the world, like the [[PÃ¡ramo]] of the [[Andes Mountains]]. They are part of the [[montane grasslands and shrublands|montane grasslands and shrublands biome]] and also constitute [[tundra]].

=== Tundra grasslands ===
Similar to montane grasslands, polar [[arctic tundra]] can have grasses, but high soil moisture means that few tundras are grass-dominated today. However, during the [[Pleistocene]] [[ice age]]s, a polar grassland known as [[steppe-tundra]] occupied large areas of the Northern hemisphere. These are in the [[Tundra|tundra biome]].

===Desert and xeric grasslands ===
Also called desert grasslands, this is composed of sparse grassland ecoregions located in the [[deserts and xeric shrublands|deserts and xeric shrublands biome]].

== Fauna ==

[[Mite]]s, insect [[larva]]e, [[nematode]]s and [[earthworm]]s inhabit deep soil, which can reach {{convert|6|m}} underground in undisturbed grasslands on the richest soils of the world. These invertebrates, along with symbiotic fungi, extend the root systems, break apart hard soil, enrich it with [[urea]] and other natural fertilizers, trap minerals and water and promote growth.&lt;ref&gt;Chadwick 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Some types of fungi make the plants more resistant to insect and microbial attacks.

Grassland in all its form supports a vast variety of mammals, reptiles, birds, and insects. Typical large mammals include the [[Blue Wildebeest]], [[American Bison]], [[Giant Anteater]] and [[Przewalski's Horse]]. 

While grasslands in general support diverse wildlife, given the lack of hiding places for predators, the African [[savanna]] regions support a much greater diversity in wildlife than do temperate grasslands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kids.nceas.ucsb.edu/biomes/grassland.html Univesity of California- Santa Barbara Temperate Grasslands website]. Kids.nceas.ucsb.edu. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is evidence for grassland being much the product of animal behaviour and movement;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.managingwholes.com/grazing-heals-land.htm How can grazing heal land?]. ManagingWholes.com. Retrieved on 2011-12-01.&lt;/ref&gt; some examples include migratory herds of antelope trampling vegetation and [[African Bush Elephant]]s eating [[Acacia]] saplings before the plant has a chance to grow into a mature tree.
