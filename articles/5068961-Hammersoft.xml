The '''Arizona League Dodgers''' are the Rookie Level [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] affiliate of the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].  They were formerly known as the '''Gulf Coast Dodgers''' and played in [[Vero Beach, Florida]], at [[Holman Stadium (Vero Beach)|Dodgertown]] (specifically on the historic Field One). Dodgertown includes Holman Stadium, which is also the former spring training home to the Brooklyn and [[Los Angeles Dodgers]].  The team was composed mainly of players who were in their first year of [[professional baseball]] either as [[Major League Baseball Draft|draftees]] or non-drafted [[free agents]]. 

The GCL Dodgers originally played from 1983â1992 and folded, but were reactivated by the franchise in 2001. In 2009, the Dodgers' announced that the team would move to the [[Arizona League]] and assume its new name. The team plays its home games at [[Camelback Ranch]], the Dodgers' [[spring training]] facility.
