He is a three-time [[United States Figure Skating Championships|national champion]] (1999, 2000, 2003) a two-time [[World Figure Skating Championships|World bronze medalist]] (1999, 2000), and two time Olympic team member.

==Personal life==
Michael Weiss was born in [[Washington, DC]] and comes from an athletic family. Weiss's father, [[Greg Weiss|Greg]], was a gymnast on the 1964 Olympic team. Weiss's mother, Margie, was also a gymnast and national champion. His sister Geremi was a figure skater and junior national silver medalist;&lt;ref name=tie110920/&gt; his other sister, Genna, was junior world diving champion.

Weiss graduated from [[Wilbert Tucker Woodson High School]] in [[Fairfax, VA]]. Weiss also holds an associate's degree in [[business marketing]] from [[Prince George's Community College]]. He was a member of the [[Phi Theta Kappa]] Honor Society.

Weiss and his wife Lisa have two children: Annie-Mae and Christopher.&lt;ref name=juggle/&gt;&lt;ref name=tie110920/&gt;

==Career==
Weiss began skating at the age of nine. He competed 19 consecutive times at the U.S. Championships. 
At the [[1997 United States Figure Skating Championships|1997 U.S. Championships]], he attempted to become the first American to land the [[Quad (figure skating)|quad]] [[Toe loop jump|toe loop]]. It was initially believed to have been successful but three hours after the competition, [[U.S. Figure Skating]] ruled the jump had been two-footed and did not ratify it.&lt;ref name=lat970216/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt970216/&gt; 

He was the first American to land a quadruple [[toe loop jump|toe loop]] in competition and has been coached by [[Don Laws]] and [[Audrey Weisiger]].

Weiss is the only skater to perform the Tornado, a backflip with a full twist, which he created. It is not allowed in competition, but it is a crowd favorite in exhibitions.

Weiss turned professional in 2006. He toured with [[Stars On Ice]] and has competed in [[Ice Wars]].
