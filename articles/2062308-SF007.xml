'''GnomeBaker''' is a [[Free software|free]] [[compact disc|CD]]/[[DVD]] [[CD recorder|authoring]] application for [[Unix-like]] computer [[operating system]]s. It is based on [[GNOME]] [[desktop environment]].

== Features ==

The GnomeBaker offers many features for authoring CDs that surpass the basic Nautilus CD/DVD burning capabilities. Among these are the possibility to create an audio cd from existing sound files and other useful things.

Available functions include:
* Create data CDs.
* Blank RW disks.
* Burn [[DVD]]s.
* Copy data and audio CDs.
* Support multisession burning.
* Record to and burn from existing CD [[ISO image]]s.
* Can burn via [[SCSI]] and [[ATAPI]] on [[Linux kernel]]s 2.4 and 2.6. 
* [[Drag and drop]] to create data CDs (including drag and drop to/from the [[Nautilus (file manager)|Nautilus]] file manager).
* Create audio CDs from existing [[WAV]], [[MP3]], [[FLAC]], and [[Ogg]] files.
* Integrate with [[GConf]] for storage of application settings.

== Limitations ==

* Does not support [[Universal Disk Format]] (&quot;UDF&quot;); only supports ISO 9660.
* Does not support the multi-extent (fragmentation) feature of ISO 9660 Level 3.  Consequently, there is a filesize limit of 4GB.
