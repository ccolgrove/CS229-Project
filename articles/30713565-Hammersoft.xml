The '''[[York Lions]] women's ice hockey team''' represents [[York University]] and competes in the [[Ontario University Athletics]] conference.

==History==

On February 11, 2000, the Ontario University Athletics women's ice hockey program saw its longest game take place. The [[University of Toronto]]'s Rhonda Mitchell scored on a 35-foot slap shot. It was the 5:07 mark of the eighth period and the Varsity Blues defeated York University. Although the victory allowed the U of T to advance to the OUA gold medal game, it was the longest in the history of Canadian women's hockey (since broken). &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oua.ca/sports/hockey/whockey/history/
|title= Women's Hockey Archives|author=  |date=  |work= |publisher= Ontario University Athletics|accessdate=10 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game lasted over five hours and ten minutes. York's player of the game was goaltender Debra Ferguson&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.yorku.ca/ycom/profiles/past/aug00/current/dept/dispatch/dsp6.htm

On February 5, 2011, two Lions players, forward [[Courtney Unruh]] and defender [[Kelsey Webster]] (and assistant coach Stacey Colarossi) were part of the Team Canada roster that captured gold at the 2011 Winter Universiade title as Canada defeated Finland 4-1 in the gold-medal final.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yorkulions.ca/sports/wice/2010-11/releases/02-05_FISU_Gold&lt;/ref&gt; Autumn Mills was the Ontario University Athletics (OUA) nominee for the 2011 Canadian Interuniversity Sport (CIS) Marion Hillard Award.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yorkulions.ca/sports/wice/2010-11/releases/02-16_Mills_OUA&lt;/ref&gt;
