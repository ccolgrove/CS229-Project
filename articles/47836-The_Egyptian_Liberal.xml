'''{{transl|ar|DIN|Ê¾AbÅ« l-WalÄ«d Muá¸¥ammad bin Ê¾Aá¸¥mad bin RuÅ¡d}}''' ({{lang-ar|Ø£Ø¨Ù Ø§ÙÙÙÙØ¯ ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø¨Ù Ø§Ø­ÙØ¯ Ø¨Ù Ø±Ø´Ø¯}}), better known just as '''Ibn Rushd''' ({{lang-ar|Ø§Ø¨Ù Ø±Ø´Ø¯}}), and in European literature as '''Averroes''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|É|Ë|v|Ér|oÊ|.|iË|z}}; 1126 â December 10, 1198), was a [[Muslim]] [[polymath]]; a master of Aristotelian philosophy, [[Islamic philosophy]], [[Islamic theology]], [[Maliki]] [[Sharia|law]] and [[Fiqh|jurisprudence]], [[logic]], [[psychology]], [[politics]], [[Arabic music]] theory, and the sciences of [[medicine]], [[astronomy]], [[geography]], [[mathematics]], [[physics]] and [[celestial mechanics]]. He was born in [[CÃ³rdoba, Spain|CÃ³rdoba]], [[Al Andalus]], modern-day [[Spain]], and died in [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]]. His school of philosophy is known as [[Averroism]].

Ibn Rushd was a defender of [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophy against claims from Islamic theologians such as [[Ghazali]] who feared that such teachings would become an affront to the teachings of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philosophybasics.com/philosophers_averroes.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name ==
Averroes' name is also seen as '''AverroÃ«s''', '''AverroÃ¨s''' or '''AverrhoÃ«s''', indicating that the &quot;o&quot; and the &quot;e&quot; form separate syllables. ''Averroes'' is a [[Latinisation (literature)|Latinisation]] of a Hebrew transcription of the Arab name ''Ibn Rushd''.&lt;ref name=Dangerous_Knowledge&gt;Robert Irwin (2006). ''Dangerous Knowledge: Orientalism and its Discontents''. The Overlook Press. ISBN 978-1-58567-835-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Ernest Renan]], he was also known as Ibin-Ros-din, Filius Rosadis, Ibn-Rusid, Ben-Raxid, Ibn-Ruschod, Den-Resched, Aben-Rassad, Aben-Rois, Aben-Rasd, Aben- Rust, Avenrosdy Avenryz, Adveroys, Benroist, Avenroyth, Averroysta, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Renan]], [http://www.archive.org/details/averrosetlaver00rena ''AverroÃ¨s et l'AverroÃ¯sme : essai historique''], 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:AverroesColor.jpg|245px|right|thumb|[[Ibn Rushd]] was the preeminent philosopher in the history of [[Al-Andalus]].]]

Averroes was born in [[CÃ³rdoba, Spain|CÃ³rdoba]] to a family with a long and well-respected tradition of legal and public service. His grandfather Abu Al-Walid Muhammad (d. 1126) was chief [[Qadi|judge]] of [[CÃ³rdoba, Spain|CÃ³rdoba]] under the [[Almoravid]]s. His father, Abu Al-Qasim Ahmad, held the same position until the [[Almoravid]]s were replaced by the [[Almohad]]s in 1146.&lt;ref name=Ahmad/&gt;

Averroesâs education followed a traditional path, beginning with studies in [[Hadith]], [[linguistics]], [[jurisprudence]] and scholastic [[theology]]. Throughout his life he wrote extensively on [[Philosophy]] and [[Religion]], attributes of God, origin of the universe, [[Metaphysics]] and [[Psychology]]. It is generally believed that he was perhaps once tutored by [[Ibn Bajjah]] (Avempace). His medical education was directed under [[Abu Jafar ibn Harun of Trujillo]] in [[Seville]].&lt;ref name=Hiller&gt;H. Chad Hillier (2006). [http://www.iep.utm.edu/i/ibnrushd.htm Averroes (Averroes) (1126 - 1198 CE)], ''[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
Averroes began his career with the help of [[Ibn Tufail]] (&quot;Aben Tofail&quot; to the West), the author of ''[[Hayy ibn Yaqdhan]]'' and philosophic [[vizier]] of Almohad king [[Abu Yaqub Yusuf]] who was an amateur of philosophy and science. It was Ibn Tufail who introduced him to the court and to [[Ibn Zuhr]] (&quot;Avenzoar&quot; to the West), the great [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Muslim physician]], who became Averroes's teacher and friend. Averroes's aptitude for [[medicine]] was noted by his contemporaries and can be seen in his major enduring work ''Kitab al-Kulyat fi al-Tibb'' (Generalities) the work was influenced by the ''Kitab al-Taisir fi al-Mudawat wa al-Tadbir'' (Particularities) of [[Ibn Zuhr]].&lt;ref name=dictionary&gt;Bynum, WF &amp; Bynum, Helen (2006), ''Dictionary of Medical Biography'', Greenwood Press, ISBN 0-313-32877-3&lt;/ref&gt; Averroes later reported how it was also Ibn Tufail that inspired him to write his famous [[commentaries on Aristotle]]:

{{quote|Abu Bakr ibn Tufayl summoned me one day and told me that he had heard the [[Amir al-Mu'minin|Commander of the Faithful]] complaining about the disjointedness of [[Aristotle]]'s mode of expression â or that of the translators â and the resultant obscurity of his intentions. He said that if someone took on these books who could summarize them and clarify their aims after first thoroughly understanding them himself, people would have an easier time comprehending them. âIf you have the energy,â Ibn Tufayl told me, âyou do it. I'm confident you can, because I know what a good mind and devoted character you have, and how dedicated you are to the art. You understand that only my great age, the cares of my office â and my commitment to another task that I think even more vital â keep me from doing it myself.â&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed [[Hossein Nasr]] and [[Oliver Leaman]] (1996), ''History of Islamic Philosophy'', p. 314, [[Routledge]], ISBN 0-415-13159-6.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Averroes was also a student of [[Ibn Bajjah]] (&quot;Avempace&quot; to the West), another famous [[Islamic philosophy|Islamic philosopher]] who greatly influenced his own [[Averroism|Averroist]] thought. However, while the thought of his mentors Ibn Tufail and Ibn Bajjah were [[Mysticism|mystic]] to an extent, the thought of Averroes was purely [[Rationalism|rationalist]]. Together, the three men are considered the greatest Andalusian philosophers.&lt;ref name=Ahmad/&gt;

In 1160, Averroes was made ''[[Qadi]]'' (judge) of [[Seville]] and he served in many court appointments in Seville, Cordoba, and [[Morocco]] during his career. Sometimes during the reign of [[Yaqub al-Mansur]], Averroes' political career was abruptly ended and he faced severe criticism from the [[Faqih|Fuqaha]] (Islamic jurists) of the time.&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot;/&gt;

A contemporary of Averroes, [[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]] writing in 1224, reported that there were secret and public reasons for his falling out of favor with Yaqub al-Mansour:&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot;/&gt;
{{quote
|text=And in his days [Yaqub al-Mansur], Abu al-Walid Ibn Rushd faced his severe ordeal and there were two causes for this; one is known and the other is secret. The secret cause, which was the major reason, is that Abu al-Walid [Averroes] âmay God have mercy on his soulâ when summarizing, commenting and expending upon Aristotle's book &quot;[[History of Animals]]&quot; wrote: &quot;And I saw the [[Giraffe]] at the garden of the king of the Berbers&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;And that is the same way he would mention another king of some other people or land, as it is frequently done by writers, but he omitted that those working for the service of the king should glorify him and observe the usual protocol. This was why they held a grudge against him [Averroes] but initially, they did not show it and in reality, Abu al-Walid wrote that inadvertently...Then a number of his enemies in Cordoba, who were jealous of him and were competing with him both in knowledge and nobility, went to Yaqub al-Mansur with excerpts of Abu Walid's work on some old philosophers which were in his own handwriting. They took one phrase out of context that said: &quot;and it was shown that Venus is one of the Gods&quot; and presented it to the king who then summoned the chiefs and noblemen of [[Cordoba]] and said to Abu al-Walid in front of them &quot;Is this your handwriting?&quot;. Abu al-Walid then denied and the king said &quot;May God curse the one who wrote this&quot; and ordered that Abu al-Walid be exiled and all the philosophy books to be gathered and burned...And I saw, when I was in [[Fes]], these books being carried on horses in great quantities and burned&lt;ref name=&quot;Mo3jib&quot;&gt;[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]], al-Mojib fi Talkhis Akhbar al-Maghrib [The Pleasant Book in Summarizing the History of the Maghreb], pp.150-151 (1224), King Saud University&lt;/ref&gt;
|sign=[[Abdelwahid al-Marrakushi]]
|source=&quot;The Pleasant Book in Summarizing the History of the Maghreb&quot;, (1224)}}

Averroes's strictly rationalist views collided with the more orthodox views of [[Abu Yusuf Ya'qub al-Mansur]], who therefore eventually banished Averroes, though he had previously appointed him as his personal [[Medicine in medieval Islam|physician]]. Averroes was not reinstated until shortly before his death in the year 1198 AD. He devoted the rest of his life (more than 30 years) to his philosophical writings.

[[Image:Bnf lat16151 f22.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Commentarium magnum Averrois in Aristotelis'' ''[[De Anima]] libros''. French manuscript, third quarter of the 13th century]]
Averroes's works were spread over 20,000 pages covering a variety of different subjects, including [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[logic in Islamic philosophy]], [[Medicine in medieval Islam|Arabic medicine]], [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arabic mathematics]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arabic astronomy]], [[Arabic grammar]], [[Islamic theology]], [[Sharia]] (Islamic law), and [[Fiqh]] (Islamic jurisprudence). In particular, his most important works dealt with [[Islamic philosophy]], medicine and Fiqh. He wrote at least 67 original works, which included 28 works on philosophy, 20 on medicine, 8 on law, 5 on theology, and 4 on grammar, in addition to his commentaries on most of Aristotle's works and his commentary on [[Plato]]'s ''[[The Republic (Plato)|The Republic]]''.&lt;ref name=Ahmad&gt;{{citation|last=Ahmad|first=Jamil|date=September 1994|title=Averroes|journal=[[Al-Mawrid|Monthly Renaissance]]|volume=4|issue=9|url=http://www.monthly-renaissance.com/issue/content.aspx?id=744|accessdate=2008-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He wrote commentaries on most of the surviving works of Aristotle. These were not based on primary sources (it is not known whether he knew [[Greek language|Greek]]), but rather on [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations.  There were three levels of commentary: the ''Jami'', the ''Talkhis'' and the ''[[Tafsir]]'' which are, respectively, a simplified overview, an intermediate commentary with more critical material, and an advanced study of Aristotelian thought in a [[Muslim]] context. The terms are taken from the names of different types of commentary on the [[Qur'an]]. It is not known whether he wrote commentaries of all three types on all the works: in most cases only one or two commentaries survive.

He did not have access to any text of Aristotle's ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]''. As a substitute for this, he commented on Plato's ''The Republic'', arguing that the ideal state there described was the same as the original constitution of the Arab [[Caliphate]],&lt;ref name=Ahmad/&gt; as well as the [[Almohad]] state of [[Ibn Tumart]].

His most important original philosophical work was ''[[The Incoherence of the Incoherence]]'' (''Tahafut al-tahafut''), in which he defended [[Aristotelian philosophy]] against [[al-Ghazali]]'s claims in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa''). Al-Ghazali argued that Aristotelianism, especially as presented in the writings of [[Avicenna]], was self-contradictory and an affront to the teachings of [[Islam]]. Averroes' rebuttal was two-pronged: he contended both that al-Ghazali's arguments were mistaken and that, in any case, the system of Avicenna was a distortion of genuine Aristotelianism so that al-Ghazali was aiming at the wrong target. Other works were the ''Fasl al-Maqal'', which argued for the legality of philosophical investigation under Islamic law, and the ''Kitab al-Kashf'', which argued against the proofs of Islam advanced by the [[Ash'ari]]te school and discussed what proofs, on the popular level, should be used instead.

Averroes is also a highly regarded legal scholar of the [[Maliki]] school. Perhaps his best-known work in this field is ''BidÄyat al-Mujtahid wa NihÄyat al-Muqtaá¹£id'' ( Ø¨Ø¯Ø§ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙØ¬ØªÙØ¯ Ù ÙÙØ§ÙØ© Ø§ÙÙÙØªØµØ¯), a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework.

[[Jacob Anatoli]] translated several of the works of Averroes from Arabic into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] in the 13th century. Many of them were later translated from Hebrew into [[Latin]] by [[Jacob Mantino]] and [[Abraham de Balmes]].  Other works were translated directly from Arabic into Latin by [[Michael Scot]].  Many of his works in [[logic]] and [[metaphysics]] have been permanently lost, while others, including some of the longer Aristotelian commentaries, have only survived in Latin or Hebrew translation, not in the original Arabic. The fullest version of his works is in Latin, and forms part of the multi-volume Juntine edition of Aristotle published in Venice 1562-1574.

==Science==
===Medicine===
Averroes wrote a medical encyclopedia called ''Kulliyat'' (&quot;Generalities&quot;, i.e. general medicine), known in its Latin translation as ''Colliget''.  He also made a compilation of the works of [[Galen]], and wrote a commentary on the [[Canon of Medicine]] (Qanun fi 't-tibb) of [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) (980-1037).

===Commentaries on Aristotle and Plato===
[[Image:Bnf lat16151 f22.jpg|right|thumb|200px|''Commentarium magnum Averrois in Aristotelis'' ''[[De Anima]] libros''. French Manuscript, third quarter of the 13th century]]
He wrote commentaries on most of the surviving works of [[Aristotle]]. These were not based on primary sources (it is not known whether he knew Greek), but rather on [[Arabic language|Arabic]] translations.  On each work, he wrote the ''Jami'', the ''Talkhis'' and the ''Tafsir'' which are, respectively, a simplified overview, an intermediate commentary with more critical material, and an advanced study of Aristotelian thought in a [[Muslim]] context.

He did not have access to any text of Aristotle's [[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]].  As a substitute for this, he commented on Plato's [[Republic (Plato)|Republic]], arguing that the state there described was the same as the original constitution of the Arabs.

===Independent philosophical works===

His most important original philosophical work was ''The Incoherence of the Incoherence'' (''Tahafut al-tahafut''), in which he defended [[Aristotelian philosophy]] against [[al-Ghazali]]'s claims in ''[[The Incoherence of the Philosophers]]'' (''Tahafut al-falasifa'').

The fullest version of his works is in Latin, and forms part of the multi-volume Juntine edition of Aristotle published in Venice 1562-1574.

===System of philosophy===
{{main|Averroism}}
Averroes tried to reconcile Aristotle's system of thought with [[Islam]]. According to him, there is no conflict between [[religion]] and [[philosophy]], rather that they are different ways of reaching the same truth. He believed in the [[eternity]] of the [[universe]]. He also held that the [[soul]] is divided into two parts, one individual and one divine; while the individual soul is not eternal, all humans at the basic level share one and the same divine soul. Averroes has two kinds of Knowledge of Truth.  The first being his knowledge of truth of religion being based in faith and thus could not be tested, nor did it require training to understand.  The second knowledge of truth is philosophy, which was reserved for an elite few who had the intellectual capacity to undertake its study.

==Significance==
[[Image:Averroes closeup.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Averroes, detail of the fresco ''[[The School of Athens]]'' by [[Raphael]]]]
Averroes is most famous for his translations and commentaries of Aristotle's works, which had been mostly forgotten in the [[Western world|West]]. Before [[1150]] only a few translated works of Aristotle existed in Latin Europe (i.e. excluding Greek Byzantium), and they were not studied much or given as much credence by monastic scholars. It was in part through the [[Latin language|Latin]] translations of Averroes's work beginning in the 12th century that the legacy of Aristotle was recovered in the West.

Averroes's work on Aristotle spans almost three decades, and he wrote commentaries on almost all of Aristotle's work except for Aristotle's ''Politics'', to which he did not have access. Hebrew translations of his work also had a lasting impact on [[Jewish philosophy]]. His ideas  were assimilated by [[Siger of Brabant]] and [[Thomas Aquinas]] and others (especially in the [[University of Paris]]) within the [[Christian]] [[Scholasticism|scholastic]] tradition which valued Aristotelian logic. Famous scholastics such as Aquinas believed him to be so important they did not refer to him by name, simply calling him &quot;The Commentator&quot; and calling Aristotle &quot;The Philosopher.&quot; Averroes also greatly influenced philosophy in the Islamic world. His death coincides with a change in the culture of Al-Andalus. In his work ''Fasl al-MaqÄl'' (translated a. o. as ''The Decisive Treatise''), he stresses the importance of analytical thinking as a prerequisite to interpret the [[Qur'an]].

Averroes's treatise on ''[[Republic (Plato)|Plato's Republic]]'' has played a major role in both the transmission and the adaptation of the [[Plato]]nic tradition in the West{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}. It has been a primary source in [[Medieval philosophy|medieval political philosophy]].

Averroes was one of those who predicted the existence of a [[New World|new world]] beyond the [[Atlantic Ocean]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aljazeera.com/me.asp?service_ID=10945&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}
==Jurisprudence and law==
Averroes is also a highly-regarded legal scholar of the [[Maliki]] school.  Perhaps his best-known work in this field is &quot;BidÄyat al-Mujtahid wa NihÄyat al-Muqtaá¹£id,&quot; a textbook of Maliki doctrine in a comparative framework. He is also the author of &quot;al-BayÄn waâl-Taá¸¥á¹£Ä«l, waâl-Shará¸¥ waâl-TawjÄ«h waâl-Ta`lÄ«l fi MasÄâil al-Mustakhraja,&quot; a long and detailed commentary based on the &quot;Mustakhraja&quot; of Muá¸¥ammad al-`UtbÄ« al-QurtubÄ«.

==Cultural influences==

Reflecting the respect which [[medieval]] [[Europe]]an scholars paid to him, Averroes is named by [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] in ''[[The Divine Comedy]]'' with the great pagan philosophers whose spirits dwell in &quot;the place that favor owes to fame&quot; in [[Limbo]].

Averroes appears in a short story by [[Jorge Luis Borges]], entitled &quot;[[Averroes's Search]]&quot;, in which he is portrayed trying to find the meanings of the words ''[[tragedy]]'' and ''[[comedy]]''. He is briefly mentioned in the novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' by [[James Joyce]] alongside [[Maimonides]]. He appears to be waiting outside the walls of the ancient city of Cordoba in [[Alamgir Hashmi]]'s poem ''In Cordoba''. He is also the main character in ''Destiny'', a [[Youssef Chahine]] film. The [[asteroid]] [[8318 Averroes]] was named in his honor.
