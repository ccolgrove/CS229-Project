The '''quiff''' is a [[hairstyle]] that combines the 1950s [[Pompadour (hairstyle)|pompadour]] hairstyle, the 50s [[flattop]], and sometimes a [[Mohawk hairstyle|mohawk]]. The etymology of the word is uncertain but may derive from the French word &quot;coiffe&quot; which can mean either a hairstyle or, going further back, the mail knights wore over their heads and under their helmets. The hairstyle was a staple in the British '[[Teddy Boy]]' movement, but became popular again in Europe in the early 1980s with early [[psychobilly]] acts including [[The Meteors]], [[Demented Are Go]], and others.

For a while, DJ and TV presenter [[Mark Lamarr]] was a famous proponent of the quiff. [[Mark Kermode]], popular film critic and reviewer, is a well known for having an 'impeccably-coiffured quiff'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/5live/presenters/mark-kermode/&lt;/ref&gt; Probably the most famous example of the more prominent variety of the quiff is [[singer]] [[Morrissey]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.last.fm/music/Morrissey/+images/20025141&lt;/ref&gt; It has been taken to the extreme and parodied by the Finnish band [[Leningrad Cowboys]], and is their calling card.

The hairstyle, although prominent in the 80s, faded into obscurity except among ardent 80s culture fans. The quiff saw a revival in the late 90s, due to the advent of the French crop, a modern version of the quiff, and continues through today.

In the 2000s, pulling the fringe back into a quiff with a ponytail was a popular female hairstyle in some countries.

The [[Japanese people|Japanese]] [[Punch perm]], a favorite among [[Yakuza]] (organized criminal) and [[BÅsÅzoku]] (biker gang) members, bears a similarity to this hairstyle.

[[Irish people|Irish]] [[pop music]] duo [[Jedward]] are known for wearing their signature flamboyant [[blond hair|blond]] quiffs, which they described in a segment on ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://xfactor.itv.com/2009/beauty/beauty-confidential/detail/item_200738.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
