'''Westlake Village''' is a planned community that straddles the Los Angeles and Ventura county line.  The eastern portion is the [[Municipal corporation|incorporated city]] Westlake Village, located on the western edge of [[Los Angeles County, California]]. The city, located in the region known as the [[Conejo Valley]], encompasses half of the area surrounding Westlake Lake, and small neighborhoods primarily south of [[U.S. Route 101 (California)|U.S. Route 101]] and east of La Venta Drive. The population was 8,270 at the 2010 census, down from 8,368 at the 2000 census. It is also the headquarters of the [[Dole Food Company]]. Westlake Village is known for its affluence and secluded character, and is considered one of the wealthiest communities in the Greater Los Angeles Area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dexknows.com/geo/c-westlake_village-ca/ |title=Westlake Village, CA Yellow Pages/Online Phone Book, Search Local Business Listings @ |publisher=Dexknows.com |date=September 6, 2011 |accessdate=September 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The western portion of Westlake Village is a community, within the city limits of [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]], in [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].  It is important to note, the properties and businesses in this portion of Westlake Village are actually recorded in the Ventura County Recorder's office as &quot;Westlake Village&quot;, as the [[United States Post Office]] maps the 91362 ZIP code to both cities. Most residents recognize the community of Westlake Village as not limited to the incorporated city in Los Angeles County, but encompassing the entire area surrounding the lake on both sides of the county line. 

The original community was known simply as &quot;Westlake&quot;. Roughly two-thirds of it was annexed by the city of Thousand Oaks in two portions, in 1968 and 1972. In 1981, the remaining third eventually incorporated as the City of Westlake Village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wlv.org/city_hall/city-history.asp | title=City History | publisher=City of Westlake Village | accessdate=June 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
About 3,000 years ago, [[Chumash Indians]] moved into the region and lived by hunting rabbits and other game, and gathering grains and acorns. On-going excavations, archaeological sites, and polychrome rock paintings in the area provide a glimpse into the social and economic complexity of the ancient Chumash world. In 1770, Captain [[Gaspar de Portola]] led a party of Spanish explorers and missionaries, traveling north on the route that became known as [[El Camino Real (California)|El Camino Real]]. The party camped near a Chumash village, believed to be the site of present-day Westlake Village. Father [[Juan Crespi]], chaplain and diarist of the expedition, wrote: âWe are on a plain of considerable extent and much beauty, forested on all parts by live oaks and [[oak]] trees, with much pasturage and water.â

When the Spanish finally did settle the area, they were given huge land grants, the largest of which was [[Rancho Simi]], given to the Pico family. When Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, [[California]] became Mexican territory, and a few more land grants were given.  When California was admitted to the union in 1850, most of the land that later became Ventura County was divided among only 19 families. The picturesque future Westlake Village site among rising knolls, arroyos, barrancas and ancient oaks was recognized as the central part of two Mexican land grants: [[Rancho El Conejo]] and [[Rancho Las Virgenes]]. In 1881, the Russell brothers purchased a large portion of the land for cattle ranching. According to Patricia Allen, historian and family descendant, Andrew Russell beat the competition in buying the land by racing across 6,000 acres (24&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) on a fifteen-minute trip in a buckboard and sealed the deal with a $20 gold piece. The price per acre was $2.50. The area continued to be known as the Russell Ranch although it was sold in 1925 to William Randolph Hearst and again in 1943 to Fred Albertson. The Russell family leased back part of the land to continue its successful cattle ranch operation while the Albertson Company used the vast area as a movie ranch. Many movies and television shows were filmed here, including â[[Robin Hood]],â âKing Rat,â âLaredo,â and various episodes of â[[Tarzan]],â âBuck Rogers,â âGunsmoke,â and â[[Bonanza]].â
[[File:Westlake Village CA Westlake Lake.JPG|thumb|left|Westlake Lake in Westlake Village]]
In 1963, the [[American-Hawaiian Steamship Company]] bought the 12,000 acre (49&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) ranch for $32 million and, in partnership with [[Prudential Financial|Prudential]] Insurance Company, commissioned the preparation of a master plan for a âcity in the country.â  Prominent architects, engineers, and land planners participated in designing the new community, a prominent example of planned 1960's-style [[suburbanism]].

The original tract was divided by the Los Angeles/Ventura county line. In 1968 and 1972, the Ventura County side, two portions of Westlake Village consisting of {{convert|8544|acre|km2|0}}, were annexed into the city of [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]]. In 1981, the Los Angeles County portion ({{convert|3456|acre|km2}} or roughly 1/3) of the Westlake Village master community was incorporated as the City of Westlake Village. California state law prevents a city from existing in two separate counties, so the areas in Ventura County remained part of Thousand Oaks. To this day, many residents of the Ventura County portions of Westlake do not realize that they are actually within the city limits of Thousand Oaks.&lt;ref name=&quot;Acorn20110908&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.toacorn.com/news/2011-09-08/Front_Page/Which_Westlake.html|title=âWhich Westlake?â|last=Kuperberg|first=Jonathan|date=September 8, 2011|work=Thousand Oaks Acorn|accessdate=September 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Westlake Village CA Office Landscaping.JPG|thumb|Ornate landscaping in front of a Westlake Village office building.]]
Much of Westlake Village is surrounded by open space, including hiking and horse trails, as well as the vast [[Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area]]. The town borders the [[Malibu, California|Malibu]] hills, and is nine miles (14&amp;nbsp;km) inland from the Pacific Ocean. Coastal breezes seep through canyons to allow Westlake to stay up to 10 degrees cooler and considerably less smoggy than nearby [[San Fernando Valley]] during the summer months.

In addition to its role as a [[bedroom community]] for Los Angeles via the [[Ventura Freeway]], it is also home to many large commercial offices and the headquarters of the [[Dole Food Company]], [[Pleasant Holidays]], [[K-Swiss]], [[ValueClick]], [[J.D. Power and Associates]], and [[Vorwerk (company)|Jafra Cosmetics]].  The western region office (Region 5) of [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Inc.]] is also located in the community.  The [[Ventura Freeway]] is one of three of Westlake's lifelines to Los Angeles and Ventura; the [[California State Route 1|Pacific Coast Highway]], and the [[California State Route 118|Ronald Reagan (118) Freeway]] also run nearby. It is a short drive to the nearest mall in Thousand Oaks.

Like many upscale hamlets, Westlake Village is well served by golf courses and country clubs. The [[Westlake Golf Course]], off Route 101, is verdant if noisy. More exclusive venues include [[Sherwood Country Club]] to the west and [[North Ranch Country Club]] to the north.

{{wide image|Westlake Village and Agoura Hills California USA.jpg|700px|Panorama of Westlake Village.}}

Over one half of the original &quot;Westlake&quot; development lies across the county line wholly within the city limits of [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]]. This boundary which divides the Incorporated City of Westlake Village, and Thousand Oaks portion of Westlake Village, crosses over the Westlake Golf Course, halfway between Lakeview Canyon and Lindero Canyon roads, and half of the Lake itself. Another common misconception is that [[Lake Sherwood, California|Lake Sherwood]] is part of Westlake Village. It lies on the Thousand Oaks/[[Ventura County]] side.

The City of Westlake Village is located at {{Coord|34|8|31|N|118|49|10|W|city}} (34.141973, â118.819514).{{GR|1}} According to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the city has a total area of 5.5 square miles (14.3&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²). 5.2 square miles (13.4&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) of it (5.80%) is water. It is located approximately {{convert|40|mi|km|0}} West of downtown Los Angeles in the [[Conejo Valley]]. Other communities in the surrounding area include [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]], [[Oak Park, California|Oak Park]], [[Agoura Hills, California|Agoura Hills]], [[Calabasas, California|Calabasas]], [[Newbury Park, California|Newbury Park]], and [[Malibu, California|Malibu]].
