The '''[[2006 NFL season|2006]] [[Miami Dolphins]] season''' began with the team trying to improve on their 9â7 record in [[2005 NFL season|2005]].  Instead, they finished the season 6â10 after being hyped by some to represent the AFC in the [[Super Bowl]], and saw their coach [[Nick Saban]] abandon his contract to coach college football for the [[University of Alabama athletics|Alabama Crismon Tide]].

==Offseason==
On March 14, 2006, the Dolphins traded a 2nd round draft pick to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] to acquire quarterback [[Daunte Culpepper]]. Miami also acquired tackle [[L.J. Shelton]] from Cleveland and cornerback [[Will Allen (cornerback)|Will Allen]] from the [[New York Giants]], replacing longtime Dolphin [[Sam Madison]], who had taken Allen's old spot with the Giants.

In the [[2006 NFL Draft]], the Dolphins used their first pick on Tennessee safety [[Jason Allen (American football)|Jason Allen]].  They then used their next pick on Arizona State wide receiver [[Derek Hagan]].  The rest of their picks included Washington offensive tackle [[Joe Toledo]], Texas State/San Marcos defensive lineman [[Fred Evans (American football)|Fred Evans]], Texas defensive tackle [[Rodrique Wright]], and Auburn wide receiver [[Devin Aromashodu]].

On May 12, 2006, the Dolphins completed a trade with the [[Detroit Lions]] for QB [[Joey Harrington]], depending on his performance in the 2006â2007 season, the Lions will receive either a 5th or 6th round pick. They also signed [[Marcus Vick]] (ex-Virginia Tech quarterback and younger brother of [[Atlanta Falcons]] star [[Michael Vick]]) to a contract after he attended their annual rookie mini-camp.

On August 12, Miami Lost 23â19 to the [[Jacksonville Jaguars]] in their first preseason game of the year. The Dolphin's pulled out starting QB Daunte Culpepper after throwing only two passes. (1â2 2yds) All of the opposing Jaguars touch downs came on plays longer than 25 yards.

On August 14, the Dolphins signed free agent defensive tackle [[Dan Wilkinson|Dan &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Wilkinson]], a former #1 overall draft pick of the [[Cincinnati Bengals]] (1994), and had last played for the Detroit Lions.

On August 14, perennial All-Pro linebacker [[Junior Seau]] (who had been with the Dolphins for three seasons until he was released in March 2006) announced his retirement after 16 years in the NFL. However, he would ev&lt;includeonly&gt;â¬&lt;/includeonly&gt;entually join the Dolphins' division rival, the [[New England Patriots]].

''at [[Heinz Field]], [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]'' &lt;br&gt;

The Dolphins opened the regular season in the annual Thursday NFL Kickoff Game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] on September 7.  Even though newly-acquired QB [[Daunte Culpepper]] was doing a pretty good job on the pass and RB [[Ronnie Brown]] provided a touchdown, the Dolphins trailed 14â10 going into the second half, until Brown got another rushing touchdown.  Unfortunately, an 87-yard touchdown pass to Steeler tight end [[Heath Miller]] and a 42-yard interception return by ROLB [[Joey Porter]] sealed the Dolphins' fate. Head coach [[Nick Saban]] attempted to challenge Miller's touchdown reception on the grounds that he stepped out of bounds before reaching the goal line (which television replays proved was correct), however, officials failed to see Saban throw the red flag before the Steelers kicked the [[extra point]], and the Dolphins were unable to challenge the call. 

Of more concern than simply the loss was the performance of the Dolphins' prized offseason acquisition. Daunte Culpepper threw two interceptions, and floated several passes that were almost intercepted. This performance has sparked debate as to whether he will be able to return to his 2004 form or if he will have a repeat of his terrible 2005 campaign. 

One positive from the game was slot WR [[Wes Welker]]. He had 67 yards receiving and set up the first TD for Miami.

===Week 2: vs. Buffalo Bills===

''at [[Dolphin Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]'' &lt;br&gt;

The Dolphins were hoping to rebound by playing an AFC East bout with the visiting [[Buffalo Bills]] in their Week 2 home-opener.  Unfortunately, from the start, the Dolphins were unable to get anything going, as the Bills' [[Rian Lindell]] kicked a 33-yard field goal in the first quarter, while Buffalo's defense prevented Miami from getting any points throughout the first half.  In the third quarter, things only got worse, as opposing QB [[J.P. Losman]] threw a 4-yard TD pass to opposing WR [[Josh Reed]], while Lindell booted two field goals (45 &amp; 43-yarders).  The Dolphins finally managed to get some points as WR [[Chris Chambers]] caught a 23-yard TD pass, but Miami failed on the two-point conversion.  What made this loss even more frustrating was that Dolphins QB [[Daunte Culpepper]] got sacked seven times and fumbled twice, making Miami wonder if acquiring Culpepper was the right idea in the first place. With the loss, the Dolphins were 0â2.

===Week 3: vs. Tennessee Titans===

''at [[Dolphin Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]'' &lt;br&gt;

The Dolphins, still looking for their first win of the year, stayed at home for a Week 3 match-up with the [[Tennessee Titans]].  Miami drew first blood in the first quarter with kicker [[Olindo Mare]] kicking a 40-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins got a bit of a scare as Titans QB [[Kerry Collins]] completed a 27-yard pass to TE [[Bo Scaife]] for a touchdown and the lead.  In the third quarter, Miami reclaimed the lead with QB [[Daunte Culpepper]] getting a touchdown on a 5-yard scramble.  However, the Titans didn't go down quietly, as kicker [[Rob Bironas]] kicked a 22-yard field goal for Tennessee, putting the game in a 10â10 tie.  Fortunately, in the fourth quarter, Mare finally helped Miami get win #1 with a 39-yard field goal.

''at [[Reliant Stadium]], [[Houston, Texas]]'' &lt;br&gt;

The Dolphins hoped to carry the momentum from their Week 3 victory, as they traveled to [[Reliant Stadium]] to take on the [[Houston Texans]].  After a scoreless first quarter, Miami got on the board first with kicker [[Olindo Mare]] getting a 52-yard field goal, but the Texans got a field goal for themselves, as kicker [[Kris Brown]] got one from 32 yards out.  In the third quarter, the Dolphins got another field goal, as Mare got one from 29 yards out for the only score of the period.  However, in the fourth quarter, things got very ugly as the Texans got two touchdowns, with QB [[David Carr]] on a 1-yard run and WR [[Andre Johnson]] getting a 3-yard TD reception.  Miami valiantly tried to fight back, as Mare got a 22-yard field goal and QB [[Daunte Culpepper]] completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR [[Chris Chambers]], but in the end, a failed two-point conversion spelled doom for the Dolphins, as Miami failed to come back and would fall to 1â3.

''at [[Gillette Stadium]], [[Foxborough, Massachusetts]]'' &lt;br&gt;

With [[Daunte Culpepper]] being ineffective, QB [[Joey Harrington]] got the start for Week 5 as the Dolphins flew to [[Gillette Stadium]] for an AFC East match-up with the [[New England Patriots]].  Miami got off to a rough start, as they fell behind 3â0 with Patriots kicker [[Stephen Gostkowski]] kicking a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter.  In the second quarter, Miami continued to trail, as Gostkowski kicked a 31-yard field goal, while Pats QB [[Tom Brady]] completed a 10-yard TD pass to WR [[Troy Brown]].  The Dolphins would get back in the game before halftime, as RB [[Ronnie Brown]] got a 2-yard TD run and kicker [[Olindo Mare]] got a 40-yard field goal to help the Dolphins trail by three at halftime.  In the third quarter, the defense ruled as both teams failed to get a single point.  Unfortunately, in the fourth quarter, New England would get one more touchdown, as Brady completed a 1-yard strike to FB [[Heath Evans]].  From there, Miami failed to catch-up and fell to 1â4 with their defeat.

===Week 6: at New York Jets===

''at [[Giants Stadium]], [[East Rutherford, New Jersey]]'' &lt;br&gt;

Still searching for win #2, the Dolphins kept QB [[Joey Harrington]] in the starting line-up as they flew to [[Giants Stadium|The Meadowlands]] for an AFC East fight with the [[New York Jets]].  From the get-go, the Dolphins struggled as Jets kicker [[Mike Nugent]] kicked a 33-yard field goal for the only score of the first quarter and of the half.  In the third quarter, Nugent increased New York's lead again with another 33-yard field goal.  The Dolphins finally got on the board, as kicker [[Olindo Mare]] got a 21-yard field goal.  However, the Jets wouldn't let Miami regain itself, as QB [[Chad Pennington]] completed a 58-yard TD pass to WR [[Laveranues Coles]].  In the fourth quarter, they hooked up with each other again on a 22-yard TD pass.  The Dolphins attempted a fourth-quarter comeback, with Harrington completing a 2-yard TD pass to WR [[Chris Chambers]] and RB [[Ronnie Brown]] ran 1 yard for a TD, but when Mare missed what would have been a field goal in the final minute, the Dolphins sank to 1â5.

===Week 7: vs. Green Bay Packers===

QB [[Joey Harrington]] had 414 yards off a record 62 attempts (33 of them were complete), but he also threw 3 INT's (one returned for a TD).  Packers RB [[Ahman Green]] rushed for about 100 yards, including a 70 yd TD. Packers QB [[Brett Favre]] had 206 yards throwing and two 2 TD's and is closing on [[Dan Marino]]'s all-time completions and touchdown records.  Meanwhile, Favre's favorite WR [[Donald Driver]] had 10 receptions for 93 yards and a touchdown.  With the Dolphins, RB [[Ronnie Brown]] was limited to just 59 yards rushing on 15 carries and 63 yards receiving on 5 receptions.  The leading receiver for Miami was WR [[Marty Booker]], who had 7 receptions for 110 yards and a touchdown.  With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 1â6.

''at [[Soldier Field]], [[Chicago, Illinois]]'' &lt;br&gt;

Coming off their Bye Week, the Dolphins would get their second win of the 2006 season against the previously undefeated [[Chicago Bears]] at [[Soldier Field]].  Just as the 1985 Dolphins ended the Bears' attempt at a perfect season (they finished 18â1), This year's Dolphins again protected the 1972 Perfect Season on their own.  QB [[Joey Harrington]] was 16/32, for 137 yards, and 3 touchdowns, despite 2 interceptions.  The Dolphins fumbled twice, but recovered both times, and the Bears also fumbled twice, but both times Miami came away with the ball.  The Dolphins were also able to capitalize on 3 interceptions on [[Rex Grossman]] passes.  [[Ronnie Brown]] rushed for a career-high 157 yards, carrying 29 times.  [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] forced a fumble and returned an interception 20 yards for a touchdown, helping Miami in its 31â13 victory.  The spirit of the 1972 Dolphins looked alive and well as Miami improved to 2â6 on the year.

Coming off their amazing upset road win against the Bears, the Dolphins returned home for a Week 10 match-up with the [[Kansas City Chiefs]].  The Dolphins dominated the first half with kicker [[Olindo Mare]] getting a 40-yard field goal in the first quarter and a 22-yarder in the second quarter.  Also in the second period, RB [[Ronnie Brown]] got a 1-yard TD run.  After a scoreless third quarter, the Chiefs offense finally got going in the final period.  Kicker [[Lawrence Tynes]] nailed a 27-yard field goal, while RB [[Larry Johnson (American football)|Larry Johnson]] got a 2-yard TD.  Fortunately, Miami held on to its small lead and advanced to 3â6 on the year.

Coming off a two-game winning streak, the Dolphins stayed at home for a Week 11 fight against fellow teammate [[Daunte Culpepper]]'s former team, the [[Minnesota Vikings]].  In the first quarter, the Vikings struck first as RB [[Chester Taylor]] got a 1-yard TD run for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Dolphins took to the water as kicker [[Olindo Mare]] nailed a 44-yard field goal, while QB [[Joey Harrington]] got an 11-yard TD pass to TE [[Justin Peelle]].  In the third quarter, Minnesota came closer with kicker [[Ryan Longwell]] nailing a 35-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Vikings took a three-point lead, as Longwell kicked a 19-yard field goal.  However, Miami wouldn't have any of that, as the defense stepped up and made decisive plays.  Free Safety [[Renaldo Hill]] returned a fumble 48 yards for a touchdown, while DE [[Jason Taylor (American football)|Jason Taylor]] returned an interception 51 yards for a touchdown.  Minnesota would get one more touchdown (another 1-yard TD run by Taylor), but Miami ran out the clock to preserve their 3rd victory in a row.  With the victory, the Dolphins improved to 4â6.  The Dolphins' rushing yardage was a franchise low (â3 yards), and a team record for the Vikings' defense. [http://www.nfl.com/gamecenter/recap/NFL_20061119_MIN@MIA]

''at [[Ford Field]], [[Detroit, Michigan]]'' &lt;br&gt;

Going for their fourth-straight win, the Dolphins traveled to [[Ford Field]] for a Thanksgiving fight with the [[Detroit Lions]].  This game would be marked as Dolphins QB [[Joey Harrington]]'s return to Detroit, as he was constantly booed throughout the contest.  In the first quarter, Miami trailed as Lions QB [[Jon Kitna]] got Detroit off to a fast start.  Kitna would complete a 2-yard TD pass to TE [[Dan Campbell]], while kicker [[Jason Hanson]] nailed a 52-yard field goal.  Afterwards, Harrington started to get the Dolphins back into business as he completed his first-ever Thanksgiving touchdown pass on an 8-yard strike to WR [[Marty Booker]].  In the second quarter, Harrington acquired the only score of the period on a 5-yard TD pass to TE [[Randy McMichael]].  In the third quarter, kicker [[Olindo Mare]] nailed a 42-yard field goal, while Harrington and Booker connected with each other again on a 19-yard TD pass.  In the fourth quarter, Mare managed to put the game away with a 28-yard field goal.

RB [[Ronnie Brown]] only had 68 yards rushing (with 5 yards receiving), as he left the game early with a broken left hand. He is currently week-to-week and will likely miss the team's next game against Jacksonville.

With the Dolphins victory, not only did the Dolphins improve to 5â6, but Harrington also got his second-ever Thanksgiving Day victory and 1st, 2nd, and 3rd touchdown pass ever on Thanksgiving Day.

After a scoreless third quarter, Jacksonville continued its dominance with RB [[Maurice Jones-Drew]] getting a 32-yard TD run.  The Dolphins' only response was kicker [[Olindo Mare]] getting a 42-yard field goal.  With the loss, the Dolphins fell to 5â7.

Hoping to rebound from their loss to Jaguars, the Dolphins stayed at home for an AFC East rematch with the [[New England Patriots]].  From start to finish, Miami stayed in the driver's seat and lead throughout the game.  In the first quarter, the Dolphins' dominating day began with kicker [[Olindo Mare]] getting a 35-yard field goal in the first quarter, while also getting a 33-yard field goal in the second quarter.  In the third quarter, Miami continued their hot day as QB [[Joey Harrington]] completed a 32-yard TD pass to WR [[Marty Booker]] for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, RB [[Sammy Morris]] got a 3-yard TD run, which was followed up by a completed 2-point conversion pass from Harrington to Booker.  An impressive Dolphins defense held the Patriots to just 189 total yards of offense, while sacking Pats QB [[Tom Brady]] four times.  With the win, Miami improved to 6â7.

After a scoreless first quarter, Miami trailed early as in the second quarter, Bills QB [[J.P. Losman]] completed a 33-yard TD pass to TE [[Robert Royal]] for the only score of the period.  In the third quarter, things got worse as Losman completed a 27-yard TD pass to WR [[Josh Reed]] for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, the Dolphins' playoff hopes were completely erased when Losman completed a 21-yard TD pass to WR [[Lee Evans (American football)|Lee Evans]].  With the loss, not only did Miami fall to 6â8, but they would be unable to make the playoffs (and thus would be unable to play [[Super Bowl XLI]] on their own home turf as they are the host team for that game) as the Jets (8â6) and Jacksonville (8â6) would win by tiebreakers even if they won their remaining two games.

In the third quarter, New York broke first with kicker [[Mike Nugent]] getting a 22-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the fourth quarter, Miami finally went on the attack with Lemon completing a 7-yard TD pass to TE [[Randy McMichael]].  However, the Jets responded with QB [[Chad Pennington]] completing a 32-yard TD pass to WR [[Jerricho Cotchery]].  Even though the Dolphins managed to tie the game with kicker [[Olindo Mare]]'s 25-yard field goal.  New York made sure that head coach [[Nick Saban]] got his first losing season with the Dolphins after Nugent nailed the game-winning 30-yard field goal with ten seconds left.

In the first quarter, Miami struck first with kicker [[Olindo Mare]] getting a 28-yard field goal for the only score of the period.  In the second quarter, the Colts respond with QB [[Peyton Manning]] completing a 2-yard TD pass to DT [[Dan Klecko]].  The Dolphins would answer with Mare kicking a 38-yard field goal.  However, Indianapolis struck back with Manning getting an 11-yard TD run, while kicker [[Adam Vinatieri]] getting a 46-yard field goal to end the half.  In the third quarter, Miami tried to fight back with Mare's 42-yard field goal, yet the Colts matched them with Vinatieri's 34-yard field goal.  The Dolphins would get another field goal from Mare as he kicked one from 27 yards out.  In the fourth quarter, Mare and Miami drew closer with a 34-yard field goal, yet Indianapolis ran away with the win as Manning completing a 27-yard TD pass to WR [[Marvin Harrison]].  The Dolphins would get a touchdown as QB [[Cleo Lemon]] completed a 6-yard TD pass to TE [[Randy McMichael]].  However, the Colts' performance showed why they continue to be an elite NFL team.

With the loss, Miami ended its season at 6â10 and unable to make the playoffs, thus they would be denied a chance to play [[Super Bowl XLI]] in their own home stadium.
