'''Zaha Hadid''', [[Order of British Empire|CBE]] ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;Ø²ÙØ§ Ø­Ø¯ÙØ¯&lt;/big&gt;}} ''ZahÄ á¸¤adÄ«d''; born 31 October 1950) is an [[Iraq]]i-[[British people|British]] architect.

==Life and career==
Hadid was born in 1950 in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]]. She received a degree in [[mathematics]] from the [[American University of Beirut]] before moving to study at the [[Architectural Association School of Architecture]] in [[London]]. 

After graduating she worked with her former teachers, [[Rem Koolhaas]] and [[Elia Zenghelis]] at the [[Office for Metropolitan Architecture]], becoming a partner in 1977. It was with [[Rem Koolhaas|Koolhaas]] that she met the engineer [[Peter Rice]] who gave her support and encouragement early on, at a time when her work seemed difficult to build. In 1980 she established her own London-based practice. During the 1980s she also taught at the Architectural Association. She has also taught at prestigious institutions around the world; she held the [[Kenzo Tange]] Chair at the Graduate School of Design, Harvard University, the Sullivan Chair at the [[University of Illinois at Chicago]] School of Architecture, guest professorships at the Hochschule fÃ¼r Bildende KÃ¼nste in Hamburg, the Knowlton School of Architecture, at [[The Ohio State University]], the Masters Studio at Columbia University, New York and the Eero Saarinen Visiting Professor of Architectural Design at the [[Yale School of Architecture]] in New Haven, Connecticut. In addition, she was made Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] and an Honorary [[American Institute of Architects|Fellow of the American Institute of Architects]].&lt;ref name=&quot;AIA&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aia.org/aiaucmp/groups/aia/documents/pdf/aias075757.pdf|title=Convention 2008|last=AIA|publisher=AIA|pages=14|accessdate=2009-05-05}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has been on the Board of Trustees of [[The Architecture Foundation]]. She is currently Professor at the [[University of Applied Arts Vienna]] in Austria.

A winner of many [[Architectural design competition|international competitions]], theoretically influential and groundbreaking, a number of Hadid's winning designs were initially never built: notably, The Peak Club in [[Hong Kong]] (1983) and the [[Cardiff Bay Opera House]] in [[Wales]] (1994). In 2002 Hadid won the international design competition to design Singapore's [[one-north]] masterplan. In 2005, her design won the competition for the new city casino of [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. In 2004 Hadid became the first female recipient of the [[Pritzker Architecture Prize]], architecture's equivalent of the Nobel Prize. Previously, she had been awarded a [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] for services to architecture. She is a member of the editorial board of the ''[[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica]]''. In 2006, Hadid was honored with a retrospective spanning her entire work at the [[Guggenheim Museum in New York]]. In that year she also received an Honorary Degree from the [[American University of Beirut]].

Zaha Hadid's architectural design firm - [[Zaha Hadid Architects]] - is over 350 people strong, headquartered in a Victorian former school building in [[Clerkenwell]], London.

In 2008, she ranked 69th on the [[Forbes]] list of &quot;[[The World's 100 Most Powerful Women]]&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forbes.com/2008/08/27/most-powerful-women-biz-powerwomen08-cz_me_cs_0827women_land.html Forbes: The World's 100 Most Powerful Women]&lt;/ref&gt; On 2 January 2009, she was the guest editor of the [[BBC]]'s flagship morning radio news programme, ''[[Today programme|Today]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/today/hi/today/newsid_7785000/7785759.stm |title=Guest editor: Zaha Hadid |publisher=BBC |date=2008-12-27 |accessdate=2009-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 she was named by Time magazine as  influential thinker in the 2010 TIME 100 issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1984685_1984745,00.html Time 100 - Thinkers : Zaha Hadid]&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2010, The British magazine ''[[New Statesman]]'' listed Zaha Hadid at number 42 in their annual survey of &quot;The World's 50 Most Influential Figures 2010&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;htanna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=42. Zaha Hadid - 50 People Who Matter 2010|url=http://www.newstatesman.com/architecture/2010/09/olympic-starchitect-hadid|publisher=New Statesman|accessdate=12 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She won the [[Stirling Prize]] two years running: in 2010, for one of her most celebrated works, the [[MAXXI â National Museum of the 21st Century Arts|Maxxi]] in [[Rome]], and in 2011 for the Evelyn Grace Academy, a Z-shapes school in [[Brixton]]

Hadid is the designer of the [[Dongdaemun Design Plaza &amp; Park]] in [[Seoul]], [[South Korea]], which is expected to be the centerpiece of the festivities for the city's designation as [[World Design Capital]] 2010. The complex is scheduled to be completed in 2011.

==Non-architectural work==
She has also undertaken some high-profile interior work, including the ''Mind Zone'' and ''Feet zone'' at the [[Millennium Dome]] in London as well as creating fluid furniture installations within the Georgian surrondings of Home House private members club in Marylebone, and the Z.CAR hydrogen-powered, three-wheeled automobile. In 2009, she worked with the clothing brand [[Lacoste]], to create a new, high fashion, and advanced boot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lacoste.com/zahahadid/ Lacoste]&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, she also collaborated with the brassware manufacturer Triflow Concepts&lt;ref&gt;http://www.triflowconcepts.com&lt;/ref&gt; to produce two new designs in her signature parametric architectural style. Her unique contributions to brassware design and other fields continue to push the boundaries of innovation. 

In 2007, Zaha Hadid designed the Moon System Sofa for leading Italian furniture manufacturer [[B&amp;B Italia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bebitalia.it&lt;/ref&gt;
