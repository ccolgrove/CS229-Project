The '''[[VCU Rams]] football team''' is a club team that represents [[Virginia Commonwealth University]] in [[American football|football]]. The club team was founded in 2011, and will play their inagural season this coming fall.

Prior the arrival of a club football team, there has been increasing interest across the VCU community for the Athletic Department to field a varsity football program. Much of the push for a team has come with the foundation of a varsity football team at [[Old Dominion University]], a major rival of VCU, as well as the [[2010â11 VCU Rams men's basketball team|recent success of the VCU Rams men's basketball]] team.

The current club team will be coached by Lamar Bell, and play against nearby Virginia colleges and universities that also do not field varsity level football teams. VCU currently sells a shirt proudly declaring that VCU Football is &quot;Still Undefeated.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=VCU Football Still Undefeated|url=http://www.commonwealthtimes.org/?p=5151|accessdate=September 2, 2011|newspaper=[[The Commonwealth Times]]|date=September 1, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==
During former President [[Eugene P. Trani]]âs administration, he was notable for saying VCU wonât have football âon my watch.â But now that Trani has stepped down and [[Michael Rao]] has filled the vacancy, the debate has sparked once again.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.upiu.com/sports/2010/10/13/VCU-football-Stillin-progress/UPIU-2821286992724/&lt;/ref&gt;

A study was done in 2008 by the VCU Student Government to gauge student interest in football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MyVCU Portal - VCU Football Poll Results|url=http://forums.vcusga.com/t23-myvcu-portal-vcu-football-poll-results|work=VCU Student Government|accessdate=September 2, 2011|date=November 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A total of 8,373 votes were taken and 73% of students agreed that VCU should field a football team. The study also gauged what football could do to VCU's reputation and Alumni participation, finding favorable responses for football in both questions. &lt;ref&gt;http://forums.vcusga.com/t23-myvcu-portal-vcu-football-poll-results&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential locations for a future varsity football team==

===Boulevard Location===
An independent study has been done by VCU Alumni showing potential locations and costs to implementing VCU football.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vcuramfootball.com/&lt;/ref&gt; The study calls for the VCU football stadium to replace the current location of the [[The Diamond (Richmond, Virginia)|Diamond]]. The Diamond will become available when the current tenant, the [[Richmond Flying Squirrels]] move to their new stadium in 2014-2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.timesdispatch.com/sports/flying-squirrels/2011/may/25/tdmain01-squirrels-domino-the-diamond-remains-safe-ar-1062477/&lt;/ref&gt;

===City Stadium Location===
The current location of [[City Stadium (Richmond)|City Stadium]] has been listed numerous times as a potential locations to start VCU football. The location is currently being sought after by VCU Athletics and a potential developer because no tenant currently occupies the stadium. &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.timesdispatch.com/news/2011/may/10/2-city-stadium-studies-possible-ar-1028038/&lt;/ref&gt;
