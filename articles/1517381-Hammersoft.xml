'''ConfederaciÃ³n Sudamericana de Voleibol (CSV)''' or Portuguese '''{{lang|pt|ConfederaÃ§Ã£o Sul-americana de Voleibol}}''' is the continental [[sport governing body|governing body]] for the sport of [[volleyball]] in [[South America]]. Its [[headquarters]] are located in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].

== Profile ==
The CSV's origins are still under dispute. Some argue it was founded in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] on February 12, 1946; some, that it was founded in [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]] on July 3 of the same year. Either way, it was formed even before the [[FIVB]] itself, and stands as the oldest of all volleyball continental confederations.

Up to now (2004), the CSV has had a total of eight presidents, all but one from national federations with some volleyball tradition at a certain point in history: Brazil, Peru, Argentina, Venezuela and Colombia, which is the exception. Following the election of the current president, Brazilian Mr. Ary GraÃ§a Filho, in 2003 the headquarters were relocated from [[Lima]], [[Peru]] to [[Rio de Janeiro]], [[Brazil]].

The CSV presides over national volleyball federations located in South America and organizes continental competitions such as the South American Volleyball Championship (first edition, 1951) and the [[Pan American Games]], sometimes in conjunction with other confederations and with the [[FIVB]]. It also takes part in the organization of qualification tournaments for major events such as the [[Volleyball Olympic Tournament|Olympic Games]] or the [[Volleyball World Championship|World Championship]], and of international competitions hosted by one of its affiliated federations.

== Teams ==
Lately, the only national South American federation with expressive results in international competitions is Brazil, which maintains intensive development programmes for men's and women's volleyball. 
 
Argentina has some tradition in men's volleyball, but it has shown unmistakable signs of decline: in recent years, Venezuela has been constantly threatening to take its long held position as the second volleyball force of the continent. 

With a silver medal at the [[1988 Summer Olympics|Seoul Olympic Games]], Peru had a very strong women's volleyball team in the 1980s. Its level of play has nevertheless dropped to below average after the retirement of superstar players like [[Cecilia Tait]], [[Natalia MÃ¡laga]], [[Rosa GarcÃ­a]] and [[Gabriela PÃ©rez del Solar]]. Nevertheless, Peru is still a respectively good team, and one of the main forces of the continent.

== Affiliated Federations ==
As of 2004, the following national federations were affiliated to the CSV:
