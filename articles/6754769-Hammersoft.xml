'''''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''''', edited by [[August Derleth]] and published by [[Arkham House]] in [[1969 in literature|1969]], is considered the first Cthulhu Mythos anthology. It contained two stories by Lovecraft, a number of reprints of pieces written by members of Lovecraft's circle of correspondents, and several new tales written for the collection by a new generation of Cthulhu Mythos writers.  It was published in an edition of 4,024 copies.

Derleth prefaced the collection with &quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, an outline of his (sometimes controversial) views on the development and content of the Mythos. In this introduction, Derleth prematurely declared the genre to be dead--&quot;for certainly the Mythos as an inspiration for new fiction is hardly likely to afford readers with enough that is new and sufficiently different in execution to create a continuing and growing demand&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;August Derleth, &quot;The Cthulhu Mythos&quot;, ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lin Carter]] later wrote that ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos'' &quot;marked the beginning of a new era in the history of the Mythos for many reasons, and one of the most important was that it introduced a number of new writers in the Mythos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Lin Carter, ''[[Lovecraft: A Look Behind the Cthulhu Mythos]]'', p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Disciples of Cthulhu''''' was edited by Edward P. Berglund and published by [[DAW Books]] in [[1976 in literature|1976]]. Berglund later described it as &quot;the first professional, all-original, Cthulhu Mythos anthology&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P. Berglund, &quot;Preface to the Revised Edition&quot;, ''The Disciples of Cthulhu''.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perhaps responding to the introduction to Derleth's collection, Berglund wrote in his preface: &quot;Whether or not there is a market for the Cthulhu Mythos stories, established and amateur writers will continue to write them for their own and their friends' amusement and enjoyment. It is inevitable that one or more readers of this volume will be influenced into trying his hand at writing within the Cthulhu Mythos genre.&quot;

When the collection was reprinted by [[Chaosium]] in [[1996 in literature|1996]], the Carter and Brennan stories were replaced by &quot;Dope War of the Black Tong&quot;, a new [[Robert M. Price]] [[pastiche]] of Carter and [[Robert E. Howard]], and &quot;Glimpses&quot; by [[A. A. Attanasio]], which was supposed to be published in the original ''Disciples'' but ended up in the Arkham House anthology ''Nameless Places'' instead.

'''''New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''''' was edited by [[Ramsey Campbell]] and published by [[Arkham House]] in [[1980 in literature|1980]] in an edition of 3,647 copies. In his introduction, Campbell noted that &quot;[i]n recent years the Mythos at times has seemed in danger of becoming conventionalized,&quot; despite the fact that &quot;Lovecraft's intention and achievement was precisely to avoid the predictability and resultant lack of terror which beset the conventional macabre fiction of his day.&quot; Therefore, Campbell wrote, &quot;in this anthology I have tended to favor less familiar treatments or uses of the Mythos.... They contain few erudite occultists, decaying towns, or stylistic pastiches.... Indeed, one of our tales hints at the ultimate event of the Mythos without ever referring to the traditional names.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey Campbell, &quot;Introduction&quot;, ''New Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''.&lt;/ref&gt;

One story in the book is an expansion, by Martin S. Warnes, of Lovecraft's fragment &quot;[[The Book (short story)|The Book]]&quot;.

[[Arkham House]] released a new edition of '''''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos''''' in [[1990 in literature|1990]], edited by [[Jim Turner (editor)|James Turner]] with a substantially different selection of stories, reflecting the editor's disdain for &quot;Mythos pastiches in which eccentric [[New England]] recluses utter the right incantations in the wrong books and are promptly eaten by a giant frog named [[Cthulhu]].&quot;  It was released in an edition of 7,015 copies.

Turner eliminates some authors from the earlier edition and uses different contributions from others--while still suggesting that &quot;a few of the earliest pieces in this volume...now seem like pop-cultural [[kitsch]].&quot; The added stories, he writes, are from &quot;the relative handful of successful works that have been influenced by the Cthulhu Mythos...exemplifying the darkly enduring power of H. P. Lovecraft over a disparate group of writers who have made their own inimitable contributions to the Mythos.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;James Turner, &quot;IÃ¤! IÃ¤! Cthulhu Fhtagn!&quot; ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos: Golden Anniversary Anthology''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tales of the Lovecraft Mythos''''' was edited by [[Robert M. Price]] and published by [[Fedogan &amp; Bremer]] in [[1992 in literature|1992]]. In an introduction, Price provides a &quot;sketch of the [[Lovecraft Mythos]] and its evolution into the Cthulhu Mythos&quot;--raising a defense of [[August Derleth]]'s interpretation of the Mythos along the way. Price writes that his intent in making selections was to assemble &quot;an alternate version&quot; of Derleth's ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos'', though limited in scope to the writers of the [[pulp magazine|pulp]] era. He included several pieces long out of print or reprinted only in obscure fanzines, and tried to focus on &quot;stories in which certain important Mythos names or items are either first mentioned or most fully explained by the author who created them&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price, &quot;Introduction&quot;, ''Tales of the Lovecraft Mythos''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Starry Wisdom: A Tribute to H. P. Lovecraft''''' was edited by D. M. Mitchell and published by [[Creation Books]] in [[1994 in literature|1994]]. Declaring that &quot;Lovecraft has suffered much at the hands of unmindful critics and even more from uninspired and talentless imitators,&quot; Mitchell declares that the collection's goal is &quot;to dig deeper, to bypass the superficial and access the subterranean channels of archetype and inspiration with which Lovecraft was connected.... [Lovecraft] crafted morbid and disturbing allegories of social and biological upheaval--cryptically prophetic and spiritually exploratory--this latent content of his work now needs excavating.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;D. M. Mitchell, &quot;Foreword&quot;, ''The Starry Wisdom'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the stories in the collection--notably those by Burroughs and Ballard--were not inspired by Lovecraft, but were seen by Mitchell as sharing his &quot;visions of cosmic alienation&quot;. In those stories that make direct references to the Cthulhu Mythos, they are &quot;used only in passing--in the same informal way in which Lovecraft himself intended.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Cthulhu 2000: A Lovecraftian Anthology''''' was edited by [[Jim Turner (editor)|Jim Turner]] and published by Arkham House in [[1995 in literature|1995]] in an edition of 4,927 copies. As in his earlier collection, Turner criticizes the &quot;latter-day Mythos pastiche&quot; as simply &quot;a banal modern horror story, preceded by the inevitable ''[[Necronomicon]]'' epigraph and indiscriminately interspersed with sesquipedalian deities, ichor-oozing tentacles, sundry eldritch abominations, and then the whole sorry mess rounded off with a cachinnating chorus of &quot;IÃ¤! IÃ¤!&quot;-chanting frogs.&quot; He declares that &quot;the works collected in the present volume are not great Lovecraft stories; they rather are great stories in some way [[Lovecraftian horror|inspired by Lovecraft]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Jim Turner, &quot;Cthulhu 2000&quot;, ''Cthulhu 2000'', p. xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The New Lovecraft Circle''''' was edited by [[Robert M. Price]] and published by [[Fedogan &amp; Bremer]] in [[1996 in literature|1996]] in an edition of 2,000 copies. Presenting the book as a sequel to ''Tales of the Lovecraft Mythos'', which focused on the circle of writers around Lovecraft that were collected in the first half of Derleth's ''Tales of the Cthulhu Mythos'', Price declares that &quot;the present collection means to ape the second half, to commemorate that dawn of a new era of Mythos fiction.&quot; He describes the contents as &quot;little known and seldom seen stories by most of the seven members of the New Lovecraft Circle numbered by [[Lin Carter]] and by other, more recent adepts as well, for the tradition grows. The cult will not be stamped out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Robert M. Price, &quot;Introduction&quot;, ''The New Lovecraft Circle'', p. xvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Children of Cthulhu''''', published by [[Ballantine Books]] in [[2002 in literature|2002]], was edited by [[John Pelan]] and Benjamin Adams. In the introduction, the editors wrote: 

:For this collection, we asked authors to break past the '[if it ain't broke,] don't fix it' mentality and bring Lovecraft's original concepts kicking and screaming into the twenty-first century.... The stories in this collection range from the historical to the futuristic. What they share is each writer's reaction to the vision of H. P. Lovecraft and an affinity for his core concepts.:&lt;ref&gt;John Pelan and Benjamin Adams, &quot;The Call of Lovecraft, ''The Children of Cthulhu'', pp. ix-x.&lt;/ref&gt;

All the stories are original to the volume with the exception of [[Poppy Z. Brite]]'s &quot;Are You Loathsome Tonight?&quot; which originally appeared in her 1998 collection of the same name.

The volume's twist is that the dreaded revival of the fearsome &quot;Great Old Ones&quot; who once ruled the Earth is not a future possibility but an event that has actually come to pass.
