'''e2fsprogs''' (sometimes called the '''e2fs programs''')  is a set of utilities for maintaining the [[ext2]], [[ext3]] and [[ext4]] [[file system]]s. Since those file systems are often the default for [[Linux distribution]]s, it is commonly considered to be essential software.

Included with e2fsprogs are:
* &lt;tt&gt;e2fsck&lt;/tt&gt;, a [[fsck]] program that checks for and corrects inconsistencies
* &lt;tt&gt;mke2fs&lt;/tt&gt;, used for creating ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems
* &lt;tt&gt;resize2fs&lt;/tt&gt;, which can expand and shrink ext2, ext3 and ext4 file systems
* &lt;tt&gt;tune2fs&lt;/tt&gt;, used to modify file system parameters
* &lt;tt&gt;dumpe2fs&lt;/tt&gt;, which prints superblock and block group information.
* &lt;tt&gt;debugfs&lt;/tt&gt;, used to manually view or modify internal structures of the file system

Many of these utilities are based on the &lt;tt&gt;libext2fs&lt;/tt&gt; library.

Despite what its name might suggest, the e2fsprogs work not only with ext2 and ext3 but also with ext4. Although ext3's [[Journaling file system|journaling]] capability can reduce the need to use &lt;tt&gt;e2fsck&lt;/tt&gt;, it is sometimes still necessary to help protect from kernel bugs or bad hardware.

With ext4 the e2fsck runtime should come down considerably.

As the [[userspace]] companion for the ext2, ext3, and ext4 drivers in the [[Linux kernel]], the e2fsprogs are most commonly used with [[GNU]]/[[Linux]]. However, they have been ported to other systems, such as [[FreeBSD]] and [[Darwin (operating system)|Darwin]].
