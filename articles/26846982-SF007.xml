Midget cells originate in the [[ganglion cell layer]] of the [[retina]], and project to the [[parvocellular layer]]s of the [[lateral geniculate nucleus]] (LGN).  The axons of midget cells travel through the [[optic nerve]] and [[optic tract]], ultimately synapsing with [[parvocellular cell]]s in the LGN.  These cells are known as midget retinal ganglion cells due to the small sizes of their [[dendrite|dendritic trees]] and cell bodies.  About 80% of RGCs are midget cells.  They receive inputs from relatively few rods and cones. In many cases, they are connected to midget [[Bipolar cell of the retina|bipolar cells]], which are linked to one cone each.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;eye, human.&quot;EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica. 2008. [[EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica 2006 Ultimate Reference Suite DVD]] &lt;/ref&gt;  They have slow [[conduction velocity]], and respond to changes in color but respond only weakly to changes in contrast unless the change is great.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Neural Science 4th Ed. Kandel et al.&lt;/ref&gt;  They have simple center-surround [[receptive fields]], where the center may be either ON or OFF while the surround is the opposite.
