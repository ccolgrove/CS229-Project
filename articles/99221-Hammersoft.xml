'''World government''' is the notion of a single common [[political]] authority for all of humanity. Its modern conception is rooted in [[European history]], particularly in the [[philosophy]] of [[ancient Greece]], in the political formation of the [[Roman Empire]], and in the subsequent struggle between [[secular]] authority, represented by the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[ecclesiastical authority]], represented by the [[Pope]]. The seminal work on the subject was written by [[Dante Alighieri]], titled in [[Latin]], ''[[De Monarchia]],'' which in English translates literally as &quot;[[Monarchy|On Monarchy]]&quot;. Dante's work was published in 1329, but the date of its authorship is disputed.

=== Hugo Grotius ===
{{Main|Hugo Grotius}}
[[File:381px-Grotius de jure 1631.jpg|thumb|150px|left|De jure belli ac pacis, title page from the second edition of 1631.]]
''De jure belli ac pacis'' (On the Law of War and Peace) is a 1625 book in Latin, written by [[Hugo Grotius]] and published in Paris, on the legal status of war. It is now regarded as a foundational work in [[international law]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.library.usyd.edu.au/libraries/rare/modernity/grotius.html USYD.edu.au]&lt;/ref&gt;  Grotius was born April 10, 1583.  He was a philosopher, theologian, play writer, and poet.  Grotius is known for coming up with the idea of having an international law, and is still acknowledged today by the American society of International Law.  Hugo was the first child of Jan de Groot and Alida van Overschie.  He was exiled from many countries, though many people had great respect for him.

===Immanuel Kant===
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|right|Painted portrait of [[Immanuel Kant]].]]
[[Immanuel Kant]] wrote the essay &quot;[[Perpetual Peace]]: A Philosophical Sketch ([[:de:Zum ewigen Frieden|Zum ewigen Frieden. Ein philosophischer Entwurf.]]) (1795)&quot;. In his essay, Kant describes three basic requirements for organizing human affairs to permanently abolish the threat of present and future war, and, thereby, help establish a new era of lasting peace throughout the world. Specifically, Kant described his proposed peace program as containing two steps.  

The &quot;Preliminary Articles&quot; described the steps that should be taken immediately, or with all deliberate speed:

#&quot;No Secret Treaty of Peace Shall Be Held Valid in Which There Is Tacitly Reserved Matter for a Future War&quot;
#&quot;No Independent States, Large or Small, Shall Come under the Dominion of Another State by Inheritance, Exchange, Purchase, or Donation&quot;
#&quot;[[Standing army|Standing Armies]] Shall in Time Be Totally Abolished&quot;
#&quot;National Debts Shall Not Be Contracted with a View to the External Friction of States&quot;
#&quot;No State Shall by Force Interfere with the Constitution or Government of Another State&quot;
#&quot;No State Shall, during War, Permit Such Acts of Hostility Which Would Make Mutual Confidence in the Subsequent Peace Impossible: Such Are the Employment of Assassins (percussores), Poisoners (venefici), Breach of Capitulation, and Incitement to Treason (perduellio) in the Opposing State&quot;

Three Definitive Articles  would provide not merely a cessation of hostilities, but a foundation on which to build a peace. 
#&quot;The Civil Constitution of Every State Should Be Republican&quot;
#&quot;The Law of Nations Shall be Founded on a Federation of Free States&quot;
#&quot;The Law of World Citizenship Shall Be Limited to Conditions of Universal Hospitality&quot;

===Karl Krause===
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}
In 1811, German philosopher [[Karl Krause]], suggested, in an essay titled &quot;The Archetype of Humanity&quot;, the formation of five regional federations: Europe, Asia, Africa, America and Australia, aggregated under a world [[republic]]. In 1842, the English poet Lord [[Alfred Tennyson]], published the oft-quoted lines &quot;[[Locksley Hall]]&quot;: ''For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see / Saw a Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be /... / Till the war-drum throbb'd no longer / and the battle-flags were furled / In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. / There the common sense of most shall hold / a fretful realm in awe / And the kindly earth shall slumber / lapt in universal law''.

[[Ulysses S. Grant]] commented, &quot;I believe at some future day, the nations of the earth will agree on some sort of congress which will take cognizance of international questions of difficulty and whose decisions will be as binding as the decisions of the Supreme Court are upon us.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Schwartzberg |first= Joseph E. |authorlink= Joseph E.

[[Wendell Wilkie]] expanded on this notion in his book ''[[One World (book)|One World]]''.

===Harry Truman===

U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] commented: &quot;We must make the United Nations continue to work, and to be a going concern, to see that difficulties between nations may be settled just as we settle difficulties between States here in the United States. When Kansas and Colorado fall out over the waters in the Arkansas River, they don't go to war over it, they go to the Supreme Court of the United States, and the matter is settled in a just and honorable way. There is not a difficulty in the whole world that cannot be settled in exactly the same way in a world court.&quot;  -- President Truman's remarks in Omaha, Nebraska on June 5, 1948, at the dedication of the [[Memorial Park (Omaha)|War Memorial]].&lt;ref&gt;Public Papers, Harry S.

===International Peace Congress===
{{Main|International Peace Congress}}
{{Expand section|date=October 2009}}

Starting in 1843, [[International Peace Congress]]es were held in [[Europe]] every two years, but lost their momentum after 1853 due to the renewed outbreak of wars in Europe ([[Crimea]]) and North America ([[American Civil War]]).

===International organizations===
{{Main|International organizations}}

[[File:Emblem of the ICRC.svg|thumb|150px|Emblem of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]]]

International organizations started forming in the late 19th century â the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] in 1863, the [[Telegraphic Union]] in 1865 and the [[Universal Postal Union]] in 1874. The increase in international trade at the turn of the 20th century accelerated the formation of international organizations, and, by the start of [[World War I]] in 1914, there were approximately 450 of them. Support for the idea of establishing international law grew during that period as well. The [[Institute of International Law]] was formed in 1873 by the Belgian Jurist [[Gustave Rolin-Jaequemyns]], leading to the creation of concrete legal drafts, for example by the Swiss [[Johaan Bluntschli]] in 1866.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} In 1883, [[James Lorimer (jurist)|James Lorimer]] published &quot;The Institutes of the Law of Nations&quot; in which he explored the idea of a world government establishing the global rule of law. The first embryonic world [[parliament]], called the [[Inter-Parliamentary Union]], was organized in 1886 by Cremer and Passy, composed of legislators from many countries. In 1904 the Union formally proposed &quot;an international congress which should meet periodically to discuss international questions&quot;.

=== League of Nations ===

{{Main|League of Nations}}
{{Main|Fourteen Points}}

The [[League of Nations]] (LoN) was an inter-governmental organization founded as a result of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919â1920. At its greatest extent from 28 September 1934 to 23 February 1935, it had 58 members. The League's goals included upholding the new found [[Rights of Man]] such as right of non whites, rights of women, rights of soldiers, [[arms control|disarmament]], preventing war through [[collective security]], settling disputes between countries through negotiation, [[diplomacy]] and improving global [[quality of life]]. The diplomatic philosophy behind the League represented a fundamental shift in thought from the preceding hundred years. The League lacked its own armed force and so depended on the [[Great power|Great Powers]] to enforce its resolutions, keep to economic sanctions which the League ordered, or provide an army, when needed, for the League to use. However, they were often reluctant to do so.  Lacking many key elements in maintaining world peace, the League of Nations failed to prevent World War II.  Hitler withdrew Germany from the League of Nations once he planned to take over Europe.  The rest of the Axis powers soon followed him.  Having failed its primary goal, the League of Nations fell apart and eventually was recreated into the United Nations.  The main parts of the League of Nations included the Assembly, the Council, and the Permanent Secretariat.  Under these main parts there were many subgroups or agencies.  The Assembly was where all member states came together. Each country was allowed three representatives and one vote.

=== Nazi Germany ===
{{See|New Order (Nazism)|Lebensraum}}
The ruling [[Nazi Party]] of 1933-1945 [[Germany]] envisaged the ultimate establishment of a world government under the complete [[hegemony]] of the [[Third Reich]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg&quot;&gt;Weinberg, Gerhard L.

The lower races will have to restrict themselves accordingly.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Weinberg&quot;/&gt;

=== Atlantic Charter ===
[[Image:Atlanticcharter2.gif|thumb|right|150px|Winston Churchill's edited copy of the final draft of the Atlantic Charter.]]
{{Main|Atlantic Charter}}
The [[Atlantic Charter]] was a published statement agreed between [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and the [[United States of America]]. It was intended as the blueprint for the postwar world after [[World War II]], and turned out to be the foundation for many of the international agreements that currently shape the world. The [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the post-war independence of British and French possessions, and much more are derived from the Atlantic Charter.  The Atlantic charter was made to show the goals of the allied powers during World War II.  It first started with The United States and Great Britain, and later all the allies would follow the charter.  Some goals include access to raw materials, reduction of trade restrictions, and freedom from fear and wants.  The name, The Atlantic Charter, came from a newspaper that coined the title.  However, Winston Churchill would use it, and from then on the Atlantic Charter was the official name.  In retaliation, the Axis powers would raise their morale and try to work their way into Great Britain.  The Atlantic Charter was a stepping stone into the creation of the United Nations.

===United Nations===
{{Main|United Nations}}
[[File:Emblem of the United Nations.svg|thumb|left|150px|Emblem of the [[United Nations]]]]
[[World War II]], 1939â1945, resulted in an unprecedented scale of destruction of lives (over 60 million dead, most of them civilians), and the use of [[Weapons of Mass Destruction]]. Some of the acts committed against civilians during the war were on such a massive scale of savagery, they came to be widely considered as [[crimes against humanity]] itself. As the war's conclusion drew near, many shocked voices called for the establishment of institutions able to permanently prevent deadly international conflicts. This led to the founding of the [[United Nations]] in 1945, which adopted the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] in 1948. Many, however, felt that the UN, essentially a forum for discussion and coordination between [[sovereignty|sovereign]] governments, was insufficiently empowered for the task. A number of prominent persons, such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Winston Churchill]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Mohandas K. Gandhi]], called on governments to proceed further by taking gradual steps towards forming an effectual federal world government. The United Nations main goal is to work on international law, international security, economic development, human rights, social progress, and eventually world peace. The United Nations replaced the League of Nations in 1945, after World War II.  Nearly every country is in the U.N., 193 member states. The United Nations gather regularly in order to solve big problems throughout the world.  There are six official languages: Arabic, English, Spanish, Russian, French, and Chinese.  The United Nations is also financed by some of the wealthiest nations.  The flag shows the Earth from a map that shows all of the occupied continents.

=== World Federalist Movement ===
{{Main|World Federalist Movement}}
The years between the conclusion of World War II and 1950, when the [[Korean War]] started and the [[Cold War]] mindset became dominant in international politics, were the &quot;golden age&quot; of the world federalist movement. [[Wendell Wilkie]]'s book [[One World (book)|&quot;One World&quot;]], first published in 1943, sold over 2 million copies. In another, [[Emery Reves]]' book &quot;[[The Anatomy of Peace]]&quot;(1945) laid out the arguments for replacing the UN with a federal world government and quickly became the &quot;bible&quot; of world federalists. The grassroots world federalist movement in the US, led by people such as [[Grenville Clark]], [[Norman Cousins]], [[Alan Cranston]] and [[Robert Hutchins]], organized itself into increasingly larger structures, finally forming, in 1947, the [[United World Federalists]] (later renamed to World Federalist Association, then [[Citizens for Global Solutions]]), claiming membership of 47,000 in 1949.

Similar movements concurrently formed in many other countries, leading to the formation, at a 1947 meeting in Montreux, Switzerland, of a global coalition, now called World Federalist Movement. By 1950, the movement claimed 56 member groups in 22 countries, with some 156,000 members.

=== Garry Davis ===

In France, 1948, [[Garry Davis]] began an unauthorized speech calling for a world government from the balcony of the UN General Assembly, until he was dragged away by the guards. Mr. Davis renounced his American citizenship and started a [[Registry of World Citizens]], which claimed to have registered over 750,000 people in less than two years. Opinion polls carried out by [[UNESCO]] in 1948-1949 found world government favored by a majority of respondents in six European countries and rejected in three other countries (Australia, Mexico and the United States).{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} On September 4, 1953, Davis, from the City Hall of Ellsworth, Maine, announced the formation of the &quot;World Government of World Citizens&quot; based on 3 &quot;World Laws&quot; â One God (or Absolute Value), One World, and One Humanity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldservice.org/ells.html Worldservice.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Following this declaration mandated he claimed by article 21(3) of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, he formed the United World Service Authority in New York City as the administrative agency of the new government. Its first task was to design and issue a &quot;World Passport&quot; based on article 13(2) of the UDHR. To date, over 800,000 of these documents have been issued to individuals worldwide. They have been recognized de facto by over 180 countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldgovernment.org/visas.html?s=1 Worldgovernment.org], Copies of visas&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Passport (1953) ===

{{Main|World Passport}}

The World Passport is a 45 page document issued by the [[World Service Authority]], a non-profit organization,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.romingerlegal.com/tenthcircuit/10th_circuit/99-1334.htm Romingerlegal.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;], 99-1334 - U.S. v. THOMAS - 07/07/2000&lt;/ref&gt; citing Article 13, Section 2, of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]. World Passports have reportedly been accepted on a ''de facto'', case-by-case basis by over 174 countries and, at one time or another, on an explicit, legal or ''de jure'' basis by [[Burkina Faso]], [[Ecuador]], [[Mauritania]], [[Tanzania]], [[Togo]] and [[Zambia]]. The latest edition of the World Passport, issued January 2007, is an MRD (machine readable document) with an alphanumeric code bar enabling computer input plus an embedded &quot;ghost&quot; photo for security, printing overcovered with a plastic film. The passport is in 7 languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic]], [[Mandarin Chinese|Chinese]] and [[Esperanto]]. Two covers are available: &quot;World Passport,&quot; and &quot;World Government Passport&quot; (for registered World Citizens), (&quot;passport&quot; is in 7 languages on both covers). Duration is 8 years, 5 years or 3 years. Other documents issued by WSA are a World Birth Certificate (Art. 1, UDHR), a World Political Asylum Card (Art. 14, UDHR), a World Marriage Certificate, (Art. 16, UDHR) and a World Identity Card, (Art 21,3, UDHR). Each passport is numbered and each page has the World Citizen logo in the background.  There are two pages for affiliation with companies, organizations, and firms.  There are nineteen visa pages in the passport.  In the back cover there are spaces for personal information such as a personâs home address.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldservice.org/docpass.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal Realism (1954) ===
{{Main|E. Adamson Hoebel}}

Legal anthropologist [[E. Adamson Hoebel]] concluded his treatise on broadening the legal realist tradition to include non-Western nations&lt;ref&gt;''The Law of Primitive Man'' (1954:331-333)&lt;/ref&gt;: âWhatever the idealist may desire, force and the threat of force are the ultimate power in the determination of international behavior, as in the law within the nation or tribe. But until force and the threat of force in international relations are brought under social control by the world community, by and for the world society, they remain the instruments of social anarchy and not the sanctions of world law. The creation in clear-cut terms of the corpus of world law cries for the doing. If world law, however, is to be realized at all, there will have to be minimum of general agreement as to the nature of the physical and ideational world and the relation of men in society to it. An important and valuable next step will be found in deep-cutting analysis of the major law systems of the contemporary world in order to lay bare their basic postulates â postulates that are too generally hidden; postulates felt, perhaps, by those who live by them, but so much taken for granted that they are rarely expressed or exposed for examination. When this is done â and it will take the efforts of many keen intellects steeped in the law of at least a dozen lands and also aware of the social nexus of the law â then mankind will be able to see clearly for the first time and clearly where the common consensus of the great living social and law systems lies. Here will be found the common postulates and values upon which the world community can build. At the same time the truly basic points of conflict that will have to be worked upon for resolution will be revealed. Law is inherently purposive.&quot;

=== The end of the Cold War (1991) ===

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Worldpass.png|thumb|[[World Passport]]]] --&gt;

While enthusiasm for multinational federalism in Europe incrementally led, over the following decades, to the formation of the [[European Union]], the onset of the [[Cold War]] (1946â1991) eliminated the prospects of any progress towards federation with a more global scope. The movement quickly shrunk in size to a much smaller core of activists, and the FWG idea all but disappeared from wide public discourse.

Following the dissolution of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, interest in a federal world government and, more generally, in the global protection of human rights, was renewed. The most visible achievement of the world federalism movement during the 1990s is the [[Rome Statute]] of 1998, which led to the establishment of the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2002. In [[Europe]], progress towards forming a federal union of European states gained much momentum, starting in 1952 as a trade deal between the German and French people lead, in 1992, to the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that established the name and enlarged the agreement that the [[European Union]] (EU) is based upon. The EU expanded (1995, 2004, 2007) to encompass, in 2007, nearly half a billion people in 27 member states. Following EU's example, the [[African Union]] was founded in 2002 and the [[Union of South American Nations]] in 2004.

===Caliphate===
{{main|Caliphate|Islamism|Islamic revival}}

Historically, the Caliphate was established by the followers of the prophet Muhammad in Medina after his death in 632. Abu Bakr who was the closest associate of the prophet was selected as the first Caliph or Deputy; hence the term Caliphate.  Abu Bakr called himself the prophet's deputy and the leader of Muslims. He and the three Caliphs selected after him shunned any pretensions to royalty but later on ruling dynasties came into existence  and ruled until the end of the Ottoman Caliphate that came  after its defeat in the First World War along with Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire by, inter alia, Britain, France and Russia in 1918.  During the intervening centuries, Islamic Caliphate's authority expanded to encompass regions in Europe, Middle East, South Asia, Central Asia and northern Africa. These territories were ruled under Islamic law. The Caliphate was abolished by the Turkish National Assembly under Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk in 1924. 
In the modern era, many Islamic organizations such as [[Hizb ut Tahrir]], the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], [[Al Qaidah]], the [[Taliban]] and [[Al-Shabaab]] have attempted to re-establish an Islamic state.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;The majority of early scholars, holds that Muslims should prepare power, mobilize armies, head towards the opponentsâ countries, and, before fighting them, offer them a choice between allowing the preaching of Islam, paying the Jizyah (head-tax), if they were entitled to paying it, or fighting... The reason given  by these scholare for their views was Allah's saying: âAnd fight them until there is no temptation, and the religion is for Allah.â (Qur'an 2:193). -[http://www.islambasics.com/view.php?bkID=51&amp;chapter=5 ''The Rulings of SharÃ®âah Relating to Muslims living in non-Muslim Countries'' Chapter 2], Khalid Muhammad Abdul Qadir, Beirut, Lebanon, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Existing regional unions of nations==

{{Main|Regional organization}}
{{Main|Supranational union}}
[[File:Supranational unions.svg|thumb|400px|right|A global map showing some supranational unions.]]

The only union generally recognized as having achieved the status of a supranational union is the [[European Union]].&lt;ref name=&quot;BaubÃ¶ck-2007&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|last= BaubÃ¶ck| first=Rainer|year= 2007|title= Why European Citizenship?

There are a number of other regional organisations that, while not supranational unions, have adopted or intend to adopt policies that may lead to a similar sort of integration in some respects.

* [[African Union]] (AU)
* [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN)
* [[Central American Integration System]] (SICA)
* [[Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf]] (CCASG)
* [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] (CIS)
* [[Eurasian Economic Community]] (EurAsEC)
* [[South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation]] (SAARC)
* [[Union of South American Nations]] (UNASUR)
* [[Union State]]
* [[Arab League]]
* [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM)
* [[Turkic Council]] (TurkKon)

Other organisations that have also discussed greater integration include:

* [[Arab League]] into an &quot;[[Arab Union]]&quot;
* [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) into the &quot;[[North American Union]]&quot;
* [[Pacific Islands Forum]] into the &quot;[[Pacific Union]]&quot;
* [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM) into a Caribbean Federation

===European Union===
[[File:Locator European Union.svg|thumb|120px|right|Map of EU nations.]]

The most relevant model for the incremental establishment of a global federation may be the [[European Union]], which politically unites a large group of widely diverse, some formerly hostile, nations spread over a large geographical area and 500 million people. Though the EU is still evolving, it already has many attributes of a federal government, such as open internal borders, a directly elected parliament, a court system, an official currency ([[Euro]]) and a centralized economic policy.

The EU's lead is being followed by the [[African Union]], the [[Union of South American Nations]], the [[Organization of Central American States]], and the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]]. A multitude of [[trade bloc|regional associations]], aggregating most nations of the world, are at different stages of development towards a growing extent of economic, and sometimes political, integration.The European Union consists of twenty seven European states.  It has developed a âsingle marketâ which allows people of different countries to travel from state to state without a passport.  This also includes the same policies when it comes to trading.  The European Union is said to have 26% of the worlds money.  All EU member states do not use the Euro such as the United Kingdom which retains the pound Sterling.  Where the Euro is in place, it allows easy access for the free circulation of trade goods.  Tariffs are also the same for each country allowing no unfair practices within the union.  With the free movement from country to country, this allows people to travel easily and freely.

===CARICOM===
[[File:CARICOM Map 2010-2.png|thumb|150px|right|Map of CARICOM nations.]]

The [[Caribbean Community]] (CARICOM), is an organization of 15 Caribbean nations and dependencies. CARICOM's main purpose is to promote economic integration and cooperation among its members, to ensure that the benefits of integration are equitably shared and to coordinate foreign policy.[1] Its major activities involve coordinating economic policies and development planning; devising and instituting special projects for the less-developed countries within its jurisdiction; operating as a regional single market for many of its members [[CARICOM Single Market and Economy]] (CSME); and handling regional trade disputes.

Since the establishment of CARICOM by the mainly English Creole-speaking parts of the Caribbean region CARICOM has become multilingual in practice with the addition of Dutch speaking [[Suriname]] on 4 July 1995 (although the lingua franca in Suriname is Sranan Tongo, which is an English-based Creole like the languages spoken in much of the rest of CARICOM) and [[Haiti]], where French and Haitian Creole are spoken, on 2 July 2002. In 2001, the heads of government signed a Revised [[Treaty of Chaguaramas]] in [[Trinidad and Tobago]], clearing the way for the transformation of the idea for a [[Common Market]] aspect of CARICOM into instead a Caribbean Single Market and Economy. Part of the revised treaty among member states includes the establishment and implementation of the [[Caribbean Court of Justice]] (CCJ).

===African Union===
[[File:African Union (orthographic projection).svg|thumb|left|150px|right|Map of AU nations.]]

The [[African Union]] (AU) is an organisation consisting of fifty-four [[Africa]]n states. Established on July 9, 2002, the AU was formed as a successor to the amalgamated [[African Economic Community]] (AEC) and the [[Organisation of African Unity]] (OAU). Eventually, the AU aims to have a single currency and a single integrated defence force, as well as other institutions of state, including a cabinet for the AU Head of State. The purpose of the union is to help secure Africa's [[democracy]], [[human rights]], and a [[Economy of Africa|sustainable economy]], especially by bringing an end to intra-African conflict and creating an effective common market.

Projects for improved economic and political cooperation are also happening at a regional level with the [[Arab Maghreb Union]], the [[Economic Community of West African States]], the [[Economic Community of Central African States]] the [[Southern African Development Community]] and the [[East African Community]].

[[File:Commonwealth of Independent States.svg|thumb|left|250px|right|Map of CIS nations and observers.]]

The [[Commonwealth of Independent States]] is comparable to a [[confederation]] similar to the original [[European Community]]. Although the CIS has few supranational powers, it is more than a purely symbolic organization, possessing coordinating powers in the realm of trade, finance, lawmaking, and security.  It has also promoted cooperation on [[democratization]] and cross-border [[crime prevention]]. As a regional organization, CIS participates in [[Peacekeeping|UN peacekeeping forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{PDFlink|[http://www.un.org/Depts/dpko/lessons/Regional%20Organizations.pdf Regional organizations in UN peacekeeping activities]|354&amp;nbsp;KB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of the CIS have established the [[Eurasian Economic Community]] with the aim of creating a full-fledged [[common market]].

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) is an [[international organisation]] with a permanent delegation to the [[United Nations]]. It groups 57 member states, from the [[Middle East]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]], [[Caucasus]], [[Balkans]], [[Southeast Asia]] and [[South Asia]]. The organization claims that it represents the Global Islamic World (ummah).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52 &quot;The Organization has the singular honor to galvanize the Ummah into a unified body and have actively represented the Muslims by espousing all causes close to the hearts of over 1.5 billion Muslims of the world.&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt; The official languages of the organisation are [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]].

Since the nineteenth century, many [[Muslims]] had aspired to uniting the Muslim ''[[ummah]]'' to serve their common political, economic, and social interests. Despite the presence of secularist, nationalist, and socialist ideologies in modern Muslim states, they have cooperated together to form the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation. The formation of the OIC happened in the backdrop of the loss of Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem. The final cause sufficiently compelled leaders of Muslim nations to meet in Rabat to establish the OIC on September 25, 1969.&lt;ref name = EIMW&gt;http://www.oic-oci.org/page_detail.asp?p_id=52&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its charter, the OIC aims to preserve Islamic social and economic values; promote solidarity amongst member states; increase cooperation in social, economic, cultural, scientific, and political areas; uphold international peace and security; and advance education, particularly in the fields of science and technology.&lt;ref name = EIMW/&gt;

The former flag of the OIC (shown on the right) has an overall green background (symbolic of [[Islam]]). In the centre, there is an upward-facing red [[crescent]] enveloped in a white disc. On the disc the words &quot;[[Takbir|Allahu Akbar]]&quot; (Arabic for &quot;God is great&quot;) are written in Arabic calligraphy.

On August 5, 1990, 45 foreign ministers of the OIC adopted the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]] to serve as a guidance for the member states in the matters of human rights in as much as they are compatible with the [[Sharia]], or Quranic Law.&lt;ref name = CDHRII&gt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/instree/cairodeclaration.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkic Council===
[[File:Conseilturcique.svg|thumb|200px|left|{{legend|#00a8a6|Official members.}}{{legend|#4fa6cf|Future members.}}{{Legend|#4fa62e|[[Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus]], which is only recognized as an independent state by Turkey.}}]]

The [[Turkic Council]] is an international organization comprising Turkic countries. Since 1992, the ''Turkic Language Speaking Countries Summit'' has been organizing amongst the Turkic countries. On October 3, 2009, four of these countries signed the Nahcivan Agreement. The organizational center is [[Ä°stanbul]]. Additionally, the [[Joint Administration of Turkic Arts and Culture]] was founded in [[Almaty]] in 1992 and the ''Turkic Countries Parliamentarian Assembly'' was founded in [[Baku]] in 1998. All of these organizations were coopted into the Turkic Council. The Turkic Council has an operational style similar to organization like the [[Arab League]]. The member countries are [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]] and [[Turkey]]. The remaining two Turkic states, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan are not currently official members of the council. However, due to their neutral stance, they participate in international relations and are strongly predicted to be future members of the council. The idea of setting up this cooperative council was first put forward by Kazakh President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] back in 2006.

===The World Constitution and Parliament Association===
The [[World Constitution and Parliament Association]] (WCPA) was created in 1958 to promote democratic world government. During the next 33 years the WCPA held four Global Constituent Assemblies centered around creating a Constitution for the Federation of Earth.  At the fourth assembly in Troia, Portugal in 1991, final amendments to the Constitution were made and approved. Even before this assembly, the organization has been involved in a worldwide campaign to ratify the Earth Constitution under the provisions set forth in Article 17. Since 1982, the WCPA has also organized sessions of the Provisional World Parliament, the first of which was in Brighton, England and the tenth session of which was in Kara, Togo in 2007.  Under the authority of Article 19 of the Constitution, the Parliament debates and passes provisional world legislation that serves as a model and a guide for developing democratic world government. The Parliament also works toward a founding ratification convention at which the nations and people of Earth join together to ratify the Constitution and initiate a new demilitarized, democratic world order.

==United Nations Parliamentary Assembly==
[[File:Uno unpalogo.svg|thumb|250px|right|[[United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] emblem]]

{{Main|United Nations Parliamentary Assembly}}

A United Nations Parliamentary Assembly (UNPA) is a proposed addition to the [[United Nations System]] that would allow for participation of member nations' legislators and, eventually, [[direct election]] of [[United Nations]] (UN) parliament members by citizens worldwide. The idea was raised at the founding of the [[League of Nations]] in the 1920s and again following the end of World War II in 1945, but remained dormant throughout the [[Cold War]]. In the 1990s and 2000s, the rise of global trade and the power of world organizations that govern it led to calls for a [[parliamentary assembly]] to scrutinize their activity.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrossPartyCoalition&quot;&gt;Watson, Graham (26 September 2007). [http://www.grahamwatsonmep.org/news/000423/the_case_for_global_democracy_cross_party_coalition_of_meps_calls_for_a_un_parliamentary_assembly.html The Case for Global Democracy: Cross Party Coalition of MEPs calls for a UN Parliamentary Assembly]. Graham Watson MEP. Retrieved on 7 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Campaign for the Establishment of a United Nations Parliamentary Assembly]] was formed in 2007 to coordinate pro-UNPA efforts, which as of February 2009 has received the support of over 600 [[Member of Parliament|Members of Parliament]] from over 90 countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.unpacampaign.org/news/335.php UNPAcampaign.org], Over 600 MPs support call for UN Parliamentary Assembly - 4 February 2009, CEUNPA&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2011}}, there is no functioning global international [[military]], [[Executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature]], [[judiciary]], or [[constitution]], with jurisdiction over the entire planet.

The Earth is divided geographically and demographically into mutually-exclusive territories and political structures called [[Sovereign state|states]] which are [[Independence|independent]] and [[sovereignty|sovereign]] in most cases. One may also make the case that political and economic independence, although related, are not the same, and even though former colonies have acquired political independence since World War II, they have become more dependent upon each other financially. There are numerous bodies, institutions, unions, coalitions, agreements and contracts between these units of [[authority]], but, except in cases where a nation is under military occupation by another, ''all'' such arrangements depend on the continued consent of the participant nations. Thus the use of [[violence]] is unprohibited throughout the realm and is only checked by the threat of retaliatory violence or nonviolent sanctions (see [[Gene Sharp]]), so where no such threat exists a nation may use violence against another.

Among the voluntary organizations and international arrangements the following are:
* The [[United Nations]] (UN) is the primary formal organization coordinating activities between states on a global scale and the only inter-governmental organization with a truly universal membership (193 governments). In addition to the main organs and various humanitarian programs and commissions of the UN itself, there are about 20 functional organizations affiliated with the UN's Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC), such as the [[World Health Organization]], the [[International Labour Organization]], and [[International Telecommunications Union]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.un.org/aboutun/chartlg.html UN.org], Chart&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular interest politically are the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] and the [[World Trade Organization]].
* The [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF), were [[United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference|formed]] together at the [[Mount Washington Hotel]] in [[Bretton Woods, New Hampshire]], [[United States]] in July 1944, to foster global monetary cooperation and to fight poverty by financially assisting states in need. The [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) sets the rules of international trade. It already has a semi-legislative body (The General Council, reaching decisions by consensus), and a judicial body (The Dispute Settlement Body). Another influential economical international organization is the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), with membership of 30 democratic members.
* [[G8]], an association of the eight highest [[GDP]] Nations of the World. The leaders of the G8 countries meet annually in person to coordinate their policies in confronting global issues, such as poverty, terrorism, infectious diseases, and climate change.
* [[G20]], an association of twenty developing and established nations and entities, including the European Union.
* Militarily, the UN deploys [[peacekeeping]] forces, usually to build and maintain post-conflict peace and stability. When a more aggressive international military action is undertaken, either ad-hoc coalitions (e.g., [[multinational force in Iraq]]), or regional [[military alliance]]s (e.g., [[NATO]]) are used.
* [[International law]] encompasses international treaties, customs, and globally acceptable legal principles. With the exceptions of cases brought before the ICC and ICJ (see below), the laws are interpreted by national courts. Many violations of treaty or customary law obligations are overlooked.
* The [[International Court of Justice]] (ICJ) (also known as World Court) is the judiciary organ of the [[United Nations]]. It settles disputes submitted to it voluntarily by states (only), and gives advisory opinions on legal questions submitted to it by other organs of the UN, such as the General Assembly or Security Council.

A recent development in [[international law]] is the [[International Criminal Court]] (ICC), the first ever permanent international criminal court, which was established to ensure that the gravest international crimes do not go unpunished. The [[Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court|ICC treaty]] was signed by 139 national governments, of which 100 ratified it into law by October 2005.

In addition to the formal, or semi-formal, international organizations and laws mentioned above, many other mechanisms act to regulate human activities across national borders. In particular, international trade in goods, services and currencies (the &quot;[[global market]]&quot;) has a tremendous impact on the lives of people in almost all parts of the world, creating deep interdependency amongst nations (see [[globalization]]). Trans-national (or multi-national) [[corporations]], some with resources exceeding those available to most governments, govern activities of people on a global scale. The rapid increase in the volume of trans-border digital communications and mass-media distribution (e.g., [[Internet]], [[satellite television]]) has allowed information, ideas, and opinions to rapidly spread across the world, creating a complex web of international coordination and influence, mostly outside the control of any formal organizations or laws.
