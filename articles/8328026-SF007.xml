The '''Classmate PC''', formerly known as '''Eduwise''', is [[Intel]]'s entry into the market for low-cost [[personal computer]]s for children in the developing world. It is in some respects similar to the [[One Laptop Per Child]] (OLPC) [[trade association]]'s [[Children's Machine]] (XO), which has a similar target market. Although made for profit, the production of the Classmate PC is considered an [[Information and Communication Technologies for Development]] project. The device falls into the newly defined category of [[netbook]]s.

==Intel World Ahead Program==
Intelâs World Ahead Program was established May 2006. The program designed a platform for low cost laptops that third party manufacturers could use to produce low cost machines under their own respective brands.

The Classmate PC is a reference design by Intel. Intel does not build the subnotebooks, but does produce the chips that power them. The reference design is then used by [[original equipment manufacturers|original equipment manufacturers (OEMs)]] worldwide to build their own branded Classmate PC.

==Technology==
Lenovo and Intel launched a new Classmate PC&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=DeCarlo|first=Matthew|title=Lenovo launches Classmate+ academic notebook|url=http://www.techspot.com/news/42768-lenovo-launches-classmate-academic-notebook.html|accessdate=21 October 2011|newspaper=Tech Spot|date=10 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2011.

Intel has had various partners with its iterations of the Classmate PC. Recently, the company has signed up Lenovo as a partner for the latest model, the Classmate+ PC. Reviews of the machine say that it's faster and more tamper proof&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dawson|first=Christopher|title=Classmate PC: Faster, stronger, more|url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/intel-unveils-tablet-classmate-pc-design/261656?tag=btxcsim|publisher=ZD Net|accessdate=21 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; .

The Lenovo carry handle is firmly in place at the back of the Classmate+ PC and it's powered by one of Intel's Atom processors, in this case a single core 1.6GHz Atom N455 which is paired with Intel's NM10 chipset.

It will also come with up to 2GB of RAM, a standard netbook style 10.1-inch LCD screen, an option of either an 8 or 16GB SSD or a 160 or 250GB hard drive. Other features include 802.11b/g/n Wi-Fi, 10/100Mbit Ethernet, a 1.3Megapixel webcam, three USB 2.0 ports, a memory card reader, a D-sub connector and a pair of audio jacks.

Lenovo will supply three different battery packs for the Classmate+ PC, a standard 3-cell unit which is said to deliver 3-3.5h battery life depending on whether it's configured with a hard drive or SSD, a 4400mAh 6-cell pack good for between 7-7.5h and finally a 5200mAh high density 6-cell battery pack good for up to 8.5-9h of usage. The Classmate+ PC will only be available to qualified education and government customers through Lenovo or its channel partners.&lt;ref&gt;http://vr-zone.com/articles/lenovo-and-intel-launch-the-classmate-pc/11554.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
Intel announced that its device would run either [[Linux]] or [[Windows XP|Windows XP Professional]]. Intel is not using [[Windows XP Embedded]] as initially planned. Intel has been actively working with various international and local Linux distributions in various countries.

Intel has worked with [[Mandriva]] to customize their Linux distribution for Classmate PC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS4146178789.html |title=Low-cost student laptops to run Mandriva Linux |publisher=Desktoplinux.com |date=2007-03-29 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mandriva on Classmate PC: A Linux Education for Everyone |url=http://www.olpcnews.com/software/operating_system/mandriva_classmate_linux.html |title=Mandriva on Classmate PC: A Linux Education for Everyone |publisher=OLPC News |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the Intel powered classmate PC has been shown to run the following Linux distributions:

*[[Mandriva Linux]](International &amp; Pan-European Linux operating system mandriva.com)
*[[Metasys]] (International Syst in Brazil)

===Latin America===
In [[Latin America]], contingent upon the receipt of sufficient international fund monies, the [[Mexico|Mexican]] and [[Brazil]]ian governments are evaluating whether to buy Intel's or the OLPC's laptop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.digitaltrends.com/article11875.html |title=Intel to Compete with OLPC in Brazil â Computing News â Digital Trends |publisher=News.digitaltrends.com |date=2006-12-07 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the hardware chosen, the Brazilian government announced that it would use the Linux operating system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Paul |first=Ryan |url=http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20061206-8371.html |title=Intel and OLPC compete for edu-laptop market in Brazil |publisher=Arstechnica.com |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been confirmed that Intel will be shipping the Laptops with [[Mandriva Linux]], Discovery 2007 edition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxelectrons.com/news/mobile/intels-classmate-mobile-pc-ships-south-america |title=Intel's 'Classmate' Mobile PC Ships to South America |publisher=LinuxElectrons |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the ''Classmate 2.0'' [[Linux distribution]] by the Brazilian company [[Metasys]].

Recently, Venezuelan government ordered 1 million Classmates from Portugal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/ap/2008/09/27/europe/EU-Portugal-Venezuela.php |title=Search - Global Edition - The New York Times |publisher=International Herald Tribune |date=2009-03-29 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/09/30/venezuela-portugal-sign |title=ChÃ¡vez chavs get linux classmates |publisher=The Inquirer |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; one of several bilateral deals that Portuguese officials valued at more than US$3 billion.

Oscar Clarke, President of Intel of Brasil, delivered thirty production units to the Brazilian Ministry of Education (MEC), for evaluation by ''SERPRO'' (Federal Data Processing Service of Brazil).{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

It is currently available in [[Argentina]] made by 10 diferent brands of manufactures with OS like Linux and Windows also in Paraguay through HITECER S.A - TROVATO CISA GROUP. About the end of 2009, Argentina's government planned to give all the public high school students one of these netbooks. 740 million U$S will be used to give all public schools routers and infrastructure to reduce the digital gap around the country.

===Africa===
In [[Africa]], Intel has also started shipping to [[Libya]] as part of its deal of supplying 150,000 units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tech.monstersandcritics.com/news/article_1370177.php/Intel_supplies_Libya_with_150000_Classmates |title=Intel supplies Libya with 150,000 Classmates |publisher=Tech.monstersandcritics.com |date=2007-10-31 |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

â The Intel Convertible third generation is called the '''MDG Flip 8.9&quot; Touchscreen Netbook PC''' [http://www.mdg.ca/flip]

They are currently being sold through sears.ca, theshoppingchannel.com, and zellers.

In Q4 of 2009 will be introducing the 10.1&quot; versions of both netbooks at retail.

==Comparisons with OLPC project==
The Classmate PC represents Intel's competitive response to the [[OLPC]] XO, whose unusually low prices and use of [[AMD]] chips threatened to steal market share from Intel and other major manufacturers. Although Intel initially criticized the XO laptops for their lack of functionalityâIntel's Chairman of the Board, [[Craig Barrett (businessman)|Craig Barrett]], himself claimed consumers wanted the full functionality of a PCâthe Classmate PCs are currently being heavily marketed against the XO worldwide. Intel has already secured deals to sell hundreds of thousands of Classmate PCs to [[Libya]], [[Nigeria]] and [[Pakistan]], the same developing countries the [[OLPC]] project had been targeting.&lt;ref&gt;Kraemer et al.: &quot;One Laptop Per Child: Vision vs. Reality&quot;, ''Communications of the ACM'', June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the Classmate PC project and the OLPC project have some differences. According to Intel: the Classmate PC aims to provide technology that fits into the larger, primarily Windows-based computing environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download.intel.com/intel/worldahead/pdf/classmatepc_productbrief.pdf?iid=worldahead+ed_cmpc_pdf |title=Product Brief of the Classmate PC |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the OLPC, the XO breaks from the desktop metaphor to provide a UI ([[Sugar (desktop environment)|Sugar]]) that they feel is more suited to the educational needs of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.laptop.org/laptop/software/index.shtml |title=One Laptop per Child (OLPC), Software: XO Vision |publisher=Laptop.org |date= |accessdate=2011-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the OLPC uses hardware and software highly customized for the educational environment, Intel has argued that the developing world wants to have generic [[Personal computer|PCs]]. In December 2005, Intel publicly dismissed the XO as a 'gadget'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20051212065117/http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/SP263515.htm Reuters AlertNet â World's poorest don't want &quot;$100 laptop&quot; -Intel]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intel joined the OLPC project in July 2007 and was widely expected to work on a version of the project's laptop that used an Intel chip, only to pull out of the project in January 2008. Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said it had pulled out because the OLPC organization had asked it to stop backing rival low-cost laptops,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7171201.stm|work=BBC News|title=One laptop project loses partner|date=January 4, 2008|accessdate= April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/05/technology/05laptop.html|work=The New York Times|title=Intel Quits Effort to Get Computers to Children|first= John|last=Markoff|date=January 5, 2008|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; while OLPC's founder [[Nicholas Negroponte]] has accused Intel of underhand sales tactics and trying to block contracts to buy his machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/7178241.stm|work=BBC News|title=Intel 'undermined' laptop project|date=January 9, 2008|accessdate=April 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
