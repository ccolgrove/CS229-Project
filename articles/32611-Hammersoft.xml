The [[Vietnam People's Army]] (North Vietnamese Army) engaged in a more [[conventional warfare|conventional war]], at times committing large units into battle. U.S. and South Vietnamese forces relied on [[Air supremacy|air superiority]] and overwhelming firepower to conduct [[search and destroy]] operations, involving [[Army|ground forces]], [[artillery]], and [[airstrike]]s.

The U.S. government viewed involvement in the war as a way to prevent a [[communist]] takeover of South Vietnam as part of their wider strategy of [[containment]]. The North Vietnamese government and Viet Cong viewed the conflict as a [[colonial war]], fought initially against [[France]], backed by the U.S., and later against South Vietnam, which it regarded as a U.S. [[puppet state]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Digital History, Steven Mintz |url=http://www.digitalhistory.uh.edu/modules/vietnam/index.cfm |title=The Vietnam War |publisher=Digitalhistory.uh.edu|accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; American [[military advisor]]s arrived in what was then [[French Indochina]] beginning in 1950.

Operations spanned international borders, with Laos and Cambodia heavily bombed. American involvement in the war peaked in 1968, at the time of the [[Tet Offensive]]. After this, U.S. ground forces were gradually withdrawn as part of a policy known as [[Vietnamization]]. Despite the [[Paris Peace Accords]], signed by all parties in January 1973, fighting continued.

U.S. military involvement ended on 15 August 1973 as a result of the [[CaseâChurch Amendment]] passed by the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, Gabriel ''Anatomy of War'', pp. 457, 461 ff., ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Fall of Saigon|capture of Saigon]] by the Vietnam People's Army in April 1975 marked the end of the war, and North and South Vietnam were reunified the following year.

==Names for the War==
{{further|[[Terminology of the Vietnam War]]}}
Various names have been applied to the conflict. ''Vietnam War'' is the most commonly used name in English. It has also been called the ''Second Indochina War'', and the ''Vietnam Conflict''.

As there have been so many conflicts in Indochina, this conflict is known by the name of their chief opponent to distinguish it from the others.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Harold. G and Joseph L. Galloway ''We Are Soldiers Still: A Journey Back to the Battlefields of Vietnam'' (p. 57).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, in [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], the war is known as ''Chiáº¿n tranh Viá»t Nam'' (The Vietnam War), or as ''KhÃ¡ng chiáº¿n chá»ng Má»¹'' (Resistance War Against America), loosely translated as ''the American War''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Asian-Nation: Asian American History, Demographics, &amp;amp; Issues:: The American / Viet Nam War|quote=The Viet Nam War is also called 'The American War' by the Vietnamese |url=http://www.asian-nation.org/vietnam-war.shtml |accessdate=18 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main military organizations involved in the war were, on one side, the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) and the U.S. military, and, on the other side, the [[Vietnam People's Army]] (VPA) (also known as the  North Vietnamese Army, or NVA), and the [[Viet Cong]], or National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam (NLF), a South Vietnamese communist guerrilla force.

During [[World War II]], the [[Battle of France|French were defeated by the Germans]] in 1940. For French Indochina, this meant that the colonial authorities became [[Vichy France|Vichy French]], allies of the German-Italian [[Axis powers]]. In turn this meant that the French collaborated with the Japanese forces after their [[invasion of French Indochina]] during 1940. The French continued to run affairs in the colony, but ultimate power resided in the hands of the Japanese.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 17&quot;/&gt;

The Viet Minh was founded as a league for independence from France, but also opposed Japanese occupation in 1945 for the same reason. The U.S. and Chinese Nationalist Party supported them in the fight against the Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WZry2NaH2_sC&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;ots=Yhrw1jzE4P&amp;dq=Chinese%20nationalists%20supported%20Vietminh&amp;pg=PA42#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vietnam] Vietnam by Spencer Tucker, p. 42, ISBN 0813109663 Retrieved 4 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they did not have enough power to fight actual battles at first.

Double occupation by France and Japan continued until the German forces were expelled from France and the French Indochina colonial authorities started holding secret talks with the [[Free French Forces|Free French]]. Fearing that they could no longer trust the French authorities, the Japanese army interned them all on 9 March 1945 and assumed direct control themselves&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 18, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; through their [[puppet state]], the [[Empire of Vietnam]], under [[Báº£o Äáº¡i]].

During 1944â1945, a [[Vietnamese Famine of 1945|deep famine]] struck northern Vietnam due to a combination of bad weather and French/Japanese exploitation. 1 million people died of starvation (out of a population of 10 million in the affected area).&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', pp. 18â19, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Exploiting the administrative gap&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolko, Gabriel page 36&quot;&gt;Kolko, Gabriel ''Anatomy of War'', p. 36, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; that the internment of the French had created, the Viet Minh in March 1945 urged the population to ransack rice warehouses and refuse to pay their [[tax]]es. &lt;ref&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 19, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 75 and 100 warehouses were consequently raided.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 20, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; This rebellion against the effects of the famine and the authorities that were partially responsible for it bolstered the Viet Minh's popularity and they recruited many members during this period.&lt;ref name=&quot;Kolko, Gabriel page 36&quot;/&gt;

In August 1945, the Japanese had been defeated and [[Surrender of Japan|surrendered unconditionally]]. In French Indochina this created a [[power vacuum]], as the French were still interned and the Japanese forces stood down.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;/&gt; The Viet Minh stepped into this vacuum and grasped power across Vietnam in the [[August Revolution]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;/&gt; largely supported by the Vietnamese population.&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, Gabriel ''Anatomy of War'', p. 37, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; After their defeat in the war, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] (IJA) gave weapons to the Vietnamese, and kept Vichy French officials and military officers imprisoned for a month after the surrender.

Ho Chi Minh declared the [[independence|independent]] [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] before a crowd of 500,000 in [[Hanoi]] on 2 September 1945.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;/&gt; In an overture to the Americans, he began his speech by paraphrasing the [[United States Declaration of Independence]]: ''All men are created equal.

However, the major [[Allies of World War II|allied victors of World War II]], the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, all agreed the area belonged to the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;/&gt; As the French did not have the ships, weapons, or soldiers to immediately retake Vietnam, the major powers came to an agreement that British troops would occupy the south while [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Chinese]] forces would move in from the north.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;/&gt; Nationalist Chinese troops entered the country to disarm Japanese troops north of the 16th parallel on September 14, 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willbanks|2009|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=X5WWklFB5O4C&amp;pg=PA8 8]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the British landed in the south, they rearmed the interned French forces as well as parts of the surrendered Japanese forces to aid them in retaking southern Vietnam, as they did not have enough troops to do this themselves.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 20&quot;/&gt;

Following the [[party line (politics)|party line]] from Moscow, Ho Chi Minh initially attempted to negotiate with the French, who were slowly re-establishing their control across the country.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 24, ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1946, the Viet Minh won elections across central and northern Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', pp. 23â24 ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; On March 6, 1946, Ho signed an agreement allowing French forces to replace Nationalist Chinese forces, in exchange for French recognition of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam as a &quot;free&quot; republic within the [[French Union]], with the specifics of such recognition to be determined by future negotiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willbanks|2009|p=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=X5WWklFB5O4C&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vietnamgear.com/March6agreement.aspx |title=Franco-Vietnam Agreement of March 6th, 1946 |publisher=Vietnamgear.com |date=1946-03-06 |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent2.htm |title=Pentagon Papers, Gravel Edition, Chapter !, Section 2 |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French landed in Hanoi by March 1946 and in November of that year they ousted the Viet Minh from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 24 ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; British forces departed on 26 March 1946, leaving Vietnam in the hands of the French.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Peter Dennis|title=Troubled days of peace: Mountbatten and South East Asia command, 1945-46|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=Inu7AAAAIAAJ|year=1987|publisher=Manchester University Press ND|isbn=9780719022050|page=[http://books.google.com.ph/books?id=Inu7AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA179 179]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon thereafter, the Viet Minh began a [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla war]] against the French Union forces, beginning the [[First Indochina War]].

The war spread to Laos and Cambodia, where Communists organized the [[Pathet Lao]] and the [[Khmer Serei]], both of which were modeled on the Viet Minh.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 25&quot;&gt;Neale, Jonathan ''The American War'', p. 25 ISBN 1-898876-67-3.&lt;/ref&gt; Globally, the Cold War began in earnest, which meant that the [[rapprochement]] that existed between the [[Western world|Western powers]] and the Soviet Union during World War II disintegrated. The Viet Minh fight was hampered by a lack of weapons; this situation changed by 1949 when the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]] had largely won the [[Chinese Civil War]] and were free to provide arms to their Vietnamese allies.&lt;ref name=&quot;Neale, Jonathan page 25&quot;/&gt;

In January 1950, the communist nations, led by the [[China|People's Republic of China]] (PRC), recognized the [[Viet Minh]]'s [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]], based in [[Hanoi]], as the government of Vietnam, while non-communist nations recognized the French-backed [[State of Vietnam]] in [[Saigon]], led by former Emperor [[Báº£o Äáº¡i]], as the Vietnamese government the following month.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 377&quot;&gt;McNamara, ''Argument Without End'' pp. 377â79.&lt;/ref&gt; The outbreak of the [[Korean War]] in June 1950 convinced many Washington policymakers that the war in [[Indochina]] was an example of communist expansionism directed by the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Kremlin]].&lt;ref&gt;''Pentagon Papers'', Gravel, ed, Chapter 2, 'U.S. Involvement in the Franco-Viet Minh War', p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were also talks between the French and Americans in which the possible use of three [[tactical nuclear weapon]]s was considered, though reports of how seriously this was considered and by whom are even now vague and contradictory.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Thousand Day War 1981, page 57&quot;&gt;Vietnam The Ten Thousand Day War, Thames 1981, Michael Maclear, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=seXWfsD46QQC Vietnam at War: The History: 1946â1975], ISBN 978-0-19-506792-7, [http://books.google.com/books?id=seXWfsD46QQC&amp;pg=PA263 p. 263].&lt;/ref&gt; One version of  the plan for the proposed [[Operation Vulture]] envisioned sending 60 B-29s from U.S. bases in the region, supported by as many as 150 fighters launched from U.S. Seventh Fleet carriers, to bomb Viet Minh commander [[Vo Nguyen Giap]]'s positions. The plan included an option to use up to three atomic weapons on the Viet Minh positions. Admiral [[Arthur W. Radford]], [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff|Chairman]] of the U.S. [[Joint Chiefs of Staff]], gave this nuclear option his backing. U.S. B-29s, B-36s, and B-47s could have executed a nuclear strike, as could carrier aircraft from the Seventh Fleet.&lt;ref name=AirForceMagazine&gt;[http://www.airforce-magazine.com/MagazineArchive/Pages/2004/August%202004/0804dien.aspx Dien Bien Phu], Air Force Magazine 87:8, August 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. carriers sailed to the [[Gulf of Tonkin]], and reconnaissance flights over Dien Bien Phu were conducted during the negotiations. According to U.S. Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]], the plan involved the Joint Chiefs of Staff drawing up plans to use three small tactical nuclear weapons in support of the French.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ten Thousand Day War 1981, page 57&quot;/&gt; Nixon, a so-called &quot;[[War Hawk|hawk]]&quot; on Vietnam, suggested that the United States might have to &quot;put American boys in&quot;.&lt;ref name=Tucker1999p76&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=FEpuVkgzFJYC Vietnam], Routledge, 1999, Spencer Tucker, ISBN 978-1-85728-922-0, [http://books.google.com/books?id=FEpuVkgzFJYC&amp;pg=PA76 p. 76].&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. President [[Dwight D.

The Viet Minh received crucial support from the Soviet Union and PRC. PRC support in the [[First Indochina War|Border Campaign of 1950]] allowed supplies to come from the PRC into Vietnam. Throughout the conflict, U.S. intelligence estimates remained skeptical of French chances of success.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pentagon Papers.'' Gravel, ed. vol. 1, pp. 391â404.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Battle of Dien Bien Phu]] marked the end of French involvement in Indochina. Giap's Viet Minh forces handed the French a stunning military defeat, and on 7 May 1954, the [[French Union]] garrison surrendered. Of the 12,000 French prisoners taken by the Viet Minh, only 3,000 survived.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;William C. Jeffries (2006).

==Transition period==

Vietnam was [[partition of Vietnam|temporarily partitioned]] at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]], and under the terms of the Geneva Accords, civilians were to be given the opportunity to move freely between the two provisional states for a 300-day period. Elections throughout the country were to be held in 1956 to establish a unified government.&lt;ref&gt;Press release by the Embassy of the Republic of Vietnam, quoted from the Washington, D.C. press and Information Service, vol l. no. 18 (22 July 1955) and no. 20 (18 August 1955), in Chapter 19 of Gettleman, Franklin and Young, ''Vietnam and America: A Documented History'', pp. 103â105.&lt;/ref&gt; Around one million northerners, mainly minority [[Catholic Church|Catholics]], fled south, fearing persecution by the communists&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, pp. 45â55.&lt;/ref&gt; following an American [[propaganda]] campaign using slogans such as &quot;The [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Virgin Mary]] is heading south&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;2VNbf&quot;&gt;''Two Viet-nams'' by Bernard B.

In addition to the Catholics flowing south, up to 130,000 &quot;Revolutionary Regroupees&quot; went to the north for &quot;regroupment,&quot; expecting to return to the south within two years.&lt;ref&gt;Anatomy of a war, Gabiel Kolko, Phoenix press 1994, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; The Viet Minh left roughly 5,000 to 10,000 [[Professional revolutionaries|cadre]]s in the south as a &quot;politico-military substructure within the object of its [[irredentism]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;1 ''Pentagon Papers'' (The Senator Gravel Edition), 247, 328 (Boston, Beacon Press, 1971).&lt;/ref&gt; The last French soldiers were to leave Vietnam in April 1956.&lt;ref name=&quot;HistoryPlace&quot;/&gt; The PRC completed its withdrawal from North Vietnam at around the same time.&lt;ref name=&quot;OtherSide14&quot;/&gt; Around 52,000 Vietnamese civilians moved from south to north.&lt;ref&gt;John Prados, &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20060527190340/http://www.vva.org/TheVeteran/2005_01/feature_numbersGame.htm The Numbers Game: How Many Vietnamese Fled South In 1954?]&quot;, ''The VVA Veteran'', January/February 2005. Retrieved 21 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the north, the Viet Minh ruled as the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and engaged in a drastic [[land reform]] program in which an estimated 8,000 perceived &quot;[[Enemy of the people|class enemies]]&quot; were executed.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Appy (2008) ''Vietnam: The Definitive Oral History, Told From All Sides''. London, Ebury Press: 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1956, leaders in Hanoi admitted to &quot;excesses&quot; in implementing this program and restored a large amount of the land to the original owners.&lt;ref&gt;Christian G. Appy (2008) ''Vietnam: The Definitive Oral History, Told From All Sides''. London, Ebury Press: 46â7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The south, meanwhile, constituted the State of Vietnam, with Báº£o Äáº¡i as Emperor and [[Ngo Dinh Diem|NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Diá»m]] (appointed in July 1954) as his prime minister. In June 1955, Diem announced that the scheduled 1956 elections would not be held, claiming South Vietnam had rejected the Geneva Accords from the beginning and was therefore not bound by them. &quot;How can we expect 'free elections' to be held in the Communist North?&quot; he asked. President Eisenhower echoed senior U.S. experts&lt;ref&gt;Kolko, Gabriel, ''Anatomy of a War'' p. 98, ISBN 1-56584-218-9.&lt;/ref&gt; when he wrote that, in 1954, &quot;80 per cent of the population would have voted for the Communist Ho Chi Minh&quot; over Emperor Báº£o Äáº¡i.&lt;ref&gt;Dwight D.

From April to June 1955, Diem (against U.S. advice) eliminated any political opposition in the south by launching military operations against the [[Cao Dai]] religious sect, the [[Hoa Hao]] sect of [[Ba Cut]], and the [[Binh Xuyen]] [[organized crime]] group (which was allied with members of the secret police and some military elements). As broad-based opposition to his harsh tactics mounted, Diem increasingly sought to blame the communists.&lt;ref name=RKBrigham&gt;Robert K. Brigham. [http://www.pbs.org/battlefieldvietnam/history/index.html ''Battlefield Vietnam: A Brief History.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In a referendum on the future of the State of Vietnam on 23 October 1955, Diem [[electoral fraud|rigged]] the poll supervised by his brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]] and was credited with 98.2 percent of the vote, including 133% in Saigon. His American advisers had recommended a more modest winning margin of &quot;60 to 70 percent.&quot; Diem, however, viewed the election as a test of authority.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 224&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three days later, he declared South Vietnam to be an independent state known as the Republic of Vietnam (ROV), with himself as president.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes (ed.) ''Examining Issues Through Political Cartoons: The Vietnam War'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ROV was created largely because of the Eisenhower administration's desire for an anti-communist state in the region.&lt;ref name=RKBrigham /&gt; The [[domino theory]], which argued that if one country fell to communism, then all of the surrounding countries would follow, was first proposed as policy by the Eisenhower administration.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; It was, and is still, commonly hypothesized that it applied to Vietnam. [[John F. Kennedy]], then a [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]], said in a speech to the American Friends of Vietnam: &quot;Burma, Thailand, India, Japan, the Philippines and obviously Laos and Cambodia are among those whose security would be threatened if the Red Tide of Communism overflowed into Vietnam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John F.

A devout [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], Diem was fervently anti-communist, nationalist, and socially conservative.

The majority of Vietnamese people were [[Buddhism|Buddhist]], and were alarmed by actions such as Diem's dedication of the country to the Virgin Mary.

Beginning in the summer of 1955, Diem launched the &quot;Denounce the Communists&quot; campaign, during which communists and other anti-government elements were arrested, imprisoned, tortured, or executed. He instituted the [[death penalty]] against any activity deemed communist in August 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/pentagon/pent14.htm |title=The Pentagon Papers Gravel Edition Volume 1, Chapter 5, &quot;Origins of the Insurgency in South Vietnam, 1954â1960&quot; |publisher=Mtholyoke.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regime branded its opponents [[Viet Cong]] (&quot;Vietnamese communist&quot;) to degrade their nationalist credentials. As a measure of the level of [[political repression]], about 12,000 suspected opponents of Diem were killed between 1955 and 1957 and by the end of 1958 an estimated 40,000 [[political prisoner]]s had been jailed.&lt;ref&gt;''Anatomy of a War'' by [[Gabriel Kolko]], ISBN 1-56584-218-9, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1957, Diem undertook a [[Ngo Dinh Diem presidential visit to the United States|ten-day state visit to the United States]]. President Eisenhower pledged his continued support, and a parade was held in Diem's honor in [[New York City]]. Although Diem was publicly praised, in private [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[John Foster Dulles]] conceded that Diem had been selected because there were no better alternatives.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 230&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Future U.S. [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]] wrote that the new American patrons of the ROV were almost completely ignorant of Vietnamese culture. They knew little of the language or long history of the country.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 377&quot;/&gt; There was a tendency to assign American motives to Vietnamese actions, and Diem warned that it was an illusion to believe that blindly copying Western methods would solve Vietnamese problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 377&quot;/&gt;

===Insurgency in the South, 1956â1960===
{{Main|Viet Cong|War in Vietnam (1959â1963)}}

The [[Sino-Soviet split]] led to a reduction in the influence of the PRC in Vietnam, as the Chinese had insisted in 1954 that the Viet Minh accept a division of the country. [[Truong Chinh|TrÆ°á»ng Chinh]], North Vietnam's pro-PRC party first secretary, was demoted and Hanoi authorized communists in South Vietnam to begin a low-level [[insurgency]] in December 1956.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This insurgency in the south had begun in response to Diem's Denunciation of Communists campaign, in which thousands of local Viet Minh cadres and supporters had been executed or sent to concentration camps, and was in violation of the Northern Communist party line, which had enjoined them not to start an insurrection, but rather engage in a political campaign, agitating for a free all-Vietnam election in accordance with the Geneva Accords.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sheehan (1988)'' A Bright Shining Lie''. New York, Vintage: 184â93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ho Chi Minh stated, &quot;Do not engage in military operations; that will lead to defeat. Do not take land from a peasant. Emphasize nationalism rather than communism. Do not antagonize anyone if you can avoid it. Be selective in your violence. If an assassination is necessary, use a knife, not a rifle or grenade. It is too easy to kill innocent bystanders with guns and bombs, and accidental killing of the innocent bystanders will alienate peasants from the revolution. Once an assassination has taken place, make sure peasants know why the killing occurred.&quot; This strategy was referred to as &quot;armed propaganda.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vo Nguyen Giap, &quot;The Political and Military Line of Our Party&quot;, in ''The Military Art'', pp. 179â80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon afterward, [[Le Duan|LÃª Duáº©n]], a communist leader who had been working in the south, returned to Hanoi to accept the position of acting first secretary, effectively replacing TrÆ°á»ng. Duáº©n urged a military line and advocated increased assistance to the insurgency. 400 government officials were assassinated in 1957 alone, and the violence gradually increased. While the terror was originally aimed at local government officials, it soon broadened to include other symbols of the ''status quo'', such as schoolteachers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In January 1959, North Vietnam's Central Committee issued a secret resolution authorizing an &quot;armed struggle,&quot; allowing the southern communists to begin large-scale operations against the South Vietnamese military. North Vietnam supplied troops and supplies in earnest, and the infiltration of men and weapons from the North began along the [[Ho Chi Minh trail|Ho Chi Minh Trail]]. In May, South Vietnam enacted Law 10/59, which made political violence punishable by death and property confiscation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vietnam.vassar.edu/doc6.html Excerpts from Law 10/59, 6 May 1959].&lt;/ref&gt; Observing the increasing unpopularity of the Diem regime, Hanoi authorized the creation of the [[Viet Cong|National Liberation Front]] (NLF) on 12 December 1960 as a [[common front]] controlled by the communist party in the South.

Successive American administrations, as [[Robert McNamara]] and others have noted, overestimated the control that Hanoi had over the NLF.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 377&quot;/&gt; Diem's paranoia, repression, and incompetence progressively angered large segments of the population of South Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense, ''U.S.-Vietnam Relations'', vol. 2, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a November 1960 report by the head of the U.S. military advisory team, Lieutenant General [[Lionel C. McGarr]], a &quot;significant part&quot; of the population in the south supported the communists.&lt;ref&gt;''Anatomy of a War'' by [[Gabriel Kolko]], ISBN 1-56584-218-9, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The communists thus had a degree of popular support for their campaign to bring down Diem and reunify the country.

==During John F. Kennedy's administration, 1961â1963==
{{Main|Strategic Hamlet Program|Pham Ngoc Thao}}
In the [[U.S. presidential election, 1960|1960 U.S. presidential election]], Senator [[John F. Kennedy]] defeated Vice-President [[Richard Nixon]]. Although Eisenhower warned Kennedy about Laos and Vietnam, Europe and Latin America &quot;loomed larger than Asia on his sights.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 264&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his inaugural address, Kennedy made the ambitious pledge to &quot;pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;The Avalon Project at Yale Law School. ''[http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/kennedy.asp Inaugural Address of John F. Kennedy].''&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1961, he bitterly disagreed with Soviet premier [[Nikita Khrushchev]] when they [[Vienna summit|met in Vienna]] to discuss key U.S.-Soviet issues.

The Kennedy administration remained essentially committed to the Cold War foreign policy inherited from the Truman and Eisenhower administrations. In 1961, the U.S. had 50,000 troops based in Korea, and Kennedy faced a three-part crisis &amp;ndash; the failure of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]], the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]], and a negotiated settlement between the pro-Western government of Laos and the [[Pathet Lao]] communist movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 265&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=265}} â suggested that &quot;Kennedy sidestepped Laos, whose rugged terrain was no battleground for American soldiers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; These made Kennedy believe that another failure on the part of the United States to gain control and stop communist expansion would fatally damage U.S. credibility with its allies and his own reputation. Kennedy was thus determined to &quot;draw a line in the sand&quot; and prevent a communist victory in Vietnam. He told James Reston of ''[[The New York Times]]'' immediately after his Vienna meeting with Khrushchev, &quot;Now we have a problem making our power credible and Vietnam looks like the place.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mcadams.posc.mu.edu/goldzwig.htm The case of John F. Kennedy and Vietnam Presidential Studies Quarterly].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Robert. ''A Grand Delusion'', Basic Books, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1961, Vice President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] visited Saigon and enthusiastically declared Diem the &quot;[[Winston Churchill]] of Asia.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 267&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asked why he had made the comment, Johnson replied, &quot;Diem's the only boy we got out there.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 230&quot;/&gt; Johnson assured Diem of more aid in molding a fighting force that could resist the communists.

Kennedy's policy toward South Vietnam rested on the assumption that Diem and his forces must ultimately defeat the guerrillas on their own. He was against the deployment of American combat troops and observed that &quot;to introduce U.S. forces in large numbers there today, while it might have an initially favorable military impact, would almost certainly lead to adverse political and, in the long run, adverse military consequences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense, ''U.S.-Vietnam Relations'', vol. 3, pp. 1â2.&lt;/ref&gt; 
The quality of the South Vietnamese military, however, remained poor. Bad leadership, corruption, and political promotions all played a part in emasculating the ARVN. The frequency of guerrilla attacks rose as the insurgency gathered steam. While Hanoi's support for the NLF played a role, South Vietnamese governmental incompetence was at the core of the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:South Vietnam Map.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[South Vietnam]], Military Regions, 1967]]

One major issue Kennedy raised was whether the Soviet space and missile programs had surpassed those of the United States. Although Kennedy stressed long-range missile parity with the Soviets, he was also interested in using special forces for counterinsurgency warfare in Third World countries threatened by communist insurgencies. Although they were originally intended for use behind front lines after a conventional invasion of Europe, Kennedy believed that the guerrilla tactics employed by special forces such as the [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Green Berets]] would be effective in a &quot;brush fire&quot; war in Vietnam.

Kennedy advisers [[Maxwell D. Taylor|Maxwell Taylor]] and [[Walt Whitman Rostow|Walt Rostow]] recommended that U.S. troops be sent to South Vietnam disguised as flood relief workers. Kennedy rejected the idea but increased military assistance yet again. In April 1962, [[John Kenneth Galbraith]] warned Kennedy of the &quot;danger we shall replace the French as a colonial force in the area and bleed as the French did.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;John Kenneth Galbraith. &quot;Memorandum to President Kennedy from John Kenneth Galbraith on Vietnam, 4 April 1962.&quot; ''The Pentagon Papers.'' Gravel. ed. Boston, Massachusetts Beacon Press, 1971, vol. 2. pp. 669â671.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1963, there were 16,000 American military personnel in South Vietnam, up from Eisenhower's 900 advisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Strategic Hamlet Program]] had been initiated in 1961. This joint U.S.-South Vietnamese program attempted to resettle the rural population into fortified camps. The aim was to isolate the population from the insurgents, provide education and health care, and strengthen the government's hold over the countryside. The Strategic Hamlets, however, were quickly infiltrated by the guerrillas. The peasants resented being uprooted from their ancestral villages. In part, this was because Colonel [[Pham Ngoc Thao]], a Diem favourite who was instrumental in running the program, was in fact a communist agent who used his Catholicism to gain influential posts and damage the ROV from the inside.

The government refused to undertake land reform, which left farmers paying high rents to a few wealthy landlords. Corruption dogged the program and intensified opposition.

On 23 July 1962, fourteen nations, including the People's Republic of China, South Vietnam, the Soviet Union, North Vietnam and the United States, signed an agreement promising the neutrality of Laos.&lt;ref name=laos35k&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/international-agreement-on-the-neutrality-of-laos-35k International Agreement on the Neutrality of Laos].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coup and assassinations===

The inept performance of the South Vietnamese army was exemplified by failed actions such as the [[Battle of Ap Bac]] on 2 January 1963, in which a small band of Viet Cong beat off a much larger and better equipped South Vietnamese force, many of whose officers seemed reluctant even to engage in combat.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Sheehan (1989) ''A Bright Shining Lie: John Paul Vann and America in Vietnam''. New York, Vintage: 201â66.&lt;/ref&gt; The ARVN were led in that battle by Diem's most trusted general, [[Huynh Van Cao]], commander of the [[IV Corps (South Vietnam)|IV Corps]]. Cao was a Catholic who had been promoted due to religion and fidelity rather than skill, and his main job was to preserve his forces to stave off coups; he had earlier vomited during a communist attack. Some policymakers in Washington began to conclude that Diem was incapable of defeating the communists and might even make a deal with Ho Chi Minh. He seemed concerned only with fending off coups, and had become more paranoid after attempts in 1960 and 1962, which he partly attributed to U.S. encouragement. As [[Robert F. Kennedy]] noted, &quot;Diem wouldn't make even the slightest concessions. He was difficult to reason with...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Live interview by John Bartlow Martin. ''Was Kennedy Planning to Pull out of Vietnam?'' New York, New York. John F. Kennedy Library, 1964, Tape V, Reel 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Discontent with Diem's policies exploded following the [[Huáº¿ Pháº­t Äáº£n shootings]] of majority Buddhists who were protesting against the ban on the [[Buddhist flag]] on [[VesÄkha|Vesak]], the Buddha's birthday. This resulted in mass protests against discriminatory policies that gave privileges to the Catholic Church and its adherents. Diem's elder brother [[Pierre Martin NgÃ´ ÄÃ¬nh Thá»¥c|Ngo Dinh Thuc]] was the Archbishop of Huáº¿ and aggressively blurred the separation between church and state. Thuc's anniversary celebrations shortly before Vesak had been bankrolled by the government and Vatican flags were displayed prominently. There had also been reports of Buddhist pagodas being demolished by Catholic paramilitaries throughout Diem's rule. Diem refused to make concessions to the Buddhist majority or take responsibility for the deaths. On 21 August 1963, the [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|ARVN Special Forces]] of Colonel [[Le Quang Tung]], loyal to Diem's younger brother [[Ngo Dinh Nhu]], [[Xa Loi Pagoda raids|raided pagodas across Vietnam]], causing widespread damage and destruction and leaving a death toll estimated to range into the hundreds.

[[File:Diem dead.jpg|thumb|[[Ngo Dinh Diem]] after being shot and killed in the 1963 coup.]]

U.S. officials began discussing the possibility of a regime change during the middle of 1963. The [[United States Department of State]] was generally in favor of encouraging a coup, while the Defense Department favored Diem. Chief among the proposed changes was the removal of Diem's younger brother Nhu, who controlled the secret police and special forces was seen as the man behind the Buddhist repression and more generally the architect of the Ngo family's rule. This proposal was conveyed to the U.S. embassy in Saigon in [[Cable 243]].

The [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) was in contact with generals planning to remove Diem. They were told that the United States would not oppose such a move nor punish the generals by cutting off aid. President Diem was overthrown and executed, along with his brother, on 2 November 1963. When he was informed, Maxwell Taylor remembered that Kennedy &quot;rushed from the room with a look of shock and dismay on his face.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 326&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had not approved Diem's murder. The U.S. ambassador to South Vietnam, [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.|Henry Cabot Lodge]], invited the coup leaders to the embassy and congratulated them. Ambassador Lodge informed Kennedy that &quot;the prospects now are for a shorter war&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 327&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the coup, chaos ensued. Hanoi took advantage of the situation and increased its support for the guerrillas. South Vietnam entered a period of extreme political instability, as one military government toppled another in quick succession. Increasingly, each new regime was viewed as a puppet of the Americans; whatever the failings of Diem, his credentials as a nationalist (as Robert McNamara later reflected) had been impeccable.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S military advisers were embedded at every level of the South Vietnamese armed forces. They were, however, almost completely ignorant of the political nature of the [[insurgency]]. The insurgency was a political power struggle, in which military engagements were not the main goal.&lt;ref name=&quot;Demma&quot;&gt;Demma, Vincent H. &quot;The U.S. Army in Vietnam.&quot; ''American Military History'' (1989) the official history of the United States Army.

The military leadership in Washington, however, was hostile to any role for U.S. advisers other than conventional troop training.&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Blaufarb. ''The Counterinsurgency Era.''

[[Lyndon B. Johnson]] (LBJ), as he took over the presidency after the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|death of Kennedy]], initially did not consider Vietnam a priority and was more concerned with his &quot;[[Great Society]]&quot; and progressive social programs. Presidential aide [[Jack Valenti]] recalls, &quot;Vietnam at the time was no bigger than a man's fist on the horizon. We hardly discussed it because it was not worth discussing.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow pp. 336-339&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|pp=336â339}} â Johnson viewed many members whom he inherited from Kennedy's cabinet with distrust because he had never penetrated their circle early in Kennedy's presidency; to Johnson's mind, such as [[W. Averell Harriman]] and [[Dean Acheson]] spoke a different language.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shortly after the assassination of Kennedy, when [[McGeorge Bundy]] called LBJ on the phone, LBJ responded: &quot;Goddammit, Bundy. I've told you that when I want you I'll call you.&quot; Brian VanDeMark, ''Into the Quagmire'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 November 1963, Johnson said, &quot;the battle against communism... must be joined... with strength and determination.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Vietnam: ''A History'' (New York: Penguin books, 1983), p. 339. Before a small group, including [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], the new president also said, &quot;We should stop playing cops and robbers [a reference to Diem's failed leadership] and get back to... winning the war... tell the generals in Saigon that Lyndon Johnson intends to stand by our word...[to] win the contest against the externally directed and supported Communist conspiracy.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The pledge came at a time when Vietnam was deteriorating, especially in places like the Mekong Delta, because of the recent coup against Diem.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 339&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=339}} â talking about the Mekong Delta, that, &quot;At a place called Hoa Phu, for example, the [[Strategic Hamlet Program|strategic hamlet]] built during the previous summer now looked like it had been hit by a hurricane....

The peasants complied without question.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson had reversed Kennedy's disengagement policy from Vietnam in withdrawing 1,000 troops by the end of 1963 ([[Presidential directive|NSAM]] 263 on 11 October),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklancer.com/NSAM263.html National Security Action Memorandum NSAM 263 &amp;nbsp; (11 October 1963)].&lt;/ref&gt; with his own NSAM 273 (26 November)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jfklancer.com/NSAM273.html NSAM 273 &amp;nbsp; (26 November 1963)].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NSAM 273: South Vietnam|url=http://www.lbjlib.utexas.edu/johnson/archives.hom/NSAMs/nsam273.asp|accessdate=23 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; to expand the war.

The military revolutionary council, meeting in lieu of a strong South Vietnamese leader, was made up of 12 members headed by General [[Duong Van Minh]]âwhom [[Stanley Karnow]], a journalist on the ground, later recalled as &quot;a model of lethargy.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 340&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=340}} â who quote Minh as enjoying playing tennis more than bureaucratic work.&lt;/ref&gt; Lodge, frustrated by the end of the year, cabled home about Minh: &quot;Will he be strong enough to get on top of things?&quot; His regime was overthrown in January 1964 by General [[Nguyen Khanh]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 341&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there was persistent instability in the military as several coupsânot all successfulâoccurred in a short space of time.

The second attack led to retaliatory air strikes, prompted Congress to approve the [[Gulf of Tonkin Resolution]], and gave the president power to conduct military operations in Southeast Asia without declaring war. In the same month, Johnson pledged that he was not &quot;...&amp;nbsp;committing American boys to fighting a war that I think ought to be fought by the boys of Asia to help protect their own land.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Palmer&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Palmer|first=Dave Richard|title=Summons of the Trumpet: U.S.-Vietnam in Perspective|publisher=Presidio Press|year=1978|page=882|isbn=0891415505|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Examining Issues Through Political Cartoons: The Vietnam War'' p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; George C. Herring argues, however, that McNamara and the Pentagon &quot;did not knowingly lie about the alleged attacks, but they were obviously in a mood to retaliate and they seem to have selected from the evidence available to them those parts that confirmed what they wanted to believe.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;George C.

As well, it was aimed at bolstering the morale of the South Vietnamese.&lt;ref name = &quot;Tilford 89&quot;&gt;Earl L. Tilford, ''Setup: What the Air Force did in Vietnam and Why''.

Bombing was not restricted to North Vietnam. Other aerial campaigns, such as [[Operation Commando Hunt]], targeted different parts of the NLF and VPA infrastructure. These included the [[Ho Chi Minh trail]], which ran through Laos and Cambodia. The objective of forcing North Vietnam to stop its support for the NLF, however, was never reached. As one officer noted &quot;this is a political war and it calls for discriminate killing. The best weapon... would be a knife... The worst is an airplane.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtwright p. 210&quot;/&gt; The [[Chief of Staff of the United States Air Force]] [[Curtis LeMay]], however, had long advocated saturation bombing in Vietnam and wrote of the Communists that &quot;we're going to bomb them back into the Stone Age&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giga-usa.com/quotes/authors/curtis_e_lemay_a001.htm Gen.

===Escalation and ground war===

After several attacks upon them, it was decided that [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]] bases needed more protection. The South Vietnamese military seemed incapable of providing security. On 8 March 1965, 3,500 [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] were dispatched to South Vietnam. This marked the beginning of the American ground war. U.S. public opinion overwhelmingly supported the deployment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In a statement similar to that made to the French almost two decades earlier, Ho Chi Minh warned that if the Americans &quot;want to make war for twenty years then we shall make war for twenty years. If they want to make peace, we shall make peace and invite them to afternoon tea.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Ho Chi Minh. ''Letter to Martin Niemoeller.'' December 1966. quoted in Marilyn B. Young. ''The Vietnam Wars: 1945â1990.'' New York, New York. Harper, 1991, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; As former First Deputy Foreign Minister Tran Quang Co has noted, the primary goal of the war was to reunify Vietnam and secure its independence. The policy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam (DRV) was not to topple other non-communist governments in South East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, ''Argument Without End'' p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Marines' assignment was defensive. The initial deployment of 3,500 in March was increased to nearly 200,000 by December.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 349&quot;&gt;McNamara, ''Argument Without End'' pp. 349â51.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. military had long been schooled in offensive warfare.

[[File:Checking house during patrol.jpg|right|thumb|U.S. soldiers searching a village for [[Viet Cong|NLF]]]]

Desertion rates were increasing, and [[morale]] plummeted. General [[William Westmoreland]] informed Admiral [[U. S. Grant Sharp, Jr.]], commander of U.S. Pacific forces, that the situation was critical.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 349&quot;/&gt; He said, &quot;I am convinced that U.S. troops with their energy, mobility, and firepower can successfully take the fight to the NLF [National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense, ''U.S.-Vietnam Relations'' vol. 4, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; With this recommendation, Westmoreland was advocating an aggressive departure from America's defensive posture and the sidelining of the South Vietnamese. By ignoring ARVN units, the U.S. commitment became open-ended.&lt;ref&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' p. 353.&lt;/ref&gt; Westmoreland outlined a three-point plan to win the war:

*Phase 1. Commitment of U.S. (and other free world) forces necessary to halt the losing trend by the end of 1965.
*Phase 2. U.S. and allied forces mount major offensive actions to seize the initiative to destroy guerrilla and organized enemy forces. This phase would end when the enemy had been worn down, thrown on the defensive, and driven back from major populated areas.
*Phase 3. If the enemy persisted, a period of twelve to eighteen months following Phase 2 would be required for the final destruction of enemy forces remaining in remote base areas.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense, ''U.S.-Vietnam Relations'' vol. 5, pp. 8â9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan was approved by Johnson and marked a profound departure from the previous administration's insistence that the government of South Vietnam was responsible for defeating the guerrillas. Westmoreland predicted victory by the end of 1967.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense, ''U.S.-Vietnam Relations'' vol. 4, pp 117â119. and vol. 5, pp. 8â12.&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson did not, however, communicate this change in strategy to the media. Instead he emphasized continuity.&lt;ref&gt;''Public Papers of the Presidents, 1965.'' Washington, D.C. Government Printing Office, 1966, vol. 2, pp. 794â799.&lt;/ref&gt; The change in U.S. policy depended on matching the North Vietnamese and the NLF in a contest of [[attrition warfare|attrition]] and [[morale]]. The opponents were locked in a cycle of [[escalation]].&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 353&quot;&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' pp. 353â354.&lt;/ref&gt; The idea that the government of South Vietnam could manage its own affairs was shelved.&lt;ref name=&quot;McNamara 353&quot;/&gt;

The one-year [[tour of duty]] deprived units of experienced leadership. As one observer noted &quot;we were not in Vietnam for 10 years, but for one year 10 times.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Courtwright p. 210&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Courtwright|2005|p=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, training programs were shortened.

South Vietnam was inundated with manufactured goods. As Stanley Karnow writes, &quot;the main PX [Post Exchange], located in the Saigon suburb of [[Cholon, Ho Chi Minh City|Cholon]], was only slightly smaller than the New York [[Bloomingdale's]]...&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 453&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=453}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American buildup transformed the economy and had a profound effect on South Vietnamese society. A huge surge in corruption was witnessed.

[[File:HoCMT.png|thumb|left|The Ho Chi Minh Trail running through Laos, 1967]]

Washington encouraged its [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization|SEATO]] allies to contribute troops. Australia, New Zealand, the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]], [[Thailand]], and the [[Philippines]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 556&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=556}}&lt;/ref&gt; all agreed to send troops. Major allies, however, notably [[NATO]] nations Canada and the United Kingdom, declined Washington's troop requests.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Church. ed. ''A Short History of South-East Asia.'' Singapore, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006, p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The U.S. and its allies mounted complex operations, such as operations [[Operation Masher|Masher]], [[Operation Attleboro|Attleboro]], [[Operation Cedar Falls|Cedar Falls]], and [[Operation Junction City|Junction City]]. However, the communist insurgents remained elusive and demonstrated great [[Military tactics|tactical]] flexibility.

Meanwhile, the political situation in South Vietnam began to stabilize with the coming to power of Prime Minister Air Marshal [[Nguyen Cao Ky|Nguyá»n Cao Ká»³]] and figurehead Chief of State, General [[Nguyen Van Thieu|Nguyá»n VÄn Thiá»u]], in mid 1965 at the head of a military junta. This ended a series of coups that had happened more than once a year. In 1967, Thieu became president with Ky as his deputy, after rigged elections. Although they were nominally a civilian government, Ky was supposed to maintain real power through a behind-the-scenes military body. However, Thieu outmanoevred and sidelined Ky by filling the ranks with generals from his faction. Thieu was also accused of murdering Ky loyalists through contrived military accidents. Thieu, mistrustful and indecisive, remained president until 1975, having won a one-man election in 1971.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 706&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Johnson administration employed a &quot;policy of minimum candor&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 18&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; in its dealings with the media. Military information officers sought to manage media coverage by emphasizing stories that portrayed progress in the war. Over time, this policy damaged the public trust in official pronouncements. As the media's coverage of the war and that of the Pentagon diverged, a so-called [[credibility gap]] developed.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 18&quot;/&gt;

===Tet Offensive===
{{Main|Tet Offensive}}

Having lured General Westmoreland's forces into the hinterland at [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]] in [[Quáº£ng Trá» Province]],&lt;ref&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' pp. 363â365.&lt;/ref&gt; in January 1968, the NVA and NLF broke the truce that had traditionally accompanied the [[Táº¿t]] (Lunar New Year) holiday. They launched the surprise Tet Offensive in the hope of sparking a national uprising. Over 100 cities were attacked, with assaults on General Westmoreland's headquarters and the [[United States Embassy, Saigon|U.S. Embassy, Saigon]].

Although the U.S. and South Vietnamese forces were initially taken aback by the scale of the urban offensive, they responded quickly and effectively, decimating the ranks of the NLF. In the former capital city of [[Huáº¿]], the combined NLF and VPA troops captured the Imperial Citadel and much of the city, which led to the [[Battle of Huáº¿]]. Throughout the offensive, the American forces employed massive firepower; in Huáº¿ where the battle was the fiercest, that firepower left 80% of the city in ruins.&lt;ref&gt;''Anatomy of a War'' by [[Gabriel Kolko]] ISBN 1-56584-218-9 pp. 308â309.&lt;/ref&gt; During the interim between the capture of the Citadel and end of the &quot;Battle of Huáº¿&quot;, the communist insurgent occupying forces [[Massacre at Huáº¿|massacred several thousand unarmed Huáº¿]] civilians (estimates vary up to a high of 6,000). After the war, North Vietnamese officials acknowledged that the Tet Offensive had, indeed, caused grave damage to NLF forces. But the offensive had another, unintended consequence.

General Westmoreland had become the public face of the war. He was featured on the cover of ''Time'' magazine three times and was named 1965's Man of the Year.&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;&gt;&quot;The Guardians at the Gate&quot;, ''Time'' 7 January 1966, vol. 87, no.1.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Time'' described him as &quot;the sinewy personification of the American fighting man... (who) directed the historic buildup, drew up the battle plans, and infused the... men under him with his own idealistic view of U.S. aims and responsibilities.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Time&quot;/&gt;
[[File:Hue1968.jpg|thumb|U.S. Marines fighting in [[Huáº¿]]]]
In November 1967 Westmoreland spearheaded a public relations drive for the Johnson administration to bolster flagging public support.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witz&quot;&gt;Witz ''The Tet Offensive: Intelligence Failure in War'' pp. 1â2.&lt;/ref&gt; In a speech before the [[National Press Club (USA)|National Press Club]] he said that a point in the war had been reached &quot;where the end comes into view.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Larry Berman. ''Lyndon Johnson's War.'' New York, W.W. Norton, 1991, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the public was shocked and confused when Westmoreland's predictions were trumped by Tet.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witz&quot;/&gt; The American media, which had been largely supportive of U.S. efforts, rounded on the Johnson administration for what had become an increasing credibility gap. Despite its military failure, the Tet Offensive became a political victory and ended the career of President Lyndon B. Johnson, who declined to run for re-election. Johnson's approval rating slumped from 48 to 36 percent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Witz&quot;/&gt;

As James Witz noted, Tet &quot;contradicted the claims of progress... made by the Johnson administration and the military.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Witz&quot;/&gt; The Tet Offensive was the turning point in America's involvement in the Vietnam War. It had a profound impact on domestic support for the conflict. The offensive constituted an [[Failure in the intelligence cycle|intelligence failure]] on the scale of [[Attack on Pearl Harbor|Pearl Harbor]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 556&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harold P.

[[File:Deadvietcong2.jpg|thumb|right|NLF/NVA killed by U.S. air force personnel during an attack on the perimeter of Tan Son Nhut Air Base during the Tet Offensive]]

Westmoreland became Chief of Staff of the Army in March, just as all resistance was finally subdued. The move was technically a promotion. However, his position had become untenable because of the offensive and because his request for 200,000 additional troops had been leaked to the media. Westmoreland was succeeded by his deputy [[Creighton Abrams]], a commander less inclined to public media pronouncements.&lt;ref&gt;Sorely 1999, pp. 11â16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 May 1968, despite low expectations, [[Paris Peace Accords|peace talks]] began between the United States and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Negotiations stagnated for five months, until Johnson gave orders to halt the bombing of North Vietnam. The [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate, Vice President [[Hubert Humphrey]], was running against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] former vice president [[Richard Nixon]].

As historian Robert Dallek writes, &quot;Lyndon Johnson's escalation of the war in Vietnam divided Americans into warring camps... cost 30,000 American lives by the time he left office, (and) destroyed Johnson's presidency...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes (ed.) ''Examining Issues Through Political Cartoons: The Vietnam War'' p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; His refusal to send more U.S. troops to Vietnam was seen as Johnson's admission that the war was lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Command Magazine Issue 18, page 15&quot;&gt;Command Magazine Issue 18, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; It can be seen that the refusal was a tacit admission that the war could not be won by escalation, at least not at a cost acceptable to the American people.&lt;ref name=&quot;Command Magazine Issue 18, page 15&quot;/&gt; As Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara noted, &quot;the dangerous illusion of victory by the United States was therefore dead.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;McNamara ''Argument Without End'' pp. 366â367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vietnamization, 1969â1972==
===Nixon Doctrine / Vietnamization===
[[File:Vietnampropaganda.png|thumb|Propaganda leaflet urging the defection of NLF and North Vietnamese to the side of the Republic of Vietnam]]
{{For|more details on this topic|Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization,_1969â1975 |#Vietnamization, 1969â1974}}
Severe communist losses during the Tet Offensive allowed U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] to begin troop withdrawals. His plan, called the [[Nixon Doctrine]], was to build up the ARVN, so that they could take over the defense of South Vietnam. The policy became known as &quot;[[Vietnamization]]&quot;. Vietnamization had much in common with the policies of the Kennedy administration. One important difference, however, remained. While Kennedy insisted that the South Vietnamese fight the war themselves, he attempted to limit the scope of the conflict.

Nixon said in an announcement, &quot;I am tonight announcing plans for the withdrawal of an additional 150,000 American troops to be completed during the spring of next year. This will bring a total reduction of 265,500 men in our armed forces in Vietnam below the level that existed when we took office 15 months ago.&quot;&lt;ref name=upi1970&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Audio/Year_in_Review/Events-of-1970/Apollo-13/12303235577467-2/#title |title=Vietnamization: 1970 Year in Review |publisher=Upi.com |date=2011-10-27 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 October 1969, Nixon ordered a squadron of 18 [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]]s loaded with nuclear weapons [[Operation Giant Lance|to race to the border of Soviet airspace]] to convince the Soviet Union that he was capable of anything to end the Vietnam War.

Nixon also pursued negotiations. Theater commander [[Creighton Abrams]] shifted to smaller operations, aimed at communist logistics, with better use of firepower and more cooperation with the ARVN. Nixon also began to pursue [[dÃ©tente]] with the Soviet Union and [[Sino-American relations#Rapprochement|rapprochement with the People's Republic of China]]. This policy helped to decrease global tensions. DÃ©tente led to nuclear arms reduction on the part of both [[superpower]]s. But Nixon was disappointed that the PRC and the Soviet Union continued to supply the North Vietnamese with aid. In September 1969, Ho Chi Minh died at age seventy-nine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Ho Chi Minh Dies of Heart Attack in Hanoi |work = The Times |page =1 |date =4 September 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anti-war movement was gaining strength in the United States. Nixon appealed to the &quot;[[silent majority]]&quot; of Americans to support the war. But revelations of the [[My Lai Massacre]], in which a U.S. Army [[My Lai Massacre#1st Platoon|platoon]] raped and killed civilians, and the 1969 &quot;[[Green Beret Affair]]&quot; where eight Special Forces soldiers, including the 5th Special Forces Group Commander were arrested for the murder&lt;ref&gt;Jeff Stein, Murder in Wartime: The Untold Spy Story that Changed the Course of the Vietnam War.

The civilian cost of the war was again questioned when U.S. forces concluded [[Operation Speedy Express]] with a claimed bodycount of 10,889 Communist guerillas with only 40 U.S. losses; Kevin Buckley writing in ''[[Newsweek]]'' estimated that perhaps 5,000 of the Vietnamese dead were civilians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Beginning in 1970, American troops were being taken away from border areas where much more killing took place, and instead put along the coast and interior, which is one reason why casualties in 1970 were less than half of 1969's totals.&lt;ref name=upi1970 /&gt;

===Operation Menu: the secret bombing of Cambodia and Laos===
{{Main|Operation Menu}}
Prince [[Norodom Sihanouk]] had proclaimed Cambodia neutral since 1955,&lt;ref&gt;Prince Norodom Sihanouk. &quot;Cambodia Neutral: The Dictates of Necessity.&quot; ''Foreign Affairs'' 1958, pp. 582â583.&lt;/ref&gt; but the communists used Cambodian soil as a base and Sihanouk tolerated their presence, because he wished to avoid being drawn into a wider regional conflict. Under pressure from Washington, however, he changed this policy in 1969. The Vietnamese communists were no longer welcome. President Nixon took the opportunity to launch a massive secret bombing campaign, called Operation Menu, against their sanctuaries along the Cambodia/Vietnam border.

This violated a long succession of pronouncements from Washington supporting Cambodian neutrality. Richard Nixon wrote to Prince Sihanouk in April 1969 assuring him that the United States respected &quot;the sovereignty, neutrality and territorial integrity of the Kingdom of Cambodia...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;quoted in {{Cite book

The country's borders were closed, while U.S. forces and ARVN launched [[Cambodian Campaign|incursions into Cambodia]] to attack VPA/NLF bases and buy time for South Vietnam.

The invasion of Cambodia sparked nationwide U.S. protests. [[Kent State shootings|Four students were killed by National Guardsmen]] at [[Kent State University]] during a protest in [[Ohio]], which provoked public outrage in the United States. The reaction to the incident by the Nixon administration was seen as callous and indifferent, providing additional impetus for the anti-war movement.&lt;ref&gt;Joe Angio.

In 1971 the [[Pentagon Papers]] were leaked to ''[[The New York Times]]''. The top-secret history of U.S. involvement in Vietnam, commissioned by the Department of Defense, detailed a long series of public deceptions. The [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] ruled that its publication was legal.&lt;ref name=&quot;eJournal.USA&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|last=[[USA.gov]]|year=1997|month=February|title=The Pentagon Papers Case|journal= EJournal USA|volume= 2|issue= 1 |url=http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0297/ijde/goodsb1.htm |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080112095748/http://usinfo.state.gov/journals/itdhr/0297/ijde/goodsb1.htm |archivedate=12 January 2008 |accessdate= 27 April 2010 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ARVN launched [[Operation Lam Son 719]] in February 1971, aimed at cutting the Ho Chi Minh trail in Laos.&lt;ref name=laos35k /&gt; The ostensibly neutral Laos had long been the scene of a secret war. After meeting resistance, ARVN forces retreated in a confused rout. They fled along roads littered with their own dead. When they ran out of fuel, soldiers abandoned their vehicles and attempted to barge their way on to American helicopters sent to evacuate the wounded. Many ARVN soldiers clung to helicopter skids in a desperate attempt to save themselves. U.S. aircraft had to destroy abandoned equipment, including tanks, to prevent them from falling into enemy hands. Half of the invading ARVN troops were either captured or killed. The operation was a fiasco and represented a clear failure of Vietnamization. As Karnow noted &quot;the blunders were monumental... The (South Vietnamese) government's top officers had been tutored by the Americans for ten or fifteen years, many at training schools in the United States, yet they had learned little.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow pp. 644-645&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|pp=644â645}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 Australia and New Zealand withdrew their soldiers. The U.S. troop count was further reduced to 196,700, with a deadline to remove another 45,000 troops by February 1972. As peace protests spread across the United States, disillusionment and ill-discipline grew in the ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

[[File:EASTER.jpg|thumb|right||The Nguyen Hue Offensive, 1972, part of the [[Easter Offensive]]]]
Vietnamization was again tested by the [[Easter Offensive]] of 1972, a massive conventional invasion of South Vietnam. The VPA and NLF quickly overran the northern provinces and in coordination with other forces attacked from Cambodia, threatening to cut the country in half. U.S. troop withdrawals continued. But American airpower came to the rescue with [[Operation Linebacker]], and the offensive was halted. However, it became clear that without American airpower South Vietnam could not survive. The last remaining American ground troops were withdrawn in August.

The war was the central issue of the [[United States presidential election, 1972|1972 presidential election]]. Nixon's opponent, [[George McGovern]], campaigned on a platform of withdrawal from Vietnam. Nixon's National Security Adviser, [[Henry Kissinger]], continued secret negotiations with North Vietnam's [[LÃª Ãá»©c Thá»]]. In October 1972, they reached an agreement.

However, South Vietnamese President Thieu demanded massive changes to the peace accord. When North Vietnam went public with the agreement's details, the Nixon administration claimed that the North was attempting to embarrass the President. The negotiations became deadlocked. Hanoi demanded new changes.

[[File:B-52D(061127-F-1234S-017).jpg|thumb|left|[[Operation Linebacker II]], December 1972]]
To show his support for South Vietnam and force Hanoi back to the negotiating table, Nixon ordered [[Operation Linebacker II]], a massive bombing of Hanoi and Haiphong 18â29 December 1972. The offensive destroyed much of the remaining economic and industrial capacity of North Vietnam. Simultaneously Nixon pressured Thieu to accept the terms of the agreement, threatening to conclude a bilateral peace deal and cut off American aid.

On 15 January 1973, Nixon announced the suspension of offensive action against North Vietnam. The [[Paris Peace Accords]] on &quot;Ending the War and Restoring Peace in Vietnam&quot; were signed on 27 January 1973, officially ending direct U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. A cease-fire was declared across North and South Vietnam. U.S. [[prisoner of war|POW]]s were released. The agreement guaranteed the territorial integrity of Vietnam and, like the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Conference]] of 1954, called for national elections in the North and South. The Paris Peace Accords stipulated a sixty-day period for the total withdrawal of U.S. forces. &quot;This article&quot;, noted Peter Church, &quot;proved... to be the only one of the Paris Agreements which was fully carried out.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Church, ed. ''A Short History of South-East Asia.'' Singapore. John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2006, pp. 193â194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opposition to the Vietnam War: 1962â1975==
{{Globalize|date=April 2010}}
[[File:US riverboat using napalm in Vietnam.jpg|thumb|U.S. Navy riverboat deploying [[napalm]] during the Vietnam War]]
{{Main|Opposition to the U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War}}
Some advocates within the peace movement advocated a unilateral withdrawal of U.S. forces from Vietnam. One reason given for the withdrawal is that it would contribute to a lessening of tensions in the region and thus less human bloodshed. Early opposition to U.S. involvement in Vietnam was centered around the [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva conference of 1954]]. American support of Diem in refusing elections was thought to be thwarting the very democracy that America claimed to be supporting. John Kennedy, while Senator, opposed involvement in Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;USvietAnalysis&quot;/&gt;

Opposition to the Vietnam War tended to unite groups opposed to U.S. anti-communism, [[imperialism]] and [[colonialism]] and, for those involved with the [[New Left]] such as the [[Catholic Worker Movement]], capitalism itself. Others, such as [[Stephen Spiro]] opposed the war based on the theory of [[Just War]]. Some wanted to show solidarity with the people of Vietnam, such as [[Norman Morrison]] emulating the actions of [[ThÃ­ch Quáº£ng Äá»©c]]. Some critics of U.S. withdrawal predicted that it would not contribute to peace but rather vastly increase bloodshed. These critics advocated U.S. forces remain until all threats from the [[Viet Cong]] and North Vietnamese Army had been eliminated. Advocates of U.S. withdrawal were generally known as &quot;doves&quot;, and they called their opponents &quot;[[War Hawk|hawks]]&quot;, following nomenclature dating back to the [[War of 1812]].

High-profile opposition to the Vietnam War turned to street protests in an effort to turn U.S. political opinion. On 15 October 1969, the [[Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam|Vietnam Moratorium]] attracted millions of Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/october/15/newsid_2533000/2533131.stm 1969: Millions march in US Vietnam Moratorium]. BBC On This Day.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Kent State shootings|fatal shooting]] of four students at [[Kent State University]] led to nation-wide university protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.greenwych.ca/vietnam.htm|title=Vietnam â A View from the Walls: a History of the Vietnam Anti-War Movement|author=Bob Fink|publisher=Greenwich Publishing

Anti-war protests ended with the final withdrawal of troops after the [[Paris Peace Accords]] were signed in 1973. South Vietnam was left to defend itself alone when the fighting resumed. Many South Vietnamese subsequently fled to the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Immigration in US history |url=http://crfimmigrationed.org/index.php/immigration-in-us-history |chapter=History Lesson 8: Refugees From Vietnam and Cambodia |chapter-url=http://crfimmigrationed.org/index.php/lessons-for-teachers/147-hl8 |publisher=[http://crfimmigrationed.org/ Constitutional Rights Foundation]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exit of the Americans: 1973â1975==
The United States began drastically reducing their troop support in South Vietnam during the final years of &quot;[[Role of the United States in the Vietnam War#Vietnamization, 1969â1975|Vietnamization]]&quot;.  Many U.S. troops were removed from the region, and on 5 March 1971, the United States returned the [[5th Special Forces Group (United States)|5th Special Forces Group]], which was the first American unit deployed to [[South Vietnam]], to its former base in [[Fort Bragg (North Carolina)|Fort Bragg]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Stanton p. 240&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Stanton|2003|p=240}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{#tag:ref|On 8 March 1965 the first American combat troops the, [[3rd Marine Division (United States)#Vietnam War|Third Marine Regiment, Third Marine Division]], began landing in Vietnam to protect the [[Da Nang International Airport|Da Nang airport]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Willbanks|2009| p = [http://books.google.com/books?id=X5WWklFB5O4C&amp;pg=PA110 110]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;nps.gov&quot;&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://www.nps.gov/mrc/reader/vvmcr.htm|title = Facts about the Vietnam Veterans memorial collection| publisher = [[National Park Service|NPS.gov]]| accessdate = 26 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; |group=&quot;A&quot;}}

Under the [[Paris Peace Accords]], between North Vietnamese Foreign Minister [[LÃª Ãá»©c Thá»]] and U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and reluctantly signed by South Vietnamese President [[Nguyen Van Thieu|Thiá»u]], U.S. military forces withdrew from South Vietnam and prisoners were exchanged.  North Vietnam was allowed to continue supplying communist troops in the South, but only to the extent of replacing materials that were consumed. Later that year the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] was awarded to Kissinger and Thá», but the Vietnamese negotiator declined it saying that a true peace did not yet exist.

The communist leaders had expected that the ceasefire terms would favor their side. But Saigon, bolstered by a surge of U.S. aid received just before the ceasefire went into effect, began to roll back the Vietcong.  The communists responded with a new strategy hammered out in a series of meetings in Hanoi in March 1973, according to the memoirs of [[Tran Van Tra|Tráº§n VÄn TrÃ ]].&lt;ref name = &quot;Karnow pp. 672-74&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|pp=672â74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Vietcong's top commander, TrÃ  participated in several of these meetings.  With U.S. bombings suspended, work on the Ho Chi Minh Trail and other logistical structures could proceed unimpeded.  Logistics would be upgraded until the North was in a position to launch a massive invasion of the South, projected for the 1975â76 dry season.  TrÃ  calculated that this date would be Hanoi's last opportunity to strike before Saigon's army could be fully trained.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow pp. 672-74&quot;/&gt;

In the November 1972 Election, McGovern lost 49 of 50 states to Richard Nixon, who was re-elected U.S. president. Despite supporting Nixon over McGovern, many American voters [[split ticket|split their ticket]]s, returning a Democratic majority to both houses of Congress.

On 15 March 1973, U.S. President [[Richard Nixon]] implied that the United States would intervene militarily if the communist side violated the ceasefire.  Public and congressional reaction to Nixon's trial balloon was unfavorable and in April Nixon appointed [[Graham Martin]] as U.S. ambassador to Vietnam. Martin was a second stringer compared to previous U.S. ambassadors and his appointment was an early signal that Washington had given up on Vietnam.  During his confirmation hearings in June 1973, [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[James R. Schlesinger]] stated that he would recommend resumption of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam if North Vietnam launched a major offensive against South Vietnam. On 4 June 1973, the U.S. Senate passed the [[CaseâChurch Amendment|Case-Church Amendment]] to prohibit such intervention.&lt;ref name = &quot;Karnow pp. 670-72&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|pp=670â72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oil price shock of October 1973 caused significant damage to the South Vietnamese economy. The Vietcong resumed offensive operations when dry season began and by January 1974 it had recaptured the territory it lost during the previous dry season. After two clashes that left 55 South Vietnamese soldiers dead, President Thiá»u announced on 4 January that the war had restarted and that the Paris Peace Accord was no longer in effect. There had been over 25,000 South Vietnamese casualties during the ceasefire period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/thieu-announces-war-has-resumed |title=This Day in History 1974: Thieu announces war has resumed |publisher=History.com |accessdate=17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gerald Ford]] took over as U.S. president on 9 August 1974 after President Nixon resigned due to the [[Watergate scandal]].  At this time, Congress cut financial aid to South Vietnam from $1 billion a year to $700 million. The U.S. midterm elections in 1974 brought in a new Congress dominated by Democrats who were even more determined to confront the president on the war. Congress immediately voted in restrictions on funding and military activities to be phased in through 1975 and to culminate in a total cutoff of funding in 1976.

The success of the 1973â74 dry season offensive inspired TrÃ  to return to Hanoi in October 1974 and plead for a larger offensive in the next dry season. This time, TrÃ  could travel on a drivable highway with regular fueling stops, a vast change from the days when the Ho Chi Minh Trail was a dangerous mountain trek.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 676&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=676}}&lt;/ref&gt; GiÃ¡p, the North Vietnamese defense minister, was reluctant to approve TrÃ 's plan. A larger offensive might provoke a U.S. reaction and interfere with the big push planned for 1976. TrÃ  appealed over GiÃ¡p's head to first secretary [[Le Duan|LÃª Duáº©n]], who approved of the operation.

TrÃ 's plan called for a limited offensive from Cambodia into [[Phuoc Long Province]]. The strike was designed to solve local logistical problems, gauge the reaction of South Vietnamese forces, and determine whether U.S. would return to the fray.

On 13 December 1974, North Vietnamese forces attacked Route 14 in Phuoc Long Province. Phuoc Binh, the provincial capital, fell on 6 January 1975. Ford desperately asked Congress for funds to assist and re-supply the South before it was overrun. Congress refused. The fall of Phuoc Binh and the lack of an American response left the South Vietnamese elite demoralized.

The speed of this success led the Politburo to reassess its strategy. It was decided that operations in the Central Highlands would be turned over to General [[Van Tien Dung|VÄn Tiáº¿n DÅ©ng]] and that Pleiku should be seized, if possible. Before he left for the South, DÅ©ng was addressed by LÃª Duáº©n: &quot;Never have we had military and political conditions so perfect or a strategic advantage as great as we have now.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Clark Dougan, David Fulgham et al., ''The Fall of the South.'' Boston: Boston Publishing Company, 1985, p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of 1975, the South Vietnamese had three times as much artillery and twice the number of tanks and armoured cars as the opposition. They also had 1,400 aircraft and a two-to-one numerical superiority in combat troops over their Communist enemies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/kolko04292005.html The End of the Vietnam War, 30 Years Ago] by [[Gabriel Kolko]], [[CounterPunch]] 30 April / 1 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the rising oil prices meant that much of this could not be used. They faced a well-organized, highly determined and well-funded North Vietnam. Much of the North's material and financial support came from the communist bloc. Within South Vietnam, there was increasing chaos. Their abandonment by the American military had compromised an economy dependent on U.S. financial support and the presence of a large number of U.S. troops. South Vietnam suffered from the global recession that followed the [[1973 oil crisis|Arab oil embargo]].

===Campaign 275===
{{Ref improve section|date=May 2008}}
On 10 March 1975, General Dung launched Campaign 275, a limited offensive into the Central Highlands, supported by tanks and heavy artillery. The target was [[BuÃ´n Ma Thuá»t]], in [[Äáº¯k Láº¯k Province]]. If the town could be taken, the provincial capital of [[Pleiku]] and the road to the coast would be exposed for a planned campaign in 1976. The ARVN proved incapable of resisting the onslaught, and its forces collapsed on 11 March. Once again, Hanoi was surprised by the speed of their success. Dung now urged the Politburo to allow him to seize Pleiku immediately and then turn his attention to [[Kon Tum]]. He argued that with two months of good weather remaining until the onset of the monsoon, it would be irresponsible to not take advantage of the situation.

President [[Nguyen Van Thieu|Nguyá»n VÄn Thiá»u]], a former general, was fearful that his forces would be cut off in the north by the attacking communists; Thieu ordered a retreat. The president declared this to be a &quot;lighten the top and keep the bottom&quot; strategy. But in what appeared to be a repeat of [[Operation Lam Son 719]], the withdrawal soon turned into a bloody rout. While the bulk of ARVN forces attempted to flee, isolated units fought desperately. ARVN General Phu abandoned Pleiku and Kon Tum and retreated toward the coast, in what became known as the &quot;column of tears&quot;.

As the ARVN tried to disengage from the enemy, refugees mixed in with the line of retreat. The poor condition of roads and bridges, damaged by years of conflict and neglect, slowed Phu's column. As the North Vietnamese forces approached, panic set in. Often abandoned by the officers, the soldiers and civilians were shelled incessantly. The retreat degenerated into a desperate scramble for the coast. By 1 April the &quot;column of tears&quot; was all but annihilated.

On 20 March, Thieu reversed himself and ordered Huáº¿, Vietnam's third-largest city, be held at all costs, and then changed his policy several times. Thieu's contradictory orders confused and demoralized his officer corps. As the North Vietnamese launched their attack, panic set in, and ARVN resistance withered. On 22 March, the VPA opened the siege of Huáº¿. Civilians flooded the airport and the docks hoping for any mode of escape. Some even swam out to sea to reach boats and barges anchored offshore. In the confusion, routed ARVN soldiers fired on civilians to make way for their retreat.

On 25 March, after a three-day battle, Huáº¿ fell. As resistance in Huáº¿ collapsed, North Vietnamese rockets rained down on [[Da Nang]] and its airport. By 28 March, 35,000 VPA troops were poised to attack the suburbs. By 30 March 100,000 leaderless ARVN troops surrendered as the VPA marched victoriously through Da Nang. With the fall of the city, the defense of the Central Highlands and Northern provinces came to an end.

===Final North Vietnamese offensive===
{{details|Ho Chi Minh Campaign|the final North Vietnamese offensive}}
With the northern half of the country under their control, the Politburo ordered General Dung to launch the final offensive against Saigon. The operational plan for the [[Ho Chi Minh Campaign]] called for the capture of Saigon before 1 May. Hanoi wished to avoid the coming monsoon and prevent any redeployment of ARVN forces defending the capital. Northern forces, their morale boosted by their recent victories, rolled on, taking Nha Trang, Cam Ranh, and Da Lat.

On 7 April, three North Vietnamese divisions attacked [[Battle of XuÃ¢n Lá»c|Xuan Loc]], 40 miles (64&amp;nbsp;km) east of Saigon. The North Vietnamese met fierce resistance at Xuan Loc from the [[18th Division (South Vietnam)|ARVN 18th Division]], who were outnumbered six to one.  For two bloody weeks, severe fighting raged as the ARVN defenders made a [[last stand]] to try to block the North Vietnamese advance. By 21 April, however, the exhausted garrison were ordered to withdraw towards Saigon.

An embittered and tearful President Thieu resigned on the same day, declaring that the United States had betrayed South Vietnam. In a scathing attack, he suggested U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger had tricked him into signing the Paris peace agreement two years ago, promising military aid that failed to materialise.
Having transferred power to [[Tran Van Huong]], he left for [[Taiwan]] on 25 April.  At the same time, North Vietnamese tanks had reached [[Bien Hoa]] and turned toward Saigon, brushing aside isolated ARVN units along the way.

By the end of April, the ARVN had collapsed on all fronts except in the [[Mekong Delta]]. Thousand of refugees streamed southward, ahead of the main communist onslaught. On 27 April 100,000 North Vietnamese troops encircled Saigon. The city was defended by about 30,000 ARVN troops. To hasten a collapse and foment panic, the VPA shelled the airport and forced its closure. With the air exit closed, large numbers of civilians found that they had no way out.

===Fall of Saigon===

{{Main|Fall of Saigon|Operation Frequent Wind}}
Chaos, unrest, and panic broke out as hysterical South Vietnamese officials and civilians scrambled to leave Saigon. [[Martial law]] was declared. American helicopters began evacuating South Vietnamese, U.S., and foreign nationals from various parts of the city and from the U.S. embassy compound. [[Operation Frequent Wind]] had been delayed until the last possible moment, because of U.S. Ambassador [[Graham Martin]]'s belief that Saigon could be held and that a political settlement could be reached.

Schlesinger announced early in the morning of 29 April 1975 the evacuation from [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] by helicopter of the last U.S. diplomatic, military, and civilian personnel. Frequent Wind was arguably the largest helicopter evacuation in history. It began on 29 April, in an atmosphere of desperation, as hysterical crowds of Vietnamese vied for limited space. Martin pleaded with Washington to dispatch $700 million in emergency aid to bolster the regime and help it mobilize fresh military reserves. But American public opinion had soured on this conflict.

In the United States, South Vietnam was perceived as doomed. President [[Gerald Ford]] had given a televised speech on 23 April, declaring an end to the Vietnam War and all U.S. aid. Frequent Wind continued around the clock, as North Vietnamese tanks breached defenses on the outskirts of Saigon. In the early morning hours of 30 April, the last U.S. Marines evacuated the embassy by helicopter, as civilians swamped the perimeter and poured into the grounds. Many of them had been employed by the Americans and were left to their fate.

[[File:NVA pose for picture in Presidential Palace at end of Vietnam war.jpgâ|thumb|upright|Victorious NVA troops at the Presidential Palace, Saigon.]]

On 30 April 1975, VPA troops overcame all resistance, quickly capturing key buildings and installations. A tank crashed through the gates of the [[Reunification Palace|Independence Palace]], and at 11:30 a.m. local time the NLF flag was raised above it. President [[Duong Van Minh]], who had succeeded Huong two days earlier, surrendered. His surrender marked the end of 116 years of Vietnamese involvement in conflict either alongside or against various countries, primarily France, China, Japan, Britain, and America.&lt;ref name=&quot;tucker29&quot;&gt;{{Cite book|last=Tucker |first=Spencer C. |title=Vietnam |page=29 |url=http://books.google.com/?id=WZry2NaH2_sC&amp;pg=PA29|format=[[Google Book Search]]|year=1999 |publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=0813109663 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other countries' involvement==
===Pro-Hanoi===
====People's Republic of China====
In 1950, the People's Republic of China extended [[diplomatic recognition]] to the [[Viet Minh]]'s [[North Vietnam|Democratic Republic of Vietnam]] and sent weapons, as well as military advisors led by [[Politics of Shanxi#List of Governors of Shanxi|Luo Guibo]] to assist the Viet Minh in its [[First Indochina War|war]] with the French. The first draft of the 1954 [[Geneva Conference (1954)|Geneva Accords]] was negotiated by French Prime Minister [[Pierre MendÃ¨s France]] and Chinese Premier [[Zhou Enlai]] who, fearing U.S. intervention, urged the Viet Minh to accept a partition at the [[17th parallel north|17th parallel]].&lt;ref&gt;Qiang Zhai, ''China and the Vietnam Wars, 1950â1975'', pp. 54â55.&lt;/ref&gt;

China's ability to aid the Viet Minh declined when Soviet aid to China was reduced following the end of the [[Korean War]] in 1953. Moreover, a divided Vietnam posed less of a threat to China. China provided material and technical support to the Vietnamese communists worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Chinese-supplied rice allowed North Vietnam to pull military-age men from the paddies and to impose a universal draft beginning in 1960.

In the summer of 1962, [[Mao Zedong]] agreed to supply Hanoi with 90,000 rifles and guns free of charge. Starting in 1965, China sent [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft]] units and [[engineering]] [[battalion]]s to North Vietnam to repair the damage caused by American bombing, rebuild roads and railroads, and to perform other engineering works. This freed North Vietnamese army units for combat in the South.

[[Sino-Soviet relations]] soured after the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia|Soviets invaded Czechoslovakia]] in August 1968. In October, the Chinese demanded North Vietnam cut relations with Moscow, but Hanoi refused.&lt;ref&gt;Ang, Cheng Guan, ''Ending the Vietnam War: The Vietnamese Communists' Perspective'', p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The Chinese began to withdraw in November 1968 in preparation for a clash with the Soviets, which occurred at [[Zhenbao Island]] in March 1969. The Chinese also began financing the [[Khmer Rouge]] as a counterweight to the Vietnamese communists at this time. China's withdrawal from Vietnam was completed in July 1970.&lt;ref name=&quot;Li p. 206&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Li|2007|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Khmer Rouge launched ferocious raids into Vietnam in 1975â1978. Vietnam responded with an invasion that toppled the Khmer Rouge. In response, China launched a brief, punitive [[Sino-Vietnamese War|invasion of Vietnam in 1979]].

====Soviet Union====
[[File:Leonid BreÅ¾nÄv (Bundesarchiv).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Leonid Brezhnev]] was the [[leader of the Soviet Union]] during the second half of the Vietnam War]]
[[Soviet Union|Soviet]] ships in the South China Sea gave vital early warnings to [[Viet Cong|NLF]] forces in South Vietnam.  The Soviet intelligence ships would pick up American [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52]] bombers flying from [[Okinawa Prefecture|Okinawa]] and [[Guam]].  Their airspeed and direction would be noted and then relayed to [[COSVN]] headquarters.  COSVN using airspeed and direction would calculate the bombing target and tell any assets to move &quot;perpendicularly to the attack trajectory.&quot;  These advance warning gave them time to move out of the way of the bombers and while the bombing runs caused extensive damage, because of the early warnings from 1968â1970 they did not kill a single military or civilian leader in the headquarter complexes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Truong p. 168&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Truong|1985|p=168}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet Union supplied North Vietnam with medical supplies, arms, tanks, planes, helicopters, artillery, anti-aircraft missiles and other military equipment. Soviet crews fired USSR-made [[surface-to-air missile]]s at the [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52 bombers]], which were the first raiders shot down over Hanoi. Fewer than a dozen Soviet citizens lost their lives in this conflict. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russian officials acknowledged that the Soviet Union had stationed up to 3,000 troops in Vietnam during the war.&lt;ref name=&quot;historicaltextarchive.com.Soviet&quot;&gt;{{Cite news|ref=harv|year= 2010 |url = http://historicaltextarchive.com/sections.php?action=read&amp;artid=180|title = Soviet Involvement in the Vietnam War| agency = Associated Press |publisher = historicaltextarchive.com| accessdate = 27 March 2010|last=[[Associated Press|AP]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Russian sources give more specific numbers: the hardware donated by the USSR included 2,000 tanks, 7,000 artillery guns, over 5,000 anti-aircraft guns, 158 surface-to-air rocket launchers. Over the course of the war the Soviet money donated to the Vietnamese cause was equal to 2 million dollars a day. From July 1965 to the end of 1974, fighting in Vietnam was attended by some 6,500 officers and generals, as well as more than 4,500 soldiers and sergeants of the Soviet Armed Forces. In addition, military schools and academies of the USSR began training Vietnamese soldiers â more than 10 thousand people.&lt;ref name=&quot;rus.ruvr.ru&quot;&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|date= 29 January 2010 |url = http://rus.ruvr.ru/2010/01/29/3985810.html | title = Soviet rocketeer: After our arrival in Vietnam, American pilots refused to fly|publisher = rus.ruvr | location = RU | language = Russian | accessdate = 26 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====North Korea====
As a result of a decision of the [[Workers' Party of Korea|Korean Workers' Party]] in October 1966, in early 1967 [[North Korea]] sent a fighter squadron to North Vietnam to back up the North Vietnamese 921st and 923rd fighter squadrons defending Hanoi. They stayed through 1968, and 200 pilots were reported to have served.&lt;ref&gt;Asia Times, 18 August 2006, Richard M Bennett [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Korea/HH18Dg02.html Missiles and madness].&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, at least two anti-aircraft artillery regiments were sent as well.

====Cuba====
The extent of manpower contributions to North Vietnam by the communist [[Cuba|Republic of Cuba]], under [[Fidel Castro]], is still a matter of debate. Then and since, the communist Vietnamese and Cuban governments have not divulged any information on this matter. There are numerous reports by former U.S. [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] that Cuban military personnel were present at North Vietnamese prison facilities during the war, and that they participated in torture activities, in what is known as the &quot;Cuba Program&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aiipowmia.com/testimony/cubanews1.html AII POW-MIA Cuban Torture].

On the [[anti-communism|anti-communist]] side, [[South Korea]] had the second-largest contingent of foreign troops in South Vietnam after the United States. In November 1961, [[Park Chung Hee]] proposed South Korean participation in the war to John F. Kennedy, but Kennedy disagreed.&lt;ref name=ParkChungHeeEra/&gt; On May 1, 1964 [[Lyndon Johnson]] requested South Korean participation.&lt;ref name=ParkChungHeeEra&gt;{{cite book |last= Chang |first= Jae Baik |title= The Park Chung Hee Era: The Transformation of South Korea |publisher= Harvard University Press |year=2011|page=409 |ISBN= 0674058208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first South Korean troops began arriving in 1964 and large combat battalions began arriving a year later, with the South Koreans soon developing a reputation for effectiveness. Indeed arguably, they conducted counterinsurgency operations so well that American commanders felt that Korean area of responsibility was the safest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.talkingproud.us/International061406WhiteHorse.html |title=ROK Army and Marines prove to be rock-solid fighters and allies in Vietnam War |accessdate=3 February 2008 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070928035417/http://www.talkingproud.us/International061406WhiteHorse.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 320,000 South Korean soldiers were sent to Vietnam,&lt;ref name=donga20080702&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.donga.com/fbin/output?n=200807020125 |title=1965ë ì í¬ë³ ë² í¸ë¨ íë³ ìê²°|publisher=[[Donga Ilbo]] |accessdate=2011-07-17 |date=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; each serving a one year tour of duty. Maximum troop levels peaked at 50,000 in 1968, however all were withdrawn by 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Leepson 1999, p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt; About 5,000 South Koreans were killed and 11,000 were injured during the war. South Korea killed 41,000 Viet Congs.&lt;ref name=donga20080702/&gt; United States paid South Korean soldiers 235,560,000 dollars for their service in Vietnam,&lt;ref name=donga20080702/&gt; and South Korean [[GNP]] increased five times during the war.&lt;ref name=donga20080702/&gt;

====Australia and New Zealand====
[[File:RAR Vietnam.jpg|thumb|upright|An Australian soldier in Vietnam]]
{{Main|Military history of Australia during the Vietnam War|New Zealand in the Vietnam War}}
Australia and New Zealand, close allies of the United States and members of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]] (SEATO) and the [[ANZUS]] military co-operation treaty, sent ground troops to Vietnam. Both nations had gained experience in counterinsurgency and jungle warfare during the [[Malayan Emergency]] and World War II. Their governments subscribed to the [[Domino theory]]. Australia began by sending advisors to Vietnam in 1962, and combat troops were committed in 1965.&lt;ref name=Dennis&gt;Dennis et al 2008, pp. 555â558.&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand began by sending a detachment of engineers and an artillery battery, and then started sending special forces and regular infantry which were attached to Australian formations.&lt;ref&gt;McGibbon 2000, pp. 561â566.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia's peak commitment was 7,672 combat troops and New Zealand's 552.

====Philippines====
Some 10,450 [[Philippines|Filipino]] troops were dispatched to South Vietnam. They were primarily engaged in medical and other civilian pacification projects. These forces operated under the designation PHLCAG-V or Philippine Civic Action Group-Vietnam.

====Thailand====
[[Thailand|Thai]] Army formations, including the &quot;Queen's Cobra&quot; battalion, saw action in South Vietnam between 1965 and 1971. Thai forces saw much more action in the covert war in Laos between 1964 and 1972, though Thai regular formations there were heavily outnumbered by the irregular &quot;volunteers&quot; of the CIA-sponsored Police Aerial Reconnaissance Units or PARU, who carried out reconnaissance activities on the western side of the Ho Chi Minh Trail.

====Republic of China (Taiwan)====
{{Main|Republic of China in the Vietnam War}}
Since November 1967, the [[Republic of China]] ([[Taiwan]]) secretly operated a cargo transport detachment to assist the United States and the ROV.

Taiwan also provided military training units for the South Vietnamese diving units, later known as the Lien Doi Nguoi Nhai (LDMN) or ''Frogman unit'' in English.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoÃ¯se pp. 3-4&quot;/&gt; In addition to the diving trainers there were several hundred military personnel.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoÃ¯se pp. 3-4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|MoÃ¯se|1996|pp=3â4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Military commandos from Taiwan were captured by communist forces three times trying to infiltrate North Vietnam.&lt;ref name=&quot;MoÃ¯se pp. 3-4&quot;/&gt;

==Women in Vietnam==
===American nurses===
[[File:Da Nang, South Vietnam...United States Navy nurse Lieutenant Commander Joan Brouilette checks the condition of Pfc.... - NARA - 558531.tif|thumb|Da Nang, South Vietnam, 1968]]
During the Vietnam War, women served on active duty doing a variety of jobs. Early in 1963, the [[Army Nurse Corps (United States)|Army Nurse Corps]] (ANC) launched Operation Nightingale, an intensive effort to recruit nurses to serve in Vietnam. Most nurses who volunteered to serve in Vietnam came from predominantly working or middle class families with histories of military service. The majority of these women were white Catholics and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, Elizabeth M. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=esg7mGs6nQMC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Women%20at%20War%3A%20the%20Story%20of%20Fifty%20Military%20Nurses%20Who%20Served%20in%20Vietnam&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Women at War: the Story of Fifty Military Nurses Who Served in Vietnam]''. Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania, 1990. ISBN 978-0812213171 p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the need for medical aid was great, many nurses underwent a concentrated four-month training program before being deployed to Vietnam in the ANC &lt;ref&gt;Vuic, Kara Dixon. ''[http://books.google.com/books?id=E0nypXTQ_C4C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Officer%2C%20nurse%2C%20woman%3A%20the%20Army%20Nurse%20Corps%20in%20the%20Vietnam%20War&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Officer, Nurse, Woman: the Army Nurse Corps in the Vietnam War]''. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins UP, 2010. ISBN 978-0801893919 p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the shortage of staff, nurses usually worked twelve-hour shifts, six days per week and often suffered from exhaustion. [[First Lieutenant]] Sharon Lane was the only female military nurse to be killed by enemy gunfire during the war on June 8, 1969.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the Vietnam War, it was commonly thought that American women had no place in the military. Their traditional place had been in the domestic sphere, but with the war came opportunity for the expansion of gender roles. In Vietnam, women held a variety of jobs which included operating complex data processing equipment and serving as stenographers.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Jeanne. ''Women in the Military: an Unfinished Revolution''. Novato, CA: Presidio, 1992. ISBN 978-0891415138 p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a small number of women were assigned to combat zones, they were never allowed directly in the field of battle. The women who served in the military were solely volunteers. They faced a plethora of challenges, one of which was the relatively small number of female soldiers. Living in a male-dominated environment created tensions between the sexes. While this high male to female ratio was often uncomfortable for women, many men reported that having women in the field with them boosted their morale.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; Although this was not the womenâs purpose, it was one positive result of the their service.  By 1973, approximately 7,500 women had served in Vietnam in the Southeast Asian theater.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt; In that same year, the military lifted the prohibition on women entering the armed forces. 

American women serving in Vietnam were subject to societal stereotypes. Many Americans either considered female in Vietnam mannish for living under the army discipline, or judged them to be women of questionable moral character who enlisted for the sole purpose of seducing men.&lt;ref&gt;Vuic, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; To address this problem, the ANC released advertisements portraying women in the ANC as âproper, professional and well protected.â (26) This effort to highlight the positive aspects of a nursing career reflected the ideas of second-wave feminism that occurred during the 1960s-1970s in the United States. Although female military nurses lived in a heavily male environment, very few cases of sexual harassment were ever reported.&lt;ref&gt;Norman, p. 71.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2008, by contrast, approximately one-third of women in the military felt that they had been sexually harassed compared with one-third of men.

===Vietnamese women===

Unlike the American women who went to Vietnam, Vietnamese women fought in the combat zone as well as provided manual labor to keep the [[Ho Chi Minh Trail]] open; they also worked in the rice fields to provide food for their families and the war effort. Women were enlisted in both the North Vietnamese Army ([[NVA]]) and the [[VietCong]] guerrilla force in South Vietnam.

Nguyen Thi Dinh was an example of a woman who had fought most of her adult life against foreign forces in her country. She was a member of the Vietminh fighting against the French and was imprisoned in the 1940s but on her release continued to fight and led a revolt in 1945 in Ben Tre and also in 1960 against Diems government. In the mid 1960s, she became a deputy commander of the Viet Cong, the highest ranking combat position held by a woman during the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/WhoWasNguyenThiDinh.html |title=Who Was Nguyen Thi Dinh? |publisher=Facultystaff.richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nguyen Thi Duc Hoan, who would later go on to be an actress-director, also joined the fight at a young age and would later become a guerrilla fighter against the Americans, at the time her own daughter was training in the militia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebolt/history398/VietnameseWomenInTheWar.html |title=Vietnamese Women in the War: A Review |publisher=Facultystaff.richmond.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American M16, which replaced the M14, was considered more accurate and was lighter than the AK-47 but was prone to jamming. Oftentimes the gun suffered from a jamming flaw known as âfailure to extract,â which meant that a spent cartridge case remained lodged in the chamber after a bullet flew out the muzzle.&lt;ref name=Reliable&gt;{{cite journal|author=C.H.

U.S. air power was credited with breaking the siege of [[Battle of Khe Sanh|Khe Sanh]] and blunting the 1972 [[Easter Offensive|Communist offensive]] against South Vietnam. At sea, the U.S. Navy had the run of the coastline, using aircraft carriers as platforms for offshore strikes and other naval vessels for offshore artillery support.

[[Phnom Penh]], the capital of Cambodia, fell to followers of the [[Communist Party of Kampuchea]], commonly known as the Khmer Rouge, on 17 April 1975. Over the next four years, the Khmer Rouge enacted a genocidal policy that killed over one-fifth of all Cambodians, or more than a million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7321560.stm 'Killing Fields' journalist dies ]. BBC News. 30 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; After repeated border clashes in 1978, Vietnam invaded Democratic Kampuchea (Cambodia) and ousted the Khmer Rouge in the [[CambodianâVietnamese War]].

In response, China invaded Vietnam in 1979. The two countries fought a brief border war, known as the Third Indochina War or the [[Sino-Vietnamese War]]. From 1978 to 1979, some 450,000 ethnic [[Hoa|Chinese]] left Vietnam by boat as refugees or were expelled across the land border with China.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/4130.htm Vietnam (03/09)]. U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pathet Lao]] overthrew the royalist government of Laos in December 1975. They established the Lao People's Democratic Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/la.html#history |title = CIA â The World Factbook â Laos |accessdate = 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1975 to 1996, the United States resettled some 250,000 Lao refugees from Thailand, including 130,000 [[Hmong people|Hmong]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/2770.htm Laos (04/09)]. U.S. Department of State.&lt;/ref&gt;

More than 3 million people fled from Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia, many as &quot;[[boat people]]&quot;. Most Asian countries were unwilling to accept refugees.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.migrationinformation.org/Feature/display.cfm?id=733&amp;feed=rss Migration in the Asia-Pacific Region]&quot;. Stephen Castles, University of Oxford. Mark J. Miller, University of Delaware.

===Effect on the United States===
[[Image:Pentagon vietnam protests.jpg|thumb|Vietnam War protests at the Pentagon, October 1967]]
In the post-war era, Americans struggled to absorb the lessons of the military intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Gerdes (ed). ''Examining Issues Through Political Cartoons: The Vietnam War'' pp. 14â15.&lt;/ref&gt; As General [[Maxwell D. Taylor|Maxwell Taylor]], one of the principal architects of the war, noted &quot;first, we didn't know ourselves. We thought that we were going into another [[Korean War]], but this was a different country. Secondly, we didn't know our South Vietnamese allies...  And we knew less about North Vietnam.  Who was [[Ho Chi Minh]]?  Nobody really knew. So, until we know the enemy and know our allies and know ourselves, we'd better keep out of this kind of dirty business. It's very dangerous.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 23&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Karnow|1991|p =23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Taylor paraphrases Sun Tzu, ''[[The Art of War]]'', Samuel B. Griffith, trans. Oxford, UK. Oxford University Press, 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have suggested that &quot;the responsibility for the ultimate failure of this policy [America's withdrawal from Vietnam] lies not with the men who fought, but with those in Congress...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = http://replay.waybackmachine.org/20090331152606/http://www.vietnamwar.com/presidentnixonsrole.htm | archivedate = 2009-03-31 | url= http://www.vietnamwar.com/presidentnixonsrole.htm |title= President Richard Nixon's Role in the Vietnam War |publisher= Vietnam War | accessdate = 17 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternatively, the official history of the [[United States Army]] noted that &quot;[[military tactics|tactics]] have often seemed to exist apart from larger issues, strategies, and objectives.  Yet in Vietnam the Army experienced tactical success and strategic failure... The...Vietnam War...legacy may be the lesson that unique historical, political, cultural, and social factors always impinge on the military...Success rests not only on military progress but on correctly analyzing the nature of the particular conflict, understanding the enemy's strategy, and assessing the strengths and weaknesses of allies. A new humility and a new sophistication may form the best parts of a complex heritage left to the Army by the long, bitter war in Vietnam.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = iBiblio | chapter = 28 | url = http://www.ibiblio.org/pub/academic/history/marshall/military/vietnam/short.history/chap_28.txt | last = Demma | title = The U.S. Army in Vietnam}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Marine da nang.jpg|left|thumbnail|160px|A young [[United States Marine Corps|Marine]] private waits on the beach during the Marine landing, [[Da Nang]] August 3, 1965.]]
U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger wrote in a secret memo to President Gerald Ford that &quot;in terms of military tactics, we cannot help draw the conclusion that our armed forces are not suited to this kind of war. Even the Special Forces who had been designed for it could not prevail.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ford.utexas.edu/library/exhibits/vietnam/750512a.htm | title = Lessons of Vietnam â Secret Memoranda to The President of the United States by Secretary of State Henry Kissinger | date = ca.

Doubts surfaced as to the effectiveness of large-scale, sustained bombing. As [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] [[Harold Keith Johnson]] noted, &quot;if anything came out of Vietnam, it was that air power couldn't do the job.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buzzano&quot;&gt;Quoted in Bob Buzzano. {{cite web|url = http://www.commondreams.org/views/041700-106.htm |title = 25 Years After End of Vietnam War, Myths Keep Us from Coming to Terms with Vietnam |accessdate=11 June 2008 |publisher= The Baltimore Sun Times | date = 17 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even General William Westmoreland admitted that the bombing had been ineffective. As he remarked, &quot;I still doubt that the North Vietnamese would have relented.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buzzano&quot;/&gt;

The inability to bomb Hanoi to the bargaining table also illustrated another U.S. miscalculation. The North's leadership was composed of hardened communists who had been fighting for independence for thirty years. They had defeated the French, and their tenacity as both nationalists and communists was formidable.  Ho Chi Minh is quoted as saying, &quot;You can kill ten of my men for every one I kill of yours...But even at these odds you will lose and I will win.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Karnow p. 17&quot;&gt;{{harvnb|Karnow|1991|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:OperationHueCity1967wounded.jpg|thumb|2/5 Marine gets his wounds treated during operations in Hue City, 1968]]
The Vietnam War called into question the U.S. Army doctrine. Marine Corps General [[Victor H. Krulak]] heavily criticised Westmoreland's [[attrition warfare|attrition]] strategy, calling it &quot;wasteful of American lives... with small likelihood of a successful outcome.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Buzzano&quot;/&gt; As well, doubts surfaced about the ability of the military to train foreign forces.

Between 1965 and 1975, the United States spent $111 billion on the war ($686 billion in FY2008 dollars).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Chemical defoliation===
One of the most controversial aspects of the U.S. military effort in Southeast Asia was the widespread use of chemical [[defoliant]]s between 1961 and 1971. They were used to [[Wikt:defoliate|defoliate]] large parts of the countryside. These chemicals continue to change the landscape, cause diseases and birth defects, and poison the food chain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www1.va.gov/Agentorange/ |title = Agent Orange Home |accessdate = 11 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in the American military effort it was decided that since the enemy were hiding their activities under triple-canopy jungle, a useful first step might be to defoliate certain areas. This was especially true of growth surrounding bases (both large and small) in what became known as [[Operation Ranch Hand]]. Corporations like [[Dow Chemical Company]] and [[Monsanto]] were given the task of developing herbicides for this purpose.

The defoliants, which were distributed in drums marked with color-coded bands, included the &quot;[[Rainbow Herbicides]]&quot;â[[Agent Pink]], [[Agent Green]], [[Agent Purple]], [[Agent Blue]], [[Agent White]], and, most famously, [[Agent Orange]], which included [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]] as a by-product of its manufacture. About 12 million gallons (45,000,000&amp;nbsp;L) of Agent Orange were sprayed over Southeast Asia during the American involvement. A prime area of Ranch Hand operations was in the [[Mekong Delta]], where the U.S. Navy patrol boats were vulnerable to attack from the undergrowth at the water's edge.

[[File:Defoliation agent spraying.jpg|thumb|right|U.S. helicopter spraying chemical [[defoliant]]s in the [[Mekong Delta]], South Vietnam]]
In 1961 and 1962, the Kennedy administration authorized the use of chemicals to destroy rice crops. Between 1961 and 1967, the U.S. Air Force sprayed 20 million U.S. gallons (75,700,000&amp;nbsp;L) of concentrated herbicides over 6 million acres (24,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of crops and trees, affecting an estimated 13% of South Vietnam's land. In 1965, 42% of all herbicide was sprayed over food crops. Another purpose of herbicide use was to drive civilian populations into RVN-controlled areas.&lt;ref&gt;''Anatomy of a War'' by [[Gabriel Kolko]], ISBN 1-56584-218-9 pp. 144â145.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, the Vietnamese government estimates that there are over 4,000,000 victims of dioxin poisoning in Vietnam, although the United States government denies any conclusive scientific links between Agent Orange and the Vietnamese victims of dioxin poisoning. In some areas of southern Vietnam dioxin levels remain at over 100 times the accepted international standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/12/AR2006111201065.html |first=Anthony|last= Failoa|title='&amp;#39;In Vietnam, Old Foes Take Aim at War's Toxic Legacy'&amp;#39;|publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date=2006-11-13 |accessdate=2011-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Veterans Administration has listed [[prostate cancer]], [[lung cancer|respiratory cancers]], [[multiple myeloma]], [[Diabetes mellitus type 2]], [[B-cell lymphomas]], [[soft-tissue sarcoma]], [[chloracne]], [[porphyria cutanea tarda]], [[peripheral neuropathy]], and [[spina bifida]] in children of veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Although there has been much discussion over whether the use of these defoliants constituted a violation of the laws of war, the defoliants were not considered weapons, since exposure to them did not lead to immediate death or incapacitation.

===Casualties===

The number of military and civilian deaths from 1955 to 1975 is debated. Some reports fail to include the members of South Vietnamese forces killed in the final campaign, or the Royal Lao Armed Forces, thousands of Laotian and Thai irregulars, or Laotian civilians who all perished in the conflict. They do not include the tens of thousands of Cambodians killed during the civil war or the estimated one and one-half to two million that perished in the [[genocide]] that followed Khmer Rouge victory, or the fate of Laotian Royals and civilians after the [[Pathet Lao]] assumed complete power in Laos.

In 1995, the Vietnamese government reported that its military forces, including the NLF, suffered 1.1 million dead and 600,000 wounded during Hanoi's conflict with the United States. Civilian deaths were put at two million in the North and South, and economic [[War reparations|reparations]] were demanded.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Hanoi concealed the figures during the war to avoid demoralizing the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Popular culture==
{{See also|Vietnam War in film|Vietnam War in games|War in popular culture}}
The Vietnam War has been featured heavily in television, film, video games, and literature in the participant countries. The war also influenced a generation of musicians and songwriters in Vietnam and the United States, both anti-war and pro/anti-communist. The band [[Country Joe and the Fish]] recorded [[The &quot;Fish&quot; Cheer/I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag|&quot;I-Feel-Like-I'm-Fixin'-To-Die Rag&quot; / The &quot;Fish&quot; Cheer]] in 1965, and it became one of the most influential anti-Vietnam protest anthems.

[[Trinh Cong Son]] was a South Vietnamese songwriter famous for his anti-war songs.
