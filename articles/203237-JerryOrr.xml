Halliburton's major business segment is the '''Energy Services Group''' (ESG). ESG provides technical products and services for [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] exploration and production. Halliburton's former subsidiary, [[Kellogg, Brown and Root|KBR]], is a major construction company of [[Oil refinery|refineries]], [[oil fields]], [[pipeline transport|pipelines]], and [[chemical plant]]s. Halliburton announced on April 5, 2007 that it had finally broken ties with KBR, which had been its contracting, engineering and construction unit as a part of the company for 44 years.&lt;ref name=separation&gt;[http://www.halliburton.com/default/main/halliburton/eng/news/source_files/news.jsp?newsurl=/default/main/halliburton/eng/news/source_files/press_release/2007/corpnws_040507a.html ''&quot;Halliburton Completes Separation of KBR&quot;''] -  2007 Press Releases - Halliburton.com - April 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business overview ==
=== Locations ===
U.S. regional office locations are [[Anchorage, Alaska]]; [[Bakersfield, California]]; [[Denver, Colorado]]; [[Lafayette, Louisiana]]; [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]; [[Farmington, New Mexico]]; [[Naples, Utah]]; and [[Odessa, Texas]].

Major international offices are in [[Canada]], [[Mexico]], [[Venezuela]], [[Colombia]], [[Argentina]], [[Panama]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Algeria]], [[Angola]], [[Egypt]], [[Gabon]], [[Nigeria]], [[Cameroon]], [[Republic of Congo]], [[Libya]], [[Austria]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[United Kingdom]], [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Australia]], [[Russia]], [[China]], [[India]], [[Iran]], [[Thailand]], [[Malaysia]], [[Indonesia]], [[Vietnam]], [[Japan]], [[Singapore]], [[U.A.E.]], [[Oman]], [[Yemen]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Iraq]].

Worldwide technology centers are in [[Duncan, Oklahoma]]; [[Carrollton, Texas]]; [[Houston, Texas]]; [[Stavanger, Norway]]; [[Pune, India]]; and [[Singapore]].

=== Divisions ===
Energy Services (the company's historical cornerstone), [[formation evaluation]], digital and consulting solutions, production volume optimization, and fluid systems are the major business segments. These businesses continue to be profitable, and the company is one of the world's largest players in these service industries; [[Schlumberger Limited|Schlumberger]] is a close competitor, followed by [[Weatherford International]], and [[Baker Hughes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hoovers.com/free/co/burn.xhtml?ID=10697 |title=Halliburton competitors |publisher=Hoovers.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the acquisition of [[Dresser Industries]] in 1998, the [[KBR (company)|Kellogg-Brown &amp; Root]] division (in 2002 renamed to KBR) was formed by [[merger|merging]] Halliburton's Brown &amp; Root (acquired 1962) subsidiary and the M.W. Kellogg division of Dresser (which Dresser had merged with in 1988). KBR is a major international construction company, which is a highly volatile undertaking subject to wild fluctuations in revenue and [[profit (accounting)|profit]]. [[Asbestos]]-related litigation from the Kellogg acquisition caused the company to book more than [[United States dollar|US$]]4.0&amp;nbsp;billion in losses from 2002 through 2004.

As a result of the asbestos-related costs and staggering losses on the Barracuda Caratinga FPSO construction project based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, Halliburton lost approximately $900&amp;nbsp;million [[U.S. dollar|U.S.]] a year from 2002 through 2004. A final non-appealable settlement in the asbestos case was reached in January 2005 which allowed Halliburton subsidiary [[KBR (company)|KBR]] to exit Chapter 11 bankruptcy and returned the company to quarterly profitability. So, while Halliburton's revenues have increased because of its contracts in the Middle East, its bottom line continues to suffer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halliburtonwatch.org/news/kbr_sale.html |title=Halliburton may sell KBR to end public relations nightmare |publisher=Halliburtonwatch.org |date=September 24, 2004 |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting for investors and analysts in August 2004, a plan was outlined to divest the [[KBR (company)|KBR]] division through a possible [[Sales|sale]], [[Spin out|spin-off]] or [[initial public offering]]. Analysts at [[Deutsche Bank]] valued [[KBR (company)|KBR]] at up to $2.15&amp;nbsp;billion, while others believed it could be worth closer to $3&amp;nbsp;billion by 2005. [[KBR (company)|KBR]] became a separately listed company on April 5, 2007.&lt;ref name=separation/&gt;

== History ==
=== Early history (as HOWCO) ===

In 1919, Erle Halliburton started the New Method Oil Well Cementing Company.&lt;ref name=Yahoo_Hal&gt;{{cite web|url=http://finance.yahoo.com/q/pr?s=HAL|title=Halliburton Profile in Yahoo Finance | publisher=Yahoo Finance |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HAL Duncan.jpg|thumb|Halliburton Research Center in [[Duncan, Oklahoma]], the city which was the original headquarters of Halliburton Company.]]
[[File:HalliburtonBellaireBlvdOfficesHouston.JPG|thumb|Halliburton (Oak Park) offices in [[Westchase, Houston|Westchase]] and in [[Chinatown, Houston|Chinatown]] in [[Houston]]]]

In 1920, he brought a wild gas well under control, using cement, for W.G. Skelly, near [[Wilson, Oklahoma]].&lt;ref name=EPMag&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epmag.com/archives/oilFieldHistory/407.htm |title=EP Magazine: Cementing is not for sissies; E&amp;P Magazine |publisher=EPMag.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 1, 1921, the Halliburton âmethod and means of excluding water from oil wellsâ was assigned a patent from the [[U.S. Patent Office]]. Halliburton invented the revolutionary cement jet mixer, to eliminate hand-mixing of cement, and the measuring line, a tool used to guarantee cementing accuracy.&lt;ref name=EPMag/&gt; By 1922, the Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Company (HOWCO) was prospering from the [[Mexia, Texas]] oil boom, cementing its 500th well in late summer.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend&gt;{{cite book | last = Rodengen | first = Jeffrey | authorlink = http://books.google.com/books?as_auth=Jeffrey+L+Rodengen&amp;source=an&amp;ei=YJjYSt-JMozf8Qbw78i3BQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_group&amp;ct=title&amp;cad=author-navigational&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CB8QsAMwAw | title = The Legend of Halliburton | location = USA | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-945903-16-1 | publisher = Write Stuff Syndicate }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, the company was incorporated in [[Delaware]], with 56 people on  its payroll. The stock of the corporation was owned by Erle and [[Vida Halliburton]] and by seven major oil companies: Magnolia, Texas, Gulf, Humble, Sun, Pure and Atlantic.&lt;ref name=TSHA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/HH/doh8.html |title=The Handbook of Texas Online; TSHA Online |publisher=TSHA.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, its first foreign venture began with sale of equipment to [[Burma]] and [[India]].&lt;ref name=Egypt_Oil&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptoil-gas.com/read_article_issues.php?MID=21&amp;arch=true&amp;AID=28 |title=Halliburton: The legacy of Erle; Egypt Oil &amp; Gas|publisher=egyptoil-gas.com |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the 1930s and 1940s, Halliburton continued cementing across America.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;&lt;ref name=AAPG&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.datapages.com/data/bulletns/1931-37/data/pg/0021/0004/0500/0500.htm |title=Cunningham Field, Kingman and Pratt Counties, Kansas; Bulletin of The American Association of Petroleum Geologists |publisher=American Association of Petroleum Geologists |date= |accessdate=October 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938, Halliburton cemented its first offshore well using a truck on a barge off the Louisiana coast.&lt;ref name=Egypt_Oil/&gt; In 1940, Halliburton opened offices in Venezuela and introduced bulk handling of cementing to the industry.&lt;ref name=TSHA/&gt; In 1947, the Halliburton first marine cementing vessel went into service.&lt;ref name=EPMag/&gt;

In 1951, Halliburton first appeared in Europe as Halliburton Italiana SpA, a wholly owned subsidiary in Italy. Over the next seven years, Halliburton launched Halliburton Company Germany GmbH, set up operations in Argentina and established a subsidiary in England. By 1951, HOWCO had service centers operating in Canada, Venezuela, Peru, Colombia, Saudi Arabia and Indonesia.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; Halliburton revenues top $100&amp;nbsp;million for the first time in 1952.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

Erle P. Halliburton died in [[Los Angeles]] in 1957. HOWCO is at this time worth $190&amp;nbsp;million with camps all over the world. The same year, HOWCO purchased Welex, which pioneered jet perforation.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; [[Otis Engineering]], an oil field service and equipment company specializing in manufacturing pressure control equipment for oil and gas producing wells, was acquired in 1959.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

=== As Halliburton ===
On July 5, 1961, the company changed its name to the Halliburton Company. In 1963, Halliburton was the first company in Oklahoma to receive the Presidential âEâ for Export flag in recognition of notable contributions to foreign trade.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

Halliburton opened a {{convert|500000|sqft|m2|abbr=on}} manufacturing center in [[Duncan, Oklahoma]], in 1964.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; The company began to experiment with new technologies to help their services â for example, beginning in 1965 a pilot operation of a computer network system â the first such installation in the oilfield services industry.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; In 1966, Workers break ground for a new wing at the Research Center in Duncan that triples the space for the Chemical Research and Design Department.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;
In 1968, an automated mixing system for drilling mud is developed by Halliburton, primarily for use offshore.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; [[Gearhart]] Industries (acquired by Halliburton Energy Services in 1989) introduced the first digital computer logging system in 1974.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

In 1969, Halliburton began construction of a base camp at [[Prudhoe Bay]] on [[Alaska]]âs North Slope.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

In 1975, it responded to environmental concerns by working with the nonprofit Clean Gulf Associates to contain and clean up oil spills.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; In 1976, Halliburton established the Halliburton Energy Institute in Duncan, Oklahoma, to provide an industry forum for disseminating technical information.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

[[File:Lincoln Plaza.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Lincoln Plaza]] in [[Downtown Dallas]], which at one time housed the Halliburton headquarters]]
In 1980, Halliburton Research Center opens in Duncan, Oklahoma.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt; The company's billionth sack of cement for customers was pumped in 1983.&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

In 1989, Halliburton acquired logging and perforating specialist company [[Gearhart Industries]] and combined it with its subsidiary [[Welex]] to form [[Halliburton Logging Services]].

Throughout the 1980s, Halliburton's subsidiaries continued their projects around the world (under management of former CEO Brian Darcy) even in countries once considered enemies. Equipment was provided for the first multiwell platform offshore [[China]], and an Otis Engineering team controlled a gigantic Tengiz field blowout in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name=Hal_Legend/&gt;

=== 1990s ===
Following the end of [[Operation Desert Storm]] in February 1991, [[the Pentagon]], led by then defense secretary [[Richard Cheney|Dick Cheney]], paid Halliburton subsidiary [[KBR (company)|Brown &amp; Root Services]] over $8.5&amp;nbsp;million to study the use of private military forces with American soldiers in combat zones.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soldiers of Good Fortune&quot;&gt;{{cite news|last=Yeoman|first=Barry|title=Soldiers of Good Fortune|publisher=Mother Jones|date=June 1, 2003|url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2003/05/ma_365_01.html|accessdate=May 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halliburton crews also helped bring 725 burning oil wells under control in [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-11-02/news/mn-702_1_kuwait-fire |title= Kuwait Firefighters Blow Off Steam as Mission Ends |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date= November 2, 1991|accessdate=November 2, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Cheney replaced [[Thomas H. Cruikshank]], as [[chairman]] and [[CEO]].  Cruikshank had served since 1989.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/07/business/the-right-choice-for-the-job.html?pagewanted=all |title=The Right Choice for the Job? |publisher=The New York Times |date= September 7, 1995|accessdate=September 7, 1995 | first=Judith H. | last=Dobrzynski}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s, Halliburton was found to be in violation of federal trade barriers in [[Iraq]] and [[Libya]], having sold these countries [[dual-use technology|dual-use]] oil drilling equipment and, through its former subsidiary, Halliburton Logging Services, sending six [[pulse neutron generator]]s to Libya.  After having pleaded guilty, the company was fined $1.2&amp;nbsp;million, with another $2.61&amp;nbsp;million in penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/government/government-bodies-offices/7148553-1.html |title=HALLIBURTON ANNOUNCES AGREEMENTS TO SETTLE EXPORT INVESTIGATION. &amp;#124; Government &gt; Government Bodies &amp; Offices from AllBusiness.com |publisher=AllBusiness.com&lt;! |date= |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Balkans]] conflict in the 1990s, [[KBR (company)|Kellogg Brown-Root (KBR)]] supported U.S. peacekeeping forces in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]] and [[Hungary]] with food, laundry, transportation, and other life-cycle management services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cryptome.org/dod-kbr.htm |title=Halliburton's KBR defence contracts |publisher=Cryptome.org |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Halliburton merged with [[Dresser Industries]], which included Kellogg. [[Prescott Bush]] was a director of [[Dresser Industries]], which is now part of Halliburton; his son, former president [[George H. W. Bush]], worked for Dresser Industries in several positions from 1948 to 1951, before he founded [[Zapata Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.famoustexans.com/georgebush.htm |title=George Bush |publisher=Famoustexans.com |date= |accessdate=December 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' reported in 2001 that a subsidiary of Halliburton Energy Services called Halliburton Products and Services Ltd. (HPS) opened an office in [[Tehran]]. The company, HPS, operated on the ninth floor of a new north Tehran tower block. Although HPS was incorporated in the [[Cayman Islands]] in 1975 and is &quot;non-American&quot;, it shares both the logo and name of Halliburton Energy Services and, according to [[Dow Jones Newswires]], offers services from Halliburton units worldwide through its Tehran office. Such behavior, undertaken while Cheney was CEO of Halliburton, may have violated the [[Trading with the Enemy Act]]. A Halliburton spokesman, responding to inquiries from [[Dow Jones]], said &quot;This is not breaking any laws. This is a foreign subsidiary and no U.S. person is involved in this. No U.S. person is facilitating any transaction. We are not performing directly in that country.&quot; Later Dave Lesar would book his own flights to the Tehran office through the UK arm of [[KBR (company)|KBR]]. No legal action has been taken against the company or its officials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ratical.org/ratville/CAH/linkscopy/HCtOiI.html Halliburton Connected to Office in Iran, Dow Jones, 2/1/01].&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2002, KBR was awarded a $7&amp;nbsp;million contract to construct steel holding cells at [[Camp X-Ray]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=âBy Nicholas M. Horrock and Anwar Iqbal |url=http://www.motherjones.com/news/outfront/2004/01/12_400.html |title=Waiting for Gitmo |publisher=Motherjones.com |date= |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1995 to 2002, Halliburton Brown &amp; Root Services Corp was awarded at least $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion but has spent considerably less to construct and run military bases, some in secret locations, as part of the Army's Logistics Civil Augmentation Program. This contract was a cost plus 13% contract and BRS employees were trained on how to pass [[GAO]] audits to ensure maximum profits were attained. It was also grounds for termination in the [[Balkans]] if any BRS employee spoke of [[Dick Cheney]]'s being CEO. BRS was awarded and re-awarded contracts termed &quot;noncompetitive&quot; because BRS was the only company capable of pulling off the missions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} [[DynCorp]] actually won the competitively let second contract, but never received any work orders in the Balkans.&lt;ref name=&quot;Soldiers of Good Fortune&quot; /&gt;

In November 2002, KBR was tasked to plan oil well firefighting in Iraq, and in February 2003 was issued a contract to conduct the work. Critics contend that it was a [[no-bid contract]], awarded due to Dick Cheney's position as vice president. Concern was also expressed that the contract could allow KBR to pump and distribute Iraqi oil.&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract, referred to as LOGCAP, is a contingency-based contract that is invoked at the convenience of the Army.  Because the contract is essentially a retainer, specific orders are not competitively bid (as the overall contract was).

In May 2003, Halliburton revealed in [[SEC filings]] that its [[KBR (company)|KBR]] subsidiary had paid a [[Nigeria]]n official $2.4&amp;nbsp;million in [[bribery|bribes]] in order to receive favorable [[tax]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2003/05/10/1052280472817.html |title=Halliburton firm bribed Nigeria - theage.com.au |publisher=Theage.com.au |date=May 10, 2003 |accessdate=September 5, 2009 | location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ivanovich, David. &quot;[http://web.archive.org/web/20030511113527/http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/ssistory.mpl/business/1902750 KBR reports bribes paid to Nigeria].&quot; ''[[Houston Chronicle]]''.

In October 2004, Halliburton opened a new {{convert|250000|sqft|m2|sing=on}} facility on {{convert|35|acre|m2}}, replacing an older facility that opened in 1948, in [[Rock Springs, Wyoming]]. With over approximately 500 employees, Halliburton is one of the largest private employers in [[Sweetwater County, Wyoming|Sweetwater County]].&lt;ref&gt;who owns 100% of Service Employers International Inc. which KBR is a head hunter for.

On January 24, 2006, Halliburton's subsidiary [[KBR (company)|KBR]] (formerly Kellogg, Brown and Root) announced that it had been awarded a $385&amp;nbsp;million contingency contract by the [[Department of Homeland Security]] to build &quot;temporary detention and processing facilities&quot; or [[internment]] camps. According to ''[[Business Wire]]'', this contract will be executed in cooperation with the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]], [[Fort Worth]] District. Critics point to the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] as a possible model. According to a press release posted on the Halliburton website, &quot;The contract, which is effective immediately, provides for establishing temporary detention and processing capabilities to augment existing [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) Detention and Removal Operations (DRO) Program facilities in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants into the U.S., or to support the rapid development of new programs.

In February 2008, a hard disk and two computers containing classified information were stolen from Petrobras while in Halliburton's custody. Allegedly, the content inside the stolen material was data on the recently discovered [[Tupi oil field]]. Initial police inquiries suggest that it could be a common container theft operation. The container was a ramshackle in complete disorder indicating that thieves were after &quot;valuables and not only laptops,&quot; said an expert consulted by the daily newspaper Folha de S. Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://noticias.uol.com.br/ultnot/2008/02/14/ult23u1166.jhtm |title=PolÃ­cia Federal investiga furto de dados sigilosos da Petrobras - 14/02/2008 - UOL Ãltimas NotÃ­cias |publisher=Noticias.uol.com.br |date=February 14, 2008 |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14, 2010, President [[Barack Obama]] said in an interview with [[CNN]] that &quot;you had executives of BP and Transocean and Halliburton falling over each other to point the finger of blame at somebody else&quot; when referring to the congressional hearings held during the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]]. &quot;The American people could not have been impressed with that display, and I certainly wasn't.&quot; According to Tim Probert, executive vice president of Halliburton, âHalliburton, as a service provider to the well owner, is contractually bound to comply with the well owner's instructionsâ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pbs.org/nbr/site/onair/transcripts/gulf_oil_disaster_blame_100512/ |title=The Gulf Oil Disaster Blame Game |publisher=PBS.org |date= |accessdate=June 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans called for more oil to be exported from [[Iraq]]'s northern oil fields than actually occurred. Halliburtonâs work on the pipeline crossing the [[Tigris]] river at [[Al Fatah]] has been called a failure. Critics claim that the oil fields are barely usable and access to international markets is severely limited. As an example, against the advice of its own experts, Halliburton attempted to dig a tunnel through a geological [[fault zone]]. The underground terrain was a jumble of boulders, voids, cobblestones, and gravel and not appropriate for the kind of drilling Halliburton planned. &quot;No driller in his right mind would have gone ahead,&quot; said Army geologist [[Robert Sanders]] when the military finally sent people to inspect the work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/25/world/middleeast/25pipeline.html?_r=1&amp;pagewanted=1&amp;n=Top/News/World/Countries%20and%20Territories/Iraq&amp;oref=slogin|title=Rebuilding of Iraqi pipeline as disaster waiting to happen|author=James Glanz|date=April 25, 2006|accessdate=December 1, 2007 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PetroSkills Alliance==== 
In 2001 Halliburton joined the [[PetroSkills Alliance]]. Member companies came together to create detailed skill and Competency Maps, which act as a guide for the 200+ short courses, taught to industry professionals in over 40 locations worldwide. Competency Maps are an analysis tool and software application that allows users to assess their skills base to identify gaps in their training, areas needing improvement or mastered skill areas within upstream, downstream, and HSE petroleum subject disciplines.&lt;ref&gt; &quot;PetroSkills LLC: Private Company Information- BusinessWeek&quot;&gt;[http://investing.businessweek.com/businessweek/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=31072180]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversies===
Halliburton has become the object of several controversies involving the [[2003 Iraq War]] and the company's ties to former U.S. Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Cheney retired from the company during the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 U.S. presidential election]] campaign with a severance package worth $36&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,1150320,00.html |title=Halliburton suspends bill for army meals &amp;#124; World news &amp;#124; The Guardian |publisher=The Guardian&lt;! |date= February 18, 2004|accessdate=September 5, 2009 | location=London | first=David | last=Teather}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2004, he had received $398,548 in [[deferred compensation]] from Halliburton while Vice President.&lt;ref name=factcheck-cheney&gt;{{cite web

In the run-up to the Iraq war, Halliburton was awarded a $7&amp;nbsp;billion contract for which 'unusually' only Halliburton was allowed to bid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/7444083.stm |title=BBC uncovers lost Iraq billions |publisher=BBC |date=June 10, 2008 |accessdate=January 7, 2011 |first=Jane |last=Corbin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bunnatine Greenhouse]], a civil servant with 20 years of contracting experience, had complained to Army officials on numerous occasions that Halliburton had been unlawfully receiving special treatment for work in Iraq, [[Kuwait]] and the [[Balkans]]. Criminal investigations were opened by the U.S. Justice Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation ([[FBI]]) and the Pentagon's inspector general.

In one of Greenhouse's claims, she said that military auditors caught Halliburton overcharging the Pentagon for fuel deliveries into [[Iraq]]. She also complained that Defense Secretary [[Donald Rumsfeld]]'s office took control of every aspect of Halliburton's $7&amp;nbsp;billion Iraqi oil/infrastructure contract. After her testimony, Greenhouse was demoted for poor performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/29/international/middleeast/29halliburton.html |title=Army Contract Official Critical of Halliburton Pact Is Demoted  |publisher=The New York Times |date= August 29, 2005|accessdate=August 29, 2005 | first=Erik | last=Eckholm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Greenhouse's attorney, Michael Kohn, stated in ''[[The New York Times]]'' that &quot;she is being demoted because of her strict adherence to procurement requirements and the Army's preference to sidestep them when it suits their needs.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D03E3DE1631F93AA1575BC0A9639C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=all |publisher=The New York Times |title=REACH OF WAR: PROCUREMENT; Army Contract Official Critical of Halliburton Pact Is Demoted  |author=Erik Eckholm |date=August 29, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 8, 2010, an internal report released by [[BP]] into the [[Deepwater Horizon explosion|Deepwater Horizon Incident]] claimed that poor practices of Halliburton staff had contributed to the disaster.  Investigations carried out by the National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling found that Halliburton was jointly at fault along with BP and Transocean for the spill. The cement that Halliburton used was an unstable mixture, and eventually caused hydrocarbons to leak into the well, eventually causing the explosion that started  the crisis. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oilspillcommission.gov/sites/default/files/documents/FinalReportIntro.pdf |title=Deepwater Horizon  Accident Investigation Report |publisher=BP |date=September 8, 2010 |accessdate=September 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Environmental issues ====
In 2002, Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) reports were completed to measure the amount of chemicals emitted from Halliburton's [[Harris County, Texas]] facility.  The TRI is a publicly available EPA database that contains information on toxic chemical releases and waste management activities reported annually by certain industries as well as federal facilities.  The facility had 230 TRI air releases in 2001 and 245 in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scorecard.org/env-releases/facility.tcl?tri_id=77032HGHSD15815#major_chemical_releases  Environmental Release Report] - Scorecard&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 7, 2006, Halliburton's [[Farmington, New Mexico]] facility created a toxic cloud that forced people to evacuate their homes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abqjournal.com/news/state/apcloud06-07-06.htm &quot;Halliburton spill results in acid cloud.&quot;] - [[Associated Press]]. - (c/o ''[[Albuquerque Journal]]''.) - June 7, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Halliburton may also be implicated&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-oil-spill-investigation-20100501,0,2641014.story &quot;Halliburton in spotlight in gulf spill probe.&quot;] - [[Los Angeles Times]] - May 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; in the oil spills in the [[Montara oil spill|Timor Sea]] off [[Australia]] in August 2009 and in the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|Gulf of Mexico]] in April 2010 for improper cementing. Halliburton staff were employed on the Transocean operated [[Deepwater Horizon]] oil rig in the Mexican Gulf. Halliburton staff completed cementation of the final production well 20 hours prior to the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig explosion, but had not yet set the final [[cement plug]].&lt;ref&gt;Halliburton issues statement on Deepwater Horizon incident http://www.glgroup.com/News/Halliburton-issues-statement-on-Deepwater-Horizon-incident-48126.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamie Leigh Jones]] testified at a Congressional hearing that she had been gang-raped by as many as seven co-workers in Iraq in 2005 when she was an employee of KBR, and then falsely imprisoned in a shipping container for 24 hours without food or drink.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/2008/02/13/world/middleeast/13contractors.html?_r=1&amp;bl&amp;ex=1203051600&amp;en=bf8812ecc5524a95&amp;ei=5087%0A&amp;oref=slogin New York Times].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=think&gt;[http://thinkprogress.org/2009/09/16/jones-sue-kbr/ Court rules that KBR employeeâs gang rape wasnât a personal injury âarising in the workplace.â]&lt;/ref&gt; KBR was a subsidiary of Halliburton at the time. Jones and her lawyers said that 38 women have contacted her reporting similar experiences while working as contractors in Iraq, Kuwait, and other countries. On September 15, 2009, the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Jones, in a 2 to 1 ruling, and found that her alleged injuries were not, in fact, in any way related to her employment and thus, not covered by the contract.&lt;ref name=think/&gt;

These incidents have tainted the public perception of Halliburton, with a consumer study rating it as the 5th least reputable companies in America. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.com/2011/04/04/most-least-reputable-companies-leadership-sales-leadership_2.html |title=America's Most and Least Reputable Companies - Forbes |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=October 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sale of KBR ===
On April 15, 2006, Halliburton filed a registration statement with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] to sell up to 20 percent of its KBR stock on the [[NYSE]] under the ticker symbol &quot;KBR&quot;, as part of an eventual plan for KBR to be a separate company from Halliburton.&lt;ref&gt;http://library.corporate-ir.net/library/67/676/67605/items/199968/KBR_S1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, Halliburton began selling its stake in [[KBR (company)|KBR]], its major subsidiary, and by February 2007 had completely sold off the subsidiary. In June 2007, several days after Stewart Bowen, the Special Inspector General, released a new report, the Army announced that KBR would share another $150&amp;nbsp;billion contract with two other contractors, [[Fluor Corporation|Fluor]] and [[Dyncorp]], over the next 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/ousiv/idUSN2833255320070629 |title=KBR, Fluor, Dyncorp win US Army contract, shrs up &amp;#124; Reuters |publisher=Reuters&lt;! |date=June 28, 2007 |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Baghdad incident ===
In accordance with the [[law of armed conflict]] and to maintain [[non-combatant]] status, Halliburton does not arm its truck drivers. Trucks are often the target of [[Iraqi insurgency|insurgent]] attacks. On September 20, 2005, a convoy of four Halliburton trucks was ambushed north of Baghdad. All four trucks were struck by [[improvised explosive device]]s and were disabled. Their US National Guard escort was thought to have abandoned the disabled vehicles, leaving the drivers defenseless. Three of the four truck drivers were killed by the insurgents while the surviving driver, Preston Wheeler, caught the event on video. Although the trucks had military camouflage paint, the drivers were civilian. The US military returned to the scene 45&amp;nbsp;minutes later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Ross and Rhonda Schwartz Report: |url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/09/exclusive_us_tr.html |title=The Blotter: Exclusive: U.S. Troops Abandoned Me, Says Convoy Driver |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=September 27, 2006 |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a statement by senior military officials in Iraq, an investigation revealed that troops did not abandon the civilians and they were all exiting the &quot;kill zone&quot; during the ambush.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnf-iraq.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=6056&amp;Itemid=18 |title=Multi-National Force - Iraq - Leaders: reports 'false, inaccurate' |publisher=Mnf-iraq.com |date=September 30, 2006 |accessdate=September 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, Halliburton retained the North Belt office.&lt;ref&gt;Colley, Jenna. &quot;[http://houston.bizjournals.com/houston/stories/2003/06/23/story4.html New tax break may mean 'green' for Greenspoint].&quot; ''[[Houston Business Journal]]''.
