He coordinated CPG efforts with USCENTCOM (US Central Command) leadership to provide valuable international perspectives to ongoing planning and analysis, better capitalise on the intellectual capacity of select international officers by integrating them in to key theatre headquarters staff processes and products, and to develop and incorporate analytical constructs for use at the strategic-theatre level.
