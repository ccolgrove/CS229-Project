'''Mark Mitchell''' (born May 2, 1968) is an [[United States|American]] retired competitive [[Figure skating|figure skater]].

==Biography==
===Skating career===
Mitchell was the 1986 [[United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Junior National Champion]]. He won the bronze medal at the 1990 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], but was not named to the World team, despite the U.S. having three spots to that competition. Instead, a medical bye was given to [[Christopher Bowman]] who withdrew from the competition with a back injury. 

Mitchell finished 4th at the 1991 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], again just missing a spot on the World team.

In 1992, he won a bronze medal at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships]]. The US had three spots for the team to the [[1992 Winter Olympics]]. However, Mitchell was not placed on the team due to a medical bye given to [[Todd Eldredge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CEEDC113DF931A25752C0A964958260 Bowman Takes Title with Ease]&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitchell competed at the 1992 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], where he placed 5th, ahead of Eldredge.  

In 1993, he finished 2nd at the [[United States Figure Skating Championships]], and was selected for the World team.  At [[World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]], he received a perfect score of 6.0 for presentation in his short program,&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEED71538F932A25750C0A965958260 Mitchell Receives a Mark of Perfection]&lt;/ref&gt; and was in 2nd place after this portion  of the competition behind [[Kurt Browning]].  In the free skate, he fell to 4th place overall,&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D7113DF931A25750C0A965958260 Canadian Team Mixes Some More Gold With Ice]&lt;/ref&gt; and as a result, the United States had two spots for the [[1994 Winter Olympics]] because the rules at that time required a country to medal at the previous year's World Championships to have three spots to the Olympics. This rule has since been amended.

After the 1993 [[World Figure Skating Championships|Worlds]], Mitchell moved to [[Milan]], [[Italy]] to train with [[Carlo Fassi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9403E2DE1E3EF936A35752C0A962958260 Mitchell Takes a Shot at Reversing His Luck]&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell was vocal in his opposition to the reinstatement of professionals, such as [[Brian Boitano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CEFDB1E3EF936A15752C0A965958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=Mitchell Ex-Champions Haunt Skating Victors]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, at the 1994 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] he fell to 5th place and did not qualify for the [[1994 Olympics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/sports/longterm/olympics1998/history/timeline/articles/time_011694a.htm Beyond the Grace, Skating is a Steely Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mitchell turned professional following the 1993-1994 season.  Throughout his amateur and professional career, Mitchell toured with [[Champions on Ice]].

===Coaching career===
Mitchell currently works as a coach with former Swedish national champion [[Peter Johansson (figure skater)|Peter Johansson]] at the [[Skating Club of Boston]]. Their students include 2007 World Junior champion [[Stephen Carriere]], 2008 Eastern Sectional champion [[Katrina Hacker]], 2007 US National junior pewter medalist [[Curran Oi]], 2007 Eastern Sectional champion [[Kylie Gleason]], two time Junior Grand Prix gold medalist [[Juliana Cannarozzo]], 2008 US National junior bronze medalist [[Brittney Rizo]], 2007 Canadian Junior Champion [[Dana Zhalko|Dana Zhalko-Tytarenko]], and 2009 US National Junior Champion [[Ross Miner]].
