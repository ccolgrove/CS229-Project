}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Glyph'' received a preliminary Grammy nomination in the category of Best Alternative Performance. The album was initially intended to be an [[Extended play|EP]] featuring leftover songs that never made it onto the [[Sink (Floater album)|Sink]] album. Later, though, additional tracks were added, blending the entire album into one complete, seamless audio experience. The hit single is &quot;[[The Sad Ballad of Danny Boy]]&quot; which received national radio play on [[Z Rock]] stations.&lt;ref name=&quot;CASEY&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album is also the first time that Peter Cornett debuted a track featuring his vocals. ''Bottle'' would not be his last either, as he again appeared on the [[Acoustics (Floater album)|Acoustics]] album. Two covers of Glyph exist: the first cover, which had a very limited release, has the same artwork but the fonts appear to be a white Arial. The second cover, which is the most common, has a yellow/gold font and shows an [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|Egyptian hieroglyph]] which represents rejoicing, support, or exaltation.
