These two albums were initially released on the now defunct [[Barnaby Records]] label which Buffett left prior to signing with [[Dunhill Records|Dunhill]], a major label, and attaining mass popularity.  Due to their limited initial appeal, long periods out of general release, and stylistic differences with the rest of Buffett's work, these albums were often not considered part of the chronology of Buffett albums by fans or even Buffett himself.  However, especially from the late 1990s, they have been licensed to a number of minor record companies for re-release and there has been a proliferation of compilations including some or all of the songs from the albums.  The compilations and re-releases of the albums are presented chronologically by date of release below.  

==''Before the Salt''==

The first compilation of ''Down to Earth'' and ''High Cumberland Jubilee'' was '''''Before the Salt''''' in 1979.
