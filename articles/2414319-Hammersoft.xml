==Election Details==
===Retiring Democratic===
====Kathleen Blanco (Louisiana)====
{{main|Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2007}}
Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] announced on March 20, 2007 that she would not seek a second term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/us/AP-Louisiana-Governor.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Louisiana's Governor Won't Seek Re-election]&lt;/ref&gt; Blanco had taken flak for the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] and the government's ill-preparedness to deal with casualties.

Republican [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Bobby Jindal]] won about 54% of the vote in the October 20 [[jungle primary]], enough to avoid a run-off in November. His nearest opponent, Democratic State Senator [[Walter Boasso]], won about 17% of the vote; Independent [[New Orleans, Louisiana|New Orleans]] area businessman John Georges finished third with 14% of the vote, while Public Service Commissioner [[Foster Campbell]] (D) finished fourth with 12%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&amp;rqsdta=102007 Louisiana Secretary of State] Retrieved October 22, 2007 {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. Senator [[John Breaux]], arguably the most popular Democratic politician in Louisiana, had publicly flirted with entering the race in March and April 2007, but eventually declined to run due to the unresolved controversy over whether his recent [[Maryland]] residency made him ineligible to run.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailycomet.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070222/APN/702222671 Breaux's residency questioned amid rumors of possible candidacy]&lt;/ref&gt; After Breaux's announcement, Lieutenant Governor [[Mitch Landrieu]] also declined running.

Jindal led in fundraising with $11 million raised up to the end of September, with $4.3 million of that left for the remainder of the campaign. Georges has put $7 million of his own money into his campaign. Boasso had spent $4.7 million of his own money and had $144,000 in the bank.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nola.com/newsflash/louisiana/index.ssf?/base/news-35/1192118995187040.xml&amp;storylist=louisiana &quot;Jindal maintains wide lead in fundraising&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Republican incumbents===
====Ernie Fletcher (Kentucky)====
{{main|Kentucky gubernatorial election, 2007}}
Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] ran for reelection for a second term. Various polls indicated he had been very unpopular with an approval rating of 38%. Also, Fletcher's governorship had been embroiled in scandal due to the criminal indictment of several people in his administration for illegally hiring workers into the state merit system based on political considerations. Fletcher was challenged in the primary by [[Anne Northup]], a former [[U.S. Representative]] who served [[Kentucky's 3rd congressional district]] from 1997-2007, as well as [[Paducah, Kentucky|Paducah]] businessman Billy Harper. Underscoring the controversy over the hiring scandal, [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky|Lieutenant Governor]] [[Steve Pence]] chose not to run for reelection on the Fletcher ticket and publicly endorsed Northup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Pence endorses Northup for governor |publisher=[[The Courier-Journal]] |date= 2007-02-26 |url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070226/NEWS0104/70226014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Northup was endorsed by U.S. Senator [[Jim Bunning]].&lt;ref name=&quot;CincyPost Collins&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title= Bunning backs Northup for gov|author=Michael Collins|first=Michael|last=Collins|work=[[The Cincinnati Post|The Kentucky Post]]|location=[[Covington, Kentucky]]|publisher=[[E.

[http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070523/NEWS0106/70523009] Northup won the state's largest county, which contains [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], and her former congressional district, but lacked support at large; turnout in Jefferson County was not strong enough to make up for that.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070523/NEWS0106/70523009/1008/NEWS01|publisher=Courier-Journal|title=Fletcher beats Northup despite scandal|date=2007-05-23|author=Gerth, Joseph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large number of Democrats ran in the primary, including [[State Treasurer]] [[Jonathan Miller (politician)|Jonathan Miller]], former Lieutenant Governors [[Steve Beshear]] and [[Steve Henry]], businessman [[Bruce Lunsford]] and [[Kentucky House of Representatives]] Speaker [[Jody Richards]]. Lunsford spent over $4 million, much of it his own money; Miller dropped out of the race and endorsed Beshear.  Beshear won the primary with 142,516 votes (41%) in the crowded field; his next closest competitor was Lunsford with 21%.  Henry took 18% of the vote and Richards, 12%. In their election night concession speeches Lunsford, Henry and Richards each pledged their support to Beshear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courier-journal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=200770523008|title=Beshear's victory revives political career|author=Loftus, Tim|date=2007-05-23|publisher=Courier-Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the General Election on November 7, 2007, Beshear defeated Fletcher in his bid for reelection.  Beshear was inaugurated on December 11, 2007.

====Haley Barbour (Mississippi)====
{{main|Mississippi gubernatorial election, 2007}}
Governor [[Haley Barbour]] ran for a second term. Barbour was popular, with a 59% approval rating, and faced only a token primary challenge. Four Democratic candidates filed to face him in the general election including eventual nominee attorney [[John Arthur Eaves, Jr.|John Eaves]].

On election day, Barbour defeated Eaves garnering 58% of the vote.

==Total Results==
At the [[United States elections, 2007|2007 Gubernatorial Elections]], all 55 United States Governors' seats were occupied.
