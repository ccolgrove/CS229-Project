The '''1965  New South Wales  state election'''  was held on 1 May 1965. It  was conducted in single member constituencies with compulsory [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]] and  was held on boundaries created at a 1961 redistribution. The election was for all of the 94 seats in the  [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]].

==Issues==
In May 1965, Labor had been in power for 24 years and 54 year old [[Jack Renshaw]], who had been seen as a generational change for the party leadership had been premier for 1 year. However, Renshaw, had difficulty adjusting to a televised campaign and his manner, the result of spending much of his early life in remote New South Wales, had not resonated with urban voters. The longevity of the government was an issue promoted by the opposition which described it as being composed of &quot;tired old men&quot;. Continuing cost overruns and construction delays at the [[Sydney Opera House]] detracted from the government's economic management and accusations that the [[Speaker of the New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Speaker]], [[Ray Maher]] had indecently exposed himself to a staff member disrupted the start of the government's campaign. In addition, the government's keynote policy of releasing large tracts of land in Sydney for residential development was leaked to the opposition, which then claimed it as its own policy. Labor continued to have an ideological difficulty matching the Opposition's promises of state aid for non-government schools and this was the most decisive issue in the election. However, its other policies included increased high school bursaries, measures to reduce unfair trading, reduced power costs, increased sick leave and reform of Workers' Compensation schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Labor Policy offers 5,000 bursaries|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 9 April 1965 p1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Labor the leader of the conservative coalition, [[Robin Askin]] was skillful in his use of television and put forward a positive program. Promises for non-government schools included free transport, library grants, low interest loans, textbook subsidies and bursaries. Askin accused the state government of allowing the transport infrastructure of the state to decline and pledge his government to improve the Illawarra and Eastern Suburbs rail lines. He promised to integrate the state's bus and train fares and reduce suburban rail costs. Motor registry costs would be reduced and better rent control was to be introduced for pensioners Askin also promised to recruit more police and give more resources for mental health and district hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Points from policy speech|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 14 April 1965 p1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
Prior to the election, Independent [[Frank Purdue]] had gained the seat of [[Electoral district of Waratah (New South Wales)|Waratah]] from the Labor Party  at a [[Waratah state by-election, 1964|by-election]] caused by the death of [[Edward Greaves]]. [[Sam Jones (Australian politician)|Sam Jones]] regained the seat for Labor at the general election.

Despite a strong swing of more than 5% to the coalition, the result of the election remained in doubt for 2 weeks. The effects of a long incumbency bolstered by the cumulative effects of a number of re-distributions limited Labor's loss of seats to 9. In several of these the margin of defeat was less than 300 votes. In the final result the Coalition had 47 seats, one short of a majority. However, it could rely on the support of [[Douglas Darby]] a former member of the party who had been elected as a Liberal Independent but was subsequently readmitted to the party room and [[Harold Coates]], a conservative independent who had won the seat of [[Electoral district of Hartley (New South Wales)|Hartley]]. After providing a Speaker, the coalition was able to form a government with a majority of 3 in the Assembly.

* [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] 31 seats
* Independent Liberal 1 seat
* [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] 16 seats
* [[Australian Labor Party]] 45 seats
* Independent 1 seat

The DLP contested 28 seats and, while it gained less than 2.5% of the state-wide primary vote, its preferences strongly favoured the coalition and were vital to its success.  The Communist party was reduced to 13 candidates who received negligible support.
