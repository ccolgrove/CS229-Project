'''Ugo Volt''' is a game by RogÃ©rio Varela, set in the 22nd century, in a post-apocalyptic [[Lisbon]], almost destroyed by [[global warming]]. It was also the first [[Portugal|Portuguese]] game to be featured at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release | url=http://www.gesventure.pt/em_destaque/move_interactive.pdf | title=PRIMEIRA EMPRESA PORTUGUESA A EXPÃR NA E3 | publisher=[[Move Interactive]] | date=2006-05-05 | format=PDF | language=Portuguese | accessdate=2007-12-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With no news from the game since 2007, with the website now under control of a third-party, and with the official website of the company non-operational for some time (as of 2010), it is assumed the game was either cancelled or is not in active development anymore.
