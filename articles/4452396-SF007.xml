'''DirectX Media''' is a set of [[multimedia]]-related [[API]]s for [[Microsoft Windows]] complementing [[DirectX]]. It included DirectAnimation for 2D/3D&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asahi-net.or.jp/~RB6K-IID/space.html 3D Animation of SPACE FIGHTER by DIRECT ANIMATION]&lt;/ref&gt; web [[animation]], [[DirectShow]] for [[multimedia]] playback and [[streaming media]], DirectX Transform for web interactivity, and [[Direct3D]] Retained Mode for higher level 3D graphics. DirectShow additionally contained [[DirectX plugin]]s for [[audio signal processing]] and [[DXVA|DirectX Video Acceleration]] for accelerated video playback.

DirectX Media [[Run-time system|runtime]] components were distributed as part of [[Internet Explorer]]. DirectX Media [[SDK]] and DirectX SDK existed as two separate SDKs until DirectX 6.0. Later on, Microsoft deprecated DirectX Media and integrated DirectShow, the key part of DirectX Media, into DirectX. As of April 2005, DirectShow was removed from DirectX and moved to the [[Microsoft Platform SDK]] instead. DirectX is, however, still required to build the DirectShow samples. DirectShow and its components are to be gradually deprecated in favor of the newer [[Media Foundation]].
