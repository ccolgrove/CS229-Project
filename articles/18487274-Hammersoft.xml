The '''Cairo Derby''', also known as the '''Egyptian ClÃ¡sico''' or the '''Egyptian Derby''', is a [[Association football|football]] match between '''Egyptian''' clubs [[Al-Ahly S.C.]] and [[Zamalek SC]]. It is a match between arguably the two most successful clubs in [[Egypt]] and [[Africa]]. Ahly and Zamalek were named by the Confederation of African Football &quot;CAF&quot; as The 1st and 2nd African Clubs of the 20th Century respectively. Both teams are located in Greater Cairo and their matches are considered the highlight of the football season with live broadcast to most of the Arab countries since the seventies. Usually the Derby is played twice each season with 2 matches in the [[Egyptian Premier League]], but it is not uncommon to find the teams meeting each other in the [[Egypt Cup]] and in Africa's most prestigious club competition, the [[CAF Champions League]].

Ever since their creation, both clubs have been the top clubs in the [[Egyptian Premier League]], the country's top-flight football league. Ahly won their first league title when the [[Egyptian Premier League]] was first created in the 1948-49 season and won 36 domestic titles after that. [[Zamalek FC]] managed to win the league 11 times and came second to [[Al-Ahly FC]] in the number of [[Egyptian Premier League]] titles won.

Their first ever match in the league ended in a 2-2 draw between the two clubs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://egypt.worldcupblog.org/uncategorized/ahly-zamalek-derbys-preview.html (Ahly-Zamalek) derby's preview], [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] blog&lt;/ref&gt; 

Fans of both clubs can be violent when in anger.  Numerous fights, injuries and deaths have been reported before matters became more controlled due to [[Politics of Egypt|Egypt's authoritarian regime]]. Yet many fights and riots still occur after derby matches between both sets of fans, leading the government to post even higher numbers of [[Central Security Forces]] troops in the stadium during the derby.  
The number of fights have increased with the increasing popularity of the &quot;[[ultras]]&quot; movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jack |last=Shenker |title=New Egypt sees old sporting rivalry resume |url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2011/jun/28/new-egypt-old-sporting-rivalry |work=The Guardian |date=28 June 2011 |accessdate=29 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[World Soccer Magazine]] selected the Cairo Derby as the 8th most fierce derby in the world.
