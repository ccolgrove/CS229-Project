'''KDE Partition Manager''' is a disk partitioning application for the [[KDE Platform]]. It was first released for [[KDE Software Compilation 4|KDE SC 4.1]]. It is released independently of the central KDE release cycle.

It is used for creating, deleting, resizing, moving, checking and copying [[Partition (computing)|partitions]], and the [[file system]]s on them. This is useful for creating space for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, copying data residing on hard disks and mirroring one partition with another (disk imaging). Additionally, KDE Partition Manager can back up file systems to files and restore such backups.

KDE Partition Manager is a standalone application to be launched from a desktop environment's start menu, a [[KPart]] that integrates with operating system installers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Chakra Live CD Installer Screenshot |url=http://chakra-project.org/img/slideshow/5.jpg |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[KControl]] module available from within KDE's ''[[System Settings]]'' application.

It uses [[GNU Parted|libparted]] to detect and manipulate devices and partition tables while several (optional) file system tools provide support for file systems not included in libparted. These optional packages will be detected at runtime and do not require a rebuild of KDE Partition Manager.

As is the case with most KDE applications, KDE Partition Manager is written in the [[C++]] [[programming language]] and uses the [[Qt (framework)|Qt GUI toolkit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://kde.org/whatiskde/devview.php|title=Developer's View |accessdate=2009-07-16}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techbase.kde.org/Development/Languages |title=Development/Languages |accessdate=2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Released under the [[GNU General Public License]], KDE Partition Manager is [[free software]].

The KDE Partition Manager project provides a live operating system including KDE Partition Manager which can be written to a [[Live CD]], a [[Live USB]] and other media. The operating system is based on the [[OpenSUSE]] Linux distribution.
