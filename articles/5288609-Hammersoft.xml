About the Clyde and Reese Hill memorial awards: The Hill brothers were members of the Lobos football team prior to WWII (Clyde, 1941; Reese, 1939â1941). Both men were described by UNM coaches as extraordinary athletes. Clyde came to UNM after serving in the U.S. Marines where he was a boxing champion. At UNM, he was a member of the university boxing team and made the football team as a walk-on. Reese came to UNM as a highly touted recruit. A &quot;legend&quot; in northern New Mexico high school sports, he lettered in four sports at St. Michael's High School in Santa Fe. While at UNM, he was a member of the university's track, basketball and football teams. The Hill brothers were described by a contemporary as being &quot;He-Men, the kind of men who could throw you across a room.&quot; After the bombing of Pearl Harbor, Clyde and Reese left UNM to enlist in the military. Clyde died as a U.S. Marine F4U fighter pilot at Okinawa with the rank of Captain, while Reeseâa U.S. Army 1st Lt. and glider pilotâsurvived the invasion of Normandy only to be killed when his glider was shot down over Holland.
