Bacon has had a long interest in music. He started playing in Conspiracy, followed by Neuraxon.

Bacon has also inspired an audio recording application called [[Jokosher]], a pun on the fact that his name contains the phrase [[kosher|&quot;no bacon&quot;]].

In June 2008 Bacon started a new musical project called ''[[Severed Fifth]]''. The aim was to produce an album in his home studio and then to distribute the music in new ways. This was an experiment in how musicians can work in the internet era, outside the conventional music industry. The first demo ''Denied By Reign'' was released 21 October 2008 and features brutal [[death metal]]. His second album ''Nightmares by Design'', more [[melodic death metal]] in style, was released on 11 October 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Paul24Jun08&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SeveredFifth&quot;&gt; {{cite web|url = http://www.severedfifth.com/releases/|title = Releases|accessdate = 2008-10-28|last = Bacon|first = Jono|authorlink = |year = 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
