{{2010â11 Big East men's basketball standings}}
The '''2010â11 Providence Friars men's basketball team''' represented [[Providence College]] in the [[2010â11 Big East Conference men's basketball season|Big East Conference]]. The team finished with a 4â14 conference record and a 15â17 record overall.

In his third season with the team, head coach [[Keno Davis]] returned two starters and just eight players overall after a tumultuous offseason that included the dismissal of the team's leading scorer in [[2009â10 Providence Friars men's basketball team|2009â10]], forward Jamine Peterson, as well as the transfer or dismissal of three other players.

The Friars were led in scoring by senior forward [[Marshon Brooks]], who finished first the conference and second in Division I with 24.6 points per game. He set conference records for single-game scoring (52 points vs. [[2010â11 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball team|Notre Dame]] on February 23) and for single-season conference scoring (468 points). Brooks was named to the All-Big East First Team and the [[2011 NCAA Men's Basketball All-Americans|Associated Press All-American Third Team]] following the season and was a finalist for the 2011 [[John R. Wooden Award]].

After losing their first six conference games, including a narrow home defeat to #5 [[2010â11 Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball team|Pittsburgh]] on January 4, the Friars managed back-to-back wins over ranked opponents for the first time since 1998. On January 22, they defeated #19 [[2010â11 Louisville Cardinals men's basketball team|Louisville]] at home before knocking off #8 [[2010â11 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] at home on January 26. However, the Friars did not receive votes in either the [[AP Poll]] or [[Coaches' Poll]] at any point in the season.

The Friars lost seven of their final eight regular season conference games, finishing 14th in the conference before falling to [[2010â11 Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball team|Marquette]] in the first round of the [[2011 Big East Men's Basketball Tournament]]. Davis was fired three days later.

==Offseason==
On the morning of April 12, 2010 two freshmen â center James Still and guard Johnnie Lacy â were arrested outside of campus after Lacy and Still randomly attacked another student on the street. Lacy and Still were charged with assault and suspended from the school the same day; Lacy had already planned on transferring at the end of the spring semester. Fellow freshman guard Duke Mondy was detained for questioning, but was not charged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsblog.projo.com/2010/04/two-pc-basketball-players-char.html|title=Update: PC suspends 2 hoop players in alleged assault|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|date=2010-04-12|accessdate=2010-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still was later dismissed from the school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesunchronicle.com/articles/2010/05/19/sports/7410979.txt|title='Greedy' no longer wanted at Providence|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Peter|last=Gobis|date=2010-05-19|accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 18, 2010, sophomore forward Jamine Peterson â the Friars' leading scorer in [[2009â10 Providence Friars men's basketball team|2009â10]] and an All-Big East Honorable Mention â announced to [[SLAM Magazine]] that he was turning professional and would pursue playing opportunities overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/college-hs/college/2010/05/breaking-news-providences-peterson-will-turn-pro/|title=Breaking: Jamine Peterson Will Turn Pro, Dismissed From Team|work=[[SLAM Magazine]]|first=Franklyn|last=Calle|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, the school announced Peterson was dismissed from the team for a team rules violation,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greedy&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopsblog.projo.com/2010/05/jamine-peterson.html|title=PC kicks scoring star Greedy Peterson off basketball team|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Kevin|last=McNamara|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2010-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later revealed to have been an on-campus incident involving Peterson and [[Amateur Athletic Union|AAU]] players from [[Boston]] on April 23 or 24, 2010.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greedy&quot; /&gt;

On the morning of July 18, 2010, redshirt freshman forward Kadeem Batts was arrested outside of a Providence [[nightclub]] and was charged with disorderly conduct and failing to disperse after he did not follow police orders to leave the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/pc/content/PC_Friars_Batts_07-21-10_87J97A1_v2.1fc6fef.html|title=PC player facing disorderly charge|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Kevin|last=McNamara|date=2010-07-21|accessdate=2010-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The charges were dismissed after six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/PC_Player_Case_08-04-10_B8JE54K_v20.2380034.html|title=Providence college athlete may have misdemeanor dropped|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Gregory|last=Smith|date=2010-08-04|accessdate=2010-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Friars also lost two graduating starting guards, [[Sharaud Curry]] and [[Brian McKenzie]], as well as graduating reserve guard Luke Burchett. Center Ray Hall graduated but returned to the team for a fifth year of eligibility,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/pc/content/PC_Friars_McNamara_05-14-10_JPIG1SF_v2.27d3c57.html|title=PCâs Davis expects Hall to return|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Kevin|last=McNamara|date=2010-05-14|accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; while junior forward Russ Permenter transferred after one season with the Friars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/pc/content/PC_Friars_Keno_Davis_McNamara_04-09-10_JAI21O_v3.2f2b4fd.html|title=Friars Permenter, Lacy to âpursue other opportunitiesâ|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Kevin|last=McNamara|date=2010-04-08|accessdate=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, assistant coach Pat Skerry was hired by [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh]] head coach [[Jamie Dixon]] as an assistant coach on May 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/052710aaa.html|title=Head Coach Keno Davis Looks To Hire New Assistant Coach|work=Friars.com|date=2010-05-27|accessdate=2010-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by Boston AAU coach Chris Driscoll, who coached Class of 2010 recruits Gerard Coleman and Ron Giplaye.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/062510aaa.html|title=Men's Basketball Names Chris Driscoll Assistant Coach|work=Friars.com|date=2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also hired as Director of Player Development and Video Operations was former [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] player [[Kevin Gamble]], who played for Keno Davis' father [[Tom Davis (basketball)|Tom Davis]] at [[Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball|Iowa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friars.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/062810aaa.html|title=Men's Basketball Names Kevin Gamble Coordinator of Player Development and Video Operations|work=Friars.com|date=2010-06-28|accessdate=2010-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A week after Skerry's departure, 2011 recruit Naadir Tharpe, a guard rated 4/5 stars by [[Rivals.com]] who had committed in March 2010, decommitted from Providence due to Skerry's departure. The next day, June 3, the team lost another 4-star recruit by Rivals.com from the 2010 class, guard Joe Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopsblog.projo.com/|title=Top recruit Joe Young backing off PC; so is Naadir Tharpe|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Kevin|last=McNamara|date=2010-06-03|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the school did not allow Young to be released from his signed [[National Letter of Intent]]; his family stated Young &quot;would never play at Providence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxhouston.com/dpp/sports/local/100603-providence-denies-joseph-young's-release|title=Providence Denies Joseph Young's Release|work=[[KRIV-TV]]|first=Mark|last=Berman|date=2010-06-03|accessdate=2010-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Young later enrolled in the [[University of Houston]], where is father, Michael, was the school's Director of Basketball Operations. Due to NCAA regulations, Young sat out his first year at Houston before returning for three seasons of eligibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hoopsblog.projo.com/2010/08/joseph-young-en.html|title=Joseph Young enrolls at Houston|work=[[The Providence Journal]]|first=Kevin|last=McNamara|date=2010-08-23|accessdate=2010-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
