==History==
Neowin was started as a hobby in October 2000 by Marcel Klum and Steven Parker, known within the forums as &quot;Redmak&quot; and &quot;Neobond&quot; respectively, reporting news about the Windows XP alpha and beta releases (then known as &quot;Windows Codename Whistler&quot;).

Neowin has broken several stories, such as the [http://www.neowin.net/news/main/04/02/12/exclusive-windows-2000--windows-nt-4-source-code-leaks leak of Windows 2000 source code] onto the internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/02/12/2114228 |title=Windows 2000 &amp; Windows NT 4 Source Code Leaks |publisher=Slashdot |date=2004-02-12 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site structure==
The website provides news, technology reviews, opinion articles, as well as an [[IRC]] server and forums. Over 250,000 users have registered for the forums,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.neowin.net/forum/topic/917292-neowin-welcomes-its-250000th-member-sign-up/ |title=Neowin welcomes its 250,000th member sign up - Neowin Forums |publisher=Neowin.net |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2011-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; making over 10,000,000 posts as of April 2011.
