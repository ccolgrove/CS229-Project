'''Beerware''' is a somewhat [[tongue-in-cheek]] term for [[software]] released under a very relaxed license. It provides the [[end user]] with the right to use a particular [[computer program|program]] (or do anything else with the [[source code]]).

==Description==
Should the user of the product meet the author and consider the software useful, he is encouraged to buy the author a [[beer]] 'in return' (or, in some variations, drink a beer in the author's honor).

==History==
The term was invented by [[John Bristor]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]] on April 25, 1987,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the first software distributed using the Beerware licensing model was uploaded to a number of [[Bulletin board system|BBS]]s in 1987 and 1988.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Many variations on the beerware model have been created since that time.

==License==
[[Poul-Henning Kamp]]'s beerware license is simple and short, in contrast to the [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] which he has described as a &quot;joke&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.freebsd.org/~phk/ I think the GNU license is a joke, it fights the capitalism it so much is against with their own tools, and no company is ever going to risk any kind of proximity to so many so vague statements assembled in a license. ]&lt;/ref&gt;. The full text of Kamp's license is:&lt;ref&gt;
