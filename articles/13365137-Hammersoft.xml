'''KHFR''' is a radio station on 89.7 [[megahertz|MHz]] [[FM broadcasting|FM]] licensed to [[Santa Maria, California]], serving the Santa Maria and Lompoc areas by playing traditional [[Christian music]], along with ultra [[conservative Christianity|conservative]] [[fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] teaching and preaching. The station is owned by [[Family Radio]], a [[non-commercial]] and [[non-profit]] operation headed by [[Harold Camping]]. The station also sells no airtime, as the few outside ministries that air on [[Family Radio]] are not charged to be on the air. 

The station was given an [[construction permit]] to build the station since 2002. In June 2005, the station received permission from the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to start test broadcasts, and was officially licensed on December 15, 2005.
