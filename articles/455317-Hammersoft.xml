'''truTV''' is an [[United States|American]] [[cable]] [[television network]] owned by [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting]], a subsidiary of [[Time Warner]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.turner.com/ Turner Newsroom]&lt;/ref&gt; The network launched as '''Court TV''' in 1991, changing to truTV in 2008. Its programming has traditionally been live homicide trial coverage and other criminal justice programming; however, the network has branched out into more &quot;caught on video&quot; reality programs, or as truTV calls it, &quot;actuality&quot; television.

==History==
===As Court TV===
truTV was formed in 1991 as '''Court TV'''. It began as a joint venture owned by [[Liberty Media]] (50%); [[Time Warner]] (25%); and [[General Electric]], through [[NBC]] (now [[NBC Universal]]) (25%). It was led by law writer [[Steven Brill (law writer)|Steven Brill]]. The network originally featured continuous live trial coverage, with analysis by anchors. The network came into its own during the [[Menendez brothers]] first trial and later the [[O.J. Simpson murder trial]].

Brill left the network in 1997. In 1998, NBC sold its share of the network to Time Warner. That same year, it began running several original and acquired programs in prime time, such as ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'' and ''[[Forensic Files]]''.

In 2004, recognizing the growth of its primetime programming, Court TV split itself into two divisions. Daytime trial coverage was branded as '''Court TV News,''' and primetime and weekend programming was branded as '''Court TV: Seriously Entertaining.'''

Time Warner bought full control of Court TV in 2006 and began running it as part of Turner Broadcasting.&lt;ref name=&quot;soleowner&quot;&gt;[http://www.usatoday.com/money/media/2006-05-15-court-tv-usat_x.htm Time Warner buys remaining part of Court TV], ''USA Today'', May 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The buyout of Court TV marks Time Warner's first instance of buying a TV network&amp;mdash;rather than selling one&amp;mdash;since the acquisition of TBS Networks in 1996.

===Transition to truTV===
As part of the rebranding, daytime trial coverage, which previously aired from 9:00AM ET to 5:00PM ET, was cut back to 9:00AM ET to 3:00PM ET and branded as ''&quot;In Session.&quot;'' From 3:00PM ET to 5:30AM ET on weekdays and throughout the weekend, it runs original investigation-based programming and several new reality shows not related to law enforcement.  

==truTV HD==
'''truTV HD''' is a [[1080i]] [[high-definition television|high definition]] simulcast of truTV, which is available from [[Dish Network]] along with cable television providers such as [[AT&amp;T U-verse]], [[Comcast]], [[Time Warner Cable]], [[Cox Cable]], [[Cablevision]], [[Verizon FiOS]] and [[RCN Corporation|RCN]]. In March 2011, the channel saw a surge of carriage deals for its HD feed, due to its coverage of the [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]], its first ever live sports programming. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.multichannel.com/article/465297-TruTV_Nets_HD_Channel_Launches.php TruTV Nets HD Channel Launches] ''Multichannel News'' March 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  [[DirecTV]], however, most known for its extensive sports content, only added a temporary part-time HD feed of the channel for coverage of the tournament, with the full-time 24 hour version reportedly coming in late 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/2011/03/Mar-10/Media/DirecTV-truTV-HD.aspx DirecTV Launching truTV HD In Time For Start Of NCAA Tournament] ''Sports Business Journal'' March 10, 2011 &lt;/ref&gt;

==Programming==

===''In Session''===
[[Image:InSessionlogo.png|thumb|right|In Session logo]]''In Session'' (the successor to Court TV News) provides [[live television|live]] coverage of [[trial]]s, legal news, and details of highly publicized crimes during their news programming hours from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. every weekday (except during national holidays). Their coverage takes viewers into the [[courtroom]]s and shares analysis from anchors and guests to help viewers understand legal proceedings.

''In Session'' also runs a blog, ''Sidebar,'' where the ''In Session'' team posts updated legal news and analysis.

''In Session'' moved to a new studio in Atlanta at the [[CNN Center]] on November 16, 2009. It will be part of, and produced by, truTV's sister network, [[HLN (TV network)|HLN]]. ''In Session'' anchors also appear on [[CNN]] to provide legal analysis about current crime stories and trials.

===Sports coverage===
On February 8, 2010 truTV premiered ''NFL Full Contact'' a show that gave a behind the scenes look at the television production for major football events such as the Super Bowl, NFL draft and Pro Bowl and season opener. The show was not renewed for a second season.

On March 15, 2011 and March 16, 2011 truTV entered the live sports avenue by showcasing the inaugural First Four round of the [[2011 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]]. The agreement is part of the new contract between [[Turner Sports]] and [[CBS Sports]] resulting in shared coverage of the NCAA Tournament through 2024. truTV featured games up until the Elite 8 round. In addition to games, truTV had the studio show ''Inside March Madness'' after every day of action.

truTV's college basketball coverage was not limited to the NCAA Tournament. On April 1, 2011 the network aired the Reese's All-Star Game, featuring top players from schools across the country.

truTV currently has a show from [[NFL Films]] in development tentatively titled ''Semi-Pro'' that will focus on a group of semi-professional football players.

In 2011, truTV tried to secure the rights for [[National Hockey League]] coverage, but lost to [[NBC]] and [[Versus (TV channel)|Versus]].

==Websites==
In addition to truTV.com, the network also operates [[The Smoking Gun]], a website that focuses on legal items often pertaining to famous people, such as [[mug shot]]s and other public documents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesmokinggun.com/ The Smoking Gun.com]&lt;/ref&gt; It also owns the website [[Crime Library]], which provides detailed information about infamous crimes and how they were solved &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/library/crime/index.html truTV.com Crime Library]&lt;/ref&gt; They as well host two blogs including [http://blog.trutv.com/dumb_as_a_blog/ Dumb as a Blog], a blog dedicated to &quot;dumb&quot; human misfortune &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.trutv.com/dumb_as_a_blog/ truTV.com Dumb as a Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; and Chuck Shepherd's: News of the Weird.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trutv.com/weird/index.html truTV.com Chuck Shepherd's: News of the Weird]&lt;/ref&gt; Online coverage of current trials (including ''In Session'') is now hosted at sister website [[CNN|CNN.com]]'s &quot;Crime&quot; section. truTV also maintains [http://www.trutv.com/video truTV video], a streaming video player, where users can watch &quot;footage of car chases, dumb criminals, gun fights, drunk drivers, drug busts, naughty girls, police, things that blow up, taser attacks, naked thieves and more!&quot;

==Radio==
On February 3, 2003, '''Court TV Plus''' debuted on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], featuring audio from Court TV programs. Originally on Channel 134, it was moved in September 2005 and aired on Channel 110 until the channel ceased operations on January 1, 2008.

== International ==
=== Canada ===
{{Main|Investigation Discovery (Canada)}}
Court TV Canada, a Canadian version of the channel under its previous format, owned by [[CHUM Limited]] (and later acquired by [[CTVglobemedia]]), launched on September 7, 2001. Unlike its U.S. counterpart, it did not rebrand under the truTV name and continued to operate as Court TV until August 30, 2010, when it relaunched as a Canadian version of [[Investigation Discovery]].

The U.S. version of CourtTV had earlier been approved by the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|CRTC]] as an eligible foreign signal in 1997,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/1997/PB97-96.HTM Public Notice CRTC 1997-96: Revised Lists of Eligible Satellite Services], July 22, 1997. Retrieved September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and indeed had been carried by several Canadian service providers prior to the launch of the domestic service. However, Court TV/truTV was never withdrawn as an eligible foreign signal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/publications/satlist.htm CRTC revised lists of eligible satellite services], June 1, 2010. Retrieved September 8, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that, particularly with the end of the licensing agreement with CTV, there are few hurdles preventing truTV from re-emerging at some future point on Canadian service providers.

=== Latin America ===
{{Main|truTV (Latin America)}}
The channel was launched on April 1, 2009 in [[Latin America]] replacing [[Retro (TV channel)|Retro]], also owned by [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. The announcement was made on March 25, 2009 by [[Turner Broadcasting System|Turner Broadcasting System Latin America]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.realtvnews.com.ar/new/noticias.php?id=4337 Turner Broadcasting System Latin America, Inc.lanza un nuevo canal: truTV]&lt;/ref&gt; The channel has the same programming, idents and bumpers from the U.S. version.

=== Asia ===
{{Main|truTV (Asia)}}
The channel was launched on April 1, 2010 in [[Singapore]] on [[StarHub TV]] channel 446 owned by [[Turner Broadcasting System]]. The channel has the same programming, idents and bumpers from the U.S. version.
