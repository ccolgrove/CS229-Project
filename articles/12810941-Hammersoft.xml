'''Michael Rose''', played by [[Russell Floyd]], first appeared when he was chosen, randomly, to be the [[best man]] at [[Terry Raymond]]'s ([[Gavin Richards]]) wedding (which was later called off).  He settled in [[Walford]] as a Market Inspector in 1996. He initially had very few storylines in his early years. He had a crush on [[April Branning]] but no relationship ever developed between him and April. Then there was the arrival of his teenage son [[Matthew Rose (EastEnders)|Matthew]] ([[Joe Absolom]]) and former wife [[Susan Rose]] ([[Tilly Vosburgh]]) in 1997.

His ex-wife Susan was suffering from [[multiple sclerosis]] and Michael ended up caring for her. Eventually he and Susan got back together and seemed happy until the arrival of [[Lisa Fowler|Lisa Shaw]] ([[Lucy Benjamin]]) who was also a Market Inspector. He and Lisa became attracted to each other and had an affair behind Susan's back. Michael ended the affair and decided to leave Walford with Susan and start a new life in [[Leeds]], with Susan unaware of the affair.

He returned occasionally in 1999 when his son Matthew was wrongly imprisoned for the [[murder]] of [[Saskia Duncan]] (Deborah Sheridan-Taylor). The real culprit was [[Steve Owen (EastEnders)|Steve Owen]] ([[Martin Kemp]]) and Michael became one of his enemies for framing his son. Michael's last appearance was in October 1999.

'''Sal Martin''', often referred to as '''Aunt Sal''',&lt;ref name=&quot;sally&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Bosom pals for 30 years|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61324146.html|publisher= ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]''|date=16 March 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is a recurring character, played by [[Anna Karen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Me and My Trolley ...with Anna Karen|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61114166.html|publisher= ''[[The People]]''|date=19 January 1997 |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has appeared sporadically over the years, usually for only one or two episodes at a time. As of April 2011, Sal has collectively featured in 41 episodes of the show since she first appeared in 1996. In February 1996, it was announced that comedy actress Anna Karen would be joining the cast of ''EastEnders'' as [[Peggy Mitchell]]'s sister Sal. Anna Karen and the actress who plays Peggy, [[Barbara Windsor]], are &quot;best friends&quot; in reality and Windsor has expressed how happy she was to have Karen on the cast of ''EastEnders''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Asthma Campaign - Actors and authors put weight behind the|url= http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4158/is_20020331/ai_n12602409?tag=content;col1|publisher= ''[[The Independent]]''|date=31 March 2002 |accessdate=2008-10-02}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=TAKE A BUTCHER'S AT BABS|url= http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-61157527.html|publisher= ''[[The People]]''|date=3 February 1996 |accessdate=2008-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ben Mitchell==
{{Main|Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)}}
'''Ben Mitchell''' has been played by four different actors. Matthew Silver appeared as an infant Ben from 1996â98, and Morgan Whittle played him as a toddler from 1999â2000. After a six-year absence from the series, [[Charlie Jones (actor)|Charlie Jones]] assumed the role of Ben in 2006. Executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] axed Jones as part of a series revamp in 2010; the role was recast to Joshua Pascoe later that year. Having previously appeared as a baby and a toddler, Ben returned to ''EastEnders'' in 2006 played by child actor Charlie Jones. Jones was cast alongside [[Megan Jossa]], who would play his cousin [[Courtney Mitchell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a28246/mitchell-kids-to-return-to-walford.html|title=Mitchell kids to return to Walford |last=Wilkes|first=Neil|date=19 January 2006|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=Digital Spy Ltd|accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ben is partially deaf, Jones is a hearing actor. ''[[The Guardian]]''{{'s}} Rebecca Atkinson suggested that, as only the second disabled character in ''EastEnders''{{'s}} history, Ben was introduced to fulfil a BBC quota. She criticised Jones' casting, and opined, &quot;The use of able-bodied actors to play disabled characters is endemic. Maybe in theory there's nothing wrong with that, but while real disabled people are invisible it is downright offensive to persistently cast able-bodied people in disabled roles.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2006/jul/11/television.comment|title=Big Brother's 'freak show' has produced the first warts-and-all disabled person on TV - when will the soaps follow?|last=Atkinson|first=Rebecca|date=11 July 2006|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=[[Guardian News and Media]]|accessdate=18 November 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joe Wicks==
{{Main|Joe Wicks}}
'''Joe Wicks''' was played by [[Paul Nicholls (actor)|Paul Nicholls]]. He appeared on screen between 25 March 1996 and 14 November 1997. ''EastEnders'' was praised for the character's portrayal of [[schizophrenia]]. ''EastEnders'' story editor, Ian Aldwinkle, decided to introduce a character with schizophrenia after working on the drama series ''[[Casualty (TV series)|Casualty]]'', which featured violent and dramatic incidents involving people with the illness, but only focussed on the medical side. Aldwinkle researched the illness and says he was shocked to discover that it affects one in 100 people, but it was rarely spoken about. He said: &quot;Because it has a continuing storyline, ''EastEnders'' was able to look at the effect that schizophrenia has on a family and on individual relationships. I wanted to humanise it and look at the emotional impact it has on people.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;schizophrenia&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schizophrenia.com/newsletter/697/697eastend.htm|title=EastEnders TV Program covers Schizophrenia |publisher=schizophrenia.com|date=10 May 1997|accessdate=12 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said he hoped that the storyline would be helpful, saying &quot;It seems to me that mental illness is one of the last subjects that you can still make jokes about without being labelled politically incorrect, and that seems wrong. If I get just one letter from one person saying that the character of Joe Wicks has helped to change their life for the better, then I will be pleased.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;schizophrenia&quot;/&gt;

==Lorraine Wicks==
{{Main|Lorraine Wicks}}
'''Lorraine Wicks''' was played by [[Jacqueline Leonard]] between 1996 and 1997. Introduced in April 1996, Lorraine was the former wife of the already established character [[David Wicks]] ([[Michael French]]). She was brought into the serial along with her son [[Joe Wicks]] ([[Paul Nicholls]]).&lt;ref name=&quot;20years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last= Smith|first= Rupert|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|''EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square]] |year=2005|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-563-52165-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Author Kate Lock has described Lorraine as &quot;relentlessly sensible, fair and nice&quot; but with a &quot;rogue gene&quot; that prompted her to select the wrong kind of men.&lt;ref name=&quot;who&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; As well as a high-profile storyline concentrating on Joe's diagnosis of [[schizophrenia]], Lorraine's most prominent storyline was a love triangle between herself, [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) and Grant's wife [[Tiffany Mitchell|Tiffany]] ([[Martine McCutcheon]]). In the storyline, Lorraine discovered that Tiffany was keeping a secret from Grant - that he was potentially not the father of her unborn child. When Tiffany refused to tell Grant the truth, Lorraine did, making way for them to become a legitimate couple, albeit briefly. Leonard commented in December 1996, &quot;Lorraine has had a year on her own and she feels that she probably needs a bit of contact - and Grant's quite macho. It was very interesting from my point of view because Lorraine could be perceived as being bitchy and she's not. She genuinely cares about Tiffany and their marriage and the baby and she wants the whole situation sorted out. But she and Grant do like each other and care about each other and it loses control a bit.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;xmas&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Lorraine's seasons cheatings; EastEnder Jacqueline Leonard tells all about her festive frolics|publisher=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|Daily Record]]|first=John|last=Millar|date=24 December 1996|accessdate=26 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
'''Alistair Matthews''', played by [[Neil Clark (actor)|Neil Clark]], was a store manager who caught [[Sarah Hills]] ([[Daniela Denby-Ashe]]) shoplifting in April 1996, but promised not to call the police if she attended his Christian fellowship and turned her back on her sinful ways. Sarah was captivated by Alistair's Christian preachings and joined his fellowship. [[Frankie Pierre]] was drawn to Alistair too, and when he turned her advances down, she spread rumours that they were sexually involved; although Alistair publicly denied this, causing Frankie's downfall in Walford.

Alistair condemned Sarah for having pre-marital sex with [[Robbie Jackson]] ([[Dean Gaffney]]) during a crisis of faith. However, Sarah was hurt to discover that Alistair did not practice the piety that he preached, and when she realised that he was having pre-marital sex with his girlfriend Sue Taylor, she denounced him publicly in front of his congregation.

On the behest of producer [[John Yorke (television producer)|John Yorke]] in 2000, Jim was paired romantically with pensioner [[Dot Cotton]], played by [[June Brown]]; a slow courtship was featured, with Dot often shown to be outraged by Jim's advances, resulting in numerous rejections. Dot finally succumbed and accepted his marriage proposal in an episode that aired in November 2001; the scenes were filmed inside one of the carriages of the [[London Eye]] on the [[South Bank]] of the [[River Thames]]. Their wedding aired on 14 February 2002, [[Valentine's Day]]. ''The Guardian'' critic, [[Nancy Banks-Smith]], described the wedding as &quot;uniquely uneventful [...] For Dot and Jim 'In sickness and health... till death do us part' seemed to carry more resonance than for most.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2002/feb/15/tvandradio.television2|title= Cotton shocks|work=The Guardian|date=15 February 2002|accessdate=2 August 2009 | location=London | first=Nancy | last=Banks-Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reenie had dated Jim in the early 1960s and gave birth to his oldest child Derek out of wedlock. When she got pregnant again with daughter April, Jim then stepped up and proposed, and they married in a [[shotgun wedding]]. However they never got on well together and fought like cat and dog, but Reenie depended heavily on her husband and whenever they got close to separating and ending their marriage, she got pregnant. This resulted in her giving birth, in chronological order, to Derek (1960), April (1961),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carol (1962),  Suzy (1966),&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a135765/max-visits-tanya-in-prison.html Max visits Tanya in prison]&quot;, [[Digital Spy]].

Reenie was said to be very maternal and doted on all of her children, despite their faults. She was particularly close to her oldest daughter April, whilst her relationship with daughters Carol and Suzy was notably strained due to their choice of lifestyle. She was also said to be very distraught when her son Max walked out on the family in 1989, and despite keeping in regular contact with her grandson [[Bradley Branning|Bradley]] and Max's ex-wife [[Rachel Branning|Rachel]], she never saw Max again. Reenie appeared on-screen in April 1996, in the lead-up to April's wedding to her fiancÃ© Nikos.

Off-screen, in October 1999 it was revealed that Reenie was critically ill, and her daughter Carol left Walford to care for her. A few weeks later Reenie died, and it was mentioned by her grandson [[Robbie Jackson|Robbie]] that her funeral was attended by Carol, Carol's ex-husband [[Alan Jackson|Alan]] and her grandchildren Robbie, [[Sonia Fowler|Sonia]] and [[Billie Jackson|Billie]]. Her oldest granddaughter [[Bianca Jackson|Bianca]] was notably not present at the funeral due to her feud with her mother. A month after her demise Reenie's husband Jim arrived in Walford to care for their grandchildren Robbie and Sonia after Carol reconciled with Alan.

Elis has commented, &quot;My agent at the time told me that if you are in a soap for three years, it takes three years for the viewers to forget you, whereas if you are in one for five years, it takes another 10 years before they forget you.

Simon remained in the serial until 1999, at which time it was mutually agreed between Lynford and executive producer [[Matthew Robinson (producer)|Matthew Robinson]], that the character had run its course. The character was given a happy ending, reuniting with his former boyfriend Tony to travel Europe.

She attempted to ruin the established relationships of several characters during her year in the soap, purposefully seducing attached men.

Off-screen it was reported that Syan Blake and the producers of ''EastEnders'' had decided to write the character out of the serial, as the actress was receiving death threats from angry fans that could not separate fact from fiction, and blamed Blake for her characterâs home-wrecking. The official ''EastEnders'' book ''Whoâs Who'' states that Frankie âhad a carnivorous approach to relationships, hunting down her quarry, devouring her victim in two gulps and then moving onto the next kill.â&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lock |first= Kate|title=[[EastEnders books|EastEnders Who's Who]] |year=2000|publisher=BBC Books|id=ISBN 0-563-55178-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Once burnt, Syan's shy: Hunted by the media and confused fans |publisher=''[[The Voice (newspaper)|The Voice]]'' | date = 2 June 1997| accessdate=28 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
