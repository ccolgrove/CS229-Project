'''''The Undiscovered Numbers &amp; Colors''''' is the debut [[extended play|EP]] by American [[experimental metal]] band [[Foreign Objects (band)|Foreign Objects]]. While it was popular locally, the EP never garnered the band any mainstream success. Originally released on October 1, 1995 by Distant Recordings, it was later reissued as part of the 2003 ''[[Universal Culture Shock/Undiscovered Numbers &amp; Colors]]'' compilation, which itself was reissued as the first disc in the 2009 compilation by Distant Recordings, [[15 Years]]. The front cover art was largely designed by drummer [[Jess Margera]].
