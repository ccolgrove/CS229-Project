'''digiKam''' is an [[image organizer]] and editor using [[KDE Platform]]. It runs on most known desktop environments and window managers if the required libraries are installed. It supports all major [[image file formats]], and can organize collections of photographs in directory-based albums, or dynamic albums by date, timeline, or by [[Tag (metadata)|tags]]. Users can also add captions and ratings to their images, search through them and save searches for later use. With the [[Plug-in (computing)|plugins]] they can also export albums to 23hq, [[Facebook]], [[Flickr]], [[Gallery2]], [[Google Earth]]'s KML files, [[SmugMug]], [[Piwigo]], Simpleviewer, burn them on CD, or create web galleries.

== Features ==
digiKam provides functions for organizing, previewing, downloading and/or deleting images from digital cameras. Basic auto-transformations can also be deployed on the fly during picture downloading.  In addition, digiKam offers image enhancement tools through its [[KIPI]] (KDE Image Plugins Interface) framework and its own plugins, like [[Red-eye effect|red-eye]] removal, [[Linux color management|color management]], image filters, or special effects. digiKam is the only free photo management application on Linux that can handle 16 bit/channel images. [[Digital Asset Management]] is the mainstay of digiKam.

The 0.10 version is a hallmark in development as it integrates digiKam in the KDE Platform 4 environment, which is now available on all major platforms as Unix-like, Mac OS X, and Windows (XP, Vista and 7). New features are: XMP metadata, [[Digital Negative (file format)|DNG]] format read and write, database file is independent of photo libraries, enabling remote paths, multiple roots and offline archives, improved database with much more metadata that can be searched, e.g. camera or lens, Marble integration for geolocation, non-modal image editor, live search boxes in both sidebars and main window, and many more.

New features in the 0.9 series includes a GPS locator&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/104&lt;/ref&gt; and synchronization,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/136&lt;/ref&gt; iPod Photo upload support,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/137&lt;/ref&gt; an advanced metadata editor,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/163&lt;/ref&gt; better support for the [[Raw image format]] (using [[dcraw]] included in digiKam), full color management, a light-table,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digikam.org/?q=node/222&lt;/ref&gt; pan-tool in Image Editor and Preview mode, improvements in usability, and many new plugins.

Digikam 2.0 will be released in July 2011{{update after|2011|07|31}}, sporting a number of new features, including:
* Face detection and tagging support
* XMP sidecar support
* Reverse geocoding
