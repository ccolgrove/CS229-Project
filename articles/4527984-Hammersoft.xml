'''The Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools''' (AHIGS), is an [[Professional association|association]] for [[Private school|private]] girls' schools, based in [[North Ryde, New South Wales|North Ryde]], in the [[Northern Suburbs (Sydney)|Northern Suburbs]] of [[Sydney, New South Wales|Sydney]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]].

Established in 1916 as '''The Association of Head Mistresses of New South Wales''', today the Association enables inter-school [[aesthetic]], [[cultural]] and sporting activities (through the [[Independent Girls' Schools Sporting Association]]) between 30 of [[New South Wales]] and the [[Australian Capital Territory]]'s most exclusive [[Independent school|independent]] and [[Catholic school|Catholic]] [[Single-sex school|girls' schools]].

AHIGS also exists for the purpose of encouraging [[communication]] and a bond of [[co-operation]] and [[collegiality]] among independent girls' schools and their &quot;heads&quot;, and working towards advancing the cause of the [[education]] of girls through [[policy]] development on major issues of concern. The association actively represents its members and the interests of their schools at a [[political]] level, through [[lobbying]] [[government]]s and [[politician]]s.&lt;ref name=AHIGSObjectives&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahigs.nsw.edu.au/DeskTopDefault.aspx?tabid=291|title=Statement of Objectives|accessdate=2007-09-13|work=Objectives and Rules|publisher=Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through AHIGS competitions, member schools and their students, are encouraged to value good [[sportsmanship]], participation, team spirit and fairness above undue competitiveness and [[individualism]].&lt;ref name=AHIGSObjectives/&gt;

Of New South Wales' fifteen female [[Rhodes Scholars]] (1904 to 2009), eight have attended an AHIGS School.&lt;ref name=&quot;NSW Rhodes Scholars&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usyd.edu.au/registrar/rhodes/previous.shtml |title=NSW Rhodes Scholars 1904 - 2009 |accessdate=2009-03-19 |work=The University of Sydney}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the Women's Club on 8 November 1916 a group of eight [[Headmistress]]es from seven schools formed ''The Association of Head Mistresses of New South Wales'', with Miss Edith Badham (SCEGGS Darlinghurst) elected as Foundation [[President]].&lt;ref name=AHIGSorigins&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahigs.nsw.edu.au/DeskTopDefault.aspx?tabid=1 |title=Origin |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seven founding schools were:
*Abbotsleigh
*Frensham School
*Kambala
*The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Croydon (now Presbyterian Ladies' College, Sydney)
*The Presbyterian Ladies' College, Pymble (now Pymble Ladies' College)
*St. Catherines School
*The Sydney Church of England Girls' Grammar School (now SCEGGS Darlinghurst)

Eligibility for membership was eventually offered to a further 23 girls' schools.&lt;ref name=AHIGSorigins/&gt;

In 1945, a national association was formed, and AHIGS New South Wales heads served as Presidents of that organisation as follows:
*1950&amp;ndash;1952 Miss D. Knox (PLC Pymble)
*1959&amp;ndash;1962 Miss P. Bryant (Frensham)
*1975&amp;ndash;1978 Miss B. Chisholm (SCEGGS)
*1985 Miss K. McCredie (Abbotsleigh).
The national organisation was disbanded on 26 August 1985 when the Association of Heads of Independent Schools of Australia was founded.&lt;ref name=AHIGSorigins/&gt;

AHIGS first admitted male heads of girls' schools to membership from 1973 however, so far no male member has been elected to the position of President.&lt;ref name=AHIGSorigins/&gt;

== Archdale debating competition==
The Archdale Debating Competition is a competition conducted by the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools for the benefit of students from 21 of its Member Schools.&lt;ref name=AHIGSarchdale&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahigs.nsw.edu.au/DeskTopDefault.aspx?tabid=295 |title=Archdale Debating |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Betty Archdale.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Betty Archdale (1907&amp;ndash;2000)]]
Established in the early 1970s, it is an annual competition conducted over two terms (typically between March and August),&lt;ref name=AHIGSarchdale/&gt; with each member school entering a team into each of the seven divisions.
The Archdale Shield is awarded to the school which performs best across the whole competition. The award is determined through an overall points score after the conclusion of the final round.

The competition is named in honour of [[Betty Archdale|Helen Elizabeth (Betty) Archdale]] (August 21, 1907&amp;ndash;January 11, 2000), former principal of the [[The Women's College, University of Sydney|The Women's College]] at the [[University of Sydney]] (1946&amp;ndash;1957), and former [[headmistress]] of [[Abbotsleigh]] (1958&amp;ndash;1970). Betty Archdale was also a talented cricketer, captaining the [[English women's cricket team]] in 1934 and 1935. In 1944 Archdale was awarded an [[Order of the British Empire]] for her part in getting nurses out of [[Singapore]] during [[World War II]]. In 1999 she was one of the first ten women to be granted Honorary Life Membership of [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] in [[England]]. Archdale was listed as an [[Australian Living Treasures|Australian Living Treasure]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=AbbotsleighArchdale&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abbotsleigh.nsw.edu.au/index.cfm?page_id=EAFB7526-3474-DCCC-81B91D012E142B51 |title=HE (Betty) Archdale |accessdate=2007-09-13 |work=Abbotsleigh |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070829012243/http://abbotsleigh.nsw.edu.au/index.cfm?page_id=EAFB7526-3474-DCCC-81B91D012E142B51 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===History===
Although a number of AHIGS schools offered debating as an extracurricular activity from around the 1920s, it was not until the 1960s that inter-school debating became common amongst girls' schools.&lt;ref name=AHIGSarchdale/&gt;

In 1971, following a debate between Abbotsleigh and a combined high schools team, the decision was made to form a debating organisation for independent girls' schools. This organisation was called 'ISSGDA', and it was made up of sixteen independent schools (girls' and [[co-educational]]) divided into four geographic areas for competition purposes.&lt;ref name=AHIGSarchdale/&gt;  

The first ISSGDA final was contested between Abbotsleigh and [[Moriah College, Sydney|Moriah College]] (the only non-AHIGS school to compete) at Abbotsleigh. The [[trophy]], which Miss Archdale had donated, was won by Abbotsleigh and presented by Miss Kathleen McCredie, the then headmistress of Abbotsleigh. From this point on, the competition became known as the 'Archdale Debating Competition'.&lt;ref name=AHIGSarchdale/&gt;

==Festival of Speech==
The concept of a 'Festival of Speech' for the Association of Heads of Independent Girls' Schools was first suggested in the early 1990s by Mr. Chris Faisandier, then [[Principal (school)|Principal]] of [[Kincoppal-Rose Bay, School of the Sacred Heart, Sydney|Kincoppal-Rose Bay]] and a member of AHIGS.

Formerly a Principal of [[Sacred Heart College, Auckland|Sacred Heart College]] in [[New Zealand]], Faisandier was involved with the O'Shea Shield Competition in which about twenty schools from the lower [[North Island]] of New Zealand participated.

The purpose of the O'Shea Shield Competition was to encourage students to develop skills in the areas of [[public speaking]], [[debating]], analysis and [[rhetoric]]. So popular was the Competition and so high was the standard of presentation, that the winners of the O'Shea Shield were often featured on New Zealand television.

With the support of the AHIGS membership, Mr Faisandier established the Festival of Speech (then known as the ''Independent Girls Schools Speaking Competition'') in NSW in 1996. The inaugural Festival, spanning Friday evening and all day Saturday, was hosted by Kincoppal-Rose Bay, won by Roseville College, and attended by fifteen schools.

Today the Festival continues to be hosted annually by an AHIGS member school, and some twenty-five schools now participate. Students have the opportunity to perform in the areas of [[drama]], [[debating]], [[poetry]], [[prose]] readings, [[current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] and [[religious]] and [[ethical]] questions. The Festival is open to girls from AHIGS schools in years seven to eleven.&lt;ref name=&quot;FestivalofSpeech&quot;&gt;[http://www.ahigs.nsw.edu.au/DeskTopDefault.aspx?tabid=294 AHIGS Festival of Speech] (accessed:21-06-2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
