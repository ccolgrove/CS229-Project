This CD from [[Sumthing Else Music Works]] was composed by notable game composer [[Jesper Kyd]] for the ''[[Robotech: Invasion]]'' [[video game]], but featured music that was very different in style and tone from previous Robotech music.

Kyd's thinking on the score: {{cquote|''I had seen Robotech in the 80's and remembered the awesome storyline and visuals. I was asked to write a completely new score for Robotech: Invasion and NOT use the original 1980s music as an inspiration. So while I did watch quite a bit of Robotech to get familiar with the franchise again, I didnât pay too much attention to the TV show soundtrack. I read a lot of Robotech comics, especially the Robotech: Invasion series, because of the close relations these comic books had with the game.|}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bsospirit.com/entrevistas/jesperkyd_e.php BSOSpirit - Interview with Jesper Kyd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|''for Robotech: Invasion I was asked to create a new sound that was far removed from the previous titles, so I produced a modern, high-tech electronic score mixed with a large choir. It was a great experience composing for an epic, sci-fi setting.''|}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundtrack.net/features/article/?id=152 SoundtrackNet : Interview - Jesper Kyd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
