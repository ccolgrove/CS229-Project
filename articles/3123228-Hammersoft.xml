'''John William Suthers''' (born October 18, 1951) is the current [[State Attorney General|Attorney General]] of [[Colorado]]. He is a practicing Catholic and member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Background==
Suthers was born in [[Denver]], Colorado and adopted a month later by a [[Colorado Springs]] couple.

He attended St. Mary's High School, and the [[University of Notre Dame]], from which he graduated magna cum laud with a degree in government in 1974. Suthers graduated from the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado School of Law]] in 1977.

==Professional career==
From 1977 to 1981, Suthers served as a deputy and chief deputy district attorney in Colorado Springs. From 1979 to 1981, he headed the Economic Crime Division of the district attorneyâs office and co-authored a book on consumer fraud and [[white-collar crime]]. During his time as a prosecutor at the local level, he tried cases ranging from drunken driving to first degree murder.

In 1981, Suthers became a litigation partner in the Colorado Springs law firm of Sparks Dix, P.C.  He remained with the firm until 1988, at which time he was elected district attorney of the Fourth Judicial District. At the conclusion of his second term, he returned to Sparks Dix in 1997 as senior counsel in charge of the firmâs litigation section.

In 1999, Suthers was appointed executive director of the Colorado Department of Corrections by Governor [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]]. In August of 2001, Suthers was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] as [[United States Attorney]] for the District of Colorado. He was unanimously confirmed by the [[United State Senate]] and assumed the position the week before the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.&lt;ref name=Bonds between local law enforcement, Muslims strengthening&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/recommended/ci_18865341 |title=Bonds between local law enforcement, Muslims strengthening}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his tenure as U.S. Attorney for the District of Colorado, the office prosecuted several high-profile white collar cases, including cases against executives of Qwest.&lt;ref name=Qwest Under Justice Dept. Microscope&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2002-07-11/news/18200708_1_qwest-shares-qwest-spokesman-tyler-gronbach-insider-trades |title=Qwest Under Justice Dept. Microscope}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suthers serves as an adjunct professor at the University of Denver School of Law&lt;ref name=Faculty Profile: Attorney General John Suthers&gt;{{cite web |url=http://law.du.edu/index.php/profile/attorney-general-john-suthers |title=Faculty Profile: Attorney General John Suthers}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a scholar in residence at the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs.&lt;ref name=State Attorney General to Teach UCCS Course&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pressreleases.uccs.edu/?p=389 |title=State Attorney General to Teach UCCS Course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attorney general==
Following the election of [[Ken Salazar]] to the [[United States Senate]], John Suthers was nominated by Governor Owens and confirmed by the State Senate as the 37th Attorney General of Colorado in January 2005. Suthers served the remaining two years of Salazar's term before running for reelection in 2006. In November 2006, Suthers won election to the Attorney General's Office, defeating challenger Fern O'Brien by nine points. During the same election cycle, the Republican candidate for Governor, [[Bob Beauprez]], lost 56â40, and the Republican Secretary of State won by 1.5%.&lt;ref name=Election&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/electionresults2006G/ |title=2006 Election Results}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite being courted in 2008 and 2010 for runs for the U.S. Senate, Suthers chose to run for re-election. Suthers defeated his Democratic opponent in 2010 election by a 14-point margin&lt;ref name=&quot;9 News election results for 2010 Colorado Attorney General race&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.9news.com/news/elections/results/2010/results.aspx?racetype=OtherRaces&amp;raceid=44|title=Election results for 2010 Attorney General race}}&lt;/ref&gt; â the largest margin of victory in a two-way race in Colorado that year.

===Natural Resources===

Shortly after taking office, Suthers moved to swiftly resolve a series of longstanding natural-resource damages lawsuits, including disputes concerning natural resource damages at the California Gulch, Rocky Flats &lt;ref name=&quot;2005 Department of Law Annual Report&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/press_releases/2006/02/16/.pdf
|title=2005 Department of Law Annual Report}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rocky Mountain Arsenal Superfund sites. Two of the settlements were the largest natural resource damages settlements in Colorado history. The quarter-century-old claim for damages at the Rocky Mountain Arsenal Superfund settled in May 2008 for $35 million, which will be used for the restoration of the site and natural resources in and around the northeast Denver metro area site.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado Settles Rocky Mountain Arsenal Suit&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2008/05/29/colorado_settles_rocky_mountain_arsenal_suit |title=Colorado Settles Rocky Mountain Arsenal Suit}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suthers also oversaw a $20.5 million settlement, finalized in July 2008, to help remediate environmental damages at the California Gulch Superfund site, located near Leadville.&lt;ref name=&quot;Attorney General Suthers And Governor Ritter Announce California Gulch Settlement&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2008/07/01/attorney_general_suthers_and_governor_ritter_announce_california_gulch_settlem |title=Attorney General Suthers And Governor Ritter Announce California Gulch Settlement}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Suthersâ natural-resource achievements also include arguing before the U.S. Supreme Court&lt;ref name=&quot;Oral Argument Recap: Kansas v. Colorado&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotusblog.com/2008/12/oral-argument-recap-kansas-v-colorado/ |title=Oral Argument Recap: Kansas v.

Colorado water litigation. The ruling saved Colorado taxpayers more than $9 million in attorney fees and costs.&lt;ref name=&quot;U.S. Supreme Court sides with Colorado in legal fees dispute&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/newsheadlines/ci_11871538 |title=Supreme Court rules for Colo. in water war with Kansas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mortgage Fraud===

Since taking office, Suthers has made the criminal and civil enforcement of Colorado mortgage and foreclosure laws a top priority. Suthersâ efforts range from breaking up criminal enterprises aimed at committing mortgage&lt;ref name=&quot;Attorney General Suthers Announces Mortgage Fraud Indictment&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/press/news/2008/03/24/attorney_general_suthers_announces_mortgage_fraud_indictment |title=Attorney General Suthers Announces Mortgage Fraud Indictment}}&lt;/ref&gt; and lending&lt;ref name=&quot;Man convicted in Ponzi scheme&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://insiderealestatenews.com/2011/01/man-convicted-in-ponzi-scheme/ |title=Man convicted in Ponzi scheme}}&lt;/ref&gt; fraud to working to suing fraudulent mortgage rescue operations and lenders.&lt;ref name=&quot;Foreclosure- and Mortgage-Related Consumer Protection Cases&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/departments/consumer_protection/mortgage_fraud_information_center/learn_more_about_attorney_general%E2%80%99 |title=Foreclosure- and Mortgage-Related Consumer Protection Cases}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suthers and his office also have given financial support to the Colorado Foreclosure Hotline, which helps homeowners avoid foreclosure.&lt;ref name=&quot;AGâs office gives foreclosure hotline $600,000&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://csbj.com/2011/03/15/ags-office-give-foreclosure-hotline-600000/ |title=AGâs office gives foreclosure hotline $600,000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suthers efforts also extend beyond Colorado. He has testified before Congress on the foreclosure crisis,&lt;ref name=&quot;First Public Hearing of the FCIC&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fcic.law.stanford.edu/videos/view/21 |title=First Public Hearing of the FCIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; led a group of states in pushing to tighten the rules governing loan-servicing companies,&lt;ref name=&quot;NAAG Letter Re: Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rulemaking, Rule No. R911003&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/Mortgage%20Assistance%20Relief%20Services%20Rulemaking%2C%20Rule%20No.%20R911003%2C%20Comments%20by%2040%20Attorneys%20General.pdf |title=NAAG Letter Re: Mortgage Assistance Relief Services Rulemaking, Rule No. R911003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has served on a series of federal mortgage and foreclosure task forces.&lt;ref name=&quot;Coloradoâs Nationwide Efforts to Keep Borrowers in Their Homes&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.coloradoattorneygeneral.gov/departments/consumer_protection/mortgage_fraud_information_center/learn_more_about_colorado%E2%80%99s_nation |title=Coloradoâs Nationwide Efforts to Keep Borrowers in Their Homes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Internet Safety===

At the time Suthers became Coloradoâs 37th Attorney General, the state had no specific crimes concerning the conduct of online sexual predators. Suthers worked with the Colorado General Assembly in 2006 to pass Coloradoâs Internet luring and sexual exploitation statutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado House Bill 06-1011&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leg.state.co.us/clics2006a/csl.nsf/fsbillcont/949FE206CA2A2460872570980071A0F1?Open&amp;file=1011_enr.pdf |title=Colorado House Bill 06-1011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two years of implementation, 250 alleged pedophiles were arrested on the new charges.&lt;ref name=Arrests&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ago.state.co.us/press_detail.cfm?pressID=830|title=Online Luring Legislation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also as part of his efforts, Suthers launched a Safe Surfing Initiative to protect children from online predators.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ago.state.co.us/InternetSafety/SafeSurfing.cfm |title=Safe Surfing Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suthers also has been a strong advocate against drug abuse, ranging from his work on statewide prescription drug take-back events&lt;ref name=&quot;Drug take back events will occur across the state&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ourcoloradonews.com/centennial/newsreleases/drug-take-back-events-will-occur-across-the-state/article_3c1c9024-0015-11e1-a9e7-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Drug take back events will occur across the state}}&lt;/ref&gt; to his role as the chairman of the Colorado Meth Task Force.&lt;ref name=&quot;coloradomethproject.org&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coloradomethproject.org/documents/20060725%20-%20Colorado%20AG.pdf |title=coloradomethproject.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these roles, Suthers has visited schools&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado making strides in discouraging meth use&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_18050149?source=rss |title=Colorado making strides in discouraging meth use}}&lt;/ref&gt; and helped roll out awareness campaigns&lt;ref name=&quot;Colorado Meth Project Launches Statewide Meth Prevention Campaign&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fvgroup.com/news/CO%20Meth%20Launch%20PR%20050709.pdf |title=Colorado Meth Project Launches Statewide Meth Prevention Campaign}}&lt;/ref&gt; about the dangers of these drugs and the destructive effects they can have on a community. Suthers also has been at the forefront of efforts by law enforcement, educators and social workers to oppose the establishment of a marijuana industry in Colorado.&lt;ref name=&quot;Stateâs top cop has concerns about medical marijuana&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aspendailynews.com/section/home/136933 |title=Stateâs top cop has concerns about medical marijuana}}&lt;/ref&gt;
