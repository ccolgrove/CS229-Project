'''''Ãll az alku''''' ({{lang-en|It's a deal}}) is the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] version of ''[[Deal or No Deal]]'', originally created by a Dutch company. The show airs on [[TV2 (Hungary)|TV2]], and the host is GÃ¡bor Gundel TakÃ¡cs . There are 21 cases used in the format, with a top prize of 50,000,000  [[Hungarian forint|forints]] offered originally and increased to 100,000,000 forints on October 2, 2006 but reduced to 21,000,000 forints in 2009.

The show's first version, broadcast in [[2004]], aired on Friday nights and was a more than two-hour event. The first part of the show consisted of selecting the one player from the audience (all members of the studio audience were eligible to become the day's contestant), set in groups of 20 people, using multiple-choice questions. The group with the most correct answers got progressed to the second round, as well as a 21st person randomly selected from the rest of the groups. In the second round the two best players were selected using further questions. One of these players could opt out at this point, receiving a prize, however, if neither player did, a head-to-head round was played. The winner of this round got to choose one of the 21 metal cases to be their own, with the other twenty eliminated players getting their own cases. The twenty players could also win a part of the money in their cases if they guessed the contents of them correctly before opening them.

The show underwent a format change in 2006, with a revamp of the set and the running time reduced to thirty minutes. The question rounds were dropped in favour of a quicker game comprising only the case-opening. The show's new timeslot of every weekday night turned out as an unexpected success in ratings, so the programme's length was extended to 60 minutes, resulting in an unprecedented ratings victory over [[RTL Klub]]'s previously unbeatable prime time soap opera ''BarÃ¡tok KÃ¶zt'' (''Among Friends''). The show in its new format continued to air in 2006.

The show's ratings were disappointing due to the daily air period. 
TV2 purchased the [[1 vs 100]] format. This will air instead of Deal or No Deal. (Host not announced yet.) But the show was returned in 2009, hosted by Ãron KovÃ¡cs, the format is similar to the [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|US version]], and the top prize is greatly reduced to [http://www.google.com/search?hl=zh-TW&amp;q=21000000+HUF+in+USD&amp;btnG=%E6%90%9C%E5%B0%8B&amp;lr= 21,000,000] forints, which was won in April 2010.
