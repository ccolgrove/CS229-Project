Engineer of 4-6-0 ten-wheeler No. 382, [[Casey Jones|John Luther &quot;Casey&quot; Jones]], the only fatality, is wrongly found to be solely at fault by the ensuing investigation.

A communication error was determined to be the cause of the wreckâNight operator Clough is said to have admitted that he did not deliver a second order to Conductor Parker, which would superseded the previous order for the ''Crescent City Express'' (No.8) to proceed to Vails Station. Had the second order been delivered, it would have allowed the ''Pacific Coast Express'' (No.7) to pass unscathed.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;22 Dead; 45 Injured: The Estimated Casualties of the Southern Pacific Catastrophe Yesterday&quot;, ''Arizona Daily Star'', January 29, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Story of the Esmond Wreck Vividly Told&quot;, ''Arizona Daily Star'', February 1, 1903&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://homepage.mac.com/icafe/RitaRanch/TrainWreck.html&lt;/ref&gt;
