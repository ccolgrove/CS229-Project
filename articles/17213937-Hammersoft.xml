==Local Programs==
Unlike most of the other ABC Local stations outside the capital cities, ABC Coast FM originates most of its own programming and has a higher music content.  Breakfast, Mornings and Drive programs are a mix of music, news and current affairs.  Afternoons are predominantly music based. Weekends also contain a high music content.

Along with [[90.3 ABC Coast FM]] on the [[Sunshine Coast]] the station does not carry any of the [[ABC Rural]] programs such as ''The Country Hour''.  Both stations also uniquely rebroadcast the ABCâs digital only radio station [[ABC DiG|DiG]] at certain times.
