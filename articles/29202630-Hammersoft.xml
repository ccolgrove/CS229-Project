==Criticism==
===Homophobia===
Tyler has been criticized for his use of [[Homophobia|homophobic]] slurs, in particular, his frequent use of the epithet &quot;[[Faggot (slang)|faggot]]&quot; in his lyrics and on Twitter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/musicblog/2011/may/09/hip-hop-homophobia |title=Is hip-hop homophobia at a tipping point? |publisher=Guardian |date= May 10, 2011|accessdate=May 10, 2011 |location=London |first=Alex |last=MacPherson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2011/05/13/odd-future/ |title=Odd Future Plays Secret L.A. Show |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date= May 13, 2011|accessdate=May 13, 2011 |first=Todd |last=Gilchrist}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has denied accusations of homophobia, stating &quot;I'm not homophobic. I just say 'faggot' and use 'gay' as an adjective to describe stupid shit,&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Pattison&quot;&gt;Pattison, Louis (2011) &quot;Tyler, The Creator ''Goblin''&quot;, ''[[NME]]'', 14 May 2011, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Lester&quot;&gt;Lester, Paul (2011) &quot;[http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2011/may/07/tyler-the-creator-odd-future Tyler the Creator in the UK: forget hip-hop, we're the new Sex Pistols!]&quot;, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 7 May 2011, retrieved May 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;I'm not homophobic.

If it offends you, it offends you. If you call me a nigga, I really don't care, but that's just me, personally. Some people might take it the other way; I personally don't give a shit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1665860/tyler-the-creator-defends-lyrics.jhtml |title=Tyler, The Creator Defends His Use Of The Other F-Word |publisher=MTV |date= |accessdate=June 15, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/08/31/glaad-calls-vma-winner-tyler-the-creator-violently-anti-gay/|title=GLAAD calls VMA winner Tyler, The Creator âviolently anti-gayâ|publisher=Pink News|date=August 31, 2011|accessdate=2011-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
