==History==

===Test history===

:''See also: [[List of West Indian women's Test cricketers]]''

The first Test series played by the West Indies was at home to [[Australian women's cricket team|Australia]] in 1975-76, when both the three day matches were drawn. In 1976-77 the same team then played a six Test series away to [[Indian women's cricket team|India]]. They lost the fourth and then won the sixth Test by over an innings to level the series. The remaining games were drawn.

[[1979 English cricket season|1979]] then saw the Windies play their third Test series, this time away to [[English women's cricket team|England]]. However, they fared poorly, losing the first and third Tests and drawing the second to go down 2-0.

Finally, in 2003-04, after a 24 year wait, the West Indies resumed Test cricket with a one-off match away to [[Pakistani women's cricket team|Pakistan]], this time played over 4 days. The result was a draw.

===One-day international history===

When the first World Cup was played in 1973, the West Indies did not compete as an individual unit. Instead a separate team represented Jamaica, and another side represented Trinidad and Tobago. Additionally, three West Indian players participated in an International XI side that also competed in the 1973 World Cup. None of the teams fared well, however, with the International XI finishing in fourth place out of seven with a record of won three, lost two and one no result; Trinidad and Tobago finishing fifth with two wins and four losses; and Jamaica finishing sixth with one win, four losses and one match abandoned.

The first one-day internationals (ODIs) played by a combined West Indian side were two games away to [[English women's cricket team|England]] during their 1979 tour. Three ODIs were planned, but the second ODI was washed out without a ball being bowled. In the first ODI, England won comfortably by eights wickets, and in the third ODI saw the West Indies level the series with a two wicket win.

1993 saw West Indian players compete in a World Cup for the second time, this time as part of a combined team. They finished seventh, with only Denmark and the Netherlands below them, after winning only two and losing five of their seven matches. Their next games were in the 1997-98 World Cup, where they finished in ninth place, above only Denmark and Pakistan. The only match they won was the 9th place play-off game against the Danes.

2002-03 saw the [[Sri Lankan women's cricket team]] tour the West Indies and play a six-match ODI series, which the Sri Lankan's won six-nil. The closest match was the fourth, where the Windies went down by only 9 runs. 2003 saw the Windies greatest cricketing success, when they finished second in the International Women's Cricket Council Trophy, after winning four and losing one of their five games. The Trophy was competed for by the weaker ODI sides - Ireland, Windies, the Netherlands, Pakistan, Scotland and Japan.

2003-04 saw the Windies play five ODIs in [[Indian women's cricket team|India]] followed by a seven ODI and one Test tour to [[Pakistani women's cricket team|Pakistan]]. All five games against India were lost comfortably. As expected, the tour to Pakistan was more successful and the ODI series was won five-two.

They finished fifth in the 2004-05 World Cup, ahead of Sri Lanka, South Africa and Ireland, but behind Australia, India, New Zealand and India. They won two and lost three games, with one no result and one abandoned match. After being eliminated from the World Cup, the team stayed on to play three ODIs against [[South African women's cricket team|South Africa]] and won the series two-nil.
