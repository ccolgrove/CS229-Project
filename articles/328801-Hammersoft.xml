''' Shemale''' (also '''she-male''') is a term used in [[sex work]] to describe [[trans women]] with [[male]] [[penis|genitalia]] and augmented [[female]] [[breasts]] from [[breast augmentation]] and/or use of hormones.&lt;ref name=&quot;weinberg2009&quot;&gt;Weinberg MS, Williams CJ (2009). Men Sexually Interested in Transwomen (MSTW): Gendered Embodiment and the Construction of Sexual Desire. ''[[J Sex Res.]]'' 2009 Jun 19:1-10. PMID 19544216&lt;/ref&gt; According to Professors Laura CastaÃ±eda and Shannon Campbell at the [[University of Southern California]]'s [[Annenberg School of Journalism]], &quot;Using the term ''she-male'' for a transsexual woman would be considered highly offensive, for it implies that she is working 'in the (sex) trade.'&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;castaneda&quot;/&gt;

The term ''she-male'' has been used since the mid-19th century, when it was a humorous [[colloquialism]] for ''female'', especially an aggressive woman. 

== Academic use ==
Some [[biologist]]s have used ''she-male'' to refer to male non-human animals displaying female traits or behaviors, such as female pheromones being given off by male reptiles.&lt;ref&gt;Shine, R., Phillips, B., &amp; Waye, H., LeMaster, M., &amp; Mason, R. T. (2001). Benefits of female mimicry in snakes: She-male garter snakes exploit the amorous attentions of other males to warm up. ''Nature, 414'', 267.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mason, R.

Crews, ''Hormones, brain and behavior: Biology of the reptilia'', vol. 13, physiology E, pp. 70-113.&lt;/ref&gt; Biologist [[Joan Roughgarden]] has criticised the use of the term in the reptile literature, &quot;which she says is degrading and has been borrowed from the porn industry.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;flam&quot;&gt;Flam, Faye (2008).''The Score: How the Quest for Sex Has Shaped the Modern Man. ''Avery, ISBN 9781583333129&lt;/ref&gt; She writes that ''gynomorphic male'' and ''andromorphic female'' are preferred, adding, &quot;I hope future work on these animals is carried out with more professionalism.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;roughgarden&quot;&gt;Roughgarden, Joan (2005). ''Evolution's rainbow: diversity, gender, and sexuality in nature and people.'' University of California Press, ISBN 9780520246799&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is also used by some [[psychologist]]s to refer specifically to male-to-female transsexuals who have transitioned to female at least cosmetically, such as with breast augmentation, but have not undergone genital surgery.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blanchard1993&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;jhp&quot;&gt;Bailey, J.

Other slang terms for ''she-male'' that emerged from [[sex work]] include ''tranny'' and ''[[Kathoey|ladyboy]]'' as well as a number of rhyming terms (not to be confused with [[rhyming slang]]), including ''chicks with dicks'', ''sluts with nuts'', ''dolls with balls'', &amp; ''dudes with boobs''.&lt;ref name=&quot;International Ex&quot;&gt;{{cite book | last =Sigel | first =Lisa Z. | pages =254â271  | isbn = 0813535190, 9780813535197  | coauthors = John Phillips|chapter=Walking on The Wild Side: Shemale Internet Pornography

Some mental health researchers consider attraction to transgender people to be a [[paraphilia]]. [[John Money]] and [[Margaret Lamacz]] proposed a series of terms along these lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/0010-440X(84)90074-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Gynemimetophilia'' denotes [[sexual attraction]] to [[male-assigned]] people who look or act like women, including genetically male [[crossdresser]]s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Money, J. 1984&quot;/&gt; It can also refer to an attraction to [[trans women]]. A related term is ''gynemimesis'' which refers to a [[homosexual]] male who engages in female impersonation without sex reassignment&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=yIXG9FuqbaIC&amp;pg=PA408 Sexual deviance: theory, assessment ... - Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; or to describe the adoption of female characteristics by a male.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=zDS9kC03x2IC&amp;pg=PA74&amp;dq=gynandromorphy&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3#PPA75,M1 ''The Illustrated Dictionary of Sex: Gynemimism'']&lt;/ref&gt; The terms were used by Money for classification purposes in his [[transgender|gender-transposition]] theory.&lt;ref&gt;John Money, ''Gender-transposition theory and homosexual genesis'', [[Journal of Sex &amp; Marital Therapy]], Volume 10, Issue 2 Summer 1984 , pages 75 - 82&lt;/ref&gt; He also proposed ''[[gynandromorph]]'' and ''gynemimetomorph'' as technical terms for trans women.&lt;ref name=&quot;Money, J. 1984&quot;&gt;Money, J.

The term has since become an unflattering term applied to male-to-female transsexuals.&lt;ref name=&quot;herbst&quot;/&gt; Psychologists Dana Finnegan and Emily Mcnally write that the term &quot;tends to have demeaning connotations.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;finnegan2002&quot;&gt;Finnegan D, McNally E (2002).

In addition to its use in pornography, the term has been used as a [[punch line]] or for rhetorical effect. As part of the 42nd Street Art Project in 1994, designer [[Adelle Lutz]] turned a former shop in [[Times Square]] called American Male into &quot;American She-Male&quot;, with brightly-colored mannequins and clothes made of condoms.&lt;ref name=&quot;sagalyn&quot;&gt;Sagalyn, Lynne B.

Film critic [[Manohla Dargis]] has written about the lack of &quot;real women&quot; in summer blockbusters, claiming [[Judd Apatow]] comedies feature men who act more like leading ladies: &quot;These aren't the she-males you find in the back pages of ''[[The Village Voice]]'', mind you.
