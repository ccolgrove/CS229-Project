'''VistaPE''' is a project (set of scripts) for [[WinBuilder]] to create a [[Live CD]] based on the [[Windows kernel|kernel]] of [[Windows Vista]]. &lt;br&gt;
VistaPE uses technology from and largely resembles [[Windows Preinstallation Environment]] 2.0 (from Microsoft), but has a graphical shell, expanded set of supported devices and functions, and can run almost any Windows program.

==Features==
* Possibility to either fully or partially load VistaPE at startup into memory (boot.wim)
* Support for a large number of SATA/RAID/SCSI/NIC drivers (thanks to the [[DriverPacks]] project).
* Able to read and write NTFS/FAT32/FAT/Ext2/Ext3 partitions
* Full networking support
* Automatic hardware detection (PnP)
* Booting from CD/HDD/UFD/Network
* Compatibility with Microsoft Windows Vista
* A wide range of programs and shells (Explorer, LiteStep, BS Explorer ...)
* No limits regarding the maximum number of open processes
* Automatic creation shortcuts for programs
* Ability to remove VistaPE boot media while VistaPE is running (using boot.wim)
* Full multilanguage support

==Portable applications==
It is complicated to install applications on the RAM of a Live CD, and all the changes made to those programs and the installation itself will be lost once the computer is rebooted, so a good alternative is to use [[portable applications]], that can be run from either the Live CD, or from  a [[USB flash drive]] connected to the computer; there is even software dedicated to create those portable applications ([[VMware ThinApp]], [[Virtual Application Studio]] or [[Portable application creators|others]]).

==Notes==
The default Live CD is less than 200MB in size.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}
