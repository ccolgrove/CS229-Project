==Plot==
Raghunandhan (Vishal) works for the Income Tax Department in Goa and life is bliss with his newly married wife Mythili (Reema Sen) â but not for long. Vishwa (Bharath), the motherless adolescent and neighbour in Mythili's Chennai home, whom Mythili has a special attachment for, follows her to Goa. Raghu and Mythili fail to realise the imminent danger near them. Vishwa works out a devious plan to whisk away Mythili to Chennai and keep her in his father's holiday home on the city's outskirts. The case of the missing wife is solved after a series of interesting incidents.

The only irksome aspect is when Raghu appears to believe the old woman near their house, who crudely states that Mythili has eloped with Vishwa. He joins with his friend (Vivek), to find his wife. His venture is the rest of the film, with Vishwa holding Mythili captive in his beach house.
