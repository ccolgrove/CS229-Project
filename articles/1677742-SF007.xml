'''Wu Jingzi''' ({{zh|t=å³æ¬æ¢|s=å´æ¬æ¢|p=WÃº JÃ¬ngzÇ|w='''Wu Ching-tse'''}}, 1701âJanuary 11, 1754) was a [[China|Chinese]] scholar and writer who was born in the city now known as [[Chuzhou|Chuzhou, Anhui]] and who died in [[Yangzhou|Yangzhou, Jiangsu]].

==Biography==
Wu was born into a well-to-do family, his father Wu Linqi (å³éèµ·) was a [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] official, but met no success himself. He attempted the [[Jinshi (imperial examination)|Jinshi]] examination, but placed only at the county level. Poverty stricken by the age of thirty-two, he moved to [[Nanjing]], where he met and acquainted himself with many government officials.

Wu's family may have had ties to the famous philosophers Yan Yuan (é¢å) and Li Gong (æå¡¨). The philosophers emphasized the importance of ritual in [[Neo-Confucianism]] and may have influenced Wu's novel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Reviews&quot;&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ellen Widmer| title=Review of Literati Identity and Its Fictional Representations in Late Imperial China| journal=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies| year=1999| volume=59| issue=1| pages=290â300| doi=10.2307/2652696 | publisher=Harvard Journal of Asiatic Studies, Vol. 59, No. 1 | last2=Roddy | first2=Stephen J. | jstor=2652696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in Nanjing, in 1740, he started his famous novel ''[[The Scholars (Chinese novel)|Rulin Waishi]]''. There is a museum in his honor located in his hometown of Quanjiao county, now [[Chuzhou]].
