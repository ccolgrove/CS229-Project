'''Paul Henri de Leeuw''' (born March 26, 1962 in [[Rotterdam]]) is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[television]] [[comedian]], [[singer]] and [[actor]].

De Leeuw gained national fame in the late eighties and early nineties with television shows for broadcasting company [[VARA (broadcaster)|VARA]]. Though satire was only a part of these shows and much of its humour was essentially harmless, he came into publicity with satire about Dutch show business personalities who were often ridiculed. Besides, many obscure musical acts were featured in his shows, many of which managed to gain national fame after they had been in De Leeuw's show (e.g. [[Twarres]] and [[RenÃ© Klijn]], a former boyband member who contracted AIDS).{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} VARA has since continued his shows apart from a few interruptions, often with considerable success.

In the early nineties, Paul de Leeuw also had some shows celebrating the new year. In the 1993-1994 show he satirized the new commercial television station [[RTL 5]] by announcing another new station, &quot;RTL 6&quot; (''RTL six, beter dan niks'' (lit. better than nothing)). This led to a trial by the RTL company, who demanded that De Leeuw withdraw his joke.

He and his husband, sjaakie bouman, have adopted two children: son Kas (adopted in October 2001) and son{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} Tobey (adopted in December 2002).

Paul de Leeuw has had many hit singles in The Netherlands.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} He is most famous for: ''Vlieg met me mee'' (#2), ''Ik wil niet dat je liegt / Waarheen, waarvoor'' (#1), and '' 'k Heb je lief'' (#3). Since the beginning of his television and singing career he released albums and singles, always becoming a big success.

On [[Koninginnedag]] 2007 he was made a Knight of the [[Order of the Netherlands Lion]].

== 25th Anniversary ==
Paul de Leeuw until mid-[[2009]] hosted the weekly chat and comedy show ''[[Mooi! Weer De Leeuw]]''. On November 29, 2008 he celebrated his 25th television anniversary by staging a 12-hour marathon. Not forgetting the reason ''Mooi! Weer De Leeuw'' happened, he invited his one-time collaborator [[Jack Spijkerman]] (whose ''[[Kopspijkers]]''-show previously filled the ''Mooi! Weer De Leeuw'' time slot, before a row prompted [[Omroepvereniging VARA|VARA]] to cancel it with immediate effect) to reprise one item from ''Kopspijkers''; other guests included comedians [[Herman van Veen]] and [[Brigitte Kaandorp]], and singer/musical actor [[Danny de Munk]].

==Eurovision Song Contest 2006 incident==

De Leeuw is, despite being famous for a long time in the Netherlands, best-known internationally for presenting the results of the Dutch televote in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006]]. De Leeuw was supposed to present the televote by simply thanking the presenters, performers and fans, before giving the result, but instead the openly gay De Leeuw gave his [[mobile phone|mobile number]] to the male presenter [[Sakis Rouvas]] live on-air, and made other comments which somewhat lengthened the Dutch results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fZNh9OJHGA
  | accessdate = 2009-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Leeuw also made a reference to gay culture when he remarked that Rouvas and his female co-presenter [[Maria Menounos]] reminded him of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. As the results were live and required for the contest to continue, De Leeuw could not be cut off until he finished giving the voting results.

De Leeuw's actions resulted in negative comments from the commentators, with the [[BBC]]'s [[Terry Wogan]] calling the act &quot;pathetic&quot; and asking &quot;Who selected this [[wikt:eejit|eejit]]?&quot; during the [[United Kingdom]] coverage of the contest. Other commentators, like the Portuguese [[ElÃ¡dio ClÃ­maco]], didn't translate properly the gay remarks and said &quot;he was saying that they really look like Greeks&quot;. De Leeuw presented the votes again for the Netherlands at the 2007 contest, and that time did not cause quite as much of a stir as he did the year before.

==Animal rights dispute and controversy==
During a 2008 episode of ''Mooi! Weer De Leeuw'', a vegan streaker wanting to draw attention to animal suffering managed to enter the sound stage. His body was covered in slogans such as &quot;Stop animal suffering&quot; and &quot;Meat is murder&quot;. De Leeuw stopped security from escorting him from the stage in order to talk with him. De Leeuw proceeded to pull the man onto his lap and started poking at his underwear, insisting on &quot;seeing his meat&quot;. As the man stood up, De Leeuw pulled down and eventually ripped off his underwear, saying, &quot;then you must properly streak; off with those briefs.&quot;

The streaker later filed a police report, although the molestation charges have since been dropped. Some parents were shocked by the incident as the show was targeted at families as well.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.showbiznewz.nl/artikel_1519_streaker-paul-de-leeuw-doet-aangifte-wegens-aanranding.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.depers.nl/binnenland/177884/Streaker-in-uitzending-Paul-de-Leeuw.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==IsraÃ«lean broadcast commotion==
De Leeuw identifies as a strong '''Eurovision Song Contest''' follower with his own perspectives and beliefs. He presented the Dutch Eurovision occasionally as a host and commentator in 1993, 1994, 1998, 1999, 2000, 2001, 2006 en 2007. In 1998 and 1999 together with Linda de Mol. In 1995 a lot of commotion came out of this because he had started a tirade and outburst against the IsraÃ«lean broadcasting 'Amen'.
