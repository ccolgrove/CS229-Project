==History==

[[Image:Charles P. Adams bust at Grambling State Univ. IMG 3649.JPG|200px|left|thumb|Bust of Charles P. Adams, the founder and first president of Grambling State University]]

Grambling State was founded in 1901 and accredited in 1949. The school became Grambling College in 1946 named after a [[sawmill]] owner, [[P.G. Grambling]], who donated a parcel of land for the school to be constructed. With the addition of graduate departments, Grambling gained university status in 1974. Grambling State University emerged from the desire of African-American farmers in rural north Louisiana who wanted to educate other African Americans in the northern part of the state. In 1896, the North Louisiana Colored Agriculture Relief Association was formed to organize and operate a school. After opening a small school west of what is now the town of Grambling, the Association requested assistance from [[Booker T. Washington]] of [[Tuskegee Institute]] in [[Alabama]]. Charles P. Adams, sent to aid the group in organizing an industrial school, became its founder and first president.

Under Adamsâ leadership, the Colored Industrial and Agricultural School opened on November 1, 1901. Four years later, the school moved to its present location and was renamed the North Louisiana Agricultural and Industrial School. By 1928, the school was able to offer two-year professional certificates and diplomas after becoming a state junior college. The school was renamed Louisiana Negro Normal and Industrial Institute.

In 1936, the program was reorganized to emphasize rural education. It became known as &quot;The Louisiana Plan&quot; or &quot;A Venture in Rural Teacher Education.&quot; Professional teaching certificates were awarded when a third year was added in 1936, and the first baccalaureate degree was awarded in 1944 in elementary education. The institutionâs name was changed to Grambling College in 1946 in honor of a white sawmill owner, P.G. Grambling, who donated a parcel of land for the school. Thereafter, the college prepared secondary teachers and added curricula in sciences, liberal arts and business. With these programs in effect, the school was transformed from a single purpose institution of teacher education into a multipurpose college. In 1949, the college was accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS). The Grambling science building is one of twenty-six public structures in Louisiana constructed by the contractor [[George Caldwell (Louisiana)|George A. Caldwell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lahistory.org/site20.php
|title=Caldwell, George A.|publisher=[[Louisiana Historical Association]], ''A Dictionary of Louisiana Biography'' (lahistory.org)|accessdate=December 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the addition of graduate programs in early childhood and elementary education gave the school a new status and a new name â Grambling State University.

From 1977 to 2000, the university grew and prospered. Several new academic programs were incorporated and new facilities were added to the {{convert|384|acre|km2|sing=on}} campus, including a business and computer science building, school of nursing, student services building, stadium, stadium support facility and an intramural sports center. In 2006, Grambling State was the setting for the [[Black Entertainment Television]] network docudrama &quot;[[Season of the Tiger]],&quot; which chronicled the daily lives of members of the football team and marching band throughout the 2005 season.

[[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[George B. Holstead]] of Ruston, whose grandfather had been instrumental in the founding of Louisiana Tech, worked to increase state appropriations for both Louisiana Tech and Grambling State University during his legislative tenure from 1964-1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://74.125.45.132/search?=cache:eVIj7R5RyuMJ:freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~halstead/lemuel/d1.html+George+B.+Holstead,+Jr.&amp;cd=1&amp;hl=en&amp;ct=clnk&amp;gl=us|title=Descendants of Lemuel Holstead|publisher=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=April 25, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, a state audit showed that GSU lost money on an illegal stock purchase and was in violation of two state laws. [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Francis C. Thompson]], a [[Delhi, Louisiana|Delhi]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], urged the state to conduct financial oversight at Grambling and at other institutions in view of the audit.&lt;ref name=mns&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenewsstar.com/article/20100701/NEWS01/7010325/1002/Thompson++State+should+look+at+GSU|title=Stephen Largen, Thompson: State should look at Grambling State,  Lawmakers call for safety net to catch problems, July 1, 2010|publisher=''[[Monroe News Star]]''|accessdate=July 12, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audit claims that GSU illegally invested $2.6 million in the stock market with money that had been reserved for university facilities. Thompson said that the state should &quot;develop a safety net if something can fall through the cracks like this.&quot;&lt;ref name=mns/&gt;

===University presidents===
Following the first university president Charles P. Adams, [[Ralph Waldo Emerson Jones]] became the second president and the highly successful baseball coach from 1936 until his retirement in 1977. Five presidents served from 1977 to 2001: Dr. Joseph Benjamin Johnson, Dr. Harold W. Lundy, Dr. Raymond Hicks, Dr. Leonard Haynes III and Dr. Steve A. Favors. The advent of a new millennium and the beginning of a second century of service ushered in Grambling State Universityâs first female president, Dr. Neari Francois Warner. Warner served a three-year interim term. Dr. Horace Judson, who became the institutionâs seventh president in 2004, led the most ambitious 5-year campaign to rebuild the institution's facilities. On Wednesday, October 21, 2009, Judson announced his resignation effective October 31, 2009. The current president is Frank Pogue.
