'''Signal Hill''' is a small [[city]] (2.2&amp;nbsp;miÂ², 5.7&amp;nbsp;kmÂ²) in [[California]] located in the [[Greater Los Angeles area]]. Signal Hill, completely surrounded by the city of [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], was [[Municipal corporation|incorporated]] on April 22, 1924, roughly three years after oil was discovered in Signal Hill. As of the 2010 census, the city population was 11,016.

Signal Hill lies in the [[Area code 562|562 area code]]. The city once shared three different postal [[ZIP code]]s with the city of Long Beach but in July 2002, the city of Signal Hill received its own ZIP code, 90755.

==History==
The hill that the city is named after is 365 feet (110 m) above the surrounding town of Long Beach. Because of this height, it was used by the local [[Tongva people|Tongva]] [[American Indians in the United States|Indian]]s for [[Smoke signal|signal fire]]s that could be seen throughout the surrounding area and even out to [[Santa Catalina Island, California|Catalina Island]], {{convert|26|mi|km}} away.

After the Spanish discovered  ''[[Alta California]]'' (&quot;Upper California,&quot; or what is now the state of California), Signal Hill eventually became part of the first large rancho grant to be allotted under Spanish rule in Alta California. The [[Rancho San Pedro]] (Dominguez Rancho) land grant exceeded {{convert|74000|acre|km2}} as granted to a soldier, [[Manuel Dominguez#Juan Jose Dominguez|Juan Jose Dominguez]], who accompanied Junipero Serra, by Governor Fages through authority of [[Charles III of Spain|King Carlos III]] of [[Spain]] in 1784.

Between 1913 and 1923 an early California movie studio, Balboa Amusement Producing Company (also known as Balboa Studios), was located in Long Beach and used 11 acres (45,000&amp;nbsp;mÂ²) on Signal Hill for outdoor locations. [[Buster Keaton]] and [[Fatty Arbuckle]] were two of Balboa Studio actors who had films shot on Signal Hill.

Before oil was discovered in Signal Hill, there were large homes built on the hill itself, and in the lower elevations was an agricultural area where fruits, vegetables, and flowers were grown. Many of the truck farmers were Japanese.

===Oil is discovered on Signal Hill===
{{Wide image|Signal Hill California 1923.jpg|1000px|Signal Hill c1923}}
Signal Hill changed forever when oil was discovered. The hill would soon become part of the [[Long Beach Oil Field]], one of the most productive [[oil fields]] in the world.&lt;ref name=&quot;MMS&quot;&gt;Schmitt, R. J., Dugan, J. E., and M. R. Adamson. &quot;Industrial Activity and Its Socioeconomic Impacts:
Oil and Three Coastal California Counties.&quot; MMS OCS Study 2002-049. Coastal Research Center, Marine Science Institute, University of California, Santa Barbara, California. MMS Cooperative Agreement Number 14-35-01-00-CA-31603. 244 pages; p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; On June 23, 1921, [[Shell Oil Company]]'s Alamitos #1 well erupted. The [[natural gas|gas]] pressure was so great the [[oil gusher|gusher]] rose 114&amp;nbsp;ft (35 m) in the air. Soon Signal Hill was covered with over 100 [[Oil_derrick#Oil_derrick|oil derrick]]s, and because of its prickly appearance at a distance became known as &quot;Porcupine Hill&quot;.

The city was incorporated on April 22, 1924. Among the reasons for incorporating was avoiding annexation by Long Beach with its zoning restrictions and per-barrel oil tax. Signal Hill's first mayor, Jessie Nelson, was also California's first female mayor.

===Later years===
One of the city's more colorful residents was the boxer [[Kid Mexico]] (real name, Tod Faulkner) who was the state's [[bantamweight]] champion in 1914 (at age 14&amp;mdash;he had lied about his age) and the state's [[welterweight]] champion in 1925. He put his earnings into businesses and real estate in Signal Hill, including an eight lane [[bowling alley]], restaurant, cocktail lounge, auditorium, and movie house. He also had a [[Bingo (US)|bingo parlor]] that was ignored by the local police for many years. He was well-known for his large annual Christmas parties for children from Signal Hill and Long Beach. Besides his bowling alley, he also had a single lane for bowling in his nearby home. Eventually he was arrested for [[gambling]], [[tax evasion]], and [[election fraud]] (Davis, 2006, p.&amp;nbsp;62-64).

Today, many of the oil wells and [[nodding donkey]] oil pumps are gone, although some remain. Signal Hill is now a mix of residential and commercial areas.
