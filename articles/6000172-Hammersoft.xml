The '''Ohio State Buckeyes football''' team is an intercollegiate [[Varsity team|varsity sports]] team of [[The Ohio State University]]. The team is a member of the [[Big Ten Conference]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]], playing at the [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] Football Bowl Subdivision, formerly Division I-A, level. The team nickname is derived from the [[Floral emblem|state tree]] of [[Ohio]]. The Buckeyes have played their home games in [[Ohio Stadium]], more commonly called &quot;The Horseshoe,&quot; since 1922. 

In their 121-year history, the Buckeyes claim seven [[NCAA Division I FBS national football championship|national championships]], but were consensus national champions six times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web1.ncaa.org/web_files/stats/football_records/DI/2010/2010FBS.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; On September 6, 2008, the Buckeyes defeated the [[Ohio Bobcats football|Ohio Bobcats]], 26&amp;ndash;14, for their 800th win, becoming the fifth FBS team to reach the mark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cfbdatawarehouse.com/data/misc/div_ia_wins.php | title= Division I-A All-Time Wins | accessdate= 2008-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{main|History of Ohio State Buckeyes football}}
{{see also|List of Ohio State Buckeyes football seasons}}

===1890â1933: beginnings===
In the spring of 1890 George Cole, an undergraduate, persuaded [[Alexander S. Lilley]] to coach a football team at the Ohio State University. The Buckeyes first game, played on May 3, 1890, at [[Delaware, Ohio]], against [[Ohio Wesleyan University]], was a victory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jack Park|title=The Official Ohio State Football Encyclopedia|publisher=Sports Publishing LLC|isbn= 1-58261-006-1|year=2002|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OSU's first home game took place at 2:30 p.m. on November 1, 1890. The Ohio State University played the [[The College of Wooster|University of Wooster]] on this site, which was then called Recreation Park. Just east of historic German Village, the park occupied the north side of Schiller (now Whittier) between Ebner and Jaeger in what is now Schumacher Place. The weather was perfect, and the crowd cheered loudly. Nonetheless, OSU lost to Wooster, 64â0. Wooster, physically fit for the game, showed OSU that training is critical to winning. Thus, the tradition of training continues. 

[[File:1916 Ohio Field.jpg|350px|thumb|[[Chic Harley]] runs around the end in the 1916 Big Ten Championship game between Northwestern &amp; Ohio St.]]Over the next eight years, under a number of coaches, the team played to a cumulative record of 31 wins, 39 losses, and 2 ties. The first game against the [[University of Michigan]], in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]], was a 34-0 loss in 1897, a year that saw the low point in Buckeye football history with a 1â7â1 record. Jack Ryder was Ohio State's first paid coach, earning $150 per season, and lost his first game, against [[Oberlin College]] and [[John Heisman]], on October 15, 1892.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Christopher (2009). ''Ohio State Football Football Huddleup'', Triumph Books (Random House, Inc.), ISBN 978-1-60078-186-5, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1899 the university hired John Eckstorm to bring professional coaching skills to the program and immediately went undefeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;Spring08&quot;&gt;[http://ohiostatebuckeyes.com/fls/17300/pdf/fb/guide/08_Spring_p100to129.pdf?SPSID=87751&amp;SPID=10408&amp;DB_OEM_ID=17300 Ohio State Spring Football 2008 - Part 2], OSU Athletics, Spring 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1901, however, [[Center (American football)|center]] John Segrist was fatally injured in a game and the continuation of football at Ohio State was in serious question. Although the school's athletic board let the team decide its future, Eckstorm resigned.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p.28&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1912 football underwent a number of developments that included joining the [[Big Ten Conference|Western Conference]], making football as part of a new Department of Athletics, and hiring [[Lynn St. John|Lynn W. St. John]] to be [[athletic director]]. 

[[Chic Harley]] attended East High in Columbus and was one of the greatest players to attend an Ohio high school. He passed, ran, received, punted, kicked and played defense. Harley came to Ohio State in 1916 and Columbus fans instantly fell in love with the Chic. Harley and the Buckeyes won the very first Big Ten championship in school history in 1916 when the Buckeyes finished 7â0. He would repeat in 1917 finshing 8â0â1, giving the Buckeyes a second outright title. In 1918, he left to be a pilot in the air force for [[World War I]]. With Harley's return in 1919, the Buckeyes would only lose one gameâto Illinois. Chic Harley left OSU with a career record of 22â1â1. At the time, OSU played at the small [[Ohio Field]] and Harley brought such record crowds it became necessary to open [[Ohio Stadium]] in 1922. The stadium was built entirely on fan donations and several stadium drives around the city where Harley would often appear. In 1951, when the [[College Football Hall of Fame]] opened, Harley was inducted as an inaugural member.

Ohio State's very first rival was [[Kenyon College]], a small liberal arts college in [[Gambier, Ohio|Gambier]], roughly 50 miles to the northeast. The Buckeyes first played them in their first season in 1890 on Nov. 27, Kenyon won the first two meetings; however, Ohio State won 15 in a row and the rivalry diminished.  Kenyon made it their season goal to defeat OSU. After the Bucks joined the Big Ten they stopped playing Kenyon. The all time record stands at 18-6, OSU.

===1934â1950: the rise of a powerhouse===
In hiring [[Francis Schmidt]] in March 1934 to coach its football team, Ohio State moved its program to a &quot;big-time&quot; level of competition. Schmidt was a well-established coach and an acknowledged offensive innovator. His offensive schemes were a &quot;wide-open&quot; style called &quot;razzle-dazzle&quot; and led him to be the first Buckeye football coach granted a multi-year contract. Schmidt's first four seasons saw victories over archrival Michigan, all by shut-out. The 1935 squad went 7-1, its sole loss was to [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], 18-13, in the first contest between the programs. However Schmidt's remaining seasons were less successful, except in 1939 when the Buckeyes won the Big Ten championship, and his popularity faded for a number of reasons.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p.166.&lt;/ref&gt; On December 17, 1940, he resigned.

Ohio State hired the coach of [[Massillon Washington High School]] football team, [[Paul Brown]], to succeed Schmidt. Brown's Tigers had just won their sixth straight state championship. Brown immediately changed Ohio State's style of offense, planned and organized his program in great detail, and delegated to his assistant coaches using highly structured practices. In 1942, Ohio State lost 22 veteran players to military service as the United States joined [[World War II]], and with a team of mostly sophomores went on to lose only once in winning its first national championship. Brown accepted a commission in the [[United States Navy]] in 1944 and directed his assistant Carroll Widdoes to head the team in his absence. The 1944 team fielded 31&amp;nbsp;[[First year|freshmen]] but went undefeated and untied, including a victory over Paul Brown's Great Lakes Navy team. Ohio State finished second in the national rankings behind [[United States Military Academy#Other sports|Army]] and [[Les Horvath]] became the first Buckeye to be awarded the [[Heisman Trophy]]. Also prominent on the 1942â44 teams was the first Buckeye [[African American]] star, [[Bill Willis]].

Brown chose not to return to Ohio State after the war, going into professional football instead. Widdoes, despite having the highest two-year winning percentage of any Buckeye coach, asked to return to an assistant's position. Offensive coordinator [[Paul Bixler]] and Widdoes switched positions, and Bixler endured a mediocre 4â3â2 season. Bixler resigned and talk of Ohio State being a &quot;graveyard of coaches&quot; became commonplace, a reputation that lingered for decades.&lt;ref name=&quot;SIbix&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/football/ncaa/specials/preview/2006/teams/ten/ohiost.html| title = 2006 Team previews- Ohio State| work =  | publisher = SI.com| accessdate = 20 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wes Fesler]] became head coach in 1947 but finished last in the Big Ten for the only time in team history. Ohio State improved greatly in 1948, winning 6 and losing 3, then in 1949 enjoyed a successful season due to the play of sophomore [[Vic Janowicz]]. Ohio State received the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] invitation, where they came from behind to defeat [[California Golden Bears|California]]. In 1950 Fesler, rumored to be resigning because of pressures associated with the position and abuse of his family by anonymous critics, returned to coach the Buckeyes, who won six games in a row to move into the top ranking in the AP poll. However the season fell apart as the Buckeyes lost to Michigan during a [[blizzard]], a game that came to be known as the &quot;[[Snow Bowl (1950)|Snow Bowl]]&quot;. Two weeks later, citing concerns about his health and family, Fesler resigned.

===1951â1978: the Woody Hayes era===
[[Woody Hayes|Wayne Woodrow Hayes]] beat out Paul Brown,&lt;ref&gt;Park, p.275&lt;/ref&gt; among others, to be named head coach on February 18, 1951. He instituted a demanding practice regimen and was both aggressive and vocal in enforcing it, alienating many players accustomed to Fesler's laid-back style. The 1951 Buckeyes won 4, lost 3, and tied 2, leaving many to question the ability of the new coach. In 1952 the team improved to 6-3, and recorded their first victory over Michigan in eight years, but after a 1953 loss to Michigan, critics called for the replacement of Hayes.

In 1954 the Buckeyes were picked to finish no higher than 10th in the Big Ten. Hayes, however, had the talents of [[Howard &quot;Hopalong&quot; Cassady]], and a historic goal-line stand against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season. Hayes led the powerhouse Buckeyes to a shared national championship (his first and the team's second). In 1955 the team again won the Big Ten, set an attendance record, and won in Ann Arbor for the first time in 18&amp;nbsp;years, while Hopalong Cassady was securing the Heisman Trophy. Ohio State passed only three times against Michigan (the sole reception was the only completion in the final three games of the year), leading to characterization of Hayes' style of offensive play as &quot;three yards and a cloud of dust&quot;.

In a 1955 article in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', Hayes admitted making small personal loans to financially needy players.&lt;ref name=&quot;sishaplen&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html| title = #11âIowa at Ohio StateâNovember 11, 1957| work =  | publisher = The Buckeye 50 Yard Line| accessdate = 2 October 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20061127011223/http://www.buckeye50.com/Drive_Drive_Down_the_field_15_to_11.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The article resulted in a furor over possible violations of [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] rules, and the faculty council, followed by the Big Ten and NCAA, conducted lengthy investigations. Big Ten Commissioner Kenneth &quot;Tug&quot; Wilson found Hayes and the program guilty of violations and placed it on a year's probation in 1956. In 1957 Ohio State won all of its remaining games after an opening loss to claim the Big Ten championship, win the Rose Bowl over [[University of Oregon|Oregon]], and share a national championship title with [[Auburn University|Auburn]], for which Hayes was named [[Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]]. 

In 1961 the team went undefeated to be named national champions by the [[Football Writers Association of America|FWAA]] but a growing conflict between academics and athletics over Ohio State's reputation as a &quot;football school&quot; resulted in a faculty council vote to decline an invitation to the Rose Bowl, resulting in much public protest and debate.&lt;ref&gt;Park, pp. 340 and 342.&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next 6 seasons Ohio State finished no higher than 2nd, and had a losing season in 1966, and public speculation that Hayes would be replaced as coach grew to its highest point since 1953. 

In 1968 Ohio State defeated the number one-ranked [[Purdue Boilermakers]] and continued to an undefeated season including a 50-14 rout of Michigan and a Rose Bowl victory over the [[USC Trojans]] that resulted in the national championship. The Class of 1970 became known as the &quot;super sophomores&quot; in 1968, and might have gone on to three consecutive national championships except for what may have been the bitterest loss in Buckeye history. The winning streak reached 22 games as Ohio State traveled to Michigan. The Buckeyes were 17-point favorites but directed by first-year coach [[Bo Schembechler]], Michigan shocked the Buckeyes in a 24-12 upset.

The 1969 loss to Michigan initiated what came to be known as &quot;The Ten Year War,&quot; in which the rivalry, which pitted some of OSUâs and UMâs strongest teams ever, rose to the uppermost level of all sports and the competition between Schembechler and Hayes became legendary.&lt;ref name=&quot;maisel&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://proxy.espn.go.com/ncf/columns/story?columnist=maisel_ivan&amp;id=1667333| title = UM-OSU more than just a game| format = | work =  | publisher = ESPN| accessdate = 13 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four times between 1970 and 1975, Ohio State and Michigan were both ranked in the top five of the AP Poll before their matchup. Hayes had the upper hand during the first part of the war, in which Ohio State won the conference championship and went to the Rose Bowl four straight years, while Michigan won the final three. 

[[Archie Griffin]] came to Ohio State in 1972, set a new Buckeye single-game rushing record and led the team in rushing for the season. The following season Hayes installed an [[I formation]] attack with Griffin at tailback and the Buckeyes went undefeated with a powerful offense and equally impenetrable defense, the only blemish on their record a 10-10 tie with Michigan. The falloff in success of Hayes' last three years was not great, but it resulted in growing criticism of Hayes and his methods, particularly his on-field fits of temper and abuse of officials. 

His downfall was sudden and shocking: at the 1978 [[Gator Bowl]], Hayes punched [[Clemson Tigers|Clemson]] [[nose guard]] Charlie Bauman and abused the referee in frustration after Bauman's 4th quarter interception sealed a Buckeye loss. Hayes was assessed two 15-yard unsportsmanlike conduct penalties, ejected, and fired after the game.

===1979â2000: the Bruce and Cooper years===
Hayes was replaced by a former protegÃ©, [[Earle Bruce]], who inherited a strong team led by sophomore quarterback [[Art Schlichter]] and returned to the [[Rose Bowl (game)|Rose Bowl]] with an opportunity once again to be national champions. The Buckeyes lost both by a single point, but Bruce was named [[Paul &quot;Bear&quot; Bryant Award|Coach of the Year]]. His success was hailed by those in the media who saw it as a rebuke of Hayes and the start of a &quot;new era&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;earle&quot;&gt;{{cite news | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946372-1,00.html| title = Making 'Em Forget Woody| work =  | publisher = Time Magazine| accessdate = 11 December 2006 | date=November 12, 1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1980, however, saw the start of a trend that eventually brought criticism to Bruce, when Ohio State finished with a 9â3 record. This was the first of six consecutive years at 9-3. While each of these seasons, and a 10â3 season that followed them, culminated in a bowl game, Ohio State did not appear to be any closer to a national championship than during the end of the Hayes era. 

In 1986 Bruce received a 3-year contract, the first for the modern program, but the team opened with two losses for the first time in over 90 years. The Buckeyes then won nine in a row before losing to Michigan in a close game. After the season Bruce was offered the position of head coach at the [[University of Arizona]] but was persuaded to stay at his [[alma mater]] by Athletic Director Rick Bay. Hopes for a standout season in 1987 suffered a serious setback when All-American wide receiver [[Cris Carter]] was dropped from the team for signing with an agent. Heading into the Michigan game at the end of the season Ohio State was in the midst of a three game conference losing streak.

On the Monday of Michigan week, after a weekend of rumors and speculation, Ohio State President [[Edward Harrington Jennings|Edward Jennings]] fired Bruce but tried to keep the dismissal secret until after the end of the season. Jennings aggravated the situation by refusing to provide a reason for the dismissal,&lt;ref&gt;Park, pp. 537-538&lt;/ref&gt; but the Buckeyes enjoyed an emotional come-from-behind victory over Michigan after the entire team wore [[headband]]s bearing the word &quot;EARLE.&quot;

[[John Cooper (American football)|John Cooper]] was hired as head coach with a winning record at both [[University of Tulsa|Tulsa]] and [[Arizona State University]] that stood out among his credentials, as did a victory over Michigan in the 1987 Rose Bowl. Cooper's thirteen years as the Buckeyes' head coach are largely remembered for a litany of negative statistics associated with him: a notorious 2â10â1 record against Michigan, a 3â8 record in bowl games, a five year losing streak to Illinois, and blowing a 15 point 3rd quarter lead and losing 28-24 against the unranked Michigan State Spartans in '98 after the Buckeyes had been ranked number 1 since the preseason. However, his tenure also included many positives: back-to-back victories over Notre Dame, two second-ranked finishes in the polls, and three Big Ten championships (albeit shared). Cooper also recruited fifteen players who were first-round draft picks in the [[National Football League]].&lt;ref name=&quot;coopbio&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/mtt/cooper_john01.html| title = John Cooper Profile| work =  | publisher = TOSU Football Official Site| accessdate = 19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, Ohio State University dismissed Cooper for a &quot;deteriorating climate.&quot; A loss in the 2000 [[Outback Bowl]] was a factor in his subsequent firing, as was negative publicity regarding player behavior before and during the game. Other contributing factors included his record against Michigan (which was actually considered by most people to be the biggest reason for his firing), his perceived inability to win &quot;big games&quot;, the lack of a national championship, the perception of him as an outsider by many alumni, the poor bowl game record, and finally a perceived lack of discipline on the team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B06E5DB103BF930A35752C0A9679C8B63 |title=COLLEGE FOOTBALL; Cooper Fired at Ohio State |accessdate=2008-05-04 | work=The New York Times | date=January 3, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2001â2011: the Tressel era===
Ohio State quickly sought a replacement for Cooper and after a nationwide search hired Jim Tressel. With four NCAA [[Division I (NCAA)#Football Championship Subdivision|Division I-AA]] National Championships at [[Youngstown State University]], Tressel, formerly an assistant coach for Earle Bruce, was an Ohioan who was considered to be appreciative of Buckeye football traditions. Although there were some doubts as to whether or not Tressel could repeat his earlier success at the Division 1A level, most fans and alumni met the coaching change with enthusiasm. On the day of his hiring, Jim Tressel, speaking to fans and students at a Buckeye basketball game, made a prophetic implication that he would lead the Buckeyes to beat Michigan in Ann Arbor the following November.&lt;ref name=&quot;310days&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.michigandaily.com/news/2001/07/23/Sports/Tressel.Eyes.Finally.Bucking.The.Wolverines-1408404.shtml | title = Tressel Eyes Finally Bucking the Wolverines| work =  | publisher = The Michigan Daily| accessdate = 11 December 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:2006 09 09 Ohio State vs Texas.jpg|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Troy Smith in 2006]]Tressel's first season was difficult as the Buckeyes finished 7-5 (all but one loss was by a touchdown or less), but he made good on his promise, beating Michigan in Ann Arbor. While its fans were optimistic about the chance for success of the 2002 team, most observers were surprised by Ohio State's [[2002 Ohio State Buckeyes football team|National Championship]].&lt;ref name=&quot;surprised&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.covers.com/articles/articles.aspx?theArt=99132&amp;tid=30| title = BCS National Title Game Bowl preview| format = | work =  | publisher = Covers.com| accessdate = 13 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The Buckeyes lost both by wide margins. On January 1, 2010, the Buckeyes defeated the Oregon Ducks in The Rose Bowl Game by a score of 26-17. This ended a 3 game BCS losing streak for Ohio State, having lost 2 National Championships and one Tostitos Fiesta Bowl. Terelle Pryor was named MVP of the contest with 2 touchdown passes for a career-high 266 passing yards. In addition, he had more total yards than the entire Oregon Ducks team.

In December 2010 it was announced that five student-athletes on the Ohio State University football team will be suspended from the first five games of the 2011 season for NCAA violations. The punishments stem from an incident in which at least some of the Buckeye players received tattoos for their autographs, according to news reports. Other violations committed by the players included the selling of several items given to them by the University, such as championship rings.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/23/5-ohio-state-football-players-suspended/?hpt=T1 | work=CNN | title=Terrelle Pryor, 5 other Ohio State football players suspended &amp;ndash; This Just In}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2011, Ohio State completed its season with a 31-26 win over Arkansas in the Sugar Bowl. The Sugar Bowl win would have marked Ohio State's first bowl victory over a Southeastern Conference opponent in ten attempts, but the win was later vacated due to NCAA violations.&lt;ref name=SEC&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2011/writers/andy_staples/01/05/sugar.bowl.ohiostate.arkansas/index.html | work=CNN | title=Buckeyes, Big Ten show they can rival both SEC's teams and ethics | date=January 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohio State ended up with an 0-1 record for the 2010 season after vacating wins for NCAA violations.

On March 8, 2011 Jim Tressel was suspended for 2 games, and fined $250,000 for not informing the university and the NCAA that he had information that 5 of his players received improper benefits from a tattoo shop in downtown Columbus. Among those 5 players, including Mike Adams, Dan Herron, DeVier Posey, Solomon Thomas, Jordan Whiting, was quarterback [[Terrelle Pryor]]. The 5 players are suspended for the first 5 games of the 2011 season. Coach Tressel's suspension was also later increased to 5 games by the University. The NCAA filed a letter of allegations in late April, 2011 with Ohio State University alleging that Tressel lied to the NCAA in December, 2010 when he claimed to have no knowledge of the players activities with the tattoo shop. Furthermore, he is alleged to have knowingly used ineligible players during the 2010 season.  On May 30, 2011 Jim Tressel resigned as head coach.&lt;ref&gt;Dohrmann, George, &quot;The Fall of Jim Tressel&quot;, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 6 June 2011, pp. 40-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 6 June 2011 story in ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' reported that at least 28 players, including [[Rob Rose (American football)|Rob Rose]], T. J. Downing, Louis Irizarry, Chris Vance, C. J. Barnett, Dorien Bell, Jamaal Berry, Bo DeLande, Zach Domicone, Storm Klein, [[Etienne Sabino]], John Simon, Nathan Williams, [[Jermale Hines]], Devon Torrence, [[Donald Washington]], [[Thaddeus Gibson]], Jermil Martin, Lamaar Thomas, and [[Doug Worthington]] traded team memorabilia or used equipment for tattoos or other merchandise or services between 2002 and 2010.  The report alleged that Tressel had violated NCAA bylaw 10.1 - unethical conduct, three times by not acting when told of the tattoo improprieties, by signing a statement saying he knew of no violations, and for withholding information on what was going on from university officials.&lt;ref&gt;Dohrmann, George, &quot;The Fall of Jim Tressel&quot;, ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', 6 June 2011, pp. 40-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 8, 2011, Ohio State University decided to vacate all victories from the 2010 football season as self-imposed punishment for major NCAA violations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2011/07/08/0708-ohio-state-pleads-case-to-ncaa.html&lt;/ref&gt; Former coach Jim Tressel will receive more than $52,000 from the university and won't have to pay a $250,000 fine for his involvement in the scandal. His status is also changed from 'Resigned' to &quot;Retired&quot; in keeping with his wishes to &quot;remain a Buckeye for life.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dispatch.com/live/content/sports/stories/2011/07/08/0708-ohio-state-tressel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===2011âpresent: the interregnum and return of Urban Meyer===
Ohio State named [[Luke Fickell]] as interim head coach following Tressel's resignation, and Fickell coached the Buckeyes to a 6-6 record in the 2011 regular season.  On November 28, 2011, former [[Florida Gators football|University of Florida]] head coach and [[ESPN]] college football analyst [[Urban Meyer]] accepted the position of Buckeyes head coach.&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/7289592/urban-meyer-joins-ohio-state-buckeyes-coach-1-year-hiatus-sources-say&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home venues==
* [[Recreation Park (Columbus)]] (1890â1897)
* [[Ohio Field]] (1898â1921)
* [[Ohio Stadium]] (1922âpresent)

==Traditions==
Ohio State football is rich in traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; The following are football traditions in chronological order of longevity:
*'''Senior tackle'''
Begun in 1913 by head coach [[John Wilce]], seniors on the team are recognized at the last practice of the season, either before the Michigan game or before departing Columbus to play in a [[bowl game]], and hit the [[Glossary of American football#B|blocking sled]] a final time.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;&gt;{{cite book| author=Todd Lamb, editor| title=Ohio State Football Gameday| publisher=The Ohio State Athletics Communications Office| year=2002|pages=42â43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Illibuck]]'''
The winner of the Ohio State-[[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]] game has been awarded the [[Illibuck]] trophy since 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;/&gt; Until 1927 the teams played for a live turtle, now it is a wooden turtle.
*'''Gold pants'''
A [[gold]] miniature [[Charm bracelet|charm]] depicting a pair of football pants is given to all players and coaches following a victory over the Michigan Wolverines. The tradition began as the result of a comment to reporters by newly hired head coach [[Francis Schmidt]] on March 2, 1934: &quot;How about Michigan? They put their pants on one leg at a time, the same as we do!&quot; The first gold pants, which were a creation of Simon Lazarus (president of the [[Lazarus (department store)|Lazarus]] chain of department stores) and Herbert Levy,&lt;ref&gt;Snook, &quot;Charlie Ream 1934-1937&quot;, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; were awarded that year for a 34-0 defeat of the Wolverines.&lt;ref&gt;Park, p.141&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''Captain's Breakfast'''
1934 also saw the first gathering of former team [[Captain (sports)|captains]] for breakfast on the Sunday following the [[Homecoming]] game. The event began when local businessman Walter Jeffrey invited twenty former captains to the [[Scioto Country Club]] to honor them, and continues to welcome new captains and award them [[mug]]s bearing their names and season.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Park, p.145&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Buckeye Grove'''
Begun in 1934, each player who wins &quot;first-team [[All-America]]&quot; honors is recognized by the planting of a buckeye tree and installation of a plaque in Buckeye Grove, now located near the southwestern corner of Ohio Stadium next to Morrill Tower. Trees are planted in ceremonies held prior to the Spring Game. All 126 Buckeye All-Americans dating back to 1914 have been so honored. 
*'''Michigan Week'''
Since 1935 the annual game against Michigan has been the final meeting of the regular season for both teams. The week prior to &quot;The Game&quot;, known as Michigan Week, is characterized by scheduled school spirit and public service events, such as rallies, [[Touch football (American)|touch football]] games, and [[Blood donation|blood drives]];&lt;ref name=&quot;offlscumwk&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://ohiounion.osu.edu/bmw/| title = Beat Michigan Week| format = | work =  | publisher =  The Ohio State University Union| accessdate = 26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by massive displays of school colors and banners in much of Ohio. In an unofficial culmination to Michigan Week, since 1990 on the Thursday night before &quot;The Game&quot; students have participated in the &quot;Mirror Lake jump&quot;, an unofficial gathering at Mirror Lake, a pond between Pomerene Hall and [[Ohio State University#Campus|The Oval]], in which masses of students jump into the water.&lt;ref name=&quot;mirlakjmp&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.bright.net/~beeryde/ref/osuhistory/mirrorlake2.htm| title = How the Mirror Lake Jump Came to Be| work =  | publisher =  The Lantern 17 Nov 2005| accessdate = 26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Block O]]'''[[Image:BlockO.JPG|thumb|150px|Block O in a game in the south stands]]
Since 1938 the registered student organization Block O has been the &quot;Official Cheering Section&quot; of the Buckeyes. ''&quot;Known for spreading spirit, starting cheers and performing card stunts, Block 'O' was founded...by Clancy Isaac ''.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;osufbtrad&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://ohiostatebuckeyes.cstv.com/trads/osu-m-footbl-trad.html| title = Football Traditions| work =  | publisher = TOSU Football Official Site| accessdate = 27 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; They occupy Section 39A in the South [[grandstand]] of [[Ohio Stadium]], next to the band.&lt;ref name=&quot;blocko&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://blocko.org.ohio-state.edu/| title = Block &quot;O&quot;| format = | work =  | publisher =  The Ohio State University| accessdate = 26 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tressblocko&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.coachtressel.com/tradition/block_O.asp| title = Tradition-Block O| format = | work =  | publisher =  Coach Tressel.com| accessdate = 26 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060627193207/http://www.coachtressel.com/tradition/block_O.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Victory Bell'''
The Victory Bell is rung after every Ohio State victory by members of [[Alpha Phi Omega]], a tradition that began after the Bucks beat [[California Golden Bears|California]] October 2, 1954. Reputedly the ringing can be heard five miles away &quot;on a calm day.&quot; Located 150 feet high in the southeast tower of Ohio Stadium, the bell was a gift of the classes of 1943, 1944 and 1945, and weighs 2,420 pounds.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;/&gt;
*'''[[Brutus Buckeye]]'''
Beginning in 1965, Brutus Buckeye has appeared at all Ohio State football games as the live [[mascot]] of the Buckeyes. In 2007 he was inducted into the Mascot Hall of Fame and is now one of the most recognized mascots in the United States.
*'''''Hang on Sloopy'''''
First played at the [[Illinois Fighting Illini football|Illinois]] game of October 9, 1965, the [[Rock music|rock]] song ''[[Hang on Sloopy]]'' is now played by the marching band before the start of the fourth quarter, with fans performing an O-H-I-O chant in the intervals between the [[refrain]]s. The song is also played to encourage the team's defensive players when opponents are moving the ball on offense late in a game. This is also played before the fourth quarter at [[Cleveland Browns]] and [[Cincinnati Bengals]] games, as well as during [[Cleveland Indians]], [[Cincinnati Reds]], [[Cleveland Cavaliers]], and [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] games.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;/&gt;
*'''Buckeye Leaves'''
Since 1967, the helmets of Ohio State players have been adorned with white decals approximately the size of a [[Quarter (United States coin)|quarter]] depicting a [[Aesculus glabra|buckeye leaf]], awarded for making significant plays and for consistency of performance.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;/&gt; In the 1970s, the decals were approximately the size of a [[Dollar coin (United States)|Silver Dollar]] until the 1979 Season. Most believe that this practice began in 1968 when The Buckeyes switched to their present [[Silver]] Helmet design since the decals have become identified with that helmet.
*'''Mirror Lake'''
Before the Ohio State/Michigan game at the end of the season, OSU students typically jump into [[Mirror Lake (Ohio)|Mirror Lake]], located on campus, the Thursday night before the game. The tradition is thought to bring good luck to the football team the following gameday.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.thelantern.com/media/storage/paper333/news/2005/11/17/Campus/How-The.Mirror.Lake.Jump.Came.To.Be-1108362.shtml The Lantern article on the Mirror Lake jump.]&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Tunnel of Pride'''
The Tunnel of Pride began with the 1994 Michigan game when all former players who were in attendance formed a tunnel through which the team ran to take the field, and Ohio State beat its rival that day, 22â6. [[Rex Kern]], quarterback of the [[Rose Bowl (game)|1968 National Championship]] team, and then Director of Athletics [[Andy Geiger]] together used the concept as a means of connecting current Buckeyes with those who played before them. The Tunnel of Pride was next formed for the 1995 [[Notre Dame Fighting Irish football|Notre Dame]] game, which the Buckeyes also won. In each home game against Michigan since, the tradition has been repeated.&lt;ref name=&quot;gameday&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;tunpride&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.coachtressel.com/tradition/tunnel_of_pride.asp| title = Tunnel of Pride| format = | work =  | publisher =  Coach Tressel.com| accessdate = 26 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060623001409/http://www.coachtressel.com/tradition/tunnel_of_pride.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Carmen Ohio'''''
Instituted by Coach Tressel in 2001, at the conclusion of all home games the coaches, players and cheerleaders gather in the south [[end zone]] next to the marching band to sing the university's alma mater, ''[[Carmen Ohio]]'', to the student section.&lt;ref name=&quot;carmenotrad&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | authorlink = | coauthors = | year = | url = http://www.coachtressel.com/tradition/carmen_ohio.asp| title = Tradition-Carmen Ohio| format = | work =  | publisher =  Coach Tressel.com| accessdate = 26 July 2006 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20060623001053/http://www.coachtressel.com/tradition/carmen_ohio.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 23 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Hive and pre-game circle'''
Tressel brought to the Buckeye football program two pre-game traditions he developed at Youngstown State. Prior to its warmup routine before every football game, the team exits the locker room as a unit in a controlled manner, linked arm-in-arm in a group known as &quot;The Hive&quot;. After warmups the team returns to the locker room, and when it next appears, runs onto the field and forms a circle of players around the strength coach, then they go through their warmup routine.&lt;ref name=&quot;hive&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Porentas| first = John| coauthors = | year = | url = http://the-ozone.net/football/2007/MSU/hiveandcircle.htm| title = Roots of Tressel Traditions May be Lost, but the Traditions Carry on at OSU | work = | publisher = The O-Zone | accessdate = 17 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rivalries==
{{main|Michigan â Ohio State rivalry|Illibuck|Ohio State â Penn State rivalry}}
[[Image:Michigan Stadium opening 3c27311.png|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;An early Ohio State-Michigan game in [[Michigan Stadium]]]]
While its rivalry with the University of Michigan is its most renowned and intense, Ohio State has two other series marked by their longevity, both [[Big Ten Conference]] rivals, those of [[Indiana Hoosiers football|Indiana]] and [[Illinois Fighting Illini|Illinois]]. The series versus Indiana began as a non-conference matchup, with Indiana going undefeated at 4-0-1. In conference, however, the Buckeyes (despite losing the opening conference game) are 65-8-4 through the 2006 season, the most wins against any opponent. Illinois also began with non-conference games (0-1-1) but became the longest continuous series in 2002 when the schools played in their 89th consecutive year. (That record was tied by Michigan in 2007.) Through 2009 Ohio State's record against the Illini is 62-30-4. In 2007, Ohio State was given their only defeat of the regular season by the Illini.

When Penn State was added to the conference football play in 1993, every member was given two designated rivals, teams to be played every year, with the other conference teams rotated out of the schedule at regular intervals. For geographic convenience, the Big Ten named Penn State as Ohio State's new designated rival in addition to Michigan, and Illinois was set to be paired with in-state rival [[Northwestern Wildcats football|Northwestern]] and neighboring Indiana, and in doing so undermined Ohio State's historical rivalry with Illinois.

With Nebraska's entry to the Big Ten and the establishment of division play in football, Ohio State and Illinois will again play every season in the Leaders Division beginning in 2011. Michigan is the Buckeyes' permanent cross-division rival from the Legends Division.

==Coaches==

===All-time Big Ten records===
*This chart includes both the overall record Ohio State has with the all-time Big Ten members, as well as the matchups that counted in the Big Ten standings.  The Big Ten began league play in 1896, and Ohio State joined in 1913.  Michigan rejoined the league in 1917 after leaving in 1906.  Chicago withdrew after 1939, and then Michigan State (1953), Penn State (1993), and Nebraska (2011) joined afterwards.

==Individual awards and achievements==
Through the 2006 season Ohio State players have by a significant margin won more trophies than any other NCAA Division 1A program. Ohio State players have won 34 of the listed major awards, with the next closest being 26 (Oklahoma). Ohio State is the only university to have received each of the awards at least once. Of the five awards created prior to 1980 (Heisman, Lombardi, Maxwell, Outland, and Walter Camp), Ohio State has received the most with 25 (Notre Dame follows with 23).

===Heisman Trophy winners===
Ohio State players have won the [[Heisman Trophy]] seven times, which ties Notre Dame (7) for the most awards for any school.  [[Archie Griffin]] is the only two-time recipient in the history of the award.
