'''John Misha Petkevich''' (born March 3, 1949 in [[Minneapolis]]) is an American former [[figure skating|figure skater]].  He won the 1971 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]] in men's singles and the [[North American Figure Skating Championships|North American Figure Skating Championship]] in the same year. He placed 6th at the [[1968 Winter Olympics]] and 5th at the [[1972 Winter Olympics]].  His best finish at the [[World Figure Skating Championships]] was 4th in 1972; he placed 5th in 1969, 1970, and 1971.&lt;ref name=petkevich&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/pe/john-misha-petkevich-1.html|title=John Misha Petkevich|work=Olympic Sports|publisher=Sports Reference LLC|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;    

Petkevich was coached by [[Arthur Bourke]] and [[Gustave Lussi]].  He was known as a particularly dynamic free skater for his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[USFSA]], ''The Official Book of Figure Skating'', ISBN 0-684-84673-X&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Toller Cranston]], ''When Hell Freezes Over'', ISBN 0-7710-2336-7&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=ADgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=R6sFAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=petkevich%20skating&amp;pg=3041%2C4944538 &quot;Wood Attributes Rise to Hard Work, Maturity&quot;], The Owosso Argus-Press, Feb 17 1968&lt;/ref&gt;  His emphasis on freer musical expression and less rigid body lines set him apart from most other men's singles competitors of his era.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;An Interview with Petkevich&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, May 1971&lt;/ref&gt;  He has also been credited with innovating fashion for male competitors by wearing a more athletic costume of a jumpsuit and turtleneck sweater rather than the more formal suit-and-tie outfit that was otherwise universal in the 1960s.  By the early 1970s, many other skaters had emulated Petkevich's costume style.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Nationals&quot;, ''Skating'' magazine, April 1971&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=petkevich2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://montanakids.com/cool_stories/Famous_Montanans/Petkevich.htm|title=John Misha Petkevich|work=Montana Kids|publisher=Montana Office of Tourism|accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, while a student at [[Harvard University]], Petkevich founded [[An Evening with Champions]], a long-running annual ice show that raises money to benefit the [[Jimmy Fund]] and [[Dana-Farber Cancer Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aneveningwithchampions.org/ An Evening with Champions web site&lt;/ref&gt;

Petkevich was the recipient of an unusual trophy.  At the 1947 [[World Figure Skating Championships]], [[Ulrich Salchow]] was particularly impressed by [[Dick Button]]'s skating, and gave him one of his own trophies.  Following the 1972 Olympics, Button passed on Salchow's trophy to Petkevich, who has stated that he also intends to keep up the tradition by presenting it to another young skater someday.

Following his competitive career, Petkevich attended [[University of Oxford]] as a [[Rhodes scholar]], earning a Ph.D. in cell biology.  Later he pursued a career in investment banking.

Petkevich is the author of ''Figure Skating: Championship Techniques'' (ISBN 0-452-26209-7), one of the standard reference works on figure skating technique.  He has also served as a figure skating analyst for [[NBC]], [[CBS]], and [[ESPN]].
