'''Free and open-source software''' ('''F/OSS''', '''FOSS''') or  '''free/libre/open-source software''' ('''FLOSS''') is software that is liberally [[software licence|licensed]] to grant users the right to use, study, change, and improve its design through the availability of its [[source code]]. This approach has gained both momentum and acceptance as the potential benefits have been increasingly recognized by both individuals and corporations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the context of [[Free software|free]] and [[open-source software]], ''free'' refers to the freedom to copy and re-use the software, rather than to the price of the software. The [[Free Software Foundation]], an organization that advocates the free software model, suggests that, to understand the concept, one should &quot;think of free as in free speech, not as in free beer&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

FOSS is an inclusive term that covers both [[free software]] and [[open source software]], which despite describing similar development models, have differing cultures and philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;Feller (2005), p. 89, 362&lt;/ref&gt; Free software focuses on the philosophical freedoms it gives to users, whereas open source software focuses on the perceived strengths of its peer-to-peer development model.&lt;ref&gt;Feller (2005), pp. 101â106, 110â111.&lt;/ref&gt; FOSS is a term that can be used without particular bias towards either political approach.

Software which is both [[Gratis versus libre|gratis]] and [[free software]] may be called '''gratis/libre/open-source software''' ('''GLOSS''').

[[Free software licence]]s and [[open source license]]s are used by [[List of open source software packages|many software packages]]. While the licenses themselves are in most cases the same, the two terms grew out of different philosophies and are often used to signify different distribution methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==
{{Main|History of free and open source software}}
In the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, it was normal for computer users to have the freedoms that are provided by free software. [[Software]] was commonly shared by individuals who used computers and most companies were so concerned with selling their hardware devices, they provided the software for free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|journal
|title=Free and Open Source Software
|publisher=IEEE Computer Society
}}&lt;/ref&gt;Organizations of users and suppliers were formed to facilitate the exchange of software; see, for example, [[SHARE (computing)|SHARE]] and [[DECUS]].  By the late 1960s change was inevitable: software costs were dramatically increasing, a growing software industry was competing with the hardware manufacturer's bundled software products (free in that the cost was included in the hardware cost), leased machines required software support while providing no revenue for software, and some customers able to better meet their own needs did not want the costs of &quot;free&quot; software bundled with hardware product costs.  In ''United States vs. [[IBM]]'', filed January 17, 1969, the government charged that bundled software was anticompetitive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Fisher| first = Franklin M.| coauthors = McKie, James W.; Mancke, Richard B. | title =IBM and the U.S. Data Processing Industry: An Economic History | publisher = Praeger | year =1983 | isbn =0-03-063059-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  While some software might always be free, there would be a growing amount of software that was for sale only.  In the 1970s and early 1980s, the [[software industry]] began  using technical measures (such as only distributing [[Executable|binary copies]] of [[computer programs]]) to prevent [[computer users]] from being able to study and customize software they had bought using [[reverse engineering]] techniques. In 1980 the [http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL96-517.pdf copyright law (Pub. L. No. 96-517, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028)] was extended to computer programs in the [[United States]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://history.nih.gov/research/downloads/PL96-517.pdf Computer Software 1980 Copyright Act, Pub. L. No. 96-517, 94 Stat. 3015, 3028].&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, [[Richard Stallman]], longtime member of the [[hacker (programmer subculture)|hacker]] community at the [[MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]], announced the [[GNU project]], saying that he had become frustrated with the effects of the change in culture of the computer industry and its users.&lt;ref&gt;[[#William02|William 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Software development for the [[GNU operating system]] began in January 1984, and the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) was founded in October 1985. An article outlining the project and its goals was published in March 1985 titled the [[GNU Manifesto]]. The manifesto also focused heavily on the philosophy of free software. He developed ''[[The Free Software Definition]]'' and the concept of &quot;[[copyleft]]&quot;, designed to ensure software freedom for all.

The [[Linux kernel]], started by [[Linus Torvalds]], was released as freely modifiable source code in 1991.  The licence wasn't exactly a free software licence, but with version 0.12 in February 1992, he relicensed the project under the [[GNU General Public License]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/Historic/old-versions/RELNOTES-0.12
|title=Release notes for Linux kernel 0.12
|publisher=Kernel.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much like Unix, Torvalds' kernel attracted the attention of volunteer programmers.

In 1997, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]] published [[The Cathedral and the Bazaar]], a reflective analysis of the hacker community and free software principles. The paper received significant attention in early 1998, and was one factor in motivating [[Netscape Communications Corporation]] to release their popular [[Netscape Communicator]] Internet suite as [[free software]].  This code is today better known as [[Mozilla Firefox]] and [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]].

Netscape's act prompted Raymond and others to look into how to bring free software principles and benefits to the commercial software industry.  They concluded that FSF's social activism was not appealing to companies like Netscape, and looked for a way to rebrand the free software movement to emphasize the business potential of the sharing of source code. The new name they chose was &quot;open source&quot;, and quickly [[Bruce Perens]], publisher [[Tim O'Reilly]], [[Linus Torvalds]], and others signed on to the rebranding.  The [[Open Source Initiative]] was founded in February 1998 to encourage use of the new term and evangelize open source principles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://opensource.org/history |title=History of the OSI | publisher=Opensource.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the [[Open Source Initiative]] sought to encourage the use of the new term and evangelize the principles it adhered to, corporations found themselves increasingly threatened by the concept of freely distributed software and universal access to an application's [[source code]]. A [[Microsoft]] executive publicly stated in 2001 that &quot;open source is an intellectual property destroyer. I can't imagine something that could be worse than this for the software business and the intellectual-property business.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;B. Charny, âMicrosof t Raps Open-Source Approach,â CNET News, 3 May 2001; http://news.cnet.com/2100-1001-257001.html&amp;tag=mncol%3btxt&lt;/ref&gt; This view perfectly summarizes the initial response to FOSS by the majority of big business. However, while FOSS has historically played a role outside of the mainstream of private software development, companies as large as [[Microsoft]] have begun to develop official open source presences on the Internet. Corporations ranging from IBM, Oracle, Google and State Farm are just a few of the big names with a serious public stake in today's competitive [[open source]] market signalling a shift in the corporate philosophy concerning the development of free to access software.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Voas, Keith W. Miller &amp; Tom Costello. Free and Open Source Software. ''IT Professional 12(6)'' (November 2010), pg. 14-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naming===
{{Main|Alternative terms for free software}}
====Free software====
[[The Free Software Definition]], written by [[Richard Stallman]] and published by [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), defines [[free software]] as a matter of liberty, not price.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html |title=GNU.org |work=GNU.org |date=2011-09-20 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest known publication of the definition was in the February 1986 edition&lt;ref name=&quot;bull6&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gnu.org/bulletins/bull1.txt
|title=GNU's Bulletin, Volume 1 Number 1, page 8
|publisher=GNU.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication of FSF.  The canonical source for the document is in the philosophy section of the [[GNU Project]] website.  As of April 2008, it is published there in 39 languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html#translations
|title=The Free Software Definition â Translations of this page
|publisher=GNU.org
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Open source====
The [[Open Source Definition]] is used by the [[Open Source Initiative]] to determine whether a [[computer software|software]] license can be considered [[Open source software|open source]]. The definition was based on the [[Debian Free Software Guidelines]], written and adapted primarily by [[Bruce Perens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/opensources/book/perens.html|title=''The Open Source Definition by Bruce Perens''}}, Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution, January 1999, ISBN 1-56592-582-3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opensource.org/docs/osd|title=''The Open Source Definition''}}, The Open Source Definition according to the Open Source Initiative&lt;/ref&gt; Perens did not base his writing on the four freedoms of free software from the [[Free Software Foundation]], which were only widely available later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=1129863&amp;cid=26875815 |title=Slashdot.org |work=News.slashdot.org |date=2009-02-16 |accessdate=2011-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====FOSS====
The first known use of the phrase ''free open source software'' on [[Usenet]] was in a posting on 18 March 1998, just a month after the term ''open source'' itself was coined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://groups.google.com/groups/search?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;safe=off&amp;num=10&amp;q=%22free+open+source+software%22&amp;safe=off&amp;qt_s=Search&amp;as_drrb=b&amp;as_mind=1&amp;as_minm=1&amp;as_miny=1981&amp;as_maxd=1&amp;as_maxm=6&amp;as_maxy=1998
|title=Posting re &quot;free open source software&quot;, 18 March 1998.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In February 2002, F/OSS appeared on a [[Usenet]] newsgroup dedicated to [[Amiga]] [[computer games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://groups.google.com/group/comp.sys.amiga.games/msg/4a192ea899e10c55
|title=Using m$ products is supporting them :(}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In early 2002, [[MITRE]] used the term FOSS in what would later be their 2003 report ''[[Use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS) in the U.S. Department of Defense]].''

====FLOSS====
The acronym FLOSS was coined in 2001 by [[Rishab Aiyer Ghosh]] for ''free/libre/open source software''. Later that year, the [[European Commission]] (EC) used the phrase when they funded a study on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://flossproject.org/|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software: Survey and Study}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Gratis versus Libre|libre]] software, which aimed to solve the ambiguity problem, FLOSS aimed to avoid taking sides in the debate over whether it was better to say &quot;free software&quot; or to say &quot;open source software&quot;.

Proponents of the term point out that parts of the FLOSS acronym can be translated into other languages, with for example the ''F'' representing ''free'' (English) or ''frei'' (German), and the ''L'' representing ''libre'' (Spanish or French), ''livre'' (Portuguese), or ''libero'' (Italian), ''liber'' (Romanian) and so on. However, this term is not often used in official, non-English, documents, since the words in these languages for ''free'' as in freedom do not have the ambiguity problem of ''free'' in English.

By the end of 2004, the FLOSS acronym had been used in official English documents issued by South Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naci.org.za/floss/index.html|title=Free/Libre and Open Source Software and Open Standards in South Africa: A Critical Issue for Addressing the Digital Divide|publisher=National Advisory Council on Innovation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spain,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://ec.europa.eu/idabc/en/document/1637/470|title=FLOSS deployment in Extremadura, Spain}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.softwarelivre.org/news/1727|title=RelatÃ³rio da ONU aponta o Software Livre (FLOSS) como melhor}}&lt;/ref&gt;


The terms &quot;FLOSS&quot; and &quot;FOSS&quot; have come under some criticism for being counterproductive and sounding silly.  For instance, [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]], co-founder of the Open Source Initiative, has stated:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;Near as I can figure ... people think theyâd be making an ideological commitment ... if they pick 'open source' or 'free software'.  Well, speaking as the guy who promulgated 'open source' to abolish the colossal marketing blunders that were associated with the term 'free software', I think 'free software' is ''less bad'' than 'FLOSS'. Somebody, please, shoot this pitiful acronym through the head and put it out of our misery.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=882 Please forget to FLOSS] Armed and Dangerous, March 26 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Raymond quotes programmer Rick Moen as stating
&lt;blockquote&gt;&quot;I continue to find it difficult to take seriously anyone who adopts an excruciatingly bad, haplessly obscure acronym associated with [[Dental floss|dental hygiene aids]]&quot; and &quot;neither term can be understood without first understanding both free software and open source, as prerequisite study.&quot;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Dualism of FOSS==
While the Open Source Initiative includes free software licenses as part of its broader category of approved open source licenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Licenses by Name|url=http://www.opensource.org/licenses/alphabetical|work=Open Source License|publisher=Open Source Initiative|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Free Software Foundation sees free software as distinct from open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stallman|first=Richard|title=Why Open Source misses the point of Free Software|url=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.html|publisher=Free Software Foundation|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The key differences between the two are their approach to copyright and appropriation in the context of usage.

The primary obligation of users of traditional open source licenses such as [[BSD licenses|BSD]] is limited to appropriation that clearly identifies the copyright owner of the software. Such a license is focused on providing developers who wish to redistribute the software the greatest level flexibility. Users who do not wish to redistribute the software in any form are under no obligation. Developers can modify the software and redistribute it either as source or as part of a larger, possibly proprietary, derived work, provided the original appropriation is intact. These appropriations throughout the distribution chain ensure the owners' copyrights are maintained. 

The primary obligation of users of free software licenses such as the GPL is to preserve the rights of other users under the terms of the license. Such a license is focused on ensuring that users' rights to access and modify the software cannot be denied by developers who redistribute the software. The only way to accomplish this is by restricting the rights of developers to include free software in larger, derived works unless those works share the same free software license. Free software uses copyright to enforce compliance with the software license. To strengthen its legal position, the Free Software Foundation asks developers to assign copyright to the Foundation when using the GPL license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions about the GNU Licenses|url=http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-faq.html#AssignCopyright|publisher=Free Software Foundation|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   

From a user's (non-distributor's) perspective, both free software and open source can be treated as effectively the same thing and referred to with the inclusive term FOSS. From a developer's (distributor's) perspective, free and open source software are distinct concepts with much different legal implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vetter|first=Greg|title=Commercial Free and Open Source Software: Knowledge Production, Hybrid Appropriability, and Patents|journal=Fordham Law Review|date=1|year=2009|month=1|volume=77|issue=5|pages=2087â2141|url=http://ir.lawnet.fordham.edu/flr/vol77/iss5/4|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
=== Beyond copyright ===
While copyright is the primary legal mechanism that FOSS authors use to control usage and distribution of their software, other mechanisms such as legislation, patents, and trademarks have implications as well. In response to legal issues with patents and the [[DMCA]], the Free Software Foundation released [[GNU General Public License#Version 3|version 3 of its GNU Public License]] in 2007 that explicitly addressed the DMCA and patent rights.

As author of the [[GCC]] compiler software, the FSF also exercised its copyright and changed the GCC license to GPLv3. As a user of GCC, and a heavy user of both DRM and patents, it is speculated that this change caused [[Apple, Inc.]] to switch the compiler in its [[Xcode]] IDE from GCC to the open source [[Clang]] compiler.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Brockmeier|first=Joe|title=Apple's Selective Contributions to GCC|url=http://lwn.net/Articles/405417/|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Samba (software)|Samba]] project also switched to the GPLv3 in a recent version of its free Windows-compatible network software. In this case, Apple replaced Samba with closed-source, proprietary software - a net loss for the FOSS movement as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holwerda|first=Thom|title=Apple Ditches SAMBA in Favour of Homegrown Replacement|url=http://www.osnews.com/story/24572/|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some of the most popular FOSS projects are owned by corporations that, unlike the FSF, use both patents and trademarks to enforce their rights. In August, 2010, [[Oracle]] sued [[Google]] claiming that its use of the open source [[Java (software platform)|Java]] infringed on Oracle's patents. Oracle acquired those patents with its acquisition of [[Sun Microsystems]] in January, 2010. Sun had, itself, acquired [[MySQL]] in 2008. This made Oracle the owner of the most popular proprietary database and the most popular open source database. Oracle's attempts to commercialize the open source MySQL database have raised concerns in the FOSS community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Thomson|first=Iain|title=Oracle offers commercial extensions to MySQL|url=http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/09/16/oracle_commercial_extensions_mysql/|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to uncertainty about the future of MySQL, the FOSS community used MySQL's GPL license to fork the project into a new database outside of Oracle's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Samson|first=Ted|title=Non-Oracle MySQL fork deemed ready for prime time|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/open-source-software/non-oracle-mysql-fork-deemed-ready-prime-time-853|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This new database, however, will never be MySQL because Oracle owns the trademark for that term.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nelson|first=Russell|title=Open Source, MySQL, and trademarks|url=http://www.opensource.org/node/496|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future economics of FOSS ===
According to [http://benkler.org/Bio.html Yochai Benkler], [http://www.law.harvard.edu/faculty/directory/index.html?id=419 Jack N. and Lillian R. Berkman Professor for Entrepreneurial Legal Studies] at [http://www.law.harvard.edu/index.html Harvard Law School], free software is the most visible part of a new economy of commons-based peer production of information, knowledge, and culture. As examples, he cites a variety of FOSS projects, including both free software and open source.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Benkler|first=Yochai|title=Freedom in the Commons: Towards a Political Economy of Information|journal=Duke Law Journal|year=2003|month=April|volume=52|issue=6|url=http://www.law.duke.edu/shell/cite.pl?52+Duke+L.+J.+1245+pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This new economy is already under development. In order to commercialize FOSS, many companies, Google being the most successful, are moving towards an economic model of advertising-supported software. In such a model, the only way to increase revenue is to make the advertising more valuable. [[Facebook]] has recently come under fire for using novel user tracking methods to accomplish this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/facebook-tracking-prompts-calls-for-ftc-investigation/2011/09/29/gIQAVdsP8K_story.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=23 October 2011|author=Dina ElBoghdady|coauthors=Hayley Tsukayama|title= Facebook tracking prompts calls for FTC investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

This new economy is not without alternatives. Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Stores]] have proven very popular with both users and developers. The Free Software Foundation considers Apple's App Stores to be incompatible with its GPL and complained that Apple was infringing on the GPL with its [[iTunes]] terms of use. Rather than change those terms to comply with the GPL, Apple removed the GPL-licensed products from its App Stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Vaughan-Nichols|first=Steven|title=No GPL Apps for Apple's App Store|url=http://www.zdnet.com/blog/open-source/no-gpl-apps-for-apples-app-store/8046|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The authors of [[VLC media player|VLC]], one of the GPL-licensed programs at the center of those complaints, recently began the process to switch from the GPL to the LGPL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Changing the VLC engine license to LGPL|url=http://www.videolan.org/press/lgpl.html|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adoption by governments==

The Government of [[Kerala]], India, announced its official support for Free/Open Source Software in its State IT Policy of 2001, which was formulated after the first-ever Free Software Conference in India, &quot;Freedom First!&quot;, held in July 2001 in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Role of Open or Free Software&quot;, Section 15, page 20, of the State IT Policy (2001) of the Government of Kerala, copy available at the UN Public Administration Network (UNPAN) site; http://unpan1.un.org/intradoc/groups/public/documents/apcity/unpan002950.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

In 2004, a law in [[Venezuela]] (Decree 3390) went into effect, mandating a two year transition to open source in all public agencies.
