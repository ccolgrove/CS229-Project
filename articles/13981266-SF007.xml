'''The Angry Video Game Nerd''' (abbreviated '''AVGN''' or '''The Nerd''' and formerly, '''The Angry Nintendo Nerd'''), is the main character and title of a series of [[farce|farcical]] [[retrogaming]] video reviews created by and starring '''James Rolfe''' (born July 10, 1980).&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- These two videos show his middle initial --&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/angry-video-screwattack/23316|title=AVGN: Bugs Bunny Birthday Blowout|author=James Rolfe|publisher=GameTrailers|accessdate=December 1, 2007|date=August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video | people = James Rolfe | title = CineMassacre 200  | url = http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiQE_Lb801U | medium = YouTube | publisher = CineMassacre |date = 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The show generally revolves around retro game reviews that involve bitter rants against games he deems to be of particularly low-quality or poor design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.allmediany.com/details_news_article.php?news_artid=749 |title=Top 20 Angry Video Game Nerd Freak Outs |first=David |last=Guzman |date=3 March 2011 |work=AllMediaNY.com |accessdate=10 March 2011 |quote=Ever since James Rolfe â the filmmaker who brought the Nerd to life â started posting tirades about awfully ancient video games on YouTube in 2006, the following heâs gotten there has become pretty big.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such games are often associated with [[Tie-in|movie tie-ins]]. 

The series began as a feature on [[YouTube]], and later joined [[ScrewAttack|ScrewAttack Entertainment]], which would later have three of its features, including the AVGN, transferred to [[GameTrailers]] exclusively. The show, formerly known as The Angry Nintendo Nerd, was renamed because the show started reviewing games on other consoles, and also to prevent any trademark issues with [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdfaq&quot;&gt;{{cite web | publisher = The CineMassacre Productions | url = http://www.cinemassacre.com/faq/ | title = Cinemassacre FAQ | year = 2010 |accessdate = June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nerd is a short-tempered and foul-mouthed video [[Gamer|game fanatic]]. He derives comic appeal from excessive and inventive use of [[profanity]], frequent displays of [[Finger (gesture)|explicit gestures]], and a habitual consumption of beer (mostly [[Rolling Rock]], but sometimes [[Yuengling]]).  A particular characteristic, which has become something of a trademark of his character, is for him to describe, in great detail, extremely repulsive and painful, usually firmly [[toilet humour|scatological]] acts, and to claim that he would rather endure them than to play the game that he is reviewing. Varying amounts of [[physical comedy]] are mixed into the verbal abuses.

==History==
===Viral Videos===
Rolfe first started to do films as a child in the late 80s to the early 90s, but his career did not take off until he made a short review of the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'' in 2004 under the title &quot;Bad NES Games&quot;. Rolfe decided to make another video which was supposed to be the last, because ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (video game)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' was his most hated game. At the time he was drinking the beer [[Rolling Rock]], which went on to become a signature trait of The Nerd. The videos were produced and published on Cinemassacre.com.&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdfaq&quot; /&gt; On April 6, 2006, he joined YouTube and the videos were put on YouTube under the name of &quot;JamesNintendoNerd&quot;, before his character was developed.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AVGN MTV 2006.PNG|thumb|left|&quot;The Nerd&quot; was covered on [[MTV]]'s 2006 news special on viral videos]] --&gt;
On September 12, 2006 Rolfe's character first gained mainstream attention when his review of the Nintendo game ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1989 video game)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]'' went viral on the YouTube website. This was reported in an [[MTV]] news segment called &quot;Viral Videos Infect the Mainstream&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/videos/news/125775/viral-videos-infect-the-mainstream.jhtml|title=Viral Videos Infect the Maintream|author=MTV|publisher=MTV|accessdate=March 22, 2011|date=September 12, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, on November 2, 2008 his videos were featured on the nationally syndicated radio show [[Opie and Anthony]]. Opie &amp; Anthony found his obscenity-laced tirades against poorly made video games quite humorous, and took notice of one of their own Whip 'em Out Wednesdays (WOW) promotional stickers being featured quite prominently in several of Rolfe's videos. Since then, additional videos have been played occasionally on the show. Rolfe was later interviewed by Opie and Anthony on January 9, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AUVe9RAg3Js|title=Angry Video Game Nerd Opie and Anthony Interview Pt 1|author=Opie and Anthony|publisher=Opie and Anthony Radio Show|accessdate=November 2, 2008|date=November 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfe would go on to host a show on Opie and Anthony's [[XM Satellite Radio]] (now Sirius/XM) channel for their &quot;Saturday Night Virus&quot; block of shows, but has done only one show so far and has not returned since.

Rolfe continues to make non-AVGN related videos on his website ''Cinemassacre''.

===Angry Video Game Nerd===
He later changed the name from &quot;The Angry Nintendo Nerd&quot; to &quot;The Angry ''Video Game'' Nerd&quot; to prevent [[trademark]] issues.&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdfaq&quot; /&gt; Along with the name change, the Nerd soon diversified, reviewing games on other platforms such as the [[Atari 2600]], [[Colecovision]], [[Intellivision]], [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super Nintendo]], [[Sega Master System]], [[Sega Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]], [[Sega CD]], [[Sega 32x]],[[3DO| 3DO Interactive Multiplayer]], [[GameBoy]], [[Virtual Boy]], [[Atari 5200]], [[CD-I]], [[Nintendo 64]], [[TurboGrafx-16]], [[Sega Saturn]] and [[PlayStation]]. Along with reviewing games, some episodes have featured other video game-related items, such as the [[Power Glove]], the [[U-Force]] and other NES accessories, movie reviews of ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III]]'' and ''[[The Wizard (film)|The Wizard]]'', and a tribute to ''[[Nintendo Power]]''. He also references video game culture in a reenactment of the retro console wars in one video in a [[Wii]] tribute.

Rolfe has stated on his website that the first videos he made were &quot;just a joke&quot; and he had no intention of making them public,&lt;ref name=&quot;nerdfaq&quot; /&gt; instead showing them only to friends. After two years passed, Mike Matei suggested he put the reviews online. They soon did, and since then, his reviews have become increasingly popular and have developed a large [[fandom|fanbase]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weprin |first=Alex |date=2 June 2008 |title=Spike TV Revamps Web Presence |journal=[[Broadcasting &amp; Cable]] |volume=138 |issue=14â25 |page=28 |publisher=Cahners Publishing |accessdate=10 March 2011 |url=http://books.google.com/books?id=ficQAQAAMAAJ |quote=The new Spike.com features a high-resolution full-episode video with the ability to embed episodes of Spike programming on outside sites, social-networking features and exclusive original content from YouTube stars such as &quot;The Angry Video Game Nerd&quot; and established entertainment brands such as Playboy Enterprises and Ultimate Fighting Championship.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/static/ceb/2007/11/12/life/do.you.play..html|title=Do you play?|author=Carlo Carrasco|publisher=Sun.Star Publishing, Inc.|accessdate=December 4, 2007}}{{dead link|date=February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rolfe's videos grew longer, soon turning into an actual series complete with title cards, an intro song and official merchandise and the AVGN Volume 1 DVD (2004 and 2006 episodes), followed by the Volume 2 DVD (2007 episodes), the Volume 3 DVD (2008 episodes), and the Volume 4 DVD (2009 episodes).
After his fourth online review on YouTube, [[ScrewAttack]] invited him to have his own section on their website and has since been employed by [[MTV Networks]]' [[GameTrailers|GameTrailers.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/resume.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070716201747/http://www.cinemassacre.com/resume.html|archivedate=2007-07-16|title=James Rolfe resume|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|accessdate=August 14, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, new videos are GameTrailers exclusives released once a month with Rolfe posting episodes on his YouTube account over a year after its original GameTrailers release.

On March 17, 2010, Rolfe said he was suffering from [[Burnout (psychology)|burnout]] as a result of consistently writing, directing, and starring in the videos, and that the show would be entering a brief hiatus. It was scheduled to return in May 2010; however, an episode was released on April 30. Episodes are now scheduled to be released the first or second Wednesday of each month,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/2010/04/30/avgn-episode-90-action-52/|title=AVGN: Episode 90 â &quot;Action 52â³|date=April 30, 2010|accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to two episodes per month due to other work.

===Episodes===
{{Main|List of The Angry Video Game Nerd episodes}}

===Special guests===
Occasionally, &quot;special guests&quot; based on famous film and television characters make appearances. These guests often provide additional commentary on the games and mock the Nerd's anguish. Most of the characters are played by Mike Matei, who also illustrates the show's title cards. His roles have included characters such as [[Freddy Krueger]] and [[Bugs Bunny]], among many others. Freddy Krueger was also played by James Rolfe, with Matei taking on the role when both the Nerd and Freddy were in view.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44LOjtXzxyE|title=AVGN: Nightmare on Elm St commentary|author=James Rolfe|publisher=GameTrailers|accessdate=December 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show's musician, Kyle Justin, played both [[Spider-Man]] and [[Cousin Itt]] in separate episodes, which were accompanied by him performing the theme songs from Spider-Man and ''[[The Addams Family]]'', with reworked lyrics. Justin was also featured in the Battletoads and second Bugs Bunny (Crazy Castle) episodes as himself. Kevin Finn played the Ninja in his [[Ninja Gaiden]] review as well as the &quot;Game Graphic Glitch Gremlin&quot; in the Game Glitches episode and Zelda II: The Adventure of Link episode. 

Some episodes have a basic storyline inspired by the plot of the game or the movie the game is based on being reviewed (e.g. in the ''Halloween'' review, the Nerd is stalked by [[Michael Myers (Halloween)|Michael Myers]] while he goes babysitting). In these cases, guests are used to play the episode-specific characters.  [[The Nostalgia Critic]] appeared in the Nerd's house and together they had a violent duel, in which the critic is nearly killed by the &quot;Super Mecha Death Christ&quot; character. More specifically &quot;Super Mecha Death Christ 2000 B.C Version 4.0 Beta!... bitch&quot;.

In The Nerd's take on ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', Stuttering Craig and Handsome Tom, co-founders of [[ScrewAttack]], appear as the [[Ghost of Christmas Past]] and the [[Ghost of Christmas Present]], respectively. A [[Dracula (Castlevania)|Dracula]] [[Sprite (computer graphics)|sprite]] from ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest]]'' represents the [[Ghost of Christmas Future]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/angry-video-screwattack/29069|title=AVGN: A Christmas Carol Pt. 1|author=James Rolfe|publisher=GameTrailers|accessdate=December 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametrailers.com/video/angry-video-screwattack/29192|title=AVGN: A Christmas Carol Pt. 2|author=James Rolfe|publisher=GameTrailers|accessdate=December 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
The Angry Video Game Nerd theme song was composed by independent musician Kyle Justin, who has ceased activity since 2009 for unknown reasons. The lyrics were the work of both Justin and Rolfe.&lt;ref name=&quot;kylejustin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kylejustinmusic.com/AngryVideoGameNerd.htm|title=Kyle Justin's AVGN Music Page|author=Kyle Justin|accessdate=2009-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the lyrics come from comments made by Rolfe in his review of ''Back to the Future''.

For numerous episodes, musical scores and covers were performed by Chris Holland that were subsequently used in episodes which includes the Batman, the Nerdy Christmas, and many others. The episodes of Board James ''Tornado Rex'' and ''Donut Disaster'' have music by Bootsy Spankins, P.I., also known as Kevin Finn.

===Animated characters===
The show also makes use of original animated characters to add commentary or advance an episode-specific plot. The review of [[Master Chu and the Drunkard Hu]] uses a character called &quot;Shit Pickle&quot; to comment on the game play (which simply consisted of him repeating the words &quot;shit&quot; and &quot;pickle&quot; sometimes, but not always together). Shit Pickle did not appear again until Rolfe placed him in his own animated shorts. In the [[The Wizard (film)|Wizard]]/[[Super Mario Bros. 3]] review, the Nerd calls upon the &quot;Super Mecha Death Christ 2000 B.C Version 4.0 Beta... bitch&quot; to assist in the destruction of a demonically possessed [[Super Mario Bros. 3]] cartridge. This character is a combination of [[Jesus]], robotic components, assorted weapons, and a tank. Both Shit Pickle and Super Mecha Death Christ originated from Rolfe's early animated film &quot;[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]] 3: [[Return To Oz|Dorothy Goes to Hell]]&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;wizardofoz3&quot;&gt;[http://cinemassacre.com/2006/06/11/wizard-of-oz-3-dorothy-goes-to-hell-2006/ &quot;The Wizard of Oz 3: Dorothy Goes to Hell&quot; at Cinemassacre]{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are voiced by James Rolfe and created by Mike Matei. Rolfe explained on his website that Super Mecha Death Christ was created as a spoof on the numerous Mecha-characters found in the [[Godzilla (franchise)|Godzilla movies]], such as [[Mechagodzilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/new/?p=379 |title=Godzillathon #20 - Godzilla Vs. MegaGodzilla (1993) |author=James Rolfe |accessdate=2008-10-25 |publisher=CineMassacre.com |date=2008-10-13}}{{dead link|date=January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his review of the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] a character called &quot;The Nerdy Turd&quot;, a piece of fecal matter with Rolfe's head and face on it, was introduced out of necessity as the Odyssey does not support single player games. In the [[Star Wars]] games review, the Nerd introduces the &quot;Beer Droid&quot;, a beer supplying Droid.

===DVDs===
On November 18, 2007, the first AVGN [[DVD]] set was released. It includes all of the episodes up to the first ''Bible Games'' episode. Some material, such as movie clips from ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and ''[[Rocky]]'', were removed to avoid copyright infringement and replaced with new material. The DVD includes extended versions of the &quot;Wally Bear and the NO Gang!&quot; and &quot;Rocky&quot; reviews as well as an original documentary, deleted scenes, and most of the videos posted exclusively on [[ScrewAttack|ScrewAttack.com]]. In all, the DVD set contains approximately three hours and 15 minutes of content.  According to Rolfe, the initial pressing of the DVD sold out in less than a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KWJv1vvtPao|title=AVGN DVD SOLD OUT!|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|accessdate=November 25, 2007|date=November 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, there were 100 DVDs sold with James Rolfe's autograph on the front cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revver.com/video/734577/avgn-dvd-autograph/|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080612043451/http://revver.com/video/734577/avgn-dvd-autograph/|archivedate=2008-06-12 |title=AVGN DVD Autograph |author=James Rolfe |publisher=Cinemassacre, ScrewAttack |accessdate=March 16, 2008|date=March 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Around November 15, 2008, the second AVGN DVD set, which spans three discs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2008/08/08/updates-from-me/|title=Updates from me|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|accessdate=May 5, 2011|date=August 8, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released.

On December 12, 2009, &lt;!-- Date of release of Indiana Jones review on YouTube --&gt; the third AVGN DVD set, which spans three discs, was released. It includes the GameTrailers.com episodes from ''Chronologically Confused about the [[The Legend of Zelda|Zelda Timeline]]'' to ''Bible Games 2''; however, the review for ''[[The Wizard (film)|The Wizard]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' has been reduced to cover only SMB3 to avoid copyright infringement. Three of the episodes have been extended. The DVD set also includes outtakes, a tour of the Nerd's room, and other material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/2009/12/10/avgn-dvd-vol-3/|title=AVGN DVD Vol. 3|publisher=Cinemassacre|date=Dec. 12, 2009 &lt;!-- Article re-retrieved.

On December 15, 2010, the fourth AVGN DVD set, spanning three discs, was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cinemassacre.com/2010/11/02/coming-soon-avgn-dvd-vol-4/|title=AVGN DVD Vol. 4|publisher=Cinemassacre|accessdate=Nov. 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes the GameTrailers.com episodes from ''Michael Jackson's Moonwalker'' to ''Winter Games'' as well as bonus features such as a look at [[Sega Master System#SegaScope 3-D Glasses|Sega 3-D Glasses]], outtakes, behind-the-scenes footage, and other material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dV-GOxWb6ys|title=AVGN DVD VOLUME 4 IS HERE!|author=James Rolfe|publisher=YouTube|date=December 15, 2010|accessdate=December 15, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rolfe Confirmed AVGN Vol 5 via a video release on his website Cinemassacre.com
He stated &quot;Vol 5 Should be out before Christmas 2011&quot;

==Film adaptation==
On September 23, 2010, Rolfe released a video on his website detailing his plans for ''The Angry Video Game Nerd: The Movie'' to be released in the near future. Rolfe's long-time friend Kevin Finn helped him finish the script and it is said to be in the vein of ''[[Wayne's World (film)|Wayne's World]]'' in the sense that it will be a movie about a person that reviews games, rather than a feature length review or multiple reviews adding up to a feature length.&lt;ref name=&quot;film&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cinemassacre.com/2010/09/23/future-plans-avgn-the-movie/|title=Future Plans â AVGN: The Movie|author=James Rolfe|publisher=Cinemassacre|date=September 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review of [[Steven Spielberg]] movie games, it hinted that he would be reviewing the infamous [[Atari]] [[E.T.
