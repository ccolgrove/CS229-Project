'''Khaled Mohamed Saeed''' ({{lang-ar|Ø®Ø§ÙØ¯ ÙØ­ÙØ¯ Ø³Ø¹ÙØ¯}} {{IPA-arz|ËxÃ¦Ëled mÃ¦ËÄ§Ã¦mmÃ¦d sÃ¦ËÊiËd|IPA}}; January 27, 1982 â June 6, 2010) was a young Egyptian man who died under disputed circumstances in the [[Sidi Gaber]] area of [[Alexandria]] on June 6, 2010, after being arrested by Egyptian police. Photos of his disfigured corpse spread throughout online communities and incited outrage over allegations that he was beaten to death by Egyptian security forces. A prominent [[Facebook]] group, &quot;We are all Khaled Said&quot;, moderated by [[Wael Ghonim]], brought attention to his death and contributed to growing discontent in the weeks leading up to the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/middle-east/anger-on-the-streets-of-cairo|title=Anger on the streets of Cairo|publisher=[[The National (Abu Dhabi)]]|date=2010-06-13|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e41c5faa-3475-11e0-9ebc-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1DfvBdbyf|title=Google worker is Egyptâs Facebook hero|date=February 9, 2011|work=[[Financial Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, two Egyptian police officers were found guilty of manslaughter and sentenced to seven years in prison for beating Saeed to death.&lt;ref name=bbc_convict /&gt;

==Personal life==
Saeed was raised by his mother and the rest of his extended family after the death of his father when he was young. Showing an interest in computers, he stayed for some time and studied [[computer programming]] in the United States. He also loved music and had been composing a musical piece before his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A with Ali Qassem, uncle of slain youth Khaled Saeed (part one) |author=Lina Attalah |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/53167 |newspaper=Almasry Alyoum |date=June 30, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
On June 6, 2010, Saeed had been sitting on the second floor of a [[cybercafe]]. Two detectives from the [[Sidi Gaber]] police station entered the premises and arrested him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Two witnesses affirm Alex victim beaten by police |author= |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/50228 |newspaper=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=June 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multiple witnesses testified that Saeed was beaten to death by the police, who reportedly hit him and smashed him against objects as he was led outside to their police car.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/51909|title=Anger in Alexandria: 'Weâre afraid of our own government' |publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|date=2010-06-25|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The owner of the internet cafe in which Saeed was arrested stated that he witnessed Saeed being beaten to death in the doorway of the building across the street after the detectives took him out of the cafe at the owner's request.&lt;ref name=&quot;San Diego&quot;/&gt;

But they took him as he struggled with his hands behind his back and banged his head against the marble table inside here,' Mosbah said in an interview conducted by a journalist from the liberal opposition al-Ghad newspaper. Mosbah said he told the police to take it outside and they hauled Said into the doorway of a nearby building. He did not emerge alive, said the cafe owner.

During an interview with the opposition party, [[El-Ghad Party|El-Ghad]]'s, newspaper, Mosbah described, &quot;They dragged him to the adjacent building and banged his head against an iron door, the steps of the staircase and walls of the building...Two doctors happened to be there and tried in vain to revive him but (the police) continued beating him...They continued to beat him even when he was dead&quot;. This description given by the owner was confirmed by the [[Egyptian Organization for Human Rights]].&lt;ref name=&quot;San Diego&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Egypt cafe owner describes police beating death |author=Paul Schemm |url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/2010/jun/13/egypt-cafe-owner-describes-police-beating-death/ |newspaper=[[The San Diego Union-Tribune]] |date=June 13, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The police reported that Saeed suffocated in an attempt to swallow a packet of [[hashish]], a claim supported by two autopsy reports made by Forensic Authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/52970|title=Journalists protest state media coverage of Alexandria police killing|publisher=[[Almasry Alyoum]]|date=2010-06-230|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police further stated that Saeed was &quot;wanted for theft and weapons possession and that he resisted arrest.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;CNN&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Demonstrators in Egypt rail against brutality, man's death |author=Ben Wedeman |url=http://articles.cnn.com/2010-06-25/world/egypt.police.beating_1_brutality-mohamed-elbaradei-egyptian?_s=PM:WORLD |newspaper=[[CNN]] |date=June 25, 2010 |accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Former chief medical examiner of Egypt, Ayman Fouda, was interviewed about the proper procedure that should have been followed for Saeed's autopsy. He stated that the &quot;mechanics of the injuries&quot; that Saeed had sustained should have been investigated and his brain should have also been tested to see whether he had had a concussion, as the medical examiner that had conducted the autopsy had done neither.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Interview: Former chief medical examiner on Khaled Saeed autopsy |author=Dareen Farghaly |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/53003 |newspaper=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=June 30, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two police officers were later jailed for four days pending questioning on beatings that they allegedly carried out on Saeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gulfnews.com/news/region/egypt/egyptian-protesters-see-policemen-s-jailing-in-activist-s-death-as-a-victory-1.649353|title=Egyptian protesters see policemen's jailing in activist's death as a victory|publisher=[[Gulf News]]|date=2010-07-02|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed's family members stated that Saeed was &quot;tortured to death for possessing video material that implicates members of the police in a drug deal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police killing sparks Egypt protest |author= |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/06/201061415530298271.html |newspaper=Al Jazeera English |date=June 14, 2010 |accessdate=January 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-mortem photographs go viral==
[[File:Khalid-Saeed.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Post mortem]] imagery of Khaled Saeed's corpse in the morgue went viral, becoming &quot;The Face That Launched a Revolution&quot; according to media.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;]]

When Saaed's family visited his body in the morgue, his brother snapped pictures of the corpse using his mobile phone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.almasryalyoum.com/node/55686 | title = Al-Masry Al-Youm Exclusive: Khaled Saeed Case Investigation | date = 12/07/2010 | author = Ahmed Shalaby

==''We are all Khaled Said''==

Among those who saw the photo, was Google marketing executive [[Wael Ghonim]]. Ghonim was located in [[Dubai]] at the time of the incident and decided to create a [[Facebook]] memorial page for Saeed, called &quot;We are all Khaled Said&quot;. The page attracted hundreds of thousands of followers, becoming Egypt's biggest dissident Facebook page.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTFB&quot;&gt;{{Cite news |title=Facebook and YouTube Fuel the Egyptian Protests |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/06/world/middleeast/06face.html |date=February 5, 2011 |last=Preston |first=Jennifer |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;NATO&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nato.int/docu/review/2011/Social_Medias/Egypt_Facebook/EN/index.htm | title = Egypt and Facebook: Time to Update Its Status | work = Nato Review | publisher = [[NATO]] | year = 2011 | accessdate = 19 March 2011 | last = Heaven | first = Will}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for Saeed rapidly spread,&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt;&lt;ref name=NATO/&gt; with many Facebook members using his photograph for their own profiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/undercover-police-arrested-over-beating-death-of-egyptian-man | title = Undercover Police Arrested Over Beating Death of Egyptian Man | author = Nadia abou el Magd | date = 2 July 2010 | accessdate = 19 March 2011 | work = [[The National (Abu Dhabi)|The National]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Because of the photo and the heavy amount of international criticism that arose from the incident, the Egyptian government consented to a trial for the two detectives involved in his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=We are all Khaled Saeed: Redefining political demonstration in Egypt |author=Noha El-Hennawy |url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/61266 |newspaper=[[Almasry Alyoum]] |date=August 4, 2010 |accessdate=January 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alexandria protests==
On June 25, 2010, [[Mohamed ElBaradei]], former head of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]], led a rally in Alexandria against alleged abuses by the police and visited Saeed's family to offer condolences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/06/201062642955204618.html|title=ElBaradei leads anti-torture rally|publisher=[[Al Jazeera English]]|date=2010-06-26|accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nadia Abou el Magd, [http://www.thenational.ae/news/worldwide/africa/egypts-elbaradei-leads-thousands-in-protest-against-police?pageCount=0 &quot;Egypt's ElBaradei leads thousands in protest against police&quot;], ''The National'', Jun 26, 2010.

==Impact on the 2011 Egyptian revolution==

{{see also|2011 Egyptian protests}}
One of the earliest pre-revolution articles to link the death of Saeed to an imminent nationwide explosion came from Saeed's neighbor, Egyptian-Australian Amro Ali. In an opinion piece titled &quot;Egypt's Collision Course with History&quot;, Ali writes an intimate portrayal of Saeed and the Alexandria context, as well as the ramifications of his death for the regime. Ali states &quot;Saeedâs tragedy is Egyptâs tragedy. A young man, neither a political activist nor religious radical, but an ordinary Egyptian whose accused actions could not in any way warrant his lynching. Saeed was someoneâs son, someoneâs brother, someoneâs friend, someoneâs neighbour, someoneâs customer, and if not for what had happened, someoneâs future. Saeed was, in the local vernacular, a son of Cleopatra [Saeed's suburb]. Yet the system that was supposed to protect him and give him his rights, took away those rights by taking away his life...It is one extra nail in the coffin of the ever-widening gulf between the ruler and ruled...What the Egyptian establishment maybe forgetting...is that pigeons come home to roost more than once&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Amro|title=Egypt's Collision Course With History|url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=10663&amp;page=0|publisher=Online Opinion|date=2010-07-09|accessdate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

While the actual impact of Ghonim's site cannot be determined,&lt;ref name=NATO/&gt; it was Ghonim who first published a call to protest on January 25, to the followers of his blog, and protesters carried banners and posters displaying the photograph of Saaed's corpse.&lt;ref name=&quot;ABC&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/egypt-face-launched-revolution/story?id=12841488&amp;page=1 | last = Ross | first = Brian | coauthors = Matthew Cole | title= Egypt: The Face That Launched A Revolution | work = [[ABC News]] | year = 2011 | accessdate = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has been named one of the catalysts of the [[2011 Egyptian protests]], as an instance in which people formed a community around opposition to police brutality and, by extension, other government abuses.&lt;ref name=&quot;NYTFB&quot;/&gt; On February 11, 2011, these protests resulted in the resignation of [[Hosni Mubarak]] after 30 years in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-02-11/mubarak-leaves-presidency-hands-power-to-egypt-s-military-suleiman-says.html|title=Mubarak Resigns as Egyptian President|publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|date=2011-02-11|accessdate=2011-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[ABC News]] characterized Saaed in his morgue photo as &quot;The Face That Launched a Revolution&quot;.&lt;ref name=ABC/&gt; The ''Washington Post'' wrote that &quot;Had it not been for a leaked morgue photo of his mangled corpse, tenacious relatives and the power of Facebook, the death of Khaled Said would have become a footnote in the annals of Egyptian police brutality. Instead, outrage over the beating death of the 28-year-old man in this coastal city last summer, and attempts by local authorities to cover it up, helped spark the mass protests demanding the ouster of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/08/AR2011020806360.html | title= Egyptian Man's Death Became Symbol of Callous State | first = Ernesto | last = Londono | date = 9 February 2011 | accessdate = 19 March 2011 | work = [[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation and trial of the police officers==
The investigation into Saeed's death yielded 300 papers, analysis and testimony which informed the decision to charge both police officers, Mahmoud Salah Mahmoud and Awad Ismael Suleiman, in criminal court with use of violence and unjustified detention of the victim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/55686 |title=exclusive: Khaled Saeed case investigation &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date= |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were detained in July 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/53178 |title=2 Alex policemen detained in Khaled Saeed case &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=2010-06-30 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the trial began in July but was postponed and did not resume until February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/302734 |title=Alexandriaâs Khaled Saeed police brutality trial postponed &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=2011-01-22 |accessdate=2011-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alexandria Criminal Court will announce the verdict on September 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2011/0630/Khaled-Said-verdict-and-Egyptian-justice-delayed-again |title=Khaled Said verdict â and Egyptian justice â delayed again |publisher=''[[Christian Science Monitor]]'' |date=2011-06-30 |accessdate=2011-07-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 24 September 2011 Alexandria's criminal court adjourned the trial until 22 October 2011. Judge Moussa al-Nahrawy decided to postpone the case to allow both the plaintiffâs and the defendantsâ lawyers to review the report of a third forensic committee, whose formation the court had ordered in June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/498838 |title=Al-Masry Al-Youm 24 September 2011: Khaled Saeedâs trial adjourned to 22 October |publisher=Almasryalyoum.com |date=2011-09-24 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/498898 |title=Al-Masry Al-Youm 24 September 2011: Khaled Saeed murder trial adjourned for study of latest forensics report |publisher=Almasryalyoum.com |date=2011-09-24 |accessdate=2011-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 October 2011, both plaintiffs were found guilty of manslaughter and were sentenced to seven years.&lt;ref name=bbc_convict&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/15467022|title=Egypt jails police over activist Khaled Said's death|work=BBC News|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/508951|title=Two policemen convicted in Khaled Saeed murder case|work=al-Masry al-Youm|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human rights activists, such as the [[Egyptian Organization for Human Rights]], objected to the short sentences. The two officers were convicted of using excessive force which killed Saeed but were not convicted of the more serious charge of &quot;torture with the purpose of killing&quot; which is a capital crime. Organizations such as the [[April 6 Youth Movement]] and the [[25 Revolution Youth Union]] also criticized the verdict for its leniency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/509283|work=al-Masry al-Youm|title=Rights group demands heavier sentence in Khaled Saeed case|date=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
