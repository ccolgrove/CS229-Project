{{TOCright}}

'''Major general''' or '''major-general''' is a [[military rank]] used in many countries. It is derived from the older rank of [[sergeant major general]]. A major general is a high-ranking officer, normally subordinate to the rank of [[lieutenant general]] and senior to the ranks of [[brigadier]] and [[brigadier general]]. Where relevant, major general has a NATO code of [[OF-7]], and is considered to be a [[two-star rank]].&lt;ref&gt;In countries that do not maintain the rank of brigadier general, including much of [[Eastern Europe]] and the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], major general is the lowest of the [[General officer|general-officer]] ranks. Note, however, if the rank of brigadier is used, although brigadiers are not classed as &quot;generals&quot;, they are of equal rank to brigadier generals, and are still considered to be a [[one-star rank]]. If neither of the ranks of brigadier or brigadier general (or an equivalent rank) are used, the major general is still considered a two-star rank (independent of how many stars there actually are in the insignia), and that armed force simply has no one-star rank.&lt;/ref&gt; A major general in most armies commands a [[Division (military)|division]].

{{Main|Major General (Australia)}}

==Austria==
In the old [[Austro-Hungarian Army]], the major general was called a ''[[Generalmajor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Bowden &amp; Tarbox, p 24. The authors write that FML (Field-Marshal-Lieutenant) is the same as Lieutenant-General and ''General-Feldwachtmeister'' the same as Major-General. But they list no equivalent rank to Brigadier-General. Nevertheless, the page cited is an excellent source of Austro-Hungarian ranks.&lt;/ref&gt; Today's [[Military of Austria|Austrian Federal Army]] still uses the same term.

==Canada==
{{see also|Canadian Forces ranks and insignia}}

In the [[Canadian Forces]], the rank of '''Major-General''' (MGen) (''Major-gÃ©nÃ©ral'' or ''MgÃ©n'' in [[French language|French]]) is an [[Canadian Army|Army]] or [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Air Force]] rank equal to a [[Rear-Admiral]] of the [[Canadian Forces Maritime Command|Navy]]. A Major-General is a [[General Officer]], the equivalent of a Naval [[Flag Officer]]. A Major-General is senior to a [[Brigadier-General]] or [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]], and junior to a [[Lieutenant-General (Canada)|Lieutenant-General]] or [[Vice-Admiral]]. Prior to 1968, the [[Royal Canadian Air Force|Air Force]] used the rank of [[Air Vice-Marshal]] instead.

The rank insignia for a Major-General is two gold maple leaves beneath crossed sword and baton, all surmounted by St. Edward's Crown. It is worn on the shoulder straps of the Service Dress tunic, and on slip-ons on other uniforms. The Service Dress tunic also features a wide strip of gold braid around the cuff. On the visor of the service cap are two rows of gold oak leaves.

Major-Generals are initially addressed as &quot;General&quot; and name, as are all general officers; thereafter by subordinates as &quot;Sir&quot; or &quot;Ma'am&quot; as applicable in English or &quot;mon gÃ©nÃ©ral&quot; in French. Major-Generals are normally entitled to [[staff car]]s.

==Estonia==
In the [[Military of Estonia|Estonian military]], the major general [[Estonian Army ranks|rank]] is called '''''Kindralmajor'''''.

==Finland==
The [[Military of Finland|Finnish military]] equivalent is '''''Kenraalimajuri''''' in Finnish, or '''''Generalmajor''''' in Swedish.

==France==
In the French military, '''''Major gÃ©nÃ©ral''''' is not a rank but an appointment conferred on some generals, usually of ''[[GÃ©nÃ©ral de corps|GÃ©nÃ©ral de corps d'armÃ©e]]'' rank, acting as head of staff of a branch of service. This should not be confused with the [[chief of staff (military)|chief of staff]], who is usually a ''[[Army General (France)|GÃ©nÃ©ral d'armÃ©e]]'', and the true commander of each service. The position of ''major gÃ©nÃ©ral'' can be considered the equivalent of a deputy chief of Staff. There are five Major Generals: the Major General of the Armies, head of the General Staff, the Major General of the [[ArmÃ©e de Terre|Army]], the Major General of the [[Marine nationale|Navy]], the Major General of the [[National Gendarmerie (France)|''Gendarmerie'']] and the Major General of the [[ArmÃ©e de l'Air|Air Force]].

Historically, the French army had some ''[[sergeant Major General|sergent-majors gÃ©nÃ©raux]]'', also called ''sergents de bataille'', whose task was to prepare the disposition of the army on the field before a battle. These ''sergents-majors gÃ©nÃ©raux'' became a new rank, the ''[[marÃ©chal de camp]]'' (not the same as a Field Marshal, in the French Army from antiquity called a ''MarÃ©chal de'' France), which was the equivalent of the rank of major general. However, the term of ''major gÃ©nÃ©ral'' was not forgotten and used to describe the appointment of armies chiefs of staff. One well-known French ''Major gÃ©nÃ©ral'' was Marshal [[Louis Alexandre Berthier]], Major General of [[NapolÃ©on Bonaparte|NapolÃ©on]]'s ''Grande armÃ©e'.

The French equivalent to the rank of Major General is ''[[GÃ©nÃ©ral de division]]''.

==Germany==
The [[German Army]] and ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' refer to the rank as '''''Generalmajor'''''. Prior to 1955,, the rank of ''Generalleutnant'' was used to define a division commander, whereas ''Genralmajor'' was a brigade commander. With the remilitarization of Germany in 1955 with West Germany's admission to NATO, Germany adopted the rank structure of the U.S. with the authority of the three lower ranks being moved up one level and the rank of ''Brigadegeneral'' (Brigadier General) added below them. The rank of ''Generaloberst'' was no longer used. The change was likely made to avoid confusion over relative rank in NATO forces. The ''[[Nationale Volksarmee]]'' of East Germany continued the use ''Generalmajor'' (Brigadier General) as the lowest general officer rank until reunification.

==Iran==
In the Imperial Iranian Army and Air Force, the rankings of the above Colonel are respectively ''Sar-teep'' (Brigadier General), ''Sar-Lashgar'' (Major General), ''Sepah-Boad'' (Lieutenant General), and ''Artesh-Boad'' (General)

==Ireland==
In the [[Irish Defence Forces]], there are two Major Generals. They are Deputy Chiefs of Staff with separate responsibility for Operations (DCOS Ops) and Support (DCOS Sp).

==India==
'''Major General''' in the [[Indian Army]] is equivalent to [[Rear Admiral]] in the [[Indian Navy]] and [[Air Vice Marshal]] in the [[Indian Air Force]] and is the lowest of the general officer ranks, ranking higher than a [[Brigadier]] and lower than a [[Lieutenant General]].

==Israel==
In the [[Israel Defence Forces]], a Major General is called an '''''[[Aluf]]''''' and is the second highest rank, only outranked by ''[[Rav Aluf]]'' ([[Lieutenant General]] or [[General]]), who is also the Chief of Staff.

==Italy==
In Italy, there exists the [[Italian Army|Army]] rank of '''''Generale di Divisione'''''. In the army the ''Generale di Divisione'' is the commander of a [[Division (military)|division]] or as other duties in the various national or international staff, in the ''[[Carabinieri]]'' or ''[[Guardia di Finanza]]''. He/she is usually the commander of the units in a zone of the country.

==Korea==
In [[South Korea]], the [[Comparative military ranks of Korea|rank]] of Major General is known as '''''Sojang''''' ([[Hangul]]: ìì¥, [[Hanja]]: å°å°).

The rank of ''Sojang'' is also used in [[North Korea]], where it is the lowest general officer and flag officer rank, equivalent to a one-star General and Admiral. The North Korean equivalent to a two-star General is '''''Jungjang''''', which roughly translates as Lieutenant General.

==New Zealand==
In the [[New Zealand Army]], '''Major-General''' is the rank held by the Chief of Army (formerly the Chief of General Staff). The more senior rank of [[Lieutenant-General]] is reserved for when an Army officer holds the position of Chief of Defence Force, who commands all New Zealand's armed forces. This position is subject to rotation between the heads of the Air Force, Army, and Navy.

==Norway==
In the [[Norwegian Army]], the [[Royal Norwegian Air Force]] and the [[Norwegian Home Guard]], '''Generalmajor''' is the lowest general officer, equivalent to ''Kontreadmiral'' ([[Counter Admiral]])  in the [[Royal Norwegian Navy]].

==Pakistan==
'''Major General''' in the [[Pakistan Army]] is equivalent to [[Rear Admiral]] in the [[Pakistan Navy]] and [[Air Vice Marshal]] in the [[Pakistan Air Force]] and is the lowest of the general officer ranks, ranking between [[Brigadier]] and [[Lieutenant General]]. The Pakistan Army has two female Major Generals. The longest server is [[Shahida Malik]].

==Portugal==
The rank of '''Major-General''' was reintroduced in the [[Portuguese Army]], [[Portuguese Air Force|Air Force]] and [[Portuguese National Republican Guard|National Republican Guard]] in 1999 in place of the former rank of [[brigadier]]. It was previously used in the Army, from 1862-1864. It is equivalent to ''Contra-Almirante'' ([[Rear-Admiral]]) in the [[Portuguese Navy]].

==Sweden==
In Sweden, the rank of '''Generalmajor''' ('''''Genmj''''') is used in the [[Swedish Army|Army]], the [[Swedish Amphibious Corps|Amphibious Corps]] and the [[Swedish Air Force|Air Force]]. It is the equivalent to ''Konteramiral'' ([[Counter Admiral]]) in the navy. It is typically held by the [[Inspector General]]s of the three [[Swedish Armed Forces|service branches]] and the head of the [[Swedish Military Intelligence and Security Service]].

==Turkey==
The Turkish Army and Turkish Air Force refer to the rank as '''''TÃ¼mgeneral'''''. The Turkish Navy equivalent is '''''TÃ¼mamiral'''''. The name is derived from ''tÃ¼men'', the Turkish word for a military division (''tÃ¼men'' itself is an older Turkish word meaning &quot;10,000&quot;). Thus, linguistically, it is similar to the French equivalent for a Major General, ''GÃ©nÃ©ral de division''.

==United Kingdom==
{{Main|Major-General (United Kingdom)}}

In the [[British Army]] and [[Royal Marines]], '''Major-General''' ranks below Lieutenant-General and above [[Brigadier]], and is thus the lowest of the general officer ranks, although always considered equivalent to Major-General in other countries. [[Division (military)|Divisions]] are usually commanded by Major-Generals and they also hold a variety of staff positions. The professional head of the Royal Marines currently holds the rank of Major-General.

From 1 April 1918-31 July 1919, the [[Royal Air Force]] maintained the rank of Major-General. It was superseded by the rank of Air Vice-Marshal on the following day.

Major-General is equivalent to [[Rear Admiral]] in the Royal Navy and [[Air Vice-Marshal]] in the [[Royal Air Force]].

==United States==
{{main|Major general (United States)}}
In the [[United States Army]], a major general commands a division of 10,000-20,000 soldiers and is capable of fully independent field operation.

==Vietnam==
In Vietnam, the rank of Major General is known as '''Thiáº¿u tÆ°á»ng'''. It is used in the Army and the Air Force. It is the equivalent to '''Chuáº©n ÄÃ´ Äá»c''' ([[Rear Admiral]]) in the Navy.

The rank of ''Thiáº¿u tÆ°á»ng'' is the lowest general officer and flag officer rank, equivalent to a one-star General and Admiral. In the [[Vietnamese People's Army]], a major general commands a corps of 30,000-40,000 soldiers and is capable of fully independent field operation.
