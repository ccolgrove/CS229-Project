Since 1984 [[Cranfield University]] has been the main academic provider of the College. A November 2005 contract extends the Cranfield relationship with DA-CMT to at least 2027.

The College is based, like the majority of Defence Academy institutions, at MoD ([[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]]) Shrivenham, located between the villages of [[Shrivenham]] and [[Watchfield]] in the south-west corner of [[Oxfordshire]] ([[Vale of White Horse]]), and has training centres around the country. DA-CMT facilities at Shrivenham are run by [[Serco Group|Serco Defence, Science and Nuclear]].

The departments are: Acquisition and Business Learning, Leadership and Management Division, Technology Division, Nuclear Department and the Defence Technical Officer and Engineer Entry Scheme.
