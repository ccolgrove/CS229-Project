'''Elizabeth Gurley Flynn''' (August 7, 1890 &amp;ndash; September 5, 1964) was a labor leader, activist, and [[feminist]] who played a leading role in the [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW). Flynn was a founding member of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] and a visible proponent of [[women's rights]], [[birth control]], and [[women's suffrage]]. She joined the [[Communist Party USA|American Communist Party]] in 1936 and late in life, in 1961, became its chairwoman. She died during a visit to the [[Soviet Union]], where she was accorded a state funeral.

==Early years==

Gurley was born in [[Concord, New Hampshire]] in 1890. The family moved to [[New York]] in 1900, and Flynn was educated at the local public schools. Her parents introduced her to [[socialism]].  When she was only 16 she gave her first speech, &quot;What Socialism Will Do for Women&quot;, at the [[Harlem]] Socialist Club. As a result of her political activities, Flynn was expelled from high school.

==Activist career==
In 1907, Flynn became a full-time organizer for the [[Industrial Workers of the World]], and attended her first IWW convention in September of that year.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Frederick Brissenden, ''The I.W.W. A Study of American Syndicalism'', Columbia University, 1919, pages 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;  Over the next few years she organized campaigns among garment workers in [[Pennsylvania]], silk weavers in [[New Jersey]], restaurant workers in [[New York]], miners in [[Minnesota]], [[Missoula, Montana]], and [[Spokane, Washington]]; and textile workers in [[Massachusetts]]. During this period, author [[Theodore Dreiser]] described her as &quot;an East Side Joan of Arc&quot;.

In 1909, Flynn participated in a free speech fight in Spokane, in which she [[Free speech fights#History of the IWW.27s free speech fights|chained herself to a lamp-post]] in order to delay her arrest. She later accused the police of using the jail as a brothel, an accusation that prompted them to try to confiscate all copies of the [[Industrial Worker]] reporting the charge.

Flynn was arrested 10 times during this period, but was never convicted of any criminal activity. It was a plea bargain, on the other hand, that resulted in Flynn's expulsion from the IWW in 1916, along with fellow organizer [[Joseph Ettor|Joe Ettor]]. According to historian  Robert M Eleff, &lt;ref&gt; Robert M Eleff , The 1916 Minnesota Miner`s Strike Against US Steel, Minnesota History Magazine, Summer 1988 &lt;/ref&gt;, three Minnesota miners had been arrested on murder charges arising from an incident which arose when a group of deputised mine guards, including an alleged gunman by the name of James C Myron and a former bouncer named Nick Dillon, came to the residence of one of the miners, Philip Masonovitch, to investigate allegations of  the use of an illegal liqour still on the premises. A confrontation ensued in which Myron and a bystander were shot dead. According to Eleff, some witness testimony seemed to indicate that Myron could have been killed accidentally by one of his colleagues, who fired into the Masonovitch residence from outside,  and that the bystander was killed by Dillon.   Three IWW organizers were also charged, although all three were elsewhere at the time. Head of the IWW's organizing committee, [[Bill Haywood]] seemed confident that [[Orrin N. Hilton|Judge Hilton]], who had successfully defended George Pettibone when he and Haywood were on trial in Idaho, could win the case for the miners.

It didn't happen that way &amp;mdash; the main organizers on the scene accepted an arrangement by which the other organizers were allowed to go free, but the three miners, none of whom spoke English fluently, faced time in prison. There was also a mixup in the sentencing; a prior agreement for one year in prison was somehow changed in the courtroom to a sentence of five to 20 years. Haywood held Flynn and Ettor responsible for allowing the miners to plead guilty to charges they probably didn't understand.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haywood, The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, pp. 291 ppbk.&lt;/ref&gt; Haywood wrote in his autobiography that Flynn and Ettor's &quot;part in the affair terminated their connection with the IWW.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Bill Haywood, ''The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood'', 1929, pp. 292 ppbk.&lt;/ref&gt; Haywood's biographer, Peter Carlson, wrote that Ettor left the IWW, and that Flynn &quot;remained in the union, but took pains to avoid Haywood and his supporters.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Carlson, ''Roughneck, The Life And Times of Big Bill Haywood'', 1983, page 237.&lt;/ref&gt;

A founding member of the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) in 1920, Flynn was active in the campaign against the conviction of [[Sacco and Vanzetti]]. Flynn was particularly concerned with [[women's rights]], supporting [[birth control]] and [[women's suffrage]]. Flynn also criticized the leadership of trade unions for being male-dominated and not reflecting the needs of women.

Between 1926 and 1936, Flynn lived in southwest [[Portland, Oregon]] with birth control activist and [[Wobbly]] [[Marie Equi|Dr. Marie Equi]].  Though Flynn was in poor health most of her time in Portland, she was an active and vocal supporter of the [[1934 West Coast Longshore Strike]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ooliganpress.pdx.edu/red.html The Portland Red Guide], 2007, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1936, Flynn joined the U.S. Communist Party and wrote a feminist column for its journal, the [[Daily Worker]]. Two years later, she was elected to the national committee. Her membership in the Party led to her ouster from the board of the ACLU in 1940.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harvardsquarelibrary.org/unitarians/baldwin.html &quot;Roger Baldwin: Founder, American Civil Liberties Union&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[World War II|Second World War]] she played an important role in the campaign for equal economic opportunity and pay for women and the establishment of day care centres for working mothers. In [[New York state election, 1942|1942]], Flynn ran for [[New York's At-large congressional district|Congress at-large]] in New York and received 50,000 votes.

In July 1948, 12 leaders of the Communist Party were arrested and accused of violating the [[Smith Act]] by advocating the overthrow of the U.S. government by force and violence. They appealed to the Supreme Court, which upheld their conviction in [[Dennis v. United States]]; two justices wrote in dissent that they were convicted in violation of their Constitutional rights for engaging in activities protected by the First Amendment.

Flynn launched a campaign for their release, but in June 1951, was herself arrested in the second wave of arrests and prosecuted under the Smith Act.

After a nine-month trial, she was found guilty and served two years in [[Federal Prison Camp, Alderson]] near [[Alderson, West Virginia]]. She later wrote an [[prison memoir|account of her prison experiences]] in ''The Alderson Story: My Life as a Political Prisoner''.

==Later years and legacy==
After her release from prison, Flynn resumed her activities for leftist and Communist causes. She became national chairperson of the Communist Party of the United States in 1961. She made several visits to the [[Soviet Union]] and died while there on September 5, 1964, 74 years old. The Soviet government gave her a state funeral in [[Red Square]] with over 25,000 people attending. In accordance with her wishes, Flynn's remains were flown to the United States for burial in Chicago's [[German Waldheim Cemetery|Waldheim Cemetery]], near the graves of [[Eugene Dennis]], [[Bill Haywood]] and the [[Haymarket Riot]] Martyrs.

Flynn's influence as an activist was far-reaching, and her exploits were commemorated in a popular ballad. The song &quot;Rebel Girl&quot; was written by [[Joe Hill]] in honor of Elizabeth Gurley Flynn.

A fictionalized version of Flynn is depicted in [[John Updike]]'s novel ''[[In the Beauty of the Lilies]]'' in which she is said to have had an affair with the anarchist [[Carlo Tresca]], which is supported by Flynn's letters and memoir.

==Quotes==
'''Quotes:'''&lt;br /&gt;
&quot;History has a long-range perspective. It ultimately passes stern judgment on tyrants and vindicates those who fought, suffered, were imprisoned, and died for human freedom, against political oppression and economic slavery.&quot;

&quot;We believe that the class struggle existing in society is expressed in the economic power of the master on the one side and the growing economic power of the workers on the other side meeting in open battle now and again, but meeting in continual daily conflict over which shall have the larger share of labor's product and the ultimate ownership of the means of life.&quot;
