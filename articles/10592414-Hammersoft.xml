A number of recurring characters appear in the [[video game]] ''[[Grand Theft Auto IV]]'', set in 2008. The characters that appear in ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' are relatively diverse and relative to the respective boroughs of [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]] they are based in, belonging to various gangs and ethnic groups. The player controls Niko Bellic, an immigrant from [[Southeast Europe|Southeastern Europe]].&lt;ref name=&quot;egmmarch&quot;&gt;{{cite journal

Unlike previous games in the series, the voice actors of ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' do not include notable and high-profile celebrities, instead opting for lesser known actors such as Michael Hollick, Jason Zumwalt, Anthony Patellis, Moti Margolin, Ryan Johnston, Thomas Lyons, [[Frank Bonsangue]], [[Timothy Adams (actor)|Timothy Adams]] and [[Coolie Ranx]]. However, several high-profile DJs host the various radio stations within the game such as [[Iggy Pop]], [[Karl Lagerfeld]], [[Juliette Lewis]], [[Daddy Yankee]], and real life DJs like [[DJ Premier]], [[DJ Green Lantern]], [[Lazlow]], and real life comedians [[Katt Williams]] and [[Ricky Gervais]] can be seen at the Comedy Club and also be heard being interviewed on the in-game radio station [[Grand Theft Auto IV soundtrack#WKTT â We Know The Truth|WKTT]].

For the first time in the series, ''Grand Theft Auto IV'' features &quot;morality choices&quot; in several points of the game, in which the player is forced to choose between killing or sparing a character,  or killing one of two characters.  In some of these situations the player can choose to carry out execution-style killings, which are played out as cut scenes.  The game also has two possible endings, which is determined by a decision the player makes with the main antagonist towards the conclusion of the storyline: Revenge or Deal. Each choice affects the missions the player can partake and the fate of some characters.

For the purposes of this list, missions specific to a particular ending in which a character is killed in are labeled ''&quot;(Revenge)&quot;'' and ''&quot;(Deal)&quot;'' respectively.

==Protagonist==
'''Niko Bellic ''' (born June 25 1978) is the main [[protagonist]] and playable character of [[Grand Theft Auto: IV]]. It is implied in a side mission that Niko is possibly from the Balkans, when asked by [[serial killer]] Eddie Low if he hails from the Balkans, Niko replies with &quot;Hey, you're a smart guy&quot;. Niko grew up during the harsh times of the [[Yugoslav wars]], in which he participated as an angry youth. Niko witnessed many atrocities and [[war crimes]], including a number of children lined up against a church wall, each with their throats slit and hands cut off. A defining moment in the war, for Niko, was when his army unit of fifteen young men from his village were ambushed by the enemy. Niko barely escaped and most of his friends were killed. He later discovers that two other members of the unit also survived, and concludes that one of those two sold the unit out for money. Niko vows to track down the culprit, motivated not solely by revenge, but a [[need for closure]] and to move on with his own life.

Personality-wise, Niko is a very down-to-business person, and is very protective when it comes to his family and loved ones, especially Roman. The most significant aspect of Niko's personality is his cynicism, which he gained in the war. He criticizes his acquaintances for expecting him to have fun amidst his troubled situation. Niko's biggest weakness is his inability to let go of the past - which causes him much aggression when the issue of finding his betrayers comes up; Niko is criticized by many of his friends and most notably Roman, for this weakness. His first girlfriend was Michelle, whom he later leaves after she turns out to be an undercover detective, and his second, Kate McReary either way dies at the end (if the player chooses '''Revenge''') or feels disappointed in Niko for violating his principles, but forgives and consoles him in his time of loss (in '''Deal''').

Niko was voiced by [[Michael Hollick]].&lt;ref name=DailyTelegraph&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/jack-black-announces-new-game-trailers-at-video-game-awards/story-e6frewyr-1111118329201 |title=Jack Black announces new game trailers at video game awards |accessdate=2011-07-13 |author= |date=2008-12-16 |work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Central Characters==
===Roman Bellic===

''Introduced in: &quot;The Cousins Bellic&quot;''

''Can be killed in: &quot;Mr. and Mrs Bellic&quot; (Deal storyline)''

'''Roman Bellic''' ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: '''Ð Ð¾Ð¼Ð°Ð½ ÐÐµÐ»Ð¸Ñ''', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: '''Roman BeliÄ''') (1977â2008, conditional) is [[Niko Bellic|Niko's]] cousin who has lived in [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)|Liberty City]] for 10 years. Roman and Niko's fathers were brothers, and like Niko's father, Roman's father was also an abusive alcoholic. According to Niko, Roman's mother was raped and murdered during the war, although Roman believes she died in a house fire; to this day, Niko could not find it in his heart to tell Roman of his mother's true fate. Roman claims to be living the [[American Dream]] to his relatives and that he has two women, four hot tubs and fifteen sports cars. He successfully manages to persuade his cousin Niko to move to the city by using this deception. When Niko arrives, however, he realises that in reality Roman lives in a small, dirty apartment, owns a gritty, private-hire taxi firm in [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)#Broker|Broker]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Char1&quot;&gt;{{cite news |title=Grand Theft Auto IV |pages=64 |work=Ur magazine |publisher=Rogers |accessdate=2008-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;, has a [[problem gambling|gambling problem]] and owes money to many criminals, such as the [[Mafia]]. Despite Niko's frustration with Roman's lies, Roman is optimistic and claims to be in the process of achieving the &quot;American Dream&quot;. Niko admits that Roman has indeed found some success in America because of Mallorie, Roman's longtime girlfriend whom he later weds.

During the course of the game, his apartment and business are burned down by Dimitri Rascalov and the Liberty City Bratva. He later sets up another taxi company in [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)#Bohan|Bohan]] with the insurance money and moves in with Mallorie, but is kidnapped again after a losing streak at a gambling den that is in actuality an unsuccessful trap by Dimitri to lure Niko and have him killed. Roman, after managing to finally win big, ultimately buys a [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] in [[Liberty City (Grand Theft Auto)#Algonquin|Algonquin]] and upgrades his taxi company, having achieved the &quot;American Dream&quot;. During the game's finale, Roman attempts to persuade Niko into striking a drugs deal with Dimitri Rascalov due to the amount of money involved. If Niko chooses the &quot;Revenge&quot; storyline, Roman is disappointed that Niko does not do the deal but prepares for his imminent wedding. After the ceremony, a furious Jimmy Pegorino shows up and guns down Kate McReary outside the church. Angered that Kate was killed at his wedding, Roman and Little Jacob helps Niko to take down Pegorino. In the &quot;Deal&quot; storyline, Roman is inadvertently killed at his wedding by an assassin sent by Dimitri, in an attempt on Niko's life. In both endings, it is revealed that Mallorie is pregnant with Roman's child.

Roman Bellic is voiced by [[Jason Zumwalt]].

'''Dimitri Rascalov''' (1969â2008, [[Russian language|Russian]]: ÐÐ¼Ð¸ÑÑÐ¸Ð¹ Ð Ð°ÑÐºÐ°Ð»oÐ²) is a [[Russia]]n criminal and serves as the main [[antagonist]] of the game.

Dimitri is initially shown as Mikhail Faustin's right-hand man; they are old friends from their army and prison years. Dimitri is the more sensible of the two, although Mikhail claims that Dimitri has an addiction to [[barbiturates]]. He and Niko quickly make friends when Dimitri becomes increasingly annoyed with Mikhail's unpredictably violent leadership, which has given their organization more enemies and caused the law to monitor them more closely. He later betrays Mikhail and orders Niko to assassinate him in order to prevent a gang war with Kenny Petrovic - before he is executed, Mikhail warns that America has made Dimitri greedy and that he will betray Niko as well. Niko later meets with Dimitri at a warehouse to collect his reward for the killing, where Dimitri does indeed betray him and reveals his new partner, Ray Bulgarin, Niko's former boss in the human trafficking ring, who orders his men to kill Niko. Little Jacob comes to Niko's rescue and mentions that Dimitri has escaped and they can deal with him another time. Dimitri and Bulgarin set fire to Roman's apartment and taxi depot, effectively running Niko and Roman out of Broker. The cousins escape to Bohan to avoid any further trouble, after receiving death threats from Dimitri via the phone. Dimitri attempts to kill Niko twice more, once by kidnapping Roman to lure Niko to a warehouse filled with his men, and another time by sending Bulgarin and his men to sabotage a hostage exchange between the McReary crime family and the Ancelotti crime family at which Niko is present. Dimitri calls Niko after both attempts, furious that he was not killed and threatening future attempts on his life. Upon learning that Niko is helping Bernie Crane and Bryce Dawkins, whose relationship he is trying to expose, Dimitri calls Niko and suggests that they re-establish their friendship and work together to expose them. Niko coldly reminds Dimitri of his betrayal.

Towards the conclusion of the main storyline, the Pegorino Crime Family - whom Niko works for - enters an alliance with another organization to find a buyer for a large amount of [[heroin]] that they stole earlier in the game, which would finally put the Pegorino crime family on the map. Dimitri's Bratva is the other organization, putting Niko in an awkward position - the player has to make a choice of either picking up the money from the buyers Dimitri found or dealing revenge and killing him. If the player chooses to strike a &quot;Deal&quot;, Niko and Phil Bell are assigned to pick up the money at one location while Dimitri sells the heroin at another location. Dimitri appears happy with Niko's decision but, deciding to keep the heroin, he then betrays and kills the buyers at his end, forcing Niko and Phil to kill the buyers at their location in order to obtain the money. They are successful and Niko gains $250,000 from the deal. However, Dimitri is aware that Niko has not forgotten his earlier betrayal and, still fearing his retaliation, he sends a hitman to Roman's Wedding to eliminate him, but Roman is inadvertently killed during a struggle. Niko tracks Dimitri and Pegorino down at an abandoned casino in Alderney and Dimitri executes Pegorino before escaping. Niko pursues Dimitri to Happiness Island, before ensuing in a final confrontation in which he guns Dimitri down, before the Statue of Happiness, leaving him to die from his injuries as he explains his treacherous nature and that he killed Roman. If the player chooses to strike &quot;Revenge&quot; Niko kills Dimitri in the cargo hold of the Platypus ship.

Dimitri Rascalov is voiced by [[Moti Margolin]].

===Mallorie Bardas-Bellic===

''Introduced in: &quot;It's Your Call&quot;''

'''Mallorie Bardas-Bellic''' (born 1979), is the Puerto Rican girlfriend, later wife, of Roman Bellic. Mallorie is Roman's girlfriend for the first part of the storyline (although she secretly sees Vlad Glebov before Niko kills him) before becoming his fiancÃ©e. One of her cousins owns an apartment in Bohan which Niko and Roman seek refuge in after Roman's apartment and taxi depot are set on fire and destroyed. Towards the conclusion of the storyline, Mallorie and Roman wed, however in the &quot;Deal&quot; storyline ending her new husband is gunned down outside the church and she becomes widowed. In both storylines, it is revealed that she is pregnant. Prior to the ending of the &quot;Revenge&quot; storyline, Roman contacts Niko both revealing Mallorie's pregnancy and that he has chosen to name his possible daughter Kate, in honour of Kate McReary.

Mallorie's maiden name is wrongly credited as &quot;Ramos&quot; in the European [[Xbox 360]] instruction manual, but is correctly credited &quot;Bardas&quot; in the [[PlayStation 3]] instruction manual and manuals in other regions.

Mallorie Bardas is voiced by Elena Harvey Hurst.

===Jimmy Pegorino===
''Introduced in: &quot;Pegorino's Pride&quot;''

''Killed in: &quot;A Revenger's Tragedy&quot; (Deal) / &quot;Out of Commission&quot; (Revenge)

[[Crime Boss|Don]] '''James &quot;Jimmy&quot; Pegorino''' (1957â2008) is the co-main secondary antagonist of the game, and  mobster heavily involved in drugs distribution, head of the Alderney based [[List of Gangs in Grand Theft Auto#Pegorino Family|Pegorino crime family]]. The Pegorinos also have a hangout in Little Italy, the ''Drusilla's Ristorante''. Jimmy Pegorino's aims to see his family become part of the Liberty City [[La Cosa Nostra#Commission|La Cosa Nostra &quot;Commission&quot;]]. The main five families of Liberty City (The Ancelotti, Pavano, Messina, Lupisella and Gambetti Crime Syndicates) think that the Pegorinos are nothing more than a &quot;joke&quot;. As the Ancelotti's are the weakest members of the Commission, he uses his hired muscle, the McReary Irish Mob, to attack their hired muscle and hinder them. Mrs. Pegorino is seen several times in the story, always complaining about the way Pegorino's crime syndicate is run. If the player chose the &quot;Deal&quot; storyline, on the final mission, A Revenger's Tragedy, Dimitri tells him &quot;I didn't work this hard to share the spoils of a victory&quot; before shooting him dead.

Jacob is also the one who tracks down Pegorino and/or Dimitri for the final mission. Once Jacob learns to trust Niko, he offers to sell weapons at a fraction of their street value.

A recurring gag throughout the game is that Jacob always smokes [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] at inopportune moments, at one point while accompanying Niko in a helicopter chase, much to Niko's dismay. Another recurring joke is his heavy [[Rastafarian]] accent, which Niko initially struggles to understand. Little Jacob can also be seen in Team Mafia Work, who needs to be taken to a contact. Kenny PetroviÄ describes him as ''Small Jacob''.

Little Jacob is voiced by [[Coolie Ranx]].

====Bruce &quot;Brucie&quot; Kibbutz====

He sports a [[Chinese character tattoos|tattoo of the Chinese character æ]], meaning &quot;Me&quot; or &quot;I&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNCharactersGTA4&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=IGN: The Characters of Grand Theft Auto IV | publisher=[[IGN]] | url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/841/841715p1.html | accessdate=2007-12-15 | date=2007-12-14 | last=Roper | first=Chris | coauthors=[[Rockstar Games]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a necklace that reads &quot;No. One&quot;.  On his left forearm is a tattoo &quot;äººå¦&quot; meaning &quot;shemale&quot;; he also has a tattoo on his stomach which says &quot;Mommy&quot;. His personality is rumored to be modeled after the popular internet personality, [[Pure Pwnage|FPS Doug]] and [[Scott Alexander]], (however there are no facts backing up these rumors) an English business man and socialite who Kibbutz physically resembles and also, amongst other things, has a workout regime, executive lifestyle car business and even his &quot;No One&quot; chain (Alexander refers to himself as No. 1 (number one) and has a tattoo of this on his right arm and also used it as his motto and in his business interests) that all reference and relate to Alexander. Brucie owns a garage in BOABO, Broker called &quot;Brucie's Executive Auto Garage&quot;, and often appears in in-game radio advertisements promoting his business. He can be found in the police database as wanted for possession of steroids. Niko suspects that Brucie's macho behavior is due to hidden low self-esteem and Brucie mentions that he was bullied for being overweight as a child. When Niko later learns that the assassinations he carried out for Brucie was due to Brucie's [[roid rage]], Niko ends their business relationship, but they continue as friends and Niko continues to steal cars and participate in races for him. Once Niko and Brucie become good friends Niko can call Brucie and be taken across Liberty City in Brucie's helicopter. In the &quot;Deal&quot; alternate ending Brucie sends Niko an email offering him his support after Roman's death.

In ''The Ballad of Gay Tony'', Brucie's insecurities are expanded upon. He has an elder brother named Mori, who is involved in the businesses of Gay Tony, and moves in with his brother. Mori is much more intelligent than Brucie, and achieved his physical fitness without the use of steroids. He constantly taunts Brucie, calling him weak and stupid. Brucie is at one point seen on the verge of tears after this abuse, specifically when Mori defeats him in a game of chess. In a tense conversation between him and Luis Lopez at '''Maisonette 9''', it is also strongly implied Brucie is a closeted [[homosexual]] or [[bisexual]] due to his extreme insecurity when people imply he's &quot;gay&quot; and when he attempts to kiss Luis. Brucie finally puts an end to his brothers insults (with some help from Luis Lopez) by breaking Mori's nose.

Brucie Kibbutz is voiced by [[Timothy Adams (actor)|Timothy Adams]].

====Dwayne Forge====
''Introduced in: &quot;Deconstruction for Beginners&quot;''

''Can be killed in: &quot;The Holland Play&quot;''

'''Dwayne Forge''' (1973â2008, conditional) is the former mentor of Playboy X. He is an old school [[African-American]] gangster who used to be a very influential and feared criminal. However, Dwayne confesses at one point that he wanted to be a police officer as a youth, but the LCPD did not encourage African American police officers to join in the '70s and '80s. He also had trouble reading and writing due to a learning disability. Dwayne's father was an abusive, small-time criminal that was killed by drug dealers that he tried to rip-off, but Dwayne felt no emotion when he learned of his death. Dwayne soon learned that a lot of money was to be had in the drug trade and that he was very good at intimidating people. He also found that, despite his difficulties reading, he was very good at the basic mathematics required for his trade. Although Dwayne himself disliked the drugs he was dealing, he soon became the leader of his own drug ring called the [[List of Gangs in Grand Theft Auto#North Holland Hustlers|North Holland Hustlers]]. At the height of his power, Dwayne claims he rented out entire apartments just to have someplace to store all the money that his gang was accumulating.

In 1999, Dwayne was arrested and convicted on charges of crack distribution. He is released from prison during the events of the game, but is disturbed by the world of [[bling]] and excess he's found in an underworld that was all about straight business when he left it almost a decade ago. He is depressed that his menacing and powerful reputation has been forgotten, even finding out that his girlfriend Cherise left him for a known snitch named Jayvon Simson, even after Dwayne pulled strings from behind bars to pay her rent over the years. Feeling betrayed, Dwayne is also angry that Playboy X ignores him and excludes him from the gang's business, which is resorting to more high-profile crimes. Niko is paid by Playboy to work for Dwayne, and he ends up sympathizing with Dwayne's plight and helps him rebuild his reputation and influence. After Dwayne pays Niko to shut down a club that he used to own that was taken over by associates of Playboy X, Dwayne and Playboy X call Niko to kill one another, giving him a choice of whom to kill. If the player kills Playboy X, Dwayne receives a deed and gives Niko the penthouse of his old protÃ©gÃ© and he becomes Niko's friend.  A reward for being Dwayne's friend is the ability to call some of his underlings to assist in shooting missions. If the player kills Dwayne, Playboy X pays Niko $25,000 but lashes out at him for killing his &quot;father figure&quot;, calling him &quot;nothing but a cold-blooded killer&quot; and refuses to speak to him again. When hanging out with Dwayne, he complains about his hard knock life and comes off as very depressed - when drunk, he admits that he bottles up his emotions to maintain his tough persona. Niko eventually sternly tells Dwayne to stop lamenting about his past. Dwayne lives at the Governor Greg Johnson Projects at Vespucci Circus in [[Harlem|North Holland]] (which he would prefer to live in than Playboy X's penthouse, as it would only remind him of Playboy).

Dwayne Forge is voiced by [[Devin Richards]].

==Main supporting characters==
===Allies===
====Kate McReary====
''Introduced in: &quot;Harboring a Grudge&quot;''

''Can be killed in: &quot;Mr. and Mrs. Bellic&quot; (Revenge)

'''Kate McReary''' (1980â2008, conditional), a gentle, loving soul, is the only daughter in the McReary family. Packie says she is the only honest and good McReary sibling, and she's one of the few encountered characters in the game who doesn't have a criminal record. Several of Packie's stories about the McReary family have to do with Kate witnessing several violent acts at a very young age, such as watching Gerry and Francis angrily beat each other up or catching Gerry return home with blood all over his clothes. She serves as Niko's primary love interest in the game, at one point kissing him on the cheek, and she can be taken out on dates like all the other girlfriends in the game. However, unlike the other girlfriends in the game, she never invites Niko into her house after a successful date, due to her unwillingness to engage in [[Fornication|pre-marital sex]] (a point that Packie regularly jokes about).

If the player chooses the &quot;Deal&quot; storyline, Kate sees that Niko will compromise his principles for money and refuses to go to Roman's wedding with him. However, after Roman's death, Kate offers her condolences and support to Niko. If the player chooses the &quot;Revenge&quot; storyline, she attends Roman's wedding with Niko and starts to pursue a romantic relationship with him. However, this is cut short when Jimmy Pegorino, who is enraged by Niko's betrayal and the failure of his drug deal, turns up at Roman's wedding and guns her down in a drive-by killing. Roman later says that if he and Mallorie have a daughter together, they will name her Kate to honor her memory.

Kate McReary is voiced by Mary Catherine Donnelly.

====Bernie Crane/Florian Cravic====
''Introduced in: &quot;Weekend at Florian's&quot;''


'''Bernie Crane''' (1978 - real name '''Florian Cravic''') ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: Ð¤Ð»Ð¾ÑÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð½ ÐÑÐ°Ð²Ð¸Ñ, ''Florian KraviÄ'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]]: '''Florijan KraviÄ'''),
Florian Cravic, known in Liberty City as Bernie Crane (after changing his name apon arrival to America.) Was the only other surviving member of Niko Bellic's squad after Darko Brevic. America has changed him greatly, as apparent by his new founded homosexuality after moving to Liberty City. Bernie is a lifestyle coach, and having a secret affair with the Deputy Mayor, Bryce Dawkins. He is first introduced in the mission &quot;Weekend at Florian's&quot; after being located by Niko with the help of &quot;Talbot Daniels&quot;. Niko originally intends to kill Florian. However, before Niko can even mention why he came over, Florian accuses him of betraying the unit first, and they realise that Darko Brevic must be responsible. Niko then starts to do some work for Bernie, first fending off a homophobic stalker, and then Dimitri Rascalov when he tries to blackmail Bryce Dawkins for his homosexual affair. Bernie later shows up at Roman's wedding. Florian Cravic is voiced by [[Timothy J. Alex]].

'''United Liberty Paper''', also known as '''U.L. Paper''' or simply '''U.L.P.C.''', is a front for a shadowy government agency that denies any affiliation to existing branches such as the [[FBI|Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (or Federal Investigation Bureau/FIB as it is referred to in the game) to which Niko's contact even expresses disgust when Niko asks him, or National Office Of Security Enforcement (NOOSE). Niko's contact is a presumed government agent who is revealed as Michelle's superior, known in many circles as The Contact. Niko is given a choice - he can work for him - the work including reconnaissance and assassination missions -
or risk exposure to local law enforcements. In return for Niko's services, The Contact promises to use his organization to search Europe for Darko BreviÄ, which he knows Niko is unlikely to refuse. The Contact never reveals his true name and as such is often referred to synonymously with the organization he represents (although a diploma of some sort behind his desk reads &quot;Edward T. Fortune&quot;). The United Liberty Paper finally finds Darko BreviÄ and, after Niko helps The Contact's mutual friend, John Gravelli, he has him transported to Liberty City from Bucharest and lets Niko deal with him himself. He says he was in the army, and once addresses Niko in [[Serbian language|Serbian]], saying that America is 'just like the Old Country' (Niko responds (in Serbian) &quot;Just like it.&quot;).

The Contact's appearance (complete with horn-rimmed glasses) as well as the fact that the agency's front is a paper company may be references to [[Noah Bennet]] and [[Primatech Paper]] respectively, from the TV series ''[[Heroes (TV series)|Heroes]]''. The Contact also bears an uncanny resemblance to Milton James, the actor who portrays him.

Within the game's architecture, the character's texture and model are labelled 'GIA' in the absence of a name for the character.&lt;ref&gt;Filepath: anim/cutsprops.img within installation directory - archive files beginning 'cs_cia'&lt;/ref&gt;

United Liberty Paper is voiced by [[Milton James]].

====Phil Bell====
''Introduced in: &quot;No Way On The Subway&quot;''

'''Phil Bell''' (born 1968) is a high ranking member of the [[List of Gangs in Grand Theft Auto#Pegorino Family|Pegorino crime family]], and the right hand man of Don Jimmy Pegorino. He is 90% Irish with some Italian heritage. He gives Niko a few tasks towards the end of the game, also accompanying him on some of them. Bell and Ray Boccino strongly dislike each other, and after a while Pegorino is forced to choose between the two. He chooses Ray and sends Niko to kill him.

In either the &quot;Deal&quot; or &quot;Revenge&quot; game ending, Phil and Niko end on good terms, and Phil decides to leave organized crime for good. In &quot;Deal&quot;, Bell joins Niko in fighting to pick up a large payment for a heroin deal after Dimitri Rascalov has ruined the plans by killing the buyer's representatives, they successfully manage this and both can enjoy a large cut of the cash. In &quot;Revenge&quot; after Niko has killed Dimitri Rascalov, Phil calls to say he understands why Niko chose to do what he did and informs him that the Pegorino's have fallen apart and they can no longer talk. He finishes with &quot;I'm out man, goodbye&quot;. It is revealed that Bell has a divorced wife and at least two children.

Phil Bell was voiced by [[Frank Bonsangue]].

====Jon Gravelli====

''Introduced in: &quot;Entourage&quot;''

''Dies after: &quot;A Revenger`s Tragedy(Deal)&quot;''/''Out of Commission(Revenge)&quot;''

'''Jon Gravelli''' (1923â2008) was an old school and well connected Mafia boss who took charge of the Gambetti Family in 1978 after the death of Sonny Cangelosi. The Gambetti Family became one of the most powerful of Liberty City's Mafia families under Gravelli's leadership. He had a son, Jon Gravelli, Jr., who was a former associate of the Gambetti's but was disowned after he developed a cocaine addiction.

Since 2005, he was a patient in Schottler Medical Center. He was charged with racketeering in 2006 and was awaiting trial. In 2008, Gravelli was introduced to Niko Bellic via cell phone through his contact at U.L. Paper who is referred to as a &quot;mutual friend&quot;. Gravelli and Niko quickly take a mutual liking to each other, and Gravelli expresses his gratitude by saying &quot;you've given a dying man a last few moments of happiness&quot;. It was through his and U.L Paper's assistance that Niko is able to have Darko Brevic delivered to him. After Niko has taken his revenge on Dimitri Rascalov or Jimmy Pegorino, Gravelli passes away peacefully in his sleep, prior to standing trial. His death was off-screen not showing the outcome.

He might be based on [[Junior Soprano]] or real life Mafia Don [[Carlo Gambino]].

Jon Gravelli is voiced by Madison Arnold.

====Wade &quot;The Fixer&quot; Johnson====

'''Wade Johnson''', known as '''The Fixer''', is an assassin agency manager in Liberty City. He works by receiving tasks from employers and later contacting known hitmen through payphones and delivering instructions to them on who to kill. He is a friend of Phil Bell who establishes a connection between Johnson and Niko Bellic. Johnson gives Niko assassination missions by calling him on a payphone and telling him who to kill. After performing his missions for a time, Fixer cuts ties with Niko to avoid drawing attention towards himself.
He can be found on alderney island

====Vlad Glebov====
''Introduced in: &quot;It's Your Call&quot;''

''Killed in: &quot;Uncle Vlad&quot;''

'''Vladimir &quot;Vlad&quot; Glebov''' (1967â2008) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ÐÐ»Ð°Ð´Ð¸Ð¼Ð¸Ñ &quot;ÐÐ»Ð°Ð´&quot; ÐÐ»ÐµÐ±Ð¾Ð²) is a Russian loan shark in Hove Beach, Broker. Vlad also owns the ''Comrades Bar'' in Hove Beach, which he frequents. Vlad is an alcoholic and a user of cocaine, for he is seen snorting a vial of cocaine on one occasion. Vlad tries to gain respect from more influential gangsters and is sometimes hypocritical about the citizens of Liberty City. He is also extremely arrogant. Niko despises Vlad from the start, who treats Roman poorly and refers to Niko as a &quot;yokel&quot; and a &quot;peasant.&quot; Niko also warns Vlad to stay away from Mallorie Bardas, Roman's girlfriend. All the same Niko does a few jobs for Vlad as a favor to Roman. After Niko learns that Vlad has been cheating with Mallorie behind Roman's back, he is outraged, especially when Roman tries to convince him to let the matter die. Despite Roman's attempts to talk him out of it, Niko rushes to Comrade's and confronts Vlad. After a furious chase with Vlad, Niko shoots him execution style under Broker Bridge, with a panicked Roman by his side, which gains the attention of Vlad's Superior, Mikhail Faustin. Roman lies to Mallorie about his death, saying that he killed Vlad in a fit of rage and that Niko merely disposed of the body for him. On the LCPD database, Vlad is listed as missing, not deceased because Niko and Roman disposed Vlad's body into the Humboldt River from a jetty.

Vlad Glebov is voiced by [[Misha Kuznetsov]].

====Playboy X====
''Introduced in: &quot;Blow Your Cover&quot;''

''Can be killed in: &quot;The Holland Play&quot;''

'''Trey &quot;Playboy X&quot; Stewart''' (1983-2008 (conditional)) is a [[African-American|black]] [[gangbanger]]. He was introduced to Niko by Elizabeta Torres and he owns a [[penthouse apartment|penthouse]] in Northwood. He was the protÃ©gÃ© of Dwayne Forge, a drug baron and gang leader who was recently released from prison, but Playboy has since moved on without him, fully embracing the new criminal world of [[materialism]] that blurs on the legitimate. He aspires to be a [[property developer]] and &quot;see [his] name in big, gold letters!&quot;. He seeks an alliance with an extremely wealthy condo developer from [[Dubai]] named Yusuf Amir, by having Niko kill unionized [[construction]] workers that have invaded his site, but after the situation, Yusuf refuses to meet with Playboy, and builds a memorial to the murdered workers. He often admits that he is damaging his neighborhood with drugs and says that once he is wealthy he wishes to give back to schools and children. However, his penthouse and lifestyle show that he is already a huge success. Playboy is also sorely uneducated, claiming that Dubai is located in [[Africa]] and that [[Jesus Christ]] killed [[John the Baptist]]. Playboy eventually pays Niko to work for Dwayne, mainly because he does not want to deal with Dwayne himself anymore. After Niko, on Dwayne's orders, shuts down and kills the managers of a strip club that Playboy owns, Playboy realizes that his old mentor does not understand the new way business is done and that he is a hindrance to his organization. He asks Niko to kill Dwayne. Dwayne, sensing he is a target, asks Niko to kill Playboy. Niko must choose whom to kill. If the player kills Dwayne, Playboy pays Niko a large sum of money but scolds him for killing his &quot;father figure&quot; and refuses to speak to him again. If the player chooses to kill Playboy X, a gunfight occurs when Playboy orders his goons to shoot Niko inside his penthouse while he attempts to make an escape through the other building. Once his gang is gunned down by Niko, he is eventually cornered in an alley just as he tries to pull the door open. He attempts to shoot Niko, only to find out that his pistol is jammed (ironically, when he throws it to the ground, it goes off). Niko then executes him. After his death, Niko receives Playboy's penthouse in North Holland (including the outfit worn by Claude in [[Grand Theft Auto III|GTA III]]). The player is also able to befriend Dwayne and call him to send backup during missions. Killing him gives better rewards then killing Dwayne.

Playboy X is voiced by [[Postell Pringle]].

====Mikhail Faustin====
''Introduced in: &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot;''

''Killed in: &quot;The Master and the Molotov&quot;''

'''Mikhail Faustin''' (1963â2008) ([[Russian language|Russian]]: ÐÐ¸ÑÐ°Ð¸Ð» Ð¤Ð°ÑÑÑÐ¸Ð½) is a major figure in Liberty City's [[Bratva]] and the owner of the [[cabaret]] club ''Perestroika''. He is considered one of the richest residents of Broker, with a large house in the suburb of Beachgate and a &quot;Turismo&quot; sports car (based on the [[Ferrari 360 Modena]]). He has a wife, Ilyena, and a daughter, Anna, who dates a member of the biker gang &quot;The Lost&quot;, much to his displeasure.
He is first introduced when one of his henchmen abducts Niko and Roman for killing Vlad Glebov and interrogates him for his motive. However, Mikhail's reaction when he discovers what is going on in his basement reveals that he had not authorised it. In his rage, he kills his henchman and shoots Roman in the stomach for screaming too loudly. Although he was far from pleased that Niko killed Vlad, he allows him to walk free as long as he works for him, as he personally believed that Vlad was an idiot himself. Mikhail specifically says &quot;I only keep him around because I fuck his sister&quot;, which also reveals he cheats on his wife. Due to alcohol and drug abuse, Mikhail goes through angry mood swings, which causes him to order hits on people for very minor things. He is also quick to physically and mentally abuse his wife. This upsets his partner and old friend, Dimitri, who realizes that the numerous deaths are bad for business and attracts unwanted attention from the law. Things boil over when Mikhail, on a whim, orders Niko to kill Lenny PetroviÄ, the son of another major Bratva boss, Kenny PetroviÄ, as he suspects Lenny was a snitch. As Dimitri tries to smooth things over with Petrovic, Faustin has Niko blow up a garage in Bohan with a truck fulled with explosives, simply because the owner did not pay him.

Dimitri sets up Niko to assassinate Mikhail, under the promise of protection from Kenny PetroviÄ to prove that the death should be blamed on Mikhail and that Niko was just a hired gun. Deciding there is no choice, Niko confronts Faustin in ''Perestroikia'' where he gets into a gunfight with Faustin and his bodyguards. Chasing the crime lord to the top of the club, Niko corners Faustin and aims a gun at him. Enraged and accepting his fate, Faustin begins to ramble at Niko. He tells him that neither he or Dimitri will survive in America without him, and that the greed of Liberty City takes over everyone. Niko executes Faustin, but not before he is warned by Faustin that Dimitri will betray him. When Niko goes to collect the money for the hit, Dimitri tries to sell Niko to his former boss from his [[Mediterranean]] human trafficking days, '''Bulgarin''', who believes Niko owes him money after his ship crashed.

Mikhail Faustin is voiced by [[Karel Roden]].

====Francis McReary====
''Introduced in: &quot;Street Sweeper&quot;''

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Francis &quot;Frankie&quot; McReary''' (born 1963 - 2008 (conditional)) is the Deputy Commissioner of the Liberty City Police Department, and hopes to replace Mitt Fitzsimmons as Commissioner when he retires.  However, blackmailers have emerged with evidence of his corruption. Francis first meets Niko briefly during a publicity shoot with Manny Escuela and later contacts Niko confidentially, wanting to pay him to silence those who wish to expose his corruption. He also knows that Niko killed Mikhail Faustin, and uses this information to [[blackmail]] Niko into his service. Francis is, above all, a hypocrite; believing that his position automatically makes him a good person and absolves him of any corruption. The McReary family is fully aware of this - as a youngster, he became an [[altar server]], insisting that he wanted to serve [[The Lord]]. However, Gerry revealed that he only became an altar boy to steal the money from the church collection plate, but believed the theft should be overlooked because he was an altar server. Francis then attempted to become a [[priest]] but was barred from applying after it emerged he cheated on his seminary exam. Francis then pursued his career in the L.C.P.D. The only reason why Francis does not take down his own family is because his brother, Gerald, has a lot of dirt on Francis' past and will alert the authorities the moment Francis tries anything.

Francis eventually discovers that his older brother Derrick has returned to Liberty City from [[Ireland]]. Francis believes he will alert the press about his corruption, and orders Niko to assassinate Derrick. Francis lures Derrick to a secluded park bench, while Niko waits on a rooftop with a sniper-rifle. However, Niko is then presented with the choice of whether to kill Derrick or Francis. In ''Blood Brothers'',  Niko can call Francis to increase his pay before the assassination on Derrick occurs. If Niko decides to kill Derrick, he may call Francis once to remove a 3-Star wanted level. If Niko kills Francis, he gets nothing from Derrick except a &quot;thank you&quot;, and Packie will say that he couldn't stand him.

Francis McReary is voiced by Thomas Lyons.

====Ray Boccino====
''Introduced in: &quot;Harboring a Grudge&quot;''

''Killed in: &quot;Pest Control&quot;''

'''Raymond &quot;Ray&quot; Boccino''' (1976â2008) is a [[caporegime]] in the Pegorino Family. After being introduced to Niko by Packie McReary, Ray hires Niko for several jobs, mostly revolving around a valuable diamond deal with Isaac Roth that ultimately fails. After completing a few missions for Ray, Niko is given a safehouse in Alderney. In return for Niko's help, Ray helps locate Florian Cravic, the man Niko had tracked to Liberty City and suspects of betraying his old army unit. The diamond deal is not Ray's first failed large-scale venture, which upsets Don Jimmy Pegorino greatly - he considers Ray to be a dumb thug who's desperate to rise through the ranks. Ray dislikes Phil Bell, due to his closer friendship with Pegorino, despite being of [[Irish-American]] descent. He also becomes jealous of Niko as he gains more favor with the Don. Niko eventually kills him at the request of Pegorino, who thinks he is a rat.

Ray Boccino is voiced by [[Joe Barbara]].

====Gerry McReary====
''Introduced in: &quot;Three Leaf Clover&quot;''

''Convicted before: &quot;Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend&quot;''

'''Gerald &quot;Gerry&quot; McReary''' (born 1973) is the boss of the Liberty City [[Irish Mob]] and brother of the Deputy Police Commissioner, Francis McReary. He gives orders through his younger brother, Packie. Gerry is upset with the McReary Family's weakened state, which has them working as hired guns for the Pegorino family and other organizations, because they used to be the most powerful gang in the city. He does not trust Niko at first because he is not Irish, but changes his mind after Niko helps the McReary Family with a daring bank heist. Gerry then tasks Niko with attacking other criminal organizations to prove that the McReary Family still has power, but which also benefit his employer, Don Jimmy Pegorino. Gerry starts to grow a trust with Niko asking him to help watch over the family while he's in prison. Throughout the course of the game, he is released from prison and subsequently rearrested on charges such as armed robbery and racketeering. Despite being incarcerated, Gerry still gives thinly veiled orders to Niko revolving around the kidnapping of Gracie Ancelotti to barter for diamonds that the Ancelotti family stole from Ray Boccino. Although Packie initially believes that the charges against Gerry will be dropped, Gerry hints to Niko that he will be in prison until 2009

Gerry McReary is voiced by P. J. Sosko.

====Derrick McReary====
''Introduced in: &quot;Three Leaf Clover&quot;''

''Can be killed in: &quot;Blood Brothers&quot;''

'''Derrick McReary''' (born 1956 - 2008 (conditional)) is yet another member of McReary Family and the oldest. He has a drug and alcohol problem, so Packie asks Niko to keep an eye out for his brother's safety. Derrick has recently returned from [[Ireland]] where he assisted the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] in [[The Troubles|fighting]] [[British Army|the British]], but his other brother, Francis, says that Derrick actually fled there to lie low because he ripped off powerful mobsters in Liberty City. Two of Derrick's old friends, Bucky Sligo and Aiden O'Malley, believed that Derrick snitched on them to the authorities and constantly threatened him and his family as result, despite Derrick's claims of innocence. The accusations from his former friends caused him tremendous grief and fueled his drug addictions. If Niko hangs out with Packie enough, he will eventually reveal that Derrick actually did snitch on Bucky and Aiden (This is also indicated on his record LCPD criminal profile database, accessible on the in-game internet). Derrick McReary was the leader of the Irish Mob but gave the position to Gerry after he left.

Derrick seems to be the most compassionate of all the McReary children, as is shown with the way he tries to calm down the bank staff and customers during the heist. When Francis discovers that Derrick is back in town, he worries that he will reveal Francis' corruption to the press for money. He talks with Derrick in a park as part of an attempt to use Niko to kill him, thinking that he must go outside the law to take down his brother. Niko has a choice of whom to kill. If Derrick is killed, Francis then provides Niko with a more detailed version of the LCPD database and the player will also have the option to call Francis to get rid of a wanted level up to 3 stars only once. Niko will also be paid very royaly in the process. If Francis is killed, Derrick will last be seen at his funeral and never appears again.

Derrick McReary is voiced by George Feaster.

He is currently recording a documentary explaining his struggles and problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Char2&quot;/&gt; Manny hires Niko to kill criminals while Manny takes the credit. He gets upset with the final cut of the documentary, claiming it does not make him look &quot;street.&quot; As a result, Niko becomes more annoyed of Manny running his mouth. He is shot in the head along with his cameraman by Elizabeta Torres after he angers her by confronting her for new, more aggressive material for the documentary. The bodies are given to a doctor for the black market organ trade, which Niko finds ironic because Manny will finally help people, but in a very different way. Because Niko gave Manny and Jay's bodies to a black market doctor, they are listed as &quot;Missing&quot; on the LCPD database, and not &quot;Deceased.&quot;  In &quot;[[Grand Theft Auto IV: The Ballad of Gay Tony]]&quot;, Troy, the doorman at Tony Prince's nightclub ''Hercules'', says he is going to have a film crew follow him around because their previous subject (Manny) disappeared.

Manny Escuela is voiced by [[Berto ColÃ³n]].

====Elizabeta Torres====
''Introduced in: &quot;Luck of the Irish&quot;''

''Arrested in: &quot;Have a Heart&quot;''

'''Elizabeta 'Liz' Torres''' (born 1977) is a successful small-time Puerto Rican drug dealer in Bohan. She was notorious in her home country after she brutally killed a man that tried to rape her when she was only 14. However, Elizabeta knows an upcoming drug crackdown is going to make her life very difficult&lt;ref name=&quot;Char2&quot;/&gt; and with her own narcotic use spiraling out of control, she's becoming increasingly paranoid and delusional. She introduces Niko to Packie McReary and later to Johnny Klebitz. In a drugged panic, she shoots Manny and his [[cameraman]] Jay&lt;ref name=&quot;IGNCharactersGTA4&quot;/&gt; after he tries to film her as part of his documentary about the crime in Bohan. She then tells Niko to drive the bodies to a black market building before the cops find out about it. After Niko eliminates the bodies of Manny and his cameraman, he receives a call from Elizabeta saying that she's cutting off their relationship because the [[police]] are closing in on her. By using the police database website, the player can find out she is in police custody. According to news reports, and the in-game radio, Torres is found guilty of 30 charges of cocaine distribution, 10 years per charge, totaling 300 years in prison, and would die during her imprisonment. It is also hinted that she may be bisexual, but she mentions to Johnny Klebitz that she has been married three times.

Elizabeta initially appeared in the third trailer and in the promotional artwork for the game. Although earlier renditions of the artwork depict her as much thinner than her final appearance, it is shown on advertisement posters made by Rockstar Games that she is between 170&amp;nbsp;cm - 180&amp;nbsp;cm tall and may weigh 110-115 kilograms. Elizabeta drives a pink and white Voodoo and she lives in an apartment block on San Quentin Avenue in Fortside. Later on in the story if you go to the Liberty city tree on the internet, it says she gets arrested for drugs, Cocaine.

'''Michelle/Karen''' is Niko's first girlfriend and met through [[List of characters in Grand Theft Auto IV#Mallorie Bardas-Bellic|Mallorie Bardas-Bellic]]. Niko takes her on a date to the carnival, though these arrangements are changed to the bowling alley.

Niko appears to like Michelle, and Roman and Mallorie encourage him to keep dating her - however, the player may notice Michelle is very awkward or wooden around Niko. Her conversations and text messages are also suspicious - they are always probing about whether Niko is involved with some &quot;bad people&quot;.

Provided she is taken on enough good dates, Michelle may invite Niko into her home. She &quot;appreciates&quot; Niko in her wooden way, and Niko refers to her as a &quot;good listener&quot;.

Later in the game, (During the mission ''&quot;The Snow Storm&quot;'') she reveals her real name is Karen, and that she has betrayed him. She takes the drugs Niko had stolen, blackmailing Niko into working for U.L.Paper. After this mission Niko can no longer date her. Niko is understandably extremely bitter, and the two never speak again after a final confrontation outside Paper's building.

U.L.Paper reveals that Karen tricked Niko for them to &quot;get her life back&quot;. She made some mistakes in her life, and needed some money and freedom to get on with it.

They kidnap him and bring him to Liberty City where Niko confronts him, discovering that Darko has a drug addiction and that he betrayed his unit for a mere $1,000 in order to fund his addiction, and implies that he wanted to get back at some members of the unit who murdered his neighbours. During the time that has since passed, his addiction has worsened from his overwhelming guilt. Darko begs Niko to kill him, freeing him from his demons. The player is given the choice of killing him or sparing his life. If the player spares Darko, Darko will stand up to his feet, then runs away screaming, and is no longer seen again. Niko initially becomes angry at his decision and admits that &quot;it took every fiber of my being pulling in the same direction not to kill Darko,&quot; but decides that killing Darko would not have changed anything and that allowing him to suffer is a worse punishment than death. Both Roman and Bernie congratulate him for finally releasing his inner demons and overcoming his desire for revenge.

Darko then thanks Niko with his dying breath and Niko does not feel any better at all.

Afterwards, he can be encountered on the streets, where he teams up with Niko to take out a rival gang of drug dealers. Jacob often mentions Badman's growing paranoia due to his marijuana consumption, expressing concern that he doesn't want to get in his way.
