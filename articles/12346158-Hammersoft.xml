'''Smosh''' is a web-based comedy duo consisting of '''Ian Hecox''' and '''Anthony Padilla'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.batchbuzz.com/detailedStoryDefault.php?id=751|title= BB Suggests: The Best of Web TV|accessdate=2009-11-16 |date= November 13, 2009 |publisher= Batch Buzz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Padilla first began posting [[flash animation|flash movies]] on [[Newgrounds]] in early 2003, under the name Smosh. He was later joined by his friend Ian Hecox. Soon afterward they began to post videos on [[YouTube]] in the autumn of 2005 and became one of the most popular channels on that site, with more than 3.7 million subscribers as of November 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;smosh channel&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title=smosh's Channel|url=http://www.youtube.com/smosh|publisher=YouTube|accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four Smosh-related channels exist on YouTube. The base &quot;Smosh&quot; channel, where both Ian and Anthony post their skits and other videos, has new videos every Friday. From &quot;IanH&quot; (used at first for vlogs and other non-scripted videos), the pair upload their side series &quot;Ian is Bored&quot; on Mondays and &quot;Lunchtime with Smosh&quot; on Thursdays, while their associate performer Mari does &quot;Smosh Pit Weekly&quot; videos on Saturday. A third channel, called &quot;AskCharlie&quot;, is based on the popular Smosh character Charlie the Drunk Guinea Pig. It uploads videos every Wednesday. Their final channel, &quot;AnthonyPadilla&quot;, has been inactive since February 2011; it was formerly where Anthony made vlog-like videos on his own.

==History==
===Formation and ''PokÃ©mon Theme Music Video'': 2005â2009===
Smosh began when Ian Hecox and Anthony Padilla made several videos together, lip syncing to theme songs such as [[Mortal Kombat]], [[Power Rangers]], and [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]. At first, these videos were not intended to be posted online, but after they sent them to their friends, they started a [[YouTube]] channel.

One of Smosh's earliest videos, &quot;PokÃ©mon Theme Music Video,&quot; was released in November 2005. It followed the same style as their other earlier videos, featuring the duo lip-synching the original English theme song for the [[PokÃ©mon anime]]. However, the video instantly became much more popular than any of their other videos; over the course of its lifetime, it gained 24.7 million views, becoming the most-viewed video on all of YouTube at that time.&lt;ref name=&quot;nyt-1&quot;&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/04/arts/04iht-videos.html | title= Comic shorts, home on the Web | publisher=The New York Times | author= [[Virginia Heffernan]] | date= April 4, 2006 | accessdate=November 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; It held that title for about six months, but was removed by YouTube after the website received a notice from [[Shogakukan Productions Co., Ltd.]], claiming copyright infringement.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}

The success of their ''PokÃ©mon'' video and other videos led Smosh to be featured in the &quot;Person of the Year: You&quot; issue of ''[[Time Magazine]]'', published December 13, 2006. It also inspired them to expand their style beyond basic lip-synching videos, and eventually to start creating videos of various genres, such as mini-skits and sketch comedies.{{Citation needed|date=August 2011}}. In March 2007, a user named Andii2000 re-uploaded the original PokÃ©mon video. It has over 12.9 million views as of November 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOX3OmUhQoo |title=SMOSH - POKEMON THEME SONG |author=Andii2000 |date=March 17, 2007 |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=November 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2010 era===
In January 2010, Smosh launched the &quot;Smosh Pit&quot; feature, a blog that consists of various pieces of pop-culture trivia. In addition, 2010 saw the channel launch 3 different Smosh-based web series: &quot;Ian is Bored,&quot; which started as a collection of comedic videos by Hecox, but then turned primarily into Smosh opening [[fan mail]] segments called &quot;Mail time with Smosh&quot;; &quot;Ask Charlie&quot; (which is an interactive series where people ask Charlie, from their January 2010 &quot;Charlie the Drunk Guinea Pig&quot; video, random questions); and &quot;Lunchtime with Smosh,&quot; a Comedy series featuring Smosh getting and eating food from various places.

Also in early 2010, Smosh created the &quot;iShut Up App&quot; for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] phones as part of a [[Google]] sponsorship; it eventually made its way to the [[iTunes]] app store. As of November 19 2011, Smosh is the third most-subscribed channel on YouTube.&lt;ref name=&quot;smosh channel&quot;/&gt;
