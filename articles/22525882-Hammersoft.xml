<?xml version="1.0"?><api><query><pages><page pageid="22525882" ns="0" title="Rugby union trophies and awards"><revisions><rev xml:space="preserve">'''Rugby union trophies and awards''' have been given out to teams and participants from the very earliest days of the sport's history. In common with many other sports [[rugby union]] has an array of competitions, both domestic international, covering the spectrum of competition structures from season long leagues, to one-off matches. The list below is divided into sections such that trophies and awards competed for by national sides are grouped together, as are those competed for by club and provincial sides. In both cases, the type of award can differ. The award might be a perpetual trophy, which is one competed for in perpetuity by two sides such that on each occasion they meet, which may or may not be on a regular basis, that honour is contested. The award may be one that is given to the winner of a tournament, or as a subset of this, as an award for a particular honour attained in that tournament. Additionally, the sport of rugby union bestows certain honours on individual players, and these too have their own dedicated section below.
