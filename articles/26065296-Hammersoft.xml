'''''The Real Global Warming Disaster''''' (''Is The Obsession With 'Climate Change' Turning Out To Be the Most Costly Scientific Blunder In History?'') is a 2009 book by English journalist and author [[Christopher Booker]] written from a standpoint of [[environmental scepticism]] which aims to show how scientists and politicians came to believe in [[global warming|anthropogenic global warming]].

In the book, Booker seeks to combine the science of the subject with its political consequences, and writes that, as governments become poised to make radical changes in [[Energy policy|energy policies]], the [[scientific evidence]] for global warming is becoming increasingly challenged. He states that global warming is not [[scientific opinion on climate change|supported by a significant number of the world's climate scientists]], and criticises how the [[United Nations|UN]]'s [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) presents evidence and [[data]], citing its reliance on potentially inaccurate [[global climate models]] to make temperature projections. He concludes &quot;it begins to look very possible that the nightmare vision of our planet being doomed&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-342&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be imaginary, and that, if so, &quot;it will turn out to be one of the most expensive, destructive, and foolish mistakes the human race has ever made&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-342&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=342}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Booker in particular refers to the cost of implementing the UK's [[Climate Change Act 2008|Climate Change Act of 2008]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book's claims were strongly criticised by [[science journalist|science writer]] [[Philip Ball]],&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;

Before the book's publication, Booker wrote in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' that the motivation behind it lay in a consideration of &quot;the supposed menace of global warmingâand the political response to it&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker The Sunday Telegraph&quot;&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the book's introduction, Booker also describes how ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'' became for him a necessary continuation of a brief analysis he had made of the anthropogenic global warming issue in his previous book, ''Scared to Death'', and followed a similar theme he had explored there, i.e., that of the media overstating the danger of an issue facing the public, and governments overreacting to the issue by passing legislation entailing considerable economic cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-4&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==

The book consists of three parts and an epilogue.

=== Part One: Forging the 'consensus': 1972â1997 ===
[[File:James Hansen.jpg|thumb|right|James Hansen giving testimony before the United States Congress in 1988]]
Drawing from [[Fred Singer]] and [[Dennis Avery]]'s ''[[Unstoppable Global Warming: Every 1,500 Years|Unstoppable Global Warming]]'', Booker presents a [[Information graphics|graph]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-21&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing changes in temperature and carbon dioxide concentration over the last 11,000 years. In his analysis, rising carbon dioxide concentrations in the 1970s led scientists such as [[Paul R. Ehrlich|Paul Ehrlich]] to postulate that the earth, as a result of the [[greenhouse effect]], may have been heating up or cooling down, either of which could have potentially disastrous consequences. Figures such as the environmental activist [[Maurice Strong]] and scientist [[Bert Bolin]] are then introduced, who would, according to Booker, &quot;play a crucial role in what lay ahead&quot; in influencing governmental policy and helping form the scientific basis for global warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-32&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker contends that 1988 was a key year in which the IPCC was set up and [[James Hansen]] appeared at the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources|Senate Committee of Natural Resources]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], where he stated that he was &quot;99 percent certain&quot; that man's contribution to the greenhouse effect was the cause of global warming.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-41&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Booker, &quot;on all sides 'global warming' became the cause of the moment&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-38&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; after Hansen's appearance. He then describes how:

* in 1990, the IPCC published its [[IPCC First Assessment Report|first assessment report]] which made projections of future temperature rises;
* at the [[Earth Summit (1992)|Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit]] &quot;politicians from 154 countries queued up to sign a '[[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UN Framework Convention on Climate Change']]&quot; that would &quot;commit all the signatory governments to a voluntary reduction of greenhouse gas emissions&quot;;&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-53&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the [[IPCC Second Assessment Report|second IPCC report]] (SAR) in 1995 found that the &quot;body of statistical evidence now points to a discernible human influence on the global climate&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-63&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=63}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Booker writes that the SAR was criticised by [[Frederick Seitz]], who alleged that &quot;more than 15 sections in Chapter 8 of the reportâthe key chapter setting out the scientific evidence for and against a human influence over climateâwere changed or deleted after the scientists charged with examining this question had accepted the supposedly final text&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-65&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part one ends with an account of the signing of the 1997 [[Kyoto Protocol]] and the setting of new targets for reduced {{chem|CO|2}} emissions.

=== Part Two: The 'consensus' carries all before it: 1998â2007 ===
Booker begins part two by asserting that the [[Medieval Warm Period|medieval warm period]] &quot;contradicted the idea that late twentieth century temperatures had suddenly shot up to a level never known before in history&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-80&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that this problem was [[Hockey stick controversy|dealt with by a 1999 graph]] depicting temperatures &quot;suddenly shooting up in the twentieth century to a level that was quite unprecedented. Familiar features such as the Medieval Warm Period and the little ice age simply vanished&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-83&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker writes that the graph became the &quot;supreme iconic image for all those engaged in the battle to save the world from global warming&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-84&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then states that the IPCC's methods, and in particular the [[IPCC Summary for Policymakers|draft summary]] of its [[IPCC Third Assessment Report|next report]], came in for serious criticism from scientists such as [[Richard Lindzen]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-88&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Booker then examines [[Davis Guggenheim]]'s [[Academy Award|Oscar]]-winning film ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]'' and the subsequent questioning of many of its assertions, including [[Retreat of glaciers since 1850|retreating glaciers]], drowning [[polar bear]]s, use of the &quot;hockey stick&quot; graph, the melting of the [[Polar ice cap|ice caps]] and snows of [[Mount Kilimanjaro|Kilimanjaro]] and [[Current sea level rise|rising sea levels]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-144-150&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| pp=144â150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Part Three: The 'consensus' begins to crumble: 2007â2009 ===
[[File:HenrikSvensmark.jpg|thumb|125px|right|Henrik Svensmark, who carried out research into a link between solar and temperature trends]]

Booker begins part three by quoting the statement of the then [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|British Environment Secretary]] that the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report|IPCC's fourth assessment report]] was &quot;another nail in the coffin of the climate change deniers&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-173&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=173}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker contrasts this assertion with what he sees as evidence emerging to the contrary: that the earth had in fact [[surface temperature record|begun to cool]], possibly as a result of [[solar variation]], and that {{chem|CO|2}} may thus not be the only driver of climate change. However, the results of research into this theory by the scientists Knud Lassen, [[Eigil Friis-Christensen]] and [[Henrik Svensmark]] were dismissed by Bert Bolin as &quot;scientifically extremely naÃ¯ve and irresponsible&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-180&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker then alleges that a &quot;consensus&quot; and &quot;counter-consensus&quot; had begun to form, and gives details of a 2007 report by the US Senator [[James Inhofe]] that claimed to list 400 scientists &quot;now prepared to express their dissent, sometimes in the strongest terms, from the IPCC's 'consensus' view of global warming&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-208&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker then quotes the June 2007 [[International Energy Agency]] announcement that the cost of halving {{chem|CO|2}} emissions by 2050 (the US and UK governments were intending 80% cuts&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-255&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;) would be US$ 45 trillionâequivalent to &quot;two thirds of the world's entire current annual economic output&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-233&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=233}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Booker sums up the book's content in a long epilogue, which quotes [[Theseus]] in ''[[A Midsummer's Night Dream]]'':

&quot;In the night, imagining some fear,
How easy is a bush supposed a bear&quot;.

Booker contends that in this quote [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] is identifying that &quot;when we are not presented with enough information for our minds to resolve something into certainty, they may be teased into exaggerating it into something quite different from what it really is&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker-341&quot;&gt;{{harvnb |Booker|2009| p=341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

The book received a mixed reception by press reviewers.

In his review in ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Philip Ball]] (former editor of ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'') stated the book was &quot;the definitive climate sceptics' manual&quot; in that it makes an uncritical presentation of &quot;just about every criticism ever made of the majority scientific view&quot; on global warming. Though expressing &quot;a queer kind of admiration for the skill and energy with which Booker has assembled his polemic&quot;, Ball called the claims made by the author &quot;bunk&quot;. Ball also criticised Booker's tactic of introducing climate sceptics &quot;with a little eulogy to their credentials, while their opponents receive only a perfunctory, if not disparaging, preamble&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;guardian.co.uk&quot;&gt;

In ''[[The Spectator]]'', [[Rodney Leach]] wrote that &quot;the shelf of sceptical books keeps filling and Booker's belongs there with the best&quot;, remarking that Booker &quot;narrates this story with the journalist's pace and eye for telling detail and the historian's forensic thoroughness which have made him a formidable opponent of [[humbug]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Leach The Spectator&quot;&gt;

Writing in ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', [[Brian Morton (Scottish writer)|Brian Morton]] was largely sympathetic to the position taken by Booker in the book: &quot;The question isn't whether climate is changing, but what is to blame. A crippling tithe of international political effort and social action is directed to the assumption that we are&quot;, and &quot;the climate change debateâor enforced consensusâconcerns the way science is done and perceived. As Booker says, 'consensus' is not a term in science but in politics&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Morton The_Herald&quot;&gt;

==Houghton misquotation==

The book opens with an incorrect quotation which wrongly attributes to [[John T. Houghton]] the words &quot;Unless we announce disasters, no one will listen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent&quot;&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The publishers apologised for this misquotation, confirmed that it would not be repeated, and agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' on 20 February 2010, Booker wrote &quot;we shall all in due course take steps to correct the record, as I shall do in the next edition of my book&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Booker retraction&quot;&gt;
