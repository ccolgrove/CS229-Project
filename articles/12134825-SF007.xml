Although the phone bears the same model number as the 1997 [[Nokia 3110]], it was not directly derived from (and in fact has little similarity with) this model. 

The Nokia 3110 classic is a &quot;[[Bar (form)|candybar]]&quot; cameraphone which uses the [[Nokia Series 40|Series 40]] operating system and operates on [[GSM]] networks operating at 900&amp;nbsp;MHz, 1800&amp;nbsp;MHz, or 1900&amp;nbsp;MHz, supporting EDGE ([[Enhanced Data Rates for GSM Evolution]]) connections. In some regions the phone was marketed as the  Nokia 3110c, which is the same as the 3110 classic.

The phone also supports [[Bluetooth]], [[FM radio]], [[MP3]], [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] and video playback, and supports [[microSD]] cards up to 2&amp;nbsp;GB.

The phone has large buttons in its keypad which make typing [[SMS|messages]] and [[e-mails]] easy. The 1.8&quot; display supports a maximum display resolution of 128 Ã 160.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.phonearena.com/phones/Nokia-3110-Classic_id1957&lt;/ref&gt;
