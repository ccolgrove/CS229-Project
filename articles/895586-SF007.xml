[[Windows XP]] has been released in several editions since its original release in 2001.

Windows XP is available in many languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://download.microsoft.com/download/6/2/e/62e61f10-e106-4f4c-a862-63eec2b41efb/readme.htm Microsoft Windows XP Multilingual User Interface (MUI) Pack]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, add-ons translating the user interface are also available for certain languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/industry/publicsector/government/locallanguage/find-a-language.aspx?regid=_all_|title=Unlimited Potential: Local Language Program|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|accessdate=2008-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:XP-Editions.svg|thumb|280px|Diagram representing the main editions of Windows XP. It is based on the category of the edition (grey) and codebase (black arrow).]]
The first two editions released by Microsoft are Windows XP Home Edition, designed for home users, and Windows XP Professional, designed for business and power-users.

Windows XP Professional offers a number of features unavailable in the Home Edition, including:
* The ability to become part of a [[Windows Server domain]], a group of computers that are remotely managed by one or more central servers.
* An [[access control list|access control]] scheme that allows specific permissions on files to be granted to specific users under normal circumstances. However, users can use tools other than Windows Explorer (like [[cacls]] or [[File Manager (Windows)|File Manager]]), or restart to [[Safe Mode]] to modify access control lists.
* [[Terminal Services|Remote Desktop]] server, which allows a PC to be operated by another Windows XP user over a [[local area network]] or the Internet.
* Offline Files and Folders, which allow the PC to automatically store a copy of files from another networked computer and work with them while disconnected from the network.
* [[Encrypting File System]], which encrypts files stored on the computer's hard drive so they cannot be read by another user, even with physical access to the storage medium.
* Centralized administration features, including Group Policies, Automatic Software Installation and Maintenance, Roaming User Profiles, and Remote Installation Service (RIS).
* Internet Information Services (IIS), Microsoft's HTTP and FTP Server.
* Support for two physical [[central processing unit]]s (CPU). (Because the [[Multi-core (computing)|number of CPU cores]] and [[Hyper-threading]] capabilities on modern CPUs are considered to be part of a single physical processor, multicore CPUs are supported using XP Home Edition.)&lt;ref name=&quot;XP-Cores&quot;&gt;{{cite news

* Windows Management Instrumentation Console (WMIC): WMIC is a command-line tool designed to ease WMI information retrieval about a system by using simple keywords (aliases).
* The ability to switch hard disk storage type from Basic to Dynamic and vice-versa.

===Windows XP Edition N===
In March 2004, the [[European Commission]] fined Microsoft [[Euro|â¬]]497 [[million]] ([[Pound Sterling|Â£]]395 [[million]] or [[US$]]784 [[million]]) and ordered the company to provide a version of Windows without [[Windows Media Player]]. The Commission concluded that Microsoft &quot;broke [[European Union]] competition law by leveraging its near [[monopoly]] in the market for PC operating systems onto the markets for work group [[Server (computing)|server]] operating systems and for media players&quot;. After unsuccessful appeals in 2004 and 2005, Microsoft reached an agreement with the Commission where it would release a court-compliant version, Windows XP ''Edition N''. This version does not include the company's Windows Media Player but instead encourages users to pick and download their own media player. Microsoft wanted to call this version ''Reduced Media Edition'', but EU regulators objected and suggested the ''Edition N'' name, with the ''N'' signifying &quot;not with Media Player&quot;{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} for both Home and Professional editions of Windows XP. Because it is sold at the same price as the version with Windows Media Player included, [[Dell]], [[Hewlett-Packard]], [[Lenovo]] and [[Fujitsu Siemens]] have chosen not to stock the product. However, Dell did offer the operating system for a short time. Consumer interest has been low, with roughly 1,500 units shipped to [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEMs]], and no reported sales to consumers.&lt;ref name=&quot;WinXPlite&quot;&gt;{{cite news

===Windows XP K &amp; KN===
In December 2005, the [[Fair Trade Commission (South Korea)|Korean Fair Trade Commission]] ordered Microsoft to make available editions of Windows XP and [[Windows Server 2003]] that do not contain [[Windows Media Player]] or [[Windows Messenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the European Commission decision, this decision was based on the grounds that Microsoft had abused its dominant position in the market to push other products onto consumers.  Unlike that decision, however, Microsoft was also forced to withdraw the non-compliant versions of Windows from the South Korean market.

The K and KN editions of Windows XP Home Edition and Professional Edition were released in August 2006, and are only available in English and Korean.  Both editions contain links to third-party [[instant messenger]] and [[Media player (application software)|media player]] software,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Windows XP Home Edition ULCPC===
This edition of Windows XP Home is intended for sale with certain &quot;low-cost&quot; netbooks and will appear labeled as &quot;Windows XP Home Edition ULCPC&quot; (with &quot;ULCPC&quot; standing for &quot;ultra low cost personal computer&quot;).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.liliputing.com/2008/08/microsoft-starts-to-offer-windows-xp-ulpc-licenses.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Starter Edition ==
Windows XP Starter Edition is a lower-cost version of Windows XP available in Thailand, Vietnam, Turkey, Indonesia, India, Philippines, Colombia, Brazil, Argentina, Peru, Bolivia, Chile, Mexico, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela. It is similar to Windows XP Home, but is limited to low-end hardware, can only run 3 programs at a time, and has some other features either removed or disabled by default.

According to a Microsoft press release, Windows XP Starter Edition is &quot;a low-cost introduction to the Microsoft Windows XP operating system designed for first-time desktop PC users in [[developing country|developing countries]].&quot;

===Specialization===
The Starter Edition includes some special features for certain markets where consumers may not be [[Computer literacy|computer literate]]. Not found in the Home Edition, these include [[Software localisation|localised]] help features for those who may not speak English, a country-specific computer wallpaper&lt;ref name=&quot;XPStartermaterial&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[screensaver]]s, and other default settings designed for easier use than typical Windows XP installations. The Malaysian version, for example, contains a desktop background of the [[Kuala Lumpur]] skyline.

In addition, the Starter Edition also has some unique limitations to prevent it from displacing more expensive versions of Windows XP.&lt;ref name=&quot;XPStarterfacts&quot;&gt;{{cite press release

|accessdate = 2007-12-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only three applications can be run at once on the Starter Edition, and each application may open a maximum of three windows. The maximum screen resolution is  1024Ã768, and there is no support for workgroup networking or domains. In addition, the Starter Edition is licensed only for low-end processors like Intel's [[Celeron]] or AMD's [[Duron]] and [[Sempron]]. There is also a 512&amp;nbsp;MB limit on main memory and a 120&amp;nbsp;GB disk size limit.&lt;ref name=&quot;XPStarterfacts&quot; /&gt; Microsoft has not made it clear, however, if this is for total disk space, per partition, or per disk. There are also fewer options for customizing the themes, desktop, and taskbar.

===Market adoption===
On October 9, 2006, Microsoft announced&lt;ref name=&quot;MSfinancialanalystmeet&quot;&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; that they reached a milestone of 1,000,000 units of Windows XP Starter Edition sold. In the mass market, however, the Starter Edition has not had much success. In many markets where it is available, [[Copyright infringement of software|cracked or pirated versions]] of higher end versions of Windows are more popular than their legal counterparts. In these markets, cracked or pirated software such as XP Professional can be obtained at a mall. These stores typically charge you only for the amount of CDs/DVDs the software takes up, not the actual retail value. XP Professional typically costs $0.70 USD (only uses 1 CD) compared around $30 USD for a properly licensed copy of XP Starter.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.zdnet.co.uk/software/0,1000000121,39168242,00.htm&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

[[File:Windows Media Center on Windows XP.png|thumbnail|A typical Windows XP MCE 2005 Menu]]
This edition, which was code-named &quot;Freestyle&quot; during its development, was first released in September 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial release was available solely in conjunction with computers that included media center capabilities, and could not be purchased separately.  The first major update was released in 2004 and distributed by Tier 1 OEMs who had previously sold Windows XP Media Center Edition PC, and then updated again in 2005, which was the first edition available for [[System Builder]]s. Many of the features of Windows XP Media Center Edition 2005 (including screen dancers, auto playlist DJ, and high end visual screen savers) were taken from the Windows XP Plus! packages. These were originally shipped as add ons to Windows XP to enhance the users experience of their Windows XP machine.

===Releases===
A preview version of '''Windows XP Media Center Edition''' from Microsoft's eHome division, was shown as CES 2002, with the final version released later that year. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.winsupersite.com/showcase/freestyle_preview.asp Windows XP Media Center Edition (&quot;Freestyle&quot;) Preview: Paul Thurrott's SuperSite for Windows]&lt;/ref&gt;

It adds support for the [[Xbox 360]] as a media center extender, [[DVB-T]] broadcasts, and support for two [[ATSC tuner]] cards.

After the 2005 release, Microsoft focused their efforts on building new media center features into [[Windows Vista]]'s &quot;Home Premium&quot; and &quot;Ultimate&quot; editions, which, unlike the releases of Windows XP Media Center Edition, are available for retail purchase without the necessary hardware.

===Features===
The most notable feature unique to this edition is the Windows Media Center, which provides a large-font, remotely accessible interface (&quot;[[10-foot user interface]]&quot;) for [[television]] viewing on the computer as well as recording and playback, a TV guide, [[DVD]] playback, video playback, photo viewing, and music playback.  Unlike competing commercial [[digital video recorder]] products, Microsoft does not charge a monthly subscription fee for its Media Center TV guide service.

Due to strict hardware requirements, Microsoft did not sell Media Center Edition in retail markets alongside the Home and Professional editions. Microsoft only distributes it to [[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] subscribers and [[original equipment manufacturer|OEM]] [[System Builder]]s in certain countries. Consumers generally purchase Media Center preinstalled on a new computer, or from a reseller that sells OEM versions of Microsoft software.

Media Center Edition was the only consumer-oriented edition of Windows XP that was updated with new features on an annual basis during the five-year [[development of Windows Vista]].  The MCE 2005 release, for example, includes an update to [[Windows Movie Maker]] that supports burning DVDs, a new visual style called &quot;[[Royale (theme)|Royale]]&quot;, support for [[Windows Media Center Extender|Media Center Extenders]], and [[SoundSpectrum]]'s G-Force sound visualizations.  Microsoft also released its own [[remote control]], receiver and [[infrared]] blaster with MCE 2005. A new specially designed wireless [[computer keyboard]] for MCE 2005 was released September 2005.

Using [[Windows Media Center Extender|Media Center Extenders]] or the [[Xbox 360]], Media Center Edition is also able to connect and stream recorded TV, music and pictures, over a network connection.

Media Center Edition retains most of the features included in Windows XP Professional as it is simply an addon to Professional, installed when provided with a valid MCE product key during setup. All Professional features have been left in, including [[Remote Desktop]] and the [[Encrypting File System]], however the ability to join an [[Active Directory]] domain has been removed as it is marketed as a home product with no need for domain support. One value in the registry is all that is needed to circumvent this restriction;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://onetforum.com/fourm/viewtopic.php?t=7
|title=How to activate Join Domain on MCE 2005
}}&lt;/ref&gt; if the installation of MCE 2005 is an in-place upgrade from a previous version already joined to a domain, this ability is retained, unless a user uses a Windows Media Center Extender: in this case, such ability is lost and cannot be reverted back again. Presumably, Microsoft introduced this limit because Media Center Extender devices, introduced in this version, rely on the Fast User Switching component, but this component must be disabled in order to join a domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hardware requirements===
[[File:mediacenterinfo.png|thumbnail|The Software Version screen showing MCE running on an [[Intel]] [[Core 2|Core 2 Duo]] computer.]]
Media Center has higher hardware requirements than other editions of Windows XP. MCE 2005 requires at least a 1.6&amp;nbsp;GHz processor, [[DirectX]] 9.0 hardware-accelerated [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]] (ATI [[Radeon]] 9 series or nVidia [[GeForce FX Series]] or higher), and 256&amp;nbsp;MB of system [[Random-access memory|RAM]]. Some functionality, such as Media Center Extender support, use of multiple tuners, or [[High-definition television|HDTV]] playback/recording carries higher system requirements.

Media Center is much more restricted in the range of hardware that it supports than most other software [[Digital video recorder|DVR]] solutions. Media Center tuners must have a standardized driver interface, and they (originally) required a hardware [[MPEG-2]] encoder, [[closed caption]] support, and a number of other features. Media Center remote controls are standardized in terms of button labels and functionality, and, to a degree, general layout.

==Tablet PC Edition==
{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2010}}
[[File:Windows XP Tablet PC Edition Logo.jpg|thumb|right|Tablet PC logo]]
This edition is intended for specially-designed notebook/laptop computers called [[Tablet computer|tablet PC]]s. Windows XP Tablet PC Edition is compatible with a pen-sensitive screen, supporting handwritten notes and portrait-oriented screens. Initially, a retail version could not be purchased separately from a tablet PC, but in August 2004 it became universally available at no cost as part of Service Pack 2 for Windows XP. Unlike [[Windows XP Media Center Edition]] which is not available in a retail or volume license form, a volume license version was also made available.

Tablet PC Edition is a superset of Windows XP Professional, the difference being tablet functionality, including alternate text input ([[Tablet PC Input Panel]]) and basic drivers for support of tablet PC specific hardware. Requirements to install Tablet PC Edition include a tablet digitizer or touchscreen device, and hardware control buttons including a [[Control-Alt-Delete|Ctrl-Alt-Delete]] shortcut button, scrolling buttons, and at least one user-configurable application button.

There have been two releases:

* Windows XP Tablet PC Edition â The original version released in November 2002.
* Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 â The Tablet PC version released in August 2004 (codenamed ''Lonestar'') as part of Windows XP Service Pack 2.  The 2005 edition is available as a service pack upgrade, or as a new [[OEM]] version.

Service Pack 2 for Windows XP includes Tablet PC Edition 2005 and is a free upgrade. This version brought improved handwriting recognition and improved the Input Panel, allowing it to be used in almost every application. The Input Panel was also revised to extend speech recognition services (input and correction) to other applications.

===Included software===
[[File:Tablet.jpg|right|thumb|Tablet PC running Windows XP Tablet PC Edition and Energy Blue Theme]]
Windows XP Tablet PC Edition is based on Windows XP Professional and includes all the software features provided in it. In addition, it includes some of the following components:
* [[Tablet PC Input Panel]]
* [[Windows Journal]]
* Sticky Notes
* [[InkBall]]
* [[Energy Blue]] theme

The following downloadable packs released by Microsoft add more functionality:
* Microsoft Experience Pack
** Ink Art
** Ink Crossword
** Ink Desktop
** Media Transfer
** Snipping Tool 2.0

* Education Pack
** Ink Flash Cards
** Equation Writer
** GoBinder Lite
** Hexic Deluxe

===Technology===
[[File:TabletPC 2004.png|thumb|portrait|A Typical Tablet PC Screenshot, showing a docked TIP from Tablet PC Edition 2005 and [[Internet Explorer 6]]]]
Windows XP Tablet PC Edition utilizes the Ink object as a means of data input and storage. This is a data type created as part of the Windows XP Tablet PC Edition API that allows users to manipulate and process handwritten data, including recognition results and, in some cases, the pressure information for each part of the stroke. Properties of Ink can be changed in much the same way as properties of other objects, and the data can be saved to allow future reference. Many applications referencing the Ink object also allow handwritten notes to be filtered and searched through, based on the recognition results stored when Ink is saved.

Integrated with the operating system is a [[Tablet PC Input Panel]] (TIP) which allows handwriting to be converted into text for use in most non-full-screen applications. The integrated handwriting recognition in Windows XP Tablet PC Edition 2005 can recognize print, cursive, or mixed writing. Accuracy can be increased by configuring the recognizer to expect left-handed writing or right-handed writing. Recognition in a variety of languages is available with the install of a [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=080184dd-5e92-4464-b907-10762e9f918b&amp;DisplayLang=en recognizer pack]. The handwriting engine cannot be trained to recognize a particular handwriting style, so the user must modify their handwriting to be better recognized by the system in order to use this feature effectively.

Speech recognition functionality is also incorporated into the Tablet Input Panel. Compared to previous versions, a substantially improved speech recognition engine version 6 (which also ships with Office 2003) and a tutorial, microphone wizard and training modules are included. It is possible to dictate text using speech in certain supported applications and control the Windows GUI and applications using speech, although the accuracy improvements further made in Windows Vista surpass these features. An update for Windows XP Tablet PC Edition containing Ink Analysis and StylusInput API support introduced in Windows Vista is also available.

==Subscription and pre-paid editions==
In 2006, Microsoft made available two additional editions of Windows XP Home Edition for hardware manufacturers that wanted to provide subscription-based or [[pay as you go]]-based{{Clarify|post-text=Link to correct article|Reason=&quot;Pay as you go&quot; is a disambiguation page. Please change this wikilink to a link to correct article. I'd have done it myself if I knew what is &quot;pay as you go&quot;.|date=July 2010}} models for selling computers. These editions, named Windows XP Home Edition for Subscription Computers, and Windows XP Home Edition for Prepaid Computers respectively, are part of the &quot;[[Microsoft FlexGo]]&quot; initiative, described in a company-issued press release as, &quot;[making] PCs more accessible by dramatically reducing the entry cost and enabling customers to pay for their computer as they use it, through the purchase of prepaid cards. Market trials are starting first in emerging markets where inadequate access to consumer credit, unpredictable income and high entry costs prevent many consumers from purchasing a computer.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These editions were targeted towards emerging markets such as India, Brazil, Hungary and Vietnam.

Both editions contain additional components that enforce the subscription models via metering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|publisher=Microsoft
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The metering is typically enforced with a hardware component to prevent tampering.  The installation of Windows operates in &quot;normal mode&quot;, &quot;Limited Access Mode&quot;, or &quot;Hardware Locked Mode&quot; depending on the state of the subscription.  When a computer has a positive time balance, it operates in &quot;normal mode&quot; and functions as a regular Windows XP Home Edition machine.  When the time balance expires, the machine will then operate in &quot;Limited Access Mode&quot; for an amount of time set by the hardware manufacturer (five hours by default) before entering &quot;Hardware Locked Mode&quot;.  In Limited Access Mode, the screen uses high-contrast and low-resolution display settings, and in Hardware Locked Mode, the operating system is disabled entirely, and a message is displayed on boot-up with instructions on how to re-enable the machine.

==64-bit editions==
Two distinct editions of Windows XP were released to support 64-bit hardware.

===Windows XP 64-Bit Edition===
Windows XP 64-Bit Edition was designed to run on [[Intel]] [[Itanium]] family of [[microprocessor]]s in their native [[IA-64]] mode. 

Two versions of Windows XP 64-Bit Edition were released:
* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for Itanium systems, Version 2002 â Based on Windows XP [[codebase]], was released simultaneously alongside the 32-Bit version of Windows XP on October 25, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* Windows XP 64-Bit Edition, Version 2003 â Based on [[Windows Server 2003]] codebase, which added support for the [[Itanium 2]] processor, was released on March 28, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of July 2005, Windows XP 64-Bit Edition is no longer supported, and no further security updates were made available.

Windows XP 64-Bit Edition was not marketed as the Itanium version of Microsoft's other Windows XP editions but was a separate edition made solely for the Itanium processor and its 64-bit instructions. It is mostly analogous to Windows XP Professional, but numerous older technologies such as DAO, [[Microsoft Jet Database Engine|Jet database]], [[NTVDM]] and [[Windows on Windows]] are no longer present so support for [[MS-DOS]] and [[Win16]] applications is absent. The original version also lacks most media applications such as [[Windows Media Player]], [[NetMeeting]], [[Windows Movie Maker]], and integrated CD burning, although WMP and NetMeeting were added in the 2003 version.

Similar to the ability of previous alternate architecture ports of Windows ([[Windows NT 4.0]] for [[PowerPC]], [[MIPS architecture|MIPS]] R4x00, and [[Alpha processor|Alpha]]) to run 16-bit x86 code via [[Windows on Windows]], Windows XP 64-Bit Edition can run standard x86 [[32-bit]] applications through its [[WOW64]] (Windows-on-Windows 64-bit) [[emulation]] layer. While the original Itanium processor contains an on-chip [[IA-32]] decoder, it was deemed far too slow for serious use (running at about 400&amp;nbsp;MHz), so Microsoft and Intel wrote a software 32 to 64-bit translator dubbed the [[IA-32 Execution Layer]]. It allows real time translation of x86 32-bit instructions into [[IA-64]] instructions, allowing 32-bit applications to run (albeit significantly more slowly than native code).

===Windows XP Professional x64 Edition===
{{Main|Windows XP Professional x64 Edition}}
This edition supports the [[x86-64]] extension of the Intel IA-32 architecture. x86-64 is implemented by AMD as &quot;AMD64&quot;, found in AMD's [[Opteron]], [[Athlon 64]] chips (and in select [[Sempron]] processors), and implemented by Intel as &quot;Intel 64&quot; (formerly known as IA-32e and EM64T), found in some of Intel's [[Pentium 4]] and most of Intel's later chips.  It was released on April 25, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses version 5.2.3790.1830 of core operating system binaries,&lt;ref name=&quot;support-XPx64&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url   = http://support.microsoft.com/kb/888733|title = A description of the x64-based versions of Windows Server 2003 and of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition|date = October 11, 2007|accessdate=2008-09-15|publisher = [[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same version used by [[Windows Server 2003]] SP1 as they were the latest versions during the operating system's development. Even service packs and updates for Windows XP x64 and Windows Server 2003 x64 are distributed in unified packages,&lt;ref name=&quot;x64hotfix&quot;&gt;Typically, a security update for English-language x64 Editions of Server 2003 and XP Professional is named  ''WindowsServer2003.WindowsXP-KBnnnnnn-SP2-x64-ENU.exe'' or ''WindowsServer2003.WindowsXP-KBnnnnnnn-x64-ENU.exe'',&lt;/ref&gt;  much in the manner as Windows 2000 Professional and Server editions for x86.

During the initial development phases (2003â2004), Windows XP Professional x64 Edition was named ''Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for x86 Extended Systems'' and later, ''Windows XP 64-Bit Edition for Extended Systems'', as opposed to ''64-Bit Edition for Itanium Systems''.

====Known issues====
{{Update|date=October 2011}}
There are some common issues that arise with Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.

* Driver compatibility; Only 64-bit kernel mode drivers are supported. This means that devices for which there are no 64-bit Windows XP drivers available cannot be used.  This includes a lot of common hardware; such as CD drives, DVD drives and USB.  The amount of unsupported hardware has fallen because of the proliferation of x64 Vista and x64 Windows 7.
* Any 32-bit [[Windows Explorer]] extension fails to work with 64-bit Windows Explorer. Explorer is a 64-bit program, so it cannot load a 32-bit DLL. However, Windows XP x64 Edition also ships with the 32-bit explorer.exe, which can be used as the user's default shell with a registry change.
* 16-bit programs will not run because of Microsoft's removal of the 16-bit subsystem.  As some 32-bit software has been delivered with 16-bit installers, these software will not install.
* Command prompts will not load in full-screen. This is also true of [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]] in both 32- and 64-bit editions.
* Does not contain a Web Extender Client component for Web Folders (WebDAV).
* Some installers refuse to install to anything other than 32-bit XP, even though the product runs perfectly on x64.

====Service Packs====
Service Pack 2 (SP2) for Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Professional x64 Editions was released on March 12, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/windowsserver/bb229701.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2008, Microsoft does not plan to release any further service packs for Windows Server 2003 and consequently, for Windows XP Professional x64 Edition.&lt;ref name=&quot;softpedia-64bitxp&quot;&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;SProadmap&quot;&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.microsoft.com/windows/lifecycle/servicepacks.mspx | title=Windows Service Pack Road Map | date=2008-10-07 | accessdate=2008-10-13 | publisher=Microsoft }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service Packs for 32-bit (x86) editions  of Windows XP are not compatible with Windows XP x64 Edition. Features introduced by Service Pack 2 for Windows XP were already present in the RTM version of Windows XP Professional x64 Edition, which identifies itself as &quot;Service Pack 1&quot; akin to the Server edition. As of mid 2010 Service Pack 3 was made available for 32-bit systems.

===Software compatibility===
Windows XP Professional x64 Edition uses a technology named [[WOW64|Windows-on-Windows 64-bit]] (WOW64), which permits the execution of 32-bit [[x86]] applications.  It was first employed in [[#Windows XP 64-Bit Edition|Windows XP 64-Bit Edition]] (for the [[Itanium]]), but then reused for the âx64 Editionsâ of Windows XP and Windows Server 2003.

Since the [[x86-64]] architecture includes hardware-level support for 32-bit instructions, WOW64 switches the process between 32- and 64-bit modes.  As a result, X86-64 architecture microprocessors incur no performance loss when executing 32-bit Windows applications.  All 32-bit processes are shown with ''*32'' in the task manager, while 64-bit processes have no extra text present.

Although 32-bit applications can be run transparently, the mixing of the two types of code within the same process is not allowed. A 64-bit application cannot link against a 32-bit [[Library (computer science)|library]] ([[Dynamic-link library|DLL]]) and similarly a 32-bit application cannot link against a 64-bit library. This may lead to the need for library developers to provide both 32- and 64-bit binary versions of their libraries.  Windows XP x64 Edition includes both 32- and 64-bit versions of [[Internet Explorer 6]], in order to allow for the possibility that some third-party browser plugins or [[ActiveX]] controls may not yet be available in 64-bit versions. 

Older 32-bit drivers and services are not supported by 64-bit Windows, but video and audio [[codec]]s such as [[XviD]] or [[OggDS]] (which are 32-bit [[Dynamic-link library|DLLs]]), are supported as long as the media player that uses them is 32-bit as well.

64-bit Windows does not include [[NTVDM]] or [[Windows on Windows]], so there is no native support for the execution of [[MS-DOS]] or [[16-bit]] Windows applications, such as those written for [[Windows 3.1]].

===Advantages===
The primary benefit of moving to 64-bit is the increase in the maximum allocatable [[virtual memory]]. A single standard process on a 32-bit Windows operating system is limited to a total of 2,093,056 [[kilobyte]]s (2&amp;nbsp;GB minus one 4&amp;nbsp;KB page), while large address aware &lt;ref name=&quot;VSdocLAA&quot;&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/wz223b1z(VS.80).aspx
|title= /LARGEADDRESSAWARE (Handle Large Addresses)
|quote=The /LARGEADDRESSAWARE option tells the linker that the application can handle addresses larger than 2&amp;nbsp;gigabytes.
|work=Visual Studio 2005 Documentation - Visual C++ - Linker Options
|publisher=Microsoft 
|accessdate=2010-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; 32-bit processes can allocate up to 4&amp;nbsp;GB. Windows XP x64 can support much more memory; although the theoretical memory limit a 64-bit computer can address is about 16&amp;nbsp;[[exabyte]]s, Windows XP x64 is limited to 128&amp;nbsp;GB of physical memory and 8&amp;nbsp;[[terabyte]]s of [[virtual memory]] per process while the practical limit is usually the size of the pagefile.

Windows XP Professional x64 Edition and Windows XP 64-bit Edition Version 2003 are the only releases of Windows XP to include [[Internet Information Services]] 6.0, which matches the version shipped with [[Windows Server 2003]]; other versions of XP include 5.1.

64-bit versions of Windows XP are also immune to certain types of viruses and [[malware]] that target 32-bit systems, since most system files are 64-bit. Although, most of this is due to the newness of 64-bit, viruses just need to be updated to support the newer platform.

The extra registers of the x86-64 architecture can result in performance improvements in certain kinds of applications, but more often than not, will result in a slight decrease in performance when compared to the same application implemented in 32 bit x86 code running on Windows XP 32 bit editions.

==Editions for embedded systems==
{{See also|Windows Embedded}}
Microsoft has released three editions of Windows XP that are targeted towards developers of embedded devices, for use in specific consumer electronics, [[set-top box]]es, kiosks/[[Automatic teller machine|ATMs]], medical devices, arcade video games, point-of-sale terminals, and Voice over Internet Protocol ([[Voice over IP|VoIP]]) components.&lt;ref name=&quot;whichembedded&quot;&gt;{{cite web

===Windows XP for Embedded Systems===
Windows XP for Embedded Systems is an edition of Windows XP that contains the full feature set of Windows XP Professional, but has restrictions on licensing that require the resulting device to boot directly into the [[original equipment manufacturer]]'s application.

As of April 2008, this edition is marketed as part of the &quot;Windows Embedded Enterprise&quot; brand, which includes both this release and its successor, [[Windows Vista Embedded|Windows Vista for Embedded Systems]].

===Windows XP Embedded===
[[File:XPe demo.png|thumb|Screenshot of Windows XP Embedded Evaluation running several Windows components.]]
Windows XP Embedded, commonly abbreviated &quot;XPe&quot;, is a componentized version of the Professional edition of Windows XP. An [[original equipment manufacturer]] is free to choose only the components needed thereby reducing operating system footprint and also reducing attack area as compared with XP Professional.  Unlike [[Windows CE]], Microsoft's operating system for portable devices and consumer electronics, XP Embedded provides the full [[Windows API]], and support for the full range of applications and device drivers written for Microsoft Windows.  The system requirements state that XPe can run on devices with at least 32&amp;nbsp;MB [[Compact Flash]], 32&amp;nbsp;MB RAM and a P-200 [[microprocessor]].  XPe was released on November 28, 2001. As of October 2008, the newest release is Windows XP Embedded Service Pack 3.

The devices targeted for XPe have included [[automatic teller machine]]s, [[arcade games]], [[slot machines]], [[cash register]]s, [[industry|industrial]] [[robotics]], [[thin client]]s, [[set-top box]]es, [[network attached storage]] (NAS), [[time clock]]s, navigation devices, railroad locomotives, etc.&lt;ref name=&quot;whichembedded&quot; /&gt; Custom versions of the OS can be deployed onto anything but a full-fledged PC; even though XPe supports the same hardware that XP Professional supports ([[x86]] architecture), licensing restrictions prevent it from being deployed on to standard PCs. However, Microsoft has made some exceptions to this rule, allowing XPe alongside a standard OEM install of Windows. Some Dell notebooks contain an embedded XP installation as part of the [[Dell MediaDirect|MediaDirect]] 2.0 feature, and they were also found on some Acer ones as well as the Samsung Q1.

[[Windows Embedded#Windows Embedded Standard|Windows Embedded Standard 2009]] succeeded XPe in 2H 2008. Windows Embedded Standard 2009 is derived from Windows XP Embedded since Microsoft at the time of its development did not have a componentized version of Windows Vista.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/apr08/04-15RoadMapEmbeddedPR.mspx Microsoft Charts Its Road Map for Windows Embedded Business]&lt;/ref&gt; Windows Embedded Standard 2009 includes [[Silverlight]], [[.NET Framework#.NET Framework 3.5|.NET Framework 3.5]], [[Internet Explorer 7]], [[Windows Media Player 11]], [[Remote Desktop Protocol|RDP 6.1]], [[Network Access Protection]], [[Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer]] and support for being managed by [[Windows Server Update Services]] and [[System Center Configuration Manager]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/2008/jun08/06-04EmbeddedStandard2009PR.mspx Microsoft Press Release on Windows Embedded Standard 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Windows Embedded#Windows Embedded Standard 7|Windows Embedded Standard 7]] has succeeded Windows Embedded 2009 in April 2010 and is a componentized version of Windows 7.

====Features====
[[File:Payphone loading Microsoft Windows XP.jpg|thumb|A [[BT Group|BT]] Internet payphone loading [[Windows XP]] Embedded.]]
;Componentized OS
:Write Filters
:XPe includes feature components known as write filters, which can be used to filter out disk writes. The volumes can be marked as read-only using these filters and all writes to it can be redirected. Applications in user mode are unaware of this write filtering. XPe ships with two write filters:
:;[[Enhanced Write Filter]] (EWF)
::EWF protects a system at volume level. It redirects all disk writes to a protected drive, to RAM or a separate disk. EWF is extremely useful when used in Thin Clients that have flash memory as their primary boot source.
:;File Based Write Filter (FBWF)
::FBWF allows the configuration of individual files as read/write on a protected volume.
;USB Boot
:XPe adds a USB boot option to Windows. An XPe embedded device can be configured to boot from a USB drive.
;CD Boot
:An XPe device can be configured to boot from a [[CD-ROM]].  This allows the device to boot without the requirement of having a physical [[hard disk drive]] as well as provides a &quot;fresh boot&quot; every time the image is booted (a property inherited by the fact that the operating system is being booted from read-only media). One drawback to this technology is updating or servicing the image requires the complete process of setting up the runtime image to be completed once again from start to end.
;Network Boot
:An XPe device can be configured to boot from a properly configured network. Synonymous to CD Boot, Network Boot removes the requirement of having the physical hard drive as well as providing the &quot;fresh boot&quot; behavior. One bonus to Network Boot though is the ability to service the already setup image. Once the image is updated the image is simply posted to the [[Remote Installation Services|RIS Server]] and once clients are rebooted they will receive the updated image.
