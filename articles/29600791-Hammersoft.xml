==History==
The University of Montana College of Technology was previously known as the Missoula Vocational Technical Center until it became affiliated with the University of Montana in the Fall of 1994. The name change was a sign of the school's expanding responsibilities as it became part of the University while still providing a wide variety of professional and technical programs.&lt;ref&gt;Report Card from the Office of the President, The University of Montana to Commissioner of Higher Education, December 1994&lt;/ref&gt; The school was governed by Missoula County High Schools until July 1989, when the Montana Board of Regents took over that responsibility.&lt;ref name=&quot;COT Quick Facts&quot;&gt;http://mus.edu/twoyear/QuickFacts.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
