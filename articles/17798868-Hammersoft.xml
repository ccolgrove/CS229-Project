'''Eugene Turner''' (November 26, 1920 â January 14, 2010)&lt;ref name=usfsaobit&gt;&quot;U.S. Hall of Fame Member Eugene Turner Passes Away&quot;, U.S. Figure Skating (website)[http://www.usfigureskating.org/Story.asp?id=44085&amp;type=media]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[United States|American]] champion [[figure skater]] who competed in [[single skating]], [[pair skating]] and [[ice dancing]], and coached professionally. He was born in [[Los Angeles]], California.

Turner won the mens singles title at the 1940 and 1941 [[United States Figure Skating Championships]].  Also in 1941, he became the first skater to medal in three disciplines at one U.S. Championship, adding the pairs title with [[Donna Atwood]] and the silver medal in ice dancing with [[Elizabeth Kennedy (figure skater)|Elizabeth Kennedy]].  Hailing from the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club, he was the first skater from west of the Mississippi River to win a U.S. senior title.

Turner did not appear in the Winter Olympics or World Championships which were subject to international cancellation from 1940 to 1946 due to [[World War II]] and post-war rebuilding.  During the war, Turner served as a lieutenant in the [[U.S. Army Air Forces]], piloting a single seat [[P-47 Thunderbolt]] for 69 missions over Germany and occupied France.  After the war, he became a coach and skated professionally.&lt;ref name=lafschist&gt;[http://www.lafsc.org/history(1).htm &quot;History of the Los Angeles Figure Skating Club&quot;], by [[Virginia Vale]], club newsletter, 1982 (from LAFSC website)&lt;/ref&gt;  

Turner partnered with [[Sonja Henie]] during her tour and in [[Iceland (film)]] in 1942. He also performed as a [[body double|skating double]] for [[Cary Grant]] in [[The Bishop's Wife]] in 1948, and for [[Patrick Knowles]].

As a coach, he taught or set programs for [[Allen Schramm]], [[Dudley Richards]], [[Karol Kennedy]], [[Peter Kennedy (figure skater)|Peter Kennedy]], [[Catherine Machado]], [[Richard Dwyer]], [[Tim Brown (figure skater)|Tim Brown]], and [[Tenley Albright]].&lt;ref name=usfsaobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=lafschist/&gt;  Skating magazine carried his columns in the 1980s&lt;ref name=lafschist/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellyn Kestnbaum (2003).
