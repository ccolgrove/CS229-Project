A '''mobile Internet device''' ('''MID''') is a [[multimedia]]-capable [[mobile device]] providing [[wireless networking|wireless]] [[Internet]] access.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mobile Internet Devices (MID) &amp; Chip Market Opportunities |author=Forward Concepts |month=June |year=2008 |url=http://www.fwdconcepts.com/MID8.htm |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mobile Internet Device (MID) |work=www.arm.com |url=http://www.arm.com/markets/mid/ |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Wireless Handset Solutions: Mobile Internet Device |work=focus.ti.com|url=http://focus.ti.com/general/docs/wtbu/wtbuproductcontent.tsp?templateId=6123&amp;navigationId=12795&amp;contentId=36404 |accessdate=2008-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are designed to provide entertainment, information and [[location-based service]]s for personal use, rather than for corporate use. They allow 2-way communication and real-time sharing. An MID is larger than a [[smartphone]] but smaller than an [[Ultra-Mobile PC]] (UMPC).{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} They have been described as filling a niche between smartphones and [[Tablet computer|Tablet PC]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=What is a Mobile Internet Device? |month=November |year=2008 |url=http://searchmobilecomputing.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid40_gci1262250,00.html |accessdate=2008-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are an easy way to stay in contact with others wirelessly.

==Archos internet tablets==
The class of mobile internet tablets from Archos has included multiple operating systems: Windows CE, Android, and Windows 7. The form factor is very similar to the Lenovo image on the right. The Android tablet uses an [[ARM Cortex]] CPU and a [[touchscreen]].

==Intel MID platforms==

Intel announced a prototype MID at the [[Intel Developer Forum]] in Spring 2007 in [[Beijing]].  A MID development kit by Sophia Systems using Intel Centrino Atom was announced in April 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=MID dev kit sports Centrino Atom chipset |url=http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS4807155541.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Intel MID platforms are based on an Intel processor and chipset which consume less power than most of the x86 derivatives. A few platforms have been announced as listed below:

===McCaslin platform (2007)===
Intel's first generation MID platform (codenamed '''McCaslin''') contains a 90&amp;nbsp;nm Intel A100/A110 processor (codenamed '''Stealey''') which runs at 600â800&amp;nbsp;MHz.

===Menlow platform (2008)===
On 2 March 2008, Intel introduced the [[Intel Atom]] processor brand&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Intel Announces Intel Atom Brand for New Family of Low-Power Processors |url=http://www.intel.com/pressroom/archive/releases/20080302comp.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; for a new family of low-power processor platforms. The components have thin, small designs and work together to &quot;enable the best mobile computing and Internet experience&quot; on mobile and low-power devices.

Intel's second generation MID platform (codenamed '''[[Menlow]]''') contains a 45&amp;nbsp;nm Intel Atom processor (codenamed '''[[Silverthorne]]''') which can run up to 2.0&amp;nbsp;GHz and a System Controller Hub (codenamed '''[[Poulsbo]]''') which includes [[Intel HD Audio]] (codenamed '''[[HD Audio|Azalia]]'''). This platform was initially branded as [[Centrino]] Atom but such practice was discontinued in Q3 2008.

===Moorestown platform (2009)===
Intel's third generation MID platform (codenamed '''[[Moorestown (computing platform)|Moorestown]]''') contains a 45&amp;nbsp;nm [[Intel Atom]] processor (codenamed '''[[Lincroft]]''') and a 65&amp;nbsp;nm Platform Controller Hub (codenamed '''[[Langwell]]'''). Since the memory controller and graphics controller are all now integrated into the processor, the [[northbridge (computing)|northbridge]] has been removed and the processor communicates directly with the [[southbridge (computing)|southbridge]] via the [[Direct Media Interface|DMI]] bus interface.

===Medfield platform (2011)===
Intel's fourth generation MID platform (codename '''Medfield''') contains a 32&amp;nbsp;nm [[Intel Atom]] processor.

===Operating system===

Intel announced collaboration with [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] to create Ubuntu for mobile internet devices distribution, known as [[Ubuntu Mobile]]. Ubuntu's website says the new distribution &quot;will provide a rich Internet experience for users of Intelâs 2008 Mobile Internet Device (MID) platform.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Canonical Announces Details of Ubuntu for Mobile Internet Devices |date=2007-06-07 |url=http://www.ubuntu.com/news/ubuntu-for-mobile-internet-devices |accessdate=2007-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another MID Open Source Linux distribution is [[Moblin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=Mobile Internet Devices (MIDs) |url=MID Open Source Linux |accessdate=2010-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had been merged into the new [[MeeGo]] project that has been merged with [[LiMo]] into [[Tizen]] project.
