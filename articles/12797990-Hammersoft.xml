Power commented &quot;It was all I could do to stop myself screeching down the phone. They didn't tell me which direction the story was going to take. I got on so well with [Bill Treacher] from the word go. We really liked each other.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;stepping&quot;/&gt; Mrs Hewitt was reintroduced in a storyline that saw her become Arthur Fowler's [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]], but when the affair ended Power left the series, making her final appearance on-screen in October 1993.&lt;ref name=&quot;stepping&quot;/&gt;

'''Anne Howes''' met [[Phil Mitchell]] while he was on a stag night in a curry house. Phil brought her back to his home at the [[Queen Vic]] and they slept together. A romance was quick to develop, but Anne turned out to be a habitual liar. She refused to give Phil her home telephone number or allow him back to her house and when Phil questioned her on this, she became defensive and hostile. By this time Phil had fallen for her, so he persevered, but he began to grow suspicious when he spotted her arguing with a strange man in the middle of Bridge Street market. Anne claimed that the man was merely an ex-boyfriend, but when Phil confronted him he was told that Anne was his wife and a serial adulterer.

Phil was angered by her dishonesty, but Anne claimed that her marriage was over, which her husband, Terry, refused to accept. She portrayed Terry as suicidal and needy and promised that her feelings for Phil were genuine. Phil eventually accepted her explanation and confessed to loving her, but Anne remained uncertain about leaving her husband, fearing that he would kill himself if she did. After days of ignoring Phil, Anne agreed to discuss their relationship over dinner, but she turned up to the restaurant late, claiming that her husband had locked her in their bedroom. Terry followed them there and was shocked to discover that Anne had claimed he was suicidal, dismissing this as one of her lies. He pleaded with Phil to finish with Anne for the sake of their young daughterâanother secret that Anne had been keeping. Phil ended the affair after realising that Anne had been lying to him all along.

==Mandy Salter==
{{Main|Mandy Salter}}
'''Mandy Salter''' is played by [[Nicola Stapleton]]. Introduced on 12 March 1992, Mandy was portrayed as a teenage tearaway. She was featured in storylines about homelessness, child and drug abuse. Her relationship with [[Aidan Brosnan]] was one of the prominent storylines featured in 1993. Due to the character's devious behaviour, it has been suggested that Mandy was one of the most hated characters on television during her tenure.Mandy was one of several introductions to the cast of ''EastEnders'' in 1992. Executive producer [[Leonard Lewis]] took a tentative approach to introducing new characters in 1992. Most were introduced gradually, making an initial appearance and then joining the programme full-time a couple of months later.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders books#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the producers and writers to create new characters and see them brought to life by the actors before committing them to a longer contract.&lt;ref name=&quot;first10years&quot;/&gt; Mandy first appeared in March 1992 as a school girl aged 15, abandoned by her mother in Pat Butcher's care. She left the series temporarily a few weeks later; in the storyline she went back to her mother's flat, but she returned by the summer of 1992 as a regular character, squatting in the soap's setting of [[Albert Square]].Stapleton quit the role and Mandy departed on-screen on 13 January 1994. Stapleton claims that she has been asked to reprise the role in the past, and although she turned these offers down, in 2009 she stated the door has been left open for Mandy to return. In June 2011, it was confirmed that Stapleton was to reprise her role as Mandy and she reappeared from  29 August 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;29aug&quot;&gt;{{Cite episode |title= Episode dated 29/08/2011 |http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0141vbt |series= EastEnders |serieslink=EastEnders |credits= Director: Lee Salisbury; Executive Producer: Bryan Kirkwood; Writer: Wendy Granditer |network=[[BBC]] |station=[[BBC One]] |city= |airdate=29 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nigel Bates''' was played by [[Paul Bradley (actor)|Paul Bradley]] from 1992 to 1998. Introduced in 1992 by [[Leonard Lewis]], the character was incorporated gradually and brought back as a regular following a brief stint due to a popular reception.

The door was left open for a possible future return. Nigel was one of several introductions occurring in 1992.

Furious, Phil went to warn him off, but Terry stunned him by revealing that he and Anne were actually married. 

Anne convinced Phil that her marriage was over, but she was unable to leave Terry as he had threatened to kill himself if she did. When Phil confronted Terry with this, he discovered that Anne had been lyingâshe'd had numerous affairs in the past, but always came back to him in the end. Terry then shocked Phil by telling him that he and Anne had a young daughter. He begged him to end the affair for her sake. Phil did so after realising that Anne had been lying all along.

The adjoining property, 18 Albert Square, was also owned by Frankâused as the Butcher family residence. Frank intended to keep this property, but Raymond told him that he was only interested in buying both. Frank was against this, even though Charles offered to purchase at market price and pay the estate agent's fee. Later that day, Frank was contacted by his financial advisor, [[Christine Pretis]], who informed him that his tax demand was far greater than the original estimate. Frank had no choice but to sell the two properties to Charles and move his family to a small flat elsewhere on the Square.

'''Jonathan Hewitt''' was the layabout son of [[Christine Hewitt]] â who employed [[Arthur Fowler]] to tend to her garden. Jonathan had been unemployed for a while after dropping out of college, and when Christine saw Arthur advertising for a gardening assistant she approached him and recommended Jonathan for the post. Arthur agreed and he and Jonathan spent several weeks tending to gardens in Albert Square. 

Arthur's love for plants rubbed off on Jonathan, and he seemed extremely keen on the job, even helping Arthur sell his plants at the [[May Day]] fÃªte on the Square. However as the weeks went by Jonathan started to shirk his responsibilities, leaving work early and then failing to show up at all. After a few days of absence, Arthur contacted Christine to complain. According to Christine, Jonathan had left London to attend a festival in [[Scotland]] with his [[hippy]] friends. Christine took over the job in his place, which was the precursor to her affair with Arthur. Jonathan never appeared again, but in March 1993 Christine visited him in Scotland because he had suffered an injury. 

The role of Jonathan Hewitt was one of the first notable acting credits for [[Jonny Lee Miller]], who went on to find greater fame as a film actor. Miller has since commented on his stint in ''EastEnders'': &quot;It was five weeks' work and I made more money there than I ever had in my life. Then they offered me a year's contract. I said no, thank God. I thought I should get out of there while I still could. No offence to ''EastEnders''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.jonnyleemiller.co.uk/timesint.html |title= JONNY LEE MILLER INTERVIEW|publisher=''Jonnyleemiller.co.uk''| accessdate=24 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Andonis Papadopolous''' known commonly as '''Mr. Papadopolous''', is the owner of the launderette on Bridge Street.&lt;ref name=&quot;papa&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url= http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/review/0,,1292394,00.html |title= It'll all come out in the wash |publisher=''[[The Guardian]]''  | date = 27 August 2004| accessdate=24 September 2007 | location=London | first=Nancy | last=Banks-Smith}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a long-running joke, employee [[Dot Branning]] has difficulty pronouncing his surname, and for much of the show's history he has been referred to as Mr. Oppodopolus, Oppydoppy, Olopolopous or varying other mispronunciations; some of which are used by other characters, including [[Yolande Trueman]] who called him Mr. P.

Andonis was not the original owner of the launderette. From the show's inception until May 1992 the property was owned by his father, until he died while holidaying in his native [[Athens]]. The character is of [[Greece|Greek]] descent, but the Papadopouloses were apparently based in [[Walthamstow]], East London. 

Despite being referred to regularly throughout the entire serial, the Papadopolouses have not been seen often on-screen. Andonis made his first appearance in May 1992, when he came to Walford to assess the business following his father's death. Dot noticed him taking a keen interest in the launderette and feared he was a murderer. She spent several days in a terrified state until Andonis made a formal introduction the following episode, revealing his first name. He made several alterations to the way the business was managed, much to Dot's dismay.

Over the next two years he showed up in Walford occasionally. He was featured in the programme's 1,000th episode on 12 July 1994, where he discovered that his employee, [[Carol Jackson]], was faking an illness in order to get out of work. Carol was actually attending the wedding of [[Nigel Bates|Nigel]] and [[Debbie Bates]], which Andonis witnessed. The following day he fired Carol as well as long-time employee, [[Pauline Fowler]], who had been covering up for her. He employed a relative to work in their place, but the launderette fell into chaos, so both were eventually offered their jobs back. Pauline made him grovel before accepting and managed to get a 75 pence per hour payrise. This was Mr. Papadopolous' last credited appearance to date, though he is still mentioned often in the programme.

He returned on 10 August 2009, although his face was not seen on screen, he did not speak and he was not named in the credits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisnottingham.co.uk/entertainmentnews/Catch-week-s-Corrie-Eastenders/article-1245769-detail/article.html|title=Catch up on this week's Corrie and Eastenders|work=This is Nottingham|date=14 August 2009|accessdate=16 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived at the launderette looking for Dot, and later found her at her house, giving her a parcel.

Adrian spent several days mending the furniture, though Sharon found his presence an irritation, as he made loud noises and took up room in her bar. She was pleased with the job he did in the end, and was more than happy with his reasonable fee. [[Frank Butcher]] also tried to employ Adrian to instil a cab office for his wifeâs cab firm in Bridge Street cafÃ©. He wanted to relocate the office from its current location at the car lot, where he worked. When Frank's wife [[Pat Butcher|Pat]] found out, she forbade Frank from going ahead with the plan.

The following episode, Sean and his mother came in search of Rachel, and found her at the Queen Vic pub. They wanted her to give the reel back. When Rachel said that she had sold it, Sean became angry, and accused her of stealing from his poor bereaved mother. He demanded that Rachel split her profits with them. He then pulled out a flyer advertising the same fishing reel for the price of Â£7,000, and he refused to believe that Rachel had sold it for a mere Â£150. He threatened to sue her, and when he became loud and aggressive, landlord Grant Mitchell threw him out of the pub.

'''Lilian Kominski''' was the mother of [[Rachel Kominski]]. She came to stay with Rachel unexpectedly following a row with her husband, Joseph, and she refused to return home until her husband begged her to. Lilian was an interfering, judgemental and critical person, who constantly upset and embarrassed Rachel in front of her friends. She jibed Rachel for not dressing attractively or having a husband; criticised her lifestyle; meddled in her blossoming relationship with [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]]; frowned upon Rachel's lodger, Michelle Fowler, for having an interracial relationship with [[Clyde Tavernier]]; and told anyone who cared to listen about how badly Rachel treated her and how much she had sacrificed for her. Rachel found her presence highly stressful, but whenever she confronted her mother, Lilian got upset, so Rachel was forced to backtrack in order to spare her feelings. 

Lilian began dropping hints about Rachel's past in passing conversations to her friends, indicating that she had always been forced to clear up Rachel's many mistakes. She depicted Rachel as a troubled and depressed child, and seemed keen to divulge the reasons why. Rachel was furious when Michelle told her that Lilian had been dropping hints about her secret past. She went to confront her mother and it transpired that Rachel had fallen pregnant at 14, and Lilian had forced her to have an abortion, which left her depressed for a long while after. Rachel told her mother that she resented her for forcing her into an abortion. This upset Lilian and she told Rachel that it broke her heart to lose her first and perhaps only grandchild, but there was no other option. Rachel feared that Lilian would divulge her secret if she stayed in Walford, so she ordered her mother to go back to her father. Lilian left the following day after making peace with Rachel.

}}
'''Shelley Lewis''', played by [[Nicole Arumugam]], was a [[college]] friend of [[Michelle Fowler]]'s and was first seen in November 1992. When Michelle's housemate, [[Rachel Kominski]], left [[Walford]] early in 1993, Shelley moved in with Michelle and her daughter [[Vicki Fowler|Vicki]] at 55 Victoria Road. She later got a job as part-time barmaid in [[The Queen Vic]] and was often seen hanging around with her other student pals Rich and Clem (her on/off boyfriend), which caused problems with Michelle when they were caught smoking [[cannabis]] in front of Vicki. 

Shelley initially set her sights on Michelle's brother, [[Mark Fowler]]. Both appeared smitten with each other, but Mark was harbouring a secret - he was [[HIV positive]]. Seeing them growing closer, Michelle told Mark that he had to cool things with Shelley or tell her the truth. Mark then decided that it was best that they just remain friends. 

Shelley was a bit of a user and after her brief fling with Mark ended she set her sights on local sleaze, [[Richard Cole (EastEnders)|Richard Cole]], thinking he'd be a good 'meal ticket'. Richard was happy to lavish Shelley with expensive gifts in the hope that they would coax her into bed. Shelley was happy to take the gifts, but when Richard began to seek a return from his investments, Shelley abruptly told him that she 'wouldn't touch him with a bargepole'.

Shelley was still attracted to Mark and later initiated a kiss, reigniting their romance. In November that year, they (along with Michelle and Clem) went on a trip to [[Amsterdam]]. Shelley was still dating Clem at the time, so she and Mark would sneak away to be together at any opportunity. They eventually managed to give Clem and Michelle the slip and ended back at their [[hotel]]. Shelley made her amorous intentions clear, but Mark seemed hesitant and ended up walking out. A confused Shelley followed him and berated him for leading her on. Mark was finally forced to divulge that the reason he couldn't sleep with her was because he was HIV positive. Shelley was furious with him for not trusting her enough to tell her in the first place and told him she never wanted to see him again.

Mark took the rejection badly and he began neglecting his health by not taking his HIV medication. During [[Christmas]] that year, he was rushed to hospital after collapsing. When Shelley found out that Mark was ill, she rushed to him and confessed that she really cared for him and so they reignited their relationship. Shelley was desperate for Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She became slightly infatuated with him and tried to spend as much time with him as she could. Mark felt that the relationship was moving too quickly and soon began to tire of Shelley. 

By March 1994, Mark had decided to end the relationship but when he tried to break it off, Shelley resorted to [[emotional blackmail]] and said that if he left her, she would fail her [[exam]]s. When this didn't work, she resorted to begging, crying and emotional pressure saying that, she had risked her health being with him, so he owed her. After one final irrational outburst â where she almost publicly revealed that Mark was HIV positive â Shelley finally realised that the relationship was over and decided to leave Walford in March 1994.

Shelley made one final appearance in December 1994, when she and Michelle attended their university graduation ceremony. Shelley was there with her fiancÃ©, and had found herself a job with a publisher who played golf with her fiancÃ©'s father. Shelley saw Mark and all their past animosity had been forgotten, although Mark's new girlfriend, [[Ruth Fowler|Ruth Aitken]], was a little jealous of her.

|first=12 November 1992

|occupation=Student
}}
'''Jack Woodman''' first appeared in November 1992 as a student friend of [[Michelle Fowler]]. Michelle went to a student gig on campus and spent the night being chatted up by Jack. Unbeknown to Michelle, her boyfriend, [[Clyde Tavernier]], followed her there and found her in bed with Jack, which ended their relationship.

Jack reappeared in December 1992 when he showed up unexpectedly at the Fowler house on Christmas Day, to visit Michelle. Jack soon revealed that he wanted to continue his fling with Michelle, although she was adverse to this and gently but firmly declined. Jack was not perturbed and he would continuously show up in Walford with various different excuses in a bid to get close to Michelle. He secretly took photos of her; arranged to be privately home tutored by her landlady [[Rachel Kominski]] and interfered with her lingerie; had numerous fights with Clyde; began to spend time with her mother [[Pauline Fowler|Pauline]] so he could pry into Michelleâs private life and then smashed his head against a brick wall and turned up at Michelleâs looking for sympathy. 

When Michelleâs daughter, Vicki, was kidnapped in March 1993, Jack became prime suspect in the police investigation. When the police questioned him and discovered that his room was littered with pictures of Michelle, they decided to keep him under surveillance. The real kidnapper was eventually caught, but Jack was furious with Michelleâs betrayal. He continued to stalk her until she decided to take action. She enlisted the help of [[Phil Mitchell]] to scare him away and when this failed she contacted Jackâs father and stepmother to confront them with his irrational behaviour. It was revealed that Jack had a history of stalking girls and, after Jack broke down and confessed to everything, his father took him home with him.
