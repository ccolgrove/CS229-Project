The '''Qatar 2022 FIFA World Cup bid''' is the successful proposal from the [[government of Qatar]] to host the [[2022 FIFA World Cup]]. Qatar, with a population of 1.69 million people, will be the first [[Arab World|Arab state]] to host the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani|Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa Al-Thani]], son of the present [[Emir of Qatar]], was the chairman of the bid committee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Qatar promoted their hosting of the tournament as representing the Arab World, and has drawn support from across the member states of the [[Arab League]]. They also positioned their bid as an opportunity to bridge the gap between the Arab World and the [[Western world|West]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Qatar gave a feel of what the World Cup would be like by holding a friendly match between [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] and [[Argentina national football team|Argentina]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2010/2010/11/20101117195116291452.html |title= Argentina win Qatar's Latin clash  Announced |date= 17 November 2010 |accessdate= 3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, people coming from different nations visited Qatar for this match and strengthened the image Qatar would depict of their interest in the World Cup 2022. Additionally, Qatar hosted the [[2011 Asian Cup]] which had the lowest attendance for the cup in 11 years, since the tournament was held in [[2000 AFC Asian Cup|Lebanon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatar2022bid.com/qatars-bid/sports-infrastructure |title=Bidding Nation Qatar 2022 - Sports Infrastructure |publisher=Qatar2022bid.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered a warm-up for 2022.

President of FIFA [[Sepp Blatter]] endorsed the idea of having a World Cup in the Arab World, saying in April 2010, &quot;The Arabic world deserves a World Cup. They have 22 countries and have not had any opportunity to organise the tournament.&quot; Blatter also praised Qatar's progress, &quot;When I was first in Qatar there were 400,000 people here and now there are 1.6 million. In terms of infrastructure, when you are able to organise the [[2006 Asian Games|Asian Games (in 2006)]] with more than 30 events for men and women, then that is not in question.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.aljazeera.net/sport/2010/04/2010424184010305993.html|title=Blatter reaches out to Arabia|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=2010-04-25|accessdate=2010-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 2 December 2010, it was announced that Qatar will host the 2022 FIFA World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/9250585.stm |title= 2018 and 2022 FIFA World Cup Hosts Announced |date= 2 December 2010 |accessdate= 2 December 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
{{main|Geography of Qatar}}
Working against the Qatar bid was the extreme temperature in the [[desert]] country. The World Cup always takes place during the European off-season in June and July. During this period the average daytime high in most of Qatar exceeds 50&amp;nbsp;Â°C (120&amp;nbsp;Â°F), the average daily low temperatures not dropping below 30&amp;nbsp;Â°C (86&amp;nbsp;Â°F).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/travel/businesstraveler/wxclimatology/monthly/graph/QAXX0003?from=36hr_bottomnav_business |title=Monthly Averages for Doha, Qatar |work=weather.com |publisher=The Weather Channel |accessdate=October 26, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In response to this issue, Sheikh Mohammed bin Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, the 2022 Qatar bid chairman, has stated, &quot;the event has to be organized in June or July. We will have to take the help of technology to counter the harsh weather. We have already set in motion the process. A stadium with controlled temperature is the answer to the problem. We have other plans up our sleeves as well.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The first five proposed stadia for the World Cup were unveiled at the beginning of March 2010. The stadia will employ cooling technology capable of reducing temperatures within the stadium by up to 20 degrees Celsius, and the upper tiers of the stadia will be disassembled after the World Cup and donated to countries with less developed sports infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qatar2022bid.com/qatars-bid/stadiums |title=Bidding Nation Qatar 2022 - Stadiums |publisher=Qatar2022bid.com |date= |accessdate=2010-05-30}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the five stadium projects launched have been designed by German architect [[Albert Speer, Jr.|Albert Speer &amp; Partners]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Qatar bid, FIFA&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.fifa.com/mm/document/tournament/competition/01/33/59/45/bidevaluationreport.pdf|title=2022 FIFA World Cup Bid Evaluation Report: Qatar|publisher=FIFA|date=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Conditioning in the stadiums for both the players and spectators will be solar powered, carbon neutral and provided by [[Arup]] of England.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/worldservice/news/2010/12/101203_qatar_wt_sl.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The Al-Khor Stadium is planned for Al-Khor city, located 50 kilometres north of Doha. The stadium will have a total capacity of 45,330, with 19,830 of the seats forming part of a temporary modular upper tier. The Al-Wakrah stadium, to be located in Al-Wakrah city in southern Qatar, will have a total capacity of 45,120 seats. The stadium will also contain a temporary upper tier of 25,500 seats. The stadium will be surrounded by large solar panels and will be decorated with Islamic art. The Al-Wakrah and Al-Khor stadiums would have been built regardless of whether Qatar was awarded the World Cup, according to the bid committee. However, the temporary upper-tier sections would not have been added if Qatar had lost the right to host the tournament.&lt;ref name=&quot;Qatar bid, FIFA&quot;/&gt;

== Controversy ==
=== Allegations of Bribery ===
During May 2011, allegations of bribery on the part of two members of the [[FIFA]] Executive Committee were tabled by Lord Triesman of the English FA. These allegations were based on information from a whistleblower involved with the Qatari bid. [[FIFA]] has since opened an internal inquiry into the matter, and a revote on the 2022 World Cup remains a possibility if the allegations are proven.  FIFA president [[Sepp Blatter]] has admitted that there is a ground swell of popular support to re-hold the 2022 vote won by Qatar.&lt;ref name=&quot;IndiaTimes&quot;&gt;[http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-05-20/top-stories/29563906_1_fifa-world-cup-qatar-fifa-executive-committee], Qatar may be stripped off FIFA World Cup 2022: Sepp Blatter.&lt;/ref&gt;

In testimony to a UK parliamentary inquiry board in May 2011, [[David Triesman, Baron Triesman|Lord Triesman]] alleged that Trinidad and Tobago's [[Jack Warner (football executive)|Jack Warner]] demanded $4 million for an education center in his country and Paraguay's [[NicolÃ¡s LÃ©oz]] asked for an honorary knighthood in exchange for their votes.  Also, two ''[[Sunday Times]]'' reporters testified that they had been told that Jacques Anouma of the Ivory Coast and [[Issa Hayatou]] of Cameroon were each paid $1.5 million to support Qatar's bid for the tournament.  All four have denied the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', &quot;Sorry Soccer&quot;, 23 May 2011, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Mohammed bin Hammam]], who played a key role in securing the games for Qatar, withdrew as a candidate for president of FIFA in May 2011 after being accused of bribing 25 FIFA officials to vote for his candidacy.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], &quot;Bin Hammam leaves race after allegations&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 30 May 2011, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Bin Hammam and Warner were suspended by FIFA in wake of these allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-13591142 | work=BBC News | title=Fifa suspends Bin Hammam and Jack Warner | date=2011-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Warner reacting to his suspension by questioning Blatter's conduct and adding that FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke had also told him that Qatar had bought the 2022 World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fanhouse.co.uk/2011/05/30/fifa-soap-opera-latest-jack-warner-says-2022-world-cup-was-bou/&lt;/ref&gt; Valcke subsequently issued a statement denying he had suggested it was bribery, saying instead that the country had &quot;used its financial muscle to lobby for support&quot;. Qatar officials denied any impropriety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2011/05/30/us-soccer-fifa-qatar-idUSTRE74T4J420110530 | work=Reuters | title=Qataris brush off allegations of buying World Cup rights | date=2011-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Weather ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
{{See also|Climate of Qatar}}
The World Cup is usually held in the northern hemisphere summer. During this season in Qatar, the temperature can get to {{convert|50|Â°C|Â°F}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/485603/Qatar/256420/Climate | title=EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica Qatar Climate |publisher=britannica.com |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2011-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar says that this will not be a problem for it hosting the World Cup. A section from Qatar 2022 Bid official site explains:

:&quot;Each of the five stadiums will harness the power of the suns rays to provide a cool environment for players and fans by converting solar energy into electricity that will then be used to cool both fans and players at the stadiums. When games are not taking place, the solar installations at the stadia will export energy onto the power grid. During matches, the stadia will draw energy from the grid. This is the basis for the stadiumsâ carbon-neutrality. Along with the stadiums, we plan to make the cooling technologies weâve developed available to other countries in hot climates, so that they too can host major sporting events.&quot;

Such cooling techniques will be able to reduce temperatures from 45 to 25 degrees Celsius, which would be comfortable for players and spectators during matches, the bid also proposes these cooling technologies to be used in fan-zones, training pitches and walkways between Metro stations and stadiums.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldfootballinsider.com/Story.aspx?id=33206 |title=Qatar 2022 World Cup Bid Reveals New Stadium Plans and Cooling Technologies |publisher=Worldfootballinsider.com |date=2010-04-28 |accessdate=2010-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these cooling technologies have never been tested within big stadiums and the Qataris are not able to guarantee that it will work. It also remains unclear how the Qataris will keep the fans cool outside the stadiums

=== Alcohol ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2010}}
Qatar is not a dry country. Alcohol can currently be consumed legally in a few clubs, bars, certain hotel restaurants, and the Pearl island by showing your passport for reporting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iloveqatar.net/moving.php|title=Moving to Qatar |work=iLoveQatar.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The question of whether alcohol was allowed to be consumed in additional areas and at the games themselves was asked, Hassan Abdulla al Thawadi, chief executive of the Qatar 2022 World Cup bid, said the Muslim state would also permit alcohol consumption during the World Cup. A few specific fan-zones will be set up during the event, they will provide alcohol for sale.&lt;ref name=&quot;thenational1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;yahoo1&quot;/&gt;

===Homosexual fans===
The selection of Qatar as hosts attracted controversy, as [[homosexuality]] is illegal in Qatar. [[FIFA President]] [[Sepp Blatter]] stated that &quot;we (FIFA) don't want any discrimination. What we want to do is open this game to everybody, and to open it to all cultures, and this is what we are doing in 2022,&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2010/dec/14/fifa-boss-gay-fans-no-sex | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Owen | last=Gibson | title=World news,World Cup 2022 (Football),Sepp Blatter,Fifa,Football,Sport | date=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://fitperez.com/2010-12-13-fifa-president-gay-fans-should-refrain-from-any-sexual-activities-during-2022-world-cup-in-qatar&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/football/9284186.stm | work=BBC News | title=Blatter sparks Qatar gay furore | date=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://espn.go.com/sports/soccer/news/_/id/5919439/gay-rights-group-wants-apology-fifa-sepp-blatter-comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thesportreview.com/tsr/2010/12/sepp-blatter-gays-qatar-world-cup-2022/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/12/13/fifa-president-dismisses-qatar-anti-gay-fears/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/13/fifa-president-gay-fans_n_796068.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 an American citizen visiting Qatar was sentenced to six months in prison and 90 lashes, for homosexual activity. In the 1990s, Philippine Overseas Employment Administration informed Philippine workers that gay workers were prohibited in Qatar. This was in response to several mass arrests and deportations of Philippine workers in Qatar, for homosexuality.

=== Israel ===
