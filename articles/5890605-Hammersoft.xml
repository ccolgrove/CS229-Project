The '''[[Walter F. George]] School of Law of [[Mercer University]]''', founded in 1873, is one of the oldest law schools in the [[United States]] and is the second oldest of Mercer's eleven colleges and schools.  The School of Law, with approximately 420 students, is located in [[Macon, Georgia]] on its own campus one mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) from Mercer's main campus.  The law school building, one of Macon's most recognizable sites, is a three-story partial replica of [[Independence Hall (United States)|Independence Hall]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] and is located on Coleman Hill overlooking downtown Macon.  

==Dean of the School==

In May 2010, Mercer University president [[William D. Underwood]] announced Gary J. Simson, former dean of [[Case Western Reserve University School of Law]], as the new dean of the Walter F. George School of Law effective July 1, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2010/100526Law.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Simson is a graduate of [[Yale University]] and [[Yale Law School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.law.mercer.edu/faculty/bio.cfm?staffid=626&lt;/ref&gt;

==Walter F. George==

[[Image:Walter George.PNG|thumb|150px|right|[[Walter F. George]], the namesake of Mercer Law School.]]

The School of Law is named for [[Walter F. George]], a distinguished Mercer Law alumnus, class of 1901, who served as [[United States Senator]] from [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] from 1922 to 1957 and as [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'']] from 1955 to 1957.  Before election to the Senate, he served as a Judge of the [[Georgia Court of Appeals]] in 1917 and as a Justice of the [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] from 1917 to 1922.  Mercer named its law school the Walter F. George School of Law of Mercer University in 1947.  [[Fred M. Vinson]], [[Chief Justice of the United States]], participated in the naming ceremony.  

The Walter F. George Foundation, created when the school was named, continues to fund scholarships for Mercer law students who have a demonstrated interest in pursuing a career in public service.  Walter F. George Foundation Public Service Scholarships cover full tuition for three years of law school along with community service grants for first-year and second-year summer public service internships.

==Accreditation and rankings==

The School of Law has been a member of the [[Association of American Law Schools]] since 1923 and has been fully accredited by the [[American Bar Association]] since 1925.&lt;ref name=&quot;martindale.com&quot;&gt;http://www.martindale.com/xp/legal/Professional_Resources/Law_Schools/schl4690.xml&lt;/ref&gt;  

In the 2010 edition of its law school rankings, ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' ranks Mercer in Tier 3 with schools ranked 101 through 137 of the nation's 184 accredited law schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/rankings/c_final_tier+3&lt;/ref&gt;  The same edition ranks Mercer's [[legal writing]] program first in the nation.&lt;ref&gt;http://grad-schools.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-law-schools/legal-writing&lt;/ref&gt;  The legal writing program has been ranked first or second since ''US News &amp; World Report'' began the speciality ranking in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2008/080401legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The program was ranked first in 2006 (tied with one other school), second in 2007, and first in 2008 and 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2008/080401legal.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  

The ''[[Princeton Review]]'' includes Mercer in its &quot;Best 174 Law Schools: 2010 Edition&quot; and has ranked the faculty among the top ten in nation on its list &quot;Professors Rock (Legally Speaking)&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2009/091009Rankings.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2007/071011lawranking.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2007/071011lawranking.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The ranking is based on responses to student surveys on two ratings: the quality of teaching and accessibility of faculty.  

In March 2008, ''National Jurist'', a publication for prospective law students, ranked Mercer 41st among the top 50 schools &quot;Where Public Interest Lawyers Go to Law School&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cypress/nationaljurist0308/index.php&lt;/ref&gt;  In other ''National Jurist'' rankings, in January 2005, Mercer was ranked eleventh out of almost 200 law schools for its successful and innovative use of technology.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2005/050224law.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The technology ranking was based in part on Mercer's laptop program, which provides every incoming student with a laptop computer and that has been used as a model for other law schools around the country.

In October 2008, ''preLaw Magazine'' ranked Mercer sixth among the Best Public Interest Law Schools.&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2008/081028law.htm,&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nxtbook.com/nxtbooks/cypress/prelaw-fall-08/#/28&lt;/ref&gt;  The rating is based on information reported in the E-Guide to Public Interest Law Schools, including student involvement, curriculum and financial factors.

==Statistics==

[[Image:George Waldo Woodruff 1917.gif|thumb|150px|right|[[George W. Woodruff]], the namesake of Mercer's Woodruff Curriculum.  The curriculum is viewed as a model for other law schools and has been honored with the prestigious Gambrell Professionalism Award from the [[American Bar Association]].]]   

The School of Law enrolls approximately 420 students and has a faculty of 34 full-time professors and 33 adjunct professors. The school awards the [[Juris Doctor]] and a joint [[Juris Doctor]]/[[Master of Business Administration]] in conjunction with Mercer's Eugene W. Stetson School of Business and Economics.  The school publishes the ''Mercer Law Review'', the oldest law review in Georgia, and the ''Journal of Southern Legal History''.

The School of Law's model curriculum, the Woodruff Curriculum, named for philanthropist [[George W. Woodruff]], is viewed as a model for law schools across the United States.  The curriculum, based on small classes and a practice oriented approach, focuses on [[legal ethics]], [[professional responsibility]], and [[legal writing]] and has been honored with the prestigious Gambrell Professionalism Award from the [[American Bar Association]].&lt;ref name=&quot;martindale.com&quot; /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abanet.org/cpr/awards/prevwinners.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The School of Law houses the Mercer Center for Legal Ethics and Professionalism, established in 2000 and dedicated to fostering and teaching ethics and professionalism in the practice of law, and the National Criminal Defense College, a not-for-profit organization established in 1985 and devoted to improved trial advocacy and trial practice.

The School of Law also houses the [[Legal Writing Institute]], the world's largest organization devoted to improved [[legal writing]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www2.mercer.edu/News/Articles/2009/090213Law.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institute's 1,800 members represent attorneys, judges, and legal writing professors in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Europe]], [[Asia]], [[Australia]], and [[New Zealand]].

George]] when the school was named in his honor, has grown remarkably since a $15 million bequest in 1987 from [[George W. Woodruff]].  Income from the endowment allows the school to maintain its low student-faculty ratio (12:1) and funds the student financial aid program.&lt;ref name=&quot;martindale.com&quot; /&gt;
