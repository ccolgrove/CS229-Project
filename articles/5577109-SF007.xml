'''Baltix GNU/Linux''' is an [[operating system]] for Lithuanian and Latvian people, based on [[Debian]] and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]]&lt;ref name=&quot;Official Baltix website in English&quot;&gt;[http://baltix.akl.lt/english Official Baltix website in English]&lt;/ref&gt;. The main language is [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]].

It uses the [[GNOME]] desktop environment and is distributed as an installable [[Live CD]].

The first public versions of Baltix GNU/Linux were released in 2003 and were based on [[Knoppix]] [[Live CD]] and [[Debian]] software packages,&lt;ref&gt;[https://lists.akl.lt/pipermail/baltix-knoppix/2003-May/000000.html Announce of Baltix-Knoppix]&lt;/ref&gt; and later, on the Morphix Live CD framework.  Most recently, [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] technology was chosen for Live CD. Despite of changes in startup and installation technologies, Baltix is always distributed as an installable Live CD with graphical installer&lt;ref name=&quot;Baltix on Ubuntu derivative Wiki&quot;&gt;[http://wiki.ubuntu.com/Baltix Baltix description on official Ubuntu derivative Wiki]&lt;/ref&gt;.

Since [[2007]] separate Baltix CD/DVD images for home/business use, educational institutions (DVD version for &quot;Science and Education&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mokslui.akl.lt Free software for Education and Science]&lt;/ref&gt;) and servers are being released.

Baltix can run directly from its live-CD, without installation to a computer's permanent storage (hard disk, solid state drive, etc.), but also can be installed into a computer's Linux or Windows partition(s).
