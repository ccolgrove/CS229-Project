When [[Whitney Dean]] ([[Shona McGarty]]) goes to Balham looking for Billie, Connor and the rest of the gang attack her. They later arrive in [[Albert Square]] and apologise to Whitney, and Billie insists he has disposed of the gun they wanted back. Kylie and Connor turn up at a [[grime (music)|grime]] night at [[The Queen Victoria]] where Connor steals a bottle of tequila. Outside, he sprays graffiti on a bench and then Kylie and Connor run off, leaving Whitney and Billie to suffer the consequences. Kylie, Connor and Mitch return a few weeks later and take Billie for drinks where they are told to leave by [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). The gang decide to rob the pub using a fake gun, and they get away with the money. Billie then realises the real gun that he hid has gone missing after Kylie found it earlier.

However, [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) is the one who is shot. The next day, Connor arrives looking for Billie, and reveals that Kylie has been arrested.

Months later, Connor arrives at Billie's birthday party with four friends who bring lots of alcohol. The next morning, after everyone has left, Billie is found dead. The next week, Billie's mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) visits Connor in Balham, who says he has heard that Billie died. Carol rants at him, blaming him for Billie's death, and bans him from the funeral. She tells him she hopes one day he loses a child so he will know how she feels. Connor, Mitch and the rest of the gang arrive for Billie's funeral but Carol bans all of them. As the hearse passes, they remove their hoods and masks as a mark of respect. After the funeral, Connor goes to Carol's, angry that she banned him. However, he realises she is about to attempt suicide and tells her it will not work. They both break down about Billie and comfort each other, which leads to them having sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/spoilers/a282809/an-anguished-carol-sleeps-with-connor.html|title=An anguished Carol sleeps with Connor|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=October 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=26 October 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are interrupted and Connor leaves. At Kylie's sentencing, Connor sees Carol and compliments her on her new hair, and asks if she would come back to his. However, Jack interrupts and tells Connor to watch out as he has a score to settle. As Carol walks away, Connor apologises and says he will leave her alone. Kylie is then sentenced to 15 years in prison.

When Carol receives Billie's ashes, she takes them to Connor to ask him where Billie might have wanted them scattered. Connor reveals he has nowhere to live so Carol invites him to move in with her and [[Glenda Mitchell]] ([[Glynis Barber]]). They then start a sexual relationship, and Connor starts stealing cars for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]). Carol kicks him out after finding [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] in the flat. However, it is Glenda's and Carol tries to call Connor to ask him to move back in. Carol's daughter [[Bianca Butcher]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]) still does not trust Connor however, and accuses him of manipulating her mother. Carol defends Connor, but then finds out that he is in possession of stolen jewellery, and throws him out again. Connor is handling the jewellery for Phil, and returns to Walford to pay for a delivery of it. [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) meets him with the jewellery, but Connor under-pays him and threatens him not to tell Phil. However Jay then confronts him again and beats him up, retrieving the cash owed in the process. Connor meets up with Whitney and flirts with her. He also asks her to help him sell the stolen jewellery, which she agrees to. However, Phil's partner [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]) buys it and Phil finds out. He tells Connor to sell it by the end of the week. Connor then gives it back to Whitney to look after but Bianca finds it and dumps it down a drain. Bianca tells Phil that Connor should pay, so Phil beats Connor, but is interrupted by Carol. She takes Connor back to her flat where Connor admits he was only with Whitney to make Carol jealous, and they start kissing. They start their relationship again in secret, and spend New Year's Eve together. Connor also starts working for Phil at his garage and starts seeing Whitney behind Carol's back. When it is revealed that Connor has been sleeping with both Carol and Whitney, Bianca attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised. Carol visits Connor in hospital but his mother [[List of EastEnders characters (2011)#Kendra Stanley|Kendra]] ([[Sharon D. Clarke]]) arrives and tells Carol to go home and leave Connor alone, and Connor tells Carol he now has his mother and does not need her.

Carol pays Connor a visit after Whitney goes missing to see if he knows where she is. He is pleased to see her but she realises she was only with him because of her grief over Billie. He tries to make a move on her but she rejects him. The incident gives Carol closure and she is able to scatter Billie's ashes.

He is described as a mysterious {{nowrap|60-something}} and a perfect gent who arrives to report on local elections for ''Walford Gazette'', and is said to be a potential love interest for characters [[Peggy Mitchell]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) and [[Pat Evans]] ([[Pam St. Clement]]). Jarvis said on his casting: &quot;I'm absolutely thrilled to be a potential thorn between two roses working with two actresses I greatly admire and have had the pleasure of working with before. I'm delighted to be reunited with Pam and Barbara and to have a part in ''EastEnders''.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a205935/martin-jarvis-joins-eastenders.html|title=Martin Jarvis joins 'EastEnders'|last=Green|first=Kris|date=1 March 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=1 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He arrives in [[The Queen Victoria]] public house to interview Peggy on the upcoming council elections in which she is running. He later interviews [[Pat Evans]] for the same reason, but Peggy plies them with free drinks and Pat gets drunk. Peggy tells Harvey that Pat cheated on her husband with Peggy's husband, and that anything she has said about the Mitchell family is a lie. After Pat pours a drink on Peggy's head, Harvey announces that he has more candidates to interview and leaves, after wiping Peggy's face. After hearing that Pat and Peggy have both chosen to withdraw from the election, Harvey visits them individually, giving them his card and inviting them out for drinks. A week later, they both decide to call him on the same day. He takes Pat out for lunch and Peggy out for dinner without them knowing he is seeing them both. The next day he tries his best to stop them finding out but eventually they realise what he has been doing, so he quickly leaves. Pat and Peggy argue over him but eventually agree not to let him come between their friendship. They tell him so and tell him to get out in unison. Later, Harvey talks to Pat and she asks who he would have chosen if he had to choose. He says Pat as he prefers a more intelligent woman. He then waits for Peggy and she asks him the same question, to which he says he would have chosen Peggy as he prefers a woman with class. Pat and Peggy meet again and agree they did the right thing, but then both their mobile phones receive text messages at the same time and they walk away from each other smiling.

Harvey spends time with Pat while Peggy is away but when Peggy returns he invites her to the theatre. She says she cannot make it so Harvey invites Pat who agrees. Peggy later says she can come but Harvey says he has given the tickets to someone else. Peggy buys tickets of her own and Pat and Peggy both turn up at the theatre together, and Harvey's face drops when he sees them both. He explains that they are at fault for not telling each other they were seeing him. Pat and Peggy begin to argue so Harvey leaves and escapes onto a tour bus. Pat and Peggy catch him up and take over the tour guide's microphone, saying that Harvey is vermin and slapping him before they get off. Harvey returns to Walford to explain that he wants to carry on seeing them both, but if it can only be as friends then so be it. When he goes to the toilet, Pat reveals that she has slept with Harvey and Peggy reveals that she has not. They realise he is just trying to get as much sex as he can and plan to humiliate him. Pat leaves Peggy and Harvey alone and Peggy says that night she was going to sleep with Harvey and they could still do so. He goes upstairs and Peggy steals his clothes. When he comes downstairs, Pat and Peggy are waiting and they tell him to leave after Pat throws his clothes out the door. Harvey has a sheet around him but Pat snatches it off him before he leaves humiliated.

'''Grace Olubunmi''' is the grandmother of [[Mercy Olubunmi]] ([[Bunmi Mojekwu]]). She appears in episode 8 of the first series of ''EastEnders'' spin-off ''[[EastEnders: E20]]'', credited only as '''Mrs Olubunmi''' and played by [[Jay Byrd]].

In ''EastEnders: E20'', Grace tells Mercy that her friend [[Fatboy (EastEnders)|Fatboy]] ([[Ricky Norwood]]) is a bad influence on her. When the character arrives in ''EastEnders'', she urges Mercy to tell Fatboy that they are moving to [[Lagos]]. She makes friends with [[Liz Turner]] ([[Kate Williams (actress)|Kate Williams]]), mother of [[Owen Turner]] ([[Lee Ross]]) and later tells Fatboy about their plans. She hosts a lunch at the community centre and tells [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) that she has grown fond of London but is going to Lagos for Mercy's sake. Fatboy then realises that neither Grace nor Mercy want to go and makes them realise this after Mercy has returned the key to their former home. Fatboy then says he has a plan for somewhere for them to live, and they move into a property on [[Albert Square]]. Grace attends a bible class with Mercy, held by Lucas. She apologises for Mercy's behaviour when she continues to ask about false prophets and a passage that states that anyone who questions a priest should be put to death, causing Lucas to leave. Grace makes Mercy write Lucas a letter of apology, but Mercy bins it.

Upset with the amount of litter around the streets, she urges Mercy and Fatboy to volunteer to pick it up. She takes Mercy's friends [[Zsa Zsa Carter]] ([[Emer Kenny]]) and [[Leon Small]] ([[Sam Attwater]]) to get their GCSE results and says she used to be a teacher. The next month Leon breaks one of her commemorative plates and Fatboy tries to create a new one in the hope Grace will think it is real, but she does not fall for it. However, she praises Fatboy for his eventual honesty and displays the plate with her others. However, when she discovers Mercy has been serving drinks in [[Alfie Moon]]'s ([[Shane Richie]]) illegal den, she berates her granddaughter and says Fatboy has corrupted her. Grace overhears [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) planning to collect jumble for her church. Grace collects the jumble instead, leaving Dot upset. They quote bible passages to each other to try to show who is in the right, but Grace later admits that she is lonely and just wanted to meet new people. The next day, Mercy tries to get Grace and Dot to make up, by suggesting Grace work in the launderette. Grace puts some shirts in a broken washing machine, which annoys Dot, and after Grace gets it open Dot is still not happy. Grace later gives Dot her CV to give to her boss, and Dot says there is not a job for her but Grace tells her that Jesus disagrees.

The next day, Grace asks Dot if she has looked at her CV yet. Dot says Grace is overqualified as she used to be a teacher. Grace says she will not be teaching again as she was dismissed from her last job. Later, Dot finds a tin of cakes in the launderette with a note from Grace saying it was not about the job. Dot visits Grace and offers her a few weeks work while Dot is away. Grace feels honoured, and tells Dot she was dismissed for slapping a pupil. Dot thanks her for her honesty. However, when Dot joins a local choir that Grace is a member of, the pair start quarrelling again, as Dot is unimpressed with the singing standard of the group. She later holidays in her native [[Nigeria]] but returns in time for the [[wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton]]. She does not watch the wedding, however, as Mercy is leaving because she faces deportation. Grace and Mercy say goodbye to each other but as Mercy's taxi drives off, Fatboy stops it and asks Mercy to marry him. Grace is opposed to the idea at first, until she realises that Fatboy loves Mercy.

After Mercy and Fatboy's wedding, Grace attends Mercy's hearing and is annoyed that they will not get a decision over whether she can stay in the country straight away. Mercy is allowed to stay in the UK but decides to leave anyway over guilt at her deception. Grace waves Mercy off as she leaves in the back of a black cab. Two days later Grace worries when Fatboy does not come home, and finds he stayed with Dot. Fatboy later tells Grace that he will be living with Dot as Grace's house holds too many memories of Mercy. Grace is surprised when Mercy's sister [[Faith Olubunmi]] (Modupe Adeyeye) arrives from Nigeria and moves in with her. Faith later holds a party at Grace's house and she has sex with Fatboy but they are caught by Grace. The next day, when Faith returns home drunk, Grace slaps her and kicks her out of the house. Following this, Grace makes appearances in ''EastEnders: E20'', where Faith continues to ask her for a place to stay, but Grace refuses. Grace is also upset when [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]), [[Abi Branning]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) and [[Ben Mitchell (EastEnders)|Ben Mitchell]] (Joshua Pascoe) prank call her and then break her hanging basket.

Mercy and Grace's introduction to ''EastEnders'' made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu, who plays Mercy, was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Stage interview&quot;&gt;{{cite journal|date=23 June 2011|title=Breaking barriers|journal=[[The Stage]]|publisher=The Stage Newspaper Limited|location=London|issue=6789|page=28|issn=0038-9099|accessdate=24 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the announcement of Mojekwu's departure,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a318766/eastenders-confirms-mercy-departure.html|title='EastEnders' confirms Mercy departure|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=10 May 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=10 May 2011|location=[[London]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was revealed that Mercy's family will remain in the series.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Stage interview&quot;/&gt; [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] confirmed this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/scoop/a330277/eastenders-character-teasers-from-exec-bryan-kirkwood.html|title=Exclusive: 'EastEnders' character teasers from exec Bryan Kirkwood|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=18 July 2011|work=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=19 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, Thomas received a special mention at the [[Screen Nation]] Awards, which celebrate the best British Black talent.&lt;ref name=&quot;screen nation&quot;/&gt;

He offers to take her somewhere more quiet and they leave together. He takes her to a secluded spot and tells her that drinking and throwing herself at men is wrong and that her soul is lost. He says she needs to be cleansed and forces her to pray, but she attempts to fight back. She escapes but Lucas catches up to her, again telling her to beg for God's forgiveness. Lucas then removes his tie, and when he returns home, there are deep scratch marks on his neck. Jade's fate is unknown until Lucas's wife [[Denise Johnson|Denise]] ([[Diane Parish]]) suspects Lucas is cheating on her, so Lucas takes her to see where he got the scratches. They go to Jade's flat where she tells Denise that she prayed with Lucas and he baptised her, though initially she tried to resist and scratched Lucas. She says she will get help for her alcohol dependence and get her daughter back, who was taken away from her.

Jade was originally scripted as a prostitute who [[Lucas Johnson]] ([[Don Gilet]]) picks up and forces to pray for forgiveness before apparently strangling her. However, following the charging of Stephen Griffiths with the [[Bradford murders|murder of three prostitutes in Bradford]], the decision was made to reshoot the scenes to remove the prostitute references, less than a week before the scenes were due to air. A spokesperson for the programme said the decision was made to &quot;ensure we do not cause distress to the families involved in these tragic events.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a223152/eastenders-to-drop-lucas-prostitute-link.html|title='EastEnders' to drop Lucas prostitute link|last=Green|first=Kris|date=3 June 2010|publisher=[[Digital Spy]]|accessdate=3 June 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10226614.stm|title=EastEnders to re-shoot Lucas prostitute scene|date=3 June 2010|publisher=[[BBC News Online]]|accessdate=4 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Harry first appears when Vanessa returns home from seeing [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]). He asks her for a drink and then says he smells cigarette smoke on her. She lies that she was out with friends but he says one of her friends called earlier that day and has not seen Vanessa for weeks. Vanessa then says she went out on her own as she could not face being bored at home, and admits to smoking, which Harry dislikes. He wonders if she is seeing someone else, and after he watches Vanessa go upstairs to bed, he moves an ornament back to where it was before Vanessa moved it when she came home. He comes to Walford several weeks later, looking for Max. He asks [[Liam Butcher]] ([[James Forde]]) and his younger brother, [[Morgan Jackson-King|Morgan]] (Devon Higgs) if he knows Max. Liam tells him where he lives, and Harry gives them some money. However, he mistakes [[Darren Miller]] ([[Charlie G. Hawkins]]) for him and knees him in the groin, telling him to keep off his property, leaving Darren in immense pain as he has just returned from having a [[circumcision]] operation. He takes Vanessa to Walford and dumps her bags outside Max's house, realises who Max really is, and asks Vanessa what Max has that he does not, to which she says he can manage sex more than once a week. Harry says they are welcome to each other and leaves, taking Vanessa's car.

However, when Jodie reveals to Vanessa that Harry is heartbroken, Vanessa ends her affair with Max and moves back to Chigwell. Harry then comes to Walford with Vanessa and Jodie to meet Darren. At Vanessa's birthday party, Max's ex-wife [[Tanya Branning|Tanya]] ([[Jo Joyner]]) tells Vanessa that Max misses her and she should go back to him. Jodie sees that Harry is not very interested in celebrating Vanessa's birthday and tells her mother that she agrees with Tanya as Vanessa deserves better than Harry, so Vanessa goes back to Max again.
Harry attempts to contact Vanessa but she continues to ignore him as it is [[Billie Jackson]]'s ([[Devon Anderson]]) funeral. He sends [[#Vicky Saunders|Vicky Saunders]] (Jessica Ellerby) to issue Vanessa with some papers but she sends her away. Harry later turns up at Vanessa's house and hands her the papers, revealing that he wants Vanessa to get nothing in their divorce. He also threatens her with Jodie, saying he can get her to take his side, saying she has always been a daddy's girl, but Vanessa reveals he is not her father. In spite, Harry spray-paints the word &quot;slapper&quot; on Max's door, and plasters Walford with nude photos of Vanessa. When Darren catches Harry about to spray-paint a car, he stops him and Harry tells him that he is not Jodie's father. Later, Darren begs Harry not to tells Jodie but when Jodie says Harry phoned her, Darren assumes he told her and accidentally reveals the truth.

Vanessa meets Harry and he says he will do anything to hurt Vanessa, even keeping Jodie from her despite no longer feeling anything for her. He takes Vanessa's jewellery and calls her a prostitute, saying that he will let Jodie stay with her if they have sex. Harry takes revenge by throwing a brick through Max and Vanessa's window and slashing the tyres of the cars on Max's car lot. Jodie's cat goes missing and while everyone looks for it, Harry slashes Vanessa's clothes, and when she goes to throw them away, she finds the cat dead in the bin. Max and his brother [[Jack Branning|Jack]] ([[Scott Maslen]]) then decide to take revenge on Harry. They send Harry a text message from Vanessa's phone asking to meet, and when he turns up, they threaten him and tell him to never contact Vanessa again or next time it will be worse. After they all go their separate ways, Jack is grabbed by two men and bundled into a car. Jack is later released, but reveals to Max that Harry was behind the kidnapping.

After Harry's departure Vanessa reveals to Jodie that her dad is a [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] man, but she cannot remember his name. Jodie later mentions Harry in conversation to her friend [[Poppy Meadow]] ([[Rachel Bright]]) where she is annonyed at him, as it isn't her fault that he is not her dad, even though in her eyes he always will be.

Vanessa contacts Harry in need of money to pay for Jodie and Darren's wedding. Harry agrees so he can make amends with Jodie, as long as Vanessa will not be there. However, Darren overhears this and reveals it to Jodie, and he tells Harry to leave.

Lily is conceived in September 2009 when Stacey stops taking medication for her bipolar disorder, causing her to act irrationally and sleep with numerous men, including Ryan. Around the same time, she is raped by [[Archie Mitchell]] ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]) and after trying to tell ex-husband [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]), she was sectioned under the Mental Health Act. Upon Stacey's return to Walford, she reunites with Bradley and reveals that she is pregnant. He is overjoyed, thinking the baby is his, but she reveals she is three months pregnant, and therefore the baby cannot be Bradley's. After revealing that Archie raped her, Bradley vows to raise the child as his own. However, he later dies. It is revealed that Archie was no longer capable of fathering children, so Stacey believes the father must be Ryan. After months of failing to tell him, she goes into labour alone and Ryan finds her, going to the hospital with her. During labour, the baby is starved of oxygen, but is born healthy. After returning home a few days later, she names the baby Lily. Stacey refuses to take Lily out of the house and panics when Jean does so without her knowing. However, [[Max Branning]] ([[Jake Wood]]) soon convinces Stacey to take Lily outside. In September 2010, during the Queen Vic fire, Stacey and Lily are trapped upstairs. They are both rescued by Ryan, who has just got married to [[Janine Butcher]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]) and shortly after, Stacey tells Ryan he is Lily's father. The next day, Ryan declines an offer to hold Lily, and walks away.

After Ryan and Janine's honeymoon, Janine discovers that Ryan is Lily's father and is angry about it, pushing Lily's pram over, though Lily is not inside, and arguing with Stacey. She later telephones Social Services to say Stacey is neglecting Lily. However, the social worker, [[Maria de Costa]] (Judy Browne), assesses that Lily is being looked after properly and notes that the allegation was a false one. Stacey and Ryan get Lily's birth certificate changed to have Ryan's name added, but Ryan lies to Janine about where he was even though Janine knows, so she decides to kidnap Lily and take Ryan to France so that Stacey is out of their lives. However, when Ryan discovers Lily is in the car, he orders Janine to stop. She does so but it is on a level crossing with a train approaching and she is unable to start the car. Ryan gets Lily out to safety but Janine is unable to open her door. However, the car starts and the train just misses her. Ryan demands to drive back to Walford, where Stacey has realised Lily is missing and has called the police. However, Janine tells her she heard Lily crying so took her to look after her, and Ryan backs up Janine's story.

On Christmas Day 2010 after Stacey's revelation that she is actually [[Archie Mitchell]]'s ([[Larry Lamb (actor)|Larry Lamb]]) murderer, not Bradley, Stacey decides to flee the country, taking Lily with her.

'''Richard Mitchell''' is the son of [[Sam Mitchell (EastEnders)|Sam Mitchell]] ([[Danniella Westbrook]]) and [[Jack Branning]] ([[Scott Maslen]]), born in the episode broadcast on 2 September 2010, though it is set the day before. Sam becomes pregnant while in a relationship with [[Ricky Butcher]] ([[Sid Owen]]) but has an affair with Jack. At first, Sam wants the baby adopted but decides to keep him as her mother [[Peggy Mitchell|Peggy]] ([[Barbara Windsor]]) insists, saying the baby is the only way Sam can get back with Ricky, who is now married to [[Bianca Jackson]] ([[Patsy Palmer]]). Peggy promises to raise Richard, but she leaves Walford, leaving Sam on her own. Sam insists that Ricky is Richard's father, but Bianca wants a paternity test to be sure. Sam lies about the result, saying Ricky is Richard's father. However, Bianca double checks and discovers it is Jack. When Sam realises she is unable to cope with Richard, she asks Jack and his fiancÃ©e [[Ronnie Mitchell]] ([[Samantha Womack]]) to have him. When Sam is due to meet Ronnie and Jack to drop Richard off, she does not turn up, so Jack and Ronnie decide to visit her. Ronnie goes in and asks Sam to think it through, and offers her money to leave Walford with Richard as when Jack finds out she is keeping Richard, he will come after her. Ronnie leaves without Richard but Sam drops him off with Jack. Later, Ronnie and Sam meet and she gives Sam the money, telling her to take Richard back and leave. Sam takes Richard and returns home. She then leaves to live with her brother [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]) in Portugal, taking Richard with her.

Following the paternity test, DNA testing laboratory Alpha BioLabs reported a 27% increase in calls for paternity tests from people who did not realise how simple the tests were.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.clickliverpool.com/clocked/celeb-stories/1210732-eastenders-paternity-plot-sparks-surge-in-dna-testing.html|title=EastEnders' paternity plot sparks surge in DNA testing|last=Evans|first=Natalie|date=16 September 2010|publisher=Click Liverpool|accessdate=16 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greg is first mentioned in March 2010 at the funeral of Tanya's ex-husband [[Max Branning]]'s ([[Jake Wood]]) son [[Bradley Branning]] ([[Charlie Clements]]), by Max and Tanya's daughters [[Abi Branning|Abi]] ([[Lorna Fitzgerald]]) and [[Lauren Branning|Lauren]] ([[Madeline Duggan]], later [[Jacqueline Jossa]]), who tell their father that Tanya is waiting for them outside with her new boyfriend. In June 2010, during a visit from Max, Tanya reveals that she and Greg are engaged. Greg arrives in Albert Square with Tanya, who is visiting Lauren, and Greg is met by [[Alfie Moon]] ([[Shane Richie]]) who invites him to his illegal drinking den in the basement of The Queen Victoria. Alfie and Max, who is also there, suspect Greg is gay and Alfie then jokes to Greg that Max has a crush on him. This causes animosity between them when they are locked in alone. Later, Max returns home and Tanya brings Greg to meet him, not realising they have already met. Greg then reveals Alfie has given him the contract to refurbish the pub. After a few days, Greg realises [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) has stolen some of his power drills. Tanya comes to Walford and introduces Greg to [[Jane Beale]] ([[Laurie Brett]]) and Jane's husband [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), whom he makes friends quickly with. On the day of the pub's opening night, Greg reports that the electrics have failed and that his workers are unable to have the pub ready in time, much to the anger of [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]) who accuses Greg of not trying hard enough. Greg and Tanya visit Walford after the pub is finished and become friends with Max and [[Vanessa Gold]] ([[Zoe Lucker]]), and are invited to the Brannings' for Christmas dinner.

Tanya and Greg set a date for their wedding and Greg works for [[Zainab Masood]] ([[Nina Wadia]]) fixing the roof of her new restaurant the Argee Bhajee. Tanya and Greg then move to [[Roxy Mitchell|Roxy Mitchell's]] ([[Rita Simons]]) house in Albert Square to be closer to Lauren and Abi. Tanya opens the salon in their living room alongside [[Syed Masood]] ([[Marc Elliot]]), which annoys Greg. He agrees to buy Roxy's salon for Tanya as a wedding present. Greg invites Tanya's estranged mother, [[Cora Cross]] ([[Ann Mitchell]]) to the wedding and Tanya is annoyed but forgives him. At his stag party, he hears Max say that Tanya does not deserve Greg so Greg confronts him and later rips up his and Vanessa's invites. He takes Ian home and bumps into Jane who has just had a row with Tanya and is very drunk. Jane kisses Greg but he pushes her away and tells her to forget that it ever happened. Greg and Tanya marry and go on their honeymoon. After they return, Tanya begins an affair with Max. When she thinks she might be pregnant, she tells both Max and Greg, but a test shows she is not. Greg then hopes to have a child with Tanya, but discovers contraceptive pills. Lauren covers for Tanya by telling Greg they are hers. Greg is annoyed when Cora and Rainie come to stay. Tanya gets angry when Greg buys a rocking horse for a future child, and she later confesses to Greg that she does not want more children. Greg describes how he wants to hold his own newborn child in his arms and have someone to call him 'dad'. Tanya says that that is not what being a father is about, and says he is already being a father to her children. Greg reluctantly agrees. However, he discovers that Tanya is having an affair with Max and in disgust he leaves her and goes on holiday without her. While away, Greg sells the house to [[Janine Malloy]] ([[Charlie Brooks]]), forcing Tanya and her family to move out.

Greg returns to Walford months later, having been called by Lauren. Tanya reveals her cancer to Greg but he is unable to handle it, so makes an excuse and leaves, leaving a hysteric Lauren behind.

===Development===
Greg is introduced as a rival of Tanya's ex husband Max, and a spokesperson for the programme commented, &quot;Max has his fair share of women but he still has a soft spot for Tanya despite all they have been through. Don't be too surprised if he makes mincemeat out of Greg.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greg&quot; /&gt; Booth, who was initially on a short-term contract to appear in the show,&lt;ref name=&quot;Greg&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/08/17/tanya-s-new-man-joins-eastenders-115875-22492904/|title=Tanya's new man joins EastEnders|last=Jefferies|first=Mark|date=17 August 2010|work=[[Daily Mirror]]|publisher=[[Trinity Mirror]]|accessdate=17 August 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; said, &quot;I'm absolutely delighted to be coming into [[Albert Square]].

The character's profile on the official ''EastEnders'' website describes him as gorgeous and loyal with a feminine side, and he cares about his looks, having regular work outs, manicures and exfoliation treatments. He is not a womaniser as his mother, Moira, showed him how to treat women properly.

Julie arrives in Walford the following week and surprises Billy by coming to his door. Julie says she does not want to testify against Henry, and leaves when [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) return home. She telephones Billy asking him to meet her at the cafÃ©, where she reveals that even though Henry Mason raped her, they always used contraception, and the only time she did not was when she had sex with Billy. She tells Billy that he has an adult son. She explains that he was taken away from her a week after he was born, and says he probably had a better life.

However, Billy soon contacts Julie again, and she helps him sell stock on his market stall. He invites her round the next week, and Jay notes that she has made an effort to look good for Billy. They go to a party where Billy invites Julie to his relative [[Ronnie Mitchell]]'s ([[Samantha Womack]]) wedding and she accepts. She later sees [[Stacey Branning]] ([[Lacey Turner]]) taking off her high heel stilettos and steals them, leaving her own shoes behind. When Billy realises Julie has gone, he phones her and she says she felt unwell.

Julie arrives for Ronnie's wedding where Â£20,000 goes missing. Ronnie's sister [[Roxy Mitchell]] ([[Rita Simons]]) accuses Julie of stealing it, though she did not. At the reception, Stacey sees Julie wearing her shoes and confronts her, and Roxy empties Julie's bag looking for the money, revealing Julie has filled it with food. Julie runs off and Billy catches up to her. She reveals she is wearing an [[electronic tag]] and is under curfew as she is staying in a hostel and she is trying to make her room feel like her own. Billy says this does not matter to him. Julie is accused again when she wears an expensive coat that she found, that the real thief, [[Shirley Carter]] ([[Linda Henry]]), bought. Julie spends the day helping [[Dot Branning]] ([[June Brown]]) at the laundrette and they become friends. However, Julie leaves embarrassed after [[Mo Harris]] ([[Laila Morse]]) reveals to Dot that Julie is wearing the tag. She later gets a job from [[Kat Moon]] ([[Jessie Wallace]]), cleaning at [[The Queen Victoria]] but she accidentally disconnects the beer pumps. Kat sacks her but [[Patrick Trueman]] ([[Rudolph Walker]]) and Billy persuade her to give Julie another chance. When Julie asks to store some things around Billy's house, he discovers some photos of a man. Thinking Julie is in a relationship, he confronts her, but she explains that they are pictures of their son, [[#Roger Green|Roger Green]] ([[Daniel Brocklebank]]). Billy wants to see Roger, but Julie warns it is too late. However, Billy finds his address in Julie's belongings and goes to visit him. Once at the house, Billy announces that he is his father. Roger denies this, and Julie turns up and pulls Billy away. She explains that she could not trace their real son, so fantasised that Roger, her former boss, was their son instead. Billy forgives Julie, but informs her that he has contacted an adoption agency about their son. Billy and Julie then start a proper romantic relationship as a couple and after her tag is removed she moves in with him, as well as getting a job on the flower stall. She befriends [[Heather Trott]] ([[Cheryl Fergison]]) after Heather catches her stealing and then writing a birthday card to her son, forcing her to reveal that she gave him up for adoption.

Julie asks Kat to come with her to the park as she is meeting Billy's son, [[William Mitchell (EastEnders)|William Mitchell]] (Toby Warpole), for the first time and is worried that she is not ready to be a stepmother. However, as they play in the park, it goes well and Julie thanks Kat for coming. Billy discovers the name of his and Julie's son is Dan Pearce. They go to visit him but find out he died three months previously. However, they discover they have a granddaughter, [[Lola Pearce]] ([[Danielle Harold]]). Billy and Julie visit Lola in care and Billy bonds with her, but Julie feels she is trouble and not their problem when she continues to visit Billy. Lola tells Julie that she will win if Billy is forced to choose between them, so Julie calls the police to have Lola taken back into care. She later admits to Billy that she did this, however, she later allows Lola to move in with her and Billy. She is angry with Billy when he refuses to discipline Lola, and worries when a social worker allows Lola to stay though they are squatting and the social worker will want to see a tenancy agreement.

Julie takes the blame when Lola accidentally injures [[Jay Brown]] ([[Jamie Borthwick]]) while he is working in the Arches. The accident occurs when Lola begins working for [[Phil Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) but he fires her after catching her stealing. Lola, in a fit of rage, smashes up the Arches and kicks a piece of heavy equipment down into the pit, which hits Jay and knocks him unconscious. Lola goes back to the care home when Jay gives her a day to confess the truth, and is persuaded to come back by Billy. She tells Julie that she will win if Billy is forced to chose, and Julie, realising she and Lola have no future together, leaves after saying an emotional farewell to Billy.

In June 2011, it was announced that Danielle Harold had joined the cast, playing Julie and Billy's 15-year-old granddaughter [[Lola Pearce]].

When Alan's ex-wife and Billie's mother [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) sees him, she leaves as he reminds her of Billie at that age. Kai then shows the family a trick that Billie had taught him, namely axillary flatulence. They return home after the wake.

Five-year-old Spencer was cast in the role after a friend of his mother's found out ''EastEnders'' was looking to cast a boy of his age, fitting his description. Spencer's mother, Jo Dufficy, sent in a photo and said the programme's makers liked what they saw. He filmed his scenes over three days in August 2010. His father Trevor said, &quot;This was a wonderful experience for Shay and everyone thought he did a great job, especially as this was his first acting role. He [...] was a little bit nervous at first but the cast of ''EastEnders'' were really good and made him feel welcome. At the end of filming he received a big round of applause from the cast and crew. We are really excited about seeing him on TV.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thecomet.net/news/letchworth_youngster_to_appear_in_eastenders_1_684090|title=Letchworth youngster to appear in EastEnders|last=Gill|first=Nick|date=19 October 2010|work=The Comet|accessdate=20 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the choir's performance on Christmas Eve, Edward collects money for the church organ and becomes friends with Dot. He asks Dot if she could help collect the money to buy a new organ and she accepts. He collects the collection money form the Launderette, leaving a note that gets lost, and plays at [[#James Branning and Tommy Moon|Tommy Moon]]'s funeral. He later visits Dot when she applies for community meals for her husband [[Jim Branning]] ([[John Bardon]]). He upsets Dot by bringing Jim the wrong food, but then reveals that he has been asked to stop volunteering because he spends too much time playing dominoes with clients instead of just delivering food. Dot then successfully helps Edward get his job back.

When Edward takes Jim to the park and the bookmakers, she is angry, feeling it could affect Jim's health. She later forgives him and he brings her a tape of old music. When [[Carol Jackson]] ([[Lindsey Coulson]]) calls Edward Dot's &quot;fancy man&quot;, she is annoyed and later tells Edward she does not want him there anymore, other than to bring Jim his meals. When community meals are cancelled, Fatboy, Mercy and Kim bring Dot lots of food, so Edward arrives and throws them out. Edward leaves after taking Dot to the pub, and says he does not know when he will see her again. He visits Dot after buying flowers from Walford market to take to his wife's grave. They go to an over-60s film night at [[The Queen Victoria]], and Edward tells Dot about his former lover, Betty, whom he met years ago and Dot tells him that she will help him find her on the internet. Dot contacts Betty via email and Betty then contacts Edward and they agree to meet. Dot hires a new carer, [[Marta Demboski]] (Magdalena Kurek) when Marta asks Edward why Dot is treating her badly, Edward sorts it out. Edward organises tea at the Ritz with Betty, but cancels so he can go with Dot. However, Dot has to cancel because Jim is returning home unexpectedly. Edward visits Dot again and invites her to watch a film at home. While they watch, Edward holds Dot's hand, but she pulls away. He admits that he likes her but she says she is married, so thanks Edward for the nice things he has done but tells him to leave and never return. The next day he calls her several times but she tells him to stop. He arrives on Albert Square to talk to Dot and she agrees to hear him out, but she ends up telling him again to leave her alone.

However, Charlie joins a party downstairs in [[The Queen Victoria]] public house.

When Kat sees the baby in hospital, she refuses to believe it is Tommy as he looks different, but Alfie convinces her it is because he has died. When a midwife visits Ronnie, she is surprised at how quickly James's [[club foot]] appears to have gone. Ronnie is denied access to the funeral by Kat but goes anyway, hiding behind a tree. She later realises she has to put an end to the situation and takes Tommy back to Kat during the wake. Ronnie's attempts to explain that the baby is Tommy are all misunderstood and Kat demands that the baby be taken away from her.

Ronnie continues to care for Tommy but starts behaving erratically. She later returns to the hospital where she gave birth and meets her midwife, [[#Diane McLean|Diane McLean]] (Hannah Kew), and realises she has to give Tommy back to Kat immediately. She tells Jack that the baby is not his son, and then explains to Kat what happened on the night James died. Kat refuses to believe it but takes Tommy, while Ronnie hands herself into the police. Jack says an emotion goodbye the next day as he hands Tommy over to social services. Alfie is interviewed by a social worker, but Kat leaves the hospital unable to cope. However, [[Jean Slater]] ([[Gillian Wright]]) tells Kat that it is a miracle that Tommy is alive, so Kat returns to the hospital to be interviewed, and they are reunited with Tommy. Although Kat struggles to bond with Tommy at first, and refuses to say his name, she soon adjusts and she and Alfie have Tommy Christened.

In September 2010, [[Shane Richie]], who plays Kat's husband [[Alfie Moon]], teased an upcoming storyline involving Alfie and Kat.

Executive producer [[Bryan Kirkwood (producer)|Bryan Kirkwood]] said of the baby swap storyline: &quot;This story built on the rich history both characters have built up over the years and the story team have worked hard to make this convincing and powerful. Although ''EastEnders'' is a fictional drama we have, of course, taken great care to thoroughly research this storyline, which will reflect a issue close to the hearts of some of our audience. We're fortunate to have two wonderful actresses, Jessie Wallace and Samantha Womack, who understand the need to portray such an emotive subject sensitively. Viewers will know that Ronnie has had a difficult past, losing both her daughter and father in the last couple of years. When she loses the one thing she's always wanted, she acts on impulse in a moment of sheer grief and desperation.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Confirmed&quot;&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a287462/eastenders-confirms-tragic-baby-plot.html|title='EastEnders' confirms tragic baby plot|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|date=12 November 2010|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=21 November 2010|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kirkwood later said the scenes would be believable and the storyline bold and gritty.
