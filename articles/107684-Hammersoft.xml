==History==
The South Gate area was inhabited by the [[Gabrielino]]/[[Tongva people|Tongva]] Indians before development by Spanish ranchers.  Spaniards have been living in this area of California since the mid-16th century.  Among the early Spanish settlers was one of Californiaâs first families, the [[Lugo]]s.  In the summer of 1769, a group of Spanish explorers set out from the coast of San Diego to explore the uncharted territory between San Diego and the Bay of Monterey. With them was Father Juan Crespi, considered by historians to be one of the great diarists of the new world explorations. His daily entries were remarkably revealing of the country through which the caravan passed. They proceeded in the general direction of the San Gabriel Valley, across the Los Angeles River, which Crespi named &quot;Porciuncula&quot; on August 2, 1769.  There would be no history of South Gate without including the story of the Lugo Spanish Land Grant. That grant encompassed a great part of what is now the City of South Gate and is a vital and colorful part of this area's history.  While stationed at [[Mission San Antonio de Padua]] near [[Salinas]], California, Francisco Lugoâs first California son, Antonio Maria Lugo was born in 1775.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bell.k12.ca.us/decades/history/timeline.htm |title=Timeline |publisher=Bell.k12.ca.us |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That son became Don Antonio Maria Lugo, Spanish aristocrat and  soldier, who settled on {{convert|30000|acre|km2}} of land that encompasses what is now the City of South Gate.  In 1810, the King of Spain formally granted the land to Lugo, the land grant was a reward for his and his father's military service to the crown.&lt;ref name=&quot;autogenerated1&quot;/&gt; Rancho San Antonio extended from the low range of hills which separated it from the San Gabriel Valley to the old Dominguez Ranch at its south, and from the eastern boundary of the pueblo of Los Angeles to the San Gabriel River. Lugo also became the mayor of a little town called [[Los Angeles]], from 1816â1819,&lt;ref&gt;http://score.rims.k12.ca.us/score_lessons/foot_prinOn April 6, 2000, the Bell House was dedicated as a California State Historical Resource.ts/Files/lugo_era_history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

A little more than 100 years after the establishment of the Lugo Land Grant, the area at the south gate of the ranch became the City of South Gate. As Don Lugo's family grew, he obtained San Bernardino Rancho and other grants in his children's names.

The future South Gate site and adjacent mesas presented a colorful spectacle when countless heads of cattle and horses were herded from all directions to a common point for the annual great spring rodeo. Lugo would direct the proceedings and settle disputes regarding ownership of contested animals as well as adjudicate agricultural disputes. In his saddle, he was the court and the plains his courtroom.

The Land Grant was handed down from generation to generation, dividing among offspring and eventually parceled and sold to people outside the Lugo family.
Don Antonio's son Vincente (1820â1889) built his adobe dwelling in the 1850s on {{convert|5.5|acre|m2}}. It is known as Lugo Ranch, and is situated on modern day Gage Avenue in the City of Bell Gardens.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogate.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/Detail/CID/67/NavID/34/ |title=South Gate -The Early Years |publisher=Sogate.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the end of the 1870s, much of the original land grant had been replaced by tracts of {{convert|40|acre|m2|adj=on}}. By 1880, cattle raising had been replaced by agriculture as the most important local industry. During the years between 1910 and 1940, most of the agricultural land was replaced by homes and factories. Today, with the land divided by freeways, it is difficult to imagine those early centuries  when it was a vast plain stretching from the mountains to the sea.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The R.D. Tweedy family has played an important part in South Gate's history. Mr. Tweedy was born in 1812 in Illinois, and came to California by ox-drawn cart in 1852. Mrs. Tweedy rode across the prairies perched on her rocking chair in the ox cart. The family was large, and several generations have lived in this city. The family members bought some {{convert|2000|acre|km2}} of the land on which much of South Gate was built. The &quot;downtown business district&quot; in South Gate was named after the family and is known as the Tweedy Mile.&lt;ref name=&quot;ReferenceA&quot;/&gt;

The city was named in 1918 after the South Gate Gardens on the [[Cudahy, California#History|Cudahy Ranch]].&lt;ref name=California&gt;{{cite book|last=Gudde|first=Erwin Gustav|coauthors= William Bright|title=California Place Names: The Origin and Etymology of Current Geographical Names|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=2004|page=371|isbn= 9780520242173}}&lt;/ref&gt; The city was incorporated five years later, in 1923, using the shortened form of the name.&lt;ref name=California/&gt; The name refers to the city's being south of Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=California/&gt;

===Demographics history===
South Gate developed during the 1920s and 1930s as an industrial city (primarily in &quot;metal-bashing&quot; industries) and its blue-collar community was predominantly non-Hispanic white.

During the 1940s and 1950s, South Gate was one of the most fiercely segregationist cities in Southern California.  [[Gangs]] of white youths were known to prowl the streets looking for blacks who dared to cross over from neighboring [[Watts, Los Angeles, California|Watts]]. One of the most infamous clubs of the area at that time was the &quot;[[Spook Hunters]]&quot;.

The next year South Gate began to change. In August 1965, the Watts riots erupted. Watts was virtually 100 percent black, and South Gate, immediately to the east of Watts, was nearly 100 percent white. Although the rioters were mostly confined to black areas of south-central Los Angeles and did not cross the line into South Gate, younger whites in South Gate started to look elsewhere to buy their first houses. As the white population of South Gate began to decline, the Mexican population, which earlier had established a foothold, began to increase.

Since the 1970s, South Gate has had a large [[Hispanic]] community, which became dominant in the 1990s as working-class [[Hispanics]] and immigrant Latin American families filled the vacuum left by [[white flight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amconmag.com/article/2003/may/19/00015/ |title=The American Conservative - South Gate: Mexico Comes to California |publisher=Amconmag.com |date=2003-05-19 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====City Treasurer====

*Maria Belen Bernal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sogate.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/nav/navid/35/ |title=City Treasurer &amp;#124; City of South Gate |publisher=Sogate.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scandal and corruption====
From 2001 to 2003, then-city treasurer, [[Albert Robles]], along with three accomplices on the city council, accepted bribes and in turn gave taxpayer dollars to friends and relatives to perform city contracts. The three accomplices formed a majority of the five member city council, so they could effectively run the city any way they wanted. For example, in 2002, Robles was arrested on felony threat charges but was appointed by the city council to the deputy city manager position and had his legal bills covered by the city. The city council gave themselves a 2000% pay raise, and cut the pay of [[city clerk]] Carmen Avalos by 90%, after she complained about corruption and election fraud in the city to the California State Secretary.&lt;ref name = &quot;McGrath&quot;&gt;
