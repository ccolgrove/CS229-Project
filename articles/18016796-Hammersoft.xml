{{Firefox TOC}}

'''Mozilla Firefox 4''' is a version of the [[Firefox]] [[web browser]], released on 22 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2011/03/21/firefox_4_release_candidate_2/ Channelreigster.co.uk]&lt;/ref&gt; The first [[Beta (software)|beta]] was made available on 6 July 2010; Release Candidate 2 (a base for the final version) was released on 18 March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

There was one security update in April 2011 (4.0.1) and version 4 of the browser was made obsolete by the release of [[Firefox 5]] in June 2011.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld&quot; /&gt;

This marked a transition to giving much less weight to major version numbers, with 5 more major version numbers used by September of that year (5,6,7,8, and 9), compared to 4 in nearly a decade of Firefox development (1,2,3,4). 

==History==
{{expand-section|date=April 2011}}
On 13 October 2006, [[Brendan Eich]], Mozilla's [[Chief technical officer|Chief Technology Officer]], wrote about the plans for &quot;Mozilla 2&quot;, referring to the most comprehensive iteration since its creation of the overall platform on which Firefox and other Mozilla products run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://weblogs.mozillazine.org/roadmap/archives/2006/10/mozilla_2.html | title=Mozilla 2 | last=Eich | first=Brendan | date=13 October 2006 | accessdate=16 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these objectives were incorporated into versions 3.0, 3.5, and 3.6. The largest changes, however, were deferred to Firefox 4.0.

In early May 2010, Mozilla's plans for Firefox 4.0 were officially detailed through a blog post by Mike Beltzner, Firefox director.&lt;ref name=&quot;Firefox 4 fast&quot; /&gt;

On 25 May 2011, the Firefox release manager wrote in an email &quot;Firefox 5 will be the security update for Firefox 4,&quot; confirming Firefox 4 had entered its &quot;[[End-of-life (product)|end of life]]&quot; phase where Mozilla will no longer issue updates.  Mozilla continued to issue updates for Firefox 3.6 after 4's EOL declaration.  Only one update (4.0.1) was issued for Firefox 4 during its lifetime. Many looking for a copy of this version 4 will be directed to version 6 which won't work on earlier Mac Apple computers.&lt;ref name=&quot;computerworld&quot;&gt;http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9217837/Mozilla_retires_Firefox_4_from_security_support&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Mozilla Firefox 4 includes many new features since [[Firefox 3.6|version 3.6]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===User interface===

Firefox 4 brings a new [[user interface]], with a new look designed to make it faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{jargon|date=June 2011}}
New features include improved &quot;doorhanger&quot; notifications, Firefox Panorama (a feature that lets the user organize tabs into windows called &quot;groups&quot; and perform various operations on groups),{{clarify|date=June 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.azarask.in/blog/post/designing-tab-candy/ |title= Firefox Panorama: Tab Candy Evolved |author= [[Aza Raskin]] |accessdate=11 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; application tabs, a redesigned extension manager,&lt;ref name=&quot;Firefox 4 release plan&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20004620-264.html |title= Firefox 4 release plan: The need for speed |author= Stephen Shankland |publisher= cnet |date= 11 May 2010 |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mozilla Jetpack|Jetpack]] extensions support, integration with [[Firefox Sync]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mozillalabs.com/sync/2010/08/24/sync-in-firefox-4-beta/ |title= Sync in Firefox 4 Beta |publisher= [[Mozilla Labs]] |date= 24 August 2010 |accessdate=11 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and support for [[multitouch]] displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20006239-264.html |title= Mozilla prepares coders for Firefox 4 features |author= Stephen Shankland |publisher= cnet |date= 28 May 2010 |accessdate=28 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many changes were made to the user interface. By default, tabs are now on the top of the window.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mozilla.com/faaborg/2010/06/24/why-tabs-are-on-top-in-firefox-4/ Why Tabs are on Top in Firefox 4 Â« Alex Faaborg]. Blog.mozilla.com (24 June 2010). Retrieved on 8 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The &quot;stop&quot; &quot;reload&quot; and &quot;go&quot; buttons have been combined into a single button, placed on the right side of the address bar. The button changes dynamically based upon the current state of the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/4.0_Windows_Theme_Mockups|title=Firefox/4.0 Windows Theme Mockups â MozillaWiki |date= 27 July 2009 |accessdate=10 August 2009 |publisher= Mozilla}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows 7]], the [[menu bar]] is hidden by default with the most common actions moved to a new &quot;Firefox&quot; menu in the upper left hand corner of the browser. Users can create persistent &quot;app tabs&quot;, and customize the [[Tab (GUI)|tab]] bar, as well as the [[bookmark]] and navigation bars.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

===Engine===
Firefox 4 is based on the [[Gecko (layout engine)|Gecko]] 2.0 engine, which adds and improves support for [[HTML5]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/05/firefox-4-the-html5-parser-inline-svg-speed-and-more/ |title=Firefox 4 HTML 5 parser |author=Henri Sivonen |date=11 May 2010 |accessdate=11 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CSS3]], [[WebM]], and [[WebGL]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Firefox 4 fast&quot; /&gt; Also, it includes a new JavaScript engine ([[JÃ¤gerMonkey]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/03/a-quick-note-on-javascript-engine-components/ | title = a quick note on JavaScript engine components | author = Christopher Blizzard | date = 8 March 2010 | accessdate =19 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and better [[XPCOM]] APIs.

[[JÃ¤gerMonkey]] is a new [[JavaScript engine]] designed to work alongside the [[TraceMonkey]] engine introduced with Firefox 3.5. It improves performance by compiling &quot;non-traceable&quot; JavaScript into machine language for faster execution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blog.mozilla.com/dmandelin/2010/02/26/starting-jagermonkey/ |title= Starting JÃ¤gerMonkey |author= David Mandelin |date= 26 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefox 4 is the first version of Firefox to drop native support of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher protocol]]; however, continued support is available through an [[Add-on (Mozilla)|add-on]].&lt;ref name=&quot;gopher_support&quot;&gt;{{cite web |url= https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Firefox_4_for_developers#Other_changes_2 |title= Firefox 4 for Developers â MDC |date= 25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefox 4 introduces an audio [[API]], which provides a way to programmatically access or create audio data associated with a HTML5 audio element.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wiki.mozilla.org/Audio_Data_API|title=Audio Data API|publisher=Mozilla|date=25 August 2010|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows, for example, to visualize raw sound data, to use filters or to show the audio spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/60496/20100908/mozilla-firefox-4-beta-api-browser.htm|title=Firefox 4 beta flaunts audio API to create music visuals|author=IB Times Staff Reporter|publisher=International Business Times|date=8 September 2010|accessdate=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firefox 4 no longer relies on the underlying OS for text layout/shaping. Instead, it uses [[HarfBuzz]]. This allows for smart OpenType layout/shaping which is consistent across different operating systems.

===Performance===
Firefox 4 has marked a major change in performance in comparison to former versions 3.6 and 3.5. The browser has made significant progress in [[SunSpider|Sunspider]] JavaScript tests as well as improvements in supporting HTML5.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2010/11/10/fasten-your-seatbelts-latest-firefox-4-beta-boosts-speed-in-the-browser/ |title= Fasten Your Seatbelts â Firefox 4 Beta adds new JavaScript power and faster graphics |author= jsullivan |date= 10 November 2010 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since Firefox 4.0 Beta 5, [[hardware acceleration]] of content is enabled by default on Windows Vista and Windows 7 machines using [[Direct2D]], on OS X using Quartz (basically CPU-only), and Linux using [[XRender]]. Hardware acceleration of compositing is enabled by default on XP, Vista and 7 machines using [[Direct3D]], OS X and Linux using [[OpenGL]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hacks.mozilla.org/2010/09/hardware-acceleration/|title=Firefox 4: hardware acceleration|publisher=Mozilla|date=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using hardware acceleration allows the browser to tap into the computer's [[graphics processing unit]], lifting the burden from the [[CPU]] and speeding up the display of web pages.  Acceleration is only enabled for certain graphics hardware and drivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mozilla.com/bjacob/2011/03/04/upgrade-your-graphics-drivers/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Privacy===
Firefox 4 contains support for the [[do not track header|&quot;do not track&quot; header]], an emerging standard for Web privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mossberg|first=Walt|title=New, Lean Firefox 4: Re-Built to Play Catch-Up|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704471904576230923249332158.html?mod=googlenews_wsj|accessdate=31 March 2011|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=31 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The header signals the user's request to the web service that any [[web visitor tracking]] service be disabled. In the future, this privacy request may become a legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Valentino-DeVries|first=Jennifer|title=Firefox Maker: 'Do Not Track' Likely to Be Regulated|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/03/14/firefox-maker-do-not-track-likely-to-be-regulated/?mod=google_news_blog|publisher=Wall Street Journal Blogs|accessdate=31 March 2011|date=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
Nightly builds were marked as 4.0a1pre between February and June 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2008/02/2008-02-20-02-mozilla-central/ FTP.Mozilla.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/firefox/nightly/2008/06/2008-06-06-02-actionmonkey/ FTP.Mozilla.org]&lt;/ref&gt; but were renamed to 3.1a1pre&lt;!--It was not 3.7a1pre in 2008.--&gt; afterwards.

==Reception==
{{Firefox usage share}}
&lt;!-- Please don't use http://glow.mozilla.org as a reference by itself. It doesn't record when it displayed what so it can't be used as a verifiable reference by itself. --&gt;
{{Copyedit|section|date=March 2011}}
During the 24-hour launch period starting on 22 March 2011, Firefox 4 was downloaded 7.1 million times as counted by Mozilla's download stats site glow.mozilla.org and verified by Mozilla.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpw&quot;/&gt; Before the official launch, more than 3 million people had downloaded the second release candidate, which became the final version,&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.mozilla.com/blog/2011/03/23/firefox-four-day-one/ Blog.mozilla.com]&lt;/ref&gt; resulting in a total of over 10 million downloads by the end of the launch day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2036733/mozilla-confirms-million-firefox-downloads-hours The Inquirer.net]&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the number of downloads for the first 24 hours, it failed to surpass the record-setting 8 million downloads attained by [[Firefox 3]] in 2008. Downloads for the second day, however, were reported to be over 8.75 million in number, but because no on-site official from [[Guinness World Record|Guinness]] was there to monitor the numbers, the record attained by Firefox 3 has only unofficially been broken.&lt;ref name=&quot;cpw&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last=Keizer|first=Gregg|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9215243/Firefox_4_sets_unofficial_download_record|title=Firefox 4 sets unofficial download record|publisher=Computer World|date=27 March 2011|accessdate=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Usage share===
{{seealso|Usage share of web browsers}}
Usage share on official launch day was 1.95%, which is 0.34% higher than the day before according to website analytics company StatCounter. 

For comparison, [[Internet Explorer 9]] usage share on 22 March 2011 was 0.87%,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gs.statcounter.com/press/firefox-4-hits-the-ground-running-and-eclipses-internet-explorer-9 GS.statcounter.com]&lt;/ref&gt; having launched about a week before on 14 March 2011. One potential reason for Firefox 4's higher usage share is the support for Windows XP and Windows 2000, which Internet Explorer 9 does not have.

However, at launch, Firefox enacted a method to prompt existing customers to upgrade, while IE users have not been prompted in such a manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowsteamblog.com/ie/b/ie/archive/2011/03/29/a-thoughtful-approach-to-measuring-browser-adoption.aspx | title=A thoughtful approach to measuring browser adoption |date=2011mar29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, Microsoft prompts IE users to upgrade via [[Windows Update]] several weeks after launch.

On 26 March 2011, Firefox 4 usage share exceeded the discontinued, 10 year old [[Internet Explorer 6]] for the first time. On that date, 4 days after official launch day, Firefox 4 usage share was greater than that of all versions of [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] and [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]] as well as all older versions of Firefox except [[Firefox 3.6]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://gs.statcounter.com/#browser_version-ww-daily-20110326-20110326-bar&lt;/ref&gt; For comparison, Internet Explorer 9 usage share first exceeded that of Internet Explorer 6 on 1 May 2011 (48 days after release) and Internet Explorer 9 became the second most used Internet Explorer version for the first time on 22 May 2011 (69 days after release).

On the 19 June 2011 Firefox 4 reached its peak at 16.7% according to StatCounter. After that date, usage declined slightly due to weekly trends then dropped quickly due the release of [[Firefox 5]].

The Firefox button, which has a new look, &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mozilla Firefox 4 Release Notes|url=http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/4.0/releasenotes/|publisher=Mozilla Firefox|accessdate=23 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;   groups the menus in Firefox 4. It is displayed by default on the Windows 7 and Windows Vista operating systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/4.0/releasenotes/ | title=Firefox 4.0 release notes | accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can be displayed on other operating systems by selecting &quot;Toolbars&quot; from the View menu and unchecking &quot;Menu Bar&quot;. The Menu bar can be restored by selecting &quot;Options&quot; from the Firefox button menu and checking &quot;Menu Bar&quot;. Certain menu items, such as &quot;Page Info&quot; and &quot;Import&quot; (for importing bookmarks and other browser data), are not available from the Firefox button menu but remain available from the Menu bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/Page%20Info%20window?s=page+info&amp;as=s | title=Firefox Help: Page Info window | accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Menu bar can be displayed temporarily by pressing and releasing the Alt key.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.howto-guidebook.com/how-to-import-bookmarks-into-firefox-4 | title=howto-guidebook.com: Bookmark import guide | accessdate=3 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Selecting a Menu bar command or pressing the Alt key again dismisses the Menu bar.

===Session data===

A prompt to save the session (tabs and windows) was presented by default in Firefox 3, with the session restored on next start if the user selected the &quot;Save &amp; Quit&quot; option. In Firefox 4, all sessions are saved. On next start, the session is available from the History menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://groups.google.com/group/mozilla.dev.apps.firefox/msg/025ea6c5ff307346?hl=en | title=Mozilla Firefox Developer Forum | accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new feature, called on-demand session restore, overwrites the previous session on exit without prompting.  The user can check whether there is a saved session at any time by viewing the History menu item &quot;Restore Previous Session&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blog.zpao.com/post/1099464627/restore-previous-session | title=Blog post by Firefox developer Paul OâShannessy | accessdate=1 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; If it is available (not greyed out) there is a restorable session available.
