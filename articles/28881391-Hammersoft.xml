A failed two point conversion attempt by the Golden Tornadoes left Greenville ahead. A successful stand by the Golden Tornado Defense, led by Brian Wilson, gave the ball back to Geneva with 2:12 remaining.

=== The Drive ===

The Golden Tornadoes' final possession of the 2009 season began on their own 3&amp;nbsp;yard line, with 2:12 remaining in the game. Junior quarterback [[David Girardi]] completed a first down pass to Barge for a ten yard gain. Three incomplete passes resulted in a 4th and 10 for Geneva from their own 13&amp;nbsp;yard line. Heavy pass rush caused Girardi to scramble from the pocket who then completed a pass to Barge for a gain of 10 and a first down. Another pass to Barge, this time for 14&amp;nbsp;yards moved the ball out to Geneva's 37&amp;nbsp;yard line. A short gain on a pass by Girardi to Thurston moved the ball out to Geneva's 41&amp;nbsp;yard line. The Golden Tornadoes then relied &quot;900 Saint Vincent&quot; for a 47&amp;nbsp;yard gain down to Greenville's 12&amp;nbsp;yard line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneva.edu/object/nr_victory_bowl_11_09 900 Saint Vincent] 900 Saint Vincent&lt;/ref&gt; The play called for Girardi to take a few steps towards Geneva's bench, asking for a new play. The ball was then directly snapped to running back Matt Barge who then lateralled the ball back to Girardi. Girardi then completed a deep post to Nuetzel for a huge gain. Geneva gained 8 more yards on two short passes to Dean and Thurston. A final incomplete pass led to a 4-2 at Greenville's 3&amp;nbsp;yard line when Nick Dipietro kicked the game winning field goal with :19&amp;nbsp;seconds left in the game.
