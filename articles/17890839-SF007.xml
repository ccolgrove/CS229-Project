* Canonical supplies some of the core engineering to [[Linaro]] which invests in upstream projects.

==Business plans==

In a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' interview in May 2008, Mark Shuttleworth said that the Canonical business model was service provision and explained that Canonical was not yet close to profitability. Canonical also claimed it will wait for the business to turn into a profitable one within another 3 to 5 years. He regarded Canonical as positioning itself as demand for services related to Free Software rose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Moody|first=Glyn|authorlink=Glyn Moody|title='Linux is a platform for people, not just specialists'|date=2008-05-22|accessdate=2008-05-23|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2008/may/22/internet.software|publisher=[[The Guardian]] | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy has been compared to [[Red Hat]]'s business strategies in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;model&quot;/&gt; However, in an early 2009 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, Shuttleworth said that Canonical's revenue was &quot;creeping&quot; towards $30 million, the company's break-even point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/11/business/11ubuntu.html |title=A Software Populist Who Doesnât Do Windows |publisher=The New York Times |date=2009-01-11 |accessdate=2010-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Canonical launched an International online shop selling support services and Ubuntu branded goods; later in 2008 expanding it with a United States-specific shop designed to reduce shipment times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubuntu.com/news/us-based-shop|title=Canonical launches U.S.-based shop.ubuntu.com in time for holiday season|publisher=Canonical Ltd.|date=2008-11-18|accessdate=2009-02-09|quote=an U.S.-based on-line shop for Ubuntu-branded merchandise and software. With a new fulfillment house in St. Louis, Missouri, shipments are faster and less expensive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the same time, the word ''Ubuntu'' was trademarked in connection with clothing and accessories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipo.gov.uk/ohim?ohimnum=E7426265|title=UK registered trademark #E7426265|publisher=[[UK Intellectual Property Office]]|date=2008-11-27|accessdate=2009-02-09|quote=Mark text: UBUNTU ...
