'''Verizon South, Inc.''' is a [[Verizon]] operating company providing local telephone services to portions of [[Virginia]] and [[North Carolina]] in the [[United States]].

==History==
Verizon South was originally established in [[1947]] as '''The Bluefield Telephone Corporation''', providing telephone service to communities in [[Virginia]] including its namesake [[Bluefield, Virginia|Bluefield]]. The company's first president was [[R.A. Phillips]] and was formally incorporated by [[Judson Large]], [[Dean A. Esling]], [[Richard L. Merrick]], [[William W. Darrow]], and [[Roland K. Smith, Jr.]] 

The company changed its name to '''Bluefield Telephone Company''' on [[January 16]], [[1948]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Filings.aspx?PItemId=4827739 Corporate Filings for: Verizon South, Inc., Application for Certificate of Authority, North Carolina Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acquisition by GTE===
Bluefield Telephone was acquired by [[GTE]] and in [[1954]] changed its name to '''General Telephone Company of the Southeast''' on [[June 25]], [[1954]]. The company began expansion under GTE ownership, absorbing a large group of telephone companies acquired in [[1957]]. These companies included '''Durham Telephone Company''' of [[North Carolina]], '''Georgia Continental Telephone Company''', '''South Carolina Continental Telephone Company''', '''Southeastern Carolina Telephone Company''', '''Southern Continental Telephone Company''', and '''Sumter Telephone Company'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Filings.aspx?PItemId=4827739 Corporate Filings for: Verizon South, Inc., Articles of Merger, October 8, 1957, North Carolina Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1970]], the company absorbed more [[GTE]] companies, including '''General Telephone Company of Georgia''', '''General Telephone Company of North Carolina''', '''Mutual Telephone Company, Inc.''', and '''Pee Dee Telephone Company, Inc.'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secretary.state.nc.us/corporations/Filings.aspx?PItemId=4827739 Corporate Filings for: Verizon South, Inc., Articles of Merger, November 6, 1970, North Carolina Secretary of State]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[1986]], the company changed its name to '''General Telephone Company of the South''', later shortening in [[1988]] to '''GTE South Incorporated'''. At this point, GTE South served [[Alabama]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Tennessee]], [[Virginia]], and [[West Virginia]].

In 1993, GTE traded GTE South's Georgia operations with [[Alltel]]'s [[Illinois]] operations.

In 1994, GTE sold its operations in West Virginia ([[Citizens Telecommunications Company of West Virginia|Citizens of West Virginia]]) and Tennessee to Citizens Communications (which later became [[Frontier Communications]]). GTE also acquired [[Contel]], and '''Contel of Kentucky''', '''Contel of North Carolina''', '''Contel of South Carolina''', and '''Contel of Virginia''' were legally merged into GTE South.

===Acquisition by Verizon===
In 2000, [[Bell Atlantic]] bought [[GTE]], forming [[Verizon]]. GTE South was then renamed '''Verizon South, Inc.'''

In 2002, [[Verizon]] sold its operations in Alabama to [[CenturyTel]], becoming [[CenturyTel of Alabama]]. [[Verizon]] also sold its operations in Kentucky to [[Alltel]], becoming '''Kentucky ALLTEL, Inc.''' (who later spun off its wireline operations as [[Windstream Communications|Windstream]] and the company becoming '''Windstream Kentucky East LLC''').

====Split====
In 2010, operations in southern Illinois, southern Wisconsin, North Carolina (with the exception of [[Knotts Island, North Carolina|Knotts Island]]), and South Carolina were included in a sale of Verizon assets, placed under the ownership of [[Frontier Communications ILEC Holdings]], to [[Frontier Communications]]. The operations in those states became [[Frontier Communications of the Carolinas]].

===Today===
Verizon South remains a current operating company of Verizon serving former GTE and Contel regions in [[Virginia]] and [[Knotts Island, North Carolina]].
