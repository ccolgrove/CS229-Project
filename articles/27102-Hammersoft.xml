Retrieved April 4, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show was created by [[Rick Berman]], [[Michael Piller]], and [[Jeri Taylor]] and is the fourth incarnation of ''Star Trek'', which began with the 1960s series ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'', created by [[Gene Roddenberry]]. It was produced for seven seasons, from 1995 to 2001, and is the only Star Trek series with a female captain, [[Kathryn Janeway]], as a lead character. 

''Voyager'' aired on [[UPN]] and was the network's second longest-running series.

==Production==
''Voyager'' was produced to launch [[UPN]], a television network planned by [[Paramount Pictures|Paramount]]. This was the second time that Paramount had considered launching a network anchored by a ''Star Trek'' show: the studio planned to launch a network showcasing ''[[Star Trek: Phase II]]'' in 1977. 

Initial work on ''Voyager'' started in 1993, and seeds for the show's backstory, including the development of the [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]], were placed in several ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episodes. ''Voyager'' was shot on the stages ''The Next Generation'' had used and the pilot, &quot;[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]&quot;, was shot in October 1994. Around that time, Paramount was sold to [[Viacom]], making ''Voyager'' the first ''Star Trek'' TV series to premiere after the sale concluded.

''Voyager'' was also the first ''Star Trek'' TV show to eliminate the use of models for exterior space shots and exclusively use [[computer-generated imagery]] (CGI) instead.  Other television shows such as ''[[seaQuest DSV]]'' and ''[[Babylon 5]]'' had previously used CGI exclusively to avoid the huge expense of models, but the ''Star Trek'' television department continued using models, because they felt models provided better realism.  Amblin Imaging won an Emmy for the opening CGI title visuals, but the weekly episode exteriors were captured using hand-built miniatures of the ''Voyager'', shuttlecraft, and other ships.  That changed when ''Star Trek: Voyager'' went fully CGI for certain types of shots midway through Season 3 (late 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thelogbook.com/jcc/q3-04/voyager3/ |title=DVD Reviews â Star Trek Voyager Season 3 |publisher=Thelogbook.com |date=2009-06-10 |accessdate=2009-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Paramount obtained an exclusive contract with [[Foundation Imaging]], the studio responsible for special effects during ''[[Babylon 5]]'s'' first three seasons.  Season 3's &quot;The Swarm&quot; was the first episode to use Foundation's effects exclusively. ''Deep Space Nine'' started using Foundation Imaging in conjunction with Digital Muse one year later (season 6). In its later seasons, ''Voyager'' featured visual effects from Foundation and Digital Muse.

== Plot overview ==
{{See also|List of Star Trek: Voyager episodes}}

In the pilot episode, &quot;[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]&quot;, USS ''Voyager'' departs station ''[[Deep Space Nine (space station)|Deep Space Nine]]'' on a mission into the treacherous [[List of Star Trek regions of space#Badlands|Badlands]] to find a missing ship piloted by a team of [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] rebels, which the [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] Lt. [[Tuvok]], ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s security officer, has secretly infiltrated.  Suddenly, the starship is enveloped by a powerful energy wave, which ends up damaging the ship, killing several of its crew, and stranding the ship on the far side of the galaxy, more than 70,000 light-years from Earth.

''Voyager'' eventually finds the Maquis ship, and the two crews reluctantly agree they must join forces in order to survive their long journey home.  [[Chakotay]], leader of the Maquis group, becomes first officer.  [[B'Elanna Torres]], a half-human/half-[[Klingon]] Maquis, becomes chief engineer.  [[Tom Paris]], whom Janeway released from a Federation prison to help her find the Maquis ship, is made ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s helm officer.  Due to the deaths of the ship's entire medical staff, the [[Doctor (Star Trek)|The Doctor]], an Emergency Medical Hologram designed for only short-term use, is employed as the Chief Medical Officer. [[Neelix]], a Talaxian scavenger, and [[Kes (Star Trek)|Kes]], a young Ocampan, natives of the Delta Quadrant, are welcomed aboard as the ship's chef/morale officer, and The Doctor's medical assistant, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;http://memory-alpha.org/wiki/Caretaker_(episode)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the great distance from [[United Federation of Planets|Federation space]], the Delta Quadrant is unexplored and ''Voyager'' truly is going ''where no one has gone before''.  As the ship sets out on its projected 75-year journey home, the crew passes through regions belonging to various species indigenous to the Delta Quadrant, such as the barbaric and belligerent [[Kazon]]; the organ-harvesting, disease-ravaged [[Vidiian|Vidiians]]; the nomadic hunter-race the [[Hirogen]]; the fearsome, scorpion-like [[Species 8472]] from a fluid-space realm; and most notably the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]], as ''Voyager'' has to move through large areas of Borg-controlled space in later seasons.  They also encounter perilous natural phenomena such as a nebulous area called the Nekrit Expanse, a large area of empty space called the Void, [[wormhole]]s, dangerous [[nebula|nebulae]], and other anomalies.

However, ''Voyager'' does not always deal with the unknown.  It is the second ''Star Trek'' series to feature [[Q (Star Trek)|Q]] on a recurring basis (Q made only one appearance on ''Deep Space Nine''). Also [[Starfleet|Starfleet Command]] learns of ''Voyager''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s survival and situation, initially when the ship discovers an ancient interstellar communications network that ''Voyager'' taps into, and eventually after Starfleet develops a means to establish regular audiovisual and data contact with the ship thanks to the efforts of [[Reginald Barclay]], who was featured more prominently on ''The Next Generation''.

In the show's fourth season, Kes leaves the series after experiencing a transformation due to her increasing psionic abilities, while the crew grows to include [[Seven of Nine]], a [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] drone, assimilated as a six-year-old Human girl but liberated from the collective by the ''Voyager'' crew.  Seven begins to expand (or rather, regain) her humanity as the series progresses -- as does The Doctor, thanks in part to a mobile holo-emitter the crew obtains in the third season, which allows the Doctor to roam freely whereas he was previously confined to sickbay.  In the sixth season, the crew discovers a group of adolescent aliens assimilated by the Borg, but prematurely released from their maturation chambers due to a malfunction on their cube-ship.  As he did with Seven of Nine, The Doctor de-assimilates the children; [[List_of_minor_recurring_characters_in_Star_Trek:_Voyager#Azan.2C_Rebi_and_Mezoti|three of them]] eventually find a new adoptive home while the fourth, [[List_of_minor_recurring_characters_in_Star_Trek:_Voyager#Icheb|Icheb]], chooses to stay aboard ''Voyager''.

Life for the ''Voyager'' crew continued to change over their seven-year journey.  Traitors ([[List_of_minor_recurring_characters_in_Star_Trek:_Voyager#Seska|Seska]] and [[List_of_minor_recurring_characters_in_Star_Trek:_Voyager#Michael_Jonas|Jonas]]) were uncovered in the early months; loyal crew members were lost late in the journey; and other wayward Starfleet officers were integrated into the crew.  During the second season, the first child was born aboard the ship to Ensign Samantha Wildman; as she grew up, Naomi Wildman would become great friends with her godfather, Neelix.  Early in the seventh season, Tom Paris and B'Elanna Torres married after a long courtship, and Torres would give birth to their child in the series finale.  Late in the seventh season, the ship finds a colony of Talaxians on a makeshift settlement in an asteroid field, and Neelix chooses to bid ''Voyager'' farewell and live once again amongst his people.

Over the course of the series, the crew of Voyager find a number of ways to shorten their journey by a number of decades, thanks to shortcuts (in the episodes &quot;[[Night (Star Trek: Voyager)|Night]]&quot;, &quot;[[Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)|Q2]]&quot;), technology boosts (&quot;[[The Voyager Conspiracy (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Voyager Conspiracy]]&quot;, &quot;[[Dark Frontier]]&quot;, &quot;[[Timeless (Star Trek: Voyager)|Timeless]]&quot;, &quot;[[Hope and Fear]]&quot;), subspace corridors (&quot;[[Dragon's Teeth (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dragon's Teeth]]&quot;), and a mind-powered push from a powerful former shipmate (&quot;[[The Gift (Star Trek: Voyager)|The Gift]]&quot;).  There were also other transportation and time travel opportunities the crew were not able to use (&quot;[[Prime Factors (Star Trek: Voyager)|Prime Factors]]&quot;, &quot;[[Future's End]]&quot;). All these efforts shorten their journey from 75 years to 23 years, however one final effort (involving time travel) brings them home after 7 years as shown in the series finale, &quot;[[Endgame (Star Trek: Voyager)|Endgame]]&quot;.

The Maquis ship is destroyed while fighting the Kazon-Ogla, and although Voyager survives, there are numerous casualties. In order to protect an intelligent species (the Ocampa), Janeway destroys a device, the Caretaker Array, that has the potential to return her crew to Federation space, stranding her ship and crew seven decades' travel from home.

==Novels and novelizations==
{{Main|List of Star Trek: Voyager novels}}

A total of 22 numbered books were released during the series' original run from 1995-2001. They include novelizations of the first episode, ''[[Caretaker (Voyager episode)|Caretaker]], The Escape, Violations, Ragnarok'' and novelizations of the episodes ''[[Flashback (Star Trek: Voyager)|Flashback]]'', ''[[Day of Honor]]'', ''[[Equinox (Star Trek: Voyager)|Equinox]]'' and ''[[Endgame (Voyager episode)|Endgame]]''. There are also an amount of so called &quot;unnumbered books&quot;, which are still part of the series, though not part of the official release. These novels all consist of episode novelizations except for ''Caretaker'', ''Mosaic'' (a biography of [[Captain Kathryn Janeway]]), ''Pathways'' (a novel in which the biography of various crewmembers, including all of the senior staff is given); and ''The Nanotech War'', a novel released in 2002, one year after the series' finale.

===Book relaunch===
A series of novels focusing on the continuing adventures of ''Voyager'' following the TV series finale was implemented in 2003, much as [[Pocket Books]] did with the [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine relaunch|''Deep Space Nine'' relaunch novel series]], which features stories placed after the finale of that show. In the relaunch, several characters are reassigned while others are promoted but stay aboard ''Voyager'' These changes include Janeway's promotion to admiral, Chakotay becoming captain of ''Voyager'', Tuvok leaving the ship to serve as First Officer under William Riker, and Tom Paris' promotion to First Officer. The series also introduces several new characters.

The series began with ''[[List of Star Trek novels|Homecoming]]'' and ''[[The Farther Shore (Star Trek)|The Farther Shore]]'' in 2003, a direct sequel to the show's finale, ''Endgame''. These were followed in 2004 by ''Spirit Walk: Old Wounds'' and ''Spirit Walk: Enemy of My Enemy''. Under the direction of a new author, 2009 brought forth two more additions to the series: ''Full Circle'' and ''Unworthy'' . In 2011 another book by the same author called ''Children of the Storm'' was released. Other novels â some set during the relaunch period, others during the show's TV runâhave been published.
