'''Bluecurve''' is a [[desktop theme]] for [[GNOME]] and [[KDE]] created by the [[Red Hat]] Artwork project. The main aim of Bluecurve was to create a consistent look throughout the [[Linux]] environment, and provide support for various Freedesktop.org desktop standards. It has been used in [[Red Hat Linux]] since version 8.0, and [[Fedora (operating system)|Fedora Core]].

The Bluecurve [[window (computing)|window]] borders and [[GTK+]] ([[widget (computing)|widget]]) theme have been replaced by those from [[Clearlooks]] (the first in Fedora Core 4, the second in FC5). However, the old Bluecurve themes ([[Windowing system|windowing]] and [[GUI widget|widget]]) are still installed by default and can be selected in the theme manager. The Bluecurve [[icon (computing)|icon]] set remains installed in Fedora 7, but has been replaced as the default by [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Artwork/EchoIconTheme Echo].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Artwork|title=Artwork|work=Fedora Wiki|publisher=[[Fedora Project]]|accessdate=2006-10-21|date=2006-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been controversy surrounding the theme, especially the alterations to KDE, which were sufficiently severe as to cause developer [[Bernhard Rosenkraenzer]] to quit [[Red Hat]] &quot;mostly in mutual agreement â I don't want to work on crippling KDE, and they don't want an employee who admits RHL 8.0's KDE is [[crippleware]].&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lists.kde.org/?l=kde-devel&amp;m=103293985032408|date=2002-09-25|accessdate=2006-10-21|title=New address|last=Rosenkraenzer|first=Bernhard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|work=[[Slashdot]]|title=Bero Quits Red Hat Over Treatment of KDE|url=http://slashdot.org/linux/02/09/25/2042208.shtml|date=2002-09-25|accessdate=2006-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others simply criticize it for giving the same look to both desktops, even though they are obviously different in many ways. This approach was subsequently emulated by [[Mandrake Linux]] with their &quot;Galaxy&quot; theme, which was also available for GNOME and KDE, and in [[Kubuntu]] 6.06 with the [[GTK-Qt]] theme engine (enabled by default).{{Fact|date=May 2008}}

Enterprising [[Graphical user interface|GUI]] artists have created themes that emulate the Bluecurve theme on other operating systems, including [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Users can also replace their default Windows icons with icons that emulate Bluecurve, using the [[IconPackager]] application. One such set can be downloaded at [[WinCustomize]].
