'''Women Surrealists''' are women [[artists]], [[photographers]], [[filmmakers]] and [[authors]] of the [[Surrealism|Surrealist]] Movement which began in the early 1920s.  Many of them were part of, or connected to, the official [[Surrealist]] movement.  Others were inspired but more distantly connected.
