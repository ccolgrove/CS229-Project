'''''Armagetron Advanced''''' is a [[multiplayer]] game in 3D that attempts to emulate and expand on the [[light cycle]] sequence from the film ''[[Tron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web|url=http://armagetronad.net/|title=Armagetron advanced website|accessdate=2007-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is available for [[Linux]], [[Mac OS X]], [[Microsoft Windows]], [[AmigaOS 4]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Gameplay==
[[Image:Armagetron.png|thumb|Armagetron Advanced running in windowed mode.]]
Two or more players are represented by dual-wheeled motor vehicles, or [[light cycle]]s, in a grid-lined arena. The vehicles constantly move forward, leaving a coloured trail behind them as they travel. Contact with either the arena walls or a trail left by a player will result in death and elimination from the battle. Therefore, players attempt to &quot;box&quot; each other in order to force their opponents to touch their trail or one of the arena walls. Players can change the direction of movement, by turning 90 degrees to the left or right (though in some servers the number of axes is more than four, making it possible to turn 45 degrees, 180 degress, or none at all).

The closer a player is to a coloured trail, the faster his or her cycle will move. This allows players to accelerate and use the resulting speed advantage to outmaneuver their opponents. Players are able to use a brake - the 'v' key by default - to slow down, however the effectiveness of the brake varies from server to server. Some servers even implement a 'speed brake', which turns the brake key into an accelerator.

=== Game modes ===
{{prose|section|date=December 2010}}
Several game modes exist:
* Team Gauntlet: Two teams compete with each other on various generated maps.
** Wild Fortress: Objective is to conquer the opponents' zone while defending yours.
* Rotation: Two teams compete on various game modes.
* Death Match: Last man standing.
** No Rubber (NR): Played with no or one rubber. Touching a wall will result in instant death, making this a fast-paced game mode where players need fast reflexes.
** Low Rubber (LR): Played with an average of five to ten rubber.
** Medium Rubber (MR): Played with an average of ten to fifteen rubber.
** High Rubber (HR): Played with an average of fifteen to thirty rubber. And a speed of about 20-40
** Dog Fight (DF): Currently it is a mode that consists of slow bikes and medium rubber (around 10). In most DF servers, there are rules to trapping your opponent that is widely accepted throughout the armagetron advanced community, but is not completely defined. Yet you may not trap you opponent using a seal or stab. This is the only game type in which you are not 'allowed' to do certain things within the game, such as stabbing, although the server does not specifically restrict them.
* Team Death Match: Cooperate with teammates.
* Fortress: Capture the enemy base. This game can be played with teams or death match style.
* Sumo: The object is to stay in a zone while trying to force the opponent out, forcing their zone to collapse and then their cycle to explode.
* Race: Race to the win zone at the end of the map.
* Maze: Find a path to the win zone.
* Sty Patch (formerly Pig Sty):
** Shooting: A team death match where the object is to try to shoot the other team's players with death zones.
** StyBall: A team match where the object is to score a goal by pushing the ball zone into the goal zone. (quite similar to [[association football|football]])
** Capture the Flag (CTF): Capture the opponents' flag. Players are respawned if they are dead and a player (ally or opponent) touches the base on the respective side.
** Capture The Flag Shooting (CTFS): Capture the opponents' flag while shooting. Players are respawned if they are dead and a player (ally or opponent) touches the base on the respective side.
** Flag Fortress (FF): A fortress game with fortress physics with the objective being to capture the opponents flag. Players are respawned if they are dead and a player (ally or opponent) touches the base with the respective color.
