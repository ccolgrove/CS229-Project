'''''Sky High''''' is a 2005 American [[Comedy film|comedic]] [[superhero film|superhero]] [[Family film|family]] film about an airborne school for teenage superheroes. It was directed by [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] and written by Paul Hernandez, Robert Schooley, and [[Mark McCorkle]].  The starring cast includes [[Michael Angarano]] as Will, an incoming freshman at the school; [[Danielle Panabaker]] as his best friend; [[Kurt Russell]] and [[Kelly Preston]] as his parents; [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] as a popular senior; [[Steven Strait]] as Will's rival; and [[Lynda Carter]] as the principal. [[Andrew Gunn (producer)|Andrew Gunn]], [[Brian Grazer]] and [[Ron Howard]] produced the film for [[Walt Disney Pictures]].

==Plot==
The story describes the beginning of the freshman year for Will Stronghold ([[Michael Angarano]]) at Sky High School, a school for young superheroes that floats in the sky. Will's parents pose as suburban real-estate agents Steve and Josie Stronghold, but they are really The Commander ([[Kurt Russell]]) and Jetstream ([[Kelly Preston]]), the two most famous and powerful superheroes. The Commander has superhuman strength, and Jetstream is able to fly. Will's best friend is Layla ([[Danielle Panabaker]]), a pretty supergirl who can manipulate plant life.

The students at Sky High include Speed (Will Harris), a bully who can run faster than the human eye can see; Lash ([[Jake Sandvig]]), a bully who can stretch his body; Penny ([[Malika Haqq|Malika]] and [[Khadijah Haqq]]), a cheerleader who can make copies of herself; and Warren Peace ([[Steven Strait]]), the brooding, fire-throwing son of a supervillain and a superhero, who are currently at war. Warren's father was sent to prison by the Commander, and will be released after his third life. As the school year begins, Will is the only student who has not yet developed any superpowers.  Students with great powers are taught to be heroes, while less capable youngsters are designated as &quot;hero support&quot; and derisively referred to as &quot;sidekicks&quot;.  The abilities of the sidekicks include melting, glowing, and turning into a [[guinea pig]]. Will is put into the sidekick program due to his lack of powers, and Layla is made a sidekick after she protests the two tiered schooling by refusing to demonstrate her powers.

At the end of Will's first day at Sky High, the Commander shows him the Stronghold family's underground control center, the Secret Sanctum, which holds souvenirs from past battles. One souvenir is a weapon called a &quot;Pacifier&quot;, which the Commander took from his arch-enemy, a supervillain named Royal Pain, fifteen years ago. Another is the eyeball of a robot the Commander recently defeated. As the Commander and Will chat, Royal Pain remotely spies on them through a camera hidden in the eyeball. 

Will initially makes friends with the sidekicks, but he is transferred to the Hero program after his latent super-strength emerges during a fight with Warren.  He also attracts the attention of Gwen Grayson ([[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]]), a beautiful &quot;technopath&quot; who controls machines with her mind.  Will makes a date with Layla to prove he still likes her, but he forgets about it and has dinner with Gwen and his parents, so Layla tries to make him jealous by getting Warren to go with her to the Sky High homecoming dance.

On the day before the dance, Gwen tricks Will into throwing a party at his house, and Speed steals the Pacifier when she seduces Will into showing her the Secret Sanctum. She also convinces Layla that Will no longer likes her, but Will rejects Gwen's snobbishness and refuses to go to the dance with her, even though his parents have promised to attend as honorary guests. After his parents leave for the dance, Will reads the Commander's school yearbook, which contains a photograph of a girl who looks just like Gwen. When he sees a picture of the girl holding a pacifier, he guesses that the girl is Royal Pain and Gwen is her daughter, sees that the Pacifier is missing, and concludes that Gwen must be avenging herself on the Commander for defeating her mother. Will contacts the Sky High bus driver ([[Kevin Heffernan (comedian)|Kevin Heffernan]]), who rushes him to the dance.

Meanwhile, Gwen reveals to the dance participants that she is Royal Pain herself, who was formally a brilliant schoolgirl who invented the pacifier, but despite that and her powers, she was underestimated by the school and therefore made a sidekick. Outraged, she hatched a plan to destroy Sky High and replace it with her own school for supervillains, with the intention of turning everyone into babies with the Pacifier and raising them into villains.  Only Warren and the sidekicks escape.

When Will arrives at school, he apologizes to Layla and teams up with Warren and the sidekicks to defeat Gwen, Speed, Lash, and Penny. He discovers he has also inherited his mother's flying ability when Gwen throws him off Sky High's floating platform, and he helps to hold the school in the air as the sidekicks reactivate its sabotaged antigravity device. The babies are returned to their original state, Will and Layla kiss, and the dance resumes while Royal Pain and her gang are held in the detention room. Afterward, the villains are sent to prison, Warren becomes Will's best friend, Layla becomes Will's girlfriend, and the bus driver becomes a superhero after falling into a vat of toxic waste.

==Production==
[[Image:Oviatt-library-small.jpg|frame|Oviatt Library at CSU Northridge]]
Exterior shots of the Sky High school were filmed at the [[Oviatt Library]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.csun.edu Oviatt Library]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[California State University]] in Northridge.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csun.edu/licensing/filming.php CSUN Licensing - Facilities Use&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to scifi.com, Disney was attracted by the &quot;original concept&quot; of &quot;children of superheroes going to high school&quot;, originally conceived by screenwriter Paul Hernandez in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=scifi&gt;[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/advance/25_interview.html Kurt Russell and company go back to high school to learn what it means to be super in Sky High]&lt;/ref&gt; After recruiting comedy writers [[Mark McCorkle]] and [[Bob Schooley]] for polishing Hernandez's script, Disney hired several comedians like [[Kevin McDonald]], [[Dave Foley]], and [[Kevin Heffernan (comedian)|Kevin Heffernan]] for supporting roles.&lt;ref name=scifi/&gt; For the main roles, the casting was a mix of established and new teenager actors: while [[Michael Angarano]] and [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]] were already successful, [[Danielle Panabaker]] was little-known and [[Steven Strait]] (a former model) was hired after his first audition ever.&lt;ref name=scifi/&gt;

Producer [[Mike Mitchell (director)|Mike Mitchell]] said that ''Sky High'' functions on two premises: &quot;the adults are all insane&quot; and &quot;the girls are smarter than the boys&quot;:&lt;ref name=dvd&gt;''Sky High'' DVD extras&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, all the adults portrayed in the film tend to be caricatured, while the teenage girls are written as more assertive and powerful than the boys. For the treatment of the teenage actors, Mitchell also stated that the actors all had their own trailer and were generally kept separated, because &quot;we did not want them to date after the second week and break up after the fourth&quot;, which would have made filming difficult.&lt;ref name=dvd/&gt;

Mitchell, a science fiction fan, admitted that this project &quot;was a dream&quot;, because it brought him together with four of his favorite SF cult heroes: namely [[Wonder Woman]] (popularized in the eponymous 1970s series by actress [[Lynda Carter]]), [[Snake Plissken]] (portrayed by [[Kurt Russell]]), [[Ash Williams]] (from ''[[Evil Dead]]'', played by [[Bruce Campbell]]) and [[Cloris Leachman]], who earned fame as Frau BlÃ¼cher in ''[[Young Frankenstein]]''.&lt;ref name=scifi/&gt;

==Notes about the movie==
*It is one of the first theatrical film movies (along with ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (film)|The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'') to be only released on DVD and never released on VHS.
*It was released in summer 2005, a year before ''[[Zoom (film)|Zoom]]'', a [[Tim Allen]] film that explores similar territory.

==Reception and box office figures==
''Sky High'' received generally favorable reviews. Based on review aggregrator [[Rotten Tomatoes]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://rottentomatoes.com rottentomatoes.com]&lt;/ref&gt; the film earned a &quot;fresh&quot; rating of 72% positive reviews (85 positive, 33 negative). Critics on this website were generally favorable on the firmly tongue-in-cheek nature of the film, which knowingly spoofed comic clichÃ©s, but others found it too cheesy. Commercially it was a success: on an estimated budget of [[United States dollar|US$]]35 million, it earned just under $64 million in the US alone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0405325/business Sky High (2005) - Box office / business&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and another $22 million internationally, bringing the total to just over $86 million.
