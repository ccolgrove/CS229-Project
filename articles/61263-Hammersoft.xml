'''RoseâHulman Institute of Technology''' (abbreviated '''RHIT'''), formerly '''Rose Polytechnic Institute''', is a small private college specializing in teaching engineering, [[mathematics]], and science. RHIT is highly regarded for its undergraduate engineering program, which ''US News and World Reports'' ranked in 2011 as No. 1 in the United States of engineering schools where a doctorate degree is not offered, a position it has held since 2000.&lt;ref name=&quot;colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com&quot;&gt;http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/spec-engineering&lt;/ref&gt; Its {{convert|295|acre|sqmi ha|1|sing=on}} campus is located in [[Terre Haute, Indiana|Terre Haute]], Indiana.

==Academics==
The curricula at RHIT concentrate on engineering and the natural sciences. The school's primary focus is undergraduate education, though there is a small graduate program for master's degree students. There are no doctoral programs. In 2005, RoseâHulman had 161 faculty members, 99% of whom held a [[Philosophiae Doctor|PhD]] The current student-to-faculty ratio is 12:1.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RoseâHulman At a Glance | publisher = RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | accessdate=August 10, 2006 | url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/admissions/facts/facts.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admission to the institute remains competitive due to its self-selecting admissions class and applicant sharing with [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], [[Purdue]], [[University of Notre Dame|Notre Dame]], and other top universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= A New College Ranking | publisher = Lassiez-Faire | accessdate=September 7, 2006 | url=http://collegeadmissions.tripod.com/sitebuildercontent/sitebuilderfiles/laissez-faire-1999-2000.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, 510 students enrolled out of over 4,298 applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RoseâHulman At a Glance | publisher = RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | accessdate=August 16, 2006 | url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/admissions/facts/facts.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school currently operates on three academic quarters plus an optional summer session.

===Accreditation===
The biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, computer engineering, computer science, electrical engineering, mechanical engineering, optical engineering, and software engineering programs are accredited by The [[Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology]] (ABET).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Rose engineering, computer science programs earn accreditation | publisher=Terre Haute Tribune Star | accessdate=September 13, 2006 | url=http://www.tribstar.com/archivesearch/local_story_254194736.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; RoseâHulman is accredited by the North Central Association of Colleges and Schools and by the Department of Public Instruction of the State of Indiana. The chemistry curriculum has been approved by the Committee on Professional Training of the American Chemical Society.

In addition to institutional membership in the American Society for Engineering Education, the Institute is also a member of the Association of Independent Technological Universities, a group formed to further the interests of private engineering schools.

===Rankings and reputation===
As of 2011, the institute has been ranked first in its category (engineering colleges whose highest degree offered is a Bachelors's or Master's) by [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] for 13 consecutive years (2000â2012). Each individual program assessed has also been ranked first since the magazine has published individual rankings. These programs are the chemical, civil, computer, electrical, and mechanical engineering programs.&lt;ref name=&quot;colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com&quot;/&gt;

Other publications giving RoseâHulman high marks include: [[Newsweek]], [[Fiske]], [[Peterson's]], [[Barron's Educational Series|Barron's]], and [[The Princeton Review]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} RoseâHulman Institute is listed among the nationâs top 80 colleges and universities in Barronâs 2009 Guide to the Most Competitive Colleges. RoseâHulman and the University of Notre Dame were the only Indiana institutions on the prestigious list.

While Rose is not considered in the doctoral institution rankings, [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institute]] fellow, [[Thomas Sowell]], mentioned RoseâHulman as one of the best smaller universities to consider, noting that graduate engineering deans have ranked its graduates ahead of many top schools with PhD programs, such as [[Duke University|Duke]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[UCLA]], and the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Hoover Digest | url=http://www.hoover.org/publications/digest/3512836.html | publisher = Hoover Institute | accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Choosing a College, Chapter 12: Your Choice. | url=http://www.leaderu.com/alumni/sowell-choosing/chpter12.html | publisher = Leadership University/Thomas Sowell | accessdate=February 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[RoseâHulman Institute of Technology]] --&gt;

[[Image:Rose Polytechnic.jpg|thumb|275px|right|Photograph (circa 1881) of the original main campus building at 13th and Locust.]]

===Founding===
Founder [[Chauncey Rose]], along with nine friends, created the Terre Haute School of Industrial Science in 1874 to provide technical training after encountering difficulties in local engineer availability during construction of his railroads. Mr. Rose donated the land on 13th and Locust St. and the majority of the funds needed to start the new school. A year later, the cornerstone of the new institution was laid and the name was changed to Rose Polytechnic Institute despite the objections of the president of the board of managers and chief benefactor, Mr. Rose. The original campus was a single building, with no dormitories or recreational facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chauncey Rose | publisher=RoseâHulman Echoes | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/echoes/125th/chaunceyrose.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=A Brief History of RoseâHulman | publisher=RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/Library/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first class of 48 students entered in 1883, chosen from 58 applicants. Of the 48 students, all were male, and 37 came from Indiana. All but four students chose to major in [[Mechanical Engineering]] with [[Civil Engineering]] and [[Chemistry]] the only other majors. Nearly half of the original students would eventually quit their studies before graduation for a number of reasons, including poor grades or conduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Student Demographics â 1883 Style | publisher=RoseâHulman Echoes|accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/echoes/summer2003/lookback.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first president was [[Doctor (title)|Dr.]] [[Charles O. Thompson]], who modeled the education of Rose Poly after eastern institutions. Rose Poly was thus founded as the first private engineering college west of the Alleghenies.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

During the beginning years of the school, money was a major concern. A lot of faculty and staff were forced to take pay cuts in order to stay at the institution.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

In 1889 the school awarded what it considers to be the first [[Chemical Engineering]] degree in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BioCrossraods: Assets | publisher=BioCrossroads | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.biocrossroads.com/inls/academic-rhit.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relocation===
In 1917, the school, having grown to more than 300 students, moved from 13th and Locust St. (on which now sits Chauncey Rose Middle School) to a new site consisting of {{convert|123|acre|km2}} of farm land on U.S. 40 donated by the [[Hulman family]] of Terre Haute. The cornerstone of the new campus was laid in 1922. The new campus consisted of an academic building and a dorm â the institute's first.

Early life at Rose consisted of social fraternities, athletics, and the occasional &quot;high jinks.&quot; A popular &quot;high jinks&quot; involved the sophomore class inviting the freshmen class to a baseball game but were told to &quot;leave their pipes with the nurse.&quot; The freshmen would produce the pipes at a specific time and a brawl would ensue.&lt;ref name=&quot;history&quot;/&gt;

===War years===
During World War I Rose Poly trained students in technical subjects like vehicle maintenance, and created a [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps|ROTC]] Engineer unit. During World War II the ROTC unit was replaced with an Army Specialized Training Unit and students could enter and graduate after every quarter in order to support the war effort. This enrollment schedule continued through the post-war years until 1951. A tank is located behind the north sides of Moench Hall and Myers Hall as a reminder of Rose Poly's war contributions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Battalion History | publisher=RoseâHulman Army ROTC | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/AROTC/history.php}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaming and Logan years===
In recognition of the Hulman family's significant contributions and continued financial support, Rose Polytechnic was renamed RoseâHulman Institute of Technology in 1971.

During the 1960s and 70s, growth accelerated under president John A. Logan. Five new residence halls, a new student union, library, and a student recreation center were all constructed between 1963 and 1976. Permission was sought and received to increase the student population to 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The RoseâHulman Story | publisher=RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/125th/history.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The quarterly cryptology journal [[Cryptologia]] was founded and published at RHIT from 1977 to 1995, at which time it was moved to the [[United States Military Academy]].

===Hulbert years===
For most of its history, RoseâHulman was a men's-only institution. It voted to become [[coeducational]] in 1991, with the first women students starting in 1995. Also in 1995, the college required all incoming [[freshman|freshmen]] to purchase laptop computers, becoming one of the first schools to do so. Since then, laptops have been required for all freshmen, and the [[curriculum|curricula]] have heavily integrated computers into classroom instruction.

In the decade following 1995, RoseâHulman's growth was aided by a major [[fundraising]] campaign called &quot;Vision to be the Best.&quot; Originally a $100 million campaign over ten years, it met its goal in half the time. The goal was extended to $200 million, and by the end of the campaign in June 2004, over $250 million had been raised. In 2002, Hatfield Hall, a state-of-the-art theater and alumni center was opened. Five years earlier Shook Field House was replaced with the $20 million Sports and Recreation Center, which is a major reason that the [[National Football League|National Football League's]] [[Indianapolis Colts]] used the campus for their summer training camp from 1999â2010.

===John J. Midgley's Tenure===
After the 2004 retirement of institute president [[Samuel Hulbert]], who had led the school since 1976, the college faced a leadership crisis. Soon after [[John J. Midgley]] arrived as the new president, rumors of conflict between Midgley and the administration started to circulate. Students, some wearing T-shirts proclaiming &quot;Hit the Road Jack&quot;, held a rally calling for Midgley's resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Rally continues Midgley debate | publisher=Rose Thorn| accessdate=September 13, 2006 | author= Alex Clerc | url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/thorn/archive/050506/frontpage/3.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Midgley resigned as president of the institute on June 11, 2005, less than a year into his presidency, after the faculty,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Faculty vote: no confidence | author= Alex Clerc | publisher=Rose Thorn| accessdate=September 13, 2006 | url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/thorn/archive/050506/frontpage/1.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; staff, and Student Government Association approved votes of [[no confidence]]. During the succeeding academic year, [[Robert Bright]], the Chairman of the Board of Trustees, served as interim chief executive officer.

===Gerald Jakubowski Serves===
At a press conference on March 17, 2006, Mr. Bright named [[Gerald Jakubowski]], Vice President and Professor of Engineering at [[Arizona State University]], as the thirteenth president of the Institute. Dr. Jakubowski took over effective July 1, 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Gerald Jakubowski Begins Duties as 13th President of RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | publisher=RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | accessdate=August 10, 2006 | url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/news/articles/jakubowskibeginsjuly1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Jakubowski was respectfully referred to as &quot;Dr. J.&quot; by the students and he held meetings with those interested a few times during the year to catch up on campus life.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} On February 23, 2009, Dr. Jakubowski announced that he would be resigning from the position of president, effective June 30.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=President Jakubowski Announces Resignation Effective June 30| accessdate=February 23, 2009|url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/notificationcommunity.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=BREAKING UPDATE: Rose president resigns|accessdate=February 23, 2009|url=http://www.tribstar.com/local/local_story_054104501.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Current President Matt Branam===
On June 11, 2009, the college announced that the Board of Trustees had elected [[Matt Branam]] to serve as interim president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Alumnus, Executive Matt Branam Named Interim President of RoseâHulman| accessdate=August 4, 2009|url=http://alumni.rose-hulman.edu/news/27236/Alumni-News-Alumnus-Executive-Matt-Branam-Named-Interim-President-of-R.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 4, 2009, the Board elected Branam as permanent president.
Upon election of Branam as interim, RoseâHulman began a search for a permanent president which had identified a number of impressive potential candidates. &quot;Early in that process, the Trustees became convinced that it was in the institution's best interest to ask Matt Branam, who has been serving in an interim capacity, to become our permanent president,â said Board Chairman William Fenoglio.

With his election, Branam became the 14th president in the 135-year history of the college.

Branam brings a wealth of experience and knowledge to RoseâHulman. His expertise in fundraising, board relations, public relations, brand management, legal, labor, and financial affairs brings RoseâHulman a seasoned leader. He managed the American Red Cross through a period of tremendous growth and change for its then president, Elizabeth Dole, as its first ever chief operating officer. Branamâs experience also includes a distinguished 24-year career with UPS (formerly called United Parcel Service) where his local job as a teenager evolved through numerous positions of increased responsibility, including the position of vice president of public affairs in Washington, D.C. A native of Terre Haute, Ind., Branam has attended Indiana State University, Taylor University and Georgetown University, and he graduated from RoseâHulman in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rose-hulman.edu/news/articles/2009MattBranam-14thPresident.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Campus==
[[Image:Percopo and white chapel 2007.JPG|thumb|275px|A view of Percopo Hall (left) and White Chapel.]]
[[Image:ChapelFlare.jpg|thumb|left|White Chapel at RoseâHulman.]]

RoseâHulman's {{convert|295|acre|ha|sing=on|0}} campus includes a baseball field, a [[softball]] field, and a soccer field at the west end, two bodies of water (known on campus as &quot;Scum Pond&quot; and &quot;Speed Lake&quot;) surrounded by residence halls in the middle, the academic buildings east of that, and a row of fraternities further to the east. The Sports and Recreation Center (SRC), Cook Stadium, and other sports-related facilities anchor the north side of campus, and Oakley Observatory sits on the far east edge.

The entrance of the campus leads to Hadley Hall, the main administrative building. The center of campus is marked by the Grace and Anton Hulman Memorial Union, which includes dining facilities and administrative offices, as well as other campus-run businesses such as the bookstore and game room.

RoseâHulman maintains a safe campus: the crime rate for all of campus is low with only a few incidents reported each year.&lt;ref name=&quot;CrimeStats&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Crime Statistics| publisher=RoseâHulman Institute of Technology â Public Safety | accessdate=January 27, 2009| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/Security/CampusCrimeStats.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Office of Public Safety provides 24-hour security and operates emergency call boxes situated throughout the campus to summon help for emergencies, for the escort service, or to get one's car unlocked to retrieve keys. All of the sidewalks are well lit, and during winter the stairways and sidewalks are kept clear of snow and ice.
[[Image:Chapelnight.jpg|thumb|right|White Chapel and fountain at night.]]

===Residence halls===
There are ten residence halls on campus: Deming, Baur-Sames-Bogart (BSB), Speed, Mees, Scharpenberg, Blumberg, Skinner, Percopo, and the Apartment Style Residence Hall (which consists of Apartments East and Apartments West). Combined, these halls can provide housing for over 1,100 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot;&gt;{{cite web | title=Residence Halls| publisher=RoseâHulman Institute of Technology â Student Affairs | accessdate=August 16, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/StudentAffairs/res_index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Deminghall.jpg|thumb|left|Deming Hall.]]

The oldest, Deming Hall, was built in 1926 and is an all-male hall. Deming houses 109 students, mostly freshmen, on four floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt; BSB Hall, built in 1956, is an L-shaped building with room for 144 students on three stories, mostly freshmen.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt; The offices and studios of the campus radio station occupy much of BSB's basement. There are also some rooms in the basement for upperclass male students.

[[Image:Speedlawn.jpg|thumb|right|Speed Lawn behind Speed Hall.]]
[[Image:percopo.jpg|thumb|left|Percopo Hall (rear view).]]

Speed Hall was built in 1963 and holds 116 freshmen on three floors, all male. North of Speed Hall is Speed Lawn and Speed Lake.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt; Mees, Scharpenberg, and Blumberg (all built in 1966) constitute the Triplets, three halls housing 76 students each on 4 H-shaped floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt; Mees and Scharpenberg are identical, with Blumberg being a mirror image of the two. Skinner, built in 1976, is an apartment-style residence hall on the east side of campus. Apartments in Skinner were originally composed of three bedrooms, a bathroom, a living room, and a kitchen shared with three other apartments, but were remodeled to have only two bedrooms and a private kitchen. Skinner is the smallest residence hall, housing only 44 students and 2 resident assistants.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt;

Percopo, built in 1999, is a Sophomore-only hall, designed to retain and help educate Sophomore students. Percopo has in-house tutors and other resources geared towards assisting Sophomores through what is generally considered the hardest academic year. Percopo has 109 double-rooms (sharing a bathroom) on four floors.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt; The Apartment Style Residence Hall is the newest hall; it opened in the fall of 2004. The Apartments actually consist of two halls, referred to as East and West, connected by a commons area. Apartments East and Apartments West are identical, each having suites with two bedrooms, a kitchen, a bathroom, and a living room. The commons area contains a [[Subway (restaurant)|Subway restaurant]], a [[convenience store]], a [[barber|barber shop]], and laundry facilities.&lt;ref name=&quot;ResHalls&quot; /&gt;

All residence halls are kept clean by the devoted Residence Hall staff. Each room is cleaned once a week by a housekeeper. This cleaning consists of emptying the trash cans, making the beds with clean sheets, wiping the mirrors in the room, and vacuuming the floor. The lobbies of each hall are cleaned every day, and the restrooms are cleaned several times a week.

===Academic buildings===
[[Image:RHIT Academic Buildings.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Root Quadrangle, Logan Library (left) and Olin Hall (right).]]
RoseâHulman has four main classroom buildings plus a library, a mechanical engineering lab, and an administration building. The four main buildings are Moench Hall, Olin Hall, Crapo Hall, and Myers Hall. Olin came as a result of a proposal by [[Sam Hulbert]] and was later expanded to add eight more advanced learning classrooms. Olin includes a large occupancy by the [[Civil Engineering]] and [[Chemical Engineering]] Departments. Crapo is home to the [[Mathematics]] Department and has two floors of classrooms. The John T. Myers Center for Technological Research with Industry, the newest academic building, holds the [[Graduate Studies]] Office and some [[Bioengineering]] Department labs. The largest, Moench Hall, is composed of four floors of classrooms, offices, and labs, and was the original academic building on campus built in 1922. All of the remaining departments have offices in Moench.

The Logan Library is a small engineering library whose lower floor is occupied by The Learning Center, with tutors and help available to students, Homework Hotline, and the ROTC offices. Near Myers Hall is the Rotz Mechanical Engineering Lab which houses three wind tunnels and other mechanical engineering labs. Connecting Moench Hall and Olin Hall is Hadley Hall. This building contains the offices of the President, the Registrar, Admissions, and Financial Aid.

RoseâHulman's wireless network covers the academic buildings, Hulman Memorial Union, the Sports and Recreation Center, Logan Library, and the residence halls. Every classroom and residence hall room is also equipped with high-speed ethernet connections.

===Chauncey's===
Chaunceyâs is the campus game room for RoseâHulman. It is managed and staffed by RoseâHulman students, with the guidance of the Student Activities Department. It is open to all RoseâHulman students, faculty, staff, and guests. There are two pool tables, a ping pong table, a foosball table, and recently added an air-hockey table. RoseâHulman Residence Hall Association provides Chaunceyâs with DVDâs that are made available for students to rent at no cost (Currently over 600 titles). The lounge in Chaunceyâs is furnished with five big-screen TVâs, and plays host to a number of events.

Throughout the year, Chaunceyâs hosts several different tournaments and events, including:
* Video Game Tournaments
* TV Premier Parties
* Texas Hold âem Tournament
* NCAA Bracket Tournament
* Billiards Tournament
* Table Tennis Tournament
* Foosball Tournament
* Super Bowl Party

During the academic year, Chaunceyâs is open during the week from 11&amp;nbsp;am to 11&amp;nbsp;pm, and from noon to 11&amp;nbsp;pm on the weekends, except during exams and breaks when schedules change.

===Artwork===
[[Image:flameside.jpg|thumb|left|A rear view of the Flame of the Millennium sculpture with Hatfield Hall in the background.]]
[[Image:flamesouth.jpg|thumb|right|A view of the Flame of the Millennium, facing south.]]

Public artwork is displayed across the campus. The ''Flame of the Millennium'', designed by [[Leonardo Nierman]], and its surrounding fountain is the largest and one of the newest of the sculptures. Other works can be seen in the Root Quadrangle around Olin, Moench, and Crapo, and opposite Olin toward the south end of campus. Out of all the sculptures around campus, one of the favorites among students is Naked Lady Riding Fish, located in the Root Quadrangle near Olin Hall. Many students pose with this sculpture to have their pictures taken. Another campus favorite is the Self-Made Man, located near the entrance to the SRC.

Paintings and prints can also be found throughout the school. The largest collection is that of the late [[D. Omer Seamon|Omer &quot;Salty&quot; Seamon]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wabash Valley Profiles â D. Omer &quot;Salty&quot; Seamon | publisher=Vigo County Historical Society | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.indstate.edu/community/vchs/wvp/seamon-omer.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; a Hoosier [[watercolor]]ist and illustrator. A 115-piece collection of 19th century [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] watercolors can be found in the Hulman Memorial Union. The art curator for RoseâHulman also is in charge of rotating the art collections on the main floors of Moench Hall which are changed during the summer and also over Winter Break.

==Student life==
The student body tends to come mostly from the [[Midwest]] United States, though as the school has gained prominence it has gradually attracted a more geographically and ethnically diverse applicant pool. 39% of students hail from the state of Indiana with large numbers of students from the nearby states of Illinois, Ohio, Michigan and Minnesota.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=RoseâHulman Connections | publisher=RoseâHulman Institute of Technology | accessdate=April 13, 2007 | url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/admissions/connections/index.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2003 gift of $7 million from an alumnus was specifically established to increase geographic diversity. International students currently make up about 3% of the student body. Approximately 25% of students are female. A sizable population is involved in [[Army ROTC program|Army]] and [[Air Force ROTC program]]s.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Greek life and honor societies===
There are eight social [[fraternities]] and three social [[sororities]], some of which have their houses on campus. The fraternities are: [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Delta Sigma Phi]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Theta Xi]], and [[Triangle Fraternity|Triangle]]. The sororities are [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Omicron Pi]]. As of 2003, nearly half of the students were members of Greek social organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Wondering About Greek Life? | publisher=The Rose Thorn | accessdate=August 10, 2006| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/thorn/archive/030926/frontpage/0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various academic, honor and service organizations are also represented, including [[Alpha Chi Sigma]], [[Alpha Lambda Delta]], [[Alpha Phi Omega]], [[Eta Kappa Nu]], [[Pi Mu Epsilon]], [[Pi Tau Sigma]], [[Sigma Pi Sigma]], [[Tau Beta Pi]] and [[Upsilon Pi Epsilon]].

==Performing arts==
The performing arts at RoseâHulman have a wide base of support. There are currently 6 different performing arts groups on campus, Chorus, Drama Club, String Ensemble, Jazz Band, Concert Band, and Pep Band. All of the groups use the recently constructed Hatfield Hall for performances, rehearsal space, and storage. All performing arts groups have been recording CDs for the past couple of years to use as recruiting measures and to show off the talent of the RoseâHulman students. In addition to these groups, RoseâHulman also has the Performing Arts Series which brings mainstream acts to Hatfield Hall for the cultural enrichment of both the campus and community. Recent acts have included Diavolo, the Harlem Gospel Choir, and the East Village Opera Company all of whose shows sold out completely in only a few days.

==Student engineering projects==
There are many activities and clubs at RoseâHulman, but there are several engineering projects that frequently take the spotlight. The institute has recently started an Advanced Transportation Initiative that has attracted national attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Challenge X &amp; Efficient Vehicle Design Projects Put On National Stage | publisher=RoseâHulman | accessdate=December 9, 2007| url=http://www.rose-hulman.edu/news/articles/2007ChallengeXNational.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; With its close proximity to the most prominent automotive and transportation companies in the United States, RoseâHulman is able to partner with companies to integrate current technology and industry developments into the curriculum beyond senior projects so that students can have a four-year experience understanding the engineering world.

===Challenge X and EcoCAR===
The team at RoseâHulman was initially created to compete in the Challenge X competition. ChallengeX was a competition among 17 Universities in the United States and Canada that partner with General Motors and the Department of Energy to re-engineer a 2005 Chevrolet Equinox to improve fuel efficiency and decrease emissions. The team ranges from 30â70 students and has been an integral part of the Universities Mechanical &amp; Electrical Engineering programs. The vehicle uses a power-split hybrid architecture as the team modified their vehicle into a rear wheel drive diesel-electric hybrid using B20 biodiesel fuel. The university allows them to use a designated section of the Rotz Lab on campus as team headquarters. Students receive course credit for this project. [http://www.rose-hulman.edu/challengex RoseâHulman ChallengeX Team Website]

The start of the 2008â2009 school year brought with it a new challenge, EcoCAR. The EcoCAR challenge is a three-year competition that is the latest in the 19-year history of the Department of Energy advanced vehicle competitions. RoseâHulman competes with 16 other schools throughout the United States and Canada to reengineer a Saturn Vue crossover. [http://ecocar.rose-hulman.edu/ RoseâHulman EcoCAR Team Website]

===Efficient Vehicle Team===
The team includes 18 students majoring in mechanical engineering, chemical engineering and civil engineering â â four students remaining from the original team that formed the RHEV group in 2003. The goal of this team is to develop a vehicle with very high gas mileage. The team competes in several national and international competitions each year. The driver lays flat on her back and steers the car by adjusting independent front wheel mechanisms. The vehicle is driven by a single rear wheel thatâs attached to the motor, located behind the driverâs compartment.

===Human-Powered Vehicle Team===
The [[RoseâHulman Human Powered Vehicle Team]] constructs a man-powered land vehicle to compete in the American Society of Mechanical Engineers' [http://www.asme.org/Events/Contests/HPV/Human_Powered_Vehicle.cfm Human Powered Vehicle Challenge]. The vehicle must be light, highly efficient and powered only by its single occupant. The team at RoseâHulman is a volunteer engineering club.

The team has competed for five years. The first year, the &quot;Hautian Hazard&quot; gave a strong showing at the sprint and endurance events. However, due to a low design report score, the team only received 7th place at the ASME East Coast competition.

The second year, the &quot;R5&quot; came on strong and took second place overall at the ASME East Coast competition. It was clocked at over {{convert|40|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} in the sprint event. It also had a sustained one-hour endurance speed of {{convert|31|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} at an [http://www.recumbents.com/hpra/ HPRA] event.

The 2008 bike, &quot;Infinity&quot;, has performed extremely well at the both the East and West Coast ASME competitions. The team achieved first place overall at West Coast by earning a first-place finish in the women's sprint and design report, second place in the men's sprint, and third place in the endurance event. In the men's sprint the vehicle traveled at {{convert|45|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} through a 100-meter time trap. The team also achieved first place overall at the East Coast Competition by earning a first-place finish in the men's sprint, second place in the women's sprint and endurance event, and third place in the design report. RoseâHulman was the second team ever to win both the East and West Coast ASME competitions in the same year.

The team continued to win in 2009 and 2010, winning the both the ASME East and ASME West Human-Powered Vehicle Challenge in each year. The vehicles built were dubbed &quot;Mark IV&quot; and &quot;RagnarÃ¶k&quot;, respectively. In 2010, the team competed in a new vehicle class, Unrestricted, which required more practicality from the competing vehicles.

In 2011, RoseâHulman will be hosting the ASME HPVC East Coast competition.
