'''Eric Patrick Clapton''', [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]], (born {{j|30 March}} 1945) is an English [[guitarist]] and [[singer-songwriter]]. Clapton is the only three-time inductee to the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]: once as a solo artist, and separately as a member of [[The Yardbirds]] and [[Cream (band)|Cream]]. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time.&lt;ref name=AST&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-artists-of-all-time-19691231/eric-clapton-19691231|title=55 â Eric Clapton|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton [[List of guitarists considered the greatest|ranked second]] in [[Rolling Stone (magazine)|''Rolling Stone'']] magazine's list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time&quot; and fourth in ''[[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson's]]'' ''Top 50 Guitarists of All Time.''

In the mid 1960s, Clapton departed from the Yardbirds to play blues with [[John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers]]. In his one-year stay with Mayall, Clapton gained the nickname &quot;Slowhand&quot;, and graffiti in London declared &quot;Clapton is God.&quot; Immediately after leaving Mayall, Clapton formed [[Cream (band)|Cream]], a [[power trio]] with drummer [[Ginger Baker]] and bassist [[Jack Bruce]] in which Clapton played sustained blues improvisations and &quot;arty, blues-based psychedelic pop.&quot; For most of the 1970s, Clapton's output bore the influence of the mellow style of [[J.J. Cale]] and the reggae of [[Bob Marley]]. His version of Marley's &quot;[[I Shot the Sheriff]]&quot; helped reggae reach a mass market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockhall.com/inductee/eric-clapton Inductee: Eric Clapton].

==Early life==
Eric Patrick Clapton was born in [[Ripley, Surrey]], England, the son of 16-year-old Patricia Molly Clapton (b. {{j|7 January}} 1929 d. March 1999) and Edward Walter Fryer ({{j|21 March}} 1920 â {{j|15 May}} 1985), a 24-year-old soldier from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry Shapiro (1992) ''Eric Clapton: Lost in the Blues'' pg. 29. Guinness, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; Fryer shipped off to war prior to Clapton's birth and then returned to Canada. Clapton grew up with his grandmother, Rose, and her second husband, Jack Clapp, who was stepfather to Patricia Clapton and her brother Adrian, believing they were his parents and that his mother was actually his older sister. The similarity in surnames gave rise to the erroneous belief that Clapton's real surname is Clapp (Reginald Cecil Clapton was the name of Rose's first husband, Eric Clapton's maternal grandfather).&lt;ref&gt; [http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/21196319/ns/today-books/ Ladies and gentlemen, Eric Clapton] ''[[msnbc]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, his mother married another Canadian soldier and moved to [[Germany]],&lt;ref name=CND&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=obs89cWwqZoC&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=clapton+canadian+soldier&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=KagaTau9GoabhQfK8qy3Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=clapton%20canadian%20soldier&amp;f=false Profiles in Popular Music] pg. 71. Sura Books, 2005. Retrieved 29 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; leaving young Eric with his grandparents in [[Surrey]].&lt;ref name=GUI/&gt;

Clapton received an acoustic Hoyer guitar, made in Germany, for his thirteenth birthday, but the inexpensive steel-stringed instrument was difficult to play and he briefly lost interest.&lt;ref name=GUI&gt;Bob Gulla (2008) [http://books.google.com/books?id=DL3I9qQWdeAC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=eric+clapton+hoyer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=g64aTdKBIsnQhAenwNy4Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=eric%20clapton%20hoyer&amp;f=false Guitar Gods: The 25 Players Who Made Rock History] pgs. 40â41. Retrieved 29 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Two years later Clapton picked it up again and started playing consistently.&lt;ref name=GUI/&gt; Clapton was influenced by the [[Blues music|blues]] from an early age, and practised long hours to learn the [[chords]] of blues music by playing along to the records.&lt;ref name=clap/&gt; He preserved his practice sessions using his portable [[Grundig]] reel-to-reel tape recorder, listening to them over and over until he felt he'd got it right.&lt;ref name=clap&gt;Clapton, Eric (2007) ''Eric Clapton: The Autobiography'', pg. 22. Century, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=thomp/&gt;

After leaving Hollyfield school Surbiton in 1961, Clapton studied at the [[Kingston University|Kingston College of Art]] but was dismissed at the end of the academic year because his focus remained on music rather than art. His guitar playing was so advanced that by the age of sixteen people were starting to notice him.&lt;ref name=thomp/&gt; Around this time Clapton began [[busking]] around [[Kingston upon Thames|Kingston]], [[Richmond, London|Richmond]], and the [[West End of London]].&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Chris (1994) [http://www.cream2005.com/theband_ericclapton.lasso Extract]&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1962, Clapton started performing as a duo with fellow blues enthusiast [[Dave Brock|David Brock]] in the pubs around Surrey.&lt;ref name=thomp&gt;Thompson, Dave (2006) ''Cream: How Eric Clapton Took the World by Storm'' pgs. 31-32. Virgin Books, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; When he was seventeen years old Clapton joined his first band, an early British [[R&amp;B]] group, &quot;The Roosters&quot;, whose other guitarist was [[Tom McGuinness (musician)|Tom McGuinness]]. He stayed with this band from January through August 1963.&lt;ref name=BIOG&gt;[http://www.rollingstone.com/music/artists/eric-clapton/biographyc Eric Clapton: Biography]{{dead link|date=July 2011}} ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In October of that year, Clapton did a seven-[[Gig (musical performance)|gig]] stint with [[Casey Jones &amp; The Engineers]].&lt;ref name=BIOG/&gt;

==Career==
===1960s===
====The Yardbirds and the Bluesbreakers====
{{Main|The Yardbirds|John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers}}
In October 1963 Clapton joined The Yardbirds, a blues-influenced [[rock and roll]] band, and stayed with them until March 1965. Synthesising influences from [[Chicago blues]] and leading blues guitarists such as [[Buddy Guy]], [[Freddie King]], and [[B. B. King]], Clapton forged a distinctive style and rapidly became one of the most talked-about guitarists in the British music scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;unuhsh&quot;&gt;Romanowski, Patricia (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; The band initially played [[Chess Records|Chess]]/[[Checker Records|Checker]]/[[Vee-Jay Records|Vee-Jay]] blues numbers and began to attract a large [[cult]] following when they took over the [[Rolling Stones]]' residency at the [[Crawdaddy Club]] in [[Richmond, London|Richmond]]. They toured England with American bluesman [[Sonny Boy Williamson II]]; a joint LP album, recorded in December 1963, was issued in 1965.

It was during this time period that Clapton's Yardbirds rhythm guitarist, [[Chris Dreja]], recalled that whenever Clapton broke a guitar string during a concert, he would stay on stage and replace it. The English audiences would wait out the delay by doing what is called a &quot;[[Slow clap|slow handclap]]&quot;. Clapton told his official biographer, Ray Coleman, that, &quot;My nickname of 'Slowhand' came from [[Giorgio Gomelsky]]. He coined it as a good pun. He kept saying I was a fast player, so he put together the slow handclap phrase into Slowhand as a play on words&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Where's Eric?|accessdate=11 October 2007|url=http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/slowhand-nickname.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070927223253/http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/slowhand-nickname.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1965 the Yardbirds had their first major hit, &quot;[[For Your Love]]&quot;, on which Clapton played guitar. The Yardbirds elected to move toward a pop-oriented sound, in part because of the success of &quot;For Your Love&quot;, written by pop songwriter-for-hire [[Graham Gouldman]], who had also written hit songs for teen pop outfit [[Herman's Hermits]] and [[The Hollies]]. Still musically devoted to the blues, Clapton was opposed to the move, and left the band. He recommended fellow guitarist [[Jimmy Page]] as his replacement, but Page was at that time unwilling to relinquish his lucrative career as a freelance [[studio musician]], so Page in turn recommended Clapton's successor, [[Jeff Beck]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unuhsh&quot;/&gt; While Beck and Page played together in the Yardbirds, the trio of Beck, Page, and Clapton were never in the group together. However, the trio did appear on the 12-date benefit tour for [[Action for Research into Multiple Sclerosis]], as well as on the album ''[[Guitar Boogie]]''.

Clapton joined John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers in April 1965, only to quit a few months later. In the summer of 1965 he left for Greece with a band called The Glands, which included his old friend Ben Palmer on piano. In November 1965 he rejoined John Mayall. It was during his second Bluesbreakers stint that his passionate playing established Clapton's name as the best blues guitarist on the club circuit. Although Clapton gained world fame for his playing on the influential album, ''[[Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton|Blues Breakers - John Mayall - With Eric Clapton]]'', this album was not released until Clapton had left the Bluesbreakers for the last time. Having swapped his [[Fender Telecaster]] and [[Vox AC30]] amplifier for a 1960 [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Standard]] guitar and [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall amplifier]], Clapton's sound and playing inspired a well-publicised [[graffiti|graffito]] that [[Honorific nicknames in popular music|deified him]] with the famous slogan &quot;Clapton is God&quot;. The phrase was spray-painted by an admirer on a wall in an [[London Borough of Islington|Islington]] [[London Underground|Underground]] station in the autumn of 1967. The graffiti was captured in a now-famous photograph, in which a dog is urinating on the wall. Clapton is reported to have been embarrassed by the slogan, saying in his ''[[The South Bank Show]]'' profile in 1987, &quot;I never accepted that I was the greatest guitar player in the world. I always ''wanted'' to be the greatest guitar player in the world, but that's an ideal, and I accept it as an ideal&quot;. The phrase began to appear in other areas of Islington throughout the mid 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where's Eric Website: Nickname|accessdate=17 February 2007|url=http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/clapton-is-god-graffiti-nickname.html |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070126080239/http://www.whereseric.com/ecfaq/biography-ecs-life-career/clapton-is-god-graffiti-nickname.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 26 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cream====
{{Main|Cream (band)}}
Clapton left the Bluesbreakers in July 1966 (to be replaced by [[Peter Green (musician)|Peter Green]]) and formed Cream, one of the earliest [[Supergroup (bands)|supergroups]], with [[Jack Bruce]] on bass (also of [[Manfred Mann]], the Bluesbreakers, and the [[Graham Bond|Graham Bond Organisation]]) and [[Ginger Baker]] on drums (another member of the Graham Bond Organisation). Before the formation of Cream, Clapton was not well known in the United States; he left the Yardbirds before &quot;For Your Love&quot; hit the [[Billboard Hot 100|American Top Ten]], and had yet to perform there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Unterberger |first=Richie |url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p3983|pure_url=yes}} |title=AllMusic |publisher=AllMusic |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his time with Cream, Clapton began to develop as a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, though Bruce took most of the lead vocals and wrote the majority of the material with lyricist [[Pete Brown]].&lt;ref name=&quot;unuhsh&quot;/&gt; Cream's first gig was an unofficial performance at the [[Twisted Wheel Club]] in [[Manchester]] on {{j|29 July}} 1966 before their full debut two nights later at the [[National Jazz and Blues Festival]] in [[Windsor, Berkshire|Windsor]]. Cream established its enduring legend with the high-volume blues jamming and extended solos of their live shows.

In early 1967 Clapton's status as Britain's top guitarist was rivalled by the emergence of [[Jimi Hendrix]], an [[acid rock]]-infused guitarist who used wailing [[audio feedback|feedback]] and [[Effects unit|effects pedals]] to create new sounds for the instrument. Hendrix attended a performance of the newly-formed Cream at the [[University of Westminster|Central London Polytechnic]] on {{j|1 October}} 1966, during which Hendrix sat in on a double-timed version of &quot;[[Killing Floor (Howlin' Wolf song)|Killing Floor]]&quot;. Top UK stars including Clapton, [[Pete Townshend]], and members of [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[The Beatles]] avidly attended Hendrix's early club performances. Hendrix's arrival had an immediate and major effect on the next phase of Clapton's career, although Clapton continued to be recognised in UK music polls as the premier guitarist.

Clapton first visited the United States while touring with Cream. In March 1967, Cream performed a nine-show stand at the RKO Theater in New York. They recorded ''[[Disraeli Gears]]'' in New York from {{j|11â15 May}} 1967. Cream's repertoire varied from hard rock (&quot;[[I Feel Free]]&quot;) to lengthy blues-based instrumental jams (&quot;[[Spoonful]]&quot;). ''Disraeli Gears'' featured Clapton's searing guitar lines, Bruce's soaring vocals and prominent, fluid bass playing, and Baker's powerful, polyrhythmic jazz-influenced drumming. Together, Cream's talents secured themselves as an influential [[power trio]].

In 28 months, Cream had become a commercial success, selling millions of records and playing throughout the U.S. and Europe. They redefined the instrumentalist's role in rock and were one of the first blues-rock bands to emphasise musical virtuosity and lengthy jazz-style improvisation sessions. Their U.S. hit singles include &quot;[[Sunshine of Your Love]]&quot; (#5, 1968), &quot;[[White Room]]&quot; (#6, 1968) and &quot;[[Crossroads (song)|Crossroads]]&quot; (#28, 1969) â a live version of [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]]'s &quot;Cross Road Blues&quot;. Though Cream was hailed as one of the greatest groups of its day, and the adulation of Clapton as a guitar hero reached new heights, the [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] was short-lived. Drug and alcohol use escalated tension between the three members, and conflicts between Bruce and Baker eventually led to Cream's demise. A strongly critical ''Rolling Stone'' review of a concert of the group's second headlining U.S. tour was another significant factor in the trio's demise, and it affected Clapton profoundly.&lt;ref&gt;Welch, Chris: &quot;Cream&quot; (2000), page 131&lt;/ref&gt;

Cream's farewell album, ''[[Goodbye (Cream album)|Goodbye]]'', featuring live performances recorded at [[The Forum (Inglewood, California)|The Forum]], Los Angeles, {{j|19 October}} 1968, was released shortly after Cream disbanded; it also featured the studio single &quot;[[Badge (song)|Badge]]&quot;, co-written by Clapton and [[George Harrison]]. Clapton met Harrison and became friends with him after the Beatles shared a bill with the Clapton-era Yardbirds at the [[London Palladium]]. The close friendship between Clapton and Harrison resulted in Clapton's playing on Harrison's &quot;[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]&quot; from the Beatles' ''[[The Beatles (album)|White Album]]'' (1968). Harrison also released his solo debut album, ''[[Wonderwall Music]]'', in 1968. It became the first of many Harrison solo records to feature Clapton on guitar. Clapton would go largely uncredited for his contributions to Harrison's albums due to contractual restraints. The pair would often play live together as each other's guest. A year after Harrison's death in 2001, Clapton helped organise a [[Concert for George|tribute concert]], for which he was [[musical director]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/3138096.stm Ex-Beatles at Harrison film tribute] ''BBC News'' (25 September 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Cream briefly reunited in 1993 to perform at the ceremony inducting them into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]]; a full reunion took place in May 2005, with Clapton, Bruce, and Baker playing four sold-out concerts at London's [[Royal Albert Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rRQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;dq=cream+2005+royal+albert+hall&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6lgcTfznBaKShAe9uv22Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=cream%202005%20royal%20albert%20hall&amp;f=false Billboard 23 Jul 2005] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and three shows at New York's [[Madison Square Garden]] that October.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/25/AR2005102501667.html Cream, Rising to the Occasion at Madison Square Garden] ''[[The Washington Post]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Recordings from the London shows, ''[[Royal Albert Hall London May 2-3-5-6, 2005]]'', were released on CD, LP, and DVD in September/December 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=royal-albert-hall-london-may-2-3-5-6-2005-main-entry-r794100|pure_url=yes}} |title=Royal Albert Hall: London May&amp;nbsp;2â3â5â6 2005 |author=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine |work=[[Allmusic]] |publisher=Rovi Corporation |accessdate=30 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Blind Faith and Delaney and Bonnie and Friends====
{{Main|Blind Faith|Delaney and Bonnie and Friends}}
Clapton's next group, [[Blind Faith]] (1969), was composed of Cream drummer Ginger Baker, [[Steve Winwood]] of [[Traffic (band)|Traffic]], and [[Ric Grech]] of [[Family (band)|Family]], and yielded one LP and one arena-circuit tour. The supergroup debuted before 100,000 fans in London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] on {{j|7 June}} 1969. They performed several dates in Scandinavia and began a sold-out American tour in July before their only album was released. The LP ''[[Blind Faith (Blind Faith album)|Blind Faith]]'' consisted of just six songs, one of them a 15-minute jam entitled &quot;Do What You Like&quot;. The album's jacket image of a topless pubescent girl was deemed controversial in the United States and was replaced by a photograph of the band. Blind Faith dissolved after less than seven months.

Clapton subsequently toured as a sideman for an act that had opened for Blind Faith, [[Delaney and Bonnie and Friends]]. He also played two dates as a member of [[The Plastic Ono Band]] that fall, including a recorded performance at the [[Toronto Rock and Roll Revival]] in September 1969 released as the album ''[[Live Peace in Toronto 1969]]''.&lt;ref name=lenn&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=LJ9Y0YgSE1oC&amp;pg=PA15&amp;dq=eric+clapton+-+the+plastic+ono+band&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Hyk2TaT5I9uL4gb4kpC4Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=eric%20clapton%20-%20the%20plastic%20ono%20band&amp;f=false The words and music of John Lennon] p.15. Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 December 1969 Clapton performed with [[John Lennon]], George Harrison, and others as the Plastic Ono Band at a fundraiser for [[UNICEF]] in London.&lt;ref name=lenn/&gt;

[[Delaney Bramlett]] encouraged Clapton in his singing and writing.  During the summer of 1969, Clapton and Bramlett contributed to the ''[[Music From Free Creek]]'' &quot;supersession&quot; project.  Clapton, appearing as &quot;King Cool&quot; for contractual reasons, played with [[Dr. John]] on three songs, joined by Bramlett on two tracks.

Using the Bramletts' backing group and an all-star cast of session players (including [[Leon Russell]] and [[Stephen Stills]]), Clapton recorded his first solo album during two brief tour hiatuses, fittingly named ''[[Eric Clapton (album)|Eric Clapton]]''. Delaney Bramlett co-wrote six of the songs with Clapton,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

| url={{Allmusic|class=song|id=t2546826|pure_url=yes}}
| title=allmusic ((( Let It Rain )))
| accessdate=5 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The album yielded the unexpected U.S. #18 hit, [[J. J. Cale]]'s &quot;After Midnight&quot;. Clapton went with Delaney and Bonnie from the stage to the studio with the Dominos to record George Harrison's ''[[All Things Must Pass]]'' in spring 1970. During this busy period, Clapton also recorded with other artists including Dr. John, [[Leon Russell]], Plastic Ono Band, [[Billy Preston]], and [[Ringo Starr]].

With the intention to counteract the &quot;star&quot; cult faction that had begun to form around him, Clapton assembled a new band composed of Delaney and Bonnie's former [[rhythm section]], [[Bobby Whitlock]] as keyboardist and vocalist, [[Carl Radle]] as the bassist, and drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], with Clapton playing guitar. It was his intention to show that he need not fill a starring role, and functioned well as a member of an ensemble.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Naming the band, &quot;Eric Clapton and Friends&quot; at first, the name &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot; was a fluke. It occurred when the band's provisional name of &quot;Del and the Dynamos&quot; was misread as Derek and the Dominos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistfacts.com/detail.php?id=100|work=Artistfacts | title =Derek And The Dominoes|accessdate=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton's biography states that Ashton told Clapton to call the band &quot;Del and the Dominos&quot;, since &quot;Del&quot; was his nickname for Eric Clapton. Del and Eric were combined and the final name became &quot;Derek and the Dominos&quot;.&lt;ref name = &quot;nxfddy&quot;&gt;Schumacher, Michael (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;

Clapton's close friendship with George Harrison brought him into contact with Harrison's wife, [[Pattie Boyd]], with whom he became deeply infatuated. When she spurned his advances, Clapton's unrequited affections prompted most of the material for the Dominos' album, ''[[Layla and Other Assorted Love Songs]]'' (1970). Heavily blues-influenced, the album features the twin lead guitars of Allman and Clapton, with Allman's [[slide guitar]] as a key ingredient of the sound. Working at [[Criteria Studios]] in Miami with [[Atlantic Records]] producer [[Tom Dowd]], who had worked with Clapton on Cream's ''Disraeli Gears'', the band recorded a double album.

The album features the hit love song &quot;[[Layla]]&quot;, inspired by the classical poet of [[Persian literature]], [[Nizami Ganjavi]]'s ''[[Layla and Majnun|The Story of Layla and Majnun]]'', a copy of which [[Ian Dallas]] had given to Clapton. The book moved Clapton profoundly, as it was the tale of a young man who fell hopelessly in love with a beautiful, unavailable woman and who went crazy because he could not marry her.&lt;ref&gt;William McKeen, &quot;Rock and roll is here to stay: an anthology&quot;, Published by W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 2000. pg 127: &quot;Clapton poured all he had into Layla's title track, which was inspired by the Persian love story he had read, the story of Layla and Majnun.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gene Santoro, &quot;Dancing in Your Head: Jazz, Blues, Rock, and Beyond&quot;, Published by Oxford University Press US, 1995.  Excerpt page 62: &quot;At the time, he started to read ''The story of Layla and Majnun'' by the Persian poet [[Nizami Ganjavi]]&lt;/ref&gt; The two parts of &quot;Layla&quot; were recorded in separate sessions: the opening guitar section was recorded first, and for the second section, laid down several months later, drummer Jim Gordon composed and played the piano part.&lt;ref name = &quot;nxfddy&quot;/&gt; 

The ''Layla'' LP was actually recorded by a five-piece version of the group, thanks to the unforeseen inclusion of guitarist [[Duane Allman]] of [[The Allman Brothers Band]]. A few days into the Layla sessions, Dowdâwho was also producing the Allmansâinvited Clapton to an Allman Brothers outdoor concert in Miami. The two guitarists met first on stage, then played all night in the studio, and became friends. Duane first added his [[slide guitar]] to &quot;[[Tell the Truth (song)|Tell the Truth]]&quot; and &quot;[[Nobody Knows You When You're Down and Out]]&quot;. In four days, the five-piece Dominos recorded &quot;[[Key to the Highway]]&quot;, &quot;[[Have You Ever Loved a Woman]]&quot; (a [[blues standard]] popularised by [[Freddie King]] and others), and &quot;Why Does Love Got to be So Sad&quot;. In September, Duane briefly left the sessions for gigs with his own band, and the four-piece Dominos recorded &quot;I Looked Away&quot;, &quot;[[Bell Bottom Blues (Derek and the Dominos song)|Bell Bottom Blues]]&quot;, and &quot;Keep on Growing&quot;. Duane returned to record &quot;I am Yours&quot;, &quot;Anyday&quot;, and &quot;It's Too Late&quot;. On September 9, they recorded Hendrix's &quot;[[Little Wing]]&quot; and the title track. The following day, the final track, &quot;It's Too Late&quot;, was recorded.&lt;ref&gt;&quot;[[The Layla Sessions]]&quot; CD liner notes.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eric &quot;slowhand&quot; Clapton.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Eric Clapton in [[Barcelona]], 1974]]
Tragedy dogged the group throughout its brief career. During the sessions, Clapton was devastated by news of the death of Jimi Hendrix; eight days previously the band had cut a cover of &quot;Little Wing&quot; as a tribute to Hendrix. On {{j|17 September}} 1970, one day before Hendrix's death, Clapton had purchased a [[Left-handedness|left-handed]] [[Fender Stratocaster]] that he had planned to give to Hendrix as a birthday gift. Adding to Clapton's woes, the ''Layla'' album received only lukewarm reviews upon release. The shaken group undertook a U.S. tour without Allman, who had returned to the Allman Brothers Band. Despite Clapton's later admission that the tour took place amidst a veritable blizzard of drugs and alcohol, it resulted in the live double album ''[[In Concert (Derek and the Dominos album)|In Concert]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Layla Sessions]]'' liner notes, page 12.&lt;/ref&gt; The band had recorded several tracks for a second album in London during the spring of 1971 (five of which were released on the Eric Clapton box-set ''Crossroads''), but the results were mediocre.

A second record was in the works when a clashing of egos took place and Clapton walked, thus disbanding the group. Allman was killed in a motorcycle accident on {{j|29 October}} 1971. Although Radle would remain Clapton's bass player until the summer of 1979 (Radle died in May 1980 from the effects of alcohol and narcotics), it would be 2003 before Clapton and Whitlock appeared together again (Clapton guested on Whitlock's appearance on the ''[[Later with Jools Holland]]'' show). Another tragic footnote to the Dominos story was the fate of drummer [[Jim Gordon (musician)|Jim Gordon]], who was an undiagnosed [[schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] and years later murdered his mother during a [[Psychosis|psychotic episode]]. Gordon was confined to 16-years-to-life imprisonment, later being moved to a mental institution, where he remains today.&lt;ref name=&quot;unuhsh&quot;/&gt;

===Solo career===
Clapton's career successes in the 1970s were in stark contrast to his personal life, which was troubled by romantic longings and drug and alcohol addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Marc Roberty, Chris Charlesworth (1995) [http://books.google.com/books?id=qpvlUrpH_xoC&amp;pg=PA67&amp;dq=eric+clapton+DRUGS+1970s&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0K0aTdy1DMiAhQeRqaC4Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The complete guide to the music of Eric Clapton] p.67. Omnibus Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; While suffering his (temporarily) unrequited and intense attraction to Pattie Boyd, he withdrew from recording and touring to isolation in his Surrey, England, residence. There he nursed his [[Substance abuse|heroin addiction]], which resulted in a career hiatus interrupted only by the [[Concert for Bangladesh]] in August 1971 (where he passed out on stage, was revived, and continued his performance).&lt;ref name=&quot;unuhsh&quot;/&gt; In January 1973, [[The Who]]'s [[Pete Townshend]] organised a comeback concert for Clapton at London's [[Rainbow Theatre]], aptly titled the &quot;[[Eric Clapton's Rainbow Concert|Rainbow Concert]]&quot;, to help Clapton kick his addiction. Clapton would return the favour by playing 'The Preacher' in [[Tommy (film)|Ken Russell's film version]] of The Who's ''[[Tommy (rock opera)|Tommy]]'' in 1975; his appearance in the film (performing &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;) is notable as he is clearly wearing a fake beard in some shots, the result of deciding to shave off his real beard after the initial takes in an attempt to force the director to remove his earlier scene from the movie and leave the set.&lt;ref name = &quot;nxfddy&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Clapton and Elliman.jpg|thumb|left|225px|[[Yvonne Elliman]] with Clapton promoting ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' in 1975]]
In 1974, now partnered with Pattie (they would not actually marry until 1979) and no longer using heroin (although starting to drink heavily), Clapton put together a more low-key touring band that included Radle, Miami guitarist [[George Terry]], keyboardist Dick Sims, drummer [[Jamie Oldaker]], and vocalists [[Yvonne Elliman]] and [[Marcy Levy]] (also known as Marcella Detroit). With this band Clapton recorded ''[[461 Ocean Boulevard]]'' (1974), an album with an emphasis on more compact songs and fewer guitar solos; the cover version of &quot;[[I Shot The Sheriff]]&quot; was Clapton's first #1 hit and was important in bringing [[reggae]] and the music of [[Bob Marley]] to a wider audience. The 1975 album ''[[There's One in Every Crowd]]'' continued this trend. The album's original title, ''The World's Greatest Guitar Player (There's One In Every Crowd)'', was changed before pressing, as it was felt its ironic intention would be misunderstood. The band toured the world and subsequently released the 1975 live LP, ''[[E.C. Was Here]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=60Jde3l7WNwC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=E.C.+Was+Here+released+in+1975&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=0LIaTdPiGs2FhQfm4924Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=E.C.%20Was%20Here%20released%20in%201975&amp;f=false Legends of rock guitar: the essential reference of rock's greatest guitarists] p.70. Hal Leonard Corporation, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton continued to release albums and toured regularly. Highlights of the period include ''[[No Reason to Cry]]'' (a collaboration with [[Bob Dylan]] and [[The Band]]); ''[[Slowhand]]'', which featured &quot;[[Wonderful Tonight]]&quot; (another song inspired by Boyd);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/27/books/27masl.html?_r=1&amp;ref=review&amp;oref=slogin|title=The Muse Who Made the Guitars Gently Weep|accessdate=30 December 2010|author= Janet Maslin|date= 27 August 2007|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a second J.J. Cale cover, &quot;[[Cocaine (song)|Cocaine]]&quot;. In 1976 he performed, alongside a string of notable guests, to pay tribute to the farewell performance of The Band, filmed in a [[Martin Scorsese]] documentary called ''[[the Last Waltz]]''.

===1980s===
In 1981 Clapton was invited by producer [[Martin Lewis (humorist)|Martin Lewis]] to appear at the [[Amnesty International]] benefit ''[[The Secret Policeman's Other Ball]]''. Clapton accepted the invitation and teamed up with Jeff Beck to perform a series of duetsâreportedly their first-ever billed stage collaboration. Three of the performances were released on the album of the show, and one of the songs was featured in the film. The performances heralded a return to form and prominence for Clapton in the new decade. Many factors had influenced Clapton's comeback, including his &quot;deepening commitment to Christianity&quot;, to which he had converted prior to his heroin addiction.&lt;ref&gt;Moritz, Charles (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p64692|pure_url=yes}} |work=Allmusic | accessdate=17 February 2007 | title = Eric Clapton | first = William | last = Ruhlmann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After an embarrassing fishing incident, Clapton finally called his manager and admitted he was an [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]]. In January 1982 Roger and Clapton flew to [[Minneapolis â St. Paul]]; Clapton would be checked in at [[Hazelden Foundation|Hazelden Treatment Center]], located in [[Center City, Minnesota]]. On the flight over, Clapton indulged in a large number of drinks, for fear he would never be able to drink again. Clapton is quoted as saying from his autobiography, &quot;In the lowest moments of my life, the only reason I didn't commit suicide was that I knew I wouldn't be able to drink any more if I was dead. It was the only thing I thought was worth living for, and the idea that people were about to try and remove me from alcohol was so terrible that I drank and drank and drank, and they had to practically carry me into the clinic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Clapton, Eric|title = Clapton, The Autobiography|date= 2007 and 2008|publisher= Broadway Books|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After being discharged, it was recommended by doctors of Hazelden that Clapton not partake in any activities that would act as triggers for his alcoholism or stress, until he was fully situated back at Hurtwood. A few months after his discharge, Clapton began working on his next album, against the Hazelden doctors' orders. Working with Tom Dowd, Clapton produced what he thought as his &quot;most forced&quot; album to date, ''[[Money and Cigarettes]]''.

In 1984 he performed on [[Pink Floyd]] member [[Roger Waters]]' solo album, ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', and went on tour with Waters following the release of the album. Since then Waters and Clapton have had a close relationship. In 2005 they performed together for the Tsunami Relief Fund. In 2006 they performed at the Highclere Castle, in aid of the Countryside Alliance, playing two set pieces of &quot;[[Wish You Were Here (Pink Floyd song)|Wish You Were Here]]&quot; and &quot;[[Comfortably Numb]]&quot;. Clapton, now a seasoned charity performer, played at the [[Live Aid]] concert on 13 July 1985. When offered a slot close to peak viewing hours, he was apparently flattered. As Clapton recovered from his addictions, his album output continued in the 1980s, including two produced with [[Phil Collins]], 1985's ''[[Behind the Sun (Eric Clapton album)|Behind the Sun]]'', which produced the hits &quot;Forever Man&quot; and &quot;She's Waiting&quot;, and 1986's ''[[August (album)|August]]''.

[[File:TinaTurner&amp;Clapton.jpg|thumb|225px|left|[[Tina Turner]] and Eric Clapton at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]], {{j|18 June}} 1987]]
''August'' was suffused with Collins's trademark drum and horn sound, and became Clapton's biggest seller in the UK to date, matching his highest chart position, number 3. The album's first track, the hit &quot;It's In The Way That You Use It&quot;, was featured in the [[Tom Cruise]] â [[Paul Newman]] movie ''[[The Color of Money]].'' The horn-peppered &quot;Run&quot; echoed Collins' &quot;Sussudio&quot; and rest of the producer's Genesis/solo output, while &quot;Tearing Us Apart&quot; (with [[Tina Turner]]) and the bitter &quot;Miss You&quot; echoed Clapton's angry sound. This rebound kicked off Clapton's two-year period of touring with Collins and their ''August'' collaborates, bassist [[Nathan East]] and keyboard player/songwriter Greg Phillinganes. While on tour for ''August'', two concert videos were recorded of the four-man band, ''Eric Clapton Live from Montreux'' and ''Eric Clapton and Friends''. Clapton later remade &quot;After Midnight&quot; as a single and a promotional track for the [[Michelob]] beer brand, which had also marketed earlier songs by Collins and [[Steve Winwood]]. Clapton won a [[British Academy Television Award]] for his collaboration with [[Michael Kamen]] on the score for the 1985 [[BBC Television]] thriller serial ''[[Edge of Darkness]]''. In 1989, Clapton released ''[[Journeyman (album)|Journeyman]]'', an album which covered a wide range of styles including blues, jazz, soul and pop. Collaborators included George Harrison, Phil Collins, [[Daryl Hall]], [[Chaka Khan]], [[Mick Jones (Foreigner)|Mick Jones]], [[David Sanborn]] and [[Robert Cray]].

In 1984, while still married to Pattie Boyd, Clapton began a year-long relationship with Yvonne Kelly. The two had a daughter, Ruth, who was born in January 1985, but her existence was kept a secret by her parents. She was not publicly revealed as his child until 1991.&lt;ref name=&quot;dailymailruth&quot;&gt;''Daily Mail'', [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/you/article.html?in_article_id=463772&amp;in_page_id=1908 ''The truth about Eric Clapton's 'Secret Daughter'''].

===1990s===
The 1990s brought a series of 32 concerts to the Royal Albert Hall, such as the [[24 Nights]] series of concerts that took place around January through February 1990, and February through March 1991. On {{j|27 August}} 1990, fellow blues guitarist [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]], who was touring with Clapton, and three members of their road crew were killed in a helicopter crash between concerts. Then, on {{j|20 March}} 1991, Clapton's four-year-old son, Conor, died on impact after a fall from the 53rd-story window of his mother's friend's New York City apartment. He landed on the roof of an adjacent four-story building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obituariestoday.com/Obituaries/ObitShow.php?Obituary_ID=29613/ |title=Obituary of Conor Clapton |publisher=Obituariestoday.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton's grief was expressed in the song &quot;[[Tears in Heaven]]&quot;, which was co-written by [[Will Jennings]]. At the [[35th Grammy Awards]], Clapton received six [[Grammy Awards]] for the single &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; and his ''[[Unplugged (Eric Clapton album)|Unplugged]]'' album.&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=rw8EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;dq=eric+clapton+six+grammy+awards&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JbUaTYbgDsuyhAe4zq23Dg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=eric%20clapton%20six%20grammy%20awards&amp;f=false Billboard 6 Mar 1993] ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' Retrieved 30 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The album reached number one on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]], and has since been certified [[Diamond album|Diamond]] by the [[RIAA]] for selling over 10 million copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=tblDiamond Diamond Awards] ''[[RIAA]]'' Retrieved 28 January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; On 9 September 1992, Clapton performed &quot;Tears in Heaven&quot; at the [[1992 MTV Video Music Awards]] in Los Angeles, and won the award for Best Male Video.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mtv.com/ontv/vma/1992/ 1992 MTV Video Music Awards] MTV.com.

In October 1992 Clapton was among the dozens of artists performing at [[Bob Dylan]]'s [[30th Anniversary Concert Celebration]]. Recorded at [[Madison Square Garden]] in New York City, the live two-disk CD/DVD captured a show full of celebrities performing classic Dylan songs, before ending with a few performances from Dylan himself. Despite the presence of 10 other guitarists on stage, including George Harrison, [[Neil Young]], [[Roger McGuinn]], [[Steve Cropper]], [[Tom Petty]], and Dylan, Clapton played the lead on a nearly 7-minute version of Dylan's &quot;[[Knockin' on Heaven's Door]]&quot; as part of the finale.

While ''Unplugged'' featured Clapton playing [[Steel-string guitar|acoustic guitar]], his 1994 album ''[[From the Cradle]]'' contained new versions of old [[blues standards]], highlighted by his electric guitar playing.&lt;ref&gt;D. Dicaire, ''More blues singers: biographies of 50 artists from the later 20th century'' (McFarland, 2001), p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton's 1996 recording of the [[Wayne Kirkpatrick]]/[[Gordon Kennedy (musician)|Gordon Kennedy]]/[[Tommy Sims]] tune &quot;Change the World&quot; (featured in the soundtrack of the movie ''[[Phenomenon (film)|Phenomenon]]'') won the [[Grammy Award for Song of the Year]] in 1997, the same year he recorded ''Retail Therapy'' (an album of [[electronic music]] with [[Simon Climie]] under the [[pseudonym]] [[X-sample|TDF]]). The following year, Clapton released the album ''[[Pilgrim (Eric Clapton album)|Pilgrim]]'', the first record featuring new material for almost a decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;amg&quot; /&gt; Clapton finished the twentieth century with collaborations with [[Carlos Santana]] and [[B. B. King]].

In 1996 Clapton had a relationship with singer/songwriter [[Sheryl Crow]]. They remain friends, and Clapton appeared as a guest on Crow's Central Park Concert. The duo performed a Cream hit single, &quot;[[White Room]]&quot;. Later, Clapton and Crow performed an alternate version of &quot;Tulsa Time&quot; with other guitar legends at the [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]] in June 2007.

In 1998 Clapton, then 53, met 22-year-old administrative assistant Melia McEnery in [[Columbus, Ohio]], at a party given for him after a performance. He quietly dated her for a year, and went public with the relationship in 1999. They married on {{j|1 January}} 2002 at St Mary Magdalene church in Clapton's birthplace, [[Ripley, Surrey|Ripley]]. As of 2005 they have three daughters, Julie Rose ({{j|13 June}} 2001), Ella May ({{j|14 January}} 2003), and Sophie Belle ({{j|1 February}} 2005).

===2000s===

Following the release of the 2001 record ''[[Reptile (album)|Reptile]]'', Eric performed &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;While My Guitar Gently Weeps&quot; at the [[Party at the Palace]] in 2002. On 29 November of that year the [[Concert for George]] was held at the Royal Albert Hall, a tribute to George Harrison, who had died a year earlier of cancer. Clapton was a performer and the musical director. The concert featured [[Paul McCartney]], Ringo Starr, [[Jeff Lynne]], [[Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers]], [[Ravi Shankar]], [[Gary Brooker]], Billy Preston, [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] and [[Dhani Harrison]]. In 2004, Clapton released two albums of covers of songs by legendary bluesman [[Robert Johnson (musician)|Robert Johnson]], ''[[Me and Mr. Johnson]]'' and ''[[Me and Mr. Johnson#Sessions for Robert J|Sessions for Robert J]]''. The same year, ''Rolling Stone'' ranked Clapton #53 on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Artists of All Time&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title = The Immortals| journal=Rolling Stone |issue=946 | url =http://www.rollingstone.com/news/coverstory/the_immortals}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 January 2005, Clapton performed in the [[Tsunami Relief Cardiff|Tsunami Relief Concert]] held at the [[Millennium Stadium]] in [[Cardiff]], in aid of the victims of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake]]. In May 2005 Eric Clapton, Jack Bruce, and Ginger Baker reunited as Cream for a series of concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London. Concert recordings were released on CD and DVD. Later, Cream performed in New York at [[Madison Square Garden]]. ''[[Back Home (Eric Clapton album)|Back Home]]'', Clapton's first album of new original material in nearly five years, was released on [[Reprise Records]] on {{j|30 August}}. In 2006 he invited [[Derek Trucks]] and [[Doyle Bramhall II]] to join his band for his 2006â2007 world tour. Trucks is the third member of the Allman Brothers Band to tour supportng Clapton, the second being pianist/keyboardist [[Chuck Leavell]], who appeared on the ''[[MTV Unplugged]]'' album and the ''[[24 Nights]]'' performances at the Royal Albert Hall theatre of London in 1990 and 1991, as well as Clapton's 1992 U.S. tour.

On 20 May 2006, Clapton performed with [[Queen (band)|Queen]] drummer [[Roger Meddows-Taylor|Roger Taylor]] and former [[Pink Floyd]] bassist/songwriter [[Roger Waters]] at the [[Highclere Castle]], in support of the Countryside Alliance. On {{j|13 August}} 2006, Clapton made a guest appearance at the Bob Dylan concert in [[Columbus, Ohio]], playing guitar on three songs in [[Jimmie Vaughan]]'s opening act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://uweekly.com/cowtown/?p=121 | title = God has a summer home in Columbus | work=[[UWeekly]] | date = 15 August 2005 | accessdate=30 March 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A collaboration with guitarist [[J. J. Cale]], titled ''[[The Road to Escondido]]'', was released on {{j|7 November}} 2006, featuring Derek Trucks and Billy Preston. The 14-track CD was produced and recorded by the duo in August 2005 in California. The chemistry between Trucks and Clapton convinced him to invite [[The Derek Trucks Band]] to open for Clapton's set at his 2007 [[Crossroads Guitar Festival]].

In 2007 Clapton learned more about his father, a Canadian soldier who left the UK after the war. Although Clapton's grandparents eventually told him the truth about his parentage, he only knew that his father's name was Edward Fryer. This was a source of disquiet for Clapton, as witnessed by his 1998 song &quot;[[My Father's Eyes (song)|My Father's Eyes]]&quot;. A [[Montreal]] journalist named Michael Woloschuk researched Canadian Armed Forces service records and tracked down members of Fryer's family, and finally pieced together the story. He learned that Clapton's father was Edward Walter Fryer, born {{j|21 March}} 1920, in [[Montreal]] and died {{j|15 May 1985}} in [[Newmarket, Ontario]]. Fryer was a musician (piano and [[saxophone]]) and a lifelong drifter who was married several times, had several children, and apparently never knew that he was the father of Eric Clapton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=[[Ottawa Citizen]] | url = http://www.eric-clapton.co.uk/interviewsandarticles/hisfatherseyes.htm | title = His Father's Eyes | first = Michael | last = Woloschuk | accessdate=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton thanked Woloschuk in an encounter at Macdonald Cartier Airport, in Ottawa, Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=[[Canoe Jam]] | url = http://jam.canoe.ca/Music/Artists/C/Clapton_Eric/1998/09/16/743979.html| title = Clapton Thanks Reporter | first = Michael | last = Woloschuk | accessdate=17 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2008 Clapton performed with his long-time friend [[Steve Winwood]] at Madison Square Garden and guested on his recorded single, &quot;Dirty City&quot;, on Winwood's album ''[[Nine Lives (Steve Winwood album)|Nine Lives]]''. The two former Blind Faith bandmates met again for a series of 14 concerts throughout the United States in June 2009.

Clapton's 2008 Summer Tour began on {{j|3 May}} at the Ford Amphitheatre, [[Tampa Bay]], Florida, and then moved to Canada, Ireland, England, Norway, Iceland, Denmark, Poland, Germany, and Monaco. On {{j|28 June}} 2008, he headlined Saturday night for [[Hard Rock Calling]] 2008 in London's Hyde Park (previously Hyde Park Calling) with support from [[Sheryl Crow]] and [[John Mayer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://2008.hardrockcalling.co.uk/ |title=Hard Rock Calling |publisher=Hard Rock Calling |work=Live Nation (Music) UK Limited |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ericclapton-online.com/2008-summer-tour/hard-rock-calling-hyde-park-london-saturday-28-june-2008.html |title=Hard Rock Calling, Hyde Park, London Saturday 28&amp;nbsp;June 2008 |publisher=Eric Clapton Online |accessdate=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2008 Clapton performed at a private charity fundraiser for The Countryside Alliance at Floridita in [[Soho]], London, that included such guests as the London Mayor [[Boris Johnson]].

In March 2009, the Allman Brothers Band (amongst many notable guests) celebrated their 40th year, dedicating their string of concerts to the late Duane Allman on their annual run at the [[Beacon Theatre (New York City)|Beacon Theatre]]. Eric Clapton was one of the performers, with drummer [[Butch Trucks]] remarking that the performance was not the typical Allman Brothers experience, given the number and musical styles of the guests who were invited to perform.

On {{j|4 May}} 2009 Clapton appeared as a featured guest at the Royal Albert Hall, playing &quot;[[Further on Up the Road]]&quot; with [[Joe Bonamassa]].

&quot;...the most important blues musician who ever lived. He was true, absolutely, to his own vision, and as deep as I have gotten into the music over the last 30 years, I have never found anything more deeply soulful than Robert Johnson. His music remains the most powerful cry that I think you can find in the human voice, really. ... it seemed to echo something I had always felt.&quot;

Clapton's choice of electric guitars has been as notable as the man himself; alongside [[Hank Marvin]], [[The Beatles]] and Jimi Hendrix, Clapton exerted a crucial and widespread influence in popularising particular models of electric guitar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendarytones.com/claptonearly1.html |title=Clapton â The early years |publisher=Legendarytones.com |date=31 July 1966 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Yardbirds, Clapton played a [[Fender Telecaster]], a [[Fender Jazzmaster]], a double-cutaway [[Gretsch 6120]], and a 1964 Cherry-Red [[Gibson]] [[Gibson ES-335|ES-335]]. He became exclusively a Gibson player for a period beginning in mid-1965, when he purchased a used [[Gibson Les Paul|Gibson Les Paul Sunburst]] Standard guitar from a guitar store in London. Clapton commented on the slim profile of the neck, which would indicate it was a 1960 model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xs4all.nl/~slowhand/ecfaq/Le%20Paul.htm |title=Clapton's Bluesbreakers Guitar Was A 1960 Gibson Les Paul Standard |publisher=Xs4all.nl |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}{{dead link|date=July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early during his stint in Cream, Clapton's first Les Paul Standard was stolen.

In July 1968 Clapton gave George Harrison a red refinished Les Paul. The following September, Clapton played the guitar on the Beatles' studio recording of &quot;[[While My Guitar Gently Weeps]]&quot;. His SG found its way into the hands of George Harrison's friend [[Jackie Lomax]], who subsequently sold it to musician [[Todd Rundgren]] for US$500 in 1972. Rundgren restored the guitar and nicknamed it &quot;Sunny&quot;, after &quot;Sunshine of Your Love&quot;. He retained it until 2000, when he sold it at an auction for US$150,000.&lt;ref name =GIBS/&gt; At the 1969 Blind Faith concert in [[Hyde Park, London]] Clapton played a [[Fender]] Custom [[Telecaster]], which was fitted with &quot;[[Brownie (guitar)|Brownie]]&quot;{{'}}s neck.

In late 1969 Clapton made the switch to the [[Fender Stratocaster]]. &quot;I had a lot of influences when I took up the Strat. First there was [[Buddy Holly]], and [[Buddy Guy]]. Hank Marvin was the first well known person over here in England who was using one, but that wasn't really my kind of music.

His [[George Lowden|Lowden]] acoustic guitar sold for $41,825. The revenue garnered by this auction at Christie's was US $7,438,624.&lt;ref name = &quot;cdqimo&quot;/&gt;

In 2010 Eric Clapton announced that he would be auctioning off over 150 items at a New York auction in 2011. Proceeds will benefit his Crossroads Centre in Antigua. Items include Clapton's guitar from the Cream reunion tour in 2005, speaker cabinets used in the early 1970s from his days with Derek and the Dominoes, and some guitars from Jeff Beck, J.J. Cale, and Joe Bonamassa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iknowjack.radio.com/2010/12/10/eric-clapton-will-auction-vintage-guitars-amps-for-his-crossroads-centre/ |title=Eric Clapton Will Auction Vintage Guitars &amp; Amps For His Crossroads Centre }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011 Clapton raised more than $2.15 million dollars when he auctioned off key items, including a 1984 Gibson [[Semi-acoustic guitar|hollow body guitar]], a [[Gianni Versace]] suit from his 1990 concert at the Royal Albert Hall, and a replica of the famous Fender Stratocaster known as &quot;Blackie&quot;, which fetched more than $30,000. All proceeds from the auction were donated to Clapton's Crossroads drug and rehabilitation centre in Antigua.

The &quot;'''woman tone'''&quot; is the informal term used by Clapton to refer to his distinctive mid- to late-1960s electric guitar sound, created using his [[Gibson SG]] solid body guitar (with [[Humbucker]] pick-ups) and a [[Marshall Amplifiers|Marshall]] [[vacuum tube|tube]] amplifier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Get Clapton's Classic 'Woman Tone'|author= Ted Drozdowski|date= 9 January 2009|work=Lifestyle|publisher=Gibson.com|accessdate=6 August 2010|url=http://www.gibson.com/en-us/Lifestyle/ProductSpotlight/Tone-Tips/how-to-get-claptons-classic/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an overdriven sound that is articulate yet thick. It is characterised by being quite distorted (or even achieved with a fuzz) but muted, in contrast to the bright and twangy distortion that most guitarists were using at the time. Many players have tried to duplicate it, usually without success, in part because Clapton's playing technique had a lot to do with the tone.

Among the techniques used to replicate Clapton's sound is a technique by which the amplifier's volume is turned up to full, while the guitar's tone knob is turned down to zero or one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ââ |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rq6r23-le5o |title=Eric Clapton Shows Some Guitar Skills |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best examples of the &quot;woman tone&quot; are Clapton's famous riff and solo from Cream's 1967 hit &quot;[[Sunshine of Your Love]]&quot;. Clapton has explained that he obtained the tone with his Gibson's tone control rolled all the way down, switching to the neck pick-up (closest to the fretboard) and the volume all the way up, with his distortion turned all the way up. The treble, mids and bass controls on the amplifier were also maxed out. Some versions of the &quot;woman tone&quot; may also have involved strategic positioning of Clapton's [[wah-wah pedal]].

==Other media appearances==
Clapton frequently appears as a guest on the albums of other musicians. For example, he is credited on [[Dire Straits]]{{'}}s ''[[Brothers in Arms (Dire Straits album)|Brothers in Arms]]'' album, as he lent Mark Knopfler one of his guitars. He played lead guitar and synthesiser on ''[[The Pros and Cons of Hitch Hiking]]'', [[Roger Waters]]' debut solo album. Other media appearances include the [[Toots &amp; the Maytals]] album ''[[True Love (Toots &amp; the Maytals album)|True Love]]'', where he played guitar on the track &quot;[[Pressure Drop (song)|Pressure Drop]]&quot;. He can also be heard at the beginning of [[Frank Zappa]]'s album, ''[[We're Only in It for the Money]]'', repeating the phrase, &quot;Are you hung up?&quot; over and over again. In 1985, Clapton appeared on the charity concert [[Live Aid]] in [[Philadelphia]] with [[Phil Collins]], [[Tim Renwick]], [[Chris Stainton]], [[Jamie Oldaker]], [[Marcy Levy]], [[Shaun Murphy (singer)|Shaun Murphy]], and [[Donald 'Duck' Dunn]]. In 1988 he played with Dire Straits and [[Elton John]] at the [[Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute]] at [[Wembley Stadium]] and the [[Prince's Trust]] rock gala at the Royal Albert Hall. On {{j|30 June}} 1990, Dire Straits, Clapton, and [[Elton John]] made a guest appearance in the [[Nordoff-Robbins]] charity show held at [[Concerts at Knebworth House|Knebworth]].&lt;ref&gt;Tobler, John: ''Who's who in rock &amp; roll'' p.1988. Crescent Books, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991 Clapton was featured on [[Richie Sambora]]'s album, ''[[Stranger In This Town]]'', in a song dedicated to him, called &quot;Mr. Bluesman&quot;.  He contributed guitar and vocals to &quot;Runaway Train&quot;, a duet with Elton John on the latter's ''[[The One (Elton John album)|The One]]'' album the following year.

On 12 September 1996 Clapton played a party for [[Armani]] at New York City's Lexington Armory with [[Greg Phillinganes]], [[Nathan East]], and [[Steve Gadd]]. Sheryl Crow appeared on one number, performing &quot;[[Tearing Us Apart]]&quot;, a track from ''August'', which was first performed by [[Tina Turner]] during the Prince's Trust All-Star Rock show in 1986. It was Clapton's sole US appearance that year, following the [[Live In Hyde Park (Eric Clapton album)|open-air concert]] held at [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] with [[Dave Bronze]], [[Andy Fairweather-Low]], [[The Kick Horns]], [[Jerry Portnoy]], [[Chris Stainton]], and backing vocalists [[Katie Kissoon]] and [[Tessa Niles]]. The concert was taped and the footage was released both on VHS video cassette and later, on DVD.

Clapton was featured in the movie version of ''[[Tommy (film)|Tommy]]'', the first full length [[rock opera]], written by [[The Who]]. The movie version gave Clapton a [[cameo appearance]] as The Preacher, performing [[Sonny Boy Williamson II|Sonny Boy Williamson]]'s song, &quot;Eyesight to the Blind&quot;. He appeared in ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'' as one of the Louisiana Gator Boys. In addition to being in the band, he had a small speaking role. Clapton has appeared in an advertisement for the [[Mercedes-Benz G-Class|Mercedes-Benz G-Wagen]]. In March 2007 Clapton appeared in an advertisement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; for [[RealNetworks|RealNetwork's]] [[Rhapsody (online music service)|Rhapsody online music service]]. In 2010 Clapton started appearing as a spokesman for [[T-Mobile]], advertising their [[HTC Magic|MyTouch]] Fender cell phone.

Eric Clapton was compared to God's image in the episode &quot;[[Holy Crap!]]&quot; of season two of ''[[That '70s Show]]'' when characters [[Eric Forman]] and [[Steven Hyde]] are asked by their minister to draw a picture of God.

==Political views and advocacy==
Clapton is a supporter of the [[Countryside Alliance]], he has played in concerts to raise funds for the organisation and he publicly opposed the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]âs ban on [[fox hunting]].  A spokesperson for Clapton said, &quot;Eric supports the Countryside Alliance. He doesn't hunt himself, but does enjoy rural pursuits such as fishing and shooting. He supports the Alliance's pursuit to scrap the ban on the basis that he doesn't agree with the state's interference with people's private pursuits.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.contactmusic.com/new/xmlfeed.nsf/story/clapton-headlines-pro-hunt-concert_30_04_2006 | title= Clapton headlines pro-hunt concert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy over remarks on immigration===
On 5 August 1976 Clapton provoked an uproar and lingering controversy when he spoke out against [[Immigration to the United Kingdom (1922-present day)|increasing immigration]] during a concert in [[Birmingham]]. Visibly intoxicated, Clapton voiced his support of controversial political candidate [[Enoch Powell]], and announced on stage that Britain was in danger of becoming a &quot;black colony&quot;. Clapton was quoted as saying, &quot;I think Enoch's right ... we should send them all back. Throw the [[wog]]s out! Keep Britain white!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/print/0,,330925087-111639,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The ten right-wing rockers | first=Luke | last=Bainbridge | date=14 October 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter phrase was at the time a [[British National Front]] slogan.&lt;ref&gt;{{citenews|work=The Independent |location=UK|accessdate=18 January 2010|title=Dabbling in right wing politics â David Bowie, Brian Ferry and Eric Clapton|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/features/the-ten-worst-rocknroll-career-moves-1774270.html?action=Popup&amp;ino=3 | location=London | first=John | last=Hall | date=19 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clapton continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;I used to be into dope, now Iâm into racism. Itâs much heavier, man. Fucking wogs, man. Fucking Saudis taking over London. Bastard wogs. Britain is becoming overcrowded and Enoch will stop it and send them all back. The black wogs and coons and Arabs and fucking Jamaicans and fucking (indecipherable) donât belong here, we donât want them here. This is England, this is a white country, we donât want any black wogs and coons living here. We need to make clear to them they are not welcome. England is for white people, man. We are a white country. I donât want fucking wogs living next to me with their standards. This is Great Britain, a white country, what is happening to us, for fuck's sake? We need to vote for Enoch Powell, heâs a great man, speaking truth. Vote for Enoch, heâs our man, heâs on our side, heâll look after us. I want all of you here to vote for Enoch, support him, heâs on our side. Enoch for Prime Minister! Throw the wogs out! Keep Britain white!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;''Rebel Rock'' by J. Street. First Edition (1986).Oxford Press Basil Blackwell.pp.74â75.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This incident, along with some explicitly pro-[[fascism]] remarks made around the same time by [[David Bowie]] as well as uses of Nazi-related imagery by [[Sid Vicious]] and [[Siouxsie Sioux]], were the main catalysts for the creation of [[Rock Against Racism]], which occurred on {{j|30 April}} 1978.&lt;ref name=racism&gt;{{citenews|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/apr/20/popandrock.race|first=Sarfraz|last=Manzoor|date=20 April 2008|accessdate=18 January 2010|work=The Observer |location=UK|title=The year rock found the power to unite | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to the comments, rock photographer Red Saunders and others published an open letter in ''NME'', ''Melody Maker'', ''Sounds'', and the ''Socialist Worker''. It read &quot;Come on Eric... Own up. Half your music is black. You're rock music's biggest colonist&quot;. It concluded, &quot;P.S. Who shot the Sheriff, Eric? It sure as hell wasn't you!&quot;&lt;ref name=racism/&gt;

In an interview from October 1976 with ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'' magazine, Clapton remarked, &quot;I thought it was quite funny actually. I don't know much about politics. I don't even know if it would be good or bad for him to get in. I don't even know who the Prime Minister is now. I just don't know what came over me that night. It must have been something that happened in the day but it came out in this garbled thing... I thought the whole thing was like Monty Python. There's this rock group playing on-stage and the singer starts talking about politics. It's so stupid. Those people who paid their money sittin' listening to this madman dribbling on and the band meanwhile getting fidgety thinking 'oh dear'.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Farther On&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theband.hiof.no/articles/clapton_interview_sounds_oct_1976.html|title=Eric Clapton: Farther On Up The Road|last=Charone|first=Barbara|date=October 1976, (again, 1996)|work=Reprint for the web, article from Sounds Magazine|publisher=Sounds Magazine|accessdate=19 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 interview with ''[[Uncut (magazine)|Uncut]]'', Clapton referred to Powell as &quot;outrageously brave&quot;, and stated that his &quot;feeling about this has not changed&quot;, because the UK is still &quot;... inviting people in as cheap labour and then putting them in ghettos.&quot; In 2004 Clapton told an interviewer for ''[[Scotland on Sunday]]'', &quot;There's no way I could be a racist. It would make no sense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com/review.cfm?id=408192004 |title=dead link |publisher=Scotlandonsunday.scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton called himself &quot;deliberately oblivious to it all&quot; and wrote, &quot;I had never really understood or been directly affected by racial conflict ... when I listened to music, I was disinterested in where the players came from or what colour their skin was. Interesting, then, that 10 years later, I would be labelled a racist ... Since then, I have learnt to keep my opinions to myself. Of course, it might also have had something to do with the fact that Pattie had just been leered at by a member of the Saudi royal family.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/review/story/0,,2195792,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=The gospel according to God | date=21 October 2007 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a December 2007 interview with [[Melvin Bragg]] on ''[[The South Bank Show]]'', Clapton reiterated his support for Enoch Powell and again denied that Powell's views were &quot;racist&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Eric Clapton |episodelink= |url= |series=The South Bank Show |serieslink=The South Bank Show |credits= |network=ITV |station= |city= |airdate=2 December 2007 |began= |ended= |season= |number= |minutes= |transcript= |transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wealth and assets==
In 2009 ''Surrey Life Magazine'' ranked Eric Clapton as number 17 in their list of richest [[Surrey]] residents, estimating Clapton's fortune at Â£120 million in assets. This was a compilation of property and income which include a Â£9 million [[yacht]], &quot;Va Bene&quot; (previously owned by ''[[F1 Racing]]'' magazine's [[Bernie Ecclestone]]), his back [[music catalog]]ue, his touring income, and his [[Marshbrook]] [[holding company]], which had earned him Â£110 million since 1989.&lt;ref name=&quot;Clapton's estimated wealth&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://surrey.greatbritishlife.co.uk/article/surreys-richest-50-the-top-ten-2497/|title=Surrey's Richest 50; The Top Ten|last=Beresford|first=Philip|date=June 2009|work=Rank of the wealthiest residents of Surrey, England|publisher=Surrey Life Magazine|accessdate=27 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Football==
In 1982 he performed a concert before [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] player [[John Wile|John Wile's]] testimonial game at the [[Hawthorns]], and it is often reported by various sources that Clapton (despite being from London more than 100 miles away) is an Albion supporter.
Credence for this notion can be taken from the cover pictures to the &quot;[[Backless]]&quot; solo album, where he is seen on the front cover to be wearing a football scarf; the rear cover [http://www.free-covers.org/cd-covers/eric-clapton-backless-1978-cd-cover-1335.html photograph] reveals the slogan &quot;ALBION&quot; on the scarf. It has been reported that the club rejected his offer to invest cash in the club around this time, and that he has since expressed more of an interest in [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baggies.com/celebrities/ |title=BOING: The rich and famous celebrities who support West Bromwich Albion FC |publisher=Baggies.com |date=12 June 2005 |accessdate=22 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
