The '''Adobe Flash Player''' is software for viewing [[multimedia]], [[Rich Internet Application]]s and streaming video and audio, on a computer [[web browser]] or on supported mobile devices. Flash Player runs [[SWF]] files that can be created by the [[Adobe Flash]] authoring tool, by [[Adobe Flex]] or by a number of other [[Macromedia]] and third party tools. Flash Player was created by [[Macromedia]] and now developed and distributed by [[Adobe Systems]] after its acquisition. Flash Player supports [[vector graphics|vector]] and [[raster graphics]], [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]], an embedded scripting language called [[ActionScript]] and streaming of video and audio. [[ActionScript]] is based on [[ECMAScript]], and has supports [[object-oriented code]], and may be compared to [[JavaScript]]. Flash Player has a wide user base, with over 99% penetration on internet connected personal computers, and is a common format for games, animations, and [[Graphical user interface|GUIs]] embedded into web pages.

Flash Player is freely available as a plugin for recent versions of web browsers (such as [[Internet Explorer]], [[Mozilla Firefox]], [[Opera (web browser)|Opera]], and [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]) on selected platforms. [[Google Chrome]] integrated the player into the distribution. Each version of the plugin is backwards-compatible.

Flash Player is used internally by the [[Adobe Integrated Runtime]] (Adobe AIR), in order to provide a cross-platform runtime environment for [[desktop applications]] and mobile applications. The runtime supports installable applications on [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS]] and some mobile operating systems such as [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]]. Flash applications must specifically be built for the Adobe AIR runtime in order to utilize additional features provided, such as file system integration, native client extensions, native window/screen integration, taskbar/dock integration, and hardware integration with connected [[Accelerometer]] and [[GPS]] devices.&lt;ref&gt;[www.adobe.com/products/air.html Adobe AIR 3], Adobe&lt;/ref&gt;

==Runtime==
Adobe Flash Player is a runtime that executes and displays content from a provided [[SWF]] file. The SWF File Format has recently become an [[open format]] standard. Adobe has not been willing to make complete source code of the Flash Player available for [[free software]] development. The source code for the ActionScript Virtual Machine has been released as a project named [[Tamarin (JavaScript engine)|Tamarin]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mozilla.org/projects/tamarin/ Tamarin Project]. Mozilla.org (2010-10-05). Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt; under the terms of an [[Mozilla Public License|MPL]]/[[GPL]]/[[LGPL]] tri-license. It includes the specification for the ActionScript byte code format. This project is jointly managed by Mozilla and Adobe. The full specification of the SWF format is available without restriction by Adobe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/devnet/swf.html SWF Technology Center | Adobe Developer Connection].

==Privacy==
{{See also|Local Shared Object}}

Flash Player supports persistent local storage of data (also referred to as [[Local Shared Object|local shared objects]]), which can be used similarly to [[HTTP cookie]]s or [[Web Storage]] in [[web application]]s. Local storage in Flash Player allows websites to store non-executable data on a user's computer, such as authentication information, game high scores or saved games, server-based session identifiers, site preferences, saved work, or temporary files. Flash Player will only allow content originating from exactly the same website [[domain name|domain]] to access data saved in local storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/articles/lso/
|title=What Is a Local Shared Object?
|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]
|accessdate=1 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because local storage can be used to save information on a computer that is later retrieved by the same site, a site can use it to gather user statistics, similar to how HTTP cookies and Web Storage can be used. With such technologies, the possibility of building a profile based on user statistics is considered by some a potential [[Internet privacy|privacy concern]]. Users can disable or restrict use of local storage in Flash Player through a web-based &quot;Settings Manager&quot; page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager.html
|title=Adobe Flash Player Settings Manager
|publisher=[[Adobe Systems]]
|accessdate=1 July 2010
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These settings can be accessed from the Adobe website or by right-clicking on Flash -based content and selecting &quot;Global Settings...&quot;

Local storage can be disabled entirely or on a site-by-site basis. Disabling local storage will block any content from saving local user information using Flash Player, but this may disable or reduce the functionality of some websites, such as saved preferences or high scores and saved progress in games. Due to exceptions generated by many flash applications when local storage is turned off, video may never appear, or the player may appear to crash due to the latest 3.x Firefox plugin container implementation.

Beginning with Flash Player 10.1, Flash Player supports the [[privacy mode]] settings in the latest versions of the Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Safari web browsers, such that no local storage data is saved when the browser's privacy mode is in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Release history==

Adobe Flash [https://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/releasenotes.html release notes] do not disclose the security issues addressed when a release closes security holes, making it difficult to evaluate the urgency of a particular update.

* '''Macromedia Flash Player 2''' (1997)
** Mostly vectors and motion, some [[bitmap]]s, limited audio
** Support of stereo sound, enhanced bitmap integration, buttons, the Library, and the capability to [[Inbetweening|tween]] color changes.
* '''Macromedia Flash Player 3''' (1998)
** Added alpha transparency, licensed [[MP3]] compression
** Brought improvements to animation, playback, and publishing, as well as the introduction of simple script commands for interactivity.
* '''Macromedia Flash Player 4''' (May 1999)
**  Saw the introduction of [[Internet streaming|streaming]] MP3s and the Motion Tween. Initially, the Flash Player plug-in was not bundled with popular web browsers and users had to visit Macromedia website to download it; As of 2000, however, the Flash Player was already being distributed with all [[AOL]], [[Netscape]] and [[Internet Explorer]] browsers. Two years later it shipped with all releases of [[Windows XP]].  The install-base of the Flash Player reached 92 percent of all Internet users.
* '''Macromedia Flash Player 5''' (August 2000)
** A major leap forward in capability, with the evolution of Flash's scripting capabilities as released as ActionScript.
** Saw the ability to customize the authoring environment's [[User interface|interface]].
** [[Macromedia Generator]] was the first initiative from Macromedia to separate design from content in Flash files. Generator 2.0 was released in April 2001 and featured real-time server-side generation of Flash content in its Enterprise Edition. Generator was discontinued in 2002 in favor of new technologies such as [[Flash Remoting]], which allows for seamless transmission of data between the server and the client, and [[ColdFusion]] Server.
** In October 2000, [[usability]] guru [[Jakob Nielsen (usability consultant)|Jakob Nielsen]] wrote a polemic article regarding usability of Flash content entitled &quot;[http://www.useit.com/alertbox/20001029.html Flash 99% Bad]&quot;. (Macromedia later hired Nielsen to help them improve Flash usability.)
[[Image:Flash logo.PNG|thumb|right|200px|The old Macromedia Flash Player logo]]
* '''Macromedia Flash Player 6''' (version 6.0.21.0, codenamed ''[[Exorcist]]'') (March 2002)
** Support for the consuming Flash Remoting ([[Action Message Format|AMF]]) and Web Service ([[SOAP]])
** Supports ondemand/live audio and video streaming ([[Real Time Messaging Protocol|RTMP]])
** Support for screenreaders via Microsoft Active Accessibility
** Added [[Sorenson Spark]] video [[codec]] for [[Flash Video]]&lt;ref&gt;Macromedia, Inc. (2002-03-04) [http://www.adobe.com/macromedia/proom/pr/2002/flash_mx_video.html Macromedia and Sorenson Media bring video to Macromedia Flash content and applications], Retrieved on 2009-08-09&lt;/ref&gt;
** Support for video, application components, shared libraries, and accessibility.
** Macromedia Flash Communication Server MX, also released in 2002, allowed video to be streamed to Flash Player 6 (otherwise the video could be embedded into the Flash movie).
* '''Macromedia Flash Player 7''' (version 7.0.14.0, codenamed ''Mojo'') (September 2003)
** Supports progressive audio and video streaming ([[HTTP]])

** Ability to create charts, graphs and additional text effects with the new support for extensions (sold separately), high fidelity import of [[PDF]] and [[Adobe Illustrator]] 10 files, mobile and device development and a forms-based development environment.  ActionScript 2.0 was also introduced, giving developers a formal Object-Oriented approach to ActionScript.  V2 Components replaced Flash MX's components, being rewritten from the ground up to take advantage of ActionScript 2.0 and Object-Oriented principles.
** In 2004, the &quot;Flash Platform&quot; was introduced.  This expanded Flash to more than the Flash authoring tool.  [[Adobe Flex|Flex]] 1.0 and [[Macromedia Breeze|Breeze]] 1.0 were released, both of which utilized the Flash Player as a delivery method but relied on tools other than the Flash authoring program to create Flash applications and presentations.  Flash Lite 1.1 was also released, enabling mobile phones to play Flash content.
* '''Macromedia Flash Player 8''' (version 8.0.22.0, codenamed ''[[Maelstrom]]'') (August 2005)
** Support for runtime loading of GIF and PNG images
** New video codec ([[On2]] [[VP6]])

==Criticism==
In April 2010, [[Steve Jobs]], former CEO of [[Apple Inc.]] criticised the stability of the Flash Player, claiming that when one of Apple's [[Macintosh]] computers crashes, &quot;more often than not&quot; the cause can be attributed to Flash. Additionally, he labeled Flash as &quot;buggy&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/steve-jobs-unleashes-his-fury-during-town-hall-meeting/ |title=Steve Jobs Unleashes His Fury During Town Hall Meeting |last=Cassella |first=Dena |date=2010-02-01 |accessdate=2010-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adobe's CEO [[Shantanu Narayen]] responded by saying, &quot;If Flash [is] the number one reason that Macs crash, which I'm not aware of, it has as much to do with the Apple operating system.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Richmond, Shane. (2010-04-30) [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/technology/shanerichmond/100005034/adobe-hits-back-at-apples-smokescreen/ Adobe hits back at Apple's 'smokescreen' â Telegraph Blogs]. Blogs.telegraph.co.uk. Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite 64-bit operating systems being mainstream for 5 years and the majority of PC's sold today running 64-bit Windows, Adobe did not release a version of Adobe Flash Player for 64-bit browsers until 2011, playing a part in holding back the use of 64-bit browsers.

With version 11 Adobe ditched support for exporting content created by [[Macromedia FreeHand]] in SWF file format, despite the fact that Flash Player 11 is backwardly compatible to any other SWF version and FreeHand is an Adobe product.

== Apple controversy ==

As of 2011, Flash Player has emerged as the [[de facto]] standard for online video publishing on the desktop, with adaptive bitrate video streaming, [[Digital rights management|DRM]], and fullscreen support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apiblog.youtube.com/2010/06/flash-and-html5-tag.html Flash and the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag], YouTube Blog&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.hulu.com/2010/05/13/pardon-our-dust/ Pardon Our Dust], Hulu Blog&lt;/ref&gt; On mobile devices however, after major operating system providers such as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] and [[Microsoft]] refused to allow Flash Player within web browsers, Adobe has stopped all Flash Player development for mobile browsers in favor of [[HTML5]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-501465_162-57321344-501465/adobe-abandons-flash-player-on-mobile-browsers-for-html5/ Adobe abandons Flash Player on mobile browsers for HTML5], CBS News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/news/8879783/Adobe-abandons-Flash-for-mobile-devices.html Adobe abandons Flash for mobile devices], The Telegraph&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, [[Steve Jobs]], former CEO of [[Apple Inc.]] published an open letter explaining why Apple wouldn't allow Flash on the [[iPhone]], [[iPod touch]] and [[iPad]], citing the following technical reasons:

* '''Openness:''' Jobs wrote &quot;Adobe's Flash products are 100% proprietary&quot;. Various portions of the Flash Player and its related SDKs are open-source, including the Adobe Flex SDK which compiles SWF files from source code, the Tamarin [[JIT]] Virtual Machine for ActionScript 3, and the recent [[Open Screen Project]] which removes licensing fees and opens data protocols for Flash. The Flash community is also supported by open-source projects, such as [[FlashDevelop]] (IDE), MTASC (Compiler) and [[Gnash]] (alternative Flash Player).&lt;ref&gt;[http://truegryc.blogspot.com/2010/05/response-to-thoughts-on-flash.html Response to âThoughts on Flashâ], True Gryc Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Access:''' Jobs claimed that a large percentage of the video on the internet is supported on iOS, and writes &quot;almost all this video is also available in a more modern format, H.264&quot;. [[H.264]] is a proprietary specification and encumbered by patents, which makes it a closed standard. Many popular video sharing websites such as [[YouTube]] have also published video content in an [[HTML5]] compatible format, enabling videos to playback in mobile web browsers even without Flash Player.&lt;ref&gt;[http://youtube-global.blogspot.com/2010/07/youtube-mobile-gets-kick-start.html YouTube Mobile gets a kick start], Official YouTube Blog&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Security:''' Jobs wrote &quot;Symantec recently highlighted Flash for having one of the worst security records in 2009&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/ |title=Thoughts on Flash |publisher=Apple |author=Steve Jobs|authorlink=Steve Jobs |date=2010-04-29|accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adobe responded by pointing out that &quot;the Symantec Global Internet Threat Report for 2009 found that Flash Player had the second lowest number of vulnerabilities of all Internet technologies listed (which included both web plug-ins and browsers).&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adobe.com/choice/flash.html future of Flash]. Adobe (2009-07-14). Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eval.symantec.com/mktginfo/enterprise/white_papers/b-whitepaper_internet_security_threat_report_xv_04-2010.en-us.pdf Symantec Global Internet Threat Report for 2009], page 40, &quot;In 2009, Symantec documented 321 vulnerabilities affecting plug-ins for Web browsers (figure 9). ActiveX technologies were affected by 134 vulnerabilities, which was the highest among the plug-in technologies examined. Of the remaining technologies, Java SE had 84 vulnerabilities, Adobe Reader had 49 vulnerabilities, QuickTime had 27 vulnerabilities, and Adobe Flash Player was subject to 23 vulnerabilities. The remaining four vulnerabilities affected extensions for Firefox.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Performance:''' Jobs wrote &quot;Flash has not performed well on mobile devices&quot;. Adobe optimized current versions of Flash Player and Flash Lite to use hardware acceleration for video and graphics playback on many devices, including desktop computers. Performance is similar to HTML5 video playback.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.osnews.com/story/22997/Comparing_Flash_HTML5_Performance Comparing Flash, HTML5 Performance], OS News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flashmobileblog.com/2010/02/24/battery-performance-with-flash-player-10-1-on-nexus-one/ Battery Performance with Flash Player 10.1 on Nexus One], Flash Mobile Blog&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Flash Player has been used on multiple mobile devices as a primary user interface renderer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.qnx.com/products/reference-design/ Reference Designs and Demos], QNX&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been speculation that Steve Jobs rejected Flash for business reasons, rather than the technical reasons he mentions in his letter.

{{cquote|Allowing Flashâwhich is a development platform of its ownâwould just be too dangerous for Apple, a company that enjoys exerting total dominance over its hardware and the software that runs on it. Flash has evolved from being a mere animation player into a multimedia platform capable of running applications of its own. That means Flash would open a new door for application developers to get their software onto the iPhone: Just code them in Flash and put them on a web page. In so doing, Flash would divert business from the App Store, as well as enable publishers to distribute music, videos and movies that could compete with the iTunes Store.|||&quot;Why Apple Wonât Allow Adobe Flash on iPhone,&quot; ''Wired Magazine,'' (2008)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wired.com/gadgetlab/2008/11/adobe-flash-on/ Why Apple Wonât Allow Adobe Flash on iPhone | Gadget Lab]. Wired.com. Retrieved on 2011-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|This is not about technology. The criticisms from Apple about Flash can also be applied to many other systems that Apple has not directly opposed. Therefore Apple's stance appears driven by their business need to protect the iPhone platform against the threat of a cross-platform competitor.|||Ray Valdes, V.P. of Gartner Research - &quot;Why Adobe Flash on mobile isn't dead&quot; (2010)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silicon.com/technology/mobile/2010/05/05/why-adobe-flash-on-mobile-isnt-dead-despite-what-apples-steve-jobs-says-39745775/ Why Adobe Flash on mobile isn't dead - despite what Apple's Steve Jobs says], Silicon.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

{{cquote|&quot;[Apple is] very, very keen to keep control of the end-to-end experience and therefore having a separate runtime in the form of Adobe is a problem, One could argue it could be detrimental to Apple's business model because there's a lot of Adobe games - or games that are delivered in Flash - which are free and therefore that would detract from people downloading [paid gaming content] from the App Store.&quot;|||Ben Wood, Director at CCS Insight&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.silicon.com/technology/mobile/2010/05/05/why-adobe-flash-on-mobile-isnt-dead-despite-what-apples-steve-jobs-says-39745775/2/ Why Adobe Flash on mobile isn't dead], page 2, Silicon.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}
