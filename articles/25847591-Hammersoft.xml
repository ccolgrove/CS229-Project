The '''[[2010 NFL season|2010]] [[Dallas Cowboys]] season''' is the 51st season for the team in the [[National Football League]], and the second season playing their home games at [[Cowboys Stadium]]. After falling to the [[Minnesota Vikings]] in the divisional round of the [[2009-10 NFL Playoffs]], the Cowboys sought to defend their [[NFC East]] division title and contend for a Super Bowl Championship, particularly given that [[Super Bowl XLV]] would be played at Cowboys Stadium.  

After beginning the season 1â7, the Cowboys announced that [[Wade Phillips]] was fired as head coach and would be replaced by offensive coordinator [[Jason Garrett]] as the interim head coach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/thehuddle/post/2010/11/nfl-network-cowboys-fire-wade-phillips-as-head-coach-promote-jason-garrett/1|title=NFL Network: Cowboys fire Wade Phillips as head coach, promote Jason Garrett|accessdate=2010-11-08 | work=USA Today|first=Sean|last=Leahy|date=November 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Cowboys finished the season 6â10, 3rd place in the NFC East and for the 43rd time, the team whose region was hosting the Super Bowl would not be playing in it.

The Cowboys increased their lead with Kitna finding Austin again on a 4-yard TD pass, followed by Kitna's 29-yard scramble to the endzone for a touchdown, which was his longest run of his career.

Cowboys interim coach Jason Garrett won his home debut and improved to 2â0 since taking over for Wade Phillips. It's the first time this season Dallas (3â7) has won consecutive games and the first time all season it won at home, having lost the first four.
The Lions (2â8) lost their 26th straight on the road, extending a woeful NFL record that began in 2007, when Kitna was their quarterback.
Detroit led 12â7 and was consistently stuffing the Cowboys' offense midway through the third quarter when John Wedling jumped over the goal line and tapped a punt back into the field of play.
It hopped up waist-high and right to McCann, and the speedster turned it into the second-longest punt return in franchise history â a week after a 101-yard interception return that was the longest in club history. With the win the Cowboys improved to 3â7 on the season.

Coming off their win over the Colts, the Cowboys went home for a Week 14 NFC East duel with the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] on Sunday night.  Dallas trailed early in the first quarter as Eagles quarterback [[Michael Vick]] got a 1-yard touchdown run.  The Cowboys answered with quarterback [[Jon Kitna]] finding tight end [[Jason Witten]] on a 1-yard touchdown pass.  The Eagles regained the lead in the second quarter with Vick completing a 1-yard touchdown pass to offensive guard [[Todd Herremans]].  Afterwards, Dallas closed out the half with a 50-yard field goal from kicker [[David Buehler]].

The Cowboys took the lead in the third quarter with Buehler's 43-yard field goal, followed by a 3-yard touchdown run from running back [[Felix Jones]].  Philadelphia struck back with kicker [[David Akers]] getting a 39-yard field goal.  The Eagles took the lead again in the fourth quarter with Akers booting a 50-yard field goal, followed by Vick completing a 91-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[DeSean Jackson]] and Akers making a 28-yard field goal.  Dallas tried to rally as Kitna hooked up with Witten again on a 22-yard touchdown pass, yet the Eagles held on for the win.

With the loss, the Cowboys fell to 4â9, and were officially eliminated from postseason contention, assuring them not playing the Super Bowl on their own home turf (something that still has yet to happen in Super Bowl history).
