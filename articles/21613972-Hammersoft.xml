The '''Florida Gators women's tennis''' team represents the [[University of Florida]] in the sport of [[tennis]].  The Lady Gators compete in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletics Association]] (NCAA) and the [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC).  They play their home matches in [[Linder Stadium at Ring Tennis Complex|Linder Stadium]] on the university's [[Gainesville, Florida]] campus, and are currently led by head coach [[Roland Thornqvist]].  In the thirty-nine-year history of the Gators women's tennis program, the team has won twenty-five SEC championships and five NCAA national tournament championships.

== History ==

The origins of the Florida Gators women's tennis team date to 1960, when Florida undergraduate [[Alice Tym]] organized and led a successful intercollegiate women's tennis club team.&lt;ref name=itahofprofile&gt;Intercollegiate Tennis Association, Women's Hall of Fame, [http://web.wm.edu/tenniscenter/2008inductees/tym/tym.html  Alice Luthy Tym].  Retrieved June 7, 2011.  Tym was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a &quot;Gator Great.&quot;  ''See'' F Club, Hall of Fame, [http://www.gatorfclub.org/hof/?p=greats  Gator Greats].  Retrieved June 7, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  As [[Title IX]] expanded opportunities for women in college sports, the University of Florida sponsored its first intercollegiate varsity women's tennis team in 1972&amp;ndash;1973.  In the early years of the program, the Lady Gators were a perennial top-ten team in the national championship tournaments sponsored by the [[Association for Intercollegiate Athletics for Women]] (AIAW), including a second-place finish in the 1980 AIAW tournament.

Since the NCAA began sponsoring national championships in women's sports in 1981&amp;ndash;1982, the Lady Gators have won five NCAA team championships, four NCAA singles championships, and four NCAA doubles championships.  In addition to their five NCAA team championships, the Lady Gators have also finished second in the NCAA national championships tournament seven times, including 1988, 1990, 1995, 1997, 1999, 2002 and 2010.  As a team, the Gators have failed to qualify for the AIAW and NCAA national championship tournaments only three times (1973, 1986 and 2009).

The Gators have also dominated the Southeastern Conference, winning twenty-five conference championships and seventeen SEC tournament titles since the SEC sanctioned women's tennis as a conference sport in 1980.

=== Brandi era: 1985&amp;ndash;2001 ===

Led by their fourth-year coach, [[Andy Brandi]], the Florida Gators women's tennis team made its first appearance in the NCAA championship tournament finals in [[Los Angeles, California]] in 1988.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide&gt;''[http://web.gatorzone.com/tennis/women/media/2009/full.html  2009&amp;ndash;10 Florida Gators Women's Tennis Media Guide]'', University Athletic Association, Gainesville, Florida, pp. 40&amp;ndash;44 (2009).

In 1996, Brandi's top-ranked and undefeated Gators earned their second NCAA team championship in [[Tallahassee, Florida]].&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=dooley6192009&gt;Pat Dooley, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090619/ARTICLES/906049957&amp;tc=ix  Top 25 Gator teams: #7 1996 Women's tennis],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (June 19, 2009).

The top-seeded Gators reached the championship finals of the NCAA tournament for the third straight year in 1997, before falling to the Stanford Cardinal, five matches to one, in Palo Alto.

Brandi's undefeated Lady Gators claimed their third NCAA team championship in 1998 by crushing the [[Duke Blue Devils]] women's tennis team, five matches to one, in [[South Bend, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;&lt;ref name=dooley6152009&gt;Pat Dooley, &quot;[http://www.gainesville.com/article/20090604/ARTICLES/906049963&amp;tc=ix  Top 25 Gator teams: #10 1998 Women's tennis],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (June 15, 2009).

At the 1999 NCAA tournament held in Gaiensville, the top-seeded Gators women's tennis team returned to the championship finals for the fifth consecutive season, but lost to its national rival, the Stanford Cardinal, five matches to two, for the fourth time since 1988.

During Brandi's seventeen-year tenure, three individual Gators won four NCAA singles championships: Shaun Stafford in 1988; Lisa Raymond in 1992 and 1993; and Jill Craybas in 1996.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;  In NCAA doubles championship play, three Gators doubles teams have won four NCAA doubles championships: Jillian Alexander and Nicole Arendt in 1991; Dawn Buth and Stephanie Nickitas in 1996 and 1997; and Whitney Laiho and Jessica Lehnhoff in 2001.&lt;ref name=ufmediaguide/&gt;

After failing to qualify for the NCAA tournament in 2009, and after a six-season absence from the NCAA tournament finals, the Gators returned to the championship match in [[Athens, Georgia]] 2010, once again facing their old nemesis, the Stanford Cardinal women.  In a closely contested championship final, the Cardinal edged the Lady Gators, four matches to three.  It was the Gators' seventh second-place performance in the NCAA championships (six of those championship losses at the hands of Stanford).

Thornqvist's Lady Gators claimed the program's fifth NCAA team championship in 2011 by defeating the No. 1 ranked Stanford Cardinal women's tennis team on Stanford's home courts in Palo Alto.&lt;ref name=barlis5252011&gt;Jeff Barlis, &quot;[http://www.gatorsports.com/article/20110525/ARTICLES/110529704  High drama in Palo Alto: UF stuns Stanford],&quot; ''The Gainesville Sun'' (May 25, 2011).
