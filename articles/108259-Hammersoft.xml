'''Modesto''' is a city in, and is the [[county seat]] of, [[Stanislaus County]], [[California]]. With a population of approximately 201,165 at the 2010 census, Modesto ranks as the [[List of cities in California (by population)|18th largest city in the state of California]].

Modesto is located in [[Northern California]], 90 miles north of [[Fresno, California|Fresno]], 92&amp;nbsp;miles east of [[San Francisco]], 68&amp;nbsp;miles south of the state capital of [[Sacramento]], and 66&amp;nbsp;miles west of [[Yosemite National Park]]. Modesto, a 29-time [[Tree City USA]] honoree,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ci.modesto.ca.us/newsroom/releases/city/prdetail.asp?id=100 City of Modesto]&lt;/ref&gt; is surrounded by rich farmland, lending to a ranking for the county as 6th among all California counties in farm production.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cfbf.com/counties/?id=50 California Farm Bureau Federation]&lt;/ref&gt; Led by milk, almonds, chickens, cattle, and walnuts, the county grossed nearly $2.5&amp;nbsp;billion in agricultural production in 2007.

Locally, Modesto is home to the critically acclaimed [[Gallo Center for the Arts]], Prospect Theater Project, The [[Modesto Symphony Orchestra]], The State Theater, the [[Modesto Nuts]] (a Colorado Rockies MLB affiliate) and the [[Amgen Tour of California]]. The [[Xclamation Festival]] (X-Fest), has become the cityâs largest entertainment and cultural gathering, recently celebrating its 10th year. The event in 2009 had an estimated 16,000 attendees enjoy music and food on the streets of downtown Modesto. Modesto also encompasses various cultural and social diverse schools. Among the oldest are Modesto Junior Collage (MJC), Thomas Downey High School, Grace M. Davis High School, and Modesto High School (MHS), being the oldest high school in Modesto. Embodies a rigorous academic and physical curriculum for students such as the International Baccalaureate program, AVID, and more.

Modesto was immortalized in the 1973 [[George Lucas]] film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. The award winning film captured the spirit of &quot;cruising&quot; and friendship, on 10th and 11th Streets in 1962 and lead to the world-wide revival of 1950's nostalgia leading to the TV show ''[[Happy Days]]'' and the other spin-offs. [[Ron Howard]], [[Harrison Ford]] and [[Richard Dreyfuss]] starred in the film. The soundtrack was a huge success. Director George Lucas is a native of Modesto, graduating from Downey High School in 1962.

In February 2010, the Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index, which interviewed more than 353,000 participants and asked individuals to assess their jobs, finances, physical health, emotional state of mind and communities, ranked Modesto 161 out of the 162 cities surveyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2010-02-15-cities_N.htm | work=USA Today | title=Western cities fare best in well-being index | first=Susan | last=Page | date=2010-02-15 | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2009, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Modesto 48th out of 100 among  &quot;Best Bang-for-the-Buck Cities&quot;; according to Forbes. In this ranking, Modesto ranked 8th in housing affordability and travel time but also ranked 86th in job forecast growth and 99th in foreclosures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2009/11/30/cities-affordable-cheap-lifestyle-real-estate-housing-foreclosures_chart.html | work=Forbes | first=Francesca | last=Levy | title=America's Best Bang-For-The-Buck Cities | date=2009-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In variety of other past rankings, Modesto has scored in the top ten worst places to live due to its high cost of living, high unemployment, long commutes and high crime rate.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==History==
[[File:EarlyModesto.PNG|thumb|Modesto's 10th street in 1890.]]
Modesto, originally a stop on the railroad connecting [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]], was founded in 1870 and was to be named for [[William C. Ralston]], [[financier]] of many projects in early California. However, he declined the suggestion and a [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking railroad worker at the naming ceremony said that Ralston was ''&quot;Muy modesto&quot;'' (very modest). Thus, the town was named Modesto.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} It is unknown at this time if this story is mere folklore or actual fact.

The city was incorporated in 1884, at which time it had over 1000 people. With fields of grain and the proximity of the river (grain barges during the flood season) and railroad traffic, the town grew. Later, dams were installed in the foothills, irrigation water came, and irrigated fields of vegetables and fruit or nut trees prospered. By 1900, its population was over 4,500. During [[World War II]], the area provided canned goods, powdered milk, and eggs for the US [[Armed forces of the United States|armed forces]] and allied forces. For the next few decades, Modesto's population grew at about two percent per year to over 100,000 in 1980, and over 200,000 in 2001.

Modesto's official slogan is ''&quot;Water Wealth Contentment Health,&quot;'' which is emblazoned on a large downtown arch featured in local photographs and postcards. A contest was run in 1911 to determine the slogan. The original winning slogan was: &quot;Nobody's got Modesto's goat&quot;. The second place entry was the final winner.

==Tourism==
Modesto is known for the following tourist attractions and historical sites.
[[Image:McHenryMuseum.jpg|thumb|220px|right|The McHenry Mansion.]]
* '''[[McHenry Mansion]]''' Built by hand in the early 1880s by Robert McHenry, a local rancher and banker. The mansion is included on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Tours are given.
* '''McHenry Museum''' Across the street from the McHenry Mansion. Filled with tidbits from Modesto's history.
* '''George Lucas Plaza''' ''[[American Graffiti]]''-inspired bronze statue made in the honor of Modesto filmmaker [[George Lucas]], located at Five Points (the intersections of McHenry Avenue, &quot;J&quot; Street, 17th Street, Downey and Needham).
* '''[[Gallo Center for the Arts]]''', Center for performing arts recently opened and is located in downtown Modesto at 1000 &quot;I&quot; Street.
* '''[[Downtown Modesto]]''' is known for having a variety of restaurants and night life. It also hosts a multi-venue Art Walk year around on the Third Thursday of the Month, free to view with maps available.
* '''[http://www.thestate.org The State Theatre]''' Dating back to the 1920s, it was recently renovated and serves as a local performance arts center and as a theater specializing in independent and foreign films.
* '''[[John Thurman Field]]''' The stadium renovated several years ago, the home of the [[Modesto Nuts]] baseball team (single &quot;A&quot; affiliate of the Colorado Rockies MLB team).
* '''Graceada Park Neighborhood''' an area of representative old homes (circa 1920s and earlier) with streets lined with large city planted shade trees and a series of parks, a bandshell and other amenities. The name Graceada is based on two old local ladies that helped promote the idea of a park, Grace and Ada.
The 1973 movie, ''American Graffiti'', starring Ron Howard, Richard Dreyfuss and Cindy Williams was set in 1962 Modesto; however, the scenes of weekend cruising were actually filmed in Petaluma, California.

==Transportation==
Modesto is served by one of the busiest rail corridors in the country. The [[Amtrak]] ''[[San Joaquin (Amtrak)|San Joaquins]]'' make ten daily stops on the route between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Bakersfield]], and two stops daily on the route between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and Bakersfield.

===Air===

Modesto is served by the [[Modesto City-County Airport]] that lies east of [[California State Route 99]] within the city limits. [[SkyWest Airlines]] (operating as [[United Express]]) provides air service to [[San Francisco International Airport]]. The airport is used for manufacturing and the shipping industries throughout California and the [[United States]].

===Highways and roads===

[[Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99]] provide major highway access to Modesto.
[[California State Route 132]] links the city to [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]], providing commuter access to highways into the [[Bay Area]]. [[California State Route 108]] connects to [[Oakdale, California]] and east to the foothills. The city has added many roundabouts in an effort to ease traffic congestion within the town with varying degrees of success.

===Public transit===
Three public transit systems serve Modesto: [[Modesto Area Express (MAX)|Modesto Area Express]], [[Stanislaus Regional Transit|START]], and the [[San Joaquin Regional Transit District]] along the northern edge of the city on McHenry Avenue. MAX is the local system with additional connections to the [[Altamont Commuter Express]] train station in Lathrop and the [[Dublin/Pleasanton (BART station)|Dublin/Pleasanton]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station. MAX also provides a [[paratransit]] &quot;dial-a-ride&quot; service which specifically caters to seniors and the disabled. It is open to the general public only during certain times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Modesto Area Express|url=http://www.modestoareaexpress.com/dar_information.htm |title=Dial-A-Ride Information}}&lt;/ref&gt; StaRT connects Modesto to the county's other populated centers.Modesto will also serve the future [[California High Speed Rail]].

The large industrial region south and east of the city is served by the [[Modesto and Empire Traction Railroad]], a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} [[short-line railroad|short line]] with a web of industry tracks and many customers.

At one time, Modesto was the operational center of the [[Tidewater Southern Railway]], which had its main line down the center of Ninth Street, a major north-south street. A city [[local ordinance|ordinance]] passed by the city council kept [[electric power]] lines over this section of street activated long after the railroad had converted to steam power. In 2000, the last trains ran down Ninth Street. Now the railroad (owned by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] since 1983) no longer passes through Modesto.

==Climate==
Modesto usually has cool winters and very hot, dry summers. Average January temperatures range from 54.0Â°F (12.2Â°C) in the day to 37.0Â°F (2.8Â°C) at night. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and averages 12.4&amp;nbsp;inches (31.5&amp;nbsp;cm) annually. Since the city does not have full storm sewer systems, many of the streets flood during the winter rain storms.

Average July temperatures range from 97Â°F (34.4Â°C) in the day to 64Â°F (14.4Â°C) at night. During the summer months there can be multiple days in a row with daily temperatures exceeding highs of 100.0Â°F (37.8Â°C). This can pose health risks for those with weak constitutions, or who ignore the dangers of heat stroke. Offshore breezes (locally known as the &quot;delta breeze&quot;) moderate these high temperatures, with cooler air coming in sometime after 8 or 9 PM on summer nights, although this does not give much relief.

==Water==
Although the city is located on the [[Tuolumne River]] and near the [[Stanislaus River]], it has no operating port for oceangoing ships due to the shallow depths of these rivers, and also due to a small [[dam]] on the Tuolumne River near Highway 99. In Modesto there is also a small creek aptly named Dry Creek, which although badly polluted by agricultural runoff, is adjacent to several parks in Modesto. Most of the rivers and [[stream]]s are otherwise not accessible to public use or view due to fences and private property rights. There are no public boat ramps or docks within the city limits. Although summertime brings high temperatures, swimming is prohibited by local ordinance in rivers, creeks, and the many irrigation canals. Rivers and lakes near [[Waterford, CA|Waterford]] are wide enough to be accessible for a [[kayak]], or small [[motorboat]], and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when [[hydroelectric power]] dams were installed upstream for valuable flood control, [[irrigation]], and [[electric power]] generation. The nearest large open  [[seaport]] is the [[Port of Stockton]], which is used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.

==Future expansion of State Route 132==
{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}
The city has had plans for decades to build an [[Limited-access road|expressway]] that would expand [[California State Route 132|State Route 132]]'s expressway status from [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]] to [[California State Route 99|State Route 99]]. CalTrans purchased the land in the late 60's to build the new Highway 132, but the money was diverted to build the 120 bypass 18&amp;nbsp;miles north of Modesto on the outskirts of the city of [[Manteca, California]]. The planned expressway would parallel Kansas Avenue from the recently built Kansas-Needham Overpass and a planned new Hwy. 99 Interchange. The ramps were put in place decades ago, but never paved and the bridge for the off/on ramp never built. It is planned to later go out of Modesto and to Interstate 580. The city is also planning to add more ramps on the Central Modesto exit in SR 99 for less traffic coming in and out of downtown.

==Economy==
===Industry===

Modesto has a large agricultural industry which is based on the fertile farmland surrounding the city. Despite this the city has traditionally had above average unemployment rates. In July 2010, the Modesto Bee reported Modesto's unemployment rate at 17.3% while the rest of the U.S. was reporting an unemployment rate of 9.5%. [[Blue Diamond Growers]], a nearby almond factory in [[Salida, California|Salida]], is a major [[Nut (fruit)|nut]] supplier. Modesto is also home to the largest winery in the world: [[E &amp; J Gallo Winery]]. Founded in 1933 by brothers Ernest and Julio Gallo, the company continually revolutionizes the wine industry in America. The Gallo Glass Company, a company of Gallo Winery, is the largest wine bottle manufacturing company in the world. The company provides thousands of office and manufacturing jobs to Stanislaus County residents. Other major privately owned companies based in Modesto include [[Foster Farms Dairy]], [[Royal Robbins]], international award winner Fiscalini Cheese, Sciabica Olive Oil, Acme Construction, Aderholt Specialty, and 511 Tactical (formerly a part of Royal Robbins). A cannery downtown produces food which is usually shipped to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] for transfer to rail or ship. [[Ceres, California|Ceres]] has a few cereal and snack factories in the area. Downtown there are several small [[steel]]working companies. In mid-2008, a number of road projects were being constructed, repaved or repaired, with an estimated total cost of nearly $120,000,000.

===Crime===
Rates of both violent crimes and property crimes are higher in Modesto than the state average.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ca/modesto/crime&lt;/ref&gt; Of particular note is that Modesto ranks among the top car theft cities in the US. As of 2008 Modesto ranked number 1 for car theft rate per 100,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iii.org/media/hottopics/insurance/test4&lt;/ref&gt; Modesto is also home to many street gangs. The Stanislaus County Gang Intelligence Task Force estimates there to be 7,000 to 10,000 gang members.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.modbee.com/2007/09/20/72474/gangs-thriving-in-modesto.html Gangs thriving in Modesto], Modesto Bee, Sep. 20, 2007.
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning and environmental==
In the late 1980s Modesto embarked on an update to the city's [[General Plan]] pursuant to requirements of the State of California. The result was a comprehensive evaluation of alternative population and land use projections along with associated environmental impact analysis. Some of the environmental factors technically assessed were air quality, [[water quality]], [[environmental noise]], [[soil contamination]] and [[visual]] impacts.

Much of the soils in Modesto are classified as part of the Hanford series: (HbpA) fine sandy loam, moderately deep over silt. These soils are well-drained, moderately coarse textured soils derived from alluvium from granitic rock. The Hanford soils are important for the production of a wide variety of irrigated orchard, field, and truck crops.

Vicinity watercourses include the [[Stanislaus River]], the [[Tuolumne River]] and [[Dry Creek, Stanislaus County|Dry Creek]] empties into the Tuolumne River. Area groundwater, which is the principal source of water supply in the city (Stanislaus, 1987), has been historically impaired in a fashion that is spatially variable. Water from the nearby Modesto Resovoir is now used to augment city water. In various parts of the city and its perimeter the following [[water pollutant]]s have occurred from time to time: [[nitrate]]s, [[dibromochloromethane]], [[Volatile Organic Compounds|volatile organics]], salinity, [[total dissolved solids]] and other [[pesticide]]s. (Torrey, 1989) Each of these contaminants is not present citywide.

The E.P.A. rates air quality in Modesto, CA as a 23 on a scale to 100 (higher is better), making Modesto an unhealthy place to live for those with breathing difficulties. This is based on ozone alert days and number of pollutants in the air. In May 2010, Forbes Magazine, in association with the American Lung Association, indicated that Modesto was one of the top 25 most polluted cities in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/04/28/polluted-cities-smog-lifestyle-health-american-lung-association-ozone_slide_2.html?partner=msnhealth | work=Forbes | title=List: Worst Cities For Ozone Pollution}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Downtown revitalization==
As of the 2000s, Downtown Modesto has been thoroughly modernized, including new attractions such as Gallo Center for the Arts and the new Downtown Plaza adjacent to Modesto Centre Plaza. Downtown Modesto has lost some of its old-time flavor with the loss of the Hotel Covell, The incredible [[art deco]] Strand Theatre, and the Sears building but it has improved traffic flow considerably. The projects under feasibility planning stages are:

*7-story condo/commercial tower at 10th and H Streets

*8-story condo tower at 14th and J Streets

==Entertainment and culture==
The [[Modesto Nuts]] Minor League Baseball Club of the class A [[California League]] is the main attraction for locals between Easter and Labor Day. The Nuts are the Single A affiliate of the [[Colorado Rockies]] and play 70 home games each season.

In the past 10&amp;nbsp;years, Modesto has hosted many music festivals such as SummerFest, the Downtown Summer Concert Series featuring [[Chris Isaak]], [[Hootie &amp; the Blowfish]], [[The Doobie Brothers]] and [[Styx]], and the most notorious of all, X-Fest.

X-Fest, deriving from its real name [[Xclamation Festival]], is a 21 and over music festival in downtown Modesto. Starting in 2000, X-Fest has evolved into a large outdoor event stretching 15 blocks and featuring the Worlds Largest Disco which covers four blocks on its own. In 2008 X-Fest featured 50 bands and a crowd of 15,000 people. Much of the profits end up in local non-profit charities. Some business owners and citizens of Modesto complain of rowdy and often drunk [[Mardi Gras]] atmosphere exhibited at X-fest. Events like these may have helped propel Modesto to be ranked, in Feb. of 2010 by Men's Health Magazine, as the 12th drunkest city in America. Men's Health Magazine compiled its rating based on alcohol related deaths, DUI and other arrests.

Summers in Modesto are also marked by the revival of ''[[American Graffiti]]'', the 1973 film and cult classic written and directed by Modesto native [[George Lucas]]. Lucas' film paid homage to teenage life in 1962 based on his own experiences growing up in the city of Modesto. The city council refused to let Lucas film ''Graffiti'' in Modesto so he was forced to make the film elsewhere. The City of Modesto has since realized the importance of our connection to the award winning film and the city is preparing new tourist attractions and events to welcome ''American Graffiti'' tourists.  The Modesto Convention and Visitors bureau report that the leading request for information is ''American Graffiti'' related. The annual festival, Graffiti Summer, celebrates this event and lasts the entire month of June attracting thousands of visitors and car enthusiasts along with hundreds of classic and [[antique cars]].

Located in downtown Modesto is the locally iconic State Theater, one of the many hot sports for music acts and independent films.

===Unincorporated Islands===
While the population of the city is officially 211,156 (as of April 2009), there are large unincorporated districts, locally known as unincorporated &quot;islands&quot; or &quot;pockets&quot;, which are technically not part of the city but have Modesto mailing addresses. Statistics for these sections (population, income, education, crime, etc.) are included into [[Stanislaus County]] totals instead of Modesto. These areas, which include most of the Airport neighborhood in east Modesto, roughly a third of west Modesto, and most of south Modesto, are largely devoid of sidewalks, sewer service, parks, and until recently, street lights.

These neighborhoods were originally built in the 1930's and 40's to house [[Okies|Dust Bowl migrants]] on lands that were then beyond the edges of town. Due to the hopes of local officials that the housing would only be temporary, little oversight in the way of permits was the norm, and even today some homes have no foundation and many have septic tanks. These areas have since become permanent and today are populated largely by Latinos. Descendants of the original Dust Bowl migrants remain a small but sizable minority in these neighborhoods.

Incorporating these areas into the city of Modesto is thought not to be a priority of local government by many residents of these &quot;islands&quot; and has led to resentment by some. Making these places part of the city would require that services (city sewer) and infrastructure (sidewalks) be in place first, as well as approval by city residents in local elections. Efforts to incorporate some of these neighborhoods into the city have proved fruitless thus far.

==Government==
===Local government===
