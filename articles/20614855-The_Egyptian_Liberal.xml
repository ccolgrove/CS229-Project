==Organizational structure==
The General Assembly of fee-paying members holds supreme authority in EOHR. A General Assembly meeting is convened once every other year to review and evaluate the organizationâs progress and to elect the Board of Trustees. The Board of Trustees is the policy-making body within the EOHR and is led by the Chairman. It is made up of fifteen elected members, and up to four other prominent figures in the field of human rights can be invited by the Board of Trustees to join.

The Executive Board is elected by the Board of Trustees and consists of the Secretary-General, the Treasurer and representatives of the main committees of the organization. The Executive Board, led by the Secretary-General, is responsible for the day-to-day activities of the EOHR and for any decisions made in the interim period between meetings of the Board of Trustees.

EOHR has five substantive and inter-linked departments: the Field Work Unit, the Womenâs Legal Aid Project (WLAP), the Research and Publications Desk, the International and Translation Unit and the Refugeesâ Legal Aid Project.

;The Field Work Unit
This unit consists of a team of lawyers trained in investigative work. They receive individual allegations of human rights violations and investigate each caseâs merits. Much of their work takes place in the field, on the ground, in prisons, in court, in detention centers, in homes, anywhere information can be found. The investigating lawyer writes an official report on each case. Then, depending on the nature and the merits of the case, the case may be removed from consideration or investigated further. Appeals and requests for information may be made to competent authorities and complainants may receive free legal counsel so that they can pursue a formal suit. All services made available to victims of human rights violations are absolutely free of charge.

;The Womenâs Legal Aid Project (WLAP)
This unit manages human rights problems dealing with womenâs issues. Such problems include marital and family issues and sexual discrimination. WLAP undertakes most of the work supporting campaigns that focus on womenâs issues and coordinates an educational and training program aimed at increasing womenâs legal literacy in Egyptâs poorer areas.

;The Research and Publications Unit
This unit conducts academic research on human rights issues, analyzes the raw material of human rights abuses supplied by the Field Work Unit and the WLAP. This desk is responsible for producing EOHRâs reports and is our routine link to the Arab media.

;The International and Translation Unit
This unit coordinates EOHRâs partnerships with other human rights organizations throughout the non-Arab world. This desk also coordinates our endless battle to equip us with the financial resources necessary to meet our objectives.
Moreover, it is responsible for translating all EOHRâs literature into English so that it can be shared with the English-speaking world.

;Refuge Legal Aid Project
This project was established in 2001 as a joint project between EOHR and the [[American University in Cairo]]. This unit provides legal aid to those who seek refugee status in Egypt and it works within the framework of the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR).
