The '''1962  New South Wales  state election'''  was held on 3 March 1962. It  was conducted in single member constituencies with compulsory [[Instant-runoff voting|preferential voting]] and  was held on boundaries created at a 1961 redistribution. The election was for all of the 94 seats in the  [[New South Wales Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]].
==Redistribution==
A redistribution of electoral boundaries was undertaken in 1961 based on that year's [[Census in Australia|Australian Census]]. The redistribution reflected the continuing relative population shifts from the Country and Eastern suburbs of Sydney to Western Sydney and the Central Coast. The Hunter Valley seat of [[Electoral district of Liverpool Plains|Liverpool Plains]], held by the [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] was abolished while in the eastern suburbs the safe [[Liberal party of Australia|Liberal]] seat of [[Electoral district of Woollahra|Woollahra]] and the safe [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] seat of [[Electoral district of Paddington-Waverley|Paddington-Waverley]] were combined to form the marginal seat of [[Electoral district of Bligh|Bligh]]. In  Northern Sydney, the marginal Labor seat of [[Electoral district of North Sydney|North Sydney]] and the safe Liberal seat of [[Electoral district of Neutral Bay|Neutral Bay]] were combined to form the relatively safe Liberal seat of [[Electoral district of Kirribilli|Kirribilli]]. [[Electoral district of Wakehurst|Wakehurst]] was created in the Northern Beaches area with a notional Liberal majority and on the Central Coast, the seat of [[Electoral district of Wyong|Wyong]] was established and was expected to have a large Labor majority. In Western Sydney  the seats of [[Electoral district of Merrylands|Merrylands]] and [[Electoral district of Leichhardt (New South Wales)|Leichhardt]] were abolished and replaced by the safe Labor seats of [[Electoral district of Wentworthville|Wentworthville]] and [[Electoral district of Bass Hill|Bass Hill]]. The seat of [[Electoral district of The Hills|The Hills]] was established in North-west Sydney  mainly from the northern portion of [[Electoral district of Blacktown|Blacktown]] and this made Blacktown a safe Labor seat. While the theoretical effect of the redistribution was to increase the Liberal numbers by 1 at the expense of the Country Party, the boundary changes significantly improved Labor's position in several seats including Nepean, Coogee and Drummoyne.

==Issues==
In March 1962, Labor had been in power for 21 years and [[Robert Heffron]]  had been premier for 2 and a half years.  Heffron was 72 at the time of the election and his age and the longevity of the government were made issues by the opposition which described it as being composed of &quot;tired old men&quot;. The prestige of Heffron's government had suffered when the electors clearly rejected its proposal to abolish the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] at a referendum in April 1961. Labor's  new policies for the election included the establishment of an Department of Industrial Development to reduce unemployment, free school travel, aid to home buyers and commencing the construction of the [[SydneyâNewcastle Freeway]] as a toll-road.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Labor Election Policy|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 13 February 1962 p1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to Labor the leader of the conservative coalition, [[Robin Askin]] put forward a positive program and addressed contentious issues including the introduction of State Aid for private schools, making rent control fairer and the legalisation of off-course betting on horse races. Askin accused the state government of allowing the transport infrastructure of the state to decline. He promised to build the Newcastle freeway without a toll, to construct the [[Eastern Suburbs railway line|Eastern Suburbs Railway]] and to plan for a second crossing of Sydney Harbour. Askin also promised more resources for mental health and district hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Pledge to Suspend Toll Road Proposals|author=  |newspaper= The Sydney Morning Herald|date= 15 February 1962 p1 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Labor government's position improved substantially at this election. It had a buffer of 7 seats in the new parliament:
* [[Australian Labor Party]] 54 seats
* [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] 25 seats
* [[National Party of Australia|Country Party]] 14 seats
* Independent Liberal 1 seat

Prior to the election Labor had gained the seat of [[Electoral district of Lismore|Lismore]] from the Country Party at a by-election after the Court of Disputed Returns ruling the 1959 election result invalid. Labor had lost the seat of [[Electoral district of Liverpool Plains|Liverpool Plains]] to the Country Party at a by-election caused by the resignation of [[Roger Nott]]. However, Liverpool Plains was abolished by the redistribution at this election. In [[Electoral district of Oxley (New South Wales)|Oxley]] the sitting member, [[Les Jordan]] changed his allegiance from the Country Party to the Liberal Party,

Labor regained the seat of [[Electoral district of Waratah (New South Wales)|Waratah]] from the independent incumbent [[Frank Purdue]] and, as expected,  won the new seats of [[Electoral district of Wyong|Wyong]], [[Electoral district of Wentworthville|Wentworthville]], [[Electoral district of Bass Hill|Bass Hill]] and [[Electoral district of Bligh|Bligh]]. Labor also gained [[Electoral district of Blacktown|Blacktown]], [[Electoral district of Nepean (New South Wales)|Nepean]] [[Electoral district of Drummoyne|Drummoyne]] and [[Electoral district of Coogee|Coogee]] from the Liberals.

The Liberal Party won the new seats of [[Electoral district of Kirribilli|Kirribilli]], [[Electoral district of Wakehurst|Wakehurst]] and [[Electoral district of The Hills|The Hills]]. In Manly, the sitting Liberal member [[Douglas Darby]], who had lost his party's pre-selection,  successfully contested the seat as an Independent Liberal. 

The DLP and the Communist party both performed poorly, each party gained less than 2% of the primary vote.
