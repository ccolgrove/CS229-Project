'''Emo''' ({{IPAc-en|icon|Ë|iË|m|oÊ}}) is a style of [[rock music]] characterized by melodic musicianship and expressive, often confessional lyrics. It originated in the mid-1980s [[hardcore punk]] movement of [[Washington, D.C.]], where it was known as &quot;emotional hardcore&quot; or &quot;emocore&quot; and pioneered by bands such as [[Rites of Spring]] and [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]]. As the style was echoed by contemporary American [[punk rock]] bands, its sound and meaning shifted and changed, blending with [[pop punk]] and [[indie rock]] and encapsulated in the early 1990s by groups such as [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]] and [[Sunny Day Real Estate]]. By the mid 1990s numerous emo acts emerged from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Central United States]], and several independent record labels began to specialize in the style.

Emo broke into mainstream culture in the early 2000s with the [[Oro album|platinum]]-selling success of [[Jimmy Eat World]] and [[Dashboard Confessional]] and the emergence of the subgenre &quot;[[screamo]]&quot;. In recent years the term &quot;emo&quot; has been applied by critics and journalists to a variety of artists, including multiplatinum acts and groups with disparate styles and sounds.

In addition to music, &quot;emo&quot; is often used more generally to signify a particular relationship between fans and artists, and to describe related aspects of fashion, culture, and behavior.

}}Emo emerged from the [[hardcore punk]] scene of early-1980s [[Washington, D.C.]], both as a reaction to the increased violence within the scene and as an extension of the personal politics espoused by [[Ian MacKaye]] of [[Minor Threat]], who had turned the focus of the music from the community back towards the individual.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 12&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last =Greenwald|first =Andy|authorlink =Andy Greenwald|title =[[Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo]]|publisher =[[St. Martin's Griffin]]|date =2003|location =[[New York City|New York]]|isbn =0-312-30863-9|pages=9â11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Blush, 157&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last = Blush|first = Steven|authorlink = Steven Blush|title = [[American Hardcore: A Tribal History]]|publisher = [[Feral House]]|date = 2001|location = [[New York City|New York]]|isbn = 0-922925-71-7|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor Threat fan [[Guy Picciotto]] formed [[Rites of Spring]] in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the band's themes would become familiar tropes in later generations of emo music, including nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 12â13.&lt;/ref&gt; Their performances became public emotional purges where audience members would sometimes weep.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKaye became a huge Rites of Spring fan, recording their only album and serving as their roadie on tour, and soon formed a new band of his own called [[Embrace (American band)|Embrace]] which explored similar themes of self-searching and emotional release.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 14&quot;&gt;Greenwald,  p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar bands soon followed in connection with the &quot;Revolution Summer&quot; of 1985, a deliberate attempt by members of the Washington, D.C. scene to break from the rigid constraints of hardcore in favor of a renewed spirit of creativity.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blush, 157&quot;/&gt; Bands such as [[Gray Matter (band)|Gray Matter]], [[Beefeater (band)|Beefeater]], [[Fire Party]], [[Dag Nasty]], [[Soulside|Lunchmeat]], and Kingface were connected to this movement.&lt;ref name=&quot;Blush, 157&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 14&quot;/&gt;

The exact origins of the term &quot;emo&quot; are uncertain, but date back to at least 1985. According to [[Andy Greenwald]], author of ''[[Nothing Feels Good: Punk Rock, Teenagers, and Emo]]'', &quot;The origins of the term 'emo' are shrouded in mystery [...] but it first came into common practice in 1985. If Minor Threat was hardcore, then Rites of Spring, with its altered focus, was emotional hardcore or emocore.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 14&quot;/&gt; [[Michael Azerrad]], author of ''[[Our Band Could Be Your Life]]'', also traces the word's origins to this time: 
&quot;The style was soon dubbed 'emo-core,' a term everyone involved bitterly detested, although the term and the approach thrived for at least another fifteen years, spawning countless bands.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;azerrad, 380&quot;&gt;{{cite book|last =Azerrad|first = Michael|authorlink =Michael Azerrad|title =[[Our Band Could Be Your Life|Our Band Could Be Your Life: Scenes from the American Indie Underground 1981&amp;ndash;1991]]|publisher =[[Little, Brown and Company]]|date =2001|location =[[New York City|New York]]|page =380|isbn =0316787531}}&lt;/ref&gt; MacKaye also traces it to 1985, attributing it to an article in ''[[Thrasher (magazine)|Thrasher]]'' magazine referring to Embrace and other Washington, D.C. bands as &quot;emo-core&quot;, which he called &quot;the stupidest fucking thing Iâve ever heard in my entire life.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;khanna&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Khanna| first = Vish|date = February 2007|url = http://exclaim.ca/articles/timeline.aspx?csid1=107|title = Timeline: Ian MacKaye - Out of Step|publisher = Exclaim.ca|accessdate = 2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other accounts attribute the term to an audience member at an Embrace show, who yelled that the band was &quot;emocore&quot; as an insult.&lt;ref name=&quot;DePasquale&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = DePasquale|first = Ron|title = Embrace: Biography|url = {{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p12874|pure_url=yes}}|publisher = [[Allmusic]]|accessdate = 2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Popkin&quot;&gt;{{cite web|last = Popkin|first = Helen|title = What Exactly Is 'Emo,' Anyway?|date = 2006-03-26|url = http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/11720603/|work = [[MSNBC.com]]|publisher = [[MSNBC]]|accessdate = 2009-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others contend that MacKaye coined the term when he used it self-mockingly in a magazine, or that it originated with Rites of Spring.&lt;ref name=&quot;Popkin&quot;/&gt; The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', however, dates the earliest usage of &quot;emo-core&quot; to 1992 and &quot;emo&quot; to 1993, with &quot;emo&quot; first appearing in print media in ''[[New Musical Express]]'' in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = emo-core, n|url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00341634?query_type=word&amp;queryword=emo-core&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10&amp;single=1&amp;sort_type=alpha|work = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher  = [[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate = 2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = emo, n| url = http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/00341633?single=1&amp;query_type=word&amp;queryword=emo&amp;first=1&amp;max_to_show=10
|work = [[Oxford English Dictionary]]|publisher = [[Oxford University Press]]|accessdate = 2009-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;emocore&quot; label quickly spread around the Washington, D.C. punk scene and became attached to many of the bands associated with MacKaye's [[Dischord Records]] label.&lt;ref name=&quot;DePasquale&quot;/&gt; Although many of these bands simultaneously rejected the term, it stuck nonetheless. Scene veteran [[Jenny Toomey]] has recalled that &quot;The only people who used it at first were the ones that were jealous over how big and fanatical a scene it was. [Rites of Spring] existed well before the term did and they hated it. But there was this weird moment, like when people started calling music '[[grunge]],' where you were using the term even though you hated it.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 14â15.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Washington, D.C. emo scene lasted only a few years. By 1986 most of the major bands of the movementâincluding Rites of Spring, Embrace, Gray Matter, and Beefeaterâhad broken up.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 15&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Even so, the ideas and aesthetics originating from the scene spread quickly across the country via a network of homemade [[zine]]s, vinyl records, and hearsay.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 15â17.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Greenwald, the Washington, D.C. scene laid the groundwork for all subsequent incarnations of emo:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
What had happened in D.C. in the mid-eightiesâthe shift from anger to action, from extroverted rage to internal turmoil, from an individualized mass to a mass of individualsâwas in many ways a test case for the transformation of the national punk scene over the next two decades. The imagery, the power of the music, the way people responded to it, and the way the bands burned out instead of fading awayâall have their origins in those first few performances by Rites of Spring. The roots of emo were laid, however unintentionally, by fifty or so people in the nation's capital. And in some ways, it was never as good and surely never as pure again. Certainly, the Washington scene was the only time &quot;emocore&quot; had any consensus definition as a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 15â16.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

MacKaye and Piccioto, along with Rites of Spring drummer [[Brendan Canty]], went on to form the highly influential [[Fugazi]] who, despite sometimes being connected with the term &quot;emo&quot;, are not commonly recognized as an emo band.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 17â18. &quot;Fugazi is one of the best and most influential groups of the last thirty yearsâand yet, despite some opinion to the contrary, they are not an emo band. Fugazi's fan base is too varied, too diffuseâits themes likewise. Fugazi is a living blueprint for a truly committed, punk/DIY artistic life once both the rage and the tears have faded. Making the group, perhaps, an emo doctoral program, but not emo. People have their preconceived ideas crushed by Fugazi, they don't have crushes on its members.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reinvention: early 1990s===
[[Image:SunnyDayRealEstate2009.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Sunny Day Real Estate]] in 2009.]]
As the ideals of the Washington, D.C. emo movement spread across the United States, many bands in numerous local scenes began to emulate the sound as a way to marry the intensity of hardcore with the complex emotions associated with growing older.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 18&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; The style combined the fatalism, theatricality, and outsiderness of [[The Smiths]] with the uncompromising and dramatic worldview of hardcore.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 18&quot;/&gt; Although the bands were numerous and the locales varied, the aesthetics of emocore in the late 1980s remained more or less the same: &quot;over-the-top lyrics about feelings wedded to dramatic but decidedly punk music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 18&quot;/&gt; However, in the early 1990s, several new bands reinvented the emo style and carried its core characteristic, the intimacy between bands and fans, into the new decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 19&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief among these were [[Jawbreaker (band)|Jawbreaker]] and [[Sunny Day Real Estate]], both of whom fostered cult followings, recontextualized the word &quot;emo&quot;, and brought it a step closer to the mainstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 19&quot;/&gt; According to Andy Greenwald:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Sunny Day Real Estate was emo's head and Jawbreaker its busted gutâthe two overlapped in the heart, then broke up before they made it big. Each had a lasting impact on the world of independent music. The bands shared little else but fans, and yet somehow the combination of the two lays down a fairly effective blueprint for everything that was labeled emo for the next decade.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 19&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the wake of the 1991 success of [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s ''[[Nevermind]]'', underground music and subcultures in the United States became big business. New distribution networks emerged, touring routes were codified, and regional and independent acts were able to access the national stage.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 19&quot;/&gt; Teenagers across the country declared themselves fans of independent music, and being punk became mainstream.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 19&quot;/&gt; In this new musical climate, the aesthetics of emo expanded into the mainstream and altered the way the music was perceived: &quot;Punk rock no-nos like the [[cult of personality]] and artistic abstraction suddenly become ''de rigueur''&quot;, says Greenwald. &quot;If one definition of emo has always been music that felt like a secret, Jawbreaker and Sunny Day Real Estate were cast in the rolls of the biggest gossips of all, reigning as the largest influences on every emo band that came after them.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 20&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

They released three more albums through a series of breakups and occasional reunions, but are remembered primarily for the promise of their debut and the shift it engendered in the tastes of underground rock fans.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 32. &quot;&quot;[I]n many ways Sunny Day's brilliance ''was'' its zeitgeist-seizing debut, physically forcing a regime change in the hearts and minds of fans of underground rock.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Underground popularity: mid 1990s===
In the mid-1990s the American [[punk rock|punk]] and [[indie rock]] movements, which had been largely underground since the early 1980s, became part of mainstream culture. After [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s success, major record labels capitalized on the popularity of [[alternative rock]] and other underground music by signing numerous independent bands and spending large amounts of capital promoting them.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 33&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the same year that Jawbreaker's ''24 Hour Revenge Therapy'' and Sunny Day Real Estate's ''Diary'' were released, [[pop punk]] acts [[Green Day]] and [[The Offspring]] had [[Oro album|mutiplatinum]] successes with their respective albums ''[[Dookie]]'' and ''[[Smash (The Offspring album)|Smash]]''. In the wake of the underground going mainstream, over the next several years emo as a genre retreated, reformed, and morphed into a national subculture, then eventually something more.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 33&quot;/&gt; Drawing inspiration from bands like Jawbreaker, [[Drive Like Jehu]], and [[Fugazi]], the new sound of emo was a mixture of [[hardcore punk|hardcore]]'s passion and indie rock's intelligence, bearing the anthemic power of punk rock and its [[Do it yourself|do-it-yourself]] work ethic but with smoother songs, sloppier melodies, and yearning vocals.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 34-35&quot;&gt;Greenwald, pp. 34â35.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the new emo bands originated from the [[Midwestern United States|Midwestern]] and [[Central United States]], such as [[Braid (band)|Braid]] from [[Champaign, Illinois|Champaign]]-[[Urbana, Illinois]], [[Christie Front Drive]] from [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], [[Mineral (band)|Mineral]] from [[Austin, Texas]], [[Jimmy Eat World]] from [[Mesa, Arizona]], [[The Get Up Kids]] from [[Kansas City, Missouri]], and [[The Promise Ring]] from [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Andy Greenwald]], &quot;This was the period when emo earned many, if not all, of the stereotypes that have lasted to this day: boy-driven, glasses-wearing, overly sensitive, overly brainy, chiming-guitar-driven college music.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 34-35&quot; /&gt;

The Promise Ring were one of the premier bands of the new emo style.

}}The emo aesthetic of the mid-1990s was embodied in Mineral, whose albums ''[[The Power of Failing]]'' (1997) and ''[[EndSerenading]]'' (1998) encapsulated the emo tropes of somber music accompanied by a shy narrator singing seriously about mundane problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 41&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Greenwald calls their song &quot;If I Could&quot; &quot;the ultimate expression of mid-nineties emo.

===Independent success: late 1990s and early 2000s===
Beginning in the late 1990s emo had a surge of popularity in the realm of independent music, as a number of notable acts and record labels experienced successes that would lay the foundation for the style's later mainstream breakthrough. As emo gained a larger fanbase the music business began see its marketing potential, and as big business entered the picture many of the acts previously associated with the term intentionally distanced themselves from it:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
As the '90s wore to a close, the music that was being labeled emo was making a connection with a larger and larger group of people. the aspects of it that were the most contagiousâthe sensitivity, hooks, and average-guy appealâwere also the easiest to latch onto, replicate, and mass market. As with any phenomenonâexactly like what happened with Sunny Day [Real Estate]âwhen business enters into a high-stakes, highly personal sphere, things tend to go awry very quickly [...] As fans threatened to storm the emo bandwagon, the groups couldn't jump off of it fast enough. The popularity and bankability of the wordâif not the musicâtransformed an affiliation with the mid-nineties version of emo into an albatross.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 119&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1997 [[Deep Elm Records]] launched a series of [[compilation album]]s entitled ''[[The Emo Diaries]]'', which continued until 2007 with eleven installments.&lt;ref name=&quot;emo diaries&quot;&gt;{{cite web|title = The Emo Diaries|publisher = [[Deep Elm Records]]|url = http://www.deepelm.com/bands/index_emo.html#anchor1|accessdate = 2009-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Featuring mostly unreleased music from unsigned bands, the series included acts such as [[Jimmy Eat World]], [[Further Seems Forever]], [[Samiam]], and [[The Movielife]].&lt;ref name=&quot;emo diaries&quot;/&gt; The diversity of bands and musical styles made the case for emo as more of a shared aesthetic than a genre, and the series helped to codify the term &quot;emo&quot; and spread it throughout the community of underground music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 119&quot;/&gt;

}}Jimmy Eat World's 1999 album ''[[Clarity (Jimmy Eat World album)|Clarity]]'' was one of the most significant emo albums of the late 1990s and became a touchstone for later emo bands.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 101&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 2003, [[Andy Greenwald]] called it &quot;one of the most fiercely beloved rock 'n' roll records of the last decade.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a world where cars are advertised as punk, Green Day members are platinum rock stars, and getting pierced and tatted up is as natural as a sweet-sixteen party, everyone is free to come up with their own definition of punkâand everyone is ready to embrace it. Emo had always connected with young peopleâit had just never aggressively marketed itself to them.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The media business, so desperate for its self-obsessed, post-9/11 predictions of a return to austerity and the death of irony to come true, had found its next big thing. But it was barely a &quot;thing,&quot; because no one had heard of it, and those who had couldn't define it. Despite the fact that the hedonistic, materialistic hip-hop of Nelly was still dominating the charts, magazine readers in the summer of '02 were informed that the nation was deep in an introverted healing process, and the way it was healing was by wearing thick black glasses and vintage striped shirts. Emo, we were told, would heal us all through fashion.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the wake of this success, many emo bands were signed to major record labels and the style became a marketable product.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 140â141.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dreamworks Records]] senior [[A&amp;R]] representative Luke Wood remarked that &quot;The industry really does look at emo as the new raprock, or the new grunge. I don't think that anyone is listening to the music that's being madeâthey're thinking of how they're going to take advantage of the sound's popularity at retail.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 142&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The depoliticized nature of emo, coupled with its catchy music and accessible themes, gave it a broad appeal to young mainstream audiences.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, a darker, more aggressive offshoot of emo gained popularity. New Jerseyâbased [[Thursday (band)|Thursday]] signed a multi-million-dollar, multialbum contract with [[Island Def Jam Music Group|Island Def Jam]] on the strength of their 2001 album ''[[Full Collapse]]'', which reached No. 178 on the ''Billboard'' 200.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 149â150.&lt;/ref&gt; Their music differed from the prominent emo bands of the time in that it was more politicized and lacked dominant pop hooks and anthems, drawing influence from more maudlin bands such as [[The Smiths]], [[Joy Division]], and [[The Cure]]. However, the band's accessibility, openness, basement-show roots, and touring alongside bands like Saves the Day made them part of the emo movement.&lt;ref&gt;Greewald, pp. 153â155.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emo pop===
&quot;Emo pop,&quot; also called &quot;emo pop punk,&quot;&lt;ref name=Trinity /&gt; emerged as an offshoot from emo that also embraces [[pop music]] influences, such as more concise songs and [[Hook (music)|hook]] filled [[Refrain|chorus]]es. [[Allmusic]] describes the style as blending &quot;youthful [[angst]]&quot; with &quot;slick production&quot; and mainstream appeal, using &quot;high-pitched [[Melody|melodie]]s, [[rhythm]]ic guitars, and lyrics concerning [[adolescence]], relationships, and heartbreak.&quot;&lt;ref name=Allmusic &gt;{{cite web|title=Explore: Emo-Pop|url=http://allmusic.com/explore/style/emo-pop-d13770|work=[[Allmusic]]|publisher=[[Rovi Corporation]]|accessdate=10 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s ''[[The Guardian]]'' described the style as a cross between &quot;saccharine [[boy-band]] pop&quot; and emo.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite web|last=Lester|first=Paul|title=New band of the day - No 445: Metro Station|url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/music/2008/dec/08/new-band-metro-station|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=10 June 2011|date=8 December 2008|quote=They peddle &quot;emo-pop&quot;, a sort of cross between saccharine boy-band pop and whatever it is that bands like Panic! at the Disco and Fall Out Boy do â emo, let's be frank.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern emo pop bands have toned down extremities in loud/soft variations to provide a more widespread appeal.&lt;ref name=Trinity&gt;{{cite web|last=Grehan|first=Keith|title=An Emotional Farewell?|url=http://trinitynews.ie/wordpress/archives/2368|work=[[Trinity News]]|publisher=[[WordPress]]|accessdate=11 June 2011|date=25 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion and stereotype==
Today emo is commonly tied to both music and fashion as well as the emo subculture.&lt;ref name=&quot;3news&quot;&gt;{{cite video | url = http://www.3news.co.nz/TVShows/Nightline/Archive/tabid/227/articleID/10701/cat/17/Default.aspx#video | title = Emo Culture - Why The Long Fringe? | work = Nightline | publisher = 3news | time = 1:17â1:22 | date = 2006-07-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually among teens, the term &quot;emo&quot; is stereotyped with wearing [[Slim-fit pants|slim-fit jeans]], sometimes in bright colors, and tight [[t-shirt]]s (usually short-sleeved) which often bear the names of emo bands. Studded [[belt (clothing)|belts]] and black wristbands are common accessories in emo fashion. Some males also wear thick, black [[horn-rimmed glasses]].&lt;ref name=&quot;knot magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knotmag.com/?article=885 |title=Knot Magazine â &quot;In Defense of Emo&quot; |publisher=Knotmag.com |date= |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;incendiary magazine&quot;&gt;[http://www.incendiarymag.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=43 Incendiary Magazine â &quot;EMO: What Is It?&quot;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;gurl magazine&quot;&gt;{{cite web | first=&quot;Marni&quot; | title=Label it. .. emo | work=gURL | publisher=iVillage Inc | url=http://www.gurl.com/findout/label/pages/0,,673303,00.html | accessdate=2007-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The emo fashion is also recognized for its hairstyles. Popular looks include long side-swept [[fringe (hair)|bangs]], sometimes covering one or both eyes. Also popular is hair that is straightened and dyed black. Bright colors, such as blue, pink, red, or bleached blond, are also typical as highlights in emo hairstyles. Short, choppy layers of hair are also common. This fashion has at times been characterized as a [[Fads and trends|fad]].&lt;ref name=&quot;fairfield&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last=Poretta | first=JP | date=2007-03-03 | title=Cheer up Emo Kid, It's a Brand New Day | work=The Fairfield Mirror | url=http://media.www.fairfieldmirror.com/media/storage/paper148/news/2007/03/08/Entertainment/Cheer.Up.Emo.Kid.Its.A.Brand.New.Day-2762635.shtml | accessdate=2007-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 2000s, emo fashion was associated with a clean cut look,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2002/Jan/08/il/il01a.html |title=Geek chic look is clean cut |publisher=The.honoluluadvertiser.com |date=2002-01-08 |accessdate=2011-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as the style spread to younger teenagers, the style has become darker, with long bangs and emphasis on the color black replacing [[sweater vest]]s.

==Criticism and controversy==
===Gender bias===
Emo has been criticized for its [[androcentrism]].&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 133â134.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andy Greenwald]] notes that there are very few women in emo bands, and that even those few do not typically have an active voice in the songs' subject matter: &quot;Though emoâand to a certain degree, punkâhas always been a typically male province, the monotony of the labels' gender perspective can be overwhelming.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 133&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; The triumph of the &quot;lonely boy's aesthetic&quot; in emo, coupled with the style's popularity, has led to a litany of one-sided songs in which males vent their fury at the women who have wronged them:&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 133&quot;/&gt; Some emo bands' lyrics disguise violent anti-women sentiments in a veneer of pop music.&lt;ref name=&quot;Greenwald, 135&quot;&gt;Greenwald, p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite emo's frequent portrayal of women as powerless victims, fans of the style are from both genders, and some acts have even greater popularity with women than with men.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, pp. 137â138.&lt;/ref&gt; One explanation for this is that the unifying appeal of emo, its expression of emotional devastation, can be appreciated equally by both sexes regardless of the songs' specific subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Backlash ===
[[image:Fuck Emo graffiti.jpg|thumb|150px|&quot;Fuck Emo&quot; graffiti on a wall in Mexico.]]
The genre emo inspired a backlash movement in response to its rapid growth. Several bands considered to be &quot;emo&quot; rejected the label for the social stigma and controversy surrounding it.&lt;ref&gt;[{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p741835|pure_url=yes}} Allmusic ((( Panic at the Disco &gt; Biography )))&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Suicide ===
Emo music has been blamed for the suicide by [[hanging]] of teenager Hannah Bond by both the [[coroner]] at the inquest into her death and her mother, Heather Bond, after it was claimed that emo music glamorized suicide and her apparent obsession with [[My Chemical Romance]] was said to be linked to her suicide. The inquest heard that she was part of an Internet &quot;emo cult&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;thesun&quot;/&gt; and her [[Bebo]] page contained an image of an 'emo girl' with bloody wrists.&lt;ref name=nme/&gt; It also heard that she had discussed the &quot;glamour&quot; of hanging online&lt;ref name=&quot;thesun&quot;&gt;{{cite web
