'''Rickey Eugene Reuschel''' (pronounced RUSH-el) (born May 16, 1949 in [[Quincy, Illinois]]) is a former [[Professional baseball|professional]] [[baseball]] [[pitcher]] from the early 1970s into the early 1990s.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/reuscri01.shtml?redir Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Cube&quot;&gt;[http://www.thebaseballcube.com/players/R/Rick-Reuschel.shtml Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Cube]&lt;/ref&gt; His nickname was &quot;''Big Daddy''&quot; because of his portly physique.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Page&quot;&gt;[http://www.thebaseballpage.com/players/reuscri01.php Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Page]&lt;/ref&gt; He was known for his deceptive style of pitching, which kept [[hitter]]s off balance by constantly varying the speeds of his pitches.&lt;ref name=&quot;''Rick Reuschel: He Lets Batter Get Himself Out''&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=sjQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA77&amp;dq=baseball+digest+rick+reuschel#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20digest%20rick%20reuschel&amp;f=false ''Rick Reuschel: He Lets Batter Get Himself Out'' by Casey Tefertiller, Baseball Digest, December 1988, Vol. 47, No. 12, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major League career==
Reuschel was listed as 6-foot-4 and 225 pounds, which made him a few pounds heavier than his franchise-mate from two generations earlier, [[Hippo Vaughn]]. Reuschel could run surprisingly well for his size (logging 4 triples in his batting career) and he was frequently used as a pinch runner on days he was not pitching. He was also a fair - though awkward-looking - hitter, batting well over .200 several times.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; His older brother [[Paul Reuschel]] also pitched for the Cubs for a few years while Reuschel was pitching, but was not nearly as effective as his younger brother and his career was much shorter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/r/reuscpa01.shtml Paul Reuschel at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them were Illinois farm boys, with strong physiques and plain-spoken ways. The two are the only siblings to combine on a [[shutout]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Page&quot;/&gt; On August 21, [[1975 Chicago Cubs season|1975]], Rick started and went 6{{frac|1|3}} [[Inning (baseball)|innings]] against the [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], followed by Paul, who pitched the final 2{{frac|2|3}} innings for the Cubs' 7-0 win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN197508210.shtml August 21, 1975 Dodgers-Cubs box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuschel began his [[Major League Baseball]] career when he was drafted in the third round of the [[1970 Major League Baseball Draft]] by the [[Chicago Cubs]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Page&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/players/trades.php?p=reuscri01 Rick Reuschel Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when they were declining in the post-[[Leo Durocher|Durocher]] era, and provided a strong arm for the Cubs' increasingly mediocre staff. After spending two years in the [[Minor League baseball|minor leagues]], he joined the Cubs' major league team in [[1972 Chicago Cubs season|1972]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at The Baseball Cube&quot;/&gt; His best season was in [[1977 Chicago Cubs season|1977]], when the Cubs made a brief run at the [[Pennant (sports)|pennant]]. Reuschel won 20 games and finished third in the [[Cy Young Award]] voting behind [[Steve Carlton]] and [[Tommy John]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/awards_1977.shtml#NLcya 1977 National League Cy Young Award voting results at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Reuschel pitched in a memorable game for Cub fans on July 28, 1977, when making a rare relief appearance on two days rest, he entered the 13th inning of a 15-15 tie between the Cubs and the [[Cincinnati Reds]] at [[Wrigley Field]]. Reuschel retired two batters to end the top of the 13th. Then, he singled and scored the game-winning run in the bottom of the 13th, also picking up the victory in the 16-15 contest.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/CHN/CHN197707280.shtml July 28, 1977 Reds-Cubs box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reuschel was traded to the [[New York Yankees]] in [[1981 New York Yankees season|1981]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac&quot;/&gt; That year, Reuschel made his first [[World Series]] appearances.&lt;ref name=&quot;1981 World Series at Baseball Reference&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1981_WS.shtml 1981 World Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1981 World Series]] marked the last chapter of the Dodgers-Yankees trilogy of that era, this one won by the Dodgers. Reuschel was ineffective in that Series, and it appeared his career might be finished.&lt;ref name=&quot;1981 World Series at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He returned to the Cubs and was on the roster in [[1984 Chicago Cubs season|1984]] when they won the [[National League Eastern Division]] and made the playoffs,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/CHC/1984.shtml 1984 Chicago Cubs Batting, Pitching, &amp; Fielding Statistics at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; but, somewhat controversially, he was not named to the playoff roster.

Reuschel was signed by the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] in [[1985 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1985]] as a [[free agent]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac&quot;/&gt; and had a 14-8 won-loss record with the last-place Pirates,&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; earning him the National League's [[The Sporting News Comeback Player of the Year Award|Comeback Player of the Year]] award.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Comeback Player of the Year Award at Baseball Almanac&quot;&gt;[http://www.baseball-almanac.com/awards/comeback_player_of_the_year_award.shtml The Comeback Player of the Year Award at Baseball Almanac]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=qTQDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=baseball+digest+rick+reuschel#v=onepage&amp;q=baseball%20digest%20rick%20reuschel&amp;f=false ''How Perseverence Paid Off for Rick Reuschel'' by Al Doyle, Baseball Digest, May 1986, Vol. 45, No. 5, ISSN 0005-609X]&lt;/ref&gt; The Pirates traded Reuschel to the [[San Francisco Giants]] in late [[1987 Pittsburgh Pirates season|1987]] for [[Jeff Robinson (relief pitcher)|Jeff Robinson]] and [[Scott Medvin]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel Trades and Transactions at Baseball Almanac&quot;/&gt; Reuschel, finally back with a contender, became the ace of the Giants' staff and helped them make a late run to the National League Western Division title, their first division title since [[1971 San Francisco Giants season|1971]]. He followed that season by winning 19 games for the Giants in 1988.&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;''Rick Reuschel: He Lets Batter Get Himself Out''&quot;/&gt; In [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|1989]], Reuschel won 17 games for the Giants as he helped lead them to the [[1989 World Series|World Series]] (their first since [[1962 World Series|1962]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/postseason/1989_WS.shtml 1989 World Series at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[1989 World Series]], Reuschel was the losing pitcher in Game 2 with an 11.25 [[earned run average|ERA]], five earned runs, and five hits given up against the [[Oakland Athletics]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/OAK/OAK198910150.shtml 1989 World Series Game 2 box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1989 in baseball|1989]] at the age of 40, Reuschel was selected as the starting pitcher for the National League in the [[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|1989 All-Star Game]], and gave up a lead off [[home run]] to [[Bo Jackson]], followed by [[Wade Boggs]]' home run to start the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/ALS/ALS198907110.shtml 1989 Major League All-Star game box score at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career statistics==
In a 19-year career, Reuschel compiled a record of 214-191 in 557 games (529 starts).&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; He had 102 career [[complete game]]s and 26 of those were [[shutout]]s. He allowed 1330 [[earned run]]s and 2015  [[strike out]]s in 3548 and 1/3 [[innings pitched]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Rick Reuschel at Baseball Reference&quot;/&gt; Reuschel was a two-time [[Gold Glove Award]] winner and a three-time All-Star.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baseball-reference.com/awards/gold_glove_nl.shtml#multi National League Gold Glove Award winners at Baseball Reference]&lt;/ref&gt; As of [[2009 in baseball|2009]], Reuschel was is in the [[Top 100 winning pitchers of all time]].
