Its main broadcast facilities at 5/F Summit One Bldg, Shaw Boulevard, Mandaluyong City. It's TV station ([[DWCP-TV|DWCP-TV 21]]) became the first local [[UHF]] TV station in Metro Manila in May, 1992.

==History==
Southern Broadcasting Network of [[Davao]] launched SBN Channel 21, the first local UHF TV station in [[Metro Manila]] starting 1992. It was then known as World TV 21. The idea is to bring back programming similar to the forcibly shut-down [[Far East Network|FEN]] Channel 17 of the former Clark US Air Base a year earlier due to the eruption of Mt. Pinatubo.

Beginning on January 1, 2008, [[Solar Entertainment Corporation|Solar Entertainment]] began to lease airtime on SBN, choosing to broadcast programming from its entertainment channel [[ETC (TV channel)|ETC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etc.com.ph/news.htm ETC Available on SBN 21]&lt;/ref&gt; This partnership ended in March 2, 2011, as Solar transferred ETC to [[Radio Philippines Network|RPN]]. As a result, SBN now carries the news network [[Talk TV (Philippines)|Talk TV]], headed by Jing Magsaysay, former [[ABS-CBN Corporation]]/[[ABS-CBN News Channel|ANC]] news anchor and President [[Benigno Aquino III]]'s inaugural spokesperson.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/insideBusop.htm?f=2011/february/25/vicagustin.isx&amp;d=2011/february/25 Tiengs move into news] Manila Standard Today. 02-25-2011.
