[[Arthur Morris]] was a key member of [[Donald Bradman]]'s famous [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|Australian cricket team, which toured England in 1948]]. The Australians went undefeated in their 34 matches; this unprecedented feat by a Test side touring England earned them the sobriquet ''The Invincibles''.

A left-handed [[batting order (cricket)|opening batsman]], Morris played in all five Tests, partnering the right-handed [[Sid Barnes]] in three Tests&amp;mdash;Barnes was injured for the other two Tests. As one of three on-tour selectors, Morris was a member of the leadership group along with Bradman and vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]].

Morris ended the [[first-class cricket|first-class]] tour with 1,922 runs at a [[batting average]] of 71.18 including seven [[century (cricket)|centuries]], recording the second highest aggregate behind Bradman. Morris' s form peaked in the Test series; he headed the runscoring aggregates and averages for all players with 696 runs at 87.00, and was the only player to compile three Test centuries. In the Second Test at [[Lord's]], Morris struck 105 to set up Australia's first innings of 350 and eventual win. He scored 182 on a deteriorating [[Cricket pitch|pitch]] on the final day of the Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]], combining for a triple-century partnership with Bradman.  Australia scored 3/404 in the second innings to win by seven wickets,  setting a world record for the highest successful run-chase in Test history. In the Fifth Test at [[The Oval]], Morris scored 196, more than half of Australia's 389 as the tourists went on to win by an innings.

Based on his performance during the tour of England, ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' named
Morris as one of their [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year|Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949. They described him as &quot;one of the world's best left-hand batsmen&quot;.&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt;

==Background==
During the Australian season of 1947&amp;ndash;48, which preceded the tour of England, Morris played in the first four Tests against the touring [[Indian cricket team|Indians]], scoring 45 and an [[not out|unbeaten]] 100 in the Third Test victory in [[Melbourne]]. He was omitted for the Fifth Test because the [[List_of_cricket_terms#S|selector]]s wanted to trial other candidates for the 1948 tour of England.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;&gt;{{Cite web| title= Wisden 1949 &amp;ndash; Arthur Morris |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/234445.html| year= 1949 |accessdate=2007-05-21| publisher= [[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris ended the series with 209 runs at a [[batting average]] of 52.25,&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title=Statsguru &amp;ndash; AR Morris &amp;ndash; Tests &amp;ndash; Innings by innings list| url=http://statserver.cricket.org/guru?sdb=player;playerid=760;class=testplayer;filter=basic;team=0;opposition=0;notopposition=0;season=0;homeaway=0;continent=0;country=0;notcountry=0;groundid=0;startdefault=1946-11-29;start=1946-11-29;enddefault=1955-06-17;end=1955-06-17;tourneyid=0;finals=0;daynight=0;toss=0;scheduledovers=0;scheduleddays=0;innings=0;result=0;followon=0;seriesresult=0;captain=0;keeper=0;dnp=0;recent=;viewtype=aro_list;runslow=;runshigh=;batposition=0;dismissal=0;bowposition=0;ballslow=;ballshigh=;bpof=0;overslow=;overshigh=;conclow=;conchigh=;wicketslow=;wicketshigh=;dismissalslow=;dismissalshigh=;caughtlow=;caughthigh=;caughttype=0;stumpedlow=;stumpedhigh=;csearch=;submit=1;.cgifields=viewtype| accessdate = 2007-07-16| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; making him the third highest scorer as Australia won 4&amp;ndash;0.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title= Test Batting for Australia India in Australia 1947/48|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/India_in_Australia_1947-48/t_Australia_Batting.html |accessdate=2008-12-22 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the series, he had opened with both [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]], the veteran who had been a mainstay of Australian teams of the 1930s, and New South Wales teammate [[Sid Barnes]]. The Australian selectors chose Brown for the first two Tests against the Indians, but he struggled and made only 18 and 11&amp;mdash;Australia batted once in both Tests&amp;mdash;and was then dropped for Barnes, who made only 12 and 15 in the Third Test. Retained for the Fourth Test, Barnes made 112 in an Australian victory. Morris&amp;mdash;whose place was secure&lt;ref name=pie/&gt;&amp;mdash;was rested for the Fifth Test to give Brown another chance to show that he was worthy of selection. Barnes made 33 while Brown made 99 [[run out]] as Australia completed a 4&amp;ndash;0 series win.&lt;ref name=pie&gt;Piesse, pp. 153&amp;ndash;156.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle WA Brown |url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=636&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Player Oracle SG Barnes|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/cgi-bin/player_oracle_reveals_results2.cgi?playernumber=711&amp;opponentmatch=exact&amp;playername=Meckiff&amp;resulttype=All&amp;matchtype=All&amp;teammatch=exact&amp;startwicket=&amp;homeawaytype=All&amp;opponent=&amp;endwicket=&amp;wicketkeeper=&amp;searchtype=InningsList&amp;endscore=&amp;playermatch=contains&amp;branding=cricketarchive&amp;captain=&amp;endseason=&amp;startscore=&amp;team=&amp;startseason= |accessdate=2009-05-14 |publisher=[[CricketArchive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, all three were selected for the England tour.&lt;ref name=pie/&gt; As specialist opening batsmen, the trio were competing for the two opening positions in Bradman's first-choice team.&lt;ref name=ash&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.com/Archive/Events/AUS/Marylebone_Cricket_Club_in_Australia_1946-47/t_Australia_Batting.html |title=Test Batting and Fielding for Australia Marylebone Cricket Club in Australia 1946/47|publisher=[[CricketArchive]] |accessdate=2009-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris&amp;mdash;recently appointed co-captain of [[New South Wales Blues|New South Wales]]&amp;mdash;greatly impressed Australian captain [[Don Bradman]], to the extent that Bradman made himself, Morris and vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]] the three on-tour selectors for the 1948 visit to England.&lt;ref name=&quot;p early&quot;&gt;Perry (2000), p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was a key part of Bradman's inner circle during the planning of the tour. Bradman had long harboured an ambition to tour England without losing a match;&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;&gt;Perry (2001), pp. 84&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt; his team would become the first to achieve this feat, earning themselves the [[sobriquet]], ''The Invincibles''.

==Early tour==
Morris marked his first-class debut on English soil in the opening match of the tour, against [[Worcestershire County Cricket Club|Worcestershire]].&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; After the hosts had batted first and made 233, Morris stroked with a fluent 138 (including 19 fours) from 275 minutes. He put on an [[partnership (cricket)|opening stand]] of 79 with [[Sid Barnes]], before adding 186 for the second wicket with Bradman. Australia [[declaration and forfeiture|declared]] at 8/462 before completing an innings victory.&lt;ref name=worcs&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate = 2008-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Morris and Bradman's scoring matched one another during their partnership and both were close to being the first Australian century-maker on the tour. The former was on 95 and took three runs to move to 98, before Bradman hit consecutive fours to progress from 91 to 99. The Australian captain failed to score for the rest of the over, so Morris took the [[List of cricket terms#S|strike]] in the next over and reached his century before Bradman followed suit. After reaching triple figures, Morris added his last 38 runs in 50 minutes.&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 46&amp;ndash;47.&lt;/ref&gt; Morrisâs role indicated his standing alongside Barnes as a first-choice opener, as Australia customarily selected its strongest team for the tour opener.&lt;ref name=&quot;haigh&quot;&gt;{{cite news| title=Gentrifying the game| first=Gideon | last=Haigh| authorlink=Gideon Haigh| url=http://www.cricinfo.com/ci/content/story/295893.html |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |date=2007-05-26| accessdate=2007-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The third opener taken on tour, [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]], played out of position in the middle order.&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;

Australia eventually bowled England out for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final day.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; Bradmanâs openers progressed quickly at the start of the chase. Barnes took 13 runs from the opening over by Bedser, but Morris again lacked fluency. Australia reached 38 from 32 minutes when Bedser bowled Morris for nine,&lt;ref name=f105&gt;Fingleton, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; but the tourists steadied to reached their target with eight wickets in hand.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt; After bowling several balls that moved away, Bedser caught out Morris with an inswinger.&lt;ref name=a50&gt;Arlott, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris had developed a habit of trying to defend the ball to the leg side while shuffling towards the off, and was not in a position to deal with a ball that hurried off the pitch.&lt;ref name=o53&gt;O'Reilly, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; Following the match, Fingleton criticised Morris, feeling that he was shuffling across the crease too much instead of playing from the [[List_of_cricket_terms#B|back foot]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;

==Second Test==
{{Main|Second Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
In the Second Test at [[Lord's Cricket Ground|Lord's]], Australia elected to bat first and England made an ideal start. The debutant [[Alec Coxon]] opened the bowling and removed Barnes for a [[duck (cricket)|duck]] in his second over to leave the tourists at 1/3.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Second Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152895.html |publisher=[[Wisden]] |accessdate=2008-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; England restricted the Australians in the first hour and created several near misses, particularly against Bradman, who nervous early on.&lt;ref name=o60&gt;O'Reilly, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Morris was playing fluently and scored many runs from the back cut.&lt;ref name=o60/&gt; At the end of the pace bowlersâ opening spells, the [[leg spin]] of [[Doug Wright (cricketer)|Doug Wright]] was introduced and Australia cut loose. Wright bowled a [[no ball]] that Morris dispatched over the [[leg side]] fence for [[six (cricket)|six]], before hitting another ball for four.&lt;ref name=f109&gt;Fingleton, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; Bradman and Morris settled down as Coxon and Wright operated steadily, although the latter was able to extract substantial spin, hitting Morris in the stomach with a ball that turned in sharply from outside off stump.&lt;ref name=o61&gt;O'Reilly, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; At lunch, Australia were 1/82 with Morris on 45 and Bradman on 35.&lt;ref name=f108&gt;Fingleton, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, with the score at 87, Bradman was caught for the third consecutive time in Tests in Bedser's [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|leg trap]].&lt;ref name=f109/&gt; [[Len Hutton]]&amp;mdash;who took the catch&amp;mdash;had dropped Bradman in the same position when the Australian captain was on 13.&lt;ref name=&quot;t2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f109/&gt; At the other end, Morris began to take control. He drove the ball through the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|covers]] and clipped it off his pads through the [[leg side]]. Morris reached his century with consecutive [[boundary (cricket)|boundaries]] from Coxon.&lt;ref name=f109/&gt; Fingleton called the innings &quot;a pretty Test century in the grandest of all cricket settings&quot;.&lt;ref name=f109/&gt; This ended a run of poor form for Morris, a period during which he had shuffled uncertainly on the crease without moving forward or back decisively.&lt;ref name=f110&gt;Fingleton, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  O'Reilly called it Morris's best Test century to date, as this was the strongest English attack he had faced during his career, and because of the loss of wickets at the other end. O'Reilly said Morris had been disciplined in not playing loose shots outside off stump and missing or edging them, yet still being able to score quickly at every opportunity.&lt;ref name=o65&gt;O'Reilly, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris was out soon after for 105 from 166 balls, after hitting Coxon to Hutton in the [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|gully]] to leave Australia at 3/166.&lt;ref name=&quot;t2&quot;/&gt; His innings  included 14 fours and one six, and was noted for powerful, well-placed [[Batting (cricket)#Drive|cover drives]].&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; With Morris gone, Australia fell to 7/258 at stumps, before the lower order counterattacked on the second morning and took the total to 350.&lt;ref name=t2/&gt; Bradmanâs team took a 135-run lead after dismissing England for 215.&lt;ref name=t2/&gt;

The weather was fine as Australia started their second innings on the third morning. The Australian openers took a cautious approach to begin with, avoiding the hook shot and not playing at balls that were not going to hit the stumps, looking for a solid start.&lt;ref&gt;O'Reilly, pp. 72&amp;ndash;73.&lt;/ref&gt; Both openers were given early reprieves. Barnes survived a [[stump (cricket)|stumping]] opportunity when he was 18. Laker came on and induced Morris into hitting an airborne ball back down the pitch, but he was slow to react to the possibility of a [[caught and bowled]].&lt;ref name=f113&gt;Fingleton, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt; According to O'Reilly, most other bowlers would have been able to reach the ball and attempt a catch.&lt;ref name=o73&gt;O'Reilly, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; The openers took advantage to combine for an opening stand of 122. Wright came on and again bowled a no ball at the start of his spell, which Morris lofted into the crowd for six. After shuffling around with uncertainty at the start of his innings, Morris began to play more fluently.&lt;ref name=f113/&gt; He was eventually bowled for 62, knocking a ball from Wright onto his stumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;report2&quot;/&gt; The opening partnership laid the platform for Australia's 7/460 declared, which allowed them to set an imposing target of 596 and win by 409 runs to take a 2&amp;ndash;0 series lead.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris was rested by Bradman for the second match against Surrey, which started the day after the Test and ended in a ten-wicket victory for the Australians.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; The following match was against [[Gloucestershire County Cricket Club|Gloucestershire]] at [[Bristol]], and in only five hours on the first day, Morris scored his career best of 290. Having lost the first two Tests, England were contemplating changes to their team: [[Tom Goddard]] was earmarked to replace [[Jim Laker]] as the [[off spin]]ner after performing strongly in [[county cricket]], while Laker had struggled in the Second Test.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt; The English hoped Goddard would be the [[List_of_cricket_terms#S|strike bowler]] to cut through Australia's strong batting line-up. Morris's assault ended Goddard's hopes of Test selection. His innings was highlighted by his quick assessment of the length of the ball, followed by decisive footwork. Morris confidently advanced out of the crease when the ball was of a [[Fast_bowling#Length|full length]] to drive and rocked onto the back foot to and cut if Goddard dropped short.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt; Unable to contain Morris, Goddard packed the [[leg side]] field and [[leg theory|bowled outside leg stump]]. Morris responded by [[List of cricket terms#C|stepping down the wicket towards the leg side]], charging the bowler and repeatedly lofting the ball inside out over the [[Fielding (cricket)#Off and leg side fields|off side]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt; He reached his century before lunch and his 200 by the tea interval. By the time Morris was dismissed, he had struck 40 [[boundary (cricket)|fours]] and a [[six (cricket)|six]].&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; He put on stands of 102 with Barnes, 136 with [[Keith Miller]] and 162 with [[Neil Harvey]] before falling with the score at 4/466.&lt;ref name=gloucs/&gt; Fingleton said &quot;Morris flayed it [the home team's bowling] in all directions&quot;,&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; while former English Test [[fast bowling|paceman]] [[Maurice Tate]] said &quot;Tom [Goddard] is not used to batsmen using their feet to him&amp;nbsp;...&amp;nbsp;the county batsmen diddle and diddle [shuffle about indecisively instead of quickly moving into position and attacking] to him and that gets him many wickets.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 199.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia amassed 5/560 on the first day before declaring at 7/774,&lt;ref name=gloucs&gt;{{Cite web

==Third Test==
{{Main|Third Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
Following his effort in Bristol, Morris proceeded to the Third Test at [[Old Trafford Cricket Ground|Old Trafford]]. England batted first and made 363. During the innings, Barnes was hit in the kidneys by a [[Dick Pollard]] pull shot while fielding at short leg. When Australia started their first innings reply, Barnes was still recuperating after being carried from the field and taken to hospital for a medical examination.&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Third Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152896.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having dropped Brown for the Test, Barnes's injury left Australia with only Morris as a specialist opener. Off spinner [[Ian Johnson (cricketer)|Ian Johnson]] was deployed as Australia's makeshift second opener. He was unable to make an impact, as Bedser removed him for one, before Pollard trapped Bradman [[leg before wicket]] (lbw) to leave Australia at 2/13.&lt;ref name=&quot;t3&quot;/&gt; The tourists were pinned down as Pollard bowled 17 consecutive overs from his long run, aiming at leg stump.&lt;ref name=f138&gt;Fingleton, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Pollard was reinforced by Bedser, who bowled unchanged for 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=f138&gt;Fingleton, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris and Hassett rebuilt the innings, adding 69 for the third wicket in 101 minutes before the latter fell. Miller joined Morris and the pair took the score to 3/126 at stumps, with the latter&amp;mdash;who had been the more sedate in the partnership&amp;mdash;on 48.&lt;ref name=&quot;t3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=a88&gt;Arlott, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Australia struggled against the new ball in the first hour of the day three. Miller played and missed three times in one over before being trapped lbw for 31;&lt;ref name=f139&gt;Fingleton, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; the tourists added only nine runs in the first hour.&lt;ref name=t3/&gt; Four runs later, Morris reached 51 and fell to Bedser, leaving Australia at 5/139.&lt;ref name=&quot;t3&quot;/&gt; It had been a slow morning for Morris&amp;mdash;he took 21 minutes to add a single to his overnight total and reached 50 after taking another 24 minutes to register his second run of the day.&lt;ref name=&quot;t3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f140&gt;Fingleton, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia fell for 221, narrowly avoiding the follow on, and England declared at 3/174 on the last morning after many rain delays. This left Bradmanâs team with a victory target of 317, but the rain kept falling and the entire morning was lost.&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;/&gt;

Play finally began after the tea, and the pitch played very slowly because of the excess moisture. As Australia had no intention of chasing the runs, England captain [[Norman Yardley]] often installed seven men in close catching positions.&lt;ref name=f146&gt;Fingleton, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half hour, the tourists showed little attacking intent and scored only six runs. Johnson then fell for six to leave Australia at 1/10.&lt;ref name=t3/&gt;&lt;ref name=f146/&gt; Bradman came to the crease and played 11 balls without scoring while Morris scored two streaky fours from Bedser. Yardley used his spinners for an hour, while Morris and Bradman made little effort to score. For 105 minutes, Morris stayed at one end and Bradman at the other; neither looked to [[List of cricket terms#S|rotate the strike]] by taking singles. The Australian skipper faced only eight balls from Morris's main end, and at one point was so startled when his partner wanted a single that he sent him back.&lt;ref name=f146/&gt; Thereafter, the tourists batted steadily and defensively to ensure a draw. They ended at 1/92 from 61 overs, a [[run rate]] of 1.50, with 35 [[over (cricket)|maidens]];&lt;ref name=&quot;t3&quot;/&gt; this was the slowest innings run rate for the series to date.&lt;ref name=&quot;t1&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;t2&quot;/&gt; Morris finished unbeaten on 54, his fourth consecutive half-century during the Test series. The match finally ended after a series of periodic rain interruptions.&lt;ref name=&quot;t3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report3&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f146/&gt;

Morris struck 109 against [[Middlesex County Cricket Club|Middlesex]] in the following tour match at Lordâs.The hosts batted first and made 203,  and Australia stumbled to 3/53 before Morris combined with [[Sam Loxton]] (123) for a 172-run fourth-wicket stand. Australia recovered to reach 317 and went on to a ten-wicket win.&lt;ref name=&quot;middlesex&quot;/&gt; Morris's century meant he had amassed 504 runs in just over a week of cricket.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fourth Test==
{{Main|Fourth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
[[Image:Morris&amp;Bradman.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Morris (left) with Don Bradman: their partnership won the Fourth Test at Headingley in 1948]]

The Fourth Test at [[Headingley Stadium|Headingley]] in [[Leeds]] saw Morris at his finest; England elected to bat and started strongly with 496 in the first innings, their highest score of the series.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; On a placid pitch, Morris was one of seven bowlers used as Bradman sought a breakthrough; each of the first three wickets put on century partnerships.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt; [[Bill Edrich]] hit a [[long hop]] from Morris's [[left arm unorthodox spin]] to the boundary to reach his century,&lt;ref name=f157&gt;Fingleton, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; before Bedser lifted him high over [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|square leg]] for six. This prompted Bradman to replace Morris after he conceded 20 runs in five overs as England reached 2/423.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;&lt;ref name=f157/&gt; Edrich was out when he attempted to [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|pull]] Johnson to the on side in the large gap between mid-on and square leg, but only hit it in the air to Morris,&lt;ref name=f157/&gt; who completed the catch diving forwards at wide mid-on to leave the score at 4/426,&lt;ref name=o119&gt;O'Reilly, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; before England collapsed to 496.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;

England took a 38-run lead after Australia replied with 458.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt; Morris contributed only six while batting with vice-captain [[Lindsay Hassett]], who had been promoted from the middle order to open while Barnes was still injured; Bradman had overlooked reserve opener Brown.&lt;ref name=report4/&gt; Morris chipped Bedser in the air to [[Ken Cranston]] at [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|mid-wicket]] to leave Australia at 1/13.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;&lt;ref name=f158&gt;Fingleton, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia slumped to 3/68 before a middle-order fightback took Australia to 458 early on the fourth morning.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt; England declared at 8/365 early on the fifth morning,&lt;ref name=report4/&gt; leaving Australia to chase 404 runs for victory. Batting into the final day allowed Yardley the right to ask the groundsman to use a [[road roller|heavy roller]], which would help to break up the wicket and make the surface more likely to spin and bounce unevenly.&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt;

At the time, 404 would have been the highest ever fourth innings score to result in a Test victory for the batting side. Australia had only 345 minutes to reach their target, and the local press wrote them off, predicting that they would be dismissed by lunchtime on a deteriorating wicket expected to favour spin bowlers.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt; Morris and Hassett started slowly, scoring only six runs in the first six [[over (cricket)|overs]] on a pitch offering spin and bounce.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; It appeared they were playing carefully at first before deciding whether to try to achieve the target at a later point.&lt;ref name=o138/&gt; In Bedser's second over, the third of the innings,&lt;ref name=t4/&gt; Morris chipped the ball in the air towards mid-wicket, in a similar manner to his first innings dismissal, but this time the ball evaded Cranston. After 15 minutes, Australia had only made 0/10.&lt;ref name=f174&gt;Fingleton, p. 174.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bedser had bowled three overs, Laker replaced him in the seventh over as Yardely attempted to exploit the turning surface,&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;&lt;ref name=f174/&gt; but 13 runs were taken from his first over. Hassett hit a four and took a single to rotate the strike. Later in the over, Morris hit a four, was beaten by a bouncing ball that hurried off the pitch, before striking another boundary.&lt;ref name=o138/&gt;&lt;ref name=f174/&gt; Despite the expensive Laker over, only 44 runs came in the first hour, meaning that the tourists still needed 360 runs from 285 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=p15/&gt; The crowd heckled the Australian openers for their slow scoring and they applauded ironically after Morris took a single.&lt;ref name=f174/&gt; After his poor first over, Laker had settled down and conceded only two runs from his next six overs,&lt;ref name=a117&gt;Arlott, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; and &quot;was getting at least one ball every over to turn considerably&quot;.&lt;ref name=o138&gt;O'Reilly, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to exploit the worn surface, Yardley brought on the part-time [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] of Compton to partner Laker. The occasional bowler was inaccurate and Morris struck two fours in his first over to bring up Australia's 50 in 64 minutes. However, Compton's deceived Morris&amp;mdash;who danced down the pitch and missed the ball&amp;mdash;in the next over, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity with the batsman on 32 and Australia at 0/55.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 174&amp;ndash;175.&lt;/ref&gt; Laker beat Morris in the following over with an [[off break]] that spun a foot, before Compton removed Hassett for 17 with the score at 57.&lt;ref name=f175&gt;Fingleton, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bradman joined Morris with 347 runs needed in 271 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f175/&gt; The Australian captain signalled his intentions by reaching 12 in only six minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f175/&gt; Yardley then called upon the occasional [[leg spin]] of Hutton in an attempt to exploit the turning wicket. However, Hutton did not bowl regularly so he had trouble in maintaining his consistency. Morris promptly joined Bradman in the counter-attack, hitting three consecutive fours to reach 51 during Hutton's first over, which Fingleton described as &quot;rather terrible&quot; due to the errant length.&lt;ref name=f175/&gt; Bradman took two fours off Hutton's next over before almost hitting a catch. However, the 20 runs from Hutton's two inaccurate overs had allowed Australia to reach 1/96 from 90 minutes.&lt;ref name=f175/&gt;

In the next over, Compton greatly troubled Bradman, who edged two balls and was dropped once.&lt;ref&gt;Fingleton, pp. 175&amp;ndash;176.&lt;/ref&gt; At the other end, Morris continued to take advantage of Hutton's inaccurate [[leg break]]s, and Australia reached lunch at 1/121, with the opener on 63 and his captain on 35.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot;&gt;Pollard, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton had conceded 30 runs in four overs,&lt;ref name=f176&gt;Fingleton, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the half hour preceding the interval, Australia had added 64 runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Fourth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152897.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Australia had scored at a reasonable rate, they had also been troubled by many of the deliveries and were expected to face further difficulty if they were to avoid defeat.&lt;ref name=o139&gt;O'Reilly, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon resumption, Compton continued as Yardley persisted with his policy of trying to exploit the deteriorating pitch with as much spin as possible. Compton was not a regular bowler and sent down a series of [[full toss]]es and [[long hop]]s that were easily dispatched for runs.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; Morris struck seven fours in two overs of what Fingleton called &quot;indescribably bad bowling&quot;.&lt;ref name=f176/&gt; This sequence included six fours in eight balls.&lt;ref name=a119&gt;Arlott, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; As Morris continued to attack, Compton began to crack under the pressure and his accuracy worsened.&lt;ref name=o139/&gt; Compton had generated trouble for the batsmen by tossing the ball up and beating the bat or inducing edges, but Morris counterattacked with drives. Compton tried to hold back his length to avoid being driven, but the Australian opener pounced on the shorter balls.&lt;ref name=o140&gt;O'Reilly, p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris reached the 90s just 14 minutes after the interval and hit another boundary to reach his century in just over two hours. Morris had added 37 runs since lunch, while Bradman had furthered his total by only three.&lt;ref name=f176/&gt;

The Australian onslaught against the spinners prompted Yardley to take the new ball and replace Compton with his fast men.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt; Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and Yardley dropped him soon after.&lt;ref name=f176/&gt; Australia reached 202&amp;mdash;halfway to the required total&amp;mdash;with 165 minutes remaining, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker to the fence.&lt;ref name=f176/&gt; Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a [[fibrositis]] attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken during a delay for treatment,&lt;ref name=f177&gt;Fingleton, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; and Morris had to shield Bradman from the [[List_of_cricket_terms#S|strike]] until the skipperâs pain had subsided.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt; Australia reached 250 shortly before tea, with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century as the second-wicket stand passed 200.&lt;ref name=f177/&gt;

Morris was given another life on 136, when Laker dropped him at square leg from the bowling of Compton. Bradman was given another life at 108; he advanced two metres down the pitch towards Laker and missed, but Evans fumbled the stumping opportunity.&lt;ref name=&quot;report4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=f177/&gt; Australia reached tea at 1/292 with Morris on 150. The pair had added 171 during the session. Morris was eventually dismissed by Yardley for 182,&lt;ref name=&quot;t4&quot;/&gt; after hitting a tired-looking shot to mid-off,&lt;ref name=o140/&gt; having partnered Bradman for a stand of 301 in 217 minutes. He struck 33 fours in 290 minutes of batting. Australia still needed 46 for victory,&lt;ref name=&quot;t4&quot;/&gt; and went on to win by seven wickets with 15 minutes to spare, setting a new world record for the highest successful Test run-chase.&lt;ref name=&quot;b ashes&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;t4&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;p15&quot;/&gt;

Morris was rested for the match against [[Derbyshire County Cricket Club|Derbyshire]] immediately after the Headingley Test, which Australia won by an innings,&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; as well as the next match against [[Glamorgan County Cricket Club|Glamorgan]], which was a rain-affected draw.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=glam/&gt; He returned to score 32 and 20 [[not out]] as Australia defeated [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] by nine wickets.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Australia faced Lancashire for the second time on the tour; Morris made 49 and 16 as the match ended in a draw. Morris and Barnes put on 123 in the first innings, but their teammates were unable to build on the platform and Australia ended on 321.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=lancs/&gt; Morris was rested from the non-first-class match against [[Durham County Cricket Club|Durham]], which was a rain-affected draw.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;durham&quot;/&gt;

==Fifth Test==
{{Main|Fifth Test, 1948 Ashes series}}
Australia proceeded to [[The Oval]] for the Fifth Test. England won the toss and elected to bat on a pitch affected by heavy rain prior to the match.&lt;ref name=report5/&gt; With the score at 2/17,&lt;ref name=t5/&gt; Lindwall bowled a [[bouncer (cricket)|bouncer]], which Compton [[Batting (cricket)#Pull and hook|hooked]].

In contrast, Australia batted with ease,&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; as the overcast skies cleared and sun came out.&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;/&gt; The debutant [[Allan Watkins]] opened the bowling, delivering four overs for 19 runs before the after-effects of a Lindwall blow to the shoulder became too much.&lt;ref name=&quot;t5&quot;/&gt; The openers passed England's first innings total with ease in less than an hour,&lt;ref name=o151&gt;O'Reilly, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia reached 100 at 17:30, with Barnes on 52 and Morris on 47.&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt; The tourists reached 117 before Barnes fell to [[Eric Hollies]] for 61, ending an opening stand that had been compiled in only 126 minutes.&lt;ref name=&quot;t5&quot;/&gt; This brought Bradman to the crease late on the first day.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; As the Australian captain had already announced his retirement after the end of the series,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/bradman/bio-page.htm#14|title=Biographical essay by Michael Page|publisher=State Library South Australia|accessdate=2008-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the innings would be his last in Test cricket if Australia batted only once. The crowd gave him a standing ovation as he walked out to the wicket.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; Yardley led the Englishmen in giving Bradman three cheers,&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; before shaking his hand.&lt;ref name=&quot;f186&quot;/&gt; The Australian captain needed only four runs for a Test average of 100,&lt;ref name=Nineinterview&gt;{{Cite web| url = http://www-uk8.cricket.org/link_to_database/PLAYERS/AUS/B/BRADMAN_DG_02000492/ARTICLES/BRADMAN_PAGES/BRADMAN_INTERVIEW.html | publisher = Cricinfo | title = The Bradman interview (transcript)| accessdate = 2007-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was bowled by Hollies for a second ball [[duck (cricket)|duck]] with a [[googly]] that went between bat and pad.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt; Bradman received another large round of applause as he left the arena.&lt;ref name=&quot;f187&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hassett came in at 2/117 and together with Morris saw Australia to the close at 2/153. Morris was unbeaten on 77,&lt;ref name =&quot;t5&quot;/&gt; having hooked Hollies for two fours just before stumps.&lt;ref name=&quot;t5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;&gt;{{Cite web|title= Fifth Test Match England v Australia |work= [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]] |year=1949  |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/152898.html |accessdate=2008-07-02 |publisher=[[Wisden]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the second morning, Morris registered his third century of the Test series and his sixth in [[The Ashes|Ashes]] matches. The innings had taken 208 minutes and included four fours.&lt;ref name=&quot;f187&quot;/&gt; Hassett and Morris took the score to 226 before their 109-run stand was broken when Young trapped the former for 37.&lt;ref name=&quot;t5&quot;/&gt; As the Australians had dismissed their hosts cheaply on the first day and were already well in the lead, they had plenty of time to complete a victory, so Hassett and Morris had no need to take undue risks and scored at a sedate pace.&lt;ref name=a129&gt;Arlott, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The following batsmen were unable to establish themselves at the crease. Miller made five,&lt;ref name=&quot;f188&quot;&gt;Fingleton, p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; before Harvey came to the crease and hit two quick boundaries before being dismissed. Hollies took both wickets.&lt;ref name=&quot;f188&quot;/&gt;

Loxton came in and accompanied Morris for 39 further runs before falling to Edrich.&lt;ref name=&quot;t5&quot;/&gt; Lindwall fell for nine before Morris was finally removed for 196, ending an innings noted for his [[Batting (cricket)#Types of batting shots|hooking and off-driving]]. It took a [[run out]] to remove Morris; he attempted a quick run after the ball was hit to [[Fielding (cricket)#Fielding position names and locations|third man]]. Morris was called through for a run by [[Don Tallon]], but he was too slow for the substitute fielder [[Reg Simpson]]'s arm.&lt;ref name=&quot;report5&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=a130&gt;Arlott, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Australia went on to finish with 389.&lt;ref&gt;Pollard, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris had scored more than half the runs as the rest of the team struggled against the [[leg spin]] of Hollies, who took 5/131. Hollies tossed the ball up repeatedly, coaxing the Australians into attacking balls that spun after pitching on off stump.&lt;ref name=&quot;f188&quot;/&gt; Morris took four catches for the match as Australia took victory by an innings and 149 runs, sealing a 4&amp;ndash;0 Test series triumph.&lt;ref name=t5/&gt;

==Later tour matches==
Seven matches remained on Bradman's quest to go through a tour of England without defeat.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Australia batted first against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]] and Morris made 43 in a total of 361 before Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory.&lt;ref name=o/&gt; Morris was rested for the following three matches against the [[Gentlemen of England]], [[Somerset County Cricket Club|Somerset]] and the [[South of England cricket team|South of England]]. The first two matches were won by innings while the third was washed out after Australia took a large first-innings lead.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt; In the meantime, Morris underwent minor surgery for a split in his hand.&lt;ref name=wisden/&gt;

Australia's biggest challenge in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI, named after [[H. D. G. Leveson-Gower]]. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current Test players be allowed to play for the hosts. After his demands were met, Bradman named a full-strength team.&lt;ref&gt;Perry (2005), pp. 253&amp;ndash;254.&lt;/ref&gt; After the tourists dismissed the home team for 177, Morris made 62 in a 102-run opening stand with Barnes before Yardley bowled him. Australia declared at 8/489 and time ran out with Leveson-Gower's XI at 2/75 after multiple rain delays.&lt;ref name=lg&gt;{{Cite web

The tour ended with two non-first-class matches against [[Scotland national cricket team|Scotland]]. In the first match, Morris was the mainstay of the innings, scoring 112 as Australia batted first and made 236. The Scots replied with 85 and were forced to [[follow on]]. Morris led the wicket-taking in the second innings, taking 5/10 from five overs as the hosts fell for 111 to hand the Australians an innings victory. He continued his success in the second match, taking three of Scotland's first four batsmen to end with 3/17 as the hosts fell for 178. Batting at No. 7, Morris made 10 as Australia declared at 6/407 and bowled four overs for eight runs without taking a wicket as Bradmanâs men ended the tour with another innings victory.&lt;ref name=sched/&gt;&lt;ref name=o/&gt;

==Role==
[[Image:Arthur Morris graph 1948.png|300px|right|thumb|A chart showing Morris's batting performance during the tour. The runs scored per innings are represented by the bars, with the red bars being Test innings and the pink bars being other first-class innings. The blue line is the average of the five most recent innings and the dots indicate [[not out]]s.&lt;ref name=o/&gt;]]

A left-handed opening batsman, Morris played in all five Tests, partnering the right-handed [[Sid Barnes]] in three Tests; Barnes was injured in the Third and Fourth Tests. Barnes was unable to open in the former and did not play in the latter.&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref name=t2/&gt;&lt;ref name=t3/&gt;&lt;ref name=t4/&gt;&lt;ref name=t5/&gt; Three opening batsmen were taken on the tour, with [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown]] being the reserve. During the tour matches, which were usually played consecutively with only one or no days between fixtures,&lt;ref name=sched/&gt; Bradman rotated the trio, so one would generally be rested while the other two opened.&lt;sup&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:#00f&quot;&gt;N-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;{{Ref label|bat|1|a}} Notable exceptions occurred in the Test series and the opening match against Worcestershire and the clash against the MCC. In those matches, Australia fielded its first-choice team; Brown played out of position in the middle order, while Morris and Barnes opened.&lt;ref name=worcs/&gt;&lt;ref name=t1/&gt;&lt;ref name=t2/&gt;&lt;ref name=mcc/&gt; A very occasional [[left-arm unorthodox spin]] bowler, Morris delivered only 35 overs during the first-class matches, including eight in the Tests. He took two wickets, both outside the Test arena.&lt;ref name=aus/&gt;&lt;ref name=fc/&gt;

Morris ended the first-class matches with 1,922 runs at 71.18 including seven centuries, ranking him second in runs only to Bradman (2,428 at 89.92) and substantially ahead of third-placed Hassett (1,563 at 74.42).&lt;ref name=fc/&gt; He did so despite being troubled by a split between the first and second fingers of his left hand, caused by constant jarring from the bat as he played the ball. The wound often opened while he was batting, forcing him to undergo a minor operation which sidelined him from some matches in the latter part of the tour.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;

In recognition of his performances, Morris was named as one of the five [[Wisden Cricketers of the Year]] in 1949. ''[[Wisden]]'' described him as &quot;one of the world's best left-hand batsmen&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;wisden&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;testlist&quot;/&gt; [[Neville Cardus]]&amp;mdash;his former critic&amp;mdash;praised Morris's performance during ''The Invincibles'' tour as &quot;masterful, stylish, imperturbable, sure in defence, quick and handsome in stroke play. His batting is true to himself, charming and good mannered but reliant and thoughtful.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;p ashes&quot;/&gt;

Morris's form peaked in The Ashes, heading the Test averages and aggregates with 696 runs at 87.00. Bradman (502 at 72.57) and [[Denis Compton]] (562 at 62.44) were the next closest; nobody else scored more than 360 runs. He was the only player to compile three Test centuries, and added three further fifties.&lt;ref name=aus&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=2;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 &amp;ndash; Australia |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fc&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling.html?class=4;id=1070;type=tour |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages Australia tour of England, Apr-Sep 1948 &amp;ndash; First-class matches|accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/engine/records/averages/batting_bowling_by_team.html?id=83;team=1;type=series |publisher=[[Cricinfo]] |title=Batting and bowling averages The Ashes, 1948 &amp;ndash; England |accessdate=2008-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
