[[File:Nintendo former headquarter plate Kyoto.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Former headquarters plate, from when Nintendo was solely a playing card company]]

===As a card company (1889â1956)===
Nintendo was founded as a card company in late 1889, originally named ''Nintendo Koppai''. Based in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]], the business produced and marketed a [[playing card]] game called [[Hanafuda]]. The handmade cards soon became popular, and Yamauchi hired assistants to mass produce cards to satisfy demand. Nintendo continues to manufacture playing cards in Japan&lt;ref name=&quot;nintendo's card game product&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/n09/index.html|title=Nintendo's card game product|publisher= nintendo |accessdate=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and organizes its own [[contract bridge]] tournament called the &quot;Nintendo Cup&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;List of japan contract bridge league tounaments &quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcbl.or.jp/english/tournament.html|title=list of japan contract bridge league tounaments|publisher= jcbl|language=japanese|accessdate=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New ventures (1956â1974)===
In 1956, [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] (grandson of Fusajiro Yamauchi) visited the U.S. to talk with the [[United States Playing Card Company]], the dominant playing card manufacturer there. He found that the world's biggest company in his business was only using a small office.  This was a turning point when Yamauchi realized the limitations of the playing card business. He then gained access to Disney's characters and put them on the playing cards to drive sales.

[[File:Nintendo love tester.jpg|220px|thumb|left|The Nintendo [[Love Tester]]]]

In 1963, Yamauchi renamed Nintendo Playing Card Co. Ltd. to Nintendo Co., Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendo.co.uk/NOE/en_GB/service/nintendo_history_9911.html |archiveurl=http://www.webcitation.org/5vQB0bQ5E |archivedate=1 January 2011 |title=Nintendo History |publisher=Nintendo of Europe GmbH |accessdate=1 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company then began to experiment in other areas of business using newly injected capital. During this period of time between 1963 and 1968, Nintendo set up a [[Taxicab|taxi]] company, a [[love hotel]] chain, a TV network, a food company (selling [[instant rice]], similar to [[instant noodles]]) and several other things.  All of these ventures eventually failed, and after the 1964 [[1964 Summer Olympics|Tokyo Olympics]], playing card sales dropped, and Nintendo's stock price plummeted to [[Japanese yen|Â¥]]60.

In 1966, Nintendo moved into the Japanese toy industry with the [[Ultra Hand]], an extendable arm developed by its maintenance engineer [[Gunpei Yokoi]] in his free time. Yokoi was moved from maintenance to the new &quot;Nintendo Games&quot; department as a product developer. Nintendo continued to produce popular toys, including the [[Ultra Machine]], [[Love Tester]] and the ''Kousenjuu'' series of light gun games. Despite some successful products, Nintendo struggled to meet the fast development and manufacturing turnaround required in the toy market, and fell behind the well-established companies such as [[Bandai]] and [[Takara Tomy|Tomy]].

In 1973, its focus shifted to family entertainment venues with the [[Laser Clay Shooting System]], using the same light gun technology used in Nintendo's ''Kousenjuu'' series of toys, and set up in abandoned bowling alleys. Following some success, Nintendo developed several more light gun machines for the emerging arcade scene. While the Laser Clay Shooting System ranges had to be shut down following excessive costs, Nintendo had found a new market.

===Electronic era (since 1974)===
Nintendo's first venture into the video-gaming industry was securing rights to distribute the [[Magnavox Odyssey]] [[video game console]] in Japan in 1974. Nintendo began to produce its own hardware in 1977, with the [[Color TV Game]] home video game consoles. Four versions of these consoles were produced, each including variations of a single game (for example, Color TV Game 6 featured six versions of ''Light Tennis'').

A student product developer named [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] was hired by Nintendo at this time.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM_CBS&quot;&gt;{{cite news|title=Famous Names in Gaming|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2316-100_162-1673418-2.html|publisher=[[CBS]]|date=|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked for Yokoi, and one of his first tasks was to design the casing for several of the Color TV Game consoles. Miyamoto went on to create, direct and produce some of Nintendo's most famous video games and become one of the most recognizable figures in the video game industry.&lt;ref name=&quot;SM_CBS&quot;/&gt;

In 1975, Nintendo moved into the video [[arcade game]] industry with ''[[EVR Race]]'', designed by their first game designer, [[Genyo Takeda]],&lt;ref name=&quot;Iwata Asks-Punch Out!!&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://us.wii.com/iwata_asks/punchout/vol1_page1.jsp|title=Iwata Asks-Punch-Out!!|publisher= Nintendo|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and several more titles followed. Nintendo had some small success with this venture, but the release of ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'' in 1981, designed by Miyamoto, changed Nintendo's fortunes dramatically. The success of the game and many licensing opportunities (such as ports on the [[Atari 2600]], [[Intellivision]] and [[ColecoVision]]) gave Nintendo a huge boost in profit.

[[File:Nes-console-with-controller.jpg|220px|thumb|The [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES)]]

In 1980, Nintendo launched ''[[Game &amp; Watch]]''âa [[handheld video game]] series developed by Yokoi where each game was played on a separate deviceâto worldwide success. In 1983, Nintendo launched the Family Computer (commonly shortened &quot;Famicom&quot;), known outside Japan as the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES), home video game console in Japan, alongside ports of its most popular arcade titles.  In 1985, the NES launched in North America, and was accompanied by ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', currently one of the best-selling video games of all time.&lt;ref&gt;Nagata, Kazuaki, &quot;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nn20090310i1.html Nintendo secret: It's all in the game]&quot;, ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 March 2009, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, Yokoi developed the [[Game Boy]] [[handheld game console]].

The Nintendo Entertainment System was superseded by the Super Famicom, known outside Japan as the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] (SNES). This was Nintendo's console of the 16-bit {{ordinal|4}} generation, following the Famicom of the 8-bit {{ordinal|3}} generation, whose main rival was the [[Mega Drive|Sega Mega Drive/Genesis]]. A fierce [[Console wars|console war]] between Sega and Nintendo ensued.&lt;ref&gt;[[#CITEREFKent2001|Kent (2001)]], p. 431. &quot;''Sonic'' was an immediate hit, and many consumers who had been loyally waiting for Super NES to arrive now decided to purchase Genesis.... The fiercest competition in the [[history of video games]] was about to begin.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; The SNES eventually sold 49.10 million consoles,&lt;ref name=&quot;consolidatedsales&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/library/historical_data/pdf/consolidated_sales_e0912.pdf |title=Consolidated Sales Transition by Region|accessdate=2010-02-14|date=2010-01-27|publisher=Nintendo|format=PDF|archiveurl= http://www.webcitation.org/5nXieXX2B |archivedate=2010-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; around 20 million more than the Mega Drive/Genesis.

During the dominance of the Game Boy line, its creator, Yokoi, designed the [[Virtual Boy]], a table-mounted semi-portable console featuring [[stereoscopy|stereoscopic graphics]]. Users view games through a binocular eyepiece and control games using a gamepad. Rushed to market in 1995 to compensate for development delays with the upcoming Nintendo 64, the Virtual Boy was a commercial failure due to poor third-party support and a large price point. Amid the systems's failure, Yokoi was asked to leave Nintendo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|title=The 10 Worst-Selling Consoles of All Time|accessdate= 2010-06-12|first=Blake|last=Snow|publisher=[[GamePro]]|date=2007-05-04|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20110607134204/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/111823/the-10-worst-selling-consoles-of-all-time-page-2-of-2/|archivedate=2011-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's next home console, the [[Nintendo 64]], was released in 1996 and features [[3D computer graphics|3D graphics]] capabilities and built-in [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] for up to four players. The system's controller introduced the [[analog stick]]. Nintendo later introduced the [[Rumble Pak]], an accessory for the Nintendo 64 controller that produced [[Haptic technology|force feedback]] with compatible games. It was the first such device to come to market for home console gaming and eventually became an industry standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://retro.ign.com/articles/864/864231p1.html |title=IGN: Happy Birthday, Rumble Pak|first=Levi|last= Buchanan|date=2008-04-03|publisher=IGN|accessdate=2008-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nintendo GameCube]] followed in 2001 and was the first Nintendo console to utilize [[optical disc]] storage instead of [[ROM cartridge|cartridges]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/history.jsp|title=Nintendo - Corporate Information - Company History|accessdate=2009-07-24|publisher=Nintendo}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent home console, the [[Wii]], uses motion sensing controllers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/wii/what/controllers#remote|title=Controllers at Nintendo :: Wii :: What Is Wii?|accessdate=2009-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has on-board online functionality used for services such as [[Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection]] and [[Internet Channel]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/wii/internet|title=Wii + Internet at Nintendo|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; (in contrast to GameCube's limited functionality on select games with an additional modem accessory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite manual|title=Nintendo GameCube Modem Adapter Instruction Booklet|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/downloads/modem_english.pdf|publisher=[[Nintendo of America Inc.|Nintendo of America, Inc.]]|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The Wii's success, as well as the success of the DS, introduced an expansion of audience to broader and non-traditional demographics, a business model with which Nintendo has had success.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Contrarily, the new business model has also resulted in some long-time gamers abandoning the Nintendo console for its competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hardcore Nintendo: Why the Wii isn't Just for Casual Gamers Anymore|url=http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/209524/hardcore-nintendo-why-the-wii-isnt-just-for-casual-gamers-anymore/|author=Rudden, Dave; Ashby, Alicia|date=2009-03-21|accessdate=2010-06-13|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20100206181339/http://www.gamepro.com/article/features/209524/hardcore-nintendo-why-the-wii-isnt-just-for-casual-gamers-anymore/|archivedate=2010-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Handheld console history====
[[File:Nintendo-3DS-AquaOpen.png|220px|thumb|The [[Nintendo 3DS]], Nintendo's latest handheld video game system which features [[autostereoscopy|autostereoscopic 3D]].]]
After the successful ''Game &amp; Watch'', the handheld development continued with the [[Game Boy]], the [[Gameboy pocket|Game Boy Pocket]] and [[Game Boy Color]], with the latter two differing in fairly minor aspects.  The Game Boy, the best-selling handheld and third best-selling console of all time, continued for more than a decade until the release of the [[Game Boy Advance]], featuring improved technical specifications similar to those of the SNES.  The [[Game Boy Advance SP]], a [[Frontlight|frontlit]] ([[Backlight|backlit]] in later editions), flip-screen version, introduced a rechargeable, built-in battery, which ended the need for [[AA battery|AA batteries]] in previous consoles.  The [[Game Boy Micro]] was released in 2005, after the Nintendo DS's release, but did not sell as well as its predecessors.

The [[Nintendo DS]] replaced the [[Game Boy line]] sometime after its initial release in 2004, originally advertised as an alternative to the Game Boy Advance.&lt;ref name=&quot;newconsole&quot;&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/541/541729p1.html|title=Nintendo Going Back to the Basics. Full story about the company offering a new system in 2004.|accessdate=2007-10-04|date=2003-11-13|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was distinctive because it had two screens and a microphone, in a clamshell design continuing on from the Game Boy Advance SP.

The [[Nintendo DS Lite]], a remake of the DS, improved several features of the original model, including the battery life and screen brightness.  It was designed to be sleeker, more beautiful, and more aesthetically pleasing than the original, in order to appeal to a broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Peter|date =2006-02-20| url= http://www.engadget.com/2006/02/20/the-engadget-interview-reggie-fils-aime-executive-vice-preside/|title= The Engadget Interview: Reggie Fils-Aime, Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing for Nintendo|publisher= Engadget|accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On November 1, 2008, Nintendo released, in Japan, the [[Nintendo DSi]], an improved version featuring smaller screens, improved sound quality, an [[Advanced Audio Coding|AAC]] music player and two camerasâone on the outside and one facing the user.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendodsi.com/meet-dsi.jsp | title = Explore Nintendo DSi | accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in North America, Europe, and Australia at the start of April, 2009.
The successor of the DSi, with an expanded screen, is the [[Nintendo DSi XL]], which was released on November 21, 2009 in Japan and the first half of 2010 in other regions.&lt;ref name=mcvuk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcvuk.com/news/37129/DSi-XL-gets-March-5th-launch|title=Nintendo DSi XL to launch on March 5th|first=Dave|last=Roberts|date=2010-01-14|work=MCV|publisher=Intent Media|accessdate=2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The successor to the Nintendo DS line, the [[Nintendo 3DS]], uses the process of [[autostereoscopy]] to produce a [[stereoscopic]] three-dimensional effect (glasses-free) and was released in Japan on February 26, 2011, launched in Europe on March 25, 2011 and North America on March 27, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2010/100323e.pdf |title=Launch of New Portable Game Machine |date=23 March 2010 |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=2010-03-23 |location=[[Minami-ku, Kyoto]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console got off to a slow start, initially missing many key features that were promised before the system launched.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.techspot.com/news/44226-nintendo-3ds-passes-1-million-units-sold-in-japan-finally.html |title=Nintendo 3DS passes 1 million units sold in Japan, finally |date=13 June 2011 |publisher=TechSpot |accessdate=2011-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the subsequent price cuts, the addition of a second joystick via an adaptor and the increase in third-party support renewed optimism in the system from investors causing Nintendo's shares to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/n.php?n=nintendo-shares-leap-on-3ds-optimism-2011-08-23 |title=Nintendo shares leap on 3DS optimism |date=23 August 2011 |publisher=Hurriyet Daily News |accessdate=2011-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Policy==&lt;!--This section is linked from [[Nintendo policy]] and [[Nintendo Policies]]--&gt;

===Emulation===
{{Multiple issues|section=y|original research=June 2010|synthesis=June 2010|refimprove=June 2010}}
Nintendo, particularly ''Nintendo of America'', is known for a &quot;no tolerance&quot; stance for [[Video game console emulator|emulation]] of its video games and consoles, stating that it is the single largest threat to the intellectual rights of video game developers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nintendo.com/corp/legal.jsp#roms | title=Nintendo - Corporate Information - Legal Information (Copyrights, Emulators, ROMs, etc.) | accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo claims that copyright-like rights in [[mask work]]s protect its games from the exceptions that [[United States copyright law]] otherwise provides for personal backup copies. Nintendo uses the claim that emulators running on [[personal computer]]s have no use other than to play [[Copyright infringement of software|pirated video games]], though a use that doesn't involve [[intellectual property]] in this way is seen in the development and testing of independently produced [[Homebrew (video games)|&quot;homebrew&quot; software]] on Nintendo's platforms. It is also claimed that Nintendo's claims contradict copyright laws, mainly that [[ROM image]] copiers are illegal (they are legal if used to dump unprotected ROM images on to a user's computer for personal use, per {{usc|17|117}}(a)(1) and foreign counterparts)&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|117}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that emulators are illegal (if they do not use copyrighted BIOS, or use [[High-level emulation|other methods]] to run the game, they are legal; see [[Console emulator#Legal issues|Console emulator]] for further information about the legality of emulators). However, Nintendo remains the only modern console manufacturer that has not sued an emulator manufacturer.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}}
Emulators have been used by Nintendo and licensed third party companies as a means to re-release older games (e.g. [[Virtual Console]]).

===Content guidelines===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System]] --&gt;
For many years, Nintendo had a policy of strict content guidelines for video games published on its consoles. Although Nintendo of Japan allowed [[graphic violence]] in its video games, [[nudity and sexuality]] were strictly prohibited. Former Nintendo president [[Hiroshi Yamauchi]] believed that if the company allowed the licensing of [[Pornography|pornographic]] games, the company's image would be forever tarnished.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Over 1993&quot;&gt;''[[Game Over (book)|''Game Over'']], David Sheff, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Nintendo of America and Nintendo of Europe went further in that games released for Nintendo consoles could not feature nudity, sexuality, [[profanity]] (including [[racism]], [[sexism]] or [[Hate speech|slurs]]), blood, graphic or [[domestic violence]], [[drug]]s, political messages or [[Religious symbolism|religious symbol]]s (with the exception of widely unpracticed religions, such as the [[Greek mythology|Greek Pantheon]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filibustercartoons.com/Nintendo.php |title=Nintendo of America Content Guidelines |publisher=Filibustercartoons.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese parent company was concerned that it may be viewed as a &quot;Japanese Invasion&quot; by forcing Japanese [[community standard]]s on North American and European children. [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Joe Lieberman]] praised this [[zero tolerance]] policy, but others criticized the policy, claiming that gamers should be allowed to choose the content they want to see. Despite the strict guidelines, some exceptions have occurred: ''[[Bionic Commando (1988 video game)|Bionic Commando]]'' (though [[Nazi swastika|swastikas]] were eliminated in the US version), ''[[Smash TV]]'' and ''[[Golgo 13: Top Secret Episode]]'' contained human violence, the latter also containing implied [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and [[tobacco use]]; ''[[River City Ransom]]'' and ''[[Taboo: The Sixth Sense]]'' contained nudity, and the latter also contained religious images, as did ''[[Castlevania II: Simon's Quest|Castlevania II]]'' and ''[[Castlevania III: Dracula's Curse|III]]''.

A known side effect of this policy was the [[Mega Drive|Sega Genesis]] version of ''[[Mortal Kombat (video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'' selling over double the number of the Super NES version, mainly because Nintendo had forced publisher [[Acclaim Entertainment|Acclaim]] to recolor the red blood to look like white sweat and replace some of the more gory graphics in its release of the game, making it [[Nonviolent video game|non-violent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.retro.ign.com/articles/919/919357p10.html|title=IGN Presents the History of Mortal Kombat - Retro Feature at IGN|publisher=IGN|author=Travis Fahs|accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[Sega]] allowed blood and gore to remain in the Genesis version (though a code was required to unlock the gore). Nintendo allowed the Super NES version of ''[[Mortal Kombat II]]'' to ship uncensored the following year with a content warning on the packaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/game/mortal-kombat-ii/cover-art/gameCoverId,22874|title=''Mortal Kombat II'' cover artwork at [[MobyGames]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 and 2003, when the [[Entertainment Software Rating Board|ESRB]] and [[Pan European Game Information|PEGI]] (respectively) video game ratings systems were introduced, Nintendo chose to abolish most of these policies in favor of consumers making their own choices about the content of the games they played.  Today, changes to the content of games are done primarily by the game's developer or, occasionally, at the request of Nintendo.  The only clear-set rule is that ESRB AO-rated games will not be licensed on Nintendo consoles in North America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/buyers_guide.jsp |title=Nintendo of America Customer Service â Nintendo Buyer's Guide |publisher=Nintendo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; a practice which is also enforced by [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]] and [[Microsoft]], its two greatest competitors in the present market.  Nintendo has since allowed several mature-content games to be published on its consoles, including:  ''[[Perfect Dark]]'', ''[[Conker's Bad Fur Day]]'', ''[[Doom (video game)|Doom]]'' and ''[[Doom 64]]'', ''[[BMX XXX]]'', the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' series, ''[[killer7]]'', ''[[Eternal Darkness: Sanity's Requiem]]'', ''[[BloodRayne]]'', ''[[Geist (video game)|Geist]]'' and ''[[Dementium: The Ward]]''. Certain games have continued to be modified, however. For example, [[Konami]] was forced to remove all references to cigarettes in the 2000 [[Game Boy Color]] game ''[[Metal Gear Solid (Game Boy)|Metal Gear Solid]]'' (although the previous NES version of ''[[Metal Gear]]'' and the subsequent Gamecube game ''[[Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes]]'' both included such references, as did Wii title ''[[MadWorld]]''), and maiming and blood were removed from the Nintendo 64 [[Porting|port]] of ''[[Cruis'n|Cruis'n USA]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ign64.ign.com/articles/060/060333p1.html | title=IGN: Nintendo to censor Cruis'n | date=1996-10-08 | accessdate=2009-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another example is in the Game Boy Advance game ''[[Mega Man Zero 3]]'', in which one of the bosses, called Hellbat Schilt in the Japanese and European releases, was renamed Devilbat Schilt in North America. [[Internationalization and localization|localization]].  In North America releases of the ''[[Mega Man Zero]]'' games, enemies and bosses killed with a saber attack would not gush blood as they did in the Japanese versions.  However, the release of the Wii has been accompanied by a number of even more controversial mature titles, such as ''[[Manhunt 2]]'', ''[[No More Heroes (video game)|No More Heroes]]'', ''[[The House of the Dead: Overkill]]'' and ''[[MadWorld]]'', the latter three of which are published exclusively for the console. The Nintendo DS also has violent games, such as ''[[Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars]]'', ''[[Dementium: The Ward]]'', ''[[Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil: Deadly Silence]]''.

===License guidelines===
Nintendo of America also had guidelines before 1993 that had to be followed by its licensees to make games for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]], in addition to the above content guidelines:.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Over 1993&quot;/&gt; Guidelines were enforced through the [[10NES]] lockout chip.
*Licensees were not permitted to release the same game for a competing console until two years had passed.
*Nintendo would decide how many cartridges would be supplied to the licensee.
*Nintendo would decide how much space would be dedicated for articles, advertising, etc. in the ''[[Nintendo Power]]'' magazine.
*There was a minimum number of cartridges that had to be ordered by the licensee from Nintendo.
*There was a yearly limit of five games that a licensee may produce for a Nintendo console.&lt;ref&gt;D. Sheff: &quot;Game Over&quot;, p. 215. CyberActive Media Group, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;  This rule was created to prevent market over-saturation, which had caused the [[North American video game crash of 1983]].

The last rule was circumvented in a number of ways; for example, Konami, wanting to produce more games for Nintendo's consoles, formed [[Ultra Games]] and later [[Ultra Games|Palcom]] to produce more games as a technically different publisher.&lt;ref name=&quot;Game Over 1993&quot;/&gt;  This disadvantaged smaller or emerging companies, as they could not afford to start additional companies. In another side effect, [[Square Co.]] (now [[Square Enix]]) executives have suggested that the price of publishing games on the [[Nintendo 64]] along with the degree of censorship and control that Nintendo enforced over its games, most notably ''[[Final Fantasy VI]]'', were factors in switching its focus towards [[Sony Computer Entertainment|Sony]]'s [[PlayStation]] console.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

===Seal of Quality===
[[File:Nintendo Official Seal.svg|thumb|150px|Official Nintendo Seal in [[NTSC]] regions]]
[[File:Nintendo seal of quality.jpg|thumb|150px|Nintendo's Official Seal of Quality in [[PAL]] regions]]
The gold starburst seal was first used by [[#Offices and locations|Nintendo of America]], and later Nintendo of Europe. It is displayed on any game, system, or accessory licensed for use on one of its [[video game console]]s, denoting the game has been properly licensed by Nintendo.{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}

====NTSC regions====
In [[NTSC]] regions, this seal is an elliptical starburst titled &quot;Official Nintendo Seal&quot;. Originally, for NTSC countries, the seal was a large, black and gold circular starburst. The seal read as follows: &quot;This seal is your assurance that NINTENDO has approved and guaranteed the quality of this product.&quot; This seal was later altered in 1988: &quot;approved and guaranteed&quot; was changed to &quot;evaluated and approved&quot;.  In 1989, the seal became gold and white, as it currently appears, with a shortened phrase, &quot;Official Nintendo Seal of Quality&quot;. It was changed in 2003 to read &quot;Official Nintendo Seal&quot;.[http://www.nintendo.com/consumer/licensed.jsp]

====PAL regions====
In [[PAL]] regions, the seal is a circular starburst titled, &quot;Original Nintendo Seal of Quality&quot;.  Text near the seal in the [[Australian]] [[Wii]] manual states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;This seal is your assuranace that Nintendo has reviewed this product and that it has met our standards for excellence in workmanship, reliability and entertainment value. Always look for this seal when buying games and accessories to ensure complete compatibility with your Nintendo product.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nintendo.com.au/support/files/Wii_Manuals/WiiMotionPlusOperationsManual.pdf &quot;Wii MotionPlus Operations Manual&quot;] Nintendo. 2009. Last accessed 10 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Environmental record===
[[Greenpeace]]'s October 2010 &quot;Guide to Greener Electronics&quot; report ranks Nintendo last on a list of electronics manufacturers, with the same score (1.8 out of 10) as in the previous version of the guide (May 2010). The report cites increasing [[carbon dioxide]] emissions (failed to be reduced per target) and a lack of waste management. Limited praise focuses on satisfactory energy efficiency of the DSi's AC adapter, the reduction of [[PVC]] usage in wiring (and new chemical regulations) and the disclosure of carbon dioxide emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Greenpeace Guide to Greener Electronics: Nokia Is Tops, Nintendo Flops|url=http://www.fastcompany.com/blog/ariel-schwartz/sustainability/greenpeace-guide-greener-electronics-nokia-tops-nintendo-flops}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the January 2010 version of the ranking, Nintendo scored 1.4 points, at which, three days later, Nintendo issued a response that addressed primary concerns, highlighting a policy to indicate the materials used in each product, which makes end-of-life recycling of products easier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nintendo Defends Environmental Record Against Greenpeace|url=http://www.industrygamers.com/news/nintendo-defends-environmental-record-against-greenpeace/|publisher=IndustryGamers|last=Radd|first=David|date=January 11, 2010|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
