== Vern Smith Leadership Award ==
[[File:031 Training Camp.jpg|thumb|upright|Brad Maynard is the only special teams player to win the award.]]
[[File:Garrett Wolfe.jpg|thumb|upright|Garrett Wolfe won the Vern Davis award in 2006 after setting many MAC rushing records.]]
The Vern Smith Leadership Award was started in 1982 by the [[Downtown Toledo Athletic Club]].  In that year, it was known as the Jefferson Award and the name was changed to honor the [[University of Toledo]] Athletic Director Vern Smith in 1987.&lt;ref name=&quot;vern smith&quot; group=&quot;ref&quot;/&gt;  The award is given to the top football player in the Mid-American Conference.  Only four players have won the award multiple times, with the most recent winner, [[Larry English]], being the only non-[[quarterback]] to win it.  [[Northern Illinois Huskies football|Northern Illinois]] leads with six awards all-time, followed by [[Bowling Green Falcons football|Bowling Green]], [[Central Michigan Chippewas football|Central Michigan]] and [[Marshall Thundering Herd football|Marshall]] tied with four awards in each school.  The Vern Smith award is the only one voted on by the coaches, with the Coach of the Year, as well as the Players of the Year are selected by the media.
